00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Okay, so this week we are going to do something a little bit different.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,800
Welcome to Loose Canon, where I go through different iterations of characters or franchises

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,400
that I either know a lot about or like for some reason.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,200
This week we're starting with the duplicitous, shrill-voiced, eternal, second-in-command of the Decepticons...

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,700
Starscream.

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,200
I'm an adult.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,200
You are either lying or you're stupid!

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,500
I'm stupid! I'm stupid!

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,200
...one of the most popular of all of the Transformers.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,500
This is not to say that he is the best Transformer by any stretch.

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,700
That is obviously any of them but Starscream.

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:49,700
But he has remained one of the most well-known, in large part because he's one of the very few Transformers

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,500
that people outside of Superfans ever remember.

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,500
So, today we're going to talk about the many different iterations of Starscream

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,000
since he was first modeled and painted over 30 years ago.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,500
Why should you be the Supreme God? I'm a much better choice!

17
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,800
And because there are a finite number of hours in the day,

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,200
I will not be discussing every depiction of Starscream ever.

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,800
My big blind spots are the comics and the video games and the toys, which...

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,600
Shut up.

21
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,300
You want to discuss those versions? Be my guest in the comments.

22
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,500
Talk about Kiss Players all you want because...

23
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,500
Oh my...

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,500
No, no, this retrospectively, only the cartoons and of course, my bae, Starscream.

25
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,500
Starscream's most prominent characteristic is that he is duplicitous.

26
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,200
The Decepticon who plans his escape is hardly a failure!

27
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,700
He pretends to be faithful to Megatron, but really wants to be the leader of the Decepticons.

28
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,200
He's also really bad at hiding this.

29
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,200
Like in this episode...

30
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,700
Like in this episode where the Decepticons get stuck in a time portal and decide,

31
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,200
hey, while we're here, let's take over Camelot.

32
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,700
Because it's there and finally Starscream will have something to rule over.

33
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,700
Yeah.

34
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:47,200
Aiming Lord Starscream to stand invincible in this primitive world.

35
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,200
So with all this in mind, Starscream was and continues to be one of the most popular Transformers.

36
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Especially with the ladies.

37
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,700
This makes some sense if you consider that the ladies also love Loki.

38
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,200
I said...

39
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,200
No!

40
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,700
Now, Megatron, who is the new Decepticon leader?

41
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,200
So Starscream is like baby's first Loki.

42
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,700
If you're into that.

43
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,200
G1 Starscream is about as shallow as a puddle,

44
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,200
but one episode, Fire in the Sky, could be argued that it gave him a little bit of depth.

45
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,200
Starscream, why are you so concerned about this creature?

46
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,200
Because I knew him once.

47
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,200
Like, you know, like an inch, and that might explain the fangirl army part of it.

48
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,700
We find out that Starscream has something of a pre-war history with this guy Skyfire,

49
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,700
and he's also the only person former in the entire series

50
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,700
that he ever remotely seems to be concerned about besides himself.

51
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,700
I circled half the globe searching for him.

52
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,700
Of course, when Skyfire inevitably defects to the Autobots,

53
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,200
Starscream's like, whatever, take that,

54
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,200
and then their past and tragic-ish backstory is never spoken of again.

55
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,200
Ever.

56
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,700
But Skyfire is...is gone.

57
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,700
He won't be forgotten, Spike.

58
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,200
Yeah, thanks for digging him out, assholes.

59
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
And here's the wonderful thing about Starscream.

60
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,700
For those first two seasons that are burned into the Stone of Eternity,

61
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,700
he basically had the dumbest dynamic with his lord and ruler Megatron.

62
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,200
Even, you know, for an 80s cartoon.

63
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,200
Pretty much every time the nigh-indestructible Megatron gets, like, a scratch,

64
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,200
Starscream's all like, well, he's dead because I'm in charge now.

65
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,200
Megatron has fallen!

66
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,700
I, Starscream, am now your leader!

67
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,200
And then he was fired? Nope.

68
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,200
I am now the leader of all Decepticons!

69
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,700
And then they killed him? Nope.

70
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,700
You disgust me.

71
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,700
So one of the great mysteries of the ages is why Megatron even has career backstabber Starscream

72
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,200
as his second-in-command in the first place.

73
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,200
Although, if you go into this series expecting anything to make sense,

74
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,200
you're probably in the wrong place.

75
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:06,200
Wait a minute. Since when do ghosts tumble out of control through space?

76
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,200
So then came the movie.

77
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,200
Called Transformers, the movie.

78
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Starscream finally gets to be the leader of the Decepticons

79
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,200
after Megatron gets a little, not dead, but dead enough.

80
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,200
Basically, and he gets a fabulous crown and everything, and then is immediately killed.

81
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,200
Along with basically the rest of the cast.

82
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,200
But, unlike the rest of the cast, Starscream came back.

83
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,200
A lot.

84
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:45,200
Starscream's ghost came back and possessed Cyclonus in an episode in season three called,

85
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,200
uh, well, Starscream's Ghost.

86
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Uh, well, Starscream's Ghost.

87
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,200
We learned that he did indeed have something of the special,

88
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,200
as he's the only dead one who ever comes back.

89
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,200
And he possesses other Transformers.

90
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Twice.

91
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Then, ten years later, we've got Beast Wars, and he's back again!

92
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,200
In basically the same way.

93
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,200
They extended the whole ghost thing, and, oh, he's got the special too.

94
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Like, he's got this mutant indestructible spark, so, you know,

95
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:22,200
somehow he time-travel into the future past, because Beast Wars is weird.

96
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:28,200
So he possesses Waspinator, yeah, for one episode,

97
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:33,200
and so now he's like a time-traveling mutant alien robot ghost.

98
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:40,200
Air Commander Starscream of the Decepticon Battle Fleet!

99
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Which is weird, because the last time we see him, he's, uh...

100
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,200
I live again!

101
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,200
Uh, so he gets a new body, and the last time we see him, he's floating around.

102
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Out there in space.

103
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,200
Galvatron shot him, but he's still got his body, so, you know, he's fine.

104
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,200
So the whole Beast Wars thing...

105
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
I don't even know.

106
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,200
Sadly, Chris Latta, who voiced the iconic original Starscream,

107
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,200
died a couple of years before the Beast Wars version came out.

108
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,200
And it's not the best Beast Wars episode by any stretch,

109
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,200
but, hey, at least it's a pretty good impression.

110
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Next!

111
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Why do the ladies love Starscream?

112
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,200
I've heard it's argued that it might be because of Transformers Armada.

113
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,200
This is one of the few animated series that was not made on the American side.

114
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,200
They did Born and Raised in Japan,

115
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,200
which might explain why they tried to give Starscream some depth,

116
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,200
and, you know, internal conflict, and a friend,

117
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,200
in the form of unreasonably tolerant and accepting anime girl

118
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,200
of infinite patience and trust and kindness.

119
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,200
I'm fine, you guys, but I don't think Starscream is.

120
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,200
He's an asshole. I just need to try harder.

121
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
Starscream is disillusioned with Megatron in this version,

122
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,200
but instead of wanting to just be the leader of all of the things,

123
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
he wants Megatron to die.

124
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,200
He also kind of wants friends, but he wants Megatron to die,

125
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
so he spends basically the whole run of the series like,

126
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,200
I don't know what I want, I don't know who I am.

127
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,200
He's basically the Jesus of this series in that he dies for everyone else,

128
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,200
which is weird, because it's Starscream.

129
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,200
So while one could argue that this version of Starscream

130
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
is a little more engaging than the others,

131
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,200
because he's got something of an arc over the course of the series,

132
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,200
and I feel like going down that road could have worked,

133
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
yeah, this is what we ended up with.

134
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Leave me alone. Now leave me alone.

135
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,200
I want to be left alone now. I want to be left alone.

136
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,200
They don't understand what it's like to be a Decepticon.

137
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,200
It really doesn't help that his voice sounds like an angsty Krusty the Clown.

138
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,200
You can't possibly understand the humiliation that I've suffered.

139
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Will you just leave me alone?

140
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,200
What the hell was that?

141
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,200
I don't need your sympathy. Now leave me alone.

142
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Leave me alone!

143
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Even the Minicons have abandoned me now.

144
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,200
Transformers Animated, or as I like to remember it, Transformers Chins.

145
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,200
You interrupted my speech!

146
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
You like chins, we got your chins.

147
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,200
So this was the first American animated version of Transformers since Beast Machines,

148
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,200
made to coincide with the first live-action movie. We'll get to that.

149
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,200
Unlike with Beast Wars, where they had an entirely new cast and premise,

150
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,200
this one is more of a return to basics for a younger set,

151
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,200
with basically the same, but much smaller, cast as the G1 cartoon.

152
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Now let's try this again.

153
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,200
This version of Starscream was voiced by Tom Kenny,

154
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,200
who would also go on the following year to voice another beloved Transformer.

155
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,200
This show, unlike the G1 cartoon, also featured effort,

156
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,200
which right off kind of reveals the problem with writing Starscream

157
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,200
as his original little shit-heel self and maintaining any kind of internal logic to the show,

158
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
which this one, you know, tries to.

159
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,200
The result is that he's going to do his thing,

160
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,200
and inevitably gets booted from the Decepticons almost immediately

161
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,200
because he is the way he is, and then he spends the rest of the series

162
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,200
trying to take over from the outside.

163
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,200
It's either going to be that, or have Megatron be an idiot, and you know,

164
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,200
we can't have that, you know, he's got to be at least a little threatening.

165
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
He's not Gargamel.

166
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,200
This version of Starscream is also noteworthy for giving us a female version of Starscream.

167
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
Clone.

168
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,200
Where the clones represent, like, aspects to his personality.

169
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Okay then.

170
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,200
Alright, now let's talk about the movies.

171
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,200
I'd argue that there aren't really characters in the Bay movies.

172
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Really, there are events that happen around action set pieces,

173
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,200
and occasionally an actor will scream.

174
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,200
But, you know, we'll make do with what we got.

175
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,200
So, this version of Starscream looks like a pointy Dorito on roids.

176
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Oh...

177
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,200
So, in the first movie, he doesn't show up until basically the third act,

178
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,200
and one must presume he's been off-screen chillin' somewhere.

179
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,200
So, when I found out that they cast voice actor Charlie Adler as Starscream,

180
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,200
I was like, hey, I know that guy. He's perfect.

181
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,200
You might know him as Ickis, or the Big Heads, if you're my age,

182
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,200
as well as a zillion other things.

183
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,200
So, I was kind of surprised that this was what we ended up with in the first movie.

184
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
Where is the cube?

185
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,200
The humans have taken it.

186
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,200
He only had, like, one line that ended up sounding really generic,

187
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,200
and I'm guessing he had to sound like a toy-selling badass.

188
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
One line.

189
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,200
The humans have taken it.

190
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,200
And then Megatron's like...

191
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,200
You fail me yet again, Starscream.

192
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,200
See, I guess that's supposed to be like a little fan moment,

193
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,200
like wink-wink, nudge-nudge.

194
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,200
You have failed again, Starscream.

195
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
It's like, what?

196
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
Who is this guy? Why did he fail you?

197
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,200
Because of the thing he got away?

198
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
I mean, he just showed up. He just showed up.

199
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
We don't know who he is.

200
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,200
They don't even mention that he's Megatron's second-in-command in the movies,

201
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,200
or that he's been in charge these last, oh, however many thousand years,

202
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,200
they said it was.

203
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,200
So impressive.

204
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,200
In fairness to Mr. Adler's voice work, it got better.

205
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,200
By which I mean, he was allowed to be more interesting in the next two movies.

206
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,200
Megatron, I was so relieved to hear of your resurrection.

207
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Which is one of the very few things you can say was an improvement on the first one.

208
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,200
Someone had to take command.

209
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,200
He also gets a little more screen time, which I presume is why.

210
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:31,200
But the movies kind of quietly omit the whole Starscream trying to supplant Megatron thing.

211
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,200
They did maintain that sadomasochistic dynamic,

212
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,200
but at no point does Starscream ever try to take over the Decepticons.

213
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,200
So the result is just that Megatron's kind of an asshole.

214
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
I can't even rely on you.

215
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
What a simple insect.

216
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,200
Again, like every other character in these movies.

217
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
No, Optimus!

218
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,200
So with Starscream barely in all three movies, and when he is, he's just kind of there.

219
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,200
My master, such a brilliant scheme.

220
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Basically, at no point is he interesting or memorable.

221
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,200
If you don't know Transformers, you'll be bored and confused.

222
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,200
And if you do know who he is, you'll be disappointed.

223
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,200
So I don't know who this is for.

224
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,200
At some rare points, they'll play him like he's this badass.

225
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:23,200
But in the end, he gets taken out by actual cannibal Shia LaBeouf.

226
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
And that's all she wrote.

227
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
Next.

228
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,200
All hail Starscream.

229
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Aw, hell mother whining, yes.

230
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,200
This Starscream is fabulous!

231
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,200
He's also the best one.

232
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,200
See, G1 Starscream is always going to be my favorite,

233
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,200
because the silliness of him just fills me with such a glee, you know, and also nostalgia.

234
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
Hello.

235
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,200
I've had enough of this chivalrous nonsense!

236
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,200
Transformers Prime's Starscream is just the best package.

237
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,200
He's the best written, the most engaging, the best designed, best acted,

238
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,200
most watchable, most fabulous A-plus Starscream.

239
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,200
And it only took us 20-some tries to get to this point.

240
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,200
But once I finally hunkered down and watched it,

241
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,200
this series honestly, in my opinion, rivals Beast Wars in terms of just being the best one.

242
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,200
But I always had a hard time with Beast Wars anyway for a number of reasons.

243
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,200
Although Beast Wars does win on one count.

244
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,200
No annoying kids.

245
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,200
That's a discussion for another day.

246
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,200
We're supposed to be at a rock concert.

247
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Do you know how long I've waited to see Slash Monkey?

248
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Uh...

249
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
Forever!

250
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,200
So Transformers Animated shows us the problem with having a character like Starscream

251
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,200
in a show with a storyline that goes for any number of episodes

252
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,200
and actually changes from week to week.

253
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,200
Unless Megatron's a moron or the show doesn't make any sense,

254
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,200
he's going to get booted and spend the rest of the series in a subplot.

255
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,200
And the Megatron in this show is a stone-cold badass.

256
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
Despite your treachery,

257
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,200
I've allowed you to carry on this long because I took a certain delight

258
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,200
in following your string of failures.

259
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,200
But you finally become tiresome.

260
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,200
And somehow they manage to more or less stay on the same team for

261
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,200
almost a whole season

262
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,200
before he inevitably gets booted.

263
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Starscream.

264
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,200
Aligned with no side.

265
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,200
Then he spends a good chunk of the series in a subplot

266
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,200
before eventually rejoining with the Decepticons.

267
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,200
He's probably the most competent version of Starscream to date,

268
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,200
finally striking a balance of cowardly and kind of badass,

269
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,200
and plus he has those fabulous heels.

270
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
You go, girl.

271
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,200
So while I do think it's kind of a stretch to consider the concept fresh at this point,

272
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,200
at least they efforted enough to the point where it was actually a pretty good show

273
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,200
and a pretty good interpretation of the characters.

274
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,200
And for the based on toys thing,

275
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,200
which a lot of kids shows are now,

276
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,200
I guess that's as good as you can hope for.

277
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,200
See, there's this idea that the toys really are carte blanche

278
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,200
and the characters don't matter at all,

279
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,200
which I agree with on some level,

280
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,200
but not entirely.

281
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,200
Not with this franchise.

282
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Otherwise we wouldn't keep seeing the same story over and over.

283
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Is the story of the Autobots versus the Decepticons

284
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,200
with basically the same characters each time

285
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,200
worthy of telling over and over again?

286
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
Probably not.

287
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
But that's what we got,

288
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,200
and it's all rooted in a deeply, deeply silly 30-year-old cartoon.

289
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,200
Nobody touches back on me!

290
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200
When you watch the original Transformers cartoon

291
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
in all of its bizarre, cracked-out glory,

292
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:54,200
there is a subtle cleverness to the way that it might have resonated with really young kids,

293
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,200
more than other similar series that came later,

294
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,200
is the fact that the Transformers' interactions with each other

295
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
so mirror that of little children.

296
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,200
No, I'm the leader!

297
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,200
No, me!

298
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,200
And then no real consequences ever.

299
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,200
As an adult, that's pretty dumb.

300
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
But as a kid, it resonates.

301
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,200
So when it gets adapted into different media,

302
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,200
be it more adult...

303
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,200
or just more sophisticated,

304
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
it's almost like a challenge.

305
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,200
How can you take an admittedly pretty limited character

306
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,200
and rehash it over and over and yet make it still work?

307
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,200
Especially if you're trying to go for a more sophisticated audience,

308
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,200
which kids are nowadays.

309
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,200
Sorry, Gin Wires and Millennials.

310
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,200
So what is the continued appeal of Starscream?

311
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,200
The key word here, I would argue, is motivation.

312
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,200
And this is an integral aspect for any compelling character.

313
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,200
Walter White, Tony Soprano, Mystique, Loki...

314
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Whether they're good guys or bad guys,

315
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,200
they're deeply motivated, therefore compelling,

316
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
therefore you kinda like them.

317
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,200
You were made to be ruled.

318
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,200
I give the orders now, and this is my castle.

319
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,200
Your character can have the most convoluted, deep, meaningful,

320
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,200
intricate backstory of all of the characters that have ever existed,

321
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,200
but if they don't want something,

322
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,200
in a narrative that makes them a bit tougher to grasp onto and identify with.

323
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,200
So next to pretty much every other character on the show,

324
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,200
not only does Starscream show the clearest and most consistent character motivation,

325
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,200
but also the most well-defined personality.

326
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,200
Therefore, as a character, Starscream is probably the most memorable,

327
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,200
and adults tend to conflate remembering something with liking something.

328
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,200
You'll regret that you did not destroy me, Megatron!

329
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,200
I shall have my revenge!

330
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
Baby's first Loki.

331
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,200
I'm stupid! I'm stupid!
