1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
Oh hey, good! It's like everyone's talking about Beauty and the Beast again, which I guess means this hottest of takes is back.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,040
ðŸŽµ

3
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,760
Wow, and you're like about the 26 millionth person to make this hot take.

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,680
Yeah, I read that correct article from five years ago, too.

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,480
Okay, disclosure of bias, if you will, if you put me into a room with a gun to my head,

6
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:41,820
I would say that yes, this movie is probably in my top two and a half favorite Disney movies.

7
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,080
It's the only animated film ever nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture,

8
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,480
and this is back when they had only five nominees.

9
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,580
It contains some of the most incredible and nuanced animation in any movie ever,

10
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,980
and all made under a super tight deadline and about half the time it normally takes to make an animated movie,

11
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,980
and with very little faith from the higher-ups.

12
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:06,880
The original Beauty and the Beast reputation has taken a slight turn in recent years as the target for lazy internet jokes,

13
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,180
and as someone who makes their living making lazy internet jokes, even I'm kind of tired of this whole like,

14
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,680
hey look, I'm smarter than a 90s Disney movie trend.

15
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,080
Like, wow, she falls in love with him despite him being a jerk to her and imprisoning her, like, yeah.

16
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,880
I mean, that's kind of the point.

17
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,680
See, it's like, it's like one of those stories about forgiveness, see?

18
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,780
I understand that sometimes a Disney movie can, can be a little too subtle for y'all.

19
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,980
He's no Monster Gaston, you are!

20
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:46,480
Now, that said, that does not mean that it is not worth it to explore the possible merit of these lazy internet jokes,

21
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,680
and maybe one day I'll get into the crap they added into the new movie to fix

22
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,180
some of the criticisms that have come down the pike over the last 20 years.

23
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,180
Uh, no, but in the meantime, we're here to ask the question,

24
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,480
Does Belle have Stockholm Syndrome?

25
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,980
No.

26
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,180
Thank you for watching, uh, like, share, and subscribe to my channel.

27
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:13,780
Thank you, of course, to all my, uh, lovely patrons, I couldn't do this without you.

28
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,780
Oh, you want me to, like, actually talk about the thing.

29
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,880
Okay, well, you know what, first, let's, let's figure out what Stockholm Syndrome even is.

30
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,680
Stockholm Syndrome describes a psychological phenomenon where hostages,

31
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:36,280
kidnapping victims, and victims of abuse develop intense emotional ties to their captors slash abusers as a survival strategy.

32
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,780
The name refers to an incident in Stockholm, Sweden in 1973,

33
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,080
when four hostages, who had been taken captive by bank robbers,

34
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,980
eventually refused to testify against their captors.

35
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,180
Here are the key components to the development of Stockholm Syndrome.

36
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,180
That the hostage develops positive feelings towards their captor.

37
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,480
There is no previous hostage-captor relationship.

38
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:05,380
Um, that the hostage has an increasing belief in the humanity of their captor.

39
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:10,680
That the hostage learns to excuse abusive behaviors of their captor.

40
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:18,080
And, of course, a refusal by the hostage to accept the support of the authorities.

41
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,080
Hmm.

42
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,780
Okay, but here's the thing.

43
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,880
The aforementioned are just requirements for the development of what could be considered Stockholm Syndrome.

44
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,180
They are not symptoms. Symptoms.

45
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,080
Here are the symptoms.

46
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:45,180
Number one, a severely uneven power relationship in which the captor dictates what the prisoner can and cannot do.

47
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,180
The castle is your home now, so you can go anywhere you like.

48
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,380
Except the West Wing.

49
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,280
What's in the West Wing?

50
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,080
It's forbidden!

51
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,480
You will join me for dinner.

52
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,780
That's not a request!

53
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,580
Let's put a pin in that one.

54
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,880
We'll come back to that.

55
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,880
Number two, the captive is held under the threat of death or physical injury at the hands of the captor.

56
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,380
You have my word.

57
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,680
Done!

58
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,280
Okay, well, I guess we got that one too.

59
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,680
Wait a minute. Whose idea was it for Belle to stay at the castle anyway?

60
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,180
Take me instead.

61
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,380
You!

62
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:28,980
Yeah, I mean, she is being held against her will in the same way you're being held against your will if you're in ninth grade trig and you're dying to go home.

63
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,480
But there is a key difference here.

64
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,180
This is not a kidnapper-kidnappy relationship.

65
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,880
She stays in the castle because they make an agreement.

66
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,080
You have my word.

67
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,780
Done!

68
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,380
And point number two here is where the whole argument falls apart.

69
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,780
The captive is held because she made an agreement.

70
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:50,980
And this isn't even, like, in the fairy tale where she exchanges herself for her dad who is being held under a very clear threat of death.

71
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,580
The Beast just kind of sounds like he's making it up like he goes along, like he's just a kid who has no idea what he's doing.

72
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,880
Would you let him go?

73
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,080
Yes, but...

74
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,680
You must promise to stay here forever.

75
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,380
Um, forever.

76
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,480
There's one point in the movie where the threat of violence does pop up and it's right here.

77
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,480
Stop!

78
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,980
Get out!

79
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,480
No!

80
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,780
Get out!

81
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,480
Which brings us to Stockholm point number three.

82
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,380
Inability to engage in behaviors that may assist in their release or detachment.

83
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,080
See, here's what follows immediately after Beast's little outburst.

84
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,980
Where are you going?

85
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,580
Promise or no promise.

86
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,180
I can't stay here another minute.

87
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,280
Yeah, she'd been in the castle for maybe five hours.

88
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,580
So once the Beast starts throwing tables around, Belle runs away,

89
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,480
even as she leaves mentioning the little verbal contract that had been keeping her there and then dismissing it.

90
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,280
And this brings us back to point number one.

91
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,780
The Beast defines rules.

92
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,780
The castle is your home now, so you can go anywhere you like, except the West Wing.

93
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,680
What's in the West Wing?

94
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,680
It's forbidden!

95
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,480
And then Belle is immediately like,

96
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,780
Tra-la-la-la-la, no.

97
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,680
If Stockholm syndrome is a condition displayed by the victim,

98
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,280
then Belle does not apply because she does not respect the rules set up for her from basically the word go.

99
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,780
Ah, so that's the West Wing.

100
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,580
Point number four.

101
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,280
And then after X amount of violence,

102
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,880
the smallest act of kindness on the part of the captor, or even the absence of violence,

103
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,480
elicits sympathetic feelings from the captive.

104
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,780
This one, I think, is the symptom that people are most familiar with,

105
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,180
and therefore the one that tends to trip people up.

106
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:45,580
It really bugs me when people file this movie into the I can fix him category.

107
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:51,580
No rules, no punishments, and no more secrets.

108
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,880
I can do that.

109
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,480
Because Belle never sets out to fix the Beast. Ever.

110
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,880
I mean, yeah, she's way more reasonable than anyone in that situation might be expected to be,

111
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,480
but she basically responds to his absence of dickery.

112
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,980
Now, this is not the case in the Beauty and the Beast direct-to-video sequels.

113
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,380
Come on!

114
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,280
Ooh, boy.

115
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,480
You said you'd never leave.

116
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,680
I just wanted to make you happy.

117
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,080
But in the original movie, i.e. The Thing That Matters,

118
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,780
her goal is never at any point, either stated or unstated, to make the Beast into another person.

119
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,980
If he's a jerk, she responds in kind.

120
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,480
Will you come down to dinner?

121
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,980
No.

122
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,080
If he's nice, she responds in kind.

123
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,480
She treats him fairly, and he decides to improve himself of his own volition out of respect and fondness for her.

124
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,780
And eventually, she responds by being like,

125
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,480
eh, I guess I wouldn't kick him out of bed.

126
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,480
The archetypal Stockholm Syndrome setting is more like, you know,

127
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:50,080
your captor throws a scrap of bread at you after having starved you for weeks on end,

128
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,080
you know, not necessarily saved you from a pack of ravenous wolves.

129
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,080
That said, I'm not convinced that the Beast didn't, like,

130
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,680
slip those wolves a twenty under the table.

131
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,080
Anyway.

132
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,880
So after the Beast gets in a fight with some wolves, falls down,

133
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,980
Belle recognizes that he put himself in harm's way to save her,

134
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,880
and for whatever reason that is implied by this expression here,

135
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,580
it's up to you as a viewer,

136
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,580
she decides to keep her end of the bargain and stay with him.

137
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,580
Which leads us to the scene and point number five.

138
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,680
A self-preservation instinct on the part of the prisoner,

139
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,580
the victim learns to avoid triggers that will set off the captor.

140
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,580
Belle never does this, even from the very beginning.

141
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,580
That hurts!

142
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,580
If you'd hold still, it wouldn't hurt as much.

143
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,980
Well, if you hadn't have run away, this wouldn't have happened.

144
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,580
If you hadn't frightened me, I wouldn't have run away.

145
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,380
And that's part of what makes this scene so great.

146
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:39,280
She doesn't put up with his shit, but she does give credit where credit is due.

147
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,280
And that leaves the door open for him to stop being such a dickhead.

148
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,380
By the way, thank you for saving my life.

149
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,580
Point number six, negative feelings by the victim toward family, friends,

150
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,080
or authorities trying to rescue or support the victim.

151
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,980
If only I could see my father again, just for a moment.

152
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,680
I miss him so much.

153
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,680
Nope.

154
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:07,180
Papa! No, he's sick.

155
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,780
He may be dying and he's all alone.

156
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:14,380
At this point in the film, the Beast is caught between keeping Belle here

157
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:20,180
and possibly saving his own humanity, or letting her go and putting her needs before his.

158
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,080
And the second he says she could peace out to go help her dad, she's like, okay, bye!

159
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,580
Thank you for understanding how much he needs me.

160
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,080
That feeling where you think you got this chick to like you,

161
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,380
but then it turns out you're a literal f***ing monster holding her as a hostage.

162
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,480
Best sound.

163
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,380
And if it weren't for the mob of angry villagers,

164
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,880
we don't have any indication as to whether or not Belle would have ever come back.

165
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,380
I mean, she might have, you know, to return this dish she stole, but you know.

166
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,180
But the most important facet that people miss about Stockholm Syndrome

167
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,180
is that it is not a diagnosable mental disorder.

168
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,980
It is not on the DSM.

169
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,180
Stockholm Syndrome is considered a contested illness,

170
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,880
as a large portion of the psychiatric and law enforcement community do not think it is a thing.

171
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,880
So honestly, this entire conversation is almost rendered moot

172
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:09,880
because Stockholm Syndrome kind of belongs more in the category of debunked pseudoscience

173
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,580
than actual, studyable, psychological conditions.

174
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,580
Or at the very least, it's in the category of more research needed.

175
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,880
Making Beauty and the Beast about Stockholm Syndrome is kind of missing the forest for the trees.

176
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,980
You know, if you basically only had a passing pop culture knowledge of either forest or trees.

177
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:34,480
Beauty and the Beast is a story about, you know, friendship and forgiveness, that sort of thing.

178
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,380
And the romantic aspect is played down to near non-existence.

179
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,380
I'm on the fence as to how romantic it even is.

180
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,880
Just look at the look on her face when he turns back into a man.

181
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,380
Even for a Disney movie, this is a pretty sexless relationship, at least from Belle's side of things.

182
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:54,380
He's my friend. He's my friend.

183
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,980
I mean, I do enjoy beasts.

184
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,580
Hey, look, girl, I did it, face!

185
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,280
Aww.

186
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,280
So even ignoring the fact that most law enforcement and mental health professionals

187
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,080
do not think that Stockholm Syndrome is actually even a thing,

188
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,480
this movie is not a good example of... thing.

189
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,380
Does not mean that this term does not necessarily apply,

190
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,980
just means that this term is not a good one.

191
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,980
Stop using it.

192
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:27,880
But while we're here, Beauty and the Beast is the story of a young girl who wants

193
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,380
adventure in the great white somewhere

194
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:36,880
but then learns that getting married to a rich guy who held you prisoner for a while is pretty good.

195
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,280
Actually, no, let's reframe that.

196
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,080
Beauty and the Beast is a story of two men who view the same woman as a shiny object to be controlled,

197
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,280
and where one of them learns to see her humanity, the other one falls to his death.

198
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:54,680
Well, that's a more... well, I guess let's say it's a more optimistic way of framing it,

199
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:00,280
because the story, regardless of how it's set up, it's not really Belle's story.

200
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,880
It's the Beast.

201
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,180
He's the one who learns, he's the one who changes, he's the one with a character arc,

202
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,880
and it's much stronger if you look at it that way because Belle's arc is...

203
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,480
well, I guess she does learn to wear other dresses.

204
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,380
Compare the Disney movie to the original fairy tale where the arc is all Beauty's.

205
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,980
The Beast, we are told, already has a heart of gold, and we're gonna ignore the whole dad rose thing.

206
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,980
Beauty just needs to see that he has a good heart,

207
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,980
so the arc is hers all along, and learning to see Beauty in something that is superficially ugly.

208
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,980
In the original fairy tale, the arc is Beauty's, where in the Disney movie, it all belongs to the Beast.

209
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,680
This is a trend we see in a lot of Renaissance Disney.

210
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:43,080
The heroine states a want, be it, you know, legs, or adventure in the great white somewhere,

211
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,780
or a love marriage, or not to be in the service of Satan anymore,

212
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:51,480
but the solution at the end always kind of winds up being guys.

213
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,880
In screenwriting terms, the question is, whose story is it?

214
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,280
And in a character-driven film, like most Disney movies for example,

215
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,680
the story is built around the character arc, or the want versus need,

216
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,280
and for more about want versus need, check out the Hercules video.

217
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,380
It's pretty good.

218
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:15,580
In all of the Renaissance Disney movies, what the protagonist wanted was, you know, their teenage whatever dreams.

219
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:21,580
I want so much more than they've got planned.

220
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,680
Sometimes you feel so...

221
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,980
You're just...

222
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,980
Trapped.

223
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:30,780
Love to explore that shore up above.

224
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:36,980
What they needed was to find love and get married, as long as it's not an arranged marriage.

225
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,280
And when you look at Beauty and the Beast, the Beast's arc is a far more central theme to the story.

226
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,680
What he wants is not to be a beast anymore.

227
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:50,280
What he needs is to love someone so much that he puts her needs before not only his, but his entire castle.

228
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,180
Because I love her.

229
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,780
Belle's character is self-actualized at the beginning.

230
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,780
She knows who she is, what she likes.

231
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,780
She doesn't need to change.

232
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:05,980
She just needs a guy who appreciates her, which the Beast does, I guess, because he gives her some books.

233
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:12,480
And personally, I find that little trend of women's self-actualization being defined by what guy she ends up with

234
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,080
way more insidious than whether or not this movie is about Stockholm Syndrome.

235
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:21,880
Really, it brings up less questions of a psychological disorder and more questions of agency as it pertains to narrative,

236
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:30,180
particularly for women, whose narratives usually have them being less active agents so much as being thrown into circumstances which they must then survive.

237
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:39,780
So if we're worried about trying to stop reinforcing this idea that women should or inevitably will end up loving their kidnapper slash captor slash rapist slash whatever,

238
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,880
that thought kind of undermines the point of this narrative.

239
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:50,980
Disney's Beauty and the Beast is a story about basic human decency and how society at large neither rewards it or even necessarily sees it.

240
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,980
And that's a pretty strong narrative, but since it's such a short and simple film,

241
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:01,080
all of this is at the expense of the heroine being allowed a character arc other than learning to like this guy.

242
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,180
See, there are layers to this discussion.

243
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,980
Complexity is even.

244
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:14,880
It can be a story about denying a woman her own self-actualization while at the same time being a touching tale about empathy and forgiveness.

245
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,980
It can be both.

246
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,180
Internet.

247
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:24,180
People who derive this movie by saying it's about Stockholm Syndrome are ignoring that it's actually about the various ways

248
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,880
that decent people get othered by society.

249
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,880
Maurice, presumably the town's only innovator, is considered a weird kook.

250
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,580
Gaston demonstrates that bullies are rewarded and beloved by society so long as they possess a certain set of characteristics.

251
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:43,180
The town's folk worship Gaston and think Belle is a weirdo for not conforming to the expectations foisted upon her by her gender.

252
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,580
What's wrong with her? She's crazy. He's gorgeous.

253
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,180
And they want to kill the Beast because he looks scary despite Belle's protests.

254
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,580
But Stockholm Syndrome, I guess.

255
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,980
Hell, let's armchair diagnose everyone. Everyone has Stockholm Syndrome.

256
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,080
The Genie has Stockholm Syndrome because he's so loyal to his kind master.

257
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,180
After all, Aladdin's not like Jafar. He's one of the nice ones.

258
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:08,080
You know, he'll unslave you after you do him a few favors.

259
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,280
And do all the toys in Toy Story exhibit Stockholm Syndrome for Andy?

260
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,680
Sure. Why not?

261
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,380
Hacky, uninformed insights like this belittle the themes that are there.

262
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,080
Seeing the good in people where they don't see it in themselves.

263
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,080
The way society rewards bullies and superficiality.

264
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,780
The way it others decent people who don't conform to expectations.

265
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,780
How kindness begets kindness.

266
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,880
Your uninformed observation does not make you smarter than the media you consume.

267
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,880
It just means you're not paying attention.

268
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,580
And that is why the whole Stockholm Syndrome thing is stupid and needs to go away.

269
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,580
Yes, yes, I do recognize the irony of me getting hungry people's grills for being smug.

270
00:16:52,080 --> 00:17:06,980
Thanks for watching!
