0	6320	Oh hey, good! It's like everyone's talking about Beauty and the Beast again, which I guess means this hottest of takes is back.
6320	11040	ðŸŽµ
21040	26760	Wow, and you're like about the 26 millionth person to make this hot take.
26760	29680	Yeah, I read that correct article from five years ago, too.
29760	35480	Okay, disclosure of bias, if you will, if you put me into a room with a gun to my head,
35480	41820	I would say that yes, this movie is probably in my top two and a half favorite Disney movies.
41980	46080	It's the only animated film ever nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture,
46080	48480	and this is back when they had only five nominees.
48480	52580	It contains some of the most incredible and nuanced animation in any movie ever,
52580	56980	and all made under a super tight deadline and about half the time it normally takes to make an animated movie,
56980	58980	and with very little faith from the higher-ups.
59180	66880	The original Beauty and the Beast reputation has taken a slight turn in recent years as the target for lazy internet jokes,
66880	73180	and as someone who makes their living making lazy internet jokes, even I'm kind of tired of this whole like,
73180	77680	hey look, I'm smarter than a 90s Disney movie trend.
77680	84080	Like, wow, she falls in love with him despite him being a jerk to her and imprisoning her, like, yeah.
84080	85880	I mean, that's kind of the point.
85880	90680	See, it's like, it's like one of those stories about forgiveness, see?
90680	94780	I understand that sometimes a Disney movie can, can be a little too subtle for y'all.
94780	97980	He's no Monster Gaston, you are!
97980	106480	Now, that said, that does not mean that it is not worth it to explore the possible merit of these lazy internet jokes,
106480	111680	and maybe one day I'll get into the crap they added into the new movie to fix
112180	117180	some of the criticisms that have come down the pike over the last 20 years.
117180	121180	Uh, no, but in the meantime, we're here to ask the question,
121180	123480	Does Belle have Stockholm Syndrome?
124980	125980	No.
125980	129180	Thank you for watching, uh, like, share, and subscribe to my channel.
129180	133780	Thank you, of course, to all my, uh, lovely patrons, I couldn't do this without you.
133780	138780	Oh, you want me to, like, actually talk about the thing.
138880	142880	Okay, well, you know what, first, let's, let's figure out what Stockholm Syndrome even is.
146280	149680	Stockholm Syndrome describes a psychological phenomenon where hostages,
149680	156280	kidnapping victims, and victims of abuse develop intense emotional ties to their captors slash abusers as a survival strategy.
156280	159780	The name refers to an incident in Stockholm, Sweden in 1973,
159780	163080	when four hostages, who had been taken captive by bank robbers,
163080	165980	eventually refused to testify against their captors.
165980	170180	Here are the key components to the development of Stockholm Syndrome.
170180	174180	That the hostage develops positive feelings towards their captor.
174180	179480	There is no previous hostage-captor relationship.
179480	185380	Um, that the hostage has an increasing belief in the humanity of their captor.
185380	190680	That the hostage learns to excuse abusive behaviors of their captor.
190680	198080	And, of course, a refusal by the hostage to accept the support of the authorities.
198080	199080	Hmm.
205680	206780	Okay, but here's the thing.
206780	212880	The aforementioned are just requirements for the development of what could be considered Stockholm Syndrome.
212880	216180	They are not symptoms. Symptoms.
216180	219080	Here are the symptoms.
219080	225180	Number one, a severely uneven power relationship in which the captor dictates what the prisoner can and cannot do.
225180	228180	The castle is your home now, so you can go anywhere you like.
228180	229380	Except the West Wing.
229380	230280	What's in the West Wing?
230280	232080	It's forbidden!
232080	234480	You will join me for dinner.
234480	235780	That's not a request!
238980	241580	Let's put a pin in that one.
241580	242880	We'll come back to that.
242880	247880	Number two, the captive is held under the threat of death or physical injury at the hands of the captor.
249180	250380	You have my word.
250380	251680	Done!
251680	254280	Okay, well, I guess we got that one too.
254280	258680	Wait a minute. Whose idea was it for Belle to stay at the castle anyway?
258680	260180	Take me instead.
260180	261380	You!
261380	268980	Yeah, I mean, she is being held against her will in the same way you're being held against your will if you're in ninth grade trig and you're dying to go home.
268980	270480	But there is a key difference here.
270480	273180	This is not a kidnapper-kidnappy relationship.
273180	277880	She stays in the castle because they make an agreement.
277880	279080	You have my word.
279080	279780	Done!
279780	282380	And point number two here is where the whole argument falls apart.
282380	284780	The captive is held because she made an agreement.
284780	290980	And this isn't even, like, in the fairy tale where she exchanges herself for her dad who is being held under a very clear threat of death.
300880	306580	The Beast just kind of sounds like he's making it up like he goes along, like he's just a kid who has no idea what he's doing.
306580	307880	Would you let him go?
307880	310080	Yes, but...
313880	315680	You must promise to stay here forever.
316880	319380	Um, forever.
319380	323480	There's one point in the movie where the threat of violence does pop up and it's right here.
323480	324480	Stop!
324480	325980	Get out!
325980	326480	No!
328780	331780	Get out!
332180	334480	Which brings us to Stockholm point number three.
334480	339380	Inability to engage in behaviors that may assist in their release or detachment.
339380	342080	See, here's what follows immediately after Beast's little outburst.
343080	343980	Where are you going?
343980	345580	Promise or no promise.
345580	347180	I can't stay here another minute.
347180	350280	Yeah, she'd been in the castle for maybe five hours.
350280	353580	So once the Beast starts throwing tables around, Belle runs away,
353580	358480	even as she leaves mentioning the little verbal contract that had been keeping her there and then dismissing it.
358480	360280	And this brings us back to point number one.
360280	361780	The Beast defines rules.
361780	365780	The castle is your home now, so you can go anywhere you like, except the West Wing.
365780	366680	What's in the West Wing?
366680	367680	It's forbidden!
367680	369480	And then Belle is immediately like,
369480	372780	Tra-la-la-la-la, no.
372780	375680	If Stockholm syndrome is a condition displayed by the victim,
375680	381280	then Belle does not apply because she does not respect the rules set up for her from basically the word go.
381280	383780	Ah, so that's the West Wing.
383780	384580	Point number four.
384580	386280	And then after X amount of violence,
386280	390880	the smallest act of kindness on the part of the captor, or even the absence of violence,
390880	393480	elicits sympathetic feelings from the captive.
393480	396780	This one, I think, is the symptom that people are most familiar with,
396780	399180	and therefore the one that tends to trip people up.
399180	405580	It really bugs me when people file this movie into the I can fix him category.
405580	411580	No rules, no punishments, and no more secrets.
411580	412880	I can do that.
412880	416480	Because Belle never sets out to fix the Beast. Ever.
416480	419880	I mean, yeah, she's way more reasonable than anyone in that situation might be expected to be,
419880	423480	but she basically responds to his absence of dickery.
423480	426980	Now, this is not the case in the Beauty and the Beast direct-to-video sequels.
426980	428380	Come on!
428380	429280	Ooh, boy.
429280	431480	You said you'd never leave.
431480	433680	I just wanted to make you happy.
436880	439080	But in the original movie, i.e. The Thing That Matters,
439080	443780	her goal is never at any point, either stated or unstated, to make the Beast into another person.
443780	445980	If he's a jerk, she responds in kind.
445980	447480	Will you come down to dinner?
447480	448980	No.
448980	451080	If he's nice, she responds in kind.
451080	456480	She treats him fairly, and he decides to improve himself of his own volition out of respect and fondness for her.
456480	458780	And eventually, she responds by being like,
458780	461480	eh, I guess I wouldn't kick him out of bed.
461480	464480	The archetypal Stockholm Syndrome setting is more like, you know,
464480	470080	your captor throws a scrap of bread at you after having starved you for weeks on end,
470080	474080	you know, not necessarily saved you from a pack of ravenous wolves.
474080	477080	That said, I'm not convinced that the Beast didn't, like,
477080	479680	slip those wolves a twenty under the table.
479680	480080	Anyway.
480080	482880	So after the Beast gets in a fight with some wolves, falls down,
482880	485980	Belle recognizes that he put himself in harm's way to save her,
485980	488880	and for whatever reason that is implied by this expression here,
488880	490580	it's up to you as a viewer,
490580	493580	she decides to keep her end of the bargain and stay with him.
493580	496580	Which leads us to the scene and point number five.
496580	498680	A self-preservation instinct on the part of the prisoner,
498680	502580	the victim learns to avoid triggers that will set off the captor.
502580	505580	Belle never does this, even from the very beginning.
505580	506580	That hurts!
506580	508580	If you'd hold still, it wouldn't hurt as much.
508580	510980	Well, if you hadn't have run away, this wouldn't have happened.
510980	513580	If you hadn't frightened me, I wouldn't have run away.
513580	515380	And that's part of what makes this scene so great.
515380	519280	She doesn't put up with his shit, but she does give credit where credit is due.
519280	523280	And that leaves the door open for him to stop being such a dickhead.
523280	528380	By the way, thank you for saving my life.
528380	531580	Point number six, negative feelings by the victim toward family, friends,
531580	535080	or authorities trying to rescue or support the victim.
535080	538980	If only I could see my father again, just for a moment.
538980	541680	I miss him so much.
541680	542680	Nope.
542680	547180	Papa! No, he's sick.
547180	550780	He may be dying and he's all alone.
550780	554380	At this point in the film, the Beast is caught between keeping Belle here
554380	560180	and possibly saving his own humanity, or letting her go and putting her needs before his.
560180	564080	And the second he says she could peace out to go help her dad, she's like, okay, bye!
564080	566580	Thank you for understanding how much he needs me.
566580	569080	That feeling where you think you got this chick to like you,
569080	573380	but then it turns out you're a literal f***ing monster holding her as a hostage.
573380	575480	Best sound.
575480	577380	And if it weren't for the mob of angry villagers,
577380	580880	we don't have any indication as to whether or not Belle would have ever come back.
580880	584380	I mean, she might have, you know, to return this dish she stole, but you know.
584380	587180	But the most important facet that people miss about Stockholm Syndrome
587180	590180	is that it is not a diagnosable mental disorder.
590180	591980	It is not on the DSM.
591980	595180	Stockholm Syndrome is considered a contested illness,
595180	599880	as a large portion of the psychiatric and law enforcement community do not think it is a thing.
599880	602880	So honestly, this entire conversation is almost rendered moot
602880	609880	because Stockholm Syndrome kind of belongs more in the category of debunked pseudoscience
609880	613580	than actual, studyable, psychological conditions.
613580	617580	Or at the very least, it's in the category of more research needed.
617580	622880	Making Beauty and the Beast about Stockholm Syndrome is kind of missing the forest for the trees.
622880	627980	You know, if you basically only had a passing pop culture knowledge of either forest or trees.
627980	634480	Beauty and the Beast is a story about, you know, friendship and forgiveness, that sort of thing.
634480	639380	And the romantic aspect is played down to near non-existence.
639380	641380	I'm on the fence as to how romantic it even is.
641380	644880	Just look at the look on her face when he turns back into a man.
644880	650380	Even for a Disney movie, this is a pretty sexless relationship, at least from Belle's side of things.
650380	654380	He's my friend. He's my friend.
654380	655980	I mean, I do enjoy beasts.
655980	658580	Hey, look, girl, I did it, face!
658580	659280	Aww.
661680	665280	So even ignoring the fact that most law enforcement and mental health professionals
665280	669080	do not think that Stockholm Syndrome is actually even a thing,
669080	673480	this movie is not a good example of... thing.
673480	676380	Does not mean that this term does not necessarily apply,
676380	679980	just means that this term is not a good one.
679980	680980	Stop using it.
680980	687880	But while we're here, Beauty and the Beast is the story of a young girl who wants
687880	692380	adventure in the great white somewhere
692380	696880	but then learns that getting married to a rich guy who held you prisoner for a while is pretty good.
696880	701280	Actually, no, let's reframe that.
701280	706080	Beauty and the Beast is a story of two men who view the same woman as a shiny object to be controlled,
706080	710280	and where one of them learns to see her humanity, the other one falls to his death.
710780	714680	Well, that's a more... well, I guess let's say it's a more optimistic way of framing it,
714680	720280	because the story, regardless of how it's set up, it's not really Belle's story.
720280	721880	It's the Beast.
721880	726180	He's the one who learns, he's the one who changes, he's the one with a character arc,
726180	729880	and it's much stronger if you look at it that way because Belle's arc is...
729880	732480	well, I guess she does learn to wear other dresses.
732480	736380	Compare the Disney movie to the original fairy tale where the arc is all Beauty's.
736480	740980	The Beast, we are told, already has a heart of gold, and we're gonna ignore the whole dad rose thing.
740980	743980	Beauty just needs to see that he has a good heart,
743980	748980	so the arc is hers all along, and learning to see Beauty in something that is superficially ugly.
748980	753980	In the original fairy tale, the arc is Beauty's, where in the Disney movie, it all belongs to the Beast.
753980	756680	This is a trend we see in a lot of Renaissance Disney.
756680	763080	The heroine states a want, be it, you know, legs, or adventure in the great white somewhere,
763080	766780	or a love marriage, or not to be in the service of Satan anymore,
766780	771480	but the solution at the end always kind of winds up being guys.
771480	774880	In screenwriting terms, the question is, whose story is it?
774880	780280	And in a character-driven film, like most Disney movies for example,
780280	784680	the story is built around the character arc, or the want versus need,
784680	789280	and for more about want versus need, check out the Hercules video.
789280	790380	It's pretty good.
790380	795580	In all of the Renaissance Disney movies, what the protagonist wanted was, you know, their teenage whatever dreams.
795580	801580	I want so much more than they've got planned.
801580	802680	Sometimes you feel so...
802680	803980	You're just...
803980	804980	Trapped.
804980	810780	Love to explore that shore up above.
810780	816980	What they needed was to find love and get married, as long as it's not an arranged marriage.
816980	821280	And when you look at Beauty and the Beast, the Beast's arc is a far more central theme to the story.
821280	823680	What he wants is not to be a beast anymore.
823680	830280	What he needs is to love someone so much that he puts her needs before not only his, but his entire castle.
830280	833180	Because I love her.
833180	835780	Belle's character is self-actualized at the beginning.
835780	837780	She knows who she is, what she likes.
837780	839780	She doesn't need to change.
839780	845980	She just needs a guy who appreciates her, which the Beast does, I guess, because he gives her some books.
845980	852480	And personally, I find that little trend of women's self-actualization being defined by what guy she ends up with
852480	856080	way more insidious than whether or not this movie is about Stockholm Syndrome.
856080	861880	Really, it brings up less questions of a psychological disorder and more questions of agency as it pertains to narrative,
861880	870180	particularly for women, whose narratives usually have them being less active agents so much as being thrown into circumstances which they must then survive.
870180	879780	So if we're worried about trying to stop reinforcing this idea that women should or inevitably will end up loving their kidnapper slash captor slash rapist slash whatever,
879780	882880	that thought kind of undermines the point of this narrative.
882880	890980	Disney's Beauty and the Beast is a story about basic human decency and how society at large neither rewards it or even necessarily sees it.
890980	894980	And that's a pretty strong narrative, but since it's such a short and simple film,
894980	901080	all of this is at the expense of the heroine being allowed a character arc other than learning to like this guy.
901080	904180	See, there are layers to this discussion.
904180	905980	Complexity is even.
905980	914880	It can be a story about denying a woman her own self-actualization while at the same time being a touching tale about empathy and forgiveness.
914880	917980	It can be both.
917980	919180	Internet.
919180	924180	People who derive this movie by saying it's about Stockholm Syndrome are ignoring that it's actually about the various ways
924180	926880	that decent people get othered by society.
926880	930880	Maurice, presumably the town's only innovator, is considered a weird kook.
930880	936580	Gaston demonstrates that bullies are rewarded and beloved by society so long as they possess a certain set of characteristics.
936580	943180	The town's folk worship Gaston and think Belle is a weirdo for not conforming to the expectations foisted upon her by her gender.
943180	946580	What's wrong with her? She's crazy. He's gorgeous.
946580	950180	And they want to kill the Beast because he looks scary despite Belle's protests.
950180	953580	But Stockholm Syndrome, I guess.
953580	956980	Hell, let's armchair diagnose everyone. Everyone has Stockholm Syndrome.
956980	961080	The Genie has Stockholm Syndrome because he's so loyal to his kind master.
961080	964180	After all, Aladdin's not like Jafar. He's one of the nice ones.
964180	968080	You know, he'll unslave you after you do him a few favors.
968080	971280	And do all the toys in Toy Story exhibit Stockholm Syndrome for Andy?
971280	972680	Sure. Why not?
972680	976380	Hacky, uninformed insights like this belittle the themes that are there.
976380	979080	Seeing the good in people where they don't see it in themselves.
979080	982080	The way society rewards bullies and superficiality.
982080	985780	The way it others decent people who don't conform to expectations.
985780	987780	How kindness begets kindness.
