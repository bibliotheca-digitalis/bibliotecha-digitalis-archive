00:00.000 --> 00:06.320
Oh hey, good! It's like everyone's talking about Beauty and the Beast again, which I guess means this hottest of takes is back.

00:06.320 --> 00:11.040
🎵

00:21.040 --> 00:26.760
Wow, and you're like about the 26 millionth person to make this hot take.

00:26.760 --> 00:29.680
Yeah, I read that correct article from five years ago, too.

00:29.760 --> 00:35.480
Okay, disclosure of bias, if you will, if you put me into a room with a gun to my head,

00:35.480 --> 00:41.820
I would say that yes, this movie is probably in my top two and a half favorite Disney movies.

00:41.980 --> 00:46.080
It's the only animated film ever nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture,

00:46.080 --> 00:48.480
and this is back when they had only five nominees.

00:48.480 --> 00:52.580
It contains some of the most incredible and nuanced animation in any movie ever,

00:52.580 --> 00:56.980
and all made under a super tight deadline and about half the time it normally takes to make an animated movie,

00:56.980 --> 00:58.980
and with very little faith from the higher-ups.

00:59.180 --> 01:06.880
The original Beauty and the Beast reputation has taken a slight turn in recent years as the target for lazy internet jokes,

01:06.880 --> 01:13.180
and as someone who makes their living making lazy internet jokes, even I'm kind of tired of this whole like,

01:13.180 --> 01:17.680
hey look, I'm smarter than a 90s Disney movie trend.

01:17.680 --> 01:24.080
Like, wow, she falls in love with him despite him being a jerk to her and imprisoning her, like, yeah.

01:24.080 --> 01:25.880
I mean, that's kind of the point.

01:25.880 --> 01:30.680
See, it's like, it's like one of those stories about forgiveness, see?

01:30.680 --> 01:34.780
I understand that sometimes a Disney movie can, can be a little too subtle for y'all.

01:34.780 --> 01:37.980
He's no Monster Gaston, you are!

01:37.980 --> 01:46.480
Now, that said, that does not mean that it is not worth it to explore the possible merit of these lazy internet jokes,

01:46.480 --> 01:51.680
and maybe one day I'll get into the crap they added into the new movie to fix

01:52.180 --> 01:57.180
some of the criticisms that have come down the pike over the last 20 years.

01:57.180 --> 02:01.180
Uh, no, but in the meantime, we're here to ask the question,

02:01.180 --> 02:03.480
Does Belle have Stockholm Syndrome?

02:04.980 --> 02:05.980
No.

02:05.980 --> 02:09.180
Thank you for watching, uh, like, share, and subscribe to my channel.

02:09.180 --> 02:13.780
Thank you, of course, to all my, uh, lovely patrons, I couldn't do this without you.

02:13.780 --> 02:18.780
Oh, you want me to, like, actually talk about the thing.

02:18.880 --> 02:22.880
Okay, well, you know what, first, let's, let's figure out what Stockholm Syndrome even is.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.680
Stockholm Syndrome describes a psychological phenomenon where hostages,

02:29.680 --> 02:36.280
kidnapping victims, and victims of abuse develop intense emotional ties to their captors slash abusers as a survival strategy.

02:36.280 --> 02:39.780
The name refers to an incident in Stockholm, Sweden in 1973,

02:39.780 --> 02:43.080
when four hostages, who had been taken captive by bank robbers,

02:43.080 --> 02:45.980
eventually refused to testify against their captors.

02:45.980 --> 02:50.180
Here are the key components to the development of Stockholm Syndrome.

02:50.180 --> 02:54.180
That the hostage develops positive feelings towards their captor.

02:54.180 --> 02:59.480
There is no previous hostage-captor relationship.

02:59.480 --> 03:05.380
Um, that the hostage has an increasing belief in the humanity of their captor.

03:05.380 --> 03:10.680
That the hostage learns to excuse abusive behaviors of their captor.

03:10.680 --> 03:18.080
And, of course, a refusal by the hostage to accept the support of the authorities.

03:18.080 --> 03:19.080
Hmm.

03:25.680 --> 03:26.780
Okay, but here's the thing.

03:26.780 --> 03:32.880
The aforementioned are just requirements for the development of what could be considered Stockholm Syndrome.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.180
They are not symptoms. Symptoms.

03:36.180 --> 03:39.080
Here are the symptoms.

03:39.080 --> 03:45.180
Number one, a severely uneven power relationship in which the captor dictates what the prisoner can and cannot do.

03:45.180 --> 03:48.180
The castle is your home now, so you can go anywhere you like.

03:48.180 --> 03:49.380
Except the West Wing.

03:49.380 --> 03:50.280
What's in the West Wing?

03:50.280 --> 03:52.080
It's forbidden!

03:52.080 --> 03:54.480
You will join me for dinner.

03:54.480 --> 03:55.780
That's not a request!

03:58.980 --> 04:01.580
Let's put a pin in that one.

04:01.580 --> 04:02.880
We'll come back to that.

04:02.880 --> 04:07.880
Number two, the captive is held under the threat of death or physical injury at the hands of the captor.

04:09.180 --> 04:10.380
You have my word.

04:10.380 --> 04:11.680
Done!

04:11.680 --> 04:14.280
Okay, well, I guess we got that one too.

04:14.280 --> 04:18.680
Wait a minute. Whose idea was it for Belle to stay at the castle anyway?

04:18.680 --> 04:20.180
Take me instead.

04:20.180 --> 04:21.380
You!

04:21.380 --> 04:28.980
Yeah, I mean, she is being held against her will in the same way you're being held against your will if you're in ninth grade trig and you're dying to go home.

04:28.980 --> 04:30.480
But there is a key difference here.

04:30.480 --> 04:33.180
This is not a kidnapper-kidnappy relationship.

04:33.180 --> 04:37.880
She stays in the castle because they make an agreement.

04:37.880 --> 04:39.080
You have my word.

04:39.080 --> 04:39.780
Done!

04:39.780 --> 04:42.380
And point number two here is where the whole argument falls apart.

04:42.380 --> 04:44.780
The captive is held because she made an agreement.

04:44.780 --> 04:50.980
And this isn't even, like, in the fairy tale where she exchanges herself for her dad who is being held under a very clear threat of death.

05:00.880 --> 05:06.580
The Beast just kind of sounds like he's making it up like he goes along, like he's just a kid who has no idea what he's doing.

05:06.580 --> 05:07.880
Would you let him go?

05:07.880 --> 05:10.080
Yes, but...

05:13.880 --> 05:15.680
You must promise to stay here forever.

05:16.880 --> 05:19.380
Um, forever.

05:19.380 --> 05:23.480
There's one point in the movie where the threat of violence does pop up and it's right here.

05:23.480 --> 05:24.480
Stop!

05:24.480 --> 05:25.980
Get out!

05:25.980 --> 05:26.480
No!

05:28.780 --> 05:31.780
Get out!

05:32.180 --> 05:34.480
Which brings us to Stockholm point number three.

05:34.480 --> 05:39.380
Inability to engage in behaviors that may assist in their release or detachment.

05:39.380 --> 05:42.080
See, here's what follows immediately after Beast's little outburst.

05:43.080 --> 05:43.980
Where are you going?

05:43.980 --> 05:45.580
Promise or no promise.

05:45.580 --> 05:47.180
I can't stay here another minute.

05:47.180 --> 05:50.280
Yeah, she'd been in the castle for maybe five hours.

05:50.280 --> 05:53.580
So once the Beast starts throwing tables around, Belle runs away,

05:53.580 --> 05:58.480
even as she leaves mentioning the little verbal contract that had been keeping her there and then dismissing it.

05:58.480 --> 06:00.280
And this brings us back to point number one.

06:00.280 --> 06:01.780
The Beast defines rules.

06:01.780 --> 06:05.780
The castle is your home now, so you can go anywhere you like, except the West Wing.

06:05.780 --> 06:06.680
What's in the West Wing?

06:06.680 --> 06:07.680
It's forbidden!

06:07.680 --> 06:09.480
And then Belle is immediately like,

06:09.480 --> 06:12.780
Tra-la-la-la-la, no.

06:12.780 --> 06:15.680
If Stockholm syndrome is a condition displayed by the victim,

06:15.680 --> 06:21.280
then Belle does not apply because she does not respect the rules set up for her from basically the word go.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.780
Ah, so that's the West Wing.

06:23.780 --> 06:24.580
Point number four.

06:24.580 --> 06:26.280
And then after X amount of violence,

06:26.280 --> 06:30.880
the smallest act of kindness on the part of the captor, or even the absence of violence,

06:30.880 --> 06:33.480
elicits sympathetic feelings from the captive.

06:33.480 --> 06:36.780
This one, I think, is the symptom that people are most familiar with,

06:36.780 --> 06:39.180
and therefore the one that tends to trip people up.

06:39.180 --> 06:45.580
It really bugs me when people file this movie into the I can fix him category.

06:45.580 --> 06:51.580
No rules, no punishments, and no more secrets.

06:51.580 --> 06:52.880
I can do that.

06:52.880 --> 06:56.480
Because Belle never sets out to fix the Beast. Ever.

06:56.480 --> 06:59.880
I mean, yeah, she's way more reasonable than anyone in that situation might be expected to be,

06:59.880 --> 07:03.480
but she basically responds to his absence of dickery.

07:03.480 --> 07:06.980
Now, this is not the case in the Beauty and the Beast direct-to-video sequels.

07:06.980 --> 07:08.380
Come on!

07:08.380 --> 07:09.280
Ooh, boy.

07:09.280 --> 07:11.480
You said you'd never leave.

07:11.480 --> 07:13.680
I just wanted to make you happy.

07:16.880 --> 07:19.080
But in the original movie, i.e. The Thing That Matters,

07:19.080 --> 07:23.780
her goal is never at any point, either stated or unstated, to make the Beast into another person.

07:23.780 --> 07:25.980
If he's a jerk, she responds in kind.

07:25.980 --> 07:27.480
Will you come down to dinner?

07:27.480 --> 07:28.980
No.

07:28.980 --> 07:31.080
If he's nice, she responds in kind.

07:31.080 --> 07:36.480
She treats him fairly, and he decides to improve himself of his own volition out of respect and fondness for her.

07:36.480 --> 07:38.780
And eventually, she responds by being like,

07:38.780 --> 07:41.480
eh, I guess I wouldn't kick him out of bed.

07:41.480 --> 07:44.480
The archetypal Stockholm Syndrome setting is more like, you know,

07:44.480 --> 07:50.080
your captor throws a scrap of bread at you after having starved you for weeks on end,

07:50.080 --> 07:54.080
you know, not necessarily saved you from a pack of ravenous wolves.

07:54.080 --> 07:57.080
That said, I'm not convinced that the Beast didn't, like,

07:57.080 --> 07:59.680
slip those wolves a twenty under the table.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.080
Anyway.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.880
So after the Beast gets in a fight with some wolves, falls down,

08:02.880 --> 08:05.980
Belle recognizes that he put himself in harm's way to save her,

08:05.980 --> 08:08.880
and for whatever reason that is implied by this expression here,

08:08.880 --> 08:10.580
it's up to you as a viewer,

08:10.580 --> 08:13.580
she decides to keep her end of the bargain and stay with him.

08:13.580 --> 08:16.580
Which leads us to the scene and point number five.

08:16.580 --> 08:18.680
A self-preservation instinct on the part of the prisoner,

08:18.680 --> 08:22.580
the victim learns to avoid triggers that will set off the captor.

08:22.580 --> 08:25.580
Belle never does this, even from the very beginning.

08:25.580 --> 08:26.580
That hurts!

08:26.580 --> 08:28.580
If you'd hold still, it wouldn't hurt as much.

08:28.580 --> 08:30.980
Well, if you hadn't have run away, this wouldn't have happened.

08:30.980 --> 08:33.580
If you hadn't frightened me, I wouldn't have run away.

08:33.580 --> 08:35.380
And that's part of what makes this scene so great.

08:35.380 --> 08:39.280
She doesn't put up with his shit, but she does give credit where credit is due.

08:39.280 --> 08:43.280
And that leaves the door open for him to stop being such a dickhead.

08:43.280 --> 08:48.380
By the way, thank you for saving my life.

08:48.380 --> 08:51.580
Point number six, negative feelings by the victim toward family, friends,

08:51.580 --> 08:55.080
or authorities trying to rescue or support the victim.

08:55.080 --> 08:58.980
If only I could see my father again, just for a moment.

08:58.980 --> 09:01.680
I miss him so much.

09:01.680 --> 09:02.680
Nope.

09:02.680 --> 09:07.180
Papa! No, he's sick.

09:07.180 --> 09:10.780
He may be dying and he's all alone.

09:10.780 --> 09:14.380
At this point in the film, the Beast is caught between keeping Belle here

09:14.380 --> 09:20.180
and possibly saving his own humanity, or letting her go and putting her needs before his.

09:20.180 --> 09:24.080
And the second he says she could peace out to go help her dad, she's like, okay, bye!

09:24.080 --> 09:26.580
Thank you for understanding how much he needs me.

09:26.580 --> 09:29.080
That feeling where you think you got this chick to like you,

09:29.080 --> 09:33.380
but then it turns out you're a literal f***ing monster holding her as a hostage.

09:33.380 --> 09:35.480
Best sound.

09:35.480 --> 09:37.380
And if it weren't for the mob of angry villagers,

09:37.380 --> 09:40.880
we don't have any indication as to whether or not Belle would have ever come back.

09:40.880 --> 09:44.380
I mean, she might have, you know, to return this dish she stole, but you know.

09:44.380 --> 09:47.180
But the most important facet that people miss about Stockholm Syndrome

09:47.180 --> 09:50.180
is that it is not a diagnosable mental disorder.

09:50.180 --> 09:51.980
It is not on the DSM.

09:51.980 --> 09:55.180
Stockholm Syndrome is considered a contested illness,

09:55.180 --> 09:59.880
as a large portion of the psychiatric and law enforcement community do not think it is a thing.

09:59.880 --> 10:02.880
So honestly, this entire conversation is almost rendered moot

10:02.880 --> 10:09.880
because Stockholm Syndrome kind of belongs more in the category of debunked pseudoscience

10:09.880 --> 10:13.580
than actual, studyable, psychological conditions.

10:13.580 --> 10:17.580
Or at the very least, it's in the category of more research needed.

10:17.580 --> 10:22.880
Making Beauty and the Beast about Stockholm Syndrome is kind of missing the forest for the trees.

10:22.880 --> 10:27.980
You know, if you basically only had a passing pop culture knowledge of either forest or trees.

10:27.980 --> 10:34.480
Beauty and the Beast is a story about, you know, friendship and forgiveness, that sort of thing.

10:34.480 --> 10:39.380
And the romantic aspect is played down to near non-existence.

10:39.380 --> 10:41.380
I'm on the fence as to how romantic it even is.

10:41.380 --> 10:44.880
Just look at the look on her face when he turns back into a man.

10:44.880 --> 10:50.380
Even for a Disney movie, this is a pretty sexless relationship, at least from Belle's side of things.

10:50.380 --> 10:54.380
He's my friend. He's my friend.

10:54.380 --> 10:55.980
I mean, I do enjoy beasts.

10:55.980 --> 10:58.580
Hey, look, girl, I did it, face!

10:58.580 --> 10:59.280
Aww.

11:01.680 --> 11:05.280
So even ignoring the fact that most law enforcement and mental health professionals

11:05.280 --> 11:09.080
do not think that Stockholm Syndrome is actually even a thing,

11:09.080 --> 11:13.480
this movie is not a good example of... thing.

11:13.480 --> 11:16.380
Does not mean that this term does not necessarily apply,

11:16.380 --> 11:19.980
just means that this term is not a good one.

11:19.980 --> 11:20.980
Stop using it.

11:20.980 --> 11:27.880
But while we're here, Beauty and the Beast is the story of a young girl who wants

11:27.880 --> 11:32.380
adventure in the great white somewhere

11:32.380 --> 11:36.880
but then learns that getting married to a rich guy who held you prisoner for a while is pretty good.

11:36.880 --> 11:41.280
Actually, no, let's reframe that.

11:41.280 --> 11:46.080
Beauty and the Beast is a story of two men who view the same woman as a shiny object to be controlled,

11:46.080 --> 11:50.280
and where one of them learns to see her humanity, the other one falls to his death.

11:50.780 --> 11:54.680
Well, that's a more... well, I guess let's say it's a more optimistic way of framing it,

11:54.680 --> 12:00.280
because the story, regardless of how it's set up, it's not really Belle's story.

12:00.280 --> 12:01.880
It's the Beast.

12:01.880 --> 12:06.180
He's the one who learns, he's the one who changes, he's the one with a character arc,

12:06.180 --> 12:09.880
and it's much stronger if you look at it that way because Belle's arc is...

12:09.880 --> 12:12.480
well, I guess she does learn to wear other dresses.

12:12.480 --> 12:16.380
Compare the Disney movie to the original fairy tale where the arc is all Beauty's.

12:16.480 --> 12:20.980
The Beast, we are told, already has a heart of gold, and we're gonna ignore the whole dad rose thing.

12:20.980 --> 12:23.980
Beauty just needs to see that he has a good heart,

12:23.980 --> 12:28.980
so the arc is hers all along, and learning to see Beauty in something that is superficially ugly.

12:28.980 --> 12:33.980
In the original fairy tale, the arc is Beauty's, where in the Disney movie, it all belongs to the Beast.

12:33.980 --> 12:36.680
This is a trend we see in a lot of Renaissance Disney.

12:36.680 --> 12:43.080
The heroine states a want, be it, you know, legs, or adventure in the great white somewhere,

12:43.080 --> 12:46.780
or a love marriage, or not to be in the service of Satan anymore,

12:46.780 --> 12:51.480
but the solution at the end always kind of winds up being guys.

12:51.480 --> 12:54.880
In screenwriting terms, the question is, whose story is it?

12:54.880 --> 13:00.280
And in a character-driven film, like most Disney movies for example,

13:00.280 --> 13:04.680
the story is built around the character arc, or the want versus need,

13:04.680 --> 13:09.280
and for more about want versus need, check out the Hercules video.

13:09.280 --> 13:10.380
It's pretty good.

13:10.380 --> 13:15.580
In all of the Renaissance Disney movies, what the protagonist wanted was, you know, their teenage whatever dreams.

13:15.580 --> 13:21.580
I want so much more than they've got planned.

13:21.580 --> 13:22.680
Sometimes you feel so...

13:22.680 --> 13:23.980
You're just...

13:23.980 --> 13:24.980
Trapped.

13:24.980 --> 13:30.780
Love to explore that shore up above.

13:30.780 --> 13:36.980
What they needed was to find love and get married, as long as it's not an arranged marriage.

13:36.980 --> 13:41.280
And when you look at Beauty and the Beast, the Beast's arc is a far more central theme to the story.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.680
What he wants is not to be a beast anymore.

13:43.680 --> 13:50.280
What he needs is to love someone so much that he puts her needs before not only his, but his entire castle.

13:50.280 --> 13:53.180
Because I love her.

13:53.180 --> 13:55.780
Belle's character is self-actualized at the beginning.

13:55.780 --> 13:57.780
She knows who she is, what she likes.

13:57.780 --> 13:59.780
She doesn't need to change.

13:59.780 --> 14:05.980
She just needs a guy who appreciates her, which the Beast does, I guess, because he gives her some books.

14:05.980 --> 14:12.480
And personally, I find that little trend of women's self-actualization being defined by what guy she ends up with

14:12.480 --> 14:16.080
way more insidious than whether or not this movie is about Stockholm Syndrome.

14:16.080 --> 14:21.880
Really, it brings up less questions of a psychological disorder and more questions of agency as it pertains to narrative,

14:21.880 --> 14:30.180
particularly for women, whose narratives usually have them being less active agents so much as being thrown into circumstances which they must then survive.

14:30.180 --> 14:39.780
So if we're worried about trying to stop reinforcing this idea that women should or inevitably will end up loving their kidnapper slash captor slash rapist slash whatever,

14:39.780 --> 14:42.880
that thought kind of undermines the point of this narrative.

14:42.880 --> 14:50.980
Disney's Beauty and the Beast is a story about basic human decency and how society at large neither rewards it or even necessarily sees it.

14:50.980 --> 14:54.980
And that's a pretty strong narrative, but since it's such a short and simple film,

14:54.980 --> 15:01.080
all of this is at the expense of the heroine being allowed a character arc other than learning to like this guy.

15:01.080 --> 15:04.180
See, there are layers to this discussion.

15:04.180 --> 15:05.980
Complexity is even.

15:05.980 --> 15:14.880
It can be a story about denying a woman her own self-actualization while at the same time being a touching tale about empathy and forgiveness.

15:14.880 --> 15:17.980
It can be both.

15:17.980 --> 15:19.180
Internet.

15:19.180 --> 15:24.180
People who derive this movie by saying it's about Stockholm Syndrome are ignoring that it's actually about the various ways

15:24.180 --> 15:26.880
that decent people get othered by society.

15:26.880 --> 15:30.880
Maurice, presumably the town's only innovator, is considered a weird kook.

15:30.880 --> 15:36.580
Gaston demonstrates that bullies are rewarded and beloved by society so long as they possess a certain set of characteristics.

15:36.580 --> 15:43.180
The town's folk worship Gaston and think Belle is a weirdo for not conforming to the expectations foisted upon her by her gender.

15:43.180 --> 15:46.580
What's wrong with her? She's crazy. He's gorgeous.

15:46.580 --> 15:50.180
And they want to kill the Beast because he looks scary despite Belle's protests.

15:50.180 --> 15:53.580
But Stockholm Syndrome, I guess.

15:53.580 --> 15:56.980
Hell, let's armchair diagnose everyone. Everyone has Stockholm Syndrome.

15:56.980 --> 16:01.080
The Genie has Stockholm Syndrome because he's so loyal to his kind master.

16:01.080 --> 16:04.180
After all, Aladdin's not like Jafar. He's one of the nice ones.

16:04.180 --> 16:08.080
You know, he'll unslave you after you do him a few favors.

16:08.080 --> 16:11.280
And do all the toys in Toy Story exhibit Stockholm Syndrome for Andy?

16:11.280 --> 16:12.680
Sure. Why not?

16:12.680 --> 16:16.380
Hacky, uninformed insights like this belittle the themes that are there.

16:16.380 --> 16:19.080
Seeing the good in people where they don't see it in themselves.

16:19.080 --> 16:22.080
The way society rewards bullies and superficiality.

16:22.080 --> 16:25.780
The way it others decent people who don't conform to expectations.

16:25.780 --> 16:27.780
How kindness begets kindness.

16:27.780 --> 16:31.880
Your uninformed observation does not make you smarter than the media you consume.

16:31.880 --> 16:33.880
It just means you're not paying attention.

16:33.880 --> 16:38.580
And that is why the whole Stockholm Syndrome thing is stupid and needs to go away.

16:38.580 --> 16:42.580
Yes, yes, I do recognize the irony of me getting hungry people's grills for being smug.

16:52.080 --> 17:06.980
Thanks for watching!
