0	3500	So, new territory. In many regards.
3500	7000	So this month's idea was to look at fictional depictions of historical figures.
7000	13000	So when presented with these three options, the vote went to, um, Queen Elizabeth I.
14500	15500	I'm surprised, too.
15500	18000	Have a care with my name. You will wear it out.
18000	20500	Certainly one of the more iconic historical monarchs,
20500	24500	and probably the most famous of all female monarchs in Western history,
24500	27500	she was also more likely to pop up in narrative fiction.
27500	31000	She led England into an unprecedented period of wealth and stability,
31000	33500	something, something, golden age, yada yada.
33500	38500	But when we're fictionalizing someone who was famously the Virgin Queen,
38500	42500	most of that fictionalizing will center around one thing.
42500	46500	Come on. We know she's f***ing someone.
46500	49000	Who was she really shtupping?
49000	52500	You know, because it had to be someone, right?
52500	56500	Was it this guy? Or maybe this guy?
56500	58500	Or maybe him?
60000	61000	Why not?
61000	64500	If it's a female historical figure, that's probably going to be the common thread.
64500	70000	Anyway, like George Washington, Queenie has a ton of media to plow through.
70000	72500	Some more historical, some not.
72500	75000	So I'm going to focus on more recent versions,
75000	79000	starting with the more biopic-y side that are trying to be more historically accurate,
79000	82000	and then moving towards the more squirrelly.
82000	83500	This should be interesting.
84000	88000	Actual human who actually existed, Queen Elizabeth I.
97000	101000	Elizabeth I should never have been queen.
101000	102500	Well, I can scratch that.
102500	107500	It's more like she had to blow through a whole host of royals who were in line ahead of her
107500	110500	before she was able to become queen.
110500	115000	King Henry VIII had a big obsession with producing a male heir, you know, more than usual,
115000	119000	which led to him blowing through six wives in order to get his precious male heir,
119000	121000	who died at the age of 15,
121000	124500	leaving him with his two half-sisters to duke it out over the throne.
124500	130000	Elizabeth was declared a bastard when her mother, Anne Boleyn, was executed for alleged adultery.
130000	133500	But then some years later, both she and her older half-sister, Mary,
133500	137000	were restored to the line of succession after King Henry mellowed a bit.
137000	141500	So, after Henry VIII died, Elizabeth was in line behind her brother, Edward,
141500	145000	her sister, Mary, and one random Protestant cousin
145000	148500	whom the young, dying Edward declared his successor on his deathbed
148500	150500	because she was Protestant and Mary was Catholic,
150500	154500	and she made it about nine days before being executed.
156000	158000	Hey, Game of Thrones was inspired by something.
158000	163500	After Bloody Mary died of what was probably ovarian cancer without an heir,
163500	166500	Elizabeth became queen at the age of 25.
166500	171500	England then flourished under her absolute monarchy and the Tudor dynasty ended.
171500	177500	And she was also a patron of Shakespeare, so she's generally remembered pretty favorably.
177500	179500	You know, by the English, anyway.
179500	182000	Flash forward to the era of film and television.
182000	184500	Elizabeth's portrayals are generally sympathetic,
184500	188000	but that also depends on what part of her life we are focusing on
188000	190500	or how we feel about Mary, Queen of Scots,
190500	193500	whom Elizabeth had executed for an alleged coup against her.
193500	198000	In the 19th and early 20th centuries, there were more dramas about Mary than about Elizabeth,
198000	202500	but more recently, the focus and sympathy has shifted back Elizabeth's words.
202500	204500	Anyway, so.
204500	206500	Virgin Queen.
206500	208500	Really now?
210500	213500	There's always been speculation on who, if anyone,
213500	217500	Queen Elizabeth was doing her royal duty with while she was on the throne,
217500	219500	included but not limited to
219500	223500	Sir Robert Dudley, Earl of...
223500	228500	Robert Devereaux, Earl of Essex, whom she would later have executed for treason,
228500	234500	the Duke of Anjou, Thomas Heneage, Christopher Hatton, even Sir Walter Raleigh.
234500	236500	That was the fixation back in the day,
236500	240500	it's still more or less the fixation now with her portrayals,
240500	242500	and it varies in some curious ways.
242500	245500	And the thing is, we'll never really know one way or the other.
245500	249000	So I wasn't originally intending to include biopics,
249000	251000	but I think that's a good place to start,
251000	256000	since inevitably they're going to stretch the truth or make things up outright.
256000	261000	In 1998, we have our most well-known Elizabeth Bile pic titled Elizabeth,
261000	263000	which made Cate Blanchett famous,
263000	267000	and ushered in a new era of Elizabeth being in everything.
267000	271000	The film starts during the reign of Queen Mary I, aka Bloody Mary,
271000	276000	and yep, she were real big on the whole Protestant burning thing, hence the name.
276000	281000	Elizabeth puts more focus on this and how evil and ugly Mary is
281000	283000	than the movie's closest comparison,
283000	287000	a 2006 miniseries produced for the BBC called The Virgin Queen.
287000	290000	Elizabeth is much more cartoonish.
290000	293000	She was born a bastard! She will never rule England!
295000	299000	In both Elizabeth and The Virgin Queen, the big love interest is Sir Robert Dudley.
299000	303000	He's just like this charming rando and Elizabeth who's always like,
303000	308000	Hey, my first three buttons are undone, miss.
308000	314000	There's also a scene where Dudley and Liz do it while like five of her ladies in waiting just watch.
314000	317000	Dudley's got a big part in The Virgin Queen, too.
317000	322000	Ride with me, lass. Ride with me like you should.
322000	324000	More like Sir Robert studly.
324000	327000	See, I told you I'd find a way to work Tom Hardy into anything.
328000	329000	Or Transformers.
329000	334000	The theme slash thesis for both seems to be about who Elizabeth will marry,
334000	337000	solution being that she'll marry England.
337000	341000	I am married to England.
341000	343000	Which is, you know, what she said IRL.
343000	347000	Only in The Virgin Queen, she actually stays a virgin, unlike Elizabeth.
347000	349000	It is England I married, my lords.
349000	354000	It shall be sufficient for me when I die that a marble headstone declares
354000	361000	that this queen, having lived for such and such a time, lived and died a virgin.
361000	364000	Her other option in Elizabeth is the Duke of Anjou.
364000	366000	I am Anjou.
367000	370000	He has an outrageous French accent.
370000	376000	He was rumored back in the day to be a transvestite, so yeah, that element is there and it is played for humor.
376000	378000	What?
378000	380000	And also it's the reason she's like, nope.
380000	384000	Her other big accomplishment in this movie is a settlement of the Church of England,
384000	388000	which she manages because Bess and Geoffrey Rush are big fat cheaters
388000	390000	and locked the opposition in the basement.
390000	394000	In fairness, at least they got stuff done back then. Maybe we should try that.
394000	399000	In Elizabeth, there's this bombshell that Robert is already married like halfway through the movie.
399000	401000	He's already married.
401000	403000	You know, she didn't know.
403000	407000	In The Virgin Queen, she knew because everyone knew because he is an Earl.
407000	409000	I trust your wife as well.
411000	415000	Elizabeth had a sequel called Elizabeth the Golden Age.
415000	418000	The movie seems to be about two barely related things,
418000	420000	Mary Queen of Scots and the Spanish Armada,
420000	426000	and Elizabeth catfighting with one of her handmaidens over Sir Walter Raleigh.
426000	431000	Once again, it starts with who's she gonna marry and whose love interest-ish this time,
431000	435000	but romance novel pirate king Sir Walter Raleigh.
435000	437000	Very stimulating.
437000	440000	Mary is an abject stud with ridiculous scruff,
440000	446000	and there's a certain do boys still think I'm hot-ness theme.
446000	450000	In The Virgin Queen, it's implied that Mary Queen of Scots may have been framed
450000	454000	in the plot to kill Elizabeth, whereas in The Golden Age, she's definitely guilty.
454000	457000	You know, a free spirit, but guilty.
457000	460000	In both, Elizabeth is deeply conflicted about the execution,
460000	464000	but in The Golden Age, she's like collapsing in the hallway
464000	467000	as the most ethereal beheading in history goes down.
467000	471000	This singular event sends the Spanish Armada after England.
471000	474000	Yeah, it was a little more complex than that, you know, whatever.
474000	479000	Elizabeth shows up to the battle wearing man armor and gives an Aragorn speech on horseback.
479000	484000	While we stand together, no invader shall pass.
484000	486000	But it is not this day.
489000	491000	And when this day of battle is ended,
492000	495000	we meet again in heaven.
495000	497000	Um, really?
498000	500000	You know, that kind of happened.
500000	504000	And The Virgin Queen has this scene too, but it's a lot less silly,
504000	506000	you know, since she's actually dressed like she'd have dressed
506000	510000	and not like she just got a new set of fancy armor from Jaime Lannister.
510000	513000	Historical figures Walter Raleigh and Sir Francis Drake
513000	516000	appear to have been conflated in The Golden Age.
516000	519000	Raleigh wasn't even at the battle against the Spanish Armada,
519000	522000	but the beat where he marries one of Elizabeth's ladies in waiting
522000	525000	without Elizabeth's permission, that actually did happen,
525000	528000	and it really did piss Elizabeth off.
528000	530000	And she did send them both to the tower.
530000	535000	Yeah, but in the end it's okay because she's a nice queen and babies are cute.
535000	539000	All in all, The Virgin Queen doesn't look as good because it didn't have the budget,
539000	543000	but it's more real, it's more believable, and therefore more satisfying.
543000	546000	Though it definitely also has its moments of silly.
546000	553000	Both films add a lot of drama, making the relationship between Dudley and Elizabeth
553000	557000	a lot more tempestuous than it probably was,
557000	560000	because she did consider him a favorite until he died,
560000	564000	and the big reason they never married was because a bunch of nobles
564000	566000	just put their collective feet down.
566000	570000	See, Elizabeth wasn't dead set on never marrying from day one.
570000	575000	She kind of teased marriage throughout her entire reign to put nerves at ease.
575000	578000	There aren't a whole lot of depictions of a very young Elizabeth,
578000	582000	because there aren't a whole lot of narratives focusing on Henry VIII.
584000	589000	Showtime's sensationalist dramatization of the life of a sexy, svelte Henry VIII
589000	591000	played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers.
591000	597000	Although ages are condensed, Elizabeth is age up and Mary is aged down,
597000	600000	so they're much closer in age than they were IRL.
600000	607000	The scandal and intrigue of the Tudors is centered around Henry and his wives,
607000	613000	and Elizabeth is a toddler for all but the last season, so she's barely in it except as lip service.
613000	618000	As God is my witness, I shall never marry.
618000	620000	Said the eight-year-old.
620000	624000	She also D.G.A.F. when her dad dies, but I cannot say I blame her.
625000	631000	Dame Judi Dench plays Elizabeth for roughly eight minutes in Shakespeare in Love
631000	633000	and won an Academy Award for it.
633000	638000	Although this movie did win a ridiculous, inexplicable amount of Academy Awards that year,
638000	642000	her performance is easily the most memorable thing about this entire movie.
642000	644000	The Dench at her Denchiest.
644000	645000	Your Majesty.
645000	647000	Speak up, girl. I know who I am.
647000	650000	Also, hello again, Joseph Fiennes.
650000	653000	I bet you miss late 90s Elizabethan period pieces.
653000	657000	Yes, William Shakespeare likely did have numerous interactions with Elizabeth,
657000	661000	as Elizabeth was a big patron of the arts, and of theater in particular.
661000	665000	The Queen's involvement comes as basically the arbiter of a bet.
665000	669000	Can a play show us the very truth and nature of love?
669000	673000	Going with Romeo and Juliet might not be it, but okay.
673000	678000	And again, she's barely in it until the very end when she comes in as Queen Ex Machina,
678000	681000	saves the day, and tells everyone how the movie's gonna end.
682000	684000	There was a wager, I remember,
685000	689000	as to whether a play could show the very truth and nature of love.
690000	692000	I think you lost it today.
692000	697000	But even the Queen can't unmarry unhappily married Gwyneth Paltrow.
697000	700000	Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
700000	704000	Didn't Henry VIII start the Church of England so he could divorce willy-nilly?
706000	709000	I think you'll find it was orange, Lord Melchert.
709000	711000	Gray is more usual, ma'am.
712000	713000	Who's Queen?
713000	718000	In the British comedy Blackadder, Queenie has a crush on every boy.
718000	720000	I've got such a crush on him.
721000	724000	She's portrayed as an airhead and an awful person who abuses her power.
724000	728000	The bad news is that actually there are simply hundreds of Catholics
728000	731000	who desperately want their heads sneaked off.
731000	736000	But pretty much everyone in this show is either an awful person or a moron, so...
736000	742000	Do I look absolutely divine and regal and yet at the same time very pretty and rather accessible?
742000	746000	Raleigh's in here too, and yet she's got a crush on him too,
746000	749000	and on Blackadder, and on this guy.
749000	751000	Basically everybody but Stephen Fry.
751000	756000	Though in Blackadder, she either has a crush on every boy or executes people willy-nilly.
756000	760000	And if you haven't brought me any presents, I'm going to have you executed.
760000	761000	Or both.
761000	763000	And that's the joke.
764000	766000	Is this a worthy topic?
766000	774000	From one so clearly in the bloom of youth to one who would desire it still?
774000	779000	Based on the novel by Virginia Woolf, Orlando is a story about a young British nobleman
779000	783000	who not only stops aging and lives all the way into modern times,
783000	788000	but also undergoes a sex change along the way, mysteriously turning into a woman.
788000	791000	In the original novel, it was more ethereal and arbitrary.
791000	795000	So in the film, they decided that it should be more concrete,
795000	800000	so Queen Elizabeth herself bestows long life upon Orlando.
800000	803000	Do not fade.
803000	806000	Do not wither.
806000	809000	Do not grow old.
809000	814000	She is barely in this movie, but apparently has immortality-granting powers.
814000	819000	Another interesting decision, this Elizabeth was played by a dude, Quentin Crisp,
819000	824000	which might be one of the many comments on the nature of the fluidity of gender by the filmmaker,
824000	830000	but it also might be a reference to the fact that many people, both in Elizabethan times and afterwards,
830000	833000	thought that she was a secret man.
833000	838000	Which, no, I'm pretty sure someone would have noticed if Elizabeth had been a boy,
838000	842000	what with Henry VIII blowing through six wives to get one.
844000	846000	Queen Elizabeth I!
846000	849000	Surprised to know one, she's in Doctor Who 2.
849000	852000	She first appears as an older Elizabeth in season 3.
852000	857000	She's coming to the Globe to see Shakespeare's lost play, Love's Labors I,
857000	862000	which probably was a thing and probably is actually lost.
862000	866000	When she marches in, it turns out that she's already met Doctor Who.
866000	869000	You know, time travel, things don't always happen in order.
869000	871000	And he has done a bad, it seems.
871000	873000	Off with his head!
873000	874000	What?
874000	876000	What did he do?
877000	879000	Is someone a woman scorned?
879000	883000	We don't see her again until the 50th anniversary special, The Day of the Doctor.
883000	887000	Here she is much younger and, apparently, in love with the Doctor.
887000	890000	They have apparently had a courtship.
890000	894000	The Doctor proposes to her to see if she's secretly an evil, shape-shifting alien,
894000	896000	and when she says yes, he's like, aha!
896000	897000	Ah, gotcha!
897000	898000	My love?
898000	902000	One, the real Elizabeth would never have accepted my marriage proposal.
902000	907000	No, Doctor, it turns out that the Queen of England would actually do that.
907000	910000	Eventually, the Zygon does try to impersonate Elizabeth,
910000	915000	but Elizabeth kills it and assumes its role in order to control the remainder of the Zygon fleet.
915000	918000	And then the Doctor insults the real Elizabeth some more.
918000	922000	It's not just the smell, or the unconvincing hair, or the atrocious teeth, or the eyes,
922000	926000	just a bit too close together, or the breath that could stun a horse.
926000	927000	What a catch.
927000	931000	This doesn't faze her, and she does make the Doctor marry her,
931000	933000	after which he immediately abandons her,
933000	937000	thus, I guess, solidifying why she hates him so much in that earlier episode.
937000	939000	My sworn enemy.
939000	940000	What?
940000	943000	So I guess that's why she never married.
943000	944000	Comedy.
944000	945000	By whom?
945000	948000	By... Anonymous, Your Majesty.
948000	951000	Anonymous is probably Roland Emmerich's dumbest movie,
951000	953000	and this is the guy who brought us 2012.
953000	956000	The basic conceit of Anonymous is,
956000	959000	Shakespeare didn't write Shakespeare.
959000	960000	This guy did.
960000	964000	The handsome and noble and blonde Earl of Oxford, Edward de Vere.
964000	968000	Why didn't Shakespeare write Shakespeare, you ask?
968000	972000	Because Shakespeare was a poor, and poor's can't art.
972000	975000	In my world, one does not write plays, Johnson.
975000	977000	What, does this have to do with Elizabeth?
977000	979000	Well...
979000	983000	De Vere wrote anonymously because poetry was beneath him.
983000	984000	Poetry.
985000	987000	Earls don't poetry.
987000	990000	But it ends up being this big conspiracy cover-up,
990000	994000	because Oxford and Queen Elizabeth I were lovers,
994000	996000	and had a secret child together,
996000	999000	who was raised as the Earl of Southampton.
999000	1002000	But then, twist, turns out de Vere is also
1002000	1005000	one of Elizabeth's apparent shitsquillion bastards
1005000	1007000	she's got running around the court.
1007000	1010000	Nor could he have predicted that you would commit incest.
1011000	1014000	But to paraphrase from the brows-held high episode on Anonymous,
1014000	1016000	you should watch it.
1016000	1019000	Queen Elizabeth has so many bastard children,
1019000	1021000	she lost track of them.
1021000	1023000	Then, by sheer coincidence, had an affair with one,
1023000	1026000	and got re-inbred pregnant,
1026000	1028000	producing a super inbred double bastard,
1028000	1031000	who is also a possible tutor heir.
1031000	1035000	You could have been a king, Edward.
1035000	1037000	And your son, after you.
1037000	1039000	Elizabeth doesn't seem to know that
1039000	1041000	de Vere is her bio-son,
1041000	1043000	despite the fact that he eventually does.
1043000	1047000	She also doesn't seem batty and boy-crazy and weird,
1047000	1048000	like Queenie,
1048000	1050000	yet she'll just bang whoever.
1050000	1052000	I love him!
1052000	1055000	Someone tell Roland Emmerich that bastard children
1055000	1059000	are kinda harder for women to keep on the DL.
1059000	1062000	Man, it sure is weird that the Queen keeps disappearing
1062000	1065000	for these nine-month intervals, huh?
1065000	1068000	This Elizabeth is not much with the priorities.
1068000	1071000	I can do what I want.
1071000	1074000	And is later duped into thinking that the Earl of Essex
1074000	1076000	and the ultra-bastard Southampton
1076000	1078000	are trying to organize a coup against her,
1078000	1081000	when really it's an oopsie-daisy misunderstanding
1081000	1083000	orchestrated by the real bad guys.
1083000	1086000	But upon finding out that the Earl of Southampton is his son,
1086000	1091000	OG bastard dad-brother de Vere begs for his life,
1091000	1094000	so Elizabeth just exiles Southampton or something
1094000	1097000	in exchange for de Vere's name never being on his works
1097000	1101000	for some reason.
1101000	1106000	None of your poems or your plays
1106000	1109000	will ever carry your name.
1109000	1113000	And this isn't just some weird shit that Roland dreamed up.
1113000	1116000	Shakespeare truthers actually believe this.
1117000	1119000	Anonymous!
1119000	1122000	Choosing which versions of Elizabeth to cover in this episode
1122000	1123000	was a bit of a stacked deck,
1123000	1126000	because there are so, so many out there,
1126000	1131000	and what constitutes fictionalized varies really based on who you ask.
1131000	1136000	Many versions try to straddle this line between dramatic and historically accurate,
1136000	1139000	but they're probably going to choose drama over accuracy.
1139000	1141000	Others, not so much.
1141000	1143000	And I think maybe they think they are?
1143000	1145000	Why does this exist?
1145000	1148000	So with that in mind, it is funny that the further you get from a historical event,
1148000	1153000	the more okay it is to appropriate someone's life for your fictional narrative.
1153000	1156000	There was a wager, I remember,
1156000	1161000	as to whether a play could show the very truth and nature of love.
1161000	1164000	I think you lost it today.
1164000	1166000	Or your dumbass conspiracy theory.
1166000	1168000	None.
1168000	1171000	That said, in a way, I think that makes looking at people who actually existed
1171000	1173000	kind of more interesting than fictional characters.
1173000	1175000	So that's it for this one.
