00:00.000 --> 00:03.500
So, new territory. In many regards.

00:03.500 --> 00:07.000
So this month's idea was to look at fictional depictions of historical figures.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
So when presented with these three options, the vote went to, um, Queen Elizabeth I.

00:14.500 --> 00:15.500
I'm surprised, too.

00:15.500 --> 00:18.000
Have a care with my name. You will wear it out.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.500
Certainly one of the more iconic historical monarchs,

00:20.500 --> 00:24.500
and probably the most famous of all female monarchs in Western history,

00:24.500 --> 00:27.500
she was also more likely to pop up in narrative fiction.

00:27.500 --> 00:31.000
She led England into an unprecedented period of wealth and stability,

00:31.000 --> 00:33.500
something, something, golden age, yada yada.

00:33.500 --> 00:38.500
But when we're fictionalizing someone who was famously the Virgin Queen,

00:38.500 --> 00:42.500
most of that fictionalizing will center around one thing.

00:42.500 --> 00:46.500
Come on. We know she's f***ing someone.

00:46.500 --> 00:49.000
Who was she really shtupping?

00:49.000 --> 00:52.500
You know, because it had to be someone, right?

00:52.500 --> 00:56.500
Was it this guy? Or maybe this guy?

00:56.500 --> 00:58.500
Or maybe him?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Why not?

01:01.000 --> 01:04.500
If it's a female historical figure, that's probably going to be the common thread.

01:04.500 --> 01:10.000
Anyway, like George Washington, Queenie has a ton of media to plow through.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.500
Some more historical, some not.

01:12.500 --> 01:15.000
So I'm going to focus on more recent versions,

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
starting with the more biopic-y side that are trying to be more historically accurate,

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
and then moving towards the more squirrelly.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.500
This should be interesting.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
Actual human who actually existed, Queen Elizabeth I.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
Elizabeth I should never have been queen.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.500
Well, I can scratch that.

01:42.500 --> 01:47.500
It's more like she had to blow through a whole host of royals who were in line ahead of her

01:47.500 --> 01:50.500
before she was able to become queen.

01:50.500 --> 01:55.000
King Henry VIII had a big obsession with producing a male heir, you know, more than usual,

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
which led to him blowing through six wives in order to get his precious male heir,

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
who died at the age of 15,

02:01.000 --> 02:04.500
leaving him with his two half-sisters to duke it out over the throne.

02:04.500 --> 02:10.000
Elizabeth was declared a bastard when her mother, Anne Boleyn, was executed for alleged adultery.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.500
But then some years later, both she and her older half-sister, Mary,

02:13.500 --> 02:17.000
were restored to the line of succession after King Henry mellowed a bit.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.500
So, after Henry VIII died, Elizabeth was in line behind her brother, Edward,

02:21.500 --> 02:25.000
her sister, Mary, and one random Protestant cousin

02:25.000 --> 02:28.500
whom the young, dying Edward declared his successor on his deathbed

02:28.500 --> 02:30.500
because she was Protestant and Mary was Catholic,

02:30.500 --> 02:34.500
and she made it about nine days before being executed.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Hey, Game of Thrones was inspired by something.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.500
After Bloody Mary died of what was probably ovarian cancer without an heir,

02:43.500 --> 02:46.500
Elizabeth became queen at the age of 25.

02:46.500 --> 02:51.500
England then flourished under her absolute monarchy and the Tudor dynasty ended.

02:51.500 --> 02:57.500
And she was also a patron of Shakespeare, so she's generally remembered pretty favorably.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.500
You know, by the English, anyway.

02:59.500 --> 03:02.000
Flash forward to the era of film and television.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.500
Elizabeth's portrayals are generally sympathetic,

03:04.500 --> 03:08.000
but that also depends on what part of her life we are focusing on

03:08.000 --> 03:10.500
or how we feel about Mary, Queen of Scots,

03:10.500 --> 03:13.500
whom Elizabeth had executed for an alleged coup against her.

03:13.500 --> 03:18.000
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, there were more dramas about Mary than about Elizabeth,

03:18.000 --> 03:22.500
but more recently, the focus and sympathy has shifted back Elizabeth's words.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.500
Anyway, so.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.500
Virgin Queen.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.500
Really now?

03:30.500 --> 03:33.500
There's always been speculation on who, if anyone,

03:33.500 --> 03:37.500
Queen Elizabeth was doing her royal duty with while she was on the throne,

03:37.500 --> 03:39.500
included but not limited to

03:39.500 --> 03:43.500
Sir Robert Dudley, Earl of...

03:43.500 --> 03:48.500
Robert Devereaux, Earl of Essex, whom she would later have executed for treason,

03:48.500 --> 03:54.500
the Duke of Anjou, Thomas Heneage, Christopher Hatton, even Sir Walter Raleigh.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.500
That was the fixation back in the day,

03:56.500 --> 04:00.500
it's still more or less the fixation now with her portrayals,

04:00.500 --> 04:02.500
and it varies in some curious ways.

04:02.500 --> 04:05.500
And the thing is, we'll never really know one way or the other.

04:05.500 --> 04:09.000
So I wasn't originally intending to include biopics,

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
but I think that's a good place to start,

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
since inevitably they're going to stretch the truth or make things up outright.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
In 1998, we have our most well-known Elizabeth Bile pic titled Elizabeth,

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
which made Cate Blanchett famous,

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
and ushered in a new era of Elizabeth being in everything.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
The film starts during the reign of Queen Mary I, aka Bloody Mary,

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
and yep, she were real big on the whole Protestant burning thing, hence the name.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
Elizabeth puts more focus on this and how evil and ugly Mary is

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
than the movie's closest comparison,

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
a 2006 miniseries produced for the BBC called The Virgin Queen.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Elizabeth is much more cartoonish.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
She was born a bastard! She will never rule England!

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
In both Elizabeth and The Virgin Queen, the big love interest is Sir Robert Dudley.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
He's just like this charming rando and Elizabeth who's always like,

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
Hey, my first three buttons are undone, miss.

05:08.000 --> 05:14.000
There's also a scene where Dudley and Liz do it while like five of her ladies in waiting just watch.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Dudley's got a big part in The Virgin Queen, too.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
Ride with me, lass. Ride with me like you should.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
More like Sir Robert studly.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
See, I told you I'd find a way to work Tom Hardy into anything.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Or Transformers.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
The theme slash thesis for both seems to be about who Elizabeth will marry,

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
solution being that she'll marry England.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
I am married to England.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Which is, you know, what she said IRL.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
Only in The Virgin Queen, she actually stays a virgin, unlike Elizabeth.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
It is England I married, my lords.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
It shall be sufficient for me when I die that a marble headstone declares

05:54.000 --> 06:01.000
that this queen, having lived for such and such a time, lived and died a virgin.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Her other option in Elizabeth is the Duke of Anjou.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
I am Anjou.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
He has an outrageous French accent.

06:10.000 --> 06:16.000
He was rumored back in the day to be a transvestite, so yeah, that element is there and it is played for humor.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
What?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
And also it's the reason she's like, nope.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
Her other big accomplishment in this movie is a settlement of the Church of England,

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
which she manages because Bess and Geoffrey Rush are big fat cheaters

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
and locked the opposition in the basement.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
In fairness, at least they got stuff done back then. Maybe we should try that.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
In Elizabeth, there's this bombshell that Robert is already married like halfway through the movie.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
He's already married.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
You know, she didn't know.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
In The Virgin Queen, she knew because everyone knew because he is an Earl.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
I trust your wife as well.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
Elizabeth had a sequel called Elizabeth the Golden Age.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
The movie seems to be about two barely related things,

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Mary Queen of Scots and the Spanish Armada,

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
and Elizabeth catfighting with one of her handmaidens over Sir Walter Raleigh.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
Once again, it starts with who's she gonna marry and whose love interest-ish this time,

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
but romance novel pirate king Sir Walter Raleigh.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Very stimulating.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Mary is an abject stud with ridiculous scruff,

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
and there's a certain do boys still think I'm hot-ness theme.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
In The Virgin Queen, it's implied that Mary Queen of Scots may have been framed

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
in the plot to kill Elizabeth, whereas in The Golden Age, she's definitely guilty.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
You know, a free spirit, but guilty.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
In both, Elizabeth is deeply conflicted about the execution,

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
but in The Golden Age, she's like collapsing in the hallway

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
as the most ethereal beheading in history goes down.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
This singular event sends the Spanish Armada after England.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
Yeah, it was a little more complex than that, you know, whatever.

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
Elizabeth shows up to the battle wearing man armor and gives an Aragorn speech on horseback.

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
While we stand together, no invader shall pass.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
But it is not this day.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
And when this day of battle is ended,

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
we meet again in heaven.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Um, really?

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
You know, that kind of happened.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
And The Virgin Queen has this scene too, but it's a lot less silly,

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
you know, since she's actually dressed like she'd have dressed

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
and not like she just got a new set of fancy armor from Jaime Lannister.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
Historical figures Walter Raleigh and Sir Francis Drake

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
appear to have been conflated in The Golden Age.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Raleigh wasn't even at the battle against the Spanish Armada,

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
but the beat where he marries one of Elizabeth's ladies in waiting

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
without Elizabeth's permission, that actually did happen,

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
and it really did piss Elizabeth off.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
And she did send them both to the tower.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
Yeah, but in the end it's okay because she's a nice queen and babies are cute.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
All in all, The Virgin Queen doesn't look as good because it didn't have the budget,

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
but it's more real, it's more believable, and therefore more satisfying.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
Though it definitely also has its moments of silly.

09:06.000 --> 09:13.000
Both films add a lot of drama, making the relationship between Dudley and Elizabeth

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
a lot more tempestuous than it probably was,

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
because she did consider him a favorite until he died,

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
and the big reason they never married was because a bunch of nobles

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
just put their collective feet down.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
See, Elizabeth wasn't dead set on never marrying from day one.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
She kind of teased marriage throughout her entire reign to put nerves at ease.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
There aren't a whole lot of depictions of a very young Elizabeth,

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
because there aren't a whole lot of narratives focusing on Henry VIII.

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
Showtime's sensationalist dramatization of the life of a sexy, svelte Henry VIII

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers.

09:51.000 --> 09:57.000
Although ages are condensed, Elizabeth is age up and Mary is aged down,

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
so they're much closer in age than they were IRL.

10:00.000 --> 10:07.000
The scandal and intrigue of the Tudors is centered around Henry and his wives,

10:07.000 --> 10:13.000
and Elizabeth is a toddler for all but the last season, so she's barely in it except as lip service.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
As God is my witness, I shall never marry.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Said the eight-year-old.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
She also D.G.A.F. when her dad dies, but I cannot say I blame her.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
Dame Judi Dench plays Elizabeth for roughly eight minutes in Shakespeare in Love

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
and won an Academy Award for it.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
Although this movie did win a ridiculous, inexplicable amount of Academy Awards that year,

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
her performance is easily the most memorable thing about this entire movie.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
The Dench at her Denchiest.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Your Majesty.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Speak up, girl. I know who I am.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
Also, hello again, Joseph Fiennes.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
I bet you miss late 90s Elizabethan period pieces.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
Yes, William Shakespeare likely did have numerous interactions with Elizabeth,

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
as Elizabeth was a big patron of the arts, and of theater in particular.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
The Queen's involvement comes as basically the arbiter of a bet.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
Can a play show us the very truth and nature of love?

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
Going with Romeo and Juliet might not be it, but okay.

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
And again, she's barely in it until the very end when she comes in as Queen Ex Machina,

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
saves the day, and tells everyone how the movie's gonna end.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
There was a wager, I remember,

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
as to whether a play could show the very truth and nature of love.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
I think you lost it today.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
But even the Queen can't unmarry unhappily married Gwyneth Paltrow.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
Didn't Henry VIII start the Church of England so he could divorce willy-nilly?

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
I think you'll find it was orange, Lord Melchert.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Gray is more usual, ma'am.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Who's Queen?

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
In the British comedy Blackadder, Queenie has a crush on every boy.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
I've got such a crush on him.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
She's portrayed as an airhead and an awful person who abuses her power.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
The bad news is that actually there are simply hundreds of Catholics

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
who desperately want their heads sneaked off.

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
But pretty much everyone in this show is either an awful person or a moron, so...

12:16.000 --> 12:22.000
Do I look absolutely divine and regal and yet at the same time very pretty and rather accessible?

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
Raleigh's in here too, and yet she's got a crush on him too,

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
and on Blackadder, and on this guy.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Basically everybody but Stephen Fry.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
Though in Blackadder, she either has a crush on every boy or executes people willy-nilly.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
And if you haven't brought me any presents, I'm going to have you executed.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Or both.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
And that's the joke.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Is this a worthy topic?

12:46.000 --> 12:54.000
From one so clearly in the bloom of youth to one who would desire it still?

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
Based on the novel by Virginia Woolf, Orlando is a story about a young British nobleman

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
who not only stops aging and lives all the way into modern times,

13:03.000 --> 13:08.000
but also undergoes a sex change along the way, mysteriously turning into a woman.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
In the original novel, it was more ethereal and arbitrary.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
So in the film, they decided that it should be more concrete,

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
so Queen Elizabeth herself bestows long life upon Orlando.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
Do not fade.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
Do not wither.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
Do not grow old.

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
She is barely in this movie, but apparently has immortality-granting powers.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
Another interesting decision, this Elizabeth was played by a dude, Quentin Crisp,

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
which might be one of the many comments on the nature of the fluidity of gender by the filmmaker,

13:44.000 --> 13:50.000
but it also might be a reference to the fact that many people, both in Elizabethan times and afterwards,

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
thought that she was a secret man.

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
Which, no, I'm pretty sure someone would have noticed if Elizabeth had been a boy,

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
what with Henry VIII blowing through six wives to get one.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Queen Elizabeth I!

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
Surprised to know one, she's in Doctor Who 2.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
She first appears as an older Elizabeth in season 3.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
She's coming to the Globe to see Shakespeare's lost play, Love's Labors I,

14:17.000 --> 14:22.000
which probably was a thing and probably is actually lost.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
When she marches in, it turns out that she's already met Doctor Who.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
You know, time travel, things don't always happen in order.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
And he has done a bad, it seems.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Off with his head!

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
What?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
What did he do?

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Is someone a woman scorned?

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
We don't see her again until the 50th anniversary special, The Day of the Doctor.

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
Here she is much younger and, apparently, in love with the Doctor.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
They have apparently had a courtship.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
The Doctor proposes to her to see if she's secretly an evil, shape-shifting alien,

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
and when she says yes, he's like, aha!

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Ah, gotcha!

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
My love?

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
One, the real Elizabeth would never have accepted my marriage proposal.

15:02.000 --> 15:07.000
No, Doctor, it turns out that the Queen of England would actually do that.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
Eventually, the Zygon does try to impersonate Elizabeth,

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
but Elizabeth kills it and assumes its role in order to control the remainder of the Zygon fleet.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
And then the Doctor insults the real Elizabeth some more.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
It's not just the smell, or the unconvincing hair, or the atrocious teeth, or the eyes,

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
just a bit too close together, or the breath that could stun a horse.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
What a catch.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
This doesn't faze her, and she does make the Doctor marry her,

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
after which he immediately abandons her,

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
thus, I guess, solidifying why she hates him so much in that earlier episode.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
My sworn enemy.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
What?

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
So I guess that's why she never married.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Comedy.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
By whom?

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
By... Anonymous, Your Majesty.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
Anonymous is probably Roland Emmerich's dumbest movie,

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
and this is the guy who brought us 2012.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
The basic conceit of Anonymous is,

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
Shakespeare didn't write Shakespeare.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
This guy did.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
The handsome and noble and blonde Earl of Oxford, Edward de Vere.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
Why didn't Shakespeare write Shakespeare, you ask?

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
Because Shakespeare was a poor, and poor's can't art.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
In my world, one does not write plays, Johnson.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
What, does this have to do with Elizabeth?

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Well...

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
De Vere wrote anonymously because poetry was beneath him.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Poetry.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Earls don't poetry.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
But it ends up being this big conspiracy cover-up,

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
because Oxford and Queen Elizabeth I were lovers,

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
and had a secret child together,

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
who was raised as the Earl of Southampton.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
But then, twist, turns out de Vere is also

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
one of Elizabeth's apparent shitsquillion bastards

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
she's got running around the court.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
Nor could he have predicted that you would commit incest.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
But to paraphrase from the brows-held high episode on Anonymous,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
you should watch it.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
Queen Elizabeth has so many bastard children,

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
she lost track of them.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Then, by sheer coincidence, had an affair with one,

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
and got re-inbred pregnant,

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
producing a super inbred double bastard,

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
who is also a possible tutor heir.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
You could have been a king, Edward.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
And your son, after you.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Elizabeth doesn't seem to know that

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
de Vere is her bio-son,

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
despite the fact that he eventually does.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
She also doesn't seem batty and boy-crazy and weird,

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
like Queenie,

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
yet she'll just bang whoever.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
I love him!

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
Someone tell Roland Emmerich that bastard children

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
are kinda harder for women to keep on the DL.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
Man, it sure is weird that the Queen keeps disappearing

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
for these nine-month intervals, huh?

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
This Elizabeth is not much with the priorities.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
I can do what I want.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
And is later duped into thinking that the Earl of Essex

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
and the ultra-bastard Southampton

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
are trying to organize a coup against her,

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
when really it's an oopsie-daisy misunderstanding

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
orchestrated by the real bad guys.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
But upon finding out that the Earl of Southampton is his son,

18:06.000 --> 18:11.000
OG bastard dad-brother de Vere begs for his life,

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
so Elizabeth just exiles Southampton or something

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
in exchange for de Vere's name never being on his works

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
for some reason.

18:21.000 --> 18:26.000
None of your poems or your plays

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
will ever carry your name.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
And this isn't just some weird shit that Roland dreamed up.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
Shakespeare truthers actually believe this.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Anonymous!

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
Choosing which versions of Elizabeth to cover in this episode

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
was a bit of a stacked deck,

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
because there are so, so many out there,

18:46.000 --> 18:51.000
and what constitutes fictionalized varies really based on who you ask.

18:51.000 --> 18:56.000
Many versions try to straddle this line between dramatic and historically accurate,

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
but they're probably going to choose drama over accuracy.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Others, not so much.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
And I think maybe they think they are?

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Why does this exist?

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
So with that in mind, it is funny that the further you get from a historical event,

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
the more okay it is to appropriate someone's life for your fictional narrative.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
There was a wager, I remember,

19:16.000 --> 19:21.000
as to whether a play could show the very truth and nature of love.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
I think you lost it today.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Or your dumbass conspiracy theory.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
None.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
That said, in a way, I think that makes looking at people who actually existed

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
kind of more interesting than fictional characters.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
So that's it for this one.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
If you want to help me decide on themes for new episodes,

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
you can do so on Patreon,

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
and you can also support the show here

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
If you want to find out updates on upcoming shows and other projects,

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
I am on Twitter, which is here.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
Thank you for watching, and next month we have a very special episode.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
By popular demand.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Yeah, it will be fun.
