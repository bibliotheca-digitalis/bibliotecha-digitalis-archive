1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
So, new territory. In many regards.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,000
So this month's idea was to look at fictional depictions of historical figures.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So when presented with these three options, the vote went to, um, Queen Elizabeth I.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,500
I'm surprised, too.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,000
Have a care with my name. You will wear it out.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,500
Certainly one of the more iconic historical monarchs,

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,500
and probably the most famous of all female monarchs in Western history,

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,500
she was also more likely to pop up in narrative fiction.

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,000
She led England into an unprecedented period of wealth and stability,

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,500
something, something, golden age, yada yada.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,500
But when we're fictionalizing someone who was famously the Virgin Queen,

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,500
most of that fictionalizing will center around one thing.

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,500
Come on. We know she's f***ing someone.

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,000
Who was she really shtupping?

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,500
You know, because it had to be someone, right?

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,500
Was it this guy? Or maybe this guy?

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,500
Or maybe him?

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Why not?

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,500
If it's a female historical figure, that's probably going to be the common thread.

20
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,000
Anyway, like George Washington, Queenie has a ton of media to plow through.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,500
Some more historical, some not.

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,000
So I'm going to focus on more recent versions,

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
starting with the more biopic-y side that are trying to be more historically accurate,

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and then moving towards the more squirrelly.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,500
This should be interesting.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Actual human who actually existed, Queen Elizabeth I.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Elizabeth I should never have been queen.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,500
Well, I can scratch that.

29
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,500
It's more like she had to blow through a whole host of royals who were in line ahead of her

30
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,500
before she was able to become queen.

31
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,000
King Henry VIII had a big obsession with producing a male heir, you know, more than usual,

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
which led to him blowing through six wives in order to get his precious male heir,

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
who died at the age of 15,

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,500
leaving him with his two half-sisters to duke it out over the throne.

35
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,000
Elizabeth was declared a bastard when her mother, Anne Boleyn, was executed for alleged adultery.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,500
But then some years later, both she and her older half-sister, Mary,

37
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,000
were restored to the line of succession after King Henry mellowed a bit.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,500
So, after Henry VIII died, Elizabeth was in line behind her brother, Edward,

39
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,000
her sister, Mary, and one random Protestant cousin

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,500
whom the young, dying Edward declared his successor on his deathbed

41
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,500
because she was Protestant and Mary was Catholic,

42
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,500
and she made it about nine days before being executed.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Hey, Game of Thrones was inspired by something.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,500
After Bloody Mary died of what was probably ovarian cancer without an heir,

45
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Elizabeth became queen at the age of 25.

46
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,500
England then flourished under her absolute monarchy and the Tudor dynasty ended.

47
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:57,500
And she was also a patron of Shakespeare, so she's generally remembered pretty favorably.

48
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,500
You know, by the English, anyway.

49
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,000
Flash forward to the era of film and television.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,500
Elizabeth's portrayals are generally sympathetic,

51
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,000
but that also depends on what part of her life we are focusing on

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,500
or how we feel about Mary, Queen of Scots,

53
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,500
whom Elizabeth had executed for an alleged coup against her.

54
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,000
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, there were more dramas about Mary than about Elizabeth,

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,500
but more recently, the focus and sympathy has shifted back Elizabeth's words.

56
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,500
Anyway, so.

57
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,500
Virgin Queen.

58
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,500
Really now?

59
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,500
There's always been speculation on who, if anyone,

60
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,500
Queen Elizabeth was doing her royal duty with while she was on the throne,

61
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,500
included but not limited to

62
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,500
Sir Robert Dudley, Earl of...

63
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,500
Robert Devereaux, Earl of Essex, whom she would later have executed for treason,

64
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:54,500
the Duke of Anjou, Thomas Heneage, Christopher Hatton, even Sir Walter Raleigh.

65
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
That was the fixation back in the day,

66
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,500
it's still more or less the fixation now with her portrayals,

67
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,500
and it varies in some curious ways.

68
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,500
And the thing is, we'll never really know one way or the other.

69
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,000
So I wasn't originally intending to include biopics,

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
but I think that's a good place to start,

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
since inevitably they're going to stretch the truth or make things up outright.

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
In 1998, we have our most well-known Elizabeth Bile pic titled Elizabeth,

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
which made Cate Blanchett famous,

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and ushered in a new era of Elizabeth being in everything.

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The film starts during the reign of Queen Mary I, aka Bloody Mary,

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and yep, she were real big on the whole Protestant burning thing, hence the name.

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Elizabeth puts more focus on this and how evil and ugly Mary is

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
than the movie's closest comparison,

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
a 2006 miniseries produced for the BBC called The Virgin Queen.

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Elizabeth is much more cartoonish.

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
She was born a bastard! She will never rule England!

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
In both Elizabeth and The Virgin Queen, the big love interest is Sir Robert Dudley.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
He's just like this charming rando and Elizabeth who's always like,

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Hey, my first three buttons are undone, miss.

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
There's also a scene where Dudley and Liz do it while like five of her ladies in waiting just watch.

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Dudley's got a big part in The Virgin Queen, too.

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Ride with me, lass. Ride with me like you should.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
More like Sir Robert studly.

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
See, I told you I'd find a way to work Tom Hardy into anything.

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Or Transformers.

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The theme slash thesis for both seems to be about who Elizabeth will marry,

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
solution being that she'll marry England.

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I am married to England.

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Which is, you know, what she said IRL.

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Only in The Virgin Queen, she actually stays a virgin, unlike Elizabeth.

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It is England I married, my lords.

97
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It shall be sufficient for me when I die that a marble headstone declares

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
that this queen, having lived for such and such a time, lived and died a virgin.

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Her other option in Elizabeth is the Duke of Anjou.

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I am Anjou.

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He has an outrageous French accent.

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
He was rumored back in the day to be a transvestite, so yeah, that element is there and it is played for humor.

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What?

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And also it's the reason she's like, nope.

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Her other big accomplishment in this movie is a settlement of the Church of England,

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
which she manages because Bess and Geoffrey Rush are big fat cheaters

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and locked the opposition in the basement.

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
In fairness, at least they got stuff done back then. Maybe we should try that.

109
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
In Elizabeth, there's this bombshell that Robert is already married like halfway through the movie.

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
He's already married.

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You know, she didn't know.

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
In The Virgin Queen, she knew because everyone knew because he is an Earl.

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I trust your wife as well.

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Elizabeth had a sequel called Elizabeth the Golden Age.

115
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The movie seems to be about two barely related things,

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Mary Queen of Scots and the Spanish Armada,

117
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and Elizabeth catfighting with one of her handmaidens over Sir Walter Raleigh.

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Once again, it starts with who's she gonna marry and whose love interest-ish this time,

119
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
but romance novel pirate king Sir Walter Raleigh.

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Very stimulating.

121
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Mary is an abject stud with ridiculous scruff,

122
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and there's a certain do boys still think I'm hot-ness theme.

123
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
In The Virgin Queen, it's implied that Mary Queen of Scots may have been framed

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
in the plot to kill Elizabeth, whereas in The Golden Age, she's definitely guilty.

125
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You know, a free spirit, but guilty.

126
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
In both, Elizabeth is deeply conflicted about the execution,

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
but in The Golden Age, she's like collapsing in the hallway

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
as the most ethereal beheading in history goes down.

129
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
This singular event sends the Spanish Armada after England.

130
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah, it was a little more complex than that, you know, whatever.

131
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Elizabeth shows up to the battle wearing man armor and gives an Aragorn speech on horseback.

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
While we stand together, no invader shall pass.

133
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But it is not this day.

134
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And when this day of battle is ended,

135
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
we meet again in heaven.

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Um, really?

137
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You know, that kind of happened.

138
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And The Virgin Queen has this scene too, but it's a lot less silly,

139
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
you know, since she's actually dressed like she'd have dressed

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
and not like she just got a new set of fancy armor from Jaime Lannister.

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Historical figures Walter Raleigh and Sir Francis Drake

142
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
appear to have been conflated in The Golden Age.

143
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Raleigh wasn't even at the battle against the Spanish Armada,

144
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
but the beat where he marries one of Elizabeth's ladies in waiting

145
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
without Elizabeth's permission, that actually did happen,

146
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and it really did piss Elizabeth off.

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And she did send them both to the tower.

148
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yeah, but in the end it's okay because she's a nice queen and babies are cute.

149
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
All in all, The Virgin Queen doesn't look as good because it didn't have the budget,

150
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
but it's more real, it's more believable, and therefore more satisfying.

151
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Though it definitely also has its moments of silly.

152
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Both films add a lot of drama, making the relationship between Dudley and Elizabeth

153
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
a lot more tempestuous than it probably was,

154
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
because she did consider him a favorite until he died,

155
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
and the big reason they never married was because a bunch of nobles

156
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
just put their collective feet down.

157
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
See, Elizabeth wasn't dead set on never marrying from day one.

158
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
She kind of teased marriage throughout her entire reign to put nerves at ease.

159
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
There aren't a whole lot of depictions of a very young Elizabeth,

160
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
because there aren't a whole lot of narratives focusing on Henry VIII.

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Showtime's sensationalist dramatization of the life of a sexy, svelte Henry VIII

162
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers.

163
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Although ages are condensed, Elizabeth is age up and Mary is aged down,

164
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
so they're much closer in age than they were IRL.

165
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The scandal and intrigue of the Tudors is centered around Henry and his wives,

166
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and Elizabeth is a toddler for all but the last season, so she's barely in it except as lip service.

167
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
As God is my witness, I shall never marry.

168
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Said the eight-year-old.

169
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
She also D.G.A.F. when her dad dies, but I cannot say I blame her.

170
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Dame Judi Dench plays Elizabeth for roughly eight minutes in Shakespeare in Love

171
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and won an Academy Award for it.

172
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Although this movie did win a ridiculous, inexplicable amount of Academy Awards that year,

173
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
her performance is easily the most memorable thing about this entire movie.

174
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The Dench at her Denchiest.

175
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Your Majesty.

176
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Speak up, girl. I know who I am.

177
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Also, hello again, Joseph Fiennes.

178
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I bet you miss late 90s Elizabethan period pieces.

179
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yes, William Shakespeare likely did have numerous interactions with Elizabeth,

180
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
as Elizabeth was a big patron of the arts, and of theater in particular.

181
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The Queen's involvement comes as basically the arbiter of a bet.

182
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Can a play show us the very truth and nature of love?

183
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Going with Romeo and Juliet might not be it, but okay.

184
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And again, she's barely in it until the very end when she comes in as Queen Ex Machina,

185
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
saves the day, and tells everyone how the movie's gonna end.

186
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
There was a wager, I remember,

187
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
as to whether a play could show the very truth and nature of love.

188
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I think you lost it today.

189
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But even the Queen can't unmarry unhappily married Gwyneth Paltrow.

190
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.

191
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Didn't Henry VIII start the Church of England so he could divorce willy-nilly?

192
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I think you'll find it was orange, Lord Melchert.

193
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Gray is more usual, ma'am.

194
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Who's Queen?

195
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
In the British comedy Blackadder, Queenie has a crush on every boy.

196
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I've got such a crush on him.

197
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
She's portrayed as an airhead and an awful person who abuses her power.

198
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The bad news is that actually there are simply hundreds of Catholics

199
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
who desperately want their heads sneaked off.

200
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But pretty much everyone in this show is either an awful person or a moron, so...

201
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Do I look absolutely divine and regal and yet at the same time very pretty and rather accessible?

202
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Raleigh's in here too, and yet she's got a crush on him too,

203
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and on Blackadder, and on this guy.

204
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Basically everybody but Stephen Fry.

205
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Though in Blackadder, she either has a crush on every boy or executes people willy-nilly.

206
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And if you haven't brought me any presents, I'm going to have you executed.

207
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Or both.

208
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And that's the joke.

209
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Is this a worthy topic?

210
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:54,000
From one so clearly in the bloom of youth to one who would desire it still?

211
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Based on the novel by Virginia Woolf, Orlando is a story about a young British nobleman

212
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
who not only stops aging and lives all the way into modern times,

213
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
but also undergoes a sex change along the way, mysteriously turning into a woman.

214
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
In the original novel, it was more ethereal and arbitrary.

215
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So in the film, they decided that it should be more concrete,

216
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
so Queen Elizabeth herself bestows long life upon Orlando.

217
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Do not fade.

218
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Do not wither.

219
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Do not grow old.

220
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
She is barely in this movie, but apparently has immortality-granting powers.

221
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Another interesting decision, this Elizabeth was played by a dude, Quentin Crisp,

222
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
which might be one of the many comments on the nature of the fluidity of gender by the filmmaker,

223
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
but it also might be a reference to the fact that many people, both in Elizabethan times and afterwards,

224
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
thought that she was a secret man.

225
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Which, no, I'm pretty sure someone would have noticed if Elizabeth had been a boy,

226
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
what with Henry VIII blowing through six wives to get one.

227
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Queen Elizabeth I!

228
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Surprised to know one, she's in Doctor Who 2.

229
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
She first appears as an older Elizabeth in season 3.

230
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
She's coming to the Globe to see Shakespeare's lost play, Love's Labors I,

231
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
which probably was a thing and probably is actually lost.

232
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
When she marches in, it turns out that she's already met Doctor Who.

233
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You know, time travel, things don't always happen in order.

234
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And he has done a bad, it seems.

235
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Off with his head!

236
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What?

237
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
What did he do?

238
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Is someone a woman scorned?

239
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
We don't see her again until the 50th anniversary special, The Day of the Doctor.

240
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Here she is much younger and, apparently, in love with the Doctor.

241
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
They have apparently had a courtship.

242
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The Doctor proposes to her to see if she's secretly an evil, shape-shifting alien,

243
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
and when she says yes, he's like, aha!

244
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Ah, gotcha!

245
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
My love?

246
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
One, the real Elizabeth would never have accepted my marriage proposal.

247
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
No, Doctor, it turns out that the Queen of England would actually do that.

248
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Eventually, the Zygon does try to impersonate Elizabeth,

249
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
but Elizabeth kills it and assumes its role in order to control the remainder of the Zygon fleet.

250
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And then the Doctor insults the real Elizabeth some more.

251
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's not just the smell, or the unconvincing hair, or the atrocious teeth, or the eyes,

252
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
just a bit too close together, or the breath that could stun a horse.

253
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What a catch.

254
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
This doesn't faze her, and she does make the Doctor marry her,

255
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
after which he immediately abandons her,

256
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
thus, I guess, solidifying why she hates him so much in that earlier episode.

257
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
My sworn enemy.

258
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What?

259
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So I guess that's why she never married.

260
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Comedy.

261
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
By whom?

262
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
By... Anonymous, Your Majesty.

263
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Anonymous is probably Roland Emmerich's dumbest movie,

264
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and this is the guy who brought us 2012.

265
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The basic conceit of Anonymous is,

266
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Shakespeare didn't write Shakespeare.

267
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
This guy did.

268
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The handsome and noble and blonde Earl of Oxford, Edward de Vere.

269
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Why didn't Shakespeare write Shakespeare, you ask?

270
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Because Shakespeare was a poor, and poor's can't art.

271
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
In my world, one does not write plays, Johnson.

272
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
What, does this have to do with Elizabeth?

273
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Well...

274
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
De Vere wrote anonymously because poetry was beneath him.

275
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Poetry.

276
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Earls don't poetry.

277
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
But it ends up being this big conspiracy cover-up,

278
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
because Oxford and Queen Elizabeth I were lovers,

279
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
and had a secret child together,

280
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
who was raised as the Earl of Southampton.

281
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But then, twist, turns out de Vere is also

282
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
one of Elizabeth's apparent shitsquillion bastards

283
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
she's got running around the court.

284
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Nor could he have predicted that you would commit incest.

285
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
But to paraphrase from the brows-held high episode on Anonymous,

286
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
you should watch it.

287
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Queen Elizabeth has so many bastard children,

288
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
she lost track of them.

289
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Then, by sheer coincidence, had an affair with one,

290
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
and got re-inbred pregnant,

291
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
producing a super inbred double bastard,

292
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
who is also a possible tutor heir.

293
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You could have been a king, Edward.

294
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And your son, after you.

295
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Elizabeth doesn't seem to know that

296
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
de Vere is her bio-son,

297
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
despite the fact that he eventually does.

298
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
She also doesn't seem batty and boy-crazy and weird,

299
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
like Queenie,

300
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
yet she'll just bang whoever.

301
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I love him!

302
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Someone tell Roland Emmerich that bastard children

303
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
are kinda harder for women to keep on the DL.

304
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Man, it sure is weird that the Queen keeps disappearing

305
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
for these nine-month intervals, huh?

306
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
This Elizabeth is not much with the priorities.

307
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I can do what I want.

308
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And is later duped into thinking that the Earl of Essex

309
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
and the ultra-bastard Southampton

310
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
are trying to organize a coup against her,

311
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
when really it's an oopsie-daisy misunderstanding

312
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
orchestrated by the real bad guys.

313
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
But upon finding out that the Earl of Southampton is his son,

314
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
OG bastard dad-brother de Vere begs for his life,

315
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
so Elizabeth just exiles Southampton or something

316
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
in exchange for de Vere's name never being on his works

317
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
for some reason.

318
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
None of your poems or your plays

319
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
will ever carry your name.

320
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And this isn't just some weird shit that Roland dreamed up.

321
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Shakespeare truthers actually believe this.

322
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Anonymous!

323
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Choosing which versions of Elizabeth to cover in this episode

324
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
was a bit of a stacked deck,

325
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
because there are so, so many out there,

326
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and what constitutes fictionalized varies really based on who you ask.

327
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Many versions try to straddle this line between dramatic and historically accurate,

328
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
but they're probably going to choose drama over accuracy.

329
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Others, not so much.

330
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And I think maybe they think they are?

331
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Why does this exist?

332
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
So with that in mind, it is funny that the further you get from a historical event,

333
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
the more okay it is to appropriate someone's life for your fictional narrative.

334
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
There was a wager, I remember,

335
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
as to whether a play could show the very truth and nature of love.

336
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I think you lost it today.

337
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Or your dumbass conspiracy theory.

338
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
None.

339
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
That said, in a way, I think that makes looking at people who actually existed

340
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
kind of more interesting than fictional characters.

341
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So that's it for this one.

342
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
If you want to help me decide on themes for new episodes,

343
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
you can do so on Patreon,

344
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
and you can also support the show here

345
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
If you want to find out updates on upcoming shows and other projects,

346
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I am on Twitter, which is here.

347
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Thank you for watching, and next month we have a very special episode.

348
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
By popular demand.

349
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yeah, it will be fun.
