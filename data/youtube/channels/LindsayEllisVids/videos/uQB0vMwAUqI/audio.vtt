00:00.000 --> 00:08.140
So, after having been an option to vote for for three episodes now, I think it's finally Mystique time.

00:17.140 --> 00:22.380
Yeah, I kept putting Mystique as an option to vote for because she's one of my favorite X-Men characters,

00:22.380 --> 00:25.420
so I figured she had to win sooner or later.

00:25.460 --> 00:31.820
So, through various iterations and some wild costume changes, what makes Mystique Mystique?

00:31.820 --> 00:37.420
Where other X-Men villains exhibit more traditionally masculine bad guy traits, anger, arrogance,

00:37.420 --> 00:43.900
and from a power standpoint, they tended to be more strength-focused or exerting control over stuff-focused,

00:43.900 --> 00:49.660
Mystique exhibits a roster of historically feminine evils, and her entire run with the X-Men and their periphery

00:49.660 --> 00:54.460
when she's not being an outright villain includes being a double agent, joining the X-Men,

00:54.460 --> 00:59.420
betraying the X-Men, and using her sexuality as a weapon a lot.

00:59.420 --> 01:02.940
Being duplicitous as a feminine archetype is as old as the written word.

01:02.940 --> 01:08.860
Many Western mythologies feature feminine figures that presents themselves as one thing,

01:08.860 --> 01:14.060
usually to lure men into some false sense of security, only to eventually spell their doom.

01:14.060 --> 01:19.340
The Sirens lured sailors to their deaths, Delilah seduced and then metaphorically castrated Samson,

01:19.340 --> 01:24.940
and Mystique's power is to present herself as one thing while always having a secret ulterior motive.

01:24.940 --> 01:30.220
Female science fiction characters written in the 1970s by male writers were an interesting bag,

01:30.220 --> 01:35.260
because there was a lot of anxiety about this whole nascent women's lib thing.

01:35.260 --> 01:39.580
Even her name Mystique harkens to Mystique comma The Feminine,

01:39.580 --> 01:43.100
a book which completely changed the way American women saw themselves.

01:43.100 --> 01:46.780
So it's fitting that she first appears in Ms. Marvel's original series,

01:46.780 --> 01:51.180
as she is the embodiment of the 70s Wonder Woman you've come a long way baby attitude.

01:51.180 --> 01:56.300
And all of this background, to be honest, is what allows her to be interesting.

01:56.300 --> 02:01.180
Mystique is all of these fear of female sexuality archetypes packaged into one character,

02:01.180 --> 02:06.300
who still manages to be one of the most interesting and textured and nuanced of all the X-Men characters.

02:06.300 --> 02:09.660
And like most ex-villains, she's only, you know, sometimes a villain.

02:09.660 --> 02:14.060
She joins the X-Men, then unjoins them and tries to seduce her daughter's boyfriend

02:14.060 --> 02:16.460
so she can break them up and set Rogue up with someone else.

02:16.460 --> 02:17.580
You know, the ush.

02:17.580 --> 02:20.780
She eventually betrays the X-Men, of course, but only sort of.

02:20.780 --> 02:23.180
And then eventually gets killed, but don't worry, she gets better.

02:23.180 --> 02:27.420
At one point, she's even Professor X's indentured servant in her unlimited series,

02:27.420 --> 02:31.900
called Mystique, written by Brian K. Vaughan, which is kind of James Bond inspired,

02:31.900 --> 02:34.060
and yep, once again, she's a double agent.

02:34.060 --> 02:36.860
So because this always needs to be pointed out, apparently,

02:37.420 --> 02:43.420
having a character's basis in misogynist archetypes as old as time is not necessarily a bad thing,

02:43.500 --> 02:46.060
as long as those archetypes don't go unexamined.

02:47.100 --> 02:47.980
But it is a thing.

02:49.420 --> 02:53.260
In X-Men, the animated series, Mystique gets pretty much all the major character beats

02:53.260 --> 02:55.100
we'd already seen in the comics up to that point.

02:55.820 --> 02:58.620
I swore one day I'd get you back.

02:58.620 --> 03:01.580
Today is that day, my daughter.

03:01.580 --> 03:04.940
Excluding actually joining the X-Men that happened later.

03:04.940 --> 03:09.740
She pals around with pretty much all the big bads and ends up being used as a puppet a lot.

03:10.380 --> 03:12.060
He wants to destroy everything!

03:12.620 --> 03:14.140
I had to help him!

03:14.780 --> 03:16.300
He would have killed me!

03:16.300 --> 03:19.100
He has a secret command center.

03:19.100 --> 03:21.340
What an interesting line read.

03:21.340 --> 03:24.860
Okay, now say it like you don't know what words mean.

03:24.860 --> 03:27.500
Buried under Stonehenge in England.

03:27.500 --> 03:31.740
But her big episodes center around, of course, Rogue and Nightcrawler,

03:31.740 --> 03:33.740
and even Graydon Creed gets a name drop,

03:33.740 --> 03:39.660
although the being everyone's mother thing is handled a lot less deftly in the cartoon.

03:39.660 --> 03:41.180
She's Nightcrawler's mother!

03:42.060 --> 03:43.260
And Creed's mother, too!

03:43.900 --> 03:45.020
And Beasts!

03:45.020 --> 03:46.300
And the Professors!

03:46.300 --> 03:47.980
And Colin Firth's!

03:47.980 --> 03:49.020
And Optimus Pr-

03:49.020 --> 03:49.980
Okay, you get the idea.

03:49.980 --> 03:53.660
You know, people like you are the reason I was afraid to go to school as a child.

03:53.660 --> 03:59.820
But then came the movies, and here she's Magneto's right-hand acrobat spy.

03:59.820 --> 04:04.060
A slight departure from the comics, as Mystique rarely has anything to do with Magneto,

04:04.060 --> 04:07.020
aside from reforming the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.

04:07.020 --> 04:10.780
But we gotta consolidate so in adaptations they're almost always working together.

04:10.780 --> 04:15.500
And honestly, I think Rebecca Romijn doesn't get enough credit for being such a great physical actor.

04:15.500 --> 04:18.860
Mystique has, like, two lines in this movie, and one of them is-

04:20.300 --> 04:24.220
But you know so much about her just by the way she moves, her expressions.

04:24.220 --> 04:25.420
Can you shut it down from here?

04:26.300 --> 04:27.100
No.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.620
She is alien, and the alien-ness is coded villainy,

04:30.620 --> 04:33.180
but her motivations are clear and sympathetic,

04:33.180 --> 04:36.220
and you can tell it took her a long while to get to that point.

04:36.220 --> 04:40.380
Also, unlike in first class, the relationship between Magneto and Mystique is

04:40.380 --> 04:42.060
all subtext.

04:42.060 --> 04:43.740
They share laughs sometimes.

04:44.540 --> 04:46.460
When will these people learn how to fly?

04:47.500 --> 04:50.540
They seem to be friends, but really they're more political allies.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.580
Their relationship doesn't have any sexual overtones,

04:53.580 --> 04:56.460
but this is probably because Magneto is gay.

04:56.460 --> 04:57.900
And Charles is gay.

04:57.900 --> 04:58.860
What are you doing here?

04:59.980 --> 05:03.020
Why do you ask questions to which you already know the answers?

05:03.580 --> 05:04.940
And they are bitter exes.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.260
You're sneaking around in here, Charles.

05:08.300 --> 05:10.060
Whatever are you looking for?

05:10.060 --> 05:11.740
And Mystique is over here like,

05:11.740 --> 05:13.740
my name's Paul, this is between y'all.

05:14.300 --> 05:16.540
Coinciding with the release of the first movie

05:16.540 --> 05:19.740
came another animated series called X-Men Evolution,

05:19.740 --> 05:22.140
which set itself apart from the earlier animated series

05:22.140 --> 05:23.980
by making it more of a high school drama

05:23.980 --> 05:26.860
and having most of the characters be high school age,

05:26.860 --> 05:28.860
aside from a smattering of minter figures.

05:28.860 --> 05:32.060
But for some reason, the kids who go to Xavier's school

05:32.060 --> 05:34.620
also go to the local public high school

05:34.620 --> 05:36.380
where Mystique is moonlighting-

05:37.100 --> 05:38.060
daylighting?

05:38.060 --> 05:39.900
As principal Darkholm.

05:39.900 --> 05:40.620
Principal Dark-

05:41.340 --> 05:42.220
You're Mystique?

05:42.780 --> 05:45.740
Something Professor Xavier neglected to tell you.

05:45.740 --> 05:48.700
And Xavier knows about this, but doesn't tell anyone?

05:49.260 --> 05:51.020
Again, Mystique is working with Magneto,

05:51.020 --> 05:53.580
who did some horrible thing to Nightcrawler

05:53.580 --> 05:54.620
at some point in history.

05:55.340 --> 05:57.660
Monster! What have you done to him?

05:57.660 --> 06:00.140
We get to the Who's Your Mama episodes pretty early on,

06:00.140 --> 06:01.660
first with Nightcrawler-

06:01.660 --> 06:03.660
Um, no!

06:03.660 --> 06:05.260
And then with Rogue.

06:05.260 --> 06:07.340
I adopted you when you were four.

06:07.340 --> 06:08.060
No!

06:08.060 --> 06:09.420
Search the memories.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.340
You are my daughter.

06:11.340 --> 06:14.300
Destiny is here in this version as Mystique's best friend,

06:14.300 --> 06:16.860
and she helped raise Rogue, who, once again,

06:16.860 --> 06:19.980
does not remember being raised by Mystique in this version.

06:20.540 --> 06:23.020
This was not a thing in the comics, by the way.

06:23.020 --> 06:25.900
So at this point, Mystique the toxic mother figure

06:25.900 --> 06:28.460
was a popular route for her character.

06:28.460 --> 06:31.260
But I only posed as your friend so I could be near you.

06:31.260 --> 06:34.460
Which is, of course, interesting and gives her a good source of conflict.

06:34.460 --> 06:36.140
It's just too bad it didn't really go anywhere.

06:36.700 --> 06:37.580
You want another beer?

06:38.540 --> 06:42.060
Ah, here we are again with the using sexuality as a means to dupe men.

06:43.260 --> 06:43.820
Velcro.

06:44.780 --> 06:45.500
Nice.

06:45.500 --> 06:48.700
In X-Men 2, after discovering some integral plot stuff,

06:48.700 --> 06:50.780
she helps Magneto escape from prison,

06:50.780 --> 06:54.540
and then they help the X-Men for a while before their sudden but inevitable betrayal.

06:55.180 --> 06:59.180
It's kind of hinted in the first movie that she gets the hots for Wolverine when she fights him.

07:00.380 --> 07:01.820
You know, some ladies are into that.

07:01.820 --> 07:04.060
No one's ever left a scar quite like you.

07:04.060 --> 07:06.060
She does want to nail Wolverine at one point,

07:06.460 --> 07:09.260
seemingly for no reason other than she wants to get her some.

07:09.900 --> 07:11.660
But this scene does give us one of the more

07:11.660 --> 07:14.220
unintentionally hilarious moments in the whole franchise.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.780
Oh yeah, that's what I want.

07:18.780 --> 07:20.620
I likes me that Brian Cox.

07:21.180 --> 07:25.900
She also gives us the most concise summation of the whole X-Men universe conflict,

07:25.900 --> 07:28.620
and really any oppressed minority conflict.

07:28.620 --> 07:30.780
Then why not stay in disguise all the time?

07:31.820 --> 07:35.180
You know, look like everyone else.

07:36.140 --> 07:37.340
Because we shouldn't have to.

07:38.220 --> 07:39.580
You can't argue with that.

07:39.580 --> 07:41.180
And really, that's all we need to know.

07:45.740 --> 07:49.340
In fairness, not one character goes unfucked in X-Men 3,

07:49.340 --> 07:53.180
so I won't say Mystique gets the shaft in an exceptional sense,

07:53.180 --> 07:55.900
because every character in this movie does, but...

07:55.900 --> 07:57.260
Braven, I asked you a question.

07:58.540 --> 08:00.380
I don't answer to my slave name.

08:00.380 --> 08:02.540
Is there anything unawful about this movie?

08:06.060 --> 08:15.660
This moment.

08:15.660 --> 08:17.340
This moment isn't terrible.

08:17.340 --> 08:18.220
And that's it.

08:18.220 --> 08:21.580
And no, the most obvious casting choice in history does not make this movie good,

08:21.580 --> 08:23.580
really, that just makes it more of a tragic waste.

08:23.580 --> 08:25.500
X-Men 3 combines two storylines,

08:25.500 --> 08:28.380
the cure for mutation storyline and the Dark Phoenix storyline.

08:28.940 --> 08:31.260
Two plots that have f*** all to do with each other,

08:31.260 --> 08:33.980
and it's done about as clumsily as one can imagine.

08:33.980 --> 08:36.860
Fairly early on in the movie, she's been caught by the cure people,

08:36.860 --> 08:39.500
so Magneto goes to all this trouble to save her,

08:39.500 --> 08:42.540
and then she takes a bullet for Magneto and gets depowered.

08:42.540 --> 08:45.180
So now she's human, and Magneto's like,

08:45.180 --> 08:45.980
Bye, Felicia.

08:48.620 --> 08:49.660
I'm sorry, my dear.

08:51.660 --> 08:53.500
You're not one of us anymore.

08:53.500 --> 08:54.940
So how'd she react to this?

08:55.740 --> 08:58.220
Yep, woman scorned.

08:58.220 --> 09:01.020
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

09:01.020 --> 09:04.060
Like, those are literally the words that they use in the movie.

09:04.060 --> 09:07.020
Yeah, forget her militant mutant supremacy beliefs,

09:07.020 --> 09:10.620
one guy screws her over and she's ready to throw all of mutantkind under the bus.

09:11.260 --> 09:12.860
Basically off-screen.

09:12.860 --> 09:16.620
Like, if there's one feminine archetype Mystique didn't get, it was woman scorned,

09:16.620 --> 09:18.540
but now we can check that one off, too.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.380
Like, this has got to be pretty traumatic for her, right?

09:22.380 --> 09:26.460
Might be interesting to see her, like, wrestle with this new identity.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.780
She gave us everything we wanted and more.

09:28.780 --> 09:30.540
You know.

09:35.260 --> 09:39.100
Carmen Electra plays a Mystique parody in epic movie, which...

09:41.740 --> 09:45.340
You know, I think you could probably call the nadir of that franchise.

09:45.340 --> 09:48.220
I like a lot of junk in the trunk.

09:48.220 --> 09:49.260
Kinky.

09:53.260 --> 09:53.760
Yeah.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.420
Like a fat blue Britney Spears.

09:58.300 --> 09:59.180
You know what's funny?

10:01.180 --> 10:01.680
Fat.

10:03.340 --> 10:03.900
Come here!

10:05.980 --> 10:09.260
This so warrants existing.

10:09.260 --> 10:11.180
Let's make this interesting.

10:11.180 --> 10:14.620
Compared to shows in the 90s where you can pretty much jump on at any point

10:14.620 --> 10:19.900
and not really have missed anything, Wolverine and the X-Men has more of a grown-up 2000s

10:19.900 --> 10:22.540
bent with a season-long storyline.

10:22.540 --> 10:24.140
It's more of a mini-series.

10:24.700 --> 10:28.220
Think about this show as it's an ensemble piece to a point that's almost frustrating.

10:28.220 --> 10:31.100
Everyone gets an episode or two, but besides Wolverine,

10:31.100 --> 10:34.460
no one gets any real character development over any length of time

10:34.460 --> 10:36.380
because there's just so damn many characters.

10:36.940 --> 10:40.140
One way both Evolution and the original animated series were stronger.

10:40.140 --> 10:44.140
Anyway, once again, she has a past with Wolverine because everyone does.

10:44.140 --> 10:46.380
You really don't remember me, Logan?

10:46.380 --> 10:48.060
Because I remember you.

10:49.020 --> 10:51.340
And instead of her relationship with Rogue and Nightcrawler,

10:51.340 --> 10:52.860
that's the one they decide to play up.

10:53.740 --> 10:56.940
The man who sacrificed himself so I could get away.

10:58.220 --> 10:58.860
He's gone.

10:59.500 --> 11:02.700
She was also in an episode of the Superhero Squad show.

11:02.700 --> 11:06.060
This one I only feel really merits mentioning because she's voiced by Lena Headey.

11:07.180 --> 11:09.900
Your plan is a complete success, Dr. Doom.

11:09.900 --> 11:11.820
The path to the fractals is clear.

11:11.820 --> 11:12.540
You know.

11:12.540 --> 11:15.420
When you play the Game of Thrones, you win or you die.

11:15.980 --> 11:18.780
Finally, let's look at Mystique as played by Jennifer Lawrence,

11:18.780 --> 11:24.060
who is, aside from having the same makeup, functionally a completely different character

11:24.060 --> 11:25.820
from the one we saw in the first three movies.

11:26.460 --> 11:27.500
First two movies.

11:27.500 --> 11:32.140
Like, I'm not even really gonna try and parse why they decided to go this route with Mystique,

11:32.140 --> 11:35.740
and I don't think it really works until we get today's a future pass,

11:35.740 --> 11:37.020
but here's what we got.

11:37.020 --> 11:41.100
It's kind of like Star Trek, where I guess we've got two diverging timelines now

11:41.100 --> 11:45.660
with mildly differing origins,

11:45.660 --> 11:47.900
or the original got retconned altogether,

11:47.900 --> 11:49.980
which is a bummer because that means X2 didn't happen,

11:49.980 --> 11:52.700
but on the plus side, that means The Last Stand didn't happen either.

11:53.740 --> 11:54.940
Then God help us.

11:54.940 --> 11:57.500
Well, either way, The Last Stand got double retconned,

11:57.500 --> 12:00.780
as even in the dystopian future, everything that happened in The Last Stand

12:00.780 --> 12:02.140
just completely goes ignored.

12:02.700 --> 12:07.020
Okay, but here's where I don't buy that First Class is supposed to be an honest-to-God prequel

12:07.020 --> 12:09.100
instead of an alternate universe.

12:09.100 --> 12:09.980
Will you read to me?

12:09.980 --> 12:12.540
Can't. I have my thesis coming up. I have to study.

12:12.540 --> 12:15.420
Fine, read that. Your thesis always tells me right off.

12:15.500 --> 12:18.780
We never get any kind of indication that Professor X and Mystique

12:18.780 --> 12:21.260
have any kind of history at all in the first three,

12:21.260 --> 12:24.540
let alone that they grew up together and she was secretly in love with him,

12:24.540 --> 12:25.740
but he was all like,

12:25.740 --> 12:31.020
ew, my sister slash maybe there's some underlying internalized mutantism,

12:32.140 --> 12:35.100
mis-mutanty, mutant Haiti.

12:35.740 --> 12:36.460
Would you date me?

12:37.100 --> 12:37.820
Of course I would.

12:38.380 --> 12:41.420
And a young man would be lucky to have you. You're stunning.

12:41.420 --> 12:42.220
Looking like this.

12:43.500 --> 12:44.000
What?

12:44.720 --> 12:47.040
Anyway, they grew up together and she's kind of bitter

12:47.040 --> 12:49.760
because Xavier doesn't want her in her natural form,

12:49.760 --> 12:51.040
you know, in the biblical sense.

12:51.920 --> 12:54.320
Mutant and proud.

12:55.280 --> 12:58.400
And then Beast doesn't either for his own self-Haiti reasons.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.560
My feet, in your natural blue form,

13:02.080 --> 13:03.280
never be deemed beautiful.

13:09.200 --> 13:10.320
You look beautiful now.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.800
Damn, that's cold, Beast.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.640
But hey, Magneto thinks she's hot.

13:15.440 --> 13:17.120
You're an exquisite creature, Raven.

13:19.040 --> 13:19.760
Yeah.

13:19.760 --> 13:21.840
All your life, the world has tried to tame you.

13:23.120 --> 13:24.480
It's time for you to be free.

13:24.480 --> 13:26.720
And that's why she joins Magneto.

13:27.520 --> 13:30.480
Anyway, it's not as simple as Magneto wants to bum buglies with her

13:30.480 --> 13:32.080
and that's why she defects,

13:32.080 --> 13:36.080
and there is something powerful to her wanting to be accepted for who she is,

13:36.080 --> 13:38.400
and that being why she chooses Magneto's side,

13:38.400 --> 13:42.240
but it definitely has this boys don't think I'm pretty undertone.

13:42.240 --> 13:42.960
Would you date me?

13:44.080 --> 13:46.240
Yeah, I'm not a big fan of first class.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.960
Fortunately, then came Days of Future Past,

13:48.960 --> 13:52.080
by and large considered the other good one,

13:52.080 --> 13:55.520
and here's where Mystique's character veering off into a totally different direction

13:55.520 --> 13:56.800
becomes more concrete,

13:56.800 --> 13:59.680
and this, I think, is largely actress-oriented.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.120
Could you pass me my robe?

14:01.120 --> 14:04.720
I think first class is meant to show young Mystique as literally young and naive,

14:04.720 --> 14:08.240
and she'll grow into that quiet, solemn, confident Rebecca Romijn,

14:08.240 --> 14:12.000
but in Days of Future Past, she's not really made any progress in that direction,

14:12.080 --> 14:17.120
and that, in no small part, is because this Mystique is more Katniss than, well, Mystique.

14:17.120 --> 14:19.600
The screenwriters also kind of came to see Mystique

14:19.600 --> 14:24.160
as the sort of cross-pollination between Erik and Charles' respective philosophies,

14:24.160 --> 14:28.160
which is why this version ends up being defined more by internal conflict

14:28.160 --> 14:31.280
than by straight-up mutant rights.

14:32.160 --> 14:36.000
Unlike the confident, quietly angry ideologue in the first three movies,

14:36.000 --> 14:37.920
this Mystique is wracked with conflict,

14:37.920 --> 14:40.720
and unlike the Romijn version, who doesn't flinch at violence,

14:40.720 --> 14:43.040
she seems uncomfortable with the idea of killing.

14:43.040 --> 14:45.120
All your life, the world has tried to tame you.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.440
There's always been an undercurrent in the X-Men movies

14:47.440 --> 14:50.400
about Professor X trying to control the women in his life,

14:50.400 --> 14:53.760
handled with profound clumsiness in the last stand.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.080
Days of Future Past makes this a rather overt theme,

14:56.080 --> 14:58.800
with the main plot centering around Wolverine going back in time

14:58.800 --> 15:01.440
to try and prevent Mystique from assassinating Peter Dinklage,

15:01.440 --> 15:03.840
and thereby eventually preventing the robo-apocalypse.

15:03.840 --> 15:08.880
So the story is ultimately resolved when X accepts that, no, he cannot control her,

15:08.880 --> 15:11.520
but instead appealing to her better nature.

15:12.720 --> 15:15.920
I've been trying to control you ever since the day we met.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.080
And look what that's got us.

15:18.640 --> 15:19.920
Which is funny because in the comics,

15:19.920 --> 15:23.600
there's a scene where she makes fun of Forge for doing the exact same thing.

15:23.600 --> 15:28.320
New Mystique's arc comes to its logical end in Apocalypse with her joining the X-Men.

15:28.320 --> 15:33.040
She is not a mutant terrorist, nor is she a killer, so this was kind of inevitable.

15:33.040 --> 15:35.600
Because of her actions at the end of Days of Future Past,

15:35.600 --> 15:38.800
she has by Apocalypse become a hero to mutants all over.

15:38.800 --> 15:42.560
A figure of both power and peace, and she is uncomfortable with this

15:42.560 --> 15:44.400
and decides not to live in her blue form

15:44.400 --> 15:47.120
because Jennifer Lawrence did not want to sit in the makeup chair anymore.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.520
I mean because she didn't want attention.

15:49.520 --> 15:52.640
Seriously, Jennifer Lawrence is so checked out in this movie,

15:52.640 --> 15:54.720
they may have well have just filmed a literal phone.

15:57.440 --> 16:01.120
Although her getting choked by Apocalypse did feature heavily in the marketing of this movie.

16:01.680 --> 16:02.960
So that was a thing.

16:02.960 --> 16:07.200
But anyway, Apocalypse Mystique is a far cry from this Mystique.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.960
Not that that's a bad thing.

16:08.960 --> 16:14.400
Honestly, if there is a character that can handle an increasingly wide swath of character traits,

16:14.400 --> 16:15.760
it's Mystique.

16:15.760 --> 16:19.760
And it's interesting to think that a somewhat minor character was in the running

16:19.760 --> 16:24.560
to eventually get her own Wolverine-style, probably not very good X-Men spin-off

16:25.120 --> 16:30.160
if certain actresses weren't so eager to get out of their contracts and not be painted blue anymore.

16:30.160 --> 16:35.440
But I think it also speaks to how there is more of a demand for complex femme fatales nowadays.

16:35.440 --> 16:39.760
That's why we've got sympathetic, maleficent Elsa, the misunderstood ice queen,

16:39.760 --> 16:42.160
the wicked witch was an animal lover the whole time,

16:42.160 --> 16:46.640
and Mystique, once such a confident hard-ass, is now wracked with conflict and insecurity.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.960
But I think it works either way.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.840
We don't need her to necessarily choose.

16:51.840 --> 16:54.800
She is, after all, a shapeshifter.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.640
Because we shouldn't have to.

16:57.840 --> 16:59.360
And thank you for watching.

16:59.360 --> 17:01.520
Thank you very much to patrons on Patreon.

17:02.240 --> 17:04.880
I'm going to do a vote again next month.

17:05.520 --> 17:09.280
But the next couple episodes, executive decision.

17:09.280 --> 17:11.360
Because it's my turn again.

17:11.360 --> 17:12.400
Because I can.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.200
And I'm in a mood.

17:13.920 --> 17:14.800
See you next time.
