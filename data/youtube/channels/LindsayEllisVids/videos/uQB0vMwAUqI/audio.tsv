0	8140	So, after having been an option to vote for for three episodes now, I think it's finally Mystique time.
17140	22380	Yeah, I kept putting Mystique as an option to vote for because she's one of my favorite X-Men characters,
22380	25420	so I figured she had to win sooner or later.
25460	31820	So, through various iterations and some wild costume changes, what makes Mystique Mystique?
31820	37420	Where other X-Men villains exhibit more traditionally masculine bad guy traits, anger, arrogance,
37420	43900	and from a power standpoint, they tended to be more strength-focused or exerting control over stuff-focused,
43900	49660	Mystique exhibits a roster of historically feminine evils, and her entire run with the X-Men and their periphery
49660	54460	when she's not being an outright villain includes being a double agent, joining the X-Men,
54460	59420	betraying the X-Men, and using her sexuality as a weapon a lot.
59420	62940	Being duplicitous as a feminine archetype is as old as the written word.
62940	68860	Many Western mythologies feature feminine figures that presents themselves as one thing,
68860	74060	usually to lure men into some false sense of security, only to eventually spell their doom.
74060	79340	The Sirens lured sailors to their deaths, Delilah seduced and then metaphorically castrated Samson,
79340	84940	and Mystique's power is to present herself as one thing while always having a secret ulterior motive.
84940	90220	Female science fiction characters written in the 1970s by male writers were an interesting bag,
90220	95260	because there was a lot of anxiety about this whole nascent women's lib thing.
95260	99580	Even her name Mystique harkens to Mystique comma The Feminine,
99580	103100	a book which completely changed the way American women saw themselves.
103100	106780	So it's fitting that she first appears in Ms. Marvel's original series,
106780	111180	as she is the embodiment of the 70s Wonder Woman you've come a long way baby attitude.
111180	116300	And all of this background, to be honest, is what allows her to be interesting.
116300	121180	Mystique is all of these fear of female sexuality archetypes packaged into one character,
121180	126300	who still manages to be one of the most interesting and textured and nuanced of all the X-Men characters.
126300	129660	And like most ex-villains, she's only, you know, sometimes a villain.
129660	134060	She joins the X-Men, then unjoins them and tries to seduce her daughter's boyfriend
134060	136460	so she can break them up and set Rogue up with someone else.
136460	137580	You know, the ush.
137580	140780	She eventually betrays the X-Men, of course, but only sort of.
140780	143180	And then eventually gets killed, but don't worry, she gets better.
143180	147420	At one point, she's even Professor X's indentured servant in her unlimited series,
147420	151900	called Mystique, written by Brian K. Vaughan, which is kind of James Bond inspired,
151900	154060	and yep, once again, she's a double agent.
154060	156860	So because this always needs to be pointed out, apparently,
157420	163420	having a character's basis in misogynist archetypes as old as time is not necessarily a bad thing,
163500	166060	as long as those archetypes don't go unexamined.
167100	167980	But it is a thing.
169420	173260	In X-Men, the animated series, Mystique gets pretty much all the major character beats
173260	175100	we'd already seen in the comics up to that point.
175820	178620	I swore one day I'd get you back.
178620	181580	Today is that day, my daughter.
181580	184940	Excluding actually joining the X-Men that happened later.
184940	189740	She pals around with pretty much all the big bads and ends up being used as a puppet a lot.
190380	192060	He wants to destroy everything!
192620	194140	I had to help him!
194780	196300	He would have killed me!
196300	199100	He has a secret command center.
199100	201340	What an interesting line read.
201340	204860	Okay, now say it like you don't know what words mean.
204860	207500	Buried under Stonehenge in England.
207500	211740	But her big episodes center around, of course, Rogue and Nightcrawler,
211740	213740	and even Graydon Creed gets a name drop,
213740	219660	although the being everyone's mother thing is handled a lot less deftly in the cartoon.
219660	221180	She's Nightcrawler's mother!
222060	223260	And Creed's mother, too!
223900	225020	And Beasts!
225020	226300	And the Professors!
226300	227980	And Colin Firth's!
227980	229020	And Optimus Pr-
229020	229980	Okay, you get the idea.
229980	233660	You know, people like you are the reason I was afraid to go to school as a child.
233660	239820	But then came the movies, and here she's Magneto's right-hand acrobat spy.
239820	244060	A slight departure from the comics, as Mystique rarely has anything to do with Magneto,
244060	247020	aside from reforming the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.
247020	250780	But we gotta consolidate so in adaptations they're almost always working together.
250780	255500	And honestly, I think Rebecca Romijn doesn't get enough credit for being such a great physical actor.
255500	258860	Mystique has, like, two lines in this movie, and one of them is-
260300	264220	But you know so much about her just by the way she moves, her expressions.
264220	265420	Can you shut it down from here?
266300	267100	No.
267100	270620	She is alien, and the alien-ness is coded villainy,
270620	273180	but her motivations are clear and sympathetic,
273180	276220	and you can tell it took her a long while to get to that point.
276220	280380	Also, unlike in first class, the relationship between Magneto and Mystique is
280380	282060	all subtext.
282060	283740	They share laughs sometimes.
284540	286460	When will these people learn how to fly?
287500	290540	They seem to be friends, but really they're more political allies.
290540	293580	Their relationship doesn't have any sexual overtones,
293580	296460	but this is probably because Magneto is gay.
296460	297900	And Charles is gay.
297900	298860	What are you doing here?
299980	303020	Why do you ask questions to which you already know the answers?
303580	304940	And they are bitter exes.
305500	307260	You're sneaking around in here, Charles.
308300	310060	Whatever are you looking for?
310060	311740	And Mystique is over here like,
311740	313740	my name's Paul, this is between y'all.
314300	316540	Coinciding with the release of the first movie
316540	319740	came another animated series called X-Men Evolution,
319740	322140	which set itself apart from the earlier animated series
322140	323980	by making it more of a high school drama
323980	326860	and having most of the characters be high school age,
326860	328860	aside from a smattering of minter figures.
328860	332060	But for some reason, the kids who go to Xavier's school
332060	334620	also go to the local public high school
334620	336380	where Mystique is moonlighting-
337100	338060	daylighting?
338060	339900	As principal Darkholm.
339900	340620	Principal Dark-
341340	342220	You're Mystique?
342780	345740	Something Professor Xavier neglected to tell you.
345740	348700	And Xavier knows about this, but doesn't tell anyone?
349260	351020	Again, Mystique is working with Magneto,
351020	353580	who did some horrible thing to Nightcrawler
353580	354620	at some point in history.
355340	357660	Monster! What have you done to him?
357660	360140	We get to the Who's Your Mama episodes pretty early on,
360140	361660	first with Nightcrawler-
361660	363660	Um, no!
363660	365260	And then with Rogue.
365260	367340	I adopted you when you were four.
367340	368060	No!
368060	369420	Search the memories.
369500	371340	You are my daughter.
371340	374300	Destiny is here in this version as Mystique's best friend,
374300	376860	and she helped raise Rogue, who, once again,
376860	379980	does not remember being raised by Mystique in this version.
380540	383020	This was not a thing in the comics, by the way.
383020	385900	So at this point, Mystique the toxic mother figure
385900	388460	was a popular route for her character.
388460	391260	But I only posed as your friend so I could be near you.
391260	394460	Which is, of course, interesting and gives her a good source of conflict.
394460	396140	It's just too bad it didn't really go anywhere.
396700	397580	You want another beer?
398540	402060	Ah, here we are again with the using sexuality as a means to dupe men.
403260	403820	Velcro.
404780	405500	Nice.
405500	408700	In X-Men 2, after discovering some integral plot stuff,
408700	410780	she helps Magneto escape from prison,
410780	414540	and then they help the X-Men for a while before their sudden but inevitable betrayal.
415180	419180	It's kind of hinted in the first movie that she gets the hots for Wolverine when she fights him.
420380	421820	You know, some ladies are into that.
421820	424060	No one's ever left a scar quite like you.
424060	426060	She does want to nail Wolverine at one point,
426460	429260	seemingly for no reason other than she wants to get her some.
429900	431660	But this scene does give us one of the more
431660	434220	unintentionally hilarious moments in the whole franchise.
437020	438780	Oh yeah, that's what I want.
438780	440620	I likes me that Brian Cox.
441180	445900	She also gives us the most concise summation of the whole X-Men universe conflict,
445900	448620	and really any oppressed minority conflict.
448620	450780	Then why not stay in disguise all the time?
451820	455180	You know, look like everyone else.
456140	457340	Because we shouldn't have to.
458220	459580	You can't argue with that.
459580	461180	And really, that's all we need to know.
465740	469340	In fairness, not one character goes unfucked in X-Men 3,
469340	473180	so I won't say Mystique gets the shaft in an exceptional sense,
473180	475900	because every character in this movie does, but...
475900	477260	Braven, I asked you a question.
478540	480380	I don't answer to my slave name.
480380	482540	Is there anything unawful about this movie?
486060	495660	This moment.
495660	497340	This moment isn't terrible.
497340	498220	And that's it.
498220	501580	And no, the most obvious casting choice in history does not make this movie good,
501580	503580	really, that just makes it more of a tragic waste.
503580	505500	X-Men 3 combines two storylines,
505500	508380	the cure for mutation storyline and the Dark Phoenix storyline.
508940	511260	Two plots that have f*** all to do with each other,
511260	513980	and it's done about as clumsily as one can imagine.
513980	516860	Fairly early on in the movie, she's been caught by the cure people,
516860	519500	so Magneto goes to all this trouble to save her,
519500	522540	and then she takes a bullet for Magneto and gets depowered.
522540	525180	So now she's human, and Magneto's like,
525180	525980	Bye, Felicia.
528620	529660	I'm sorry, my dear.
531660	533500	You're not one of us anymore.
533500	534940	So how'd she react to this?
535740	538220	Yep, woman scorned.
538220	541020	Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.
541020	544060	Like, those are literally the words that they use in the movie.
544060	547020	Yeah, forget her militant mutant supremacy beliefs,
547020	550620	one guy screws her over and she's ready to throw all of mutantkind under the bus.
551260	552860	Basically off-screen.
552860	556620	Like, if there's one feminine archetype Mystique didn't get, it was woman scorned,
556620	558540	but now we can check that one off, too.
559100	562380	Like, this has got to be pretty traumatic for her, right?
562380	566460	Might be interesting to see her, like, wrestle with this new identity.
567100	568780	She gave us everything we wanted and more.
568780	570540	You know.
575260	579100	Carmen Electra plays a Mystique parody in epic movie, which...
581740	585340	You know, I think you could probably call the nadir of that franchise.
585340	588220	I like a lot of junk in the trunk.
588220	589260	Kinky.
593260	593760	Yeah.
595500	597420	Like a fat blue Britney Spears.
598300	599180	You know what's funny?
601180	601680	Fat.
603340	603900	Come here!
605980	609260	This so warrants existing.
609260	611180	Let's make this interesting.
611180	614620	Compared to shows in the 90s where you can pretty much jump on at any point
614620	619900	and not really have missed anything, Wolverine and the X-Men has more of a grown-up 2000s
619900	622540	bent with a season-long storyline.
622540	624140	It's more of a mini-series.
624700	628220	Think about this show as it's an ensemble piece to a point that's almost frustrating.
628220	631100	Everyone gets an episode or two, but besides Wolverine,
631100	634460	no one gets any real character development over any length of time
634460	636380	because there's just so damn many characters.
636940	640140	One way both Evolution and the original animated series were stronger.
640140	644140	Anyway, once again, she has a past with Wolverine because everyone does.
644140	646380	You really don't remember me, Logan?
646380	648060	Because I remember you.
649020	651340	And instead of her relationship with Rogue and Nightcrawler,
651340	652860	that's the one they decide to play up.
653740	656940	The man who sacrificed himself so I could get away.
658220	658860	He's gone.
659500	662700	She was also in an episode of the Superhero Squad show.
662700	666060	This one I only feel really merits mentioning because she's voiced by Lena Headey.
667180	669900	Your plan is a complete success, Dr. Doom.
669900	671820	The path to the fractals is clear.
671820	672540	You know.
672540	675420	When you play the Game of Thrones, you win or you die.
675980	678780	Finally, let's look at Mystique as played by Jennifer Lawrence,
678780	684060	who is, aside from having the same makeup, functionally a completely different character
684060	685820	from the one we saw in the first three movies.
686460	687500	First two movies.
687500	692140	Like, I'm not even really gonna try and parse why they decided to go this route with Mystique,
692140	695740	and I don't think it really works until we get today's a future pass,
695740	697020	but here's what we got.
697020	701100	It's kind of like Star Trek, where I guess we've got two diverging timelines now
701100	705660	with mildly differing origins,
705660	707900	or the original got retconned altogether,
707900	709980	which is a bummer because that means X2 didn't happen,
709980	712700	but on the plus side, that means The Last Stand didn't happen either.
713740	714940	Then God help us.
714940	717500	Well, either way, The Last Stand got double retconned,
717500	720780	as even in the dystopian future, everything that happened in The Last Stand
720780	722140	just completely goes ignored.
722700	727020	Okay, but here's where I don't buy that First Class is supposed to be an honest-to-God prequel
727020	729100	instead of an alternate universe.
729100	729980	Will you read to me?
729980	732540	Can't. I have my thesis coming up. I have to study.
732540	735420	Fine, read that. Your thesis always tells me right off.
735500	738780	We never get any kind of indication that Professor X and Mystique
738780	741260	have any kind of history at all in the first three,
741260	744540	let alone that they grew up together and she was secretly in love with him,
744540	745740	but he was all like,
745740	751020	ew, my sister slash maybe there's some underlying internalized mutantism,
752140	755100	mis-mutanty, mutant Haiti.
755740	756460	Would you date me?
757100	757820	Of course I would.
758380	761420	And a young man would be lucky to have you. You're stunning.
761420	762220	Looking like this.
763500	764000	What?
764720	767040	Anyway, they grew up together and she's kind of bitter
767040	769760	because Xavier doesn't want her in her natural form,
769760	771040	you know, in the biblical sense.
771920	774320	Mutant and proud.
775280	778400	And then Beast doesn't either for his own self-Haiti reasons.
778400	780560	My feet, in your natural blue form,
782080	783280	never be deemed beautiful.
789200	790320	You look beautiful now.
791040	792800	Damn, that's cold, Beast.
792800	794640	But hey, Magneto thinks she's hot.
795440	797120	You're an exquisite creature, Raven.
799040	799760	Yeah.
799760	801840	All your life, the world has tried to tame you.
803120	804480	It's time for you to be free.
804480	806720	And that's why she joins Magneto.
807520	810480	Anyway, it's not as simple as Magneto wants to bum buglies with her
810480	812080	and that's why she defects,
812080	816080	and there is something powerful to her wanting to be accepted for who she is,
816080	818400	and that being why she chooses Magneto's side,
818400	822240	but it definitely has this boys don't think I'm pretty undertone.
822240	822960	Would you date me?
824080	826240	Yeah, I'm not a big fan of first class.
826960	828960	Fortunately, then came Days of Future Past,
828960	832080	by and large considered the other good one,
832080	835520	and here's where Mystique's character veering off into a totally different direction
835520	836800	becomes more concrete,
836800	839680	and this, I think, is largely actress-oriented.
839680	841120	Could you pass me my robe?
841120	844720	I think first class is meant to show young Mystique as literally young and naive,
844720	848240	and she'll grow into that quiet, solemn, confident Rebecca Romijn,
848240	852000	but in Days of Future Past, she's not really made any progress in that direction,
852080	857120	and that, in no small part, is because this Mystique is more Katniss than, well, Mystique.
857120	859600	The screenwriters also kind of came to see Mystique
859600	864160	as the sort of cross-pollination between Erik and Charles' respective philosophies,
864160	868160	which is why this version ends up being defined more by internal conflict
868160	871280	than by straight-up mutant rights.
872160	876000	Unlike the confident, quietly angry ideologue in the first three movies,
876000	877920	this Mystique is wracked with conflict,
877920	880720	and unlike the Romijn version, who doesn't flinch at violence,
880720	883040	she seems uncomfortable with the idea of killing.
883040	885120	All your life, the world has tried to tame you.
885120	887440	There's always been an undercurrent in the X-Men movies
887440	890400	about Professor X trying to control the women in his life,
890400	893760	handled with profound clumsiness in the last stand.
893760	896080	Days of Future Past makes this a rather overt theme,
896080	898800	with the main plot centering around Wolverine going back in time
898800	901440	to try and prevent Mystique from assassinating Peter Dinklage,
901440	903840	and thereby eventually preventing the robo-apocalypse.
903840	908880	So the story is ultimately resolved when X accepts that, no, he cannot control her,
908880	911520	but instead appealing to her better nature.
912720	915920	I've been trying to control you ever since the day we met.
916800	918080	And look what that's got us.
918640	919920	Which is funny because in the comics,
919920	923600	there's a scene where she makes fun of Forge for doing the exact same thing.
923600	928320	New Mystique's arc comes to its logical end in Apocalypse with her joining the X-Men.
928320	933040	She is not a mutant terrorist, nor is she a killer, so this was kind of inevitable.
933040	935600	Because of her actions at the end of Days of Future Past,
935600	938800	she has by Apocalypse become a hero to mutants all over.
938800	942560	A figure of both power and peace, and she is uncomfortable with this
942560	944400	and decides not to live in her blue form
944400	947120	because Jennifer Lawrence did not want to sit in the makeup chair anymore.
947120	949520	I mean because she didn't want attention.
949520	952640	Seriously, Jennifer Lawrence is so checked out in this movie,
952640	954720	they may have well have just filmed a literal phone.
957440	961120	Although her getting choked by Apocalypse did feature heavily in the marketing of this movie.
961680	962960	So that was a thing.
962960	967200	But anyway, Apocalypse Mystique is a far cry from this Mystique.
967200	968960	Not that that's a bad thing.
968960	974400	Honestly, if there is a character that can handle an increasingly wide swath of character traits,
974400	975760	it's Mystique.
975760	979760	And it's interesting to think that a somewhat minor character was in the running
979760	984560	to eventually get her own Wolverine-style, probably not very good X-Men spin-off
985120	990160	if certain actresses weren't so eager to get out of their contracts and not be painted blue anymore.
990160	995440	But I think it also speaks to how there is more of a demand for complex femme fatales nowadays.
995440	999760	That's why we've got sympathetic, maleficent Elsa, the misunderstood ice queen,
999760	1002160	the wicked witch was an animal lover the whole time,
1002160	1006640	and Mystique, once such a confident hard-ass, is now wracked with conflict and insecurity.
1007200	1008960	But I think it works either way.
1008960	1011840	We don't need her to necessarily choose.
1011840	1014800	She is, after all, a shapeshifter.
1015440	1016640	Because we shouldn't have to.
1017840	1019360	And thank you for watching.
1019360	1021520	Thank you very much to patrons on Patreon.
1022240	1024880	I'm going to do a vote again next month.
1025520	1029280	But the next couple episodes, executive decision.
1029280	1031360	Because it's my turn again.
1031360	1032400	Because I can.
1032400	1033200	And I'm in a mood.
1033920	1034800	See you next time.
