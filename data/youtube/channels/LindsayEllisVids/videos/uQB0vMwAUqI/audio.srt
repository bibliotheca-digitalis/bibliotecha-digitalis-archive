1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,140
So, after having been an option to vote for for three episodes now, I think it's finally Mystique time.

2
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:22,380
Yeah, I kept putting Mystique as an option to vote for because she's one of my favorite X-Men characters,

3
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,420
so I figured she had to win sooner or later.

4
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:31,820
So, through various iterations and some wild costume changes, what makes Mystique Mystique?

5
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:37,420
Where other X-Men villains exhibit more traditionally masculine bad guy traits, anger, arrogance,

6
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:43,900
and from a power standpoint, they tended to be more strength-focused or exerting control over stuff-focused,

7
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:49,660
Mystique exhibits a roster of historically feminine evils, and her entire run with the X-Men and their periphery

8
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:54,460
when she's not being an outright villain includes being a double agent, joining the X-Men,

9
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:59,420
betraying the X-Men, and using her sexuality as a weapon a lot.

10
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,940
Being duplicitous as a feminine archetype is as old as the written word.

11
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,860
Many Western mythologies feature feminine figures that presents themselves as one thing,

12
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:14,060
usually to lure men into some false sense of security, only to eventually spell their doom.

13
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,340
The Sirens lured sailors to their deaths, Delilah seduced and then metaphorically castrated Samson,

14
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:24,940
and Mystique's power is to present herself as one thing while always having a secret ulterior motive.

15
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:30,220
Female science fiction characters written in the 1970s by male writers were an interesting bag,

16
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:35,260
because there was a lot of anxiety about this whole nascent women's lib thing.

17
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,580
Even her name Mystique harkens to Mystique comma The Feminine,

18
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,100
a book which completely changed the way American women saw themselves.

19
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,780
So it's fitting that she first appears in Ms. Marvel's original series,

20
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,180
as she is the embodiment of the 70s Wonder Woman you've come a long way baby attitude.

21
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,300
And all of this background, to be honest, is what allows her to be interesting.

22
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:01,180
Mystique is all of these fear of female sexuality archetypes packaged into one character,

23
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,300
who still manages to be one of the most interesting and textured and nuanced of all the X-Men characters.

24
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,660
And like most ex-villains, she's only, you know, sometimes a villain.

25
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,060
She joins the X-Men, then unjoins them and tries to seduce her daughter's boyfriend

26
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,460
so she can break them up and set Rogue up with someone else.

27
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,580
You know, the ush.

28
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,780
She eventually betrays the X-Men, of course, but only sort of.

29
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,180
And then eventually gets killed, but don't worry, she gets better.

30
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,420
At one point, she's even Professor X's indentured servant in her unlimited series,

31
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,900
called Mystique, written by Brian K. Vaughan, which is kind of James Bond inspired,

32
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,060
and yep, once again, she's a double agent.

33
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,860
So because this always needs to be pointed out, apparently,

34
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:43,420
having a character's basis in misogynist archetypes as old as time is not necessarily a bad thing,

35
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,060
as long as those archetypes don't go unexamined.

36
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,980
But it is a thing.

37
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,260
In X-Men, the animated series, Mystique gets pretty much all the major character beats

38
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,100
we'd already seen in the comics up to that point.

39
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,620
I swore one day I'd get you back.

40
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,580
Today is that day, my daughter.

41
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,940
Excluding actually joining the X-Men that happened later.

42
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,740
She pals around with pretty much all the big bads and ends up being used as a puppet a lot.

43
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,060
He wants to destroy everything!

44
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,140
I had to help him!

45
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,300
He would have killed me!

46
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,100
He has a secret command center.

47
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,340
What an interesting line read.

48
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,860
Okay, now say it like you don't know what words mean.

49
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,500
Buried under Stonehenge in England.

50
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,740
But her big episodes center around, of course, Rogue and Nightcrawler,

51
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,740
and even Graydon Creed gets a name drop,

52
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:39,660
although the being everyone's mother thing is handled a lot less deftly in the cartoon.

53
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,180
She's Nightcrawler's mother!

54
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,260
And Creed's mother, too!

55
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,020
And Beasts!

56
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,300
And the Professors!

57
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,980
And Colin Firth's!

58
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,020
And Optimus Pr-

59
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,980
Okay, you get the idea.

60
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,660
You know, people like you are the reason I was afraid to go to school as a child.

61
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:59,820
But then came the movies, and here she's Magneto's right-hand acrobat spy.

62
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,060
A slight departure from the comics, as Mystique rarely has anything to do with Magneto,

63
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,020
aside from reforming the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.

64
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,780
But we gotta consolidate so in adaptations they're almost always working together.

65
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,500
And honestly, I think Rebecca Romijn doesn't get enough credit for being such a great physical actor.

66
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,860
Mystique has, like, two lines in this movie, and one of them is-

67
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,220
But you know so much about her just by the way she moves, her expressions.

68
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,420
Can you shut it down from here?

69
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,100
No.

70
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,620
She is alien, and the alien-ness is coded villainy,

71
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,180
but her motivations are clear and sympathetic,

72
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,220
and you can tell it took her a long while to get to that point.

73
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,380
Also, unlike in first class, the relationship between Magneto and Mystique is

74
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,060
all subtext.

75
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,740
They share laughs sometimes.

76
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,460
When will these people learn how to fly?

77
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,540
They seem to be friends, but really they're more political allies.

78
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,580
Their relationship doesn't have any sexual overtones,

79
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,460
but this is probably because Magneto is gay.

80
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,900
And Charles is gay.

81
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,860
What are you doing here?

82
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,020
Why do you ask questions to which you already know the answers?

83
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,940
And they are bitter exes.

84
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,260
You're sneaking around in here, Charles.

85
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,060
Whatever are you looking for?

86
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,740
And Mystique is over here like,

87
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,740
my name's Paul, this is between y'all.

88
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,540
Coinciding with the release of the first movie

89
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,740
came another animated series called X-Men Evolution,

90
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,140
which set itself apart from the earlier animated series

91
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,980
by making it more of a high school drama

92
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,860
and having most of the characters be high school age,

93
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,860
aside from a smattering of minter figures.

94
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,060
But for some reason, the kids who go to Xavier's school

95
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,620
also go to the local public high school

96
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,380
where Mystique is moonlighting-

97
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,060
daylighting?

98
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,900
As principal Darkholm.

99
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,620
Principal Dark-

100
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,220
You're Mystique?

101
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,740
Something Professor Xavier neglected to tell you.

102
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,700
And Xavier knows about this, but doesn't tell anyone?

103
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,020
Again, Mystique is working with Magneto,

104
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,580
who did some horrible thing to Nightcrawler

105
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,620
at some point in history.

106
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,660
Monster! What have you done to him?

107
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,140
We get to the Who's Your Mama episodes pretty early on,

108
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,660
first with Nightcrawler-

109
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,660
Um, no!

110
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,260
And then with Rogue.

111
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,340
I adopted you when you were four.

112
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,060
No!

113
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,420
Search the memories.

114
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,340
You are my daughter.

115
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,300
Destiny is here in this version as Mystique's best friend,

116
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,860
and she helped raise Rogue, who, once again,

117
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,980
does not remember being raised by Mystique in this version.

118
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,020
This was not a thing in the comics, by the way.

119
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,900
So at this point, Mystique the toxic mother figure

120
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,460
was a popular route for her character.

121
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,260
But I only posed as your friend so I could be near you.

122
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,460
Which is, of course, interesting and gives her a good source of conflict.

123
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,140
It's just too bad it didn't really go anywhere.

124
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,580
You want another beer?

125
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,060
Ah, here we are again with the using sexuality as a means to dupe men.

126
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:43,820
Velcro.

127
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,500
Nice.

128
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,700
In X-Men 2, after discovering some integral plot stuff,

129
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,780
she helps Magneto escape from prison,

130
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,540
and then they help the X-Men for a while before their sudden but inevitable betrayal.

131
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,180
It's kind of hinted in the first movie that she gets the hots for Wolverine when she fights him.

132
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,820
You know, some ladies are into that.

133
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,060
No one's ever left a scar quite like you.

134
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,060
She does want to nail Wolverine at one point,

135
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,260
seemingly for no reason other than she wants to get her some.

136
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,660
But this scene does give us one of the more

137
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,220
unintentionally hilarious moments in the whole franchise.

138
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,780
Oh yeah, that's what I want.

139
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,620
I likes me that Brian Cox.

140
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,900
She also gives us the most concise summation of the whole X-Men universe conflict,

141
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,620
and really any oppressed minority conflict.

142
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,780
Then why not stay in disguise all the time?

143
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,180
You know, look like everyone else.

144
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,340
Because we shouldn't have to.

145
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,580
You can't argue with that.

146
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,180
And really, that's all we need to know.

147
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,340
In fairness, not one character goes unfucked in X-Men 3,

148
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,180
so I won't say Mystique gets the shaft in an exceptional sense,

149
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,900
because every character in this movie does, but...

150
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,260
Braven, I asked you a question.

151
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,380
I don't answer to my slave name.

152
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,540
Is there anything unawful about this movie?

153
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:15,660
This moment.

154
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,340
This moment isn't terrible.

155
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,220
And that's it.

156
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,580
And no, the most obvious casting choice in history does not make this movie good,

157
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,580
really, that just makes it more of a tragic waste.

158
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,500
X-Men 3 combines two storylines,

159
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,380
the cure for mutation storyline and the Dark Phoenix storyline.

160
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,260
Two plots that have f*** all to do with each other,

161
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,980
and it's done about as clumsily as one can imagine.

162
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,860
Fairly early on in the movie, she's been caught by the cure people,

163
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,500
so Magneto goes to all this trouble to save her,

164
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,540
and then she takes a bullet for Magneto and gets depowered.

165
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,180
So now she's human, and Magneto's like,

166
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:45,980
Bye, Felicia.

167
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,660
I'm sorry, my dear.

168
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,500
You're not one of us anymore.

169
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,940
So how'd she react to this?

170
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,220
Yep, woman scorned.

171
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,020
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

172
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,060
Like, those are literally the words that they use in the movie.

173
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,020
Yeah, forget her militant mutant supremacy beliefs,

174
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,620
one guy screws her over and she's ready to throw all of mutantkind under the bus.

175
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,860
Basically off-screen.

176
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,620
Like, if there's one feminine archetype Mystique didn't get, it was woman scorned,

177
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,540
but now we can check that one off, too.

178
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,380
Like, this has got to be pretty traumatic for her, right?

179
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:26,460
Might be interesting to see her, like, wrestle with this new identity.

180
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,780
She gave us everything we wanted and more.

181
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,540
You know.

182
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,100
Carmen Electra plays a Mystique parody in epic movie, which...

183
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,340
You know, I think you could probably call the nadir of that franchise.

184
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,220
I like a lot of junk in the trunk.

185
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,260
Kinky.

186
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:53,760
Yeah.

187
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,420
Like a fat blue Britney Spears.

188
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,180
You know what's funny?

189
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:01,680
Fat.

190
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:03,900
Come here!

191
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,260
This so warrants existing.

192
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,180
Let's make this interesting.

193
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,620
Compared to shows in the 90s where you can pretty much jump on at any point

194
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,900
and not really have missed anything, Wolverine and the X-Men has more of a grown-up 2000s

195
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,540
bent with a season-long storyline.

196
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,140
It's more of a mini-series.

197
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,220
Think about this show as it's an ensemble piece to a point that's almost frustrating.

198
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,100
Everyone gets an episode or two, but besides Wolverine,

199
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,460
no one gets any real character development over any length of time

200
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,380
because there's just so damn many characters.

201
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,140
One way both Evolution and the original animated series were stronger.

202
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,140
Anyway, once again, she has a past with Wolverine because everyone does.

203
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,380
You really don't remember me, Logan?

204
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,060
Because I remember you.

205
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,340
And instead of her relationship with Rogue and Nightcrawler,

206
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,860
that's the one they decide to play up.

207
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,940
The man who sacrificed himself so I could get away.

208
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:58,860
He's gone.

209
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,700
She was also in an episode of the Superhero Squad show.

210
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,060
This one I only feel really merits mentioning because she's voiced by Lena Headey.

211
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,900
Your plan is a complete success, Dr. Doom.

212
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,820
The path to the fractals is clear.

213
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,540
You know.

214
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,420
When you play the Game of Thrones, you win or you die.

215
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,780
Finally, let's look at Mystique as played by Jennifer Lawrence,

216
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:24,060
who is, aside from having the same makeup, functionally a completely different character

217
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,820
from the one we saw in the first three movies.

218
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,500
First two movies.

219
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,140
Like, I'm not even really gonna try and parse why they decided to go this route with Mystique,

220
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,740
and I don't think it really works until we get today's a future pass,

221
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,020
but here's what we got.

222
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,100
It's kind of like Star Trek, where I guess we've got two diverging timelines now

223
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,660
with mildly differing origins,

224
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,900
or the original got retconned altogether,

225
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,980
which is a bummer because that means X2 didn't happen,

226
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,700
but on the plus side, that means The Last Stand didn't happen either.

227
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,940
Then God help us.

228
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,500
Well, either way, The Last Stand got double retconned,

229
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,780
as even in the dystopian future, everything that happened in The Last Stand

230
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,140
just completely goes ignored.

231
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,020
Okay, but here's where I don't buy that First Class is supposed to be an honest-to-God prequel

232
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,100
instead of an alternate universe.

233
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,980
Will you read to me?

234
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,540
Can't. I have my thesis coming up. I have to study.

235
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,420
Fine, read that. Your thesis always tells me right off.

236
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,780
We never get any kind of indication that Professor X and Mystique

237
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,260
have any kind of history at all in the first three,

238
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,540
let alone that they grew up together and she was secretly in love with him,

239
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,740
but he was all like,

240
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:31,020
ew, my sister slash maybe there's some underlying internalized mutantism,

241
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,100
mis-mutanty, mutant Haiti.

242
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,460
Would you date me?

243
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:37,820
Of course I would.

244
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,420
And a young man would be lucky to have you. You're stunning.

245
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,220
Looking like this.

246
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,000
What?

247
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,040
Anyway, they grew up together and she's kind of bitter

248
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,760
because Xavier doesn't want her in her natural form,

249
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,040
you know, in the biblical sense.

250
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,320
Mutant and proud.

251
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,400
And then Beast doesn't either for his own self-Haiti reasons.

252
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,560
My feet, in your natural blue form,

253
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,280
never be deemed beautiful.

254
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,320
You look beautiful now.

255
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,800
Damn, that's cold, Beast.

256
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,640
But hey, Magneto thinks she's hot.

257
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,120
You're an exquisite creature, Raven.

258
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,760
Yeah.

259
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,840
All your life, the world has tried to tame you.

260
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,480
It's time for you to be free.

261
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,720
And that's why she joins Magneto.

262
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,480
Anyway, it's not as simple as Magneto wants to bum buglies with her

263
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,080
and that's why she defects,

264
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,080
and there is something powerful to her wanting to be accepted for who she is,

265
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,400
and that being why she chooses Magneto's side,

266
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,240
but it definitely has this boys don't think I'm pretty undertone.

267
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,960
Would you date me?

268
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,240
Yeah, I'm not a big fan of first class.

269
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,960
Fortunately, then came Days of Future Past,

270
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,080
by and large considered the other good one,

271
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,520
and here's where Mystique's character veering off into a totally different direction

272
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,800
becomes more concrete,

273
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,680
and this, I think, is largely actress-oriented.

274
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,120
Could you pass me my robe?

275
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,720
I think first class is meant to show young Mystique as literally young and naive,

276
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,240
and she'll grow into that quiet, solemn, confident Rebecca Romijn,

277
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,000
but in Days of Future Past, she's not really made any progress in that direction,

278
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:17,120
and that, in no small part, is because this Mystique is more Katniss than, well, Mystique.

279
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,600
The screenwriters also kind of came to see Mystique

280
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,160
as the sort of cross-pollination between Erik and Charles' respective philosophies,

281
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,160
which is why this version ends up being defined more by internal conflict

282
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,280
than by straight-up mutant rights.

283
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,000
Unlike the confident, quietly angry ideologue in the first three movies,

284
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,920
this Mystique is wracked with conflict,

285
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,720
and unlike the Romijn version, who doesn't flinch at violence,

286
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,040
she seems uncomfortable with the idea of killing.

287
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,120
All your life, the world has tried to tame you.

288
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,440
There's always been an undercurrent in the X-Men movies

289
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,400
about Professor X trying to control the women in his life,

290
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,760
handled with profound clumsiness in the last stand.

291
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,080
Days of Future Past makes this a rather overt theme,

292
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,800
with the main plot centering around Wolverine going back in time

293
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,440
to try and prevent Mystique from assassinating Peter Dinklage,

294
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,840
and thereby eventually preventing the robo-apocalypse.

295
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,880
So the story is ultimately resolved when X accepts that, no, he cannot control her,

296
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,520
but instead appealing to her better nature.

297
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,920
I've been trying to control you ever since the day we met.

298
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,080
And look what that's got us.

299
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,920
Which is funny because in the comics,

300
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,600
there's a scene where she makes fun of Forge for doing the exact same thing.

301
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,320
New Mystique's arc comes to its logical end in Apocalypse with her joining the X-Men.

302
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,040
She is not a mutant terrorist, nor is she a killer, so this was kind of inevitable.

303
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,600
Because of her actions at the end of Days of Future Past,

304
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,800
she has by Apocalypse become a hero to mutants all over.

305
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,560
A figure of both power and peace, and she is uncomfortable with this

306
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,400
and decides not to live in her blue form

307
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,120
because Jennifer Lawrence did not want to sit in the makeup chair anymore.

308
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,520
I mean because she didn't want attention.

309
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,640
Seriously, Jennifer Lawrence is so checked out in this movie,

310
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,720
they may have well have just filmed a literal phone.

311
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,120
Although her getting choked by Apocalypse did feature heavily in the marketing of this movie.

312
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,960
So that was a thing.

313
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,200
But anyway, Apocalypse Mystique is a far cry from this Mystique.

314
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,960
Not that that's a bad thing.

315
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:14,400
Honestly, if there is a character that can handle an increasingly wide swath of character traits,

316
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,760
it's Mystique.

317
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,760
And it's interesting to think that a somewhat minor character was in the running

318
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,560
to eventually get her own Wolverine-style, probably not very good X-Men spin-off

319
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,160
if certain actresses weren't so eager to get out of their contracts and not be painted blue anymore.

320
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,440
But I think it also speaks to how there is more of a demand for complex femme fatales nowadays.

321
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,760
That's why we've got sympathetic, maleficent Elsa, the misunderstood ice queen,

322
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,160
the wicked witch was an animal lover the whole time,

323
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,640
and Mystique, once such a confident hard-ass, is now wracked with conflict and insecurity.

324
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,960
But I think it works either way.

325
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,840
We don't need her to necessarily choose.

326
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,800
She is, after all, a shapeshifter.

327
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,640
Because we shouldn't have to.

328
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,360
And thank you for watching.

329
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,520
Thank you very much to patrons on Patreon.

330
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,880
I'm going to do a vote again next month.

331
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,280
But the next couple episodes, executive decision.

332
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,360
Because it's my turn again.

333
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,400
Because I can.

334
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,200
And I'm in a mood.

335
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,800
See you next time.
