0	6440	Our wall filled out since last week.
6440	7440	Mm-hmm.
7440	8440	Yeah.
8440	9440	Cheers.
9440	13320	We put up our favorites and what appeared to be the fan favorites as well, so.
13320	16480	And doing so in my still morticia makeup, because...
16480	19240	That looks very good on you.
19240	20240	Does it?
20240	21240	I think so.
21240	26240	I thought it looked better with my hair down, obviously, because then it's like...
26240	27240	What?
28240	33640	Once again, thanks to everyone who submitted their artwork for the book cover contest.
33640	39800	It was a really hard choice, and we really appreciate your contributions.
39800	40800	You guys were awesome.
40800	48680	We have, however, made our decision, and we have for you now the reveal of what it will
48680	53480	be, the book cover of Awoken by Sarah Ellenson.
53480	54480	Yeah.
55480	56480	Yeah.
56480	59640	Or hell, let's just plaster this on the digital.
59640	60640	Dink, dink.
60640	64960	So yeah, we ended up going with Ariel Johnson for a number of reasons.
64960	72360	I feel like, in fairness, this cover is a little dated, but then again, so is paranormal
72360	76360	romance for teenagers.
76360	82280	So I think it kind of works for what it is, someone, this Sarah Ellenson character trying
82280	87240	to catch on to a trend years after that ship has sailed.
87240	95280	And we also ended up going for the tagline with, in dreams he came, because...
95280	96840	You can never have too much fantasy.
96840	99800	Yeah, and phantom gets brought up a lot in this book.
99800	104080	It's like the Wuthering Heights of the book, or yeah, it was like Wuthering Heights for
104080	109000	Twilight in Fifty Shades, it was Tests of the Dubervilles, and so here, it's just Phantom
109000	110000	of the Opera.
110000	113040	Sarah Ellenson is just that well read.
113040	119120	That means our launch is good to go, it's still gonna be on August 30th, two thousand
119120	120120	and...
120120	121120	Thirteen.
121120	122120	Thirteen!
122120	125000	Man, we're so much faster than real publishing.
125000	129840	Since our release is August 30th, what we're really trying to see is if we can get a lot
129840	134680	of people to purchase the book, either in hard copy or e-book form.
134680	135680	Especially e-book.
135680	136680	Especially e-book.
136680	137680	It's gonna be a lot cheaper.
137920	142640	That it will be, and it will be very nicely formatted too, to push this baby up.
142640	149920	See how high we can climb in young adult paranormal romance fiction, just to see how far up that
149920	151640	ladder Sarah will go.
151640	153680	To save the day.
153680	154820	On that one day.
154820	159480	If she'll like, crack the top thousand or something, that would be hilarious.
159480	164880	Amazon doesn't do pre-orders for self-publishers, probably because self-publishers are flaky.
164880	169200	Which is understandable, so it's like, basically, it's on sale when it goes live.
169200	174880	But meanwhile, on the 30th also, for those of you in the New York area, we will be hosting
174880	178720	a book launch party at Enigma Bookstore in Astoria.
178720	186280	Yeah, we're gonna have a book release party, and it's gonna be fun, and special guests
186280	191640	will be there, like Sarah's picture.
191640	199800	And I believe we have Kyle Owen Citizen Colgren will be doing a reading from our opus in his
199800	201360	Shakespearean way.
201360	206600	Hopefully some wine, but no promises on that one, so it depends on the bookstore.
206600	207600	But definitely not.
207600	216320	Yeah, so it'll be at Enigma Bookstore on August 30th at, I think, 8pm, and it will run until
216320	221080	the wee small hours of 10?
221120	227240	We do need to know how many people are coming, so please RSVP on the Facebook event page,
227240	231200	which you can find on our Facebook page, which is here.
231200	238360	And the event, of course, is called Sexy Cthulhu Book Release Party, and a good time will be
238360	240840	had by all, so we look forward to seeing you there.
240840	248240	As ever, keep your eye on Sarah Ellen's Facebook, on her Twitter, and on the website.
248240	254160	And on her blog, sometimes she blogs about how tragic her internet life is, and how people
254160	257040	were mean to her because they gave her good criticism.
257040	259040	How dare they?
259040	261040	I mean, she's an English major.
261040	263040	She's an English major!
