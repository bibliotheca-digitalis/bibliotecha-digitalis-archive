WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.440
Our wall filled out since last week.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.440
Mm-hmm.

00:07.440 --> 00:08.440
Yeah.

00:08.440 --> 00:09.440
Cheers.

00:09.440 --> 00:13.320
We put up our favorites and what appeared to be the fan favorites as well, so.

00:13.320 --> 00:16.480
And doing so in my still morticia makeup, because...

00:16.480 --> 00:19.240
That looks very good on you.

00:19.240 --> 00:20.240
Does it?

00:20.240 --> 00:21.240
I think so.

00:21.240 --> 00:26.240
I thought it looked better with my hair down, obviously, because then it's like...

00:26.240 --> 00:27.240
What?

00:28.240 --> 00:33.640
Once again, thanks to everyone who submitted their artwork for the book cover contest.

00:33.640 --> 00:39.800
It was a really hard choice, and we really appreciate your contributions.

00:39.800 --> 00:40.800
You guys were awesome.

00:40.800 --> 00:48.680
We have, however, made our decision, and we have for you now the reveal of what it will

00:48.680 --> 00:53.480
be, the book cover of Awoken by Sarah Ellenson.

00:53.480 --> 00:54.480
Yeah.

00:55.480 --> 00:56.480
Yeah.

00:56.480 --> 00:59.640
Or hell, let's just plaster this on the digital.

00:59.640 --> 01:00.640
Dink, dink.

01:00.640 --> 01:04.960
So yeah, we ended up going with Ariel Johnson for a number of reasons.

01:04.960 --> 01:12.360
I feel like, in fairness, this cover is a little dated, but then again, so is paranormal

01:12.360 --> 01:16.360
romance for teenagers.

01:16.360 --> 01:22.280
So I think it kind of works for what it is, someone, this Sarah Ellenson character trying

01:22.280 --> 01:27.240
to catch on to a trend years after that ship has sailed.

01:27.240 --> 01:35.280
And we also ended up going for the tagline with, in dreams he came, because...

01:35.280 --> 01:36.840
You can never have too much fantasy.

01:36.840 --> 01:39.800
Yeah, and phantom gets brought up a lot in this book.

01:39.800 --> 01:44.080
It's like the Wuthering Heights of the book, or yeah, it was like Wuthering Heights for

01:44.080 --> 01:49.000
Twilight in Fifty Shades, it was Tests of the Dubervilles, and so here, it's just Phantom

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
of the Opera.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.040
Sarah Ellenson is just that well read.

01:53.040 --> 01:59.120
That means our launch is good to go, it's still gonna be on August 30th, two thousand

01:59.120 --> 02:00.120
and...

02:00.120 --> 02:01.120
Thirteen.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.120
Thirteen!

02:02.120 --> 02:05.000
Man, we're so much faster than real publishing.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.840
Since our release is August 30th, what we're really trying to see is if we can get a lot

02:09.840 --> 02:14.680
of people to purchase the book, either in hard copy or e-book form.

02:14.680 --> 02:15.680
Especially e-book.

02:15.680 --> 02:16.680
Especially e-book.

02:16.680 --> 02:17.680
It's gonna be a lot cheaper.

02:17.920 --> 02:22.640
That it will be, and it will be very nicely formatted too, to push this baby up.

02:22.640 --> 02:29.920
See how high we can climb in young adult paranormal romance fiction, just to see how far up that

02:29.920 --> 02:31.640
ladder Sarah will go.

02:31.640 --> 02:33.680
To save the day.

02:33.680 --> 02:34.820
On that one day.

02:34.820 --> 02:39.480
If she'll like, crack the top thousand or something, that would be hilarious.

02:39.480 --> 02:44.880
Amazon doesn't do pre-orders for self-publishers, probably because self-publishers are flaky.

02:44.880 --> 02:49.200
Which is understandable, so it's like, basically, it's on sale when it goes live.

02:49.200 --> 02:54.880
But meanwhile, on the 30th also, for those of you in the New York area, we will be hosting

02:54.880 --> 02:58.720
a book launch party at Enigma Bookstore in Astoria.

02:58.720 --> 03:06.280
Yeah, we're gonna have a book release party, and it's gonna be fun, and special guests

03:06.280 --> 03:11.640
will be there, like Sarah's picture.

03:11.640 --> 03:19.800
And I believe we have Kyle Owen Citizen Colgren will be doing a reading from our opus in his

03:19.800 --> 03:21.360
Shakespearean way.

03:21.360 --> 03:26.600
Hopefully some wine, but no promises on that one, so it depends on the bookstore.

03:26.600 --> 03:27.600
But definitely not.

03:27.600 --> 03:36.320
Yeah, so it'll be at Enigma Bookstore on August 30th at, I think, 8pm, and it will run until

03:36.320 --> 03:41.080
the wee small hours of 10?

03:41.120 --> 03:47.240
We do need to know how many people are coming, so please RSVP on the Facebook event page,

03:47.240 --> 03:51.200
which you can find on our Facebook page, which is here.

03:51.200 --> 03:58.360
And the event, of course, is called Sexy Cthulhu Book Release Party, and a good time will be

03:58.360 --> 04:00.840
had by all, so we look forward to seeing you there.

04:00.840 --> 04:08.240
As ever, keep your eye on Sarah Ellen's Facebook, on her Twitter, and on the website.

04:08.240 --> 04:14.160
And on her blog, sometimes she blogs about how tragic her internet life is, and how people

04:14.160 --> 04:17.040
were mean to her because they gave her good criticism.

04:17.040 --> 04:19.040
How dare they?

04:19.040 --> 04:21.040
I mean, she's an English major.

04:21.040 --> 04:23.040
She's an English major!
