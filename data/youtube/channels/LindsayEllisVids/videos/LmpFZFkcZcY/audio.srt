1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
Our wall filled out since last week.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,440
Mm-hmm.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,440
Yeah.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,440
Cheers.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,320
We put up our favorites and what appeared to be the fan favorites as well, so.

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,480
And doing so in my still morticia makeup, because...

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,240
That looks very good on you.

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,240
Does it?

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,240
I think so.

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,240
I thought it looked better with my hair down, obviously, because then it's like...

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,240
What?

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,640
Once again, thanks to everyone who submitted their artwork for the book cover contest.

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,800
It was a really hard choice, and we really appreciate your contributions.

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,800
You guys were awesome.

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:48,680
We have, however, made our decision, and we have for you now the reveal of what it will

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,480
be, the book cover of Awoken by Sarah Ellenson.

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,480
Yeah.

18
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,480
Yeah.

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,640
Or hell, let's just plaster this on the digital.

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,640
Dink, dink.

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,960
So yeah, we ended up going with Ariel Johnson for a number of reasons.

22
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:12,360
I feel like, in fairness, this cover is a little dated, but then again, so is paranormal

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,360
romance for teenagers.

24
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:22,280
So I think it kind of works for what it is, someone, this Sarah Ellenson character trying

25
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,240
to catch on to a trend years after that ship has sailed.

26
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:35,280
And we also ended up going for the tagline with, in dreams he came, because...

27
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,840
You can never have too much fantasy.

28
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,800
Yeah, and phantom gets brought up a lot in this book.

29
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,080
It's like the Wuthering Heights of the book, or yeah, it was like Wuthering Heights for

30
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,000
Twilight in Fifty Shades, it was Tests of the Dubervilles, and so here, it's just Phantom

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
of the Opera.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,040
Sarah Ellenson is just that well read.

33
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,120
That means our launch is good to go, it's still gonna be on August 30th, two thousand

34
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,120
and...

35
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,120
Thirteen.

36
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,120
Thirteen!

37
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,000
Man, we're so much faster than real publishing.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,840
Since our release is August 30th, what we're really trying to see is if we can get a lot

39
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,680
of people to purchase the book, either in hard copy or e-book form.

40
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,680
Especially e-book.

41
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,680
Especially e-book.

42
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,680
It's gonna be a lot cheaper.

43
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,640
That it will be, and it will be very nicely formatted too, to push this baby up.

44
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,920
See how high we can climb in young adult paranormal romance fiction, just to see how far up that

45
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,640
ladder Sarah will go.

46
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,680
To save the day.

47
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,820
On that one day.

48
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,480
If she'll like, crack the top thousand or something, that would be hilarious.

49
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,880
Amazon doesn't do pre-orders for self-publishers, probably because self-publishers are flaky.

50
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,200
Which is understandable, so it's like, basically, it's on sale when it goes live.

51
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,880
But meanwhile, on the 30th also, for those of you in the New York area, we will be hosting

52
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,720
a book launch party at Enigma Bookstore in Astoria.

53
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:06,280
Yeah, we're gonna have a book release party, and it's gonna be fun, and special guests

54
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,640
will be there, like Sarah's picture.

55
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:19,800
And I believe we have Kyle Owen Citizen Colgren will be doing a reading from our opus in his

56
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,360
Shakespearean way.

57
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,600
Hopefully some wine, but no promises on that one, so it depends on the bookstore.

58
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
But definitely not.

59
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:36,320
Yeah, so it'll be at Enigma Bookstore on August 30th at, I think, 8pm, and it will run until

60
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,080
the wee small hours of 10?

61
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,240
We do need to know how many people are coming, so please RSVP on the Facebook event page,

62
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,200
which you can find on our Facebook page, which is here.

63
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:58,360
And the event, of course, is called Sexy Cthulhu Book Release Party, and a good time will be

64
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,840
had by all, so we look forward to seeing you there.

65
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:08,240
As ever, keep your eye on Sarah Ellen's Facebook, on her Twitter, and on the website.

66
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:14,160
And on her blog, sometimes she blogs about how tragic her internet life is, and how people

67
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,040
were mean to her because they gave her good criticism.

68
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,040
How dare they?

69
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,040
I mean, she's an English major.

70
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,040
She's an English major!
