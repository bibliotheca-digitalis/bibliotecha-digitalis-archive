WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:25.480
with a wanton mom she still calling out obscenities full of coerced rapture until only his name

00:25.480 --> 00:35.240
was on her lips. The **** grew, his **** as it could go the instant her muscles began

00:35.240 --> 00:42.280
clenching rhythmically to draw out ****. Watching him grunt like a beast, Claire felt the ****

00:42.280 --> 00:49.200
lost in the rapture of her greedy **** milking his **** until **** with the stuff. While

00:49.200 --> 00:54.680
the **** persisted, Shepherd looked into disoriented green eyes and demanded roughly, whose name

00:54.680 --> 01:00.160
did you call as you ****? Claire could hardly breathe, was on the ebb of a powerful **** that

01:00.160 --> 01:07.900
shook her to her bones, she whispered trying not to cry, yours. Because I am your alpha.

01:07.900 --> 01:14.160
It was almost a roar. You want to be **** by me, do you understand? I'm the only man you

01:14.160 --> 01:20.280
will ever **** from this moment on. Drocco roared. I will not share you, ever. You will

01:20.280 --> 01:24.440
never have an opportunity to **** anyone else. His hand tightened around her neck as

01:24.440 --> 01:29.600
he leaned in, growling. No other man alive should have had what I own. You will tell

01:29.600 --> 01:33.180
me who they are and where they are and then you will declare me your alpha. Watching her

01:33.180 --> 01:39.480
lips form words, dissecting the tortured desire and uncontrolled pleasure, he **** even faster,

01:39.480 --> 01:46.640
snarling like a beast, still **** with **** he demanded. Who do you belong to? There were

01:46.640 --> 01:50.920
tears leaking from the eyes squeezed shut as she jerked and twitched from his abused

01:50.920 --> 02:03.440
**** and ******* prolonged too far. Please, please stop. I can't. Who do you belong to?

02:03.440 --> 02:12.440
Face full of pain, pleasure, Claire gasped. I belong to you. That's right, little one.

02:12.440 --> 02:17.440
She became a voice as if leagues away. The ******* ******* abated and she sobbed when

02:17.440 --> 02:22.680
the overstrong extended ******* ******* began to abate. More waves of ******* ******* burned

02:22.680 --> 02:27.680
her from the inside when Shepherd purred, you belong only to me.

02:27.680 --> 02:46.240
Hey everyone, get set to get wet. So a few months ago there was this article in the New

02:46.240 --> 02:51.960
York Times with the title, a feud in wolf kink erotica raises a deep legal question,

02:51.960 --> 02:56.520
subheader, what do copyright and authorship mean in the crowdsourced realm known as the

02:56.520 --> 03:02.400
Omegaverse? And I gotta tell you, this article doesn't even come close to scratching the

03:02.400 --> 03:07.520
surface of how coconuts this whole thing is. So where to start? Okay, so there was this

03:07.520 --> 03:14.880
lawsuit surrounding some works of fiction that incorporated the fanfic trope known as

03:14.880 --> 03:21.680
ABO or Omegaverse, and one thing led to another, and before you know it, the New York Times

03:21.680 --> 03:28.600
gets to explain concepts like estrus cycles, claiming bites, forced impregnation, nodding,

03:28.600 --> 03:38.000
which is, well, it's like, apparently it's a feature of wolf anatomy. It's got everything.

03:38.000 --> 03:47.840
Sock puppetry, falsified documents, violent heat cycle, perjury, spurts of, well, oh no!

03:47.840 --> 03:52.360
It's like the tiger king of wolf porn. And the deep legal question is, in effect, who

03:52.360 --> 03:58.640
owns ideas? Where do you draw the line between what is and is not worthy of copyright? And

03:58.640 --> 04:05.040
why does it involve so much bodily fluid? You're like the loudest climaxer I've ever

04:05.040 --> 04:09.760
heard. It was like the sound of a 30 year old sprinkler finally going off for the first

04:09.760 --> 04:25.360
time. So what is the Omegaverse? So I'm just going to call this a subgenre of erotica,

04:25.360 --> 04:30.000
because if you ignore the fanfic specificity, that's all it is. The concept of Omegaverse

04:30.000 --> 04:34.360
originally started as a subgenre of erotic speculative fanfiction in the supernatural

04:34.360 --> 04:40.480
fandom and found broader appeal in the sprawling mega-fandom known as Super Hoolock, an amalgam

04:40.480 --> 04:45.800
of Supernatural, Sherlock, and Doctor Who in the early 2010s. These stories are characterized

04:45.800 --> 04:51.320
by alternate human societies, which are divided into a dominance hierarchy like wolves, but

04:51.320 --> 04:55.880
not like real wolves, more like that study that divided wolves into alphas and betas

04:55.880 --> 05:00.800
that was later debunked by the guy who did the original study. So it's based on like

05:00.800 --> 05:07.040
bad wolf science. These societies contain alphas, the dominating alphas, the big boys,

05:07.040 --> 05:12.000
the dick swingers, the betas. Despite its current common use as a pejorative for a submissive

05:12.000 --> 05:18.300
man, betas in ABO are neutral. They're like the normies. Like sure, they will do the do,

05:18.300 --> 05:23.340
but they don't go into like uncontrollable pheromone rages at the smell of an omega's

05:23.340 --> 05:29.280
heat cycle. Speaking of which, omegas, the submissive, the soft boys, the seduces who

05:29.280 --> 05:33.800
find themselves drawn to the shit-lording of alphas because they're pheromones or

05:33.800 --> 05:39.360
whatever. The subgenre also includes other esoterica and tropes of wolf behavior like

05:39.360 --> 05:47.840
mating for life, rutting, heat cycles, nodding, sense marking, claiming bites, and impreg,

05:47.840 --> 05:52.320
which if the portmanteau doesn't tell you enough, is the ability for male characters,

05:52.320 --> 05:57.080
usually omegas, to get pregnant. I don't think wolves can do that, but it is an important

05:57.080 --> 06:03.640
staple of the genre. Any fictional property can be omegaversed. Lord of the Rings, Supernatural,

06:03.640 --> 06:10.520
One Direction, Game of Thrones, Transformers, hell, there's even HAMILTON omegaverse fan

06:10.520 --> 06:17.640
fiction and fan art. Like, a lot. So I stopped being actively involved in creating and consuming

06:17.640 --> 06:22.860
fanworks around the time I started making internet videos back in the 1960s, so I kind

06:22.860 --> 06:29.360
of phased out before this trend became popular. So while I had heard of it, my first real

06:29.360 --> 06:33.700
exposure to the whole omegaverse thing was the New York Times article.

06:33.700 --> 06:37.860
He knew for certain now that he did not want a submissive omega. When Kaylin had threatened

06:37.860 --> 06:42.940
him, her voice low and possessive, her eyes flashing, her body ready to pounce, he almost

06:42.940 --> 06:45.060
came in his pants.

06:45.060 --> 06:46.060
Wow.

06:46.260 --> 06:47.260
Wow.

06:55.540 --> 07:00.100
So this brave new world is all very strange and confusing to me. I'm like Grandpa Simpson

07:00.100 --> 07:01.100
over here.

07:01.100 --> 07:06.980
I used to be with it, but then they changed what it was. Now what I'm with isn't it, and

07:06.980 --> 07:09.540
what's it seems weird and scary to me.

07:09.540 --> 07:14.900
But at the end of the day, it's just fanfic. Where could a lawsuit possibly come into this?

07:14.940 --> 07:20.140
Well, since this trope is so popular, it was only a matter of time before people decided,

07:20.140 --> 07:22.860
hey, I could make money off of this.

07:28.860 --> 07:33.860
Commercial publication of omegaverse fiction is said by some to have started with 2007's

07:33.860 --> 07:39.580
With Caution by J.L. Langley, but like the overwhelming majority of omegaverse fanfiction,

07:39.580 --> 07:41.660
it centered male-male relationships.

07:41.660 --> 07:47.460
The commonality of male-male pairings is the crux of the most batshit copyright claim ever.

07:47.460 --> 07:49.660
Enter Addison Cain.

07:49.660 --> 07:55.900
Now this is not her real name, but I'm going to just refer to her by her pen name because.

07:55.900 --> 08:01.140
So Addison Cain, of course, like so many of us, begins her career as a fanfic writer.

08:01.140 --> 08:04.980
She finds her fanfic calling writing erotic The Dark Knight Rises fanfiction starting

08:04.980 --> 08:09.500
in 2012, and quickly becomes something of a darling in the fandom.

08:09.500 --> 08:14.100
And like E.L. James before her, she starts to think, hey, maybe there's money to be

08:14.100 --> 08:20.180
made here. So she pulls her fanfic and begins the process of revising it into something

08:20.180 --> 08:21.340
that she can sell.

08:21.340 --> 08:25.100
And while we are here, one of the many negative side effects of the infamous popularity of

08:25.100 --> 08:29.780
books like Fifty Shades of Grey is this presumption that any professional author who so much as

08:29.780 --> 08:35.940
admits to having been in fandom is just repurposing their old fanfic, and if they say they aren't,

08:35.940 --> 08:37.700
they are probably lying about it.

08:37.700 --> 08:42.140
I've seen a lot of people make that assumption about me just because I've joked about having

08:42.140 --> 08:46.860
written fanfic in the past. Most fanfic authors who jump to professional authorship do not

08:46.860 --> 08:51.360
just repurpose their old fanfic. Naomi Novik, for instance, got her start in the Master

08:51.360 --> 08:55.860
and Commander fandom in the early 2000s, so that influence was there when she published

08:55.860 --> 09:01.380
the Temeraire series, which is basically the Napoleonic Wars but with dragons. And a lot

09:01.380 --> 09:06.780
of people who have read my book can tell that I have spent some time in the Transformers

09:06.780 --> 09:07.780
fandom.

09:07.780 --> 09:10.860
But these are not just works of fanfiction repackaged for profit. However, there are

09:10.860 --> 09:16.700
some high profile examples of authors doing just that, a practice called filing the serial

09:16.700 --> 09:21.360
numbers off. Some authors have found tremendous success with taking their fanfic and turning

09:21.360 --> 09:26.020
it into original fiction. Fifty Shades of Grey was originally a Twilight fanfic, Cassandra

09:26.020 --> 09:31.300
Clare's Mortal Instruments series began life as a Draco fanfic, After was a Wattpad

09:31.300 --> 09:36.860
One Direction fanfic about a bad boy version of Harry Styles in college, and this is the

09:36.860 --> 09:43.220
business model that Addison Cain, erotic Dark Knight Rises fanfic writer, hopes to hit paydirt

09:43.220 --> 09:44.220
with.

09:44.220 --> 09:48.420
Most publishers reject or ignore her queries, but eventually small indie publisher Blushing

09:48.420 --> 09:52.840
Books accepts her manuscript for what would become the first book in a series, Born to

09:52.840 --> 09:58.400
Be Bound, and the series soon earns over $370,000.

09:58.400 --> 10:02.960
When she grew tamer as the overblown reaction to Force Estrus lessened, she would stay still

10:02.960 --> 10:09.000
long enough for him to scent her, for his big hands to rub the b****** that had l******

10:09.000 --> 10:13.480
all over her skin, to f*** it to her as he purred and gave affection.

10:13.480 --> 10:14.480
Damn.

10:14.480 --> 10:21.000
So, Cain becomes something of a star in the budding commercial Omegaverse published arena,

10:21.000 --> 10:24.600
especially, according to Cain, in the MF field.

10:24.600 --> 10:29.160
What in the fanfic world is called het, because fanfiction is one of the rare arenas where

10:29.160 --> 10:33.720
heterosexual couplings are actually in the minority, but of course since this genre turns

10:33.720 --> 10:37.880
out to be lucrative, she's not the only one doing it.

10:37.880 --> 10:40.360
Enter author Zoe Ellis.

10:40.360 --> 10:43.440
No relation, because it's not her real name either.

10:43.440 --> 10:50.400
Zoe Ellis is the nom de plume of writing for Quill Inc's Books, which is a small publisher

10:50.400 --> 10:51.820
based in London.

10:51.820 --> 10:56.900
Her novel, Crave to Conquer, the first book in the Myth of Omega series, is published

10:56.900 --> 10:58.560
in 2018.

10:58.560 --> 11:05.080
Like Born to be Bound, it is also Omegaverse, also het, and also extremely violent and unpleasant

11:05.080 --> 11:06.120
to read.

11:06.120 --> 11:07.120
And I don't recommend it.

11:07.120 --> 11:14.160
I don't know what I expected.

11:14.160 --> 11:20.240
So not long after, someone approaches Cain and says, hey, this book seems to lift a lot

11:20.240 --> 11:24.120
of plot points from your book, I think it might be plagiarism?

11:24.120 --> 11:26.320
And of course, Cain does not take this well.

11:26.320 --> 11:28.780
Well, Cain's publisher does not take this well.

11:28.780 --> 11:33.460
She does not see this as a rising tide lifts all ships scenario, which generally in genres

11:33.460 --> 11:34.840
like this it totally is.

11:34.840 --> 11:39.160
Oh no, she sees a rival horning in on her territory.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.720
Sinting it, you might say.

11:40.720 --> 11:50.680
Anyway, Zoe Ellis must be destroyed.

11:50.680 --> 11:56.640
In April of 2018, Cain's publisher, Blushing Books, sends DMCA takedown notices to Amazon,

11:56.640 --> 12:00.120
Barnes and Noble, Google Play, Kobo, and iTunes.

12:00.120 --> 12:04.680
Blushing claims that Crave to Conquer did a copyright infringement by lifting multiple

12:04.680 --> 12:09.440
plot points from Born to be Bound, and that while Cain did not invent Omegaverse, she

12:09.440 --> 12:18.000
did invent Het Omegaverse, which, hmm.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.080
Anyway, DMCA takedown notices.

12:20.080 --> 12:24.060
We hear a lot about them, but few know how they actually work or what they are supposed

12:24.060 --> 12:25.060
to do.

12:25.060 --> 12:28.800
Maybe we could get a lawyer to explain it.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.360
Real phone call happening.

12:30.360 --> 12:31.360
Hello?

12:31.360 --> 12:34.240
Hey Lindsay, what's up?

12:34.240 --> 12:36.880
Hey, Devin of Legal Eagle.

12:36.880 --> 12:42.520
Have you heard about this Omegaverse lawsuit that are happening?

12:42.520 --> 12:47.040
Yeah, I know a fair amount about copyright law, but I don't know anything about wolf

12:47.040 --> 12:48.040
pornography.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.760
Yeah, that's fine.

12:49.760 --> 12:50.760
Okay.

12:50.760 --> 12:56.120
So the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, was a law that was written in the very

12:56.120 --> 13:01.560
early days of the internet to decide who would be liable for hosting copyright infringing

13:01.560 --> 13:02.560
material.

13:02.560 --> 13:07.180
It would be easy to imagine a world where a website was responsible for the content

13:07.180 --> 13:08.460
that its users uploaded.

13:08.460 --> 13:13.720
You can imagine that if a user uploaded some copyright infringing material, that the rights

13:13.720 --> 13:18.100
holders could go after the platform for damages, and in that world, it would be way easier

13:18.100 --> 13:23.000
to get damages from the website or platform instead of the random user who uploaded it.

13:23.000 --> 13:28.260
The problem is that if that were the case, then no one would host a website that allowed

13:28.260 --> 13:32.780
users to upload material because they would always be at the mercy of all of these copyright

13:32.780 --> 13:33.860
suits.

13:33.860 --> 13:40.000
So Congress decided in their infinite wisdom in the mid nineties that it made sense to

13:40.000 --> 13:46.280
give away for platforms to have immunity from these copyright infringement lawsuits.

13:46.280 --> 13:51.540
Section 512 of the DMCA actually gives platforms a safe harbor so that they're not responsible

13:51.540 --> 13:56.040
for the content that their users upload if it's infringing of copyright.

13:56.040 --> 14:00.120
But in able to receive that safe harbor, they actually have to do certain requirements.

14:00.120 --> 14:04.640
The main requirement is that if a website or platform receives a notice, a DMCA notice

14:04.640 --> 14:09.800
that some content that they're hosting infringes of someone's copyright, then they have to

14:09.800 --> 14:10.800
take that down.

14:10.800 --> 14:11.840
That's called a DMCA notice.

14:11.840 --> 14:17.240
On the other hand, a user who believes that this DMCA takedown notice was given in error

14:17.240 --> 14:22.520
can issue what's called a DMCA counter notice and get the content put back up.

14:22.520 --> 14:28.080
So generally speaking, when a platform like YouTube, let's say, receives a proper DMCA

14:28.080 --> 14:33.380
takedown notice notifying them that some material infringes on someone's copyright and they

14:33.380 --> 14:39.400
take that material down, then the DMCA gives them a safe harbor and prevents YouTube specifically

14:39.400 --> 14:42.520
from being sued for copyright infringement.

14:42.520 --> 14:47.200
Now in exchange, copyright holders no longer have to go to court to get things taken down.

14:47.200 --> 14:49.580
They just need to send a form.

14:49.620 --> 14:55.580
So in a way, it can avoid a whole bunch of litigation costs when some user uploads some

14:55.580 --> 14:59.480
content that's not theirs to upload in the first place.

14:59.480 --> 15:04.940
So a DMCA takedown notice is a party claiming that a platform is hosting some content that's

15:04.940 --> 15:06.660
illegally infringing on copyright.

15:06.660 --> 15:11.580
And you can see how powerful this tool could be in the wrong hands that you can take down

15:11.580 --> 15:17.380
almost any website or video that's on the internet so long as you make a DMCA claim,

15:17.380 --> 15:22.300
which is why the DMCA requires you to have a good faith basis that there's copyright

15:22.300 --> 15:26.480
infringement going on, that you have to swear under the penalty of perjury that you actually

15:26.480 --> 15:32.620
own the underlying content that was infringed and that there was actually copyright infringement

15:32.620 --> 15:33.740
going on.

15:33.740 --> 15:39.420
Because if you're going to be making a claiming bite, you had better be ready to pair bond

15:39.420 --> 15:40.420
for life.

15:40.420 --> 15:44.480
I have no idea what that means, but Lindsay says it makes sense in context.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.660
So there you go, I guess.

15:46.660 --> 15:50.780
But when we're talking about the DMCA, if you're a platform, you can get in trouble

15:50.780 --> 15:54.120
for refusing to take down different material.

15:54.120 --> 16:00.060
If you refuse a DMCA takedown notice, then and only then can the underlying rights holder

16:00.060 --> 16:01.340
sue the platform.

16:01.340 --> 16:06.580
So if YouTube gets a DMCA claim and they say, no, we're going to leave this video up, then

16:06.580 --> 16:08.980
they can be sued for copyright infringement.

16:08.980 --> 16:13.620
But if they take the video down, then they're not liable to anyone, which is why you see

16:13.620 --> 16:19.900
a lot of platforms, whether it's Twitter or Amazon or YouTube, they just get the DMCA

16:19.900 --> 16:24.460
takedown notices and take those videos down because it's no skin off their nose and they

16:24.460 --> 16:29.940
don't have to do an independent analysis to determine whether the video or other IP actually

16:29.940 --> 16:31.460
does the infringing.

16:31.460 --> 16:34.540
That's up to the person that made the claim.

16:34.540 --> 16:40.440
And if the person made a claim that isn't valid, then they can be liable in court for

16:40.440 --> 16:42.280
that invalid DMCA takedown.

16:42.280 --> 16:46.400
So that's why you get a lot of platforms that are removing content without doing an

16:46.400 --> 16:51.140
independent analysis because there's no reason for them to do any kind of independent analysis.

16:51.140 --> 16:57.440
So this is a really complicated area of the law, but that is DMCA liability in a nutshell.

16:57.440 --> 17:01.460
I cannot believe I just talked about wolf c**t for f**king five.

17:01.460 --> 17:06.260
So Blushing Books issues DMCA claims across all platforms and all of Zoe Ellis's books

17:06.260 --> 17:07.960
get taken down.

17:07.960 --> 17:13.100
Even people who bought the book on e-readers like Kendall, the book magically disappears

17:13.100 --> 17:14.620
from their devices.

17:14.620 --> 17:18.820
So here is a big problem with the whole DRM thing, but we aren't getting into that today.

17:18.820 --> 17:23.720
On April 19th, 2018, Kane wrote this Facebook post for her fans.

17:23.720 --> 17:28.600
My publishing house has chosen to take legal action against another author for plagiarism

17:28.600 --> 17:31.900
and copyright infringement of one of my books.

17:31.900 --> 17:36.020
They own the rights to print and distribute my story, and should an outside influence

17:36.020 --> 17:40.200
try to profit from it, they are legally bound to respond.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.600
This is outside of my control.

17:42.600 --> 17:45.120
Please consider that this is very serious.

17:45.120 --> 17:49.200
A publishing house does not make a move like this without solid evidence and the full knowledge

17:49.200 --> 17:51.440
that any legal battle is already won.

17:51.440 --> 17:54.040
I am sick to my stomach thinking about it.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.920
I wish this had never happened.

17:55.920 --> 18:00.880
I apologize to every single one of you who were affected by this mess.

18:00.880 --> 18:04.080
I apologize to anyone who has been upset by this.

18:04.080 --> 18:09.820
And lastly, I apologize to my fans, and the fans of Omegaverse.

18:09.820 --> 18:11.500
No one is winning here.

18:11.500 --> 18:16.340
For the torches and pitchforks that will inevitably come my way, please remember that I'm just

18:16.340 --> 18:19.300
a regular person stuck in the middle of this mess too.

18:19.300 --> 18:23.500
I never asked for this, and I'm heartbroken.

18:23.500 --> 18:26.280
So let's compare the two books.

18:26.280 --> 18:30.020
Was Crave to Conquer plagiarizing Born to be Bound?

18:30.020 --> 18:35.240
Born to be Bound, the world has been decimated by some plague or something, and now everybody

18:35.240 --> 18:37.340
lives in cities under domes.

18:37.340 --> 18:42.720
The Alpha Love Interest is head of a terrorist organization that has taken over the city

18:42.720 --> 18:48.900
with biochemical weapons, and is a massive, chonky big boy.

18:48.900 --> 18:52.000
You think you know what prison is, little one.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.440
You do not.

18:53.440 --> 18:59.260
In prison, one is surrounded by the worst possible breed of men.

18:59.260 --> 19:03.600
If I wanted food or water, I had to kill for it.

19:03.600 --> 19:09.500
He's a bit of a political zealot, and also he and all of his minions escaped from a prison

19:09.500 --> 19:10.500
pit.

19:10.500 --> 19:14.940
That term you use for it, the undercroft, I find it amusing.

19:14.940 --> 19:20.860
A poetic word used to describe a place of darkness, filled with the pleas of thousands,

19:20.860 --> 19:23.420
scraping at the doors to get out.

19:23.420 --> 19:30.040
And also, he lives in the prison pit, and he was born in the darkness, molded by it.

19:30.040 --> 19:31.040
Okay, it's Bane.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.040
It's Bane.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.040
It's obviously Bane.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.040
We get it.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.040
It's Bane.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.600
And for crimes, crime is irrelevant.

19:36.600 --> 19:39.560
I was never condemned to your undercroft.

19:39.560 --> 19:42.080
I was born there.

19:42.080 --> 19:48.080
Enter Claire, an Omega posing as a Beta with the help of hormone pills, who comes to Bane,

19:48.080 --> 19:52.320
I mean Shepard, to beg him for help for her Omega Posse.

19:52.320 --> 19:54.380
Will Bane discover her secret?

19:54.380 --> 19:55.380
Yes.

19:55.380 --> 19:56.380
Immediately.

19:56.380 --> 19:58.700
Crave to Conquer Myth of Omega Book 1.

19:58.700 --> 20:01.900
A large and powerful army has conquered a kingdom.

20:01.900 --> 20:08.580
Their hormone-laden leader, Khal Drogo, or Drako, has promised his followers Omega mates,

20:08.580 --> 20:12.060
even though Omegas have mysteriously disappeared from society.

20:12.060 --> 20:17.780
Enter Caelan, an Omega spy posing as a Beta with the help of magic, who pretends to be

20:17.780 --> 20:21.580
a researcher in order to get into Drako's library.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.560
Will Drako discover her secret?

20:23.560 --> 20:24.560
Yes.

20:24.560 --> 20:25.560
Immediately.

20:25.560 --> 20:30.200
Plot similarities include, but are not limited to, a dearth of Omegas.

20:30.200 --> 20:32.240
Alphas take them hostage.

20:32.240 --> 20:37.680
Omegas are in hiding and trying to suppress hormones, through pills or magic.

20:37.680 --> 20:38.740
But they fail.

20:38.740 --> 20:43.260
The Omega is captured by the Alpha when her magic or pills fail in public and she goes

20:43.260 --> 20:45.520
into heat, nodding.

20:45.520 --> 20:48.160
Dubious consent slash non-consent.

20:48.380 --> 20:51.680
Both of the first books end with the heroine escaping their Alpha.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.100
The list goes on from there.

20:53.100 --> 20:58.180
But does Kane actually have a basis to make the claim that Crave to Conquer was infringing

20:58.180 --> 21:00.220
on Born to be Bound's copyright?

21:00.220 --> 21:03.700
Well here's a Facebook exchange from August of 2018.

21:03.700 --> 21:09.400
So I've read almost all the MF Omegaverse on Amazon, and I read a lot of MM Omegaverse.

21:09.400 --> 21:13.580
There are some differences that I've noticed, other than the obvious, but one of them is

21:13.580 --> 21:18.140
that the MF pairings tend to be rough and almost brutal sometimes.

21:18.140 --> 21:22.420
Even when the Alpha and Omega are in a relationship, or have feelings for each other.

21:22.420 --> 21:25.080
The MM stories tend to be a lot sweeter.

21:25.080 --> 21:29.720
And there isn't the same kind of violence, for lack of a better word, in their matings.

21:29.720 --> 21:33.360
I think the reason the male-female pairings are more violent is because I was the first

21:33.360 --> 21:36.740
to write them, and I'm a non-con, dub-con writer.

21:36.740 --> 21:39.160
What followed suit was keeping in line with the trend.

21:39.160 --> 21:40.160
LOL.

21:40.160 --> 21:41.520
Addison corrupts everyone.

21:44.520 --> 21:45.520
Stunning.

21:45.520 --> 21:50.500
How did you get into writing Omegaverse books, especially MF Omegaverse?

21:50.500 --> 21:54.920
I'm not going to lie, yours were the first ones that I found that were not MM.

21:54.920 --> 21:57.420
I was the first for male-female.

21:57.420 --> 22:02.280
I loved reading Omegaverse fanfiction, but got so frustrated that it never included women.

22:02.280 --> 22:08.720
So I made my own meta, Rules of the Universe, for male-female Omegaverse, and wrote my own.

22:08.720 --> 22:13.880
So Kane claims that she innovated invading queer spaces and making them all normie and

22:13.880 --> 22:15.300
het.

22:15.300 --> 22:18.820
And also, she innovated non-con.

22:18.820 --> 22:20.020
Sure, Jan.

22:20.020 --> 22:22.420
This is also not true.

22:22.420 --> 22:27.060
The first mainstream heterosexual Omegaverse novel that was published by a major publisher

22:27.060 --> 22:32.620
was called Alpha and Omega by Patricia Briggs beginning in 2008.

22:32.620 --> 22:39.180
And the idea that Kane innovated bringing non-con into this fuckery is just...

22:39.180 --> 22:40.780
okay.

22:40.780 --> 22:41.780
Sure, Jan.

22:41.780 --> 22:44.920
This is not the first time that Kane has gone after the competition, either.

22:44.920 --> 22:50.060
In March of 2016, she wrote a Facebook post charging that another author, who wrote under

22:50.060 --> 22:55.120
the pen name The Dragon's Maiden, had copied at least, again, 15 plot points from Born

22:55.120 --> 22:56.300
to Be Bread.

22:56.300 --> 23:00.200
Just so you don't believe her hype, I have tried to be lighthearted about this, but it

23:00.200 --> 23:01.600
has been a nightmare.

23:01.600 --> 23:06.900
I finally posted a response to the plagiarism of BTBB by The Dragon's Maiden in her story

23:06.900 --> 23:08.600
to mate an Omega.

23:08.600 --> 23:11.960
This was my post, which was taken down within 30 minutes.

23:11.960 --> 23:14.240
After the post will be her response.

23:14.240 --> 23:16.960
Do I believe she plagiarized my story?

23:16.960 --> 23:17.960
Yes.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.960
Do I expect everyone to agree with me?

23:19.960 --> 23:20.960
No.

23:20.960 --> 23:23.160
The DMCA will be the final judge of the matter.

23:23.160 --> 23:26.640
I just had to say my piece, and I know you can respect that.

23:26.640 --> 23:31.280
Her response was to shut down all comments and write this.

23:31.280 --> 23:35.240
This isn't meant to sound snide, so please don't take it that way, but I am not going

23:35.240 --> 23:39.540
to stop writing because I know 100% that I am not copying you.

23:39.540 --> 23:41.360
But to the main reason I am messaging you.

23:41.360 --> 23:45.360
If I keep getting rude and threatening messages from your readers, I will start reporting

23:45.360 --> 23:46.360
them.

23:46.360 --> 23:47.840
I woke up to several this morning.

23:47.840 --> 23:51.440
I sincerely hope you aren't encouraging that kind of behavior, but if I find out you

23:51.440 --> 23:54.320
are, I will feel it necessary to report you as well.

23:54.320 --> 23:58.280
If you would like to discuss this farther, please feel free to email me at email removed

23:58.280 --> 23:59.800
to protect her privacy.

23:59.800 --> 24:03.680
Dragon's Maiden denied she had stolen anything, and alleged that

24:03.680 --> 24:08.000
Her fans came after me, even though our stories, other than being Omegaverse, were nothing

24:08.000 --> 24:09.060
alike.

24:09.060 --> 24:13.220
There are some similarities, but I honestly believe that they don't go beyond common

24:13.220 --> 24:15.180
Lycan traits or actual wolf behavior.

24:15.180 --> 24:18.780
Mm, you know, let's just ignore the part about wolf behavior.

24:18.780 --> 24:22.820
Dragon's Maiden quickly caved, deciding it just wasn't worth fighting against Cain

24:22.820 --> 24:25.300
and her fans, and pulled her stories.

24:25.300 --> 24:26.300
Sorry.

24:26.300 --> 24:29.940
Due to the number of comments that are either borderline threatening, you're going to

24:29.940 --> 24:36.660
regret, slash be sorry, etc, or outright threatening, a threat to trace my IP and make me stop writing,

24:36.660 --> 24:39.340
it was recommended to me that I remove my work.

24:39.340 --> 24:43.940
As it stands right now, I have filed a police report due to the harassment.

24:43.940 --> 24:46.260
People like this believe their own lies.

24:46.260 --> 24:50.500
Her story is being taken down for plagiarism, plain and simple.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.860
I have one last point I want to make.

24:52.860 --> 24:58.100
I have not ever stirred up my fans against another writer.

24:58.100 --> 25:02.700
So Cain had gone after other authors before crying copyright infringement, but not with

25:02.700 --> 25:06.580
so much DMCA zealotry as she did with Zoe Ellis.

25:06.580 --> 25:11.500
While the DMCA allows for users to upload stuff without opening up platforms for liability,

25:11.500 --> 25:17.660
it is a touch, to put it mildly, flawed, and is a system, according to legal experts, that

25:17.660 --> 25:19.020
is easily abused.

25:19.020 --> 25:23.700
For instance, authors might weaponize the DMCA to take down their rivals, and megalopolies

25:23.700 --> 25:28.300
like Amazon aren't going to take the time to make sure the DMCA claims are legit.

25:28.300 --> 25:33.180
After all, by nature of the law, the legal liability is on the person making the claim,

25:33.180 --> 25:35.540
not the platform hosting the content.

25:35.540 --> 25:39.580
If DMCA claims aren't legit, it can take months to undo them.

25:39.580 --> 25:40.580
Months of lost income.

25:40.580 --> 25:44.200
And there's no real incentive for platforms like Amazon to be quick about checking those

25:44.200 --> 25:45.200
things out.

25:45.200 --> 25:49.980
In a lot of cases, the only thing you can do is...sue.

25:49.980 --> 26:00.080
So Zoe Ellis sues Addison Cain in Oklahoma federal court, where Ellis' American Digital

26:00.080 --> 26:03.220
Distributor is based, in October of 2018.

26:03.220 --> 26:07.100
The same month, Ellis wrote the following on her website in a post titled,

26:07.100 --> 26:10.060
No one owns a genre, least of all Omegaverse.

26:10.060 --> 26:13.500
Instead of responding to attempts to resolve this issue amicably, the publisher and author

26:13.500 --> 26:17.860
chose to delay communication and persisted with threats of blackmail and attempted intimidation,

26:17.860 --> 26:21.580
as well as continued existing attacks against my character and books in collusion with others.

26:21.580 --> 26:25.180
I've since learned of other MF Omegaverse readers who were similarly targeted by the

26:25.180 --> 26:28.980
same parties, including one who abandoned her story due to threats and takedown attempts.

26:28.980 --> 26:33.380
My publisher, after seeking professional guidance, realized legal action was unavoidable.

26:33.380 --> 26:37.400
Obviously, as a new author, this was a scary conclusion for me, but the various actions

26:37.400 --> 26:41.180
taken by the author and publisher have been astonishingly wide-ranging and consistent,

26:41.180 --> 26:43.580
and can ultimately prevent me from having a successful career.

26:43.580 --> 26:47.620
I wrote my own interpretation of the Omegaverse, creating my own character's world and stories,

26:47.620 --> 26:50.740
and I have the right to publish and promote my work without unprovoked interference and

26:50.740 --> 26:53.460
defamation from others, regardless of their popularity.

26:53.460 --> 26:57.260
Anyone who reads both works without bias can clearly see they are not the same story, even

26:57.260 --> 26:58.940
if they are unfamiliar with the genre.

26:58.940 --> 27:02.580
My publisher has now filed a lawsuit to address these unwarranted attacks on my works and

27:02.580 --> 27:03.580
reputation."

27:03.580 --> 27:08.800
So Ellis sues Kane as an individual, as well as the digital distributor, and the publisher

27:08.800 --> 27:15.060
blushing books, and the anonymous posters that went after Ellis, who she seems to assume

27:15.060 --> 27:19.260
are sock puppets operated by Addison Kane and or her publisher.

27:19.260 --> 27:23.240
In addition to suing her for the wrongful DMCA takedowns, she sues for a whole bunch

27:23.240 --> 27:28.840
of other stuff like malicious interference of contract, copyright misuse, misrepresenting

27:28.840 --> 27:34.200
claims under the DMCA, and a bunch of other torts, negligence, defamation, the list goes

27:34.200 --> 27:35.500
on and on.

27:35.500 --> 27:41.000
The lawsuit effectively begins with outlining what Omegaverse is in a context of genre.

27:41.000 --> 27:47.100
Omegaverse, or Alpha Beta Omega, ABO, or Alpha Beta Omega Dynamics as its slightly broader

27:47.100 --> 27:51.480
category is called, is a collection of related tropes that tend to correlate in many stories.

27:51.480 --> 27:56.040
ABO defines stories in which humans are not only categorized by gender, but also by a

27:56.040 --> 27:57.320
second dynamic.

27:57.320 --> 28:01.600
To be recognized as an Omegaverse, at least some of a vast number of potential characteristics

28:01.600 --> 28:03.000
need to be present.

28:03.000 --> 28:07.040
These include imprinting, the mythology within Omega, scenting, pheromones are excessive,

28:07.040 --> 28:14.120
Omega heat cycles, and Alpha rut, mate bonding, a permanent bond between the partners, nodding,

28:14.120 --> 28:19.760
a physiological condition experienced by the Alpha during mating to aid in pregnancy, male

28:19.760 --> 28:21.400
and female.

28:21.400 --> 28:29.800
A lawyer actually wrote this and, uh, multiple federal judges had to read it.

28:29.800 --> 28:33.640
The lawsuit also puts front and center the fact that authors abusing copyright law in

28:33.640 --> 28:36.520
the romance genre is also nothing new.

28:36.520 --> 28:41.000
The literary world, especially within the romance genre and its sub-genres, has experienced

28:41.000 --> 28:46.640
anti-competitive behavior by certain bad actors attempting to monopolize the industry through

28:46.640 --> 28:52.560
misuse of trademark and copyright law, ranging from misuse of takedown notices to litigation

28:52.560 --> 28:55.320
over the use of a common word in a book title.

28:55.320 --> 28:58.900
Unlawful practices are becoming more and more prevalent.

28:58.900 --> 29:02.240
So let's take a moment to discuss Cockygate.

29:02.240 --> 29:06.840
After the novel Cocky Bastard by Penelope Ward and by Keeland, published by Ever After

29:06.840 --> 29:13.160
Romance, became a big hit in 2015, the genre became flooded with titles involving the word

29:13.160 --> 29:14.600
cocky.

29:14.600 --> 29:19.520
Fine author Felina Hopkins took this a step further to make sure that her novels, Cocker

29:19.520 --> 29:24.960
Brothers, the cocky series, would stay above the dick-hun laden swill by submitting two

29:24.960 --> 29:28.120
trademark claims to the US Patent and Trademark Office.

29:28.120 --> 29:34.040
One, trademarking the usage of the word cocky in certain fonts, and two, officially having

29:34.040 --> 29:38.120
full stop control of the word in all romance novel titles.

29:38.120 --> 29:39.680
Naturally, people disputed this.

29:39.680 --> 29:44.600
It became a huge controversy and a legal battle is still ongoing, but Hopkins did end up releasing

29:44.600 --> 29:49.240
her claims, which means you can expect the sequel to Axiom's end, the cocky bugman

29:49.240 --> 29:52.840
from Planet Cock Gobble, to hit shelves in Fall of 2021.

29:52.840 --> 29:57.560
I don't know if you can tell, but I did not write that line.

29:57.560 --> 30:00.960
So Kane hits back in a blog post on her personal website.

30:00.960 --> 30:03.760
My fight is also yours.

30:03.760 --> 30:07.700
We cannot allow one bad player to change the rules of the game.

30:07.700 --> 30:13.480
We must stand as a community and refute the idea that one author can bully and manipulate

30:13.480 --> 30:17.340
another author over DMCA sent by their publisher.

30:17.340 --> 30:21.920
It sets a dangerous precedent for the next author, who is just trying to protect their

30:21.920 --> 30:24.640
work and their livelihoods.

30:24.640 --> 30:30.880
Just think about all those DMCA authors are sending to stop Travis McRae's pirate website.

30:30.880 --> 30:35.680
Can you imagine if he chose to drag you into court over just one of them?

30:35.680 --> 30:38.160
Unfortunately, I can.

30:38.160 --> 30:41.280
I will no longer keep silent.

30:41.280 --> 30:46.160
It is now time to hashtag get loud.

30:46.160 --> 30:51.680
Kane also started a GoFundMe for her legal fees, which starts with the bolded header.

30:51.680 --> 30:58.040
Authors should not be sued or harassed for their publisher rightfully filing DMCA's.

30:58.040 --> 30:59.760
Rightfully?

30:59.760 --> 31:01.520
Interesting.

31:01.520 --> 31:05.880
This lawsuit is a 512f case, which is actually very rare.

31:05.880 --> 31:09.840
Notice and takedown is the section 512 of the DMCA.

31:09.840 --> 31:14.200
512f is what allows people to sue other people for bogus takedowns.

31:14.200 --> 31:19.800
But it's very rare because, well, it's expensive to sue, and victims of DMCA abuse

31:19.800 --> 31:23.640
usually get mired in the internal bullshit of the platforms they're using before it

31:23.640 --> 31:25.400
gets to the lawsuit point.

31:25.400 --> 31:31.240
Part of the DMCA is you are supposed to consider fair use before you issue a DMCA takedown.

31:31.240 --> 31:35.840
Moreover, someone who is a victim of a false DMCA takedown probably isn't going to be

31:35.840 --> 31:39.640
under the umbrella of a major corporation with a lot of assets.

31:39.640 --> 31:44.440
They are probably going to be a smaller creator, or in this case, a small press without a lot

31:44.440 --> 31:45.440
of resources.

31:45.440 --> 31:52.040
One of the last high profile 512f cases was YouTube suing someone for sending false DMCA

31:52.040 --> 31:56.760
takedowns, because YouTube has the resources to actually go to court and could afford it,

31:56.760 --> 32:00.000
and even in that case, they ended up settling out of court.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.880
So as they were building their case, Ellis' lawyers thought they had a strong position,

32:03.880 --> 32:08.800
but according to that New York Times article, they struggled to find a prior case that addressed

32:08.800 --> 32:12.360
whether fanfiction tropes could be protected by copyright.

32:12.360 --> 32:16.680
Said Gideon Ling Kecum, a lawyer who represents Quill Inc. and Zoe Ellis,

32:16.680 --> 32:21.920
We were looking at cases to see if the courts had ever dealt with anything like this before.

32:21.920 --> 32:27.720
Dealing with the emergence of this new literary genre, we found there weren't any.

32:27.720 --> 32:31.640
But then we get to the deposition, which, like so many elements of this case, seems

32:31.640 --> 32:35.880
weirdly fixated on the originated in fanfic element.

32:35.880 --> 32:39.240
Your book published by Blushing, okay, the first of the books that we're talking about

32:39.240 --> 32:40.240
here, is that fanfiction?

32:40.240 --> 32:42.320
It is not fanfiction.

32:42.320 --> 32:43.860
And why is it not fanfiction?

32:43.860 --> 32:47.600
To be a fanfiction, it has to exist in a universe that you don't own.

32:47.600 --> 32:51.520
When I wrote the story, I hardly used anything from that universe at the time, I just used

32:51.520 --> 32:53.600
like a couple little things here.

32:53.600 --> 32:57.340
When I rewrote the story, all of that was taken out, characters were modified, scenes

32:57.340 --> 33:00.980
were rewritten, so it is definitely not fanfiction.

33:00.980 --> 33:02.940
So let me see if this is a different question.

33:02.940 --> 33:04.760
Is that book in the Omegaverse?

33:04.760 --> 33:06.680
That book is an Omegaverse book.

33:06.680 --> 33:10.060
Are there aspects of the Omegaverse that are manifested in that book that constitute a

33:10.060 --> 33:12.260
reality or universe that you contend you own?

33:12.260 --> 33:14.520
I don't own Omegaverse.

33:14.520 --> 33:17.820
Is there any part of the first book which creates a reality that you contend you do

33:17.820 --> 33:18.820
own?

33:18.820 --> 33:21.020
I do not own Omegaverse.

33:21.020 --> 33:23.580
I understand, that's not what I'm asking.

33:23.580 --> 33:24.580
Okay.

33:24.820 --> 33:29.020
I understood it, and again, I told you there are places where I'm just not going to understand,

33:29.020 --> 33:33.060
because I don't know that much about fanfiction, and I don't know that much about the Omegaverse.

33:33.060 --> 33:37.620
As I understand it, it's not fanfiction, because it's not in a universe that you don't own.

33:37.620 --> 33:41.220
Look, I'll just try this one more time and then I'll drop it, and I'll preface that question

33:41.220 --> 33:42.220
with this.

33:42.220 --> 33:45.780
I'm having a problem with what I perceive as a logical inconsistency.

33:45.780 --> 33:46.780
Okay.

33:46.780 --> 33:47.780
Okay.

33:47.780 --> 33:49.460
Your books are in the Omegaverse.

33:49.460 --> 33:50.460
Yes.

33:50.460 --> 33:51.460
We agree on that.

33:51.460 --> 33:52.460
Nobody owns the Omegaverse.

33:52.460 --> 33:53.460
Exactly.

33:53.540 --> 33:56.500
Fanfiction is books that are set in a universe you don't own.

33:56.500 --> 33:57.500
Yes.

33:57.500 --> 34:00.500
But despite the fact that your books are set in a universe that nobody owns, they're not

34:00.500 --> 34:01.500
fanfiction?

34:01.500 --> 34:02.500
Exactly.

34:02.500 --> 34:03.500
Number on the top.

34:03.500 --> 34:04.500
What is the number on the top?

34:04.500 --> 34:05.500
There are no numbers on the top.

34:05.500 --> 34:06.500
There's letters.

34:06.500 --> 34:07.500
Oh!

34:07.500 --> 34:11.440
Okay, Mr. Lawyer Man, let me help you out.

34:11.440 --> 34:17.740
The confusion here seems to be semantic, and is probably based in the use of the verse

34:17.740 --> 34:18.740
part of the word.

34:18.740 --> 34:24.500
I would agree that something set in the Omegaverse is not fanfiction because Omegaverse is the

34:24.500 --> 34:26.140
name of a subgenre.

34:26.140 --> 34:30.800
The word Omegaverse isn't used in the same way we use phrases like the Marvel Cinematic

34:30.800 --> 34:35.580
Universe, which if you set a story in that, would be considered fanfiction.

34:35.580 --> 34:38.340
So I can see where it could be confusing.

34:38.340 --> 34:43.580
However, that question is completely immaterial to this case and the DMCA.

34:43.580 --> 34:48.860
Whether or not Born to be Bound was or is fanfic has fuck all to do with whether or

34:48.860 --> 34:50.860
not there was plagiarism.

34:50.860 --> 34:55.580
The fact that Omegaverse originates in fanfic is completely immaterial to the legality of

34:55.580 --> 34:56.860
this case.

34:56.860 --> 35:00.920
And I don't understand why these lawyers, or the New York Times for that matter, even

35:00.920 --> 35:04.180
mention that they couldn't find a fanfic-related precedent.

35:04.180 --> 35:09.000
I'm sure one day the legality of fanfic is going to get litigated and it's going to suck.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.580
But what does it have to do with this?

35:10.580 --> 35:16.280
A case of DMCA takedowns being abused by an author trying to snuff out the competition.

35:16.280 --> 35:20.100
Kane claims that Ellis' book hit a lot of the same plot points as hers did.

35:20.100 --> 35:21.280
Which is true.

35:21.280 --> 35:26.620
But in copyright law, there is a doctrine called sans affair that is, you cannot copyright

35:26.620 --> 35:30.560
tropes that consumers expect of a genre.

35:30.560 --> 35:33.260
Take YA Paranormal Romance for example.

35:33.260 --> 35:38.620
You can't copyright the concept of like, a cute but haunted high school boy who is

35:38.620 --> 35:43.720
also secretly a monster of some sort, who becomes obsessed with the clumsy unremarkable

35:43.720 --> 35:44.720
female protagonist.

35:44.720 --> 35:50.520
It's like diamonds.

35:50.520 --> 35:55.480
Pick any two YA Paranormal Romance novels from the early 2010s, and each one is easily

35:55.480 --> 35:59.960
going to share 15 plot points with any other, which if you line them up next to each other

35:59.960 --> 36:05.500
with no context, could look pretty damning, when in reality, that's just part and parcel

36:05.500 --> 36:06.500
of the genre.

36:06.880 --> 36:11.480
In other words, Crave to Conquer is about as similar to Born to be Bound as any of the

36:11.480 --> 36:14.840
shit million Twilight knockoffs were to Twilight.

36:14.840 --> 36:18.500
Born to be Bound and Crave to Conquer, aside from using Omegaverse tropes, aren't even

36:18.500 --> 36:19.880
in the same genre.

36:19.880 --> 36:22.760
One is future dystopia, the other is fantasy.

36:22.760 --> 36:27.140
So while there's no case law directly about genres that have emerged from the internet,

36:27.140 --> 36:28.600
that doesn't really matter.

36:28.600 --> 36:34.520
Copyright, fair use, and sans affair included, are elastic on purpose to fit changing circumstances.

36:34.540 --> 36:39.580
And it must needs be remarked that it is extremely ironic that we have a fanfiction author who

36:39.580 --> 36:44.220
published her erotic fiction which was just Batman fanfic with the serial numbers filed

36:44.220 --> 36:50.460
off, filing DMCA claims against an author who just appears to be using Omegaverse tropes

36:50.460 --> 36:56.660
rather than just repurposing her old fanfiction- I'm sorry, her PUBLISHER filed DMCA claims

36:56.660 --> 37:00.500
against an author who appears to just be using Omegaverse tropes in original fiction.

37:00.500 --> 37:04.340
Addison Cain had nothing to do with those DMCA claims.

37:04.340 --> 37:06.560
See, that's foreshadowing.

37:06.560 --> 37:10.400
So the issue here is that a lot of the tropes that Cain is claiming Ellis infringed upon

37:10.400 --> 37:15.640
aren't just common to the by now well-worn Omegaverse, they're also kind of common to

37:15.640 --> 37:17.920
books.

37:17.920 --> 37:23.840
Omegaverse, and indeed fanfiction as a concept, did not innovate most of these tropes.

37:23.840 --> 37:30.600
The I don't like you slash enemies to lover trope is a feature of most romance novels.

37:30.600 --> 37:34.980
You know, Beast, Beauty, Something Something, Tale as Old as Time.

37:34.980 --> 37:41.220
Like, even the OG Pride and Prejudice does the I don't like you to lovers thing.

37:41.220 --> 37:46.460
Alpha male dub-conning a woman who eventually falls in love with him is also a romance novel

37:46.460 --> 37:47.460
staple.

37:47.460 --> 37:53.420
From the chic in 1919 to bodice-ribbers in the 1970s and 80s to what we see now, sexual

37:53.420 --> 37:57.380
violence turning into true love is nothing new.

37:57.380 --> 38:01.920
The whole Alpha Omega thing is just a roided up version of what you get in bodice-ribbers,

38:01.920 --> 38:06.200
just with, you know, more fluids and, well.

38:06.200 --> 38:10.920
For fuck's sake, well before Omegaverse was even a thing, the common parlance term

38:10.920 --> 38:16.480
for a domineering male hero in the mainstream romance novel genre was, and continues to

38:16.480 --> 38:18.240
be, an Alpha.

38:18.240 --> 38:23.480
And while the dub-con and non-con elements have fallen out of favor in most mainstream

38:23.480 --> 38:28.380
romance novel presses, it's still a big thing in self-published works and small presses

38:28.380 --> 38:29.540
like these.

38:29.540 --> 38:36.180
So to be clear, Addison Cain's publisher is completely in the wrong here.

38:36.180 --> 38:39.420
Those DMCA claims were illegal and illegitimate.

38:39.420 --> 38:42.460
Cain's PUBLISHER is wrong.

38:42.460 --> 38:46.860
Even if Ellis totally stole those ideas from Born to be Bound, the ideas she stole were

38:46.860 --> 38:52.620
too much part and parcel of the subgenre of Omegaverse to possibly constitute copyright

38:52.620 --> 38:56.100
infringement.

38:56.100 --> 39:01.360
So the only way Oklahoma could have jurisdiction is if Addison Cain personally did stuff to

39:01.360 --> 39:06.480
people in the state of Oklahoma, in this case, Zoe Ellis's digital distributor, which is

39:06.480 --> 39:07.740
based in Oklahoma.

39:07.740 --> 39:10.920
So Cain moves to dismiss herself from the Oklahoma case.

39:10.920 --> 39:13.800
She is, after all, a Virginia resident.

39:13.800 --> 39:18.560
And Cain is like, no, I didn't do it, the publisher did it.

39:18.560 --> 39:22.780
I had nothing to do with those DMCA claims.

39:22.780 --> 39:25.500
I've never even been to Oklahoma.

39:25.500 --> 39:28.060
No, it wasn't me.

39:28.060 --> 39:29.540
It was the one-armed man.

39:29.540 --> 39:34.240
So Cain submits an affidavit in an official court document claiming that she had no contacts

39:34.240 --> 39:39.220
with Oklahoma and she had nothing to do with those takedown notices.

39:39.220 --> 39:41.360
That was all Blushing Books.

39:41.360 --> 39:42.640
She didn't know about it.

39:42.640 --> 39:44.420
She didn't have anything to do about it.

39:44.420 --> 39:45.780
Yeah, cross my hair.

39:45.780 --> 39:50.840
In any event, Blushing Books' DMCA notice without Moore is insufficient to satisfy the

39:50.840 --> 39:56.320
requirements of jurisdictional due process over an out-of-state individual.

39:56.320 --> 40:02.580
Moreover, even if the DMCA notice was sent to Draft2Digital in Oklahoma, that communication

40:02.580 --> 40:09.880
would not be attributable to Mrs. did not purposefully direct any activities at Oklahoma,

40:09.880 --> 40:15.540
including drafting or sending the DMCA takedown notice to Draft2Digital or other third parties.

40:15.540 --> 40:21.760
Blushing Books sent the DMCA takedown notice to all of the third-party publishers and retailers,

40:21.760 --> 40:22.760
including Draft2Digital.

40:22.760 --> 40:28.200
Thus, even if the court finds that it can exercise personal jurisdiction over Blushing

40:28.200 --> 40:33.880
Books, which Ms. argues that it cannot, it should dismiss all of plaintiff's claims

40:33.880 --> 40:39.860
against Mrs. because she did not personally direct any acts or activities into the state

40:39.860 --> 40:40.860
of Oklahoma.

40:40.860 --> 40:47.160
I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct, executed on

40:47.160 --> 40:49.480
November 26th, 2018.

40:49.480 --> 40:53.000
So the motion against Cain in Oklahoma is dismissed.

40:53.000 --> 40:57.080
But the case against the publisher, Blushing Books, continues in Oklahoma.

40:57.080 --> 41:01.800
Oh, and also there is a second lawsuit in Virginia where Cain lives.

41:01.800 --> 41:02.800
We'll get to that.

41:02.800 --> 41:07.120
But in the meantime, the charges against Cain are dropped, and it's time for Discovery

41:07.120 --> 41:09.440
in the Oklahoma case.

41:09.440 --> 41:22.620
Discovery is a pretrial procedure in a lawsuit in which each party can obtain evidence from

41:22.620 --> 41:29.220
the other party by means of discovery devices such as interrogatories, requests for documents,

41:29.220 --> 41:31.440
requests for admissions, and so on.

41:31.440 --> 41:36.140
So Quill Inc.'s lawyers demand to see all the correspondence between Cain and her publisher

41:36.140 --> 41:41.100
during this time and… oh boy.

41:41.100 --> 41:46.860
DMCAs have been sent to Amazon, iBooks, Barnes and Nobles, Kobo, and Google Play.

41:46.860 --> 41:50.460
When the books come down and the inevitable backlash begins, this is what I intend to

41:50.460 --> 41:51.980
post on Facebook about it.

41:51.980 --> 41:54.300
If you have any feedback on this, please let me know.

41:54.300 --> 41:55.640
Smiley face.

41:55.640 --> 42:00.580
My publishing house has chosen to take legal action against another author for plagiarism

42:00.580 --> 42:01.580
and…

42:01.580 --> 42:05.300
Your Facebook post is extremely strong and I 100% support you making it.

42:05.300 --> 42:10.000
I think your decision to hide behind blushing and paint us as the instigator is absolutely

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
how it should be.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.420
Let us take the heat.

42:12.420 --> 42:15.620
All you have to say is, my publisher chose to take action.

42:15.620 --> 42:18.100
It was and continues to be out of my hands.

42:18.100 --> 42:19.100
Let people get mad at us.

42:19.100 --> 42:20.100
Hi Anne.

42:20.100 --> 42:21.100
Okay, here are my thoughts.

42:21.100 --> 42:22.500
It's important to take a stand.

42:22.500 --> 42:25.340
After all, blushing books wouldn't just be doing this for me, you're doing it for

42:25.340 --> 42:27.180
blushing's best interests too.

42:27.180 --> 42:29.660
Zoe Ellis is stealing from both of us.

42:29.660 --> 42:33.240
I would not write the author a warning letter, she is aware of what she did and has already

42:33.240 --> 42:35.680
stirred up shit and lied by omission.

42:35.680 --> 42:40.080
File the DMCA's immediately to Amazon, iTunes, and Barnes and Noble, should only take five

42:40.080 --> 42:41.080
minutes each.

42:41.080 --> 42:45.240
If you want to write her afterward with demands to see her financials, by all means, go for

42:45.240 --> 42:46.240
it.

42:46.240 --> 42:50.480
If Amazon, iTunes, and Barnes and Noble comply with the DMCA, which they should considering

42:50.480 --> 42:53.400
the evidence, and a stanker rises, I am prepared for the backlash.

42:53.400 --> 42:55.920
I went through it with Reborn and I'm not afraid.

42:55.920 --> 43:00.600
To settle it down, I will deflect to blushing and remain distant and naive.

43:00.600 --> 43:02.240
Readers sent in complaints.

43:02.240 --> 43:06.840
The publisher filed a DMCA based on evidence they uncovered of copyright infringement.

43:06.840 --> 43:08.880
Any issues should be raised with them.

43:08.880 --> 43:12.800
This is out of my hands and I will remain silent publicly unless it gets to a point

43:12.800 --> 43:17.280
that a single, professional post on the topic, once again deflecting to the publisher, needs

43:17.280 --> 43:18.520
to be posted.

43:18.520 --> 43:21.980
Some people will be reactive right out of the gate, but that's why I have a publisher

43:21.980 --> 43:22.980
to hide behind.

43:22.980 --> 43:24.360
It will pass quickly.

43:24.360 --> 43:26.800
So long as they stay above the fray, we're all good.

43:26.800 --> 43:30.080
I'm very good at not engaging with crazy.

43:30.080 --> 43:39.460
So, if it's not obvious, this is perjury.

43:39.460 --> 43:44.400
She was the one who demanded the DMCA takedowns and her publisher colluded with her to make

43:44.400 --> 43:50.840
it seem like she was this innocent dumbass who had no idea how the system works.

43:50.840 --> 43:52.640
My publisher did everything.

43:52.640 --> 43:56.760
I didn't have anything to do with it.

43:56.760 --> 43:58.920
I agree with the others you've spoken to.

43:58.960 --> 44:02.760
I don't think you will suffer any negative consequences by moving forward.

44:02.760 --> 44:07.520
Amazon might not take the other author's book down, but I don't see you or Blushing

44:07.520 --> 44:09.160
being penalized in any way.

44:09.160 --> 44:13.640
There's no way she could file anything against your book since yours came out two years earlier.

44:13.640 --> 44:14.640
Woof.

44:14.640 --> 44:18.200
I mean, howl.

44:18.200 --> 44:24.080
But here is a particularly prescient observation sent by Blushing Books to Kane right before

44:24.080 --> 44:27.160
they start raining DMCA fire down.

44:27.200 --> 44:31.600
However, before we move ahead, I'd like you to really think about whether you'd

44:31.600 --> 44:32.600
want to do this.

44:32.600 --> 44:33.600
I agree.

44:33.600 --> 44:34.600
It's sickening.

44:34.600 --> 44:36.920
She clearly plagiarized your entire plot.

44:36.920 --> 44:40.320
But that having been said, is this really hurting you?

44:40.320 --> 44:45.680
If anything, fans of her books reading the reviews of her books might buy yours.

44:45.680 --> 44:47.760
Controversy frequently helps books.

44:47.760 --> 44:51.640
I don't think there's a point at which anyone would ever be on Amazon and be trying

44:51.640 --> 44:55.480
to decide between her book and yours and choose hers.

44:55.480 --> 44:58.400
They might read both, but one or the other?

44:58.400 --> 44:59.440
Probably not.

44:59.440 --> 45:03.720
If we move ahead with this, you'll have a profound enemy for life.

45:03.720 --> 45:07.280
Someone who will likely attack you at every opportunity and get all of her friends to

45:07.280 --> 45:08.280
do so.

45:08.280 --> 45:12.320
She'll come up with another pen name and be your worst nightmare.

45:12.320 --> 45:17.880
I'm not trying to tell you to not do it, but I do want you to go in with the clear-eyed

45:17.880 --> 45:22.620
understanding that, as hard as it might be to swallow, doing nothing is an option that

45:22.620 --> 45:24.520
should be on the table.

45:24.560 --> 45:29.760
However, if you want to go ahead with it, blushing supports you 100%.

45:29.760 --> 45:32.560
Now that I've thought it over, both books should be taken down.

45:32.560 --> 45:36.680
She shouldn't profit off screwing me over.

45:36.680 --> 45:38.760
What can I say but yikes.

45:38.760 --> 45:40.760
And it did not end here.

45:40.760 --> 45:46.000
They went back and forth for months trying to keep Ellis' books from making any money,

45:46.000 --> 45:51.600
even after Ellis had successfully fought the claims that originally took her books down.

45:51.600 --> 45:53.880
Her books are back up on iBooks.

45:53.880 --> 45:58.900
They are also on Kobo and Google Play, and I'm super mad, not at you, at this fucked

45:58.900 --> 45:59.900
up situation.

45:59.900 --> 46:03.520
Can we please send out DMCA takedown notices to these people?

46:03.520 --> 46:05.720
Also what are we going to do about Amazon?

46:05.720 --> 46:06.720
Help!

46:06.720 --> 46:10.760
She's lost her Apple account, though her other titles are still on Barnes and Nobles

46:10.760 --> 46:11.760
and Kobo.

46:11.760 --> 46:16.320
I don't know what mechanism we can use to shut her down completely as an author, unless

46:16.320 --> 46:21.520
you want to try to trademark Omegaverse, which we might be able to get.

46:21.520 --> 46:25.320
I think our best strategy right now is to push Amazon hard.

46:25.320 --> 46:29.440
If she loses her account completely, it will in effect shut her down.

46:29.440 --> 46:32.740
If you have a different, better plan or strategy, please share it.

46:32.740 --> 46:34.200
Book 3 needs to come down too.

46:34.200 --> 46:38.280
I don't want her to make any more money off this series.

46:38.280 --> 46:43.480
So um, this is what the kids call a bad look.

46:43.480 --> 46:48.880
So the plaintiffs file a motion that Kane perjured herself, she should be a judge guilty

46:48.880 --> 46:54.320
of civil contempt, and three days later the defendants offer a complete settlement, admit

46:54.320 --> 46:59.520
that Ellis did not infringe on anyone's copyright, they revoke the DMCA takedowns,

46:59.520 --> 47:01.880
and the case is closed.

47:01.880 --> 47:03.880
In Oklahoma, anyway.

47:03.880 --> 47:06.400
Justice is served?

47:06.400 --> 47:09.360
Well hold on there, Pard, this is just the Oklahoma case.

47:09.360 --> 47:12.200
Remember, there is still a case going on in Virginia.

47:12.200 --> 47:18.080
So the Virginia case keeps going, and here is where it gets even weirder.

47:18.080 --> 47:23.400
So the Virginia case is specifically against Kane, not the publisher, because Kane is based

47:23.400 --> 47:24.600
in Virginia.

47:24.600 --> 47:29.080
And while Ellis's claim did involve all the original stuff about like, you know, wrongful

47:29.080 --> 47:35.360
DMCA takedowns, it also has all of this other stuff that is just like way harder to prove

47:35.360 --> 47:40.980
in a court of law, and they probably overshot their load with too many claims.

47:40.980 --> 47:43.320
So most of it gets thrown out.

47:43.320 --> 47:45.280
But you know, whatever, they've got her where they want her.

47:45.280 --> 47:50.040
If the judge or a jury finds Ms. Kane in the wrong, the case would send a message to

47:50.040 --> 47:55.200
overzealous genre writers that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act is not to be abused.

47:55.200 --> 47:58.320
But then it just kind of fizzles out.

47:58.320 --> 48:04.280
Usually in cases like this it's the defendant that becomes insolvent, but here Quillink

48:04.280 --> 48:10.400
dissolved and had to drop the case because apparently they just ran out of money.

48:10.400 --> 48:14.760
And when Quillink lost their counsel, they couldn't hire a new counsel because there's

48:14.760 --> 48:20.060
this like obscure UK law that says you can't do that.

48:20.060 --> 48:26.760
So in order to continue the case, they'd basically have to create a new legal entity in the US

48:26.760 --> 48:28.040
and start over.

48:28.040 --> 48:34.360
And on top of all that, the only part of that case that's still ongoing is Kane's countersuit

48:34.360 --> 48:35.440
in Virginia.

48:35.440 --> 48:41.160
And because this is endless petty fandom bullshit, the counterclaim is for like defamation of

48:41.160 --> 48:47.600
character and emotional damages and more of that shit, accusing also Zoe Ellis of using

48:47.600 --> 48:51.820
sock puppets to like, you know, leave bad reviews.

48:51.820 --> 48:55.000
And what's going on right now is Ellis just seems to have disappeared and is just kind

48:55.000 --> 49:01.040
of ignoring Kane's counterclaim, which is shitty and kind of suspicious in and of itself.

49:01.040 --> 49:07.020
But like at this point, we're way out of the weeds of like DMCA abuse and into just petty

49:07.020 --> 49:08.760
fandom drama.

49:08.760 --> 49:11.380
So I guess we've come full circle.

49:21.920 --> 49:28.320
So one of the benefits of it taking us roughly like four years on average to edit one of

49:28.320 --> 49:35.240
these episodes is that while we were editing it, the case finally got resolved.

49:35.240 --> 49:38.520
And you'll never guess how it ended.

49:38.520 --> 49:44.000
Was there some consequence to Addison Kane and her oops all perjury?

49:44.000 --> 49:48.980
The US federal court in the Eastern District of Virginia has dismissed all of the claims

49:48.980 --> 49:51.800
against me with prejudice.

49:51.800 --> 49:56.440
This is an important victory, not just for myself and my family, but for all authors

49:56.440 --> 50:01.400
who have ever or may ever find themselves in a situation where they must defend their

50:01.400 --> 50:02.400
copyright.

50:02.800 --> 50:03.800
Of course not.

50:03.800 --> 50:06.580
The entire case was dismissed with prejudice.

50:06.580 --> 50:12.880
And Kane really wants you to know that in a post she titled a win for the author community.

50:12.880 --> 50:18.380
So the lesson learned here seems to be doubling down.

50:18.380 --> 50:20.260
I didn't do anything wrong.

50:20.260 --> 50:24.800
The DMCA takedowns were valid and I'm the real victim here.

50:24.800 --> 50:35.080
For those new to legal jargon, it is a serious matter for a judge to dismiss counts of a

50:35.080 --> 50:37.320
lawsuit with prejudice.

50:37.320 --> 50:41.260
And it is only done in the most egregious of circumstances.

50:41.260 --> 50:46.520
So I spent like my entire Saturday digging through every single court document in this

50:46.520 --> 50:48.080
stupid case.

50:48.080 --> 50:53.540
And I couldn't find any that were actually submitted by the court that used with prejudice

50:53.540 --> 50:58.600
in their verbiage anywhere except for the defendant's motion to dismiss the case where

50:58.600 --> 51:02.060
they request that the court dismiss it with prejudice.

51:02.060 --> 51:07.280
And the motion was granted, but the word prejudice with or without doesn't come up at all.

51:07.280 --> 51:13.860
And that's because with prejudice is kind of implied when a case is dismissed for failure

51:13.860 --> 51:16.260
to prosecute as was the case here.

51:16.260 --> 51:20.100
They fizzled out and missed a bunch of deadlines and they pissed the judge off and the judge

51:20.100 --> 51:21.500
was like, okay, screw it.

51:21.500 --> 51:24.220
You clearly aren't taking this seriously.

51:24.220 --> 51:30.020
That is why the case was dismissed, not because the DMCA takedowns are valid.

51:30.020 --> 51:35.700
And she's definitely wrong about with prejudice only being done in the most egregious of circumstances

51:35.700 --> 51:38.440
because with prejudice is pretty much the default.

51:38.440 --> 51:42.520
If your claims get dismissed, it's usually with prejudice.

51:42.520 --> 51:46.260
And in this case, the judge probably doesn't bother even stating with prejudice in the

51:46.260 --> 51:51.660
court documents because it's not the all-caps big deal she seems to think it is.

51:51.660 --> 51:54.660
Think how they scrum and they see how I do it.

51:54.660 --> 51:56.520
Dismissed with prejudice.

51:56.520 --> 52:00.180
If anything, it's more unusual for cases to be dismissed without prejudice.

52:00.180 --> 52:05.140
I mean, it's not uncommon, but with prejudice is more common.

52:05.140 --> 52:08.820
Basically, the case was dismissed because it was clear that the plaintiff could not

52:08.820 --> 52:13.100
move forward, not because the case itself was without merit.

52:13.100 --> 52:18.060
And don't get me wrong, some of it was, but the stuff surrounding copyright and DMCA,

52:18.060 --> 52:22.760
especially since Cain perjured herself in the Oklahoma case, they had a pretty good

52:22.760 --> 52:23.760
case there.

52:23.760 --> 52:28.300
And Cain is right about some things, namely how suspicious and weird it is that Zoe Ellis

52:28.300 --> 52:33.240
created the case in Virginia and then just kind of fizzled it out and liquidated her

52:33.240 --> 52:36.980
own company, meaning Cain can't pursue her counterclaim.

52:36.980 --> 52:41.380
Like, yeah, that is a little sus, but again, that has nothing to do with the validity of

52:41.380 --> 52:46.060
the DMCA takedowns or any damages Ellis might have incurred because of them.

52:46.060 --> 52:49.860
She goes on to state that the settlement between Blushing and Quilt Link that happened in the

52:49.860 --> 52:55.100
Oklahoma case after she was dismissed from it is legally meaningless.

52:55.100 --> 53:00.820
Instead, Blushing made a single statement to avoid further litigation claiming no plagiarism

53:00.820 --> 53:04.440
had occurred and that their DMCA's were invalid.

53:04.440 --> 53:06.980
That statement legally means nothing.

53:06.980 --> 53:09.740
Wait, wait, no.

53:10.460 --> 53:13.180
Yes, actually, it means a lot.

53:13.180 --> 53:17.220
It means they broke the law and are admitting that they broke the law.

53:17.220 --> 53:20.260
The funny thing here is that she undermines her own point.

53:20.260 --> 53:26.180
Like plagiarism is not a legal term, therefore plagiarism is not technically illegal in the

53:26.180 --> 53:32.620
way that like stabbing is not a legal term, therefore stabbing is not technically illegal,

53:32.620 --> 53:37.060
but assault with a deadly weapon is ipso facto.

53:37.060 --> 53:41.100
If there was no plagiarism, then there was no copyright infringement.

53:41.100 --> 53:42.780
The thing that is illegal.

53:42.780 --> 53:47.940
By definition, a settlement means an agreement to resolve the legal dispute by both parties

53:47.940 --> 53:49.480
prior to trial.

53:49.480 --> 53:51.780
No judge ruled on the case.

53:51.780 --> 53:57.060
And by definition, like she keeps saying this too, by definition, like you sound like Ben

53:57.060 --> 53:58.060
Shapiro.

53:58.060 --> 54:01.380
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet ass fjord.

54:01.380 --> 54:05.020
Well, by definition, copyright is the right to make copies.

54:05.020 --> 54:07.020
Okay, now that is a fact.

54:07.020 --> 54:08.420
It is right there in the word.

54:08.420 --> 54:09.780
Copyright is the right to make copies.

54:09.780 --> 54:12.260
It is easier to prove than plagiarism.

54:12.260 --> 54:15.540
But if there was no plagiarism, it's right there in the word, then there was no copyright

54:15.540 --> 54:18.260
infringement because copies were not made.

54:18.260 --> 54:20.660
Is Ben Shapiro going to sue me now?

54:20.660 --> 54:25.460
But she is wrong in that the settlement in the Oklahoma case is legally meaningless.

54:25.460 --> 54:29.400
Most settlements are confidential, so we never know what the terms are.

54:29.400 --> 54:34.720
So blushing admitting in a court document that the DMCA's were invalid actually does

54:34.720 --> 54:40.400
give it some precedential effect over any future cases that might argue over these same

54:40.400 --> 54:41.400
details.

54:41.400 --> 54:45.560
So if only in a minor way, maybe blushing admitting that they were in the wrong to the

54:45.560 --> 54:48.000
court is actually kind of a good thing.

54:48.000 --> 54:54.800
Not a big win, but one minor precedent to defend against DMCA abuse.

54:54.800 --> 54:55.800
Go team.

54:55.800 --> 55:00.920
But the most batshit, unhinged from reality claim that she makes in this whole thing is

55:00.920 --> 55:06.520
in response to the question of why did you send DMCA takedowns for the third Myth of

55:06.520 --> 55:11.660
Omega book, which at that time had not even come out yet, and therefore you could not

55:11.660 --> 55:13.100
have read.

55:13.100 --> 55:17.120
Because both my Alpha's Claim trilogy and Zoe Ellis's trilogy were meant to be read

55:17.120 --> 55:22.700
as a whole, books one and two ending in a cliffhanger, therefore I believed that the

55:22.700 --> 55:26.760
unpublished book was a derivative work.

55:26.760 --> 55:29.120
I own trilogies now?

55:29.120 --> 55:33.480
She then goes on to cast every other person involved but herself as the villain.

55:33.480 --> 55:39.160
She's super mad about that New York Times article, and they were way nicer to her than

55:39.160 --> 55:45.680
I was, and certainly nicer than the A-Lab podcast, which I definitely listened to and

55:45.680 --> 55:53.200
found very helpful in establishing the timeline for this wacky, crazy shenanigans.

55:53.200 --> 55:58.160
I'm not going to repeat some of the things they said, but the New York Times was way

55:58.160 --> 56:01.920
nicer than they were, and certainly nicer than I was.

56:01.920 --> 56:07.680
Interestingly, the same month the article ran, the NYT parted ways with at least one

56:07.680 --> 56:12.900
editor who admitted an article was rushed into publication, that the editing process

56:12.900 --> 56:18.980
was flawed, and shockingly, then admitted to not even reading the op-ed before it ran

56:18.980 --> 56:20.120
online.

56:20.120 --> 56:25.640
So she connects the integrity of the editor of Alexandra Alter, who wrote the original

56:25.640 --> 56:33.960
New York Times article, to the op-ed editor who resigned after asking Tom Cotton to write

56:33.960 --> 56:37.360
a pro-police brutality op-ed.

56:37.360 --> 56:42.640
Like these two are even in the same department, implying that these two editors, who happen

56:42.640 --> 56:47.960
to work for the same paper at the same time, are the same person.

56:47.960 --> 56:52.200
Like this is the level of intellectual honesty we are dealing with here.

56:52.200 --> 56:58.480
In fact, Zoe Ellis sat down with a journalist for the NYT, who rushed the story, failed

56:58.480 --> 57:05.920
to cite sources, failed to remain unbiased, and misquoted both myself and the facts.

57:05.920 --> 57:10.080
Oh my god, the article is the citation!

57:10.080 --> 57:16.520
Like this isn't a blog, this isn't like a peer-reviewed journal entry, Addison.

57:16.520 --> 57:19.240
Newspaper articles don't have footnotes.

57:19.240 --> 57:24.600
Blushing Books, who totally threw themselves in front of the bus for Addison a year earlier,

57:24.600 --> 57:26.680
is also the bad guy now.

57:26.680 --> 57:31.640
During this experience, I learned that my former publisher, Blushing Books, had never

57:31.640 --> 57:37.780
filed copyrights for any of my books, despite what I believe was a contractual responsibility

57:37.780 --> 57:38.780
to do so.

57:38.780 --> 57:39.780
What?

57:39.780 --> 57:41.280
What do you mean you believe?

57:41.280 --> 57:44.540
Like, read your freaking contract!

57:44.540 --> 57:49.860
You can check if they violated their contractual obligation.

57:49.860 --> 57:51.620
You can sue them.

57:51.620 --> 57:57.980
And if they didn't ever say they were going to file your copyright for you, then you didn't

57:57.980 --> 57:58.980
read your contract.

57:58.980 --> 58:02.220
But that doesn't mean that Blushing is necessarily innocent here either.

58:02.220 --> 58:06.680
The blog post reveals that Cain and Blushing had a big falling out during the Oklahoma

58:06.680 --> 58:10.740
case in which she got the rights to distribute her book back.

58:10.740 --> 58:16.780
And she very peddly shows an email between Blushing and another author showing that Blushing

58:16.780 --> 58:21.940
basically had no clue what they were doing and understood nothing about copyright law

58:21.940 --> 58:24.660
and what actually constitutes copyright infringement.

58:24.660 --> 58:29.020
How many assholes we got on this ship anyhow?

58:29.020 --> 58:30.020
Go!

58:30.020 --> 58:34.900
Cain then goes after the Romance Writers of America and is very upset about the RWA protecting

58:34.900 --> 58:35.900
Blushing.

58:35.900 --> 58:39.580
Like, what are you talking about?

58:39.580 --> 58:45.860
Blushing has been on notice as a, like, bad publisher by the RWA since 2019.

58:45.860 --> 58:49.380
And here she is trying and failing to start shit with another, much more famous romance

58:49.380 --> 58:55.140
novelist who had earlier opined on the case and incidentally is a lawyer herself.

58:55.140 --> 58:58.620
Everyone is enemy mine and I am the wronged one.

58:58.620 --> 59:02.060
Like, maybe you're the problem Taylor Swift.

59:02.060 --> 59:03.060
Oof.

59:03.060 --> 59:05.060
Internet was a mistake.

59:06.060 --> 59:11.780
So she's trying really hard to frame this as an I was right all along and this is a

59:11.780 --> 59:15.820
win for authors and I'm helping you actually.

59:15.820 --> 59:21.740
When in reality, after the details of her involvement and malice and subsequent perjury

59:21.740 --> 59:28.020
were revealed to the court in the Oklahoma case, her publisher settled because their

59:28.020 --> 59:33.020
author perjured herself and Cain got to walk away with effectively no consequences from

59:33.020 --> 59:39.620
that while the other lawsuit against her in another state fizzled and died for completely

59:39.620 --> 59:43.140
unrelated reasons.

59:43.140 --> 59:46.420
And that is how it ends.

59:46.420 --> 59:47.420
That was pointless.

59:47.420 --> 59:54.620
I don't know if you could see what I was doing there.

59:54.620 --> 59:56.620
It was like a visual joke.

59:56.620 --> 01:00:02.220
Alpha, beta, omega.

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:06.260
Do you think a depressed person could make this?

01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:07.420
No.

01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:12.820
So if you were reading this as an invitation to go harass this woman, first of all, what

01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:16.100
the hell is wrong with you and also why are you even watching my channel?

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:17.500
Second, don't.

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:20.620
But this is less a cautionary tale of one vindictive author.

01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:24.660
The New York Times article claims that it raises a deep legal question, but it isn't

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:27.700
really a deep legal question about who owns ideas.

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:33.860
If there is a deep legal question, it is how can people without the resources of giants

01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:38.020
like YouTube protect themselves from bad faith DMCA claims?

01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:44.500
DMCA counterclaims do exist as a barrier and Zoe Ellis did use them, but clearly that wasn't

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:49.340
enough because Cain and Blushing steamrolled right through them and kept issuing takedowns

01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:50.340
for months.

01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:55.420
A lot of the focus on this case was on the weird fanfic subculture and not the fact that

01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:59.820
cases like this can and often do set important legal precedents.

01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:04.420
To me, this is less about a too horny on main train wreck as much as it is a good example

01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:11.380
of how laws designed to protect giant corporations are written in presumed good faith and assume

01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:14.220
that everyone is going to play by the rules.

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:17.940
I tried to protect authors.

01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:26.300
Well, as a fellow USA Today best-selling author who writes extremely niche trash involving

01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:32.940
questionable use of non-human anatomies, I cannot say I feel protected by this.

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:37.460
If she had won this thing, which she didn't, that would have meant, despite her claims

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:42.740
to the contrary, that you can actually own genre tropes, which would make creating that

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:47.660
much more difficult and give bad faith actors that much more arsenal to attack their fellow

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:48.660
artists.

01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:53.100
And in cases like these, we do kind of need to say something when bad faith actors try

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:58.340
to use this sort of thing to their advantage and might inadvertently strengthen already

01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:03.980
draconian copyright law pushed by the likes of the Walt Disney Company and all for your

01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:06.180
petty vindictive bullshit.

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:09.380
So this this attitude is bad.

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:10.380
Don't do it.

01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:11.380
You can't own tropes.

01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:15.380
I've learned you can do anything you want as long as you put your mind to it.

01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:18.340
But I've also learned that reading is bad.

01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:20.720
So we did have a lot of help writing this.

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:26.900
I learned a lot about reading court documents and me and Angelina had to read a lot of torture

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:27.900
porn.

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:30.680
I mean that in the most literal sense.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.540
Porn with torture.

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:33.720
Literal torture porn.

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:36.340
It's like snuff for her.

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:41.300
Thanks especially to Stacy Lantane of the University of Mississippi School of Law and

01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:45.140
Catherine Trindacosta with the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:50.740
The EFF is the leading nonprofit defending digital privacy and free speech and a portion

01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:54.660
of the profits of this video are going to be donated to the EFF.

01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:59.100
Take care, you beautiful people, and remember to wear a mask in public.

01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:06.020
And if this video mysteriously disappears for, I don't know, some reason, I guess we'll

01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:07.020
see you in court.

01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:16.140
Bye.

01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:17.140
Bye.

01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:17.140


01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:16.140
Bye.
