0	25480	with a wanton mom she still calling out obscenities full of coerced rapture until only his name
25480	35240	was on her lips. The **** grew, his **** as it could go the instant her muscles began
35240	42280	clenching rhythmically to draw out ****. Watching him grunt like a beast, Claire felt the ****
42280	49200	lost in the rapture of her greedy **** milking his **** until **** with the stuff. While
49200	54680	the **** persisted, Shepherd looked into disoriented green eyes and demanded roughly, whose name
54680	60160	did you call as you ****? Claire could hardly breathe, was on the ebb of a powerful **** that
60160	67900	shook her to her bones, she whispered trying not to cry, yours. Because I am your alpha.
67900	74160	It was almost a roar. You want to be **** by me, do you understand? I'm the only man you
74160	80280	will ever **** from this moment on. Drocco roared. I will not share you, ever. You will
80280	84440	never have an opportunity to **** anyone else. His hand tightened around her neck as
84440	89600	he leaned in, growling. No other man alive should have had what I own. You will tell
89600	93180	me who they are and where they are and then you will declare me your alpha. Watching her
93180	99480	lips form words, dissecting the tortured desire and uncontrolled pleasure, he **** even faster,
99480	106640	snarling like a beast, still **** with **** he demanded. Who do you belong to? There were
106640	110920	tears leaking from the eyes squeezed shut as she jerked and twitched from his abused
110920	123440	**** and ******* prolonged too far. Please, please stop. I can't. Who do you belong to?
123440	132440	Face full of pain, pleasure, Claire gasped. I belong to you. That's right, little one.
132440	137440	She became a voice as if leagues away. The ******* ******* abated and she sobbed when
137440	142680	the overstrong extended ******* ******* began to abate. More waves of ******* ******* burned
142680	147680	her from the inside when Shepherd purred, you belong only to me.
147680	166240	Hey everyone, get set to get wet. So a few months ago there was this article in the New
166240	171960	York Times with the title, a feud in wolf kink erotica raises a deep legal question,
171960	176520	subheader, what do copyright and authorship mean in the crowdsourced realm known as the
176520	182400	Omegaverse? And I gotta tell you, this article doesn't even come close to scratching the
182400	187520	surface of how coconuts this whole thing is. So where to start? Okay, so there was this
187520	194880	lawsuit surrounding some works of fiction that incorporated the fanfic trope known as
194880	201680	ABO or Omegaverse, and one thing led to another, and before you know it, the New York Times
201680	208600	gets to explain concepts like estrus cycles, claiming bites, forced impregnation, nodding,
208600	218000	which is, well, it's like, apparently it's a feature of wolf anatomy. It's got everything.
218000	227840	Sock puppetry, falsified documents, violent heat cycle, perjury, spurts of, well, oh no!
227840	232360	It's like the tiger king of wolf porn. And the deep legal question is, in effect, who
232360	238640	owns ideas? Where do you draw the line between what is and is not worthy of copyright? And
238640	245040	why does it involve so much bodily fluid? You're like the loudest climaxer I've ever
245040	249760	heard. It was like the sound of a 30 year old sprinkler finally going off for the first
249760	265360	time. So what is the Omegaverse? So I'm just going to call this a subgenre of erotica,
265360	270000	because if you ignore the fanfic specificity, that's all it is. The concept of Omegaverse
270000	274360	originally started as a subgenre of erotic speculative fanfiction in the supernatural
274360	280480	fandom and found broader appeal in the sprawling mega-fandom known as Super Hoolock, an amalgam
280480	285800	of Supernatural, Sherlock, and Doctor Who in the early 2010s. These stories are characterized
285800	291320	by alternate human societies, which are divided into a dominance hierarchy like wolves, but
291320	295880	not like real wolves, more like that study that divided wolves into alphas and betas
295880	300800	that was later debunked by the guy who did the original study. So it's based on like
300800	307040	bad wolf science. These societies contain alphas, the dominating alphas, the big boys,
307040	312000	the dick swingers, the betas. Despite its current common use as a pejorative for a submissive
312000	318300	man, betas in ABO are neutral. They're like the normies. Like sure, they will do the do,
318300	323340	but they don't go into like uncontrollable pheromone rages at the smell of an omega's
323340	329280	heat cycle. Speaking of which, omegas, the submissive, the soft boys, the seduces who
329280	333800	find themselves drawn to the shit-lording of alphas because they're pheromones or
333800	339360	whatever. The subgenre also includes other esoterica and tropes of wolf behavior like
339360	347840	mating for life, rutting, heat cycles, nodding, sense marking, claiming bites, and impreg,
347840	352320	which if the portmanteau doesn't tell you enough, is the ability for male characters,
352320	357080	usually omegas, to get pregnant. I don't think wolves can do that, but it is an important
357080	363640	staple of the genre. Any fictional property can be omegaversed. Lord of the Rings, Supernatural,
363640	370520	One Direction, Game of Thrones, Transformers, hell, there's even HAMILTON omegaverse fan
370520	377640	fiction and fan art. Like, a lot. So I stopped being actively involved in creating and consuming
377640	382860	fanworks around the time I started making internet videos back in the 1960s, so I kind
382860	389360	of phased out before this trend became popular. So while I had heard of it, my first real
389360	393700	exposure to the whole omegaverse thing was the New York Times article.
393700	397860	He knew for certain now that he did not want a submissive omega. When Kaylin had threatened
397860	402940	him, her voice low and possessive, her eyes flashing, her body ready to pounce, he almost
402940	405060	came in his pants.
405060	406060	Wow.
406260	407260	Wow.
415540	420100	So this brave new world is all very strange and confusing to me. I'm like Grandpa Simpson
420100	421100	over here.
421100	426980	I used to be with it, but then they changed what it was. Now what I'm with isn't it, and
426980	429540	what's it seems weird and scary to me.
429540	434900	But at the end of the day, it's just fanfic. Where could a lawsuit possibly come into this?
434940	440140	Well, since this trope is so popular, it was only a matter of time before people decided,
440140	442860	hey, I could make money off of this.
448860	453860	Commercial publication of omegaverse fiction is said by some to have started with 2007's
453860	459580	With Caution by J.L. Langley, but like the overwhelming majority of omegaverse fanfiction,
459580	461660	it centered male-male relationships.
461660	467460	The commonality of male-male pairings is the crux of the most batshit copyright claim ever.
467460	469660	Enter Addison Cain.
469660	475900	Now this is not her real name, but I'm going to just refer to her by her pen name because.
475900	481140	So Addison Cain, of course, like so many of us, begins her career as a fanfic writer.
481140	484980	She finds her fanfic calling writing erotic The Dark Knight Rises fanfiction starting
484980	489500	in 2012, and quickly becomes something of a darling in the fandom.
489500	494100	And like E.L. James before her, she starts to think, hey, maybe there's money to be
494100	500180	made here. So she pulls her fanfic and begins the process of revising it into something
500180	501340	that she can sell.
501340	505100	And while we are here, one of the many negative side effects of the infamous popularity of
505100	509780	books like Fifty Shades of Grey is this presumption that any professional author who so much as
509780	515940	admits to having been in fandom is just repurposing their old fanfic, and if they say they aren't,
515940	517700	they are probably lying about it.
517700	522140	I've seen a lot of people make that assumption about me just because I've joked about having
522140	526860	written fanfic in the past. Most fanfic authors who jump to professional authorship do not
526860	531360	just repurpose their old fanfic. Naomi Novik, for instance, got her start in the Master
531360	535860	and Commander fandom in the early 2000s, so that influence was there when she published
535860	541380	the Temeraire series, which is basically the Napoleonic Wars but with dragons. And a lot
541380	546780	of people who have read my book can tell that I have spent some time in the Transformers
546780	547780	fandom.
547780	550860	But these are not just works of fanfiction repackaged for profit. However, there are
550860	556700	some high profile examples of authors doing just that, a practice called filing the serial
556700	561360	numbers off. Some authors have found tremendous success with taking their fanfic and turning
561360	566020	it into original fiction. Fifty Shades of Grey was originally a Twilight fanfic, Cassandra
566020	571300	Clare's Mortal Instruments series began life as a Draco fanfic, After was a Wattpad
571300	576860	One Direction fanfic about a bad boy version of Harry Styles in college, and this is the
576860	583220	business model that Addison Cain, erotic Dark Knight Rises fanfic writer, hopes to hit paydirt
583220	584220	with.
584220	588420	Most publishers reject or ignore her queries, but eventually small indie publisher Blushing
588420	592840	Books accepts her manuscript for what would become the first book in a series, Born to
592840	598400	Be Bound, and the series soon earns over $370,000.
598400	602960	When she grew tamer as the overblown reaction to Force Estrus lessened, she would stay still
602960	609000	long enough for him to scent her, for his big hands to rub the b****** that had l******
609000	613480	all over her skin, to f*** it to her as he purred and gave affection.
613480	614480	Damn.
614480	621000	So, Cain becomes something of a star in the budding commercial Omegaverse published arena,
621000	624600	especially, according to Cain, in the MF field.
624600	629160	What in the fanfic world is called het, because fanfiction is one of the rare arenas where
629160	633720	heterosexual couplings are actually in the minority, but of course since this genre turns
633720	637880	out to be lucrative, she's not the only one doing it.
637880	640360	Enter author Zoe Ellis.
640360	643440	No relation, because it's not her real name either.
643440	650400	Zoe Ellis is the nom de plume of writing for Quill Inc's Books, which is a small publisher
650400	651820	based in London.
651820	656900	Her novel, Crave to Conquer, the first book in the Myth of Omega series, is published
656900	658560	in 2018.
658560	665080	Like Born to be Bound, it is also Omegaverse, also het, and also extremely violent and unpleasant
665080	666120	to read.
666120	667120	And I don't recommend it.
667120	674160	I don't know what I expected.
674160	680240	So not long after, someone approaches Cain and says, hey, this book seems to lift a lot
680240	684120	of plot points from your book, I think it might be plagiarism?
684120	686320	And of course, Cain does not take this well.
686320	688780	Well, Cain's publisher does not take this well.
688780	693460	She does not see this as a rising tide lifts all ships scenario, which generally in genres
693460	694840	like this it totally is.
694840	699160	Oh no, she sees a rival horning in on her territory.
699160	700720	Sinting it, you might say.
700720	710680	Anyway, Zoe Ellis must be destroyed.
710680	716640	In April of 2018, Cain's publisher, Blushing Books, sends DMCA takedown notices to Amazon,
716640	720120	Barnes and Noble, Google Play, Kobo, and iTunes.
720120	724680	Blushing claims that Crave to Conquer did a copyright infringement by lifting multiple
724680	729440	plot points from Born to be Bound, and that while Cain did not invent Omegaverse, she
729440	738000	did invent Het Omegaverse, which, hmm.
738000	740080	Anyway, DMCA takedown notices.
740080	744060	We hear a lot about them, but few know how they actually work or what they are supposed
744060	745060	to do.
745060	748800	Maybe we could get a lawyer to explain it.
748800	750360	Real phone call happening.
750360	751360	Hello?
751360	754240	Hey Lindsay, what's up?
754240	756880	Hey, Devin of Legal Eagle.
756880	762520	Have you heard about this Omegaverse lawsuit that are happening?
762520	767040	Yeah, I know a fair amount about copyright law, but I don't know anything about wolf
767040	768040	pornography.
768040	769760	Yeah, that's fine.
769760	770760	Okay.
770760	776120	So the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, was a law that was written in the very
776120	781560	early days of the internet to decide who would be liable for hosting copyright infringing
781560	782560	material.
782560	787180	It would be easy to imagine a world where a website was responsible for the content
787180	788460	that its users uploaded.
788460	793720	You can imagine that if a user uploaded some copyright infringing material, that the rights
793720	798100	holders could go after the platform for damages, and in that world, it would be way easier
798100	803000	to get damages from the website or platform instead of the random user who uploaded it.
803000	808260	The problem is that if that were the case, then no one would host a website that allowed
808260	812780	users to upload material because they would always be at the mercy of all of these copyright
812780	813860	suits.
813860	820000	So Congress decided in their infinite wisdom in the mid nineties that it made sense to
820000	826280	give away for platforms to have immunity from these copyright infringement lawsuits.
826280	831540	Section 512 of the DMCA actually gives platforms a safe harbor so that they're not responsible
831540	836040	for the content that their users upload if it's infringing of copyright.
836040	840120	But in able to receive that safe harbor, they actually have to do certain requirements.
840120	844640	The main requirement is that if a website or platform receives a notice, a DMCA notice
844640	849800	that some content that they're hosting infringes of someone's copyright, then they have to
849800	850800	take that down.
850800	851840	That's called a DMCA notice.
851840	857240	On the other hand, a user who believes that this DMCA takedown notice was given in error
857240	862520	can issue what's called a DMCA counter notice and get the content put back up.
862520	868080	So generally speaking, when a platform like YouTube, let's say, receives a proper DMCA
868080	873380	takedown notice notifying them that some material infringes on someone's copyright and they
873380	879400	take that material down, then the DMCA gives them a safe harbor and prevents YouTube specifically
879400	882520	from being sued for copyright infringement.
882520	887200	Now in exchange, copyright holders no longer have to go to court to get things taken down.
887200	889580	They just need to send a form.
889620	895580	So in a way, it can avoid a whole bunch of litigation costs when some user uploads some
895580	899480	content that's not theirs to upload in the first place.
899480	904940	So a DMCA takedown notice is a party claiming that a platform is hosting some content that's
904940	906660	illegally infringing on copyright.
906660	911580	And you can see how powerful this tool could be in the wrong hands that you can take down
911580	917380	almost any website or video that's on the internet so long as you make a DMCA claim,
917380	922300	which is why the DMCA requires you to have a good faith basis that there's copyright
922300	926480	infringement going on, that you have to swear under the penalty of perjury that you actually
926480	932620	own the underlying content that was infringed and that there was actually copyright infringement
932620	933740	going on.
933740	939420	Because if you're going to be making a claiming bite, you had better be ready to pair bond
939420	940420	for life.
940420	944480	I have no idea what that means, but Lindsay says it makes sense in context.
944480	946660	So there you go, I guess.
946660	950780	But when we're talking about the DMCA, if you're a platform, you can get in trouble
950780	954120	for refusing to take down different material.
954120	960060	If you refuse a DMCA takedown notice, then and only then can the underlying rights holder
960060	961340	sue the platform.
961340	966580	So if YouTube gets a DMCA claim and they say, no, we're going to leave this video up, then
966580	968980	they can be sued for copyright infringement.
968980	973620	But if they take the video down, then they're not liable to anyone, which is why you see
973620	979900	a lot of platforms, whether it's Twitter or Amazon or YouTube, they just get the DMCA
979900	984460	takedown notices and take those videos down because it's no skin off their nose and they
984460	989940	don't have to do an independent analysis to determine whether the video or other IP actually
989940	991460	does the infringing.
991460	994540	That's up to the person that made the claim.
994540	1000440	And if the person made a claim that isn't valid, then they can be liable in court for
1000440	1002280	that invalid DMCA takedown.
1002280	1006400	So that's why you get a lot of platforms that are removing content without doing an
1006400	1011140	independent analysis because there's no reason for them to do any kind of independent analysis.
1011140	1017440	So this is a really complicated area of the law, but that is DMCA liability in a nutshell.
1017440	1021460	I cannot believe I just talked about wolf c**t for f**king five.
1021460	1026260	So Blushing Books issues DMCA claims across all platforms and all of Zoe Ellis's books
1026260	1027960	get taken down.
1027960	1033100	Even people who bought the book on e-readers like Kendall, the book magically disappears
1033100	1034620	from their devices.
1034620	1038820	So here is a big problem with the whole DRM thing, but we aren't getting into that today.
1038820	1043720	On April 19th, 2018, Kane wrote this Facebook post for her fans.
1043720	1048600	My publishing house has chosen to take legal action against another author for plagiarism
1048600	1051900	and copyright infringement of one of my books.
1051900	1056020	They own the rights to print and distribute my story, and should an outside influence
1056020	1060200	try to profit from it, they are legally bound to respond.
1060200	1062600	This is outside of my control.
1062600	1065120	Please consider that this is very serious.
1065120	1069200	A publishing house does not make a move like this without solid evidence and the full knowledge
1069200	1071440	that any legal battle is already won.
1071440	1074040	I am sick to my stomach thinking about it.
1074040	1075920	I wish this had never happened.
1075920	1080880	I apologize to every single one of you who were affected by this mess.
1080880	1084080	I apologize to anyone who has been upset by this.
1084080	1089820	And lastly, I apologize to my fans, and the fans of Omegaverse.
1089820	1091500	No one is winning here.
1091500	1096340	For the torches and pitchforks that will inevitably come my way, please remember that I'm just
1096340	1099300	a regular person stuck in the middle of this mess too.
1099300	1103500	I never asked for this, and I'm heartbroken.
1103500	1106280	So let's compare the two books.
1106280	1110020	Was Crave to Conquer plagiarizing Born to be Bound?
1110020	1115240	Born to be Bound, the world has been decimated by some plague or something, and now everybody
1115240	1117340	lives in cities under domes.
1117340	1122720	The Alpha Love Interest is head of a terrorist organization that has taken over the city
1122720	1128900	with biochemical weapons, and is a massive, chonky big boy.
1128900	1132000	You think you know what prison is, little one.
1132000	1133440	You do not.
1133440	1139260	In prison, one is surrounded by the worst possible breed of men.
1139260	1143600	If I wanted food or water, I had to kill for it.
1143600	1149500	He's a bit of a political zealot, and also he and all of his minions escaped from a prison
1149500	1150500	pit.
1150500	1154940	That term you use for it, the undercroft, I find it amusing.
1154940	1160860	A poetic word used to describe a place of darkness, filled with the pleas of thousands,
1160860	1163420	scraping at the doors to get out.
1163420	1170040	And also, he lives in the prison pit, and he was born in the darkness, molded by it.
1170040	1171040	Okay, it's Bane.
1171040	1172040	It's Bane.
1172040	1173040	It's obviously Bane.
1173040	1174040	We get it.
1174040	1175040	It's Bane.
1175040	1176600	And for crimes, crime is irrelevant.
1176600	1179560	I was never condemned to your undercroft.
1179560	1182080	I was born there.
1182080	1188080	Enter Claire, an Omega posing as a Beta with the help of hormone pills, who comes to Bane,
1188080	1192320	I mean Shepard, to beg him for help for her Omega Posse.
1192320	1194380	Will Bane discover her secret?
1194380	1195380	Yes.
1195380	1196380	Immediately.
1196380	1198700	Crave to Conquer Myth of Omega Book 1.
1198700	1201900	A large and powerful army has conquered a kingdom.
1201900	1208580	Their hormone-laden leader, Khal Drogo, or Drako, has promised his followers Omega mates,
1208580	1212060	even though Omegas have mysteriously disappeared from society.
1212060	1217780	Enter Caelan, an Omega spy posing as a Beta with the help of magic, who pretends to be
1217780	1221580	a researcher in order to get into Drako's library.
1221600	1223560	Will Drako discover her secret?
1223560	1224560	Yes.
1224560	1225560	Immediately.
1225560	1230200	Plot similarities include, but are not limited to, a dearth of Omegas.
1230200	1232240	Alphas take them hostage.
1232240	1237680	Omegas are in hiding and trying to suppress hormones, through pills or magic.
1237680	1238740	But they fail.
1238740	1243260	The Omega is captured by the Alpha when her magic or pills fail in public and she goes
1243260	1245520	into heat, nodding.
1245520	1248160	Dubious consent slash non-consent.
1248380	1251680	Both of the first books end with the heroine escaping their Alpha.
1251680	1253100	The list goes on from there.
1253100	1258180	But does Kane actually have a basis to make the claim that Crave to Conquer was infringing
1258180	1260220	on Born to be Bound's copyright?
1260220	1263700	Well here's a Facebook exchange from August of 2018.
1263700	1269400	So I've read almost all the MF Omegaverse on Amazon, and I read a lot of MM Omegaverse.
1269400	1273580	There are some differences that I've noticed, other than the obvious, but one of them is
1273580	1278140	that the MF pairings tend to be rough and almost brutal sometimes.
1278140	1282420	Even when the Alpha and Omega are in a relationship, or have feelings for each other.
1282420	1285080	The MM stories tend to be a lot sweeter.
1285080	1289720	And there isn't the same kind of violence, for lack of a better word, in their matings.
1289720	1293360	I think the reason the male-female pairings are more violent is because I was the first
1293360	1296740	to write them, and I'm a non-con, dub-con writer.
1296740	1299160	What followed suit was keeping in line with the trend.
1299160	1300160	LOL.
1300160	1301520	Addison corrupts everyone.
1304520	1305520	Stunning.
1305520	1310500	How did you get into writing Omegaverse books, especially MF Omegaverse?
1310500	1314920	I'm not going to lie, yours were the first ones that I found that were not MM.
1314920	1317420	I was the first for male-female.
1317420	1322280	I loved reading Omegaverse fanfiction, but got so frustrated that it never included women.
1322280	1328720	So I made my own meta, Rules of the Universe, for male-female Omegaverse, and wrote my own.
1328720	1333880	So Kane claims that she innovated invading queer spaces and making them all normie and
1333880	1335300	het.
1335300	1338820	And also, she innovated non-con.
1338820	1340020	Sure, Jan.
1340020	1342420	This is also not true.
1342420	1347060	The first mainstream heterosexual Omegaverse novel that was published by a major publisher
1347060	1352620	was called Alpha and Omega by Patricia Briggs beginning in 2008.
1352620	1359180	And the idea that Kane innovated bringing non-con into this fuckery is just...
1359180	1360780	okay.
1360780	1361780	Sure, Jan.
1361780	1364920	This is not the first time that Kane has gone after the competition, either.
1364920	1370060	In March of 2016, she wrote a Facebook post charging that another author, who wrote under
1370060	1375120	the pen name The Dragon's Maiden, had copied at least, again, 15 plot points from Born
1375120	1376300	to Be Bread.
1376300	1380200	Just so you don't believe her hype, I have tried to be lighthearted about this, but it
1380200	1381600	has been a nightmare.
1381600	1386900	I finally posted a response to the plagiarism of BTBB by The Dragon's Maiden in her story
1386900	1388600	to mate an Omega.
1388600	1391960	This was my post, which was taken down within 30 minutes.
1391960	1394240	After the post will be her response.
1394240	1396960	Do I believe she plagiarized my story?
1396960	1397960	Yes.
1397960	1399960	Do I expect everyone to agree with me?
1399960	1400960	No.
1400960	1403160	The DMCA will be the final judge of the matter.
1403160	1406640	I just had to say my piece, and I know you can respect that.
1406640	1411280	Her response was to shut down all comments and write this.
1411280	1415240	This isn't meant to sound snide, so please don't take it that way, but I am not going
1415240	1419540	to stop writing because I know 100% that I am not copying you.
1419540	1421360	But to the main reason I am messaging you.
1421360	1425360	If I keep getting rude and threatening messages from your readers, I will start reporting
1425360	1426360	them.
1426360	1427840	I woke up to several this morning.
1427840	1431440	I sincerely hope you aren't encouraging that kind of behavior, but if I find out you
1431440	1434320	are, I will feel it necessary to report you as well.
1434320	1438280	If you would like to discuss this farther, please feel free to email me at email removed
1438280	1439800	to protect her privacy.
1439800	1443680	Dragon's Maiden denied she had stolen anything, and alleged that
1443680	1448000	Her fans came after me, even though our stories, other than being Omegaverse, were nothing
1448000	1449060	alike.
1449060	1453220	There are some similarities, but I honestly believe that they don't go beyond common
1453220	1455180	Lycan traits or actual wolf behavior.
1455180	1458780	Mm, you know, let's just ignore the part about wolf behavior.
1458780	1462820	Dragon's Maiden quickly caved, deciding it just wasn't worth fighting against Cain
1462820	1465300	and her fans, and pulled her stories.
1465300	1466300	Sorry.
1466300	1469940	Due to the number of comments that are either borderline threatening, you're going to
1469940	1476660	regret, slash be sorry, etc, or outright threatening, a threat to trace my IP and make me stop writing,
1476660	1479340	it was recommended to me that I remove my work.
1479340	1483940	As it stands right now, I have filed a police report due to the harassment.
1483940	1486260	People like this believe their own lies.
1486260	1490500	Her story is being taken down for plagiarism, plain and simple.
1490500	1492860	I have one last point I want to make.
1492860	1498100	I have not ever stirred up my fans against another writer.
1498100	1502700	So Cain had gone after other authors before crying copyright infringement, but not with
1502700	1506580	so much DMCA zealotry as she did with Zoe Ellis.
1506580	1511500	While the DMCA allows for users to upload stuff without opening up platforms for liability,
1511500	1517660	it is a touch, to put it mildly, flawed, and is a system, according to legal experts, that
1517660	1519020	is easily abused.
1519020	1523700	For instance, authors might weaponize the DMCA to take down their rivals, and megalopolies
1523700	1528300	like Amazon aren't going to take the time to make sure the DMCA claims are legit.
1528300	1533180	After all, by nature of the law, the legal liability is on the person making the claim,
1533180	1535540	not the platform hosting the content.
1535540	1539580	If DMCA claims aren't legit, it can take months to undo them.
1539580	1540580	Months of lost income.
1540580	1544200	And there's no real incentive for platforms like Amazon to be quick about checking those
1544200	1545200	things out.
1545200	1549980	In a lot of cases, the only thing you can do is...sue.
1549980	1560080	So Zoe Ellis sues Addison Cain in Oklahoma federal court, where Ellis' American Digital
1560080	1563220	Distributor is based, in October of 2018.
1563220	1567100	The same month, Ellis wrote the following on her website in a post titled,
1567100	1570060	No one owns a genre, least of all Omegaverse.
1570060	1573500	Instead of responding to attempts to resolve this issue amicably, the publisher and author
1573500	1577860	chose to delay communication and persisted with threats of blackmail and attempted intimidation,
1577860	1581580	as well as continued existing attacks against my character and books in collusion with others.
1581580	1585180	I've since learned of other MF Omegaverse readers who were similarly targeted by the
1585180	1588980	same parties, including one who abandoned her story due to threats and takedown attempts.
1588980	1593380	My publisher, after seeking professional guidance, realized legal action was unavoidable.
1593380	1597400	Obviously, as a new author, this was a scary conclusion for me, but the various actions
1597400	1601180	taken by the author and publisher have been astonishingly wide-ranging and consistent,
1601180	1603580	and can ultimately prevent me from having a successful career.
1603580	1607620	I wrote my own interpretation of the Omegaverse, creating my own character's world and stories,
1607620	1610740	and I have the right to publish and promote my work without unprovoked interference and
1610740	1613460	defamation from others, regardless of their popularity.
1613460	1617260	Anyone who reads both works without bias can clearly see they are not the same story, even
1617260	1618940	if they are unfamiliar with the genre.
1618940	1622580	My publisher has now filed a lawsuit to address these unwarranted attacks on my works and
1622580	1623580	reputation."
1623580	1628800	So Ellis sues Kane as an individual, as well as the digital distributor, and the publisher
1628800	1635060	blushing books, and the anonymous posters that went after Ellis, who she seems to assume
1635060	1639260	are sock puppets operated by Addison Kane and or her publisher.
1639260	1643240	In addition to suing her for the wrongful DMCA takedowns, she sues for a whole bunch
1643240	1648840	of other stuff like malicious interference of contract, copyright misuse, misrepresenting
1648840	1654200	claims under the DMCA, and a bunch of other torts, negligence, defamation, the list goes
1654200	1655500	on and on.
1655500	1661000	The lawsuit effectively begins with outlining what Omegaverse is in a context of genre.
1661000	1667100	Omegaverse, or Alpha Beta Omega, ABO, or Alpha Beta Omega Dynamics as its slightly broader
1667100	1671480	category is called, is a collection of related tropes that tend to correlate in many stories.
1671480	1676040	ABO defines stories in which humans are not only categorized by gender, but also by a
1676040	1677320	second dynamic.
1677320	1681600	To be recognized as an Omegaverse, at least some of a vast number of potential characteristics
1681600	1683000	need to be present.
1683000	1687040	These include imprinting, the mythology within Omega, scenting, pheromones are excessive,
1687040	1694120	Omega heat cycles, and Alpha rut, mate bonding, a permanent bond between the partners, nodding,
1694120	1699760	a physiological condition experienced by the Alpha during mating to aid in pregnancy, male
1699760	1701400	and female.
1701400	1709800	A lawyer actually wrote this and, uh, multiple federal judges had to read it.
1709800	1713640	The lawsuit also puts front and center the fact that authors abusing copyright law in
1713640	1716520	the romance genre is also nothing new.
1716520	1721000	The literary world, especially within the romance genre and its sub-genres, has experienced
1721000	1726640	anti-competitive behavior by certain bad actors attempting to monopolize the industry through
1726640	1732560	misuse of trademark and copyright law, ranging from misuse of takedown notices to litigation
1732560	1735320	over the use of a common word in a book title.
1735320	1738900	Unlawful practices are becoming more and more prevalent.
1738900	1742240	So let's take a moment to discuss Cockygate.
1742240	1746840	After the novel Cocky Bastard by Penelope Ward and by Keeland, published by Ever After
1746840	1753160	Romance, became a big hit in 2015, the genre became flooded with titles involving the word
1753160	1754600	cocky.
1754600	1759520	Fine author Felina Hopkins took this a step further to make sure that her novels, Cocker
1759520	1764960	Brothers, the cocky series, would stay above the dick-hun laden swill by submitting two
1764960	1768120	trademark claims to the US Patent and Trademark Office.
1768120	1774040	One, trademarking the usage of the word cocky in certain fonts, and two, officially having
1774040	1778120	full stop control of the word in all romance novel titles.
1778120	1779680	Naturally, people disputed this.
1779680	1784600	It became a huge controversy and a legal battle is still ongoing, but Hopkins did end up releasing
1784600	1789240	her claims, which means you can expect the sequel to Axiom's end, the cocky bugman
1789240	1792840	from Planet Cock Gobble, to hit shelves in Fall of 2021.
1792840	1797560	I don't know if you can tell, but I did not write that line.
1797560	1800960	So Kane hits back in a blog post on her personal website.
1800960	1803760	My fight is also yours.
1803760	1807700	We cannot allow one bad player to change the rules of the game.
1807700	1813480	We must stand as a community and refute the idea that one author can bully and manipulate
1813480	1817340	another author over DMCA sent by their publisher.
1817340	1821920	It sets a dangerous precedent for the next author, who is just trying to protect their
1821920	1824640	work and their livelihoods.
1824640	1830880	Just think about all those DMCA authors are sending to stop Travis McRae's pirate website.
1830880	1835680	Can you imagine if he chose to drag you into court over just one of them?
1835680	1838160	Unfortunately, I can.
1838160	1841280	I will no longer keep silent.
1841280	1846160	It is now time to hashtag get loud.
1846160	1851680	Kane also started a GoFundMe for her legal fees, which starts with the bolded header.
1851680	1858040	Authors should not be sued or harassed for their publisher rightfully filing DMCA's.
1858040	1859760	Rightfully?
1859760	1861520	Interesting.
1861520	1865880	This lawsuit is a 512f case, which is actually very rare.
1865880	1869840	Notice and takedown is the section 512 of the DMCA.
1869840	1874200	512f is what allows people to sue other people for bogus takedowns.
1874200	1879800	But it's very rare because, well, it's expensive to sue, and victims of DMCA abuse
1879800	1883640	usually get mired in the internal bullshit of the platforms they're using before it
1883640	1885400	gets to the lawsuit point.
1885400	1891240	Part of the DMCA is you are supposed to consider fair use before you issue a DMCA takedown.
1891240	1895840	Moreover, someone who is a victim of a false DMCA takedown probably isn't going to be
1895840	1899640	under the umbrella of a major corporation with a lot of assets.
1899640	1904440	They are probably going to be a smaller creator, or in this case, a small press without a lot
1904440	1905440	of resources.
1905440	1912040	One of the last high profile 512f cases was YouTube suing someone for sending false DMCA
1912040	1916760	takedowns, because YouTube has the resources to actually go to court and could afford it,
1916760	1920000	and even in that case, they ended up settling out of court.
1920000	1923880	So as they were building their case, Ellis' lawyers thought they had a strong position,
1923880	1928800	but according to that New York Times article, they struggled to find a prior case that addressed
1928800	1932360	whether fanfiction tropes could be protected by copyright.
1932360	1936680	Said Gideon Ling Kecum, a lawyer who represents Quill Inc. and Zoe Ellis,
1936680	1941920	We were looking at cases to see if the courts had ever dealt with anything like this before.
1941920	1947720	Dealing with the emergence of this new literary genre, we found there weren't any.
1947720	1951640	But then we get to the deposition, which, like so many elements of this case, seems
1951640	1955880	weirdly fixated on the originated in fanfic element.
1955880	1959240	Your book published by Blushing, okay, the first of the books that we're talking about
1959240	1960240	here, is that fanfiction?
1960240	1962320	It is not fanfiction.
1962320	1963860	And why is it not fanfiction?
1963860	1967600	To be a fanfiction, it has to exist in a universe that you don't own.
1967600	1971520	When I wrote the story, I hardly used anything from that universe at the time, I just used
1971520	1973600	like a couple little things here.
1973600	1977340	When I rewrote the story, all of that was taken out, characters were modified, scenes
1977340	1980980	were rewritten, so it is definitely not fanfiction.
1980980	1982940	So let me see if this is a different question.
1982940	1984760	Is that book in the Omegaverse?
1984760	1986680	That book is an Omegaverse book.
1986680	1990060	Are there aspects of the Omegaverse that are manifested in that book that constitute a
1990060	1992260	reality or universe that you contend you own?
1992260	1994520	I don't own Omegaverse.
1994520	1997820	Is there any part of the first book which creates a reality that you contend you do
1997820	1998820	own?
1998820	2001020	I do not own Omegaverse.
2001020	2003580	I understand, that's not what I'm asking.
2003580	2004580	Okay.
2004820	2009020	I understood it, and again, I told you there are places where I'm just not going to understand,
2009020	2013060	because I don't know that much about fanfiction, and I don't know that much about the Omegaverse.
2013060	2017620	As I understand it, it's not fanfiction, because it's not in a universe that you don't own.
2017620	2021220	Look, I'll just try this one more time and then I'll drop it, and I'll preface that question
2021220	2022220	with this.
2022220	2025780	I'm having a problem with what I perceive as a logical inconsistency.
2025780	2026780	Okay.
2026780	2027780	Okay.
2027780	2029460	Your books are in the Omegaverse.
2029460	2030460	Yes.
2030460	2031460	We agree on that.
2031460	2032460	Nobody owns the Omegaverse.
2032460	2033460	Exactly.
2033540	2036500	Fanfiction is books that are set in a universe you don't own.
2036500	2037500	Yes.
2037500	2040500	But despite the fact that your books are set in a universe that nobody owns, they're not
2040500	2041500	fanfiction?
2041500	2042500	Exactly.
2042500	2043500	Number on the top.
2043500	2044500	What is the number on the top?
2044500	2045500	There are no numbers on the top.
2045500	2046500	There's letters.
2046500	2047500	Oh!
2047500	2051440	Okay, Mr. Lawyer Man, let me help you out.
2051440	2057740	The confusion here seems to be semantic, and is probably based in the use of the verse
2057740	2058740	part of the word.
2058740	2064500	I would agree that something set in the Omegaverse is not fanfiction because Omegaverse is the
2064500	2066140	name of a subgenre.
2066140	2070800	The word Omegaverse isn't used in the same way we use phrases like the Marvel Cinematic
2070800	2075580	Universe, which if you set a story in that, would be considered fanfiction.
2075580	2078340	So I can see where it could be confusing.
2078340	2083580	However, that question is completely immaterial to this case and the DMCA.
2083580	2088860	Whether or not Born to be Bound was or is fanfic has fuck all to do with whether or
2088860	2090860	not there was plagiarism.
2090860	2095580	The fact that Omegaverse originates in fanfic is completely immaterial to the legality of
2095580	2096860	this case.
2096860	2100920	And I don't understand why these lawyers, or the New York Times for that matter, even
2100920	2104180	mention that they couldn't find a fanfic-related precedent.
2104180	2109000	I'm sure one day the legality of fanfic is going to get litigated and it's going to suck.
2109000	2110580	But what does it have to do with this?
2110580	2116280	A case of DMCA takedowns being abused by an author trying to snuff out the competition.
2116280	2120100	Kane claims that Ellis' book hit a lot of the same plot points as hers did.
2120100	2121280	Which is true.
2121280	2126620	But in copyright law, there is a doctrine called sans affair that is, you cannot copyright
2126620	2130560	tropes that consumers expect of a genre.
2130560	2133260	Take YA Paranormal Romance for example.
2133260	2138620	You can't copyright the concept of like, a cute but haunted high school boy who is
2138620	2143720	also secretly a monster of some sort, who becomes obsessed with the clumsy unremarkable
2143720	2144720	female protagonist.
2144720	2150520	It's like diamonds.
2150520	2155480	Pick any two YA Paranormal Romance novels from the early 2010s, and each one is easily
2155480	2159960	going to share 15 plot points with any other, which if you line them up next to each other
2159960	2165500	with no context, could look pretty damning, when in reality, that's just part and parcel
2165500	2166500	of the genre.
2166880	2171480	In other words, Crave to Conquer is about as similar to Born to be Bound as any of the
2171480	2174840	shit million Twilight knockoffs were to Twilight.
2174840	2178500	Born to be Bound and Crave to Conquer, aside from using Omegaverse tropes, aren't even
2178500	2179880	in the same genre.
2179880	2182760	One is future dystopia, the other is fantasy.
2182760	2187140	So while there's no case law directly about genres that have emerged from the internet,
2187140	2188600	that doesn't really matter.
2188600	2194520	Copyright, fair use, and sans affair included, are elastic on purpose to fit changing circumstances.
2194540	2199580	And it must needs be remarked that it is extremely ironic that we have a fanfiction author who
2199580	2204220	published her erotic fiction which was just Batman fanfic with the serial numbers filed
2204220	2210460	off, filing DMCA claims against an author who just appears to be using Omegaverse tropes
2210460	2216660	rather than just repurposing her old fanfiction- I'm sorry, her PUBLISHER filed DMCA claims
2216660	2220500	against an author who appears to just be using Omegaverse tropes in original fiction.
2220500	2224340	Addison Cain had nothing to do with those DMCA claims.
2224340	2226560	See, that's foreshadowing.
2226560	2230400	So the issue here is that a lot of the tropes that Cain is claiming Ellis infringed upon
2230400	2235640	aren't just common to the by now well-worn Omegaverse, they're also kind of common to
2235640	2237920	books.
2237920	2243840	Omegaverse, and indeed fanfiction as a concept, did not innovate most of these tropes.
2243840	2250600	The I don't like you slash enemies to lover trope is a feature of most romance novels.
2250600	2254980	You know, Beast, Beauty, Something Something, Tale as Old as Time.
2254980	2261220	Like, even the OG Pride and Prejudice does the I don't like you to lovers thing.
2261220	2266460	Alpha male dub-conning a woman who eventually falls in love with him is also a romance novel
2266460	2267460	staple.
2267460	2273420	From the chic in 1919 to bodice-ribbers in the 1970s and 80s to what we see now, sexual
2273420	2277380	violence turning into true love is nothing new.
2277380	2281920	The whole Alpha Omega thing is just a roided up version of what you get in bodice-ribbers,
2281920	2286200	just with, you know, more fluids and, well.
2286200	2290920	For fuck's sake, well before Omegaverse was even a thing, the common parlance term
2290920	2296480	for a domineering male hero in the mainstream romance novel genre was, and continues to
2296480	2298240	be, an Alpha.
2298240	2303480	And while the dub-con and non-con elements have fallen out of favor in most mainstream
2303480	2308380	romance novel presses, it's still a big thing in self-published works and small presses
2308380	2309540	like these.
2309540	2316180	So to be clear, Addison Cain's publisher is completely in the wrong here.
2316180	2319420	Those DMCA claims were illegal and illegitimate.
2319420	2322460	Cain's PUBLISHER is wrong.
2322460	2326860	Even if Ellis totally stole those ideas from Born to be Bound, the ideas she stole were
2326860	2332620	too much part and parcel of the subgenre of Omegaverse to possibly constitute copyright
2332620	2336100	infringement.
2336100	2341360	So the only way Oklahoma could have jurisdiction is if Addison Cain personally did stuff to
2341360	2346480	people in the state of Oklahoma, in this case, Zoe Ellis's digital distributor, which is
2346480	2347740	based in Oklahoma.
2347740	2350920	So Cain moves to dismiss herself from the Oklahoma case.
2350920	2353800	She is, after all, a Virginia resident.
2353800	2358560	And Cain is like, no, I didn't do it, the publisher did it.
2358560	2362780	I had nothing to do with those DMCA claims.
2362780	2365500	I've never even been to Oklahoma.
2365500	2368060	No, it wasn't me.
2368060	2369540	It was the one-armed man.
2369540	2374240	So Cain submits an affidavit in an official court document claiming that she had no contacts
2374240	2379220	with Oklahoma and she had nothing to do with those takedown notices.
2379220	2381360	That was all Blushing Books.
2381360	2382640	She didn't know about it.
2382640	2384420	She didn't have anything to do about it.
2384420	2385780	Yeah, cross my hair.
2385780	2390840	In any event, Blushing Books' DMCA notice without Moore is insufficient to satisfy the
2390840	2396320	requirements of jurisdictional due process over an out-of-state individual.
2396320	2402580	Moreover, even if the DMCA notice was sent to Draft2Digital in Oklahoma, that communication
2402580	2409880	would not be attributable to Mrs. did not purposefully direct any activities at Oklahoma,
2409880	2415540	including drafting or sending the DMCA takedown notice to Draft2Digital or other third parties.
2415540	2421760	Blushing Books sent the DMCA takedown notice to all of the third-party publishers and retailers,
2421760	2422760	including Draft2Digital.
2422760	2428200	Thus, even if the court finds that it can exercise personal jurisdiction over Blushing
2428200	2433880	Books, which Ms. argues that it cannot, it should dismiss all of plaintiff's claims
2433880	2439860	against Mrs. because she did not personally direct any acts or activities into the state
2439860	2440860	of Oklahoma.
2440860	2447160	I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct, executed on
2447160	2449480	November 26th, 2018.
2449480	2453000	So the motion against Cain in Oklahoma is dismissed.
2453000	2457080	But the case against the publisher, Blushing Books, continues in Oklahoma.
2457080	2461800	Oh, and also there is a second lawsuit in Virginia where Cain lives.
2461800	2462800	We'll get to that.
2462800	2467120	But in the meantime, the charges against Cain are dropped, and it's time for Discovery
2467120	2469440	in the Oklahoma case.
2469440	2482620	Discovery is a pretrial procedure in a lawsuit in which each party can obtain evidence from
2482620	2489220	the other party by means of discovery devices such as interrogatories, requests for documents,
2489220	2491440	requests for admissions, and so on.
2491440	2496140	So Quill Inc.'s lawyers demand to see all the correspondence between Cain and her publisher
2496140	2501100	during this time and… oh boy.
2501100	2506860	DMCAs have been sent to Amazon, iBooks, Barnes and Nobles, Kobo, and Google Play.
2506860	2510460	When the books come down and the inevitable backlash begins, this is what I intend to
2510460	2511980	post on Facebook about it.
2511980	2514300	If you have any feedback on this, please let me know.
2514300	2515640	Smiley face.
2515640	2520580	My publishing house has chosen to take legal action against another author for plagiarism
2520580	2521580	and…
2521580	2525300	Your Facebook post is extremely strong and I 100% support you making it.
2525300	2530000	I think your decision to hide behind blushing and paint us as the instigator is absolutely
2530000	2531000	how it should be.
2531000	2532420	Let us take the heat.
2532420	2535620	All you have to say is, my publisher chose to take action.
2535620	2538100	It was and continues to be out of my hands.
2538100	2539100	Let people get mad at us.
2539100	2540100	Hi Anne.
2540100	2541100	Okay, here are my thoughts.
2541100	2542500	It's important to take a stand.
2542500	2545340	After all, blushing books wouldn't just be doing this for me, you're doing it for
2545340	2547180	blushing's best interests too.
2547180	2549660	Zoe Ellis is stealing from both of us.
2549660	2553240	I would not write the author a warning letter, she is aware of what she did and has already
2553240	2555680	stirred up shit and lied by omission.
2555680	2560080	File the DMCA's immediately to Amazon, iTunes, and Barnes and Noble, should only take five
2560080	2561080	minutes each.
2561080	2565240	If you want to write her afterward with demands to see her financials, by all means, go for
2565240	2566240	it.
2566240	2570480	If Amazon, iTunes, and Barnes and Noble comply with the DMCA, which they should considering
2570480	2573400	the evidence, and a stanker rises, I am prepared for the backlash.
2573400	2575920	I went through it with Reborn and I'm not afraid.
2575920	2580600	To settle it down, I will deflect to blushing and remain distant and naive.
2580600	2582240	Readers sent in complaints.
2582240	2586840	The publisher filed a DMCA based on evidence they uncovered of copyright infringement.
2586840	2588880	Any issues should be raised with them.
2588880	2592800	This is out of my hands and I will remain silent publicly unless it gets to a point
2592800	2597280	that a single, professional post on the topic, once again deflecting to the publisher, needs
2597280	2598520	to be posted.
2598520	2601980	Some people will be reactive right out of the gate, but that's why I have a publisher
2601980	2602980	to hide behind.
2602980	2604360	It will pass quickly.
2604360	2606800	So long as they stay above the fray, we're all good.
2606800	2610080	I'm very good at not engaging with crazy.
2610080	2619460	So, if it's not obvious, this is perjury.
2619460	2624400	She was the one who demanded the DMCA takedowns and her publisher colluded with her to make
2624400	2630840	it seem like she was this innocent dumbass who had no idea how the system works.
2630840	2632640	My publisher did everything.
2632640	2636760	I didn't have anything to do with it.
2636760	2638920	I agree with the others you've spoken to.
2638960	2642760	I don't think you will suffer any negative consequences by moving forward.
2642760	2647520	Amazon might not take the other author's book down, but I don't see you or Blushing
2647520	2649160	being penalized in any way.
2649160	2653640	There's no way she could file anything against your book since yours came out two years earlier.
2653640	2654640	Woof.
2654640	2658200	I mean, howl.
2658200	2664080	But here is a particularly prescient observation sent by Blushing Books to Kane right before
2664080	2667160	they start raining DMCA fire down.
2667200	2671600	However, before we move ahead, I'd like you to really think about whether you'd
2671600	2672600	want to do this.
2672600	2673600	I agree.
2673600	2674600	It's sickening.
2674600	2676920	She clearly plagiarized your entire plot.
2676920	2680320	But that having been said, is this really hurting you?
2680320	2685680	If anything, fans of her books reading the reviews of her books might buy yours.
2685680	2687760	Controversy frequently helps books.
2687760	2691640	I don't think there's a point at which anyone would ever be on Amazon and be trying
2691640	2695480	to decide between her book and yours and choose hers.
2695480	2698400	They might read both, but one or the other?
2698400	2699440	Probably not.
2699440	2703720	If we move ahead with this, you'll have a profound enemy for life.
2703720	2707280	Someone who will likely attack you at every opportunity and get all of her friends to
2707280	2708280	do so.
2708280	2712320	She'll come up with another pen name and be your worst nightmare.
2712320	2717880	I'm not trying to tell you to not do it, but I do want you to go in with the clear-eyed
2717880	2722620	understanding that, as hard as it might be to swallow, doing nothing is an option that
2722620	2724520	should be on the table.
2724560	2729760	However, if you want to go ahead with it, blushing supports you 100%.
2729760	2732560	Now that I've thought it over, both books should be taken down.
2732560	2736680	She shouldn't profit off screwing me over.
2736680	2738760	What can I say but yikes.
2738760	2740760	And it did not end here.
2740760	2746000	They went back and forth for months trying to keep Ellis' books from making any money,
2746000	2751600	even after Ellis had successfully fought the claims that originally took her books down.
2751600	2753880	Her books are back up on iBooks.
2753880	2758900	They are also on Kobo and Google Play, and I'm super mad, not at you, at this fucked
2758900	2759900	up situation.
2759900	2763520	Can we please send out DMCA takedown notices to these people?
2763520	2765720	Also what are we going to do about Amazon?
2765720	2766720	Help!
2766720	2770760	She's lost her Apple account, though her other titles are still on Barnes and Nobles
2770760	2771760	and Kobo.
2771760	2776320	I don't know what mechanism we can use to shut her down completely as an author, unless
2776320	2781520	you want to try to trademark Omegaverse, which we might be able to get.
2781520	2785320	I think our best strategy right now is to push Amazon hard.
2785320	2789440	If she loses her account completely, it will in effect shut her down.
2789440	2792740	If you have a different, better plan or strategy, please share it.
2792740	2794200	Book 3 needs to come down too.
2794200	2798280	I don't want her to make any more money off this series.
2798280	2803480	So um, this is what the kids call a bad look.
2803480	2808880	So the plaintiffs file a motion that Kane perjured herself, she should be a judge guilty
2808880	2814320	of civil contempt, and three days later the defendants offer a complete settlement, admit
2814320	2819520	that Ellis did not infringe on anyone's copyright, they revoke the DMCA takedowns,
2819520	2821880	and the case is closed.
2821880	2823880	In Oklahoma, anyway.
2823880	2826400	Justice is served?
2826400	2829360	Well hold on there, Pard, this is just the Oklahoma case.
2829360	2832200	Remember, there is still a case going on in Virginia.
2832200	2838080	So the Virginia case keeps going, and here is where it gets even weirder.
2838080	2843400	So the Virginia case is specifically against Kane, not the publisher, because Kane is based
2843400	2844600	in Virginia.
2844600	2849080	And while Ellis's claim did involve all the original stuff about like, you know, wrongful
2849080	2855360	DMCA takedowns, it also has all of this other stuff that is just like way harder to prove
2855360	2860980	in a court of law, and they probably overshot their load with too many claims.
2860980	2863320	So most of it gets thrown out.
2863320	2865280	But you know, whatever, they've got her where they want her.
2865280	2870040	If the judge or a jury finds Ms. Kane in the wrong, the case would send a message to
2870040	2875200	overzealous genre writers that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act is not to be abused.
2875200	2878320	But then it just kind of fizzles out.
2878320	2884280	Usually in cases like this it's the defendant that becomes insolvent, but here Quillink
2884280	2890400	dissolved and had to drop the case because apparently they just ran out of money.
2890400	2894760	And when Quillink lost their counsel, they couldn't hire a new counsel because there's
2894760	2900060	this like obscure UK law that says you can't do that.
2900060	2906760	So in order to continue the case, they'd basically have to create a new legal entity in the US
2906760	2908040	and start over.
2908040	2914360	And on top of all that, the only part of that case that's still ongoing is Kane's countersuit
2914360	2915440	in Virginia.
2915440	2921160	And because this is endless petty fandom bullshit, the counterclaim is for like defamation of
2921160	2927600	character and emotional damages and more of that shit, accusing also Zoe Ellis of using
2927600	2931820	sock puppets to like, you know, leave bad reviews.
2931820	2935000	And what's going on right now is Ellis just seems to have disappeared and is just kind
2935000	2941040	of ignoring Kane's counterclaim, which is shitty and kind of suspicious in and of itself.
2941040	2947020	But like at this point, we're way out of the weeds of like DMCA abuse and into just petty
2947020	2948760	fandom drama.
2948760	2951380	So I guess we've come full circle.
2961920	2968320	So one of the benefits of it taking us roughly like four years on average to edit one of
2968320	2975240	these episodes is that while we were editing it, the case finally got resolved.
2975240	2978520	And you'll never guess how it ended.
2978520	2984000	Was there some consequence to Addison Kane and her oops all perjury?
2984000	2988980	The US federal court in the Eastern District of Virginia has dismissed all of the claims
2988980	2991800	against me with prejudice.
2991800	2996440	This is an important victory, not just for myself and my family, but for all authors
2996440	3001400	who have ever or may ever find themselves in a situation where they must defend their
3001400	3002400	copyright.
3002800	3003800	Of course not.
3003800	3006580	The entire case was dismissed with prejudice.
3006580	3012880	And Kane really wants you to know that in a post she titled a win for the author community.
3012880	3018380	So the lesson learned here seems to be doubling down.
3018380	3020260	I didn't do anything wrong.
3020260	3024800	The DMCA takedowns were valid and I'm the real victim here.
3024800	3035080	For those new to legal jargon, it is a serious matter for a judge to dismiss counts of a
3035080	3037320	lawsuit with prejudice.
3037320	3041260	And it is only done in the most egregious of circumstances.
3041260	3046520	So I spent like my entire Saturday digging through every single court document in this
3046520	3048080	stupid case.
3048080	3053540	And I couldn't find any that were actually submitted by the court that used with prejudice
3053540	3058600	in their verbiage anywhere except for the defendant's motion to dismiss the case where
3058600	3062060	they request that the court dismiss it with prejudice.
3062060	3067280	And the motion was granted, but the word prejudice with or without doesn't come up at all.
3067280	3073860	And that's because with prejudice is kind of implied when a case is dismissed for failure
3073860	3076260	to prosecute as was the case here.
3076260	3080100	They fizzled out and missed a bunch of deadlines and they pissed the judge off and the judge
3080100	3081500	was like, okay, screw it.
3081500	3084220	You clearly aren't taking this seriously.
3084220	3090020	That is why the case was dismissed, not because the DMCA takedowns are valid.
3090020	3095700	And she's definitely wrong about with prejudice only being done in the most egregious of circumstances
3095700	3098440	because with prejudice is pretty much the default.
3098440	3102520	If your claims get dismissed, it's usually with prejudice.
3102520	3106260	And in this case, the judge probably doesn't bother even stating with prejudice in the
3106260	3111660	court documents because it's not the all-caps big deal she seems to think it is.
3111660	3114660	Think how they scrum and they see how I do it.
3114660	3116520	Dismissed with prejudice.
3116520	3120180	If anything, it's more unusual for cases to be dismissed without prejudice.
3120180	3125140	I mean, it's not uncommon, but with prejudice is more common.
3125140	3128820	Basically, the case was dismissed because it was clear that the plaintiff could not
3128820	3133100	move forward, not because the case itself was without merit.
3133100	3138060	And don't get me wrong, some of it was, but the stuff surrounding copyright and DMCA,
3138060	3142760	especially since Cain perjured herself in the Oklahoma case, they had a pretty good
3142760	3143760	case there.
3143760	3148300	And Cain is right about some things, namely how suspicious and weird it is that Zoe Ellis
3148300	3153240	created the case in Virginia and then just kind of fizzled it out and liquidated her
3153240	3156980	own company, meaning Cain can't pursue her counterclaim.
3156980	3161380	Like, yeah, that is a little sus, but again, that has nothing to do with the validity of
3161380	3166060	the DMCA takedowns or any damages Ellis might have incurred because of them.
3166060	3169860	She goes on to state that the settlement between Blushing and Quilt Link that happened in the
3169860	3175100	Oklahoma case after she was dismissed from it is legally meaningless.
3175100	3180820	Instead, Blushing made a single statement to avoid further litigation claiming no plagiarism
3180820	3184440	had occurred and that their DMCA's were invalid.
3184440	3186980	That statement legally means nothing.
3186980	3189740	Wait, wait, no.
3190460	3193180	Yes, actually, it means a lot.
3193180	3197220	It means they broke the law and are admitting that they broke the law.
3197220	3200260	The funny thing here is that she undermines her own point.
3200260	3206180	Like plagiarism is not a legal term, therefore plagiarism is not technically illegal in the
3206180	3212620	way that like stabbing is not a legal term, therefore stabbing is not technically illegal,
3212620	3217060	but assault with a deadly weapon is ipso facto.
3217060	3221100	If there was no plagiarism, then there was no copyright infringement.
3221100	3222780	The thing that is illegal.
3222780	3227940	By definition, a settlement means an agreement to resolve the legal dispute by both parties
3227940	3229480	prior to trial.
3229480	3231780	No judge ruled on the case.
3231780	3237060	And by definition, like she keeps saying this too, by definition, like you sound like Ben
3237060	3238060	Shapiro.
3238060	3241380	Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet ass fjord.
3241380	3245020	Well, by definition, copyright is the right to make copies.
3245020	3247020	Okay, now that is a fact.
3247020	3248420	It is right there in the word.
3248420	3249780	Copyright is the right to make copies.
3249780	3252260	It is easier to prove than plagiarism.
3252260	3255540	But if there was no plagiarism, it's right there in the word, then there was no copyright
3255540	3258260	infringement because copies were not made.
3258260	3260660	Is Ben Shapiro going to sue me now?
3260660	3265460	But she is wrong in that the settlement in the Oklahoma case is legally meaningless.
3265460	3269400	Most settlements are confidential, so we never know what the terms are.
3269400	3274720	So blushing admitting in a court document that the DMCA's were invalid actually does
3274720	3280400	give it some precedential effect over any future cases that might argue over these same
3280400	3281400	details.
3281400	3285560	So if only in a minor way, maybe blushing admitting that they were in the wrong to the
3285560	3288000	court is actually kind of a good thing.
3288000	3294800	Not a big win, but one minor precedent to defend against DMCA abuse.
3294800	3295800	Go team.
3295800	3300920	But the most batshit, unhinged from reality claim that she makes in this whole thing is
3300920	3306520	in response to the question of why did you send DMCA takedowns for the third Myth of
3306520	3311660	Omega book, which at that time had not even come out yet, and therefore you could not
3311660	3313100	have read.
3313100	3317120	Because both my Alpha's Claim trilogy and Zoe Ellis's trilogy were meant to be read
3317120	3322700	as a whole, books one and two ending in a cliffhanger, therefore I believed that the
3322700	3326760	unpublished book was a derivative work.
3326760	3329120	I own trilogies now?
3329120	3333480	She then goes on to cast every other person involved but herself as the villain.
3333480	3339160	She's super mad about that New York Times article, and they were way nicer to her than
3339160	3345680	I was, and certainly nicer than the A-Lab podcast, which I definitely listened to and
3345680	3353200	found very helpful in establishing the timeline for this wacky, crazy shenanigans.
3353200	3358160	I'm not going to repeat some of the things they said, but the New York Times was way
3358160	3361920	nicer than they were, and certainly nicer than I was.
3361920	3367680	Interestingly, the same month the article ran, the NYT parted ways with at least one
3367680	3372900	editor who admitted an article was rushed into publication, that the editing process
3372900	3378980	was flawed, and shockingly, then admitted to not even reading the op-ed before it ran
3378980	3380120	online.
3380120	3385640	So she connects the integrity of the editor of Alexandra Alter, who wrote the original
3385640	3393960	New York Times article, to the op-ed editor who resigned after asking Tom Cotton to write
3393960	3397360	a pro-police brutality op-ed.
3397360	3402640	Like these two are even in the same department, implying that these two editors, who happen
3402640	3407960	to work for the same paper at the same time, are the same person.
3407960	3412200	Like this is the level of intellectual honesty we are dealing with here.
3412200	3418480	In fact, Zoe Ellis sat down with a journalist for the NYT, who rushed the story, failed
3418480	3425920	to cite sources, failed to remain unbiased, and misquoted both myself and the facts.
3425920	3430080	Oh my god, the article is the citation!
3430080	3436520	Like this isn't a blog, this isn't like a peer-reviewed journal entry, Addison.
3436520	3439240	Newspaper articles don't have footnotes.
3439240	3444600	Blushing Books, who totally threw themselves in front of the bus for Addison a year earlier,
3444600	3446680	is also the bad guy now.
3446680	3451640	During this experience, I learned that my former publisher, Blushing Books, had never
3451640	3457780	filed copyrights for any of my books, despite what I believe was a contractual responsibility
3457780	3458780	to do so.
3458780	3459780	What?
3459780	3461280	What do you mean you believe?
3461280	3464540	Like, read your freaking contract!
3464540	3469860	You can check if they violated their contractual obligation.
3469860	3471620	You can sue them.
3471620	3477980	And if they didn't ever say they were going to file your copyright for you, then you didn't
3477980	3478980	read your contract.
3478980	3482220	But that doesn't mean that Blushing is necessarily innocent here either.
3482220	3486680	The blog post reveals that Cain and Blushing had a big falling out during the Oklahoma
3486680	3490740	case in which she got the rights to distribute her book back.
3490740	3496780	And she very peddly shows an email between Blushing and another author showing that Blushing
3496780	3501940	basically had no clue what they were doing and understood nothing about copyright law
3501940	3504660	and what actually constitutes copyright infringement.
3504660	3509020	How many assholes we got on this ship anyhow?
3509020	3510020	Go!
3510020	3514900	Cain then goes after the Romance Writers of America and is very upset about the RWA protecting
3514900	3515900	Blushing.
3515900	3519580	Like, what are you talking about?
3519580	3525860	Blushing has been on notice as a, like, bad publisher by the RWA since 2019.
3525860	3529380	And here she is trying and failing to start shit with another, much more famous romance
3529380	3535140	novelist who had earlier opined on the case and incidentally is a lawyer herself.
3535140	3538620	Everyone is enemy mine and I am the wronged one.
3538620	3542060	Like, maybe you're the problem Taylor Swift.
3542060	3543060	Oof.
3543060	3545060	Internet was a mistake.
3546060	3551780	So she's trying really hard to frame this as an I was right all along and this is a
3551780	3555820	win for authors and I'm helping you actually.
3555820	3561740	When in reality, after the details of her involvement and malice and subsequent perjury
3561740	3568020	were revealed to the court in the Oklahoma case, her publisher settled because their
3568020	3573020	author perjured herself and Cain got to walk away with effectively no consequences from
3573020	3579620	that while the other lawsuit against her in another state fizzled and died for completely
3579620	3583140	unrelated reasons.
3583140	3586420	And that is how it ends.
3586420	3587420	That was pointless.
3587420	3594620	I don't know if you could see what I was doing there.
3594620	3596620	It was like a visual joke.
3596620	3602220	Alpha, beta, omega.
3602220	3606260	Do you think a depressed person could make this?
3606260	3607420	No.
3607420	3612820	So if you were reading this as an invitation to go harass this woman, first of all, what
3612820	3616100	the hell is wrong with you and also why are you even watching my channel?
3616100	3617500	Second, don't.
3617500	3620620	But this is less a cautionary tale of one vindictive author.
3620620	3624660	The New York Times article claims that it raises a deep legal question, but it isn't
3624660	3627700	really a deep legal question about who owns ideas.
3627700	3633860	If there is a deep legal question, it is how can people without the resources of giants
3633860	3638020	like YouTube protect themselves from bad faith DMCA claims?
3638020	3644500	DMCA counterclaims do exist as a barrier and Zoe Ellis did use them, but clearly that wasn't
3644500	3649340	enough because Cain and Blushing steamrolled right through them and kept issuing takedowns
3649340	3650340	for months.
3650340	3655420	A lot of the focus on this case was on the weird fanfic subculture and not the fact that
3655420	3659820	cases like this can and often do set important legal precedents.
3659820	3664420	To me, this is less about a too horny on main train wreck as much as it is a good example
3664420	3671380	of how laws designed to protect giant corporations are written in presumed good faith and assume
3671380	3674220	that everyone is going to play by the rules.
3674220	3677940	I tried to protect authors.
3678340	3686300	Well, as a fellow USA Today best-selling author who writes extremely niche trash involving
3686300	3692940	questionable use of non-human anatomies, I cannot say I feel protected by this.
3692940	3697460	If she had won this thing, which she didn't, that would have meant, despite her claims
3697460	3702740	to the contrary, that you can actually own genre tropes, which would make creating that
3702740	3707660	much more difficult and give bad faith actors that much more arsenal to attack their fellow
3707660	3708660	artists.
3708660	3713100	And in cases like these, we do kind of need to say something when bad faith actors try
3713100	3718340	to use this sort of thing to their advantage and might inadvertently strengthen already
3718340	3723980	draconian copyright law pushed by the likes of the Walt Disney Company and all for your
3723980	3726180	petty vindictive bullshit.
3726180	3729380	So this this attitude is bad.
3729380	3730380	Don't do it.
3730380	3731380	You can't own tropes.
3731380	3735380	I've learned you can do anything you want as long as you put your mind to it.
3735380	3738340	But I've also learned that reading is bad.
3738340	3740720	So we did have a lot of help writing this.
3740720	3746900	I learned a lot about reading court documents and me and Angelina had to read a lot of torture
3746900	3747900	porn.
3747900	3750680	I mean that in the most literal sense.
3750680	3752540	Porn with torture.
3752540	3753720	Literal torture porn.
3753720	3756340	It's like snuff for her.
3756340	3761300	Thanks especially to Stacy Lantane of the University of Mississippi School of Law and
3761300	3765140	Catherine Trindacosta with the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
3765140	3770740	The EFF is the leading nonprofit defending digital privacy and free speech and a portion
3770740	3774660	of the profits of this video are going to be donated to the EFF.
3774660	3779100	Take care, you beautiful people, and remember to wear a mask in public.
3779100	3786020	And if this video mysteriously disappears for, I don't know, some reason, I guess we'll
3786020	3787020	see you in court.
3795140	3796140	Bye.
3796140	3797140	Bye.
3797140	3797140	
3855140	3856140	Bye.
