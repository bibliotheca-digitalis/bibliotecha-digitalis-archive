1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,480
with a wanton mom she still calling out obscenities full of coerced rapture until only his name

2
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:35,240
was on her lips. The **** grew, his **** as it could go the instant her muscles began

3
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:42,280
clenching rhythmically to draw out ****. Watching him grunt like a beast, Claire felt the ****

4
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:49,200
lost in the rapture of her greedy **** milking his **** until **** with the stuff. While

5
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,680
the **** persisted, Shepherd looked into disoriented green eyes and demanded roughly, whose name

6
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,160
did you call as you ****? Claire could hardly breathe, was on the ebb of a powerful **** that

7
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:07,900
shook her to her bones, she whispered trying not to cry, yours. Because I am your alpha.

8
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:14,160
It was almost a roar. You want to be **** by me, do you understand? I'm the only man you

9
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:20,280
will ever **** from this moment on. Drocco roared. I will not share you, ever. You will

10
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,440
never have an opportunity to **** anyone else. His hand tightened around her neck as

11
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:29,600
he leaned in, growling. No other man alive should have had what I own. You will tell

12
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,180
me who they are and where they are and then you will declare me your alpha. Watching her

13
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,480
lips form words, dissecting the tortured desire and uncontrolled pleasure, he **** even faster,

14
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:46,640
snarling like a beast, still **** with **** he demanded. Who do you belong to? There were

15
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,920
tears leaking from the eyes squeezed shut as she jerked and twitched from his abused

16
00:01:50,920 --> 00:02:03,440
**** and ******* prolonged too far. Please, please stop. I can't. Who do you belong to?

17
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:12,440
Face full of pain, pleasure, Claire gasped. I belong to you. That's right, little one.

18
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,440
She became a voice as if leagues away. The ******* ******* abated and she sobbed when

19
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,680
the overstrong extended ******* ******* began to abate. More waves of ******* ******* burned

20
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,680
her from the inside when Shepherd purred, you belong only to me.

21
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:46,240
Hey everyone, get set to get wet. So a few months ago there was this article in the New

22
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,960
York Times with the title, a feud in wolf kink erotica raises a deep legal question,

23
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,520
subheader, what do copyright and authorship mean in the crowdsourced realm known as the

24
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:02,400
Omegaverse? And I gotta tell you, this article doesn't even come close to scratching the

25
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,520
surface of how coconuts this whole thing is. So where to start? Okay, so there was this

26
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:14,880
lawsuit surrounding some works of fiction that incorporated the fanfic trope known as

27
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:21,680
ABO or Omegaverse, and one thing led to another, and before you know it, the New York Times

28
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:28,600
gets to explain concepts like estrus cycles, claiming bites, forced impregnation, nodding,

29
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:38,000
which is, well, it's like, apparently it's a feature of wolf anatomy. It's got everything.

30
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:47,840
Sock puppetry, falsified documents, violent heat cycle, perjury, spurts of, well, oh no!

31
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,360
It's like the tiger king of wolf porn. And the deep legal question is, in effect, who

32
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:58,640
owns ideas? Where do you draw the line between what is and is not worthy of copyright? And

33
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:05,040
why does it involve so much bodily fluid? You're like the loudest climaxer I've ever

34
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,760
heard. It was like the sound of a 30 year old sprinkler finally going off for the first

35
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:25,360
time. So what is the Omegaverse? So I'm just going to call this a subgenre of erotica,

36
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,000
because if you ignore the fanfic specificity, that's all it is. The concept of Omegaverse

37
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,360
originally started as a subgenre of erotic speculative fanfiction in the supernatural

38
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:40,480
fandom and found broader appeal in the sprawling mega-fandom known as Super Hoolock, an amalgam

39
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,800
of Supernatural, Sherlock, and Doctor Who in the early 2010s. These stories are characterized

40
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,320
by alternate human societies, which are divided into a dominance hierarchy like wolves, but

41
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,880
not like real wolves, more like that study that divided wolves into alphas and betas

42
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,800
that was later debunked by the guy who did the original study. So it's based on like

43
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,040
bad wolf science. These societies contain alphas, the dominating alphas, the big boys,

44
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:12,000
the dick swingers, the betas. Despite its current common use as a pejorative for a submissive

45
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,300
man, betas in ABO are neutral. They're like the normies. Like sure, they will do the do,

46
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,340
but they don't go into like uncontrollable pheromone rages at the smell of an omega's

47
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:29,280
heat cycle. Speaking of which, omegas, the submissive, the soft boys, the seduces who

48
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,800
find themselves drawn to the shit-lording of alphas because they're pheromones or

49
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,360
whatever. The subgenre also includes other esoterica and tropes of wolf behavior like

50
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:47,840
mating for life, rutting, heat cycles, nodding, sense marking, claiming bites, and impreg,

51
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,320
which if the portmanteau doesn't tell you enough, is the ability for male characters,

52
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,080
usually omegas, to get pregnant. I don't think wolves can do that, but it is an important

53
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:03,640
staple of the genre. Any fictional property can be omegaversed. Lord of the Rings, Supernatural,

54
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:10,520
One Direction, Game of Thrones, Transformers, hell, there's even HAMILTON omegaverse fan

55
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:17,640
fiction and fan art. Like, a lot. So I stopped being actively involved in creating and consuming

56
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,860
fanworks around the time I started making internet videos back in the 1960s, so I kind

57
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:29,360
of phased out before this trend became popular. So while I had heard of it, my first real

58
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,700
exposure to the whole omegaverse thing was the New York Times article.

59
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,860
He knew for certain now that he did not want a submissive omega. When Kaylin had threatened

60
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,940
him, her voice low and possessive, her eyes flashing, her body ready to pounce, he almost

61
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,060
came in his pants.

62
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,060
Wow.

63
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,260
Wow.

64
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,100
So this brave new world is all very strange and confusing to me. I'm like Grandpa Simpson

65
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,100
over here.

66
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:06,980
I used to be with it, but then they changed what it was. Now what I'm with isn't it, and

67
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,540
what's it seems weird and scary to me.

68
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,900
But at the end of the day, it's just fanfic. Where could a lawsuit possibly come into this?

69
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:20,140
Well, since this trope is so popular, it was only a matter of time before people decided,

70
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,860
hey, I could make money off of this.

71
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,860
Commercial publication of omegaverse fiction is said by some to have started with 2007's

72
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:39,580
With Caution by J.L. Langley, but like the overwhelming majority of omegaverse fanfiction,

73
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,660
it centered male-male relationships.

74
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:47,460
The commonality of male-male pairings is the crux of the most batshit copyright claim ever.

75
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,660
Enter Addison Cain.

76
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:55,900
Now this is not her real name, but I'm going to just refer to her by her pen name because.

77
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:01,140
So Addison Cain, of course, like so many of us, begins her career as a fanfic writer.

78
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,980
She finds her fanfic calling writing erotic The Dark Knight Rises fanfiction starting

79
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:09,500
in 2012, and quickly becomes something of a darling in the fandom.

80
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,100
And like E.L. James before her, she starts to think, hey, maybe there's money to be

81
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:20,180
made here. So she pulls her fanfic and begins the process of revising it into something

82
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,340
that she can sell.

83
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:25,100
And while we are here, one of the many negative side effects of the infamous popularity of

84
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,780
books like Fifty Shades of Grey is this presumption that any professional author who so much as

85
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:35,940
admits to having been in fandom is just repurposing their old fanfic, and if they say they aren't,

86
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,700
they are probably lying about it.

87
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,140
I've seen a lot of people make that assumption about me just because I've joked about having

88
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,860
written fanfic in the past. Most fanfic authors who jump to professional authorship do not

89
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,360
just repurpose their old fanfic. Naomi Novik, for instance, got her start in the Master

90
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,860
and Commander fandom in the early 2000s, so that influence was there when she published

91
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:01,380
the Temeraire series, which is basically the Napoleonic Wars but with dragons. And a lot

92
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,780
of people who have read my book can tell that I have spent some time in the Transformers

93
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,780
fandom.

94
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,860
But these are not just works of fanfiction repackaged for profit. However, there are

95
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:16,700
some high profile examples of authors doing just that, a practice called filing the serial

96
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,360
numbers off. Some authors have found tremendous success with taking their fanfic and turning

97
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,020
it into original fiction. Fifty Shades of Grey was originally a Twilight fanfic, Cassandra

98
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:31,300
Clare's Mortal Instruments series began life as a Draco fanfic, After was a Wattpad

99
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:36,860
One Direction fanfic about a bad boy version of Harry Styles in college, and this is the

100
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:43,220
business model that Addison Cain, erotic Dark Knight Rises fanfic writer, hopes to hit paydirt

101
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,220
with.

102
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,420
Most publishers reject or ignore her queries, but eventually small indie publisher Blushing

103
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,840
Books accepts her manuscript for what would become the first book in a series, Born to

104
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:58,400
Be Bound, and the series soon earns over $370,000.

105
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,960
When she grew tamer as the overblown reaction to Force Estrus lessened, she would stay still

106
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:09,000
long enough for him to scent her, for his big hands to rub the b****** that had l******

107
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,480
all over her skin, to f*** it to her as he purred and gave affection.

108
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,480
Damn.

109
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:21,000
So, Cain becomes something of a star in the budding commercial Omegaverse published arena,

110
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,600
especially, according to Cain, in the MF field.

111
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,160
What in the fanfic world is called het, because fanfiction is one of the rare arenas where

112
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,720
heterosexual couplings are actually in the minority, but of course since this genre turns

113
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,880
out to be lucrative, she's not the only one doing it.

114
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,360
Enter author Zoe Ellis.

115
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,440
No relation, because it's not her real name either.

116
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:50,400
Zoe Ellis is the nom de plume of writing for Quill Inc's Books, which is a small publisher

117
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,820
based in London.

118
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:56,900
Her novel, Crave to Conquer, the first book in the Myth of Omega series, is published

119
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,560
in 2018.

120
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:05,080
Like Born to be Bound, it is also Omegaverse, also het, and also extremely violent and unpleasant

121
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,120
to read.

122
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,120
And I don't recommend it.

123
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:14,160
I don't know what I expected.

124
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,240
So not long after, someone approaches Cain and says, hey, this book seems to lift a lot

125
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,120
of plot points from your book, I think it might be plagiarism?

126
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,320
And of course, Cain does not take this well.

127
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,780
Well, Cain's publisher does not take this well.

128
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:33,460
She does not see this as a rising tide lifts all ships scenario, which generally in genres

129
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,840
like this it totally is.

130
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,160
Oh no, she sees a rival horning in on her territory.

131
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,720
Sinting it, you might say.

132
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:50,680
Anyway, Zoe Ellis must be destroyed.

133
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:56,640
In April of 2018, Cain's publisher, Blushing Books, sends DMCA takedown notices to Amazon,

134
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,120
Barnes and Noble, Google Play, Kobo, and iTunes.

135
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,680
Blushing claims that Crave to Conquer did a copyright infringement by lifting multiple

136
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,440
plot points from Born to be Bound, and that while Cain did not invent Omegaverse, she

137
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:18,000
did invent Het Omegaverse, which, hmm.

138
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,080
Anyway, DMCA takedown notices.

139
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,060
We hear a lot about them, but few know how they actually work or what they are supposed

140
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,060
to do.

141
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,800
Maybe we could get a lawyer to explain it.

142
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,360
Real phone call happening.

143
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
Hello?

144
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,240
Hey Lindsay, what's up?

145
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,880
Hey, Devin of Legal Eagle.

146
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,520
Have you heard about this Omegaverse lawsuit that are happening?

147
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:47,040
Yeah, I know a fair amount about copyright law, but I don't know anything about wolf

148
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,040
pornography.

149
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,760
Yeah, that's fine.

150
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,760
Okay.

151
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:56,120
So the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, was a law that was written in the very

152
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,560
early days of the internet to decide who would be liable for hosting copyright infringing

153
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,560
material.

154
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,180
It would be easy to imagine a world where a website was responsible for the content

155
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,460
that its users uploaded.

156
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:13,720
You can imagine that if a user uploaded some copyright infringing material, that the rights

157
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,100
holders could go after the platform for damages, and in that world, it would be way easier

158
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:23,000
to get damages from the website or platform instead of the random user who uploaded it.

159
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,260
The problem is that if that were the case, then no one would host a website that allowed

160
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,780
users to upload material because they would always be at the mercy of all of these copyright

161
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,860
suits.

162
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:40,000
So Congress decided in their infinite wisdom in the mid nineties that it made sense to

163
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,280
give away for platforms to have immunity from these copyright infringement lawsuits.

164
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:51,540
Section 512 of the DMCA actually gives platforms a safe harbor so that they're not responsible

165
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,040
for the content that their users upload if it's infringing of copyright.

166
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,120
But in able to receive that safe harbor, they actually have to do certain requirements.

167
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,640
The main requirement is that if a website or platform receives a notice, a DMCA notice

168
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,800
that some content that they're hosting infringes of someone's copyright, then they have to

169
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
take that down.

170
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,840
That's called a DMCA notice.

171
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:17,240
On the other hand, a user who believes that this DMCA takedown notice was given in error

172
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:22,520
can issue what's called a DMCA counter notice and get the content put back up.

173
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:28,080
So generally speaking, when a platform like YouTube, let's say, receives a proper DMCA

174
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:33,380
takedown notice notifying them that some material infringes on someone's copyright and they

175
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:39,400
take that material down, then the DMCA gives them a safe harbor and prevents YouTube specifically

176
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,520
from being sued for copyright infringement.

177
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:47,200
Now in exchange, copyright holders no longer have to go to court to get things taken down.

178
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,580
They just need to send a form.

179
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:55,580
So in a way, it can avoid a whole bunch of litigation costs when some user uploads some

180
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,480
content that's not theirs to upload in the first place.

181
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,940
So a DMCA takedown notice is a party claiming that a platform is hosting some content that's

182
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,660
illegally infringing on copyright.

183
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,580
And you can see how powerful this tool could be in the wrong hands that you can take down

184
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:17,380
almost any website or video that's on the internet so long as you make a DMCA claim,

185
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:22,300
which is why the DMCA requires you to have a good faith basis that there's copyright

186
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,480
infringement going on, that you have to swear under the penalty of perjury that you actually

187
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,620
own the underlying content that was infringed and that there was actually copyright infringement

188
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,740
going on.

189
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:39,420
Because if you're going to be making a claiming bite, you had better be ready to pair bond

190
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,420
for life.

191
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:44,480
I have no idea what that means, but Lindsay says it makes sense in context.

192
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,660
So there you go, I guess.

193
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,780
But when we're talking about the DMCA, if you're a platform, you can get in trouble

194
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,120
for refusing to take down different material.

195
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:00,060
If you refuse a DMCA takedown notice, then and only then can the underlying rights holder

196
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,340
sue the platform.

197
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:06,580
So if YouTube gets a DMCA claim and they say, no, we're going to leave this video up, then

198
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,980
they can be sued for copyright infringement.

199
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,620
But if they take the video down, then they're not liable to anyone, which is why you see

200
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:19,900
a lot of platforms, whether it's Twitter or Amazon or YouTube, they just get the DMCA

201
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:24,460
takedown notices and take those videos down because it's no skin off their nose and they

202
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:29,940
don't have to do an independent analysis to determine whether the video or other IP actually

203
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,460
does the infringing.

204
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,540
That's up to the person that made the claim.

205
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:40,440
And if the person made a claim that isn't valid, then they can be liable in court for

206
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,280
that invalid DMCA takedown.

207
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,400
So that's why you get a lot of platforms that are removing content without doing an

208
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,140
independent analysis because there's no reason for them to do any kind of independent analysis.

209
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:57,440
So this is a really complicated area of the law, but that is DMCA liability in a nutshell.

210
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,460
I cannot believe I just talked about wolf c**t for f**king five.

211
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:06,260
So Blushing Books issues DMCA claims across all platforms and all of Zoe Ellis's books

212
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,960
get taken down.

213
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:13,100
Even people who bought the book on e-readers like Kendall, the book magically disappears

214
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,620
from their devices.

215
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,820
So here is a big problem with the whole DRM thing, but we aren't getting into that today.

216
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:23,720
On April 19th, 2018, Kane wrote this Facebook post for her fans.

217
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,600
My publishing house has chosen to take legal action against another author for plagiarism

218
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,900
and copyright infringement of one of my books.

219
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:36,020
They own the rights to print and distribute my story, and should an outside influence

220
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,200
try to profit from it, they are legally bound to respond.

221
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,600
This is outside of my control.

222
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,120
Please consider that this is very serious.

223
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,200
A publishing house does not make a move like this without solid evidence and the full knowledge

224
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,440
that any legal battle is already won.

225
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,040
I am sick to my stomach thinking about it.

226
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,920
I wish this had never happened.

227
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,880
I apologize to every single one of you who were affected by this mess.

228
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,080
I apologize to anyone who has been upset by this.

229
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,820
And lastly, I apologize to my fans, and the fans of Omegaverse.

230
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,500
No one is winning here.

231
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:16,340
For the torches and pitchforks that will inevitably come my way, please remember that I'm just

232
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,300
a regular person stuck in the middle of this mess too.

233
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:23,500
I never asked for this, and I'm heartbroken.

234
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,280
So let's compare the two books.

235
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,020
Was Crave to Conquer plagiarizing Born to be Bound?

236
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:35,240
Born to be Bound, the world has been decimated by some plague or something, and now everybody

237
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,340
lives in cities under domes.

238
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:42,720
The Alpha Love Interest is head of a terrorist organization that has taken over the city

239
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,900
with biochemical weapons, and is a massive, chonky big boy.

240
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,000
You think you know what prison is, little one.

241
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,440
You do not.

242
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,260
In prison, one is surrounded by the worst possible breed of men.

243
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:03,600
If I wanted food or water, I had to kill for it.

244
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,500
He's a bit of a political zealot, and also he and all of his minions escaped from a prison

245
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,500
pit.

246
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,940
That term you use for it, the undercroft, I find it amusing.

247
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:20,860
A poetic word used to describe a place of darkness, filled with the pleas of thousands,

248
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,420
scraping at the doors to get out.

249
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:30,040
And also, he lives in the prison pit, and he was born in the darkness, molded by it.

250
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,040
Okay, it's Bane.

251
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
It's Bane.

252
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
It's obviously Bane.

253
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,040
We get it.

254
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
It's Bane.

255
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,600
And for crimes, crime is irrelevant.

256
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,560
I was never condemned to your undercroft.

257
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,080
I was born there.

258
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:48,080
Enter Claire, an Omega posing as a Beta with the help of hormone pills, who comes to Bane,

259
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,320
I mean Shepard, to beg him for help for her Omega Posse.

260
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,380
Will Bane discover her secret?

261
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,380
Yes.

262
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,380
Immediately.

263
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,700
Crave to Conquer Myth of Omega Book 1.

264
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,900
A large and powerful army has conquered a kingdom.

265
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:08,580
Their hormone-laden leader, Khal Drogo, or Drako, has promised his followers Omega mates,

266
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,060
even though Omegas have mysteriously disappeared from society.

267
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:17,780
Enter Caelan, an Omega spy posing as a Beta with the help of magic, who pretends to be

268
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,580
a researcher in order to get into Drako's library.

269
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,560
Will Drako discover her secret?

270
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,560
Yes.

271
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,560
Immediately.

272
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:30,200
Plot similarities include, but are not limited to, a dearth of Omegas.

273
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,240
Alphas take them hostage.

274
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,680
Omegas are in hiding and trying to suppress hormones, through pills or magic.

275
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,740
But they fail.

276
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:43,260
The Omega is captured by the Alpha when her magic or pills fail in public and she goes

277
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,520
into heat, nodding.

278
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,160
Dubious consent slash non-consent.

279
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,680
Both of the first books end with the heroine escaping their Alpha.

280
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,100
The list goes on from there.

281
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:58,180
But does Kane actually have a basis to make the claim that Crave to Conquer was infringing

282
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,220
on Born to be Bound's copyright?

283
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,700
Well here's a Facebook exchange from August of 2018.

284
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:09,400
So I've read almost all the MF Omegaverse on Amazon, and I read a lot of MM Omegaverse.

285
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,580
There are some differences that I've noticed, other than the obvious, but one of them is

286
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:18,140
that the MF pairings tend to be rough and almost brutal sometimes.

287
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:22,420
Even when the Alpha and Omega are in a relationship, or have feelings for each other.

288
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,080
The MM stories tend to be a lot sweeter.

289
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,720
And there isn't the same kind of violence, for lack of a better word, in their matings.

290
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,360
I think the reason the male-female pairings are more violent is because I was the first

291
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,740
to write them, and I'm a non-con, dub-con writer.

292
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,160
What followed suit was keeping in line with the trend.

293
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,160
LOL.

294
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,520
Addison corrupts everyone.

295
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,520
Stunning.

296
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,500
How did you get into writing Omegaverse books, especially MF Omegaverse?

297
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,920
I'm not going to lie, yours were the first ones that I found that were not MM.

298
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,420
I was the first for male-female.

299
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:02,280
I loved reading Omegaverse fanfiction, but got so frustrated that it never included women.

300
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:08,720
So I made my own meta, Rules of the Universe, for male-female Omegaverse, and wrote my own.

301
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,880
So Kane claims that she innovated invading queer spaces and making them all normie and

302
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,300
het.

303
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,820
And also, she innovated non-con.

304
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,020
Sure, Jan.

305
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,420
This is also not true.

306
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:27,060
The first mainstream heterosexual Omegaverse novel that was published by a major publisher

307
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:32,620
was called Alpha and Omega by Patricia Briggs beginning in 2008.

308
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:39,180
And the idea that Kane innovated bringing non-con into this fuckery is just...

309
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,780
okay.

310
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,780
Sure, Jan.

311
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,920
This is not the first time that Kane has gone after the competition, either.

312
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:50,060
In March of 2016, she wrote a Facebook post charging that another author, who wrote under

313
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:55,120
the pen name The Dragon's Maiden, had copied at least, again, 15 plot points from Born

314
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,300
to Be Bread.

315
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:00,200
Just so you don't believe her hype, I have tried to be lighthearted about this, but it

316
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,600
has been a nightmare.

317
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,900
I finally posted a response to the plagiarism of BTBB by The Dragon's Maiden in her story

318
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,600
to mate an Omega.

319
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,960
This was my post, which was taken down within 30 minutes.

320
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,240
After the post will be her response.

321
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,960
Do I believe she plagiarized my story?

322
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
Yes.

323
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,960
Do I expect everyone to agree with me?

324
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,960
No.

325
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,160
The DMCA will be the final judge of the matter.

326
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,640
I just had to say my piece, and I know you can respect that.

327
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,280
Her response was to shut down all comments and write this.

328
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,240
This isn't meant to sound snide, so please don't take it that way, but I am not going

329
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,540
to stop writing because I know 100% that I am not copying you.

330
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,360
But to the main reason I am messaging you.

331
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,360
If I keep getting rude and threatening messages from your readers, I will start reporting

332
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,360
them.

333
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,840
I woke up to several this morning.

334
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,440
I sincerely hope you aren't encouraging that kind of behavior, but if I find out you

335
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,320
are, I will feel it necessary to report you as well.

336
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,280
If you would like to discuss this farther, please feel free to email me at email removed

337
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,800
to protect her privacy.

338
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,680
Dragon's Maiden denied she had stolen anything, and alleged that

339
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,000
Her fans came after me, even though our stories, other than being Omegaverse, were nothing

340
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,060
alike.

341
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:13,220
There are some similarities, but I honestly believe that they don't go beyond common

342
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,180
Lycan traits or actual wolf behavior.

343
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,780
Mm, you know, let's just ignore the part about wolf behavior.

344
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,820
Dragon's Maiden quickly caved, deciding it just wasn't worth fighting against Cain

345
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,300
and her fans, and pulled her stories.

346
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,300
Sorry.

347
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,940
Due to the number of comments that are either borderline threatening, you're going to

348
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:36,660
regret, slash be sorry, etc, or outright threatening, a threat to trace my IP and make me stop writing,

349
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,340
it was recommended to me that I remove my work.

350
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:43,940
As it stands right now, I have filed a police report due to the harassment.

351
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,260
People like this believe their own lies.

352
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:50,500
Her story is being taken down for plagiarism, plain and simple.

353
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,860
I have one last point I want to make.

354
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:58,100
I have not ever stirred up my fans against another writer.

355
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:02,700
So Cain had gone after other authors before crying copyright infringement, but not with

356
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,580
so much DMCA zealotry as she did with Zoe Ellis.

357
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:11,500
While the DMCA allows for users to upload stuff without opening up platforms for liability,

358
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:17,660
it is a touch, to put it mildly, flawed, and is a system, according to legal experts, that

359
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,020
is easily abused.

360
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:23,700
For instance, authors might weaponize the DMCA to take down their rivals, and megalopolies

361
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,300
like Amazon aren't going to take the time to make sure the DMCA claims are legit.

362
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:33,180
After all, by nature of the law, the legal liability is on the person making the claim,

363
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,540
not the platform hosting the content.

364
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:39,580
If DMCA claims aren't legit, it can take months to undo them.

365
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,580
Months of lost income.

366
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,200
And there's no real incentive for platforms like Amazon to be quick about checking those

367
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,200
things out.

368
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,980
In a lot of cases, the only thing you can do is...sue.

369
00:25:49,980 --> 00:26:00,080
So Zoe Ellis sues Addison Cain in Oklahoma federal court, where Ellis' American Digital

370
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,220
Distributor is based, in October of 2018.

371
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,100
The same month, Ellis wrote the following on her website in a post titled,

372
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,060
No one owns a genre, least of all Omegaverse.

373
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,500
Instead of responding to attempts to resolve this issue amicably, the publisher and author

374
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,860
chose to delay communication and persisted with threats of blackmail and attempted intimidation,

375
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,580
as well as continued existing attacks against my character and books in collusion with others.

376
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,180
I've since learned of other MF Omegaverse readers who were similarly targeted by the

377
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:28,980
same parties, including one who abandoned her story due to threats and takedown attempts.

378
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:33,380
My publisher, after seeking professional guidance, realized legal action was unavoidable.

379
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:37,400
Obviously, as a new author, this was a scary conclusion for me, but the various actions

380
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,180
taken by the author and publisher have been astonishingly wide-ranging and consistent,

381
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,580
and can ultimately prevent me from having a successful career.

382
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:47,620
I wrote my own interpretation of the Omegaverse, creating my own character's world and stories,

383
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,740
and I have the right to publish and promote my work without unprovoked interference and

384
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,460
defamation from others, regardless of their popularity.

385
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,260
Anyone who reads both works without bias can clearly see they are not the same story, even

386
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,940
if they are unfamiliar with the genre.

387
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:02,580
My publisher has now filed a lawsuit to address these unwarranted attacks on my works and

388
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,580
reputation."

389
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:08,800
So Ellis sues Kane as an individual, as well as the digital distributor, and the publisher

390
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:15,060
blushing books, and the anonymous posters that went after Ellis, who she seems to assume

391
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:19,260
are sock puppets operated by Addison Kane and or her publisher.

392
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:23,240
In addition to suing her for the wrongful DMCA takedowns, she sues for a whole bunch

393
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:28,840
of other stuff like malicious interference of contract, copyright misuse, misrepresenting

394
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:34,200
claims under the DMCA, and a bunch of other torts, negligence, defamation, the list goes

395
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,500
on and on.

396
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:41,000
The lawsuit effectively begins with outlining what Omegaverse is in a context of genre.

397
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,100
Omegaverse, or Alpha Beta Omega, ABO, or Alpha Beta Omega Dynamics as its slightly broader

398
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,480
category is called, is a collection of related tropes that tend to correlate in many stories.

399
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,040
ABO defines stories in which humans are not only categorized by gender, but also by a

400
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,320
second dynamic.

401
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,600
To be recognized as an Omegaverse, at least some of a vast number of potential characteristics

402
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,000
need to be present.

403
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,040
These include imprinting, the mythology within Omega, scenting, pheromones are excessive,

404
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:14,120
Omega heat cycles, and Alpha rut, mate bonding, a permanent bond between the partners, nodding,

405
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:19,760
a physiological condition experienced by the Alpha during mating to aid in pregnancy, male

406
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,400
and female.

407
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:29,800
A lawyer actually wrote this and, uh, multiple federal judges had to read it.

408
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,640
The lawsuit also puts front and center the fact that authors abusing copyright law in

409
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,520
the romance genre is also nothing new.

410
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:41,000
The literary world, especially within the romance genre and its sub-genres, has experienced

411
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,640
anti-competitive behavior by certain bad actors attempting to monopolize the industry through

412
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,560
misuse of trademark and copyright law, ranging from misuse of takedown notices to litigation

413
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,320
over the use of a common word in a book title.

414
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,900
Unlawful practices are becoming more and more prevalent.

415
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,240
So let's take a moment to discuss Cockygate.

416
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,840
After the novel Cocky Bastard by Penelope Ward and by Keeland, published by Ever After

417
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:13,160
Romance, became a big hit in 2015, the genre became flooded with titles involving the word

418
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,600
cocky.

419
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:19,520
Fine author Felina Hopkins took this a step further to make sure that her novels, Cocker

420
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,960
Brothers, the cocky series, would stay above the dick-hun laden swill by submitting two

421
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,120
trademark claims to the US Patent and Trademark Office.

422
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:34,040
One, trademarking the usage of the word cocky in certain fonts, and two, officially having

423
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:38,120
full stop control of the word in all romance novel titles.

424
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,680
Naturally, people disputed this.

425
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:44,600
It became a huge controversy and a legal battle is still ongoing, but Hopkins did end up releasing

426
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:49,240
her claims, which means you can expect the sequel to Axiom's end, the cocky bugman

427
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,840
from Planet Cock Gobble, to hit shelves in Fall of 2021.

428
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,560
I don't know if you can tell, but I did not write that line.

429
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,960
So Kane hits back in a blog post on her personal website.

430
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,760
My fight is also yours.

431
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,700
We cannot allow one bad player to change the rules of the game.

432
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:13,480
We must stand as a community and refute the idea that one author can bully and manipulate

433
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,340
another author over DMCA sent by their publisher.

434
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:21,920
It sets a dangerous precedent for the next author, who is just trying to protect their

435
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,640
work and their livelihoods.

436
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:30,880
Just think about all those DMCA authors are sending to stop Travis McRae's pirate website.

437
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,680
Can you imagine if he chose to drag you into court over just one of them?

438
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,160
Unfortunately, I can.

439
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,280
I will no longer keep silent.

440
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:46,160
It is now time to hashtag get loud.

441
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:51,680
Kane also started a GoFundMe for her legal fees, which starts with the bolded header.

442
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:58,040
Authors should not be sued or harassed for their publisher rightfully filing DMCA's.

443
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,760
Rightfully?

444
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,520
Interesting.

445
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,880
This lawsuit is a 512f case, which is actually very rare.

446
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,840
Notice and takedown is the section 512 of the DMCA.

447
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,200
512f is what allows people to sue other people for bogus takedowns.

448
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,800
But it's very rare because, well, it's expensive to sue, and victims of DMCA abuse

449
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,640
usually get mired in the internal bullshit of the platforms they're using before it

450
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,400
gets to the lawsuit point.

451
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:31,240
Part of the DMCA is you are supposed to consider fair use before you issue a DMCA takedown.

452
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,840
Moreover, someone who is a victim of a false DMCA takedown probably isn't going to be

453
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,640
under the umbrella of a major corporation with a lot of assets.

454
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:44,440
They are probably going to be a smaller creator, or in this case, a small press without a lot

455
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,440
of resources.

456
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:52,040
One of the last high profile 512f cases was YouTube suing someone for sending false DMCA

457
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:56,760
takedowns, because YouTube has the resources to actually go to court and could afford it,

458
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,000
and even in that case, they ended up settling out of court.

459
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,880
So as they were building their case, Ellis' lawyers thought they had a strong position,

460
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,800
but according to that New York Times article, they struggled to find a prior case that addressed

461
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,360
whether fanfiction tropes could be protected by copyright.

462
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:16,680
Said Gideon Ling Kecum, a lawyer who represents Quill Inc. and Zoe Ellis,

463
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:21,920
We were looking at cases to see if the courts had ever dealt with anything like this before.

464
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:27,720
Dealing with the emergence of this new literary genre, we found there weren't any.

465
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,640
But then we get to the deposition, which, like so many elements of this case, seems

466
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,880
weirdly fixated on the originated in fanfic element.

467
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,240
Your book published by Blushing, okay, the first of the books that we're talking about

468
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,240
here, is that fanfiction?

469
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,320
It is not fanfiction.

470
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,860
And why is it not fanfiction?

471
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,600
To be a fanfiction, it has to exist in a universe that you don't own.

472
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,520
When I wrote the story, I hardly used anything from that universe at the time, I just used

473
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,600
like a couple little things here.

474
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,340
When I rewrote the story, all of that was taken out, characters were modified, scenes

475
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,980
were rewritten, so it is definitely not fanfiction.

476
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,940
So let me see if this is a different question.

477
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,760
Is that book in the Omegaverse?

478
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,680
That book is an Omegaverse book.

479
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,060
Are there aspects of the Omegaverse that are manifested in that book that constitute a

480
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,260
reality or universe that you contend you own?

481
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,520
I don't own Omegaverse.

482
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,820
Is there any part of the first book which creates a reality that you contend you do

483
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,820
own?

484
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,020
I do not own Omegaverse.

485
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,580
I understand, that's not what I'm asking.

486
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,580
Okay.

487
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:29,020
I understood it, and again, I told you there are places where I'm just not going to understand,

488
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:33,060
because I don't know that much about fanfiction, and I don't know that much about the Omegaverse.

489
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:37,620
As I understand it, it's not fanfiction, because it's not in a universe that you don't own.

490
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:41,220
Look, I'll just try this one more time and then I'll drop it, and I'll preface that question

491
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,220
with this.

492
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,780
I'm having a problem with what I perceive as a logical inconsistency.

493
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,780
Okay.

494
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,780
Okay.

495
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,460
Your books are in the Omegaverse.

496
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,460
Yes.

497
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,460
We agree on that.

498
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,460
Nobody owns the Omegaverse.

499
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,460
Exactly.

500
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,500
Fanfiction is books that are set in a universe you don't own.

501
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,500
Yes.

502
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,500
But despite the fact that your books are set in a universe that nobody owns, they're not

503
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,500
fanfiction?

504
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,500
Exactly.

505
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,500
Number on the top.

506
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,500
What is the number on the top?

507
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,500
There are no numbers on the top.

508
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,500
There's letters.

509
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,500
Oh!

510
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,440
Okay, Mr. Lawyer Man, let me help you out.

511
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:17,740
The confusion here seems to be semantic, and is probably based in the use of the verse

512
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,740
part of the word.

513
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:24,500
I would agree that something set in the Omegaverse is not fanfiction because Omegaverse is the

514
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,140
name of a subgenre.

515
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:30,800
The word Omegaverse isn't used in the same way we use phrases like the Marvel Cinematic

516
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,580
Universe, which if you set a story in that, would be considered fanfiction.

517
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,340
So I can see where it could be confusing.

518
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:43,580
However, that question is completely immaterial to this case and the DMCA.

519
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:48,860
Whether or not Born to be Bound was or is fanfic has fuck all to do with whether or

520
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,860
not there was plagiarism.

521
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:55,580
The fact that Omegaverse originates in fanfic is completely immaterial to the legality of

522
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,860
this case.

523
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,920
And I don't understand why these lawyers, or the New York Times for that matter, even

524
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,180
mention that they couldn't find a fanfic-related precedent.

525
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:09,000
I'm sure one day the legality of fanfic is going to get litigated and it's going to suck.

526
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,580
But what does it have to do with this?

527
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:16,280
A case of DMCA takedowns being abused by an author trying to snuff out the competition.

528
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,100
Kane claims that Ellis' book hit a lot of the same plot points as hers did.

529
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,280
Which is true.

530
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,620
But in copyright law, there is a doctrine called sans affair that is, you cannot copyright

531
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:30,560
tropes that consumers expect of a genre.

532
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,260
Take YA Paranormal Romance for example.

533
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:38,620
You can't copyright the concept of like, a cute but haunted high school boy who is

534
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:43,720
also secretly a monster of some sort, who becomes obsessed with the clumsy unremarkable

535
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,720
female protagonist.

536
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:50,520
It's like diamonds.

537
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:55,480
Pick any two YA Paranormal Romance novels from the early 2010s, and each one is easily

538
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,960
going to share 15 plot points with any other, which if you line them up next to each other

539
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:05,500
with no context, could look pretty damning, when in reality, that's just part and parcel

540
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,500
of the genre.

541
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,480
In other words, Crave to Conquer is about as similar to Born to be Bound as any of the

542
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,840
shit million Twilight knockoffs were to Twilight.

543
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,500
Born to be Bound and Crave to Conquer, aside from using Omegaverse tropes, aren't even

544
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,880
in the same genre.

545
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,760
One is future dystopia, the other is fantasy.

546
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:27,140
So while there's no case law directly about genres that have emerged from the internet,

547
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,600
that doesn't really matter.

548
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:34,520
Copyright, fair use, and sans affair included, are elastic on purpose to fit changing circumstances.

549
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:39,580
And it must needs be remarked that it is extremely ironic that we have a fanfiction author who

550
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:44,220
published her erotic fiction which was just Batman fanfic with the serial numbers filed

551
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:50,460
off, filing DMCA claims against an author who just appears to be using Omegaverse tropes

552
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:56,660
rather than just repurposing her old fanfiction- I'm sorry, her PUBLISHER filed DMCA claims

553
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:00,500
against an author who appears to just be using Omegaverse tropes in original fiction.

554
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:04,340
Addison Cain had nothing to do with those DMCA claims.

555
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,560
See, that's foreshadowing.

556
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,400
So the issue here is that a lot of the tropes that Cain is claiming Ellis infringed upon

557
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,640
aren't just common to the by now well-worn Omegaverse, they're also kind of common to

558
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,920
books.

559
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,840
Omegaverse, and indeed fanfiction as a concept, did not innovate most of these tropes.

560
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:30,600
The I don't like you slash enemies to lover trope is a feature of most romance novels.

561
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,980
You know, Beast, Beauty, Something Something, Tale as Old as Time.

562
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:41,220
Like, even the OG Pride and Prejudice does the I don't like you to lovers thing.

563
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:46,460
Alpha male dub-conning a woman who eventually falls in love with him is also a romance novel

564
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,460
staple.

565
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:53,420
From the chic in 1919 to bodice-ribbers in the 1970s and 80s to what we see now, sexual

566
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:57,380
violence turning into true love is nothing new.

567
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:01,920
The whole Alpha Omega thing is just a roided up version of what you get in bodice-ribbers,

568
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,200
just with, you know, more fluids and, well.

569
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,920
For fuck's sake, well before Omegaverse was even a thing, the common parlance term

570
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:16,480
for a domineering male hero in the mainstream romance novel genre was, and continues to

571
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,240
be, an Alpha.

572
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:23,480
And while the dub-con and non-con elements have fallen out of favor in most mainstream

573
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:28,380
romance novel presses, it's still a big thing in self-published works and small presses

574
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,540
like these.

575
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:36,180
So to be clear, Addison Cain's publisher is completely in the wrong here.

576
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,420
Those DMCA claims were illegal and illegitimate.

577
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,460
Cain's PUBLISHER is wrong.

578
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:46,860
Even if Ellis totally stole those ideas from Born to be Bound, the ideas she stole were

579
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:52,620
too much part and parcel of the subgenre of Omegaverse to possibly constitute copyright

580
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:56,100
infringement.

581
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:01,360
So the only way Oklahoma could have jurisdiction is if Addison Cain personally did stuff to

582
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:06,480
people in the state of Oklahoma, in this case, Zoe Ellis's digital distributor, which is

583
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,740
based in Oklahoma.

584
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,920
So Cain moves to dismiss herself from the Oklahoma case.

585
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,800
She is, after all, a Virginia resident.

586
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,560
And Cain is like, no, I didn't do it, the publisher did it.

587
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,780
I had nothing to do with those DMCA claims.

588
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,500
I've never even been to Oklahoma.

589
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,060
No, it wasn't me.

590
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,540
It was the one-armed man.

591
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:34,240
So Cain submits an affidavit in an official court document claiming that she had no contacts

592
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,220
with Oklahoma and she had nothing to do with those takedown notices.

593
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,360
That was all Blushing Books.

594
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,640
She didn't know about it.

595
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,420
She didn't have anything to do about it.

596
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,780
Yeah, cross my hair.

597
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:50,840
In any event, Blushing Books' DMCA notice without Moore is insufficient to satisfy the

598
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:56,320
requirements of jurisdictional due process over an out-of-state individual.

599
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:02,580
Moreover, even if the DMCA notice was sent to Draft2Digital in Oklahoma, that communication

600
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:09,880
would not be attributable to Mrs. did not purposefully direct any activities at Oklahoma,

601
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:15,540
including drafting or sending the DMCA takedown notice to Draft2Digital or other third parties.

602
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:21,760
Blushing Books sent the DMCA takedown notice to all of the third-party publishers and retailers,

603
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,760
including Draft2Digital.

604
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:28,200
Thus, even if the court finds that it can exercise personal jurisdiction over Blushing

605
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:33,880
Books, which Ms. argues that it cannot, it should dismiss all of plaintiff's claims

606
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:39,860
against Mrs. because she did not personally direct any acts or activities into the state

607
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,860
of Oklahoma.

608
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:47,160
I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct, executed on

609
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,480
November 26th, 2018.

610
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,000
So the motion against Cain in Oklahoma is dismissed.

611
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,080
But the case against the publisher, Blushing Books, continues in Oklahoma.

612
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:01,800
Oh, and also there is a second lawsuit in Virginia where Cain lives.

613
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,800
We'll get to that.

614
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,120
But in the meantime, the charges against Cain are dropped, and it's time for Discovery

615
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,440
in the Oklahoma case.

616
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:22,620
Discovery is a pretrial procedure in a lawsuit in which each party can obtain evidence from

617
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:29,220
the other party by means of discovery devices such as interrogatories, requests for documents,

618
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,440
requests for admissions, and so on.

619
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,140
So Quill Inc.'s lawyers demand to see all the correspondence between Cain and her publisher

620
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:41,100
during this time and… oh boy.

621
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:46,860
DMCAs have been sent to Amazon, iBooks, Barnes and Nobles, Kobo, and Google Play.

622
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:50,460
When the books come down and the inevitable backlash begins, this is what I intend to

623
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,980
post on Facebook about it.

624
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:54,300
If you have any feedback on this, please let me know.

625
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,640
Smiley face.

626
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:00,580
My publishing house has chosen to take legal action against another author for plagiarism

627
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,580
and…

628
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:05,300
Your Facebook post is extremely strong and I 100% support you making it.

629
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:10,000
I think your decision to hide behind blushing and paint us as the instigator is absolutely

630
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
how it should be.

631
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,420
Let us take the heat.

632
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,620
All you have to say is, my publisher chose to take action.

633
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,100
It was and continues to be out of my hands.

634
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,100
Let people get mad at us.

635
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,100
Hi Anne.

636
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,100
Okay, here are my thoughts.

637
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,500
It's important to take a stand.

638
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,340
After all, blushing books wouldn't just be doing this for me, you're doing it for

639
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,180
blushing's best interests too.

640
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,660
Zoe Ellis is stealing from both of us.

641
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:33,240
I would not write the author a warning letter, she is aware of what she did and has already

642
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,680
stirred up shit and lied by omission.

643
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,080
File the DMCA's immediately to Amazon, iTunes, and Barnes and Noble, should only take five

644
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,080
minutes each.

645
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:45,240
If you want to write her afterward with demands to see her financials, by all means, go for

646
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,240
it.

647
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,480
If Amazon, iTunes, and Barnes and Noble comply with the DMCA, which they should considering

648
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,400
the evidence, and a stanker rises, I am prepared for the backlash.

649
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,920
I went through it with Reborn and I'm not afraid.

650
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,600
To settle it down, I will deflect to blushing and remain distant and naive.

651
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,240
Readers sent in complaints.

652
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,840
The publisher filed a DMCA based on evidence they uncovered of copyright infringement.

653
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,880
Any issues should be raised with them.

654
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,800
This is out of my hands and I will remain silent publicly unless it gets to a point

655
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,280
that a single, professional post on the topic, once again deflecting to the publisher, needs

656
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,520
to be posted.

657
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,980
Some people will be reactive right out of the gate, but that's why I have a publisher

658
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:22,980
to hide behind.

659
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,360
It will pass quickly.

660
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,800
So long as they stay above the fray, we're all good.

661
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,080
I'm very good at not engaging with crazy.

662
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:39,460
So, if it's not obvious, this is perjury.

663
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:44,400
She was the one who demanded the DMCA takedowns and her publisher colluded with her to make

664
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:50,840
it seem like she was this innocent dumbass who had no idea how the system works.

665
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,640
My publisher did everything.

666
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,760
I didn't have anything to do with it.

667
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,920
I agree with the others you've spoken to.

668
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,760
I don't think you will suffer any negative consequences by moving forward.

669
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:07,520
Amazon might not take the other author's book down, but I don't see you or Blushing

670
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,160
being penalized in any way.

671
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:13,640
There's no way she could file anything against your book since yours came out two years earlier.

672
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,640
Woof.

673
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,200
I mean, howl.

674
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:24,080
But here is a particularly prescient observation sent by Blushing Books to Kane right before

675
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,160
they start raining DMCA fire down.

676
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,600
However, before we move ahead, I'd like you to really think about whether you'd

677
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,600
want to do this.

678
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,600
I agree.

679
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,600
It's sickening.

680
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,920
She clearly plagiarized your entire plot.

681
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,320
But that having been said, is this really hurting you?

682
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:45,680
If anything, fans of her books reading the reviews of her books might buy yours.

683
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,760
Controversy frequently helps books.

684
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,640
I don't think there's a point at which anyone would ever be on Amazon and be trying

685
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,480
to decide between her book and yours and choose hers.

686
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,400
They might read both, but one or the other?

687
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,440
Probably not.

688
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,720
If we move ahead with this, you'll have a profound enemy for life.

689
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,280
Someone who will likely attack you at every opportunity and get all of her friends to

690
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,280
do so.

691
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,320
She'll come up with another pen name and be your worst nightmare.

692
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:17,880
I'm not trying to tell you to not do it, but I do want you to go in with the clear-eyed

693
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,620
understanding that, as hard as it might be to swallow, doing nothing is an option that

694
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,520
should be on the table.

695
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:29,760
However, if you want to go ahead with it, blushing supports you 100%.

696
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,560
Now that I've thought it over, both books should be taken down.

697
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,680
She shouldn't profit off screwing me over.

698
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,760
What can I say but yikes.

699
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,760
And it did not end here.

700
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:46,000
They went back and forth for months trying to keep Ellis' books from making any money,

701
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,600
even after Ellis had successfully fought the claims that originally took her books down.

702
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,880
Her books are back up on iBooks.

703
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,900
They are also on Kobo and Google Play, and I'm super mad, not at you, at this fucked

704
00:45:58,900 --> 00:45:59,900
up situation.

705
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:03,520
Can we please send out DMCA takedown notices to these people?

706
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,720
Also what are we going to do about Amazon?

707
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,720
Help!

708
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,760
She's lost her Apple account, though her other titles are still on Barnes and Nobles

709
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,760
and Kobo.

710
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,320
I don't know what mechanism we can use to shut her down completely as an author, unless

711
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:21,520
you want to try to trademark Omegaverse, which we might be able to get.

712
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,320
I think our best strategy right now is to push Amazon hard.

713
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,440
If she loses her account completely, it will in effect shut her down.

714
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,740
If you have a different, better plan or strategy, please share it.

715
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,200
Book 3 needs to come down too.

716
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,280
I don't want her to make any more money off this series.

717
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:43,480
So um, this is what the kids call a bad look.

718
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:48,880
So the plaintiffs file a motion that Kane perjured herself, she should be a judge guilty

719
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:54,320
of civil contempt, and three days later the defendants offer a complete settlement, admit

720
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:59,520
that Ellis did not infringe on anyone's copyright, they revoke the DMCA takedowns,

721
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,880
and the case is closed.

722
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,880
In Oklahoma, anyway.

723
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,400
Justice is served?

724
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,360
Well hold on there, Pard, this is just the Oklahoma case.

725
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,200
Remember, there is still a case going on in Virginia.

726
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:18,080
So the Virginia case keeps going, and here is where it gets even weirder.

727
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:23,400
So the Virginia case is specifically against Kane, not the publisher, because Kane is based

728
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,600
in Virginia.

729
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:29,080
And while Ellis's claim did involve all the original stuff about like, you know, wrongful

730
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:35,360
DMCA takedowns, it also has all of this other stuff that is just like way harder to prove

731
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:40,980
in a court of law, and they probably overshot their load with too many claims.

732
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,320
So most of it gets thrown out.

733
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,280
But you know, whatever, they've got her where they want her.

734
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:50,040
If the judge or a jury finds Ms. Kane in the wrong, the case would send a message to

735
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:55,200
overzealous genre writers that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act is not to be abused.

736
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,320
But then it just kind of fizzles out.

737
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:04,280
Usually in cases like this it's the defendant that becomes insolvent, but here Quillink

738
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:10,400
dissolved and had to drop the case because apparently they just ran out of money.

739
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,760
And when Quillink lost their counsel, they couldn't hire a new counsel because there's

740
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:20,060
this like obscure UK law that says you can't do that.

741
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:26,760
So in order to continue the case, they'd basically have to create a new legal entity in the US

742
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,040
and start over.

743
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:34,360
And on top of all that, the only part of that case that's still ongoing is Kane's countersuit

744
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,440
in Virginia.

745
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:41,160
And because this is endless petty fandom bullshit, the counterclaim is for like defamation of

746
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:47,600
character and emotional damages and more of that shit, accusing also Zoe Ellis of using

747
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:51,820
sock puppets to like, you know, leave bad reviews.

748
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:55,000
And what's going on right now is Ellis just seems to have disappeared and is just kind

749
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:01,040
of ignoring Kane's counterclaim, which is shitty and kind of suspicious in and of itself.

750
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:07,020
But like at this point, we're way out of the weeds of like DMCA abuse and into just petty

751
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,760
fandom drama.

752
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,380
So I guess we've come full circle.

753
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:28,320
So one of the benefits of it taking us roughly like four years on average to edit one of

754
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:35,240
these episodes is that while we were editing it, the case finally got resolved.

755
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:38,520
And you'll never guess how it ended.

756
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:44,000
Was there some consequence to Addison Kane and her oops all perjury?

757
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,980
The US federal court in the Eastern District of Virginia has dismissed all of the claims

758
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,800
against me with prejudice.

759
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:56,440
This is an important victory, not just for myself and my family, but for all authors

760
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:01,400
who have ever or may ever find themselves in a situation where they must defend their

761
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,400
copyright.

762
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,800
Of course not.

763
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,580
The entire case was dismissed with prejudice.

764
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:12,880
And Kane really wants you to know that in a post she titled a win for the author community.

765
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:18,380
So the lesson learned here seems to be doubling down.

766
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,260
I didn't do anything wrong.

767
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:24,800
The DMCA takedowns were valid and I'm the real victim here.

768
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:35,080
For those new to legal jargon, it is a serious matter for a judge to dismiss counts of a

769
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,320
lawsuit with prejudice.

770
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:41,260
And it is only done in the most egregious of circumstances.

771
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:46,520
So I spent like my entire Saturday digging through every single court document in this

772
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,080
stupid case.

773
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:53,540
And I couldn't find any that were actually submitted by the court that used with prejudice

774
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:58,600
in their verbiage anywhere except for the defendant's motion to dismiss the case where

775
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:02,060
they request that the court dismiss it with prejudice.

776
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:07,280
And the motion was granted, but the word prejudice with or without doesn't come up at all.

777
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:13,860
And that's because with prejudice is kind of implied when a case is dismissed for failure

778
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:16,260
to prosecute as was the case here.

779
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:20,100
They fizzled out and missed a bunch of deadlines and they pissed the judge off and the judge

780
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,500
was like, okay, screw it.

781
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,220
You clearly aren't taking this seriously.

782
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:30,020
That is why the case was dismissed, not because the DMCA takedowns are valid.

783
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:35,700
And she's definitely wrong about with prejudice only being done in the most egregious of circumstances

784
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:38,440
because with prejudice is pretty much the default.

785
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:42,520
If your claims get dismissed, it's usually with prejudice.

786
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:46,260
And in this case, the judge probably doesn't bother even stating with prejudice in the

787
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:51,660
court documents because it's not the all-caps big deal she seems to think it is.

788
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:54,660
Think how they scrum and they see how I do it.

789
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,520
Dismissed with prejudice.

790
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:00,180
If anything, it's more unusual for cases to be dismissed without prejudice.

791
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:05,140
I mean, it's not uncommon, but with prejudice is more common.

792
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:08,820
Basically, the case was dismissed because it was clear that the plaintiff could not

793
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:13,100
move forward, not because the case itself was without merit.

794
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:18,060
And don't get me wrong, some of it was, but the stuff surrounding copyright and DMCA,

795
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:22,760
especially since Cain perjured herself in the Oklahoma case, they had a pretty good

796
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,760
case there.

797
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,300
And Cain is right about some things, namely how suspicious and weird it is that Zoe Ellis

798
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:33,240
created the case in Virginia and then just kind of fizzled it out and liquidated her

799
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:36,980
own company, meaning Cain can't pursue her counterclaim.

800
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:41,380
Like, yeah, that is a little sus, but again, that has nothing to do with the validity of

801
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:46,060
the DMCA takedowns or any damages Ellis might have incurred because of them.

802
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:49,860
She goes on to state that the settlement between Blushing and Quilt Link that happened in the

803
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:55,100
Oklahoma case after she was dismissed from it is legally meaningless.

804
00:52:55,100 --> 00:53:00,820
Instead, Blushing made a single statement to avoid further litigation claiming no plagiarism

805
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:04,440
had occurred and that their DMCA's were invalid.

806
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,980
That statement legally means nothing.

807
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:09,740
Wait, wait, no.

808
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:13,180
Yes, actually, it means a lot.

809
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:17,220
It means they broke the law and are admitting that they broke the law.

810
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:20,260
The funny thing here is that she undermines her own point.

811
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:26,180
Like plagiarism is not a legal term, therefore plagiarism is not technically illegal in the

812
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:32,620
way that like stabbing is not a legal term, therefore stabbing is not technically illegal,

813
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:37,060
but assault with a deadly weapon is ipso facto.

814
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:41,100
If there was no plagiarism, then there was no copyright infringement.

815
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,780
The thing that is illegal.

816
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:47,940
By definition, a settlement means an agreement to resolve the legal dispute by both parties

817
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:49,480
prior to trial.

818
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,780
No judge ruled on the case.

819
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:57,060
And by definition, like she keeps saying this too, by definition, like you sound like Ben

820
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:58,060
Shapiro.

821
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:01,380
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet ass fjord.

822
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:05,020
Well, by definition, copyright is the right to make copies.

823
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:07,020
Okay, now that is a fact.

824
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,420
It is right there in the word.

825
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,780
Copyright is the right to make copies.

826
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,260
It is easier to prove than plagiarism.

827
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:15,540
But if there was no plagiarism, it's right there in the word, then there was no copyright

828
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:18,260
infringement because copies were not made.

829
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:20,660
Is Ben Shapiro going to sue me now?

830
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:25,460
But she is wrong in that the settlement in the Oklahoma case is legally meaningless.

831
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:29,400
Most settlements are confidential, so we never know what the terms are.

832
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:34,720
So blushing admitting in a court document that the DMCA's were invalid actually does

833
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:40,400
give it some precedential effect over any future cases that might argue over these same

834
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,400
details.

835
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,560
So if only in a minor way, maybe blushing admitting that they were in the wrong to the

836
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,000
court is actually kind of a good thing.

837
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:54,800
Not a big win, but one minor precedent to defend against DMCA abuse.

838
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,800
Go team.

839
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:00,920
But the most batshit, unhinged from reality claim that she makes in this whole thing is

840
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:06,520
in response to the question of why did you send DMCA takedowns for the third Myth of

841
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:11,660
Omega book, which at that time had not even come out yet, and therefore you could not

842
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:13,100
have read.

843
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:17,120
Because both my Alpha's Claim trilogy and Zoe Ellis's trilogy were meant to be read

844
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:22,700
as a whole, books one and two ending in a cliffhanger, therefore I believed that the

845
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:26,760
unpublished book was a derivative work.

846
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,120
I own trilogies now?

847
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:33,480
She then goes on to cast every other person involved but herself as the villain.

848
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:39,160
She's super mad about that New York Times article, and they were way nicer to her than

849
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:45,680
I was, and certainly nicer than the A-Lab podcast, which I definitely listened to and

850
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:53,200
found very helpful in establishing the timeline for this wacky, crazy shenanigans.

851
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:58,160
I'm not going to repeat some of the things they said, but the New York Times was way

852
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,920
nicer than they were, and certainly nicer than I was.

853
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:07,680
Interestingly, the same month the article ran, the NYT parted ways with at least one

854
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:12,900
editor who admitted an article was rushed into publication, that the editing process

855
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:18,980
was flawed, and shockingly, then admitted to not even reading the op-ed before it ran

856
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,120
online.

857
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:25,640
So she connects the integrity of the editor of Alexandra Alter, who wrote the original

858
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:33,960
New York Times article, to the op-ed editor who resigned after asking Tom Cotton to write

859
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,360
a pro-police brutality op-ed.

860
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:42,640
Like these two are even in the same department, implying that these two editors, who happen

861
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:47,960
to work for the same paper at the same time, are the same person.

862
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:52,200
Like this is the level of intellectual honesty we are dealing with here.

863
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:58,480
In fact, Zoe Ellis sat down with a journalist for the NYT, who rushed the story, failed

864
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:05,920
to cite sources, failed to remain unbiased, and misquoted both myself and the facts.

865
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:10,080
Oh my god, the article is the citation!

866
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:16,520
Like this isn't a blog, this isn't like a peer-reviewed journal entry, Addison.

867
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,240
Newspaper articles don't have footnotes.

868
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:24,600
Blushing Books, who totally threw themselves in front of the bus for Addison a year earlier,

869
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,680
is also the bad guy now.

870
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:31,640
During this experience, I learned that my former publisher, Blushing Books, had never

871
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:37,780
filed copyrights for any of my books, despite what I believe was a contractual responsibility

872
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:38,780
to do so.

873
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:39,780
What?

874
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:41,280
What do you mean you believe?

875
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,540
Like, read your freaking contract!

876
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:49,860
You can check if they violated their contractual obligation.

877
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:51,620
You can sue them.

878
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:57,980
And if they didn't ever say they were going to file your copyright for you, then you didn't

879
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:58,980
read your contract.

880
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:02,220
But that doesn't mean that Blushing is necessarily innocent here either.

881
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:06,680
The blog post reveals that Cain and Blushing had a big falling out during the Oklahoma

882
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:10,740
case in which she got the rights to distribute her book back.

883
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:16,780
And she very peddly shows an email between Blushing and another author showing that Blushing

884
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:21,940
basically had no clue what they were doing and understood nothing about copyright law

885
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:24,660
and what actually constitutes copyright infringement.

886
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:29,020
How many assholes we got on this ship anyhow?

887
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:30,020
Go!

888
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:34,900
Cain then goes after the Romance Writers of America and is very upset about the RWA protecting

889
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:35,900
Blushing.

890
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:39,580
Like, what are you talking about?

891
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:45,860
Blushing has been on notice as a, like, bad publisher by the RWA since 2019.

892
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:49,380
And here she is trying and failing to start shit with another, much more famous romance

893
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:55,140
novelist who had earlier opined on the case and incidentally is a lawyer herself.

894
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:58,620
Everyone is enemy mine and I am the wronged one.

895
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:02,060
Like, maybe you're the problem Taylor Swift.

896
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:03,060
Oof.

897
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:05,060
Internet was a mistake.

898
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:11,780
So she's trying really hard to frame this as an I was right all along and this is a

899
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:15,820
win for authors and I'm helping you actually.

900
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:21,740
When in reality, after the details of her involvement and malice and subsequent perjury

901
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:28,020
were revealed to the court in the Oklahoma case, her publisher settled because their

902
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:33,020
author perjured herself and Cain got to walk away with effectively no consequences from

903
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:39,620
that while the other lawsuit against her in another state fizzled and died for completely

904
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:43,140
unrelated reasons.

905
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:46,420
And that is how it ends.

906
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,420
That was pointless.

907
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:54,620
I don't know if you could see what I was doing there.

908
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:56,620
It was like a visual joke.

909
00:59:56,620 --> 01:00:02,220
Alpha, beta, omega.

910
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:06,260
Do you think a depressed person could make this?

911
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:07,420
No.

912
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:12,820
So if you were reading this as an invitation to go harass this woman, first of all, what

913
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:16,100
the hell is wrong with you and also why are you even watching my channel?

914
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:17,500
Second, don't.

915
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:20,620
But this is less a cautionary tale of one vindictive author.

916
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:24,660
The New York Times article claims that it raises a deep legal question, but it isn't

917
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:27,700
really a deep legal question about who owns ideas.

918
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:33,860
If there is a deep legal question, it is how can people without the resources of giants

919
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:38,020
like YouTube protect themselves from bad faith DMCA claims?

920
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:44,500
DMCA counterclaims do exist as a barrier and Zoe Ellis did use them, but clearly that wasn't

921
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:49,340
enough because Cain and Blushing steamrolled right through them and kept issuing takedowns

922
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:50,340
for months.

923
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:55,420
A lot of the focus on this case was on the weird fanfic subculture and not the fact that

924
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:59,820
cases like this can and often do set important legal precedents.

925
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:04,420
To me, this is less about a too horny on main train wreck as much as it is a good example

926
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:11,380
of how laws designed to protect giant corporations are written in presumed good faith and assume

927
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:14,220
that everyone is going to play by the rules.

928
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:17,940
I tried to protect authors.

929
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:26,300
Well, as a fellow USA Today best-selling author who writes extremely niche trash involving

930
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:32,940
questionable use of non-human anatomies, I cannot say I feel protected by this.

931
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:37,460
If she had won this thing, which she didn't, that would have meant, despite her claims

932
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:42,740
to the contrary, that you can actually own genre tropes, which would make creating that

933
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:47,660
much more difficult and give bad faith actors that much more arsenal to attack their fellow

934
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:48,660
artists.

935
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:53,100
And in cases like these, we do kind of need to say something when bad faith actors try

936
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:58,340
to use this sort of thing to their advantage and might inadvertently strengthen already

937
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:03,980
draconian copyright law pushed by the likes of the Walt Disney Company and all for your

938
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:06,180
petty vindictive bullshit.

939
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:09,380
So this this attitude is bad.

940
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:10,380
Don't do it.

941
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:11,380
You can't own tropes.

942
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:15,380
I've learned you can do anything you want as long as you put your mind to it.

943
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:18,340
But I've also learned that reading is bad.

944
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:20,720
So we did have a lot of help writing this.

945
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:26,900
I learned a lot about reading court documents and me and Angelina had to read a lot of torture

946
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:27,900
porn.

947
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:30,680
I mean that in the most literal sense.

948
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,540
Porn with torture.

949
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,720
Literal torture porn.

950
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:36,340
It's like snuff for her.

951
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:41,300
Thanks especially to Stacy Lantane of the University of Mississippi School of Law and

952
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:45,140
Catherine Trindacosta with the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

953
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:50,740
The EFF is the leading nonprofit defending digital privacy and free speech and a portion

954
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:54,660
of the profits of this video are going to be donated to the EFF.

955
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:59,100
Take care, you beautiful people, and remember to wear a mask in public.

956
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:06,020
And if this video mysteriously disappears for, I don't know, some reason, I guess we'll

957
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:07,020
see you in court.

958
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:16,140
Bye.

959
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:17,140
Bye.

960
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:17,140


961
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:16,140
Bye.
