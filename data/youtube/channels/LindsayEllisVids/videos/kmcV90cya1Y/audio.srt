1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This is Loose Canon, where we examine different versions of the same character in various pop-culture iterations.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So, last time we started with a character that is very linearly owned by a single, carefully controlled corporate entity, and not very old.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I put the second episode up to a vote, and here were your three choices.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And you went with the obvious one.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So, Hades, the Greek god of the dead.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
They want to name me Pluto? What kind of name is that?

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Pluto, that's a name for a god? What is that? I wouldn't name my dog Pluto.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Why Hades of all the Greek gods? Well, first off, he's one of the most common in pop-culture adaptations,

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
but he also often has the most liberties taken.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If you took a middle school English class in the Western world, you probably have at least a passing knowledge of Greek mythology,

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
but let's run through a quick refresher where Mr. Hades is concerned.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Okay, so, the three lord god patriarchs of the Greek pantheon are the Brothers Three, Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Zeus rules the heaven and the earth, Poseidon the sea, and Hades the underworld and the dead people.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Now, Zeus and Poseidon are massive pricks. Hades, by comparison, is the nice one.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Aside from the occasional kidnapping, he mostly keeps to himself.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
In the mythology, his role was usually the bearer of some kind of quest object or dead love interest of the hero.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
His name, Hades, also became synonymous with the underworld itself.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So, it's like if my apartment was called Lindsay.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hi, I'm Lindsay. Welcome to Lindsay.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The most famous story of Hades from the mythology,

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
hell, one of the most famous stories from Greek mythology, period, is the abduction of Persephone.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
In the Homeric version, he makes a deal with Brother Zeus for him to abduct Zeus' daughter and his niece, Persephone.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
They're gods, so that makes it okay.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Persephone's mother, Demeter, is the goddess of harvest and fertility,

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and basically goes on a strike and blights the earth until Hades gives her her daughter back,

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
which he does, but only after she eats the fruit of the underworld,

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
which, for some reason, means she has to spend half the year in the underworld,

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
during which time Demeter gets sad, and that's why we have winter.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So, yeah, kidnapping a young girl and forcing her to marry you is kind of a dick thing to do,

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
but, again, compared to his bros, he's still less shitty.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So, yes, there is our mythological Hades crash course.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But since he's been around for so long, he has had a good thousand or so years

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
to incorporate a lot of fanon that later made its way into pop culture portrayals.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You know, fanon.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's, like, ideas that get accepted by fans based on conjecture or nothing,

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and sometimes even gets incorporated into the thing itself.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Stuff like Irene Adler being this big, important thing in Sherlock's life,

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
or where the Klingon head bumps came from,

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
or the fact that Starscream's repaint models are called Seekers,

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
or basically every My Little Pony meme.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So while Hades is far from the only Greek god to show up in pop culture a lot,

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
his portrayal over the years is among the most fanon-influenced, we'll say.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So today we're going to look at how Hades,

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
at one point revered as one of the most powerful of the gods,

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
got fanoned.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
INTRO

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So, let's get started with one of my favorites, the Disney version.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What, what Disney version did you think I was talking about?

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
MAIDENS, I'VE CHOSEN YOU TO BE QUEEN OF MY KINGDOM!

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
KINGDOM!

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So here, in the adolescence of both film and animation as medium,

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
we have our fabulous Red Ribber Pants opera singing Hades.

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This one has some more obvious influences than the Greek god himself.

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Could it be...

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Satan?

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Well, yes, church lady, but some perhaps less obvious than that.

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The satanified version of Hades is highly influenced by a Greek god,

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
just not the one for which he is named.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
In this case, we're talking about Pan.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The little horns, the pointy goatee, these are elements associated with Pan,

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
whose aesthetic later got rolled up into Christian artistic depictions of Satan.

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But a solid popularization for this look comes from Mephistopheles,

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
who is not Satan, but close enough.

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
One look need no further than Gounod's Faust,

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
by which this cartoon is probably more heavily influenced than by anything.

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The god Hades also isn't really associated with fire, like he is here.

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He is associated with wealth, metals, minerals, precious gems,

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
which we kind of see here.

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I guess this counts.

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I already did an episode about the goddess of spring a couple years ago,

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
so we won't go into too much depth on this one other than besides the aesthetic influences.

72
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's pretty much a strangely demeanor-less version of the abduction of Persephone by way of Faust.

73
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So, minus one eating the fruit of the underworld,

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
plus one Satan Hades lets her go because she asks.

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Quite reasonable of you, Satan Hades.

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Next.

77
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And when CGI just wasn't there yet.

78
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It was the mid-90s, and there was a big resurgence of interest in the whole Greek thing.

79
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Hades was a recurring character on Hercules the Legendary Journeys

80
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and its vastly superior spinoff, Xeno Warrior Princess.

81
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
There's an episode of Hercules the Legendary Journeys that takes on the Persephone story

82
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and actually does feature both Persephone and Demeter.

83
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So it starts out familiar enough.

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Hades pops out of the underworld and...

85
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Hades, your hat is ridiculous!

86
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Took Persephone, but why?

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Because he hates me.

88
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay...

89
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You know I can't eat the food of the other side. I'll be stuck here forever.

90
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Would that be so bad?

91
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Nope, turns out Demeter was wrong and this was actually a semi-consensual kidnapping.

92
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That was a pretty wild chariot ride.

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Stupid, sexy Hades.

94
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Why does it have to be like this?

95
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Stupid, irresistible, sexy Hades.

96
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Hades, don't be a voyeur.

97
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What the? Ew. Why?

98
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
No, never mind, this is not stupid, sexy Hades.

99
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Oh, but don't worry, he's in Xena too.

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I feel like at some point this actor saw and really liked James Wood's interpretation of Hades from the Disney movie.

101
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Where is she?

102
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Gabrielle, well, if she's dead, she didn't come to me.

103
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I saw her die, she had to come to you.

104
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Why would I lie to you?

105
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Hey, come on, Xena, babe, let's cut a deal.

106
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But towards the end of the series, Xena starts pulling a god of war

107
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
and starts killing gods because she can and because motherhood.

108
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
No, seriously, the name of this episode is Motherhood.

109
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
If we wish to kill Eve, we have to go through Xena.

110
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And as a mother, she'll be more dangerous than ever.

111
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Oh, but it gets better.

112
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Here's why we're killing off gods.

113
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It was sent by the archangel Michael.

114
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Michael?

115
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He said that Eve would prepare the way for the rule of the god of love.

116
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yeah, yep.

117
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Bye, Hades.

118
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
No!

119
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Well, shit, now who's gonna run the underworld?

120
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Next.

121
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
My boy, my little Hercules.

122
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
How sentimental.

123
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You know, I haven't been this choked up since I got a hunk of moussaka caught in my throat.

124
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Huh?

125
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So, while John Musker and Ron Clements were developing the studio mandate of a film,

126
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
they arbitrarily decided that Hades was going to be the villain in the story

127
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
because death equals scary,

128
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
despite Hercules rarely interacting with the Lord of the Dead in the mythology

129
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and certainly never in an arch-nemesis sort of way.

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So, despite Hades as your villain making no sense in a Hercules story,

131
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
because that's usually Hera, who is his doting mother in this movie,

132
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Hades is our antagonist because he wants to be in charge of Olympus,

133
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
and originally he was going to be like this dark, slow-moving, broody, like Chernaboggy type.

134
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And then James Woods showed up.

135
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
For some weird reason, I came in and he was Hades, the Lord of the Underworld,

136
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and I guess everybody came in going,

137
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I guess everybody came in going,

138
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Hello, I'm Hades!

139
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And I came in going,

140
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Hey, Hades, how you doing? Nice to see a nice face.

141
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
For some reason, I just was feeling kind of silly that day.

142
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And his version of Hades manifests as this sort of huckster, used car salesman type,

143
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
and the subsequent interpretation of this character,

144
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
while yes, I know, not accurate,

145
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
is still honestly way too good for this movie.

146
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
People are going to get hurt, aren't they?

147
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Nah, I mean, you know, it's a possibility.

148
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It happens, you know, it's war, but what can I tell you?

149
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
As a character, this version of Hades is great,

150
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
but as a plot device, he was not very strong.

151
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm about to rearrange the cosmos.

152
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So all that is good about the character is pretty much directly attributable

153
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
to Woods and lead animator Nick Ranieri.

154
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Anyway, see, ladies, I was at this party and I lost track of you.

155
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I know you know.

156
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And this, in large part, and by Woods' own admission,

157
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
is because almost every line he does in the film is ad-libbed.

158
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Meg, Meg, talk to him, smooth.

159
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Get away from me.

160
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Speaking of hell, yes, did I mention that this had an animated series spin-off?

161
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yeah, and we're not employees, we're cast members.

162
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh.

163
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Which you cannot find anywhere unless you're, like,

164
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
bit torrenting or watching it on YouTube.

165
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And it's funny that in 50-plus episodes, Persephone never shows up.

166
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But she is in the movie.

167
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Right there.

168
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This Sarah Brightman-looking motherfucker.

169
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And aside from Danny DeVito and Rip Torn,

170
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
it features the entirely the same voice cast, including James Woods,

171
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
who loves being Hades and does it at every opportunity,

172
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
which is not enough.

173
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It is never enough.

174
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Everyone goes to orientation on their first day.

175
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Orientation?

176
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I run a professional organization.

177
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The animated series takes place basically during the

178
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Danny DeVito training montage in the movie.

179
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And yes, in the animated series, Hades is well aware

180
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
that Hercules is alive and not dead,

181
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and no, this is never addressed as a continuity issue.

182
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It just is.

183
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
In the show, Hades' bid to take over Olympus appears to be a constant thing

184
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
rather than a ticking clock.

185
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Well, ticking planet.

186
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Driven push that only Hercules is prophesied to stop.

187
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
No Persephone, but Hades does have a crush on Aphrodite, which is great.

188
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And she is great because she has her own theme song.

189
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
There are a lot of great moments in this show,

190
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
unlike the animation, which is not great at all.

191
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's terrible.

192
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
He even has a song in one episode.

193
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'd like you to see.

194
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Okay, yeah, this is why Hades has no villain song in the movie.

195
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
In my town.

196
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
In his town.

197
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm number one.

198
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Not in my book you ain't.

199
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Though one of the best episodes is the one where Hades teams up with Jafar.

200
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Apparently, Hercules happens more or less at the same time as Aladdin.

201
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
One's the most powerful sorcerer in the world.

202
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Good for you, you big scary booger head, you.

203
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It features such gems as Hades and Jafar bonding over their respective adolescent nemeses.

204
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Giving each other villainy advice.

205
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And then they stage like a Wolverine versus Hulk comic book battle between Hercules and Aladdin.

206
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Aladdin and Hercules would have some sort of terrible misunderstanding.

207
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And then, of course, they team up.

208
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Okay, don't panic. Heroes burst in all the time down here.

209
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I could go on and on about this show because there are a lot of episodes.

210
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And because there are a lot of episodes, there are definitely some that drag.

211
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
But I definitely prefer the show to the movie.

212
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Except the animation.

213
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You idiots!

214
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What is that, cherry? Give me a taste of that.

215
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Mmm, nice.

216
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Disney Hades.

217
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You can find a more accurate Hades, but you will be loathe to find a more fun one.

218
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Uh, guys.

219
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Olympus would be that way.

220
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Next.

221
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Free at last.

222
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Man, I'd feel bad for any Hades that follows James Woods, but this guy is among the lamest.

223
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Which is a shame, because it's John Rhys-Davies, and he's cool.

224
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Hades from Justice League and Justice League Unlimited.

225
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
In case you ever wondered what would happen if Mephistopheles was crossed with Fabio.

226
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And also this.

227
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You know, let's dig a little deeper with the whole Satan thing.

228
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Of all the underworld gods that were pre-Christian, why did the Satan thing stick to Hades the most?

229
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Now you see his true face.

230
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I mean, Osiris is another well-known god of the dead, and he doesn't have the Satan connotation.

231
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So, why Hades?

232
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
At its core, it really is a translation issue.

233
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:06,000
The Bible, written in Hebrew, used the word this to refer to the abode of the dead.

234
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
In practice, this is divorced from the Greek idea of Hades.

235
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,000
But, when it was translated into ancient Greek, this word is translated to this word, meaning Hades.

236
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And remember, God's name, same as the place.

237
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Welcome to Lindsay.

238
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,000
All of this would eventually be wrapped up into this unified idea of the Christian hell through a series of translations.

239
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The modern English word Hades popped up around when the modern English did.

240
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And specifically to refer to the place where Jesus went after the crucifixion.

241
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,000
In the King James Version, the Greek word Hades is translated into hell, death, and, well, Hades,

242
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
depending on which verse we're talking about and which book we're talking about.

243
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Despite a resurgence in interest in classical mythology around the Enlightenment era that has lasted all the way up to, well, now,

244
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I think we can safely say now this conflation of Bible Hades the place and God Hades the guy has more or less stuck.

245
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Anyway, Justice League, this version was always kind of the exemplar for lame, lazy devil Hades.

246
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And once again, he's trying to overthrow Zeus because reasons.

247
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And also...

248
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Tormenting Faust's pathetic soul.

249
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You've got to be f***ing kidding me.

250
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So, Hades intends to give Olympus to the Titans.

251
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Hades tricked my mother into opening the gates of Olympus to the invading Titans.

252
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Where we heard this before.

253
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And Hippolyta had a thing with him at one point, and he is possibly Diana's maybe dad.

254
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
My mother sculpted me from clay and breathed life into me.

255
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Your mother and I sculpted you together.

256
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
He's gone?

257
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
What did you ever see in him?

258
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Well, did you see his tongue?

259
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Just think, this is the kind of boring bad guy the Disney version would have been

260
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
if James Woods hadn't made one of the best decisions of his or anyone's career.

261
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Bow to me, mortals!

262
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Next.

263
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You are here for a favor.

264
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I am.

265
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Perhaps then you can enlighten me as to why you think I would remove your bands.

266
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Hmm...

267
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Hades, you look different.

268
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Where are my manners?

269
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
This version's aesthetic is such an outlier, I'm not really sure what to say about it.

270
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
But obviously, more than anything, it looks like Bacchus than Hades.

271
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So obviously this version does not fall in the same continuity with Justice League.

272
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And believe it or not, Hades, who is voiced by and appears to be modeled on Oliver Platt,

273
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
is not the central antagonist, but Ares.

274
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Weirdly voiced by Alfred Molina.

275
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I shall never be able to repay your gesture.

276
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You know, Doc Ock.

277
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Hades here is basically just a glorified cameo.

278
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And, well, points for different.

279
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Next.

280
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
We have visitors.

281
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Nephew?

282
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So now we make it to the film version of Percy Jackson and the Sorcerer's Stone.

283
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I mean, The Lightning Thief.

284
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
God, this movie.

285
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Would you prefer that I looked like this?

286
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
This interpretation being sort of aging rock star,

287
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
and accompanied by an extremely bitter and confusing Persephone,

288
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
who is played by Rosario Dawson.

289
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Don't ignore me.

290
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Or what?

291
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What will you do?

292
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Uh, you know, okay.

293
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Hades almost does the I'm going to take over Olympus thing.

294
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I am going to be king of the gods.

295
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
But then...

296
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
No!

297
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What, huh?

298
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
The only thing I look forward to is my allotted time away from this hellhole.

299
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
A war of the gods would put an end to that.

300
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And I'd be alone with only him.

301
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Okay.

302
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Like I said, glorified cameo.

303
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Next.

304
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You are specks of dust beneath our fingernails.

305
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Your very breath is a gift from Olympus.

306
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You have insulted powers beyond your comprehension.

307
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Who are you?

308
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I am Hades.

309
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Ah, we saved the very worst for last.

310
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So, unlike the 1981 film for which this remake is presumably named,

311
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
in which the antagonist was mostly Poseidon,

312
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
which makes sense, seeing as Poseidon is a god of the sea,

313
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
and Kraken is a sea beast.

314
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And from his own flesh, Hades gave birth to an unspeakable horror,

315
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
the Kraken.

316
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Here, Hades is played by Ralph Fiennes

317
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
as a sort of Voldemort by way of Turtle from Battlefield Earth.

318
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I will unleash the Kraken.

319
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Aw, are you going to give Draco an awkward hug now?

320
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
This version of Hades is also a touch derivative.

321
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Finally, some rage from you.

322
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
How long has it been, brother?

323
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Where have we seen this before?

324
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
How sentimental.

325
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It also basically has the same ending as the Disney movie.

326
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I've been a little blind.

327
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
No!

328
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Hades is banished, inconvenienced.

329
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's not clear, but it does involve being thrown down a hole.

330
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
He's in the sequel too, but he's less bad in that one.

331
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I don't know. Moving on.

332
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Release the Kraken.

333
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The interesting contrast with Hades, the character, the idea, whatever,

334
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
is how much changes from iteration to iteration

335
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
while at the same time still being borrowed.

336
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
That Satan-y undertone that keeps popping up, for instance,

337
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
despite the fact that it's never really there in the mythology.

338
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Or even up to the fact that after the Disney movie came out,

339
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
pop culture Hades-es just kept wanting to take over Olympus.

340
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
There is no official Hades handbook,

341
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
but those intertwined influences are still there.

342
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And I think the older your character is,

343
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
the more of that you're going to see,

344
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
even if people do get sort of butthurt about it being inaccurate.

345
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Which, let me remind you, is not a barometer for enjoyability.

346
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Again, this one was among the least accurate.

347
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
This one is different. He's honest and he's sweet.

348
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Please. He would never do anything to hurt me.

349
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
He's a guy.

350
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Next loose cannon, which I promise I'll do sooner than in three months,

351
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
we're going to do a lady,

352
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
based on these suggestions that I got on Twitter

353
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
slash the ones I was actually interested in doing.

354
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Here are your three options.

355
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You can find the link to vote below,

356
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
which is on my website, shayapocalypse.com,

357
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
and if you want to give me suggestions slash talk about it,

358
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
follow me on Twitter.

359
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And we will see you next time.
