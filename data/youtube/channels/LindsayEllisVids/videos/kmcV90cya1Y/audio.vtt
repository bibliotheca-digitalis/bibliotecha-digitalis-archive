WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
This is Loose Canon, where we examine different versions of the same character in various pop-culture iterations.

00:09.000 --> 00:18.000
So, last time we started with a character that is very linearly owned by a single, carefully controlled corporate entity, and not very old.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
I put the second episode up to a vote, and here were your three choices.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
And you went with the obvious one.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
So, Hades, the Greek god of the dead.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
They want to name me Pluto? What kind of name is that?

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
Pluto, that's a name for a god? What is that? I wouldn't name my dog Pluto.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
Why Hades of all the Greek gods? Well, first off, he's one of the most common in pop-culture adaptations,

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
but he also often has the most liberties taken.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
If you took a middle school English class in the Western world, you probably have at least a passing knowledge of Greek mythology,

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
but let's run through a quick refresher where Mr. Hades is concerned.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
Okay, so, the three lord god patriarchs of the Greek pantheon are the Brothers Three, Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.000
Zeus rules the heaven and the earth, Poseidon the sea, and Hades the underworld and the dead people.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.000
Now, Zeus and Poseidon are massive pricks. Hades, by comparison, is the nice one.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
Aside from the occasional kidnapping, he mostly keeps to himself.

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
In the mythology, his role was usually the bearer of some kind of quest object or dead love interest of the hero.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
His name, Hades, also became synonymous with the underworld itself.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
So, it's like if my apartment was called Lindsay.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
Hi, I'm Lindsay. Welcome to Lindsay.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
The most famous story of Hades from the mythology,

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
hell, one of the most famous stories from Greek mythology, period, is the abduction of Persephone.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
In the Homeric version, he makes a deal with Brother Zeus for him to abduct Zeus' daughter and his niece, Persephone.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
They're gods, so that makes it okay.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Persephone's mother, Demeter, is the goddess of harvest and fertility,

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
and basically goes on a strike and blights the earth until Hades gives her her daughter back,

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
which he does, but only after she eats the fruit of the underworld,

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
which, for some reason, means she has to spend half the year in the underworld,

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
during which time Demeter gets sad, and that's why we have winter.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.000
So, yeah, kidnapping a young girl and forcing her to marry you is kind of a dick thing to do,

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
but, again, compared to his bros, he's still less shitty.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
So, yes, there is our mythological Hades crash course.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
But since he's been around for so long, he has had a good thousand or so years

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
to incorporate a lot of fanon that later made its way into pop culture portrayals.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
You know, fanon.

02:50.000 --> 02:57.000
It's, like, ideas that get accepted by fans based on conjecture or nothing,

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
and sometimes even gets incorporated into the thing itself.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
Stuff like Irene Adler being this big, important thing in Sherlock's life,

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
or where the Klingon head bumps came from,

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
or the fact that Starscream's repaint models are called Seekers,

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
or basically every My Little Pony meme.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
So while Hades is far from the only Greek god to show up in pop culture a lot,

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
his portrayal over the years is among the most fanon-influenced, we'll say.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
So today we're going to look at how Hades,

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
at one point revered as one of the most powerful of the gods,

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
got fanoned.

03:36.000 --> 03:43.000
INTRO

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
So, let's get started with one of my favorites, the Disney version.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
What, what Disney version did you think I was talking about?

04:06.000 --> 04:13.000
MAIDENS, I'VE CHOSEN YOU TO BE QUEEN OF MY KINGDOM!

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
KINGDOM!

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
So here, in the adolescence of both film and animation as medium,

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
we have our fabulous Red Ribber Pants opera singing Hades.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
This one has some more obvious influences than the Greek god himself.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Could it be...

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Satan?

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
Well, yes, church lady, but some perhaps less obvious than that.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
The satanified version of Hades is highly influenced by a Greek god,

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
just not the one for which he is named.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
In this case, we're talking about Pan.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
The little horns, the pointy goatee, these are elements associated with Pan,

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
whose aesthetic later got rolled up into Christian artistic depictions of Satan.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
But a solid popularization for this look comes from Mephistopheles,

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
who is not Satan, but close enough.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
One look need no further than Gounod's Faust,

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
by which this cartoon is probably more heavily influenced than by anything.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
The god Hades also isn't really associated with fire, like he is here.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
He is associated with wealth, metals, minerals, precious gems,

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
which we kind of see here.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
I guess this counts.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
I already did an episode about the goddess of spring a couple years ago,

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
so we won't go into too much depth on this one other than besides the aesthetic influences.

05:32.000 --> 05:39.000
It's pretty much a strangely demeanor-less version of the abduction of Persephone by way of Faust.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
So, minus one eating the fruit of the underworld,

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
plus one Satan Hades lets her go because she asks.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Quite reasonable of you, Satan Hades.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Next.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
And when CGI just wasn't there yet.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
It was the mid-90s, and there was a big resurgence of interest in the whole Greek thing.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
Hades was a recurring character on Hercules the Legendary Journeys

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
and its vastly superior spinoff, Xeno Warrior Princess.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
There's an episode of Hercules the Legendary Journeys that takes on the Persephone story

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
and actually does feature both Persephone and Demeter.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
So it starts out familiar enough.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Hades pops out of the underworld and...

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Hades, your hat is ridiculous!

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Took Persephone, but why?

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Because he hates me.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Okay...

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
You know I can't eat the food of the other side. I'll be stuck here forever.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Would that be so bad?

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
Nope, turns out Demeter was wrong and this was actually a semi-consensual kidnapping.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
That was a pretty wild chariot ride.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Stupid, sexy Hades.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Why does it have to be like this?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Stupid, irresistible, sexy Hades.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Hades, don't be a voyeur.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
What the? Ew. Why?

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
No, never mind, this is not stupid, sexy Hades.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Oh, but don't worry, he's in Xena too.

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
I feel like at some point this actor saw and really liked James Wood's interpretation of Hades from the Disney movie.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Where is she?

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
Gabrielle, well, if she's dead, she didn't come to me.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
I saw her die, she had to come to you.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Why would I lie to you?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Hey, come on, Xena, babe, let's cut a deal.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
But towards the end of the series, Xena starts pulling a god of war

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
and starts killing gods because she can and because motherhood.

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
No, seriously, the name of this episode is Motherhood.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
If we wish to kill Eve, we have to go through Xena.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
And as a mother, she'll be more dangerous than ever.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Oh, but it gets better.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Here's why we're killing off gods.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
It was sent by the archangel Michael.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Michael?

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
He said that Eve would prepare the way for the rule of the god of love.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Yeah, yep.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Bye, Hades.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
No!

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Well, shit, now who's gonna run the underworld?

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Next.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
My boy, my little Hercules.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
How sentimental.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
You know, I haven't been this choked up since I got a hunk of moussaka caught in my throat.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Huh?

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
So, while John Musker and Ron Clements were developing the studio mandate of a film,

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
they arbitrarily decided that Hades was going to be the villain in the story

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
because death equals scary,

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
despite Hercules rarely interacting with the Lord of the Dead in the mythology

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
and certainly never in an arch-nemesis sort of way.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
So, despite Hades as your villain making no sense in a Hercules story,

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
because that's usually Hera, who is his doting mother in this movie,

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
Hades is our antagonist because he wants to be in charge of Olympus,

09:24.000 --> 09:31.000
and originally he was going to be like this dark, slow-moving, broody, like Chernaboggy type.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
And then James Woods showed up.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
For some weird reason, I came in and he was Hades, the Lord of the Underworld,

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
and I guess everybody came in going,

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
I guess everybody came in going,

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Hello, I'm Hades!

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
And I came in going,

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
Hey, Hades, how you doing? Nice to see a nice face.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
For some reason, I just was feeling kind of silly that day.

09:49.000 --> 09:55.000
And his version of Hades manifests as this sort of huckster, used car salesman type,

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
and the subsequent interpretation of this character,

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
while yes, I know, not accurate,

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
is still honestly way too good for this movie.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
People are going to get hurt, aren't they?

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Nah, I mean, you know, it's a possibility.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
It happens, you know, it's war, but what can I tell you?

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
As a character, this version of Hades is great,

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
but as a plot device, he was not very strong.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
I'm about to rearrange the cosmos.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
So all that is good about the character is pretty much directly attributable

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
to Woods and lead animator Nick Ranieri.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
Anyway, see, ladies, I was at this party and I lost track of you.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I know you know.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
And this, in large part, and by Woods' own admission,

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
is because almost every line he does in the film is ad-libbed.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Meg, Meg, talk to him, smooth.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Get away from me.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
Speaking of hell, yes, did I mention that this had an animated series spin-off?

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
Yeah, and we're not employees, we're cast members.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Oh.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
Which you cannot find anywhere unless you're, like,

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
bit torrenting or watching it on YouTube.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
And it's funny that in 50-plus episodes, Persephone never shows up.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
But she is in the movie.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Right there.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
This Sarah Brightman-looking motherfucker.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
And aside from Danny DeVito and Rip Torn,

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
it features the entirely the same voice cast, including James Woods,

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
who loves being Hades and does it at every opportunity,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
which is not enough.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
It is never enough.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
Everyone goes to orientation on their first day.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Orientation?

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
I run a professional organization.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
The animated series takes place basically during the

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Danny DeVito training montage in the movie.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
And yes, in the animated series, Hades is well aware

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
that Hercules is alive and not dead,

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
and no, this is never addressed as a continuity issue.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
It just is.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
In the show, Hades' bid to take over Olympus appears to be a constant thing

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
rather than a ticking clock.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Well, ticking planet.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
Driven push that only Hercules is prophesied to stop.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
No Persephone, but Hades does have a crush on Aphrodite, which is great.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
And she is great because she has her own theme song.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
There are a lot of great moments in this show,

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
unlike the animation, which is not great at all.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
It's terrible.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
He even has a song in one episode.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
I'd like you to see.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
Okay, yeah, this is why Hades has no villain song in the movie.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
In my town.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
In his town.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
I'm number one.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Not in my book you ain't.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
Though one of the best episodes is the one where Hades teams up with Jafar.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
Apparently, Hercules happens more or less at the same time as Aladdin.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
One's the most powerful sorcerer in the world.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
Good for you, you big scary booger head, you.

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
It features such gems as Hades and Jafar bonding over their respective adolescent nemeses.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Giving each other villainy advice.

13:16.000 --> 13:22.000
And then they stage like a Wolverine versus Hulk comic book battle between Hercules and Aladdin.

13:23.000 --> 13:28.000
Aladdin and Hercules would have some sort of terrible misunderstanding.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
And then, of course, they team up.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
Okay, don't panic. Heroes burst in all the time down here.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
I could go on and on about this show because there are a lot of episodes.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
And because there are a lot of episodes, there are definitely some that drag.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
But I definitely prefer the show to the movie.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Except the animation.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
You idiots!

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
What is that, cherry? Give me a taste of that.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Mmm, nice.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Disney Hades.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
You can find a more accurate Hades, but you will be loathe to find a more fun one.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Uh, guys.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Olympus would be that way.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Next.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Free at last.

14:12.000 --> 14:18.000
Man, I'd feel bad for any Hades that follows James Woods, but this guy is among the lamest.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
Which is a shame, because it's John Rhys-Davies, and he's cool.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
Hades from Justice League and Justice League Unlimited.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
In case you ever wondered what would happen if Mephistopheles was crossed with Fabio.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
And also this.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
You know, let's dig a little deeper with the whole Satan thing.

14:40.000 --> 14:47.000
Of all the underworld gods that were pre-Christian, why did the Satan thing stick to Hades the most?

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Now you see his true face.

14:49.000 --> 14:54.000
I mean, Osiris is another well-known god of the dead, and he doesn't have the Satan connotation.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
So, why Hades?

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
At its core, it really is a translation issue.

14:59.000 --> 15:06.000
The Bible, written in Hebrew, used the word this to refer to the abode of the dead.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
In practice, this is divorced from the Greek idea of Hades.

15:10.000 --> 15:17.000
But, when it was translated into ancient Greek, this word is translated to this word, meaning Hades.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
And remember, God's name, same as the place.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Welcome to Lindsay.

15:22.000 --> 15:29.000
All of this would eventually be wrapped up into this unified idea of the Christian hell through a series of translations.

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
The modern English word Hades popped up around when the modern English did.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
And specifically to refer to the place where Jesus went after the crucifixion.

15:38.000 --> 15:45.000
In the King James Version, the Greek word Hades is translated into hell, death, and, well, Hades,

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
depending on which verse we're talking about and which book we're talking about.

15:48.000 --> 15:55.000
Despite a resurgence in interest in classical mythology around the Enlightenment era that has lasted all the way up to, well, now,

15:55.000 --> 16:04.000
I think we can safely say now this conflation of Bible Hades the place and God Hades the guy has more or less stuck.

16:05.000 --> 16:11.000
Anyway, Justice League, this version was always kind of the exemplar for lame, lazy devil Hades.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
And once again, he's trying to overthrow Zeus because reasons.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
And also...

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
Tormenting Faust's pathetic soul.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
You've got to be f***ing kidding me.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
So, Hades intends to give Olympus to the Titans.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
Hades tricked my mother into opening the gates of Olympus to the invading Titans.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Where we heard this before.

16:32.000 --> 16:37.000
And Hippolyta had a thing with him at one point, and he is possibly Diana's maybe dad.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
My mother sculpted me from clay and breathed life into me.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
Your mother and I sculpted you together.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
He's gone?

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
What did you ever see in him?

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Well, did you see his tongue?

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
Just think, this is the kind of boring bad guy the Disney version would have been

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
if James Woods hadn't made one of the best decisions of his or anyone's career.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Bow to me, mortals!

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Next.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
You are here for a favor.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
I am.

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
Perhaps then you can enlighten me as to why you think I would remove your bands.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Hmm...

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Hades, you look different.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Where are my manners?

17:20.000 --> 17:26.000
This version's aesthetic is such an outlier, I'm not really sure what to say about it.

17:26.000 --> 17:31.000
But obviously, more than anything, it looks like Bacchus than Hades.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
So obviously this version does not fall in the same continuity with Justice League.

17:35.000 --> 17:40.000
And believe it or not, Hades, who is voiced by and appears to be modeled on Oliver Platt,

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
is not the central antagonist, but Ares.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
Weirdly voiced by Alfred Molina.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
I shall never be able to repay your gesture.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
You know, Doc Ock.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
Hades here is basically just a glorified cameo.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
And, well, points for different.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Next.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
We have visitors.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Nephew?

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
So now we make it to the film version of Percy Jackson and the Sorcerer's Stone.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
I mean, The Lightning Thief.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
God, this movie.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
Would you prefer that I looked like this?

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
This interpretation being sort of aging rock star,

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
and accompanied by an extremely bitter and confusing Persephone,

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
who is played by Rosario Dawson.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Don't ignore me.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Or what?

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
What will you do?

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
Uh, you know, okay.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
Hades almost does the I'm going to take over Olympus thing.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
I am going to be king of the gods.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
But then...

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
No!

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
What, huh?

18:51.000 --> 18:56.000
The only thing I look forward to is my allotted time away from this hellhole.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
A war of the gods would put an end to that.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
And I'd be alone with only him.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Okay.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Like I said, glorified cameo.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Next.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
You are specks of dust beneath our fingernails.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
Your very breath is a gift from Olympus.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
You have insulted powers beyond your comprehension.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Who are you?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
I am Hades.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
Ah, we saved the very worst for last.

19:32.000 --> 19:37.000
So, unlike the 1981 film for which this remake is presumably named,

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
in which the antagonist was mostly Poseidon,

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
which makes sense, seeing as Poseidon is a god of the sea,

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
and Kraken is a sea beast.

19:46.000 --> 19:52.000
And from his own flesh, Hades gave birth to an unspeakable horror,

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
the Kraken.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Here, Hades is played by Ralph Fiennes

19:58.000 --> 20:03.000
as a sort of Voldemort by way of Turtle from Battlefield Earth.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
I will unleash the Kraken.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
Aw, are you going to give Draco an awkward hug now?

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
This version of Hades is also a touch derivative.

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
Finally, some rage from you.

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
How long has it been, brother?

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Where have we seen this before?

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
How sentimental.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
It also basically has the same ending as the Disney movie.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
I've been a little blind.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
No!

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
Hades is banished, inconvenienced.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
It's not clear, but it does involve being thrown down a hole.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
He's in the sequel too, but he's less bad in that one.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
I don't know. Moving on.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Release the Kraken.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
The interesting contrast with Hades, the character, the idea, whatever,

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
is how much changes from iteration to iteration

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
while at the same time still being borrowed.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
That Satan-y undertone that keeps popping up, for instance,

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
despite the fact that it's never really there in the mythology.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
Or even up to the fact that after the Disney movie came out,

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
pop culture Hades-es just kept wanting to take over Olympus.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
There is no official Hades handbook,

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
but those intertwined influences are still there.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
And I think the older your character is,

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
the more of that you're going to see,

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
even if people do get sort of butthurt about it being inaccurate.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
Which, let me remind you, is not a barometer for enjoyability.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
Again, this one was among the least accurate.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
This one is different. He's honest and he's sweet.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Please. He would never do anything to hurt me.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
He's a guy.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
Next loose cannon, which I promise I'll do sooner than in three months,

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
we're going to do a lady,

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
based on these suggestions that I got on Twitter

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
slash the ones I was actually interested in doing.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Here are your three options.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
You can find the link to vote below,

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
which is on my website, shayapocalypse.com,

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
and if you want to give me suggestions slash talk about it,

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
follow me on Twitter.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
And we will see you next time.
