0	8000	This is Loose Canon, where we examine different versions of the same character in various pop-culture iterations.
9000	18000	So, last time we started with a character that is very linearly owned by a single, carefully controlled corporate entity, and not very old.
18000	23000	I put the second episode up to a vote, and here were your three choices.
24000	27000	And you went with the obvious one.
27000	31000	So, Hades, the Greek god of the dead.
31000	35000	They want to name me Pluto? What kind of name is that?
35000	40000	Pluto, that's a name for a god? What is that? I wouldn't name my dog Pluto.
40000	46000	Why Hades of all the Greek gods? Well, first off, he's one of the most common in pop-culture adaptations,
46000	51000	but he also often has the most liberties taken.
52000	58000	If you took a middle school English class in the Western world, you probably have at least a passing knowledge of Greek mythology,
58000	63000	but let's run through a quick refresher where Mr. Hades is concerned.
67000	73000	Okay, so, the three lord god patriarchs of the Greek pantheon are the Brothers Three, Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades.
73000	79000	Zeus rules the heaven and the earth, Poseidon the sea, and Hades the underworld and the dead people.
79000	85000	Now, Zeus and Poseidon are massive pricks. Hades, by comparison, is the nice one.
85000	89000	Aside from the occasional kidnapping, he mostly keeps to himself.
89000	96000	In the mythology, his role was usually the bearer of some kind of quest object or dead love interest of the hero.
96000	100000	His name, Hades, also became synonymous with the underworld itself.
100000	104000	So, it's like if my apartment was called Lindsay.
105000	108000	Hi, I'm Lindsay. Welcome to Lindsay.
108000	110000	The most famous story of Hades from the mythology,
110000	116000	hell, one of the most famous stories from Greek mythology, period, is the abduction of Persephone.
116000	122000	In the Homeric version, he makes a deal with Brother Zeus for him to abduct Zeus' daughter and his niece, Persephone.
122000	124000	They're gods, so that makes it okay.
124000	127000	Persephone's mother, Demeter, is the goddess of harvest and fertility,
127000	132000	and basically goes on a strike and blights the earth until Hades gives her her daughter back,
132000	135000	which he does, but only after she eats the fruit of the underworld,
135000	139000	which, for some reason, means she has to spend half the year in the underworld,
139000	143000	during which time Demeter gets sad, and that's why we have winter.
143000	149000	So, yeah, kidnapping a young girl and forcing her to marry you is kind of a dick thing to do,
149000	155000	but, again, compared to his bros, he's still less shitty.
155000	158000	So, yes, there is our mythological Hades crash course.
158000	162000	But since he's been around for so long, he has had a good thousand or so years
162000	168000	to incorporate a lot of fanon that later made its way into pop culture portrayals.
168000	170000	You know, fanon.
170000	177000	It's, like, ideas that get accepted by fans based on conjecture or nothing,
177000	181000	and sometimes even gets incorporated into the thing itself.
181000	186000	Stuff like Irene Adler being this big, important thing in Sherlock's life,
186000	189000	or where the Klingon head bumps came from,
189000	193000	or the fact that Starscream's repaint models are called Seekers,
193000	195000	or basically every My Little Pony meme.
195000	200000	So while Hades is far from the only Greek god to show up in pop culture a lot,
200000	206000	his portrayal over the years is among the most fanon-influenced, we'll say.
208000	210000	So today we're going to look at how Hades,
210000	213000	at one point revered as one of the most powerful of the gods,
213000	215000	got fanoned.
216000	223000	INTRO
226000	230000	So, let's get started with one of my favorites, the Disney version.
239000	243000	What, what Disney version did you think I was talking about?
246000	253000	MAIDENS, I'VE CHOSEN YOU TO BE QUEEN OF MY KINGDOM!
253000	256000	KINGDOM!
256000	259000	So here, in the adolescence of both film and animation as medium,
259000	262000	we have our fabulous Red Ribber Pants opera singing Hades.
262000	267000	This one has some more obvious influences than the Greek god himself.
267000	269000	Could it be...
269000	270000	Satan?
270000	274000	Well, yes, church lady, but some perhaps less obvious than that.
274000	278000	The satanified version of Hades is highly influenced by a Greek god,
278000	280000	just not the one for which he is named.
280000	282000	In this case, we're talking about Pan.
282000	286000	The little horns, the pointy goatee, these are elements associated with Pan,
286000	290000	whose aesthetic later got rolled up into Christian artistic depictions of Satan.
290000	294000	But a solid popularization for this look comes from Mephistopheles,
294000	297000	who is not Satan, but close enough.
297000	300000	One look need no further than Gounod's Faust,
300000	304000	by which this cartoon is probably more heavily influenced than by anything.
304000	308000	The god Hades also isn't really associated with fire, like he is here.
308000	312000	He is associated with wealth, metals, minerals, precious gems,
312000	314000	which we kind of see here.
323000	325000	I guess this counts.
325000	328000	I already did an episode about the goddess of spring a couple years ago,
328000	332000	so we won't go into too much depth on this one other than besides the aesthetic influences.
332000	339000	It's pretty much a strangely demeanor-less version of the abduction of Persephone by way of Faust.
339000	342000	So, minus one eating the fruit of the underworld,
342000	346000	plus one Satan Hades lets her go because she asks.
358000	360000	Quite reasonable of you, Satan Hades.
360000	361000	Next.
369000	373000	And when CGI just wasn't there yet.
373000	378000	It was the mid-90s, and there was a big resurgence of interest in the whole Greek thing.
378000	382000	Hades was a recurring character on Hercules the Legendary Journeys
382000	386000	and its vastly superior spinoff, Xeno Warrior Princess.
386000	390000	There's an episode of Hercules the Legendary Journeys that takes on the Persephone story
390000	394000	and actually does feature both Persephone and Demeter.
396000	398000	So it starts out familiar enough.
398000	400000	Hades pops out of the underworld and...
403000	406000	Hades, your hat is ridiculous!
412000	414000	Took Persephone, but why?
414000	416000	Because he hates me.
416000	418000	Okay...
418000	422000	You know I can't eat the food of the other side. I'll be stuck here forever.
422000	424000	Would that be so bad?
426000	431000	Nope, turns out Demeter was wrong and this was actually a semi-consensual kidnapping.
431000	434000	That was a pretty wild chariot ride.
434000	435000	Stupid, sexy Hades.
435000	437000	Why does it have to be like this?
437000	439000	Stupid, irresistible, sexy Hades.
440000	442000	Hades, don't be a voyeur.
442000	445000	What the? Ew. Why?
445000	447000	No, never mind, this is not stupid, sexy Hades.
447000	449000	Oh, but don't worry, he's in Xena too.
456000	461000	I feel like at some point this actor saw and really liked James Wood's interpretation of Hades from the Disney movie.
461000	462000	Where is she?
462000	465000	Gabrielle, well, if she's dead, she didn't come to me.
465000	467000	I saw her die, she had to come to you.
467000	468000	Why would I lie to you?
468000	470000	Hey, come on, Xena, babe, let's cut a deal.
470000	473000	But towards the end of the series, Xena starts pulling a god of war
473000	477000	and starts killing gods because she can and because motherhood.
477000	482000	No, seriously, the name of this episode is Motherhood.
482000	486000	If we wish to kill Eve, we have to go through Xena.
486000	490000	And as a mother, she'll be more dangerous than ever.
494000	495000	Oh, but it gets better.
495000	497000	Here's why we're killing off gods.
497000	499000	It was sent by the archangel Michael.
499000	500000	Michael?
500000	504000	He said that Eve would prepare the way for the rule of the god of love.
504000	506000	Yeah, yep.
513000	514000	Bye, Hades.
516000	517000	No!
517000	519000	Well, shit, now who's gonna run the underworld?
520000	521000	Next.
521000	526000	My boy, my little Hercules.
527000	529000	How sentimental.
530000	535000	You know, I haven't been this choked up since I got a hunk of moussaka caught in my throat.
535000	536000	Huh?
537000	541000	So, while John Musker and Ron Clements were developing the studio mandate of a film,
541000	545000	they arbitrarily decided that Hades was going to be the villain in the story
545000	546000	because death equals scary,
546000	550000	despite Hercules rarely interacting with the Lord of the Dead in the mythology
550000	553000	and certainly never in an arch-nemesis sort of way.
553000	557000	So, despite Hades as your villain making no sense in a Hercules story,
557000	561000	because that's usually Hera, who is his doting mother in this movie,
561000	564000	Hades is our antagonist because he wants to be in charge of Olympus,
564000	571000	and originally he was going to be like this dark, slow-moving, broody, like Chernaboggy type.
571000	573000	And then James Woods showed up.
573000	577000	For some weird reason, I came in and he was Hades, the Lord of the Underworld,
577000	579000	and I guess everybody came in going,
579000	580000	I guess everybody came in going,
580000	581000	Hello, I'm Hades!
581000	582000	And I came in going,
582000	585000	Hey, Hades, how you doing? Nice to see a nice face.
585000	589000	For some reason, I just was feeling kind of silly that day.
589000	595000	And his version of Hades manifests as this sort of huckster, used car salesman type,
595000	597000	and the subsequent interpretation of this character,
597000	600000	while yes, I know, not accurate,
600000	604000	is still honestly way too good for this movie.
604000	606000	People are going to get hurt, aren't they?
606000	608000	Nah, I mean, you know, it's a possibility.
608000	610000	It happens, you know, it's war, but what can I tell you?
610000	613000	As a character, this version of Hades is great,
613000	618000	but as a plot device, he was not very strong.
618000	622000	I'm about to rearrange the cosmos.
622000	626000	So all that is good about the character is pretty much directly attributable
626000	629000	to Woods and lead animator Nick Ranieri.
629000	632000	Anyway, see, ladies, I was at this party and I lost track of you.
632000	634000	I know you know.
634000	637000	And this, in large part, and by Woods' own admission,
637000	640000	is because almost every line he does in the film is ad-libbed.
640000	643000	Meg, Meg, talk to him, smooth.
646000	647000	Get away from me.
647000	651000	Speaking of hell, yes, did I mention that this had an animated series spin-off?
651000	655000	Yeah, and we're not employees, we're cast members.
655000	656000	Oh.
656000	659000	Which you cannot find anywhere unless you're, like,
659000	661000	bit torrenting or watching it on YouTube.
661000	665000	And it's funny that in 50-plus episodes, Persephone never shows up.
665000	668000	But she is in the movie.
668000	670000	Right there.
670000	672000	This Sarah Brightman-looking motherfucker.
672000	674000	And aside from Danny DeVito and Rip Torn,
674000	678000	it features the entirely the same voice cast, including James Woods,
678000	681000	who loves being Hades and does it at every opportunity,
681000	683000	which is not enough.
683000	684000	It is never enough.
684000	688000	Everyone goes to orientation on their first day.
688000	690000	Orientation?
690000	693000	I run a professional organization.
693000	696000	The animated series takes place basically during the
696000	699000	Danny DeVito training montage in the movie.
699000	702000	And yes, in the animated series, Hades is well aware
702000	704000	that Hercules is alive and not dead,
704000	707000	and no, this is never addressed as a continuity issue.
707000	709000	It just is.
709000	712000	In the show, Hades' bid to take over Olympus appears to be a constant thing
712000	714000	rather than a ticking clock.
714000	715000	Well, ticking planet.
715000	718000	Driven push that only Hercules is prophesied to stop.
718000	721000	No Persephone, but Hades does have a crush on Aphrodite, which is great.
724000	726000	And she is great because she has her own theme song.
732000	734000	There are a lot of great moments in this show,
734000	736000	unlike the animation, which is not great at all.
736000	737000	It's terrible.
737000	739000	He even has a song in one episode.
749000	751000	I'd like you to see.
751000	754000	Okay, yeah, this is why Hades has no villain song in the movie.
754000	756000	In my town.
756000	757000	In his town.
757000	758000	I'm number one.
758000	760000	Not in my book you ain't.
760000	763000	Though one of the best episodes is the one where Hades teams up with Jafar.
763000	767000	Apparently, Hercules happens more or less at the same time as Aladdin.
767000	770000	One's the most powerful sorcerer in the world.
770000	773000	Good for you, you big scary booger head, you.
774000	779000	It features such gems as Hades and Jafar bonding over their respective adolescent nemeses.
785000	787000	Giving each other villainy advice.
796000	802000	And then they stage like a Wolverine versus Hulk comic book battle between Hercules and Aladdin.
803000	808000	Aladdin and Hercules would have some sort of terrible misunderstanding.
808000	810000	And then, of course, they team up.
810000	814000	Okay, don't panic. Heroes burst in all the time down here.
814000	817000	I could go on and on about this show because there are a lot of episodes.
817000	821000	And because there are a lot of episodes, there are definitely some that drag.
821000	823000	But I definitely prefer the show to the movie.
823000	825000	Except the animation.
825000	827000	You idiots!
827000	829000	What is that, cherry? Give me a taste of that.
830000	831000	Mmm, nice.
831000	832000	Disney Hades.
832000	836000	You can find a more accurate Hades, but you will be loathe to find a more fun one.
836000	838000	Uh, guys.
838000	840000	Olympus would be that way.
843000	844000	Next.
848000	850000	Free at last.
852000	858000	Man, I'd feel bad for any Hades that follows James Woods, but this guy is among the lamest.
858000	861000	Which is a shame, because it's John Rhys-Davies, and he's cool.
861000	864000	Hades from Justice League and Justice League Unlimited.
864000	869000	In case you ever wondered what would happen if Mephistopheles was crossed with Fabio.
869000	871000	And also this.
877000	880000	You know, let's dig a little deeper with the whole Satan thing.
880000	887000	Of all the underworld gods that were pre-Christian, why did the Satan thing stick to Hades the most?
887000	889000	Now you see his true face.
889000	894000	I mean, Osiris is another well-known god of the dead, and he doesn't have the Satan connotation.
894000	896000	So, why Hades?
896000	899000	At its core, it really is a translation issue.
899000	906000	The Bible, written in Hebrew, used the word this to refer to the abode of the dead.
906000	909000	In practice, this is divorced from the Greek idea of Hades.
910000	917000	But, when it was translated into ancient Greek, this word is translated to this word, meaning Hades.
917000	920000	And remember, God's name, same as the place.
920000	922000	Welcome to Lindsay.
922000	929000	All of this would eventually be wrapped up into this unified idea of the Christian hell through a series of translations.
929000	934000	The modern English word Hades popped up around when the modern English did.
934000	938000	And specifically to refer to the place where Jesus went after the crucifixion.
938000	945000	In the King James Version, the Greek word Hades is translated into hell, death, and, well, Hades,
945000	948000	depending on which verse we're talking about and which book we're talking about.
948000	955000	Despite a resurgence in interest in classical mythology around the Enlightenment era that has lasted all the way up to, well, now,
955000	964000	I think we can safely say now this conflation of Bible Hades the place and God Hades the guy has more or less stuck.
965000	971000	Anyway, Justice League, this version was always kind of the exemplar for lame, lazy devil Hades.
971000	975000	And once again, he's trying to overthrow Zeus because reasons.
975000	976000	And also...
976000	980000	Tormenting Faust's pathetic soul.
980000	982000	You've got to be f***ing kidding me.
982000	985000	So, Hades intends to give Olympus to the Titans.
985000	989000	Hades tricked my mother into opening the gates of Olympus to the invading Titans.
989000	991000	Where we heard this before.
992000	997000	And Hippolyta had a thing with him at one point, and he is possibly Diana's maybe dad.
997000	1000000	My mother sculpted me from clay and breathed life into me.
1000000	1003000	Your mother and I sculpted you together.
1005000	1006000	He's gone?
1006000	1008000	What did you ever see in him?
1008000	1010000	Well, did you see his tongue?
1010000	1014000	Just think, this is the kind of boring bad guy the Disney version would have been
1014000	1018000	if James Woods hadn't made one of the best decisions of his or anyone's career.
1021000	1023000	Bow to me, mortals!
1024000	1025000	Next.
1025000	1028000	You are here for a favor.
1028000	1029000	I am.
1029000	1034000	Perhaps then you can enlighten me as to why you think I would remove your bands.
1034000	1035000	Hmm...
1035000	1037000	Hades, you look different.
1037000	1039000	Where are my manners?
1040000	1046000	This version's aesthetic is such an outlier, I'm not really sure what to say about it.
1046000	1051000	But obviously, more than anything, it looks like Bacchus than Hades.
1051000	1055000	So obviously this version does not fall in the same continuity with Justice League.
1055000	1060000	And believe it or not, Hades, who is voiced by and appears to be modeled on Oliver Platt,
1060000	1063000	is not the central antagonist, but Ares.
1063000	1066000	Weirdly voiced by Alfred Molina.
1066000	1069000	I shall never be able to repay your gesture.
1069000	1070000	You know, Doc Ock.
1070000	1073000	Hades here is basically just a glorified cameo.
1073000	1077000	And, well, points for different.
1078000	1079000	Next.
1080000	1082000	We have visitors.
1085000	1086000	Nephew?
1086000	1090000	So now we make it to the film version of Percy Jackson and the Sorcerer's Stone.
1090000	1092000	I mean, The Lightning Thief.
1092000	1093000	God, this movie.
1093000	1097000	Would you prefer that I looked like this?
1098000	1102000	This interpretation being sort of aging rock star,
1102000	1107000	and accompanied by an extremely bitter and confusing Persephone,
1107000	1109000	who is played by Rosario Dawson.
1109000	1111000	Don't ignore me.
1111000	1113000	Or what?
1113000	1114000	What will you do?
1114000	1117000	Uh, you know, okay.
1117000	1121000	Hades almost does the I'm going to take over Olympus thing.
1121000	1124000	I am going to be king of the gods.
1124000	1125000	But then...
1127000	1128000	No!
1130000	1131000	What, huh?
1131000	1136000	The only thing I look forward to is my allotted time away from this hellhole.
1136000	1140000	A war of the gods would put an end to that.
1140000	1144000	And I'd be alone with only him.
1144000	1145000	Okay.
1147000	1149000	Like I said, glorified cameo.
1149000	1150000	Next.
1151000	1155000	You are specks of dust beneath our fingernails.
1155000	1158000	Your very breath is a gift from Olympus.
1158000	1162000	You have insulted powers beyond your comprehension.
1162000	1164000	Who are you?
1164000	1166000	I am Hades.
1166000	1170000	Ah, we saved the very worst for last.
1172000	1177000	So, unlike the 1981 film for which this remake is presumably named,
1177000	1180000	in which the antagonist was mostly Poseidon,
1180000	1184000	which makes sense, seeing as Poseidon is a god of the sea,
1184000	1186000	and Kraken is a sea beast.
1186000	1192000	And from his own flesh, Hades gave birth to an unspeakable horror,
1192000	1194000	the Kraken.
1196000	1198000	Here, Hades is played by Ralph Fiennes
1198000	1203000	as a sort of Voldemort by way of Turtle from Battlefield Earth.
1203000	1206000	I will unleash the Kraken.
1206000	1209000	Aw, are you going to give Draco an awkward hug now?
1209000	1212000	This version of Hades is also a touch derivative.
1212000	1216000	Finally, some rage from you.
1220000	1224000	How long has it been, brother?
1224000	1226000	Where have we seen this before?
1226000	1228000	How sentimental.
1229000	1232000	It also basically has the same ending as the Disney movie.
1232000	1235000	I've been a little blind.
1235000	1237000	No!
1239000	1243000	Hades is banished, inconvenienced.
1243000	1247000	It's not clear, but it does involve being thrown down a hole.
1248000	1250000	He's in the sequel too, but he's less bad in that one.
1250000	1252000	I don't know. Moving on.
1252000	1254000	Release the Kraken.
1254000	1257000	The interesting contrast with Hades, the character, the idea, whatever,
1257000	1260000	is how much changes from iteration to iteration
1260000	1263000	while at the same time still being borrowed.
1263000	1266000	That Satan-y undertone that keeps popping up, for instance,
1266000	1269000	despite the fact that it's never really there in the mythology.
1269000	1272000	Or even up to the fact that after the Disney movie came out,
1272000	1276000	pop culture Hades-es just kept wanting to take over Olympus.
1276000	1278000	There is no official Hades handbook,
1278000	1281000	but those intertwined influences are still there.
1281000	1283000	And I think the older your character is,
1283000	1285000	the more of that you're going to see,
1285000	1288000	even if people do get sort of butthurt about it being inaccurate.
1288000	1291000	Which, let me remind you, is not a barometer for enjoyability.
1291000	1294000	Again, this one was among the least accurate.
1294000	1297000	This one is different. He's honest and he's sweet.
1297000	1299000	Please. He would never do anything to hurt me.
1299000	1300000	He's a guy.
1300000	1303000	Next loose cannon, which I promise I'll do sooner than in three months,
1303000	1305000	we're going to do a lady,
1305000	1307000	based on these suggestions that I got on Twitter
1307000	1310000	slash the ones I was actually interested in doing.
1310000	1312000	Here are your three options.
1312000	1314000	You can find the link to vote below,
1314000	1316000	which is on my website, shayapocalypse.com,
1316000	1319000	and if you want to give me suggestions slash talk about it,
1319000	1321000	follow me on Twitter.
1321000	1323000	And we will see you next time.
