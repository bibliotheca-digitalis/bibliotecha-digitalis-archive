00:00.000 --> 00:05.100
So, Greek myth time again. Last time it was dude and the embodiment of death.

00:05.100 --> 00:11.160
This time it's a lady and an embodiment of sex and love and sex and...

00:11.160 --> 00:12.340
mostly sex.

00:12.340 --> 00:18.380
The Etruscans knew her as Turin, the Romans knew her as Venus, the Greeks knew her as Aphrodite.

00:18.380 --> 00:20.880
Aphrodite!

00:20.880 --> 00:22.460
The goddess of love!

00:22.460 --> 00:25.460
Unlike figures like Hercules who became popular as characters,

00:25.460 --> 00:27.640
Mind your own business, Venus.

00:27.640 --> 00:35.700
Aphrodite is beloved in pop culture more as a symbol or an idea more than a character that does things.

00:35.700 --> 00:39.800
Two of the most famous pieces of art in European history are of the goddess Venus.

00:39.800 --> 00:43.140
Venus de Milo, thought to be the work of Alexandros of Antioch,

00:43.140 --> 00:51.000
and Botticelli's The Birth of Venus, which gets homaged in everything from Lady Gaga videos to The Muppets to Andy Warhol.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.620
And let's not forget name drops in pop songs.

00:53.620 --> 00:57.480
He's Venus, in blue jeans.

00:57.480 --> 00:59.480
I'm your Venus.

00:59.480 --> 01:01.480
Oh, Venus.

01:01.480 --> 01:03.980
Oh, I'm Aphrodite, alright.

01:03.980 --> 01:06.980
Aphrodite.

01:06.980 --> 01:10.980
Make me your Aphrodite.

01:10.980 --> 01:15.480
But she does pop up as a character from time to time, and that's what we're going to look at today.

01:15.480 --> 01:20.980
Said characters tend to draw on Botticelli's Venus a lot, at least in terms of their iconography,

01:21.340 --> 01:30.340
but unlike heroic Hercules, or bellicose Ares, or wise Athena, Aphrodite doesn't really have any intrinsic definitive character attributes.

01:30.340 --> 01:38.340
Most of her characterization tends to draw on what society thinks of a sexualized woman at the time that the media is made.

01:38.340 --> 01:41.340
You can still share my bed.

01:41.340 --> 01:49.340
Aphrodite is an interesting subject as far as modern iterations go, not because she is a love goddess,

01:49.700 --> 01:53.700
but because the Greeks had such different ideas on love and what it even was.

01:53.700 --> 01:59.700
The typical Greek love categories were agape, which was a charitable philanthropic kind of love.

01:59.700 --> 02:01.700
You know, like love for mankind.

02:01.700 --> 02:08.700
Philia, a concept developed by Aristotle, which is an affectionate, dispassionate, virtuous love between friends.

02:08.700 --> 02:10.700
You know, usually between equals.

02:10.700 --> 02:14.700
Aphrodite's domain wasn't catch-all love, but erotic sexual love.

02:15.060 --> 02:20.060
Love in the sense of passionate desire for an object, but a feminine version of it.

02:20.060 --> 02:25.060
Women in ancient Greece were basically considered subhuman, and let's just get that out of the way.

02:25.060 --> 02:31.060
So the love-er is some guy, and the love-e of Eros is an object.

02:31.060 --> 02:33.060
You know, typically women or teenage boys.

02:33.060 --> 02:37.060
Greek attitudes on love and beauty were somewhat contradictory.

02:37.060 --> 02:42.060
What we consider infatuation was, to the Greeks, considered a form of madness, like a mental illness.

02:42.420 --> 02:48.420
And while some social classes in city-states had more favorable views on love, beauty, and femininity,

02:48.420 --> 02:52.420
there were big influences from philosophers as well.

02:52.420 --> 02:57.420
Aristotle thought that women would bring disorder, evil, and were utterly useless,

02:57.420 --> 02:59.420
and caused more confusion than the enemy.

02:59.420 --> 03:01.420
Socrates wrote,

03:01.780 --> 03:07.780
Being born a woman is a divine punishment, since a woman is halfway between a man and an animal.

03:07.780 --> 03:13.780
Aristotle wrote that the male is by nature superior, and the female inferior, as one rules and the other is ruled.

03:13.780 --> 03:20.780
This inequality is permanent, because the woman's deliberate faculty is without authority, like a child.

03:20.780 --> 03:25.780
Aristotle considered Eros as the love of desire, or acquisitive love,

03:25.780 --> 03:30.780
and therefore egocentric, and object-oriented.

03:31.140 --> 03:36.140
Eros or two say philia, or brotherly love. This is not a love between equals.

03:36.140 --> 03:40.140
There were schools of thought that disagreed with this, of course, like the Stoics,

03:40.140 --> 03:45.140
who wanted sexual equality and were much more pro-sex,

03:45.140 --> 03:49.140
and things were much better for women in Sparta than Athens.

03:49.140 --> 03:53.140
But the point is that the Greek viewpoint on love, femininity, and sexuality

03:53.140 --> 03:58.140
was extremely varied, and overall way different from ours.

03:58.500 --> 04:01.500
Erotic love wasn't an awesome fun sexy thing like we see it today,

04:01.500 --> 04:05.500
but a scary maddening thing, more of a disease than a rite of passage,

04:05.500 --> 04:09.500
hence why Cupid's weapon of choice is an arrow, you're struck by it.

04:09.500 --> 04:12.500
Being madly in love was not a desirable thing,

04:12.500 --> 04:18.500
which is why it was considered intervention by capricious jerk gods like Aphrodite and Eros.

04:18.500 --> 04:21.500
And this isn't necessarily an idea relegated to antiquity.

04:21.500 --> 04:24.500
Even modern writers like C.S. Lewis held this viewpoint,

04:24.860 --> 04:27.860
that erotic love and infatuation is scary madness thing,

04:27.860 --> 04:33.860
and we should have brotherly love of passionless discourse thought.

04:33.860 --> 04:38.860
Like a lot of Greek deities, Aphrodite was something of a holdover from a pre-Hellenistic era,

04:38.860 --> 04:41.860
which contributes to her being a bit of a contradictory figure

04:41.860 --> 04:45.860
for a society that was so brrr-gone women.

04:45.860 --> 04:48.860
Aphrodite is more like Zeus than any of the other goddesses.

04:48.860 --> 04:51.860
She is married, but she sleeps around with whoever.

04:52.220 --> 04:56.220
She's highly sexualized, but still a goddess, and therefore must be respected.

04:56.220 --> 04:59.220
She's got the jealous spouse, the list goes on.

04:59.220 --> 05:03.220
Aphrodite was also a much bigger jerk than, say, Hades.

05:03.220 --> 05:07.220
She dealt in all sorts of godly interventions and eternal damnations and curses.

05:07.220 --> 05:10.220
But since she is a love goddess,

05:10.220 --> 05:13.220
and our modern idea on erotic love is so different from that of antiquity,

05:13.220 --> 05:16.220
her modern portrayals are a bit all over the place.

05:16.220 --> 05:21.220
Pop culture iterations of Aphrodite are imposing a modern idea of romantic love onto a character.

05:21.580 --> 05:24.580
That was an embodiment of a different type of love.

05:24.580 --> 05:26.580
A different idea.

05:26.580 --> 05:30.580
And it's interesting to see how we portray a sexual goddess of love and beauty and desire

05:30.580 --> 05:35.580
depending on what decade we're in, and how that decade feels about women and sex.

05:35.580 --> 05:40.580
So, let's start back with the 40s.

05:40.580 --> 05:43.580
It's not as bad as you think it's going to be, I promise.

05:43.580 --> 05:45.580
To Venus, the goddess of love.

05:45.580 --> 05:48.580
May she stay on the job and take care of all of us.

05:48.940 --> 05:52.940
1848's One Touch of Venus is loosely based on the Pygmalion myth,

05:52.940 --> 05:55.940
only with Venus in the place of Galatea.

05:55.940 --> 05:59.940
And I guess that isn't completely out of left field?

05:59.940 --> 06:02.940
In Ovid's Pygmalion, it is Aphrodite he prays to

06:02.940 --> 06:07.940
to get his statue to come to life and be his eros, desire object.

06:07.940 --> 06:10.940
A wealthy department store mogul Whitfield Savory II

06:10.940 --> 06:13.940
buys a statue of Venus, and one of his clerks named Eddie

06:13.940 --> 06:16.940
gets drunk and kisses her.

06:17.300 --> 06:21.300
She decides that this guy is hot stuff for... reasons.

06:21.300 --> 06:24.300
Venus also touches on how she's dealt with her past

06:24.300 --> 06:26.300
mortal lovers in undesirable ways.

06:26.300 --> 06:29.300
Again, not really a thing in the actual mythology.

06:29.300 --> 06:34.300
What about this fellow, the one you turned into an owl?

06:34.300 --> 06:36.300
Hip, hip, hip, hip.

06:36.300 --> 06:37.300
About this?

06:37.300 --> 06:40.300
So annoying that I finally had to turn him into a...

06:40.300 --> 06:42.300
But boy, you want to talk about women, mythical Venus?

06:42.300 --> 06:45.300
Smote for things like friendzoning guys

06:45.660 --> 06:47.660
getting raped in her temple.

06:47.660 --> 06:49.660
This is a very frivolous, light comedy.

06:49.660 --> 06:52.660
The plot is kind of only loosely held together.

06:52.660 --> 06:55.660
Eddie's disposable love interest is a paranoid nag,

06:55.660 --> 06:57.660
but she ends up with his buddy anyway,

06:57.660 --> 07:01.660
leaving the drunken statue-kisser all alone.

07:01.660 --> 07:04.660
This stands in contrast to a 1988 remake

07:04.660 --> 07:07.660
called Goddess of Love, starring Vanna White.

07:07.660 --> 07:11.660
Watch Wheel of Fortune tonight at seven.

07:11.660 --> 07:12.660
Yep.

07:12.660 --> 07:13.660
Aphrodite.

07:14.020 --> 07:16.020
With apologies, dear Father Zeus.

07:16.020 --> 07:19.020
You know I prefer to be called Venus.

07:19.020 --> 07:21.020
And this is why Vanna White's most famous role

07:21.020 --> 07:23.020
is for not speaking.

07:23.020 --> 07:25.020
Three thousand years I have lain entranced in slumber.

07:25.020 --> 07:27.020
She is a statue for thousands of years,

07:27.020 --> 07:30.020
and the whole world is apparently Goddess of Loveless

07:30.020 --> 07:32.020
until the schmuck comes along with his

07:32.020 --> 07:34.020
Corpse Bride contrivance.

07:34.020 --> 07:35.020
Boy.

07:35.020 --> 07:37.020
Girl.

07:37.020 --> 07:39.020
Wedding ring.

07:39.020 --> 07:41.020
Finger.

07:41.020 --> 07:43.020
Really? That's what we're going with?

07:43.380 --> 07:45.380
The drunk statue kiss made more sense.

07:45.380 --> 07:47.380
Well, her goal is thus.

07:47.380 --> 07:49.380
She will return when she has won

07:49.380 --> 07:51.380
the heart of a man, and prove

07:51.380 --> 07:53.380
that she can keep his love

07:53.380 --> 07:55.380
without killing him.

07:55.380 --> 07:57.380
There that is again.

07:57.380 --> 07:59.380
But we're in one touch of Venus.

07:59.380 --> 08:01.380
It was more cutesy.

08:01.380 --> 08:02.380
You love another.

08:02.380 --> 08:03.380
Oh, no, no.

08:03.380 --> 08:05.380
If so, I shall crush her.

08:05.380 --> 08:07.380
Crush her?

08:10.380 --> 08:11.380
Crush her.

08:11.740 --> 08:13.740
Well, I guess this makes sense

08:13.740 --> 08:15.740
it was the 80s, you know,

08:15.740 --> 08:17.740
the decade of fatal attraction.

08:17.740 --> 08:19.740
In one touch of Venus, she seems to have

08:19.740 --> 08:21.740
an effect on his sanity in the way that a deity might.

08:21.740 --> 08:23.740
Here, it's more of an I dream of

08:23.740 --> 08:25.740
genie vibe, up to

08:25.740 --> 08:27.740
and including our supernatural dream girl

08:27.740 --> 08:29.740
being a hyper jealous nightmare

08:29.740 --> 08:31.740
contrasted to the mortal love interest

08:31.740 --> 08:33.740
who is so reasonable.

08:33.740 --> 08:35.740
It ends with her learning the true

08:35.740 --> 08:37.740
meaning of love after all, after nearly

08:37.740 --> 08:39.740
killing both of them, which oddly results

08:40.100 --> 08:42.100
in her turning back into a statue

08:42.100 --> 08:44.100
with the caveat that Zeus might backtrack

08:44.100 --> 08:46.100
on that later.

08:46.100 --> 08:48.100
I shall consider giving her a second opportunity.

08:48.100 --> 08:50.100
Perhaps when the warm season ends.

08:50.100 --> 08:52.100
This film also includes the

08:52.100 --> 08:54.100
late 80s, early 90s shopping montage

08:54.100 --> 08:56.100
and it is set to a song called

08:56.100 --> 08:58.100
Shopping Scream

08:58.100 --> 09:00.100
Shop Shop Shop

09:00.100 --> 09:02.100
Shopping Scream

09:02.100 --> 09:04.100
Shop Shop Shop

09:04.100 --> 09:06.100
It's good that the song is telling us what was going on

09:06.100 --> 09:08.100
because I would have been really confused

09:08.460 --> 09:09.460
otherwise.

09:09.460 --> 09:11.460
She's gone crazy!

09:11.460 --> 09:13.460
Look at these mortals!

09:13.460 --> 09:15.460
Losers! Isn't this awesome?

09:16.460 --> 09:18.460
Aphrodite is a recurring character in both

09:18.460 --> 09:20.460
Hercules The Legendary Journeys

09:20.460 --> 09:22.460
and Xeno Warrior Princess

09:22.460 --> 09:24.460
and she wears pink a lot

09:24.460 --> 09:26.460
because 90s.

09:32.460 --> 09:34.460
This makes me yearn for the humble dignity

09:34.460 --> 09:36.460
of Anna White.

09:36.820 --> 09:38.820
Was that a boner?

09:41.820 --> 09:43.820
Hercules is the more goofy of the two shows

09:43.820 --> 09:45.820
but probably one of the best that captures

09:45.820 --> 09:47.820
how petty and arbitrary and selfish

09:47.820 --> 09:49.820
and self-aggrandizing the Greek gods are.

09:49.820 --> 09:51.820
Aphrodite is all of these things.

09:51.820 --> 09:53.820
Boring!

09:53.820 --> 09:55.820
You bore me! These bore me!

09:55.820 --> 09:57.820
Love bores me!

09:57.820 --> 09:59.820
Despite that, she's one of the most likable.

09:59.820 --> 10:01.820
More than anything, the Aphrodite

10:01.820 --> 10:03.820
of Hercules The Legendary Journeys

10:03.820 --> 10:05.820
reminds me of sheer horror wits from Clueless.

10:06.180 --> 10:08.180
If the government could just get to the kitchen

10:08.180 --> 10:10.180
rearrange some things, we could certainly

10:10.180 --> 10:12.180
party with the Hadians.

10:12.180 --> 10:14.180
Here she has a very early 90s idea

10:14.180 --> 10:16.180
of what an idealized physical

10:16.180 --> 10:18.180
beauty is.

10:18.180 --> 10:20.180
Tubular! Which is funny to see her age into the

10:20.180 --> 10:22.180
late 90s.

10:22.180 --> 10:24.180
By late era, Xena, her look was pretty

10:24.180 --> 10:26.180
dated, so they changed it up a bit.

10:26.180 --> 10:28.180
Hephaestus is here too.

10:28.180 --> 10:30.180
He's hot-ish in that he's not like

10:30.180 --> 10:32.180
the ugliest ever, but he has a rad

10:32.180 --> 10:34.180
face scar, as is Eros

10:34.540 --> 10:36.540
who is called Cupid. Oh my god, oh my god

10:36.540 --> 10:38.540
girl arm.

10:38.540 --> 10:40.540
What up?

10:40.540 --> 10:42.540
Look, get to the

10:42.540 --> 10:44.540
point, mom. I'm real busy.

10:44.540 --> 10:46.540
See? Young aspiring

10:46.540 --> 10:48.540
actors never lose hope.

10:48.540 --> 10:50.540
Aphrodite also has some of the best lines.

10:50.540 --> 10:52.540
Aphrodite, you got her off!

10:52.540 --> 10:54.540
And while she has a nice brother-sister

10:54.540 --> 10:56.540
relationship in Hercules,

10:56.540 --> 10:58.540
with Xena, it's more vain and bored

10:58.540 --> 11:00.540
and spiteful and jealous of

11:00.540 --> 11:02.540
Xena a lot, because women.

11:02.540 --> 11:04.540
Her appearance is in Xena. At first, she's much

11:04.540 --> 11:06.540
more into the whole cat fight and jealousy thing.

11:06.540 --> 11:08.540
But on the plus side, she actually

11:08.540 --> 11:10.540
has a character arc over the course of the series,

11:10.540 --> 11:12.540
starting out as this, like,

11:12.540 --> 11:14.540
spiteful, mercurial goddess

11:14.540 --> 11:16.540
and eventually growing to give a shit about

11:16.540 --> 11:18.540
mortals, specifically Gabrielle

11:18.540 --> 11:20.540
my little one.

11:20.540 --> 11:22.540
When eventually Xena starts killing

11:22.540 --> 11:24.540
the Olympians, God of War style,

11:24.540 --> 11:26.540
Xena got there first.

11:26.540 --> 11:28.540
Aphrodite is not on her shit list and is

11:28.540 --> 11:30.540
more of an ally. And by this point, she's

11:30.540 --> 11:32.540
wearing her angry lingerie, so you know she

11:32.540 --> 11:34.540
means business. See, she never

11:34.540 --> 11:36.540
liked that Xena, but she likes Gabrielle,

11:36.540 --> 11:38.540
so she's allowed to live into the

11:38.540 --> 11:40.540
seasons where the show got really

11:40.540 --> 11:42.540
squirrelly. Aphrodite is in the

11:42.540 --> 11:44.540
original Clash of the Titans.

11:44.540 --> 11:46.540
Barely. She's in the background

11:46.540 --> 11:48.540
for a lot of it, but only has a handful

11:48.540 --> 11:50.540
of lines.

11:50.540 --> 11:52.540
But Zeus transformed himself into a glittering shower of gold

11:52.540 --> 11:54.540
and visited her. Her big contribution

11:54.540 --> 11:56.540
to the narrative is Perseus' awesome

11:56.540 --> 11:58.540
new sword, and that's about it.

11:58.540 --> 12:00.540
Well, she does get name dropped

12:00.540 --> 12:02.540
during Medusa's backstory.

12:02.540 --> 12:04.540
But she was seduced by Poseidon.

12:04.540 --> 12:06.540
They made love in the temple

12:06.540 --> 12:08.540
of Aphrodite. She transformed

12:08.540 --> 12:10.540
her into an apparition

12:10.540 --> 12:12.540
so horrible.

12:12.540 --> 12:14.540
Yeah, seduced, so

12:14.540 --> 12:16.540
that's what we're calling it.

12:16.540 --> 12:18.540
The Adventures of Baron Munchausen

12:18.540 --> 12:20.540
is...

12:20.540 --> 12:22.540
it's

12:22.540 --> 12:24.540
Terry Gilliam. It's very Terry Gilliam.

12:24.540 --> 12:26.540
Venus is played by

12:26.540 --> 12:28.540
Uma Thurman in her very first film

12:28.540 --> 12:30.540
role.

12:30.540 --> 12:32.540
The whole film is hung on the most

12:32.540 --> 12:34.540
dreamlike of logic, so I will

12:34.540 --> 12:36.540
try to explain it, so...

12:36.540 --> 12:38.540
after Robin Williams'

12:38.540 --> 12:40.540
giant floating head king of the

12:40.540 --> 12:42.540
moon threatens our heroes for about

12:42.540 --> 12:44.540
20 minutes, they fall off the moon

12:44.540 --> 12:46.540
and land

12:46.540 --> 12:48.540
inside Vulcan's volcano.

12:48.540 --> 12:50.540
Hephaestus, here in the form of

12:50.540 --> 12:52.540
Vulcan, then takes them to tea.

12:52.540 --> 12:54.540
See what I mean when it sounds like someone's weird

12:54.540 --> 12:56.540
dream? And Venus shows up once again

12:56.540 --> 12:58.540
on her Birth of Venus clamshell, and

12:58.540 --> 13:00.540
um...

13:00.540 --> 13:02.540
I believe cucks is the word?

13:02.540 --> 13:04.540
Well, what happens next is a

13:04.540 --> 13:06.540
manosphere fever dream where she flirts

13:06.540 --> 13:08.540
and dances with the Baron, while

13:08.540 --> 13:10.540
nice guy Hephaestus goes unappreciated

13:10.540 --> 13:12.540
even after all those diamonds he made for her.

13:12.540 --> 13:14.540
Another diamond.

13:16.540 --> 13:18.540
Every woman above the age of

13:18.540 --> 13:20.540
nine in this movie gets the hots

13:20.540 --> 13:22.540
for the Baron, and Vulcan is jealous.

13:22.540 --> 13:24.540
And that is one of his traditional traits,

13:24.540 --> 13:26.540
by the by. He is like the male

13:26.540 --> 13:28.540
Hera, so bizarre as this movie

13:28.540 --> 13:30.540
is, it ends up actually being one of

13:30.540 --> 13:32.540
the more faithful to its original myth.

13:32.540 --> 13:34.540
And because you jerks chose Aphrodite

13:34.540 --> 13:36.540
that obligates me to finally

13:36.540 --> 13:38.540
yes, I looked at God of War.

13:38.540 --> 13:40.540
Thanks.

13:40.540 --> 13:42.540
Kratos.

13:42.540 --> 13:44.540
It's been far

13:44.540 --> 13:46.540
too long.

13:46.540 --> 13:48.540
God of War follows a demigod named Kratos

13:48.540 --> 13:50.540
who is basically out to kill Zeus and

13:50.540 --> 13:52.540
the Olympians, some of them,

13:52.540 --> 13:54.540
because revenge and destiny and stuff.

13:54.540 --> 13:56.540
In God of War 3, there is a

13:56.540 --> 13:58.540
scene where he goes to Aphrodite and

13:58.540 --> 14:00.540
finds her engaged with her handmaidens.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.540
Come on, really?

14:02.540 --> 14:04.540
The gods have

14:04.540 --> 14:06.540
truly blessed you, Kratos.

14:06.540 --> 14:08.540
This is like a parody.

14:08.540 --> 14:10.540
I mean, it's totally

14:10.540 --> 14:12.540
respectable and

14:12.540 --> 14:14.540
not silly at all.

14:14.540 --> 14:16.540
I have no time for games, Aphrodite.

14:16.540 --> 14:18.540
Aphrodite tries

14:18.540 --> 14:20.540
to seduce Kratos, but, you know, he's too

14:20.540 --> 14:22.540
badass to be interested in women.

14:22.540 --> 14:24.540
And then she tells him to do a thing, and then

14:24.540 --> 14:26.540
I guess he's not too badass because the

14:26.540 --> 14:28.540
player now has the option to be interested

14:28.540 --> 14:30.540
and it cuts to this.

14:30.540 --> 14:32.540
Ah,

14:32.540 --> 14:34.540
I

14:34.540 --> 14:36.540
grew jealous of our

14:36.540 --> 14:38.540
mistress.

14:38.540 --> 14:40.540
Such power.

14:40.540 --> 14:42.540
If it's this good watching,

14:42.540 --> 14:44.540
just imagine.

14:44.540 --> 14:46.540
Is he

14:46.540 --> 14:48.540
going to?

14:48.540 --> 14:50.540
By the gods!

14:50.540 --> 14:52.540
Usually if a woman says that

14:52.540 --> 14:54.540
and responds to a man engaging in a sex act,

14:54.540 --> 14:56.540
it's not

14:56.540 --> 14:58.540
a good sign.

14:58.540 --> 15:00.540
The magic of video

15:00.540 --> 15:02.540
doesn't capture this, but DualShock actually

15:02.540 --> 15:04.540
shakes with Kratos' thrust.

15:04.540 --> 15:06.540
I'm actually

15:06.540 --> 15:08.540
kind of surprised there are more depictions like this.

15:08.540 --> 15:10.540
You men and young toys.

15:10.540 --> 15:12.540
On occasion, Aphrodite appears

15:12.540 --> 15:14.540
as a mentor figure.

15:14.540 --> 15:16.540
2011's Ecupid was a

15:16.540 --> 15:18.540
micro-budget gay romance about a

15:18.540 --> 15:20.540
long-term relationship on the rocks.

15:20.540 --> 15:22.540
How would you feel about some

15:22.540 --> 15:24.540
words of wisdom from a gal who has seen a

15:24.540 --> 15:26.540
thing or two?

15:26.540 --> 15:28.540
Venus is played by Morgan Fairchild by way

15:28.540 --> 15:30.540
of a strangely supernatural-ish

15:30.540 --> 15:32.540
app who is here to give our

15:32.540 --> 15:34.540
main character what he thinks he wants so he can learn

15:34.540 --> 15:36.540
a valuable lesson about love.

15:36.540 --> 15:38.540
What have you learned?

15:38.540 --> 15:40.540
Venus is all about monogamy in this one.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.540
The goddess aspect is subtexty.

15:42.540 --> 15:44.540
The Ecupid software is created by

15:44.540 --> 15:46.540
divinity and Venus is only

15:46.540 --> 15:48.540
referred to as such in the credits.

15:48.540 --> 15:50.540
And we don't actually see her until the end when

15:50.540 --> 15:52.540
she appears as a helpful waitress

15:52.540 --> 15:54.540
and she shows up to give us the moral

15:54.540 --> 15:56.540
of the story.

15:56.540 --> 15:58.540
What you know in your head

15:58.540 --> 16:00.540
is what you feel in your heart.

16:00.540 --> 16:02.540
The incredibly

16:02.540 --> 16:04.540
vague moral of the story.

16:04.540 --> 16:06.540
And of course there is the criminally

16:06.540 --> 16:08.540
underrated Disney version, which is

16:08.540 --> 16:10.540
the best one. No, I'm not biased.

16:10.540 --> 16:12.540
Is Aphrodite in the 1997

16:12.540 --> 16:14.540
movie that precedes it?

16:14.540 --> 16:16.540
Well, technically.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.540
Here, and again here,

16:18.540 --> 16:20.540
and here,

16:20.540 --> 16:22.540
and that's about it.

16:22.540 --> 16:24.540
But she's one of the best things about the animated

16:24.540 --> 16:26.540
series, which is one of the best things

16:26.540 --> 16:28.540
Disney television ever did.

16:28.540 --> 16:30.540
Aphrodite, Aphrodite,

16:30.540 --> 16:32.540
Aphrodite!

16:32.540 --> 16:34.540
The goddess of love!

16:34.540 --> 16:36.540
She usually shows up when someone

16:36.540 --> 16:38.540
beseeches the gods for something love-related.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.540
Oh, and she's voiced by Lisa Kudrow.

16:40.540 --> 16:42.540
My best friend, Icarus, is in love

16:42.540 --> 16:44.540
with my other best friend. Wait, wait, wait. Are they both human?

16:44.540 --> 16:46.540
Uh, uh-huh. Just checking. Go on.

16:46.540 --> 16:48.540
In one episode, Hades wants a

16:48.540 --> 16:50.540
prophet, not to find out whether the taking

16:50.540 --> 16:52.540
over Olympus thing will work out like he does

16:52.540 --> 16:54.540
in the movie. Aphrodite!

16:54.540 --> 16:56.540
Oh, sorry. But to find out if

16:56.540 --> 16:58.540
Aphrodite will go out with him because he has a big crush

16:58.540 --> 17:00.540
on her. I want to ask her out on a

17:00.540 --> 17:02.540
date, but as you can probably imagine, I

17:02.540 --> 17:04.540
don't handle rejection well. Making him probably the

17:04.540 --> 17:06.540
only Disney villain who is actually

17:06.540 --> 17:08.540
interested in a romantic relationship.

17:08.540 --> 17:10.540
Well, you know, I mean,

17:10.540 --> 17:12.540
a consensual one.

17:12.540 --> 17:14.540
How did old man Pygmalion

17:14.540 --> 17:16.540
land a vision like that?

17:16.540 --> 17:18.540
There is a Galatea episode and she gets

17:18.540 --> 17:20.540
involved there, where Hercules decides

17:20.540 --> 17:22.540
to emulate Professor Pygmalion,

17:22.540 --> 17:24.540
who is a character, in order

17:24.540 --> 17:26.540
to get a date for the big dance.

17:26.540 --> 17:28.540
Hercules wants a dream girl, but of

17:28.540 --> 17:30.540
course the only attribute he cares about

17:30.540 --> 17:32.540
and asks for are physical ones.

17:32.540 --> 17:34.540
I really like tall girls.

17:34.540 --> 17:36.540
Ugh.

17:36.540 --> 17:38.540
And also that she's obsessed

17:38.540 --> 17:40.540
with him. Oh, okay, so beautiful

17:40.540 --> 17:42.540
and crazy about you. Good.

17:42.540 --> 17:44.540
Diggin' deep, huh? Women are people too,

17:44.540 --> 17:46.540
Hercules. And that's why

17:46.540 --> 17:48.540
they don't like you. That was stupid.

17:48.540 --> 17:50.540
Mm-hmm. And selfish. And shallow.

17:50.540 --> 17:52.540
And sexist. Okay! She shows up again in

17:52.540 --> 17:54.540
the Medusa episode in an ironic

17:54.540 --> 17:56.540
role reversal. Here she's actually

17:56.540 --> 17:58.540
helping her, if only in that typical

17:58.540 --> 18:00.540
Disney love yourself the way

18:00.540 --> 18:02.540
you are sort of way. Well, real

18:02.540 --> 18:04.540
friends will like you for who you are, not

18:04.540 --> 18:06.540
what you look like. And offers her glasses

18:06.540 --> 18:08.540
that prevent her from turning people into

18:08.540 --> 18:10.540
stone when they look at her, which Medusa

18:10.540 --> 18:12.540
eventually comes around to, but not before

18:12.540 --> 18:14.540
working for Hades for a little while first.

18:14.540 --> 18:16.540
Orientation? I run a professional

18:16.540 --> 18:18.540
organization. This episode

18:18.540 --> 18:20.540
also has one of the best digs at the Disney

18:20.540 --> 18:22.540
company in all of Disneydom. And we're

18:22.540 --> 18:24.540
not employees. We're cast members.

18:24.540 --> 18:26.540
Ugh. Modernizing Greek

18:26.540 --> 18:28.540
myth is always a popular one.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.540
She's not in the Percy Jackson series much.

18:30.540 --> 18:32.540
There she is.

18:32.540 --> 18:34.540
And her daughters are.

18:34.540 --> 18:36.540
In a deleted scene.

18:40.540 --> 18:42.540
Woof. I'd count that as a good

18:42.540 --> 18:44.540
thing that this was cut, but

18:44.540 --> 18:46.540
there's not much about these movies that are really

18:46.540 --> 18:48.540
all that salvageable regardless.

18:48.540 --> 18:50.540
And finally...

18:50.540 --> 18:52.540
Everyone has a soulmate

18:52.540 --> 18:54.540
somewhere in the world. Remember this?

18:54.540 --> 18:56.540
Yeah, me neither.

18:56.540 --> 18:58.540
Valentine was a CW show that aired in

18:58.540 --> 19:00.540
2008, and it focused on

19:00.540 --> 19:02.540
the Valentine family, a group of gods

19:02.540 --> 19:04.540
living amongst humans in modern

19:04.540 --> 19:06.540
day LA. Aphrodite

19:06.540 --> 19:08.540
is the family matriarch who runs a matchmaking

19:08.540 --> 19:10.540
company called Valentine Incorporated,

19:10.540 --> 19:12.540
which brings soulmates together.

19:12.540 --> 19:14.540
The employees of Valentine Incorporated

19:14.540 --> 19:16.540
are a bunch of matchmaker gods who have to

19:16.540 --> 19:18.540
keep their love god identity a secret

19:18.540 --> 19:20.540
for some reason. But their god

19:20.540 --> 19:22.540
methods just don't work in modern times,

19:22.540 --> 19:24.540
which means trouble for these gods.

19:28.540 --> 19:30.540
Mortals are constantly creating

19:30.540 --> 19:32.540
substitutions for human interaction.

19:32.540 --> 19:34.540
You see, if mortals don't start to

19:34.540 --> 19:36.540
love properly, then the gods

19:36.540 --> 19:38.540
start to become mortal.

19:38.540 --> 19:40.540
Do you know what happens to gods who become relevant?

19:44.540 --> 19:46.540
They become mortal. That's right.

19:46.540 --> 19:48.540
The eternal gods of Olympus are becoming mortal

19:48.540 --> 19:50.540
because of Snapchat.

19:50.540 --> 19:52.540
Man, remember when women

19:52.540 --> 19:54.540
were considered malformed versions

19:54.540 --> 19:56.540
of men and were basically property?

19:56.540 --> 19:58.540
We should go back to that.

19:58.540 --> 20:00.540
That was when love was real.

20:00.540 --> 20:02.540
As Greek god TV doesn't seem to sell well

20:02.540 --> 20:04.540
looking at you, Hercules, the animated series,

20:04.540 --> 20:06.540
this was cancelled after eight episodes.

20:06.540 --> 20:08.540
So that's it for our look at Aphrodite,

20:08.540 --> 20:10.540
a character who fluctuates with our

20:10.540 --> 20:12.540
attitudes on sexy women throughout the decades

20:12.540 --> 20:14.540
as well as who is

20:14.540 --> 20:16.540
creating that image, be it Disney

20:16.540 --> 20:18.540
or Terry Gilliam or...

20:18.540 --> 20:20.540
Yeah, so

20:20.540 --> 20:22.540
next episode, we are tossing

20:22.540 --> 20:24.540
it up with the theme not being a person

20:24.540 --> 20:26.540
but a thing, namely

20:26.540 --> 20:28.540
a thing that happened. So here are your

20:28.540 --> 20:30.540
options. You can vote for it here

20:30.540 --> 20:32.540
and in the link below this video.

20:32.540 --> 20:34.540
Should be interesting.

20:34.540 --> 20:36.540
Thank you for watching and

20:36.540 --> 20:38.540
see you next time.
