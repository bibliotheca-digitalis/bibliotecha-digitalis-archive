1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
So, Greek myth time again. Last time it was dude and the embodiment of death.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:11,160
This time it's a lady and an embodiment of sex and love and sex and...

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,340
mostly sex.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:18,380
The Etruscans knew her as Turin, the Romans knew her as Venus, the Greeks knew her as Aphrodite.

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,880
Aphrodite!

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,460
The goddess of love!

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,460
Unlike figures like Hercules who became popular as characters,

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,640
Mind your own business, Venus.

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:35,700
Aphrodite is beloved in pop culture more as a symbol or an idea more than a character that does things.

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,800
Two of the most famous pieces of art in European history are of the goddess Venus.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,140
Venus de Milo, thought to be the work of Alexandros of Antioch,

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:51,000
and Botticelli's The Birth of Venus, which gets homaged in everything from Lady Gaga videos to The Muppets to Andy Warhol.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,620
And let's not forget name drops in pop songs.

14
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,480
He's Venus, in blue jeans.

15
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,480
I'm your Venus.

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,480
Oh, Venus.

17
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,980
Oh, I'm Aphrodite, alright.

18
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,980
Aphrodite.

19
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,980
Make me your Aphrodite.

20
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,480
But she does pop up as a character from time to time, and that's what we're going to look at today.

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:20,980
Said characters tend to draw on Botticelli's Venus a lot, at least in terms of their iconography,

22
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:30,340
but unlike heroic Hercules, or bellicose Ares, or wise Athena, Aphrodite doesn't really have any intrinsic definitive character attributes.

23
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:38,340
Most of her characterization tends to draw on what society thinks of a sexualized woman at the time that the media is made.

24
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,340
You can still share my bed.

25
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:49,340
Aphrodite is an interesting subject as far as modern iterations go, not because she is a love goddess,

26
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,700
but because the Greeks had such different ideas on love and what it even was.

27
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,700
The typical Greek love categories were agape, which was a charitable philanthropic kind of love.

28
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,700
You know, like love for mankind.

29
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:08,700
Philia, a concept developed by Aristotle, which is an affectionate, dispassionate, virtuous love between friends.

30
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,700
You know, usually between equals.

31
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,700
Aphrodite's domain wasn't catch-all love, but erotic sexual love.

32
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,060
Love in the sense of passionate desire for an object, but a feminine version of it.

33
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,060
Women in ancient Greece were basically considered subhuman, and let's just get that out of the way.

34
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:31,060
So the love-er is some guy, and the love-e of Eros is an object.

35
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,060
You know, typically women or teenage boys.

36
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,060
Greek attitudes on love and beauty were somewhat contradictory.

37
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,060
What we consider infatuation was, to the Greeks, considered a form of madness, like a mental illness.

38
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:48,420
And while some social classes in city-states had more favorable views on love, beauty, and femininity,

39
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,420
there were big influences from philosophers as well.

40
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:57,420
Aristotle thought that women would bring disorder, evil, and were utterly useless,

41
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,420
and caused more confusion than the enemy.

42
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,420
Socrates wrote,

43
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:07,780
Being born a woman is a divine punishment, since a woman is halfway between a man and an animal.

44
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:13,780
Aristotle wrote that the male is by nature superior, and the female inferior, as one rules and the other is ruled.

45
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:20,780
This inequality is permanent, because the woman's deliberate faculty is without authority, like a child.

46
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,780
Aristotle considered Eros as the love of desire, or acquisitive love,

47
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,780
and therefore egocentric, and object-oriented.

48
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:36,140
Eros or two say philia, or brotherly love. This is not a love between equals.

49
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:40,140
There were schools of thought that disagreed with this, of course, like the Stoics,

50
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,140
who wanted sexual equality and were much more pro-sex,

51
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,140
and things were much better for women in Sparta than Athens.

52
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,140
But the point is that the Greek viewpoint on love, femininity, and sexuality

53
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:58,140
was extremely varied, and overall way different from ours.

54
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,500
Erotic love wasn't an awesome fun sexy thing like we see it today,

55
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,500
but a scary maddening thing, more of a disease than a rite of passage,

56
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,500
hence why Cupid's weapon of choice is an arrow, you're struck by it.

57
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,500
Being madly in love was not a desirable thing,

58
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:18,500
which is why it was considered intervention by capricious jerk gods like Aphrodite and Eros.

59
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,500
And this isn't necessarily an idea relegated to antiquity.

60
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,500
Even modern writers like C.S. Lewis held this viewpoint,

61
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,860
that erotic love and infatuation is scary madness thing,

62
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:33,860
and we should have brotherly love of passionless discourse thought.

63
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,860
Like a lot of Greek deities, Aphrodite was something of a holdover from a pre-Hellenistic era,

64
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,860
which contributes to her being a bit of a contradictory figure

65
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,860
for a society that was so brrr-gone women.

66
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,860
Aphrodite is more like Zeus than any of the other goddesses.

67
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,860
She is married, but she sleeps around with whoever.

68
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,220
She's highly sexualized, but still a goddess, and therefore must be respected.

69
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,220
She's got the jealous spouse, the list goes on.

70
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,220
Aphrodite was also a much bigger jerk than, say, Hades.

71
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,220
She dealt in all sorts of godly interventions and eternal damnations and curses.

72
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,220
But since she is a love goddess,

73
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,220
and our modern idea on erotic love is so different from that of antiquity,

74
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,220
her modern portrayals are a bit all over the place.

75
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:21,220
Pop culture iterations of Aphrodite are imposing a modern idea of romantic love onto a character.

76
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,580
That was an embodiment of a different type of love.

77
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,580
A different idea.

78
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,580
And it's interesting to see how we portray a sexual goddess of love and beauty and desire

79
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:35,580
depending on what decade we're in, and how that decade feels about women and sex.

80
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,580
So, let's start back with the 40s.

81
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,580
It's not as bad as you think it's going to be, I promise.

82
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,580
To Venus, the goddess of love.

83
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,580
May she stay on the job and take care of all of us.

84
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,940
1848's One Touch of Venus is loosely based on the Pygmalion myth,

85
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,940
only with Venus in the place of Galatea.

86
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,940
And I guess that isn't completely out of left field?

87
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,940
In Ovid's Pygmalion, it is Aphrodite he prays to

88
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:07,940
to get his statue to come to life and be his eros, desire object.

89
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,940
A wealthy department store mogul Whitfield Savory II

90
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,940
buys a statue of Venus, and one of his clerks named Eddie

91
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,940
gets drunk and kisses her.

92
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,300
She decides that this guy is hot stuff for... reasons.

93
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,300
Venus also touches on how she's dealt with her past

94
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,300
mortal lovers in undesirable ways.

95
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,300
Again, not really a thing in the actual mythology.

96
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,300
What about this fellow, the one you turned into an owl?

97
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,300
Hip, hip, hip, hip.

98
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,300
About this?

99
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,300
So annoying that I finally had to turn him into a...

100
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,300
But boy, you want to talk about women, mythical Venus?

101
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,300
Smote for things like friendzoning guys

102
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,660
getting raped in her temple.

103
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,660
This is a very frivolous, light comedy.

104
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,660
The plot is kind of only loosely held together.

105
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,660
Eddie's disposable love interest is a paranoid nag,

106
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,660
but she ends up with his buddy anyway,

107
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,660
leaving the drunken statue-kisser all alone.

108
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,660
This stands in contrast to a 1988 remake

109
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,660
called Goddess of Love, starring Vanna White.

110
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,660
Watch Wheel of Fortune tonight at seven.

111
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,660
Yep.

112
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,660
Aphrodite.

113
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,020
With apologies, dear Father Zeus.

114
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,020
You know I prefer to be called Venus.

115
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,020
And this is why Vanna White's most famous role

116
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,020
is for not speaking.

117
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,020
Three thousand years I have lain entranced in slumber.

118
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,020
She is a statue for thousands of years,

119
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,020
and the whole world is apparently Goddess of Loveless

120
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,020
until the schmuck comes along with his

121
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,020
Corpse Bride contrivance.

122
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,020
Boy.

123
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,020
Girl.

124
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,020
Wedding ring.

125
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,020
Finger.

126
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,020
Really? That's what we're going with?

127
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,380
The drunk statue kiss made more sense.

128
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,380
Well, her goal is thus.

129
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,380
She will return when she has won

130
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,380
the heart of a man, and prove

131
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,380
that she can keep his love

132
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,380
without killing him.

133
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,380
There that is again.

134
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,380
But we're in one touch of Venus.

135
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,380
It was more cutesy.

136
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,380
You love another.

137
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,380
Oh, no, no.

138
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,380
If so, I shall crush her.

139
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,380
Crush her?

140
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,380
Crush her.

141
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,740
Well, I guess this makes sense

142
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,740
it was the 80s, you know,

143
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,740
the decade of fatal attraction.

144
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,740
In one touch of Venus, she seems to have

145
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,740
an effect on his sanity in the way that a deity might.

146
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,740
Here, it's more of an I dream of

147
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,740
genie vibe, up to

148
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,740
and including our supernatural dream girl

149
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,740
being a hyper jealous nightmare

150
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,740
contrasted to the mortal love interest

151
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,740
who is so reasonable.

152
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,740
It ends with her learning the true

153
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,740
meaning of love after all, after nearly

154
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,740
killing both of them, which oddly results

155
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,100
in her turning back into a statue

156
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,100
with the caveat that Zeus might backtrack

157
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,100
on that later.

158
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,100
I shall consider giving her a second opportunity.

159
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,100
Perhaps when the warm season ends.

160
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,100
This film also includes the

161
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,100
late 80s, early 90s shopping montage

162
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,100
and it is set to a song called

163
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,100
Shopping Scream

164
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,100
Shop Shop Shop

165
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,100
Shopping Scream

166
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,100
Shop Shop Shop

167
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,100
It's good that the song is telling us what was going on

168
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,100
because I would have been really confused

169
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,460
otherwise.

170
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,460
She's gone crazy!

171
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,460
Look at these mortals!

172
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,460
Losers! Isn't this awesome?

173
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,460
Aphrodite is a recurring character in both

174
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,460
Hercules The Legendary Journeys

175
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,460
and Xeno Warrior Princess

176
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,460
and she wears pink a lot

177
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,460
because 90s.

178
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,460
This makes me yearn for the humble dignity

179
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,460
of Anna White.

180
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
Was that a boner?

181
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,820
Hercules is the more goofy of the two shows

182
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,820
but probably one of the best that captures

183
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,820
how petty and arbitrary and selfish

184
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
and self-aggrandizing the Greek gods are.

185
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,820
Aphrodite is all of these things.

186
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
Boring!

187
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,820
You bore me! These bore me!

188
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,820
Love bores me!

189
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
Despite that, she's one of the most likable.

190
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
More than anything, the Aphrodite

191
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,820
of Hercules The Legendary Journeys

192
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,820
reminds me of sheer horror wits from Clueless.

193
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,180
If the government could just get to the kitchen

194
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,180
rearrange some things, we could certainly

195
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,180
party with the Hadians.

196
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,180
Here she has a very early 90s idea

197
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,180
of what an idealized physical

198
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,180
beauty is.

199
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,180
Tubular! Which is funny to see her age into the

200
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,180
late 90s.

201
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,180
By late era, Xena, her look was pretty

202
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,180
dated, so they changed it up a bit.

203
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,180
Hephaestus is here too.

204
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,180
He's hot-ish in that he's not like

205
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,180
the ugliest ever, but he has a rad

206
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,180
face scar, as is Eros

207
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,540
who is called Cupid. Oh my god, oh my god

208
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,540
girl arm.

209
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,540
What up?

210
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,540
Look, get to the

211
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,540
point, mom. I'm real busy.

212
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,540
See? Young aspiring

213
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,540
actors never lose hope.

214
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,540
Aphrodite also has some of the best lines.

215
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,540
Aphrodite, you got her off!

216
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,540
And while she has a nice brother-sister

217
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,540
relationship in Hercules,

218
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,540
with Xena, it's more vain and bored

219
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,540
and spiteful and jealous of

220
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,540
Xena a lot, because women.

221
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,540
Her appearance is in Xena. At first, she's much

222
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,540
more into the whole cat fight and jealousy thing.

223
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,540
But on the plus side, she actually

224
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,540
has a character arc over the course of the series,

225
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,540
starting out as this, like,

226
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,540
spiteful, mercurial goddess

227
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,540
and eventually growing to give a shit about

228
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,540
mortals, specifically Gabrielle

229
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,540
my little one.

230
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,540
When eventually Xena starts killing

231
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,540
the Olympians, God of War style,

232
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,540
Xena got there first.

233
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,540
Aphrodite is not on her shit list and is

234
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,540
more of an ally. And by this point, she's

235
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,540
wearing her angry lingerie, so you know she

236
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,540
means business. See, she never

237
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,540
liked that Xena, but she likes Gabrielle,

238
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,540
so she's allowed to live into the

239
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,540
seasons where the show got really

240
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,540
squirrelly. Aphrodite is in the

241
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,540
original Clash of the Titans.

242
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,540
Barely. She's in the background

243
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,540
for a lot of it, but only has a handful

244
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,540
of lines.

245
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,540
But Zeus transformed himself into a glittering shower of gold

246
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,540
and visited her. Her big contribution

247
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,540
to the narrative is Perseus' awesome

248
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,540
new sword, and that's about it.

249
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,540
Well, she does get name dropped

250
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,540
during Medusa's backstory.

251
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,540
But she was seduced by Poseidon.

252
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,540
They made love in the temple

253
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,540
of Aphrodite. She transformed

254
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,540
her into an apparition

255
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,540
so horrible.

256
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,540
Yeah, seduced, so

257
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,540
that's what we're calling it.

258
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,540
The Adventures of Baron Munchausen

259
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,540
is...

260
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,540
it's

261
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,540
Terry Gilliam. It's very Terry Gilliam.

262
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,540
Venus is played by

263
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,540
Uma Thurman in her very first film

264
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,540
role.

265
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,540
The whole film is hung on the most

266
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,540
dreamlike of logic, so I will

267
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,540
try to explain it, so...

268
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,540
after Robin Williams'

269
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,540
giant floating head king of the

270
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,540
moon threatens our heroes for about

271
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,540
20 minutes, they fall off the moon

272
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,540
and land

273
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,540
inside Vulcan's volcano.

274
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,540
Hephaestus, here in the form of

275
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,540
Vulcan, then takes them to tea.

276
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,540
See what I mean when it sounds like someone's weird

277
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,540
dream? And Venus shows up once again

278
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,540
on her Birth of Venus clamshell, and

279
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,540
um...

280
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,540
I believe cucks is the word?

281
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,540
Well, what happens next is a

282
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,540
manosphere fever dream where she flirts

283
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,540
and dances with the Baron, while

284
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,540
nice guy Hephaestus goes unappreciated

285
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,540
even after all those diamonds he made for her.

286
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,540
Another diamond.

287
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,540
Every woman above the age of

288
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,540
nine in this movie gets the hots

289
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,540
for the Baron, and Vulcan is jealous.

290
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,540
And that is one of his traditional traits,

291
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,540
by the by. He is like the male

292
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,540
Hera, so bizarre as this movie

293
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,540
is, it ends up actually being one of

294
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,540
the more faithful to its original myth.

295
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,540
And because you jerks chose Aphrodite

296
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,540
that obligates me to finally

297
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,540
yes, I looked at God of War.

298
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,540
Thanks.

299
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,540
Kratos.

300
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,540
It's been far

301
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,540
too long.

302
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,540
God of War follows a demigod named Kratos

303
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,540
who is basically out to kill Zeus and

304
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,540
the Olympians, some of them,

305
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,540
because revenge and destiny and stuff.

306
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,540
In God of War 3, there is a

307
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,540
scene where he goes to Aphrodite and

308
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,540
finds her engaged with her handmaidens.

309
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,540
Come on, really?

310
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,540
The gods have

311
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,540
truly blessed you, Kratos.

312
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,540
This is like a parody.

313
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,540
I mean, it's totally

314
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,540
respectable and

315
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,540
not silly at all.

316
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,540
I have no time for games, Aphrodite.

317
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,540
Aphrodite tries

318
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,540
to seduce Kratos, but, you know, he's too

319
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,540
badass to be interested in women.

320
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,540
And then she tells him to do a thing, and then

321
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,540
I guess he's not too badass because the

322
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,540
player now has the option to be interested

323
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,540
and it cuts to this.

324
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,540
Ah,

325
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,540
I

326
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,540
grew jealous of our

327
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,540
mistress.

328
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,540
Such power.

329
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,540
If it's this good watching,

330
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,540
just imagine.

331
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,540
Is he

332
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,540
going to?

333
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,540
By the gods!

334
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,540
Usually if a woman says that

335
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,540
and responds to a man engaging in a sex act,

336
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,540
it's not

337
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,540
a good sign.

338
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,540
The magic of video

339
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,540
doesn't capture this, but DualShock actually

340
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,540
shakes with Kratos' thrust.

341
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,540
I'm actually

342
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,540
kind of surprised there are more depictions like this.

343
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,540
You men and young toys.

344
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,540
On occasion, Aphrodite appears

345
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,540
as a mentor figure.

346
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,540
2011's Ecupid was a

347
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,540
micro-budget gay romance about a

348
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,540
long-term relationship on the rocks.

349
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,540
How would you feel about some

350
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,540
words of wisdom from a gal who has seen a

351
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,540
thing or two?

352
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,540
Venus is played by Morgan Fairchild by way

353
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,540
of a strangely supernatural-ish

354
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,540
app who is here to give our

355
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,540
main character what he thinks he wants so he can learn

356
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,540
a valuable lesson about love.

357
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,540
What have you learned?

358
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,540
Venus is all about monogamy in this one.

359
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,540
The goddess aspect is subtexty.

360
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,540
The Ecupid software is created by

361
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,540
divinity and Venus is only

362
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,540
referred to as such in the credits.

363
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,540
And we don't actually see her until the end when

364
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,540
she appears as a helpful waitress

365
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,540
and she shows up to give us the moral

366
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,540
of the story.

367
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,540
What you know in your head

368
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,540
is what you feel in your heart.

369
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,540
The incredibly

370
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,540
vague moral of the story.

371
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,540
And of course there is the criminally

372
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,540
underrated Disney version, which is

373
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,540
the best one. No, I'm not biased.

374
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,540
Is Aphrodite in the 1997

375
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,540
movie that precedes it?

376
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,540
Well, technically.

377
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,540
Here, and again here,

378
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,540
and here,

379
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,540
and that's about it.

380
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,540
But she's one of the best things about the animated

381
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,540
series, which is one of the best things

382
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,540
Disney television ever did.

383
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,540
Aphrodite, Aphrodite,

384
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,540
Aphrodite!

385
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,540
The goddess of love!

386
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,540
She usually shows up when someone

387
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,540
beseeches the gods for something love-related.

388
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,540
Oh, and she's voiced by Lisa Kudrow.

389
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,540
My best friend, Icarus, is in love

390
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,540
with my other best friend. Wait, wait, wait. Are they both human?

391
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,540
Uh, uh-huh. Just checking. Go on.

392
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,540
In one episode, Hades wants a

393
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,540
prophet, not to find out whether the taking

394
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,540
over Olympus thing will work out like he does

395
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,540
in the movie. Aphrodite!

396
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,540
Oh, sorry. But to find out if

397
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,540
Aphrodite will go out with him because he has a big crush

398
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,540
on her. I want to ask her out on a

399
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,540
date, but as you can probably imagine, I

400
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,540
don't handle rejection well. Making him probably the

401
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,540
only Disney villain who is actually

402
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,540
interested in a romantic relationship.

403
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,540
Well, you know, I mean,

404
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,540
a consensual one.

405
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,540
How did old man Pygmalion

406
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,540
land a vision like that?

407
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,540
There is a Galatea episode and she gets

408
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,540
involved there, where Hercules decides

409
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,540
to emulate Professor Pygmalion,

410
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,540
who is a character, in order

411
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,540
to get a date for the big dance.

412
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,540
Hercules wants a dream girl, but of

413
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,540
course the only attribute he cares about

414
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,540
and asks for are physical ones.

415
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,540
I really like tall girls.

416
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,540
Ugh.

417
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,540
And also that she's obsessed

418
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,540
with him. Oh, okay, so beautiful

419
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,540
and crazy about you. Good.

420
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,540
Diggin' deep, huh? Women are people too,

421
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,540
Hercules. And that's why

422
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,540
they don't like you. That was stupid.

423
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,540
Mm-hmm. And selfish. And shallow.

424
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,540
And sexist. Okay! She shows up again in

425
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,540
the Medusa episode in an ironic

426
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,540
role reversal. Here she's actually

427
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,540
helping her, if only in that typical

428
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,540
Disney love yourself the way

429
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,540
you are sort of way. Well, real

430
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,540
friends will like you for who you are, not

431
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,540
what you look like. And offers her glasses

432
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,540
that prevent her from turning people into

433
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,540
stone when they look at her, which Medusa

434
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,540
eventually comes around to, but not before

435
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,540
working for Hades for a little while first.

436
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,540
Orientation? I run a professional

437
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,540
organization. This episode

438
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,540
also has one of the best digs at the Disney

439
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,540
company in all of Disneydom. And we're

440
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,540
not employees. We're cast members.

441
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,540
Ugh. Modernizing Greek

442
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,540
myth is always a popular one.

443
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,540
She's not in the Percy Jackson series much.

444
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,540
There she is.

445
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,540
And her daughters are.

446
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,540
In a deleted scene.

447
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,540
Woof. I'd count that as a good

448
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,540
thing that this was cut, but

449
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,540
there's not much about these movies that are really

450
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,540
all that salvageable regardless.

451
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,540
And finally...

452
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,540
Everyone has a soulmate

453
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,540
somewhere in the world. Remember this?

454
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,540
Yeah, me neither.

455
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,540
Valentine was a CW show that aired in

456
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,540
2008, and it focused on

457
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,540
the Valentine family, a group of gods

458
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,540
living amongst humans in modern

459
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,540
day LA. Aphrodite

460
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,540
is the family matriarch who runs a matchmaking

461
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,540
company called Valentine Incorporated,

462
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,540
which brings soulmates together.

463
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,540
The employees of Valentine Incorporated

464
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,540
are a bunch of matchmaker gods who have to

465
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,540
keep their love god identity a secret

466
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,540
for some reason. But their god

467
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,540
methods just don't work in modern times,

468
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,540
which means trouble for these gods.

469
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,540
Mortals are constantly creating

470
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,540
substitutions for human interaction.

471
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,540
You see, if mortals don't start to

472
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,540
love properly, then the gods

473
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,540
start to become mortal.

474
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,540
Do you know what happens to gods who become relevant?

475
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,540
They become mortal. That's right.

476
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,540
The eternal gods of Olympus are becoming mortal

477
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,540
because of Snapchat.

478
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,540
Man, remember when women

479
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,540
were considered malformed versions

480
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,540
of men and were basically property?

481
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,540
We should go back to that.

482
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,540
That was when love was real.

483
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,540
As Greek god TV doesn't seem to sell well

484
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,540
looking at you, Hercules, the animated series,

485
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,540
this was cancelled after eight episodes.

486
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,540
So that's it for our look at Aphrodite,

487
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,540
a character who fluctuates with our

488
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,540
attitudes on sexy women throughout the decades

489
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,540
as well as who is

490
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,540
creating that image, be it Disney

491
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,540
or Terry Gilliam or...

492
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,540
Yeah, so

493
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,540
next episode, we are tossing

494
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,540
it up with the theme not being a person

495
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,540
but a thing, namely

496
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,540
a thing that happened. So here are your

497
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,540
options. You can vote for it here

498
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,540
and in the link below this video.

499
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,540
Should be interesting.

500
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,540
Thank you for watching and

501
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,540
see you next time.
