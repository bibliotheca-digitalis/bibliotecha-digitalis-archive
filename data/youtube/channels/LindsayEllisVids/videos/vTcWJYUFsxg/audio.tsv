0	5100	So, Greek myth time again. Last time it was dude and the embodiment of death.
5100	11160	This time it's a lady and an embodiment of sex and love and sex and...
11160	12340	mostly sex.
12340	18380	The Etruscans knew her as Turin, the Romans knew her as Venus, the Greeks knew her as Aphrodite.
18380	20880	Aphrodite!
20880	22460	The goddess of love!
22460	25460	Unlike figures like Hercules who became popular as characters,
25460	27640	Mind your own business, Venus.
27640	35700	Aphrodite is beloved in pop culture more as a symbol or an idea more than a character that does things.
35700	39800	Two of the most famous pieces of art in European history are of the goddess Venus.
39800	43140	Venus de Milo, thought to be the work of Alexandros of Antioch,
43140	51000	and Botticelli's The Birth of Venus, which gets homaged in everything from Lady Gaga videos to The Muppets to Andy Warhol.
51000	53620	And let's not forget name drops in pop songs.
53620	57480	He's Venus, in blue jeans.
57480	59480	I'm your Venus.
59480	61480	Oh, Venus.
61480	63980	Oh, I'm Aphrodite, alright.
63980	66980	Aphrodite.
66980	70980	Make me your Aphrodite.
70980	75480	But she does pop up as a character from time to time, and that's what we're going to look at today.
75480	80980	Said characters tend to draw on Botticelli's Venus a lot, at least in terms of their iconography,
81340	90340	but unlike heroic Hercules, or bellicose Ares, or wise Athena, Aphrodite doesn't really have any intrinsic definitive character attributes.
90340	98340	Most of her characterization tends to draw on what society thinks of a sexualized woman at the time that the media is made.
98340	101340	You can still share my bed.
101340	109340	Aphrodite is an interesting subject as far as modern iterations go, not because she is a love goddess,
109700	113700	but because the Greeks had such different ideas on love and what it even was.
113700	119700	The typical Greek love categories were agape, which was a charitable philanthropic kind of love.
119700	121700	You know, like love for mankind.
121700	128700	Philia, a concept developed by Aristotle, which is an affectionate, dispassionate, virtuous love between friends.
128700	130700	You know, usually between equals.
130700	134700	Aphrodite's domain wasn't catch-all love, but erotic sexual love.
135060	140060	Love in the sense of passionate desire for an object, but a feminine version of it.
140060	145060	Women in ancient Greece were basically considered subhuman, and let's just get that out of the way.
145060	151060	So the love-er is some guy, and the love-e of Eros is an object.
151060	153060	You know, typically women or teenage boys.
153060	157060	Greek attitudes on love and beauty were somewhat contradictory.
157060	162060	What we consider infatuation was, to the Greeks, considered a form of madness, like a mental illness.
162420	168420	And while some social classes in city-states had more favorable views on love, beauty, and femininity,
168420	172420	there were big influences from philosophers as well.
172420	177420	Aristotle thought that women would bring disorder, evil, and were utterly useless,
177420	179420	and caused more confusion than the enemy.
179420	181420	Socrates wrote,
181780	187780	Being born a woman is a divine punishment, since a woman is halfway between a man and an animal.
187780	193780	Aristotle wrote that the male is by nature superior, and the female inferior, as one rules and the other is ruled.
193780	200780	This inequality is permanent, because the woman's deliberate faculty is without authority, like a child.
200780	205780	Aristotle considered Eros as the love of desire, or acquisitive love,
205780	210780	and therefore egocentric, and object-oriented.
211140	216140	Eros or two say philia, or brotherly love. This is not a love between equals.
216140	220140	There were schools of thought that disagreed with this, of course, like the Stoics,
220140	225140	who wanted sexual equality and were much more pro-sex,
225140	229140	and things were much better for women in Sparta than Athens.
229140	233140	But the point is that the Greek viewpoint on love, femininity, and sexuality
233140	238140	was extremely varied, and overall way different from ours.
238500	241500	Erotic love wasn't an awesome fun sexy thing like we see it today,
241500	245500	but a scary maddening thing, more of a disease than a rite of passage,
245500	249500	hence why Cupid's weapon of choice is an arrow, you're struck by it.
249500	252500	Being madly in love was not a desirable thing,
252500	258500	which is why it was considered intervention by capricious jerk gods like Aphrodite and Eros.
258500	261500	And this isn't necessarily an idea relegated to antiquity.
261500	264500	Even modern writers like C.S. Lewis held this viewpoint,
264860	267860	that erotic love and infatuation is scary madness thing,
267860	273860	and we should have brotherly love of passionless discourse thought.
273860	278860	Like a lot of Greek deities, Aphrodite was something of a holdover from a pre-Hellenistic era,
278860	281860	which contributes to her being a bit of a contradictory figure
281860	285860	for a society that was so brrr-gone women.
285860	288860	Aphrodite is more like Zeus than any of the other goddesses.
288860	291860	She is married, but she sleeps around with whoever.
292220	296220	She's highly sexualized, but still a goddess, and therefore must be respected.
296220	299220	She's got the jealous spouse, the list goes on.
299220	303220	Aphrodite was also a much bigger jerk than, say, Hades.
303220	307220	She dealt in all sorts of godly interventions and eternal damnations and curses.
307220	310220	But since she is a love goddess,
310220	313220	and our modern idea on erotic love is so different from that of antiquity,
313220	316220	her modern portrayals are a bit all over the place.
316220	321220	Pop culture iterations of Aphrodite are imposing a modern idea of romantic love onto a character.
321580	324580	That was an embodiment of a different type of love.
324580	326580	A different idea.
326580	330580	And it's interesting to see how we portray a sexual goddess of love and beauty and desire
330580	335580	depending on what decade we're in, and how that decade feels about women and sex.
335580	340580	So, let's start back with the 40s.
340580	343580	It's not as bad as you think it's going to be, I promise.
343580	345580	To Venus, the goddess of love.
345580	348580	May she stay on the job and take care of all of us.
348940	352940	1848's One Touch of Venus is loosely based on the Pygmalion myth,
352940	355940	only with Venus in the place of Galatea.
355940	359940	And I guess that isn't completely out of left field?
359940	362940	In Ovid's Pygmalion, it is Aphrodite he prays to
362940	367940	to get his statue to come to life and be his eros, desire object.
367940	370940	A wealthy department store mogul Whitfield Savory II
370940	373940	buys a statue of Venus, and one of his clerks named Eddie
373940	376940	gets drunk and kisses her.
377300	381300	She decides that this guy is hot stuff for... reasons.
381300	384300	Venus also touches on how she's dealt with her past
384300	386300	mortal lovers in undesirable ways.
386300	389300	Again, not really a thing in the actual mythology.
389300	394300	What about this fellow, the one you turned into an owl?
394300	396300	Hip, hip, hip, hip.
396300	397300	About this?
397300	400300	So annoying that I finally had to turn him into a...
400300	402300	But boy, you want to talk about women, mythical Venus?
402300	405300	Smote for things like friendzoning guys
405660	407660	getting raped in her temple.
407660	409660	This is a very frivolous, light comedy.
409660	412660	The plot is kind of only loosely held together.
412660	415660	Eddie's disposable love interest is a paranoid nag,
415660	417660	but she ends up with his buddy anyway,
417660	421660	leaving the drunken statue-kisser all alone.
421660	424660	This stands in contrast to a 1988 remake
424660	427660	called Goddess of Love, starring Vanna White.
427660	431660	Watch Wheel of Fortune tonight at seven.
431660	432660	Yep.
432660	433660	Aphrodite.
434020	436020	With apologies, dear Father Zeus.
436020	439020	You know I prefer to be called Venus.
439020	441020	And this is why Vanna White's most famous role
441020	443020	is for not speaking.
443020	445020	Three thousand years I have lain entranced in slumber.
445020	447020	She is a statue for thousands of years,
447020	450020	and the whole world is apparently Goddess of Loveless
450020	452020	until the schmuck comes along with his
452020	454020	Corpse Bride contrivance.
454020	455020	Boy.
455020	457020	Girl.
457020	459020	Wedding ring.
459020	461020	Finger.
461020	463020	Really? That's what we're going with?
463380	465380	The drunk statue kiss made more sense.
465380	467380	Well, her goal is thus.
467380	469380	She will return when she has won
469380	471380	the heart of a man, and prove
471380	473380	that she can keep his love
473380	475380	without killing him.
475380	477380	There that is again.
477380	479380	But we're in one touch of Venus.
479380	481380	It was more cutesy.
481380	482380	You love another.
482380	483380	Oh, no, no.
483380	485380	If so, I shall crush her.
485380	487380	Crush her?
490380	491380	Crush her.
491740	493740	Well, I guess this makes sense
493740	495740	it was the 80s, you know,
495740	497740	the decade of fatal attraction.
497740	499740	In one touch of Venus, she seems to have
499740	501740	an effect on his sanity in the way that a deity might.
501740	503740	Here, it's more of an I dream of
503740	505740	genie vibe, up to
505740	507740	and including our supernatural dream girl
507740	509740	being a hyper jealous nightmare
509740	511740	contrasted to the mortal love interest
511740	513740	who is so reasonable.
513740	515740	It ends with her learning the true
515740	517740	meaning of love after all, after nearly
517740	519740	killing both of them, which oddly results
520100	522100	in her turning back into a statue
522100	524100	with the caveat that Zeus might backtrack
524100	526100	on that later.
526100	528100	I shall consider giving her a second opportunity.
528100	530100	Perhaps when the warm season ends.
530100	532100	This film also includes the
532100	534100	late 80s, early 90s shopping montage
534100	536100	and it is set to a song called
536100	538100	Shopping Scream
538100	540100	Shop Shop Shop
540100	542100	Shopping Scream
542100	544100	Shop Shop Shop
544100	546100	It's good that the song is telling us what was going on
546100	548100	because I would have been really confused
548460	549460	otherwise.
549460	551460	She's gone crazy!
551460	553460	Look at these mortals!
553460	555460	Losers! Isn't this awesome?
556460	558460	Aphrodite is a recurring character in both
558460	560460	Hercules The Legendary Journeys
560460	562460	and Xeno Warrior Princess
562460	564460	and she wears pink a lot
564460	566460	because 90s.
572460	574460	This makes me yearn for the humble dignity
574460	576460	of Anna White.
576820	578820	Was that a boner?
581820	583820	Hercules is the more goofy of the two shows
583820	585820	but probably one of the best that captures
585820	587820	how petty and arbitrary and selfish
587820	589820	and self-aggrandizing the Greek gods are.
589820	591820	Aphrodite is all of these things.
591820	593820	Boring!
593820	595820	You bore me! These bore me!
595820	597820	Love bores me!
597820	599820	Despite that, she's one of the most likable.
599820	601820	More than anything, the Aphrodite
601820	603820	of Hercules The Legendary Journeys
603820	605820	reminds me of sheer horror wits from Clueless.
606180	608180	If the government could just get to the kitchen
608180	610180	rearrange some things, we could certainly
610180	612180	party with the Hadians.
612180	614180	Here she has a very early 90s idea
614180	616180	of what an idealized physical
616180	618180	beauty is.
618180	620180	Tubular! Which is funny to see her age into the
620180	622180	late 90s.
622180	624180	By late era, Xena, her look was pretty
624180	626180	dated, so they changed it up a bit.
626180	628180	Hephaestus is here too.
628180	630180	He's hot-ish in that he's not like
630180	632180	the ugliest ever, but he has a rad
632180	634180	face scar, as is Eros
634540	636540	who is called Cupid. Oh my god, oh my god
636540	638540	girl arm.
638540	640540	What up?
640540	642540	Look, get to the
642540	644540	point, mom. I'm real busy.
644540	646540	See? Young aspiring
646540	648540	actors never lose hope.
648540	650540	Aphrodite also has some of the best lines.
650540	652540	Aphrodite, you got her off!
652540	654540	And while she has a nice brother-sister
654540	656540	relationship in Hercules,
656540	658540	with Xena, it's more vain and bored
658540	660540	and spiteful and jealous of
660540	662540	Xena a lot, because women.
662540	664540	Her appearance is in Xena. At first, she's much
664540	666540	more into the whole cat fight and jealousy thing.
666540	668540	But on the plus side, she actually
668540	670540	has a character arc over the course of the series,
670540	672540	starting out as this, like,
672540	674540	spiteful, mercurial goddess
674540	676540	and eventually growing to give a shit about
676540	678540	mortals, specifically Gabrielle
678540	680540	my little one.
680540	682540	When eventually Xena starts killing
682540	684540	the Olympians, God of War style,
684540	686540	Xena got there first.
686540	688540	Aphrodite is not on her shit list and is
688540	690540	more of an ally. And by this point, she's
690540	692540	wearing her angry lingerie, so you know she
692540	694540	means business. See, she never
694540	696540	liked that Xena, but she likes Gabrielle,
696540	698540	so she's allowed to live into the
698540	700540	seasons where the show got really
700540	702540	squirrelly. Aphrodite is in the
702540	704540	original Clash of the Titans.
704540	706540	Barely. She's in the background
706540	708540	for a lot of it, but only has a handful
708540	710540	of lines.
710540	712540	But Zeus transformed himself into a glittering shower of gold
712540	714540	and visited her. Her big contribution
714540	716540	to the narrative is Perseus' awesome
716540	718540	new sword, and that's about it.
718540	720540	Well, she does get name dropped
720540	722540	during Medusa's backstory.
722540	724540	But she was seduced by Poseidon.
724540	726540	They made love in the temple
726540	728540	of Aphrodite. She transformed
728540	730540	her into an apparition
730540	732540	so horrible.
732540	734540	Yeah, seduced, so
734540	736540	that's what we're calling it.
736540	738540	The Adventures of Baron Munchausen
738540	740540	is...
740540	742540	it's
742540	744540	Terry Gilliam. It's very Terry Gilliam.
744540	746540	Venus is played by
746540	748540	Uma Thurman in her very first film
748540	750540	role.
750540	752540	The whole film is hung on the most
752540	754540	dreamlike of logic, so I will
754540	756540	try to explain it, so...
756540	758540	after Robin Williams'
758540	760540	giant floating head king of the
760540	762540	moon threatens our heroes for about
762540	764540	20 minutes, they fall off the moon
764540	766540	and land
766540	768540	inside Vulcan's volcano.
768540	770540	Hephaestus, here in the form of
770540	772540	Vulcan, then takes them to tea.
772540	774540	See what I mean when it sounds like someone's weird
774540	776540	dream? And Venus shows up once again
776540	778540	on her Birth of Venus clamshell, and
778540	780540	um...
780540	782540	I believe cucks is the word?
782540	784540	Well, what happens next is a
784540	786540	manosphere fever dream where she flirts
786540	788540	and dances with the Baron, while
788540	790540	nice guy Hephaestus goes unappreciated
790540	792540	even after all those diamonds he made for her.
792540	794540	Another diamond.
796540	798540	Every woman above the age of
798540	800540	nine in this movie gets the hots
800540	802540	for the Baron, and Vulcan is jealous.
802540	804540	And that is one of his traditional traits,
804540	806540	by the by. He is like the male
806540	808540	Hera, so bizarre as this movie
808540	810540	is, it ends up actually being one of
810540	812540	the more faithful to its original myth.
812540	814540	And because you jerks chose Aphrodite
814540	816540	that obligates me to finally
816540	818540	yes, I looked at God of War.
818540	820540	Thanks.
820540	822540	Kratos.
822540	824540	It's been far
824540	826540	too long.
826540	828540	God of War follows a demigod named Kratos
828540	830540	who is basically out to kill Zeus and
830540	832540	the Olympians, some of them,
832540	834540	because revenge and destiny and stuff.
834540	836540	In God of War 3, there is a
836540	838540	scene where he goes to Aphrodite and
838540	840540	finds her engaged with her handmaidens.
840540	842540	Come on, really?
842540	844540	The gods have
844540	846540	truly blessed you, Kratos.
846540	848540	This is like a parody.
848540	850540	I mean, it's totally
850540	852540	respectable and
852540	854540	not silly at all.
854540	856540	I have no time for games, Aphrodite.
856540	858540	Aphrodite tries
858540	860540	to seduce Kratos, but, you know, he's too
860540	862540	badass to be interested in women.
862540	864540	And then she tells him to do a thing, and then
864540	866540	I guess he's not too badass because the
866540	868540	player now has the option to be interested
868540	870540	and it cuts to this.
870540	872540	Ah,
872540	874540	I
874540	876540	grew jealous of our
876540	878540	mistress.
878540	880540	Such power.
880540	882540	If it's this good watching,
882540	884540	just imagine.
884540	886540	Is he
886540	888540	going to?
888540	890540	By the gods!
890540	892540	Usually if a woman says that
892540	894540	and responds to a man engaging in a sex act,
894540	896540	it's not
896540	898540	a good sign.
898540	900540	The magic of video
900540	902540	doesn't capture this, but DualShock actually
902540	904540	shakes with Kratos' thrust.
904540	906540	I'm actually
906540	908540	kind of surprised there are more depictions like this.
908540	910540	You men and young toys.
910540	912540	On occasion, Aphrodite appears
912540	914540	as a mentor figure.
914540	916540	2011's Ecupid was a
916540	918540	micro-budget gay romance about a
918540	920540	long-term relationship on the rocks.
920540	922540	How would you feel about some
922540	924540	words of wisdom from a gal who has seen a
924540	926540	thing or two?
926540	928540	Venus is played by Morgan Fairchild by way
928540	930540	of a strangely supernatural-ish
930540	932540	app who is here to give our
932540	934540	main character what he thinks he wants so he can learn
934540	936540	a valuable lesson about love.
936540	938540	What have you learned?
938540	940540	Venus is all about monogamy in this one.
940540	942540	The goddess aspect is subtexty.
942540	944540	The Ecupid software is created by
944540	946540	divinity and Venus is only
946540	948540	referred to as such in the credits.
948540	950540	And we don't actually see her until the end when
950540	952540	she appears as a helpful waitress
952540	954540	and she shows up to give us the moral
954540	956540	of the story.
956540	958540	What you know in your head
958540	960540	is what you feel in your heart.
960540	962540	The incredibly
962540	964540	vague moral of the story.
964540	966540	And of course there is the criminally
966540	968540	underrated Disney version, which is
968540	970540	the best one. No, I'm not biased.
970540	972540	Is Aphrodite in the 1997
972540	974540	movie that precedes it?
974540	976540	Well, technically.
976540	978540	Here, and again here,
978540	980540	and here,
980540	982540	and that's about it.
982540	984540	But she's one of the best things about the animated
984540	986540	series, which is one of the best things
986540	988540	Disney television ever did.
988540	990540	Aphrodite, Aphrodite,
990540	992540	Aphrodite!
992540	994540	The goddess of love!
994540	996540	She usually shows up when someone
996540	998540	beseeches the gods for something love-related.
998540	1000540	Oh, and she's voiced by Lisa Kudrow.
1000540	1002540	My best friend, Icarus, is in love
1002540	1004540	with my other best friend. Wait, wait, wait. Are they both human?
1004540	1006540	Uh, uh-huh. Just checking. Go on.
1006540	1008540	In one episode, Hades wants a
1008540	1010540	prophet, not to find out whether the taking
1010540	1012540	over Olympus thing will work out like he does
1012540	1014540	in the movie. Aphrodite!
1014540	1016540	Oh, sorry. But to find out if
1016540	1018540	Aphrodite will go out with him because he has a big crush
1018540	1020540	on her. I want to ask her out on a
1020540	1022540	date, but as you can probably imagine, I
1022540	1024540	don't handle rejection well. Making him probably the
1024540	1026540	only Disney villain who is actually
1026540	1028540	interested in a romantic relationship.
1028540	1030540	Well, you know, I mean,
1030540	1032540	a consensual one.
1032540	1034540	How did old man Pygmalion
1034540	1036540	land a vision like that?
1036540	1038540	There is a Galatea episode and she gets
1038540	1040540	involved there, where Hercules decides
1040540	1042540	to emulate Professor Pygmalion,
1042540	1044540	who is a character, in order
1044540	1046540	to get a date for the big dance.
1046540	1048540	Hercules wants a dream girl, but of
1048540	1050540	course the only attribute he cares about
1050540	1052540	and asks for are physical ones.
1052540	1054540	I really like tall girls.
1054540	1056540	Ugh.
1056540	1058540	And also that she's obsessed
1058540	1060540	with him. Oh, okay, so beautiful
1060540	1062540	and crazy about you. Good.
1062540	1064540	Diggin' deep, huh? Women are people too,
1064540	1066540	Hercules. And that's why
1066540	1068540	they don't like you. That was stupid.
1068540	1070540	Mm-hmm. And selfish. And shallow.
1070540	1072540	And sexist. Okay! She shows up again in
1072540	1074540	the Medusa episode in an ironic
1074540	1076540	role reversal. Here she's actually
1076540	1078540	helping her, if only in that typical
1078540	1080540	Disney love yourself the way
1080540	1082540	you are sort of way. Well, real
1082540	1084540	friends will like you for who you are, not
1084540	1086540	what you look like. And offers her glasses
1086540	1088540	that prevent her from turning people into
1088540	1090540	stone when they look at her, which Medusa
1090540	1092540	eventually comes around to, but not before
1092540	1094540	working for Hades for a little while first.
1094540	1096540	Orientation? I run a professional
1096540	1098540	organization. This episode
1098540	1100540	also has one of the best digs at the Disney
1100540	1102540	company in all of Disneydom. And we're
1102540	1104540	not employees. We're cast members.
1104540	1106540	Ugh. Modernizing Greek
1106540	1108540	myth is always a popular one.
1108540	1110540	She's not in the Percy Jackson series much.
1110540	1112540	There she is.
1112540	1114540	And her daughters are.
1114540	1116540	In a deleted scene.
1120540	1122540	Woof. I'd count that as a good
1122540	1124540	thing that this was cut, but
1124540	1126540	there's not much about these movies that are really
1126540	1128540	all that salvageable regardless.
1128540	1130540	And finally...
1130540	1132540	Everyone has a soulmate
1132540	1134540	somewhere in the world. Remember this?
1134540	1136540	Yeah, me neither.
1136540	1138540	Valentine was a CW show that aired in
1138540	1140540	2008, and it focused on
1140540	1142540	the Valentine family, a group of gods
1142540	1144540	living amongst humans in modern
1144540	1146540	day LA. Aphrodite
1146540	1148540	is the family matriarch who runs a matchmaking
1148540	1150540	company called Valentine Incorporated,
1150540	1152540	which brings soulmates together.
1152540	1154540	The employees of Valentine Incorporated
1154540	1156540	are a bunch of matchmaker gods who have to
1156540	1158540	keep their love god identity a secret
1158540	1160540	for some reason. But their god
1160540	1162540	methods just don't work in modern times,
1162540	1164540	which means trouble for these gods.
1168540	1170540	Mortals are constantly creating
1170540	1172540	substitutions for human interaction.
1172540	1174540	You see, if mortals don't start to
1174540	1176540	love properly, then the gods
1176540	1178540	start to become mortal.
1178540	1180540	Do you know what happens to gods who become relevant?
1184540	1186540	They become mortal. That's right.
1186540	1188540	The eternal gods of Olympus are becoming mortal
1188540	1190540	because of Snapchat.
1190540	1192540	Man, remember when women
1192540	1194540	were considered malformed versions
1194540	1196540	of men and were basically property?
1196540	1198540	We should go back to that.
1198540	1200540	That was when love was real.
1200540	1202540	As Greek god TV doesn't seem to sell well
1202540	1204540	looking at you, Hercules, the animated series,
1204540	1206540	this was cancelled after eight episodes.
1206540	1208540	So that's it for our look at Aphrodite,
1208540	1210540	a character who fluctuates with our
1210540	1212540	attitudes on sexy women throughout the decades
1212540	1214540	as well as who is
1214540	1216540	creating that image, be it Disney
1216540	1218540	or Terry Gilliam or...
1218540	1220540	Yeah, so
1220540	1222540	next episode, we are tossing
1222540	1224540	it up with the theme not being a person
1224540	1226540	but a thing, namely
1226540	1228540	a thing that happened. So here are your
1228540	1230540	options. You can vote for it here
1230540	1232540	and in the link below this video.
1232540	1234540	Should be interesting.
1234540	1236540	Thank you for watching and
1236540	1238540	see you next time.
