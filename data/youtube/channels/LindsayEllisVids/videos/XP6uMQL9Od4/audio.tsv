0	10560	My name is Bilbo Baggins.
10560	11560	Why not?
11560	19880	Much as I was disappointed in The Hobbit, it is hard to ignore that the industry climate
19880	24680	this Hydra was created in is very different from the industry that produced the Lord of
24680	29360	the Rings trilogy, which went into production thirteen years ago.
29360	34480	So the original trilogy kind of crossed the nostalgia border a little while ago.
34480	40580	So I kind of have to admit, my disappointment in The Hobbit stems largely from trends that
40580	43680	sprung up from the original trilogy.
43680	48200	The original franchise changed the way movies were packaged, filmed, marketed.
48200	52560	And if Transformers was the game change for modern film aesthetic and marketing, Lord
52560	56400	of the Rings was the game change for film franchise and marketing.
56440	62560	So for the next three episodes, we are going to look at the product, the content, the effect
62560	69280	on the industry and culture that was the original Lord of the Rings film trilogy, starting with
69280	77240	The Fellowship of the Ring, the best film, the most cohesive, well edited, and well written,
77240	80560	best adapted film of the three.
80560	81560	Shall we?
81560	89840	Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it.
89840	96520	Except for you, and that guy, and this guy, this other guy.
96520	99960	Okay, there are plenty of people who now live that remember it, but it was a cool line.
99960	102520	So let's talk a little bit about genre.
105480	108920	I've always found it a bit odd that fantasy and science fiction are lumped together in
108920	113240	the bookstore, frustrating even, as I would not consider myself much of a fantasy fan.
113240	119720	The two genres have a touch of an ideological split, and while obviously every individual
119720	124560	work has a different theme and purpose and level of originality, yada yada yada, the
124560	130280	basic gist is that fantasy is more history oriented and backwards looking, where science
130280	135760	fiction is more speculation and science oriented and forwards looking.
135760	137640	Obviously these things exist on a bit of a spectrum.
137640	140920	You look at something like Dune, which is sort of a weird futuristic slash historical
140920	145040	fiction that's very influenced by history and mythology, and the Dragon Riders of Pern
145040	148480	series, which is at least as sci-fi-ish as Star Wars was.
148480	154080	But fantasy as a genre has always been kind of limited by its influence, and that influence
154080	156440	in modern times has been one thing.
156440	157440	Bam!
157440	162160	The modern fantasy genre was heavily inspired by the works of Mr. Tolkien, and Mr. Tolkien
162160	165640	was heavily inspired by European languages and history.
165640	169680	Also, the western world, we just like Europe.
169680	175660	So as a result, fantasy is very rooted in European folklore and history.
175660	179640	Movies like Princess Mononoke, for instance, which incorporate lots of Japanese mythology,
179640	183920	yes, but they don't define the genre to western folks the same way something familiar
183920	187040	feeling like dragon heart or willow mite.
187040	191280	Fantasy is the realm of magical expansions of things that are already familiar in the
191280	192280	collective unconscious.
192280	199240	Castles, kings, dragons, fairies, magic, old beard guys, and pointy hats.
199240	202720	Fantasy is folkloric, and yeah, you can just pull stuff out of your ass and call it fantasy,
202720	207120	and I guess that would be true, but it's certainly not what comes to mind when people think of
207120	208120	genre.
208120	211800	Marketing is a very important component, especially when it comes to film.
211800	214980	As a result, there's not a lot of wiggle room for new ideas.
214980	218800	In film, fantasy has been the realm of the rehash of archetypes.
218800	222720	Sci-fi, on the other hand, while sci-fi has had plenty of dumb and pulpy shit, it's
222720	227120	also had plenty of opportunity to produce culture-changing, challenging cinematic masterworks
227120	235000	like Alien, 2001, A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner, D- wait, oh, also, sci-fi has Star Wars.
235000	243000	But wait, wait, you say, Star Wars is science-fantasy, it's got the force, it's not really science
243000	247620	fiction, and yeah, I might agree, but think again of Joanne and Cletus.
247620	249920	So what did fantasy have?
249920	252780	What were the great fantasy films?
252780	253780	Dragonheart?
253780	254780	Labyrinth?
254780	255780	Dragon Slayer?
255780	260020	Yeah, there was a bit of a fantasy craze in the 80s, fueled in part by the renaissance
260020	264060	of the works of Tolkien and subsequent underground rise of Dungeons and Dragons, but it stayed
264060	265960	pretty much underground.
265960	270220	Fantasy up to this point had been relegated to something of a low-art ghetto.
270220	272260	At best, fantasy films were cult classics.
272260	277100	You had a couple of failed attempts at big blockbusters, no serious successes.
277100	281540	At the end of the day, these suckers just didn't make much money, critics despised
281540	283780	them, and not a lot of people saw them.
283780	286900	Fantasy was a niche market, and even if Lord of the Rings was one of the best-selling books
286900	291820	of all time, that didn't necessarily mean that the public, Joanne and Cletus, wanted
291820	295700	to see a movie based on it.
295700	298380	Enter this guy.
298380	304100	And thus begins one of the most baffling film careers in Hollywood history.
304100	313780	Peter Jackson took a sort of Sam Raimi trajectory, as he started in the realm of extremely low-budget
313780	321900	horror films, but this man would go on to produce the most Oscar-winning film of all
321900	322900	time.
322900	327060	You can definitely see this, shall we say, preoccupation in some of the fight scenes
327060	329540	in Lord of the Rings.
329540	334900	The Peter Jackson oeuvre all throughout the 80s and early 90s was gross-out and goofy.
334900	338900	Then one day, Peach is all like, oh, 180, I'm gonna do a series art film.
338900	340900	Gina!
340900	342900	I'm coming!
342900	344900	I'm coming!
344900	349100	Heavenly Creatures was not only a critical darling, it also netted Peach an Oscar nomination
349100	353900	for Best Screenplay, started his career in earnest in Hollywood, and also this... lady.
353900	355460	I forget her name.
355460	358500	It also got him the attention of Miramax, who were the American distributors of the
358500	363740	film and at the time were helmed by Harvey Weinstein, who, for Peach, negotiated with
363740	367260	the producer who had held the film rights to Lord of the Rings since the 70s.
367260	371840	So Peach and his partner Fran presented to Miramax a two-film version of Lord of the
371840	375260	Rings, which was budgeted at $75 million.
375260	379740	But after a bunch more revisions, some, you know, number crunching, they realized that
379740	384780	the movies were really probably realistically gonna easily cost twice that for both of them.
384780	388420	So Miramax was like, make one movie.
388420	389420	Eesh.
389420	394380	So for contract reasons, Peach had about four weeks to shop this sucker around Hollywood
394380	398180	to find a studio that would actually let them make the two-movie pitch that they made.
398180	403020	Eventually, they landed at New Line, where Peach had a friend there named Mark Ardesky,
403020	407940	and Ardesky was very interested in the presentation, and he took the pitch on one condition, that
407940	409700	the two films be made into three.
414780	423660	The Lord of the Rings is a big-ass, sprawling, heavily detailed, many-charactered, often
423660	426240	meandering high-fantasy epic.
426240	430940	It is the story of a little hobbit named Frodo Baggins and his hundreds of billions of friends
430940	438580	who all fight in a war over a ring of power which is powerful and dangerous in some manner.
438580	441300	Frodo also falls down a lot.
444780	455060	Also, despite the fact that it is a high-fantasy epic, it's also the story of the everyman.
455060	457260	It works more naturally here due to the setup.
457260	460780	So often, it's hard to get the everyman into the protagonist slot because what business
460780	463780	does everyman having the doings of war and shit?
463780	467540	Ah, the great lengths some books and movies go to to get the coveted everyman into that
467540	469420	protagonist slot.
469420	473780	So often, you find that they are the products of some predetermined, destined, messianic
473780	480220	prophecy or whatever.
480220	485340	Someone barges in and tells them they've been Jesus the whole time.
485340	492940	Or sometimes it's just idiotic.
492940	499420	But the setup of the ring works very naturally for Frodo.
499420	500660	I get the ring.
500660	510940	I could become this, or this, you, worst case scenario, this, because you do not matter
510940	513020	and you have no power.
513020	517360	So because of the powerful, corrupting nature of this ring, only a non-powerful, unimportant
517360	518740	person can carry it.
518740	523060	But of course, as in any adaptation, they added a bunch of crap and they cut a bunch
523060	525060	of crap out.
525060	527900	So let's get this Tom Bombadil thing out of the way.
527900	530740	Hey, doll, merry doll.
530740	535300	So the hobbits are running for their lives, escaping the Shire, fleeing, and they meet
535300	540220	this weirdo in the woods and the plot just stops.
540220	544180	And they hang out and he's like a big-lipped alligator guy.
544180	547980	Hey, come, merry doll, derry doll, my darling.
547980	551740	And that it happens and then the hobbits leave and it's never brought up again.
551740	554600	Okay, yes, I know Gandalf brings him up at the council, but only to mention how he's
554600	556380	completely useless to their endeavor.
556380	560540	I feel like Bombadil made more sense in an earlier draft, where the adventures were more
560540	564860	episodic, like in The Hobbit, and then Tolkien was just so enamored with the character he
564860	565860	kept him in anyway.
565860	570220	See, Tom Bombadil sucks.
570220	573220	He's just a tension-destroying element.
573220	575700	I mean, he feels out of place even in the book.
575700	579340	I mean, for the most part, whenever a character comes into the book, they like pay off later
579340	583420	or pop back up at some point, but not this guy.
583420	584420	Nope.
584460	587540	Besides that, and the scouring of the Shire, which happens at the end of the third book,
587540	591160	they didn't cut out a whole lot.
591160	594740	Although there is one biggie that I remember people getting their panties in a real twist
594740	598420	about, and that is Arwen, warrior princess.
598420	603740	If you want him, come and claim him.
603740	608860	Which, well, originally Arwen and Eowyn were gonna be kind of mushed together into one
608860	613380	character when it was just one movie, and then when it got expanded into three, they
613420	617700	kind of kept the Arwen, warrior princess angle anyway, sort of.
617700	622100	You see it most pronounced when we first see Arwen, and she replaces Glorfindel, which,
622100	623100	yeah, why not?
623100	627140	You know, only action thing she does in all three movies, but then she pretty quickly
627140	632860	recedes into her original role in the book of passive elf lady, where all I do is sit
632860	636900	and look pretty and wait for my man and carry with me the wisdom of the ages.
636900	640540	You can see some scissor marks when it comes to Arwen's development.
640540	644660	They did film a bunch of the Arwen, warrior princess stuff, and after her big action scene,
644660	648940	she immediately retreats back into delicate ladyship and stays there for the rest of the
648940	654660	three movies with the elves, who are a touch racist.
654660	657660	It is in men that we misplace our hope.
657660	658660	Men.
658660	660660	Men are weak.
660660	661860	I hate those guys.
661860	663940	I do this one chump after my daughter.
663940	666180	I can't get rid of this guy.
666180	673120	Looks like it's time for a forced-pige conflict.
673120	675220	Not enough there in the source material.
675220	677300	Jam that conflict right in.
677300	682300	May or may not feel incredibly forced and contrived, but hey, it's a conflict.
682300	683300	Aragorn.
683300	686820	In the book, he's not very interesting.
686820	691980	I mean, in the book he's ready to step it up and be the hero king when the time comes.
691980	695220	He carries around the broken sword with him because symbolism.
695260	698260	He doesn't have very much in the way of internal conflict.
698260	702100	I mean, he does sometimes second-guess himself during the quest, but he doesn't have that
702100	706020	huge internal dilemma about whether he's even worthy to begin with.
706020	708020	So let's add one.
708020	711020	The same blood flows in my veins.
715020	717020	The same weakness.
717020	720340	Yeah, I guess if you've got Elrond raising you your whole life, bearing down on you about
720340	724820	how weak he thinks you are, then yeah, maybe you develop a bit of a complex.
724820	726620	She stays because she still has hope.
726620	728380	She stays for you.
728380	730020	She belongs with her people.
730020	731620	Do you understand?
731620	734920	You are not as good as me.
734920	738500	And also they added a bunch of crap with Aragorn and Arwen, but we'll get into that one next
738500	739580	time.
739580	744480	So not only does Elrond not believe in Aragorn and men in general, Aragorn doesn't believe
744480	745480	in himself.
745480	750660	You will face the same evil, and you will defeat it.
750700	755500	His men are prone to weakness and greed, and so Aragorn's subplot is basically a three-movie
755500	765620	long journey where he finds his confidence and overcomes his great-great-great-great-times-like-twenty-great-grandfather's-man-weakness conflict.
765620	769820	On the production end of things, Viggo Mortensen wasn't cast as Aragorn until a couple of days
769820	771780	after shooting started.
771780	775180	Aragorn was originally going to be played by...
775180	777180	Stuart Townsend?
777180	778180	As in...
781660	782660	Eugh.
782660	783660	Dodge that bullet.
783660	790340	But for the most part, all three films are pretty impeccably cast.
790340	798860	So I continue to kind of be bewildered by the casting of Hugo Weaving as ageless elf-lord
798860	799860	Elrond.
799860	810580	Oh, he's a fine actor, but compared to the other delicately featured elves, the figwits
810580	818540	the Legolai, the Arwins, rough, hard-edged, cranky-pants, craggy Hugo Weaving, he's a
818540	820460	touch out of place.
820460	823820	And you know who was rumored to want to play Elrond?
823820	825100	And they didn't cast him?
829100	831100	And you didn't cast him?
835100	839860	On the other end of the spectrum, you've got Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, and here they
839860	844260	didn't so much add a conflict as put the one that was already there on steroids.
844260	848020	In place of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen!
848020	851500	They also made her a little creepy, where in the book everyone adores her, here we get
851500	852500	some setup.
852500	853500	One was the guy.
853500	856500	I'm sorry, I didn't mean to freak you out.
856500	861500	Go to the foundations of the earth!
861500	863500	Frodo's reaction here is priceless.
863500	868780	Okay, jeez, I, uh, never mind.
868780	873020	Honestly, most of the goofy shit that feels kind of out of place in Fellowship was from
873020	875540	the book, and then roided up for the movie.
875540	877540	I'm not hurt.
877540	879540	You should be dead.
879540	880540	Wait, yeah!
880540	884020	Magic chain mail or no, buddy, how did you survive that?
884020	886540	And how do you get anywhere falling down as much as you do?
898780	901140	Don't you just make Boromir fall down, too?
901140	910300	Speaking of Boromir, I don't get the impression that Tolkien much
910300	912700	liked Boromir as a character.
912700	916580	In the book, like Aragorn, he's not terribly interesting, but he's also kind of a one-note
916580	917580	douchenozzle.
917580	921780	Yeah, he gets redeemed before he dies, sure, but his purpose was more or less a cautionary
921780	925100	app, see what happens when you get all power hungry?
925100	928060	You get orked.
928060	932700	Short hand of film language notwithstanding, movie Boromir is more dynamic, and with very
932700	934840	little change from the book, really.
934840	938660	They added a bit about how he's worried about his father's rule and how he doesn't want
938660	940300	Aragorn to be king.
940300	943300	Gondor has no king.
943300	946300	Gondor needs no king.
946300	950140	And then we find out that he's really just worried for his people, and he gets some bonding
950140	954320	moments with the hobbits that aren't contrived or ham-fisted, and then in the end he comes
954560	957560	around to Aragorn and this death scene, man.
957560	959560	All the people.
959560	964560	All the people.
964560	968560	Honestly, this, to me, is why Fellowship feels like the best movie.
968560	975560	The ending has the best build-up, the most sincere payoff, and it doesn't drag.
975560	977560	Okay.
977560	980560	Okay, this drags a little.
980560	982560	Okay, it drags a lot.
982800	984800	But the bit with Boromir doesn't.
984800	986800	My king.
986800	992800	But my big takeaway from Fellowship is that it's a study in successful adaptation.
992800	998800	I know they moved a lot of lines and scenes around, they cut shit out here, added it there,
998800	1002800	but ultimately it was to the benefit for the piece as a whole.
1002800	1006800	The filmmakers even found ways to sneak chapter titles into dialogue.
1006800	1007800	Shortcut to what?
1007800	1008800	The mushrooms!
1008800	1010800	Shadow and flame.
1011040	1013040	Riddles in the dark.
1013040	1017040	This film, more than the other two, does stay surprisingly close to the source material.
1017040	1022040	Hell, a lot of the stuff that feels like goofy shit they added just for the sake of action were actually in the book.
1022040	1024040	And, more importantly, drove the plot forward.
1024040	1026040	Ahem.
1026040	1033040	So back to the idea that fantasy has historically been kind of backwards-looking, history-oriented,
1033040	1040040	often even a little self-indulgent, it doesn't mean to say that it couldn't be done well.
1040280	1043280	It just hadn't been by that point.
1043280	1046280	Or, at the very least, it had not been commercially successful.
1046280	1048280	And it's kind of easy to see why.
1048280	1055280	It is hard to be genuinely, emotionally sincere about something that's just so out there.
1055280	1057280	Like the Balrog scene, for instance.
1057280	1060280	Even the dialogue is pretty much directly from the book.
1060280	1064280	And this could be so easily so goofy with dialogue like this.
1064280	1069280	I am a servant of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of Arnor.
1069520	1073520	The dark fire will never bail you, flame of Uldun!
1073520	1076520	But this is Sir Ian we're talking about.
1076520	1079520	Sir Ian's like, go hard or go home.
1079520	1084520	If we were to draw a graph of my process, of my method, something like this,
1084520	1087520	Sir Ian, Sir Ian, Sir Ian, action.
1087520	1090520	Wizard, you shall not pass! Cut!
1090520	1092520	Sir Ian, Sir Ian, Sir Ian.
1092520	1097520	So the fact that these films exist at all were a colliding of stars that weren't terribly likely.
1097760	1100760	That they'd be made with these people who, for the most part,
1100760	1103760	had good instincts adapting this material for a modern audience.
1103760	1106760	That the studio allowed them the freedom to make the film that they more or less wanted,
1106760	1109760	and that they were allowed to make three movies at all.
1109760	1113760	When you look at the way things are today, it's kind of ironic to think that they had to fight to get three.
1113760	1117760	But also the fact that these movies came out in the climate that they did.
1117760	1121760	Bellow Ship of the Ring came out not four months after 9-11.
1121760	1125760	We had just invaded Afghanistan, Iraq was right around the corner,
1126000	1131000	the world was changing, and suddenly the high, epic, simplistic world
1131000	1136000	of Tolkien's emotional sincerity didn't seem so unpalatable anymore.
1136000	1140000	We wanted that escapism, to go to the world of good versus evil,
1140000	1144000	where friends are truly good friends who truly love each other,
1144000	1148000	and the bad guys are genetically engineered for evil and ugly,
1148000	1153000	so we don't feel bad when they die, and you don't have to be ashamed of your hairy feet.
1153240	1157240	It is escapism, but it's high escapism.
1157240	1161240	And while it is difficult, incredibly difficult to do that well, or credibly,
1161240	1165240	as we found out, there was a place for that.
1165240	1169240	With Frodo on the ground.
