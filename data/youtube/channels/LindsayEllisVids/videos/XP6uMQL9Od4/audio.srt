1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,560
My name is Bilbo Baggins.

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,560
Why not?

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:19,880
Much as I was disappointed in The Hobbit, it is hard to ignore that the industry climate

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,680
this Hydra was created in is very different from the industry that produced the Lord of

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,360
the Rings trilogy, which went into production thirteen years ago.

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,480
So the original trilogy kind of crossed the nostalgia border a little while ago.

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,580
So I kind of have to admit, my disappointment in The Hobbit stems largely from trends that

8
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,680
sprung up from the original trilogy.

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,200
The original franchise changed the way movies were packaged, filmed, marketed.

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,560
And if Transformers was the game change for modern film aesthetic and marketing, Lord

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,400
of the Rings was the game change for film franchise and marketing.

12
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:02,560
So for the next three episodes, we are going to look at the product, the content, the effect

13
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:09,280
on the industry and culture that was the original Lord of the Rings film trilogy, starting with

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:17,240
The Fellowship of the Ring, the best film, the most cohesive, well edited, and well written,

15
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,560
best adapted film of the three.

16
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,560
Shall we?

17
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:29,840
Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it.

18
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,520
Except for you, and that guy, and this guy, this other guy.

19
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,960
Okay, there are plenty of people who now live that remember it, but it was a cool line.

20
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,520
So let's talk a little bit about genre.

21
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,920
I've always found it a bit odd that fantasy and science fiction are lumped together in

22
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,240
the bookstore, frustrating even, as I would not consider myself much of a fantasy fan.

23
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:59,720
The two genres have a touch of an ideological split, and while obviously every individual

24
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,560
work has a different theme and purpose and level of originality, yada yada yada, the

25
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,280
basic gist is that fantasy is more history oriented and backwards looking, where science

26
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,760
fiction is more speculation and science oriented and forwards looking.

27
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,640
Obviously these things exist on a bit of a spectrum.

28
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,920
You look at something like Dune, which is sort of a weird futuristic slash historical

29
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,040
fiction that's very influenced by history and mythology, and the Dragon Riders of Pern

30
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,480
series, which is at least as sci-fi-ish as Star Wars was.

31
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,080
But fantasy as a genre has always been kind of limited by its influence, and that influence

32
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,440
in modern times has been one thing.

33
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,440
Bam!

34
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,160
The modern fantasy genre was heavily inspired by the works of Mr. Tolkien, and Mr. Tolkien

35
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,640
was heavily inspired by European languages and history.

36
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,680
Also, the western world, we just like Europe.

37
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,660
So as a result, fantasy is very rooted in European folklore and history.

38
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,640
Movies like Princess Mononoke, for instance, which incorporate lots of Japanese mythology,

39
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,920
yes, but they don't define the genre to western folks the same way something familiar

40
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,040
feeling like dragon heart or willow mite.

41
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,280
Fantasy is the realm of magical expansions of things that are already familiar in the

42
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,280
collective unconscious.

43
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:19,240
Castles, kings, dragons, fairies, magic, old beard guys, and pointy hats.

44
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,720
Fantasy is folkloric, and yeah, you can just pull stuff out of your ass and call it fantasy,

45
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,120
and I guess that would be true, but it's certainly not what comes to mind when people think of

46
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
genre.

47
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,800
Marketing is a very important component, especially when it comes to film.

48
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,980
As a result, there's not a lot of wiggle room for new ideas.

49
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,800
In film, fantasy has been the realm of the rehash of archetypes.

50
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,720
Sci-fi, on the other hand, while sci-fi has had plenty of dumb and pulpy shit, it's

51
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,120
also had plenty of opportunity to produce culture-changing, challenging cinematic masterworks

52
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:55,000
like Alien, 2001, A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner, D- wait, oh, also, sci-fi has Star Wars.

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But wait, wait, you say, Star Wars is science-fantasy, it's got the force, it's not really science

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,620
fiction, and yeah, I might agree, but think again of Joanne and Cletus.

55
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,920
So what did fantasy have?

56
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,780
What were the great fantasy films?

57
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,780
Dragonheart?

58
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,780
Labyrinth?

59
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,780
Dragon Slayer?

60
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,020
Yeah, there was a bit of a fantasy craze in the 80s, fueled in part by the renaissance

61
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:24,060
of the works of Tolkien and subsequent underground rise of Dungeons and Dragons, but it stayed

62
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,960
pretty much underground.

63
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,220
Fantasy up to this point had been relegated to something of a low-art ghetto.

64
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,260
At best, fantasy films were cult classics.

65
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:37,100
You had a couple of failed attempts at big blockbusters, no serious successes.

66
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,540
At the end of the day, these suckers just didn't make much money, critics despised

67
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,780
them, and not a lot of people saw them.

68
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,900
Fantasy was a niche market, and even if Lord of the Rings was one of the best-selling books

69
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,820
of all time, that didn't necessarily mean that the public, Joanne and Cletus, wanted

70
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,700
to see a movie based on it.

71
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,380
Enter this guy.

72
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:04,100
And thus begins one of the most baffling film careers in Hollywood history.

73
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:13,780
Peter Jackson took a sort of Sam Raimi trajectory, as he started in the realm of extremely low-budget

74
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:21,900
horror films, but this man would go on to produce the most Oscar-winning film of all

75
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,900
time.

76
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,060
You can definitely see this, shall we say, preoccupation in some of the fight scenes

77
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,540
in Lord of the Rings.

78
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:34,900
The Peter Jackson oeuvre all throughout the 80s and early 90s was gross-out and goofy.

79
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,900
Then one day, Peach is all like, oh, 180, I'm gonna do a series art film.

80
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,900
Gina!

81
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,900
I'm coming!

82
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,900
I'm coming!

83
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,100
Heavenly Creatures was not only a critical darling, it also netted Peach an Oscar nomination

84
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,900
for Best Screenplay, started his career in earnest in Hollywood, and also this... lady.

85
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,460
I forget her name.

86
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,500
It also got him the attention of Miramax, who were the American distributors of the

87
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,740
film and at the time were helmed by Harvey Weinstein, who, for Peach, negotiated with

88
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,260
the producer who had held the film rights to Lord of the Rings since the 70s.

89
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,840
So Peach and his partner Fran presented to Miramax a two-film version of Lord of the

90
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,260
Rings, which was budgeted at $75 million.

91
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,740
But after a bunch more revisions, some, you know, number crunching, they realized that

92
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,780
the movies were really probably realistically gonna easily cost twice that for both of them.

93
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,420
So Miramax was like, make one movie.

94
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,420
Eesh.

95
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,380
So for contract reasons, Peach had about four weeks to shop this sucker around Hollywood

96
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,180
to find a studio that would actually let them make the two-movie pitch that they made.

97
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:43,020
Eventually, they landed at New Line, where Peach had a friend there named Mark Ardesky,

98
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,940
and Ardesky was very interested in the presentation, and he took the pitch on one condition, that

99
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,700
the two films be made into three.

100
00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:03,660
The Lord of the Rings is a big-ass, sprawling, heavily detailed, many-charactered, often

101
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,240
meandering high-fantasy epic.

102
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,940
It is the story of a little hobbit named Frodo Baggins and his hundreds of billions of friends

103
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:18,580
who all fight in a war over a ring of power which is powerful and dangerous in some manner.

104
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,300
Frodo also falls down a lot.

105
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:35,060
Also, despite the fact that it is a high-fantasy epic, it's also the story of the everyman.

106
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,260
It works more naturally here due to the setup.

107
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,780
So often, it's hard to get the everyman into the protagonist slot because what business

108
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,780
does everyman having the doings of war and shit?

109
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,540
Ah, the great lengths some books and movies go to to get the coveted everyman into that

110
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,420
protagonist slot.

111
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,780
So often, you find that they are the products of some predetermined, destined, messianic

112
00:07:53,780 --> 00:08:00,220
prophecy or whatever.

113
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:05,340
Someone barges in and tells them they've been Jesus the whole time.

114
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:12,940
Or sometimes it's just idiotic.

115
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:19,420
But the setup of the ring works very naturally for Frodo.

116
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,660
I get the ring.

117
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:30,940
I could become this, or this, you, worst case scenario, this, because you do not matter

118
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,020
and you have no power.

119
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,360
So because of the powerful, corrupting nature of this ring, only a non-powerful, unimportant

120
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,740
person can carry it.

121
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,060
But of course, as in any adaptation, they added a bunch of crap and they cut a bunch

122
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,060
of crap out.

123
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,900
So let's get this Tom Bombadil thing out of the way.

124
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,740
Hey, doll, merry doll.

125
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:55,300
So the hobbits are running for their lives, escaping the Shire, fleeing, and they meet

126
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:00,220
this weirdo in the woods and the plot just stops.

127
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,180
And they hang out and he's like a big-lipped alligator guy.

128
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,980
Hey, come, merry doll, derry doll, my darling.

129
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,740
And that it happens and then the hobbits leave and it's never brought up again.

130
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,600
Okay, yes, I know Gandalf brings him up at the council, but only to mention how he's

131
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,380
completely useless to their endeavor.

132
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,540
I feel like Bombadil made more sense in an earlier draft, where the adventures were more

133
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,860
episodic, like in The Hobbit, and then Tolkien was just so enamored with the character he

134
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,860
kept him in anyway.

135
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,220
See, Tom Bombadil sucks.

136
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,220
He's just a tension-destroying element.

137
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,700
I mean, he feels out of place even in the book.

138
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,340
I mean, for the most part, whenever a character comes into the book, they like pay off later

139
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,420
or pop back up at some point, but not this guy.

140
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,420
Nope.

141
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,540
Besides that, and the scouring of the Shire, which happens at the end of the third book,

142
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,160
they didn't cut out a whole lot.

143
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,740
Although there is one biggie that I remember people getting their panties in a real twist

144
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,420
about, and that is Arwen, warrior princess.

145
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:03,740
If you want him, come and claim him.

146
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,860
Which, well, originally Arwen and Eowyn were gonna be kind of mushed together into one

147
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,380
character when it was just one movie, and then when it got expanded into three, they

148
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,700
kind of kept the Arwen, warrior princess angle anyway, sort of.

149
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,100
You see it most pronounced when we first see Arwen, and she replaces Glorfindel, which,

150
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,100
yeah, why not?

151
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,140
You know, only action thing she does in all three movies, but then she pretty quickly

152
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:32,860
recedes into her original role in the book of passive elf lady, where all I do is sit

153
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,900
and look pretty and wait for my man and carry with me the wisdom of the ages.

154
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,540
You can see some scissor marks when it comes to Arwen's development.

155
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,660
They did film a bunch of the Arwen, warrior princess stuff, and after her big action scene,

156
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,940
she immediately retreats back into delicate ladyship and stays there for the rest of the

157
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:54,660
three movies with the elves, who are a touch racist.

158
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,660
It is in men that we misplace our hope.

159
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,660
Men.

160
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,660
Men are weak.

161
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,860
I hate those guys.

162
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,940
I do this one chump after my daughter.

163
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,180
I can't get rid of this guy.

164
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:13,120
Looks like it's time for a forced-pige conflict.

165
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,220
Not enough there in the source material.

166
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,300
Jam that conflict right in.

167
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,300
May or may not feel incredibly forced and contrived, but hey, it's a conflict.

168
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,300
Aragorn.

169
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,820
In the book, he's not very interesting.

170
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,980
I mean, in the book he's ready to step it up and be the hero king when the time comes.

171
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,220
He carries around the broken sword with him because symbolism.

172
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,260
He doesn't have very much in the way of internal conflict.

173
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,100
I mean, he does sometimes second-guess himself during the quest, but he doesn't have that

174
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,020
huge internal dilemma about whether he's even worthy to begin with.

175
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,020
So let's add one.

176
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:51,020
The same blood flows in my veins.

177
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,020
The same weakness.

178
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,340
Yeah, I guess if you've got Elrond raising you your whole life, bearing down on you about

179
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,820
how weak he thinks you are, then yeah, maybe you develop a bit of a complex.

180
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,620
She stays because she still has hope.

181
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,380
She stays for you.

182
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,020
She belongs with her people.

183
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,620
Do you understand?

184
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,920
You are not as good as me.

185
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,500
And also they added a bunch of crap with Aragorn and Arwen, but we'll get into that one next

186
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,580
time.

187
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:24,480
So not only does Elrond not believe in Aragorn and men in general, Aragorn doesn't believe

188
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,480
in himself.

189
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,660
You will face the same evil, and you will defeat it.

190
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,500
His men are prone to weakness and greed, and so Aragorn's subplot is basically a three-movie

191
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:45,620
long journey where he finds his confidence and overcomes his great-great-great-great-times-like-twenty-great-grandfather's-man-weakness conflict.

192
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,820
On the production end of things, Viggo Mortensen wasn't cast as Aragorn until a couple of days

193
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,780
after shooting started.

194
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,180
Aragorn was originally going to be played by...

195
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,180
Stuart Townsend?

196
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,180
As in...

197
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,660
Eugh.

198
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,660
Dodge that bullet.

199
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:10,340
But for the most part, all three films are pretty impeccably cast.

200
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:18,860
So I continue to kind of be bewildered by the casting of Hugo Weaving as ageless elf-lord

201
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,860
Elrond.

202
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:30,580
Oh, he's a fine actor, but compared to the other delicately featured elves, the figwits

203
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:38,540
the Legolai, the Arwins, rough, hard-edged, cranky-pants, craggy Hugo Weaving, he's a

204
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,460
touch out of place.

205
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,820
And you know who was rumored to want to play Elrond?

206
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,100
And they didn't cast him?

207
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,100
And you didn't cast him?

208
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,860
On the other end of the spectrum, you've got Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, and here they

209
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:04,260
didn't so much add a conflict as put the one that was already there on steroids.

210
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:08,020
In place of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen!

211
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,500
They also made her a little creepy, where in the book everyone adores her, here we get

212
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,500
some setup.

213
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,500
One was the guy.

214
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,500
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to freak you out.

215
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Go to the foundations of the earth!

216
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Frodo's reaction here is priceless.

217
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,780
Okay, jeez, I, uh, never mind.

218
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:33,020
Honestly, most of the goofy shit that feels kind of out of place in Fellowship was from

219
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,540
the book, and then roided up for the movie.

220
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,540
I'm not hurt.

221
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,540
You should be dead.

222
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,540
Wait, yeah!

223
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,020
Magic chain mail or no, buddy, how did you survive that?

224
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,540
And how do you get anywhere falling down as much as you do?

225
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,140
Don't you just make Boromir fall down, too?

226
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:10,300
Speaking of Boromir, I don't get the impression that Tolkien much

227
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,700
liked Boromir as a character.

228
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,580
In the book, like Aragorn, he's not terribly interesting, but he's also kind of a one-note

229
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,580
douchenozzle.

230
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,780
Yeah, he gets redeemed before he dies, sure, but his purpose was more or less a cautionary

231
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:25,100
app, see what happens when you get all power hungry?

232
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,060
You get orked.

233
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,700
Short hand of film language notwithstanding, movie Boromir is more dynamic, and with very

234
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,840
little change from the book, really.

235
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,660
They added a bit about how he's worried about his father's rule and how he doesn't want

236
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,300
Aragorn to be king.

237
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,300
Gondor has no king.

238
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,300
Gondor needs no king.

239
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,140
And then we find out that he's really just worried for his people, and he gets some bonding

240
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:54,320
moments with the hobbits that aren't contrived or ham-fisted, and then in the end he comes

241
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,560
around to Aragorn and this death scene, man.

242
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,560
All the people.

243
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,560
All the people.

244
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,560
Honestly, this, to me, is why Fellowship feels like the best movie.

245
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:15,560
The ending has the best build-up, the most sincere payoff, and it doesn't drag.

246
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,560
Okay.

247
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,560
Okay, this drags a little.

248
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
Okay, it drags a lot.

249
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
But the bit with Boromir doesn't.

250
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
My king.

251
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,800
But my big takeaway from Fellowship is that it's a study in successful adaptation.

252
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,800
I know they moved a lot of lines and scenes around, they cut shit out here, added it there,

253
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,800
but ultimately it was to the benefit for the piece as a whole.

254
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,800
The filmmakers even found ways to sneak chapter titles into dialogue.

255
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
Shortcut to what?

256
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
The mushrooms!

257
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Shadow and flame.

258
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,040
Riddles in the dark.

259
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,040
This film, more than the other two, does stay surprisingly close to the source material.

260
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,040
Hell, a lot of the stuff that feels like goofy shit they added just for the sake of action were actually in the book.

261
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,040
And, more importantly, drove the plot forward.

262
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,040
Ahem.

263
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:13,040
So back to the idea that fantasy has historically been kind of backwards-looking, history-oriented,

264
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:20,040
often even a little self-indulgent, it doesn't mean to say that it couldn't be done well.

265
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,280
It just hadn't been by that point.

266
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,280
Or, at the very least, it had not been commercially successful.

267
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,280
And it's kind of easy to see why.

268
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:35,280
It is hard to be genuinely, emotionally sincere about something that's just so out there.

269
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,280
Like the Balrog scene, for instance.

270
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,280
Even the dialogue is pretty much directly from the book.

271
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,280
And this could be so easily so goofy with dialogue like this.

272
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,280
I am a servant of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of Arnor.

273
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,520
The dark fire will never bail you, flame of Uldun!

274
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,520
But this is Sir Ian we're talking about.

275
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,520
Sir Ian's like, go hard or go home.

276
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,520
If we were to draw a graph of my process, of my method, something like this,

277
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,520
Sir Ian, Sir Ian, Sir Ian, action.

278
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,520
Wizard, you shall not pass! Cut!

279
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,520
Sir Ian, Sir Ian, Sir Ian.

280
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,520
So the fact that these films exist at all were a colliding of stars that weren't terribly likely.

281
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,760
That they'd be made with these people who, for the most part,

282
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,760
had good instincts adapting this material for a modern audience.

283
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,760
That the studio allowed them the freedom to make the film that they more or less wanted,

284
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,760
and that they were allowed to make three movies at all.

285
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,760
When you look at the way things are today, it's kind of ironic to think that they had to fight to get three.

286
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,760
But also the fact that these movies came out in the climate that they did.

287
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,760
Bellow Ship of the Ring came out not four months after 9-11.

288
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,760
We had just invaded Afghanistan, Iraq was right around the corner,

289
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
the world was changing, and suddenly the high, epic, simplistic world

290
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
of Tolkien's emotional sincerity didn't seem so unpalatable anymore.

291
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
We wanted that escapism, to go to the world of good versus evil,

292
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
where friends are truly good friends who truly love each other,

293
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
and the bad guys are genetically engineered for evil and ugly,

294
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
so we don't feel bad when they die, and you don't have to be ashamed of your hairy feet.

295
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,240
It is escapism, but it's high escapism.

296
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,240
And while it is difficult, incredibly difficult to do that well, or credibly,

297
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,240
as we found out, there was a place for that.

298
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,240
With Frodo on the ground.
