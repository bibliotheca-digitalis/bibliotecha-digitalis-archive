WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.560
My name is Bilbo Baggins.

00:10.560 --> 00:11.560
Why not?

00:11.560 --> 00:19.880
Much as I was disappointed in The Hobbit, it is hard to ignore that the industry climate

00:19.880 --> 00:24.680
this Hydra was created in is very different from the industry that produced the Lord of

00:24.680 --> 00:29.360
the Rings trilogy, which went into production thirteen years ago.

00:29.360 --> 00:34.480
So the original trilogy kind of crossed the nostalgia border a little while ago.

00:34.480 --> 00:40.580
So I kind of have to admit, my disappointment in The Hobbit stems largely from trends that

00:40.580 --> 00:43.680
sprung up from the original trilogy.

00:43.680 --> 00:48.200
The original franchise changed the way movies were packaged, filmed, marketed.

00:48.200 --> 00:52.560
And if Transformers was the game change for modern film aesthetic and marketing, Lord

00:52.560 --> 00:56.400
of the Rings was the game change for film franchise and marketing.

00:56.440 --> 01:02.560
So for the next three episodes, we are going to look at the product, the content, the effect

01:02.560 --> 01:09.280
on the industry and culture that was the original Lord of the Rings film trilogy, starting with

01:09.280 --> 01:17.240
The Fellowship of the Ring, the best film, the most cohesive, well edited, and well written,

01:17.240 --> 01:20.560
best adapted film of the three.

01:20.560 --> 01:21.560
Shall we?

01:21.560 --> 01:29.840
Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it.

01:29.840 --> 01:36.520
Except for you, and that guy, and this guy, this other guy.

01:36.520 --> 01:39.960
Okay, there are plenty of people who now live that remember it, but it was a cool line.

01:39.960 --> 01:42.520
So let's talk a little bit about genre.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.920
I've always found it a bit odd that fantasy and science fiction are lumped together in

01:48.920 --> 01:53.240
the bookstore, frustrating even, as I would not consider myself much of a fantasy fan.

01:53.240 --> 01:59.720
The two genres have a touch of an ideological split, and while obviously every individual

01:59.720 --> 02:04.560
work has a different theme and purpose and level of originality, yada yada yada, the

02:04.560 --> 02:10.280
basic gist is that fantasy is more history oriented and backwards looking, where science

02:10.280 --> 02:15.760
fiction is more speculation and science oriented and forwards looking.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.640
Obviously these things exist on a bit of a spectrum.

02:17.640 --> 02:20.920
You look at something like Dune, which is sort of a weird futuristic slash historical

02:20.920 --> 02:25.040
fiction that's very influenced by history and mythology, and the Dragon Riders of Pern

02:25.040 --> 02:28.480
series, which is at least as sci-fi-ish as Star Wars was.

02:28.480 --> 02:34.080
But fantasy as a genre has always been kind of limited by its influence, and that influence

02:34.080 --> 02:36.440
in modern times has been one thing.

02:36.440 --> 02:37.440
Bam!

02:37.440 --> 02:42.160
The modern fantasy genre was heavily inspired by the works of Mr. Tolkien, and Mr. Tolkien

02:42.160 --> 02:45.640
was heavily inspired by European languages and history.

02:45.640 --> 02:49.680
Also, the western world, we just like Europe.

02:49.680 --> 02:55.660
So as a result, fantasy is very rooted in European folklore and history.

02:55.660 --> 02:59.640
Movies like Princess Mononoke, for instance, which incorporate lots of Japanese mythology,

02:59.640 --> 03:03.920
yes, but they don't define the genre to western folks the same way something familiar

03:03.920 --> 03:07.040
feeling like dragon heart or willow mite.

03:07.040 --> 03:11.280
Fantasy is the realm of magical expansions of things that are already familiar in the

03:11.280 --> 03:12.280
collective unconscious.

03:12.280 --> 03:19.240
Castles, kings, dragons, fairies, magic, old beard guys, and pointy hats.

03:19.240 --> 03:22.720
Fantasy is folkloric, and yeah, you can just pull stuff out of your ass and call it fantasy,

03:22.720 --> 03:27.120
and I guess that would be true, but it's certainly not what comes to mind when people think of

03:27.120 --> 03:28.120
genre.

03:28.120 --> 03:31.800
Marketing is a very important component, especially when it comes to film.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.980
As a result, there's not a lot of wiggle room for new ideas.

03:34.980 --> 03:38.800
In film, fantasy has been the realm of the rehash of archetypes.

03:38.800 --> 03:42.720
Sci-fi, on the other hand, while sci-fi has had plenty of dumb and pulpy shit, it's

03:42.720 --> 03:47.120
also had plenty of opportunity to produce culture-changing, challenging cinematic masterworks

03:47.120 --> 03:55.000
like Alien, 2001, A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner, D- wait, oh, also, sci-fi has Star Wars.

03:55.000 --> 04:03.000
But wait, wait, you say, Star Wars is science-fantasy, it's got the force, it's not really science

04:03.000 --> 04:07.620
fiction, and yeah, I might agree, but think again of Joanne and Cletus.

04:07.620 --> 04:09.920
So what did fantasy have?

04:09.920 --> 04:12.780
What were the great fantasy films?

04:12.780 --> 04:13.780
Dragonheart?

04:13.780 --> 04:14.780
Labyrinth?

04:14.780 --> 04:15.780
Dragon Slayer?

04:15.780 --> 04:20.020
Yeah, there was a bit of a fantasy craze in the 80s, fueled in part by the renaissance

04:20.020 --> 04:24.060
of the works of Tolkien and subsequent underground rise of Dungeons and Dragons, but it stayed

04:24.060 --> 04:25.960
pretty much underground.

04:25.960 --> 04:30.220
Fantasy up to this point had been relegated to something of a low-art ghetto.

04:30.220 --> 04:32.260
At best, fantasy films were cult classics.

04:32.260 --> 04:37.100
You had a couple of failed attempts at big blockbusters, no serious successes.

04:37.100 --> 04:41.540
At the end of the day, these suckers just didn't make much money, critics despised

04:41.540 --> 04:43.780
them, and not a lot of people saw them.

04:43.780 --> 04:46.900
Fantasy was a niche market, and even if Lord of the Rings was one of the best-selling books

04:46.900 --> 04:51.820
of all time, that didn't necessarily mean that the public, Joanne and Cletus, wanted

04:51.820 --> 04:55.700
to see a movie based on it.

04:55.700 --> 04:58.380
Enter this guy.

04:58.380 --> 05:04.100
And thus begins one of the most baffling film careers in Hollywood history.

05:04.100 --> 05:13.780
Peter Jackson took a sort of Sam Raimi trajectory, as he started in the realm of extremely low-budget

05:13.780 --> 05:21.900
horror films, but this man would go on to produce the most Oscar-winning film of all

05:21.900 --> 05:22.900
time.

05:22.900 --> 05:27.060
You can definitely see this, shall we say, preoccupation in some of the fight scenes

05:27.060 --> 05:29.540
in Lord of the Rings.

05:29.540 --> 05:34.900
The Peter Jackson oeuvre all throughout the 80s and early 90s was gross-out and goofy.

05:34.900 --> 05:38.900
Then one day, Peach is all like, oh, 180, I'm gonna do a series art film.

05:38.900 --> 05:40.900
Gina!

05:40.900 --> 05:42.900
I'm coming!

05:42.900 --> 05:44.900
I'm coming!

05:44.900 --> 05:49.100
Heavenly Creatures was not only a critical darling, it also netted Peach an Oscar nomination

05:49.100 --> 05:53.900
for Best Screenplay, started his career in earnest in Hollywood, and also this... lady.

05:53.900 --> 05:55.460
I forget her name.

05:55.460 --> 05:58.500
It also got him the attention of Miramax, who were the American distributors of the

05:58.500 --> 06:03.740
film and at the time were helmed by Harvey Weinstein, who, for Peach, negotiated with

06:03.740 --> 06:07.260
the producer who had held the film rights to Lord of the Rings since the 70s.

06:07.260 --> 06:11.840
So Peach and his partner Fran presented to Miramax a two-film version of Lord of the

06:11.840 --> 06:15.260
Rings, which was budgeted at $75 million.

06:15.260 --> 06:19.740
But after a bunch more revisions, some, you know, number crunching, they realized that

06:19.740 --> 06:24.780
the movies were really probably realistically gonna easily cost twice that for both of them.

06:24.780 --> 06:28.420
So Miramax was like, make one movie.

06:28.420 --> 06:29.420
Eesh.

06:29.420 --> 06:34.380
So for contract reasons, Peach had about four weeks to shop this sucker around Hollywood

06:34.380 --> 06:38.180
to find a studio that would actually let them make the two-movie pitch that they made.

06:38.180 --> 06:43.020
Eventually, they landed at New Line, where Peach had a friend there named Mark Ardesky,

06:43.020 --> 06:47.940
and Ardesky was very interested in the presentation, and he took the pitch on one condition, that

06:47.940 --> 06:49.700
the two films be made into three.

06:54.780 --> 07:03.660
The Lord of the Rings is a big-ass, sprawling, heavily detailed, many-charactered, often

07:03.660 --> 07:06.240
meandering high-fantasy epic.

07:06.240 --> 07:10.940
It is the story of a little hobbit named Frodo Baggins and his hundreds of billions of friends

07:10.940 --> 07:18.580
who all fight in a war over a ring of power which is powerful and dangerous in some manner.

07:18.580 --> 07:21.300
Frodo also falls down a lot.

07:24.780 --> 07:35.060
Also, despite the fact that it is a high-fantasy epic, it's also the story of the everyman.

07:35.060 --> 07:37.260
It works more naturally here due to the setup.

07:37.260 --> 07:40.780
So often, it's hard to get the everyman into the protagonist slot because what business

07:40.780 --> 07:43.780
does everyman having the doings of war and shit?

07:43.780 --> 07:47.540
Ah, the great lengths some books and movies go to to get the coveted everyman into that

07:47.540 --> 07:49.420
protagonist slot.

07:49.420 --> 07:53.780
So often, you find that they are the products of some predetermined, destined, messianic

07:53.780 --> 08:00.220
prophecy or whatever.

08:00.220 --> 08:05.340
Someone barges in and tells them they've been Jesus the whole time.

08:05.340 --> 08:12.940
Or sometimes it's just idiotic.

08:12.940 --> 08:19.420
But the setup of the ring works very naturally for Frodo.

08:19.420 --> 08:20.660
I get the ring.

08:20.660 --> 08:30.940
I could become this, or this, you, worst case scenario, this, because you do not matter

08:30.940 --> 08:33.020
and you have no power.

08:33.020 --> 08:37.360
So because of the powerful, corrupting nature of this ring, only a non-powerful, unimportant

08:37.360 --> 08:38.740
person can carry it.

08:38.740 --> 08:43.060
But of course, as in any adaptation, they added a bunch of crap and they cut a bunch

08:43.060 --> 08:45.060
of crap out.

08:45.060 --> 08:47.900
So let's get this Tom Bombadil thing out of the way.

08:47.900 --> 08:50.740
Hey, doll, merry doll.

08:50.740 --> 08:55.300
So the hobbits are running for their lives, escaping the Shire, fleeing, and they meet

08:55.300 --> 09:00.220
this weirdo in the woods and the plot just stops.

09:00.220 --> 09:04.180
And they hang out and he's like a big-lipped alligator guy.

09:04.180 --> 09:07.980
Hey, come, merry doll, derry doll, my darling.

09:07.980 --> 09:11.740
And that it happens and then the hobbits leave and it's never brought up again.

09:11.740 --> 09:14.600
Okay, yes, I know Gandalf brings him up at the council, but only to mention how he's

09:14.600 --> 09:16.380
completely useless to their endeavor.

09:16.380 --> 09:20.540
I feel like Bombadil made more sense in an earlier draft, where the adventures were more

09:20.540 --> 09:24.860
episodic, like in The Hobbit, and then Tolkien was just so enamored with the character he

09:24.860 --> 09:25.860
kept him in anyway.

09:25.860 --> 09:30.220
See, Tom Bombadil sucks.

09:30.220 --> 09:33.220
He's just a tension-destroying element.

09:33.220 --> 09:35.700
I mean, he feels out of place even in the book.

09:35.700 --> 09:39.340
I mean, for the most part, whenever a character comes into the book, they like pay off later

09:39.340 --> 09:43.420
or pop back up at some point, but not this guy.

09:43.420 --> 09:44.420
Nope.

09:44.460 --> 09:47.540
Besides that, and the scouring of the Shire, which happens at the end of the third book,

09:47.540 --> 09:51.160
they didn't cut out a whole lot.

09:51.160 --> 09:54.740
Although there is one biggie that I remember people getting their panties in a real twist

09:54.740 --> 09:58.420
about, and that is Arwen, warrior princess.

09:58.420 --> 10:03.740
If you want him, come and claim him.

10:03.740 --> 10:08.860
Which, well, originally Arwen and Eowyn were gonna be kind of mushed together into one

10:08.860 --> 10:13.380
character when it was just one movie, and then when it got expanded into three, they

10:13.420 --> 10:17.700
kind of kept the Arwen, warrior princess angle anyway, sort of.

10:17.700 --> 10:22.100
You see it most pronounced when we first see Arwen, and she replaces Glorfindel, which,

10:22.100 --> 10:23.100
yeah, why not?

10:23.100 --> 10:27.140
You know, only action thing she does in all three movies, but then she pretty quickly

10:27.140 --> 10:32.860
recedes into her original role in the book of passive elf lady, where all I do is sit

10:32.860 --> 10:36.900
and look pretty and wait for my man and carry with me the wisdom of the ages.

10:36.900 --> 10:40.540
You can see some scissor marks when it comes to Arwen's development.

10:40.540 --> 10:44.660
They did film a bunch of the Arwen, warrior princess stuff, and after her big action scene,

10:44.660 --> 10:48.940
she immediately retreats back into delicate ladyship and stays there for the rest of the

10:48.940 --> 10:54.660
three movies with the elves, who are a touch racist.

10:54.660 --> 10:57.660
It is in men that we misplace our hope.

10:57.660 --> 10:58.660
Men.

10:58.660 --> 11:00.660
Men are weak.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.860
I hate those guys.

11:01.860 --> 11:03.940
I do this one chump after my daughter.

11:03.940 --> 11:06.180
I can't get rid of this guy.

11:06.180 --> 11:13.120
Looks like it's time for a forced-pige conflict.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.220
Not enough there in the source material.

11:15.220 --> 11:17.300
Jam that conflict right in.

11:17.300 --> 11:22.300
May or may not feel incredibly forced and contrived, but hey, it's a conflict.

11:22.300 --> 11:23.300
Aragorn.

11:23.300 --> 11:26.820
In the book, he's not very interesting.

11:26.820 --> 11:31.980
I mean, in the book he's ready to step it up and be the hero king when the time comes.

11:31.980 --> 11:35.220
He carries around the broken sword with him because symbolism.

11:35.260 --> 11:38.260
He doesn't have very much in the way of internal conflict.

11:38.260 --> 11:42.100
I mean, he does sometimes second-guess himself during the quest, but he doesn't have that

11:42.100 --> 11:46.020
huge internal dilemma about whether he's even worthy to begin with.

11:46.020 --> 11:48.020
So let's add one.

11:48.020 --> 11:51.020
The same blood flows in my veins.

11:55.020 --> 11:57.020
The same weakness.

11:57.020 --> 12:00.340
Yeah, I guess if you've got Elrond raising you your whole life, bearing down on you about

12:00.340 --> 12:04.820
how weak he thinks you are, then yeah, maybe you develop a bit of a complex.

12:04.820 --> 12:06.620
She stays because she still has hope.

12:06.620 --> 12:08.380
She stays for you.

12:08.380 --> 12:10.020
She belongs with her people.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.620
Do you understand?

12:11.620 --> 12:14.920
You are not as good as me.

12:14.920 --> 12:18.500
And also they added a bunch of crap with Aragorn and Arwen, but we'll get into that one next

12:18.500 --> 12:19.580
time.

12:19.580 --> 12:24.480
So not only does Elrond not believe in Aragorn and men in general, Aragorn doesn't believe

12:24.480 --> 12:25.480
in himself.

12:25.480 --> 12:30.660
You will face the same evil, and you will defeat it.

12:30.700 --> 12:35.500
His men are prone to weakness and greed, and so Aragorn's subplot is basically a three-movie

12:35.500 --> 12:45.620
long journey where he finds his confidence and overcomes his great-great-great-great-times-like-twenty-great-grandfather's-man-weakness conflict.

12:45.620 --> 12:49.820
On the production end of things, Viggo Mortensen wasn't cast as Aragorn until a couple of days

12:49.820 --> 12:51.780
after shooting started.

12:51.780 --> 12:55.180
Aragorn was originally going to be played by...

12:55.180 --> 12:57.180
Stuart Townsend?

12:57.180 --> 12:58.180
As in...

13:01.660 --> 13:02.660
Eugh.

13:02.660 --> 13:03.660
Dodge that bullet.

13:03.660 --> 13:10.340
But for the most part, all three films are pretty impeccably cast.

13:10.340 --> 13:18.860
So I continue to kind of be bewildered by the casting of Hugo Weaving as ageless elf-lord

13:18.860 --> 13:19.860
Elrond.

13:19.860 --> 13:30.580
Oh, he's a fine actor, but compared to the other delicately featured elves, the figwits

13:30.580 --> 13:38.540
the Legolai, the Arwins, rough, hard-edged, cranky-pants, craggy Hugo Weaving, he's a

13:38.540 --> 13:40.460
touch out of place.

13:40.460 --> 13:43.820
And you know who was rumored to want to play Elrond?

13:43.820 --> 13:45.100
And they didn't cast him?

13:49.100 --> 13:51.100
And you didn't cast him?

13:55.100 --> 13:59.860
On the other end of the spectrum, you've got Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, and here they

13:59.860 --> 14:04.260
didn't so much add a conflict as put the one that was already there on steroids.

14:04.260 --> 14:08.020
In place of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen!

14:08.020 --> 14:11.500
They also made her a little creepy, where in the book everyone adores her, here we get

14:11.500 --> 14:12.500
some setup.

14:12.500 --> 14:13.500
One was the guy.

14:13.500 --> 14:16.500
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to freak you out.

14:16.500 --> 14:21.500
Go to the foundations of the earth!

14:21.500 --> 14:23.500
Frodo's reaction here is priceless.

14:23.500 --> 14:28.780
Okay, jeez, I, uh, never mind.

14:28.780 --> 14:33.020
Honestly, most of the goofy shit that feels kind of out of place in Fellowship was from

14:33.020 --> 14:35.540
the book, and then roided up for the movie.

14:35.540 --> 14:37.540
I'm not hurt.

14:37.540 --> 14:39.540
You should be dead.

14:39.540 --> 14:40.540
Wait, yeah!

14:40.540 --> 14:44.020
Magic chain mail or no, buddy, how did you survive that?

14:44.020 --> 14:46.540
And how do you get anywhere falling down as much as you do?

14:58.780 --> 15:01.140
Don't you just make Boromir fall down, too?

15:01.140 --> 15:10.300
Speaking of Boromir, I don't get the impression that Tolkien much

15:10.300 --> 15:12.700
liked Boromir as a character.

15:12.700 --> 15:16.580
In the book, like Aragorn, he's not terribly interesting, but he's also kind of a one-note

15:16.580 --> 15:17.580
douchenozzle.

15:17.580 --> 15:21.780
Yeah, he gets redeemed before he dies, sure, but his purpose was more or less a cautionary

15:21.780 --> 15:25.100
app, see what happens when you get all power hungry?

15:25.100 --> 15:28.060
You get orked.

15:28.060 --> 15:32.700
Short hand of film language notwithstanding, movie Boromir is more dynamic, and with very

15:32.700 --> 15:34.840
little change from the book, really.

15:34.840 --> 15:38.660
They added a bit about how he's worried about his father's rule and how he doesn't want

15:38.660 --> 15:40.300
Aragorn to be king.

15:40.300 --> 15:43.300
Gondor has no king.

15:43.300 --> 15:46.300
Gondor needs no king.

15:46.300 --> 15:50.140
And then we find out that he's really just worried for his people, and he gets some bonding

15:50.140 --> 15:54.320
moments with the hobbits that aren't contrived or ham-fisted, and then in the end he comes

15:54.560 --> 15:57.560
around to Aragorn and this death scene, man.

15:57.560 --> 15:59.560
All the people.

15:59.560 --> 16:04.560
All the people.

16:04.560 --> 16:08.560
Honestly, this, to me, is why Fellowship feels like the best movie.

16:08.560 --> 16:15.560
The ending has the best build-up, the most sincere payoff, and it doesn't drag.

16:15.560 --> 16:17.560
Okay.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.560
Okay, this drags a little.

16:20.560 --> 16:22.560
Okay, it drags a lot.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.800
But the bit with Boromir doesn't.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.800
My king.

16:26.800 --> 16:32.800
But my big takeaway from Fellowship is that it's a study in successful adaptation.

16:32.800 --> 16:38.800
I know they moved a lot of lines and scenes around, they cut shit out here, added it there,

16:38.800 --> 16:42.800
but ultimately it was to the benefit for the piece as a whole.

16:42.800 --> 16:46.800
The filmmakers even found ways to sneak chapter titles into dialogue.

16:46.800 --> 16:47.800
Shortcut to what?

16:47.800 --> 16:48.800
The mushrooms!

16:48.800 --> 16:50.800
Shadow and flame.

16:51.040 --> 16:53.040
Riddles in the dark.

16:53.040 --> 16:57.040
This film, more than the other two, does stay surprisingly close to the source material.

16:57.040 --> 17:02.040
Hell, a lot of the stuff that feels like goofy shit they added just for the sake of action were actually in the book.

17:02.040 --> 17:04.040
And, more importantly, drove the plot forward.

17:04.040 --> 17:06.040
Ahem.

17:06.040 --> 17:13.040
So back to the idea that fantasy has historically been kind of backwards-looking, history-oriented,

17:13.040 --> 17:20.040
often even a little self-indulgent, it doesn't mean to say that it couldn't be done well.

17:20.280 --> 17:23.280
It just hadn't been by that point.

17:23.280 --> 17:26.280
Or, at the very least, it had not been commercially successful.

17:26.280 --> 17:28.280
And it's kind of easy to see why.

17:28.280 --> 17:35.280
It is hard to be genuinely, emotionally sincere about something that's just so out there.

17:35.280 --> 17:37.280
Like the Balrog scene, for instance.

17:37.280 --> 17:40.280
Even the dialogue is pretty much directly from the book.

17:40.280 --> 17:44.280
And this could be so easily so goofy with dialogue like this.

17:44.280 --> 17:49.280
I am a servant of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of Arnor.

17:49.520 --> 17:53.520
The dark fire will never bail you, flame of Uldun!

17:53.520 --> 17:56.520
But this is Sir Ian we're talking about.

17:56.520 --> 17:59.520
Sir Ian's like, go hard or go home.

17:59.520 --> 18:04.520
If we were to draw a graph of my process, of my method, something like this,

18:04.520 --> 18:07.520
Sir Ian, Sir Ian, Sir Ian, action.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.520
Wizard, you shall not pass! Cut!

18:10.520 --> 18:12.520
Sir Ian, Sir Ian, Sir Ian.

18:12.520 --> 18:17.520
So the fact that these films exist at all were a colliding of stars that weren't terribly likely.

18:17.760 --> 18:20.760
That they'd be made with these people who, for the most part,

18:20.760 --> 18:23.760
had good instincts adapting this material for a modern audience.

18:23.760 --> 18:26.760
That the studio allowed them the freedom to make the film that they more or less wanted,

18:26.760 --> 18:29.760
and that they were allowed to make three movies at all.

18:29.760 --> 18:33.760
When you look at the way things are today, it's kind of ironic to think that they had to fight to get three.

18:33.760 --> 18:37.760
But also the fact that these movies came out in the climate that they did.

18:37.760 --> 18:41.760
Bellow Ship of the Ring came out not four months after 9-11.

18:41.760 --> 18:45.760
We had just invaded Afghanistan, Iraq was right around the corner,

18:46.000 --> 18:51.000
the world was changing, and suddenly the high, epic, simplistic world

18:51.000 --> 18:56.000
of Tolkien's emotional sincerity didn't seem so unpalatable anymore.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
We wanted that escapism, to go to the world of good versus evil,

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
where friends are truly good friends who truly love each other,

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
and the bad guys are genetically engineered for evil and ugly,

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
so we don't feel bad when they die, and you don't have to be ashamed of your hairy feet.

19:13.240 --> 19:17.240
It is escapism, but it's high escapism.

19:17.240 --> 19:21.240
And while it is difficult, incredibly difficult to do that well, or credibly,

19:21.240 --> 19:25.240
as we found out, there was a place for that.

19:25.240 --> 19:29.240
With Frodo on the ground.
