1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Let's take a moment to go back, all the way back to the early 1990s.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,420
It was a time following the wildly successful nascent Disney renaissance and the mostly

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,000
lucrative career of Andrew Lloyd Webber and his high-octane melodramas.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,240
So from this ecosystem rises a most unlikely musical adaptation of a literary classic.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,840
I'm in a new Andrew Lloyd Webber musical based on the hunchback of Notre Dame.

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,640
It's called Hunch.

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,640
This parody in the ABC animated comedy, The Critic, came out in 1994.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,640
The Hunchback of Notre Dame!

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,640
That's me!

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,640
Two years before Disney would go, let's do that but, you know, for real.

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,640
Out there, my ordinary man.

12
00:00:51,640 --> 00:01:02,640
Yes, I've got a hunch this is love.

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,640
Enter Disney's 34th animated feature film, The Hunchback of Notre Dame.

14
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,640
A film that traumatized countless millennials with its dark storyline, a score that makes

15
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:19,640
church music seem sunny and cheerful by comparison,

16
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,640
and the scarring miscasting of Jason Alexander.

17
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,640
It's hopeless, absolutely hopeless.

18
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,640
You're telling me!

19
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,640
I'm losing to a bird!

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,640
You know, we've got to cast that obnoxious little Gargoyle character.

21
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,640
What's his name?

22
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,640
Yeah, Hugo.

23
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,640
While even at the time, Notre Dame de Paris, known in the English-speaking world by its

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,640
published English title, The Hunchback of Notre Dame,

25
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,640
seemed an odd choice for Disney Animation to adapt,

26
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,640
it was nothing if not a logical progression,

27
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,640
given the one thing that studio head Jeffrey Katzenberg thirsted for above all else.

28
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,640
Hollywood, that's hooey ballyhooey Hollywood.

29
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,640
In addition to that, this was also with a prescient eye toward Broadway,

30
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,640
with Disney knowing that a successful animated movie can be aged up

31
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,640
for an extremely lucrative theater audience.

32
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,640
Like producer Don Hahn in the 1996 interview with Entertainment Weekly,

33
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,640
in this case, we wanted to push Alan and Stephen to write songs that were more pop opera,

34
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,640
like Les Mis or Phantom of the Opera.

35
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,640
Beauty and the Beast wasn't the first attempt towards a darker, even adult, tone for Disney Animation,

36
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,640
but it was the first that ended up working really, really well and being really, really lucrative.

37
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,640
Then came Pocahontas, and, well, they tried.

38
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,640
You see how I do it, huh?

39
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,640
So, to expand the type of story that Disney dares to adapt,

40
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,640
Katzenberg got the creative heads behind Beauty and the Beast

41
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,640
to adapt a dark novel of great historical importance.

42
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,640
Omelos into a bird!

43
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,640
Back in 1993, Creative Affairs VP David Stanton pitched the idea to Jeffrey Katzenberg

44
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,640
because he was impressed by, quote,

45
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,640
the truly great scenes and affecting storyline, end quote,

46
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,640
he had encountered when he read the classics illustrated comic version as a kid,

47
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,640
and then later the book.

48
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,640
And basically, it seemed like a thrilling challenge for the Disney company

49
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,640
to produce a streamlined, restructured treatment of it.

50
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,640
Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, fresh off their success directing Beauty and the Beast,

51
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,640
were originally working on a treatment of the Orpheus myth

52
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,640
that was about a whale exploring the ocean,

53
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,640
but Katzenberg quashed that to get them onto Hunchback instead.

54
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,640
And during that time, while we were working on it, we got a call from Jeffrey,

55
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,640
said, guys, drop everything.

56
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,640
You're working on Hunchback now.

57
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,640
Flash forward to 96, people are already getting kind of tired of this whole Disney Renaissance thing.

58
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
I like you.

59
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,640
And, lo, the Hunchback of Notre Dame.

60
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,640
All right, all right, pour the wine and cut the cheese.

61
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:37,640
But, as with Pocahontas, the reception to Hunchback of Notre Dame was...mixed.

62
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,640
At the time, it did not receive great reviews.

63
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,640
And these criticisms were not unwarranted.

64
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,640
Hunchback of Notre Dame had tone problems.

65
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:53,640
Citizens of Paris, Frollo has persecuted our people, ransacked our city.

66
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,640
Be mine or you will burn.

67
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,640
I'm losing to a bird.

68
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,640
Most people's post-mortem will agree that the centrality of these grotesquely cartoonish gargoyles

69
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,640
in a dark and serious story did far more harm than good.

70
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,640
And despite mandatory toyetic elements, this was an awkward movie to push toys for.

71
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,640
There was criticism of Esmeralda on all sides.

72
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,640
Christian mom groups were more on the Frollo side of things.

73
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,640
So typical of your kind to twist the truth to cloud the mind with unholy thoughts.

74
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,640
While progressives weren't too wild, with Esmeralda being the latest in a string of women of color

75
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,640
who are way more sexualized than their white counterparts.

76
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,640
Look at that disgusting display. Yes, sir.

77
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,640
Quoth Jason Alexander in a 1996 interview with Entertainment Weekly,

78
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,640
Esmeralda is awfully provocative.

79
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,640
She's up there in the Pocahontas category for Babe of the Year.

80
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,640
She is a little more voluptuous than Pokey was.

81
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,640
Pokey?

82
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
Pokey?!

83
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:02,640
But the most common complaint about Hunchback as its fatal flaw is simply the way it changes the source material.

84
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:08,640
It takes this dirge on the barbarism of human nature in which nearly every named character dies

85
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,640
and turns it into this bright and hopeful inspirational tale about social justice, acceptance,

86
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,640
and the ultimate goodness of humanity.

87
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,640
This, according to some, not only misses the mark of what made Notre Dame de Paris work as a story,

88
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,640
but also completely ruins the spirit of Hugo's work

89
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,640
and completely misses the point of what Hugo's novel was about.

90
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,640
I'm losing to a bird!

91
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,640
And you at home may be wondering,

92
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,640
are you really about to explain why Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame actually secretly does

93
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,640
somehow adhere to Victor Hugo's intent?

94
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,640
Well, no. Mostly no.

95
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,640
I'm less interested in Hugo's intent as it pertains to the Disney movie

96
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:47,640
so much as how it has changed over the decades in various interpretations.

97
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,640
Maybe it has lost Hugo's original intent,

98
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,640
but consider that if this story is to remain relevant,

99
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,640
maybe Hugo's original intent doesn't so much matter as much as the way people reinterpret it.

100
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,640
But you're not like other gypsies. They are evil.

101
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,640
And consider also that Victor Hugo might be okay with that.

102
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,640
This is Notre Dame Cathedral.

103
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,640
Construction began in 1163 after the previous Cathedral of Paris, the 4th century Saint-Étienne,

104
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,640
was allegedly deemed too shabby for its purposes by Bishop Maurice de Sully.

105
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,640
While it was consecrated in the 1180s, construction itself didn't end until 1345.

106
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,640
Notre Dame Cathedral was an engineering marvel.

107
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,640
It is particularly notable in being one of the first uses of flying buttresses.

108
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,640
If I may draw your attention to the flying buttresses.

109
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,640
And this was not originally planned.

110
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,640
Prior to the hunchback of Notre Dame,

111
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,640
the cathedral had survived both a massive vandalization by the Huguenots in 1548

112
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,640
for being deemed an idolatrous armpit.

113
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,640
In 1793, during the French Revolution,

114
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,640
much of the building was damaged and plundered

115
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,640
during its brief conversion into a temple for the Cult of Reason,

116
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,640
a state-sponsored atheistic religion which threw a lit-ass party inside Notre Dame

117
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,640
called the Fete of Reason as a giant f*** you to both the deposed king and to the Catholic Church.

118
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,640
You know the eyes in the Disney movie?

119
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,640
Well, those guys are supposed to be the original kings of Israel,

120
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,640
but the French revolutionaries thought they were supposed to be kings of France

121
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,640
and so they had them all beheaded.

122
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,640
Yeah, that happened.

123
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,640
By the 1830s, Notre Dame was, shall we say, a little busted.

124
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,640
By Victor Hugo's time, the cathedral was over 500 years old.

125
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,640
By now destroyed by the ravages of time, changing governments, and a general lack of care,

126
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,640
young Victor Hugo begins writing Notre Dame de Paris as a point of interest and research for himself,

127
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,640
entertaining the idea that a piece of writing might draw public interest to the building.

128
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,640
So this was before the modern concept of historical preservation,

129
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,640
an idea which really only took hold in Europe,

130
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,640
and especially in the United States after World War II.

131
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,640
This was largely due to this godmotherf***er named Robert Moses,

132
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,640
who was a city planner for New York City.

133
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,640
The original Madison Square Garden, that eyesore, that's not the original.

134
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,640
That was, you know, a mistake by Robert.

135
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,640
It wasn't even 100 years old.

136
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,640
It was, like, maybe 60 years old,

137
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,640
and he just knocked it down because it was inefficient and it was in the way,

138
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,640
and he was like, no, we need to have, like, the avenue open,

139
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,640
so then he knocked it down.

140
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,640
So, out of pure intellectual curiosity,

141
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,640
and, you know, I'm not a big fan of the idea of the cathedral,

142
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,640
So, out of pure intellectual curiosity,

143
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,640
and, you know, a desire for money,

144
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,640
Victor Hugo takes it upon himself to, well...

145
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,640
Educate yourself!

146
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,640
And he falls in love with it.

147
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,640
You know, the building, that is.

148
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,640
While most of what people actually remember about the book

149
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,640
concerns the melodrama of Esmeralda, Frollo, and Quasimodo,

150
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,640
Notre Dame de Paris, the book, is actually a lengthy screed

151
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,640
about the importance of architecture and the way it shapes the lives,

152
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,640
ideas, and culture of those who occupy its spaces.

153
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,640
That, before the printing press and the subsequent rise of literacy came along,

154
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,640
architecture was the dominant way to communicate and dogmatize big ideas

155
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,640
on a wide scale.

156
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,640
That all of the characters in Notre Dame de Paris are stupid,

157
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,640
or victims, or inept, or cruel,

158
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
ultimately, that doesn't matter,

159
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,640
because the building outlives and outlasts

160
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,640
any of these individual humans' flaws,

161
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,640
and ultimately weathers all of humanity's flaws,

162
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,640
and is still a much bigger shaper of French cultural identity

163
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,640
than any of these individual people.

164
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,640
So Victor Hugo wants to write a story to spark the public's imagination

165
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,640
and make them fall in love with this piece of history and architecture like he did.

166
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,640
At the time, Hugo was already a successful playwright and essayist,

167
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,640
but with the rise in popularity of this new, exciting form of writing called

168
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,640
the novel, that would earn Hugo international fame.

169
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,640
So in 1828, Hugo signs a contract with publisher Gosselin

170
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,640
to write this book about Notre Dame de Paris

171
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,640
for a really pretty sizable, for that time, advance of 4,000 francs,

172
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,640
with the promise that it would be done in April of 1829.

173
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,640
But like most writers, zing,

174
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,640
Hugo quickly burns through the advance

175
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,640
and puts off writing the book longer and longer

176
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,640
so he can stay in his comfort zone of writing plays.

177
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,640
So time passes, he hasn't really done any work on this book,

178
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,640
but then he goes ahead and starts trying to sell the stage rights

179
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,640
to a completely different publisher,

180
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,640
but then his original publisher that gave him this giant advance

181
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,640
finds out about this and is rightfully really pissed.

182
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,640
So after some negotiating,

183
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,640
Hugo successfully convinces the publisher

184
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,640
to push the publication deadline back to December 30th of 1830.

185
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,640
But then the July Revolution happens because it's France,

186
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,640
and early 19th century France was averaging about one revolution per month,

187
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,640
and Hugo ultimately finishes the novel on January 14th of 1831.

188
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,640
While there were socialist undertones in later adaptations of Notre Dame de Paris,

189
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,640
and even in Hugo's later works,

190
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,640
it's safe to say, you know, he was a businessman,

191
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,640
and if he and Walt Disney had been contemporaries,

192
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,640
they probably would have at least shared a good, firm, respectful handshake.

193
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,640
And if a Burger King commercial where a nine-year-old girl

194
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,640
happily plays with a puppet of Quasimodo seems gauche,

195
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,640
It was Quasimodo!

196
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,640
everything points to this author having dollar signs in his eyes,

197
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,640
or frank signs, before the book was even finished.

198
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,640
If Burger King had existed in 1830s France,

199
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,640
I'm sure all the kids would be wanting a Quasimodo textile mill finger protector.

200
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,640
And then, I got carried away just like Quasimodo.

201
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,640
I'm losing to a bird!

202
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,640
But here's the most important thing for Hugo.

203
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,640
It worked.

204
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,640
Did you just hide a stack of cocaine there?

205
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,640
Through writing this novel and his activism,

206
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,640
Hugo saved Notre Dame.

207
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,640
He woke people up to this historical and architectural marvel sitting in their midst.

208
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,640
And that new consciousness led to an extensive renovation in 1845,

209
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,640
led by V. Le Duc,

210
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,640
including the addition of this spire that Quasimodo sings on,

211
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,640
which was definitely not there in the 14th century.

212
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,640
And that is why Notre Dame Cathedral is the fancy tourist attraction we know and love today.

213
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,640
But the veneration of this building was not the main reason why the book got so big.

214
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,640
So, before we cast dispersions on Disney for changing things,

215
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,640
first we must ask,

216
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,640
what is The Hunchback of Notre Dame about?

217
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,640
While I think it's fair to assume that most modern audiences associate this story

218
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,640
with themes of social justice and progressive societal change,

219
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,640
this is more a product of pop culture adaptations than of the book itself.

220
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,640
More on that later.

221
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,640
The novel concerns itself very little with the plight of marginalized groups,

222
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,640
and has a much darker, more cynical take on society and humanity at large.

223
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,640
Quasimodo is a curmudgeonly lapdog who does Frollo's dirty work for him,

224
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,640
and he's also deaf from those bells,

225
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,640
and does not have the angelic voice of human flower crown Tom Hulse.

226
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,640
Knowing them is they will never know me.

227
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,640
Claude Frollo is a straight-up attempted rapist.

228
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,640
Phoebus resembles Gaston more than any other Disney character.

229
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,640
He's just down to nut, but at the end of the day, Phoebus is only here for Phoebus.

230
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,640
Esmeralda is your basic romantic representation of a Madonna horror trope

231
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,640
sprinkled with some genuinely harmful racism that gets buried in later adaptations.

232
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,640
You find out at the end that Esmeralda isn't really Romani.

233
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,640
She's actually a white girl who was stolen as a baby.

234
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,640
Yeah.

235
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,640
Yeah, they cut that out in the Disney movie.

236
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,640
Yes, good. Thank you, Disney.

237
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,640
Stay away, child. They're gypsies.

238
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,640
Esmeralda is reunited with her birth mother,

239
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,640
who is also a wayfish, tragic, driven mad by having lost her baby,

240
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,640
right before both characters die horribly.

241
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,640
In fact, everybody dies horribly, except for Phoebus,

242
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,640
and a not-so-subtle stand-in character for Victor Hugo,

243
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,640
Pierre Gringoire, who was cut from the Disney movie.

244
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,640
He is a poet, and at the end of the novel,

245
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,640
when given the choice to save the life of either Esmeralda or the goat,

246
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,640
but not both, he saves the goat.

247
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:55,640
Yeah, the goat lives. And yes, the goat was created by Victor Hugo, not Disney.

248
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,640
The main plot that takes up most adaptations that we know

249
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,640
is the background noise to Hugo's main point,

250
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,640
which can be summed up with the following excerpt.

251
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,640
Our readers must excuse us if we stop a moment

252
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,640
to investigate the enigmatic words of the archdeacon.

253
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,640
This will kill that. The book will kill the edifice.

254
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,640
Victor Hugo's book was mainly concerned with how the printed press,

255
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,640
and subsequently, mass literacy,

256
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,640
would kill what he perceived as the original common language, architecture.

257
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,640
So the themes we, the modern audience, have come to associate

258
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,640
with The Hunchback of Notre Dame,

259
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,640
whether everyone lives at the end or not,

260
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,640
these were not themes that were necessarily present in the original novel.

261
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,640
The original novel was not terribly concerned

262
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,640
with the plight of the marginalized or the abused.

263
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,640
Victor Hugo was so unconcerned with the main melodrama, we know,

264
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,640
that when the original English-language translator,

265
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,640
Frederic Chaubert, switched the title from Notre Dame de Paris

266
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,640
to The Hunchback of Notre Dame,

267
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,640
essentially because it sounded, I don't know,

268
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,640
more tantalizing to English-speaking audiences,

269
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,640
Hugo was notoriously pissed off.

270
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,640
So there's an interesting irony in a book that says,

271
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,640
this will kill that, the book will kill the edifice.

272
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,640
Its original meaning and intent will get killed off by...

273
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,640
Visual Mass Media!

274
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,640
One does not go from a dark and violent story

275
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,640
about fate and death of the church to...

276
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,640
Omelos into a bird!

277
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,640
...so easily.

278
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,640
Let's look at a few examples.

279
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,640
La Esmeralda was an opera written in 1836,

280
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,640
and if you're wondering why this production that I pulled

281
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,640
looks like a production of Rent with priests in it,

282
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,640
I kind of wonder that too.

283
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,640
This opera failed in a big way,

284
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,640
so it doesn't get like 600 productions a year like La Bohème does.

285
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,640
La Esmeralda has a much less dour ending than the book.

286
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,640
Censors demanded that every reference to Claude Frollo

287
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,640
being a priest be removed, and lo,

288
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,640
the framework of modern adaptation begins.

289
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,640
Quasimodo in this version was shunted to minor character status,

290
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,640
and while Phoebus ends up dying a noble death because of love,

291
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,640
La Esmeralda survives.

292
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,640
And this stage adaptation was written by...

293
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,640
Victor Hugo?

294
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,640
Yeah.

295
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,640
Even though this version is largely forgotten by history,

296
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,640
it is relevant because we already see the author actively engaged

297
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,640
in rewriting his own book for a mass visual consumption

298
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,640
and boulderizing its own message to make it palatable for a larger audience.

299
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,640
I've got a hunch this bites.

300
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,640
La Esmeralda was followed by multiple adaptations over the following decades,

301
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,640
and the material was retrofitted again with the rise of film,

302
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,640
including one version directed by Alice Guy-Blanche in 1905.

303
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,640
But for the purposes of this video,

304
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,640
let's skip ahead in time to the 1923 Hollywood movie starring Lon Chaney,

305
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,640
the first adaptation that was a massive success.

306
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,640
Not only did this film bring Hunchback back to the popular consciousness in a big way,

307
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,640
it also positioned Quasimodo as one of the original universal movie monsters.

308
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,640
Lon Chaney wanted to be Quasimodo to the point where he was actually looking

309
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,640
to form his own production company for the sole purpose of getting this movie made.

310
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,640
Producer Irving Thalberg had been wanting to make a big production

311
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,640
that was more epic and adult than the usual universal fare,

312
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,640
and pitched it to studio head Carl Laemmle as a love story,

313
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,640
and thus the Hunchback of Notre Dame tragic love story entered the public consciousness.

314
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640
The film banked a record $3 million,

315
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,640
and got the ball rolling in this conga line of film versions,

316
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,640
and why you will eventually have to sit through the Dark Universe version

317
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,640
of Hunchback starring Ansel Elgort in 2021.

318
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
I hope. Please God, let it happen. I want it.

319
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,640
Frollo is still not a priest, although his brother Jehan, a minor character in the book, is.

320
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,640
And Phoebus is good now.

321
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,640
Quasimodo dies at the end so the breeding pair can go forth unfettered,

322
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,640
because he is an uggo and, well, really,

323
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,640
this is about as nice of a monster as you were going to get out of a 1923 movie.

324
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,640
But all in all, despite this being one of the last big versions with the Esmeralda racism reveal,

325
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,640
it's still fairly conventional 1920s fluff.

326
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:54,640
But already in 1923, we have lost any real connection to Victor Hugo's message

327
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,640
about the novel destroying the edifice.

328
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,640
Because visual mass media has destroyed the novel.

329
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,640
No, no, no. Don't spoil the fun, Frollo. Stay here.

330
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,640
In 1939, Hollywood producer Pandro S. Berman demanded an exact remake of the Lon Chaney film,

331
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,640
reusing a majority of the sets from the 1923 version.

332
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,640
William Dieterle, already a successful director in his own right before fleeing Nazi Germany,

333
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,640
delivered on this for Berman.

334
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,640
Charles Lawton starred, delivering a truly memorable performance as Quasimodo.

335
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,640
Why was I not made of stone like thee?

336
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,640
And at Lawton's own behest, they brought in relative newcomer Maureen O'Hara to star as Esmeralda,

337
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,640
who in this version is not a stolen white baby, but actually Romani.

338
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,640
So... I'm not sure where this falls in the whitewashing conversation, but there you go.

339
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,640
She's a gypsy, sir.

340
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,640
Who cares about her race? She's pretty.

341
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,640
And it is this version more than any other, including the original novel,

342
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,640
that Disney borrows from the most.

343
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:10,640
There is also a very sharp humanist lean into the concept of justice in regard to people versus buildings in history.

344
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,640
Esmeralda in this version isn't just some innocent hottie who wanders into misfortune by pure bad luck.

345
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,640
She literally breaks into the city of Paris, where the Romani have been actively banned from,

346
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,640
to plead with the king of France to let her people live freely.

347
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,640
They tell me gypsies are a lot of thieves.

348
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,640
That's not true, your majesty.

349
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,640
Whenever we steal, it's because we're hungry.

350
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,640
My people have good hearts, and we love you.

351
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,640
You have a good heart too, sir, because you've promised to help us.

352
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,640
It is also one of the rare versions where the Romani are not demonized in some way, shape, or form.

353
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,640
Still looking at you, Disney.

354
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,640
The lame can walk.

355
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,640
And the blind can see.

356
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,640
But the dead don't talk.

357
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,640
Their plight is just that, a plight.

358
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,640
Why do you stop us?

359
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,640
Because no gypsies can enter Paris any longer without a permit.

360
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,640
It's the new law.

361
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,640
If the others cannot too, why can't we?

362
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,640
They are Frenchmen. You're gypsies. Foreigners.

363
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,640
You came yesterday, we come today.

364
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,640
The movie is constantly reminding us that the lives of innocent, persecuted people are at stake.

365
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,640
The Esmeralda, Quasimodo, Frollo melodrama that everyone loves is still in there, sure,

366
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,640
but there is an active undercurrent in this movie that ties in with bigger struggles

367
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,640
that isn't just an old building that has weathered time.

368
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,640
The Hunchback of Notre Dame was the only film that was screened in Cannes that year,

369
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,640
a film festival which was itself created in opposition to the fascist presence at the Venice Film Festival.

370
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,640
So that a movie that features the Romani as a persecuted underclass

371
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,640
while Hitler was gearing up to slaughter hundreds of thousands of them

372
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,640
at a festival that was created to oppose Nazism,

373
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,640
there's something incredibly powerful in that.

374
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,640
Something that has nothing to do with Hugo's original intent.

375
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,640
So with the success of this movie, and it was a huge success,

376
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,640
we gain the justice for the oppressed theme which plays very heavily into the Disney version.

377
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,640
So in a lot of ways, this adaptation is certainly the most cohesive,

378
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,640
and it is telling that many future adaptations try to mimic the anti-fascist theming,

379
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,640
Justice!

380
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,640
while at the same time not always grasping it.

381
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,640
We find you totally innocent.

382
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,640
Which is the worst crime of all.

383
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,640
So you're going to pay!

384
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,640
So, it's 1992, and Disney is plotting out its five-year plan for the conquest of Earth

385
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,640
after the staggering success of Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and The Little Mermaid.

386
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:35,640
If Disney wants to adapt Notre Dame de Paris, which version do they really want to adapt?

387
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,640
Right off the bat, it's fallacious to look at Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame

388
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,640
as an adaptation of the original novel,

389
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,640
because that read ignores a whole century and a half of filmmakers recontextualizing the story for each new generation.

390
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,640
Again, the idea for the Disney movie didn't come from the original novel,

391
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,640
but from a picture book adaptation of it.

392
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,640
And even if the original Notre Dame de Paris was as close to perfection as the early novel could get,

393
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,640
film is just a different medium.

394
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,640
It's a common fallacy that adaptational changes happen

395
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,640
because greedy filmmakers want to bastardize and water down a beloved creation

396
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,640
to get as many butts in seats as possible.

397
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,640
Why, I'm the Captain the Hat!

398
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
And well, that is sometimes true,

399
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,640
but just as often it's changing the story to fit a visually temporally locked medium.

400
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,640
Yes, sometimes adaptations are cheap cash-ins,

401
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,640
but it is just inaccurate to assume that all Hollywood adaptations are

402
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,640
when there are often teams of artists that care deeply about making the best product possible,

403
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,640
which usually means changing some stuff.

404
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,640
But more to the point, aside from the fact that the Disney movie changes the ending in a big way,

405
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,640
and that's the aspect that people tend to focus on,

406
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,640
what did it really change?

407
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,640
Rather, the real question is, what versions did Disney pull from?

408
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,640
Because the real originality is in the aesthetics, the music, the visuals,

409
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,640
not so much the story.

410
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,640
That Frollo is no longer a priest comes from Hugo himself in La Esmeralda.

411
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,640
Same with Phoebus being a good guy and not everybody dying.

412
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,640
And that theme of justice for the oppressed,

413
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,640
well, we can thank Charles Laughton and a German filmmaker fleeing the Nazis for that.

414
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,640
The God Help the Outcast musical number pulls heavily from this scene in the 1939 version.

415
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,640
Give me a rich husband. Give me many admirers. Give me beauty.

416
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,640
Give me a rich highness. Give me peace of mind.

417
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,640
Give me happiness. Take all I have. But please help my people.

418
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:24,640
I ask for nothing. I can get by.

419
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:31,640
Please help my people, the poor and downtrod.

420
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,640
Or this scene of Phoebus rallying the citizens of Paris.

421
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,640
Citizens of Paris.

422
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,640
Parisians! Parisians!

423
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,640
That also borrows from Gringoire doing similar in the 1939 movie.

424
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,640
But let's take a look at what the themes of the Disney movie even are.

425
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,640
I think Esmeralda put it best.

426
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,640
Justice!

427
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
First, there is the theme of oppression and injustice.

428
00:23:52,640 --> 00:24:00,640
Judge Claude Frollo longed to purge the world of vice and sin.

429
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,640
Interrupt judge Claude Frollo begins the film by way of unjust oppression.

430
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:12,640
And for one time in his life of power and control,

431
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:19,640
Frollo felt a twinge of fear for his immortal soul.

432
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,640
What must I do?

433
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,640
Then there's the theme of humility before God,

434
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,640
and that Notre Dame itself acts as a sort of embodiment of God.

435
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,640
You never can run from nor hide what you've done from the eyes.

436
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:37,640
The very eyes of Notre Dame.

437
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,640
By basically embodying injustice, Frollo positions himself as an enemy of God.

438
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,640
But that Quasimodo embodies justice positions him as almost angelic.

439
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,640
Observe the contradiction between heaven's light...

440
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:57,640
I swear it must be heaven's light.

441
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,640
And hellfire.

442
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,640
Like fire, hellfire.

443
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,640
But the unique thematic element in the Disney movie is this.

444
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,640
Who is the monster and who is the man?

445
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,640
This idea is present to some extent in all of the versions,

446
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,640
but the Disney version is the first to put this theme of internal versus external monsterhood front and center.

447
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,640
You are deformed.

448
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,640
I am deformed.

449
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,640
And you are ugly.

450
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,640
And I am ugly.

451
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,640
Quasimodo, and indeed everyone but Esmeralda, take it for granted that he is a monster, you know.

452
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,640
I am a monster, you know.

453
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,640
Because of the way that he looks.

454
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,640
But it is Frollo who is the monster.

455
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,640
The most monstrous character Disney has ever created.

456
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,640
It's not my fault.

457
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,640
I'm not to blame.

458
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,640
Because he is much more grounded and real than any other Disney villain.

459
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,640
This, aside from the general quality of the writing, is what makes hellfire so brilliant.

460
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,640
Protect me, Maria.

461
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,640
Don't let the siren cast her spell.

462
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,640
Don't let her fire sear my flesh and bone.

463
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,640
Unlike other Disney villain songs where they're just singing about how being evil is fun...

464
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:11,640
An even grimmer plot has been simmering in my great criminal brain.

465
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,640
Hellfire is about the anguish it causes him to be the way that he is.

466
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,640
It's not my fault.

467
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:25,640
If in God's plan, he made the devil so much stronger than a man.

468
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,640
Said Kirk Wise in a 1996 Chicago Tribune article,

469
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,640
As we were exploring the characters, especially Frollo,

470
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,640
we certainly found a lot of historical parallels to the type of mania he had.

471
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,640
The Confederate South, Nazi Germany, take your pick.

472
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,640
And it is in their interactions with Esmeralda that their relative monsterhood is revealed.

473
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,640
I am a monster, you know.

474
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,640
So, yeah, hold on, I am about to defend this creative decision, bear with me.

475
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:54,640
I remember even back in 1996 hearing the argument where if differently abled kids should see themselves just as valuable as everyone else,

476
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,640
then why doesn't Quasimodo get the girl at the end?

477
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,640
To which I would respond, A, getting the girl as a reward should never be the goal.

478
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:09,640
And let her taste the fires of hell, or else let her be mine and mine alone.

479
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,640
And B, it's what sets Quasimodo apart from Frollo.

480
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,640
He accepts and values Esmeralda's friendship,

481
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:21,640
but he's also able to let her go so she can be with the guy who was basically an accessory to genocide up until about five minutes ago.

482
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,640
He's fine with it.

483
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,640
He's fine.

484
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,640
Really.

485
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,640
He's fine.

486
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,640
See?

487
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,640
He's fine.

488
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,640
He's fine.

489
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,640
It's fine.

490
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,640
It's fine.

491
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,640
This is fine.

492
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,640
It's fine.

493
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:41,640
See again that contrast between heaven's light and hell fire, both of which revolve around Esmeralda.

494
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,640
Esmeralda gives Quasimodo positive attention, and that's the first time he's ever experienced that.

495
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,640
Do you think I'm evil?

496
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,640
No.

497
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,640
No, no, you were kind and good and...

498
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,640
And a gypsy.

499
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,640
And maybe Frollo's wrong about the both of us.

500
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,640
And his hope is that she might one day love him.

501
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,640
I dare to dream that she might even care for me.

502
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,640
But Frollo's position is, if I can't have her, literally possess her, no one can.

503
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:20,640
Destroy Esmeralda and let her taste the fires of hell, or else let her be mine and mine alone.

504
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,640
So this is the binary between a monster and a man.

505
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,640
Quasimodo respects Esmeralda's autonomy and he lets her go.

506
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,640
Frollo would rather die.

507
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,640
So, this is fine.

508
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,640
He's fine.

509
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,640
It's fine.

510
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,640
He's fine.

511
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,640
This is fine.

512
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,640
It's fine.

513
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,640
He's fine.

514
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,640
This is fine.

515
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,640
It's fine.

516
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,640
Don't worry, they give him a hot, clumsy girlfriend in the sequel.

517
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,640
Was it just a lucky day?

518
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,640
That he turned and looked my way?

519
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,640
And on that same token, that's part of why Quasimodo needs to not die at the end of this version.

520
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,640
Losing his love, either to someone else or to death by hanging, doesn't kill him.

521
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,640
Part of Quasimodo's goodness stems from him being stronger than that.

522
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,640
And rather than getting a sexy lamp as a reward, he finds happiness in being accepted by the people,

523
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:17,640
which is maybe a touch unrealistic, but certainly a better message than either dying or getting a sexy lamp as a reward.

524
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,640
And to be clear, Esmeralda in this version is super proactive and not a sexy lamp.

525
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,640
And Quasimodo, unlike Frollo, does not see women as possessions.

526
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:31,640
But there's a lot going on here that kind of gets buried under the criticism that they changed the ending and therefore softened it.

527
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:38,640
Even with the damned gargoyles in the picture, the overall dark tone kind of worked against the movie's favorability ratings.

528
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,640
Even at the time, a huge part of the confused reaction was the distance between the marketing...

529
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,640
I think the cavalry's here!

530
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,640
This coming summer, experience the adventure.

531
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,640
Sit.

532
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,640
Mom and dad had a special surprise waiting for me.

533
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,640
It was Quasimodo!

534
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,640
You are deformed.

535
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,640
I am deformed.

536
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,640
And you are ugly.

537
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,640
And I am ugly.

538
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,640
And these are crimes for which the world shows little pity.

539
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,640
Partly because people thought it was too serious and too dark.

540
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,640
Now your kids can get all four puppets.

541
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,640
Take them from her.

542
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,640
This is an unholy demon. I'm sending it back to hell.

543
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:28,640
The marketing department at that time thought, well, we'll maybe fool people into thinking that it's a lighthearted, happy Disney.

544
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,640
And then I got carried away just like Quasimodo.

545
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,640
They'll play up the gargoyles and they'll play up the feast of fools.

546
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:44,640
And so all the marketing at that time was, it's a celebration. It's a festival.

547
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,640
It took nearly 20 years before we saw that coveted stage musical,

548
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:54,640
and with it attempts to address some of the criticism about the weird tonal dissonance in the Disney movie by sticking closer to the original novel.

549
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,640
It ran in Germany for several years before premiering with a revised book in America,

550
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,640
with performances in San Diego and at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey.

551
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,640
It never made it to Broadway and probably never will for...

552
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,640
union reasons.

553
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,640
I'll just leave it at that.

554
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,640
Union stuff.

555
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:16,640
The American production goes even darker, sticking much closer to the Everybody Dies ending,

556
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:22,640
but I'd argue it ends up being less enjoyable than the movie because it runs into the same tone problem, but now in the opposite direction.

557
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,640
It builds on the same foundation as the movie, but then it has a different payoff that isn't really built to.

558
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,640
It's different, not better.

559
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:35,640
It was less successful, however, than the most financially lucrative non-English language musical in history,

560
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,640
Notre Dame de Paris, the French Quebecois musical,

561
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,640
which, while one of the more accurate adaptations of Hunchback...

562
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:07,640
Well, if your cheese is three men wailing melodramatically over a hot lady to a Chris Isaac song by way of spa music,

563
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,640
then Notre Dame de Paris is for you.

564
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,640
There's always a desire to tell and retell popular stories.

565
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,640
This is how we share and create culture.

566
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,640
In some ways, this is the reason why culture even exists.

567
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,640
So it's important to understand not just that stories sometimes change, but why.

568
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:32,640
The changes to Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame weren't just rooted in the fact that it's Disney and we can't just kill everybody.

569
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,640
And yet it's a lot lighter than the novel.

570
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,640
Oh, absolutely. In the novel, everybody dies.

571
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,640
Although that is certainly a part of it.

572
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,640
Changes to narratives over time are inevitable.

573
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:49,640
And in the case of Notre Dame de Paris, it's because sometimes problems actually do get addressed.

574
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:54,640
Historical preservation wasn't really a thing in the 1830s, especially in France.

575
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,640
But now it's hard to imagine a France where historical preservation isn't a huge priority.

576
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,640
And a lot of that is thanks to Victor Hugo.

577
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:07,640
Several years before publishing Notre Dame de Paris, Hugo wrote an essay called War on the Demolishers, in which he stated,

578
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,640
The hammer that is mutilating the face of the country must be stopped.

579
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,640
One law would suffice. Let us pass it.

580
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:18,640
Whatever the property rights may be, we must not allow the destruction of a historical and monumental edifice

581
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,640
by these ignoble speculators whose honor has been blinded by self-interest.

582
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,640
We would want to reconstruct these prodigious edifices, but we would not be able to.

583
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,640
We no longer possess the genius of centuries past.

584
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,640
Industry has replaced art.

585
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:35,640
We can't step into the reality where Hugo never existed, so we will never know.

586
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:41,640
But it is fair to say that if not for the hunchback of Notre Dame, Notre Dame Cathedral might not even be there today.

587
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,640
Or at least, it would still be pretty busted.

588
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,640
But we live in a world now, in Europe anyway, where Hugo's primary concern was solved.

589
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:53,640
So if this story is going to stick around, it needs a new concern.

590
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,640
A more humanist one.

591
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:00,640
Hugo's writing changed priorities as the priorities of the time he was living in changed.

592
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,640
And I think that shift in perspective is no better illustrated than in Hugo's other great work, Les Miserables,

593
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,640
which takes a wildly different attitude on the value of human life.

594
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:13,640
Les Mis's theme is that individual lives, though crushed by an unjust system, do matter,

595
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,640
and the choices of individuals do affect history.

596
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,640
Just look at the kindly bishop who didn't turn in Jean Valjean at the beginning of the novel,

597
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,640
and gave him a second chance, and how Jean Valjean uses that second chance to better the lives of others.

598
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:27,640
This is a primary theme of Les Mis, human goodness overcoming unjust systems.

599
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:32,640
So Notre Dame de Paris gets this sort of makeover where it's sort of making the same point as Les Mis,

600
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,640
justice for the oppressed.

601
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:38,640
True monstrousness is not a reflection of how society sees you, or what you look like.

602
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,640
And inhumanly strong protagonists. Hugo was a big fan of those.

603
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:47,640
If you want to decry the Disney movie for the changes they made to make it kid-friendly, well, that's fine.

604
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,640
But if one calls out the happy ending because it blunts the original misanthropic tone of the novel,

605
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:57,640
but doesn't call out the anti-inequality or social justice aspects, well, it's not only missing the forest for the trees,

606
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,640
but it's also a rather shallow reading and omits basically all of the context in history.

607
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,640
And yeah, part of that is just Disney being Disney, but part of that is what we need now.

608
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,640
Like Hugo making a point about the historical importance of the building was what we needed in the 1830s.

609
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,640
Quasimodo has gone from pitiable wretch and tool of the system to a movie monster,

610
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:19,640
and then back to pitiable wretch but nicer this time, and then all the way to hero of his own story.

611
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:26,640
It's also noteworthy how really the Disney version is the only version that explores how abusive and weird Quasimodo's relationship with Frollo is,

612
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,640
and has him overcoming it.

613
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,640
All my life you have told me that the world is a dark, cruel place,

614
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,640
but now I see that the only thing dark and cruel about it is people like you.

615
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,640
And it really is remarkable that Disney had a protagonist with a legit physical deformity.

616
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,640
And I don't mean, like, beastly deformity.

617
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,640
I can't think of another kids movie that does that except, well, arguably Shrek,

618
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,640
and Shrek, well, Shrek looks like 90% of stand-up comedians.

619
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,640
This movie was the first that went into production after Aladdin was a huge success,

620
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,640
and it shows with these forced comedy elements that have only aged more poorly over time.

621
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,640
Fly, my pretty, fly, fly!

622
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,640
And improvising Robin Williams is not the same as Jason Alexander.

623
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,640
All right, all right! Pour the wine and cut the cheese!

624
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,640
Disservice though it may have been to this movie,

625
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,640
Disney did eventually relearn that not all sidekicks have to be voiced by comedians.

626
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,640
Eventually.

627
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,640
But in a lot of ways, Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame was ahead of its time.

628
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,640
It's still a hot mess.

629
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,640
Easy as it is to say, it's great, except for the gargoyles.

630
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,640
The gargoyles are still there.

631
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,640
Yet it's still a cut above what people give it credit for,

632
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,640
and I think it would be more appreciated if it came out today,

633
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,640
because we need stories like this today.

634
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,640
Fashy abuse of Frollo, justice for the oppressed,

635
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,640
the focus on how some men really do loathe the objects of their desire,

636
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,640
the wholesale demonization of ethnic groups.

637
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:01,640
For 20 years I have been taking care of the gypsies, one by one.

638
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:06,640
Maybe this movie wasn't really appreciated in its time because it didn't resonate as much in 1996,

639
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,640
but it does resonate more in 2017.

640
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,640
So if you haven't seen it in a while, give it a watch.

641
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,640
And watch it in Dolby 5.1 HD if you can.

642
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,640
Enjoy the sweeping vistas, the revolutionary CGI,

643
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,640
Alan Menken's best score for a Disney movie, that's right, I said it, don't at me,

644
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,640
and consider that, hokey though it may be at points,

645
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,640
like Hugo's message about the importance of architecture in the 1830s,

646
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,640
this might be what we need in our time.

647
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,640
Most of it.

648
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,640
Most of it.
