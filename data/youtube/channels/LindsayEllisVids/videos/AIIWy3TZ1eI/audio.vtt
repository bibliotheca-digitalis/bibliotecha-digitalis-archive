WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.240
Let's take a moment to go back, all the way back to the early 1990s.

00:04.240 --> 00:09.420
It was a time following the wildly successful nascent Disney renaissance and the mostly

00:09.420 --> 00:14.000
lucrative career of Andrew Lloyd Webber and his high-octane melodramas.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.240
So from this ecosystem rises a most unlikely musical adaptation of a literary classic.

00:20.240 --> 00:24.840
I'm in a new Andrew Lloyd Webber musical based on the hunchback of Notre Dame.

00:24.840 --> 00:27.640
It's called Hunch.

00:27.640 --> 00:32.640
This parody in the ABC animated comedy, The Critic, came out in 1994.

00:32.640 --> 00:39.640
The Hunchback of Notre Dame!

00:41.640 --> 00:42.640
That's me!

00:42.640 --> 00:46.640
Two years before Disney would go, let's do that but, you know, for real.

00:46.640 --> 00:51.640
Out there, my ordinary man.

00:51.640 --> 01:02.640
Yes, I've got a hunch this is love.

01:02.640 --> 01:06.640
Enter Disney's 34th animated feature film, The Hunchback of Notre Dame.

01:06.640 --> 01:10.640
A film that traumatized countless millennials with its dark storyline, a score that makes

01:10.640 --> 01:19.640
church music seem sunny and cheerful by comparison,

01:19.640 --> 01:22.640
and the scarring miscasting of Jason Alexander.

01:22.640 --> 01:25.640
It's hopeless, absolutely hopeless.

01:25.640 --> 01:26.640
You're telling me!

01:26.640 --> 01:28.640
I'm losing to a bird!

01:28.640 --> 01:31.640
You know, we've got to cast that obnoxious little Gargoyle character.

01:31.640 --> 01:32.640
What's his name?

01:32.640 --> 01:34.640
Yeah, Hugo.

01:34.640 --> 01:37.640
While even at the time, Notre Dame de Paris, known in the English-speaking world by its

01:38.640 --> 01:40.640
published English title, The Hunchback of Notre Dame,

01:40.640 --> 01:43.640
seemed an odd choice for Disney Animation to adapt,

01:43.640 --> 01:45.640
it was nothing if not a logical progression,

01:45.640 --> 01:49.640
given the one thing that studio head Jeffrey Katzenberg thirsted for above all else.

01:49.640 --> 01:54.640
Hollywood, that's hooey ballyhooey Hollywood.

01:54.640 --> 01:58.640
In addition to that, this was also with a prescient eye toward Broadway,

01:58.640 --> 02:01.640
with Disney knowing that a successful animated movie can be aged up

02:01.640 --> 02:04.640
for an extremely lucrative theater audience.

02:04.640 --> 02:07.640
Like producer Don Hahn in the 1996 interview with Entertainment Weekly,

02:07.640 --> 02:11.640
in this case, we wanted to push Alan and Stephen to write songs that were more pop opera,

02:11.640 --> 02:13.640
like Les Mis or Phantom of the Opera.

02:13.640 --> 02:18.640
Beauty and the Beast wasn't the first attempt towards a darker, even adult, tone for Disney Animation,

02:18.640 --> 02:23.640
but it was the first that ended up working really, really well and being really, really lucrative.

02:23.640 --> 02:26.640
Then came Pocahontas, and, well, they tried.

02:26.640 --> 02:28.640
You see how I do it, huh?

02:28.640 --> 02:31.640
So, to expand the type of story that Disney dares to adapt,

02:31.640 --> 02:33.640
Katzenberg got the creative heads behind Beauty and the Beast

02:33.640 --> 02:36.640
to adapt a dark novel of great historical importance.

02:36.640 --> 02:38.640
Omelos into a bird!

02:38.640 --> 02:43.640
Back in 1993, Creative Affairs VP David Stanton pitched the idea to Jeffrey Katzenberg

02:43.640 --> 02:45.640
because he was impressed by, quote,

02:45.640 --> 02:48.640
the truly great scenes and affecting storyline, end quote,

02:48.640 --> 02:51.640
he had encountered when he read the classics illustrated comic version as a kid,

02:51.640 --> 02:53.640
and then later the book.

02:53.640 --> 02:56.640
And basically, it seemed like a thrilling challenge for the Disney company

02:56.640 --> 02:58.640
to produce a streamlined, restructured treatment of it.

02:58.640 --> 03:01.640
Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, fresh off their success directing Beauty and the Beast,

03:01.640 --> 03:04.640
were originally working on a treatment of the Orpheus myth

03:04.640 --> 03:06.640
that was about a whale exploring the ocean,

03:06.640 --> 03:09.640
but Katzenberg quashed that to get them onto Hunchback instead.

03:09.640 --> 03:12.640
And during that time, while we were working on it, we got a call from Jeffrey,

03:12.640 --> 03:15.640
said, guys, drop everything.

03:15.640 --> 03:17.640
You're working on Hunchback now.

03:17.640 --> 03:22.640
Flash forward to 96, people are already getting kind of tired of this whole Disney Renaissance thing.

03:22.640 --> 03:23.640
I like you.

03:23.640 --> 03:25.640
And, lo, the Hunchback of Notre Dame.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.640
All right, all right, pour the wine and cut the cheese.

03:29.640 --> 03:37.640
But, as with Pocahontas, the reception to Hunchback of Notre Dame was...mixed.

03:37.640 --> 03:41.640
At the time, it did not receive great reviews.

03:41.640 --> 03:43.640
And these criticisms were not unwarranted.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.640
Hunchback of Notre Dame had tone problems.

03:46.640 --> 03:53.640
Citizens of Paris, Frollo has persecuted our people, ransacked our city.

03:56.640 --> 04:02.640
Be mine or you will burn.

04:02.640 --> 04:04.640
I'm losing to a bird.

04:04.640 --> 04:09.640
Most people's post-mortem will agree that the centrality of these grotesquely cartoonish gargoyles

04:09.640 --> 04:12.640
in a dark and serious story did far more harm than good.

04:12.640 --> 04:17.640
And despite mandatory toyetic elements, this was an awkward movie to push toys for.

04:17.640 --> 04:20.640
There was criticism of Esmeralda on all sides.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.640
Christian mom groups were more on the Frollo side of things.

04:23.640 --> 04:28.640
So typical of your kind to twist the truth to cloud the mind with unholy thoughts.

04:28.640 --> 04:33.640
While progressives weren't too wild, with Esmeralda being the latest in a string of women of color

04:33.640 --> 04:36.640
who are way more sexualized than their white counterparts.

04:36.640 --> 04:39.640
Look at that disgusting display. Yes, sir.

04:39.640 --> 04:43.640
Quoth Jason Alexander in a 1996 interview with Entertainment Weekly,

04:43.640 --> 04:45.640
Esmeralda is awfully provocative.

04:45.640 --> 04:48.640
She's up there in the Pocahontas category for Babe of the Year.

04:48.640 --> 04:51.640
She is a little more voluptuous than Pokey was.

04:53.640 --> 04:54.640
Pokey?

04:55.640 --> 04:56.640
Pokey?!

04:56.640 --> 05:02.640
But the most common complaint about Hunchback as its fatal flaw is simply the way it changes the source material.

05:02.640 --> 05:08.640
It takes this dirge on the barbarism of human nature in which nearly every named character dies

05:08.640 --> 05:12.640
and turns it into this bright and hopeful inspirational tale about social justice, acceptance,

05:12.640 --> 05:14.640
and the ultimate goodness of humanity.

05:14.640 --> 05:18.640
This, according to some, not only misses the mark of what made Notre Dame de Paris work as a story,

05:18.640 --> 05:21.640
but also completely ruins the spirit of Hugo's work

05:21.640 --> 05:24.640
and completely misses the point of what Hugo's novel was about.

05:24.640 --> 05:25.640
I'm losing to a bird!

05:25.640 --> 05:27.640
And you at home may be wondering,

05:27.640 --> 05:32.640
are you really about to explain why Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame actually secretly does

05:32.640 --> 05:35.640
somehow adhere to Victor Hugo's intent?

05:35.640 --> 05:37.640
Well, no. Mostly no.

05:37.640 --> 05:41.640
I'm less interested in Hugo's intent as it pertains to the Disney movie

05:41.640 --> 05:47.640
so much as how it has changed over the decades in various interpretations.

05:47.640 --> 05:50.640
Maybe it has lost Hugo's original intent,

05:50.640 --> 05:53.640
but consider that if this story is to remain relevant,

05:53.640 --> 05:58.640
maybe Hugo's original intent doesn't so much matter as much as the way people reinterpret it.

05:58.640 --> 06:02.640
But you're not like other gypsies. They are evil.

06:02.640 --> 06:07.640
And consider also that Victor Hugo might be okay with that.

06:15.640 --> 06:19.640
This is Notre Dame Cathedral.

06:20.640 --> 06:25.640
Construction began in 1163 after the previous Cathedral of Paris, the 4th century Saint-Ã‰tienne,

06:25.640 --> 06:29.640
was allegedly deemed too shabby for its purposes by Bishop Maurice de Sully.

06:29.640 --> 06:34.640
While it was consecrated in the 1180s, construction itself didn't end until 1345.

06:34.640 --> 06:37.640
Notre Dame Cathedral was an engineering marvel.

06:37.640 --> 06:41.640
It is particularly notable in being one of the first uses of flying buttresses.

06:41.640 --> 06:44.640
If I may draw your attention to the flying buttresses.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.640
And this was not originally planned.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.640
Prior to the hunchback of Notre Dame,

06:48.640 --> 06:52.640
the cathedral had survived both a massive vandalization by the Huguenots in 1548

06:52.640 --> 06:55.640
for being deemed an idolatrous armpit.

06:55.640 --> 06:57.640
In 1793, during the French Revolution,

06:57.640 --> 06:59.640
much of the building was damaged and plundered

06:59.640 --> 07:02.640
during its brief conversion into a temple for the Cult of Reason,

07:02.640 --> 07:07.640
a state-sponsored atheistic religion which threw a lit-ass party inside Notre Dame

07:07.640 --> 07:12.640
called the Fete of Reason as a giant f*** you to both the deposed king and to the Catholic Church.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.640
You know the eyes in the Disney movie?

07:16.640 --> 07:19.640
Well, those guys are supposed to be the original kings of Israel,

07:19.640 --> 07:22.640
but the French revolutionaries thought they were supposed to be kings of France

07:22.640 --> 07:24.640
and so they had them all beheaded.

07:24.640 --> 07:25.640
Yeah, that happened.

07:25.640 --> 07:30.640
By the 1830s, Notre Dame was, shall we say, a little busted.

07:30.640 --> 07:33.640
By Victor Hugo's time, the cathedral was over 500 years old.

07:33.640 --> 07:38.640
By now destroyed by the ravages of time, changing governments, and a general lack of care,

07:38.640 --> 07:43.640
young Victor Hugo begins writing Notre Dame de Paris as a point of interest and research for himself,

07:43.640 --> 07:47.640
entertaining the idea that a piece of writing might draw public interest to the building.

07:47.640 --> 07:50.640
So this was before the modern concept of historical preservation,

07:50.640 --> 07:53.640
an idea which really only took hold in Europe,

07:53.640 --> 07:55.640
and especially in the United States after World War II.

07:55.640 --> 07:58.640
This was largely due to this godmotherf***er named Robert Moses,

07:58.640 --> 08:01.640
who was a city planner for New York City.

08:01.640 --> 08:04.640
The original Madison Square Garden, that eyesore, that's not the original.

08:04.640 --> 08:06.640
That was, you know, a mistake by Robert.

08:09.640 --> 08:10.640
It wasn't even 100 years old.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.640
It was, like, maybe 60 years old,

08:12.640 --> 08:15.640
and he just knocked it down because it was inefficient and it was in the way,

08:15.640 --> 08:17.640
and he was like, no, we need to have, like, the avenue open,

08:17.640 --> 08:18.640
so then he knocked it down.

08:22.640 --> 08:24.640
So, out of pure intellectual curiosity,

08:24.640 --> 08:28.640
and, you know, I'm not a big fan of the idea of the cathedral,

08:28.640 --> 08:30.640
So, out of pure intellectual curiosity,

08:30.640 --> 08:32.640
and, you know, a desire for money,

08:32.640 --> 08:35.640
Victor Hugo takes it upon himself to, well...

08:35.640 --> 08:37.640
Educate yourself!

08:37.640 --> 08:39.640
And he falls in love with it.

08:39.640 --> 08:41.640
You know, the building, that is.

08:41.640 --> 08:43.640
While most of what people actually remember about the book

08:43.640 --> 08:47.640
concerns the melodrama of Esmeralda, Frollo, and Quasimodo,

08:47.640 --> 08:50.640
Notre Dame de Paris, the book, is actually a lengthy screed

08:50.640 --> 08:53.640
about the importance of architecture and the way it shapes the lives,

08:53.640 --> 08:55.640
ideas, and culture of those who occupy its spaces.

08:55.640 --> 08:59.640
That, before the printing press and the subsequent rise of literacy came along,

08:59.640 --> 09:03.640
architecture was the dominant way to communicate and dogmatize big ideas

09:03.640 --> 09:05.640
on a wide scale.

09:05.640 --> 09:08.640
That all of the characters in Notre Dame de Paris are stupid,

09:08.640 --> 09:10.640
or victims, or inept, or cruel,

09:10.640 --> 09:12.640
ultimately, that doesn't matter,

09:12.640 --> 09:15.640
because the building outlives and outlasts

09:15.640 --> 09:17.640
any of these individual humans' flaws,

09:17.640 --> 09:20.640
and ultimately weathers all of humanity's flaws,

09:20.640 --> 09:23.640
and is still a much bigger shaper of French cultural identity

09:23.640 --> 09:25.640
than any of these individual people.

09:25.640 --> 09:28.640
So Victor Hugo wants to write a story to spark the public's imagination

09:28.640 --> 09:32.640
and make them fall in love with this piece of history and architecture like he did.

09:32.640 --> 09:35.640
At the time, Hugo was already a successful playwright and essayist,

09:35.640 --> 09:39.640
but with the rise in popularity of this new, exciting form of writing called

09:39.640 --> 09:42.640
the novel, that would earn Hugo international fame.

09:42.640 --> 09:46.640
So in 1828, Hugo signs a contract with publisher Gosselin

09:46.640 --> 09:48.640
to write this book about Notre Dame de Paris

09:48.640 --> 09:52.640
for a really pretty sizable, for that time, advance of 4,000 francs,

09:52.640 --> 09:56.640
with the promise that it would be done in April of 1829.

09:56.640 --> 09:58.640
But like most writers, zing,

09:58.640 --> 10:00.640
Hugo quickly burns through the advance

10:00.640 --> 10:02.640
and puts off writing the book longer and longer

10:02.640 --> 10:05.640
so he can stay in his comfort zone of writing plays.

10:05.640 --> 10:09.640
So time passes, he hasn't really done any work on this book,

10:09.640 --> 10:12.640
but then he goes ahead and starts trying to sell the stage rights

10:12.640 --> 10:14.640
to a completely different publisher,

10:14.640 --> 10:17.640
but then his original publisher that gave him this giant advance

10:17.640 --> 10:21.640
finds out about this and is rightfully really pissed.

10:21.640 --> 10:23.640
So after some negotiating,

10:23.640 --> 10:25.640
Hugo successfully convinces the publisher

10:25.640 --> 10:29.640
to push the publication deadline back to December 30th of 1830.

10:29.640 --> 10:31.640
But then the July Revolution happens because it's France,

10:31.640 --> 10:35.640
and early 19th century France was averaging about one revolution per month,

10:35.640 --> 10:40.640
and Hugo ultimately finishes the novel on January 14th of 1831.

10:40.640 --> 10:44.640
While there were socialist undertones in later adaptations of Notre Dame de Paris,

10:44.640 --> 10:46.640
and even in Hugo's later works,

10:46.640 --> 10:50.640
it's safe to say, you know, he was a businessman,

10:50.640 --> 10:52.640
and if he and Walt Disney had been contemporaries,

10:52.640 --> 10:57.640
they probably would have at least shared a good, firm, respectful handshake.

10:57.640 --> 11:00.640
And if a Burger King commercial where a nine-year-old girl

11:00.640 --> 11:03.640
happily plays with a puppet of Quasimodo seems gauche,

11:03.640 --> 11:05.640
It was Quasimodo!

11:05.640 --> 11:08.640
everything points to this author having dollar signs in his eyes,

11:08.640 --> 11:11.640
or frank signs, before the book was even finished.

11:11.640 --> 11:13.640
If Burger King had existed in 1830s France,

11:13.640 --> 11:17.640
I'm sure all the kids would be wanting a Quasimodo textile mill finger protector.

11:17.640 --> 11:20.640
And then, I got carried away just like Quasimodo.

11:20.640 --> 11:22.640
I'm losing to a bird!

11:22.640 --> 11:24.640
But here's the most important thing for Hugo.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.640
It worked.

11:32.640 --> 11:37.640
Did you just hide a stack of cocaine there?

11:37.640 --> 11:39.640
Through writing this novel and his activism,

11:39.640 --> 11:41.640
Hugo saved Notre Dame.

11:41.640 --> 11:45.640
He woke people up to this historical and architectural marvel sitting in their midst.

11:45.640 --> 11:48.640
And that new consciousness led to an extensive renovation in 1845,

11:48.640 --> 11:50.640
led by V. Le Duc,

11:50.640 --> 11:53.640
including the addition of this spire that Quasimodo sings on,

11:53.640 --> 11:56.640
which was definitely not there in the 14th century.

11:56.640 --> 12:01.640
And that is why Notre Dame Cathedral is the fancy tourist attraction we know and love today.

12:01.640 --> 12:05.640
But the veneration of this building was not the main reason why the book got so big.

12:05.640 --> 12:09.640
So, before we cast dispersions on Disney for changing things,

12:09.640 --> 12:11.640
first we must ask,

12:11.640 --> 12:15.640
what is The Hunchback of Notre Dame about?

12:20.640 --> 12:24.640
While I think it's fair to assume that most modern audiences associate this story

12:24.640 --> 12:27.640
with themes of social justice and progressive societal change,

12:27.640 --> 12:31.640
this is more a product of pop culture adaptations than of the book itself.

12:31.640 --> 12:32.640
More on that later.

12:32.640 --> 12:35.640
The novel concerns itself very little with the plight of marginalized groups,

12:35.640 --> 12:39.640
and has a much darker, more cynical take on society and humanity at large.

12:39.640 --> 12:43.640
Quasimodo is a curmudgeonly lapdog who does Frollo's dirty work for him,

12:43.640 --> 12:45.640
and he's also deaf from those bells,

12:45.640 --> 12:49.640
and does not have the angelic voice of human flower crown Tom Hulse.

12:49.640 --> 12:52.640
Knowing them is they will never know me.

12:52.640 --> 12:55.640
Claude Frollo is a straight-up attempted rapist.

12:55.640 --> 12:58.640
Phoebus resembles Gaston more than any other Disney character.

12:58.640 --> 13:02.640
He's just down to nut, but at the end of the day, Phoebus is only here for Phoebus.

13:02.640 --> 13:06.640
Esmeralda is your basic romantic representation of a Madonna horror trope

13:06.640 --> 13:10.640
sprinkled with some genuinely harmful racism that gets buried in later adaptations.

13:10.640 --> 13:13.640
You find out at the end that Esmeralda isn't really Romani.

13:13.640 --> 13:16.640
She's actually a white girl who was stolen as a baby.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.640
Yeah.

13:18.640 --> 13:20.640
Yeah, they cut that out in the Disney movie.

13:20.640 --> 13:22.640
Yes, good. Thank you, Disney.

13:22.640 --> 13:25.640
Stay away, child. They're gypsies.

13:25.640 --> 13:27.640
Esmeralda is reunited with her birth mother,

13:27.640 --> 13:31.640
who is also a wayfish, tragic, driven mad by having lost her baby,

13:31.640 --> 13:34.640
right before both characters die horribly.

13:34.640 --> 13:37.640
In fact, everybody dies horribly, except for Phoebus,

13:37.640 --> 13:40.640
and a not-so-subtle stand-in character for Victor Hugo,

13:40.640 --> 13:42.640
Pierre Gringoire, who was cut from the Disney movie.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.640
He is a poet, and at the end of the novel,

13:44.640 --> 13:47.640
when given the choice to save the life of either Esmeralda or the goat,

13:47.640 --> 13:50.640
but not both, he saves the goat.

13:50.640 --> 13:55.640
Yeah, the goat lives. And yes, the goat was created by Victor Hugo, not Disney.

13:55.640 --> 13:58.640
The main plot that takes up most adaptations that we know

13:58.640 --> 14:01.640
is the background noise to Hugo's main point,

14:01.640 --> 14:03.640
which can be summed up with the following excerpt.

14:03.640 --> 14:05.640
Our readers must excuse us if we stop a moment

14:05.640 --> 14:08.640
to investigate the enigmatic words of the archdeacon.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.640
This will kill that. The book will kill the edifice.

14:11.640 --> 14:14.640
Victor Hugo's book was mainly concerned with how the printed press,

14:14.640 --> 14:16.640
and subsequently, mass literacy,

14:16.640 --> 14:21.640
would kill what he perceived as the original common language, architecture.

14:21.640 --> 14:24.640
So the themes we, the modern audience, have come to associate

14:24.640 --> 14:26.640
with The Hunchback of Notre Dame,

14:26.640 --> 14:28.640
whether everyone lives at the end or not,

14:28.640 --> 14:32.640
these were not themes that were necessarily present in the original novel.

14:32.640 --> 14:35.640
The original novel was not terribly concerned

14:35.640 --> 14:37.640
with the plight of the marginalized or the abused.

14:37.640 --> 14:41.640
Victor Hugo was so unconcerned with the main melodrama, we know,

14:41.640 --> 14:43.640
that when the original English-language translator,

14:43.640 --> 14:46.640
Frederic Chaubert, switched the title from Notre Dame de Paris

14:46.640 --> 14:48.640
to The Hunchback of Notre Dame,

14:48.640 --> 14:50.640
essentially because it sounded, I don't know,

14:50.640 --> 14:52.640
more tantalizing to English-speaking audiences,

14:52.640 --> 14:55.640
Hugo was notoriously pissed off.

14:55.640 --> 14:58.640
So there's an interesting irony in a book that says,

14:58.640 --> 15:01.640
this will kill that, the book will kill the edifice.

15:01.640 --> 15:05.640
Its original meaning and intent will get killed off by...

15:05.640 --> 15:08.640
Visual Mass Media!

15:14.640 --> 15:17.640
One does not go from a dark and violent story

15:17.640 --> 15:19.640
about fate and death of the church to...

15:19.640 --> 15:21.640
Omelos into a bird!

15:21.640 --> 15:22.640
...so easily.

15:22.640 --> 15:24.640
Let's look at a few examples.

15:24.640 --> 15:27.640
La Esmeralda was an opera written in 1836,

15:27.640 --> 15:30.640
and if you're wondering why this production that I pulled

15:30.640 --> 15:33.640
looks like a production of Rent with priests in it,

15:33.640 --> 15:35.640
I kind of wonder that too.

15:35.640 --> 15:37.640
This opera failed in a big way,

15:37.640 --> 15:41.640
so it doesn't get like 600 productions a year like La BohÃ¨me does.

15:41.640 --> 15:44.640
La Esmeralda has a much less dour ending than the book.

15:44.640 --> 15:46.640
Censors demanded that every reference to Claude Frollo

15:46.640 --> 15:48.640
being a priest be removed, and lo,

15:48.640 --> 15:51.640
the framework of modern adaptation begins.

15:51.640 --> 15:54.640
Quasimodo in this version was shunted to minor character status,

15:54.640 --> 15:58.640
and while Phoebus ends up dying a noble death because of love,

15:58.640 --> 16:00.640
La Esmeralda survives.

16:00.640 --> 16:02.640
And this stage adaptation was written by...

16:02.640 --> 16:04.640
Victor Hugo?

16:04.640 --> 16:05.640
Yeah.

16:05.640 --> 16:07.640
Even though this version is largely forgotten by history,

16:07.640 --> 16:10.640
it is relevant because we already see the author actively engaged

16:10.640 --> 16:13.640
in rewriting his own book for a mass visual consumption

16:13.640 --> 16:17.640
and boulderizing its own message to make it palatable for a larger audience.

16:17.640 --> 16:20.640
I've got a hunch this bites.

16:20.640 --> 16:23.640
La Esmeralda was followed by multiple adaptations over the following decades,

16:23.640 --> 16:26.640
and the material was retrofitted again with the rise of film,

16:26.640 --> 16:29.640
including one version directed by Alice Guy-Blanche in 1905.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.640
But for the purposes of this video,

16:31.640 --> 16:36.640
let's skip ahead in time to the 1923 Hollywood movie starring Lon Chaney,

16:36.640 --> 16:39.640
the first adaptation that was a massive success.

16:39.640 --> 16:43.640
Not only did this film bring Hunchback back to the popular consciousness in a big way,

16:43.640 --> 16:47.640
it also positioned Quasimodo as one of the original universal movie monsters.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.640
Lon Chaney wanted to be Quasimodo to the point where he was actually looking

16:50.640 --> 16:54.640
to form his own production company for the sole purpose of getting this movie made.

16:54.640 --> 16:57.640
Producer Irving Thalberg had been wanting to make a big production

16:57.640 --> 17:00.640
that was more epic and adult than the usual universal fare,

17:00.640 --> 17:04.640
and pitched it to studio head Carl Laemmle as a love story,

17:04.640 --> 17:10.640
and thus the Hunchback of Notre Dame tragic love story entered the public consciousness.

17:10.640 --> 17:12.640
The film banked a record $3 million,

17:12.640 --> 17:15.640
and got the ball rolling in this conga line of film versions,

17:15.640 --> 17:18.640
and why you will eventually have to sit through the Dark Universe version

17:18.640 --> 17:21.640
of Hunchback starring Ansel Elgort in 2021.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.640
I hope. Please God, let it happen. I want it.

17:24.640 --> 17:29.640
Frollo is still not a priest, although his brother Jehan, a minor character in the book, is.

17:29.640 --> 17:31.640
And Phoebus is good now.

17:31.640 --> 17:34.640
Quasimodo dies at the end so the breeding pair can go forth unfettered,

17:34.640 --> 17:37.640
because he is an uggo and, well, really,

17:37.640 --> 17:41.640
this is about as nice of a monster as you were going to get out of a 1923 movie.

17:41.640 --> 17:46.640
But all in all, despite this being one of the last big versions with the Esmeralda racism reveal,

17:46.640 --> 17:49.640
it's still fairly conventional 1920s fluff.

17:49.640 --> 17:54.640
But already in 1923, we have lost any real connection to Victor Hugo's message

17:54.640 --> 17:56.640
about the novel destroying the edifice.

17:56.640 --> 18:00.640
Because visual mass media has destroyed the novel.

18:09.640 --> 18:14.640
No, no, no. Don't spoil the fun, Frollo. Stay here.

18:14.640 --> 18:20.640
In 1939, Hollywood producer Pandro S. Berman demanded an exact remake of the Lon Chaney film,

18:20.640 --> 18:24.640
reusing a majority of the sets from the 1923 version.

18:24.640 --> 18:28.640
William Dieterle, already a successful director in his own right before fleeing Nazi Germany,

18:28.640 --> 18:30.640
delivered on this for Berman.

18:30.640 --> 18:34.640
Charles Lawton starred, delivering a truly memorable performance as Quasimodo.

18:34.640 --> 18:39.640
Why was I not made of stone like thee?

18:40.640 --> 18:45.640
And at Lawton's own behest, they brought in relative newcomer Maureen O'Hara to star as Esmeralda,

18:45.640 --> 18:48.640
who in this version is not a stolen white baby, but actually Romani.

18:48.640 --> 18:54.640
So... I'm not sure where this falls in the whitewashing conversation, but there you go.

18:54.640 --> 18:55.640
She's a gypsy, sir.

18:55.640 --> 18:58.640
Who cares about her race? She's pretty.

18:58.640 --> 19:02.640
And it is this version more than any other, including the original novel,

19:02.640 --> 19:04.640
that Disney borrows from the most.

19:04.640 --> 19:10.640
There is also a very sharp humanist lean into the concept of justice in regard to people versus buildings in history.

19:10.640 --> 19:15.640
Esmeralda in this version isn't just some innocent hottie who wanders into misfortune by pure bad luck.

19:15.640 --> 19:20.640
She literally breaks into the city of Paris, where the Romani have been actively banned from,

19:20.640 --> 19:23.640
to plead with the king of France to let her people live freely.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.640
They tell me gypsies are a lot of thieves.

19:25.640 --> 19:27.640
That's not true, your majesty.

19:27.640 --> 19:30.640
Whenever we steal, it's because we're hungry.

19:31.640 --> 19:34.640
My people have good hearts, and we love you.

19:35.640 --> 19:40.640
You have a good heart too, sir, because you've promised to help us.

19:41.640 --> 19:46.640
It is also one of the rare versions where the Romani are not demonized in some way, shape, or form.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.640
Still looking at you, Disney.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.640
The lame can walk.

19:50.640 --> 19:52.640
And the blind can see.

19:52.640 --> 19:54.640
But the dead don't talk.

19:54.640 --> 19:57.640
Their plight is just that, a plight.

19:57.640 --> 19:58.640
Why do you stop us?

19:58.640 --> 20:01.640
Because no gypsies can enter Paris any longer without a permit.

20:01.640 --> 20:02.640
It's the new law.

20:02.640 --> 20:04.640
If the others cannot too, why can't we?

20:04.640 --> 20:06.640
They are Frenchmen. You're gypsies. Foreigners.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.640
You came yesterday, we come today.

20:10.640 --> 20:15.640
The movie is constantly reminding us that the lives of innocent, persecuted people are at stake.

20:15.640 --> 20:19.640
The Esmeralda, Quasimodo, Frollo melodrama that everyone loves is still in there, sure,

20:19.640 --> 20:22.640
but there is an active undercurrent in this movie that ties in with bigger struggles

20:22.640 --> 20:25.640
that isn't just an old building that has weathered time.

20:25.640 --> 20:29.640
The Hunchback of Notre Dame was the only film that was screened in Cannes that year,

20:29.640 --> 20:34.640
a film festival which was itself created in opposition to the fascist presence at the Venice Film Festival.

20:34.640 --> 20:37.640
So that a movie that features the Romani as a persecuted underclass

20:37.640 --> 20:41.640
while Hitler was gearing up to slaughter hundreds of thousands of them

20:41.640 --> 20:44.640
at a festival that was created to oppose Nazism,

20:44.640 --> 20:46.640
there's something incredibly powerful in that.

20:46.640 --> 20:50.640
Something that has nothing to do with Hugo's original intent.

20:50.640 --> 20:53.640
So with the success of this movie, and it was a huge success,

20:53.640 --> 20:57.640
we gain the justice for the oppressed theme which plays very heavily into the Disney version.

20:57.640 --> 21:01.640
So in a lot of ways, this adaptation is certainly the most cohesive,

21:01.640 --> 21:05.640
and it is telling that many future adaptations try to mimic the anti-fascist theming,

21:05.640 --> 21:06.640
Justice!

21:06.640 --> 21:09.640
while at the same time not always grasping it.

21:09.640 --> 21:12.640
We find you totally innocent.

21:12.640 --> 21:15.640
Which is the worst crime of all.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.640
So you're going to pay!

21:18.640 --> 21:24.640
So, it's 1992, and Disney is plotting out its five-year plan for the conquest of Earth

21:24.640 --> 21:29.640
after the staggering success of Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and The Little Mermaid.

21:29.640 --> 21:35.640
If Disney wants to adapt Notre Dame de Paris, which version do they really want to adapt?

21:35.640 --> 21:39.640
Right off the bat, it's fallacious to look at Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame

21:39.640 --> 21:41.640
as an adaptation of the original novel,

21:41.640 --> 21:46.640
because that read ignores a whole century and a half of filmmakers recontextualizing the story for each new generation.

21:46.640 --> 21:50.640
Again, the idea for the Disney movie didn't come from the original novel,

21:50.640 --> 21:52.640
but from a picture book adaptation of it.

21:52.640 --> 21:57.640
And even if the original Notre Dame de Paris was as close to perfection as the early novel could get,

21:57.640 --> 21:59.640
film is just a different medium.

21:59.640 --> 22:02.640
It's a common fallacy that adaptational changes happen

22:02.640 --> 22:06.640
because greedy filmmakers want to bastardize and water down a beloved creation

22:06.640 --> 22:08.640
to get as many butts in seats as possible.

22:08.640 --> 22:10.640
Why, I'm the Captain the Hat!

22:10.640 --> 22:12.640
And well, that is sometimes true,

22:12.640 --> 22:17.640
but just as often it's changing the story to fit a visually temporally locked medium.

22:17.640 --> 22:20.640
Yes, sometimes adaptations are cheap cash-ins,

22:20.640 --> 22:24.640
but it is just inaccurate to assume that all Hollywood adaptations are

22:24.640 --> 22:28.640
when there are often teams of artists that care deeply about making the best product possible,

22:28.640 --> 22:31.640
which usually means changing some stuff.

22:31.640 --> 22:35.640
But more to the point, aside from the fact that the Disney movie changes the ending in a big way,

22:35.640 --> 22:37.640
and that's the aspect that people tend to focus on,

22:37.640 --> 22:39.640
what did it really change?

22:39.640 --> 22:43.640
Rather, the real question is, what versions did Disney pull from?

22:43.640 --> 22:47.640
Because the real originality is in the aesthetics, the music, the visuals,

22:47.640 --> 22:48.640
not so much the story.

22:48.640 --> 22:52.640
That Frollo is no longer a priest comes from Hugo himself in La Esmeralda.

22:52.640 --> 22:55.640
Same with Phoebus being a good guy and not everybody dying.

22:55.640 --> 22:57.640
And that theme of justice for the oppressed,

22:57.640 --> 23:01.640
well, we can thank Charles Laughton and a German filmmaker fleeing the Nazis for that.

23:01.640 --> 23:06.640
The God Help the Outcast musical number pulls heavily from this scene in the 1939 version.

23:06.640 --> 23:10.640
Give me a rich husband. Give me many admirers. Give me beauty.

23:10.640 --> 23:13.640
Give me a rich highness. Give me peace of mind.

23:13.640 --> 23:17.640
Give me happiness. Take all I have. But please help my people.

23:17.640 --> 23:24.640
I ask for nothing. I can get by.

23:24.640 --> 23:31.640
Please help my people, the poor and downtrod.

23:31.640 --> 23:34.640
Or this scene of Phoebus rallying the citizens of Paris.

23:34.640 --> 23:37.640
Citizens of Paris.

23:37.640 --> 23:40.640
Parisians! Parisians!

23:40.640 --> 23:44.640
That also borrows from Gringoire doing similar in the 1939 movie.

23:44.640 --> 23:47.640
But let's take a look at what the themes of the Disney movie even are.

23:47.640 --> 23:49.640
I think Esmeralda put it best.

23:49.640 --> 23:50.640
Justice!

23:50.640 --> 23:52.640
First, there is the theme of oppression and injustice.

23:52.640 --> 24:00.640
Judge Claude Frollo longed to purge the world of vice and sin.

24:00.640 --> 24:04.640
Interrupt judge Claude Frollo begins the film by way of unjust oppression.

24:04.640 --> 24:12.640
And for one time in his life of power and control,

24:12.640 --> 24:19.640
Frollo felt a twinge of fear for his immortal soul.

24:19.640 --> 24:20.640
What must I do?

24:20.640 --> 24:22.640
Then there's the theme of humility before God,

24:22.640 --> 24:25.640
and that Notre Dame itself acts as a sort of embodiment of God.

24:25.640 --> 24:30.640
You never can run from nor hide what you've done from the eyes.

24:30.640 --> 24:37.640
The very eyes of Notre Dame.

24:37.640 --> 24:42.640
By basically embodying injustice, Frollo positions himself as an enemy of God.

24:42.640 --> 24:46.640
But that Quasimodo embodies justice positions him as almost angelic.

24:46.640 --> 24:49.640
Observe the contradiction between heaven's light...

24:49.640 --> 24:57.640
I swear it must be heaven's light.

24:57.640 --> 24:58.640
And hellfire.

24:58.640 --> 25:03.640
Like fire, hellfire.

25:03.640 --> 25:06.640
But the unique thematic element in the Disney movie is this.

25:06.640 --> 25:11.640
Who is the monster and who is the man?

25:11.640 --> 25:14.640
This idea is present to some extent in all of the versions,

25:14.640 --> 25:20.640
but the Disney version is the first to put this theme of internal versus external monsterhood front and center.

25:20.640 --> 25:21.640
You are deformed.

25:21.640 --> 25:22.640
I am deformed.

25:22.640 --> 25:23.640
And you are ugly.

25:23.640 --> 25:24.640
And I am ugly.

25:24.640 --> 25:29.640
Quasimodo, and indeed everyone but Esmeralda, take it for granted that he is a monster, you know.

25:29.640 --> 25:31.640
I am a monster, you know.

25:31.640 --> 25:33.640
Because of the way that he looks.

25:33.640 --> 25:35.640
But it is Frollo who is the monster.

25:35.640 --> 25:38.640
The most monstrous character Disney has ever created.

25:38.640 --> 25:40.640
It's not my fault.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.640
I'm not to blame.

25:42.640 --> 25:46.640
Because he is much more grounded and real than any other Disney villain.

25:46.640 --> 25:51.640
This, aside from the general quality of the writing, is what makes hellfire so brilliant.

25:51.640 --> 25:53.640
Protect me, Maria.

25:53.640 --> 25:56.640
Don't let the siren cast her spell.

25:56.640 --> 26:01.640
Don't let her fire sear my flesh and bone.

26:01.640 --> 26:05.640
Unlike other Disney villain songs where they're just singing about how being evil is fun...

26:05.640 --> 26:11.640
An even grimmer plot has been simmering in my great criminal brain.

26:11.640 --> 26:15.640
Hellfire is about the anguish it causes him to be the way that he is.

26:15.640 --> 26:17.640
It's not my fault.

26:17.640 --> 26:25.640
If in God's plan, he made the devil so much stronger than a man.

26:25.640 --> 26:28.640
Said Kirk Wise in a 1996 Chicago Tribune article,

26:28.640 --> 26:30.640
As we were exploring the characters, especially Frollo,

26:30.640 --> 26:34.640
we certainly found a lot of historical parallels to the type of mania he had.

26:34.640 --> 26:37.640
The Confederate South, Nazi Germany, take your pick.

26:37.640 --> 26:41.640
And it is in their interactions with Esmeralda that their relative monsterhood is revealed.

26:41.640 --> 26:43.640
I am a monster, you know.

26:43.640 --> 26:47.640
So, yeah, hold on, I am about to defend this creative decision, bear with me.

26:47.640 --> 26:54.640
I remember even back in 1996 hearing the argument where if differently abled kids should see themselves just as valuable as everyone else,

26:54.640 --> 26:57.640
then why doesn't Quasimodo get the girl at the end?

26:57.640 --> 27:01.640
To which I would respond, A, getting the girl as a reward should never be the goal.

27:01.640 --> 27:09.640
And let her taste the fires of hell, or else let her be mine and mine alone.

27:09.640 --> 27:12.640
And B, it's what sets Quasimodo apart from Frollo.

27:12.640 --> 27:15.640
He accepts and values Esmeralda's friendship,

27:15.640 --> 27:21.640
but he's also able to let her go so she can be with the guy who was basically an accessory to genocide up until about five minutes ago.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.640
He's fine with it.

27:23.640 --> 27:24.640
He's fine.

27:24.640 --> 27:25.640
Really.

27:25.640 --> 27:26.640
He's fine.

27:26.640 --> 27:27.640
See?

27:27.640 --> 27:28.640
He's fine.

27:28.640 --> 27:29.640
He's fine.

27:29.640 --> 27:30.640
It's fine.

27:30.640 --> 27:31.640
It's fine.

27:31.640 --> 27:33.640
This is fine.

27:33.640 --> 27:35.640
It's fine.

27:35.640 --> 27:41.640
See again that contrast between heaven's light and hell fire, both of which revolve around Esmeralda.

27:41.640 --> 27:46.640
Esmeralda gives Quasimodo positive attention, and that's the first time he's ever experienced that.

27:46.640 --> 27:48.640
Do you think I'm evil?

27:48.640 --> 27:49.640
No.

27:49.640 --> 27:52.640
No, no, you were kind and good and...

27:52.640 --> 27:53.640
And a gypsy.

27:53.640 --> 27:56.640
And maybe Frollo's wrong about the both of us.

27:56.640 --> 27:59.640
And his hope is that she might one day love him.

27:59.640 --> 28:04.640
I dare to dream that she might even care for me.

28:04.640 --> 28:09.640
But Frollo's position is, if I can't have her, literally possess her, no one can.

28:09.640 --> 28:20.640
Destroy Esmeralda and let her taste the fires of hell, or else let her be mine and mine alone.

28:20.640 --> 28:23.640
So this is the binary between a monster and a man.

28:23.640 --> 28:26.640
Quasimodo respects Esmeralda's autonomy and he lets her go.

28:26.640 --> 28:28.640
Frollo would rather die.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.640
So, this is fine.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.640
He's fine.

28:32.640 --> 28:33.640
It's fine.

28:33.640 --> 28:35.640
He's fine.

28:35.640 --> 28:36.640
This is fine.

28:36.640 --> 28:38.640
It's fine.

28:38.640 --> 28:39.640
He's fine.

28:39.640 --> 28:41.640
This is fine.

28:41.640 --> 28:42.640
It's fine.

28:42.640 --> 28:45.640
Don't worry, they give him a hot, clumsy girlfriend in the sequel.

28:45.640 --> 28:48.640
Was it just a lucky day?

28:48.640 --> 28:52.640
That he turned and looked my way?

28:52.640 --> 28:56.640
And on that same token, that's part of why Quasimodo needs to not die at the end of this version.

28:56.640 --> 29:01.640
Losing his love, either to someone else or to death by hanging, doesn't kill him.

29:01.640 --> 29:04.640
Part of Quasimodo's goodness stems from him being stronger than that.

29:04.640 --> 29:09.640
And rather than getting a sexy lamp as a reward, he finds happiness in being accepted by the people,

29:09.640 --> 29:17.640
which is maybe a touch unrealistic, but certainly a better message than either dying or getting a sexy lamp as a reward.

29:17.640 --> 29:21.640
And to be clear, Esmeralda in this version is super proactive and not a sexy lamp.

29:21.640 --> 29:25.640
And Quasimodo, unlike Frollo, does not see women as possessions.

29:25.640 --> 29:31.640
But there's a lot going on here that kind of gets buried under the criticism that they changed the ending and therefore softened it.

29:31.640 --> 29:38.640
Even with the damned gargoyles in the picture, the overall dark tone kind of worked against the movie's favorability ratings.

29:38.640 --> 29:42.640
Even at the time, a huge part of the confused reaction was the distance between the marketing...

29:42.640 --> 29:45.640
I think the cavalry's here!

29:45.640 --> 29:48.640
This coming summer, experience the adventure.

29:48.640 --> 29:49.640
Sit.

29:49.640 --> 29:52.640
Mom and dad had a special surprise waiting for me.

29:52.640 --> 29:54.640
It was Quasimodo!

29:54.640 --> 29:56.640
You are deformed.

29:56.640 --> 29:57.640
I am deformed.

29:57.640 --> 29:58.640
And you are ugly.

29:58.640 --> 29:59.640
And I am ugly.

29:59.640 --> 30:02.640
And these are crimes for which the world shows little pity.

30:02.640 --> 30:05.640
Partly because people thought it was too serious and too dark.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.640
Now your kids can get all four puppets.

30:09.640 --> 30:11.640
Take them from her.

30:16.640 --> 30:19.640
This is an unholy demon. I'm sending it back to hell.

30:20.640 --> 30:28.640
The marketing department at that time thought, well, we'll maybe fool people into thinking that it's a lighthearted, happy Disney.

30:28.640 --> 30:31.640
And then I got carried away just like Quasimodo.

30:36.640 --> 30:39.640
They'll play up the gargoyles and they'll play up the feast of fools.

30:39.640 --> 30:44.640
And so all the marketing at that time was, it's a celebration. It's a festival.

30:44.640 --> 30:48.640
It took nearly 20 years before we saw that coveted stage musical,

30:48.640 --> 30:54.640
and with it attempts to address some of the criticism about the weird tonal dissonance in the Disney movie by sticking closer to the original novel.

30:54.640 --> 30:58.640
It ran in Germany for several years before premiering with a revised book in America,

30:58.640 --> 31:02.640
with performances in San Diego and at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey.

31:02.640 --> 31:05.640
It never made it to Broadway and probably never will for...

31:05.640 --> 31:08.640
union reasons.

31:08.640 --> 31:10.640
I'll just leave it at that.

31:10.640 --> 31:11.640
Union stuff.

31:11.640 --> 31:16.640
The American production goes even darker, sticking much closer to the Everybody Dies ending,

31:16.640 --> 31:22.640
but I'd argue it ends up being less enjoyable than the movie because it runs into the same tone problem, but now in the opposite direction.

31:22.640 --> 31:27.640
It builds on the same foundation as the movie, but then it has a different payoff that isn't really built to.

31:27.640 --> 31:29.640
It's different, not better.

31:29.640 --> 31:35.640
It was less successful, however, than the most financially lucrative non-English language musical in history,

31:35.640 --> 31:38.640
Notre Dame de Paris, the French Quebecois musical,

31:38.640 --> 31:42.640
which, while one of the more accurate adaptations of Hunchback...

32:01.640 --> 32:07.640
Well, if your cheese is three men wailing melodramatically over a hot lady to a Chris Isaac song by way of spa music,

32:07.640 --> 32:10.640
then Notre Dame de Paris is for you.

32:10.640 --> 32:14.640
There's always a desire to tell and retell popular stories.

32:14.640 --> 32:16.640
This is how we share and create culture.

32:16.640 --> 32:20.640
In some ways, this is the reason why culture even exists.

32:20.640 --> 32:25.640
So it's important to understand not just that stories sometimes change, but why.

32:25.640 --> 32:32.640
The changes to Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame weren't just rooted in the fact that it's Disney and we can't just kill everybody.

32:32.640 --> 32:35.640
And yet it's a lot lighter than the novel.

32:35.640 --> 32:38.640
Oh, absolutely. In the novel, everybody dies.

32:38.640 --> 32:40.640
Although that is certainly a part of it.

32:40.640 --> 32:43.640
Changes to narratives over time are inevitable.

32:43.640 --> 32:49.640
And in the case of Notre Dame de Paris, it's because sometimes problems actually do get addressed.

32:49.640 --> 32:54.640
Historical preservation wasn't really a thing in the 1830s, especially in France.

32:54.640 --> 32:58.640
But now it's hard to imagine a France where historical preservation isn't a huge priority.

32:58.640 --> 33:01.640
And a lot of that is thanks to Victor Hugo.

33:01.640 --> 33:07.640
Several years before publishing Notre Dame de Paris, Hugo wrote an essay called War on the Demolishers, in which he stated,

33:07.640 --> 33:10.640
The hammer that is mutilating the face of the country must be stopped.

33:10.640 --> 33:13.640
One law would suffice. Let us pass it.

33:13.640 --> 33:18.640
Whatever the property rights may be, we must not allow the destruction of a historical and monumental edifice

33:18.640 --> 33:22.640
by these ignoble speculators whose honor has been blinded by self-interest.

33:22.640 --> 33:26.640
We would want to reconstruct these prodigious edifices, but we would not be able to.

33:26.640 --> 33:29.640
We no longer possess the genius of centuries past.

33:29.640 --> 33:31.640
Industry has replaced art.

33:31.640 --> 33:35.640
We can't step into the reality where Hugo never existed, so we will never know.

33:35.640 --> 33:41.640
But it is fair to say that if not for the hunchback of Notre Dame, Notre Dame Cathedral might not even be there today.

33:41.640 --> 33:44.640
Or at least, it would still be pretty busted.

33:44.640 --> 33:49.640
But we live in a world now, in Europe anyway, where Hugo's primary concern was solved.

33:49.640 --> 33:53.640
So if this story is going to stick around, it needs a new concern.

33:53.640 --> 33:55.640
A more humanist one.

33:55.640 --> 34:00.640
Hugo's writing changed priorities as the priorities of the time he was living in changed.

34:00.640 --> 34:04.640
And I think that shift in perspective is no better illustrated than in Hugo's other great work, Les Miserables,

34:04.640 --> 34:08.640
which takes a wildly different attitude on the value of human life.

34:08.640 --> 34:13.640
Les Mis's theme is that individual lives, though crushed by an unjust system, do matter,

34:13.640 --> 34:15.640
and the choices of individuals do affect history.

34:15.640 --> 34:19.640
Just look at the kindly bishop who didn't turn in Jean Valjean at the beginning of the novel,

34:19.640 --> 34:23.640
and gave him a second chance, and how Jean Valjean uses that second chance to better the lives of others.

34:23.640 --> 34:27.640
This is a primary theme of Les Mis, human goodness overcoming unjust systems.

34:27.640 --> 34:32.640
So Notre Dame de Paris gets this sort of makeover where it's sort of making the same point as Les Mis,

34:32.640 --> 34:34.640
justice for the oppressed.

34:34.640 --> 34:38.640
True monstrousness is not a reflection of how society sees you, or what you look like.

34:38.640 --> 34:42.640
And inhumanly strong protagonists. Hugo was a big fan of those.

34:42.640 --> 34:47.640
If you want to decry the Disney movie for the changes they made to make it kid-friendly, well, that's fine.

34:47.640 --> 34:51.640
But if one calls out the happy ending because it blunts the original misanthropic tone of the novel,

34:51.640 --> 34:57.640
but doesn't call out the anti-inequality or social justice aspects, well, it's not only missing the forest for the trees,

34:57.640 --> 35:01.640
but it's also a rather shallow reading and omits basically all of the context in history.

35:01.640 --> 35:05.640
And yeah, part of that is just Disney being Disney, but part of that is what we need now.

35:05.640 --> 35:10.640
Like Hugo making a point about the historical importance of the building was what we needed in the 1830s.

35:10.640 --> 35:15.640
Quasimodo has gone from pitiable wretch and tool of the system to a movie monster,

35:15.640 --> 35:19.640
and then back to pitiable wretch but nicer this time, and then all the way to hero of his own story.

35:20.640 --> 35:26.640
It's also noteworthy how really the Disney version is the only version that explores how abusive and weird Quasimodo's relationship with Frollo is,

35:26.640 --> 35:28.640
and has him overcoming it.

35:28.640 --> 35:31.640
All my life you have told me that the world is a dark, cruel place,

35:31.640 --> 35:35.640
but now I see that the only thing dark and cruel about it is people like you.

35:39.640 --> 35:43.640
And it really is remarkable that Disney had a protagonist with a legit physical deformity.

35:43.640 --> 35:46.640
And I don't mean, like, beastly deformity.

35:46.640 --> 35:50.640
I can't think of another kids movie that does that except, well, arguably Shrek,

35:50.640 --> 35:54.640
and Shrek, well, Shrek looks like 90% of stand-up comedians.

35:54.640 --> 35:57.640
This movie was the first that went into production after Aladdin was a huge success,

35:57.640 --> 36:01.640
and it shows with these forced comedy elements that have only aged more poorly over time.

36:01.640 --> 36:04.640
Fly, my pretty, fly, fly!

36:08.640 --> 36:11.640
And improvising Robin Williams is not the same as Jason Alexander.

36:11.640 --> 36:14.640
All right, all right! Pour the wine and cut the cheese!

36:14.640 --> 36:16.640
Disservice though it may have been to this movie,

36:16.640 --> 36:20.640
Disney did eventually relearn that not all sidekicks have to be voiced by comedians.

36:20.640 --> 36:21.640
Eventually.

36:23.640 --> 36:27.640
But in a lot of ways, Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame was ahead of its time.

36:27.640 --> 36:28.640
It's still a hot mess.

36:33.640 --> 36:36.640
Easy as it is to say, it's great, except for the gargoyles.

36:36.640 --> 36:38.640
The gargoyles are still there.

36:38.640 --> 36:40.640
Yet it's still a cut above what people give it credit for,

36:40.640 --> 36:43.640
and I think it would be more appreciated if it came out today,

36:43.640 --> 36:45.640
because we need stories like this today.

36:45.640 --> 36:48.640
Fashy abuse of Frollo, justice for the oppressed,

36:48.640 --> 36:52.640
the focus on how some men really do loathe the objects of their desire,

36:52.640 --> 36:54.640
the wholesale demonization of ethnic groups.

36:54.640 --> 37:01.640
For 20 years I have been taking care of the gypsies, one by one.

37:01.640 --> 37:06.640
Maybe this movie wasn't really appreciated in its time because it didn't resonate as much in 1996,

37:06.640 --> 37:08.640
but it does resonate more in 2017.

37:08.640 --> 37:11.640
So if you haven't seen it in a while, give it a watch.

37:11.640 --> 37:14.640
And watch it in Dolby 5.1 HD if you can.

37:14.640 --> 37:17.640
Enjoy the sweeping vistas, the revolutionary CGI,

37:17.640 --> 37:21.640
Alan Menken's best score for a Disney movie, that's right, I said it, don't at me,

37:21.640 --> 37:24.640
and consider that, hokey though it may be at points,

37:27.640 --> 37:30.640
like Hugo's message about the importance of architecture in the 1830s,
