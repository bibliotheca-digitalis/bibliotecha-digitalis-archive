0	4240	Let's take a moment to go back, all the way back to the early 1990s.
4240	9420	It was a time following the wildly successful nascent Disney renaissance and the mostly
9420	14000	lucrative career of Andrew Lloyd Webber and his high-octane melodramas.
14000	20240	So from this ecosystem rises a most unlikely musical adaptation of a literary classic.
20240	24840	I'm in a new Andrew Lloyd Webber musical based on the hunchback of Notre Dame.
24840	27640	It's called Hunch.
27640	32640	This parody in the ABC animated comedy, The Critic, came out in 1994.
32640	39640	The Hunchback of Notre Dame!
41640	42640	That's me!
42640	46640	Two years before Disney would go, let's do that but, you know, for real.
46640	51640	Out there, my ordinary man.
51640	62640	Yes, I've got a hunch this is love.
62640	66640	Enter Disney's 34th animated feature film, The Hunchback of Notre Dame.
66640	70640	A film that traumatized countless millennials with its dark storyline, a score that makes
70640	79640	church music seem sunny and cheerful by comparison,
79640	82640	and the scarring miscasting of Jason Alexander.
82640	85640	It's hopeless, absolutely hopeless.
85640	86640	You're telling me!
86640	88640	I'm losing to a bird!
88640	91640	You know, we've got to cast that obnoxious little Gargoyle character.
91640	92640	What's his name?
92640	94640	Yeah, Hugo.
94640	97640	While even at the time, Notre Dame de Paris, known in the English-speaking world by its
98640	100640	published English title, The Hunchback of Notre Dame,
100640	103640	seemed an odd choice for Disney Animation to adapt,
103640	105640	it was nothing if not a logical progression,
105640	109640	given the one thing that studio head Jeffrey Katzenberg thirsted for above all else.
109640	114640	Hollywood, that's hooey ballyhooey Hollywood.
114640	118640	In addition to that, this was also with a prescient eye toward Broadway,
118640	121640	with Disney knowing that a successful animated movie can be aged up
121640	124640	for an extremely lucrative theater audience.
124640	127640	Like producer Don Hahn in the 1996 interview with Entertainment Weekly,
127640	131640	in this case, we wanted to push Alan and Stephen to write songs that were more pop opera,
131640	133640	like Les Mis or Phantom of the Opera.
133640	138640	Beauty and the Beast wasn't the first attempt towards a darker, even adult, tone for Disney Animation,
138640	143640	but it was the first that ended up working really, really well and being really, really lucrative.
143640	146640	Then came Pocahontas, and, well, they tried.
146640	148640	You see how I do it, huh?
148640	151640	So, to expand the type of story that Disney dares to adapt,
151640	153640	Katzenberg got the creative heads behind Beauty and the Beast
153640	156640	to adapt a dark novel of great historical importance.
156640	158640	Omelos into a bird!
158640	163640	Back in 1993, Creative Affairs VP David Stanton pitched the idea to Jeffrey Katzenberg
163640	165640	because he was impressed by, quote,
165640	168640	the truly great scenes and affecting storyline, end quote,
168640	171640	he had encountered when he read the classics illustrated comic version as a kid,
171640	173640	and then later the book.
173640	176640	And basically, it seemed like a thrilling challenge for the Disney company
176640	178640	to produce a streamlined, restructured treatment of it.
178640	181640	Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, fresh off their success directing Beauty and the Beast,
181640	184640	were originally working on a treatment of the Orpheus myth
184640	186640	that was about a whale exploring the ocean,
186640	189640	but Katzenberg quashed that to get them onto Hunchback instead.
189640	192640	And during that time, while we were working on it, we got a call from Jeffrey,
192640	195640	said, guys, drop everything.
195640	197640	You're working on Hunchback now.
197640	202640	Flash forward to 96, people are already getting kind of tired of this whole Disney Renaissance thing.
202640	203640	I like you.
203640	205640	And, lo, the Hunchback of Notre Dame.
206640	209640	All right, all right, pour the wine and cut the cheese.
209640	217640	But, as with Pocahontas, the reception to Hunchback of Notre Dame was...mixed.
217640	221640	At the time, it did not receive great reviews.
221640	223640	And these criticisms were not unwarranted.
223640	226640	Hunchback of Notre Dame had tone problems.
226640	233640	Citizens of Paris, Frollo has persecuted our people, ransacked our city.
236640	242640	Be mine or you will burn.
242640	244640	I'm losing to a bird.
244640	249640	Most people's post-mortem will agree that the centrality of these grotesquely cartoonish gargoyles
249640	252640	in a dark and serious story did far more harm than good.
252640	257640	And despite mandatory toyetic elements, this was an awkward movie to push toys for.
257640	260640	There was criticism of Esmeralda on all sides.
260640	263640	Christian mom groups were more on the Frollo side of things.
263640	268640	So typical of your kind to twist the truth to cloud the mind with unholy thoughts.
268640	273640	While progressives weren't too wild, with Esmeralda being the latest in a string of women of color
273640	276640	who are way more sexualized than their white counterparts.
276640	279640	Look at that disgusting display. Yes, sir.
279640	283640	Quoth Jason Alexander in a 1996 interview with Entertainment Weekly,
283640	285640	Esmeralda is awfully provocative.
285640	288640	She's up there in the Pocahontas category for Babe of the Year.
288640	291640	She is a little more voluptuous than Pokey was.
293640	294640	Pokey?
295640	296640	Pokey?!
296640	302640	But the most common complaint about Hunchback as its fatal flaw is simply the way it changes the source material.
302640	308640	It takes this dirge on the barbarism of human nature in which nearly every named character dies
308640	312640	and turns it into this bright and hopeful inspirational tale about social justice, acceptance,
312640	314640	and the ultimate goodness of humanity.
314640	318640	This, according to some, not only misses the mark of what made Notre Dame de Paris work as a story,
318640	321640	but also completely ruins the spirit of Hugo's work
321640	324640	and completely misses the point of what Hugo's novel was about.
324640	325640	I'm losing to a bird!
325640	327640	And you at home may be wondering,
327640	332640	are you really about to explain why Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame actually secretly does
332640	335640	somehow adhere to Victor Hugo's intent?
335640	337640	Well, no. Mostly no.
337640	341640	I'm less interested in Hugo's intent as it pertains to the Disney movie
341640	347640	so much as how it has changed over the decades in various interpretations.
347640	350640	Maybe it has lost Hugo's original intent,
350640	353640	but consider that if this story is to remain relevant,
353640	358640	maybe Hugo's original intent doesn't so much matter as much as the way people reinterpret it.
358640	362640	But you're not like other gypsies. They are evil.
362640	367640	And consider also that Victor Hugo might be okay with that.
375640	379640	This is Notre Dame Cathedral.
380640	385640	Construction began in 1163 after the previous Cathedral of Paris, the 4th century Saint-Ã‰tienne,
385640	389640	was allegedly deemed too shabby for its purposes by Bishop Maurice de Sully.
389640	394640	While it was consecrated in the 1180s, construction itself didn't end until 1345.
394640	397640	Notre Dame Cathedral was an engineering marvel.
397640	401640	It is particularly notable in being one of the first uses of flying buttresses.
401640	404640	If I may draw your attention to the flying buttresses.
404640	406640	And this was not originally planned.
406640	408640	Prior to the hunchback of Notre Dame,
408640	412640	the cathedral had survived both a massive vandalization by the Huguenots in 1548
412640	415640	for being deemed an idolatrous armpit.
415640	417640	In 1793, during the French Revolution,
417640	419640	much of the building was damaged and plundered
419640	422640	during its brief conversion into a temple for the Cult of Reason,
422640	427640	a state-sponsored atheistic religion which threw a lit-ass party inside Notre Dame
427640	432640	called the Fete of Reason as a giant f*** you to both the deposed king and to the Catholic Church.
432640	434640	You know the eyes in the Disney movie?
436640	439640	Well, those guys are supposed to be the original kings of Israel,
439640	442640	but the French revolutionaries thought they were supposed to be kings of France
442640	444640	and so they had them all beheaded.
444640	445640	Yeah, that happened.
445640	450640	By the 1830s, Notre Dame was, shall we say, a little busted.
450640	453640	By Victor Hugo's time, the cathedral was over 500 years old.
453640	458640	By now destroyed by the ravages of time, changing governments, and a general lack of care,
458640	463640	young Victor Hugo begins writing Notre Dame de Paris as a point of interest and research for himself,
463640	467640	entertaining the idea that a piece of writing might draw public interest to the building.
467640	470640	So this was before the modern concept of historical preservation,
470640	473640	an idea which really only took hold in Europe,
473640	475640	and especially in the United States after World War II.
475640	478640	This was largely due to this godmotherf***er named Robert Moses,
478640	481640	who was a city planner for New York City.
481640	484640	The original Madison Square Garden, that eyesore, that's not the original.
484640	486640	That was, you know, a mistake by Robert.
489640	490640	It wasn't even 100 years old.
490640	492640	It was, like, maybe 60 years old,
492640	495640	and he just knocked it down because it was inefficient and it was in the way,
495640	497640	and he was like, no, we need to have, like, the avenue open,
497640	498640	so then he knocked it down.
502640	504640	So, out of pure intellectual curiosity,
504640	508640	and, you know, I'm not a big fan of the idea of the cathedral,
508640	510640	So, out of pure intellectual curiosity,
510640	512640	and, you know, a desire for money,
512640	515640	Victor Hugo takes it upon himself to, well...
515640	517640	Educate yourself!
517640	519640	And he falls in love with it.
519640	521640	You know, the building, that is.
521640	523640	While most of what people actually remember about the book
523640	527640	concerns the melodrama of Esmeralda, Frollo, and Quasimodo,
527640	530640	Notre Dame de Paris, the book, is actually a lengthy screed
530640	533640	about the importance of architecture and the way it shapes the lives,
533640	535640	ideas, and culture of those who occupy its spaces.
535640	539640	That, before the printing press and the subsequent rise of literacy came along,
539640	543640	architecture was the dominant way to communicate and dogmatize big ideas
543640	545640	on a wide scale.
545640	548640	That all of the characters in Notre Dame de Paris are stupid,
548640	550640	or victims, or inept, or cruel,
550640	552640	ultimately, that doesn't matter,
552640	555640	because the building outlives and outlasts
555640	557640	any of these individual humans' flaws,
557640	560640	and ultimately weathers all of humanity's flaws,
560640	563640	and is still a much bigger shaper of French cultural identity
563640	565640	than any of these individual people.
565640	568640	So Victor Hugo wants to write a story to spark the public's imagination
568640	572640	and make them fall in love with this piece of history and architecture like he did.
572640	575640	At the time, Hugo was already a successful playwright and essayist,
575640	579640	but with the rise in popularity of this new, exciting form of writing called
579640	582640	the novel, that would earn Hugo international fame.
582640	586640	So in 1828, Hugo signs a contract with publisher Gosselin
586640	588640	to write this book about Notre Dame de Paris
588640	592640	for a really pretty sizable, for that time, advance of 4,000 francs,
592640	596640	with the promise that it would be done in April of 1829.
596640	598640	But like most writers, zing,
598640	600640	Hugo quickly burns through the advance
600640	602640	and puts off writing the book longer and longer
602640	605640	so he can stay in his comfort zone of writing plays.
605640	609640	So time passes, he hasn't really done any work on this book,
609640	612640	but then he goes ahead and starts trying to sell the stage rights
612640	614640	to a completely different publisher,
614640	617640	but then his original publisher that gave him this giant advance
617640	621640	finds out about this and is rightfully really pissed.
621640	623640	So after some negotiating,
623640	625640	Hugo successfully convinces the publisher
625640	629640	to push the publication deadline back to December 30th of 1830.
629640	631640	But then the July Revolution happens because it's France,
631640	635640	and early 19th century France was averaging about one revolution per month,
635640	640640	and Hugo ultimately finishes the novel on January 14th of 1831.
640640	644640	While there were socialist undertones in later adaptations of Notre Dame de Paris,
644640	646640	and even in Hugo's later works,
646640	650640	it's safe to say, you know, he was a businessman,
650640	652640	and if he and Walt Disney had been contemporaries,
652640	657640	they probably would have at least shared a good, firm, respectful handshake.
657640	660640	And if a Burger King commercial where a nine-year-old girl
660640	663640	happily plays with a puppet of Quasimodo seems gauche,
663640	665640	It was Quasimodo!
665640	668640	everything points to this author having dollar signs in his eyes,
668640	671640	or frank signs, before the book was even finished.
671640	673640	If Burger King had existed in 1830s France,
673640	677640	I'm sure all the kids would be wanting a Quasimodo textile mill finger protector.
677640	680640	And then, I got carried away just like Quasimodo.
680640	682640	I'm losing to a bird!
682640	684640	But here's the most important thing for Hugo.
684640	686640	It worked.
692640	697640	Did you just hide a stack of cocaine there?
697640	699640	Through writing this novel and his activism,
699640	701640	Hugo saved Notre Dame.
701640	705640	He woke people up to this historical and architectural marvel sitting in their midst.
705640	708640	And that new consciousness led to an extensive renovation in 1845,
708640	710640	led by V. Le Duc,
710640	713640	including the addition of this spire that Quasimodo sings on,
713640	716640	which was definitely not there in the 14th century.
716640	721640	And that is why Notre Dame Cathedral is the fancy tourist attraction we know and love today.
721640	725640	But the veneration of this building was not the main reason why the book got so big.
725640	729640	So, before we cast dispersions on Disney for changing things,
729640	731640	first we must ask,
731640	735640	what is The Hunchback of Notre Dame about?
740640	744640	While I think it's fair to assume that most modern audiences associate this story
744640	747640	with themes of social justice and progressive societal change,
747640	751640	this is more a product of pop culture adaptations than of the book itself.
751640	752640	More on that later.
752640	755640	The novel concerns itself very little with the plight of marginalized groups,
755640	759640	and has a much darker, more cynical take on society and humanity at large.
759640	763640	Quasimodo is a curmudgeonly lapdog who does Frollo's dirty work for him,
763640	765640	and he's also deaf from those bells,
765640	769640	and does not have the angelic voice of human flower crown Tom Hulse.
769640	772640	Knowing them is they will never know me.
772640	775640	Claude Frollo is a straight-up attempted rapist.
775640	778640	Phoebus resembles Gaston more than any other Disney character.
778640	782640	He's just down to nut, but at the end of the day, Phoebus is only here for Phoebus.
782640	786640	Esmeralda is your basic romantic representation of a Madonna horror trope
786640	790640	sprinkled with some genuinely harmful racism that gets buried in later adaptations.
790640	793640	You find out at the end that Esmeralda isn't really Romani.
793640	796640	She's actually a white girl who was stolen as a baby.
796640	798640	Yeah.
798640	800640	Yeah, they cut that out in the Disney movie.
800640	802640	Yes, good. Thank you, Disney.
802640	805640	Stay away, child. They're gypsies.
805640	807640	Esmeralda is reunited with her birth mother,
807640	811640	who is also a wayfish, tragic, driven mad by having lost her baby,
811640	814640	right before both characters die horribly.
814640	817640	In fact, everybody dies horribly, except for Phoebus,
817640	820640	and a not-so-subtle stand-in character for Victor Hugo,
820640	822640	Pierre Gringoire, who was cut from the Disney movie.
822640	824640	He is a poet, and at the end of the novel,
824640	827640	when given the choice to save the life of either Esmeralda or the goat,
827640	830640	but not both, he saves the goat.
830640	835640	Yeah, the goat lives. And yes, the goat was created by Victor Hugo, not Disney.
835640	838640	The main plot that takes up most adaptations that we know
838640	841640	is the background noise to Hugo's main point,
841640	843640	which can be summed up with the following excerpt.
843640	845640	Our readers must excuse us if we stop a moment
845640	848640	to investigate the enigmatic words of the archdeacon.
848640	851640	This will kill that. The book will kill the edifice.
851640	854640	Victor Hugo's book was mainly concerned with how the printed press,
854640	856640	and subsequently, mass literacy,
856640	861640	would kill what he perceived as the original common language, architecture.
861640	864640	So the themes we, the modern audience, have come to associate
864640	866640	with The Hunchback of Notre Dame,
866640	868640	whether everyone lives at the end or not,
868640	872640	these were not themes that were necessarily present in the original novel.
872640	875640	The original novel was not terribly concerned
875640	877640	with the plight of the marginalized or the abused.
877640	881640	Victor Hugo was so unconcerned with the main melodrama, we know,
881640	883640	that when the original English-language translator,
883640	886640	Frederic Chaubert, switched the title from Notre Dame de Paris
886640	888640	to The Hunchback of Notre Dame,
888640	890640	essentially because it sounded, I don't know,
890640	892640	more tantalizing to English-speaking audiences,
892640	895640	Hugo was notoriously pissed off.
895640	898640	So there's an interesting irony in a book that says,
898640	901640	this will kill that, the book will kill the edifice.
901640	905640	Its original meaning and intent will get killed off by...
905640	908640	Visual Mass Media!
914640	917640	One does not go from a dark and violent story
917640	919640	about fate and death of the church to...
919640	921640	Omelos into a bird!
921640	922640	...so easily.
922640	924640	Let's look at a few examples.
924640	927640	La Esmeralda was an opera written in 1836,
927640	930640	and if you're wondering why this production that I pulled
930640	933640	looks like a production of Rent with priests in it,
933640	935640	I kind of wonder that too.
935640	937640	This opera failed in a big way,
937640	941640	so it doesn't get like 600 productions a year like La BohÃ¨me does.
941640	944640	La Esmeralda has a much less dour ending than the book.
944640	946640	Censors demanded that every reference to Claude Frollo
946640	948640	being a priest be removed, and lo,
948640	951640	the framework of modern adaptation begins.
951640	954640	Quasimodo in this version was shunted to minor character status,
954640	958640	and while Phoebus ends up dying a noble death because of love,
958640	960640	La Esmeralda survives.
960640	962640	And this stage adaptation was written by...
962640	964640	Victor Hugo?
964640	965640	Yeah.
965640	967640	Even though this version is largely forgotten by history,
967640	970640	it is relevant because we already see the author actively engaged
970640	973640	in rewriting his own book for a mass visual consumption
973640	977640	and boulderizing its own message to make it palatable for a larger audience.
977640	980640	I've got a hunch this bites.
980640	983640	La Esmeralda was followed by multiple adaptations over the following decades,
983640	986640	and the material was retrofitted again with the rise of film,
986640	989640	including one version directed by Alice Guy-Blanche in 1905.
989640	991640	But for the purposes of this video,
991640	996640	let's skip ahead in time to the 1923 Hollywood movie starring Lon Chaney,
996640	999640	the first adaptation that was a massive success.
999640	1003640	Not only did this film bring Hunchback back to the popular consciousness in a big way,
1003640	1007640	it also positioned Quasimodo as one of the original universal movie monsters.
1007640	1010640	Lon Chaney wanted to be Quasimodo to the point where he was actually looking
1010640	1014640	to form his own production company for the sole purpose of getting this movie made.
1014640	1017640	Producer Irving Thalberg had been wanting to make a big production
1017640	1020640	that was more epic and adult than the usual universal fare,
1020640	1024640	and pitched it to studio head Carl Laemmle as a love story,
1024640	1030640	and thus the Hunchback of Notre Dame tragic love story entered the public consciousness.
1030640	1032640	The film banked a record $3 million,
1032640	1035640	and got the ball rolling in this conga line of film versions,
1035640	1038640	and why you will eventually have to sit through the Dark Universe version
1038640	1041640	of Hunchback starring Ansel Elgort in 2021.
1042640	1044640	I hope. Please God, let it happen. I want it.
1044640	1049640	Frollo is still not a priest, although his brother Jehan, a minor character in the book, is.
1049640	1051640	And Phoebus is good now.
1051640	1054640	Quasimodo dies at the end so the breeding pair can go forth unfettered,
1054640	1057640	because he is an uggo and, well, really,
1057640	1061640	this is about as nice of a monster as you were going to get out of a 1923 movie.
1061640	1066640	But all in all, despite this being one of the last big versions with the Esmeralda racism reveal,
1066640	1069640	it's still fairly conventional 1920s fluff.
1069640	1074640	But already in 1923, we have lost any real connection to Victor Hugo's message
1074640	1076640	about the novel destroying the edifice.
1076640	1080640	Because visual mass media has destroyed the novel.
1089640	1094640	No, no, no. Don't spoil the fun, Frollo. Stay here.
1094640	1100640	In 1939, Hollywood producer Pandro S. Berman demanded an exact remake of the Lon Chaney film,
1100640	1104640	reusing a majority of the sets from the 1923 version.
1104640	1108640	William Dieterle, already a successful director in his own right before fleeing Nazi Germany,
1108640	1110640	delivered on this for Berman.
1110640	1114640	Charles Lawton starred, delivering a truly memorable performance as Quasimodo.
1114640	1119640	Why was I not made of stone like thee?
1120640	1125640	And at Lawton's own behest, they brought in relative newcomer Maureen O'Hara to star as Esmeralda,
1125640	1128640	who in this version is not a stolen white baby, but actually Romani.
1128640	1134640	So... I'm not sure where this falls in the whitewashing conversation, but there you go.
1134640	1135640	She's a gypsy, sir.
1135640	1138640	Who cares about her race? She's pretty.
1138640	1142640	And it is this version more than any other, including the original novel,
1142640	1144640	that Disney borrows from the most.
1144640	1150640	There is also a very sharp humanist lean into the concept of justice in regard to people versus buildings in history.
1150640	1155640	Esmeralda in this version isn't just some innocent hottie who wanders into misfortune by pure bad luck.
1155640	1160640	She literally breaks into the city of Paris, where the Romani have been actively banned from,
1160640	1163640	to plead with the king of France to let her people live freely.
1163640	1165640	They tell me gypsies are a lot of thieves.
1165640	1167640	That's not true, your majesty.
1167640	1170640	Whenever we steal, it's because we're hungry.
1171640	1174640	My people have good hearts, and we love you.
1175640	1180640	You have a good heart too, sir, because you've promised to help us.
1181640	1186640	It is also one of the rare versions where the Romani are not demonized in some way, shape, or form.
1186640	1188640	Still looking at you, Disney.
1188640	1190640	The lame can walk.
1190640	1192640	And the blind can see.
1192640	1194640	But the dead don't talk.
1194640	1197640	Their plight is just that, a plight.
1197640	1198640	Why do you stop us?
1198640	1201640	Because no gypsies can enter Paris any longer without a permit.
1201640	1202640	It's the new law.
1202640	1204640	If the others cannot too, why can't we?
1204640	1206640	They are Frenchmen. You're gypsies. Foreigners.
1208640	1210640	You came yesterday, we come today.
1210640	1215640	The movie is constantly reminding us that the lives of innocent, persecuted people are at stake.
1215640	1219640	The Esmeralda, Quasimodo, Frollo melodrama that everyone loves is still in there, sure,
1219640	1222640	but there is an active undercurrent in this movie that ties in with bigger struggles
1222640	1225640	that isn't just an old building that has weathered time.
1225640	1229640	The Hunchback of Notre Dame was the only film that was screened in Cannes that year,
1229640	1234640	a film festival which was itself created in opposition to the fascist presence at the Venice Film Festival.
1234640	1237640	So that a movie that features the Romani as a persecuted underclass
1237640	1241640	while Hitler was gearing up to slaughter hundreds of thousands of them
1241640	1244640	at a festival that was created to oppose Nazism,
1244640	1246640	there's something incredibly powerful in that.
1246640	1250640	Something that has nothing to do with Hugo's original intent.
1250640	1253640	So with the success of this movie, and it was a huge success,
1253640	1257640	we gain the justice for the oppressed theme which plays very heavily into the Disney version.
1257640	1261640	So in a lot of ways, this adaptation is certainly the most cohesive,
1261640	1265640	and it is telling that many future adaptations try to mimic the anti-fascist theming,
1265640	1266640	Justice!
1266640	1269640	while at the same time not always grasping it.
1269640	1272640	We find you totally innocent.
1272640	1275640	Which is the worst crime of all.
1275640	1277640	So you're going to pay!
1278640	1284640	So, it's 1992, and Disney is plotting out its five-year plan for the conquest of Earth
1284640	1289640	after the staggering success of Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and The Little Mermaid.
1289640	1295640	If Disney wants to adapt Notre Dame de Paris, which version do they really want to adapt?
1295640	1299640	Right off the bat, it's fallacious to look at Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame
1299640	1301640	as an adaptation of the original novel,
1301640	1306640	because that read ignores a whole century and a half of filmmakers recontextualizing the story for each new generation.
1306640	1310640	Again, the idea for the Disney movie didn't come from the original novel,
1310640	1312640	but from a picture book adaptation of it.
1312640	1317640	And even if the original Notre Dame de Paris was as close to perfection as the early novel could get,
1317640	1319640	film is just a different medium.
1319640	1322640	It's a common fallacy that adaptational changes happen
1322640	1326640	because greedy filmmakers want to bastardize and water down a beloved creation
1326640	1328640	to get as many butts in seats as possible.
1328640	1330640	Why, I'm the Captain the Hat!
1330640	1332640	And well, that is sometimes true,
1332640	1337640	but just as often it's changing the story to fit a visually temporally locked medium.
1337640	1340640	Yes, sometimes adaptations are cheap cash-ins,
1340640	1344640	but it is just inaccurate to assume that all Hollywood adaptations are
1344640	1348640	when there are often teams of artists that care deeply about making the best product possible,
1348640	1351640	which usually means changing some stuff.
1351640	1355640	But more to the point, aside from the fact that the Disney movie changes the ending in a big way,
1355640	1357640	and that's the aspect that people tend to focus on,
1357640	1359640	what did it really change?
1359640	1363640	Rather, the real question is, what versions did Disney pull from?
1363640	1367640	Because the real originality is in the aesthetics, the music, the visuals,
1367640	1368640	not so much the story.
1368640	1372640	That Frollo is no longer a priest comes from Hugo himself in La Esmeralda.
1372640	1375640	Same with Phoebus being a good guy and not everybody dying.
1375640	1377640	And that theme of justice for the oppressed,
1377640	1381640	well, we can thank Charles Laughton and a German filmmaker fleeing the Nazis for that.
1381640	1386640	The God Help the Outcast musical number pulls heavily from this scene in the 1939 version.
1386640	1390640	Give me a rich husband. Give me many admirers. Give me beauty.
1390640	1393640	Give me a rich highness. Give me peace of mind.
1393640	1397640	Give me happiness. Take all I have. But please help my people.
1397640	1404640	I ask for nothing. I can get by.
1404640	1411640	Please help my people, the poor and downtrod.
1411640	1414640	Or this scene of Phoebus rallying the citizens of Paris.
1414640	1417640	Citizens of Paris.
1417640	1420640	Parisians! Parisians!
1420640	1424640	That also borrows from Gringoire doing similar in the 1939 movie.
1424640	1427640	But let's take a look at what the themes of the Disney movie even are.
1427640	1429640	I think Esmeralda put it best.
1429640	1430640	Justice!
1430640	1432640	First, there is the theme of oppression and injustice.
1432640	1440640	Judge Claude Frollo longed to purge the world of vice and sin.
1440640	1444640	Interrupt judge Claude Frollo begins the film by way of unjust oppression.
1444640	1452640	And for one time in his life of power and control,
1452640	1459640	Frollo felt a twinge of fear for his immortal soul.
1459640	1460640	What must I do?
1460640	1462640	Then there's the theme of humility before God,
1462640	1465640	and that Notre Dame itself acts as a sort of embodiment of God.
1465640	1470640	You never can run from nor hide what you've done from the eyes.
1470640	1477640	The very eyes of Notre Dame.
1477640	1482640	By basically embodying injustice, Frollo positions himself as an enemy of God.
1482640	1486640	But that Quasimodo embodies justice positions him as almost angelic.
1486640	1489640	Observe the contradiction between heaven's light...
1489640	1497640	I swear it must be heaven's light.
1497640	1498640	And hellfire.
1498640	1503640	Like fire, hellfire.
1503640	1506640	But the unique thematic element in the Disney movie is this.
1506640	1511640	Who is the monster and who is the man?
1511640	1514640	This idea is present to some extent in all of the versions,
1514640	1520640	but the Disney version is the first to put this theme of internal versus external monsterhood front and center.
1520640	1521640	You are deformed.
1521640	1522640	I am deformed.
1522640	1523640	And you are ugly.
1523640	1524640	And I am ugly.
1524640	1529640	Quasimodo, and indeed everyone but Esmeralda, take it for granted that he is a monster, you know.
1529640	1531640	I am a monster, you know.
1531640	1533640	Because of the way that he looks.
1533640	1535640	But it is Frollo who is the monster.
1535640	1538640	The most monstrous character Disney has ever created.
1538640	1540640	It's not my fault.
1540640	1542640	I'm not to blame.
1542640	1546640	Because he is much more grounded and real than any other Disney villain.
1546640	1551640	This, aside from the general quality of the writing, is what makes hellfire so brilliant.
1551640	1553640	Protect me, Maria.
1553640	1556640	Don't let the siren cast her spell.
1556640	1561640	Don't let her fire sear my flesh and bone.
1561640	1565640	Unlike other Disney villain songs where they're just singing about how being evil is fun...
1565640	1571640	An even grimmer plot has been simmering in my great criminal brain.
1571640	1575640	Hellfire is about the anguish it causes him to be the way that he is.
1575640	1577640	It's not my fault.
1577640	1585640	If in God's plan, he made the devil so much stronger than a man.
1585640	1588640	Said Kirk Wise in a 1996 Chicago Tribune article,
1588640	1590640	As we were exploring the characters, especially Frollo,
1590640	1594640	we certainly found a lot of historical parallels to the type of mania he had.
1594640	1597640	The Confederate South, Nazi Germany, take your pick.
1597640	1601640	And it is in their interactions with Esmeralda that their relative monsterhood is revealed.
1601640	1603640	I am a monster, you know.
1603640	1607640	So, yeah, hold on, I am about to defend this creative decision, bear with me.
1607640	1614640	I remember even back in 1996 hearing the argument where if differently abled kids should see themselves just as valuable as everyone else,
1614640	1617640	then why doesn't Quasimodo get the girl at the end?
1617640	1621640	To which I would respond, A, getting the girl as a reward should never be the goal.
1621640	1629640	And let her taste the fires of hell, or else let her be mine and mine alone.
1629640	1632640	And B, it's what sets Quasimodo apart from Frollo.
1632640	1635640	He accepts and values Esmeralda's friendship,
1635640	1641640	but he's also able to let her go so she can be with the guy who was basically an accessory to genocide up until about five minutes ago.
1641640	1643640	He's fine with it.
1643640	1644640	He's fine.
1644640	1645640	Really.
1645640	1646640	He's fine.
1646640	1647640	See?
1647640	1648640	He's fine.
1648640	1649640	He's fine.
1649640	1650640	It's fine.
1650640	1651640	It's fine.
1651640	1653640	This is fine.
1653640	1655640	It's fine.
1655640	1661640	See again that contrast between heaven's light and hell fire, both of which revolve around Esmeralda.
1661640	1666640	Esmeralda gives Quasimodo positive attention, and that's the first time he's ever experienced that.
1666640	1668640	Do you think I'm evil?
1668640	1669640	No.
1669640	1672640	No, no, you were kind and good and...
1672640	1673640	And a gypsy.
1673640	1676640	And maybe Frollo's wrong about the both of us.
1676640	1679640	And his hope is that she might one day love him.
1679640	1684640	I dare to dream that she might even care for me.
1684640	1689640	But Frollo's position is, if I can't have her, literally possess her, no one can.
1689640	1700640	Destroy Esmeralda and let her taste the fires of hell, or else let her be mine and mine alone.
1700640	1703640	So this is the binary between a monster and a man.
1703640	1706640	Quasimodo respects Esmeralda's autonomy and he lets her go.
1706640	1708640	Frollo would rather die.
1708640	1710640	So, this is fine.
1710640	1712640	He's fine.
1712640	1713640	It's fine.
1713640	1715640	He's fine.
1715640	1716640	This is fine.
1716640	1718640	It's fine.
1718640	1719640	He's fine.
1719640	1721640	This is fine.
1721640	1722640	It's fine.
1722640	1725640	Don't worry, they give him a hot, clumsy girlfriend in the sequel.
1725640	1728640	Was it just a lucky day?
1728640	1732640	That he turned and looked my way?
1732640	1736640	And on that same token, that's part of why Quasimodo needs to not die at the end of this version.
1736640	1741640	Losing his love, either to someone else or to death by hanging, doesn't kill him.
1741640	1744640	Part of Quasimodo's goodness stems from him being stronger than that.
1744640	1749640	And rather than getting a sexy lamp as a reward, he finds happiness in being accepted by the people,
1749640	1757640	which is maybe a touch unrealistic, but certainly a better message than either dying or getting a sexy lamp as a reward.
1757640	1761640	And to be clear, Esmeralda in this version is super proactive and not a sexy lamp.
1761640	1765640	And Quasimodo, unlike Frollo, does not see women as possessions.
1765640	1771640	But there's a lot going on here that kind of gets buried under the criticism that they changed the ending and therefore softened it.
1771640	1778640	Even with the damned gargoyles in the picture, the overall dark tone kind of worked against the movie's favorability ratings.
1778640	1782640	Even at the time, a huge part of the confused reaction was the distance between the marketing...
1782640	1785640	I think the cavalry's here!
1785640	1788640	This coming summer, experience the adventure.
1788640	1789640	Sit.
1789640	1792640	Mom and dad had a special surprise waiting for me.
1792640	1794640	It was Quasimodo!
1794640	1796640	You are deformed.
1796640	1797640	I am deformed.
1797640	1798640	And you are ugly.
1798640	1799640	And I am ugly.
1799640	1802640	And these are crimes for which the world shows little pity.
1802640	1805640	Partly because people thought it was too serious and too dark.
1807640	1809640	Now your kids can get all four puppets.
1809640	1811640	Take them from her.
1816640	1819640	This is an unholy demon. I'm sending it back to hell.
1820640	1828640	The marketing department at that time thought, well, we'll maybe fool people into thinking that it's a lighthearted, happy Disney.
1828640	1831640	And then I got carried away just like Quasimodo.
1836640	1839640	They'll play up the gargoyles and they'll play up the feast of fools.
1839640	1844640	And so all the marketing at that time was, it's a celebration. It's a festival.
1844640	1848640	It took nearly 20 years before we saw that coveted stage musical,
1848640	1854640	and with it attempts to address some of the criticism about the weird tonal dissonance in the Disney movie by sticking closer to the original novel.
1854640	1858640	It ran in Germany for several years before premiering with a revised book in America,
1858640	1862640	with performances in San Diego and at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey.
1862640	1865640	It never made it to Broadway and probably never will for...
1865640	1868640	union reasons.
1868640	1870640	I'll just leave it at that.
1870640	1871640	Union stuff.
1871640	1876640	The American production goes even darker, sticking much closer to the Everybody Dies ending,
1876640	1882640	but I'd argue it ends up being less enjoyable than the movie because it runs into the same tone problem, but now in the opposite direction.
1882640	1887640	It builds on the same foundation as the movie, but then it has a different payoff that isn't really built to.
1887640	1889640	It's different, not better.
1889640	1895640	It was less successful, however, than the most financially lucrative non-English language musical in history,
1895640	1898640	Notre Dame de Paris, the French Quebecois musical,
1898640	1902640	which, while one of the more accurate adaptations of Hunchback...
1921640	1927640	Well, if your cheese is three men wailing melodramatically over a hot lady to a Chris Isaac song by way of spa music,
1927640	1930640	then Notre Dame de Paris is for you.
1930640	1934640	There's always a desire to tell and retell popular stories.
1934640	1936640	This is how we share and create culture.
1936640	1940640	In some ways, this is the reason why culture even exists.
1940640	1945640	So it's important to understand not just that stories sometimes change, but why.
1945640	1952640	The changes to Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame weren't just rooted in the fact that it's Disney and we can't just kill everybody.
1952640	1955640	And yet it's a lot lighter than the novel.
1955640	1958640	Oh, absolutely. In the novel, everybody dies.
1958640	1960640	Although that is certainly a part of it.
1960640	1963640	Changes to narratives over time are inevitable.
1963640	1969640	And in the case of Notre Dame de Paris, it's because sometimes problems actually do get addressed.
1969640	1974640	Historical preservation wasn't really a thing in the 1830s, especially in France.
1974640	1978640	But now it's hard to imagine a France where historical preservation isn't a huge priority.
1978640	1981640	And a lot of that is thanks to Victor Hugo.
1981640	1987640	Several years before publishing Notre Dame de Paris, Hugo wrote an essay called War on the Demolishers, in which he stated,
1987640	1990640	The hammer that is mutilating the face of the country must be stopped.
1990640	1993640	One law would suffice. Let us pass it.
1993640	1998640	Whatever the property rights may be, we must not allow the destruction of a historical and monumental edifice
1998640	2002640	by these ignoble speculators whose honor has been blinded by self-interest.
2002640	2006640	We would want to reconstruct these prodigious edifices, but we would not be able to.
2006640	2009640	We no longer possess the genius of centuries past.
2009640	2011640	Industry has replaced art.
2011640	2015640	We can't step into the reality where Hugo never existed, so we will never know.
2015640	2021640	But it is fair to say that if not for the hunchback of Notre Dame, Notre Dame Cathedral might not even be there today.
2021640	2024640	Or at least, it would still be pretty busted.
2024640	2029640	But we live in a world now, in Europe anyway, where Hugo's primary concern was solved.
2029640	2033640	So if this story is going to stick around, it needs a new concern.
2033640	2035640	A more humanist one.
2035640	2040640	Hugo's writing changed priorities as the priorities of the time he was living in changed.
2040640	2044640	And I think that shift in perspective is no better illustrated than in Hugo's other great work, Les Miserables,
2044640	2048640	which takes a wildly different attitude on the value of human life.
2048640	2053640	Les Mis's theme is that individual lives, though crushed by an unjust system, do matter,
2053640	2055640	and the choices of individuals do affect history.
2055640	2059640	Just look at the kindly bishop who didn't turn in Jean Valjean at the beginning of the novel,
2059640	2063640	and gave him a second chance, and how Jean Valjean uses that second chance to better the lives of others.
2063640	2067640	This is a primary theme of Les Mis, human goodness overcoming unjust systems.
2067640	2072640	So Notre Dame de Paris gets this sort of makeover where it's sort of making the same point as Les Mis,
2072640	2074640	justice for the oppressed.
2074640	2078640	True monstrousness is not a reflection of how society sees you, or what you look like.
2078640	2082640	And inhumanly strong protagonists. Hugo was a big fan of those.
2082640	2087640	If you want to decry the Disney movie for the changes they made to make it kid-friendly, well, that's fine.
2087640	2091640	But if one calls out the happy ending because it blunts the original misanthropic tone of the novel,
2091640	2097640	but doesn't call out the anti-inequality or social justice aspects, well, it's not only missing the forest for the trees,
2097640	2101640	but it's also a rather shallow reading and omits basically all of the context in history.
2101640	2105640	And yeah, part of that is just Disney being Disney, but part of that is what we need now.
2105640	2110640	Like Hugo making a point about the historical importance of the building was what we needed in the 1830s.
2110640	2115640	Quasimodo has gone from pitiable wretch and tool of the system to a movie monster,
2115640	2119640	and then back to pitiable wretch but nicer this time, and then all the way to hero of his own story.
2120640	2126640	It's also noteworthy how really the Disney version is the only version that explores how abusive and weird Quasimodo's relationship with Frollo is,
2126640	2128640	and has him overcoming it.
2128640	2131640	All my life you have told me that the world is a dark, cruel place,
2131640	2135640	but now I see that the only thing dark and cruel about it is people like you.
2139640	2143640	And it really is remarkable that Disney had a protagonist with a legit physical deformity.
2143640	2146640	And I don't mean, like, beastly deformity.
2146640	2150640	I can't think of another kids movie that does that except, well, arguably Shrek,
2150640	2154640	and Shrek, well, Shrek looks like 90% of stand-up comedians.
2154640	2157640	This movie was the first that went into production after Aladdin was a huge success,
2157640	2161640	and it shows with these forced comedy elements that have only aged more poorly over time.
2161640	2164640	Fly, my pretty, fly, fly!
2168640	2171640	And improvising Robin Williams is not the same as Jason Alexander.
2171640	2174640	All right, all right! Pour the wine and cut the cheese!
2174640	2176640	Disservice though it may have been to this movie,
2176640	2180640	Disney did eventually relearn that not all sidekicks have to be voiced by comedians.
2180640	2181640	Eventually.
2183640	2187640	But in a lot of ways, Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame was ahead of its time.
2187640	2188640	It's still a hot mess.
2193640	2196640	Easy as it is to say, it's great, except for the gargoyles.
2196640	2198640	The gargoyles are still there.
2198640	2200640	Yet it's still a cut above what people give it credit for,
2200640	2203640	and I think it would be more appreciated if it came out today,
2203640	2205640	because we need stories like this today.
2205640	2208640	Fashy abuse of Frollo, justice for the oppressed,
2208640	2212640	the focus on how some men really do loathe the objects of their desire,
2212640	2214640	the wholesale demonization of ethnic groups.
2214640	2221640	For 20 years I have been taking care of the gypsies, one by one.
2221640	2226640	Maybe this movie wasn't really appreciated in its time because it didn't resonate as much in 1996,
2226640	2228640	but it does resonate more in 2017.
2228640	2231640	So if you haven't seen it in a while, give it a watch.
2231640	2234640	And watch it in Dolby 5.1 HD if you can.
2234640	2237640	Enjoy the sweeping vistas, the revolutionary CGI,
2237640	2241640	Alan Menken's best score for a Disney movie, that's right, I said it, don't at me,
2241640	2244640	and consider that, hokey though it may be at points,
2247640	2250640	like Hugo's message about the importance of architecture in the 1830s,
2250640	2252640	this might be what we need in our time.
2254640	2255640	Most of it.
2261640	2262640	Most of it.
