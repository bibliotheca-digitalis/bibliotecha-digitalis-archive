00:00.000 --> 00:09.400
Eric, why did you send her away? You desired her and she was yours to use exactly as you

00:09.400 --> 00:14.520
pleased. Why risk offending the Shah for the sake of a girl who was only a slave? He gave

00:14.520 --> 00:18.680
a great cry of rage, lifted the table in front of him, and threw it across the room with

00:18.680 --> 00:22.240
a force that splintered the legs asunder from the marble top.

00:22.240 --> 00:25.880
Only a slave! Only an animal!

00:25.880 --> 00:26.880
He roared.

00:26.880 --> 00:35.020
You asinine Persian dolt! Get out of my way! Quickly! Before I forget all that I owe you!

00:35.020 --> 00:38.080
Is this another of your quaint and delightful customs?

00:38.080 --> 00:39.640
He demanded furiously.

00:39.640 --> 00:43.840
Has no one in this godforsaken court heard of a decent period of mourning?

00:43.840 --> 00:45.740
I raised my shoulders helplessly.

00:45.740 --> 00:50.760
The Shah's sister is his personal property to be disposed of as he sees fit. Eric looked

00:50.760 --> 00:51.760
at me incredulously.

00:52.280 --> 00:58.960
Are you telling me the girl is transferrable? Like the Grand Vizier's signet ring that

00:58.960 --> 01:01.280
whoever takes one must take the other?

01:01.280 --> 01:04.200
I sighed. It is often the custom in such matters.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.960
Oh, I see.

01:05.960 --> 01:07.440
He said contemptuously.

01:07.440 --> 01:11.600
Legalized rape is the done thing here, is it? Any man may force himself upon a woman

01:11.600 --> 01:15.500
and say it is the custom. My god, what a country!

01:15.500 --> 01:20.280
And he turned away with such fierce disgust that I felt faintly ashamed of my own race.

01:20.280 --> 01:25.440
She is poor and has children to feed. I am able to pay the price, she asks, without hardship.

01:25.440 --> 01:28.880
Why should I stand here and haggle with her like a miser?

01:28.880 --> 01:33.680
She expects it, Eric. I tell you, it is the custom.

01:33.680 --> 01:37.280
Fuck. Your. Customs.

01:45.280 --> 01:48.680
There is something intrinsic in human nature that when someone says,

01:48.880 --> 01:54.240
This thing belongs to us, not you, and no, you can't have it, the excluded group loses

01:54.240 --> 02:00.200
their shit, whether they actually would have wanted the thing or not. Like, I didn't want

02:00.200 --> 02:04.720
to go to Shelley's birthday party. I don't even like Shelley, but I find out that I'm

02:04.720 --> 02:05.720
not invited.

02:05.720 --> 02:08.680
Oh. That bitch.

02:08.680 --> 02:13.440
This attitude dominates discussions of cultural appropriation in particular, where one group

02:13.440 --> 02:17.920
says, no, this thing belongs to us and actually has deep cultural and religious significance

02:17.920 --> 02:23.200
that you clearly do not understand, nor do you care to, so maybe don't wear a featherhead

02:23.200 --> 02:27.540
dress as part of your lingerie line. Like, maybe the excluded group has zero interest

02:27.540 --> 02:31.540
in wearing a featherhead dress with a lingerie line, but they're kind of offended at the

02:31.540 --> 02:34.160
idea that someone said you can't.

02:34.160 --> 02:39.880
Why can't I do sexy featherhead dress? I didn't steal your land or violate countless treaties

02:39.880 --> 02:45.120
or give you diseases to which you had no natural immunity. I personally was not there. And

02:45.120 --> 02:49.120
no, I wasn't going to wear a sexy feather headdress, but I should be able to without

02:49.120 --> 02:52.400
being called problematic.

02:52.400 --> 02:56.600
But this attitude is nothing new. Let us go back to the mid-19th century, when travel

02:56.600 --> 03:02.800
writing was all the rage and there was particular interest in the Orient. And I don't mean that

03:02.800 --> 03:07.400
Orient, although that was certainly also a thing, but in this case, Egypt, the Ottoman

03:07.400 --> 03:09.800
Empire, and Persia.

03:09.800 --> 03:13.440
It is from male European travelers to the Ottoman Empire that Europe was introduced

03:13.440 --> 03:19.600
to the idea of the harem, but only the idea, because men weren't allowed into harems.

03:19.600 --> 03:23.640
See? That's kind of the whole point. Only women and male relatives are allowed into

03:23.640 --> 03:26.240
harems. Them's the rules.

03:26.240 --> 03:31.020
And of course, our 19th century Eurotrash did not like that. Why won't you let me into

03:31.020 --> 03:36.280
your club filled with slave ladies wearing those sexy belly dancer outfits and those

03:36.280 --> 03:42.760
finger symbol thingies and those badass eunuchs with their sabres? Why can I not have the

03:42.760 --> 03:43.760
ring?

03:43.760 --> 03:47.960
And with this desire to be included in a space in which they were not allowed, their presumptions

03:47.960 --> 03:52.320
about the culture they were visiting combined with this forbidden space made their imaginations

03:52.320 --> 03:53.600
run wild.

03:53.600 --> 03:59.240
If we aren't allowed in there, it must be because it's sexy. Licentious. It must be

03:59.240 --> 04:05.320
full of these sexy slave babes who don't really want it, but also kinda want it.

04:05.320 --> 04:09.840
These are some early mainstream European examples of what Columbia University professor of literature

04:09.840 --> 04:16.280
Edward Said defined as Orientalism in his 1978 book, Orientalism.

04:16.280 --> 04:20.760
European depictions of the Middle East date as far back as the medieval period. The Crusades.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.920
A thing that happened.

04:21.920 --> 04:26.320
But the rise of what we'll call Orientalist media really begins in the 18th century, as

04:26.320 --> 04:31.580
major European world powers go into war with the Ottoman Empire. Operas like Mozart's Abduction

04:31.580 --> 04:37.300
from the Seraglio, travelogues like Lady Elizabeth Craven's A Journey Through Crimea to Constantinople,

04:37.300 --> 04:42.660
and Lord Byron's poetry-slash-personal antics were all popular proliferators of this concept

04:42.660 --> 04:44.020
of the Eastern Other.

04:44.020 --> 04:48.680
But where 19th century Orientalism really took off in the visual and language arts coincided

04:48.680 --> 04:52.860
with Napoleon's failed attempts to invade Syria and Egypt, and the British Empire's

04:52.860 --> 04:57.420
efforts to destabilize the Ottoman Empire at the beginning of the 19th century. As both

04:57.420 --> 05:02.480
world powers sought to colonize these areas, demand back home created an explosion of art

05:02.480 --> 05:07.100
centered around the Middle East and Central Asia, often by artists who had never actually

05:07.100 --> 05:12.140
been to said territories, but you know, they had like a friend who knew someone whose cousin

05:12.140 --> 05:16.140
had done like one of those Nile cruises. And as a result, we got art that looks something

05:16.140 --> 05:17.220
like this.

05:17.220 --> 05:33.060
slave babes

05:33.060 --> 05:38.580
But for your average Jack and Jacques back in Mother's England and France, this emerging

05:38.580 --> 05:43.960
visual culture dominated perceptions of these countries. No, paintings like this were not

05:43.960 --> 05:50.240
based in reality. Yikes. But Victorian Europeans thought that they were. It's like if aliens

05:50.240 --> 05:55.120
tried to make art depicting what being an American in 2019 is like, but only having

05:55.120 --> 05:59.760
like Nickelback as a reference. But you know, they've never actually seen Nickelback. They've

05:59.760 --> 06:04.320
only like heard about them second or third hand and maybe they've seen like the photograph

06:04.320 --> 06:10.840
meme.

06:11.480 --> 06:16.200
Eventually, travel writing by European women became a thing and tried to clear up this

06:16.200 --> 06:20.260
incorrect assessment of what harem life was like because being women, they were allowed

06:20.260 --> 06:25.000
into harems. Turns out harem life is actually pretty boring. And no, they don't dress like

06:25.000 --> 06:30.180
that. And no, that's not what an odalisque is, Susan K. I'm not saying it was a good

06:30.180 --> 06:35.180
social order. I'm just saying it was nothing like the sexy licentious slave babes that

06:35.180 --> 06:39.760
these dudes imagined it to be. But the damage was done. And to this day, when you hear the

06:39.760 --> 06:45.840
word harem in the oxidant, it conjures up a very specific, very 19th century image.

06:45.840 --> 06:53.720
Sexualized, licentious, appropriative, and above all, inaccurate. But who cares? It's

06:53.720 --> 07:00.080
just media. It's just writing. It's just a painting. It doesn't have any real world consequences.

07:00.080 --> 07:04.860
And besides, they do it to us too. Watch any movie designed for non-American audiences

07:04.860 --> 07:16.120
that features an American character and it's like, oh. So that's what that's like.

07:16.120 --> 07:20.160
And of course that is true, but it is completely disingenuous to say that orientalist depictions

07:20.160 --> 07:26.620
of the middle east had no real world consequences in terms of real world politics. Categorically,

07:26.620 --> 07:32.300
it did. Just within the last year, German far right and totally not neo-nazi group AFD,

07:32.300 --> 07:37.700
anglicized as Alternative for Germany, used one of the more notorious orientalist paintings,

07:37.700 --> 07:43.080
Jean-Leon Jerome's The Slave Market, as part of a propaganda campaign against Syrian refugees

07:43.080 --> 07:47.380
being allowed entry into Germany. But other less overt examples pervade mainstream media

07:47.380 --> 07:58.280
as well. 300 is hilarious, but kind of also an insidious depiction of a war between the

07:58.280 --> 08:06.160
east and the west. And more recently we have the post 9-11 gritty realism trend of films

08:06.160 --> 08:11.200
set in the middle east, but we're not getting into that today. So we gotta colonize the

08:11.200 --> 08:16.560
motherfuckers I guess. This is the rationale behind colonization in general. Like, yeah

08:16.560 --> 08:21.240
sure we want their stuff, but really we're doing them a favor by colonizing them. I mean

08:21.240 --> 08:26.760
look at them. It's for their own good. Y'all need Jesus. And they've got this crescent

08:26.760 --> 08:31.480
moon. That's not a cross. And they've got this club they won't let us into and I don't

08:31.480 --> 08:38.600
like it. And while neither Egypt, the Ottoman Empire, nor Persia were ever technically colonies,

08:38.600 --> 08:44.560
some of their stuff was. And their historical trajectories were all deeply impacted by the

08:44.560 --> 08:51.240
effects of colonialism, the consequences of which haunt us to this day. Now I know what

08:51.240 --> 08:54.960
you're thinking. We're like 10 minutes into this video and you're like, this is not what

08:54.960 --> 08:59.920
I was promised by the thumbnail. I was promised 80s melodramatic rock opera, and I'm getting

08:59.920 --> 09:04.520
to that. But the backdrop of Orientalism is important to this discussion. If you've never

09:04.520 --> 09:08.920
read Gaston Leroux's 1910 novel, The Phantom of the Opera, you probably don't know where

09:08.920 --> 09:13.040
I'm going with this. But if you have read it, you totally know where I'm going with

09:13.040 --> 09:18.320
this. Enter the Persian, one of the main characters in Gaston Leroux's Phantom of the Opera, a

09:18.320 --> 09:22.040
fan favorite, a character so central to the narrative that basically the entire second

09:22.040 --> 09:26.440
half is told from his point of view, and a character that is either whitewashed, altered,

09:26.440 --> 09:32.040
or omitted entirely from the vast majority of the hundreds of adaptations of Phantom

09:32.040 --> 09:48.880
of the Opera. Like, nearly all of them. Like, at least 95%. Hmmmm. And on the rare occasion

09:48.880 --> 09:50.960
when he's not cut out, we get

09:50.960 --> 09:54.460
You asinine Persian dolt.

09:54.460 --> 10:00.160
The one well-known-ish adaptation, or in this case, retelling, that does feature the Persian

10:00.160 --> 10:06.640
in any role of prominence is Susan Kaye's 1990 novel titled only Phantom, which falls

10:06.640 --> 10:12.280
squarely into the worst flavors of 1980s Ayatollah, Asahollah, anti-Iranian sentiment combined

10:12.280 --> 10:16.040
with good old fashioned 19th century Orientalism, which

10:16.040 --> 10:20.320
Legalized rape is the done thing here, is it? Any man may force himself upon a woman

10:20.320 --> 10:22.000
and say it is the custom.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.760
This book is also extremely popular with a fandom. And incidentally is not available

10:25.760 --> 10:29.680
on audible. And there was a time when Phantom fandom had no goddamn sense of humor and you

10:29.680 --> 10:34.460
were not allowed to criticize this book. But it's 2020, Phantom shitposting is finally

10:34.460 --> 10:38.280
a thing, and I am the god. But we'll get to that book.

10:38.280 --> 10:43.680
First, let's take a look at the source material. Who is this Persian? What is his function

10:43.680 --> 10:48.520
within the novel? And why is he omitted from nearly every single one of the shit million

10:48.520 --> 10:55.360
adaptations of Phantom of the Opera?

10:55.360 --> 11:01.280
Gaston Leroux's novel isn't all that dissimilar from either the 1925 Lon Chaney movie or Andrew

11:01.280 --> 11:12.120
Lloyd Webber's musical or even its terrible film adaptation directed by Joel Schumacher.

11:12.120 --> 11:16.680
The key difference is the novel was originally published in serial form and framed more as

11:16.680 --> 11:21.400
a mystery instead of a tragic romance with new increments of the story introduced each

11:21.400 --> 11:28.040
week. Who is doing the bad thing? Could it be the manager? Could it be the rat catcher?

11:28.040 --> 11:33.240
Could it be the Vicomte de Chagny's older brother Philippe? Could it be this shady ethnic

11:33.240 --> 11:37.460
in the Astrakhan cap that's always running around the opera? Or could it be the skull

11:37.460 --> 11:41.120
faced incel who lives in the basement? Who's to say?

11:41.120 --> 11:45.440
I'm going to summarize the original novel, and yes, it does spoil the whole thing, so

11:45.440 --> 11:50.960
spoilers for Phantom of the Opera.

11:50.960 --> 11:55.520
Our story begins when the prima donna Larcolada falls ill, and is replaced by this young ingenue

11:55.520 --> 11:59.360
no one's ever heard of named Christine Daae, and she brings the house down with how amazing

11:59.360 --> 12:04.040
she is. During her performance, she is recognized by her childhood friend, the fuckboy Vicomte

12:04.040 --> 12:08.280
Raoul de Chagny, and he goes to her dressing room to say, hey, good job, but he overhears

12:08.280 --> 12:12.440
her talking to this guy who claims to be her voice teacher, and being a fuckboy, he's

12:12.440 --> 12:15.320
like, oh, slut.

12:15.320 --> 12:18.880
In the meanwhile, there's all these mysterious goings on. Someone calling themselves the

12:18.880 --> 12:22.520
opera ghost is extorting the new managers, some guy turns up dead with the news around

12:22.520 --> 12:26.480
his neck, there's this shady brown fellow poking around the opera all the time, and

12:26.480 --> 12:32.120
amidst it all, Christine just disappears. And of course the fuckboy is like, slut.

12:32.120 --> 12:35.160
Couple weeks later, there's a masquerade, and hey, she's back, and she pulls Raoul

12:35.160 --> 12:39.400
aside and tells him where she's been, and of course the victim-blaming fuckboy is like,

12:39.400 --> 12:43.160
slut. And she's like, no, what do I have to explain to you? That I was kidnapped by a

12:43.160 --> 12:48.200
skull-faced incel named Eric, who, well, admittedly, he told me he'd let me go as long as I didn't

12:48.200 --> 12:53.560
ever touch his mask, and you remember that thing I said earlier about human nature, where

12:53.560 --> 12:58.240
someone says, you can't have the thing, or you can't see the thing, and under normal

12:58.240 --> 13:02.160
circumstances, you wouldn't have really cared, but, you know, someone said you can't, like,

13:02.160 --> 13:05.680
see, anyway, she took off his mask, he loses his shit, and he says, you can never leave

13:05.680 --> 13:12.160
my lair, and she's like, no, you look great. Basically, she pulls that act off long enough

13:12.160 --> 13:15.640
for Eric to let her out of the basement so she can tell the victim-blaming fuckboy, oh

13:15.640 --> 13:20.900
please, God help me, and he's like, okay, how about we leave together after your next

13:20.900 --> 13:25.920
big performance? So after the next big performance, Christine just disappears right off the stage,

13:25.920 --> 13:28.920
like right in the middle of the stage. And if we're watching the musical, this would

13:28.920 --> 13:33.760
be the track down this murderer portion that leads into the final lair scene, but we're

13:33.760 --> 13:38.200
only about halfway through the book. Enter the Persian. He's never given a name because

13:38.200 --> 13:42.600
the framing device is LaRue telling the story like he's a journalist presenting it almost

13:42.600 --> 13:47.320
like found footage, like it really happened, and since in-universe the Persian isn't on

13:47.320 --> 13:52.720
great terms with, you know, the Shah, he's trying to protect this guy's identity. In

13:52.720 --> 13:57.400
terms of Gilded Age literature, at which LaRue's original novel falls right at the tail end,

13:57.400 --> 14:02.520
the Persian is an interesting character because, in most regards, he does not fall within late

14:02.520 --> 14:07.880
Victorian orientalist tropes. Like, the tragic backstory stuff totally does. When the narrative

14:07.880 --> 14:12.280
goes back to Eric's time in Persia when they first got to know each other, it definitely

14:12.280 --> 14:17.440
does the, ooh those exotic Orients, they love their bloodsport, the royals watch murder

14:17.440 --> 14:23.420
just for fun, just like the Romans, so barbaric. See, Eric moved to Persia to be like a circus

14:23.420 --> 14:28.140
performer slash architect, and while he was here, he made all this amazing architecture

14:28.140 --> 14:32.760
for the Shah. This was also where he learned to do murder real good. That's the Punjab

14:32.760 --> 14:38.140
lasso that is very clumsily handled in the musical and even more clumsily in the film

14:38.140 --> 14:43.740
somehow. It's a sneaky foreign way to kill. He Insta-garots you and you never see it coming,

14:43.740 --> 14:47.700
and the Shah loved watching Eric do this. He thought it was great. Well, anyway, the

14:47.700 --> 14:51.700
Shah liked Eric, but Eric knew too much, so he has to die, I guess, and the Persian, who

14:51.700 --> 14:56.160
has a soft spot for Eric, helped him escape and basically covered for him. The Shah suspected

14:56.160 --> 14:59.820
the Persian did this, but lacking proof, and since the Persian is like his fifth cousin

14:59.820 --> 15:03.500
or something, banished him from court instead of killing him, and he also gave him a nice

15:03.500 --> 15:07.340
pension. And so, in his new life in Paris, the Persian basically spends all his time

15:07.340 --> 15:11.620
keeping an eye on Eric and making sure he didn't do too many murders, and Eric pays

15:11.620 --> 15:17.180
him back by not murdering him when he happens to venture too close to his underground lair.

15:17.180 --> 15:21.820
So LaRue's depiction of Persia in the 1850s, when Eric and the Persian met, fell right

15:21.820 --> 15:27.460
into that orientalist trope of barbaric, exotic, and feminine orient. But the character himself

15:27.460 --> 15:32.540
is kind of ahead of his time in that, in a narrative that centers mostly white people,

15:32.540 --> 15:37.980
he has a character at all. He isn't exoticized, except insofar as everyone thinks he's kinda

15:37.980 --> 15:43.740
shady before they get to know him, he isn't barbaric, he doesn't shroud himself in mysticism,

15:43.740 --> 15:47.540
and his otherness is not at all used to set him apart from the rest of the characters.

15:47.540 --> 15:53.160
He is arguably the most well-rounded character in the book, and easily the most likable.

15:53.160 --> 15:56.900
And he doesn't die!

15:56.900 --> 16:00.260
So basically Raoul goes into the basement to rescue Christine, but gets circumvented

16:00.260 --> 16:04.420
by the Persian, who's like, hey dude, you are going to die in like half a second if

16:04.420 --> 16:09.700
I don't help you. Raoul, understandably suspicious, is like, who are you, how do you know all

16:09.700 --> 16:12.980
this, and the Persian is like, look, Eric and I basically went to college together,

16:12.980 --> 16:16.700
he did me a solid and I did him a solid, but I also got booted out of Persia BECAUSE

16:16.700 --> 16:20.460
of this asshole, so now I'm wasting my golden years cleaning up his messes. They make it

16:20.460 --> 16:24.260
all the way down to Eric's house by the lake under the opera, but then oops, accidentally

16:24.260 --> 16:31.740
end up in the torture chamber he has in his house. For, um, some reason. So that's okay,

16:31.740 --> 16:35.220
sure. Eric doesn't even notice that they're there at first, because he's too busy Christine

16:35.220 --> 16:39.420
an ultimatum that she either has to marry him or he's going to blow up the opera house.

16:39.420 --> 16:43.140
She finds out the Persian and Raoul are in there, and in short order Eric does too, and

16:43.140 --> 16:48.380
he turns the torture chamber on. It's basically a sauna. Eventually Christine is like, okay

16:48.380 --> 16:53.180
okay I'll marry you, just please let these guys go, and Eric is like, okay, and he does,

16:53.180 --> 16:56.260
and the Persian wakes up in his home like nothing had happened. So by this point the

16:56.260 --> 16:59.820
Persian is like, you know what, I have covered for this asshole for way too long, I don't

16:59.820 --> 17:03.420
care what I owe him, I have paid my debt to his ass, I'm going to the police and I'm telling

17:03.420 --> 17:07.180
them everything. And just as he's about to do that, knock knock, guess who's at the door,

17:07.180 --> 17:15.420
it's Eric! And he plops down on the Persian chaise lounge and he's like, hey bud, um,

17:15.420 --> 17:21.540
I'm sorry about all that, uh, I let her go, um, as far as I know she's going to elope

17:21.540 --> 17:33.260
with Raoul, um, are we cool? And the Persian is like, dude what the fuck? When Christine

17:33.260 --> 17:37.100
agrees to marry him, Eric in his infinite crazy assumes that she is totally playing

17:37.100 --> 17:40.740
him and has every intention of killing herself rather than being his wife, because he is

17:40.740 --> 17:47.580
just the worst. Which he is. But as in the musical, she kisses him and he realizes like,

17:47.580 --> 17:51.540
holy shit, she's actually willing to go through with this. It is at this point that he concedes

17:51.540 --> 17:55.260
to himself how horrible he's been and is so overcome with emotion that he lets her go,

17:55.260 --> 17:58.540
gives her his blessing, and makes her promise that she'll come back and bury him once he

17:58.540 --> 18:02.360
dies of all this love he's feeling, which given that we've still got some Victorian

18:02.360 --> 18:06.220
vapors going on, should be in a couple weeks or so. Eric relates all this to the Persian,

18:06.220 --> 18:10.520
who relates it to the narrator, LaRue. Eric presumably does die, Christine presumably

18:10.520 --> 18:14.140
does come back to bury him, and the Persian dies an old man, safe and happy in his home

18:14.140 --> 18:20.940
in Paris. The end. So with regard to the most famous Phantom adaptation, in terms of pure

18:20.940 --> 18:25.980
plot utility, you probably recognize the character of the Persian in the character of Madame

18:25.980 --> 18:38.060
Giry. She kind of floats around, warns people about stuff, and then when the time comes,

18:38.060 --> 18:42.500
she's the one who shows Raoul how to get down to the lair and how to protect himself against

18:42.500 --> 18:49.860
the Punjab lasso. Hell, in the film version, she's even involved in the tragic backstory

18:49.860 --> 18:55.040
and helps him escape the thing, both traits from the Persian in the original novel. I'm

18:55.040 --> 18:59.760
not saying Andrew Lloyd Webber is bad for replacing the Persian with a white woman.

18:59.760 --> 19:04.480
He's bad for other reasons. But little known fact about Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom

19:04.480 --> 19:09.400
of the Opera is that the original plan was not to write an original musical, but to produce

19:09.400 --> 19:14.200
Ken Hill's 1976 adaptation of Phantom of the Opera, which Hughes extremely close to

19:14.200 --> 19:22.880
LaRue's book and does feature the Persian as a major supporting character. In fairness,

19:22.880 --> 19:27.200
this musical is just really genuinely terrible, and I can't say they made the wrong choice

19:27.200 --> 19:41.680
by deciding to ghost on Ken Hill and then just writing their own. But it must needs

19:41.680 --> 19:45.680
be remarked, but one of the major changes that they made from the Ken Hill musical,

19:45.680 --> 19:50.960
itself the inspiration for the current Broadway behemoth, is that it cuts out the Persian.

19:50.960 --> 19:55.080
The closest thing that could be considered a reference, either to the character or Eric's

19:55.080 --> 20:06.880
time in Persia, is this here monkey, which… I mean I've seen this show like 400 times

20:06.880 --> 20:12.680
and I still don't know what they were going for with the monkey. And this falls within

20:12.680 --> 20:17.320
the trend of adaptations not only cutting the character out, but leaving in a replacement

20:17.320 --> 20:22.200
role, basically conceding that some character performing the Persian's role in the story,

20:22.200 --> 20:26.600
at least if you keep it as close to the original novel as Andrew Lloyd Webber did, is necessary

20:26.600 --> 20:31.760
for the plot. As long as they're white. This began with the first big adaptation,

20:31.760 --> 20:36.600
Karl Lamali's 1925 feature film The Phantom of the Opera starring Lon Chaney. The Persian

20:36.600 --> 20:42.120
is in this movie, he's got his Astrakhan cap and everything, only he's not actually

20:42.120 --> 20:48.120
here. This is not Persian at all, but a French white police inspector named Ledoux who's

20:48.120 --> 20:55.560
pretending to be Persian for… reasons. And he's been tracking that phantom for months.

20:55.560 --> 21:01.680
In disguise? And now he's found him, but instead of involving the police, for whom

21:01.680 --> 21:09.360
he works, instead he just takes Raoul for some reason. You can probably guess why. Yep,

21:09.400 --> 21:14.740
tale as old as film. The earlier cuts of the film originally hewed way closer to the novel.

21:14.740 --> 21:19.880
That Astrakhan cap is there because in the original cut, Ledoux was the Persian. Even

21:19.880 --> 21:24.640
his casting choice is somewhat telling. Ledoux's actor, Arthur ibn Karoo, was actually born

21:24.640 --> 21:28.800
in Armenia and was a character actor known for playing shady foreigners, such that he

21:28.800 --> 21:33.200
rarely got to play a good guy as he does in this movie. And it also had the novel's

21:33.200 --> 21:38.040
ending, with Erik letting Christine go instead of being eaten alive by an angry mom. So they

21:38.080 --> 21:43.360
shot it, and then they changed it, and the Persian was a secret white the whole time.

21:43.360 --> 21:49.280
And that trend did not exist in a vacuum either. This follows Paramount's 1921 hit The Sheik,

21:49.280 --> 21:56.280
starring Rudolph Valentino, in which Valentino Sheik is portrayed… differently. But it

21:56.280 --> 22:02.840
being a romantic comedy and that the eponymous Sheik gets the girl in the end, don't worry.

22:02.840 --> 22:07.640
We find out that he was actually a secret white the whole time, just like Esmeralda.

22:07.640 --> 22:13.840
I should do a video about characters of color and media who were, like, revealed to be secretly

22:13.840 --> 22:18.760
white the whole time. We can call it Dolezals.

22:18.760 --> 22:23.080
Now this was before the Hays Code, so it wasn't yet mandated that the bad man must be punished

22:23.080 --> 22:27.680
on screen, but the studio thought that should be the case because early audiences didn't

22:28.680 --> 22:33.840
We cannot have the bad man, what does the murders, get a sympathetic, tragic ending.

22:33.840 --> 22:40.640
And moreover, we cannot have an ethnic be both a central character and heroic. And live.

22:40.640 --> 22:45.640
The 1943 version has not one, but two Raoul's who vie for Christine's affections.

22:45.640 --> 22:59.240
One is a cop and the other likes to play detective, so they team up to rescue Christine. I mean,

22:59.240 --> 23:02.760
they don't really have a history with the Phantom, but they kind of serve the purpose

23:02.760 --> 23:08.040
of expediting the third act along to its conclusion. Also, this movie kind of owns because it ends

23:08.040 --> 23:12.920
with Christine fucking off without either of them. Like, bye!

23:12.920 --> 23:18.600
Then, yes, Phantom on Ice. The Phantom has, like, a whole chorus of acolytes slash groupies

23:18.600 --> 23:23.920
that exist. I feel like we don't talk enough about the fact that there was, like, this

23:23.920 --> 23:28.840
whole era of human history where Thing on Ice was so ubiquitous it was parodied in an

23:28.840 --> 23:30.200
episode of Rugrats.

23:30.200 --> 23:39.160
Reptar, you have come back to me. Yes, dear, indeed I have.

23:39.160 --> 23:45.080
Speaking of the 90s, possibly the most early 90s Thing ever set to film, Phantom of the Mall,

23:45.080 --> 23:51.160
yes, a real movie, wherein the Phantom Eric does not torturedly play the organ in his basement,

23:51.160 --> 23:58.600
he torturedly lifts. He is not an angel of music, he is an angel of roundhouse kicks.

23:58.600 --> 24:03.000
And in this version, our Persian is... it's Pauly Shore.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
I promise not to spit in your yogurt.

24:05.000 --> 24:09.160
The 1990 movie starring Charles Dance, yes, that Charles Dance,

24:11.000 --> 24:16.440
our Persian replacement is Eric's dad, played by Burt Lancaster, who hid him away as a baby

24:16.440 --> 24:23.000
and raised him to be a... Phantom of the Opera that punches plastic deer.

24:25.560 --> 24:26.840
Oh yeah, let's watch that again.

24:28.600 --> 24:39.080
In 1998, Italian filmmaker Dario Argento directed his own adaptation and the sort of romantic

24:39.080 --> 24:44.760
analogue between its Phantom and Persian replacement, and in this one the Phantom is a tortured

24:44.760 --> 24:51.480
rapist who is not deformed and our Persian surrogate is a bunch of rats. Friendly friendly

24:51.480 --> 24:58.680
rats. This, for the record, is the worst adaptation of Phantom. It's the worst one.

24:59.880 --> 25:04.280
It's bad. But of course the most well-known replacement is Madame Giry in the Andrew Lloyd

25:04.280 --> 25:08.920
Webber adaptation, who serves the purpose of filling in the Phantom's backstory after

25:08.920 --> 25:15.240
seeing him on his world freak tour years prior. There was, I shall never forget him,

25:15.560 --> 25:22.600
a man locked in a cage. But being too chicken shit to do anything else after ratting him out

25:22.600 --> 25:29.640
to the gilded youth. He lives across the lake, monsieur. This is as far as I dare go. And all

25:29.640 --> 25:33.640
of this is to say nothing about adaptations that change their source material so much that there

25:33.640 --> 25:39.000
isn't really a Persian surrogate at all, like the 1962 Hammer horror film starring Herbert Lam,

25:39.000 --> 25:44.840
or the only good Phantom of the Opera movie, Brian De Palma's 1974 film, Phantom of the Paradise.

25:44.840 --> 25:50.920
I know drug reel from Real Real! Of course the Persian is not absent from 100% of adaptations,

25:50.920 --> 25:55.960
even if he is absent from all of the ones you've ever heard of. There was a 1988 animated movie

25:55.960 --> 26:01.880
that's one of those like classic literature for kids things from the 80s that had a budget of like

26:02.600 --> 26:10.200
two. You can find the house by the river? Come. And he's also in the terrible 1991 musical that

26:10.200 --> 26:14.520
was released on video and sold in all of the stores and poor fools kept buying it,

26:14.520 --> 26:19.080
thinking it was the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical and then being horribly disappointed when they

26:19.080 --> 26:25.400
got home. You may follow me into the darkness if you like, dar-o-ga. Because for the most part,

26:25.400 --> 26:30.200
the trend with this character, despite being extremely well liked by fans, has been erasure,

26:30.200 --> 26:35.240
because I guess we just don't know what to do with him. But when it's not erasure,

26:35.240 --> 26:42.520
are you telling me the girl is transferable? Like the Grand Vizier's signet ring that whoever

26:42.520 --> 26:49.000
takes one must take the other? I sighed. It is often the custom in such matters. Oh, I see.

26:49.000 --> 26:54.520
He said contemptuously. Legalized rape is the done thing here, is it? Any man may force himself upon

26:54.520 --> 26:59.640
a woman and say it is the custom. Well, then we circle back to Orientalism. This is all a prelude

26:59.640 --> 27:03.960
to discuss what is debatably the most memorable take on the character outside of the original

27:03.960 --> 27:11.560
novel, Susan Kay's Phantom and how much it bites hard. Look at this cover. Yeah, this is a reprint.

27:11.560 --> 27:17.320
The original was much more like 90s romance novel. You try being the only girl in the Phantom forums

27:17.320 --> 27:24.920
who hated this book in 2001. Anyway, I'm just explaining myself because a lot of Phantom fans

27:24.920 --> 27:29.720
really like this book and it really changed a lot of the foundations of the fandom itself.

27:29.720 --> 27:35.240
Most fans even call the Persian by the name Susan Kay gave him in the book, Nadir Khan. So Phantom

27:35.240 --> 27:40.920
is basically a 600-page novel about the life of the Phantom, split into six different points of

27:40.920 --> 27:45.400
view. Nadir is the point of view character for Eric's 20s, which he set squarely in Iran,

27:45.400 --> 27:52.520
then Persia, starting in the year 1850. So let's take a look at Persia in 1850. Nasir al-Din Shah

27:52.520 --> 27:58.280
was the actual real-life Shah, newly in his reign, and this book paints him as an ineffectual

27:58.280 --> 28:06.760
bloodthirsty backwards tyrant. You know, Iran didn't have great luck with Shahs for the last

28:06.760 --> 28:14.120
200-ish years of them. But on the real, Nasir al-Din Shah was a mixed personality whose reign is

28:14.120 --> 28:20.040
marked by the constant Sturm and Drang about modernizing Persia by Western standards. And in

28:20.040 --> 28:25.640
absolute fairness, the Shah of Persia at the time was what academic historians describe as a f***ing

28:25.640 --> 28:30.440
weirdo. During research for this, we learned about a game he'd play with his wives and children

28:30.440 --> 28:35.000
called Lights Out where he'd just like turn the lights off and everyone in the room would just

28:35.000 --> 28:42.280
have to beat the shit out of each other in total darkness. Monarchs. But he didn't like jerk off

28:42.280 --> 28:46.600
using the blood of virgins and assassinate half of his court as he does in this book. And this

28:46.600 --> 28:51.320
is another way that the book really influenced the fandom, by playing into these ugly 19th century

28:51.400 --> 28:55.880
orientalist tropes. We have to make Eric's backstory all harsh and tragic, and part of that

28:55.880 --> 29:02.360
is painting Persia as this cutthroat awful place, with stuff like corruption and executions and

29:02.360 --> 29:09.240
slavery. So much slavery. Which was nothing like the US in the 1850s. LaRue's original novel frames

29:09.240 --> 29:13.960
Eric against a world that is horrible, that everywhere he went molded him into the nightmare

29:13.960 --> 29:19.160
fuckboy he turned into. It is the same sort of like Ender's Game logic where it's like,

29:19.160 --> 29:24.600
I know you have a kind and gentle heart, but you're just so good at murder. In a better world,

29:24.600 --> 29:30.360
or hell, if he had just been normal looking, he would have been a respectable man. In fact,

29:30.360 --> 29:35.080
that is how the original novel ends, LaRue lamenting how terrible the world is to disadvantaged

29:35.080 --> 29:39.480
people, and positing that Eric could have been one of the world's great minds if the world wasn't

29:39.480 --> 29:45.720
so shitty to people with disabilities. Which, for 1910, is a pretty nuanced take. Hell, for now it's

29:45.720 --> 29:50.840
a nuanced take. Eric looked like a monster, so people treated him like one, and he behaved like

29:50.840 --> 29:55.880
one in kind, but he was not born a monster. But while Susan Kay does not drop that angle,

29:55.880 --> 29:59.560
the entire Persia sequence is framed as different from all of the other locations,

29:59.560 --> 30:04.280
which are set in France and Italy. It was Persia that really made him into a monster,

30:04.280 --> 30:09.080
because the culture is just that bad. So after all this, you might be asking yourself what the

30:09.080 --> 30:13.400
point of this video was. Was it really just an elaborate excuse to talk about Phantom of the

30:13.400 --> 30:19.480
Opera for half an hour and dump on this book? Yes. But while we're here, I don't mean to imply

30:19.480 --> 30:25.000
that Gaston LaRue was intentionally trying to write the wokest book ever featuring a non-western

30:25.000 --> 30:29.240
character. But I don't think it was unintentional that he went out of his way to place a Persian

30:29.240 --> 30:34.040
character as basically the moral backbone of his story in a market that basically demanded white

30:34.040 --> 30:39.640
heroes and relegated everybody else to stereotype, spectacle, or both. Fundamentally, Orientalist

30:39.640 --> 30:45.240
media and the stereotypes it creates, even what we see as benign or even benevolent,

30:45.240 --> 30:50.920
are a kind of erasure, a simplified refutation of the realities of a lot of people. But it is

30:50.920 --> 30:55.800
erasure that serves a socio-political purpose as well. And I think it's interesting that with this

30:55.800 --> 31:01.400
character, we effectively had nothing but erasure all the way up to the late 1980s. And once the

31:01.400 --> 31:06.360
Persian was reintroduced back into Phantom fandom through Kay's novel, in a lot of ways it was a lot

31:06.360 --> 31:11.320
more regressive than LaRue's original novel was, and fans were keen to embrace the more

31:11.320 --> 31:16.920
Orientalist tropes, effectively replacing erasure with Orientalism. I was in those forums 20 years

31:16.920 --> 31:21.960
ago too, and while I never liked this book, I can't say I did not uncritically enjoy some of

31:21.960 --> 31:26.520
those Orientalist elements extracted both from the book and from the original novel. And Phantom of

31:26.520 --> 31:31.800
the Opera is far, far from the only modern example where this is a thing. This isn't to say you're a

31:31.800 --> 31:36.520
bad person if that angle appealed to you, but rather I would like to encourage you to critically

31:36.520 --> 31:42.280
think about why that angle appealed to people. Why do so much of old western media be like that?

31:42.280 --> 31:47.720
Why do so much of it still be like that? And recognize that there are some very real consequences

31:47.720 --> 31:53.160
to Orientalism in media, even from ignorant racists painting sex slaves in the 19th century.

31:55.480 --> 31:59.560
But I also wonder, could there be an adaptation of Phantom of the Opera that keeps the character

31:59.560 --> 32:04.760
of the Persian and this idea of Eric living in Persia for a while as a part of his backstory

32:04.760 --> 32:09.560
without incorporating those ugly Orientalist tropes? The world has changed a lot in the 110

32:09.560 --> 32:14.280
years since Phantom of the Opera was published, but for all of its pulpiness and ham-fisted

32:14.280 --> 32:19.480
Edwardian melodrama, it still keeps getting remade and re-enters the conversation. But the

32:19.480 --> 32:23.560
consistent erasure of one of its main characters is a testament to how little the needle has nudged

32:23.560 --> 32:28.200
in this one regard. And while we're here, part of the reason I kept putting off releasing this video

32:28.280 --> 32:33.400
was because of escalating tension between the US and Iran, and given that this whole episode

32:33.400 --> 32:40.200
concerns an Iranian character, I wasn't sure how or even if I should address that. And even now,

32:40.200 --> 32:45.880
we still don't know what's going to happen or how this is going to play out, but I will say this.

32:45.880 --> 32:51.800
In times of stress, there is a tendency to fall back on narratives that feel familiar. And if we

32:51.800 --> 32:56.360
keep seeing narratives of a certain people being othered enough, eventually it makes sense to start

32:56.360 --> 33:01.960
conflict with these people, even if there's no benefit to either side in doing so, save perhaps

33:01.960 --> 33:06.920
the political. So I wonder if it is possible to challenge ourselves to evolve past these narratives

33:06.920 --> 33:13.720
which have already caused so, so much harm. But again, maybe that's just human nature.

33:15.480 --> 33:20.200
And with that, now I have to do my ad read. I of course was going to recommend some version of

33:20.200 --> 33:24.360
Phantom of the Opera, but instead I'll recommend the book that I'm listening to right now,

33:24.360 --> 33:29.640
which is Ronan Farrow's War on Peace, the end of diplomacy and the decline of American influence.

33:30.200 --> 33:34.600

That was awkward.

34:20.200 --> 34:23.800
Okie dokie, here's me reading some quotes about slavery.

34:24.760 --> 34:31.240
Why risk offending the Shah for the sake of a girl who is only a slave? He gave a great cry of rage,

34:31.240 --> 34:34.600
lifted the table in front of him, and threw it across the room with a force that splintered the

34:34.600 --> 34:43.480
legs asunder from the marble top. Only a slave. Only an animal. You asinine Persian dolt,

34:43.480 --> 34:51.080
he roared. Get out of my way quickly before I forget all that I owe you. I'm fed up with this

34:51.080 --> 35:01.080
world. I raised my shoulders helplessly. The Shah's sister is his personal property to be

35:01.080 --> 35:06.520
disposed of as he sees fit. Eric looked at me incredulously. Are you telling me the girl

35:06.520 --> 35:11.640
is transferable? Well, the grand vizier's signet ring. Whoever takes one must take the other.

35:12.280 --> 35:18.920
I sighed. It is often the custom in such matters. Oh, I see. Legalized rape is just

35:18.920 --> 35:24.600
a done thing here, is it? He said contemptuously. Any man may force himself in and say it's the

35:24.600 --> 35:30.600
custom. My God, what country? And he turned away with such fierce disgust that I felt

35:30.600 --> 35:32.600
faintly ashamed of my own race.
