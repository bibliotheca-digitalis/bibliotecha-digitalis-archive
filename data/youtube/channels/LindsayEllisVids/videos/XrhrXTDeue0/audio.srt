1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,400
Eric, why did you send her away? You desired her and she was yours to use exactly as you

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,520
pleased. Why risk offending the Shah for the sake of a girl who was only a slave? He gave

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,680
a great cry of rage, lifted the table in front of him, and threw it across the room with

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,240
a force that splintered the legs asunder from the marble top.

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,880
Only a slave! Only an animal!

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,880
He roared.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:35,020
You asinine Persian dolt! Get out of my way! Quickly! Before I forget all that I owe you!

8
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,080
Is this another of your quaint and delightful customs?

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,640
He demanded furiously.

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,840
Has no one in this godforsaken court heard of a decent period of mourning?

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,740
I raised my shoulders helplessly.

12
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:50,760
The Shah's sister is his personal property to be disposed of as he sees fit. Eric looked

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,760
at me incredulously.

14
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,960
Are you telling me the girl is transferrable? Like the Grand Vizier's signet ring that

15
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,280
whoever takes one must take the other?

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,200
I sighed. It is often the custom in such matters.

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,960
Oh, I see.

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,440
He said contemptuously.

19
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,600
Legalized rape is the done thing here, is it? Any man may force himself upon a woman

20
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,500
and say it is the custom. My god, what a country!

21
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,280
And he turned away with such fierce disgust that I felt faintly ashamed of my own race.

22
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,440
She is poor and has children to feed. I am able to pay the price, she asks, without hardship.

23
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,880
Why should I stand here and haggle with her like a miser?

24
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,680
She expects it, Eric. I tell you, it is the custom.

25
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,280
Fuck. Your. Customs.

26
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,680
There is something intrinsic in human nature that when someone says,

27
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,240
This thing belongs to us, not you, and no, you can't have it, the excluded group loses

28
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,200
their shit, whether they actually would have wanted the thing or not. Like, I didn't want

29
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,720
to go to Shelley's birthday party. I don't even like Shelley, but I find out that I'm

30
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,720
not invited.

31
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,680
Oh. That bitch.

32
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,440
This attitude dominates discussions of cultural appropriation in particular, where one group

33
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,920
says, no, this thing belongs to us and actually has deep cultural and religious significance

34
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,200
that you clearly do not understand, nor do you care to, so maybe don't wear a featherhead

35
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,540
dress as part of your lingerie line. Like, maybe the excluded group has zero interest

36
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,540
in wearing a featherhead dress with a lingerie line, but they're kind of offended at the

37
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,160
idea that someone said you can't.

38
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,880
Why can't I do sexy featherhead dress? I didn't steal your land or violate countless treaties

39
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:45,120
or give you diseases to which you had no natural immunity. I personally was not there. And

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,120
no, I wasn't going to wear a sexy feather headdress, but I should be able to without

41
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,400
being called problematic.

42
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,600
But this attitude is nothing new. Let us go back to the mid-19th century, when travel

43
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:02,800
writing was all the rage and there was particular interest in the Orient. And I don't mean that

44
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,400
Orient, although that was certainly also a thing, but in this case, Egypt, the Ottoman

45
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,800
Empire, and Persia.

46
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,440
It is from male European travelers to the Ottoman Empire that Europe was introduced

47
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,600
to the idea of the harem, but only the idea, because men weren't allowed into harems.

48
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,640
See? That's kind of the whole point. Only women and male relatives are allowed into

49
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,240
harems. Them's the rules.

50
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,020
And of course, our 19th century Eurotrash did not like that. Why won't you let me into

51
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,280
your club filled with slave ladies wearing those sexy belly dancer outfits and those

52
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:42,760
finger symbol thingies and those badass eunuchs with their sabres? Why can I not have the

53
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,760
ring?

54
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,960
And with this desire to be included in a space in which they were not allowed, their presumptions

55
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,320
about the culture they were visiting combined with this forbidden space made their imaginations

56
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,600
run wild.

57
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,240
If we aren't allowed in there, it must be because it's sexy. Licentious. It must be

58
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:05,320
full of these sexy slave babes who don't really want it, but also kinda want it.

59
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,840
These are some early mainstream European examples of what Columbia University professor of literature

60
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,280
Edward Said defined as Orientalism in his 1978 book, Orientalism.

61
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,760
European depictions of the Middle East date as far back as the medieval period. The Crusades.

62
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,920
A thing that happened.

63
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,320
But the rise of what we'll call Orientalist media really begins in the 18th century, as

64
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,580
major European world powers go into war with the Ottoman Empire. Operas like Mozart's Abduction

65
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:37,300
from the Seraglio, travelogues like Lady Elizabeth Craven's A Journey Through Crimea to Constantinople,

66
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,660
and Lord Byron's poetry-slash-personal antics were all popular proliferators of this concept

67
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,020
of the Eastern Other.

68
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,680
But where 19th century Orientalism really took off in the visual and language arts coincided

69
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,860
with Napoleon's failed attempts to invade Syria and Egypt, and the British Empire's

70
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,420
efforts to destabilize the Ottoman Empire at the beginning of the 19th century. As both

71
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:02,480
world powers sought to colonize these areas, demand back home created an explosion of art

72
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,100
centered around the Middle East and Central Asia, often by artists who had never actually

73
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:12,140
been to said territories, but you know, they had like a friend who knew someone whose cousin

74
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,140
had done like one of those Nile cruises. And as a result, we got art that looks something

75
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,220
like this.

76
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:33,060
slave babes

77
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,580
But for your average Jack and Jacques back in Mother's England and France, this emerging

78
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,960
visual culture dominated perceptions of these countries. No, paintings like this were not

79
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:50,240
based in reality. Yikes. But Victorian Europeans thought that they were. It's like if aliens

80
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,120
tried to make art depicting what being an American in 2019 is like, but only having

81
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,760
like Nickelback as a reference. But you know, they've never actually seen Nickelback. They've

82
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,320
only like heard about them second or third hand and maybe they've seen like the photograph

83
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:10,840
meme.

84
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:16,200
Eventually, travel writing by European women became a thing and tried to clear up this

85
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,260
incorrect assessment of what harem life was like because being women, they were allowed

86
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:25,000
into harems. Turns out harem life is actually pretty boring. And no, they don't dress like

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,180
that. And no, that's not what an odalisque is, Susan K. I'm not saying it was a good

88
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,180
social order. I'm just saying it was nothing like the sexy licentious slave babes that

89
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,760
these dudes imagined it to be. But the damage was done. And to this day, when you hear the

90
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,840
word harem in the oxidant, it conjures up a very specific, very 19th century image.

91
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:53,720
Sexualized, licentious, appropriative, and above all, inaccurate. But who cares? It's

92
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:00,080
just media. It's just writing. It's just a painting. It doesn't have any real world consequences.

93
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,860
And besides, they do it to us too. Watch any movie designed for non-American audiences

94
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:16,120
that features an American character and it's like, oh. So that's what that's like.

95
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,160
And of course that is true, but it is completely disingenuous to say that orientalist depictions

96
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,620
of the middle east had no real world consequences in terms of real world politics. Categorically,

97
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:32,300
it did. Just within the last year, German far right and totally not neo-nazi group AFD,

98
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,700
anglicized as Alternative for Germany, used one of the more notorious orientalist paintings,

99
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:43,080
Jean-Leon Jerome's The Slave Market, as part of a propaganda campaign against Syrian refugees

100
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,380
being allowed entry into Germany. But other less overt examples pervade mainstream media

101
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:58,280
as well. 300 is hilarious, but kind of also an insidious depiction of a war between the

102
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:06,160
east and the west. And more recently we have the post 9-11 gritty realism trend of films

103
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,200
set in the middle east, but we're not getting into that today. So we gotta colonize the

104
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,560
motherfuckers I guess. This is the rationale behind colonization in general. Like, yeah

105
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,240
sure we want their stuff, but really we're doing them a favor by colonizing them. I mean

106
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,760
look at them. It's for their own good. Y'all need Jesus. And they've got this crescent

107
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,480
moon. That's not a cross. And they've got this club they won't let us into and I don't

108
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:38,600
like it. And while neither Egypt, the Ottoman Empire, nor Persia were ever technically colonies,

109
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:44,560
some of their stuff was. And their historical trajectories were all deeply impacted by the

110
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,240
effects of colonialism, the consequences of which haunt us to this day. Now I know what

111
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,960
you're thinking. We're like 10 minutes into this video and you're like, this is not what

112
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,920
I was promised by the thumbnail. I was promised 80s melodramatic rock opera, and I'm getting

113
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,520
to that. But the backdrop of Orientalism is important to this discussion. If you've never

114
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,920
read Gaston Leroux's 1910 novel, The Phantom of the Opera, you probably don't know where

115
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,040
I'm going with this. But if you have read it, you totally know where I'm going with

116
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,320
this. Enter the Persian, one of the main characters in Gaston Leroux's Phantom of the Opera, a

117
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,040
fan favorite, a character so central to the narrative that basically the entire second

118
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,440
half is told from his point of view, and a character that is either whitewashed, altered,

119
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,040
or omitted entirely from the vast majority of the hundreds of adaptations of Phantom

120
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:48,880
of the Opera. Like, nearly all of them. Like, at least 95%. Hmmmm. And on the rare occasion

121
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,960
when he's not cut out, we get

122
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,460
You asinine Persian dolt.

123
00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:00,160
The one well-known-ish adaptation, or in this case, retelling, that does feature the Persian

124
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,640
in any role of prominence is Susan Kaye's 1990 novel titled only Phantom, which falls

125
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,280
squarely into the worst flavors of 1980s Ayatollah, Asahollah, anti-Iranian sentiment combined

126
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,040
with good old fashioned 19th century Orientalism, which

127
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,320
Legalized rape is the done thing here, is it? Any man may force himself upon a woman

128
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,000
and say it is the custom.

129
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,760
This book is also extremely popular with a fandom. And incidentally is not available

130
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,680
on audible. And there was a time when Phantom fandom had no goddamn sense of humor and you

131
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,460
were not allowed to criticize this book. But it's 2020, Phantom shitposting is finally

132
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,280
a thing, and I am the god. But we'll get to that book.

133
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:43,680
First, let's take a look at the source material. Who is this Persian? What is his function

134
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,520
within the novel? And why is he omitted from nearly every single one of the shit million

135
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:55,360
adaptations of Phantom of the Opera?

136
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,280
Gaston Leroux's novel isn't all that dissimilar from either the 1925 Lon Chaney movie or Andrew

137
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:12,120
Lloyd Webber's musical or even its terrible film adaptation directed by Joel Schumacher.

138
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,680
The key difference is the novel was originally published in serial form and framed more as

139
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,400
a mystery instead of a tragic romance with new increments of the story introduced each

140
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:28,040
week. Who is doing the bad thing? Could it be the manager? Could it be the rat catcher?

141
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,240
Could it be the Vicomte de Chagny's older brother Philippe? Could it be this shady ethnic

142
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,460
in the Astrakhan cap that's always running around the opera? Or could it be the skull

143
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,120
faced incel who lives in the basement? Who's to say?

144
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,440
I'm going to summarize the original novel, and yes, it does spoil the whole thing, so

145
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,960
spoilers for Phantom of the Opera.

146
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,520
Our story begins when the prima donna Larcolada falls ill, and is replaced by this young ingenue

147
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,360
no one's ever heard of named Christine Daae, and she brings the house down with how amazing

148
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,040
she is. During her performance, she is recognized by her childhood friend, the fuckboy Vicomte

149
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,280
Raoul de Chagny, and he goes to her dressing room to say, hey, good job, but he overhears

150
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,440
her talking to this guy who claims to be her voice teacher, and being a fuckboy, he's

151
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,320
like, oh, slut.

152
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,880
In the meanwhile, there's all these mysterious goings on. Someone calling themselves the

153
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,520
opera ghost is extorting the new managers, some guy turns up dead with the news around

154
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,480
his neck, there's this shady brown fellow poking around the opera all the time, and

155
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,120
amidst it all, Christine just disappears. And of course the fuckboy is like, slut.

156
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,160
Couple weeks later, there's a masquerade, and hey, she's back, and she pulls Raoul

157
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,400
aside and tells him where she's been, and of course the victim-blaming fuckboy is like,

158
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,160
slut. And she's like, no, what do I have to explain to you? That I was kidnapped by a

159
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,200
skull-faced incel named Eric, who, well, admittedly, he told me he'd let me go as long as I didn't

160
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,560
ever touch his mask, and you remember that thing I said earlier about human nature, where

161
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,240
someone says, you can't have the thing, or you can't see the thing, and under normal

162
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,160
circumstances, you wouldn't have really cared, but, you know, someone said you can't, like,

163
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,680
see, anyway, she took off his mask, he loses his shit, and he says, you can never leave

164
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:12,160
my lair, and she's like, no, you look great. Basically, she pulls that act off long enough

165
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,640
for Eric to let her out of the basement so she can tell the victim-blaming fuckboy, oh

166
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,900
please, God help me, and he's like, okay, how about we leave together after your next

167
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:25,920
big performance? So after the next big performance, Christine just disappears right off the stage,

168
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,920
like right in the middle of the stage. And if we're watching the musical, this would

169
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,760
be the track down this murderer portion that leads into the final lair scene, but we're

170
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,200
only about halfway through the book. Enter the Persian. He's never given a name because

171
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,600
the framing device is LaRue telling the story like he's a journalist presenting it almost

172
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,320
like found footage, like it really happened, and since in-universe the Persian isn't on

173
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:52,720
great terms with, you know, the Shah, he's trying to protect this guy's identity. In

174
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,400
terms of Gilded Age literature, at which LaRue's original novel falls right at the tail end,

175
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:02,520
the Persian is an interesting character because, in most regards, he does not fall within late

176
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:07,880
Victorian orientalist tropes. Like, the tragic backstory stuff totally does. When the narrative

177
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,280
goes back to Eric's time in Persia when they first got to know each other, it definitely

178
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,440
does the, ooh those exotic Orients, they love their bloodsport, the royals watch murder

179
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,420
just for fun, just like the Romans, so barbaric. See, Eric moved to Persia to be like a circus

180
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:28,140
performer slash architect, and while he was here, he made all this amazing architecture

181
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:32,760
for the Shah. This was also where he learned to do murder real good. That's the Punjab

182
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:38,140
lasso that is very clumsily handled in the musical and even more clumsily in the film

183
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:43,740
somehow. It's a sneaky foreign way to kill. He Insta-garots you and you never see it coming,

184
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,700
and the Shah loved watching Eric do this. He thought it was great. Well, anyway, the

185
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,700
Shah liked Eric, but Eric knew too much, so he has to die, I guess, and the Persian, who

186
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,160
has a soft spot for Eric, helped him escape and basically covered for him. The Shah suspected

187
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,820
the Persian did this, but lacking proof, and since the Persian is like his fifth cousin

188
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,500
or something, banished him from court instead of killing him, and he also gave him a nice

189
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,340
pension. And so, in his new life in Paris, the Persian basically spends all his time

190
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,620
keeping an eye on Eric and making sure he didn't do too many murders, and Eric pays

191
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:17,180
him back by not murdering him when he happens to venture too close to his underground lair.

192
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:21,820
So LaRue's depiction of Persia in the 1850s, when Eric and the Persian met, fell right

193
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:27,460
into that orientalist trope of barbaric, exotic, and feminine orient. But the character himself

194
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:32,540
is kind of ahead of his time in that, in a narrative that centers mostly white people,

195
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:37,980
he has a character at all. He isn't exoticized, except insofar as everyone thinks he's kinda

196
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:43,740
shady before they get to know him, he isn't barbaric, he doesn't shroud himself in mysticism,

197
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,540
and his otherness is not at all used to set him apart from the rest of the characters.

198
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:53,160
He is arguably the most well-rounded character in the book, and easily the most likable.

199
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,900
And he doesn't die!

200
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,260
So basically Raoul goes into the basement to rescue Christine, but gets circumvented

201
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,420
by the Persian, who's like, hey dude, you are going to die in like half a second if

202
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:09,700
I don't help you. Raoul, understandably suspicious, is like, who are you, how do you know all

203
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,980
this, and the Persian is like, look, Eric and I basically went to college together,

204
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,700
he did me a solid and I did him a solid, but I also got booted out of Persia BECAUSE

205
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,460
of this asshole, so now I'm wasting my golden years cleaning up his messes. They make it

206
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:24,260
all the way down to Eric's house by the lake under the opera, but then oops, accidentally

207
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:31,740
end up in the torture chamber he has in his house. For, um, some reason. So that's okay,

208
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,220
sure. Eric doesn't even notice that they're there at first, because he's too busy Christine

209
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,420
an ultimatum that she either has to marry him or he's going to blow up the opera house.

210
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,140
She finds out the Persian and Raoul are in there, and in short order Eric does too, and

211
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:48,380
he turns the torture chamber on. It's basically a sauna. Eventually Christine is like, okay

212
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:53,180
okay I'll marry you, just please let these guys go, and Eric is like, okay, and he does,

213
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,260
and the Persian wakes up in his home like nothing had happened. So by this point the

214
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:59,820
Persian is like, you know what, I have covered for this asshole for way too long, I don't

215
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,420
care what I owe him, I have paid my debt to his ass, I'm going to the police and I'm telling

216
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,180
them everything. And just as he's about to do that, knock knock, guess who's at the door,

217
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:15,420
it's Eric! And he plops down on the Persian chaise lounge and he's like, hey bud, um,

218
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:21,540
I'm sorry about all that, uh, I let her go, um, as far as I know she's going to elope

219
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:33,260
with Raoul, um, are we cool? And the Persian is like, dude what the fuck? When Christine

220
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,100
agrees to marry him, Eric in his infinite crazy assumes that she is totally playing

221
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,740
him and has every intention of killing herself rather than being his wife, because he is

222
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:47,580
just the worst. Which he is. But as in the musical, she kisses him and he realizes like,

223
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,540
holy shit, she's actually willing to go through with this. It is at this point that he concedes

224
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,260
to himself how horrible he's been and is so overcome with emotion that he lets her go,

225
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,540
gives her his blessing, and makes her promise that she'll come back and bury him once he

226
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,360
dies of all this love he's feeling, which given that we've still got some Victorian

227
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,220
vapors going on, should be in a couple weeks or so. Eric relates all this to the Persian,

228
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,520
who relates it to the narrator, LaRue. Eric presumably does die, Christine presumably

229
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,140
does come back to bury him, and the Persian dies an old man, safe and happy in his home

230
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:20,940
in Paris. The end. So with regard to the most famous Phantom adaptation, in terms of pure

231
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,980
plot utility, you probably recognize the character of the Persian in the character of Madame

232
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:38,060
Giry. She kind of floats around, warns people about stuff, and then when the time comes,

233
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:42,500
she's the one who shows Raoul how to get down to the lair and how to protect himself against

234
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:49,860
the Punjab lasso. Hell, in the film version, she's even involved in the tragic backstory

235
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:55,040
and helps him escape the thing, both traits from the Persian in the original novel. I'm

236
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,760
not saying Andrew Lloyd Webber is bad for replacing the Persian with a white woman.

237
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,480
He's bad for other reasons. But little known fact about Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom

238
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,400
of the Opera is that the original plan was not to write an original musical, but to produce

239
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,200
Ken Hill's 1976 adaptation of Phantom of the Opera, which Hughes extremely close to

240
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:22,880
LaRue's book and does feature the Persian as a major supporting character. In fairness,

241
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,200
this musical is just really genuinely terrible, and I can't say they made the wrong choice

242
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:41,680
by deciding to ghost on Ken Hill and then just writing their own. But it must needs

243
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,680
be remarked, but one of the major changes that they made from the Ken Hill musical,

244
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,960
itself the inspiration for the current Broadway behemoth, is that it cuts out the Persian.

245
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,080
The closest thing that could be considered a reference, either to the character or Eric's

246
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:06,880
time in Persia, is this here monkey, which… I mean I've seen this show like 400 times

247
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,680
and I still don't know what they were going for with the monkey. And this falls within

248
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:17,320
the trend of adaptations not only cutting the character out, but leaving in a replacement

249
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,200
role, basically conceding that some character performing the Persian's role in the story,

250
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,600
at least if you keep it as close to the original novel as Andrew Lloyd Webber did, is necessary

251
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,760
for the plot. As long as they're white. This began with the first big adaptation,

252
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,600
Karl Lamali's 1925 feature film The Phantom of the Opera starring Lon Chaney. The Persian

253
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:42,120
is in this movie, he's got his Astrakhan cap and everything, only he's not actually

254
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:48,120
here. This is not Persian at all, but a French white police inspector named Ledoux who's

255
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:55,560
pretending to be Persian for… reasons. And he's been tracking that phantom for months.

256
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:01,680
In disguise? And now he's found him, but instead of involving the police, for whom

257
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:09,360
he works, instead he just takes Raoul for some reason. You can probably guess why. Yep,

258
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,740
tale as old as film. The earlier cuts of the film originally hewed way closer to the novel.

259
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,880
That Astrakhan cap is there because in the original cut, Ledoux was the Persian. Even

260
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,640
his casting choice is somewhat telling. Ledoux's actor, Arthur ibn Karoo, was actually born

261
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,800
in Armenia and was a character actor known for playing shady foreigners, such that he

262
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,200
rarely got to play a good guy as he does in this movie. And it also had the novel's

263
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,040
ending, with Erik letting Christine go instead of being eaten alive by an angry mom. So they

264
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,360
shot it, and then they changed it, and the Persian was a secret white the whole time.

265
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:49,280
And that trend did not exist in a vacuum either. This follows Paramount's 1921 hit The Sheik,

266
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:56,280
starring Rudolph Valentino, in which Valentino Sheik is portrayed… differently. But it

267
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:02,840
being a romantic comedy and that the eponymous Sheik gets the girl in the end, don't worry.

268
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,640
We find out that he was actually a secret white the whole time, just like Esmeralda.

269
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:13,840
I should do a video about characters of color and media who were, like, revealed to be secretly

270
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,760
white the whole time. We can call it Dolezals.

271
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,080
Now this was before the Hays Code, so it wasn't yet mandated that the bad man must be punished

272
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,680
on screen, but the studio thought that should be the case because early audiences didn't

273
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,840
We cannot have the bad man, what does the murders, get a sympathetic, tragic ending.

274
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:40,640
And moreover, we cannot have an ethnic be both a central character and heroic. And live.

275
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,640
The 1943 version has not one, but two Raoul's who vie for Christine's affections.

276
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:59,240
One is a cop and the other likes to play detective, so they team up to rescue Christine. I mean,

277
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,760
they don't really have a history with the Phantom, but they kind of serve the purpose

278
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:08,040
of expediting the third act along to its conclusion. Also, this movie kind of owns because it ends

279
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,920
with Christine fucking off without either of them. Like, bye!

280
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:18,600
Then, yes, Phantom on Ice. The Phantom has, like, a whole chorus of acolytes slash groupies

281
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,920
that exist. I feel like we don't talk enough about the fact that there was, like, this

282
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,840
whole era of human history where Thing on Ice was so ubiquitous it was parodied in an

283
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,200
episode of Rugrats.

284
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:39,160
Reptar, you have come back to me. Yes, dear, indeed I have.

285
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:45,080
Speaking of the 90s, possibly the most early 90s Thing ever set to film, Phantom of the Mall,

286
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:51,160
yes, a real movie, wherein the Phantom Eric does not torturedly play the organ in his basement,

287
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:58,600
he torturedly lifts. He is not an angel of music, he is an angel of roundhouse kicks.

288
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:03,000
And in this version, our Persian is... it's Pauly Shore.

289
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I promise not to spit in your yogurt.

290
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,160
The 1990 movie starring Charles Dance, yes, that Charles Dance,

291
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,440
our Persian replacement is Eric's dad, played by Burt Lancaster, who hid him away as a baby

292
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:23,000
and raised him to be a... Phantom of the Opera that punches plastic deer.

293
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,840
Oh yeah, let's watch that again.

294
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:39,080
In 1998, Italian filmmaker Dario Argento directed his own adaptation and the sort of romantic

295
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:44,760
analogue between its Phantom and Persian replacement, and in this one the Phantom is a tortured

296
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:51,480
rapist who is not deformed and our Persian surrogate is a bunch of rats. Friendly friendly

297
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:58,680
rats. This, for the record, is the worst adaptation of Phantom. It's the worst one.

298
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,280
It's bad. But of course the most well-known replacement is Madame Giry in the Andrew Lloyd

299
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,920
Webber adaptation, who serves the purpose of filling in the Phantom's backstory after

300
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:15,240
seeing him on his world freak tour years prior. There was, I shall never forget him,

301
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:22,600
a man locked in a cage. But being too chicken shit to do anything else after ratting him out

302
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:29,640
to the gilded youth. He lives across the lake, monsieur. This is as far as I dare go. And all

303
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,640
of this is to say nothing about adaptations that change their source material so much that there

304
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:39,000
isn't really a Persian surrogate at all, like the 1962 Hammer horror film starring Herbert Lam,

305
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,840
or the only good Phantom of the Opera movie, Brian De Palma's 1974 film, Phantom of the Paradise.

306
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:50,920
I know drug reel from Real Real! Of course the Persian is not absent from 100% of adaptations,

307
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,960
even if he is absent from all of the ones you've ever heard of. There was a 1988 animated movie

308
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:01,880
that's one of those like classic literature for kids things from the 80s that had a budget of like

309
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:10,200
two. You can find the house by the river? Come. And he's also in the terrible 1991 musical that

310
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,520
was released on video and sold in all of the stores and poor fools kept buying it,

311
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:19,080
thinking it was the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical and then being horribly disappointed when they

312
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:25,400
got home. You may follow me into the darkness if you like, dar-o-ga. Because for the most part,

313
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,200
the trend with this character, despite being extremely well liked by fans, has been erasure,

314
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,240
because I guess we just don't know what to do with him. But when it's not erasure,

315
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:42,520
are you telling me the girl is transferable? Like the Grand Vizier's signet ring that whoever

316
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:49,000
takes one must take the other? I sighed. It is often the custom in such matters. Oh, I see.

317
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,520
He said contemptuously. Legalized rape is the done thing here, is it? Any man may force himself upon

318
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:59,640
a woman and say it is the custom. Well, then we circle back to Orientalism. This is all a prelude

319
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,960
to discuss what is debatably the most memorable take on the character outside of the original

320
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:11,560
novel, Susan Kay's Phantom and how much it bites hard. Look at this cover. Yeah, this is a reprint.

321
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:17,320
The original was much more like 90s romance novel. You try being the only girl in the Phantom forums

322
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:24,920
who hated this book in 2001. Anyway, I'm just explaining myself because a lot of Phantom fans

323
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,720
really like this book and it really changed a lot of the foundations of the fandom itself.

324
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:35,240
Most fans even call the Persian by the name Susan Kay gave him in the book, Nadir Khan. So Phantom

325
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:40,920
is basically a 600-page novel about the life of the Phantom, split into six different points of

326
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,400
view. Nadir is the point of view character for Eric's 20s, which he set squarely in Iran,

327
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:52,520
then Persia, starting in the year 1850. So let's take a look at Persia in 1850. Nasir al-Din Shah

328
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:58,280
was the actual real-life Shah, newly in his reign, and this book paints him as an ineffectual

329
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:06,760
bloodthirsty backwards tyrant. You know, Iran didn't have great luck with Shahs for the last

330
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:14,120
200-ish years of them. But on the real, Nasir al-Din Shah was a mixed personality whose reign is

331
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:20,040
marked by the constant Sturm and Drang about modernizing Persia by Western standards. And in

332
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:25,640
absolute fairness, the Shah of Persia at the time was what academic historians describe as a f***ing

333
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,440
weirdo. During research for this, we learned about a game he'd play with his wives and children

334
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,000
called Lights Out where he'd just like turn the lights off and everyone in the room would just

335
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:42,280
have to beat the shit out of each other in total darkness. Monarchs. But he didn't like jerk off

336
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:46,600
using the blood of virgins and assassinate half of his court as he does in this book. And this

337
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,320
is another way that the book really influenced the fandom, by playing into these ugly 19th century

338
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,880
orientalist tropes. We have to make Eric's backstory all harsh and tragic, and part of that

339
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:02,360
is painting Persia as this cutthroat awful place, with stuff like corruption and executions and

340
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:09,240
slavery. So much slavery. Which was nothing like the US in the 1850s. LaRue's original novel frames

341
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,960
Eric against a world that is horrible, that everywhere he went molded him into the nightmare

342
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:19,160
fuckboy he turned into. It is the same sort of like Ender's Game logic where it's like,

343
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:24,600
I know you have a kind and gentle heart, but you're just so good at murder. In a better world,

344
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:30,360
or hell, if he had just been normal looking, he would have been a respectable man. In fact,

345
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:35,080
that is how the original novel ends, LaRue lamenting how terrible the world is to disadvantaged

346
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,480
people, and positing that Eric could have been one of the world's great minds if the world wasn't

347
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:45,720
so shitty to people with disabilities. Which, for 1910, is a pretty nuanced take. Hell, for now it's

348
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,840
a nuanced take. Eric looked like a monster, so people treated him like one, and he behaved like

349
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:55,880
one in kind, but he was not born a monster. But while Susan Kay does not drop that angle,

350
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,560
the entire Persia sequence is framed as different from all of the other locations,

351
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:04,280
which are set in France and Italy. It was Persia that really made him into a monster,

352
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:09,080
because the culture is just that bad. So after all this, you might be asking yourself what the

353
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:13,400
point of this video was. Was it really just an elaborate excuse to talk about Phantom of the

354
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:19,480
Opera for half an hour and dump on this book? Yes. But while we're here, I don't mean to imply

355
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:25,000
that Gaston LaRue was intentionally trying to write the wokest book ever featuring a non-western

356
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,240
character. But I don't think it was unintentional that he went out of his way to place a Persian

357
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:34,040
character as basically the moral backbone of his story in a market that basically demanded white

358
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:39,640
heroes and relegated everybody else to stereotype, spectacle, or both. Fundamentally, Orientalist

359
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:45,240
media and the stereotypes it creates, even what we see as benign or even benevolent,

360
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,920
are a kind of erasure, a simplified refutation of the realities of a lot of people. But it is

361
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:55,800
erasure that serves a socio-political purpose as well. And I think it's interesting that with this

362
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:01,400
character, we effectively had nothing but erasure all the way up to the late 1980s. And once the

363
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:06,360
Persian was reintroduced back into Phantom fandom through Kay's novel, in a lot of ways it was a lot

364
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:11,320
more regressive than LaRue's original novel was, and fans were keen to embrace the more

365
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:16,920
Orientalist tropes, effectively replacing erasure with Orientalism. I was in those forums 20 years

366
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:21,960
ago too, and while I never liked this book, I can't say I did not uncritically enjoy some of

367
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,520
those Orientalist elements extracted both from the book and from the original novel. And Phantom of

368
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:31,800
the Opera is far, far from the only modern example where this is a thing. This isn't to say you're a

369
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:36,520
bad person if that angle appealed to you, but rather I would like to encourage you to critically

370
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:42,280
think about why that angle appealed to people. Why do so much of old western media be like that?

371
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:47,720
Why do so much of it still be like that? And recognize that there are some very real consequences

372
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:53,160
to Orientalism in media, even from ignorant racists painting sex slaves in the 19th century.

373
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,560
But I also wonder, could there be an adaptation of Phantom of the Opera that keeps the character

374
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:04,760
of the Persian and this idea of Eric living in Persia for a while as a part of his backstory

375
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:09,560
without incorporating those ugly Orientalist tropes? The world has changed a lot in the 110

376
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:14,280
years since Phantom of the Opera was published, but for all of its pulpiness and ham-fisted

377
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:19,480
Edwardian melodrama, it still keeps getting remade and re-enters the conversation. But the

378
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,560
consistent erasure of one of its main characters is a testament to how little the needle has nudged

379
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:28,200
in this one regard. And while we're here, part of the reason I kept putting off releasing this video

380
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:33,400
was because of escalating tension between the US and Iran, and given that this whole episode

381
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:40,200
concerns an Iranian character, I wasn't sure how or even if I should address that. And even now,

382
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,880
we still don't know what's going to happen or how this is going to play out, but I will say this.

383
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:51,800
In times of stress, there is a tendency to fall back on narratives that feel familiar. And if we

384
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:56,360
keep seeing narratives of a certain people being othered enough, eventually it makes sense to start

385
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:01,960
conflict with these people, even if there's no benefit to either side in doing so, save perhaps

386
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,920
the political. So I wonder if it is possible to challenge ourselves to evolve past these narratives

387
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:13,720
which have already caused so, so much harm. But again, maybe that's just human nature.

388
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,200
And with that, now I have to do my ad read. I of course was going to recommend some version of

389
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,360
Phantom of the Opera, but instead I'll recommend the book that I'm listening to right now,

390
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:29,640
which is Ronan Farrow's War on Peace, the end of diplomacy and the decline of American influence.

391

That was awkward.

401
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,800
Okie dokie, here's me reading some quotes about slavery.

402
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:31,240
Why risk offending the Shah for the sake of a girl who is only a slave? He gave a great cry of rage,

403
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,600
lifted the table in front of him, and threw it across the room with a force that splintered the

404
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:43,480
legs asunder from the marble top. Only a slave. Only an animal. You asinine Persian dolt,

405
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:51,080
he roared. Get out of my way quickly before I forget all that I owe you. I'm fed up with this

406
00:34:51,080 --> 00:35:01,080
world. I raised my shoulders helplessly. The Shah's sister is his personal property to be

407
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:06,520
disposed of as he sees fit. Eric looked at me incredulously. Are you telling me the girl

408
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:11,640
is transferable? Well, the grand vizier's signet ring. Whoever takes one must take the other.

409
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:18,920
I sighed. It is often the custom in such matters. Oh, I see. Legalized rape is just

410
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:24,600
a done thing here, is it? He said contemptuously. Any man may force himself in and say it's the

411
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:30,600
custom. My God, what country? And he turned away with such fierce disgust that I felt

412
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,600
faintly ashamed of my own race.
