0	9400	Eric, why did you send her away? You desired her and she was yours to use exactly as you
9400	14520	pleased. Why risk offending the Shah for the sake of a girl who was only a slave? He gave
14520	18680	a great cry of rage, lifted the table in front of him, and threw it across the room with
18680	22240	a force that splintered the legs asunder from the marble top.
22240	25880	Only a slave! Only an animal!
25880	26880	He roared.
26880	35020	You asinine Persian dolt! Get out of my way! Quickly! Before I forget all that I owe you!
35020	38080	Is this another of your quaint and delightful customs?
38080	39640	He demanded furiously.
39640	43840	Has no one in this godforsaken court heard of a decent period of mourning?
43840	45740	I raised my shoulders helplessly.
45740	50760	The Shah's sister is his personal property to be disposed of as he sees fit. Eric looked
50760	51760	at me incredulously.
52280	58960	Are you telling me the girl is transferrable? Like the Grand Vizier's signet ring that
58960	61280	whoever takes one must take the other?
61280	64200	I sighed. It is often the custom in such matters.
64200	65960	Oh, I see.
65960	67440	He said contemptuously.
67440	71600	Legalized rape is the done thing here, is it? Any man may force himself upon a woman
71600	75500	and say it is the custom. My god, what a country!
75500	80280	And he turned away with such fierce disgust that I felt faintly ashamed of my own race.
80280	85440	She is poor and has children to feed. I am able to pay the price, she asks, without hardship.
85440	88880	Why should I stand here and haggle with her like a miser?
88880	93680	She expects it, Eric. I tell you, it is the custom.
93680	97280	Fuck. Your. Customs.
105280	108680	There is something intrinsic in human nature that when someone says,
108880	114240	This thing belongs to us, not you, and no, you can't have it, the excluded group loses
114240	120200	their shit, whether they actually would have wanted the thing or not. Like, I didn't want
120200	124720	to go to Shelley's birthday party. I don't even like Shelley, but I find out that I'm
124720	125720	not invited.
125720	128680	Oh. That bitch.
128680	133440	This attitude dominates discussions of cultural appropriation in particular, where one group
133440	137920	says, no, this thing belongs to us and actually has deep cultural and religious significance
137920	143200	that you clearly do not understand, nor do you care to, so maybe don't wear a featherhead
143200	147540	dress as part of your lingerie line. Like, maybe the excluded group has zero interest
147540	151540	in wearing a featherhead dress with a lingerie line, but they're kind of offended at the
151540	154160	idea that someone said you can't.
154160	159880	Why can't I do sexy featherhead dress? I didn't steal your land or violate countless treaties
159880	165120	or give you diseases to which you had no natural immunity. I personally was not there. And
165120	169120	no, I wasn't going to wear a sexy feather headdress, but I should be able to without
169120	172400	being called problematic.
172400	176600	But this attitude is nothing new. Let us go back to the mid-19th century, when travel
176600	182800	writing was all the rage and there was particular interest in the Orient. And I don't mean that
182800	187400	Orient, although that was certainly also a thing, but in this case, Egypt, the Ottoman
187400	189800	Empire, and Persia.
189800	193440	It is from male European travelers to the Ottoman Empire that Europe was introduced
193440	199600	to the idea of the harem, but only the idea, because men weren't allowed into harems.
199600	203640	See? That's kind of the whole point. Only women and male relatives are allowed into
203640	206240	harems. Them's the rules.
206240	211020	And of course, our 19th century Eurotrash did not like that. Why won't you let me into
211020	216280	your club filled with slave ladies wearing those sexy belly dancer outfits and those
216280	222760	finger symbol thingies and those badass eunuchs with their sabres? Why can I not have the
222760	223760	ring?
223760	227960	And with this desire to be included in a space in which they were not allowed, their presumptions
227960	232320	about the culture they were visiting combined with this forbidden space made their imaginations
232320	233600	run wild.
233600	239240	If we aren't allowed in there, it must be because it's sexy. Licentious. It must be
239240	245320	full of these sexy slave babes who don't really want it, but also kinda want it.
245320	249840	These are some early mainstream European examples of what Columbia University professor of literature
249840	256280	Edward Said defined as Orientalism in his 1978 book, Orientalism.
256280	260760	European depictions of the Middle East date as far back as the medieval period. The Crusades.
260760	261920	A thing that happened.
261920	266320	But the rise of what we'll call Orientalist media really begins in the 18th century, as
266320	271580	major European world powers go into war with the Ottoman Empire. Operas like Mozart's Abduction
271580	277300	from the Seraglio, travelogues like Lady Elizabeth Craven's A Journey Through Crimea to Constantinople,
277300	282660	and Lord Byron's poetry-slash-personal antics were all popular proliferators of this concept
282660	284020	of the Eastern Other.
284020	288680	But where 19th century Orientalism really took off in the visual and language arts coincided
288680	292860	with Napoleon's failed attempts to invade Syria and Egypt, and the British Empire's
292860	297420	efforts to destabilize the Ottoman Empire at the beginning of the 19th century. As both
297420	302480	world powers sought to colonize these areas, demand back home created an explosion of art
302480	307100	centered around the Middle East and Central Asia, often by artists who had never actually
307100	312140	been to said territories, but you know, they had like a friend who knew someone whose cousin
312140	316140	had done like one of those Nile cruises. And as a result, we got art that looks something
316140	317220	like this.
317220	333060	slave babes
333060	338580	But for your average Jack and Jacques back in Mother's England and France, this emerging
338580	343960	visual culture dominated perceptions of these countries. No, paintings like this were not
343960	350240	based in reality. Yikes. But Victorian Europeans thought that they were. It's like if aliens
350240	355120	tried to make art depicting what being an American in 2019 is like, but only having
355120	359760	like Nickelback as a reference. But you know, they've never actually seen Nickelback. They've
359760	364320	only like heard about them second or third hand and maybe they've seen like the photograph
364320	370840	meme.
371480	376200	Eventually, travel writing by European women became a thing and tried to clear up this
376200	380260	incorrect assessment of what harem life was like because being women, they were allowed
380260	385000	into harems. Turns out harem life is actually pretty boring. And no, they don't dress like
385000	390180	that. And no, that's not what an odalisque is, Susan K. I'm not saying it was a good
390180	395180	social order. I'm just saying it was nothing like the sexy licentious slave babes that
395180	399760	these dudes imagined it to be. But the damage was done. And to this day, when you hear the
399760	405840	word harem in the oxidant, it conjures up a very specific, very 19th century image.
405840	413720	Sexualized, licentious, appropriative, and above all, inaccurate. But who cares? It's
413720	420080	just media. It's just writing. It's just a painting. It doesn't have any real world consequences.
420080	424860	And besides, they do it to us too. Watch any movie designed for non-American audiences
424860	436120	that features an American character and it's like, oh. So that's what that's like.
436120	440160	And of course that is true, but it is completely disingenuous to say that orientalist depictions
440160	446620	of the middle east had no real world consequences in terms of real world politics. Categorically,
446620	452300	it did. Just within the last year, German far right and totally not neo-nazi group AFD,
452300	457700	anglicized as Alternative for Germany, used one of the more notorious orientalist paintings,
457700	463080	Jean-Leon Jerome's The Slave Market, as part of a propaganda campaign against Syrian refugees
463080	467380	being allowed entry into Germany. But other less overt examples pervade mainstream media
467380	478280	as well. 300 is hilarious, but kind of also an insidious depiction of a war between the
478280	486160	east and the west. And more recently we have the post 9-11 gritty realism trend of films
486160	491200	set in the middle east, but we're not getting into that today. So we gotta colonize the
491200	496560	motherfuckers I guess. This is the rationale behind colonization in general. Like, yeah
496560	501240	sure we want their stuff, but really we're doing them a favor by colonizing them. I mean
501240	506760	look at them. It's for their own good. Y'all need Jesus. And they've got this crescent
506760	511480	moon. That's not a cross. And they've got this club they won't let us into and I don't
511480	518600	like it. And while neither Egypt, the Ottoman Empire, nor Persia were ever technically colonies,
518600	524560	some of their stuff was. And their historical trajectories were all deeply impacted by the
524560	531240	effects of colonialism, the consequences of which haunt us to this day. Now I know what
531240	534960	you're thinking. We're like 10 minutes into this video and you're like, this is not what
534960	539920	I was promised by the thumbnail. I was promised 80s melodramatic rock opera, and I'm getting
539920	544520	to that. But the backdrop of Orientalism is important to this discussion. If you've never
544520	548920	read Gaston Leroux's 1910 novel, The Phantom of the Opera, you probably don't know where
548920	553040	I'm going with this. But if you have read it, you totally know where I'm going with
553040	558320	this. Enter the Persian, one of the main characters in Gaston Leroux's Phantom of the Opera, a
558320	562040	fan favorite, a character so central to the narrative that basically the entire second
562040	566440	half is told from his point of view, and a character that is either whitewashed, altered,
566440	572040	or omitted entirely from the vast majority of the hundreds of adaptations of Phantom
572040	588880	of the Opera. Like, nearly all of them. Like, at least 95%. Hmmmm. And on the rare occasion
588880	590960	when he's not cut out, we get
590960	594460	You asinine Persian dolt.
594460	600160	The one well-known-ish adaptation, or in this case, retelling, that does feature the Persian
600160	606640	in any role of prominence is Susan Kaye's 1990 novel titled only Phantom, which falls
606640	612280	squarely into the worst flavors of 1980s Ayatollah, Asahollah, anti-Iranian sentiment combined
612280	616040	with good old fashioned 19th century Orientalism, which
616040	620320	Legalized rape is the done thing here, is it? Any man may force himself upon a woman
620320	622000	and say it is the custom.
622000	625760	This book is also extremely popular with a fandom. And incidentally is not available
625760	629680	on audible. And there was a time when Phantom fandom had no goddamn sense of humor and you
629680	634460	were not allowed to criticize this book. But it's 2020, Phantom shitposting is finally
634460	638280	a thing, and I am the god. But we'll get to that book.
638280	643680	First, let's take a look at the source material. Who is this Persian? What is his function
643680	648520	within the novel? And why is he omitted from nearly every single one of the shit million
648520	655360	adaptations of Phantom of the Opera?
655360	661280	Gaston Leroux's novel isn't all that dissimilar from either the 1925 Lon Chaney movie or Andrew
661280	672120	Lloyd Webber's musical or even its terrible film adaptation directed by Joel Schumacher.
672120	676680	The key difference is the novel was originally published in serial form and framed more as
676680	681400	a mystery instead of a tragic romance with new increments of the story introduced each
681400	688040	week. Who is doing the bad thing? Could it be the manager? Could it be the rat catcher?
688040	693240	Could it be the Vicomte de Chagny's older brother Philippe? Could it be this shady ethnic
693240	697460	in the Astrakhan cap that's always running around the opera? Or could it be the skull
697460	701120	faced incel who lives in the basement? Who's to say?
701120	705440	I'm going to summarize the original novel, and yes, it does spoil the whole thing, so
705440	710960	spoilers for Phantom of the Opera.
710960	715520	Our story begins when the prima donna Larcolada falls ill, and is replaced by this young ingenue
715520	719360	no one's ever heard of named Christine Daae, and she brings the house down with how amazing
719360	724040	she is. During her performance, she is recognized by her childhood friend, the fuckboy Vicomte
724040	728280	Raoul de Chagny, and he goes to her dressing room to say, hey, good job, but he overhears
728280	732440	her talking to this guy who claims to be her voice teacher, and being a fuckboy, he's
732440	735320	like, oh, slut.
735320	738880	In the meanwhile, there's all these mysterious goings on. Someone calling themselves the
738880	742520	opera ghost is extorting the new managers, some guy turns up dead with the news around
742520	746480	his neck, there's this shady brown fellow poking around the opera all the time, and
746480	752120	amidst it all, Christine just disappears. And of course the fuckboy is like, slut.
752120	755160	Couple weeks later, there's a masquerade, and hey, she's back, and she pulls Raoul
755160	759400	aside and tells him where she's been, and of course the victim-blaming fuckboy is like,
759400	763160	slut. And she's like, no, what do I have to explain to you? That I was kidnapped by a
763160	768200	skull-faced incel named Eric, who, well, admittedly, he told me he'd let me go as long as I didn't
768200	773560	ever touch his mask, and you remember that thing I said earlier about human nature, where
773560	778240	someone says, you can't have the thing, or you can't see the thing, and under normal
778240	782160	circumstances, you wouldn't have really cared, but, you know, someone said you can't, like,
782160	785680	see, anyway, she took off his mask, he loses his shit, and he says, you can never leave
785680	792160	my lair, and she's like, no, you look great. Basically, she pulls that act off long enough
792160	795640	for Eric to let her out of the basement so she can tell the victim-blaming fuckboy, oh
795640	800900	please, God help me, and he's like, okay, how about we leave together after your next
800900	805920	big performance? So after the next big performance, Christine just disappears right off the stage,
805920	808920	like right in the middle of the stage. And if we're watching the musical, this would
808920	813760	be the track down this murderer portion that leads into the final lair scene, but we're
813760	818200	only about halfway through the book. Enter the Persian. He's never given a name because
818200	822600	the framing device is LaRue telling the story like he's a journalist presenting it almost
822600	827320	like found footage, like it really happened, and since in-universe the Persian isn't on
827320	832720	great terms with, you know, the Shah, he's trying to protect this guy's identity. In
832720	837400	terms of Gilded Age literature, at which LaRue's original novel falls right at the tail end,
837400	842520	the Persian is an interesting character because, in most regards, he does not fall within late
842520	847880	Victorian orientalist tropes. Like, the tragic backstory stuff totally does. When the narrative
847880	852280	goes back to Eric's time in Persia when they first got to know each other, it definitely
852280	857440	does the, ooh those exotic Orients, they love their bloodsport, the royals watch murder
857440	863420	just for fun, just like the Romans, so barbaric. See, Eric moved to Persia to be like a circus
863420	868140	performer slash architect, and while he was here, he made all this amazing architecture
868140	872760	for the Shah. This was also where he learned to do murder real good. That's the Punjab
872760	878140	lasso that is very clumsily handled in the musical and even more clumsily in the film
878140	883740	somehow. It's a sneaky foreign way to kill. He Insta-garots you and you never see it coming,
883740	887700	and the Shah loved watching Eric do this. He thought it was great. Well, anyway, the
887700	891700	Shah liked Eric, but Eric knew too much, so he has to die, I guess, and the Persian, who
891700	896160	has a soft spot for Eric, helped him escape and basically covered for him. The Shah suspected
896160	899820	the Persian did this, but lacking proof, and since the Persian is like his fifth cousin
899820	903500	or something, banished him from court instead of killing him, and he also gave him a nice
903500	907340	pension. And so, in his new life in Paris, the Persian basically spends all his time
907340	911620	keeping an eye on Eric and making sure he didn't do too many murders, and Eric pays
911620	917180	him back by not murdering him when he happens to venture too close to his underground lair.
917180	921820	So LaRue's depiction of Persia in the 1850s, when Eric and the Persian met, fell right
921820	927460	into that orientalist trope of barbaric, exotic, and feminine orient. But the character himself
927460	932540	is kind of ahead of his time in that, in a narrative that centers mostly white people,
932540	937980	he has a character at all. He isn't exoticized, except insofar as everyone thinks he's kinda
937980	943740	shady before they get to know him, he isn't barbaric, he doesn't shroud himself in mysticism,
943740	947540	and his otherness is not at all used to set him apart from the rest of the characters.
947540	953160	He is arguably the most well-rounded character in the book, and easily the most likable.
953160	956900	And he doesn't die!
956900	960260	So basically Raoul goes into the basement to rescue Christine, but gets circumvented
960260	964420	by the Persian, who's like, hey dude, you are going to die in like half a second if
964420	969700	I don't help you. Raoul, understandably suspicious, is like, who are you, how do you know all
969700	972980	this, and the Persian is like, look, Eric and I basically went to college together,
972980	976700	he did me a solid and I did him a solid, but I also got booted out of Persia BECAUSE
976700	980460	of this asshole, so now I'm wasting my golden years cleaning up his messes. They make it
980460	984260	all the way down to Eric's house by the lake under the opera, but then oops, accidentally
984260	991740	end up in the torture chamber he has in his house. For, um, some reason. So that's okay,
991740	995220	sure. Eric doesn't even notice that they're there at first, because he's too busy Christine
995220	999420	an ultimatum that she either has to marry him or he's going to blow up the opera house.
999420	1003140	She finds out the Persian and Raoul are in there, and in short order Eric does too, and
1003140	1008380	he turns the torture chamber on. It's basically a sauna. Eventually Christine is like, okay
1008380	1013180	okay I'll marry you, just please let these guys go, and Eric is like, okay, and he does,
1013180	1016260	and the Persian wakes up in his home like nothing had happened. So by this point the
1016260	1019820	Persian is like, you know what, I have covered for this asshole for way too long, I don't
1019820	1023420	care what I owe him, I have paid my debt to his ass, I'm going to the police and I'm telling
1023420	1027180	them everything. And just as he's about to do that, knock knock, guess who's at the door,
1027180	1035420	it's Eric! And he plops down on the Persian chaise lounge and he's like, hey bud, um,
1035420	1041540	I'm sorry about all that, uh, I let her go, um, as far as I know she's going to elope
1041540	1053260	with Raoul, um, are we cool? And the Persian is like, dude what the fuck? When Christine
1053260	1057100	agrees to marry him, Eric in his infinite crazy assumes that she is totally playing
1057100	1060740	him and has every intention of killing herself rather than being his wife, because he is
1060740	1067580	just the worst. Which he is. But as in the musical, she kisses him and he realizes like,
1067580	1071540	holy shit, she's actually willing to go through with this. It is at this point that he concedes
1071540	1075260	to himself how horrible he's been and is so overcome with emotion that he lets her go,
1075260	1078540	gives her his blessing, and makes her promise that she'll come back and bury him once he
1078540	1082360	dies of all this love he's feeling, which given that we've still got some Victorian
1082360	1086220	vapors going on, should be in a couple weeks or so. Eric relates all this to the Persian,
1086220	1090520	who relates it to the narrator, LaRue. Eric presumably does die, Christine presumably
1090520	1094140	does come back to bury him, and the Persian dies an old man, safe and happy in his home
1094140	1100940	in Paris. The end. So with regard to the most famous Phantom adaptation, in terms of pure
1100940	1105980	plot utility, you probably recognize the character of the Persian in the character of Madame
1105980	1118060	Giry. She kind of floats around, warns people about stuff, and then when the time comes,
1118060	1122500	she's the one who shows Raoul how to get down to the lair and how to protect himself against
1122500	1129860	the Punjab lasso. Hell, in the film version, she's even involved in the tragic backstory
1129860	1135040	and helps him escape the thing, both traits from the Persian in the original novel. I'm
1135040	1139760	not saying Andrew Lloyd Webber is bad for replacing the Persian with a white woman.
1139760	1144480	He's bad for other reasons. But little known fact about Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom
1144480	1149400	of the Opera is that the original plan was not to write an original musical, but to produce
1149400	1154200	Ken Hill's 1976 adaptation of Phantom of the Opera, which Hughes extremely close to
1154200	1162880	LaRue's book and does feature the Persian as a major supporting character. In fairness,
1162880	1167200	this musical is just really genuinely terrible, and I can't say they made the wrong choice
1167200	1181680	by deciding to ghost on Ken Hill and then just writing their own. But it must needs
1181680	1185680	be remarked, but one of the major changes that they made from the Ken Hill musical,
1185680	1190960	itself the inspiration for the current Broadway behemoth, is that it cuts out the Persian.
1190960	1195080	The closest thing that could be considered a reference, either to the character or Eric's
1195080	1206880	time in Persia, is this here monkey, which… I mean I've seen this show like 400 times
1206880	1212680	and I still don't know what they were going for with the monkey. And this falls within
1212680	1217320	the trend of adaptations not only cutting the character out, but leaving in a replacement
1217320	1222200	role, basically conceding that some character performing the Persian's role in the story,
1222200	1226600	at least if you keep it as close to the original novel as Andrew Lloyd Webber did, is necessary
1226600	1231760	for the plot. As long as they're white. This began with the first big adaptation,
1231760	1236600	Karl Lamali's 1925 feature film The Phantom of the Opera starring Lon Chaney. The Persian
1236600	1242120	is in this movie, he's got his Astrakhan cap and everything, only he's not actually
1242120	1248120	here. This is not Persian at all, but a French white police inspector named Ledoux who's
1248120	1255560	pretending to be Persian for… reasons. And he's been tracking that phantom for months.
1255560	1261680	In disguise? And now he's found him, but instead of involving the police, for whom
1261680	1269360	he works, instead he just takes Raoul for some reason. You can probably guess why. Yep,
1269400	1274740	tale as old as film. The earlier cuts of the film originally hewed way closer to the novel.
1274740	1279880	That Astrakhan cap is there because in the original cut, Ledoux was the Persian. Even
1279880	1284640	his casting choice is somewhat telling. Ledoux's actor, Arthur ibn Karoo, was actually born
1284640	1288800	in Armenia and was a character actor known for playing shady foreigners, such that he
1288800	1293200	rarely got to play a good guy as he does in this movie. And it also had the novel's
1293200	1298040	ending, with Erik letting Christine go instead of being eaten alive by an angry mom. So they
1298080	1303360	shot it, and then they changed it, and the Persian was a secret white the whole time.
1303360	1309280	And that trend did not exist in a vacuum either. This follows Paramount's 1921 hit The Sheik,
1309280	1316280	starring Rudolph Valentino, in which Valentino Sheik is portrayed… differently. But it
1316280	1322840	being a romantic comedy and that the eponymous Sheik gets the girl in the end, don't worry.
1322840	1327640	We find out that he was actually a secret white the whole time, just like Esmeralda.
1327640	1333840	I should do a video about characters of color and media who were, like, revealed to be secretly
1333840	1338760	white the whole time. We can call it Dolezals.
1338760	1343080	Now this was before the Hays Code, so it wasn't yet mandated that the bad man must be punished
1343080	1347680	on screen, but the studio thought that should be the case because early audiences didn't
1348680	1353840	We cannot have the bad man, what does the murders, get a sympathetic, tragic ending.
1353840	1360640	And moreover, we cannot have an ethnic be both a central character and heroic. And live.
1360640	1365640	The 1943 version has not one, but two Raoul's who vie for Christine's affections.
1365640	1379240	One is a cop and the other likes to play detective, so they team up to rescue Christine. I mean,
1379240	1382760	they don't really have a history with the Phantom, but they kind of serve the purpose
1382760	1388040	of expediting the third act along to its conclusion. Also, this movie kind of owns because it ends
1388040	1392920	with Christine fucking off without either of them. Like, bye!
1392920	1398600	Then, yes, Phantom on Ice. The Phantom has, like, a whole chorus of acolytes slash groupies
1398600	1403920	that exist. I feel like we don't talk enough about the fact that there was, like, this
1403920	1408840	whole era of human history where Thing on Ice was so ubiquitous it was parodied in an
1408840	1410200	episode of Rugrats.
1410200	1419160	Reptar, you have come back to me. Yes, dear, indeed I have.
1419160	1425080	Speaking of the 90s, possibly the most early 90s Thing ever set to film, Phantom of the Mall,
1425080	1431160	yes, a real movie, wherein the Phantom Eric does not torturedly play the organ in his basement,
1431160	1438600	he torturedly lifts. He is not an angel of music, he is an angel of roundhouse kicks.
1438600	1443000	And in this version, our Persian is... it's Pauly Shore.
1443000	1445000	I promise not to spit in your yogurt.
1445000	1449160	The 1990 movie starring Charles Dance, yes, that Charles Dance,
1451000	1456440	our Persian replacement is Eric's dad, played by Burt Lancaster, who hid him away as a baby
1456440	1463000	and raised him to be a... Phantom of the Opera that punches plastic deer.
1465560	1466840	Oh yeah, let's watch that again.
1468600	1479080	In 1998, Italian filmmaker Dario Argento directed his own adaptation and the sort of romantic
1479080	1484760	analogue between its Phantom and Persian replacement, and in this one the Phantom is a tortured
1484760	1491480	rapist who is not deformed and our Persian surrogate is a bunch of rats. Friendly friendly
1491480	1498680	rats. This, for the record, is the worst adaptation of Phantom. It's the worst one.
1499880	1504280	It's bad. But of course the most well-known replacement is Madame Giry in the Andrew Lloyd
1504280	1508920	Webber adaptation, who serves the purpose of filling in the Phantom's backstory after
1508920	1515240	seeing him on his world freak tour years prior. There was, I shall never forget him,
1515560	1522600	a man locked in a cage. But being too chicken shit to do anything else after ratting him out
1522600	1529640	to the gilded youth. He lives across the lake, monsieur. This is as far as I dare go. And all
1529640	1533640	of this is to say nothing about adaptations that change their source material so much that there
1533640	1539000	isn't really a Persian surrogate at all, like the 1962 Hammer horror film starring Herbert Lam,
1539000	1544840	or the only good Phantom of the Opera movie, Brian De Palma's 1974 film, Phantom of the Paradise.
1544840	1550920	I know drug reel from Real Real! Of course the Persian is not absent from 100% of adaptations,
1550920	1555960	even if he is absent from all of the ones you've ever heard of. There was a 1988 animated movie
1555960	1561880	that's one of those like classic literature for kids things from the 80s that had a budget of like
1562600	1570200	two. You can find the house by the river? Come. And he's also in the terrible 1991 musical that
1570200	1574520	was released on video and sold in all of the stores and poor fools kept buying it,
1574520	1579080	thinking it was the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical and then being horribly disappointed when they
1579080	1585400	got home. You may follow me into the darkness if you like, dar-o-ga. Because for the most part,
1585400	1590200	the trend with this character, despite being extremely well liked by fans, has been erasure,
1590200	1595240	because I guess we just don't know what to do with him. But when it's not erasure,
1595240	1602520	are you telling me the girl is transferable? Like the Grand Vizier's signet ring that whoever
1602520	1609000	takes one must take the other? I sighed. It is often the custom in such matters. Oh, I see.
1609000	1614520	He said contemptuously. Legalized rape is the done thing here, is it? Any man may force himself upon
1614520	1619640	a woman and say it is the custom. Well, then we circle back to Orientalism. This is all a prelude
1619640	1623960	to discuss what is debatably the most memorable take on the character outside of the original
1623960	1631560	novel, Susan Kay's Phantom and how much it bites hard. Look at this cover. Yeah, this is a reprint.
1631560	1637320	The original was much more like 90s romance novel. You try being the only girl in the Phantom forums
1637320	1644920	who hated this book in 2001. Anyway, I'm just explaining myself because a lot of Phantom fans
1644920	1649720	really like this book and it really changed a lot of the foundations of the fandom itself.
1649720	1655240	Most fans even call the Persian by the name Susan Kay gave him in the book, Nadir Khan. So Phantom
1655240	1660920	is basically a 600-page novel about the life of the Phantom, split into six different points of
1660920	1665400	view. Nadir is the point of view character for Eric's 20s, which he set squarely in Iran,
1665400	1672520	then Persia, starting in the year 1850. So let's take a look at Persia in 1850. Nasir al-Din Shah
1672520	1678280	was the actual real-life Shah, newly in his reign, and this book paints him as an ineffectual
1678280	1686760	bloodthirsty backwards tyrant. You know, Iran didn't have great luck with Shahs for the last
1686760	1694120	200-ish years of them. But on the real, Nasir al-Din Shah was a mixed personality whose reign is
1694120	1700040	marked by the constant Sturm and Drang about modernizing Persia by Western standards. And in
1700040	1705640	absolute fairness, the Shah of Persia at the time was what academic historians describe as a f***ing
1705640	1710440	weirdo. During research for this, we learned about a game he'd play with his wives and children
1710440	1715000	called Lights Out where he'd just like turn the lights off and everyone in the room would just
1715000	1722280	have to beat the shit out of each other in total darkness. Monarchs. But he didn't like jerk off
1722280	1726600	using the blood of virgins and assassinate half of his court as he does in this book. And this
1726600	1731320	is another way that the book really influenced the fandom, by playing into these ugly 19th century
1731400	1735880	orientalist tropes. We have to make Eric's backstory all harsh and tragic, and part of that
1735880	1742360	is painting Persia as this cutthroat awful place, with stuff like corruption and executions and
1742360	1749240	slavery. So much slavery. Which was nothing like the US in the 1850s. LaRue's original novel frames
1749240	1753960	Eric against a world that is horrible, that everywhere he went molded him into the nightmare
1753960	1759160	fuckboy he turned into. It is the same sort of like Ender's Game logic where it's like,
1759160	1764600	I know you have a kind and gentle heart, but you're just so good at murder. In a better world,
1764600	1770360	or hell, if he had just been normal looking, he would have been a respectable man. In fact,
1770360	1775080	that is how the original novel ends, LaRue lamenting how terrible the world is to disadvantaged
1775080	1779480	people, and positing that Eric could have been one of the world's great minds if the world wasn't
1779480	1785720	so shitty to people with disabilities. Which, for 1910, is a pretty nuanced take. Hell, for now it's
1785720	1790840	a nuanced take. Eric looked like a monster, so people treated him like one, and he behaved like
1790840	1795880	one in kind, but he was not born a monster. But while Susan Kay does not drop that angle,
1795880	1799560	the entire Persia sequence is framed as different from all of the other locations,
1799560	1804280	which are set in France and Italy. It was Persia that really made him into a monster,
1804280	1809080	because the culture is just that bad. So after all this, you might be asking yourself what the
1809080	1813400	point of this video was. Was it really just an elaborate excuse to talk about Phantom of the
1813400	1819480	Opera for half an hour and dump on this book? Yes. But while we're here, I don't mean to imply
1819480	1825000	that Gaston LaRue was intentionally trying to write the wokest book ever featuring a non-western
1825000	1829240	character. But I don't think it was unintentional that he went out of his way to place a Persian
1829240	1834040	character as basically the moral backbone of his story in a market that basically demanded white
1834040	1839640	heroes and relegated everybody else to stereotype, spectacle, or both. Fundamentally, Orientalist
1839640	1845240	media and the stereotypes it creates, even what we see as benign or even benevolent,
1845240	1850920	are a kind of erasure, a simplified refutation of the realities of a lot of people. But it is
1850920	1855800	erasure that serves a socio-political purpose as well. And I think it's interesting that with this
1855800	1861400	character, we effectively had nothing but erasure all the way up to the late 1980s. And once the
1861400	1866360	Persian was reintroduced back into Phantom fandom through Kay's novel, in a lot of ways it was a lot
1866360	1871320	more regressive than LaRue's original novel was, and fans were keen to embrace the more
1871320	1876920	Orientalist tropes, effectively replacing erasure with Orientalism. I was in those forums 20 years
1876920	1881960	ago too, and while I never liked this book, I can't say I did not uncritically enjoy some of
1881960	1886520	those Orientalist elements extracted both from the book and from the original novel. And Phantom of
1886520	1891800	the Opera is far, far from the only modern example where this is a thing. This isn't to say you're a
1891800	1896520	bad person if that angle appealed to you, but rather I would like to encourage you to critically
1896520	1902280	think about why that angle appealed to people. Why do so much of old western media be like that?
1902280	1907720	Why do so much of it still be like that? And recognize that there are some very real consequences
1907720	1913160	to Orientalism in media, even from ignorant racists painting sex slaves in the 19th century.
1915480	1919560	But I also wonder, could there be an adaptation of Phantom of the Opera that keeps the character
1919560	1924760	of the Persian and this idea of Eric living in Persia for a while as a part of his backstory
1924760	1929560	without incorporating those ugly Orientalist tropes? The world has changed a lot in the 110
1929560	1934280	years since Phantom of the Opera was published, but for all of its pulpiness and ham-fisted
1934280	1939480	Edwardian melodrama, it still keeps getting remade and re-enters the conversation. But the
1939480	1943560	consistent erasure of one of its main characters is a testament to how little the needle has nudged
1943560	1948200	in this one regard. And while we're here, part of the reason I kept putting off releasing this video
1948280	1953400	was because of escalating tension between the US and Iran, and given that this whole episode
1953400	1960200	concerns an Iranian character, I wasn't sure how or even if I should address that. And even now,
1960200	1965880	we still don't know what's going to happen or how this is going to play out, but I will say this.
1965880	1971800	In times of stress, there is a tendency to fall back on narratives that feel familiar. And if we
1971800	1976360	keep seeing narratives of a certain people being othered enough, eventually it makes sense to start
1976360	1981960	conflict with these people, even if there's no benefit to either side in doing so, save perhaps
1981960	1986920	the political. So I wonder if it is possible to challenge ourselves to evolve past these narratives
1986920	1993720	which have already caused so, so much harm. But again, maybe that's just human nature.
1995480	2000200	And with that, now I have to do my ad read. I of course was going to recommend some version of
2000200	2004360	Phantom of the Opera, but instead I'll recommend the book that I'm listening to right now,
2004360	2009640	which is Ronan Farrow's War on Peace, the end of diplomacy and the decline of American influence.

2056520	2057320	That was awkward.
2060200	2063800	Okie dokie, here's me reading some quotes about slavery.
2064760	2071240	Why risk offending the Shah for the sake of a girl who is only a slave? He gave a great cry of rage,
2071240	2074600	lifted the table in front of him, and threw it across the room with a force that splintered the
2074600	2083480	legs asunder from the marble top. Only a slave. Only an animal. You asinine Persian dolt,
2083480	2091080	he roared. Get out of my way quickly before I forget all that I owe you. I'm fed up with this
2091080	2101080	world. I raised my shoulders helplessly. The Shah's sister is his personal property to be
2101080	2106520	disposed of as he sees fit. Eric looked at me incredulously. Are you telling me the girl
2106520	2111640	is transferable? Well, the grand vizier's signet ring. Whoever takes one must take the other.
2112280	2118920	I sighed. It is often the custom in such matters. Oh, I see. Legalized rape is just
2118920	2124600	a done thing here, is it? He said contemptuously. Any man may force himself in and say it's the
2124600	2130600	custom. My God, what country? And he turned away with such fierce disgust that I felt
2130600	2132600	faintly ashamed of my own race.
