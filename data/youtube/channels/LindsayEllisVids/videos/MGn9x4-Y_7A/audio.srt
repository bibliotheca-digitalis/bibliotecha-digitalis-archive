1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,360
So, I hear you might be thinking about killing the author.

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,040
It's an exciting time in any person's life when they're deciding which literary theory

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:21,320
to apply to the way they read texts, but it's important to know what you're getting into,

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,280
and make sure that this literary theory is the right one for you.

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,000
What is it about death of the author that appeals to you, the reader?

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,440
Before you start applying literary theories, you want to make sure that you're doing it

7
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,080
for the right reasons.

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,120
There are an awful lot of young people out there who rush into death of the author without

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,800
really understanding its intended purpose.

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,920
Are you trying to enhance your understanding of a text by secluding yourself from authorial

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,480
intent or a body of work?

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,880
Or are you trying to excuse yourself from potential guilt when you find out that your

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:55,060
favorite author might be a shitbag, and you don't want to examine what that author does

14
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,480
with their platform?

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,000
There are a lot of people out there who advocate separating art from the artist, so they won't

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,440
have to examine the ethics of consuming art from people who use their platform to do things

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,520
that might be a little iffy, maybe even harmful.

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,120
Before we jump in, we need to understand that applying a literary theory and examining the

19
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,680
ethics of watching The Usual Suspects knowing what we now know about its director and star

20
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,120
are two very separate issues, and it can be confusing, and you need to be careful not

21
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,620
to conflate the two.

22
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,660
With that in mind, let's talk about death of the author.

23
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,920
Is death of the author right for you?

24
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,780
Are you ready to kill the author?

25
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,180
And is death of the author really even possible to apply to any text in our platform and personal

26
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,340
brand-obsessed culture?

27
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:46,340
Well, today we're going to talk about that, learn a little something, and maybe even have

28
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,340
a little fun.

29
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:06,700
The Fault in Our Stars is a 2012 novel written

30
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,700
by John Green.

31
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,660
The plot of the novel revolves around two teenagers named Hazel Grace Lancaster and

32
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,620
Augustus Waters, the former living with terminal cancer and the latter in remission from his

33
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,480
as they begin a relationship.

34
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,220
In the process of developing their relationship, Hazel Grace shares her favorite book of all

35
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,980
time, An Imperial Affliction by a man named Peter Van Houten, with Augustus.

36
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,500
Though she loves the book, the book's ambiguous ending is a source of consternation for Hazel,

37
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,500
and she longs for nothing more than for the notoriously reclusive Van Houten to tell her

38
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,520
what happens after the book ends.

39
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,820
And so Augustus, having banked his wish from the Make-A-Wish Foundation, uses that wish

40
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,860
to make a trip to Amsterdam with Hazel and her mother to meet Van Houten.

41
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,940
But when they finally meet Van Houten, the two find not the kind, empathetic author that

42
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,900
they imagined, but a drunken misanthrope who refuses to answer their questions.

43
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,060
"'I can no more tell you what happens to her than I can tell you what becomes of Proust's

44
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,340
narrator, or Holden Caulfield's sister, or Huckleberry Finn after he lights out for the

45
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,340
territories.'

46
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,740
"'What happens after the book ends is nothing,' he insists.

47
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,180
"'The book is fiction.

48
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,180
It didn't happen.

49
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,460
It's not real.'

50
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,580
To which a livid Hazel Grace responds,

51
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,580
"'Bullshit!

52
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,020
That's bullshit!

53
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,100
Just tell me!

54
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,140
Make something up!''

55
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,700
Hazel has tied the idea that there is life for these characters after the book ends with

56
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,020
her own narrative.

57
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:27,300
She needs to believe that there is a life for these characters beyond the text.

58
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,660
Because she sees so much of herself in the text, right down to the protagonist living

59
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,280
with terminal cancer.

60
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,820
But in the end, the author of her favorite book has no answer for her.

61
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,340
And when, months later, feeling guilty about the way their interaction had ended, Van Houten

62
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,020
does come up with an answer.

63
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,140
But Hazel no longer wants to know.

64
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,420
So neither she, nor we, the reader, find out the fictional author's intent.

65
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,980
Furthermore, The Fault in Our Stars itself has an ambiguous ending.

66
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,820
We do not find out what becomes of Hazel Grace.

67
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,380
How much longer, if at all, Hazel survives her disease.

68
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,140
As a solitary text unto itself, The Fault in Our Stars could be read as an argument

69
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,140
in favor of death of the author.

70
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,220
Not only is the author completely unlike what the leads expect him to be, the author has

71
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,780
no answers for them.

72
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,140
Seeking out his authorial intent is an exercise in futility.

73
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,700
The author has emotionally moved on from the book.

74
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,580
And if he does have an answer to Hazel's question, he is not obligated to share it.

75
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,120
But moreover, his intent does not matter.

76
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,420
The book does not speak to Hazel because of the author's intent, but because of the

77
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,420
text itself.

78
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,460
The text, in isolation, is what means so much to Hazel.

79
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,540
As a text, this seems to be the theme of The Fault in Our Stars, that a part of growing

80
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,180
up is to stop looking to other people, especially authors, to explain the meaning behind texts,

81
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,300
but instead to figure out what your own reading is.

82
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,140
Of course, we can't know if this was the author's intent based on the text alone.

83
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,820
Fortunately, thanks to the magic of the internet, we do know exactly what the author thinks.

84
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:00,220
In a 2014 tweet, Green got a lot of attention and 10,000 retweets with the proclamation

85
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,580
that books belong to their readers.

86
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,740
Green elaborated on that stance in an interview in 2014.

87
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,820
I think authorial intent is pretty irrelevant, and I tend to agree with the school of literary

88
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,780
criticism that proclaims the death of the author.

89
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,500
When pressed on what happens after the end of The Fault in Our Stars in a way that remarkably

90
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,700
mirrors the way Hazel presses Van Houten, Green stated in a now-deleted 2012 blog entry,

91
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,860
I'm different from Peter Van Houten in many important ways, but in this respect, and some

92
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,300
others, we are the same.

93
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,940
I have access to the exact same text that you do.

94
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,900
My thoughts about the world outside of that text are not any more informed or authoritative

95
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,900
than yours.

96
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,900
It's not my book.

97
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,900
It's your book.

98
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,780
I don't make decisions about things that happen outside the text of the book.

99
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:45,180
I can't read something that isn't there any more than you can.

100
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,380
It's kind of rare to find an author with strong opinions on the concept of death of

101
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,380
the author, who goes out of their way not only to avoid making comments on what happens

102
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:58,020
outside of the text, but to bake that very notion into the text itself.

103
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,780
But of course, Green's approach is not the only one.

104
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,980
If we're talking about inserting authorial intent into texts well after they have been

105
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,980
published, then we need to talk about the hippogriff in the room.

106
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,980
But first...

107
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:31,380
In 1967, French literary critic and theorist Roland Barthes published his essay, L'Amour

108
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,300
or The Death of the Author, which was published in English the following year.

109
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,260
The simplest reduction of the essay's thesis is that readers should pull away from the

110
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:45,140
tenet of traditional literary criticism that focused on authorial intent and instead adopt

111
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,940
a more text-oriented approach that focused on the interaction between the reader and

112
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,380
the text, not between reader and the author.

113
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,940
But to understand how this idea first came about, first we need to put ourselves into

114
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,980
the headspace of French academia in the mid-1960s.

115
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:06,300
Across academia, but particularly in humanities-related fields like literature, linguistics, philosophy,

116
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,420
and anthropology, we were seeing a trend away from a structuralist methodology, i.e. a methodology

117
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:16,820
that saw facets of human culture as intrinsically related to a broader, overarching system or

118
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,820
structure.

119
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:22,420
By the 1960s, academia now saw itself trending towards a post-structuralist point of view,

120
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:27,460
fueled by thinkers like Foucault, Barthes, and my good friend Derrida.

121
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,460
Some questioned the more binary relationship of structuralism, that you couldn't make

122
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:37,100
X assumption about X person slash social group slash work of art just because X person came

123
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,820
from a certain place, experienced a certain thing, spoke a certain language, ate a certain

124
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,060
thing for breakfast, etc.

125
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:49,340
And if it's beginning to sound like post-structuralism involves a lot of complicated French navel-gazing,

126
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,020
academic bloviating, that's because it does.

127
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,780
But for the purposes of keeping this short and sweet, we'll keep our discussion of

128
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:00,140
post-structuralism contained to where it concerns Barthes and novelists.

129
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,060
In Death of the Author, Barthes argues that writing is that neutral, composite, oblique

130
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,780
space where our subject slips away, the negative where all identity is lost, starting with

131
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,700
the very identity of the body, writing.

132
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,740
In other words, Barthes argues that a piece of text is fundamentally divorced from the

133
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,980
author who made it.

134
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,200
And if it seems like a simple concept now, keep in mind.

135
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:25,020
In particular to the literary and visual arts, up until the 1960s, much of a creator's

136
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,180
work in academia was examined through a lens that tied together said creator and their

137
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,180
life.

138
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,620
Biography was king in helping to interpret or understand a work of art.

139
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,420
Take for example William Shakespeare's Macbeth.

140
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,540
Traditional readings of the text would argue that an understanding of both Scottish history

141
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:43,540
and Shakespeare's life are fundamental in understanding the play itself, how it pays

142
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:47,300
homage to King James I, who was king while it was being written, and how it reflects

143
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,300
the king's relationship to the author.

144
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,700
King James was also the patron of Shakespeare's acting company at the time.

145
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,100
But for Barthes, none of this background information would be pertinent in reading

146
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,100
Macbeth.

147
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,940
Meaning, to Barthes, lies in the language of a text itself, and whatever impressions

148
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,440
the reader creates from it.

149
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,340
The author is less of a god and more of a mere scripter.

150
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:09,580
And according to Barthes' contemporary Foucault, the work, which once had the duty of providing

151
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:15,380
immortality, now possesses the right to kill, to be its author's murderer.

152
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:22,060
Does it though?

153
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:26,300
French literary theorists in the mid to late 1960s probably weren't too concerned with

154
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:31,260
pop-cultural fan works and their relation not only to text, but to authorial intent,

155
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,700
and the author's body of work.

156
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,580
In no small part because it was not an organized thing in the way it would be only a decade

157
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,580
later.

158
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,220
But in discussions of death of the author and pop-culture media, the interaction between

159
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,120
author and fans is extremely relevant.

160
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,540
Take for instance a writer like Anne Rice, who takes an unusually hardline stance on

161
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,300
fan works, especially fan fiction.

162
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,780
From Rice's official website,

163
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,060
I do not allow fan fiction.

164
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,600
The characters are copyrighted.

165
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,180
It upsets me terribly to even think about fan fiction with my characters.

166
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:05,180
I advise my readers to write your own original stories, with your own characters.

167
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:09,100
It is absolutely essential that you respect my wishes.

168
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,900
Respect the author's wishes, fans!

169
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,340
How dare you make the gay vampires even gayer!

170
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,260
Anne Rice was not f***ing around either.

171
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,380
To be an Anne Rice fandom in the mid-2000s was to play a dangerous game of threats of

172
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,860
C&Ds and of litigation, and the near sum totality of fan works relating to the Vampire Chronicles

173
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,940
existed in locked-down, private, live-journal groups.

174
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,980
I bring up Rice because, on some level, she has a lot in common with Harry Potter author

175
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,180
J.K. Rowling, but in this one crucial regard, they are miles apart.

176
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,420
From the onset of Harry Potter's popularity, J.K.

177
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:43,140
Rowling has shown an interest in engaging with the fandom and, at most times, been downright

178
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:48,540
encouraging of fan works, not limited to fan art, fan fiction, fan resource sites,

179
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,020
and other things created by her audience.

180
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,420
Said Rowling's agent at Christopher Little Publishing,

181
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,300
J.K. Rowling's reaction is that she is very flattered by the fact that there is such great

182
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:02,220
interest in her Harry Potter series, and that people take the time to write their own stories.

183
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,020
So at a surface level, this seems like an ideal creator-audience relationship.

184
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,220
Your favorite author is not only fine with you and your Tumblr friends writing stories

185
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,140
about her characters, but she's an open book when it comes to answering any and all pedantic

186
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,620
nerd questions you might have about your faves.

187
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,700
What could go wrong with that?

188
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,860
Well, largely, it's the one thing she has in common with Rice, namely the sense that

189
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,460
they are the masters of the universe that they created as authors.

190
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,180
Ever since she joined Twitter, Rowling has had a tendency to post-scripturally insert

191
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:35,620
context, meaning, and intent into her text long after the text has been published, which

192
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,260
many fans love, but just as many take issue with.

193
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:43,720
Not just because of injecting non-textual intent, but because some of that intent comes

194
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,100
laden with...implications.

195
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:53,040
Like sure, we get that lycanthropy is a stand-in for disease stigmatization, but Rowling double-downing

196
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,220
on it and then explicitly stating that it is a wizarding world AIDS analog while making

197
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:03,580
one of the main werewolves in the series essentially a child predator with the explicit evil intent

198
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,020
of infecting people with his disease is...

199
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:11,420
Yikes.

200
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,180
And then there's Dumbledore.

201
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:18,660
At a public reading of the then-recently published last book in the series, Harry Potter and

202
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,660
the Deathly Hallows, when a fan asked if Dumbledore had ever loved anyone, Rowling responded,

203
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:28,540
"'My truthful answer to you, I always thought of Dumbledore as gay,' and that added to his

204
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,860
horror when Grindelwald showed himself to be what he was.

205
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,820
To an extent, Dewey's say it excused Dumbledore a little more because falling in love can

206
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:41,220
blind us to an extent, but he met someone as brilliant as he was, and, rather like Bellatrix,

207
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:46,100
he was very drawn to this brilliant person and horribly, terribly let down by him."

208
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,360
She added, "'Yeah, that's always how I saw Dumbledore.'

209
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,340
And even in 2007, that kind of intent declaration was already begging the question if representation

210
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,940
just for representation's sake, especially when there is no actual reference in the text

211
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:05,100
to Dumbledore's sexuality, was actually helpful, or if it was just shoehorn tokenizing for

212
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,380
the sake of staying relevant.

213
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:12,140
It is, in effect, claiming representation without having to do any of the work of including

214
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,180
it in the text because, hey, authorial intent.'

215
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:21,420
And yet, after all this, despite multiple opportunities to codify Dumbledore's sexuality

216
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,140
into the actual text, she still hasn't done it.

217
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,820
Rowling had the opportunity to actually codify this into later texts, as she is the sole

218
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:33,260
credited writer for both Fantastic Beasts movies, the latter of which touches directly

219
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:38,980
on Dumbledore's angst over his relationship with Grendelwald, but...

220
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,980
No homo.

221
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:44,580
LGBT representation in the Harry Potterverse exists only in the paratext, in the authorial

222
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,580
intent.

223
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,740
Therefore, according to Bart, it does not exist at all.

224
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,340
That said, of course authorial intent influences fan culture and inevitably creeps into the

225
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,020
way people read the text.

226
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,300
People take authorial intent as word of God, and use it to shut down readings that conflict

227
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,220
with the authorial's post-scriptural intent.

228
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,500
And that kind of sucks.

229
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,540
It's all well and good and valid to restrict the discourse on the Harry Potter series to

230
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:13,180
the text itself, and not what the author says about the text, but here's the thing.

231
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,180
That's neither how consuming art nor human nature works.

232
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,980
Text is inevitably consumed with paratext, and paratext influences the way the reader

233
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,980
interprets the text.

234
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:29,060
Simply knowing the discourse around Harry Potter influences the way you read Harry Potter,

235
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:39,820
whether you want it to or not.

236
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:45,300
In literary theory, paratext refers to materials supplied by authors, editors, printers, and

237
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,460
publishers.

238
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:50,620
This concept has more recently expanded to anything relating to the text, ranging all

239
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:55,780
the way from cultural context to personal brand to size and nature of online platform

240
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,180
and, most importantly, to personal identity.

241
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:03,340
It's not that trying to apply Barthes' idea is invalid, but that given the way culture

242
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,900
is trending and how the focus on personal brand and identity is only increasing, even

243
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,940
an author that tries to let their work speak for itself can never really die.

244
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,580
Foucault was actually way more hardcore than Barthes was.

245
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:20,340
Where Barthes stuck to literary theory, Foucault saw the author as a bigger problem within

246
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:24,580
a wider system of thought who got in the way of the discourse.

247
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:29,220
To Foucault, the author is an ideological figure, that people assign meaning to the

248
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,420
author's text just by virtue of who is saying it, rather than the meaning inherent in the

249
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,500
text.

250
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,580
But Foucault considered the decree that the author has disappeared to be an empty one

251
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:44,780
without praxis, and stated that we must locate the space left empty by the author's disappearance,

252
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,860
follow the distribution of gaps and breaches, and watch for openings this disappearance

253
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,220
uncovers.

254
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:55,660
In the year of our lord 2018, we call that thing personal brand.

255
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:00,780
And oh, your precious discourse has indeed been overtaken by cults of personality fifty

256
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,900
years later.

257
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,300
Fifty years later, the work does not possess the right to kill, to be its author's murderer,

258
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,780
because the work will always be tied to the brand, and in that brand lies a certain sort

259
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,580
of immortality.

260
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,100
What is brand can never die.

261
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,560
Foucault was a big proponent not only of shedding personal identity as it pertained to works,

262
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,760
but all the trappings of identity.

263
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,480
We would no longer hear the questions that have been rehashed for so long.

264
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,880
Who really spoke?

265
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,200
Is it really he and not someone else?

266
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,680
With what authenticity or originality?

267
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,960
And what part of his deepest self did he express in his discourse?

268
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:41,640
What difference does it make who is speaking?

269
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:46,280
How one person of one gender or one race in one time and one place reads Macbeth will

270
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,280
be read way differently than how someone else in completely different circumstances will

271
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,280
read it.

272
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,720
Same with who writes it.

273
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,080
And this is a huge shortcoming of Death of the Author in general.

274
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,880
It assumes that all people from all backgrounds have equal opportunity.

275
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,880
They don't.

276
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,120
And that all texts have equal opportunity for exposure based on the merit of the text.

277
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,120
They don't.

278
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,000
In a perfect world, Foucault would be right, and everyone would have equal opportunity

279
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,200
and all texts would be judged on their own merit and not tied to either the author's

280
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,840
identity or their body of work.

281
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,360
But we don't live in a perfect world, Michel.

282
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,280
Therefore, Foucault's ideas, and to a lesser extent, Barth's, can really only exist in

283
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,240
the world of pure theory, because who tells what story, what their background is, and

284
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,160
why they are telling it matters to readers, and is only mattering more and more as time

285
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:40,560
marches on.

286
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,640
If you read The Fault in Our Stars, independent of any paratext, and not reading the author's

287
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,360
note, all you know about the book is that it was written by...a man.

288
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,600
Probably.

289
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,360
That is as pure a reading as you are going to get.

290
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,220
But of course, this is not the reading most people had.

291
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:02,480
Most people knew the paratext, because the author had a platform, and a very large one.

292
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,440
The author puts on a friendly affect for his young, largely teenage audience every Tuesday.

293
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,440
Then you find out that the author was inspired to write the text, in part, because of an

294
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,240
actual human person who lived and died at the age of 16.

295
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,120
A human person who was also a YouTuber, who the author became friends with, in large part

296
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,120
because she was his fan.

297
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,360
This is not intent, but it is paratext, and it does influence the reading of the book.

298
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,280
As The Fault in Our Stars blew up in popularity, so too did the backlash.

299
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,360
Who are you, John Green, to even write this story?

300
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:45,660
Does it make it more legitimate that he knew Esther Earle, or does that make it more exploitative?

301
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,840
Is the whole enterprise exploitative?

302
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,360
In the years that followed, as The Fault in Our Stars continued to sell incredibly well,

303
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:57,560
the discourse began to focus on the author's identity, and the trend of so-called sick

304
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,280
lit that the novel helped popularize.

305
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,280
Which is to say nothing of the content of the novel itself.

306
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,080
People started to get upset about the fact that Hazel and Augustus share their first

307
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,160
kiss at the Anne Frank house.

308
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,040
And there are sex scenes in this book.

309
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,280
What kind of a grown-ass man writes sex scenes between two dying teenagers?

310
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,280
Who's that?

311
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,280
Oh, shit.

312
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:43,040
The Fault in Our Stars was a 2012 novel written by me, John Green, in which I, John Green,

313
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,280
am accidentally a character, kind of, which is what this video is about, sort of.

314
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,280
I said I'm not interested.

315
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,280
But you promised!

316
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,280
Nothing happens!

317
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,280
They're fiction!

318
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,280
They cease to exist the moment the novel ends.

319
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,280
But they can't!

320
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:01,280
What inspired, like, this idea that Van Houten was a reflection of you, that you're your

321
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,280
ugliest self?

322
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,280
Peter!

323
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,280
Well, I mean, I think before The Fault in Our Stars was published, I was interested

324
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,280
in the questions that I ended up writing about in The Fault in Our Stars because I'd been

325
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:27,280
asked thousands of times what happened to certain characters in my book, Looking for

326
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,280
Alaska.

327
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:34,280
And I started to understand that my response to that, my, like, somewhat defensive response

328
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:40,280
to that of, like, I'm not going to tell you, obviously I, you know, obviously I wanted

329
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,280
it to be ambiguous in the story and I still want it to be ambiguous, like, I started to

330
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:50,280
understand that that defensiveness that I had was misplaced, ultimately.

331
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:56,280
And so when people ask me the same question about Hazel or about The Fault in Our Stars,

332
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,280
I do think of it very differently now.

333
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,280
I feel much less defensive.

334
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,280
I still don't feel like I have answers for them, but I understand the question.

335
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:10,280
I understood that when people read books about people reading books, they inevitably put

336
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:15,280
the author of the book, especially if that person is a public figure, into the story.

337
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,280
Right?

338
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:21,280
Like, I remember being a kid and reading Catcher in the Rye and putting J.D. Salinger into

339
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,280
that story.

340
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,280
I couldn't help myself.

341
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,280
You know that song, If a Body Catch a Body Coming Through the Rye?

342
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,280
I'd like, it's If a Body Meet a Body Coming Through the Rye.

343
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:38,280
I felt like there was no way to write about writing without me being a character in the

344
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,280
story in some way.

345
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,280
Like, I was writing those parts of that book in 2010, 2011.

346
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,280
I understood by that time that I had a public life.

347
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:54,280
And, you know, in my own life, when I was a kid, I read books with the authors as characters

348
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,280
in them.

349
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,280
I might have even known that I shouldn't, but I couldn't help myself.

350
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,280
Like, we live in a personality-driven culture.

351
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,280
Even then we did.

352
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,280
A lot of people are only going to read John Green books because they have this parasocial

353
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,280
relationship with John Green.

354
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,280
And, you know, that's not invalid.

355
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,280
I played into it, right?

356
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,280
Like, it's not like I tried to avoid having a public life.

357
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,280
Like, I had an email address that they could Google.

358
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,280
I had a YouTube channel where they could comment.

359
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,280
Like, where did I get off saying that's an inappropriate question to ask this person

360
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,280
who has a Twitter?

361
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,280
That's the end of chapter one.

362
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,280
I wonder if there's just something about human nature.

363
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:57,280
If you read someone who tells a fiction, you feel connected to them, whether you know anything

364
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,280
about their lives or not.

365
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:06,280
Yeah, you at least feel a connection to the way that they imagine something, which is

366
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,280
intimate in a way.

367
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,280
And I don't know that there's any getting around that.

368
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,280
So Nerdfighters, join with Esther and me and tell someone you love that you love them today.

369
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:21,280
And so the question for me is how do authors interact with stories that they've invented

370
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
in this time?

371
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:30,280
I feel like the idea of death of the author kind of stemmed partially from this culture

372
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,280
that was very absolute and Bart kind of wanted to kill absolutes.

373
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,280
But in return it kind of created a different absolute.

374
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:43,280
I used to believe that the author should disappear insofar as possible from the text

375
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:49,280
and that the responsibility of the reader was to read the text and never think about

376
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,280
the author.

377
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,280
You know, like, I had this period in high school where I read everything in the context

378
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,280
of the author.

379
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:00,280
And then I had this long period of maybe 10 or 15 years where I tried to read nothing

380
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,280
in the context of the author.

381
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:07,280
And what I have arrived at at the moment, which I'm sure I will disavow in due time,

382
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:14,280
is that there is no way for an author's brand not to participate in the text if that author

383
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,280
has a public life or even if that author doesn't.

384
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,280
Right?

385
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,280
Like, J.D. Salinger famously did not have a public life, but he is all over those books.

386
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,280
And, like, when people read them, they read them in the context of J.D. Salinger.

387
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,280
And I feel like the absolutes in reading text create this problem where you're either constantly

388
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:36,280
guessing the author's intent or you're actively trying to divorce yourself from everything

389
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,280
you know about the world around you and the author.

390
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,280
And I just don't think that's realistic or helpful.

391
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,280
The first Amazing Night of Amazing I spent with Esther was at LeakyCon, a Harry Potter

392
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,280
conference.

393
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,280
And after all, if it weren't for Harry Potter, I would have no Esther.

394
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,280
And also, there probably wouldn't be a Nerdfighteria.

395
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:57,280
The more you know about my work, the more you know about my friendship with Esther.

396
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,280
Ow!

397
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,280
Too much.

398
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,280
Too much.

399
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,280
That was a headbutt.

400
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,280
Yeah.

401
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:09,280
The more you see me in that story, my hope is that the book works if you don't see me

402
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,280
in the story.

403
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:17,280
And I would honestly feel like the book failed if it needed me to be successful.

404
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:23,280
But at the same time, I am definitely aware of the fact that many of the people who read

405
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,280
it do see me in it.

406
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:30,280
I mean, that's why I wrote that author's note at the beginning was I wanted to try

407
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:35,280
to protect, insofar as possible, this is a little naive in retrospect, but I wanted to

408
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:40,280
try to protect the friendships that I'd had that were important to me, that had influenced

409
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,280
the story.

410
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,280
I wanted to keep them mine.

411
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,280
And that proved to be impossible.

412
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:51,280
And now I read that author's note and I think, oh, that's quite sweet that that author thought

413
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:57,280
that just putting a note in the beginning that says, don't read this autobiographically

414
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,280
is going to work.

415
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:08,280
The Fault in Our Stars is a 2012 novel written by John Green in which two children go to

416
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:14,280
great lengths to find out what happens after the ambiguous ending of the protagonist Hazel's

417
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,280
favorite book.

418
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:20,280
The way they do this is to seek out the notoriously reclusive author and find out the answer from

419
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,280
him.

420
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,280
But the entire idea is flawed from the get-go.

421
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:29,280
Not only does her hero let her down, she does not find her answer because there is none.

422
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,280
And that is a central theme of the text.

423
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,280
Sometimes there is no answer.

424
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:38,280
The universe is chaotic, life is unpredictable, and you have no control of when you will die.

425
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:43,280
And when you do die, you will not know what becomes of your loved ones.

426
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,280
In seeking out the authorial intent behind a work of fiction, the two leads are trying

427
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:52,280
to gain a sense of control in a chaotic universe, the sense that there is indeed an author of

428
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,280
sorts to life, as they do not feel that they are the authors of their own stories, that

429
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,280
they do not have control over their own fates.

430
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,280
And indeed, they do not.

431
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:07,280
But in this case, letting go of that desire for a sense of control is a part of growing

432
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,280
up, which, ironically, neither of these characters will get to do.

433
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,280
They must mature into adults while never living to become adults.

434
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:20,280
This is reflective not only of how we consume media and the way media can genuinely touch

435
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:26,280
and inspire people, but also of a very understandable and human desire to transform that media.

436
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:31,280
Narratives give us a sense of control in a world that is generally chaotic and unpredictable.

437
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,280
We need narratives to make sense of the world that we live in.

438
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:38,280
But that does not mean that we have control over the narrative.

439
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:43,280
The character arcs of both Hazel and Augustus are defined by letting go of that desire for

440
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:49,280
control of their own narratives, and accepting that life, short though it is, just doesn't

441
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,280
work that way, no matter how much they wish it did.

442
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,280
But, that's just my reading.

443
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:10,280
Listen, Lindsay, what would it look like if we all listened more?

444
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,280
I don't know, John.

445
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,280
What would it look like?

446
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,280
It would look like a better world, Lindsay.

447
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:17,280
And listening to audiobooks motivates us, it inspires us, and it can even bring us closer

448
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,280
together.

449
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,280
There is no better place to listen than Audible, because now Audible members get even more

450
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:27,280
exclusive audio fitness programs, audiobooks, Audible Originals, and more.

451
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:31,280
Audible has the largest selection of audiobooks on the planet, and now with Audible Originals,

452
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,280
the selection has gotten even more custom, with content made for members.

453
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,280
Host, pick a book to discuss that resonates with your audience.

454
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,280
I recommend Turtles All The Way Down by me.

455
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,280
It's read by Kate Rudd.

456
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,280
She's so good at that job.

457
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,280
Or this one.

458
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,280
This one.

459
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,280
Also narrated by Kate Rudd.

460
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,280
She did a great job.

461
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,280
She did such a good job that they hired her to do this one, too.

462
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,280
You should just get both of them.

463
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,280
It's only two Audible credits.

464
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,280
Yeah.

465
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,280
One of them's free.

466
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,280
Go to audible.com slash lindsayellis.

467
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,280

472
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:23,280
That's Lindsay with an A, Ellis with an E and an I, two L's and an S, to 500-500 and

473
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,280
get your first audiobook free and make it turtles all the way down.

474
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,280
That way Lindsay and I win.

475
00:29:53,280 --> 00:30:06,280
The Fault in Our Stars was a 2012 novel written by Lindsay Ellis.

476
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,280
I did it.

477
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,280
She did a good job.

478
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,280
Yay.

479
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,280
She doesn't get any of the royalties.

480
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,280
I get the credit, apparently.

481
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,280
Yeah, but the money is mine.
