0	12360	So, I hear you might be thinking about killing the author.
12360	16040	It's an exciting time in any person's life when they're deciding which literary theory
16040	21320	to apply to the way they read texts, but it's important to know what you're getting into,
21320	25280	and make sure that this literary theory is the right one for you.
25280	29000	What is it about death of the author that appeals to you, the reader?
29000	32440	Before you start applying literary theories, you want to make sure that you're doing it
32440	34080	for the right reasons.
34080	38120	There are an awful lot of young people out there who rush into death of the author without
38120	40800	really understanding its intended purpose.
40800	44920	Are you trying to enhance your understanding of a text by secluding yourself from authorial
44920	46480	intent or a body of work?
46480	49880	Or are you trying to excuse yourself from potential guilt when you find out that your
49880	55060	favorite author might be a shitbag, and you don't want to examine what that author does
55060	56480	with their platform?
56480	61000	There are a lot of people out there who advocate separating art from the artist, so they won't
61000	65440	have to examine the ethics of consuming art from people who use their platform to do things
65440	69520	that might be a little iffy, maybe even harmful.
69520	74120	Before we jump in, we need to understand that applying a literary theory and examining the
74120	78680	ethics of watching The Usual Suspects knowing what we now know about its director and star
78680	84120	are two very separate issues, and it can be confusing, and you need to be careful not
84120	85620	to conflate the two.
85620	89660	With that in mind, let's talk about death of the author.
89660	91920	Is death of the author right for you?
91920	93780	Are you ready to kill the author?
93780	99180	And is death of the author really even possible to apply to any text in our platform and personal
99180	100340	brand-obsessed culture?
100340	106340	Well, today we're going to talk about that, learn a little something, and maybe even have
106340	107340	a little fun.
116620	126700	The Fault in Our Stars is a 2012 novel written
126700	127700	by John Green.
127700	131660	The plot of the novel revolves around two teenagers named Hazel Grace Lancaster and
131660	136620	Augustus Waters, the former living with terminal cancer and the latter in remission from his
136620	138480	as they begin a relationship.
138480	142220	In the process of developing their relationship, Hazel Grace shares her favorite book of all
142220	146980	time, An Imperial Affliction by a man named Peter Van Houten, with Augustus.
146980	151500	Though she loves the book, the book's ambiguous ending is a source of consternation for Hazel,
151500	155500	and she longs for nothing more than for the notoriously reclusive Van Houten to tell her
155500	157520	what happens after the book ends.
157520	161820	And so Augustus, having banked his wish from the Make-A-Wish Foundation, uses that wish
161820	165860	to make a trip to Amsterdam with Hazel and her mother to meet Van Houten.
165860	169940	But when they finally meet Van Houten, the two find not the kind, empathetic author that
169940	173900	they imagined, but a drunken misanthrope who refuses to answer their questions.
173900	178060	"'I can no more tell you what happens to her than I can tell you what becomes of Proust's
178060	182340	narrator, or Holden Caulfield's sister, or Huckleberry Finn after he lights out for the
182340	183340	territories.'
183340	186740	"'What happens after the book ends is nothing,' he insists.
186740	188180	"'The book is fiction.
188180	189180	It didn't happen.
189180	190460	It's not real.'
190460	192580	To which a livid Hazel Grace responds,
192580	193580	"'Bullshit!
193580	195020	That's bullshit!
195020	196100	Just tell me!
196100	198140	Make something up!''
198140	201700	Hazel has tied the idea that there is life for these characters after the book ends with
201700	203020	her own narrative.
203020	207300	She needs to believe that there is a life for these characters beyond the text.
207300	211660	Because she sees so much of herself in the text, right down to the protagonist living
211660	213280	with terminal cancer.
213280	216820	But in the end, the author of her favorite book has no answer for her.
216820	221340	And when, months later, feeling guilty about the way their interaction had ended, Van Houten
221340	223020	does come up with an answer.
223020	225140	But Hazel no longer wants to know.
225140	229420	So neither she, nor we, the reader, find out the fictional author's intent.
229420	232980	Furthermore, The Fault in Our Stars itself has an ambiguous ending.
232980	235820	We do not find out what becomes of Hazel Grace.
235820	239380	How much longer, if at all, Hazel survives her disease.
239380	243140	As a solitary text unto itself, The Fault in Our Stars could be read as an argument
243140	245140	in favor of death of the author.
245140	249220	Not only is the author completely unlike what the leads expect him to be, the author has
249220	250780	no answers for them.
250780	254140	Seeking out his authorial intent is an exercise in futility.
254140	256700	The author has emotionally moved on from the book.
256700	261580	And if he does have an answer to Hazel's question, he is not obligated to share it.
261580	264120	But moreover, his intent does not matter.
264120	268420	The book does not speak to Hazel because of the author's intent, but because of the
268420	269420	text itself.
269420	272460	The text, in isolation, is what means so much to Hazel.
272460	276540	As a text, this seems to be the theme of The Fault in Our Stars, that a part of growing
276540	282180	up is to stop looking to other people, especially authors, to explain the meaning behind texts,
282180	285300	but instead to figure out what your own reading is.
285300	290140	Of course, we can't know if this was the author's intent based on the text alone.
290140	294820	Fortunately, thanks to the magic of the internet, we do know exactly what the author thinks.
294820	300220	In a 2014 tweet, Green got a lot of attention and 10,000 retweets with the proclamation
300220	302580	that books belong to their readers.
302580	305740	Green elaborated on that stance in an interview in 2014.
305740	309820	I think authorial intent is pretty irrelevant, and I tend to agree with the school of literary
309820	312780	criticism that proclaims the death of the author.
312780	316500	When pressed on what happens after the end of The Fault in Our Stars in a way that remarkably
316500	321700	mirrors the way Hazel presses Van Houten, Green stated in a now-deleted 2012 blog entry,
321700	326860	I'm different from Peter Van Houten in many important ways, but in this respect, and some
326860	328300	others, we are the same.
328300	330940	I have access to the exact same text that you do.
330940	334900	My thoughts about the world outside of that text are not any more informed or authoritative
334900	335900	than yours.
335900	336900	It's not my book.
336900	337900	It's your book.
337980	341780	I don't make decisions about things that happen outside the text of the book.
341780	345180	I can't read something that isn't there any more than you can.
345180	349380	It's kind of rare to find an author with strong opinions on the concept of death of
349380	353380	the author, who goes out of their way not only to avoid making comments on what happens
353380	358020	outside of the text, but to bake that very notion into the text itself.
358020	360780	But of course, Green's approach is not the only one.
360780	364980	If we're talking about inserting authorial intent into texts well after they have been
364980	368980	published, then we need to talk about the hippogriff in the room.
378980	379980	But first...
385980	391380	In 1967, French literary critic and theorist Roland Barthes published his essay, L'Amour
392380	396300	or The Death of the Author, which was published in English the following year.
396300	400260	The simplest reduction of the essay's thesis is that readers should pull away from the
400260	405140	tenet of traditional literary criticism that focused on authorial intent and instead adopt
405140	408940	a more text-oriented approach that focused on the interaction between the reader and
408940	412380	the text, not between reader and the author.
412380	416940	But to understand how this idea first came about, first we need to put ourselves into
416940	420980	the headspace of French academia in the mid-1960s.
420980	426300	Across academia, but particularly in humanities-related fields like literature, linguistics, philosophy,
426300	431420	and anthropology, we were seeing a trend away from a structuralist methodology, i.e. a methodology
431420	436820	that saw facets of human culture as intrinsically related to a broader, overarching system or
436820	437820	structure.
437820	442420	By the 1960s, academia now saw itself trending towards a post-structuralist point of view,
442420	447460	fueled by thinkers like Foucault, Barthes, and my good friend Derrida.
447460	451460	Some questioned the more binary relationship of structuralism, that you couldn't make
451460	457100	X assumption about X person slash social group slash work of art just because X person came
457100	461820	from a certain place, experienced a certain thing, spoke a certain language, ate a certain
461820	464060	thing for breakfast, etc.
464060	469340	And if it's beginning to sound like post-structuralism involves a lot of complicated French navel-gazing,
469340	472020	academic bloviating, that's because it does.
472020	475780	But for the purposes of keeping this short and sweet, we'll keep our discussion of
475780	480140	post-structuralism contained to where it concerns Barthes and novelists.
480140	484060	In Death of the Author, Barthes argues that writing is that neutral, composite, oblique
484060	488780	space where our subject slips away, the negative where all identity is lost, starting with
488780	491700	the very identity of the body, writing.
491700	495740	In other words, Barthes argues that a piece of text is fundamentally divorced from the
495740	496980	author who made it.
496980	500200	And if it seems like a simple concept now, keep in mind.
500200	505020	In particular to the literary and visual arts, up until the 1960s, much of a creator's
505020	509180	work in academia was examined through a lens that tied together said creator and their
509180	510180	life.
510180	513620	Biography was king in helping to interpret or understand a work of art.
513620	516420	Take for example William Shakespeare's Macbeth.
516420	519540	Traditional readings of the text would argue that an understanding of both Scottish history
519540	523540	and Shakespeare's life are fundamental in understanding the play itself, how it pays
523540	527300	homage to King James I, who was king while it was being written, and how it reflects
527300	529300	the king's relationship to the author.
529300	532700	King James was also the patron of Shakespeare's acting company at the time.
532700	536100	But for Barthes, none of this background information would be pertinent in reading
536100	537100	Macbeth.
537100	540940	Meaning, to Barthes, lies in the language of a text itself, and whatever impressions
540940	542440	the reader creates from it.
542440	545340	The author is less of a god and more of a mere scripter.
545340	549580	And according to Barthes' contemporary Foucault, the work, which once had the duty of providing
549580	555380	immortality, now possesses the right to kill, to be its author's murderer.
555380	562060	Does it though?
562140	566300	French literary theorists in the mid to late 1960s probably weren't too concerned with
566300	571260	pop-cultural fan works and their relation not only to text, but to authorial intent,
571260	572700	and the author's body of work.
572700	577580	In no small part because it was not an organized thing in the way it would be only a decade
577580	578580	later.
578580	582220	But in discussions of death of the author and pop-culture media, the interaction between
582220	585120	author and fans is extremely relevant.
585120	589540	Take for instance a writer like Anne Rice, who takes an unusually hardline stance on
589540	592300	fan works, especially fan fiction.
592300	593780	From Rice's official website,
593780	596060	I do not allow fan fiction.
596060	597600	The characters are copyrighted.
597600	601180	It upsets me terribly to even think about fan fiction with my characters.
601180	605180	I advise my readers to write your own original stories, with your own characters.
605180	609100	It is absolutely essential that you respect my wishes.
609100	610900	Respect the author's wishes, fans!
610900	613340	How dare you make the gay vampires even gayer!
613340	615260	Anne Rice was not f***ing around either.
615260	619380	To be an Anne Rice fandom in the mid-2000s was to play a dangerous game of threats of
619380	624860	C&Ds and of litigation, and the near sum totality of fan works relating to the Vampire Chronicles
624860	627940	existed in locked-down, private, live-journal groups.
627940	631980	I bring up Rice because, on some level, she has a lot in common with Harry Potter author
631980	636180	J.K. Rowling, but in this one crucial regard, they are miles apart.
636180	638420	From the onset of Harry Potter's popularity, J.K.
638420	643140	Rowling has shown an interest in engaging with the fandom and, at most times, been downright
643140	648540	encouraging of fan works, not limited to fan art, fan fiction, fan resource sites,
648540	651020	and other things created by her audience.
651020	653420	Said Rowling's agent at Christopher Little Publishing,
653420	657300	J.K. Rowling's reaction is that she is very flattered by the fact that there is such great
657300	662220	interest in her Harry Potter series, and that people take the time to write their own stories.
662220	666020	So at a surface level, this seems like an ideal creator-audience relationship.
666020	669220	Your favorite author is not only fine with you and your Tumblr friends writing stories
669220	673140	about her characters, but she's an open book when it comes to answering any and all pedantic
673140	675620	nerd questions you might have about your faves.
675620	677700	What could go wrong with that?
677700	682860	Well, largely, it's the one thing she has in common with Rice, namely the sense that
682860	686460	they are the masters of the universe that they created as authors.
686460	690180	Ever since she joined Twitter, Rowling has had a tendency to post-scripturally insert
690180	695620	context, meaning, and intent into her text long after the text has been published, which
695620	699260	many fans love, but just as many take issue with.
699260	703720	Not just because of injecting non-textual intent, but because some of that intent comes
703720	707100	laden with...implications.
707100	713040	Like sure, we get that lycanthropy is a stand-in for disease stigmatization, but Rowling double-downing
713040	718220	on it and then explicitly stating that it is a wizarding world AIDS analog while making
718220	723580	one of the main werewolves in the series essentially a child predator with the explicit evil intent
723580	726020	of infecting people with his disease is...
726020	731420	Yikes.
731420	734180	And then there's Dumbledore.
734180	738660	At a public reading of the then-recently published last book in the series, Harry Potter and
738660	743660	the Deathly Hallows, when a fan asked if Dumbledore had ever loved anyone, Rowling responded,
743660	748540	"'My truthful answer to you, I always thought of Dumbledore as gay,' and that added to his
748540	751860	horror when Grindelwald showed himself to be what he was.
751860	755820	To an extent, Dewey's say it excused Dumbledore a little more because falling in love can
755820	761220	blind us to an extent, but he met someone as brilliant as he was, and, rather like Bellatrix,
761220	766100	he was very drawn to this brilliant person and horribly, terribly let down by him."
766100	769360	She added, "'Yeah, that's always how I saw Dumbledore.'
769360	775340	And even in 2007, that kind of intent declaration was already begging the question if representation
775340	779940	just for representation's sake, especially when there is no actual reference in the text
779940	785100	to Dumbledore's sexuality, was actually helpful, or if it was just shoehorn tokenizing for
785100	787380	the sake of staying relevant.
787380	792140	It is, in effect, claiming representation without having to do any of the work of including
792140	796180	it in the text because, hey, authorial intent.'
796180	801420	And yet, after all this, despite multiple opportunities to codify Dumbledore's sexuality
801420	805140	into the actual text, she still hasn't done it.
805140	808820	Rowling had the opportunity to actually codify this into later texts, as she is the sole
808820	813260	credited writer for both Fantastic Beasts movies, the latter of which touches directly
813260	818980	on Dumbledore's angst over his relationship with Grendelwald, but...
818980	819980	No homo.
819980	824580	LGBT representation in the Harry Potterverse exists only in the paratext, in the authorial
824580	825580	intent.
825580	828740	Therefore, according to Bart, it does not exist at all.
828740	833340	That said, of course authorial intent influences fan culture and inevitably creeps into the
833340	835020	way people read the text.
835020	839300	People take authorial intent as word of God, and use it to shut down readings that conflict
839300	842220	with the authorial's post-scriptural intent.
842220	844500	And that kind of sucks.
844500	848540	It's all well and good and valid to restrict the discourse on the Harry Potter series to
848540	853180	the text itself, and not what the author says about the text, but here's the thing.
853180	857180	That's neither how consuming art nor human nature works.
857180	861980	Text is inevitably consumed with paratext, and paratext influences the way the reader
861980	863980	interprets the text.
863980	869060	Simply knowing the discourse around Harry Potter influences the way you read Harry Potter,
869060	879820	whether you want it to or not.
879820	885300	In literary theory, paratext refers to materials supplied by authors, editors, printers, and
885300	886460	publishers.
886460	890620	This concept has more recently expanded to anything relating to the text, ranging all
890700	895780	the way from cultural context to personal brand to size and nature of online platform
895780	899180	and, most importantly, to personal identity.
899180	903340	It's not that trying to apply Barthes' idea is invalid, but that given the way culture
903340	907900	is trending and how the focus on personal brand and identity is only increasing, even
907900	912940	an author that tries to let their work speak for itself can never really die.
912940	915580	Foucault was actually way more hardcore than Barthes was.
915580	920340	Where Barthes stuck to literary theory, Foucault saw the author as a bigger problem within
920340	924580	a wider system of thought who got in the way of the discourse.
924580	929220	To Foucault, the author is an ideological figure, that people assign meaning to the
929220	933420	author's text just by virtue of who is saying it, rather than the meaning inherent in the
933420	934500	text.
934500	938580	But Foucault considered the decree that the author has disappeared to be an empty one
938580	944780	without praxis, and stated that we must locate the space left empty by the author's disappearance,
944780	948860	follow the distribution of gaps and breaches, and watch for openings this disappearance
948860	950220	uncovers.
950220	955660	In the year of our lord 2018, we call that thing personal brand.
955660	960780	And oh, your precious discourse has indeed been overtaken by cults of personality fifty
960780	961900	years later.
961900	966300	Fifty years later, the work does not possess the right to kill, to be its author's murderer,
966300	970780	because the work will always be tied to the brand, and in that brand lies a certain sort
970780	972580	of immortality.
972580	975100	What is brand can never die.
975100	979560	Foucault was a big proponent not only of shedding personal identity as it pertained to works,
979560	981760	but all the trappings of identity.
981760	985480	We would no longer hear the questions that have been rehashed for so long.
985480	986880	Who really spoke?
986880	989200	Is it really he and not someone else?
989200	991680	With what authenticity or originality?
991680	995960	And what part of his deepest self did he express in his discourse?
995960	1001640	What difference does it make who is speaking?
1001640	1006280	How one person of one gender or one race in one time and one place reads Macbeth will
1006360	1010280	be read way differently than how someone else in completely different circumstances will
1010280	1011280	read it.
1011280	1012720	Same with who writes it.
1012720	1016080	And this is a huge shortcoming of Death of the Author in general.
1016080	1019880	It assumes that all people from all backgrounds have equal opportunity.
1019880	1020880	They don't.
1020880	1025120	And that all texts have equal opportunity for exposure based on the merit of the text.
1025120	1026120	They don't.
1026120	1030000	In a perfect world, Foucault would be right, and everyone would have equal opportunity
1030000	1034200	and all texts would be judged on their own merit and not tied to either the author's
1034200	1036840	identity or their body of work.
1036840	1039360	But we don't live in a perfect world, Michel.
1039360	1044280	Therefore, Foucault's ideas, and to a lesser extent, Barth's, can really only exist in
1044280	1049240	the world of pure theory, because who tells what story, what their background is, and
1049240	1054160	why they are telling it matters to readers, and is only mattering more and more as time
1054160	1060560	marches on.
1060560	1064640	If you read The Fault in Our Stars, independent of any paratext, and not reading the author's
1064640	1070360	note, all you know about the book is that it was written by...a man.
1070360	1071600	Probably.
1071600	1074360	That is as pure a reading as you are going to get.
1074360	1077220	But of course, this is not the reading most people had.
1077220	1082480	Most people knew the paratext, because the author had a platform, and a very large one.
1082480	1088440	The author puts on a friendly affect for his young, largely teenage audience every Tuesday.
1088440	1092440	Then you find out that the author was inspired to write the text, in part, because of an
1092440	1096240	actual human person who lived and died at the age of 16.
1096240	1101120	A human person who was also a YouTuber, who the author became friends with, in large part
1101120	1103120	because she was his fan.
1108320	1113360	This is not intent, but it is paratext, and it does influence the reading of the book.
1113360	1117280	As The Fault in Our Stars blew up in popularity, so too did the backlash.
1117280	1120360	Who are you, John Green, to even write this story?
1120360	1125660	Does it make it more legitimate that he knew Esther Earle, or does that make it more exploitative?
1125660	1127840	Is the whole enterprise exploitative?
1127840	1132360	In the years that followed, as The Fault in Our Stars continued to sell incredibly well,
1132360	1137560	the discourse began to focus on the author's identity, and the trend of so-called sick
1137560	1140280	lit that the novel helped popularize.
1140280	1143280	Which is to say nothing of the content of the novel itself.
1143280	1147080	People started to get upset about the fact that Hazel and Augustus share their first
1147080	1150160	kiss at the Anne Frank house.
1150160	1152040	And there are sex scenes in this book.
1152040	1156280	What kind of a grown-ass man writes sex scenes between two dying teenagers?
1156280	1158280	Who's that?
1167280	1168280	Oh, shit.
1173280	1183040	The Fault in Our Stars was a 2012 novel written by me, John Green, in which I, John Green,
1183040	1187280	am accidentally a character, kind of, which is what this video is about, sort of.
1187280	1189280	I said I'm not interested.
1189280	1190280	But you promised!
1190280	1191280	Nothing happens!
1191280	1192280	They're fiction!
1192280	1195280	They cease to exist the moment the novel ends.
1195280	1196280	But they can't!
1196280	1201280	What inspired, like, this idea that Van Houten was a reflection of you, that you're your
1201280	1202280	ugliest self?
1203280	1204280	Peter!
1211280	1215280	Well, I mean, I think before The Fault in Our Stars was published, I was interested
1215280	1220280	in the questions that I ended up writing about in The Fault in Our Stars because I'd been
1220280	1227280	asked thousands of times what happened to certain characters in my book, Looking for
1227280	1228280	Alaska.
1228280	1234280	And I started to understand that my response to that, my, like, somewhat defensive response
1234280	1240280	to that of, like, I'm not going to tell you, obviously I, you know, obviously I wanted
1240280	1244280	it to be ambiguous in the story and I still want it to be ambiguous, like, I started to
1244280	1250280	understand that that defensiveness that I had was misplaced, ultimately.
1250280	1256280	And so when people ask me the same question about Hazel or about The Fault in Our Stars,
1256280	1258280	I do think of it very differently now.
1258280	1259280	I feel much less defensive.
1259280	1264280	I still don't feel like I have answers for them, but I understand the question.
1264280	1270280	I understood that when people read books about people reading books, they inevitably put
1270280	1275280	the author of the book, especially if that person is a public figure, into the story.
1275280	1276280	Right?
1276280	1281280	Like, I remember being a kid and reading Catcher in the Rye and putting J.D. Salinger into
1281280	1282280	that story.
1282280	1283280	I couldn't help myself.
1283280	1286280	You know that song, If a Body Catch a Body Coming Through the Rye?
1286280	1290280	I'd like, it's If a Body Meet a Body Coming Through the Rye.
1290280	1298280	I felt like there was no way to write about writing without me being a character in the
1298280	1299280	story in some way.
1299280	1302280	Like, I was writing those parts of that book in 2010, 2011.
1302280	1305280	I understood by that time that I had a public life.
1306280	1314280	And, you know, in my own life, when I was a kid, I read books with the authors as characters
1314280	1315280	in them.
1315280	1318280	I might have even known that I shouldn't, but I couldn't help myself.
1318280	1320280	Like, we live in a personality-driven culture.
1320280	1321280	Even then we did.
1328280	1332280	A lot of people are only going to read John Green books because they have this parasocial
1332280	1334280	relationship with John Green.
1334280	1337280	And, you know, that's not invalid.
1337280	1339280	I played into it, right?
1339280	1343280	Like, it's not like I tried to avoid having a public life.
1343280	1346280	Like, I had an email address that they could Google.
1346280	1349280	I had a YouTube channel where they could comment.
1349280	1354280	Like, where did I get off saying that's an inappropriate question to ask this person
1354280	1356280	who has a Twitter?
1365280	1366280	That's the end of chapter one.
1366280	1369280	I wonder if there's just something about human nature.
1369280	1377280	If you read someone who tells a fiction, you feel connected to them, whether you know anything
1377280	1379280	about their lives or not.
1379280	1386280	Yeah, you at least feel a connection to the way that they imagine something, which is
1386280	1388280	intimate in a way.
1388280	1391280	And I don't know that there's any getting around that.
1392280	1395280	So Nerdfighters, join with Esther and me and tell someone you love that you love them today.
1395280	1401280	And so the question for me is how do authors interact with stories that they've invented
1401280	1402280	in this time?
1402280	1410280	I feel like the idea of death of the author kind of stemmed partially from this culture
1410280	1414280	that was very absolute and Bart kind of wanted to kill absolutes.
1414280	1417280	But in return it kind of created a different absolute.
1417280	1423280	I used to believe that the author should disappear insofar as possible from the text
1423280	1429280	and that the responsibility of the reader was to read the text and never think about
1429280	1430280	the author.
1430280	1434280	You know, like, I had this period in high school where I read everything in the context
1434280	1435280	of the author.
1435280	1440280	And then I had this long period of maybe 10 or 15 years where I tried to read nothing
1440280	1442280	in the context of the author.
1442280	1447280	And what I have arrived at at the moment, which I'm sure I will disavow in due time,
1447280	1454280	is that there is no way for an author's brand not to participate in the text if that author
1454280	1457280	has a public life or even if that author doesn't.
1457280	1458280	Right?
1458280	1462280	Like, J.D. Salinger famously did not have a public life, but he is all over those books.
1462280	1466280	And, like, when people read them, they read them in the context of J.D. Salinger.
1467280	1471280	And I feel like the absolutes in reading text create this problem where you're either constantly
1471280	1476280	guessing the author's intent or you're actively trying to divorce yourself from everything
1476280	1479280	you know about the world around you and the author.
1479280	1481280	And I just don't think that's realistic or helpful.
1481280	1486280	The first Amazing Night of Amazing I spent with Esther was at LeakyCon, a Harry Potter
1486280	1487280	conference.
1487280	1490280	And after all, if it weren't for Harry Potter, I would have no Esther.
1490280	1492280	And also, there probably wouldn't be a Nerdfighteria.
1492280	1497280	The more you know about my work, the more you know about my friendship with Esther.
1497280	1498280	Ow!
1498280	1499280	Too much.
1499280	1500280	Too much.
1500280	1501280	That was a headbutt.
1501280	1502280	Yeah.
1502280	1509280	The more you see me in that story, my hope is that the book works if you don't see me
1509280	1510280	in the story.
1510280	1517280	And I would honestly feel like the book failed if it needed me to be successful.
1518280	1523280	But at the same time, I am definitely aware of the fact that many of the people who read
1523280	1526280	it do see me in it.
1526280	1530280	I mean, that's why I wrote that author's note at the beginning was I wanted to try
1530280	1535280	to protect, insofar as possible, this is a little naive in retrospect, but I wanted to
1535280	1540280	try to protect the friendships that I'd had that were important to me, that had influenced
1540280	1541280	the story.
1541280	1543280	I wanted to keep them mine.
1544280	1546280	And that proved to be impossible.
1546280	1551280	And now I read that author's note and I think, oh, that's quite sweet that that author thought
1551280	1557280	that just putting a note in the beginning that says, don't read this autobiographically
1557280	1558280	is going to work.
1562280	1568280	The Fault in Our Stars is a 2012 novel written by John Green in which two children go to
1569280	1574280	great lengths to find out what happens after the ambiguous ending of the protagonist Hazel's
1574280	1575280	favorite book.
1575280	1580280	The way they do this is to seek out the notoriously reclusive author and find out the answer from
1580280	1581280	him.
1581280	1584280	But the entire idea is flawed from the get-go.
1584280	1589280	Not only does her hero let her down, she does not find her answer because there is none.
1589280	1592280	And that is a central theme of the text.
1592280	1593280	Sometimes there is no answer.
1593280	1598280	The universe is chaotic, life is unpredictable, and you have no control of when you will die.
1598280	1603280	And when you do die, you will not know what becomes of your loved ones.
1603280	1607280	In seeking out the authorial intent behind a work of fiction, the two leads are trying
1607280	1612280	to gain a sense of control in a chaotic universe, the sense that there is indeed an author of
1612280	1616280	sorts to life, as they do not feel that they are the authors of their own stories, that
1616280	1620280	they do not have control over their own fates.
1620280	1622280	And indeed, they do not.
1622280	1627280	But in this case, letting go of that desire for a sense of control is a part of growing
1627280	1631280	up, which, ironically, neither of these characters will get to do.
1631280	1635280	They must mature into adults while never living to become adults.
1635280	1640280	This is reflective not only of how we consume media and the way media can genuinely touch
1640280	1646280	and inspire people, but also of a very understandable and human desire to transform that media.
1646280	1651280	Narratives give us a sense of control in a world that is generally chaotic and unpredictable.
1651280	1654280	We need narratives to make sense of the world that we live in.
1654280	1658280	But that does not mean that we have control over the narrative.
1658280	1663280	The character arcs of both Hazel and Augustus are defined by letting go of that desire for
1663280	1669280	control of their own narratives, and accepting that life, short though it is, just doesn't
1669280	1673280	work that way, no matter how much they wish it did.
1673280	1677280	But, that's just my reading.
1681280	1690280	Listen, Lindsay, what would it look like if we all listened more?
1690280	1691280	I don't know, John.
1691280	1692280	What would it look like?
1692280	1693280	It would look like a better world, Lindsay.
1693280	1697280	And listening to audiobooks motivates us, it inspires us, and it can even bring us closer
1697280	1698280	together.
1698280	1702280	There is no better place to listen than Audible, because now Audible members get even more
1702280	1707280	exclusive audio fitness programs, audiobooks, Audible Originals, and more.
1707280	1711280	Audible has the largest selection of audiobooks on the planet, and now with Audible Originals,
1711280	1715280	the selection has gotten even more custom, with content made for members.
1715280	1718280	Host, pick a book to discuss that resonates with your audience.
1718280	1720280	I recommend Turtles All The Way Down by me.
1720280	1721280	It's read by Kate Rudd.
1721280	1723280	She's so good at that job.
1723280	1724280	Or this one.
1724280	1725280	This one.
1725280	1727280	Also narrated by Kate Rudd.
1727280	1728280	She did a great job.
1728280	1731280	She did such a good job that they hired her to do this one, too.
1731280	1732280	You should just get both of them.
1732280	1734280	It's only two Audible credits.
1734280	1735280	Yeah.

1793280	1806280	The Fault in Our Stars was a 2012 novel written by Lindsay Ellis.
1806280	1808280	I did it.
1808280	1809280	She did a good job.
1809280	1810280	Yay.
1810280	1812280	She doesn't get any of the royalties.
1812280	1814280	I get the credit, apparently.
1814280	1816280	Yeah, but the money is mine.
