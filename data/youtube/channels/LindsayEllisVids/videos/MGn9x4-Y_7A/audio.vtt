00:00.000 --> 00:12.360
So, I hear you might be thinking about killing the author.

00:12.360 --> 00:16.040
It's an exciting time in any person's life when they're deciding which literary theory

00:16.040 --> 00:21.320
to apply to the way they read texts, but it's important to know what you're getting into,

00:21.320 --> 00:25.280
and make sure that this literary theory is the right one for you.

00:25.280 --> 00:29.000
What is it about death of the author that appeals to you, the reader?

00:29.000 --> 00:32.440
Before you start applying literary theories, you want to make sure that you're doing it

00:32.440 --> 00:34.080
for the right reasons.

00:34.080 --> 00:38.120
There are an awful lot of young people out there who rush into death of the author without

00:38.120 --> 00:40.800
really understanding its intended purpose.

00:40.800 --> 00:44.920
Are you trying to enhance your understanding of a text by secluding yourself from authorial

00:44.920 --> 00:46.480
intent or a body of work?

00:46.480 --> 00:49.880
Or are you trying to excuse yourself from potential guilt when you find out that your

00:49.880 --> 00:55.060
favorite author might be a shitbag, and you don't want to examine what that author does

00:55.060 --> 00:56.480
with their platform?

00:56.480 --> 01:01.000
There are a lot of people out there who advocate separating art from the artist, so they won't

01:01.000 --> 01:05.440
have to examine the ethics of consuming art from people who use their platform to do things

01:05.440 --> 01:09.520
that might be a little iffy, maybe even harmful.

01:09.520 --> 01:14.120
Before we jump in, we need to understand that applying a literary theory and examining the

01:14.120 --> 01:18.680
ethics of watching The Usual Suspects knowing what we now know about its director and star

01:18.680 --> 01:24.120
are two very separate issues, and it can be confusing, and you need to be careful not

01:24.120 --> 01:25.620
to conflate the two.

01:25.620 --> 01:29.660
With that in mind, let's talk about death of the author.

01:29.660 --> 01:31.920
Is death of the author right for you?

01:31.920 --> 01:33.780
Are you ready to kill the author?

01:33.780 --> 01:39.180
And is death of the author really even possible to apply to any text in our platform and personal

01:39.180 --> 01:40.340
brand-obsessed culture?

01:40.340 --> 01:46.340
Well, today we're going to talk about that, learn a little something, and maybe even have

01:46.340 --> 01:47.340
a little fun.

01:56.620 --> 02:06.700
The Fault in Our Stars is a 2012 novel written

02:06.700 --> 02:07.700
by John Green.

02:07.700 --> 02:11.660
The plot of the novel revolves around two teenagers named Hazel Grace Lancaster and

02:11.660 --> 02:16.620
Augustus Waters, the former living with terminal cancer and the latter in remission from his

02:16.620 --> 02:18.480
as they begin a relationship.

02:18.480 --> 02:22.220
In the process of developing their relationship, Hazel Grace shares her favorite book of all

02:22.220 --> 02:26.980
time, An Imperial Affliction by a man named Peter Van Houten, with Augustus.

02:26.980 --> 02:31.500
Though she loves the book, the book's ambiguous ending is a source of consternation for Hazel,

02:31.500 --> 02:35.500
and she longs for nothing more than for the notoriously reclusive Van Houten to tell her

02:35.500 --> 02:37.520
what happens after the book ends.

02:37.520 --> 02:41.820
And so Augustus, having banked his wish from the Make-A-Wish Foundation, uses that wish

02:41.820 --> 02:45.860
to make a trip to Amsterdam with Hazel and her mother to meet Van Houten.

02:45.860 --> 02:49.940
But when they finally meet Van Houten, the two find not the kind, empathetic author that

02:49.940 --> 02:53.900
they imagined, but a drunken misanthrope who refuses to answer their questions.

02:53.900 --> 02:58.060
"'I can no more tell you what happens to her than I can tell you what becomes of Proust's

02:58.060 --> 03:02.340
narrator, or Holden Caulfield's sister, or Huckleberry Finn after he lights out for the

03:02.340 --> 03:03.340
territories.'

03:03.340 --> 03:06.740
"'What happens after the book ends is nothing,' he insists.

03:06.740 --> 03:08.180
"'The book is fiction.

03:08.180 --> 03:09.180
It didn't happen.

03:09.180 --> 03:10.460
It's not real.'

03:10.460 --> 03:12.580
To which a livid Hazel Grace responds,

03:12.580 --> 03:13.580
"'Bullshit!

03:13.580 --> 03:15.020
That's bullshit!

03:15.020 --> 03:16.100
Just tell me!

03:16.100 --> 03:18.140
Make something up!''

03:18.140 --> 03:21.700
Hazel has tied the idea that there is life for these characters after the book ends with

03:21.700 --> 03:23.020
her own narrative.

03:23.020 --> 03:27.300
She needs to believe that there is a life for these characters beyond the text.

03:27.300 --> 03:31.660
Because she sees so much of herself in the text, right down to the protagonist living

03:31.660 --> 03:33.280
with terminal cancer.

03:33.280 --> 03:36.820
But in the end, the author of her favorite book has no answer for her.

03:36.820 --> 03:41.340
And when, months later, feeling guilty about the way their interaction had ended, Van Houten

03:41.340 --> 03:43.020
does come up with an answer.

03:43.020 --> 03:45.140
But Hazel no longer wants to know.

03:45.140 --> 03:49.420
So neither she, nor we, the reader, find out the fictional author's intent.

03:49.420 --> 03:52.980
Furthermore, The Fault in Our Stars itself has an ambiguous ending.

03:52.980 --> 03:55.820
We do not find out what becomes of Hazel Grace.

03:55.820 --> 03:59.380
How much longer, if at all, Hazel survives her disease.

03:59.380 --> 04:03.140
As a solitary text unto itself, The Fault in Our Stars could be read as an argument

04:03.140 --> 04:05.140
in favor of death of the author.

04:05.140 --> 04:09.220
Not only is the author completely unlike what the leads expect him to be, the author has

04:09.220 --> 04:10.780
no answers for them.

04:10.780 --> 04:14.140
Seeking out his authorial intent is an exercise in futility.

04:14.140 --> 04:16.700
The author has emotionally moved on from the book.

04:16.700 --> 04:21.580
And if he does have an answer to Hazel's question, he is not obligated to share it.

04:21.580 --> 04:24.120
But moreover, his intent does not matter.

04:24.120 --> 04:28.420
The book does not speak to Hazel because of the author's intent, but because of the

04:28.420 --> 04:29.420
text itself.

04:29.420 --> 04:32.460
The text, in isolation, is what means so much to Hazel.

04:32.460 --> 04:36.540
As a text, this seems to be the theme of The Fault in Our Stars, that a part of growing

04:36.540 --> 04:42.180
up is to stop looking to other people, especially authors, to explain the meaning behind texts,

04:42.180 --> 04:45.300
but instead to figure out what your own reading is.

04:45.300 --> 04:50.140
Of course, we can't know if this was the author's intent based on the text alone.

04:50.140 --> 04:54.820
Fortunately, thanks to the magic of the internet, we do know exactly what the author thinks.

04:54.820 --> 05:00.220
In a 2014 tweet, Green got a lot of attention and 10,000 retweets with the proclamation

05:00.220 --> 05:02.580
that books belong to their readers.

05:02.580 --> 05:05.740
Green elaborated on that stance in an interview in 2014.

05:05.740 --> 05:09.820
I think authorial intent is pretty irrelevant, and I tend to agree with the school of literary

05:09.820 --> 05:12.780
criticism that proclaims the death of the author.

05:12.780 --> 05:16.500
When pressed on what happens after the end of The Fault in Our Stars in a way that remarkably

05:16.500 --> 05:21.700
mirrors the way Hazel presses Van Houten, Green stated in a now-deleted 2012 blog entry,

05:21.700 --> 05:26.860
I'm different from Peter Van Houten in many important ways, but in this respect, and some

05:26.860 --> 05:28.300
others, we are the same.

05:28.300 --> 05:30.940
I have access to the exact same text that you do.

05:30.940 --> 05:34.900
My thoughts about the world outside of that text are not any more informed or authoritative

05:34.900 --> 05:35.900
than yours.

05:35.900 --> 05:36.900
It's not my book.

05:36.900 --> 05:37.900
It's your book.

05:37.980 --> 05:41.780
I don't make decisions about things that happen outside the text of the book.

05:41.780 --> 05:45.180
I can't read something that isn't there any more than you can.

05:45.180 --> 05:49.380
It's kind of rare to find an author with strong opinions on the concept of death of

05:49.380 --> 05:53.380
the author, who goes out of their way not only to avoid making comments on what happens

05:53.380 --> 05:58.020
outside of the text, but to bake that very notion into the text itself.

05:58.020 --> 06:00.780
But of course, Green's approach is not the only one.

06:00.780 --> 06:04.980
If we're talking about inserting authorial intent into texts well after they have been

06:04.980 --> 06:08.980
published, then we need to talk about the hippogriff in the room.

06:18.980 --> 06:19.980
But first...

06:25.980 --> 06:31.380
In 1967, French literary critic and theorist Roland Barthes published his essay, L'Amour

06:32.380 --> 06:36.300
or The Death of the Author, which was published in English the following year.

06:36.300 --> 06:40.260
The simplest reduction of the essay's thesis is that readers should pull away from the

06:40.260 --> 06:45.140
tenet of traditional literary criticism that focused on authorial intent and instead adopt

06:45.140 --> 06:48.940
a more text-oriented approach that focused on the interaction between the reader and

06:48.940 --> 06:52.380
the text, not between reader and the author.

06:52.380 --> 06:56.940
But to understand how this idea first came about, first we need to put ourselves into

06:56.940 --> 07:00.980
the headspace of French academia in the mid-1960s.

07:00.980 --> 07:06.300
Across academia, but particularly in humanities-related fields like literature, linguistics, philosophy,

07:06.300 --> 07:11.420
and anthropology, we were seeing a trend away from a structuralist methodology, i.e. a methodology

07:11.420 --> 07:16.820
that saw facets of human culture as intrinsically related to a broader, overarching system or

07:16.820 --> 07:17.820
structure.

07:17.820 --> 07:22.420
By the 1960s, academia now saw itself trending towards a post-structuralist point of view,

07:22.420 --> 07:27.460
fueled by thinkers like Foucault, Barthes, and my good friend Derrida.

07:27.460 --> 07:31.460
Some questioned the more binary relationship of structuralism, that you couldn't make

07:31.460 --> 07:37.100
X assumption about X person slash social group slash work of art just because X person came

07:37.100 --> 07:41.820
from a certain place, experienced a certain thing, spoke a certain language, ate a certain

07:41.820 --> 07:44.060
thing for breakfast, etc.

07:44.060 --> 07:49.340
And if it's beginning to sound like post-structuralism involves a lot of complicated French navel-gazing,

07:49.340 --> 07:52.020
academic bloviating, that's because it does.

07:52.020 --> 07:55.780
But for the purposes of keeping this short and sweet, we'll keep our discussion of

07:55.780 --> 08:00.140
post-structuralism contained to where it concerns Barthes and novelists.

08:00.140 --> 08:04.060
In Death of the Author, Barthes argues that writing is that neutral, composite, oblique

08:04.060 --> 08:08.780
space where our subject slips away, the negative where all identity is lost, starting with

08:08.780 --> 08:11.700
the very identity of the body, writing.

08:11.700 --> 08:15.740
In other words, Barthes argues that a piece of text is fundamentally divorced from the

08:15.740 --> 08:16.980
author who made it.

08:16.980 --> 08:20.200
And if it seems like a simple concept now, keep in mind.

08:20.200 --> 08:25.020
In particular to the literary and visual arts, up until the 1960s, much of a creator's

08:25.020 --> 08:29.180
work in academia was examined through a lens that tied together said creator and their

08:29.180 --> 08:30.180
life.

08:30.180 --> 08:33.620
Biography was king in helping to interpret or understand a work of art.

08:33.620 --> 08:36.420
Take for example William Shakespeare's Macbeth.

08:36.420 --> 08:39.540
Traditional readings of the text would argue that an understanding of both Scottish history

08:39.540 --> 08:43.540
and Shakespeare's life are fundamental in understanding the play itself, how it pays

08:43.540 --> 08:47.300
homage to King James I, who was king while it was being written, and how it reflects

08:47.300 --> 08:49.300
the king's relationship to the author.

08:49.300 --> 08:52.700
King James was also the patron of Shakespeare's acting company at the time.

08:52.700 --> 08:56.100
But for Barthes, none of this background information would be pertinent in reading

08:56.100 --> 08:57.100
Macbeth.

08:57.100 --> 09:00.940
Meaning, to Barthes, lies in the language of a text itself, and whatever impressions

09:00.940 --> 09:02.440
the reader creates from it.

09:02.440 --> 09:05.340
The author is less of a god and more of a mere scripter.

09:05.340 --> 09:09.580
And according to Barthes' contemporary Foucault, the work, which once had the duty of providing

09:09.580 --> 09:15.380
immortality, now possesses the right to kill, to be its author's murderer.

09:15.380 --> 09:22.060
Does it though?

09:22.140 --> 09:26.300
French literary theorists in the mid to late 1960s probably weren't too concerned with

09:26.300 --> 09:31.260
pop-cultural fan works and their relation not only to text, but to authorial intent,

09:31.260 --> 09:32.700
and the author's body of work.

09:32.700 --> 09:37.580
In no small part because it was not an organized thing in the way it would be only a decade

09:37.580 --> 09:38.580
later.

09:38.580 --> 09:42.220
But in discussions of death of the author and pop-culture media, the interaction between

09:42.220 --> 09:45.120
author and fans is extremely relevant.

09:45.120 --> 09:49.540
Take for instance a writer like Anne Rice, who takes an unusually hardline stance on

09:49.540 --> 09:52.300
fan works, especially fan fiction.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.780
From Rice's official website,

09:53.780 --> 09:56.060
I do not allow fan fiction.

09:56.060 --> 09:57.600
The characters are copyrighted.

09:57.600 --> 10:01.180
It upsets me terribly to even think about fan fiction with my characters.

10:01.180 --> 10:05.180
I advise my readers to write your own original stories, with your own characters.

10:05.180 --> 10:09.100
It is absolutely essential that you respect my wishes.

10:09.100 --> 10:10.900
Respect the author's wishes, fans!

10:10.900 --> 10:13.340
How dare you make the gay vampires even gayer!

10:13.340 --> 10:15.260
Anne Rice was not f***ing around either.

10:15.260 --> 10:19.380
To be an Anne Rice fandom in the mid-2000s was to play a dangerous game of threats of

10:19.380 --> 10:24.860
C&Ds and of litigation, and the near sum totality of fan works relating to the Vampire Chronicles

10:24.860 --> 10:27.940
existed in locked-down, private, live-journal groups.

10:27.940 --> 10:31.980
I bring up Rice because, on some level, she has a lot in common with Harry Potter author

10:31.980 --> 10:36.180
J.K. Rowling, but in this one crucial regard, they are miles apart.

10:36.180 --> 10:38.420
From the onset of Harry Potter's popularity, J.K.

10:38.420 --> 10:43.140
Rowling has shown an interest in engaging with the fandom and, at most times, been downright

10:43.140 --> 10:48.540
encouraging of fan works, not limited to fan art, fan fiction, fan resource sites,

10:48.540 --> 10:51.020
and other things created by her audience.

10:51.020 --> 10:53.420
Said Rowling's agent at Christopher Little Publishing,

10:53.420 --> 10:57.300
J.K. Rowling's reaction is that she is very flattered by the fact that there is such great

10:57.300 --> 11:02.220
interest in her Harry Potter series, and that people take the time to write their own stories.

11:02.220 --> 11:06.020
So at a surface level, this seems like an ideal creator-audience relationship.

11:06.020 --> 11:09.220
Your favorite author is not only fine with you and your Tumblr friends writing stories

11:09.220 --> 11:13.140
about her characters, but she's an open book when it comes to answering any and all pedantic

11:13.140 --> 11:15.620
nerd questions you might have about your faves.

11:15.620 --> 11:17.700
What could go wrong with that?

11:17.700 --> 11:22.860
Well, largely, it's the one thing she has in common with Rice, namely the sense that

11:22.860 --> 11:26.460
they are the masters of the universe that they created as authors.

11:26.460 --> 11:30.180
Ever since she joined Twitter, Rowling has had a tendency to post-scripturally insert

11:30.180 --> 11:35.620
context, meaning, and intent into her text long after the text has been published, which

11:35.620 --> 11:39.260
many fans love, but just as many take issue with.

11:39.260 --> 11:43.720
Not just because of injecting non-textual intent, but because some of that intent comes

11:43.720 --> 11:47.100
laden with...implications.

11:47.100 --> 11:53.040
Like sure, we get that lycanthropy is a stand-in for disease stigmatization, but Rowling double-downing

11:53.040 --> 11:58.220
on it and then explicitly stating that it is a wizarding world AIDS analog while making

11:58.220 --> 12:03.580
one of the main werewolves in the series essentially a child predator with the explicit evil intent

12:03.580 --> 12:06.020
of infecting people with his disease is...

12:06.020 --> 12:11.420
Yikes.

12:11.420 --> 12:14.180
And then there's Dumbledore.

12:14.180 --> 12:18.660
At a public reading of the then-recently published last book in the series, Harry Potter and

12:18.660 --> 12:23.660
the Deathly Hallows, when a fan asked if Dumbledore had ever loved anyone, Rowling responded,

12:23.660 --> 12:28.540
"'My truthful answer to you, I always thought of Dumbledore as gay,' and that added to his

12:28.540 --> 12:31.860
horror when Grindelwald showed himself to be what he was.

12:31.860 --> 12:35.820
To an extent, Dewey's say it excused Dumbledore a little more because falling in love can

12:35.820 --> 12:41.220
blind us to an extent, but he met someone as brilliant as he was, and, rather like Bellatrix,

12:41.220 --> 12:46.100
he was very drawn to this brilliant person and horribly, terribly let down by him."

12:46.100 --> 12:49.360
She added, "'Yeah, that's always how I saw Dumbledore.'

12:49.360 --> 12:55.340
And even in 2007, that kind of intent declaration was already begging the question if representation

12:55.340 --> 12:59.940
just for representation's sake, especially when there is no actual reference in the text

12:59.940 --> 13:05.100
to Dumbledore's sexuality, was actually helpful, or if it was just shoehorn tokenizing for

13:05.100 --> 13:07.380
the sake of staying relevant.

13:07.380 --> 13:12.140
It is, in effect, claiming representation without having to do any of the work of including

13:12.140 --> 13:16.180
it in the text because, hey, authorial intent.'

13:16.180 --> 13:21.420
And yet, after all this, despite multiple opportunities to codify Dumbledore's sexuality

13:21.420 --> 13:25.140
into the actual text, she still hasn't done it.

13:25.140 --> 13:28.820
Rowling had the opportunity to actually codify this into later texts, as she is the sole

13:28.820 --> 13:33.260
credited writer for both Fantastic Beasts movies, the latter of which touches directly

13:33.260 --> 13:38.980
on Dumbledore's angst over his relationship with Grendelwald, but...

13:38.980 --> 13:39.980
No homo.

13:39.980 --> 13:44.580
LGBT representation in the Harry Potterverse exists only in the paratext, in the authorial

13:44.580 --> 13:45.580
intent.

13:45.580 --> 13:48.740
Therefore, according to Bart, it does not exist at all.

13:48.740 --> 13:53.340
That said, of course authorial intent influences fan culture and inevitably creeps into the

13:53.340 --> 13:55.020
way people read the text.

13:55.020 --> 13:59.300
People take authorial intent as word of God, and use it to shut down readings that conflict

13:59.300 --> 14:02.220
with the authorial's post-scriptural intent.

14:02.220 --> 14:04.500
And that kind of sucks.

14:04.500 --> 14:08.540
It's all well and good and valid to restrict the discourse on the Harry Potter series to

14:08.540 --> 14:13.180
the text itself, and not what the author says about the text, but here's the thing.

14:13.180 --> 14:17.180
That's neither how consuming art nor human nature works.

14:17.180 --> 14:21.980
Text is inevitably consumed with paratext, and paratext influences the way the reader

14:21.980 --> 14:23.980
interprets the text.

14:23.980 --> 14:29.060
Simply knowing the discourse around Harry Potter influences the way you read Harry Potter,

14:29.060 --> 14:39.820
whether you want it to or not.

14:39.820 --> 14:45.300
In literary theory, paratext refers to materials supplied by authors, editors, printers, and

14:45.300 --> 14:46.460
publishers.

14:46.460 --> 14:50.620
This concept has more recently expanded to anything relating to the text, ranging all

14:50.700 --> 14:55.780
the way from cultural context to personal brand to size and nature of online platform

14:55.780 --> 14:59.180
and, most importantly, to personal identity.

14:59.180 --> 15:03.340
It's not that trying to apply Barthes' idea is invalid, but that given the way culture

15:03.340 --> 15:07.900
is trending and how the focus on personal brand and identity is only increasing, even

15:07.900 --> 15:12.940
an author that tries to let their work speak for itself can never really die.

15:12.940 --> 15:15.580
Foucault was actually way more hardcore than Barthes was.

15:15.580 --> 15:20.340
Where Barthes stuck to literary theory, Foucault saw the author as a bigger problem within

15:20.340 --> 15:24.580
a wider system of thought who got in the way of the discourse.

15:24.580 --> 15:29.220
To Foucault, the author is an ideological figure, that people assign meaning to the

15:29.220 --> 15:33.420
author's text just by virtue of who is saying it, rather than the meaning inherent in the

15:33.420 --> 15:34.500
text.

15:34.500 --> 15:38.580
But Foucault considered the decree that the author has disappeared to be an empty one

15:38.580 --> 15:44.780
without praxis, and stated that we must locate the space left empty by the author's disappearance,

15:44.780 --> 15:48.860
follow the distribution of gaps and breaches, and watch for openings this disappearance

15:48.860 --> 15:50.220
uncovers.

15:50.220 --> 15:55.660
In the year of our lord 2018, we call that thing personal brand.

15:55.660 --> 16:00.780
And oh, your precious discourse has indeed been overtaken by cults of personality fifty

16:00.780 --> 16:01.900
years later.

16:01.900 --> 16:06.300
Fifty years later, the work does not possess the right to kill, to be its author's murderer,

16:06.300 --> 16:10.780
because the work will always be tied to the brand, and in that brand lies a certain sort

16:10.780 --> 16:12.580
of immortality.

16:12.580 --> 16:15.100
What is brand can never die.

16:15.100 --> 16:19.560
Foucault was a big proponent not only of shedding personal identity as it pertained to works,

16:19.560 --> 16:21.760
but all the trappings of identity.

16:21.760 --> 16:25.480
We would no longer hear the questions that have been rehashed for so long.

16:25.480 --> 16:26.880
Who really spoke?

16:26.880 --> 16:29.200
Is it really he and not someone else?

16:29.200 --> 16:31.680
With what authenticity or originality?

16:31.680 --> 16:35.960
And what part of his deepest self did he express in his discourse?

16:35.960 --> 16:41.640
What difference does it make who is speaking?

16:41.640 --> 16:46.280
How one person of one gender or one race in one time and one place reads Macbeth will

16:46.360 --> 16:50.280
be read way differently than how someone else in completely different circumstances will

16:50.280 --> 16:51.280
read it.

16:51.280 --> 16:52.720
Same with who writes it.

16:52.720 --> 16:56.080
And this is a huge shortcoming of Death of the Author in general.

16:56.080 --> 16:59.880
It assumes that all people from all backgrounds have equal opportunity.

16:59.880 --> 17:00.880
They don't.

17:00.880 --> 17:05.120
And that all texts have equal opportunity for exposure based on the merit of the text.

17:05.120 --> 17:06.120
They don't.

17:06.120 --> 17:10.000
In a perfect world, Foucault would be right, and everyone would have equal opportunity

17:10.000 --> 17:14.200
and all texts would be judged on their own merit and not tied to either the author's

17:14.200 --> 17:16.840
identity or their body of work.

17:16.840 --> 17:19.360
But we don't live in a perfect world, Michel.

17:19.360 --> 17:24.280
Therefore, Foucault's ideas, and to a lesser extent, Barth's, can really only exist in

17:24.280 --> 17:29.240
the world of pure theory, because who tells what story, what their background is, and

17:29.240 --> 17:34.160
why they are telling it matters to readers, and is only mattering more and more as time

17:34.160 --> 17:40.560
marches on.

17:40.560 --> 17:44.640
If you read The Fault in Our Stars, independent of any paratext, and not reading the author's

17:44.640 --> 17:50.360
note, all you know about the book is that it was written by...a man.

17:50.360 --> 17:51.600
Probably.

17:51.600 --> 17:54.360
That is as pure a reading as you are going to get.

17:54.360 --> 17:57.220
But of course, this is not the reading most people had.

17:57.220 --> 18:02.480
Most people knew the paratext, because the author had a platform, and a very large one.

18:02.480 --> 18:08.440
The author puts on a friendly affect for his young, largely teenage audience every Tuesday.

18:08.440 --> 18:12.440
Then you find out that the author was inspired to write the text, in part, because of an

18:12.440 --> 18:16.240
actual human person who lived and died at the age of 16.

18:16.240 --> 18:21.120
A human person who was also a YouTuber, who the author became friends with, in large part

18:21.120 --> 18:23.120
because she was his fan.

18:28.320 --> 18:33.360
This is not intent, but it is paratext, and it does influence the reading of the book.

18:33.360 --> 18:37.280
As The Fault in Our Stars blew up in popularity, so too did the backlash.

18:37.280 --> 18:40.360
Who are you, John Green, to even write this story?

18:40.360 --> 18:45.660
Does it make it more legitimate that he knew Esther Earle, or does that make it more exploitative?

18:45.660 --> 18:47.840
Is the whole enterprise exploitative?

18:47.840 --> 18:52.360
In the years that followed, as The Fault in Our Stars continued to sell incredibly well,

18:52.360 --> 18:57.560
the discourse began to focus on the author's identity, and the trend of so-called sick

18:57.560 --> 19:00.280
lit that the novel helped popularize.

19:00.280 --> 19:03.280
Which is to say nothing of the content of the novel itself.

19:03.280 --> 19:07.080
People started to get upset about the fact that Hazel and Augustus share their first

19:07.080 --> 19:10.160
kiss at the Anne Frank house.

19:10.160 --> 19:12.040
And there are sex scenes in this book.

19:12.040 --> 19:16.280
What kind of a grown-ass man writes sex scenes between two dying teenagers?

19:16.280 --> 19:18.280
Who's that?

19:27.280 --> 19:28.280
Oh, shit.

19:33.280 --> 19:43.040
The Fault in Our Stars was a 2012 novel written by me, John Green, in which I, John Green,

19:43.040 --> 19:47.280
am accidentally a character, kind of, which is what this video is about, sort of.

19:47.280 --> 19:49.280
I said I'm not interested.

19:49.280 --> 19:50.280
But you promised!

19:50.280 --> 19:51.280
Nothing happens!

19:51.280 --> 19:52.280
They're fiction!

19:52.280 --> 19:55.280
They cease to exist the moment the novel ends.

19:55.280 --> 19:56.280
But they can't!

19:56.280 --> 20:01.280
What inspired, like, this idea that Van Houten was a reflection of you, that you're your

20:01.280 --> 20:02.280
ugliest self?

20:03.280 --> 20:04.280
Peter!

20:11.280 --> 20:15.280
Well, I mean, I think before The Fault in Our Stars was published, I was interested

20:15.280 --> 20:20.280
in the questions that I ended up writing about in The Fault in Our Stars because I'd been

20:20.280 --> 20:27.280
asked thousands of times what happened to certain characters in my book, Looking for

20:27.280 --> 20:28.280
Alaska.

20:28.280 --> 20:34.280
And I started to understand that my response to that, my, like, somewhat defensive response

20:34.280 --> 20:40.280
to that of, like, I'm not going to tell you, obviously I, you know, obviously I wanted

20:40.280 --> 20:44.280
it to be ambiguous in the story and I still want it to be ambiguous, like, I started to

20:44.280 --> 20:50.280
understand that that defensiveness that I had was misplaced, ultimately.

20:50.280 --> 20:56.280
And so when people ask me the same question about Hazel or about The Fault in Our Stars,

20:56.280 --> 20:58.280
I do think of it very differently now.

20:58.280 --> 20:59.280
I feel much less defensive.

20:59.280 --> 21:04.280
I still don't feel like I have answers for them, but I understand the question.

21:04.280 --> 21:10.280
I understood that when people read books about people reading books, they inevitably put

21:10.280 --> 21:15.280
the author of the book, especially if that person is a public figure, into the story.

21:15.280 --> 21:16.280
Right?

21:16.280 --> 21:21.280
Like, I remember being a kid and reading Catcher in the Rye and putting J.D. Salinger into

21:21.280 --> 21:22.280
that story.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.280
I couldn't help myself.

21:23.280 --> 21:26.280
You know that song, If a Body Catch a Body Coming Through the Rye?

21:26.280 --> 21:30.280
I'd like, it's If a Body Meet a Body Coming Through the Rye.

21:30.280 --> 21:38.280
I felt like there was no way to write about writing without me being a character in the

21:38.280 --> 21:39.280
story in some way.

21:39.280 --> 21:42.280
Like, I was writing those parts of that book in 2010, 2011.

21:42.280 --> 21:45.280
I understood by that time that I had a public life.

21:46.280 --> 21:54.280
And, you know, in my own life, when I was a kid, I read books with the authors as characters

21:54.280 --> 21:55.280
in them.

21:55.280 --> 21:58.280
I might have even known that I shouldn't, but I couldn't help myself.

21:58.280 --> 22:00.280
Like, we live in a personality-driven culture.

22:00.280 --> 22:01.280
Even then we did.

22:08.280 --> 22:12.280
A lot of people are only going to read John Green books because they have this parasocial

22:12.280 --> 22:14.280
relationship with John Green.

22:14.280 --> 22:17.280
And, you know, that's not invalid.

22:17.280 --> 22:19.280
I played into it, right?

22:19.280 --> 22:23.280
Like, it's not like I tried to avoid having a public life.

22:23.280 --> 22:26.280
Like, I had an email address that they could Google.

22:26.280 --> 22:29.280
I had a YouTube channel where they could comment.

22:29.280 --> 22:34.280
Like, where did I get off saying that's an inappropriate question to ask this person

22:34.280 --> 22:36.280
who has a Twitter?

22:45.280 --> 22:46.280
That's the end of chapter one.

22:46.280 --> 22:49.280
I wonder if there's just something about human nature.

22:49.280 --> 22:57.280
If you read someone who tells a fiction, you feel connected to them, whether you know anything

22:57.280 --> 22:59.280
about their lives or not.

22:59.280 --> 23:06.280
Yeah, you at least feel a connection to the way that they imagine something, which is

23:06.280 --> 23:08.280
intimate in a way.

23:08.280 --> 23:11.280
And I don't know that there's any getting around that.

23:12.280 --> 23:15.280
So Nerdfighters, join with Esther and me and tell someone you love that you love them today.

23:15.280 --> 23:21.280
And so the question for me is how do authors interact with stories that they've invented

23:21.280 --> 23:22.280
in this time?

23:22.280 --> 23:30.280
I feel like the idea of death of the author kind of stemmed partially from this culture

23:30.280 --> 23:34.280
that was very absolute and Bart kind of wanted to kill absolutes.

23:34.280 --> 23:37.280
But in return it kind of created a different absolute.

23:37.280 --> 23:43.280
I used to believe that the author should disappear insofar as possible from the text

23:43.280 --> 23:49.280
and that the responsibility of the reader was to read the text and never think about

23:49.280 --> 23:50.280
the author.

23:50.280 --> 23:54.280
You know, like, I had this period in high school where I read everything in the context

23:54.280 --> 23:55.280
of the author.

23:55.280 --> 24:00.280
And then I had this long period of maybe 10 or 15 years where I tried to read nothing

24:00.280 --> 24:02.280
in the context of the author.

24:02.280 --> 24:07.280
And what I have arrived at at the moment, which I'm sure I will disavow in due time,

24:07.280 --> 24:14.280
is that there is no way for an author's brand not to participate in the text if that author

24:14.280 --> 24:17.280
has a public life or even if that author doesn't.

24:17.280 --> 24:18.280
Right?

24:18.280 --> 24:22.280
Like, J.D. Salinger famously did not have a public life, but he is all over those books.

24:22.280 --> 24:26.280
And, like, when people read them, they read them in the context of J.D. Salinger.

24:27.280 --> 24:31.280
And I feel like the absolutes in reading text create this problem where you're either constantly

24:31.280 --> 24:36.280
guessing the author's intent or you're actively trying to divorce yourself from everything

24:36.280 --> 24:39.280
you know about the world around you and the author.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.280
And I just don't think that's realistic or helpful.

24:41.280 --> 24:46.280
The first Amazing Night of Amazing I spent with Esther was at LeakyCon, a Harry Potter

24:46.280 --> 24:47.280
conference.

24:47.280 --> 24:50.280
And after all, if it weren't for Harry Potter, I would have no Esther.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.280
And also, there probably wouldn't be a Nerdfighteria.

24:52.280 --> 24:57.280
The more you know about my work, the more you know about my friendship with Esther.

24:57.280 --> 24:58.280
Ow!

24:58.280 --> 24:59.280
Too much.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.280
Too much.

25:00.280 --> 25:01.280
That was a headbutt.

25:01.280 --> 25:02.280
Yeah.

25:02.280 --> 25:09.280
The more you see me in that story, my hope is that the book works if you don't see me

25:09.280 --> 25:10.280
in the story.

25:10.280 --> 25:17.280
And I would honestly feel like the book failed if it needed me to be successful.

25:18.280 --> 25:23.280
But at the same time, I am definitely aware of the fact that many of the people who read

25:23.280 --> 25:26.280
it do see me in it.

25:26.280 --> 25:30.280
I mean, that's why I wrote that author's note at the beginning was I wanted to try

25:30.280 --> 25:35.280
to protect, insofar as possible, this is a little naive in retrospect, but I wanted to

25:35.280 --> 25:40.280
try to protect the friendships that I'd had that were important to me, that had influenced

25:40.280 --> 25:41.280
the story.

25:41.280 --> 25:43.280
I wanted to keep them mine.

25:44.280 --> 25:46.280
And that proved to be impossible.

25:46.280 --> 25:51.280
And now I read that author's note and I think, oh, that's quite sweet that that author thought

25:51.280 --> 25:57.280
that just putting a note in the beginning that says, don't read this autobiographically

25:57.280 --> 25:58.280
is going to work.

26:02.280 --> 26:08.280
The Fault in Our Stars is a 2012 novel written by John Green in which two children go to

26:09.280 --> 26:14.280
great lengths to find out what happens after the ambiguous ending of the protagonist Hazel's

26:14.280 --> 26:15.280
favorite book.

26:15.280 --> 26:20.280
The way they do this is to seek out the notoriously reclusive author and find out the answer from

26:20.280 --> 26:21.280
him.

26:21.280 --> 26:24.280
But the entire idea is flawed from the get-go.

26:24.280 --> 26:29.280
Not only does her hero let her down, she does not find her answer because there is none.

26:29.280 --> 26:32.280
And that is a central theme of the text.

26:32.280 --> 26:33.280
Sometimes there is no answer.

26:33.280 --> 26:38.280
The universe is chaotic, life is unpredictable, and you have no control of when you will die.

26:38.280 --> 26:43.280
And when you do die, you will not know what becomes of your loved ones.

26:43.280 --> 26:47.280
In seeking out the authorial intent behind a work of fiction, the two leads are trying

26:47.280 --> 26:52.280
to gain a sense of control in a chaotic universe, the sense that there is indeed an author of

26:52.280 --> 26:56.280
sorts to life, as they do not feel that they are the authors of their own stories, that

26:56.280 --> 27:00.280
they do not have control over their own fates.

27:00.280 --> 27:02.280
And indeed, they do not.

27:02.280 --> 27:07.280
But in this case, letting go of that desire for a sense of control is a part of growing

27:07.280 --> 27:11.280
up, which, ironically, neither of these characters will get to do.

27:11.280 --> 27:15.280
They must mature into adults while never living to become adults.

27:15.280 --> 27:20.280
This is reflective not only of how we consume media and the way media can genuinely touch

27:20.280 --> 27:26.280
and inspire people, but also of a very understandable and human desire to transform that media.

27:26.280 --> 27:31.280
Narratives give us a sense of control in a world that is generally chaotic and unpredictable.

27:31.280 --> 27:34.280
We need narratives to make sense of the world that we live in.

27:34.280 --> 27:38.280
But that does not mean that we have control over the narrative.

27:38.280 --> 27:43.280
The character arcs of both Hazel and Augustus are defined by letting go of that desire for

27:43.280 --> 27:49.280
control of their own narratives, and accepting that life, short though it is, just doesn't

27:49.280 --> 27:53.280
work that way, no matter how much they wish it did.

27:53.280 --> 27:57.280
But, that's just my reading.

28:01.280 --> 28:10.280
Listen, Lindsay, what would it look like if we all listened more?

28:10.280 --> 28:11.280
I don't know, John.

28:11.280 --> 28:12.280
What would it look like?

28:12.280 --> 28:13.280
It would look like a better world, Lindsay.

28:13.280 --> 28:17.280
And listening to audiobooks motivates us, it inspires us, and it can even bring us closer

28:17.280 --> 28:18.280
together.

28:18.280 --> 28:22.280
There is no better place to listen than Audible, because now Audible members get even more

28:22.280 --> 28:27.280
exclusive audio fitness programs, audiobooks, Audible Originals, and more.

28:27.280 --> 28:31.280
Audible has the largest selection of audiobooks on the planet, and now with Audible Originals,

28:31.280 --> 28:35.280
the selection has gotten even more custom, with content made for members.

28:35.280 --> 28:38.280
Host, pick a book to discuss that resonates with your audience.

28:38.280 --> 28:40.280
I recommend Turtles All The Way Down by me.

28:40.280 --> 28:41.280
It's read by Kate Rudd.

28:41.280 --> 28:43.280
She's so good at that job.

28:43.280 --> 28:44.280
Or this one.

28:44.280 --> 28:45.280
This one.

28:45.280 --> 28:47.280
Also narrated by Kate Rudd.

28:47.280 --> 28:48.280
She did a great job.

28:48.280 --> 28:51.280
She did such a good job that they hired her to do this one, too.

28:51.280 --> 28:52.280
You should just get both of them.

28:52.280 --> 28:54.280
It's only two Audible credits.

28:54.280 --> 28:55.280
Yeah.

28:55.280 --> 28:56.280
One of them's free.

28:56.280 --> 28:59.280
Go to audible.com slash lindsayellis.

28:59.280 --> 29:01.280
You can do it with audiobooks.

29:01.280 --> 29:03.280
Start a 30-day trial, and your first audiobook is free.

29:03.280 --> 29:06.280
You can go to audible.com slash lindsayellis.

29:06.280 --> 29:09.280
That's audible.com slash lindsayellis to get your first audiobook free.

29:09.280 --> 29:14.280
Or, or, or, or text lindsayellis to 500-500.

29:14.280 --> 29:23.280
That's Lindsay with an A, Ellis with an E and an I, two L's and an S, to 500-500 and

29:23.280 --> 29:27.280
get your first audiobook free and make it turtles all the way down.

29:27.280 --> 29:29.280
That way Lindsay and I win.

29:53.280 --> 30:06.280
The Fault in Our Stars was a 2012 novel written by Lindsay Ellis.

30:06.280 --> 30:08.280
I did it.

30:08.280 --> 30:09.280
She did a good job.

30:09.280 --> 30:10.280
Yay.

30:10.280 --> 30:12.280
She doesn't get any of the royalties.

30:12.280 --> 30:14.280
I get the credit, apparently.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.280
Yeah, but the money is mine.
