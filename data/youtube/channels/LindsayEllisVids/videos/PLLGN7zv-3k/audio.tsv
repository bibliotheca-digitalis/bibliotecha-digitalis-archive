0	4620	Today I want to talk about a simple yet important element in narrative structure
4620	10140	known as planting and payoff. The most basic way to think of planting and payoff
10140	15460	is the idea of Chekhov's gun. In an 1889 letter Chekhov wrote one must never
15460	19980	place a loaded rifle on the stage if it isn't going to go off. Chekhov believed
19980	24300	that all narrative elements in a story should be both necessary and irreplaceable.
24300	30300	Well, I've only got four for big boy here so he's all but useless. Not all movies adhere to
30300	37300	this principle. Some just meander around and do whatever, but good ones do.
37300	41820	You've got two left! And I know that a lot of this is a matter of taste, but in a broader sense
41820	45700	audience satisfaction derives in part from the way that narrative elements are
45700	49820	introduced and paid off. Some plantings are obvious with an inferred, this is
49820	54420	going to pay off later, basically emblazoned into the sky, and others are
54420	58740	more subtle. But for a full satisfying narrative, generally when an element is
58740	67700	introduced, be it plot driven, thematic, or physical, it should pay off in some way
67700	72740	and also tie in to all the other narrative elements.
80540	85740	Whenever people, correctly, use the term deus ex machina, it isn't so much because
85740	90740	the salvation element is convenient, but because it had not been planted or set
90740	95300	up. You don't call Max's method for saving Furiosa at the end of Mad Max Fury
95300	99380	Road a deus ex machina because the means are so thoroughly planted throughout
99380	102660	the narrative, especially in the first act of the film, so that when the
102660	109380	vulvalini says, the audience immediately knows what the solution is because Max's
109380	112700	universal donor blood has been repeatedly established. The importance of
112700	116020	how narrative information is planted and paid off is best demonstrated when it is
116020	123100	done poorly or not at all. Just because an element is planted doesn't mean the
123100	131580	payoff, to put it diplomatically, is necessarily narratively satisfying.
131580	135860	Narrative elements can be introduced in a manner of ways. Dialogue is a common
135860	141780	one, but this is film, it is never as simple as just a line of dialogue
141780	146620	introducing an element. The framing, the color, the camera movement, the sound
146620	151500	design, all of these elements imbue meaning. So pacing matters, but so too
151500	156700	does order. To pick on Zack Snyder, again, because he is really bad at this
156700	160180	particular thing, the order in which you place your narrative elements matters.
160180	165500	For example, the idea that Clark should hide his alien self in Man of Steel.
165500	178340	The problem with introducing this conflict is that tension of will he or
178340	182860	won't he use his powers to help people has already been resolved. It's resolved
182860	187280	in the very first scene we see adult Clark. So we have the planting after the
187280	192220	payoff. The answer is given before the question. The DC Universe films, Man of
192380	196740	especially, rely way too heavily on what the audience already knows about Superman
196740	202140	from their basic experiences of living in the world, rather than setting up its
202140	205660	own internal narrative about this character. The trick with narrative is to
205660	209140	plant elements early and eventually pay them off in a way that doesn't feel
209140	217500	obvious or contrived. It needs to make sense and it needs to feel organic.
217500	220700	Information can be imparted through dialogue, but I'm more interested in
220700	225060	visual and sound information, so I wanted to do a brief overview of three
225060	230140	non-dialogue elements from Mad Max Fury Road. The silver spray, Max's blood, and
230140	237380	Max's boot. Your basic narrative planting and payoff will include a setup, a
237380	243940	reminder, and the payoff. Though depending on how closely together within the
243940	248860	narrative the planting and the payoff occurs, we may not need a reminder. Let's
248860	259060	look at the war boy spray. This nameless character is fatally wounded. The sound
259060	268100	drops out, the film slows down, all of the characters pay attention to this guy,
269740	275020	and it draws audience attention to the fact that this is important information
275060	280220	and you need to pay attention. First we get the visual element, the spray,
280220	293220	followed by a dialogue element, and then this. Information acquired. Silver mouth
293220	296540	spray signifies that a pseudo-religious suicide mission is about to take place,
296540	300660	the witness call and response imparting that to these guys, this is the most
300740	305100	badass thing ever, and also communal. They are judged on their performance. See
305100	314260	these guys are impressed. Slit, not so much. So the payoff for this comes not far down
314260	318740	the road. Nux is the only war boy left who can stop Furiosa after she runs this
318740	323020	vehicle into the hurricane. This further spurs him on, he wants to be like these
323020	330060	guys. So without having to say anything so on-the-nose as it's suicide bomb time,
330220	339140	when Nux starts doing this, we, like Max, immediately intuit his intentions. So what
339140	342140	I find remarkable about the way this culture is explained to the audience,
342140	345940	despite this world and culture being so removed and alien from our own, is that
345940	348860	we don't really need some fish-out-of-water character having the
348860	352700	details of the universe being explained to them. In fact all you see around you
352700	356460	has been taken from the lessons garnered from the historical documents.
356460	362980	Is this a spaceship? The audience gets a lot of information about this culture,
362980	366620	the universe, and how it works, but it's seen only through the eyes of people who
366620	370940	already live in it. They all know what the spray means. A clear planting of a
370940	374820	narrative element, followed by the payoff a few minutes later. But with the boot, a
374820	378540	bit more time passes between planting and payoff, therefore with this one we
378540	384780	need a reminder. An important but subtle theme in Mad Max Fury Road is that of
384780	391060	forgiveness when and if circumstance allows. And it is most explicitly shown
391060	395740	through the relationship of Max and Nux. Nux unquestioningly objectifies Max,
395740	400540	using him as an ornament and violating his body autonomy by stealing his blood.
400540	404300	This is not done out of malice, but simply because it doesn't occur to Nux
404300	410020	that this might be wrong. This shot is a turning point when they first look at
410020	413740	each other, and this is also the beginning of Nux's character arc. For one
413740	418220	hair of a second he sees Max as human. Then the setup thematically in the form
418220	424060	of the boot. Which brings us to narrative element slash metaphor number whatever.
424060	431300	Slit gets kicked off the car by Max. Slit steals Max's boot. The setup. When Max
431300	435060	finds Nux unconscious after they wrecked the car, Max steals Nux's boot.
435060	439700	The reminder. And then the payoff comes far later. Nux is learning to build
439700	445340	empathy, has decided to switch sides. The payoff. Max steals a boot from the
445340	450100	Bullet Farmer's gang, gifts it to Nux. A practical element. Now Nux has two shoes
450100	454140	again, that's nice. But also thematic. It shows that Max forgives Nux, and on a
454140	457380	deeper level that completion points towards Nux finding his own sense of
457380	461860	completion by joining Furiosa's ragtag band. A practical thread in the form of a
461860	465220	prop, sure, but like everything in this movie it has a deeper level than that. In
465220	469300	this case one of forgiveness. Max and Nux barely speak a word to each other
469300	473380	throughout the entire film, but in this simple gesture we get all that we need
473380	477140	to know. Max and Nux would have no concrete connection except for that boot.
477140	481580	Besides the boot, the only thing they have is Max's blood. And Max's blood is a
481580	485980	huge plot point, so I'm not going to go into all of the ways it is set up and
485980	489660	paid off. It establishes not only that this is effectively a culture comprised
489660	495980	of mostly the sick and the dying, but that Max is a universal donor. A setup that
495980	499340	pays off in a very big way at the end of the movie, when Max gives Furiosa a
499340	503740	direct blood transfusion. The blood tube is important here. First the setup, the
503740	507940	reminder, and finally the payoff. But there's another setup that's one of my
507940	511860	favorites in the film, because it's like a sub setup. And it uses not only visuals
511860	515860	to get across the information, and not only sound editing, but sound mixing as
515860	530460	well. Let's break that down. We're going to talk a little bit about sound mixing.
530460	535140	Max rises from the earth, like lava from a volcano, and first we get that
535140	542140	heartbeat sound. Normally that's a pretty big cliche in sound design, and they tell
542140	545740	you to avoid that, like on your first day as a film student. But since here it's
545740	549740	literally his own heartbeat he's hearing, we'll give it a pass. But it
549740	554460	isn't just that. Max's disorientation is intercut with shots of lava erupting, and
554460	561460	corresponding sound effects that come with it. These sounds are mixed using a
561460	565300	low-pass filter, a type of audio EQ filter that cuts off higher frequency
565300	573660	sounds. The easy way to remember it is that low frequencies pass on through,
573700	578220	therefore it's a low pass, and high frequencies are cut out. Cutting off
578220	584860	these frequencies gives almost the sensation of being underwater. Lower
584860	587940	frequency sounds are more tenacious at traveling through liquids and solids.
587940	594300	This is why bassy noises travel through walls better than piano music.
596500	600900	Any sounds that are coming from inside rather than outside are going to have
600900	604700	their higher frequencies cut off more, just by virtue of where the sound is
604700	611220	coming from and the mediums it has to move through. So Max's pain and
611220	615380	disorientation in this scene is shown by the higher frequency sounds in the scene
615380	620460	being cut out. And the tension is relieved when we reintroduce higher
620460	627340	frequencies back into the soundscape. The hiss of air escaping and the air tone of
627340	630620	the atmosphere. See I focus on the sound here because the framing doesn't really
630620	634620	get across the element that is being set up. That of an air bubble in Max's
634620	640300	body and the pain it's causing him. If you watch this scene with the sound off,
645300	649260	you can't really tell what's going on. It just kind of looks like the needle was
649260	656740	annoying him. But with the sound on, oh. Removing the needle releases the air
656740	659900	bubble. This may not seem like planted information, but it pays off at the very
659900	668540	end. Both with the needle and with the air accumulation in the body. It's almost
668540	672580	like the guy who wrote this was a former ER doctor or something. Max doesn't need
672580	675800	to explain what he's doing. We already know what he's doing because the
675800	679780	filmmakers trust the audience enough to intuit what's going on without having to
679780	683460	have it explained to them. The information has been planted and now
683460	687340	it's time to pay it off. The great thing about this movie is that you could go on
687340	691460	for hours about all the ways it uses its medium to maximize its potential.
691460	696940	Because ultimately, that's what this is all about. How to best tell a story using
696940	701500	your given medium. Mad Max Fury Road isn't perfect, but it's about as close
701500	706380	to perfect as a movie made by humans is going to get. I mean, I could go on. Hell,
706380	710580	I could go on about the sound design alone for another hour. But that's enough
710580	715860	for now. Thank you for watching. Like, share, subscribe, witness!
