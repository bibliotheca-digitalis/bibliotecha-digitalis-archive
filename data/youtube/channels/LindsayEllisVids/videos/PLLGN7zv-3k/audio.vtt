00:00.000 --> 00:04.620
Today I want to talk about a simple yet important element in narrative structure

00:04.620 --> 00:10.140
known as planting and payoff. The most basic way to think of planting and payoff

00:10.140 --> 00:15.460
is the idea of Chekhov's gun. In an 1889 letter Chekhov wrote one must never

00:15.460 --> 00:19.980
place a loaded rifle on the stage if it isn't going to go off. Chekhov believed

00:19.980 --> 00:24.300
that all narrative elements in a story should be both necessary and irreplaceable.

00:24.300 --> 00:30.300
Well, I've only got four for big boy here so he's all but useless. Not all movies adhere to

00:30.300 --> 00:37.300
this principle. Some just meander around and do whatever, but good ones do.

00:37.300 --> 00:41.820
You've got two left! And I know that a lot of this is a matter of taste, but in a broader sense

00:41.820 --> 00:45.700
audience satisfaction derives in part from the way that narrative elements are

00:45.700 --> 00:49.820
introduced and paid off. Some plantings are obvious with an inferred, this is

00:49.820 --> 00:54.420
going to pay off later, basically emblazoned into the sky, and others are

00:54.420 --> 00:58.740
more subtle. But for a full satisfying narrative, generally when an element is

00:58.740 --> 01:07.700
introduced, be it plot driven, thematic, or physical, it should pay off in some way

01:07.700 --> 01:12.740
and also tie in to all the other narrative elements.

01:20.540 --> 01:25.740
Whenever people, correctly, use the term deus ex machina, it isn't so much because

01:25.740 --> 01:30.740
the salvation element is convenient, but because it had not been planted or set

01:30.740 --> 01:35.300
up. You don't call Max's method for saving Furiosa at the end of Mad Max Fury

01:35.300 --> 01:39.380
Road a deus ex machina because the means are so thoroughly planted throughout

01:39.380 --> 01:42.660
the narrative, especially in the first act of the film, so that when the

01:42.660 --> 01:49.380
vulvalini says, the audience immediately knows what the solution is because Max's

01:49.380 --> 01:52.700
universal donor blood has been repeatedly established. The importance of

01:52.700 --> 01:56.020
how narrative information is planted and paid off is best demonstrated when it is

01:56.020 --> 02:03.100
done poorly or not at all. Just because an element is planted doesn't mean the

02:03.100 --> 02:11.580
payoff, to put it diplomatically, is necessarily narratively satisfying.

02:11.580 --> 02:15.860
Narrative elements can be introduced in a manner of ways. Dialogue is a common

02:15.860 --> 02:21.780
one, but this is film, it is never as simple as just a line of dialogue

02:21.780 --> 02:26.620
introducing an element. The framing, the color, the camera movement, the sound

02:26.620 --> 02:31.500
design, all of these elements imbue meaning. So pacing matters, but so too

02:31.500 --> 02:36.700
does order. To pick on Zack Snyder, again, because he is really bad at this

02:36.700 --> 02:40.180
particular thing, the order in which you place your narrative elements matters.

02:40.180 --> 02:45.500
For example, the idea that Clark should hide his alien self in Man of Steel.

02:45.500 --> 02:58.340
The problem with introducing this conflict is that tension of will he or

02:58.340 --> 03:02.860
won't he use his powers to help people has already been resolved. It's resolved

03:02.860 --> 03:07.280
in the very first scene we see adult Clark. So we have the planting after the

03:07.280 --> 03:12.220
payoff. The answer is given before the question. The DC Universe films, Man of

03:12.380 --> 03:16.740
especially, rely way too heavily on what the audience already knows about Superman

03:16.740 --> 03:22.140
from their basic experiences of living in the world, rather than setting up its

03:22.140 --> 03:25.660
own internal narrative about this character. The trick with narrative is to

03:25.660 --> 03:29.140
plant elements early and eventually pay them off in a way that doesn't feel

03:29.140 --> 03:37.500
obvious or contrived. It needs to make sense and it needs to feel organic.

03:37.500 --> 03:40.700
Information can be imparted through dialogue, but I'm more interested in

03:40.700 --> 03:45.060
visual and sound information, so I wanted to do a brief overview of three

03:45.060 --> 03:50.140
non-dialogue elements from Mad Max Fury Road. The silver spray, Max's blood, and

03:50.140 --> 03:57.380
Max's boot. Your basic narrative planting and payoff will include a setup, a

03:57.380 --> 04:03.940
reminder, and the payoff. Though depending on how closely together within the

04:03.940 --> 04:08.860
narrative the planting and the payoff occurs, we may not need a reminder. Let's

04:08.860 --> 04:19.060
look at the war boy spray. This nameless character is fatally wounded. The sound

04:19.060 --> 04:28.100
drops out, the film slows down, all of the characters pay attention to this guy,

04:29.740 --> 04:35.020
and it draws audience attention to the fact that this is important information

04:35.060 --> 04:40.220
and you need to pay attention. First we get the visual element, the spray,

04:40.220 --> 04:53.220
followed by a dialogue element, and then this. Information acquired. Silver mouth

04:53.220 --> 04:56.540
spray signifies that a pseudo-religious suicide mission is about to take place,

04:56.540 --> 05:00.660
the witness call and response imparting that to these guys, this is the most

05:00.740 --> 05:05.100
badass thing ever, and also communal. They are judged on their performance. See

05:05.100 --> 05:14.260
these guys are impressed. Slit, not so much. So the payoff for this comes not far down

05:14.260 --> 05:18.740
the road. Nux is the only war boy left who can stop Furiosa after she runs this

05:18.740 --> 05:23.020
vehicle into the hurricane. This further spurs him on, he wants to be like these

05:23.020 --> 05:30.060
guys. So without having to say anything so on-the-nose as it's suicide bomb time,

05:30.220 --> 05:39.140
when Nux starts doing this, we, like Max, immediately intuit his intentions. So what

05:39.140 --> 05:42.140
I find remarkable about the way this culture is explained to the audience,

05:42.140 --> 05:45.940
despite this world and culture being so removed and alien from our own, is that

05:45.940 --> 05:48.860
we don't really need some fish-out-of-water character having the

05:48.860 --> 05:52.700
details of the universe being explained to them. In fact all you see around you

05:52.700 --> 05:56.460
has been taken from the lessons garnered from the historical documents.

05:56.460 --> 06:02.980
Is this a spaceship? The audience gets a lot of information about this culture,

06:02.980 --> 06:06.620
the universe, and how it works, but it's seen only through the eyes of people who

06:06.620 --> 06:10.940
already live in it. They all know what the spray means. A clear planting of a

06:10.940 --> 06:14.820
narrative element, followed by the payoff a few minutes later. But with the boot, a

06:14.820 --> 06:18.540
bit more time passes between planting and payoff, therefore with this one we

06:18.540 --> 06:24.780
need a reminder. An important but subtle theme in Mad Max Fury Road is that of

06:24.780 --> 06:31.060
forgiveness when and if circumstance allows. And it is most explicitly shown

06:31.060 --> 06:35.740
through the relationship of Max and Nux. Nux unquestioningly objectifies Max,

06:35.740 --> 06:40.540
using him as an ornament and violating his body autonomy by stealing his blood.

06:40.540 --> 06:44.300
This is not done out of malice, but simply because it doesn't occur to Nux

06:44.300 --> 06:50.020
that this might be wrong. This shot is a turning point when they first look at

06:50.020 --> 06:53.740
each other, and this is also the beginning of Nux's character arc. For one

06:53.740 --> 06:58.220
hair of a second he sees Max as human. Then the setup thematically in the form

06:58.220 --> 07:04.060
of the boot. Which brings us to narrative element slash metaphor number whatever.

07:04.060 --> 07:11.300
Slit gets kicked off the car by Max. Slit steals Max's boot. The setup. When Max

07:11.300 --> 07:15.060
finds Nux unconscious after they wrecked the car, Max steals Nux's boot.

07:15.060 --> 07:19.700
The reminder. And then the payoff comes far later. Nux is learning to build

07:19.700 --> 07:25.340
empathy, has decided to switch sides. The payoff. Max steals a boot from the

07:25.340 --> 07:30.100
Bullet Farmer's gang, gifts it to Nux. A practical element. Now Nux has two shoes

07:30.100 --> 07:34.140
again, that's nice. But also thematic. It shows that Max forgives Nux, and on a

07:34.140 --> 07:37.380
deeper level that completion points towards Nux finding his own sense of

07:37.380 --> 07:41.860
completion by joining Furiosa's ragtag band. A practical thread in the form of a

07:41.860 --> 07:45.220
prop, sure, but like everything in this movie it has a deeper level than that. In

07:45.220 --> 07:49.300
this case one of forgiveness. Max and Nux barely speak a word to each other

07:49.300 --> 07:53.380
throughout the entire film, but in this simple gesture we get all that we need

07:53.380 --> 07:57.140
to know. Max and Nux would have no concrete connection except for that boot.

07:57.140 --> 08:01.580
Besides the boot, the only thing they have is Max's blood. And Max's blood is a

08:01.580 --> 08:05.980
huge plot point, so I'm not going to go into all of the ways it is set up and

08:05.980 --> 08:09.660
paid off. It establishes not only that this is effectively a culture comprised

08:09.660 --> 08:15.980
of mostly the sick and the dying, but that Max is a universal donor. A setup that

08:15.980 --> 08:19.340
pays off in a very big way at the end of the movie, when Max gives Furiosa a

08:19.340 --> 08:23.740
direct blood transfusion. The blood tube is important here. First the setup, the

08:23.740 --> 08:27.940
reminder, and finally the payoff. But there's another setup that's one of my

08:27.940 --> 08:31.860
favorites in the film, because it's like a sub setup. And it uses not only visuals

08:31.860 --> 08:35.860
to get across the information, and not only sound editing, but sound mixing as

08:35.860 --> 08:50.460
well. Let's break that down. We're going to talk a little bit about sound mixing.

08:50.460 --> 08:55.140
Max rises from the earth, like lava from a volcano, and first we get that

08:55.140 --> 09:02.140
heartbeat sound. Normally that's a pretty big cliche in sound design, and they tell

09:02.140 --> 09:05.740
you to avoid that, like on your first day as a film student. But since here it's

09:05.740 --> 09:09.740
literally his own heartbeat he's hearing, we'll give it a pass. But it

09:09.740 --> 09:14.460
isn't just that. Max's disorientation is intercut with shots of lava erupting, and

09:14.460 --> 09:21.460
corresponding sound effects that come with it. These sounds are mixed using a

09:21.460 --> 09:25.300
low-pass filter, a type of audio EQ filter that cuts off higher frequency

09:25.300 --> 09:33.660
sounds. The easy way to remember it is that low frequencies pass on through,

09:33.700 --> 09:38.220
therefore it's a low pass, and high frequencies are cut out. Cutting off

09:38.220 --> 09:44.860
these frequencies gives almost the sensation of being underwater. Lower

09:44.860 --> 09:47.940
frequency sounds are more tenacious at traveling through liquids and solids.

09:47.940 --> 09:54.300
This is why bassy noises travel through walls better than piano music.

09:56.500 --> 10:00.900
Any sounds that are coming from inside rather than outside are going to have

10:00.900 --> 10:04.700
their higher frequencies cut off more, just by virtue of where the sound is

10:04.700 --> 10:11.220
coming from and the mediums it has to move through. So Max's pain and

10:11.220 --> 10:15.380
disorientation in this scene is shown by the higher frequency sounds in the scene

10:15.380 --> 10:20.460
being cut out. And the tension is relieved when we reintroduce higher

10:20.460 --> 10:27.340
frequencies back into the soundscape. The hiss of air escaping and the air tone of

10:27.340 --> 10:30.620
the atmosphere. See I focus on the sound here because the framing doesn't really

10:30.620 --> 10:34.620
get across the element that is being set up. That of an air bubble in Max's

10:34.620 --> 10:40.300
body and the pain it's causing him. If you watch this scene with the sound off,

10:45.300 --> 10:49.260
you can't really tell what's going on. It just kind of looks like the needle was

10:49.260 --> 10:56.740
annoying him. But with the sound on, oh. Removing the needle releases the air

10:56.740 --> 10:59.900
bubble. This may not seem like planted information, but it pays off at the very

10:59.900 --> 11:08.540
end. Both with the needle and with the air accumulation in the body. It's almost

11:08.540 --> 11:12.580
like the guy who wrote this was a former ER doctor or something. Max doesn't need

11:12.580 --> 11:15.800
to explain what he's doing. We already know what he's doing because the

11:15.800 --> 11:19.780
filmmakers trust the audience enough to intuit what's going on without having to

11:19.780 --> 11:23.460
have it explained to them. The information has been planted and now

11:23.460 --> 11:27.340
it's time to pay it off. The great thing about this movie is that you could go on

11:27.340 --> 11:31.460
for hours about all the ways it uses its medium to maximize its potential.

11:31.460 --> 11:36.940
Because ultimately, that's what this is all about. How to best tell a story using

11:36.940 --> 11:41.500
your given medium. Mad Max Fury Road isn't perfect, but it's about as close

11:41.500 --> 11:46.380
to perfect as a movie made by humans is going to get. I mean, I could go on. Hell,

11:46.380 --> 11:50.580
I could go on about the sound design alone for another hour. But that's enough

11:50.580 --> 11:55.860
for now. Thank you for watching. Like, share, subscribe, witness!
