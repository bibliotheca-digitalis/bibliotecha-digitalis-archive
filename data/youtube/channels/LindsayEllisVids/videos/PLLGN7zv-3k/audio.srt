1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
Today I want to talk about a simple yet important element in narrative structure

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:10,140
known as planting and payoff. The most basic way to think of planting and payoff

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,460
is the idea of Chekhov's gun. In an 1889 letter Chekhov wrote one must never

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,980
place a loaded rifle on the stage if it isn't going to go off. Chekhov believed

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,300
that all narrative elements in a story should be both necessary and irreplaceable.

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,300
Well, I've only got four for big boy here so he's all but useless. Not all movies adhere to

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:37,300
this principle. Some just meander around and do whatever, but good ones do.

8
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,820
You've got two left! And I know that a lot of this is a matter of taste, but in a broader sense

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,700
audience satisfaction derives in part from the way that narrative elements are

10
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,820
introduced and paid off. Some plantings are obvious with an inferred, this is

11
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,420
going to pay off later, basically emblazoned into the sky, and others are

12
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,740
more subtle. But for a full satisfying narrative, generally when an element is

13
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:07,700
introduced, be it plot driven, thematic, or physical, it should pay off in some way

14
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,740
and also tie in to all the other narrative elements.

15
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:25,740
Whenever people, correctly, use the term deus ex machina, it isn't so much because

16
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,740
the salvation element is convenient, but because it had not been planted or set

17
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:35,300
up. You don't call Max's method for saving Furiosa at the end of Mad Max Fury

18
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,380
Road a deus ex machina because the means are so thoroughly planted throughout

19
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,660
the narrative, especially in the first act of the film, so that when the

20
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:49,380
vulvalini says, the audience immediately knows what the solution is because Max's

21
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,700
universal donor blood has been repeatedly established. The importance of

22
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,020
how narrative information is planted and paid off is best demonstrated when it is

23
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:03,100
done poorly or not at all. Just because an element is planted doesn't mean the

24
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:11,580
payoff, to put it diplomatically, is necessarily narratively satisfying.

25
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,860
Narrative elements can be introduced in a manner of ways. Dialogue is a common

26
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:21,780
one, but this is film, it is never as simple as just a line of dialogue

27
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,620
introducing an element. The framing, the color, the camera movement, the sound

28
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,500
design, all of these elements imbue meaning. So pacing matters, but so too

29
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,700
does order. To pick on Zack Snyder, again, because he is really bad at this

30
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,180
particular thing, the order in which you place your narrative elements matters.

31
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,500
For example, the idea that Clark should hide his alien self in Man of Steel.

32
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:58,340
The problem with introducing this conflict is that tension of will he or

33
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,860
won't he use his powers to help people has already been resolved. It's resolved

34
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,280
in the very first scene we see adult Clark. So we have the planting after the

35
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,220
payoff. The answer is given before the question. The DC Universe films, Man of

36
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,740
especially, rely way too heavily on what the audience already knows about Superman

37
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:22,140
from their basic experiences of living in the world, rather than setting up its

38
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,660
own internal narrative about this character. The trick with narrative is to

39
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,140
plant elements early and eventually pay them off in a way that doesn't feel

40
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:37,500
obvious or contrived. It needs to make sense and it needs to feel organic.

41
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,700
Information can be imparted through dialogue, but I'm more interested in

42
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,060
visual and sound information, so I wanted to do a brief overview of three

43
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,140
non-dialogue elements from Mad Max Fury Road. The silver spray, Max's blood, and

44
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:57,380
Max's boot. Your basic narrative planting and payoff will include a setup, a

45
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:03,940
reminder, and the payoff. Though depending on how closely together within the

46
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,860
narrative the planting and the payoff occurs, we may not need a reminder. Let's

47
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:19,060
look at the war boy spray. This nameless character is fatally wounded. The sound

48
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:28,100
drops out, the film slows down, all of the characters pay attention to this guy,

49
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:35,020
and it draws audience attention to the fact that this is important information

50
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:40,220
and you need to pay attention. First we get the visual element, the spray,

51
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:53,220
followed by a dialogue element, and then this. Information acquired. Silver mouth

52
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,540
spray signifies that a pseudo-religious suicide mission is about to take place,

53
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,660
the witness call and response imparting that to these guys, this is the most

54
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,100
badass thing ever, and also communal. They are judged on their performance. See

55
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:14,260
these guys are impressed. Slit, not so much. So the payoff for this comes not far down

56
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,740
the road. Nux is the only war boy left who can stop Furiosa after she runs this

57
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,020
vehicle into the hurricane. This further spurs him on, he wants to be like these

58
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:30,060
guys. So without having to say anything so on-the-nose as it's suicide bomb time,

59
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:39,140
when Nux starts doing this, we, like Max, immediately intuit his intentions. So what

60
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,140
I find remarkable about the way this culture is explained to the audience,

61
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,940
despite this world and culture being so removed and alien from our own, is that

62
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,860
we don't really need some fish-out-of-water character having the

63
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,700
details of the universe being explained to them. In fact all you see around you

64
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,460
has been taken from the lessons garnered from the historical documents.

65
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:02,980
Is this a spaceship? The audience gets a lot of information about this culture,

66
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,620
the universe, and how it works, but it's seen only through the eyes of people who

67
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,940
already live in it. They all know what the spray means. A clear planting of a

68
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,820
narrative element, followed by the payoff a few minutes later. But with the boot, a

69
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,540
bit more time passes between planting and payoff, therefore with this one we

70
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:24,780
need a reminder. An important but subtle theme in Mad Max Fury Road is that of

71
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:31,060
forgiveness when and if circumstance allows. And it is most explicitly shown

72
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,740
through the relationship of Max and Nux. Nux unquestioningly objectifies Max,

73
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,540
using him as an ornament and violating his body autonomy by stealing his blood.

74
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:44,300
This is not done out of malice, but simply because it doesn't occur to Nux

75
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:50,020
that this might be wrong. This shot is a turning point when they first look at

76
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,740
each other, and this is also the beginning of Nux's character arc. For one

77
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,220
hair of a second he sees Max as human. Then the setup thematically in the form

78
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:04,060
of the boot. Which brings us to narrative element slash metaphor number whatever.

79
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:11,300
Slit gets kicked off the car by Max. Slit steals Max's boot. The setup. When Max

80
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,060
finds Nux unconscious after they wrecked the car, Max steals Nux's boot.

81
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,700
The reminder. And then the payoff comes far later. Nux is learning to build

82
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:25,340
empathy, has decided to switch sides. The payoff. Max steals a boot from the

83
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:30,100
Bullet Farmer's gang, gifts it to Nux. A practical element. Now Nux has two shoes

84
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,140
again, that's nice. But also thematic. It shows that Max forgives Nux, and on a

85
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,380
deeper level that completion points towards Nux finding his own sense of

86
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,860
completion by joining Furiosa's ragtag band. A practical thread in the form of a

87
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,220
prop, sure, but like everything in this movie it has a deeper level than that. In

88
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,300
this case one of forgiveness. Max and Nux barely speak a word to each other

89
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,380
throughout the entire film, but in this simple gesture we get all that we need

90
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,140
to know. Max and Nux would have no concrete connection except for that boot.

91
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:01,580
Besides the boot, the only thing they have is Max's blood. And Max's blood is a

92
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,980
huge plot point, so I'm not going to go into all of the ways it is set up and

93
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,660
paid off. It establishes not only that this is effectively a culture comprised

94
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:15,980
of mostly the sick and the dying, but that Max is a universal donor. A setup that

95
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,340
pays off in a very big way at the end of the movie, when Max gives Furiosa a

96
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,740
direct blood transfusion. The blood tube is important here. First the setup, the

97
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,940
reminder, and finally the payoff. But there's another setup that's one of my

98
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,860
favorites in the film, because it's like a sub setup. And it uses not only visuals

99
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,860
to get across the information, and not only sound editing, but sound mixing as

100
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:50,460
well. Let's break that down. We're going to talk a little bit about sound mixing.

101
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:55,140
Max rises from the earth, like lava from a volcano, and first we get that

102
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:02,140
heartbeat sound. Normally that's a pretty big cliche in sound design, and they tell

103
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,740
you to avoid that, like on your first day as a film student. But since here it's

104
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,740
literally his own heartbeat he's hearing, we'll give it a pass. But it

105
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,460
isn't just that. Max's disorientation is intercut with shots of lava erupting, and

106
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:21,460
corresponding sound effects that come with it. These sounds are mixed using a

107
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,300
low-pass filter, a type of audio EQ filter that cuts off higher frequency

108
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:33,660
sounds. The easy way to remember it is that low frequencies pass on through,

109
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:38,220
therefore it's a low pass, and high frequencies are cut out. Cutting off

110
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:44,860
these frequencies gives almost the sensation of being underwater. Lower

111
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,940
frequency sounds are more tenacious at traveling through liquids and solids.

112
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:54,300
This is why bassy noises travel through walls better than piano music.

113
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,900
Any sounds that are coming from inside rather than outside are going to have

114
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,700
their higher frequencies cut off more, just by virtue of where the sound is

115
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:11,220
coming from and the mediums it has to move through. So Max's pain and

116
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,380
disorientation in this scene is shown by the higher frequency sounds in the scene

117
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:20,460
being cut out. And the tension is relieved when we reintroduce higher

118
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:27,340
frequencies back into the soundscape. The hiss of air escaping and the air tone of

119
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,620
the atmosphere. See I focus on the sound here because the framing doesn't really

120
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,620
get across the element that is being set up. That of an air bubble in Max's

121
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:40,300
body and the pain it's causing him. If you watch this scene with the sound off,

122
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,260
you can't really tell what's going on. It just kind of looks like the needle was

123
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:56,740
annoying him. But with the sound on, oh. Removing the needle releases the air

124
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,900
bubble. This may not seem like planted information, but it pays off at the very

125
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:08,540
end. Both with the needle and with the air accumulation in the body. It's almost

126
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,580
like the guy who wrote this was a former ER doctor or something. Max doesn't need

127
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,800
to explain what he's doing. We already know what he's doing because the

128
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,780
filmmakers trust the audience enough to intuit what's going on without having to

129
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,460
have it explained to them. The information has been planted and now

130
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,340
it's time to pay it off. The great thing about this movie is that you could go on

131
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:31,460
for hours about all the ways it uses its medium to maximize its potential.

132
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:36,940
Because ultimately, that's what this is all about. How to best tell a story using

133
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,500
your given medium. Mad Max Fury Road isn't perfect, but it's about as close

134
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,380
to perfect as a movie made by humans is going to get. I mean, I could go on. Hell,

135
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,580
I could go on about the sound design alone for another hour. But that's enough

136
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:55,860
for now. Thank you for watching. Like, share, subscribe, witness!
