1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Arrival plays with a lot of new and interesting ideas as it pertains to the way aliens are presented on film,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
particularly with regard to language.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
But it reminded me of something I've been wanting to delve into for a long time,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and that is how alien creature design plays a role in shaping the narrative by how we define the other.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So what do we mean by the other?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Humans have a natural in-group, out-group mentality, and we see this come out in how we structure narrative.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Othering is an important concept in communications theory because the human brain is wired to identify things as either in my group or other by default.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
There is the familiar, the self, and then there is the other.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In terms of film theory, othering refers to how the presumed out-group is portrayed to the perceived in-group.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Othering can have very wide applications and most often refers to how dominant cultural groups portray other non-dominant groups.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
But today I'm going to take othering to its extreme extreme, aliens.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We have humanoid aliens, such as the original Klingons from the original Star Trek series,

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and this also constitutes a form of othering since the Klingons were based on a sort of Fu Manchu aesthetic that differentiates itself from the presumed American audience.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But I'm more interested in non-humanoid aliens, and more specifically, how they are designed and what message is communicated by that design.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
In the case of Arrival, the extremely alien nature of the heptapods isn't just meant to create a mood, but it's also the basis for the plot.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Their physical incomprehensibility mirrors their linguistic strangeness, as well as the intense difficulty of the human characters to understand their new guests.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So, for the purposes of cinema, which is a visual medium,

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
filmmakers and designers must use visual shorthand to get across the idea of alien, clearly and concisely across to its audience.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
A concept that nobody knows what it could possibly entail, except for the lizard people, of course,

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
design sends a message just like any other part of film language.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Design helps impart the way the alien's otherness is meant to be taken by the audience,

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
whether the alien is meant to be relatable, or to be feared, or to be mysterious.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This can be tricky, as film is a visual medium,

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and the more alien something looks, the more difficult it is for the audience to humanize and therefore relate to the character.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But especially in this day and age, unless it's a body snatcher or something, your design can't look too human,

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
hence the use of visual shorthand either to humanize the other or alienize it, such as it were.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The human brain is designed to empathize with human faces.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That's why a good actor can impart a great deal to their audience in very little time at all.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Your brain is more likely to feel sympathetic to your own species than your own class, your own phylum, your own kingdom, etc.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is why alien designs draw so much from animals.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The further the inspiration is from us on the evolutionary family tree, the more alien the creature seems.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This is why insects and reptiles are popular bases for alien creature designs

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and the filmmaker wants the alien to feel especially monstrous or foreign.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Basically, the more human an alien looks, the less screen time needs to be spent, making the character sympathetic to the audience.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The more alien, the more screen time.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's why, say, we spend a very great deal of time with Christopher Johnson in District 9,

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
but we can take our sweet time getting to E.T. and Bumblebee.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So I'm going to look at the design of several alien characters, examine their otherness,

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and talk about what their design is meant to communicate to the audience in terms of the story.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Let's start with one of the most famous examples, H.R. Giger's xenomorph from 1979's Alien.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
One of the brilliant things about this film is the way the reveal of the creature is paced.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Alien takes some cues from Jaws with the slow reveal of its monster,

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
heightening the tension for when we actually do see snippets of the thing,

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and up to that point, the rare glimpses of the monster add to its mystery and horror.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The reveal of the design is as important to the mood of the film as the design itself.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
We don't really see the entirety of the creature until late in the film.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And what is the most striking thing about this guy's design?

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Point the first, he has no eyes.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The human brain is wired to be first drawn to look at eyes,

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
be they the eyes of a fellow human or a kitten or a puppy,

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
so the lack of eyes in and of itself is unnerving.

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Secondly, the design of the body is a sort of hybrid between reptilian features,

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
insectoid features, and a human skeleton.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The first two signify foreignness more to the human brain than, say, a mammal would.

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So for an iconic design meant to instill terror and never be forgotten,

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
this guy's about as effective as it's going to get.

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Roland Dimmrick was handed two designs for his alien species in Independence Day,

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and he liked them both so much he said, hey, let's use them both.

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
All right.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The inner alien is obviously more familiar,

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
inspired by the more popular Americana gray aliens,

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
which was first utilized in a big mainstream movie in Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But what inspired that design?

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Well, abduction testimonials and faked images, but let's assume that, you know, that's not real.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Well, the generally agreed-upon design for the Americana-inspired alien

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
sends a message unto itself, despite its familiarity.

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We got the big bald head, which denotes intelligence,

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
but we also got the big pupil-free eyes, which denotes not only mystery,

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
but possibly a hive mind, you know, because they look like bee eyes.

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The thing is also about the gray aliens, especially in Close Encounters,

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
is they kind of have this space children thing going on.

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
They are usually child's height and kind of have a weird split between baby and lizard features.

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That design is intentional, familiar enough to be understandable,

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
alien enough to be slightly unnerving.

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
These guys are, in effect, our new folklore.

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Roland opts to omit both of these aspects, save the vaguely reptilian skin,

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and kind of pulls a Geiger.

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
We need the eyes to denote intelligence, so Roland has his aliens have no mouth,

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
and they also have sunken-in skin against skull-like features.

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The Independence Day aliens are a Geiger-inspired horror version of the Close Encounters aliens.

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Like Geiger's alien, skeletal, but monstrous because it's intelligent and able to communicate,

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
not because it's going to eat you.

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But more recently, audiences are more receptive to more non-conventional alien designs,

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
as those based on the gray aliens kind of died out after War of the Worlds.

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Christopher Johnson is one of the most fascinating examples of a really, really alien-looking alien,

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
because he's also a main character in the movie.

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The District 9 aliens do weird alien shit that makes the audience uncomfortable.

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
They are treated as subhuman by their handlers in the film.

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The little guy has gone to a nice little sleep now.

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
They also do not look human at all, aside from being bipedal, with one notable exception,

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
those big baby eyes.

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This is an important element when you have alien characters that are meant to be relatable.

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
They need to have bright, prominent eyes with distinguishable pupils.

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
General rule of thumb, no pupils equals mysterious and probably evil.

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Pupils equals relatable.

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Christopher Johnson's body language is also readably human, too.

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
While the other prawns act a lot more alien, Christopher Johnson acts really very human,

98
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and exhibits traits that we as humans all intrinsically value.

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He has clear and sympathetic motivations, he reasons like a human,

100
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and he's way more honorable than the protagonist, Vickers.

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And also, he has a baby.

102
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And not just any baby, a cute baby.

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
A helpful baby.

104
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
When I first saw this, I genuinely wondered how they were going to humanize any of the alien characters

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
enough to make a mainstream audience sympathize quickly and efficiently,

106
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
and in hindsight, it was all too obvious.

107
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Give him a baby.

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But while the other prawns behave in a way that is distinctly alien, Christopher Johnson does not.

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
He reasons like a human, understands the system, and plays by the rules that are set by the humans.

110
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And most importantly, he gets a lot of screen time.

111
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
More than E.T., more than any of the Transformers, and almost as much as Vickers.

112
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Speaking of E.T.,

113
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
E.T.

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Note that there's a kind of balancing act here.

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
To keep your aliens alien, yet sympathetic to the audience.

116
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Unlike Christopher Johnson, who has full language facilities throughout the narrative,

117
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
E.T.'s language never really gets fully developed.

118
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But E.T. is also a very emotional creature,

119
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and no joke, this movie is genius in the way it uses film language to get the story across without a lot of dialogue.

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The audience also has to compensate E.T.'s alien, squishy, weird design by spending some time with him,

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
but at the end of the day, his proportions are still pretty human-looking.

122
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
His nose, mouth, teeth, and most importantly, those big baby eyes.

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
E.T. feels familiar because there are familiar bases for design.

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Special effects artist Carlo Rambaldi studied photos of elderly people who lived during the Great Depression,

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
and also collated the facial design with photos of the likes of Albert Einstein and Ernest Hemingway.

126
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
At first, he's framed like an animal. We often see him framed in a similar lens to the dog.

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But by the end of the movie, E.T. goes from practically an animal to Elliot's bro to...

128
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Jesus.

129
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Again, with the framing. I see what you did there, Spielberg.

130
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Given the intentionally human and empathetic elements of the design,

131
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
it doesn't take the audience long to accept E.T. as a fully realized and sympathetic character.

132
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
E.T. has a very human-looking face, so his emotions are easy to read.

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The film also takes its sweet time in revealing E.T., once again taking its cues from Jaws,

134
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
which creates a sense of uncertainty that lasts throughout the film.

135
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Compare this to District 9, where in order for the audience to accept such an extremely alien-looking character like Christopher Johnson,

136
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
he needs to have a lot more screen time and be introduced much earlier.

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
On the more clusterfuck-y end, we have the likes of Bumblebee and Optimus Prime from the live-action Transformers movies.

138
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I say clusterfuck-y for perhaps obvious reasons.

139
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
As all of the Transformers have very busy designs that is difficult for the human eye to follow,

140
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
and yet despite being alien, the characters are remarkably human, especially Optimus.

141
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
This is important because neither of these characters get much screen time relative to our human characters,

142
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
who, by the way, get way, way too much.

143
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But I'm talking just about screen time for their designed alien forms,

144
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and it's important to note that we spend a lot of time getting to know Bumblebee as a car.

145
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Bumblebee has a somewhat alien face, but it is still proportioned more like a baby's than an adult.

146
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
He even kinda looks like he's got a... binky in his mouth.

147
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But when he needs to go into battle mode, he just puts that badass mask on and goes to town.

148
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And what is that, Bumblebee? Is that... big baby eyes?

149
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Despite the way-too-busy design of all of the Transformers,

150
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
the Autobots are much more readably human,

151
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and therefore don't need a lot of screen time to make them sympathetic and understandable to the audience.

152
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And I'm gonna ignore the nostalgia factor.

153
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The Autobots have their already very human proportions, manner of speaking and body language.

154
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Combine this with the fact that they transform into cars,

155
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
which is something familiar and even friendly looking to the audience.

156
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But in the way the Autobots act, are they alien at all?

157
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
We cannot let the humans pay for our mistakes.

158
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Not really, besides the fact that Bumblebee can't talk.

159
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
They just seem like American good ol' boys.

160
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The Decepticons are demonstrably more alien in contrast to the good ol' boy Autobots.

161
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
They also tend towards more steely military vehicles,

162
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
as opposed to the more familiar blue-collar GM models the Autobots support.

163
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And the one Peter built.

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
In the first movie, the Decepticons are also authorized by their language,

165
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
that they speak an alien language instead of the Autobots,

166
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
who even in private, in the most visible spot in L.A., always speak English.

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The Decepticons' faces are also less human-looking. No big baby eyes here.

168
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So Transformers is an interesting example,

169
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
because we have two alien factions of the same species,

170
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
and the film needs to demonstrate which is the good faction, not just by their actions,

171
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
but by contrasting them with the otherness of the bad faction.

172
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So just as a talented actor can impart a lot of information by a second of expression,

173
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
a lot of information can be conveyed to the audience simply through character design.

174
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Logically, your alien could look like anything,

175
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
but it wouldn't have worked narratively if E.T. had resembled a xenomorph.

176
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And likewise, if the xenomorph happened to resemble E.T.,

177
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
it would have been pretty rough for the audience to swallow if E.T. had been a 20-foot antenna slug,

178
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
or if Christopher Johnson had looked like, I don't know, Thor.

179
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We talk a lot about framing, dialogue, and other types of film language,

180
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
but production design, particularly character design,

181
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
is also a very important means to effectively impart information to the audience.

182
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I rest my case.

183
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Thank you for watching.
