0	8000	Arrival plays with a lot of new and interesting ideas as it pertains to the way aliens are presented on film,
8000	10000	particularly with regard to language.
10000	13000	But it reminded me of something I've been wanting to delve into for a long time,
13000	19000	and that is how alien creature design plays a role in shaping the narrative by how we define the other.
22000	25000	So what do we mean by the other?
25000	29000	Humans have a natural in-group, out-group mentality, and we see this come out in how we structure narrative.
29000	37000	Othering is an important concept in communications theory because the human brain is wired to identify things as either in my group or other by default.
37000	40000	There is the familiar, the self, and then there is the other.
40000	45000	In terms of film theory, othering refers to how the presumed out-group is portrayed to the perceived in-group.
45000	51000	Othering can have very wide applications and most often refers to how dominant cultural groups portray other non-dominant groups.
51000	55000	But today I'm going to take othering to its extreme extreme, aliens.
55000	59000	We have humanoid aliens, such as the original Klingons from the original Star Trek series,
59000	67000	and this also constitutes a form of othering since the Klingons were based on a sort of Fu Manchu aesthetic that differentiates itself from the presumed American audience.
67000	74000	But I'm more interested in non-humanoid aliens, and more specifically, how they are designed and what message is communicated by that design.
74000	81000	In the case of Arrival, the extremely alien nature of the heptapods isn't just meant to create a mood, but it's also the basis for the plot.
81000	89000	Their physical incomprehensibility mirrors their linguistic strangeness, as well as the intense difficulty of the human characters to understand their new guests.
89000	92000	So, for the purposes of cinema, which is a visual medium,
92000	99000	filmmakers and designers must use visual shorthand to get across the idea of alien, clearly and concisely across to its audience.
99000	103000	A concept that nobody knows what it could possibly entail, except for the lizard people, of course,
103000	107000	design sends a message just like any other part of film language.
107000	111000	Design helps impart the way the alien's otherness is meant to be taken by the audience,
111000	116000	whether the alien is meant to be relatable, or to be feared, or to be mysterious.
116000	118000	This can be tricky, as film is a visual medium,
118000	123000	and the more alien something looks, the more difficult it is for the audience to humanize and therefore relate to the character.
123000	128000	But especially in this day and age, unless it's a body snatcher or something, your design can't look too human,
128000	133000	hence the use of visual shorthand either to humanize the other or alienize it, such as it were.
133000	136000	The human brain is designed to empathize with human faces.
136000	140000	That's why a good actor can impart a great deal to their audience in very little time at all.
140000	148000	Your brain is more likely to feel sympathetic to your own species than your own class, your own phylum, your own kingdom, etc.
148000	150000	This is why alien designs draw so much from animals.
150000	156000	The further the inspiration is from us on the evolutionary family tree, the more alien the creature seems.
156000	160000	This is why insects and reptiles are popular bases for alien creature designs
160000	164000	and the filmmaker wants the alien to feel especially monstrous or foreign.
164000	169000	Basically, the more human an alien looks, the less screen time needs to be spent, making the character sympathetic to the audience.
169000	171000	The more alien, the more screen time.
171000	176000	That's why, say, we spend a very great deal of time with Christopher Johnson in District 9,
176000	179000	but we can take our sweet time getting to E.T. and Bumblebee.
179000	183000	So I'm going to look at the design of several alien characters, examine their otherness,
183000	187000	and talk about what their design is meant to communicate to the audience in terms of the story.
190000	195000	Let's start with one of the most famous examples, H.R. Giger's xenomorph from 1979's Alien.
195000	199000	One of the brilliant things about this film is the way the reveal of the creature is paced.
199000	202000	Alien takes some cues from Jaws with the slow reveal of its monster,
202000	205000	heightening the tension for when we actually do see snippets of the thing,
205000	209000	and up to that point, the rare glimpses of the monster add to its mystery and horror.
209000	213000	The reveal of the design is as important to the mood of the film as the design itself.
213000	216000	We don't really see the entirety of the creature until late in the film.
216000	219000	And what is the most striking thing about this guy's design?
219000	221000	Point the first, he has no eyes.
221000	224000	The human brain is wired to be first drawn to look at eyes,
224000	227000	be they the eyes of a fellow human or a kitten or a puppy,
227000	229000	so the lack of eyes in and of itself is unnerving.
229000	233000	Secondly, the design of the body is a sort of hybrid between reptilian features,
233000	235000	insectoid features, and a human skeleton.
235000	240000	The first two signify foreignness more to the human brain than, say, a mammal would.
240000	243000	So for an iconic design meant to instill terror and never be forgotten,
243000	246000	this guy's about as effective as it's going to get.
250000	254000	Roland Dimmrick was handed two designs for his alien species in Independence Day,
254000	258000	and he liked them both so much he said, hey, let's use them both.
258000	259000	All right.
259000	261000	The inner alien is obviously more familiar,
261000	264000	inspired by the more popular Americana gray aliens,
264000	268000	which was first utilized in a big mainstream movie in Close Encounters of the Third Kind.
268000	270000	But what inspired that design?
270000	276000	Well, abduction testimonials and faked images, but let's assume that, you know, that's not real.
276000	279000	Well, the generally agreed-upon design for the Americana-inspired alien
279000	282000	sends a message unto itself, despite its familiarity.
282000	285000	We got the big bald head, which denotes intelligence,
285000	288000	but we also got the big pupil-free eyes, which denotes not only mystery,
288000	292000	but possibly a hive mind, you know, because they look like bee eyes.
292000	295000	The thing is also about the gray aliens, especially in Close Encounters,
295000	298000	is they kind of have this space children thing going on.
298000	302000	They are usually child's height and kind of have a weird split between baby and lizard features.
302000	305000	That design is intentional, familiar enough to be understandable,
305000	307000	alien enough to be slightly unnerving.
307000	309000	These guys are, in effect, our new folklore.
309000	313000	Roland opts to omit both of these aspects, save the vaguely reptilian skin,
313000	315000	and kind of pulls a Geiger.
315000	319000	We need the eyes to denote intelligence, so Roland has his aliens have no mouth,
319000	322000	and they also have sunken-in skin against skull-like features.
322000	327000	The Independence Day aliens are a Geiger-inspired horror version of the Close Encounters aliens.
327000	331000	Like Geiger's alien, skeletal, but monstrous because it's intelligent and able to communicate,
331000	333000	not because it's going to eat you.
333000	337000	But more recently, audiences are more receptive to more non-conventional alien designs,
337000	341000	as those based on the gray aliens kind of died out after War of the Worlds.
341000	348000	Christopher Johnson is one of the most fascinating examples of a really, really alien-looking alien,
348000	350000	because he's also a main character in the movie.
350000	354000	The District 9 aliens do weird alien shit that makes the audience uncomfortable.
354000	357000	They are treated as subhuman by their handlers in the film.
358000	361000	The little guy has gone to a nice little sleep now.
361000	365000	They also do not look human at all, aside from being bipedal, with one notable exception,
365000	367000	those big baby eyes.
367000	370000	This is an important element when you have alien characters that are meant to be relatable.
370000	374000	They need to have bright, prominent eyes with distinguishable pupils.
374000	378000	General rule of thumb, no pupils equals mysterious and probably evil.
378000	379000	Pupils equals relatable.
379000	382000	Christopher Johnson's body language is also readably human, too.
382000	386000	While the other prawns act a lot more alien, Christopher Johnson acts really very human,
386000	389000	and exhibits traits that we as humans all intrinsically value.
389000	393000	He has clear and sympathetic motivations, he reasons like a human,
393000	395000	and he's way more honorable than the protagonist, Vickers.
395000	397000	And also, he has a baby.
397000	399000	And not just any baby, a cute baby.
399000	400000	A helpful baby.
400000	404000	When I first saw this, I genuinely wondered how they were going to humanize any of the alien characters
404000	407000	enough to make a mainstream audience sympathize quickly and efficiently,
407000	409000	and in hindsight, it was all too obvious.
409000	410000	Give him a baby.
410000	414000	But while the other prawns behave in a way that is distinctly alien, Christopher Johnson does not.
414000	419000	He reasons like a human, understands the system, and plays by the rules that are set by the humans.
419000	421000	And most importantly, he gets a lot of screen time.
421000	425000	More than E.T., more than any of the Transformers, and almost as much as Vickers.
425000	427000	Speaking of E.T.,
427000	428000	E.T.
428000	430000	Note that there's a kind of balancing act here.
430000	433000	To keep your aliens alien, yet sympathetic to the audience.
433000	437000	Unlike Christopher Johnson, who has full language facilities throughout the narrative,
437000	440000	E.T.'s language never really gets fully developed.
440000	442000	But E.T. is also a very emotional creature,
442000	448000	and no joke, this movie is genius in the way it uses film language to get the story across without a lot of dialogue.
448000	453000	The audience also has to compensate E.T.'s alien, squishy, weird design by spending some time with him,
453000	456000	but at the end of the day, his proportions are still pretty human-looking.
456000	460000	His nose, mouth, teeth, and most importantly, those big baby eyes.
460000	463000	E.T. feels familiar because there are familiar bases for design.
463000	468000	Special effects artist Carlo Rambaldi studied photos of elderly people who lived during the Great Depression,
468000	473000	and also collated the facial design with photos of the likes of Albert Einstein and Ernest Hemingway.
473000	477000	At first, he's framed like an animal. We often see him framed in a similar lens to the dog.
477000	482000	But by the end of the movie, E.T. goes from practically an animal to Elliot's bro to...
482000	483000	Jesus.
483000	486000	Again, with the framing. I see what you did there, Spielberg.
486000	489000	Given the intentionally human and empathetic elements of the design,
489000	493000	it doesn't take the audience long to accept E.T. as a fully realized and sympathetic character.
493000	497000	E.T. has a very human-looking face, so his emotions are easy to read.
497000	501000	The film also takes its sweet time in revealing E.T., once again taking its cues from Jaws,
501000	504000	which creates a sense of uncertainty that lasts throughout the film.
504000	510000	Compare this to District 9, where in order for the audience to accept such an extremely alien-looking character like Christopher Johnson,
510000	514000	he needs to have a lot more screen time and be introduced much earlier.
516000	522000	On the more clusterfuck-y end, we have the likes of Bumblebee and Optimus Prime from the live-action Transformers movies.
522000	525000	I say clusterfuck-y for perhaps obvious reasons.
526000	530000	As all of the Transformers have very busy designs that is difficult for the human eye to follow,
530000	535000	and yet despite being alien, the characters are remarkably human, especially Optimus.
536000	541000	This is important because neither of these characters get much screen time relative to our human characters,
541000	543000	who, by the way, get way, way too much.
546000	550000	But I'm talking just about screen time for their designed alien forms,
550000	554000	and it's important to note that we spend a lot of time getting to know Bumblebee as a car.
554000	558000	Bumblebee has a somewhat alien face, but it is still proportioned more like a baby's than an adult.
558000	561000	He even kinda looks like he's got a... binky in his mouth.
561000	565000	But when he needs to go into battle mode, he just puts that badass mask on and goes to town.
565000	569000	And what is that, Bumblebee? Is that... big baby eyes?
569000	572000	Despite the way-too-busy design of all of the Transformers,
572000	574000	the Autobots are much more readably human,
574000	578000	and therefore don't need a lot of screen time to make them sympathetic and understandable to the audience.
578000	580000	And I'm gonna ignore the nostalgia factor.
580000	585000	The Autobots have their already very human proportions, manner of speaking and body language.
585000	588000	Combine this with the fact that they transform into cars,
588000	591000	which is something familiar and even friendly looking to the audience.
591000	594000	But in the way the Autobots act, are they alien at all?
594000	597000	We cannot let the humans pay for our mistakes.
597000	600000	Not really, besides the fact that Bumblebee can't talk.
600000	603000	They just seem like American good ol' boys.
603000	607000	The Decepticons are demonstrably more alien in contrast to the good ol' boy Autobots.
607000	610000	They also tend towards more steely military vehicles,
610000	614000	as opposed to the more familiar blue-collar GM models the Autobots support.
614000	616000	And the one Peter built.
618000	621000	In the first movie, the Decepticons are also authorized by their language,
621000	624000	that they speak an alien language instead of the Autobots,
624000	629000	who even in private, in the most visible spot in L.A., always speak English.
629000	633000	The Decepticons' faces are also less human-looking. No big baby eyes here.
633000	635000	So Transformers is an interesting example,
635000	638000	because we have two alien factions of the same species,
638000	642000	and the film needs to demonstrate which is the good faction, not just by their actions,
642000	645000	but by contrasting them with the otherness of the bad faction.
648000	653000	So just as a talented actor can impart a lot of information by a second of expression,
653000	656000	a lot of information can be conveyed to the audience simply through character design.
656000	659000	Logically, your alien could look like anything,
659000	662000	but it wouldn't have worked narratively if E.T. had resembled a xenomorph.
662000	664000	And likewise, if the xenomorph happened to resemble E.T.,
664000	669000	it would have been pretty rough for the audience to swallow if E.T. had been a 20-foot antenna slug,
669000	672000	or if Christopher Johnson had looked like, I don't know, Thor.
672000	675000	We talk a lot about framing, dialogue, and other types of film language,
675000	678000	but production design, particularly character design,
678000	682000	is also a very important means to effectively impart information to the audience.
686000	688000	I rest my case.
692000	696000	Thank you for watching.
