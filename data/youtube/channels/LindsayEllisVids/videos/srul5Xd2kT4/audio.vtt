00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Arrival plays with a lot of new and interesting ideas as it pertains to the way aliens are presented on film,

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
particularly with regard to language.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
But it reminded me of something I've been wanting to delve into for a long time,

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
and that is how alien creature design plays a role in shaping the narrative by how we define the other.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
So what do we mean by the other?

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
Humans have a natural in-group, out-group mentality, and we see this come out in how we structure narrative.

00:29.000 --> 00:37.000
Othering is an important concept in communications theory because the human brain is wired to identify things as either in my group or other by default.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
There is the familiar, the self, and then there is the other.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
In terms of film theory, othering refers to how the presumed out-group is portrayed to the perceived in-group.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
Othering can have very wide applications and most often refers to how dominant cultural groups portray other non-dominant groups.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
But today I'm going to take othering to its extreme extreme, aliens.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
We have humanoid aliens, such as the original Klingons from the original Star Trek series,

00:59.000 --> 01:07.000
and this also constitutes a form of othering since the Klingons were based on a sort of Fu Manchu aesthetic that differentiates itself from the presumed American audience.

01:07.000 --> 01:14.000
But I'm more interested in non-humanoid aliens, and more specifically, how they are designed and what message is communicated by that design.

01:14.000 --> 01:21.000
In the case of Arrival, the extremely alien nature of the heptapods isn't just meant to create a mood, but it's also the basis for the plot.

01:21.000 --> 01:29.000
Their physical incomprehensibility mirrors their linguistic strangeness, as well as the intense difficulty of the human characters to understand their new guests.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
So, for the purposes of cinema, which is a visual medium,

01:32.000 --> 01:39.000
filmmakers and designers must use visual shorthand to get across the idea of alien, clearly and concisely across to its audience.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
A concept that nobody knows what it could possibly entail, except for the lizard people, of course,

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
design sends a message just like any other part of film language.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
Design helps impart the way the alien's otherness is meant to be taken by the audience,

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
whether the alien is meant to be relatable, or to be feared, or to be mysterious.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
This can be tricky, as film is a visual medium,

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
and the more alien something looks, the more difficult it is for the audience to humanize and therefore relate to the character.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
But especially in this day and age, unless it's a body snatcher or something, your design can't look too human,

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
hence the use of visual shorthand either to humanize the other or alienize it, such as it were.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
The human brain is designed to empathize with human faces.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
That's why a good actor can impart a great deal to their audience in very little time at all.

02:20.000 --> 02:28.000
Your brain is more likely to feel sympathetic to your own species than your own class, your own phylum, your own kingdom, etc.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
This is why alien designs draw so much from animals.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
The further the inspiration is from us on the evolutionary family tree, the more alien the creature seems.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
This is why insects and reptiles are popular bases for alien creature designs

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
and the filmmaker wants the alien to feel especially monstrous or foreign.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
Basically, the more human an alien looks, the less screen time needs to be spent, making the character sympathetic to the audience.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
The more alien, the more screen time.

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
That's why, say, we spend a very great deal of time with Christopher Johnson in District 9,

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
but we can take our sweet time getting to E.T. and Bumblebee.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
So I'm going to look at the design of several alien characters, examine their otherness,

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
and talk about what their design is meant to communicate to the audience in terms of the story.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
Let's start with one of the most famous examples, H.R. Giger's xenomorph from 1979's Alien.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
One of the brilliant things about this film is the way the reveal of the creature is paced.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
Alien takes some cues from Jaws with the slow reveal of its monster,

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
heightening the tension for when we actually do see snippets of the thing,

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
and up to that point, the rare glimpses of the monster add to its mystery and horror.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
The reveal of the design is as important to the mood of the film as the design itself.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
We don't really see the entirety of the creature until late in the film.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
And what is the most striking thing about this guy's design?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Point the first, he has no eyes.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
The human brain is wired to be first drawn to look at eyes,

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
be they the eyes of a fellow human or a kitten or a puppy,

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
so the lack of eyes in and of itself is unnerving.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
Secondly, the design of the body is a sort of hybrid between reptilian features,

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
insectoid features, and a human skeleton.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
The first two signify foreignness more to the human brain than, say, a mammal would.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
So for an iconic design meant to instill terror and never be forgotten,

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
this guy's about as effective as it's going to get.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Roland Dimmrick was handed two designs for his alien species in Independence Day,

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
and he liked them both so much he said, hey, let's use them both.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
All right.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
The inner alien is obviously more familiar,

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
inspired by the more popular Americana gray aliens,

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
which was first utilized in a big mainstream movie in Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
But what inspired that design?

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
Well, abduction testimonials and faked images, but let's assume that, you know, that's not real.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
Well, the generally agreed-upon design for the Americana-inspired alien

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
sends a message unto itself, despite its familiarity.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
We got the big bald head, which denotes intelligence,

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
but we also got the big pupil-free eyes, which denotes not only mystery,

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
but possibly a hive mind, you know, because they look like bee eyes.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
The thing is also about the gray aliens, especially in Close Encounters,

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
is they kind of have this space children thing going on.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
They are usually child's height and kind of have a weird split between baby and lizard features.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
That design is intentional, familiar enough to be understandable,

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
alien enough to be slightly unnerving.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
These guys are, in effect, our new folklore.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
Roland opts to omit both of these aspects, save the vaguely reptilian skin,

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
and kind of pulls a Geiger.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
We need the eyes to denote intelligence, so Roland has his aliens have no mouth,

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
and they also have sunken-in skin against skull-like features.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
The Independence Day aliens are a Geiger-inspired horror version of the Close Encounters aliens.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
Like Geiger's alien, skeletal, but monstrous because it's intelligent and able to communicate,

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
not because it's going to eat you.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
But more recently, audiences are more receptive to more non-conventional alien designs,

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
as those based on the gray aliens kind of died out after War of the Worlds.

05:41.000 --> 05:48.000
Christopher Johnson is one of the most fascinating examples of a really, really alien-looking alien,

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
because he's also a main character in the movie.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
The District 9 aliens do weird alien shit that makes the audience uncomfortable.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
They are treated as subhuman by their handlers in the film.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
The little guy has gone to a nice little sleep now.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
They also do not look human at all, aside from being bipedal, with one notable exception,

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
those big baby eyes.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
This is an important element when you have alien characters that are meant to be relatable.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
They need to have bright, prominent eyes with distinguishable pupils.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
General rule of thumb, no pupils equals mysterious and probably evil.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Pupils equals relatable.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
Christopher Johnson's body language is also readably human, too.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
While the other prawns act a lot more alien, Christopher Johnson acts really very human,

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
and exhibits traits that we as humans all intrinsically value.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
He has clear and sympathetic motivations, he reasons like a human,

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
and he's way more honorable than the protagonist, Vickers.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
And also, he has a baby.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
And not just any baby, a cute baby.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
A helpful baby.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
When I first saw this, I genuinely wondered how they were going to humanize any of the alien characters

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
enough to make a mainstream audience sympathize quickly and efficiently,

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
and in hindsight, it was all too obvious.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Give him a baby.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
But while the other prawns behave in a way that is distinctly alien, Christopher Johnson does not.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
He reasons like a human, understands the system, and plays by the rules that are set by the humans.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
And most importantly, he gets a lot of screen time.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
More than E.T., more than any of the Transformers, and almost as much as Vickers.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Speaking of E.T.,

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
E.T.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Note that there's a kind of balancing act here.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
To keep your aliens alien, yet sympathetic to the audience.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
Unlike Christopher Johnson, who has full language facilities throughout the narrative,

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
E.T.'s language never really gets fully developed.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
But E.T. is also a very emotional creature,

07:22.000 --> 07:28.000
and no joke, this movie is genius in the way it uses film language to get the story across without a lot of dialogue.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
The audience also has to compensate E.T.'s alien, squishy, weird design by spending some time with him,

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
but at the end of the day, his proportions are still pretty human-looking.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
His nose, mouth, teeth, and most importantly, those big baby eyes.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
E.T. feels familiar because there are familiar bases for design.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
Special effects artist Carlo Rambaldi studied photos of elderly people who lived during the Great Depression,

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
and also collated the facial design with photos of the likes of Albert Einstein and Ernest Hemingway.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
At first, he's framed like an animal. We often see him framed in a similar lens to the dog.

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
But by the end of the movie, E.T. goes from practically an animal to Elliot's bro to...

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Jesus.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
Again, with the framing. I see what you did there, Spielberg.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
Given the intentionally human and empathetic elements of the design,

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
it doesn't take the audience long to accept E.T. as a fully realized and sympathetic character.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
E.T. has a very human-looking face, so his emotions are easy to read.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
The film also takes its sweet time in revealing E.T., once again taking its cues from Jaws,

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
which creates a sense of uncertainty that lasts throughout the film.

08:24.000 --> 08:30.000
Compare this to District 9, where in order for the audience to accept such an extremely alien-looking character like Christopher Johnson,

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
he needs to have a lot more screen time and be introduced much earlier.

08:36.000 --> 08:42.000
On the more clusterfuck-y end, we have the likes of Bumblebee and Optimus Prime from the live-action Transformers movies.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
I say clusterfuck-y for perhaps obvious reasons.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
As all of the Transformers have very busy designs that is difficult for the human eye to follow,

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
and yet despite being alien, the characters are remarkably human, especially Optimus.

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
This is important because neither of these characters get much screen time relative to our human characters,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
who, by the way, get way, way too much.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
But I'm talking just about screen time for their designed alien forms,

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
and it's important to note that we spend a lot of time getting to know Bumblebee as a car.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
Bumblebee has a somewhat alien face, but it is still proportioned more like a baby's than an adult.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
He even kinda looks like he's got a... binky in his mouth.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
But when he needs to go into battle mode, he just puts that badass mask on and goes to town.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
And what is that, Bumblebee? Is that... big baby eyes?

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
Despite the way-too-busy design of all of the Transformers,

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
the Autobots are much more readably human,

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
and therefore don't need a lot of screen time to make them sympathetic and understandable to the audience.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
And I'm gonna ignore the nostalgia factor.

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
The Autobots have their already very human proportions, manner of speaking and body language.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Combine this with the fact that they transform into cars,

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
which is something familiar and even friendly looking to the audience.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
But in the way the Autobots act, are they alien at all?

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
We cannot let the humans pay for our mistakes.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Not really, besides the fact that Bumblebee can't talk.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
They just seem like American good ol' boys.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
The Decepticons are demonstrably more alien in contrast to the good ol' boy Autobots.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
They also tend towards more steely military vehicles,

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
as opposed to the more familiar blue-collar GM models the Autobots support.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
And the one Peter built.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
In the first movie, the Decepticons are also authorized by their language,

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
that they speak an alien language instead of the Autobots,

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
who even in private, in the most visible spot in L.A., always speak English.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
The Decepticons' faces are also less human-looking. No big baby eyes here.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
So Transformers is an interesting example,

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
because we have two alien factions of the same species,

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
and the film needs to demonstrate which is the good faction, not just by their actions,

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
but by contrasting them with the otherness of the bad faction.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
So just as a talented actor can impart a lot of information by a second of expression,

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
a lot of information can be conveyed to the audience simply through character design.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
Logically, your alien could look like anything,

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
but it wouldn't have worked narratively if E.T. had resembled a xenomorph.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
And likewise, if the xenomorph happened to resemble E.T.,

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
it would have been pretty rough for the audience to swallow if E.T. had been a 20-foot antenna slug,

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
or if Christopher Johnson had looked like, I don't know, Thor.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
We talk a lot about framing, dialogue, and other types of film language,

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
but production design, particularly character design,

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
is also a very important means to effectively impart information to the audience.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
I rest my case.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
Thank you for watching.
