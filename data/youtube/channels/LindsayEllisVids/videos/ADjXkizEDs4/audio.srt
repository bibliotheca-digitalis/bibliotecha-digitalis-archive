00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,320
So last week, we asked for your input as to what our gimmick was and what our book is

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,320
about.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,760
And you guys certainly came through with plenty, many, many suggestions.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,360
And the problem was, honestly, they were too good, most of them.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,600
And it was a really great treasure trove of prompts.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,640
People were giving me ideas, and I was like, go write this now!

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,640
Write this for me now!

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,720
You do it, publish it, and I'll read it.

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,280
And I will read it, and I will, like, pimp you, and you can be like, yeah, I wrote this

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,560
prompt on Fifty Shades of Green, and then I did it, and it was, like, actually good.

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,240
And, of course, nobody read it, because it was worthwhile.

12
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:50,400
This one's from V. Voltaire, where his idea, or her, is that our young heroine has always

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,040
been displeased with her oddly pale skin and her dark eyes.

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,400
So strange!

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,340
But then one day, at her typical middle-class high school, she notices that the teachers

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,380
are all going around with mind slugs, and no one else seems to notice.

17
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,340
See, in this one, she's special because she can see the mind slugs, and the good guy alien

18
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,340
love interests.

19
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,340
It's like, why can't you see the love slugs?

20
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,340
Yeah, he's like, you're special.

21
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,860
Here's one from Sean, that if we do go with Twilight with robots, the epic third wheel

22
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:24,740
has to be the robot tech support guy, and he works on the robot love interest.

23
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,260
I just like this one from Lucas, because it's our young, insecure protagonist's name is

24
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,260
Amora.

25
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,260
It can also be Luna.

26
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,260
That's suggesting that we should actually make the guy evil, and while that would be

27
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,260
a twist, that's not how these books work.

28
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,260
Yeah.

29
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,260
There's too much of a twist by doing that.

30
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,260
You see, we really can't have a...

31
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,260
There's literally no twist.

32
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,260
There's no twist.

33
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:51,260
The only twist is that, oh my god, you're a witch, alien, vampire, werewolf.

34
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,260
Yeah.

35
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,260
That's the twist.

36
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:58,260
Having to go again with Tracy Pennington's comment of that you need to make your alien

37
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:03,260
sex bots like the war queen, that you show him being horrible, but present him as wonderful,

38
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,260
and he wants to take over a random girl's life for her own protection, but that's okay

39
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,260
because she doesn't think that her liberty, her mind, or her free will are worth anything.

40
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,260
That's a twist that works, because it's exactly what happens.

41
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,260
That's exactly what happens.

42
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,260
So, that's quite perfect, actually.

43
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,260
That's quite perfect.

44
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,260
This one I like, where the alien is some kind of zoologist, his species is at war with another

45
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,260
earth, is seen as some kind of nature preserve that's in danger of being contaminated, so

46
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,260
there's a little prime directive going on in there.

47
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,260
A little bestial.

48
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,260
Yeah, a little bestial.

49
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,260
By far the one that got the most likes, and that was what I probably liked the most, came

50
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,260
from Christopher Emmett, and it's about our average, everyday, pale heroine who is just

51
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,260
like you, average, everyday female reader, falls in love with a dashingly androgynous

52
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,260
alien from beyond the stars, but in a twist, the alien species excretes a mind-controlling

53
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,260
brain worm during sexual intercourse.

54
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,260
Usually, when the aliens sex each other, they both have total control over each other's

55
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,260
faculties, but between a human and an alien, it results in the alien's complete domination

56
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,260
of the human's brain, and he doesn't want to put her through that because he respects

57
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,260
her autonomy.

58
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,260
Oh, so you've got to save it for never.

59
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,260
Yeah, because he's like, no, I don't want to put you through that.

60
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,260
She's like, no, I want it.

61
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,260
So, we have some interesting qualms about autonomy and how she really, really doesn't

62
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,260
value hers.

63
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,260
So, that would be interesting.

64
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:23,260
It goes on to be like, he masturbates and creates a sentient brain slug that becomes

65
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,260
the ethnic third wheel.

66
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,260
We can't do that because boys don't masturbate.

67
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,260
Yeah.

68
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,260
Love interests.

69
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,260
What are you talking about?

70
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,260
They take long, moody walks in the woods.

71
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:39,260
Samantha Jo Dyer suggests that there be a men in blacks trying to take my boyfriend

72
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,260
away angle.

73
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,260
Would the third wheel then be a member of the men in black then?

74
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,260
That would be interesting.

75
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:52,260
If we wanted to go with the mantis man, the gimmick is that if they have sex, she'll

76
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,260
turn into a monster and eat him.

77
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,260
Or it's kind of reverse.

78
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,260
He'll do that to her.

79
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,260
Double danger.

80
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,260
It's got that lion, lamb thing.

81
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,260
Well, because that's the vampire thing.

82
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,260
He doesn't want to hurt her.

83
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,260
He doesn't want to eat her.

84
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,260
Yeah.

85
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,260
But she's just so damn delicious smelling.

86
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,260
Mm.

87
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,260
Lady.

88
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,260
Lady flesh.

89
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:18,260
Dan suggested 50 sides of gray based off of that old book Flatland.

90
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,260
It's an interdimensional love story.

91
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:37,260
So the thing, I think by far the most common one we got was based on that one little throwaway

92
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,260
line you said on the first ten.

93
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:46,260
We want to go on a journey of self-discovery in the Lovecraftian sense.

94
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,260
This was not my attempt to seed anything in your heads or anything like that.

95
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,260
Or was it?

96
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:57,260
But far and away the most popular, the most requested one was Twilight with Hulu.

97
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,260
There's sexy Hulu.

98
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,260
Sexy Hulu.

99
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,260
Yeah.

100
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,260
Yeah.

101
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,260
He's saving the world.

102
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,260
This was my initial appeal to this idea with Lovecraftian Twilight.

103
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:20,260
And it's basically that a lot of the outrage poured over the Twilight series is based on

104
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:25,260
people being mad that Stephenie Meyer got the lore so wrong.

105
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:30,260
And so with Lovecraft- Vampires don't sparkle!

106
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:37,260
So with the Lovecraft, you find a lot of the appeal to it is he creates this incredibly

107
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:46,260
vast, nihilistic universe with these beings that just shine a spotlight on the sheer smallness

108
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,260
and inconsequential nature of human existence.

109
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,260
Smaller than ants.

110
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:54,260
Yeah, we are just so tiny in the great expanse of existence and then we could just write

111
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,260
this book that just shits all over them.

112
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,260
And then we teach the great old ones about love.

113
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:05,260
The more we thought about it, the more enough that everything within me as a human being

114
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:12,260
just wanted to go to the sandbox of HP Lovecraft and just start kicking shit around.

115
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,260
Throw my cat in there and go, no, leave a present.

116
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,260
Leave a present.

117
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,260
Oh, just think of the outrage.

118
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,260
Oh, the delicious outrage.

119
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:25,260
No, I mean, you see that a lot in Alien, like Abyss and the remake especially of The Day

120
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:31,260
Our Ears Stood Still where it's like, you know, the aliens show up and we teach them

121
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,260
about our value because we love.

122
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,260
Yes, like that's the only reason they don't destroy us because we love.

123
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,260
And we teach them to love.

124
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,260
And we have love, which means we try.

125
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,260
Then you think about the logic behind it and you're like, really, that's the only thing

126
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,260
saving us, our love?

127
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,260
Mm-hmm.

128
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,260
We love.

129
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,260
That's all we got, man.

130
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,260
It's all we have.

131
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,260
That's all we got.

132
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,260
Fucking planet of ours.

133
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:56,260
You know, someone, you know, whips out that Necronomicon and like the great old ones are

134
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,260
in high scope, which is amazing.

135
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:04,260
But mind you, the Elder Gods could have been aliens who came to Earth.

136
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:09,260
It could be that, that they came and they were just like, woo, stopping grounds.

137
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,260
Come on, man.

138
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,260
Well, I mean.

139
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,260
Isn't this fun to drive them mad?

140
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,260
Yeah.

141
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:20,260
Can we like bring in like that Robert Frost poem of like fire and ice?

142
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:25,260
Like, could that be our attempt to making it deep and profound by including Robert Frost

143
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,260
poetry?

144
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,260
No.

145
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,260
All right.

146
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,260
You know what?

147
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,260
You want to see how this dumb shit begins?

148
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,260
All right.

149
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,260
All right.

150
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,260
Break it out.

151
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,260
Fucking Genesis.

152
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,260
Genesis?

153
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,260
Genesis.

154
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,260
What is it?

155
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:41,260
But the tree of knowledge and good of evil, thou shalt not eat it for that day thou eatest

156
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,260
thereof, thou shalt surely die.

157
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,260
That's why there's an apple on the cover of this.

158
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,260
Huh.

159
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:52,260
It's the dumbest shit because it's like she learns about, like we're equating learning

160
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,260
about vampires with the fall of man.

161
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,260
It's just like the dumbest.

162
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,260
Whatever.

163
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,260
Fuck you, Stephanie Meyer.

164
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:03,260
Another interesting element to this genre, and you see it in Beautiful Creatures too.

165
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,260
It'd be like, no, you humans got it wrong.

166
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,260
It was this thing.

167
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,260
No, we're not witches.

168
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,260
We're casters.

169
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,260
No, we don't explode in the sun.

170
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,260
We're sparkly.

171
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:16,260
So it's like with the great old ones, it's like, no, we're not hundreds of meters tall

172
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,260
octopus man.

173
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:23,260
That was an image I put in your head, or this guy's head, and it drove him insane.

174
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,260
I'm actually really hot.

175
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,260
Yeah.

176
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,260
He was a baby Elder God.

177
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,260
Yeah, he's only like five million.

178
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,260
And then he went to sleep for, you know, sleep and dreaming.

179
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,260
Yeah, well, he's like the hasty aunt.

180
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,260
He's quick-paced.

181
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,260
He's quick-paced.

182
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,260
He once interrupted an Elder God before he finished his sentence.

183
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:45,260
Yeah, it's like we were afraid of them because we don't understand them.

184
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,260
So we narrow it down.

185
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:53,260
Are we going to stick with the traditional Roswell alien boyfriend or Cthulhu Lovecraft

186
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,260
shit all over everything that people hold sacred?

187
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,260
But then we get to shoe a horn in a plot of having to save the world.

188
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,260
Yeah, they have to save the world.

189
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:09,260
And if we do do Lovecraft, what contrived nonsense do we come up with to justify why

190
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:15,260
the young, sexy, great old one is in high school?

191
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,260
I think the third wheel should read from the book that summons them but entrapping them

192
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,260
within human form.

193
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,260
Yeah, we were also thinking, like, originally the Necronomicon was a...

194
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,260
Family heirloom or something.

195
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,260
Yeah, it was an heirloom by the mad Arab.

196
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,260
Yeah, like the ethnic third wheel has the Necronomicon.

197
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,260
Like, basically from Damascus into India.

198
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,260
Yeah.

199
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:41,260
It could be, like, the Black Plague Handle of Hocus Pocus when he reads out of it on a dare.

200
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,260
And brings about the end of the world.

201
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,260
But the end of the world is so sexy.

202
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,260
But it's so sexy.

203
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,260
It's so sexy.

204
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,260
Guys, we're getting really excited about Lovecraft.

205
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,260
He's like, if you see me you'll go mad.

206
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,260
She's like, I won't.

207
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,260
And then somehow she does and she doesn't go mad.

208
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,260
She's like, you're beautiful.

209
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,260
All those tentacles.

210
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,260
Unless there's a great public outcry, we're gonna go with the...

211
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:17,260
Guys, he's wearing a fucking kilt and he has a sword.

212
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,260
Come on, guys.

213
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,260
You know in your soul you want this.

214
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,260
He saves the world so he can destroy it.

215
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:28,260
So in the event that we do go with this is our premise, we need to figure out our plot.

216
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,260
So let's start having discussions on plot.

217
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:37,260
What contrived nonsense gets our eldritch abomination into high school in the first place?

218
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,260
Or why does our main love interest...

219
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:45,260
What makes her so important to the end of the world or to preventing it?

220
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,260
And how does the third wheel enter into it?

221
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,260
Mr. Family Heirloom Indian.

222
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,260
Yeah, he's got the Necronomicon.

223
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,260
But how does that play in?

224
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,260
Is it like the Black Flame Candle?

225
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,260
I don't want it to be in this dare.

226
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:04,260
He read on from the dare and the next day there's this sexy new kid in the school.

227
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,260
And why is this eldritch abomination A. sexy, B. in high school?

228
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,260
I was thinking sexy college, but then we can have booze.

229
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,260
Yeah, we're really incorporating this booze element.

230
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:19,260
If you're wondering where this comes from, it's from Shades of Grey.

231
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,260
They drink a lot.

232
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,260
She drinks so much alcohol it explains all her terrible life choices.

233
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,260
Send your responses, ideas, and of course wall things, our woefully bereft wall.

234
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,260
There's more things on it.

235
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:36,260
Send us your ideas and wall things and words of support, condemnations,

236
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,260
assumptions that we don't know shit about BDSM, whatever,

237
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,260
at SheaApocalypse on Twitter.

238
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:48,260
You can also follow SexyAlienBook because I retweet plenty of things there.

239
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,260
And of course we do read comments where we find them.

240
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,260
If you're afraid of the Facebook, you can use Twitter.

241
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,260
Otherwise, leave them on SheaApocalypse.com,

242
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:01,260
which is where our most interesting conversations have developed so far.

243
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:09,260
And also on our Blip page at 50shadesofgreen.blip.tv.

244
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:15,260
Next week we will be focusing on your suggestions of what you've thrown at us for plot,

245
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,260
but mostly we have to figure out who are our characters.

246
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:24,260
Why is our hollow shell of a lady protagonist special to them?

247
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,260
Why is our third wheel the third wheel?

248
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,260
Because he's not white.

249
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,260
Because he's not white.

250
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:37,260
And how do we fill out the rest of our cast of paper-thin characters that do not matter?

251
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:41,260
Should our Cthulhu have a bunch of other Elder God family members?

252
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,260
Yeah! We could have a Carlisle!

253
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,260
And an Alice!

254
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,260
And a nice one, and then there's like a bitch that hates her.

255
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,260
Yeah.

256
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,260
And they really resent the fact that they all have to take human form when she's around.

257
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,260
Because, you know, they're like, if we don't you'll just go mad with your tiny little brain.

258
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,260
Ugh!

259
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,260
You can be dumb and abusive at the same time.

260
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,260
And I'd be so cute!

261
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,260
Who knew?

262
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,260
You can be both!
