0	9320	So last week, we asked for your input as to what our gimmick was and what our book is
9320	10320	about.
10320	15760	And you guys certainly came through with plenty, many, many suggestions.
15760	19360	And the problem was, honestly, they were too good, most of them.
19360	21600	And it was a really great treasure trove of prompts.
21600	25640	People were giving me ideas, and I was like, go write this now!
25640	27640	Write this for me now!
27640	29720	You do it, publish it, and I'll read it.
29720	34280	And I will read it, and I will, like, pimp you, and you can be like, yeah, I wrote this
34280	37560	prompt on Fifty Shades of Green, and then I did it, and it was, like, actually good.
37560	43240	And, of course, nobody read it, because it was worthwhile.
43240	50400	This one's from V. Voltaire, where his idea, or her, is that our young heroine has always
50400	54040	been displeased with her oddly pale skin and her dark eyes.
54040	55400	So strange!
55400	59340	But then one day, at her typical middle-class high school, she notices that the teachers
59460	63380	are all going around with mind slugs, and no one else seems to notice.
63380	68340	See, in this one, she's special because she can see the mind slugs, and the good guy alien
68340	69340	love interests.
69340	71340	It's like, why can't you see the love slugs?
71340	73340	Yeah, he's like, you're special.
73340	77860	Here's one from Sean, that if we do go with Twilight with robots, the epic third wheel
77860	84740	has to be the robot tech support guy, and he works on the robot love interest.
84740	89260	I just like this one from Lucas, because it's our young, insecure protagonist's name is
89260	90260	Amora.
90260	92260	It can also be Luna.
92260	96260	That's suggesting that we should actually make the guy evil, and while that would be
96260	98260	a twist, that's not how these books work.
98260	99260	Yeah.
99260	101260	There's too much of a twist by doing that.
101260	103260	You see, we really can't have a...
103260	104260	There's literally no twist.
104260	105260	There's no twist.
105260	111260	The only twist is that, oh my god, you're a witch, alien, vampire, werewolf.
111260	112260	Yeah.
112260	113260	That's the twist.
113260	118260	Having to go again with Tracy Pennington's comment of that you need to make your alien
118260	123260	sex bots like the war queen, that you show him being horrible, but present him as wonderful,
123260	126260	and he wants to take over a random girl's life for her own protection, but that's okay
126260	130260	because she doesn't think that her liberty, her mind, or her free will are worth anything.
130260	132260	That's a twist that works, because it's exactly what happens.
132260	134260	That's exactly what happens.
134260	136260	So, that's quite perfect, actually.
136260	137260	That's quite perfect.
137260	141260	This one I like, where the alien is some kind of zoologist, his species is at war with another
141260	144260	earth, is seen as some kind of nature preserve that's in danger of being contaminated, so
144260	147260	there's a little prime directive going on in there.
147260	148260	A little bestial.
148260	149260	Yeah, a little bestial.
149260	154260	By far the one that got the most likes, and that was what I probably liked the most, came
154260	159260	from Christopher Emmett, and it's about our average, everyday, pale heroine who is just
159260	163260	like you, average, everyday female reader, falls in love with a dashingly androgynous
163260	168260	alien from beyond the stars, but in a twist, the alien species excretes a mind-controlling
168260	170260	brain worm during sexual intercourse.
170260	173260	Usually, when the aliens sex each other, they both have total control over each other's
174260	178260	faculties, but between a human and an alien, it results in the alien's complete domination
178260	182260	of the human's brain, and he doesn't want to put her through that because he respects
182260	183260	her autonomy.
183260	185260	Oh, so you've got to save it for never.
185260	188260	Yeah, because he's like, no, I don't want to put you through that.
188260	190260	She's like, no, I want it.
190260	195260	So, we have some interesting qualms about autonomy and how she really, really doesn't
195260	196260	value hers.
196260	198260	So, that would be interesting.
198260	203260	It goes on to be like, he masturbates and creates a sentient brain slug that becomes
203260	205260	the ethnic third wheel.
207260	209260	We can't do that because boys don't masturbate.
209260	210260	Yeah.
210260	211260	Love interests.
211260	212260	What are you talking about?
212260	214260	They take long, moody walks in the woods.
214260	219260	Samantha Jo Dyer suggests that there be a men in blacks trying to take my boyfriend
219260	220260	away angle.
220260	224260	Would the third wheel then be a member of the men in black then?
224260	226260	That would be interesting.
227260	232260	If we wanted to go with the mantis man, the gimmick is that if they have sex, she'll
232260	234260	turn into a monster and eat him.
234260	236260	Or it's kind of reverse.
236260	238260	He'll do that to her.
238260	239260	Double danger.
239260	241260	It's got that lion, lamb thing.
241260	243260	Well, because that's the vampire thing.
243260	244260	He doesn't want to hurt her.
244260	245260	He doesn't want to eat her.
245260	246260	Yeah.
246260	248260	But she's just so damn delicious smelling.
248260	249260	Mm.
249260	250260	Lady.
250260	251260	Lady flesh.
252260	258260	Dan suggested 50 sides of gray based off of that old book Flatland.
262260	265260	It's an interdimensional love story.
269260	277260	So the thing, I think by far the most common one we got was based on that one little throwaway
277260	280260	line you said on the first ten.
280260	286260	We want to go on a journey of self-discovery in the Lovecraftian sense.
286260	290260	This was not my attempt to seed anything in your heads or anything like that.
290260	291260	Or was it?
291260	297260	But far and away the most popular, the most requested one was Twilight with Hulu.
301260	302260	There's sexy Hulu.
302260	303260	Sexy Hulu.
303260	304260	Yeah.
304260	305260	Yeah.
305260	306260	He's saving the world.
306260	310260	This was my initial appeal to this idea with Lovecraftian Twilight.
310260	320260	And it's basically that a lot of the outrage poured over the Twilight series is based on
320260	325260	people being mad that Stephenie Meyer got the lore so wrong.
325260	330260	And so with Lovecraft- Vampires don't sparkle!
330260	337260	So with the Lovecraft, you find a lot of the appeal to it is he creates this incredibly
337260	346260	vast, nihilistic universe with these beings that just shine a spotlight on the sheer smallness
346260	349260	and inconsequential nature of human existence.
349260	350260	Smaller than ants.
350260	354260	Yeah, we are just so tiny in the great expanse of existence and then we could just write
354260	357260	this book that just shits all over them.
357260	360260	And then we teach the great old ones about love.
360260	365260	The more we thought about it, the more enough that everything within me as a human being
365260	372260	just wanted to go to the sandbox of HP Lovecraft and just start kicking shit around.
372260	374260	Throw my cat in there and go, no, leave a present.
374260	376260	Leave a present.
376260	378260	Oh, just think of the outrage.
378260	380260	Oh, the delicious outrage.
380260	385260	No, I mean, you see that a lot in Alien, like Abyss and the remake especially of The Day
385260	391260	Our Ears Stood Still where it's like, you know, the aliens show up and we teach them
391260	393260	about our value because we love.
393260	397260	Yes, like that's the only reason they don't destroy us because we love.
397260	398260	And we teach them to love.
398260	401260	And we have love, which means we try.
401260	404260	Then you think about the logic behind it and you're like, really, that's the only thing
404260	405260	saving us, our love?
405260	406260	Mm-hmm.
406260	407260	We love.
407260	408260	That's all we got, man.
408260	409260	It's all we have.
409260	410260	That's all we got.
410260	411260	Fucking planet of ours.
411260	416260	You know, someone, you know, whips out that Necronomicon and like the great old ones are
416260	418260	in high scope, which is amazing.
418260	424260	But mind you, the Elder Gods could have been aliens who came to Earth.
424260	429260	It could be that, that they came and they were just like, woo, stopping grounds.
429260	431260	Come on, man.
431260	432260	Well, I mean.
432260	434260	Isn't this fun to drive them mad?
434260	435260	Yeah.
435260	440260	Can we like bring in like that Robert Frost poem of like fire and ice?
440260	445260	Like, could that be our attempt to making it deep and profound by including Robert Frost
445260	446260	poetry?
446260	447260	No.
447260	448260	All right.
448260	449260	You know what?
449260	450260	You want to see how this dumb shit begins?
450260	451260	All right.
451260	452260	All right.
452260	453260	Break it out.
453260	454260	Fucking Genesis.
454260	455260	Genesis?
455260	456260	Genesis.
456260	457260	What is it?
457260	461260	But the tree of knowledge and good of evil, thou shalt not eat it for that day thou eatest
461260	463260	thereof, thou shalt surely die.
463260	466260	That's why there's an apple on the cover of this.
466260	467260	Huh.
467260	472260	It's the dumbest shit because it's like she learns about, like we're equating learning
472260	474260	about vampires with the fall of man.
474260	475260	It's just like the dumbest.
475260	476260	Whatever.
476260	477260	Fuck you, Stephanie Meyer.
477260	483260	Another interesting element to this genre, and you see it in Beautiful Creatures too.
483260	485260	It'd be like, no, you humans got it wrong.
485260	487260	It was this thing.
487260	488260	No, we're not witches.
488260	489260	We're casters.
489260	490260	No, we don't explode in the sun.
490260	491260	We're sparkly.
491260	496260	So it's like with the great old ones, it's like, no, we're not hundreds of meters tall
497260	498260	octopus man.
498260	503260	That was an image I put in your head, or this guy's head, and it drove him insane.
503260	505260	I'm actually really hot.
505260	506260	Yeah.
506260	507260	He was a baby Elder God.
507260	509260	Yeah, he's only like five million.
509260	512260	And then he went to sleep for, you know, sleep and dreaming.
512260	514260	Yeah, well, he's like the hasty aunt.
514260	515260	He's quick-paced.
515260	516260	He's quick-paced.
516260	520260	He once interrupted an Elder God before he finished his sentence.
520260	525260	Yeah, it's like we were afraid of them because we don't understand them.
526260	528260	So we narrow it down.
528260	533260	Are we going to stick with the traditional Roswell alien boyfriend or Cthulhu Lovecraft
533260	536260	shit all over everything that people hold sacred?
536260	540260	But then we get to shoe a horn in a plot of having to save the world.
540260	541260	Yeah, they have to save the world.
541260	549260	And if we do do Lovecraft, what contrived nonsense do we come up with to justify why
550260	555260	the young, sexy, great old one is in high school?
555260	559260	I think the third wheel should read from the book that summons them but entrapping them
559260	560260	within human form.
560260	563260	Yeah, we were also thinking, like, originally the Necronomicon was a...
563260	565260	Family heirloom or something.
565260	568260	Yeah, it was an heirloom by the mad Arab.
568260	571260	Yeah, like the ethnic third wheel has the Necronomicon.
571260	574260	Like, basically from Damascus into India.
574260	575260	Yeah.
576260	581260	It could be, like, the Black Plague Handle of Hocus Pocus when he reads out of it on a dare.
585260	587260	And brings about the end of the world.
588260	590260	But the end of the world is so sexy.
590260	592260	But it's so sexy.
592260	593260	It's so sexy.
593260	595260	Guys, we're getting really excited about Lovecraft.
595260	598260	He's like, if you see me you'll go mad.
598260	599260	She's like, I won't.
599260	601260	And then somehow she does and she doesn't go mad.
601260	603260	She's like, you're beautiful.
606260	607260	All those tentacles.
609260	612260	Unless there's a great public outcry, we're gonna go with the...
612260	617260	Guys, he's wearing a fucking kilt and he has a sword.
617260	618260	Come on, guys.
618260	620260	You know in your soul you want this.
620260	622260	He saves the world so he can destroy it.
622260	628260	So in the event that we do go with this is our premise, we need to figure out our plot.
628260	631260	So let's start having discussions on plot.
631260	637260	What contrived nonsense gets our eldritch abomination into high school in the first place?
637260	640260	Or why does our main love interest...
640260	645260	What makes her so important to the end of the world or to preventing it?
645260	647260	And how does the third wheel enter into it?
647260	649260	Mr. Family Heirloom Indian.
649260	651260	Yeah, he's got the Necronomicon.
651260	653260	But how does that play in?
653260	655260	Is it like the Black Flame Candle?
656260	658260	I don't want it to be in this dare.
658260	664260	He read on from the dare and the next day there's this sexy new kid in the school.
664260	668260	And why is this eldritch abomination A. sexy, B. in high school?
669260	672260	I was thinking sexy college, but then we can have booze.
672260	675260	Yeah, we're really incorporating this booze element.
675260	679260	If you're wondering where this comes from, it's from Shades of Grey.
679260	680260	They drink a lot.
680260	684260	She drinks so much alcohol it explains all her terrible life choices.
684260	688260	Send your responses, ideas, and of course wall things, our woefully bereft wall.
688260	689260	There's more things on it.
689260	696260	Send us your ideas and wall things and words of support, condemnations,
696260	700260	assumptions that we don't know shit about BDSM, whatever,
700260	702260	at SheaApocalypse on Twitter.
702260	708260	You can also follow SexyAlienBook because I retweet plenty of things there.
708260	710260	And of course we do read comments where we find them.
710260	712260	If you're afraid of the Facebook, you can use Twitter.
712260	716260	Otherwise, leave them on SheaApocalypse.com,
716260	721260	which is where our most interesting conversations have developed so far.
721260	729260	And also on our Blip page at 50shadesofgreen.blip.tv.
729260	735260	Next week we will be focusing on your suggestions of what you've thrown at us for plot,
735260	738260	but mostly we have to figure out who are our characters.
738260	744260	Why is our hollow shell of a lady protagonist special to them?
744260	747260	Why is our third wheel the third wheel?
747260	748260	Because he's not white.
748260	749260	Because he's not white.
749260	757260	And how do we fill out the rest of our cast of paper-thin characters that do not matter?
757260	761260	Should our Cthulhu have a bunch of other Elder God family members?
761260	763260	Yeah! We could have a Carlisle!
763260	765260	And an Alice!
765260	768260	And a nice one, and then there's like a bitch that hates her.
768260	769260	Yeah.
769260	773260	And they really resent the fact that they all have to take human form when she's around.
773260	777260	Because, you know, they're like, if we don't you'll just go mad with your tiny little brain.
777260	778260	Ugh!
786260	788260	You can be dumb and abusive at the same time.
788260	789260	And I'd be so cute!
789260	790260	Who knew?
790260	791260	You can be both!
