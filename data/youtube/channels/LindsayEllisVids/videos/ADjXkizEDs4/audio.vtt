WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.320
So last week, we asked for your input as to what our gimmick was and what our book is

00:09.320 --> 00:10.320
about.

00:10.320 --> 00:15.760
And you guys certainly came through with plenty, many, many suggestions.

00:15.760 --> 00:19.360
And the problem was, honestly, they were too good, most of them.

00:19.360 --> 00:21.600
And it was a really great treasure trove of prompts.

00:21.600 --> 00:25.640
People were giving me ideas, and I was like, go write this now!

00:25.640 --> 00:27.640
Write this for me now!

00:27.640 --> 00:29.720
You do it, publish it, and I'll read it.

00:29.720 --> 00:34.280
And I will read it, and I will, like, pimp you, and you can be like, yeah, I wrote this

00:34.280 --> 00:37.560
prompt on Fifty Shades of Green, and then I did it, and it was, like, actually good.

00:37.560 --> 00:43.240
And, of course, nobody read it, because it was worthwhile.

00:43.240 --> 00:50.400
This one's from V. Voltaire, where his idea, or her, is that our young heroine has always

00:50.400 --> 00:54.040
been displeased with her oddly pale skin and her dark eyes.

00:54.040 --> 00:55.400
So strange!

00:55.400 --> 00:59.340
But then one day, at her typical middle-class high school, she notices that the teachers

00:59.460 --> 01:03.380
are all going around with mind slugs, and no one else seems to notice.

01:03.380 --> 01:08.340
See, in this one, she's special because she can see the mind slugs, and the good guy alien

01:08.340 --> 01:09.340
love interests.

01:09.340 --> 01:11.340
It's like, why can't you see the love slugs?

01:11.340 --> 01:13.340
Yeah, he's like, you're special.

01:13.340 --> 01:17.860
Here's one from Sean, that if we do go with Twilight with robots, the epic third wheel

01:17.860 --> 01:24.740
has to be the robot tech support guy, and he works on the robot love interest.

01:24.740 --> 01:29.260
I just like this one from Lucas, because it's our young, insecure protagonist's name is

01:29.260 --> 01:30.260
Amora.

01:30.260 --> 01:32.260
It can also be Luna.

01:32.260 --> 01:36.260
That's suggesting that we should actually make the guy evil, and while that would be

01:36.260 --> 01:38.260
a twist, that's not how these books work.

01:38.260 --> 01:39.260
Yeah.

01:39.260 --> 01:41.260
There's too much of a twist by doing that.

01:41.260 --> 01:43.260
You see, we really can't have a...

01:43.260 --> 01:44.260
There's literally no twist.

01:44.260 --> 01:45.260
There's no twist.

01:45.260 --> 01:51.260
The only twist is that, oh my god, you're a witch, alien, vampire, werewolf.

01:51.260 --> 01:52.260
Yeah.

01:52.260 --> 01:53.260
That's the twist.

01:53.260 --> 01:58.260
Having to go again with Tracy Pennington's comment of that you need to make your alien

01:58.260 --> 02:03.260
sex bots like the war queen, that you show him being horrible, but present him as wonderful,

02:03.260 --> 02:06.260
and he wants to take over a random girl's life for her own protection, but that's okay

02:06.260 --> 02:10.260
because she doesn't think that her liberty, her mind, or her free will are worth anything.

02:10.260 --> 02:12.260
That's a twist that works, because it's exactly what happens.

02:12.260 --> 02:14.260
That's exactly what happens.

02:14.260 --> 02:16.260
So, that's quite perfect, actually.

02:16.260 --> 02:17.260
That's quite perfect.

02:17.260 --> 02:21.260
This one I like, where the alien is some kind of zoologist, his species is at war with another

02:21.260 --> 02:24.260
earth, is seen as some kind of nature preserve that's in danger of being contaminated, so

02:24.260 --> 02:27.260
there's a little prime directive going on in there.

02:27.260 --> 02:28.260
A little bestial.

02:28.260 --> 02:29.260
Yeah, a little bestial.

02:29.260 --> 02:34.260
By far the one that got the most likes, and that was what I probably liked the most, came

02:34.260 --> 02:39.260
from Christopher Emmett, and it's about our average, everyday, pale heroine who is just

02:39.260 --> 02:43.260
like you, average, everyday female reader, falls in love with a dashingly androgynous

02:43.260 --> 02:48.260
alien from beyond the stars, but in a twist, the alien species excretes a mind-controlling

02:48.260 --> 02:50.260
brain worm during sexual intercourse.

02:50.260 --> 02:53.260
Usually, when the aliens sex each other, they both have total control over each other's

02:54.260 --> 02:58.260
faculties, but between a human and an alien, it results in the alien's complete domination

02:58.260 --> 03:02.260
of the human's brain, and he doesn't want to put her through that because he respects

03:02.260 --> 03:03.260
her autonomy.

03:03.260 --> 03:05.260
Oh, so you've got to save it for never.

03:05.260 --> 03:08.260
Yeah, because he's like, no, I don't want to put you through that.

03:08.260 --> 03:10.260
She's like, no, I want it.

03:10.260 --> 03:15.260
So, we have some interesting qualms about autonomy and how she really, really doesn't

03:15.260 --> 03:16.260
value hers.

03:16.260 --> 03:18.260
So, that would be interesting.

03:18.260 --> 03:23.260
It goes on to be like, he masturbates and creates a sentient brain slug that becomes

03:23.260 --> 03:25.260
the ethnic third wheel.

03:27.260 --> 03:29.260
We can't do that because boys don't masturbate.

03:29.260 --> 03:30.260
Yeah.

03:30.260 --> 03:31.260
Love interests.

03:31.260 --> 03:32.260
What are you talking about?

03:32.260 --> 03:34.260
They take long, moody walks in the woods.

03:34.260 --> 03:39.260
Samantha Jo Dyer suggests that there be a men in blacks trying to take my boyfriend

03:39.260 --> 03:40.260
away angle.

03:40.260 --> 03:44.260
Would the third wheel then be a member of the men in black then?

03:44.260 --> 03:46.260
That would be interesting.

03:47.260 --> 03:52.260
If we wanted to go with the mantis man, the gimmick is that if they have sex, she'll

03:52.260 --> 03:54.260
turn into a monster and eat him.

03:54.260 --> 03:56.260
Or it's kind of reverse.

03:56.260 --> 03:58.260
He'll do that to her.

03:58.260 --> 03:59.260
Double danger.

03:59.260 --> 04:01.260
It's got that lion, lamb thing.

04:01.260 --> 04:03.260
Well, because that's the vampire thing.

04:03.260 --> 04:04.260
He doesn't want to hurt her.

04:04.260 --> 04:05.260
He doesn't want to eat her.

04:05.260 --> 04:06.260
Yeah.

04:06.260 --> 04:08.260
But she's just so damn delicious smelling.

04:08.260 --> 04:09.260
Mm.

04:09.260 --> 04:10.260
Lady.

04:10.260 --> 04:11.260
Lady flesh.

04:12.260 --> 04:18.260
Dan suggested 50 sides of gray based off of that old book Flatland.

04:22.260 --> 04:25.260
It's an interdimensional love story.

04:29.260 --> 04:37.260
So the thing, I think by far the most common one we got was based on that one little throwaway

04:37.260 --> 04:40.260
line you said on the first ten.

04:40.260 --> 04:46.260
We want to go on a journey of self-discovery in the Lovecraftian sense.

04:46.260 --> 04:50.260
This was not my attempt to seed anything in your heads or anything like that.

04:50.260 --> 04:51.260
Or was it?

04:51.260 --> 04:57.260
But far and away the most popular, the most requested one was Twilight with Hulu.

05:01.260 --> 05:02.260
There's sexy Hulu.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.260
Sexy Hulu.

05:03.260 --> 05:04.260
Yeah.

05:04.260 --> 05:05.260
Yeah.

05:05.260 --> 05:06.260
He's saving the world.

05:06.260 --> 05:10.260
This was my initial appeal to this idea with Lovecraftian Twilight.

05:10.260 --> 05:20.260
And it's basically that a lot of the outrage poured over the Twilight series is based on

05:20.260 --> 05:25.260
people being mad that Stephenie Meyer got the lore so wrong.

05:25.260 --> 05:30.260
And so with Lovecraft- Vampires don't sparkle!

05:30.260 --> 05:37.260
So with the Lovecraft, you find a lot of the appeal to it is he creates this incredibly

05:37.260 --> 05:46.260
vast, nihilistic universe with these beings that just shine a spotlight on the sheer smallness

05:46.260 --> 05:49.260
and inconsequential nature of human existence.

05:49.260 --> 05:50.260
Smaller than ants.

05:50.260 --> 05:54.260
Yeah, we are just so tiny in the great expanse of existence and then we could just write

05:54.260 --> 05:57.260
this book that just shits all over them.

05:57.260 --> 06:00.260
And then we teach the great old ones about love.

06:00.260 --> 06:05.260
The more we thought about it, the more enough that everything within me as a human being

06:05.260 --> 06:12.260
just wanted to go to the sandbox of HP Lovecraft and just start kicking shit around.

06:12.260 --> 06:14.260
Throw my cat in there and go, no, leave a present.

06:14.260 --> 06:16.260
Leave a present.

06:16.260 --> 06:18.260
Oh, just think of the outrage.

06:18.260 --> 06:20.260
Oh, the delicious outrage.

06:20.260 --> 06:25.260
No, I mean, you see that a lot in Alien, like Abyss and the remake especially of The Day

06:25.260 --> 06:31.260
Our Ears Stood Still where it's like, you know, the aliens show up and we teach them

06:31.260 --> 06:33.260
about our value because we love.

06:33.260 --> 06:37.260
Yes, like that's the only reason they don't destroy us because we love.

06:37.260 --> 06:38.260
And we teach them to love.

06:38.260 --> 06:41.260
And we have love, which means we try.

06:41.260 --> 06:44.260
Then you think about the logic behind it and you're like, really, that's the only thing

06:44.260 --> 06:45.260
saving us, our love?

06:45.260 --> 06:46.260
Mm-hmm.

06:46.260 --> 06:47.260
We love.

06:47.260 --> 06:48.260
That's all we got, man.

06:48.260 --> 06:49.260
It's all we have.

06:49.260 --> 06:50.260
That's all we got.

06:50.260 --> 06:51.260
Fucking planet of ours.

06:51.260 --> 06:56.260
You know, someone, you know, whips out that Necronomicon and like the great old ones are

06:56.260 --> 06:58.260
in high scope, which is amazing.

06:58.260 --> 07:04.260
But mind you, the Elder Gods could have been aliens who came to Earth.

07:04.260 --> 07:09.260
It could be that, that they came and they were just like, woo, stopping grounds.

07:09.260 --> 07:11.260
Come on, man.

07:11.260 --> 07:12.260
Well, I mean.

07:12.260 --> 07:14.260
Isn't this fun to drive them mad?

07:14.260 --> 07:15.260
Yeah.

07:15.260 --> 07:20.260
Can we like bring in like that Robert Frost poem of like fire and ice?

07:20.260 --> 07:25.260
Like, could that be our attempt to making it deep and profound by including Robert Frost

07:25.260 --> 07:26.260
poetry?

07:26.260 --> 07:27.260
No.

07:27.260 --> 07:28.260
All right.

07:28.260 --> 07:29.260
You know what?

07:29.260 --> 07:30.260
You want to see how this dumb shit begins?

07:30.260 --> 07:31.260
All right.

07:31.260 --> 07:32.260
All right.

07:32.260 --> 07:33.260
Break it out.

07:33.260 --> 07:34.260
Fucking Genesis.

07:34.260 --> 07:35.260
Genesis?

07:35.260 --> 07:36.260
Genesis.

07:36.260 --> 07:37.260
What is it?

07:37.260 --> 07:41.260
But the tree of knowledge and good of evil, thou shalt not eat it for that day thou eatest

07:41.260 --> 07:43.260
thereof, thou shalt surely die.

07:43.260 --> 07:46.260
That's why there's an apple on the cover of this.

07:46.260 --> 07:47.260
Huh.

07:47.260 --> 07:52.260
It's the dumbest shit because it's like she learns about, like we're equating learning

07:52.260 --> 07:54.260
about vampires with the fall of man.

07:54.260 --> 07:55.260
It's just like the dumbest.

07:55.260 --> 07:56.260
Whatever.

07:56.260 --> 07:57.260
Fuck you, Stephanie Meyer.

07:57.260 --> 08:03.260
Another interesting element to this genre, and you see it in Beautiful Creatures too.

08:03.260 --> 08:05.260
It'd be like, no, you humans got it wrong.

08:05.260 --> 08:07.260
It was this thing.

08:07.260 --> 08:08.260
No, we're not witches.

08:08.260 --> 08:09.260
We're casters.

08:09.260 --> 08:10.260
No, we don't explode in the sun.

08:10.260 --> 08:11.260
We're sparkly.

08:11.260 --> 08:16.260
So it's like with the great old ones, it's like, no, we're not hundreds of meters tall

08:17.260 --> 08:18.260
octopus man.

08:18.260 --> 08:23.260
That was an image I put in your head, or this guy's head, and it drove him insane.

08:23.260 --> 08:25.260
I'm actually really hot.

08:25.260 --> 08:26.260
Yeah.

08:26.260 --> 08:27.260
He was a baby Elder God.

08:27.260 --> 08:29.260
Yeah, he's only like five million.

08:29.260 --> 08:32.260
And then he went to sleep for, you know, sleep and dreaming.

08:32.260 --> 08:34.260
Yeah, well, he's like the hasty aunt.

08:34.260 --> 08:35.260
He's quick-paced.

08:35.260 --> 08:36.260
He's quick-paced.

08:36.260 --> 08:40.260
He once interrupted an Elder God before he finished his sentence.

08:40.260 --> 08:45.260
Yeah, it's like we were afraid of them because we don't understand them.

08:46.260 --> 08:48.260
So we narrow it down.

08:48.260 --> 08:53.260
Are we going to stick with the traditional Roswell alien boyfriend or Cthulhu Lovecraft

08:53.260 --> 08:56.260
shit all over everything that people hold sacred?

08:56.260 --> 09:00.260
But then we get to shoe a horn in a plot of having to save the world.

09:00.260 --> 09:01.260
Yeah, they have to save the world.

09:01.260 --> 09:09.260
And if we do do Lovecraft, what contrived nonsense do we come up with to justify why

09:10.260 --> 09:15.260
the young, sexy, great old one is in high school?

09:15.260 --> 09:19.260
I think the third wheel should read from the book that summons them but entrapping them

09:19.260 --> 09:20.260
within human form.

09:20.260 --> 09:23.260
Yeah, we were also thinking, like, originally the Necronomicon was a...

09:23.260 --> 09:25.260
Family heirloom or something.

09:25.260 --> 09:28.260
Yeah, it was an heirloom by the mad Arab.

09:28.260 --> 09:31.260
Yeah, like the ethnic third wheel has the Necronomicon.

09:31.260 --> 09:34.260
Like, basically from Damascus into India.

09:34.260 --> 09:35.260
Yeah.

09:36.260 --> 09:41.260
It could be, like, the Black Plague Handle of Hocus Pocus when he reads out of it on a dare.

09:45.260 --> 09:47.260
And brings about the end of the world.

09:48.260 --> 09:50.260
But the end of the world is so sexy.

09:50.260 --> 09:52.260
But it's so sexy.

09:52.260 --> 09:53.260
It's so sexy.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.260
Guys, we're getting really excited about Lovecraft.

09:55.260 --> 09:58.260
He's like, if you see me you'll go mad.

09:58.260 --> 09:59.260
She's like, I won't.

09:59.260 --> 10:01.260
And then somehow she does and she doesn't go mad.

10:01.260 --> 10:03.260
She's like, you're beautiful.

10:06.260 --> 10:07.260
All those tentacles.

10:09.260 --> 10:12.260
Unless there's a great public outcry, we're gonna go with the...

10:12.260 --> 10:17.260
Guys, he's wearing a fucking kilt and he has a sword.

10:17.260 --> 10:18.260
Come on, guys.

10:18.260 --> 10:20.260
You know in your soul you want this.

10:20.260 --> 10:22.260
He saves the world so he can destroy it.

10:22.260 --> 10:28.260
So in the event that we do go with this is our premise, we need to figure out our plot.

10:28.260 --> 10:31.260
So let's start having discussions on plot.

10:31.260 --> 10:37.260
What contrived nonsense gets our eldritch abomination into high school in the first place?

10:37.260 --> 10:40.260
Or why does our main love interest...

10:40.260 --> 10:45.260
What makes her so important to the end of the world or to preventing it?

10:45.260 --> 10:47.260
And how does the third wheel enter into it?

10:47.260 --> 10:49.260
Mr. Family Heirloom Indian.

10:49.260 --> 10:51.260
Yeah, he's got the Necronomicon.

10:51.260 --> 10:53.260
But how does that play in?

10:53.260 --> 10:55.260
Is it like the Black Flame Candle?

10:56.260 --> 10:58.260
I don't want it to be in this dare.

10:58.260 --> 11:04.260
He read on from the dare and the next day there's this sexy new kid in the school.

11:04.260 --> 11:08.260
And why is this eldritch abomination A. sexy, B. in high school?

11:09.260 --> 11:12.260
I was thinking sexy college, but then we can have booze.

11:12.260 --> 11:15.260
Yeah, we're really incorporating this booze element.

11:15.260 --> 11:19.260
If you're wondering where this comes from, it's from Shades of Grey.

11:19.260 --> 11:20.260
They drink a lot.

11:20.260 --> 11:24.260
She drinks so much alcohol it explains all her terrible life choices.

11:24.260 --> 11:28.260
Send your responses, ideas, and of course wall things, our woefully bereft wall.

11:28.260 --> 11:29.260
There's more things on it.

11:29.260 --> 11:36.260
Send us your ideas and wall things and words of support, condemnations,

11:36.260 --> 11:40.260
assumptions that we don't know shit about BDSM, whatever,

11:40.260 --> 11:42.260
at SheaApocalypse on Twitter.

11:42.260 --> 11:48.260
You can also follow SexyAlienBook because I retweet plenty of things there.

11:48.260 --> 11:50.260
And of course we do read comments where we find them.

11:50.260 --> 11:52.260
If you're afraid of the Facebook, you can use Twitter.

11:52.260 --> 11:56.260
Otherwise, leave them on SheaApocalypse.com,

11:56.260 --> 12:01.260
which is where our most interesting conversations have developed so far.

12:01.260 --> 12:09.260
And also on our Blip page at 50shadesofgreen.blip.tv.

12:09.260 --> 12:15.260
Next week we will be focusing on your suggestions of what you've thrown at us for plot,

12:15.260 --> 12:18.260
but mostly we have to figure out who are our characters.

12:18.260 --> 12:24.260
Why is our hollow shell of a lady protagonist special to them?

12:24.260 --> 12:27.260
Why is our third wheel the third wheel?

12:27.260 --> 12:28.260
Because he's not white.

12:28.260 --> 12:29.260
Because he's not white.

12:29.260 --> 12:37.260
And how do we fill out the rest of our cast of paper-thin characters that do not matter?

12:37.260 --> 12:41.260
Should our Cthulhu have a bunch of other Elder God family members?

12:41.260 --> 12:43.260
Yeah! We could have a Carlisle!

12:43.260 --> 12:45.260
And an Alice!

12:45.260 --> 12:48.260
And a nice one, and then there's like a bitch that hates her.

12:48.260 --> 12:49.260
Yeah.

12:49.260 --> 12:53.260
And they really resent the fact that they all have to take human form when she's around.

12:53.260 --> 12:57.260
Because, you know, they're like, if we don't you'll just go mad with your tiny little brain.

12:57.260 --> 12:58.260
Ugh!

13:06.260 --> 13:08.260
You can be dumb and abusive at the same time.

13:08.260 --> 13:09.260
And I'd be so cute!

13:09.260 --> 13:10.260
Who knew?

13:10.260 --> 13:11.260
You can be both!
