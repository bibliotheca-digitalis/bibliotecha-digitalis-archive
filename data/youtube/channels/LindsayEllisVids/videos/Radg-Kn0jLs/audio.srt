1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The 80s are back, baby.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There's this idea in media criticism called the 30-year cycle.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
When it comes to nostalgia, well really there's a lot of cycle.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
There's a 40-year cycle, a 20-year cycle.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's no coincidence that we're seeing so many sequels and reboots from movies from the mid-1990s.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And in the 90s, there was a lot of media that reflected nostalgia for the 60s and 70s.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And in the 70s and 80s, there was a particular fondness for 1950s nostalgia

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
with the likes of Happy Days, Back to the Future, American Graffiti, and Grease.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
But I find the 30-year cycle is particularly relevant when it comes to visual mass media

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
as that's the one that reflects filmmakers, now probably parents themselves,

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
portraying their vision of their own childhood.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And on the consumer side, you've got this market of people who now have disposable income

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and a lot of rose-colored glasses for their own childhoods.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But it's not just that this 80s revival is happening.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's that it's really, really popular.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And not always in the fun way when we've somehow managed to elect the man

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
who was directly parodized in Back to the Future II.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Who would have thought that with Back to the Future II,

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
you essentially predicted the situation we're in right now with Biff and Donald Trump.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
No, we didn't have... No, no, no, no. We never were audacious enough to think that even Biff would run for president.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Thor Ragnarok features an aesthetic greatly influenced by pulpy sci-fi from the 1980s,

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
from the color scheme to the editing and especially the score.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This was played up heavily in the marketing

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and Thor Ragnarok is already the highest-grossing and most critically successful Thor movie.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But the real barn burners here are It,

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
the feature adaptation of Stephen King's 1986 novel

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and Netflix's streaming sensation Stranger Things.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It defied all expectation by being an R-rated horror movie

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
that grossed approximately one sh** million dollars.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It is currently the number five grossing movie for the year

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and is on a budget of $35 million and with a cast of unknown children.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The nostalgia pendulum still moves and this year it swung hard to the 80s.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Is your finger looking good?

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Just like in the 80s when we were fondly looking back to a sanitized version of the 50s.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So is this just the same old nostalgia pendulum

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
or is the cycle of nostalgia ever going to evolve?

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Grow more sophisticated than...

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Hey, remember the thing?

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
God, you are such a nerd.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The study of nostalgia as it pertains to media trends

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
hit the mainstream with Marc LeSueur's essay

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Anatomy of Nostalgia Films, Heritage and Methods in 1977.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And wouldn't you know, that was the year Star Wars came out,

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
itself a product of a 30-year cycle based on serials from the 1940s and 50s,

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
as well as the highest grossing film in history at the time of its release.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The success of Star Wars meant that the nostalgia pendulum wasn't going to go away,

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
so film academics were like,

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
hey, we should probably figure out what this means and why audiences respond to it.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
For LeSueur, nostalgia was a concept of history,

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
one for which few have attempted to establish the general working principles.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
LeSueur's ideas were expanded upon by Svetlana Boym in the 1990s,

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
developing two main types of nostalgia,

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
restorative nostalgia and reflective nostalgia.

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Restorative nostalgia represents a somewhat aggressive impulse

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
motivating attempts to recapture and revitalize an imagined past.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
To, uh, make America great again, if you will.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Reflective nostalgia is escapist in nature

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
and characterized by wistful longings for what has become lost to time.

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
According to LeSueur,

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
reflective nostalgia is most typically experienced for eras historically unremarkable,

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
devoid of momentous or social political events,

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and thus characterized by simplicity and stability,

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
which is why 50s nostalgia in the 80s is so relevant.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The 1950s was not a stable time in world history.

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Be like Bert when there is a flash, duck, and cover and do it fast.

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But the day-to-day kind of felt like that for some people,

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and nostalgia has framed it as such.

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Simplicity and stability certainly do figure into mythic conceptions

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
of the 1950s.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah, well, I saw it on a rerun.

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's a rerun.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And nostalgia does indeed become attached to moments

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
immediately preceding significant change,

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
which is why in America, at least,

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
nostalgia is more attached to the 1950s than to the 1960s.

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Isn't it great there's only white people here?

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
LeSueur suggests that nostalgia attaches itself to aspects

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
of the past which have not fully exhausted themselves,

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
including practices and desires which continue to have relevance into the present.

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But in addition to this idea of restorative and reflective nostalgia,

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'd like to suggest another type of nostalgia, deconstructive.

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We can duck and cover.

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
There's a fallout shelter right there.

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
There's no way to survive this, you idiot!

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You mean we're all going to...

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
To die, Mansley, for our country.

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's still nostalgic.

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
There's always something comforting about retreating into the past,

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
but it's also more critical of the past rather than affirming or reconstructive.

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
One of the best examples of a movie that is deconstructive is The Iron Giant,

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
which was made in the 1990s and takes place in the 1950s.

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You think this metal man is fun, but who built it?

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The Russians, the Chinese, Martians, Canadians?

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I don't care!

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
All I know is we didn't build it,

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
and that's reason enough to assume the worst and blow out the cane of gum!

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
To borrow a term from Stranger Things,

98
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
deconstructionist is the upside down of reflective and restorative media.

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And this dichotomy doesn't always have to be nostalgic.

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It can take place in the culture as it happens.

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It challenges our own sense of priority in the universe.

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Well, let's look at two examples of paranormal action movies from the 1980s.

103
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
First, Ghostbusters.

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
A much more, erm, Reagan-y movie than a lot of people remember it.

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I've worked in the private sector. They expect results.

106
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Ghostbusters is effectively the story of four righteous entrepreneurs

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
who start a business with a service that everyone needs and appreciates,

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
but the EPA keeps trying to shut them down because regulation bad.

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Ghostbusters carries some serious pro-capitalist, pro-business subtext.

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So, in a lot of ways, the upside down of Ghostbusters is John Carpenter's They Live.

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And I'm all out of bubblegum.

113
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
They Live was based on a 1963 short story inspired by Invasion of the Body Snatchers,

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
which itself was a product of anxieties over secret communists among us in the 1950s.

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
They have to be destroyed. All of them.

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
They will be. Every one of them.

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
They Live is about a man who, through the use of a pair of magic glasses,

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
realizes that the ruling class are aliens grooming humans to consume and stay in line.

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
There are those out there since the release of this movie who take stories like this to their literal extreme,

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
but most people, including Carpenter himself, see They Live as a parable of consumerism.

121
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Ghostbusters is more affirming of the 1980s hyper-capitalist culture.

122
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
They Live is critical and deconstructionist.

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But that isn't to say that there is necessarily a hard line between deconstructionist and nostalgic.

124
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The Wolf of Wall Street is a good example of a movie that tries to have it both ways.

125
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The 80s sure were debauched and immoral.

126
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Look at these awful people.

127
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But aren't they kind of awesome and fun?

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Look at the consequences.

129
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But don't you also kind of want to be them?

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So, where do Stranger Things and It fall into all of this?

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It wouldn't be a stretch to say that a huge component to the success of Stranger Things

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
is in the way it invokes 80s iconography,

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
from the Drew Struzan-inspired posters, to the Stephen King-inspired opening credits,

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
to the TV Movie of the Week-inspired score,

135
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
to pulling its plot directly from 80s movies like E.T., Poltergeist, Firestarter, The Goonies,

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
A Nightmare on Elm Street, and Stand By Me.

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It is not a remake, by any stretch, but it contains a lot of homage.

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
There is some historical revisionism, yes.

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
According to Mike Bartlett, this is the 1980s as we want it to have been, right now.

140
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It avoids the sense of disappointment that often accompanies revisiting old favorites.

141
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
While the kids look authentic to the period, their acting is more in line with modern standards.

142
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The past, as depicted in Stranger Things, is a very 21st century kind of place.

143
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
There is, for instance, little of the casual sexism or racism prevalent in Western society

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
before 1990s political correctness kicked in.

145
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
In a lot of ways, they don't talk and act like 80s kids

146
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
because then they might come across to modern audiences as unsympathetic.

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But Stranger Things, for all its horror theming and bleak tone,

148
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
ultimately hews way closer to celebratory and nostalgic

149
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
than deconstructionist and critical of the 1980s.

150
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
According to Mike Bartlett, Stranger Things is a prime example

151
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
of how we use nostalgia to make meaning of the present,

152
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
or to simply attempt to escape its horrors.

153
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But if there's any deconstruction of 80s nostalgia in this new crop, it's it.

154
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And it is already a strange adaptational beast.

155
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
For one thing, it was itself a product of a 30-year cycle within the text,

156
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
with half of the book taking place in the 1980s with the Losers Club as adults,

157
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
and the other half in the 1950s with the Losers Club as kids.

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The way the movie handles this, smartly, by the by,

159
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
is by cutting the book into two movies,

160
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Chapter One with the kids' timeline and the as-yet-unmade Chapter Two with adults,

161
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
and having Chapter One take place in our 30-year cycle of the 1980s

162
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
rather than the original flashback date of the 1950s.

163
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The new movie did make some changes that I don't quite get.

164
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Mike in the book is more the researcher character,

165
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
but in the movie, the role of researcher is given to Ben,

166
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
presumably so Ben will be less useless and more sympathetic as a love interest,

167
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
which means that Mike's character is relegated to just, like, the black guy.

168
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I also think Pennywise kidnapping Bev at the end was kind of lame

169
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
and doesn't really make much sense.

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But it also made changes that make it more thematically streamlined,

171
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and most of the changes were positive ones.

172
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The book kind of reads like it was written on a months-long cocaine bender in a single draft,

173
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
which it probably was.

174
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The themes played up in the movie of injustice and abuse are definitely there,

175
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
but you kind of have to dig to find it.

176
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But one noteworthy change I find is the shift in what are, in the book, grisly murders to disappearances,

177
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
which is especially relevant to the 1980s because there was a national fixation

178
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
and paranoia at the time with child abduction,

179
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
especially with some high-profile cases, one of which,

180
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
the case of Jacob Wetterling, who disappeared in 1989, the year this movie is set,

181
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
was only closed this year.

182
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So one element of the 80s that the new movie includes that the book didn't

183
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
is this memory of this period of history where child abductions were at the forefront of everybody's mind.

184
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
In the book, there are plenty of sympathetic authority figures.

185
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
In the new movie, there are none.

186
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
All of the adults are part of the sickness that embody the town.

187
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
When Georgie disappears, for instance, this lady sees a pull of blood but doesn't say or do anything.

188
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The question of what Pennywise is exactly is pushed to the subtext because the metaphor is more important.

189
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Pennywise is the embodiment of racism, bigotry, abuse, even neglect.

190
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The movie does add in little nostalgic nods, like Ben being into new kids on the block.

191
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But overall, the film does not paint a very comforting picture of the 80s.

192
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Does that mean IT is deconstructionist rather than nostalgic?

193
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Well, yes and no.

194
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It falls more on the Wolf of Wall Street side of things where it kind of goes both ways.

195
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Its mere existence harkens to nostalgia, people remember the Tim Curry movie,

196
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
probably as being better than it was,

197
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
but it does not paint a reassuring, comfortable picture of the 1980s.

198
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It does not evoke, in either its storyline or its filmmaking, the fun part of the 80s.

199
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Stranger Things owes a lot to the work of Stephen King,

200
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
but if you read Stephen King's writing, which I did a lot when I was in high school

201
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
because we didn't have YA yet,

202
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
he's fascinated with the dark underbelly of the mundane,

203
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
including the way that we frame the past, which is why half of IT is set in the 50s.

204
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So when you look at the 80s Stranger Things remembers, it's the fun adventure movies part,

205
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
whereas the 80s IT remembers is stranger danger, and also NKOTB.

206
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The study of nostalgia, be it restorative, reflective, or deconstructive,

207
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
is relevant because when we as a culture bury our own sorrows by retreating into the past,

208
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
it provides a lens to now.

209
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
These two examples of IT and Stranger Things provide a palatable version of the 80s, sure,

210
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
but it's no coincidence either that they are horror and suspense.

211
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
There's always mirror elements in these nostalgia time cycles,

212
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
the 80s being a post-war, post-recession, and a conservative government,

213
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
looking back to the 50s, a post-war booming economy and a conservative government,

214
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and now us looking back on the 80s from the present day

215
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
with our post-war, post-recession, okay economy and a cons-

216
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
ugh.

217
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Maybe a part of why we feel this need to escape the dumpster fire of today into the past

218
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
is because the past is a mirror.

219
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We're deep shit.

220
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And we survived it then.

221
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Maybe we'll survive this now.

222
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Right?

223
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Thanks for watching!
