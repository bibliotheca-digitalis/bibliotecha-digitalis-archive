0	6000	The 80s are back, baby.
6000	15000	There's this idea in media criticism called the 30-year cycle.
15000	18000	When it comes to nostalgia, well really there's a lot of cycle.
18000	21000	There's a 40-year cycle, a 20-year cycle.
21000	26000	It's no coincidence that we're seeing so many sequels and reboots from movies from the mid-1990s.
26000	30000	And in the 90s, there was a lot of media that reflected nostalgia for the 60s and 70s.
35000	39000	And in the 70s and 80s, there was a particular fondness for 1950s nostalgia
39000	43000	with the likes of Happy Days, Back to the Future, American Graffiti, and Grease.
43000	47000	But I find the 30-year cycle is particularly relevant when it comes to visual mass media
47000	51000	as that's the one that reflects filmmakers, now probably parents themselves,
51000	54000	portraying their vision of their own childhood.
54000	58000	And on the consumer side, you've got this market of people who now have disposable income
58000	61000	and a lot of rose-colored glasses for their own childhoods.
61000	64000	But it's not just that this 80s revival is happening.
64000	66000	It's that it's really, really popular.
66000	70000	And not always in the fun way when we've somehow managed to elect the man
70000	73000	who was directly parodized in Back to the Future II.
73000	75000	Who would have thought that with Back to the Future II,
75000	80000	you essentially predicted the situation we're in right now with Biff and Donald Trump.
80000	86000	No, we didn't have... No, no, no, no. We never were audacious enough to think that even Biff would run for president.
86000	91000	Thor Ragnarok features an aesthetic greatly influenced by pulpy sci-fi from the 1980s,
91000	95000	from the color scheme to the editing and especially the score.
102000	104000	This was played up heavily in the marketing
104000	108000	and Thor Ragnarok is already the highest-grossing and most critically successful Thor movie.
108000	111000	But the real barn burners here are It,
111000	114000	the feature adaptation of Stephen King's 1986 novel
114000	117000	and Netflix's streaming sensation Stranger Things.
117000	121000	It defied all expectation by being an R-rated horror movie
121000	124000	that grossed approximately one sh** million dollars.
124000	127000	It is currently the number five grossing movie for the year
127000	131000	and is on a budget of $35 million and with a cast of unknown children.
131000	135000	The nostalgia pendulum still moves and this year it swung hard to the 80s.
136000	138000	Is your finger looking good?
138000	142000	Just like in the 80s when we were fondly looking back to a sanitized version of the 50s.
142000	144000	So is this just the same old nostalgia pendulum
144000	147000	or is the cycle of nostalgia ever going to evolve?
147000	149000	Grow more sophisticated than...
149000	151000	Hey, remember the thing?
153000	155000	God, you are such a nerd.
155000	158000	The study of nostalgia as it pertains to media trends
158000	160000	hit the mainstream with Marc LeSueur's essay
160000	164000	Anatomy of Nostalgia Films, Heritage and Methods in 1977.
164000	167000	And wouldn't you know, that was the year Star Wars came out,
167000	171000	itself a product of a 30-year cycle based on serials from the 1940s and 50s,
171000	174000	as well as the highest grossing film in history at the time of its release.
174000	178000	The success of Star Wars meant that the nostalgia pendulum wasn't going to go away,
178000	180000	so film academics were like,
180000	184000	hey, we should probably figure out what this means and why audiences respond to it.
184000	187000	For LeSueur, nostalgia was a concept of history,
187000	191000	one for which few have attempted to establish the general working principles.
191000	195000	LeSueur's ideas were expanded upon by Svetlana Boym in the 1990s,
195000	197000	developing two main types of nostalgia,
197000	200000	restorative nostalgia and reflective nostalgia.
200000	203000	Restorative nostalgia represents a somewhat aggressive impulse
203000	207000	motivating attempts to recapture and revitalize an imagined past.
207000	211000	To, uh, make America great again, if you will.
211000	213000	Reflective nostalgia is escapist in nature
213000	217000	and characterized by wistful longings for what has become lost to time.
217000	218000	According to LeSueur,
218000	222000	reflective nostalgia is most typically experienced for eras historically unremarkable,
222000	225000	devoid of momentous or social political events,
225000	228000	and thus characterized by simplicity and stability,
228000	231000	which is why 50s nostalgia in the 80s is so relevant.
231000	235000	The 1950s was not a stable time in world history.
235000	239000	Be like Bert when there is a flash, duck, and cover and do it fast.
239000	242000	But the day-to-day kind of felt like that for some people,
242000	244000	and nostalgia has framed it as such.
244000	247000	Simplicity and stability certainly do figure into mythic conceptions
247000	249000	of the 1950s.
249000	252000	Yeah, well, I saw it on a rerun.
252000	253000	It's a rerun.
253000	255000	And nostalgia does indeed become attached to moments
255000	257000	immediately preceding significant change,
257000	259000	which is why in America, at least,
259000	263000	nostalgia is more attached to the 1950s than to the 1960s.
263000	266000	Isn't it great there's only white people here?
266000	269000	LeSueur suggests that nostalgia attaches itself to aspects
269000	272000	of the past which have not fully exhausted themselves,
272000	276000	including practices and desires which continue to have relevance into the present.
276000	279000	But in addition to this idea of restorative and reflective nostalgia,
279000	283000	I'd like to suggest another type of nostalgia, deconstructive.
283000	284000	We can duck and cover.
284000	285000	There's a fallout shelter right there.
285000	288000	There's no way to survive this, you idiot!
288000	290000	You mean we're all going to...
290000	294000	To die, Mansley, for our country.
294000	295000	It's still nostalgic.
295000	298000	There's always something comforting about retreating into the past,
298000	302000	but it's also more critical of the past rather than affirming or reconstructive.
302000	305000	One of the best examples of a movie that is deconstructive is The Iron Giant,
305000	308000	which was made in the 1990s and takes place in the 1950s.
308000	311000	You think this metal man is fun, but who built it?
311000	313000	The Russians, the Chinese, Martians, Canadians?
313000	314000	I don't care!
314000	316000	All I know is we didn't build it,
316000	319000	and that's reason enough to assume the worst and blow out the cane of gum!
319000	321000	To borrow a term from Stranger Things,
321000	326000	deconstructionist is the upside down of reflective and restorative media.
326000	329000	And this dichotomy doesn't always have to be nostalgic.
329000	332000	It can take place in the culture as it happens.
332000	336000	It challenges our own sense of priority in the universe.
336000	340000	Well, let's look at two examples of paranormal action movies from the 1980s.
340000	342000	First, Ghostbusters.
342000	347000	A much more, erm, Reagan-y movie than a lot of people remember it.
347000	350000	I've worked in the private sector. They expect results.
350000	353000	Ghostbusters is effectively the story of four righteous entrepreneurs
353000	356000	who start a business with a service that everyone needs and appreciates,
356000	360000	but the EPA keeps trying to shut them down because regulation bad.
360000	364000	Ghostbusters carries some serious pro-capitalist, pro-business subtext.
364000	369000	So, in a lot of ways, the upside down of Ghostbusters is John Carpenter's They Live.
369000	374000	I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.
377000	379000	And I'm all out of bubblegum.
379000	384000	They Live was based on a 1963 short story inspired by Invasion of the Body Snatchers,
384000	388000	which itself was a product of anxieties over secret communists among us in the 1950s.
388000	390000	They have to be destroyed. All of them.
390000	392000	They will be. Every one of them.
392000	395000	They Live is about a man who, through the use of a pair of magic glasses,
395000	400000	realizes that the ruling class are aliens grooming humans to consume and stay in line.
400000	404000	There are those out there since the release of this movie who take stories like this to their literal extreme,
404000	409000	but most people, including Carpenter himself, see They Live as a parable of consumerism.
409000	413000	Ghostbusters is more affirming of the 1980s hyper-capitalist culture.
413000	415000	They Live is critical and deconstructionist.
415000	420000	But that isn't to say that there is necessarily a hard line between deconstructionist and nostalgic.
420000	424000	The Wolf of Wall Street is a good example of a movie that tries to have it both ways.
424000	426000	The 80s sure were debauched and immoral.
426000	427000	Look at these awful people.
427000	429000	But aren't they kind of awesome and fun?
429000	430000	Look at the consequences.
430000	432000	But don't you also kind of want to be them?
432000	436000	So, where do Stranger Things and It fall into all of this?
436000	440000	It wouldn't be a stretch to say that a huge component to the success of Stranger Things
440000	442000	is in the way it invokes 80s iconography,
442000	446000	from the Drew Struzan-inspired posters, to the Stephen King-inspired opening credits,
446000	449000	to the TV Movie of the Week-inspired score,
451000	457000	to pulling its plot directly from 80s movies like E.T., Poltergeist, Firestarter, The Goonies,
457000	459000	A Nightmare on Elm Street, and Stand By Me.
459000	463000	It is not a remake, by any stretch, but it contains a lot of homage.
463000	465000	There is some historical revisionism, yes.
465000	470000	According to Mike Bartlett, this is the 1980s as we want it to have been, right now.
470000	474000	It avoids the sense of disappointment that often accompanies revisiting old favorites.
474000	478000	While the kids look authentic to the period, their acting is more in line with modern standards.
478000	483000	The past, as depicted in Stranger Things, is a very 21st century kind of place.
483000	488000	There is, for instance, little of the casual sexism or racism prevalent in Western society
488000	490000	before 1990s political correctness kicked in.
490000	493000	In a lot of ways, they don't talk and act like 80s kids
493000	496000	because then they might come across to modern audiences as unsympathetic.
496000	499000	But Stranger Things, for all its horror theming and bleak tone,
499000	502000	ultimately hews way closer to celebratory and nostalgic
502000	505000	than deconstructionist and critical of the 1980s.
505000	508000	According to Mike Bartlett, Stranger Things is a prime example
508000	511000	of how we use nostalgia to make meaning of the present,
511000	513000	or to simply attempt to escape its horrors.
513000	518000	But if there's any deconstruction of 80s nostalgia in this new crop, it's it.
518000	521000	And it is already a strange adaptational beast.
521000	526000	For one thing, it was itself a product of a 30-year cycle within the text,
526000	530000	with half of the book taking place in the 1980s with the Losers Club as adults,
530000	533000	and the other half in the 1950s with the Losers Club as kids.
533000	536000	The way the movie handles this, smartly, by the by,
536000	538000	is by cutting the book into two movies,
538000	542000	Chapter One with the kids' timeline and the as-yet-unmade Chapter Two with adults,
542000	546000	and having Chapter One take place in our 30-year cycle of the 1980s
546000	549000	rather than the original flashback date of the 1950s.
549000	552000	The new movie did make some changes that I don't quite get.
552000	554000	Mike in the book is more the researcher character,
554000	556000	but in the movie, the role of researcher is given to Ben,
556000	560000	presumably so Ben will be less useless and more sympathetic as a love interest,
560000	565000	which means that Mike's character is relegated to just, like, the black guy.
565000	568000	I also think Pennywise kidnapping Bev at the end was kind of lame
568000	570000	and doesn't really make much sense.
570000	573000	But it also made changes that make it more thematically streamlined,
573000	575000	and most of the changes were positive ones.
575000	580000	The book kind of reads like it was written on a months-long cocaine bender in a single draft,
580000	582000	which it probably was.
582000	586000	The themes played up in the movie of injustice and abuse are definitely there,
586000	588000	but you kind of have to dig to find it.
588000	593000	But one noteworthy change I find is the shift in what are, in the book, grisly murders to disappearances,
593000	597000	which is especially relevant to the 1980s because there was a national fixation
597000	599000	and paranoia at the time with child abduction,
599000	602000	especially with some high-profile cases, one of which,
602000	607000	the case of Jacob Wetterling, who disappeared in 1989, the year this movie is set,
607000	609000	was only closed this year.
609000	613000	So one element of the 80s that the new movie includes that the book didn't
613000	618000	is this memory of this period of history where child abductions were at the forefront of everybody's mind.
618000	620000	In the book, there are plenty of sympathetic authority figures.
620000	622000	In the new movie, there are none.
622000	625000	All of the adults are part of the sickness that embody the town.
625000	631000	When Georgie disappears, for instance, this lady sees a pull of blood but doesn't say or do anything.
631000	636000	The question of what Pennywise is exactly is pushed to the subtext because the metaphor is more important.
636000	641000	Pennywise is the embodiment of racism, bigotry, abuse, even neglect.
641000	646000	The movie does add in little nostalgic nods, like Ben being into new kids on the block.
648000	653000	But overall, the film does not paint a very comforting picture of the 80s.
657000	660000	Does that mean IT is deconstructionist rather than nostalgic?
660000	662000	Well, yes and no.
662000	666000	It falls more on the Wolf of Wall Street side of things where it kind of goes both ways.
666000	670000	Its mere existence harkens to nostalgia, people remember the Tim Curry movie,
670000	672000	probably as being better than it was,
672000	675000	but it does not paint a reassuring, comfortable picture of the 1980s.
675000	680000	It does not evoke, in either its storyline or its filmmaking, the fun part of the 80s.
680000	683000	Stranger Things owes a lot to the work of Stephen King,
683000	687000	but if you read Stephen King's writing, which I did a lot when I was in high school
687000	689000	because we didn't have YA yet,
689000	692000	he's fascinated with the dark underbelly of the mundane,
692000	697000	including the way that we frame the past, which is why half of IT is set in the 50s.
697000	702000	So when you look at the 80s Stranger Things remembers, it's the fun adventure movies part,
702000	707000	whereas the 80s IT remembers is stranger danger, and also NKOTB.
708000	712000	The study of nostalgia, be it restorative, reflective, or deconstructive,
712000	716000	is relevant because when we as a culture bury our own sorrows by retreating into the past,
716000	718000	it provides a lens to now.
718000	722000	These two examples of IT and Stranger Things provide a palatable version of the 80s, sure,
722000	726000	but it's no coincidence either that they are horror and suspense.
726000	729000	There's always mirror elements in these nostalgia time cycles,
729000	733000	the 80s being a post-war, post-recession, and a conservative government,
733000	737000	looking back to the 50s, a post-war booming economy and a conservative government,
737000	740000	and now us looking back on the 80s from the present day
740000	743000	with our post-war, post-recession, okay economy and a cons-
743000	744000	ugh.
745000	749000	Maybe a part of why we feel this need to escape the dumpster fire of today into the past
749000	751000	is because the past is a mirror.
751000	752000	We're deep shit.
752000	754000	And we survived it then.
754000	756000	Maybe we'll survive this now.
757000	758000	Right?
774000	792000	Thanks for watching!
