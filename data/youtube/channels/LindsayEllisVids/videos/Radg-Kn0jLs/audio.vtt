00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
The 80s are back, baby.

00:06.000 --> 00:15.000
There's this idea in media criticism called the 30-year cycle.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
When it comes to nostalgia, well really there's a lot of cycle.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
There's a 40-year cycle, a 20-year cycle.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
It's no coincidence that we're seeing so many sequels and reboots from movies from the mid-1990s.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
And in the 90s, there was a lot of media that reflected nostalgia for the 60s and 70s.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
And in the 70s and 80s, there was a particular fondness for 1950s nostalgia

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
with the likes of Happy Days, Back to the Future, American Graffiti, and Grease.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
But I find the 30-year cycle is particularly relevant when it comes to visual mass media

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
as that's the one that reflects filmmakers, now probably parents themselves,

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
portraying their vision of their own childhood.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
And on the consumer side, you've got this market of people who now have disposable income

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
and a lot of rose-colored glasses for their own childhoods.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
But it's not just that this 80s revival is happening.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
It's that it's really, really popular.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
And not always in the fun way when we've somehow managed to elect the man

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
who was directly parodized in Back to the Future II.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Who would have thought that with Back to the Future II,

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
you essentially predicted the situation we're in right now with Biff and Donald Trump.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
No, we didn't have... No, no, no, no. We never were audacious enough to think that even Biff would run for president.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
Thor Ragnarok features an aesthetic greatly influenced by pulpy sci-fi from the 1980s,

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
from the color scheme to the editing and especially the score.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
This was played up heavily in the marketing

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
and Thor Ragnarok is already the highest-grossing and most critically successful Thor movie.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
But the real barn burners here are It,

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
the feature adaptation of Stephen King's 1986 novel

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
and Netflix's streaming sensation Stranger Things.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
It defied all expectation by being an R-rated horror movie

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
that grossed approximately one sh** million dollars.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
It is currently the number five grossing movie for the year

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
and is on a budget of $35 million and with a cast of unknown children.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
The nostalgia pendulum still moves and this year it swung hard to the 80s.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Is your finger looking good?

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
Just like in the 80s when we were fondly looking back to a sanitized version of the 50s.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
So is this just the same old nostalgia pendulum

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
or is the cycle of nostalgia ever going to evolve?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Grow more sophisticated than...

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Hey, remember the thing?

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
God, you are such a nerd.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
The study of nostalgia as it pertains to media trends

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
hit the mainstream with Marc LeSueur's essay

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Anatomy of Nostalgia Films, Heritage and Methods in 1977.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
And wouldn't you know, that was the year Star Wars came out,

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
itself a product of a 30-year cycle based on serials from the 1940s and 50s,

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
as well as the highest grossing film in history at the time of its release.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
The success of Star Wars meant that the nostalgia pendulum wasn't going to go away,

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
so film academics were like,

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
hey, we should probably figure out what this means and why audiences respond to it.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
For LeSueur, nostalgia was a concept of history,

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
one for which few have attempted to establish the general working principles.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
LeSueur's ideas were expanded upon by Svetlana Boym in the 1990s,

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
developing two main types of nostalgia,

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
restorative nostalgia and reflective nostalgia.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
Restorative nostalgia represents a somewhat aggressive impulse

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
motivating attempts to recapture and revitalize an imagined past.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
To, uh, make America great again, if you will.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Reflective nostalgia is escapist in nature

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
and characterized by wistful longings for what has become lost to time.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
According to LeSueur,

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
reflective nostalgia is most typically experienced for eras historically unremarkable,

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
devoid of momentous or social political events,

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
and thus characterized by simplicity and stability,

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
which is why 50s nostalgia in the 80s is so relevant.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
The 1950s was not a stable time in world history.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
Be like Bert when there is a flash, duck, and cover and do it fast.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
But the day-to-day kind of felt like that for some people,

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
and nostalgia has framed it as such.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Simplicity and stability certainly do figure into mythic conceptions

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
of the 1950s.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
Yeah, well, I saw it on a rerun.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
It's a rerun.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
And nostalgia does indeed become attached to moments

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
immediately preceding significant change,

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
which is why in America, at least,

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
nostalgia is more attached to the 1950s than to the 1960s.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Isn't it great there's only white people here?

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
LeSueur suggests that nostalgia attaches itself to aspects

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
of the past which have not fully exhausted themselves,

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
including practices and desires which continue to have relevance into the present.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
But in addition to this idea of restorative and reflective nostalgia,

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
I'd like to suggest another type of nostalgia, deconstructive.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
We can duck and cover.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
There's a fallout shelter right there.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
There's no way to survive this, you idiot!

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
You mean we're all going to...

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
To die, Mansley, for our country.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
It's still nostalgic.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
There's always something comforting about retreating into the past,

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
but it's also more critical of the past rather than affirming or reconstructive.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
One of the best examples of a movie that is deconstructive is The Iron Giant,

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
which was made in the 1990s and takes place in the 1950s.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
You think this metal man is fun, but who built it?

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
The Russians, the Chinese, Martians, Canadians?

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
I don't care!

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
All I know is we didn't build it,

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
and that's reason enough to assume the worst and blow out the cane of gum!

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
To borrow a term from Stranger Things,

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
deconstructionist is the upside down of reflective and restorative media.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
And this dichotomy doesn't always have to be nostalgic.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
It can take place in the culture as it happens.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
It challenges our own sense of priority in the universe.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
Well, let's look at two examples of paranormal action movies from the 1980s.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
First, Ghostbusters.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
A much more, erm, Reagan-y movie than a lot of people remember it.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
I've worked in the private sector. They expect results.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Ghostbusters is effectively the story of four righteous entrepreneurs

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
who start a business with a service that everyone needs and appreciates,

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
but the EPA keeps trying to shut them down because regulation bad.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
Ghostbusters carries some serious pro-capitalist, pro-business subtext.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
So, in a lot of ways, the upside down of Ghostbusters is John Carpenter's They Live.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
And I'm all out of bubblegum.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
They Live was based on a 1963 short story inspired by Invasion of the Body Snatchers,

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
which itself was a product of anxieties over secret communists among us in the 1950s.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
They have to be destroyed. All of them.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
They will be. Every one of them.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
They Live is about a man who, through the use of a pair of magic glasses,

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
realizes that the ruling class are aliens grooming humans to consume and stay in line.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
There are those out there since the release of this movie who take stories like this to their literal extreme,

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
but most people, including Carpenter himself, see They Live as a parable of consumerism.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
Ghostbusters is more affirming of the 1980s hyper-capitalist culture.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
They Live is critical and deconstructionist.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
But that isn't to say that there is necessarily a hard line between deconstructionist and nostalgic.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
The Wolf of Wall Street is a good example of a movie that tries to have it both ways.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
The 80s sure were debauched and immoral.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Look at these awful people.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
But aren't they kind of awesome and fun?

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Look at the consequences.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
But don't you also kind of want to be them?

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
So, where do Stranger Things and It fall into all of this?

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
It wouldn't be a stretch to say that a huge component to the success of Stranger Things

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
is in the way it invokes 80s iconography,

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
from the Drew Struzan-inspired posters, to the Stephen King-inspired opening credits,

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
to the TV Movie of the Week-inspired score,

07:31.000 --> 07:37.000
to pulling its plot directly from 80s movies like E.T., Poltergeist, Firestarter, The Goonies,

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
A Nightmare on Elm Street, and Stand By Me.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
It is not a remake, by any stretch, but it contains a lot of homage.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
There is some historical revisionism, yes.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
According to Mike Bartlett, this is the 1980s as we want it to have been, right now.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
It avoids the sense of disappointment that often accompanies revisiting old favorites.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
While the kids look authentic to the period, their acting is more in line with modern standards.

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
The past, as depicted in Stranger Things, is a very 21st century kind of place.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
There is, for instance, little of the casual sexism or racism prevalent in Western society

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
before 1990s political correctness kicked in.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
In a lot of ways, they don't talk and act like 80s kids

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
because then they might come across to modern audiences as unsympathetic.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
But Stranger Things, for all its horror theming and bleak tone,

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
ultimately hews way closer to celebratory and nostalgic

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
than deconstructionist and critical of the 1980s.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
According to Mike Bartlett, Stranger Things is a prime example

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
of how we use nostalgia to make meaning of the present,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
or to simply attempt to escape its horrors.

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
But if there's any deconstruction of 80s nostalgia in this new crop, it's it.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
And it is already a strange adaptational beast.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
For one thing, it was itself a product of a 30-year cycle within the text,

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
with half of the book taking place in the 1980s with the Losers Club as adults,

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
and the other half in the 1950s with the Losers Club as kids.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
The way the movie handles this, smartly, by the by,

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
is by cutting the book into two movies,

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
Chapter One with the kids' timeline and the as-yet-unmade Chapter Two with adults,

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
and having Chapter One take place in our 30-year cycle of the 1980s

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
rather than the original flashback date of the 1950s.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
The new movie did make some changes that I don't quite get.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Mike in the book is more the researcher character,

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
but in the movie, the role of researcher is given to Ben,

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
presumably so Ben will be less useless and more sympathetic as a love interest,

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
which means that Mike's character is relegated to just, like, the black guy.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
I also think Pennywise kidnapping Bev at the end was kind of lame

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
and doesn't really make much sense.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
But it also made changes that make it more thematically streamlined,

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
and most of the changes were positive ones.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
The book kind of reads like it was written on a months-long cocaine bender in a single draft,

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
which it probably was.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
The themes played up in the movie of injustice and abuse are definitely there,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
but you kind of have to dig to find it.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
But one noteworthy change I find is the shift in what are, in the book, grisly murders to disappearances,

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
which is especially relevant to the 1980s because there was a national fixation

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
and paranoia at the time with child abduction,

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
especially with some high-profile cases, one of which,

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
the case of Jacob Wetterling, who disappeared in 1989, the year this movie is set,

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
was only closed this year.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
So one element of the 80s that the new movie includes that the book didn't

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
is this memory of this period of history where child abductions were at the forefront of everybody's mind.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
In the book, there are plenty of sympathetic authority figures.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
In the new movie, there are none.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
All of the adults are part of the sickness that embody the town.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
When Georgie disappears, for instance, this lady sees a pull of blood but doesn't say or do anything.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
The question of what Pennywise is exactly is pushed to the subtext because the metaphor is more important.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
Pennywise is the embodiment of racism, bigotry, abuse, even neglect.

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
The movie does add in little nostalgic nods, like Ben being into new kids on the block.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
But overall, the film does not paint a very comforting picture of the 80s.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
Does that mean IT is deconstructionist rather than nostalgic?

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Well, yes and no.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
It falls more on the Wolf of Wall Street side of things where it kind of goes both ways.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
Its mere existence harkens to nostalgia, people remember the Tim Curry movie,

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
probably as being better than it was,

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
but it does not paint a reassuring, comfortable picture of the 1980s.

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
It does not evoke, in either its storyline or its filmmaking, the fun part of the 80s.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
Stranger Things owes a lot to the work of Stephen King,

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
but if you read Stephen King's writing, which I did a lot when I was in high school

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
because we didn't have YA yet,

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
he's fascinated with the dark underbelly of the mundane,

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
including the way that we frame the past, which is why half of IT is set in the 50s.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
So when you look at the 80s Stranger Things remembers, it's the fun adventure movies part,

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
whereas the 80s IT remembers is stranger danger, and also NKOTB.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
The study of nostalgia, be it restorative, reflective, or deconstructive,

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
is relevant because when we as a culture bury our own sorrows by retreating into the past,

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
it provides a lens to now.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
These two examples of IT and Stranger Things provide a palatable version of the 80s, sure,

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
but it's no coincidence either that they are horror and suspense.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
There's always mirror elements in these nostalgia time cycles,

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
the 80s being a post-war, post-recession, and a conservative government,

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
looking back to the 50s, a post-war booming economy and a conservative government,

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
and now us looking back on the 80s from the present day

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
with our post-war, post-recession, okay economy and a cons-

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
ugh.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
Maybe a part of why we feel this need to escape the dumpster fire of today into the past

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
is because the past is a mirror.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
We're deep shit.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
And we survived it then.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Maybe we'll survive this now.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Right?

12:54.000 --> 13:12.000
Thanks for watching!
