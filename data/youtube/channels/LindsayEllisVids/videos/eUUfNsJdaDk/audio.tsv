0	11000	Hey guys! The family's all back together again! How have you been? Where have you been?
11000	18000	Drinking beer. Babies. Babies. It's a hike to bring a baby all this way up to this part of the story.
18000	21000	Two miles away. 20 blocks away that you need.
21000	35000	This week we're reviewing a book called Glory O'Brien's History of the Future in which a major plot point is dissolving a petrified bat into beer and drinking it.
35000	42000	So we were going to drink shitty beer in honor of the book because they're teenagers and they obviously probably only have access to shitty beer.
42000	50000	But then we'd have to drink shitty beer. These two came up or found a recipe online that involves Bacardi.
50000	59000	Which has a bat. Very topical. So it has a bat. So we put the bat in the beer and now we're going to see the future.
59000	65000	Sounds crazy but it's a major plot point. Yeah, that's how they get to see the future. They dissolve a petrified bat.
65000	72000	And it was one of the most interesting ways to start a novel. Like opening lines. It all started with that day we drank the bat.
72000	81000	You're just like, well. Because they always tell you get a good hook in the first line and that's really hard but I was like, well I'm hooked.
81000	83000	I'm drinking. Drink the bat.
83000	91000	I was pretty horrified at the suggestion of putting rum in beer because I also got the wrong kind of beer. But this isn't that bad.
91000	95000	This is great. The strawberry's really nice. And the mint. You don't have mint in yours?
95000	102000	No, I have mint. I made them all with mint. Oh, okay. I was in charge of the beer making. I can't taste the mint at all.
102000	105000	And I just said fucking and made them all with mint.
105000	116000	So, Gloria O'Brien's History of the Future is a young adult book. This is an advanced reader copy but it's been out for a while now so that tells you how long we've had this thing.
116000	125000	Gloria O'Brien is a recent high school graduate who is dealing with the fact that her mother committed suicide when she was very young.
125000	132000	And she's just now kind of starting to deal with it and then she and her best friend drink a bat and start getting visions of the future.
132000	142000	And through these visions of the future she deals with her teen girl issues of depression and my mother committed suicide and sort of comes of age and conquers her demons.
142000	149000	The thing she sees of the future is a feminist dystopia. Anti-feminist dystopia.
149000	163000	Well, I guess the future plays in a lot less than you think it would because the future she sees is sort of handmade tale-ish like women being oppressed type future.
163000	168000	Lisa, you read it first. What did you think of Gloria O'Brien's History of the Future?
168000	177000	Well, I read it eight months ago and so when you guys finally got around to reading it because I've been telling you you should read it for so long because I loved it so much.
177000	182000	It was one of my favorite books of last year. I actually forgot about the feminist dystopia.
182000	190000	I just remembered the part about this young girl coming of age and conquering her demons and that part really stuck with me.
190000	199000	The dealing with her mother's suicide, her fear of becoming her mother and then getting past that and the way it was written, the voice of the character was just so resonating.
199000	208000	The dystopia that she sees of the Second Civil War, it plays very little into the actual narrative.
208000	214000	I think it was what she needed to see though for her to sort of grow up.
215000	223000	It was the future she needed and I don't necessarily believe a lot of people who have read this book, according to what I've seen online, don't like the future.
223000	228000	They think it's really unbelievable like this future could never happen in America. How could you write this future?
228000	239000	Funny story. I was explaining to my boyfriend about and then you know this anti-feminist and I explained like how it comes to fruition in the book and he got kind of early angry.
239000	242000	He's like, that would never happen! What the hell?
242000	248000	I think that's besides the point. It's the future she needed to see for her journey and that's what worked for her.
248000	257000	I'm kind of on team that. I honestly like because I you know it's like once I got to specifically it's it's fairly early on in the book.
257000	261000	It's like third of the way through when she describes the Fair Pay Act.
261000	271000	This being sort of like a an impetus and basically the basic thrust is that like however many years into the future there's going to pass legislation that women have to be paid equal for equal work.
271000	281000	And the solution that some states find to get around this, which I assume was kind of sort of based off the Affordable Care Act, is that they just don't pay women at all.
281000	287000	Like women aren't allowed to work and you know my brain kind of made that that noise like you know that Mac noise that went that way.
287000	301000	And like I like the whole book it was like and then every every time it would go to the history of the future portions my brains are going you know because I'm just like it's too close and too detailed.
301000	310000	And so like the reasons the dystopia happened I'm like well you know that that that women being outlawed from working doesn't make any sense that would ruin the economy.
310000	314000	But that's exactly what happens the world falls apart because that happens.
314000	320000	Yeah but they wouldn't they wouldn't I do not buy that states would pass legislation outlawing women from working.
320000	322000	That's why I think it's more of a fantasy kind of thing.
322000	324000	That's not what I got at the end.
324000	336000	Here's my take on it you know how in the beginning of the book they drink the bat to see the future and that's like and you're like how the hell does drinking a petrified bat help you see the okay fine I'm just gonna write it off.
336000	340000	Like that's our deuce ex batabas like fine.
340000	358000	It's the same thing with the future like I really do feel like with the bat with the future there I mean it's like the is there like a term for like a macguffin but it's like a it's like a plot point where it's just like random thing that'll just make you explore yourself and question yourself.
358000	360000	Unless you should be anything.
360000	363000	But it's about her finding her place in having a future.
363000	369000	I think the fact that was something so random kind of speaks to that trope that maybe the author was just saying and it could be anything so I'm just making it.
369000	370000	Make it a bat.
370000	371000	Make it a bat.
371000	376000	And the thing she sees could be anything so I'll make it as ridiculous as possible maybe.
377000	395000	Well at the end of the book she like because she sees her friend do a thing that she saw and this kind of confirms to her that the vision she was getting like she was like dead convinced like yes this is absolutely going to happen and I don't know how my story is going to end exactly but I know what role I'm going to play in this horrible horrible future.
395000	403000	And so it's like I think we are meant it doesn't really end on a note of ambiguity which I think works to its detriment.
403000	415000	I think her seeing the vision of her friend leaving at the end and then that actually happened was supposed to make you be like wait could it be real when you were ready to dismiss entirely but not necessarily confirm it.
415000	417000	Because maybe that was coincidence.
417000	420000	The protagonist she believes it.
420000	421000	All right fine.
421000	431000	But also it makes I mean the book never addresses or even flirts with the idea of all right you know what's going to happen what are you going to do to try to stop it if it's this terrible.
432000	433000	There's sort of this acceptance.
433000	434000	It's like the future.
434000	436000	Well it's going to happen and I know it my role in it.
438000	454000	Which again it's not about what the future holds it's about her coming to terms with herself her own family's history of depression like how much like her mother she is and or the future she can have that she does have a future.
454000	455000	That's the biggest thing.
455000	463000	And her seeing that strong role that she plays in it even if it's not her preventing it from happening is what gives her the strength to take control of her own life.
463000	471000	You know the things that she does to solve her father's problems with what's going on with the neighbors and you know take back what's theirs.
471000	478000	Because she sees this active role in her future she begins to actually create an active role for herself in her own life.
478000	480000	They've been living in limbo for 14 years.
481000	490000	Another thing about this is like since the dystopia takes up so little of the actual word count it's not very plot driven.
490000	499000	I mean it's a very fast read but it wasn't it didn't feel that terribly YA in terms of just the motion of it.
499000	501000	Like literary fiction style.
501000	508000	It was almost like a character piece yeah because it was a lot of like it was a lot more profanity than I think I've seen in any YA book.
508000	510000	Like they drop f-bomb like once a page.
510000	517000	But I feel like this is kind of transcends what's going on with current marketing YA where you know they're putting everything into boxes.
517000	522000	This could have been written outside of that trend and still have been this more literary piece.
522000	527000	Well I think it does kind of then beg the question because it does read more like literary fiction.
527000	537000	It's short like YA and it reads quickly like YA but it also like just in a stylistic way and in an actual content way it reads more like literary fiction than commercial fiction.
537000	541000	So then it does kind of beg the question then like what defines YA?
541000	544000	Little Brown the people who brush a twilight.
545000	554000	Because it really does straddle the line between like contemporary like it reads way more like contemporary fiction than genre fiction.
554000	565000	I keep bringing it back but it made me think again of Octavia Butler you know the Parable of the Sower where you have vague good shit.
566000	567000	So good.
567000	568000	Vague.
568000	570000	Vague.
570000	575000	Because it's just like you know it's like the Parable of the Sower they just kind of hand wave it like a bunch of crap happened.
575000	583000	Like where it's the environment and the economy you know and then you have the states stepping or states like breaking up.
583000	587000	You have America breaking up. You have Alaska declaring itself independent.
587000	592000	The things that lead up to the fact that you know you have no one you can depend on.
592000	593000	The government can't be dependent on.
593000	602000	You have this like anti-woman super religious like right wing thing rise up and make life hellacious for the main characters.
602000	605000	It becomes much more believable.
605000	606000	In here it's not believable.
606000	607000	It seems too fast.
607000	610000	It seems but that's again it's kind of not the point.
610000	618000	It's just the deuce ex machina story thing that is just there to make the character realize she has a purpose.
618000	620000	Like and it's for her journey.
620000	626000	Like it could I think the future could have been anything as long as she had a role in it.
626000	628000	Yeah she sees that she has a role.
628000	632000	She was afraid she was going to commit suicide like her mother but she sees herself grow old.
632000	638000	But I guess I have to say as a fan of genre fiction like I think the comparison to Parable of the Sower is pretty apt.
638000	647000	Because it's like I kept thinking about like Handmaid's Tale which also is kind of super vague on a how we got to this point level.
647000	651000	And I guess that it's just a personal is like for you you're just like okay you know I didn't bother you.
651000	654000	And also you know I have that distance from reading it eight months ago.
654000	656000	I totally forgot about the distance.
656000	658000	Because it doesn't matter.
658000	661000	What stuck with me was the voice of the writing.
661000	664000	The prose you know it was written in this teenagery voice.
665000	673000	So many YA books try to make this like quirky teenage voice and it's so overdone or trying too hard and it's obnoxious.
673000	675000	Or you know the quirky teenager.
675000	682000	But this she just was awkward and it felt natural and it felt just masterfully crafted.
682000	683000	I definitely agree.
683000	688000	I think the voice felt very natural but also while being really tight beautiful prose.
688000	690000	I felt that the prose was really good.
690000	696000	I mean you read the back of the novel like the blurb on the back and you think okay then she becomes Katniss.
696000	700000	So it's all gonna be about like her fight to make this future not happen.
700000	701000	No.
701000	702000	Nope.
702000	703000	Not that at all.
703000	706000	Which I think was a good call because it does feel that refreshing.
706000	709000	Well that's what makes it feel refreshing because it's not about that.
709000	710000	It's not about stopping the future.
710000	711000	It's not about changing it.
711000	715000	It's about this is what it's gonna be but I have a future.
715000	717000	It's terrible but it's a future.
717000	719000	I have a purpose.
720000	728000	That was another thing that made it really weird was because it was so it was obviously written sort of from the point of view of a depressed person because it was so detached.
728000	734000	But at the same basically the whole book is about breaking up with your best friend.
734000	741000	And the main relationship of the book is her and her best friend and she spends the whole time just being like I can't stand this bitch.
741000	743000	And that I don't know that did kind of wear me down.
743000	749000	It was just like she just kind of spends a whole time being so down on her friend and I'm like the friend who is also in a very shitty situation.
749000	750000	Yeah.
750000	756000	It's like one of those things where I feel like then you're gonna become an adult and you're gonna realize like you were a shitty friend to her too.
756000	757000	Yeah.
757000	758000	I like that though.
758000	759000	I felt like it was realistic.
759000	760000	It was.
760000	761000	I've been in that relationship.
761000	762000	I was that kid.
762000	768000	I was a depressed person with the awful friendship and then I grew up and sort of realized and I feel like she's on that path to grow too.
769000	773000	It's realistic and I feel like she does get there by the end that she's you know that's her arc.
773000	777000	I mean I would definitely recommend it.
777000	779000	I recommended it to my mom in her book group.
779000	781000	I was like I think you guys need to read this.
781000	789000	I think it I like how it handled the main character's depression and her inner thoughts but also how she kept them to herself.
789000	795000	And their friendship that was kind of just because you're the person across the street and I've known you my whole life.
796000	808000	And I think we I think most people have that childhood friend where you look back on it and sometimes you know those friendships can last but sometimes it's just like I was literally friends with you just because you lived across the street.
808000	810000	And it was easy.
810000	812000	We were all before each other but that's what it was.
812000	819000	No it's like I remember when I graduated high school I had all these friends and it's just like the second we graduated it was just like bye.
819000	820000	Yeah.
820000	822000	I think we've all had that.
823000	825000	I also think it was a really interesting way to use genre.
825000	830000	Like in something that was really more of a contemporary feeling book.
830000	835000	Just using the genre in a way that was different than the very classic sci-fi fantasy YA novel.
835000	837000	And I would recommend it.
837000	839000	No I'd recommend it.
839000	840000	I did recommend it.
840000	841000	Yeah.
841000	844000	You semi-precipitated this.
844000	849000	So we've almost come to our end of our bat beer.
850000	851000	I can't really see the future.
851000	853000	Vision just came over me.
853000	856000	I think I know which one we're going to read next time.
856000	858000	Oh you're right.
858000	860000	Oh my god.
860000	862000	I'm seeing it too.
862000	863000	Alright.
863000	864000	No wait.
864000	866000	We're tabulating your votes.
866000	868000	I'm seeing a lightning bolt.
868000	871000	And someone living in New Jersey.
871000	874000	Is this the future?
874000	876000	It's the future.
876000	877000	It's the future.
877000	879000	Okay so this will be the next one we talk about.
879000	883000	And I guess we're going to go ahead and catch up because 12 just came out.
883000	885000	So we're going to go ahead and catch up to 12.
885000	886000	Primarily it's going to be volume 1 whatever.
