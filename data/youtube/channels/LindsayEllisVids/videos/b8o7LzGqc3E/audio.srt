1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
There were a lot of event movies to talk about that have come out in 2018 that echoed trends

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,960
that have shaped our cinematic past.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,840
But there was one movie this year that is truly the embodiment of the modern epoch.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,980
One movie that some have described as the most ambitious crossover of all time.

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,820
One movie that built so skillfully on the cinematic universe that came before it.

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,440
One movie that is the defining moment of our era.

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,920
I'm talking, of course, about Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,120
Mamma Mia! Here I go again!

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,160
Oh boy, the Great American Musical is back!

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,880
But, eh, I mean, on the one hand, high-time cultural milestone voice of a generation for

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,200
Wine Mom's Mamma Mia! got a sequel.

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,080
You know, so, being a grudge holder makes you fat?

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,480
But here's the thing, fam.

14
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,800
On top of movie pass going bankrupt, it's a streaming world now.

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,600
I don't like going outside.

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,720
And I really don't like giving my undivided attention to things.

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,520
And this newfound medium of streaming is reducing interest in the cinema.

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,880
I need a gimmick to get my ass out of the house and drive the whole 1.2 miles down to

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,400
the Rolling Hills AMC so I can see the latest release in 4K 3D.

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,320
If we have enough gimmicks, then surely interest in the cinema will revive.

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,320
Or will it?

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,640
So, obviously, the Hollywood panic of trying to incentivize people to stop watching goddamn

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,560
Stranger Things on Netflix for the fifth time, and to come on out to the movies by

24
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,680
pushing the prestige of gimmicks like 3D, 4D, and even 6D, applies more to big-budget

25
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,680
tentpoles like superhero movies, superhero movies, live-action remakes of Disney classics,

26
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,760
and even superhero movies, more than it does the Hollywood musical.

27
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,080
But that hasn't always been the case.

28
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,480
A long time ago, way back, back in those halcyon days before Valerian and the City of a Thousand

29
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,120
Planets, I had a segment in my video about Joel Schumacher's Phantom of the Opera alluding

30
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,320
to the crash and ultimately the final dumpster fire resting place of the big Hollywood movie

31
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,120
musical, namely Hello Dolly.

32
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,920
But the fall of the great American musical was, of course, much more complicated than

33
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,920
just one movie not making its money back.

34
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,080
And that is what we're going to talk about today.

35
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,200
Because in many regards, the dramatic and expensive death throes of the big Hollywood

36
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,760
musical in the 1960s had more in common with our current-day endless glut of sequels, remakes,

37
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,240
and superhero movies than it does with Mamma Mia, Here We Go Again.

38
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,760
There was a time when musicals were the biggest game in town.

39
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,680
It was a world dominated by Rodgers and Hammerstein, by Julie Andrews, by Gene Kelly.

40
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,200
For decades, the saccharine Broadway-style musical was the event movie.

41
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:46,320
These were the tentpoles of the mid-20th century, until one day, it all came crashing down.

42
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,680
With the advent of talkies, it wasn't long before musicals found their way onto the big

43
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
screen.

44
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,920
First through musical shorts featuring popular performers, and eventually full-length features.

45
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,360
Ever since the advent of sound, musicals were a consistently popular staple.

46
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,340
But in 1939, MGM Studios hired producer Arthur Fried, whose production unit went on to create

47
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,680
what would eventually become the golden era of movie musicals, with titles like Easter

48
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,760
Parade, On the Town, Singing in the Rain, and An American in Paris.

49
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,160
And in the 1950s and early 1960s, the way musicals built hype around their big important

50
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,420
movies was the roadshow.

51
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,040
So what is a roadshow, and how does it fit in here?

52
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,060
Well, it's a gimmick.

53
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,920
But a gimmick that was, particularly through the 1950s to the 1970s, used to promote more

54
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,160
prestige-oriented films.

55
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:37,240
You got your historical epics, your gut-wrenching war dramas, and of course, the larger-than-life

56
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,240
musical.

57
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:46,560
You're The Day the Earth Stood Still's and fluffy beach-blanket bingos couldn't

58
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,760
ne'er dream of having a roadshow release, but your Ben Hur's, your Dr. Zhivago's,

59
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,240
and your West Side Story's made for prime fodder.

60
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,080
Basically, before the film goes into wide release, a studio would take it on the road

61
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:04,480
for a limited, premium release.

62
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,880
Ticket prices were at a premium compared to your average film screening, but the marketing

63
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,120
appealed to a more luxuriant experience.

64
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,320
To quote Mike Todd, the leading purveyor of roadshows in the 1950s,

65
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,720
"'To show audiences gut class and appreciate the arts, they'd be insulted if you didn't

66
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,660
charge premium prices and make it a little hard to see.

67
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,280
This way they don't have to rub elbows with the gum-chewers.'"

68
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,000
Roadshow movies were usually longer than your average release, did not include any shorts

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,400
or trailers in front of them, and almost always had an intermission.

70
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,840
You can see this last element parodied in later movies, like Monty Python and the Holy

71
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,840
Grail.

72
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,360
Roadshow movies were presented with pre-recorded overtures, on-tracks, and exit music to mimic

73
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:51,120
an actual night at the theater.

74
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,520
They almost always included a number of souvenirs and accoutrements for audience members to

75
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,000
take home with them, including programs, pins, and all sorts of licensed merchandise.

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,640
So if you're wondering who the f*** would ever buy a $12 Infinity War Popcorn Bucket,

77
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,620
well, there is a precedent for that sort of thing.

78
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,360
And to be clear, roadshows were not only for movie musicals.

79
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,680
Gone with the Wind saw massive success with the roadshow marketing campaign, just that

80
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,880
the format of the musical lent itself well to the roadshow, making them the most common

81
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,520
and often the most popular.

82
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,160
In effect, to buy a ticket to a roadshow movie was to build prestige around the movie, to

83
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,040
make it feel more like an evening night or a Broadway show than just celluloid print.

84
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,520
And if this sounds like a really expensive ploy to get butts into seats, it's because

85
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,520
it is.

86
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,880
Which is why most of these films had a roadshow in a limited release, and ended up getting

87
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,920
a theatrical-cut wide release to most mainstream movie theaters.

88
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,200
But a successful roadshow garnered not only premium ticket sales and more rentals from

89
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,960
regular theaters, but also great word of mouth for a wide release, making them best-case

90
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,760
scenario a risky but profitable marketing method.

91
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,480
So this marketing strategy works well for big-budget movies for decades, and all seems

92
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,640
well and good.

93
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,320
But as movie studios were throwing this promotion at everything and anything being made, as

94
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,520
well as hitting almost toddler levels of managing film budgets themselves, comes the 1950s,

95
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,360
and there's a new game in town.

96
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,400
When you can get this wonderful new 17-inch Westinghouse set at a modest price.

97
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,260
But here's the thing, fam.

98
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,100
On top of the communists ruining everything, it's a television world now.

99
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,380
I have TV dinners to make, and going to the movies makes it really hard to milk any sweet

100
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,740
drops of affection from my loveless marriage.

101
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,660
I don't want to haul ass all the way out of the house and drive 12 miles to Los Angeles

102
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,740
to the Carthay Circle Theater.

103
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,780
Why would I pay more to see a movie that's going to get a wide release in a few weeks

104
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,500
anyway when I can watch Bonanza on the television from the comfort of my own home?

105
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,540
Some recognize the increased dependency on huge roadshows as a dangerous game.

106
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:56,060
According to Films and Filming in 1963, should these gigantic investments achieve the desired

107
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,740
outcome, Hollywood may well have found the definitive and triumphant answer to the threat

108
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,860
of television.

109
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:05,020
Should they encounter defeat, the whole face of the film industry may be drastically changed.

110
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,100
Will the public pay the higher prices made necessary by these colossal expenditures?

111
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,460
Is there an audience sufficiently large to permit these pictures to emerge without a

112
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,460
loss?

113
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,900
Will these fabulously expensive films can and will filmgoers absorb?

114
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,660
Around this same time, a string of expensive movie bombs nearly sink entire movie studios.

115
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,820
The most infamous from this era being 20th Century Fox's Cleopatra, a bomb of such

116
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,700
gigantic proportions that it nearly tipped the studio into complete bankruptcy.

117
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,580
Throw in the nascent cultural changes of the early mid-60s, and studios were starting to

118
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,840
realize that the whole concept of the roadshow just wasn't worth the investment anymore,

119
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,980
an aging relic that signaled it was time to let go and move on.

120
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,900
And then, something unexpected happened.

121
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:58,100
Winds in the east, mist coming in, like something is brewing, about to begin, can't put me

122
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:12,380
finger on what lies in store, I feel what's to happen, all happened before.

123
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,980
The Hollywood movie musical looks like it might be on its deathbed, and who should come

124
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,300
along to revive it but Walt Disney and Mary Poppins.

125
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,180
The film launches Julie Andrews' film career, ironically after her getting snubbed from

126
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,820
being cast in the role she originated on Broadway with My Fair Lady, and it won a ton of Academy

127
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,300
Awards, including Best Actress for Andrews.

128
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,620
Mary Poppins cost a relatively low $5.2 million to make, and it returned that amount at the

129
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,420
box office quickly, and though it did not run as a roadshow feature in the United States,

130
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,140
it did in London to great success.

131
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,020
Moreover, the film was doing equivalent business to a roadshow release, and Poppins was what

132
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,460
really convinced Disney that he should enter the roadshow musical business.

133
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:56,900
We'll get to that.

134
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,520
Then there was Warner Bros.' My Fair Lady, the most expensive at the time production

135
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,860
for the A-Link Studio, which was about to be up for sale at the time.

136
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:11,740
They cast Audrey Hepburn as Eliza Doolittle, a big star with a weaker voice to replace

137
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,700
the Broadway originator of the role, Julie Andrews, and not only does the roadshow gambit

138
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:25,660
pay off with a huge hit, it nets 8 Academy Awards.

139
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:37,460
But then, oh boy, here comes the big guns.

140
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:43,100
The Sound of Music is a big 1950s-style musical smack in the middle of the 1960s, and it does

141
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,780
record box office numbers for a roadshow feature.

142
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,780
The Sound of Music effectively single-handedly reversed the box office disaster 20th Century

143
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,460
Fox had with Cleopatra, so when it looked like the big musical juggernaut was finally

144
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:58,180
dying as the event movie trend in Hollywood, three big box office musical smashes happened

145
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,760
one right after the other.

146
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,980
Along with a wave of prestige that seemed to back up the phenomena, My Fair Lady, Poppins,

147
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:09,320
and Music were nominated for a combined 35 Oscars and garnered a total of 18 wins.

148
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,800
And studios lose their shit.

149
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,820
So what do they do in the face of these massive successes?

150
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,460
You gotta chase that trend.

151
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,260
But the earlier prevailing wisdom was that roadshows and big bawdy 1950s-style Hollywood

152
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,220
musicals were on their way out, and that was not wrong.

153
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,340
They were very much on their way out.

154
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,620
But studios were going to ignore this.

155
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:35,700
To their own downfall.

156
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,860
According to film historian Matthew Kennedy, in the seven years that followed The Sound

157
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,180
of Music, it became de rigueur for any film musical to be released in the roadshow format

158
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,800
if they wanted to be rightfully labeled major, important, or lavish.

159
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,360
The first canary in this coal mine actually came from the Disney company with The Happiest

160
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,000
Millionaire, a roadshow release completed after Walt's death that bombed so spectacularly

161
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
you've never heard of it.

162
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,760
But this wasn't a huge investment, and it didn't tank the studio.

163
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,840
Other studios did much, much worse.

164
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,800
Warner Bros. wants to recapture the success of My Fair Lady with another popular Broadway

165
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,960
musical vehicle, Lerner and Lowe's Camelot, a romantic love triangle story based on T.H.

166
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,800
White's The Once and Future King and a personal favorite of the Kennedy family.

167
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,960
It was, by all accounts, the production from hell.

168
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:27,280
Super expensive attention to detail of historical accuracy inflates the budget and causes delays.

169
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,740
It featured the cast mostly from hell, namely its star, Richard Harris, who was drunk to

170
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,080
a point of liability on set and constantly in giant fights with the producers, its third

171
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,000
party star as Lancelot, Italian actor Francis Nero, barely speaks English, and the production

172
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,620
is plagued by delays.

173
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,760
Most of its tremendously costly shoot in England is unusable, and all of this is going down

174
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,000
while Warner Bros. is being sold, and the studios basically like, fuck it, whatever,

175
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
just get it done.

176
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,600
Ultimately, the film ends up costing $15 million, making it the second most expensive Warner

177
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,560
Bros. production after My Fair Lady.

178
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,380
And in the midst of all this, roadshow prices are flipped up from $2 to $6.

179
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,440
And as we all know, raising prices for the exact same product for no reason to see the

180
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,760
exact same thing is a great way to get butts into seats.

181
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,400
Critical response to Camelot is dire.

182
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,240
Whereas The Sound of Music got ripped hard for its sentimentality, but not much else,

183
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,240
Camelot is almost universally panned, not just for its dated sense of traditionalism

184
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,920
and sentimentality, but for a lot of technical reasons.

185
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,240
Also, in contrast with musicals like The Sound of Music, no one gave a fuck about Camelot

186
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,000
the Musical before the film version, it having closed on Broadway in 1963 after a modest

187
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,280
three-year run.

188
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,280
It didn't have the fervent fanbase of other Broadway shows, nor did it have any artistically

189
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,740
inspired moments a la Mary Poppins.

190
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:44,080
And by 1967, movies like this are starting to feel like a relic.

191
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,000
Isn't that Malcolm there?

192
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,880
By this point, movies like Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, Bonnie and Clyde, and Help

193
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,680
are revolutionizing cinema.

194
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,540
But these movies are new, unpredictable, and studios wanted to continue sinking their money

195
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,080
into what up until this point had been considered safe.

196
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,080
It's incredible.

197
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
It's impossible.

198
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,080
But it's true.

199
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,480
A man can talk to the animal.

200
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,940
Hey, people liked Rex Harrison and My Fair Lady, and people loved Mary Poppins.

201
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,100
Why not create an original musical based on an English children's book series that's

202
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,500
also a vehicle for Harrison?

203
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,580
At the time, Dr. Dolittle seemed like a good idea, given that a more child-friendly musical

204
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:24,100
with a large cast of animals would reach a larger audience and also be ripe for the picking

205
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,420
when it came to toyetic tie-ins.

206
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,020
But we have a problem.

207
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:31,060
Rex Harrison is a giant pain in the ass who, like Richard Harris, is tremendously difficult

208
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,060
to work with.

209
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,080
So Harrison leaves the film, and Christopher Plummer is brought on.

210
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,100
But then, hey-o, Rex Harrison wants back in, and the studio is still contractually obligated

211
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,180
to pay Plummer his agreed-upon salary.

212
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:46,220
There was also the constant recasting of Bumpo, the prince of a fictional African kingdom.

213
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,220
Yikes.

214
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,420
Bumpo was originally supposed to be played by Sammy Davis Jr., whom Harrison refused

215
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,420
to work with.

216
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,420
Said Harrison,

217
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,740
I don't want to work with an entertainer.

218
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,740
I want an actor.

219
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,740
A real actor.

220
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,820
Not a song and dance man.

221
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:01,580
But eventually the part was finally reduced, given to relatively unknown character actor

222
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:06,460
Jeffrey Holder, who had his name changed to…

223
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,180
William Shakespeare the Tenth.

224
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,620
God, this just keeps getting weirder.

225
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,020
Oh, and animals.

226
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,020
Oh, animals.

227
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,980
Two million dollars of the budget were allotted to the animal-related costs, quarantine fees,

228
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:25,300
which included a lot of giraffe-related mishaps, between one dying on set, trying to get Rex

229
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:30,140
Harrison to ride on one, and a three-day production delay that happened when, according to Doolittle

230
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,540
Choreographer, the giraffe stepped on his own cock.

231
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,500
The film ended up costing $18 million, triple the original budget.

232
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,420
And the final result is… a mess.

233
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,020
The roadshow for Doolittle became more of a focus group.

234
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,500
They were editing it as they were taking it on the road, trying to trim it based on audience

235
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,380
reactions, which was tepid to negative throughout.

236
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,580
All this to say nothing of the exorbitant amount of merchandising that accompanied the

237
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,580
movie.

238
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:59,820
With over 300 official pieces of Dr. Doolittle swag, from bikinis to pudding mix, worth $200

239
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,780
million, little of which sold.

240
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,980
To quote a Fox promotion staffer years later,

241
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,060
That f***ing Dr. Doolittle killed off merchandising tie-ins.

242
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,060
Ha ha ha.

243
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,060
Ha ha.

244
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,060
For now.

245
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:14,140
In the end, box office and critical response murdered Dr. Doolittle, with the movie only

246
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,500
grossing $9 million of its $18 million budget, and it being derided as a boring movie laced

247
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,580
with a white man's burden narrative and cartoonishly racist stereotypes of Africa.

248
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,740
Its legacy is perhaps summed up best by producer Robert Zanuck.

249
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,740
You look back now and ask, how could you have been so stupid?

250
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,540
Dr. Doolittle was conceived in a period of euphoria.

251
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,140
We were riding a musical wave that we didn't realize was going to come crashing down on

252
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,140
the beach all at once.

253
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,380
Sure, there were probably signs and warnings out there, but you were already so committed

254
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,200
financially and emotionally that it's very hard to pull the plug on these big undertakings.

255
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,580
Other films like Finian's Rainbow, Paint Your Wagon, and Man of La Mancha also underperformed

256
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,020
during this weird glut period.

257
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,660
But none landed with such an expensive thud as...

258
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,740
Well, hello.

259
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,740
Look who's here.

260
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,740
Dolly.

261
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,740
This is Louis.

262
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,740
Hello, Louis.

263
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,740
Dolly.

264
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,460
On paper, Hello, Dolly! seemed like a natural for film adaptation.

265
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,460
A light-hearted romantic comedy that swept the Tony Awards in 1964 with a then-record

266
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,740
Breaking 10 wins.

267
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,300
The casting of Barbra Streisand was bolstered by the success of Funny Girl a year before

268
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,300
the film's release.

269
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:20,380
Don't tell me not to live, just sit and putter Life's candy and the sun's a ball of butter

270
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,980
Cementing Streisand as America's darling.

271
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,220
But even then, the studio was ignoring how miscast Streisand was.

272
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,900
Dolly Levi is supposed to be, like, middle-aged, she's in her 50s, and at the time, Barbra

273
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:38,740
Streisand was 25.

274
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:48,700
The casting choice also snubbed Broadway role-originator Carol Channing for a younger, hotter actress

275
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:53,380
in the title role, resulting in a Channing-Streisand feud that was arguably more interesting than

276
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,620
the movie itself.

277
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,500
But there were already concerns about the relevance of the film, which was about the

278
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,660
romantic, sunny exploits of turn-of-the-century white New Yorkers from as high up as its own

279
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,020
director Gene Kelly.

280
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,020
To quote Kelly,

281
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,180
It's not the kind of film I would make as a first choice, but what else is there?

282
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,940
What happens now is that studios buy stage shows after they are already dated and then

283
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,500
spends a lot of money turning them into dated movies.

284
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,960
The musical is the victim of changing times.

285
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:21,260
So even director Gene Kelly kind of knew that this was kind of a bad idea, but they went

286
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,740
ahead and made it anyway.

287
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,900
Initially, Dolly was given a budget of $10 million, with $1 million alone going to Barbra

288
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,900
Streisand.

289
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,900
Of course, this too fell into budget hell.

290
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,100
Adding to that was a clause in the contract that Fox had struck with Broadway producer

291
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,940
David Merrick, that is, that the film version of Dolly could not be released within five

292
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,860
years of the original contract signing.

293
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:51,100
By 1969, with the Broadway production still in healthy financial shape, Dolly had been

294
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,540
sitting on the already cash-broke Fox's shelf for long enough.

295
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,340
In the end, Fox broke their contract and promised Zanuck an additional $2 million, along with

296
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:03,140
the promise to reimburse the Broadway production if its weekly box office fell below $60,000.

297
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:07,460
And while Dolly seemed poised to do well, if not sound of music numbers at the box office,

298
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,340
it did not have repeat viewers, audience admiration, or critical clout to keep up the momentum

299
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,260
or even turn a profit for Fox.

300
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,340
According to Matthew Kennedy, when Dolly finished production, 17 of the 25 top film rentals

301
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,340
were road shows.

302
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,580
In response, the industry prepared a bottleneck of reserved seat giants.

303
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:26,220
A record-breaking 12 were scheduled for release over the last four months of 1968.

304
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,660
Marketers faced a huge dilemma in catching people's attention amid the glut and convincing

305
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,100
them that the road show experience was still worth the time, cost, and effort.

306
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,180
With a road show opening practically every week, how do you market something as being

307
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,380
special when it isn't special anymore?

308
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:43,080
Said film critic Pauline Kael in the wake of the 1969 musical Paint Your Wagon, giant

309
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,540
musicals have finally broken the back of the American film industry.

310
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:50,860
There is almost no way, short of a miracle, that Paint Your Wagon can recover its costs,

311
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,780
although there are several other movies of this kind waiting to be released or to be

312
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,540
completed, and at least one of them is even more expensive.

313
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,740
It is highly unlikely that any new ones will be scheduled for production in the years to

314
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,300
come, or perhaps, ever.

315
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,100
There were outliers to this trend, like Fiddler on the Roof and Cabaret.

316
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:14,100
Fiddler was given the road show treatment, but carefully, and it sported no budget-breaking

317
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,900
stars, names, or elaborate sets.

318
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,060
Cabaret was not a road show, and very much falls into a more experimental, counter-cultural

319
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,060
rubric that has little in common with films like Dolly.

320
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:27,260
According to Matthew Kennedy, Fosse made a musical for people who hated musicals.

321
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:31,500
This wasn't the death of the musical, but it was the death of a certain type of musical.

322
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,160
But at the same time, it still speaks to this continued Hollywood truism, Hollywood digging

323
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:42,580
into certain ideas on what it considers safe long after these truisms are no longer true.

324
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,940
Add Pauline Kael in her review of Hello, Dolly!

325
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,660
At just the time for great new movie musicals, the moguls who can't see further than the

326
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,020
end of their cigars tell us that the form is dead.

327
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,960
Daryl F. Zanuck says you can't make little musicals, and the rest of the industry seems

328
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,960
to concur.

329
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,020
I think they're dead wrong.

330
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,540
I love musicals, but I hate big, expensive musicals because I have to wade through all

331
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:04,300
the filler of production values to get what I want to see, and I suspect there are millions

332
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,100
of people who feel the same way.

333
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,540
We have seen time and time again the film industry having to fight not only to keep

334
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:13,780
itself alive, but to keep it the most culturally relevant thing.

335
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,460
How do you compete with media that doesn't require you to go anywhere?

336
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:22,580
When you can get this wonderful new 17-inch Westinghouse set at a modest price.

337
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,820
The fall of the Hollywood musical created the landscape that would lead to the era of

338
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,820
the blockbuster.

339
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,060
Jaws, Star Wars, Indiana Jones.

340
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:34,020
We'd have gimmicks like 3D in the 1980s, which mercifully died until it came back.

341
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,220
And it's back.

342
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,460
I love it.

343
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,980
There was also the expansion of 70mm, which played well with films like Lawrence of Arabia,

344
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,900
and eventually IMAX.

345
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,060
And LIMAX.

346
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:47,780
The film industry upped its game with special effects that television, up until really,

347
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,540
really recently, could never hope to compete with.

348
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,940
And of course there was that goddamn 48fps bullshit with The Hobbit.

349
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,340
And of course now we not only have 3D, we have 4D.

350
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:02,020
But the rise and fall of the roadshow, Hollywood's focus on what they perceive as safe bets,

351
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:06,260
as well as their desire for trends to never change so that they can predict them, speaks

352
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:10,380
not only to the gimmicks Hollywood tries to keep on life support, but also to actual

353
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,140
trends as well.

354
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:16,220
But what is interesting to me is not so much the roadshow itself, but the insistence of

355
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,300
throwing money into genres and gimmicks that audiences are showing increased antipathy

356
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,300
for.

357
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,940
Just look at the recent trailers for Titans and Venom, films that the studios made to

358
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:29,060
respond to trends that died years ago, and the trailers to which were met with uproarious

359
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,740
laughter and yet someone edited in lines like

360
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,740
and whatever this is.

361
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:49,140
And high-fived each other in the editing bay and went, yeah, badass.

362
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:53,980
How do you do, fellow kids?

363
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,980
Just as we didn't get from

364
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,780
Why so serious?

365
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,780
to

366
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,300
Like a turd in the wind

367
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,580
overnight, there was a time and a place for the movie musical before they turned into

368
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,860
self-parody.

369
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:11,700
The ironic thing now is that Mamma Mia, Here We Go Again is this rare healthy being of

370
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,980
a movie that actually isn't riding a dying trend, and is responding to what a certain

371
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,740
audience wants to see.

372
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:23,040
There are a lot of wine moms out there, and they're all bankrupting moviepass.

373
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,960
With the merger of Disney and Fox, and the monopolization of an industry that was already

374
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:33,120
incredibly insular, we are creeping back to that 1960s level of fewer movies being released

375
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,520
and yet bigger and bigger budgets.

376
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,360
And have we hit a point where between domestic and international markets, these movies are

377
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,640
too big to fail and bring down the entire industry like it was in the 1960s?

378
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,860
Probably not.

379
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:51,000
Studios have gotten much better about at least not losing money the way they did in the 1960s,

380
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,680
but with more and more money being funneled into fewer and fewer projects, the current

381
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:00,160
state is beginning to resemble the studio system of the late 1960s, just ever so slightly

382
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,120
more monopolistic.

383
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,440
And again, one has to wonder where the studios are responding to a demand, or if they're

384
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,640
trying to force a trend on life support when in the real world, audiences were over it

385
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,640
a long time ago.

386
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,720
Then we will eat your face right off your head, like a turd in the wind.

387
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,880
I've seen trends you people wouldn't believe.

388
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,280
48 frames per second bouncing off the shoulder of a storm giant.

389
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:32,360
I've seen and smelled 4D versions of Josh Brolin's CGI Thanos face that looks like forgotten bacon.

390
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:38,600
All these moments will be lost in time, like turds in the wind.

391
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,200
Time to die.

392
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:47,840
Who are we shilling for today?

393
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,840
It's Skillshare.

394
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,040
Okay, so this episode was brought to you in part by Skillshare.

395
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:58,400
Skillshare is an online learning community with over 20,000 classes in design, business,

396
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
technology, and more.

397
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,120
So one of the most common questions I get is just about the ins and outs of how one

398
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:09,760
creates a video essay, and turns out they actually already have a class on that at Skillshare.

399
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,720
It's done by fellow YouTuber, Wendover Productions, and he's already created a class about how

400
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,760
he creates video essays, so if you want a tutorial, it's already there.

401
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,080
As for me, I'll actually be creating a class for Skillshare later in the fall.

402
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,200
It's going to be more about research.

403
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,000
As you can see, this episode was very research-heavy.

404
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,320
How does one go about organizing their research?

405
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,080
Well, we'll get to that.

406
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,760
Premium membership gives you unlimited access to high-quality classes on must-know topics.

407
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,520
The host must mention specific classes, categories, oh, I already did that.
