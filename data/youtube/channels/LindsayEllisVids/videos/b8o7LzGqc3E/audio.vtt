00:00.000 --> 00:06.640
There were a lot of event movies to talk about that have come out in 2018 that echoed trends

00:06.640 --> 00:08.960
that have shaped our cinematic past.

00:08.960 --> 00:13.840
But there was one movie this year that is truly the embodiment of the modern epoch.

00:13.840 --> 00:18.980
One movie that some have described as the most ambitious crossover of all time.

00:18.980 --> 00:23.820
One movie that built so skillfully on the cinematic universe that came before it.

00:23.820 --> 00:27.440
One movie that is the defining moment of our era.

00:27.440 --> 00:30.920
I'm talking, of course, about Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.

00:30.920 --> 00:34.120
Mamma Mia! Here I go again!

00:34.120 --> 00:37.160
Oh boy, the Great American Musical is back!

00:37.160 --> 00:42.880
But, eh, I mean, on the one hand, high-time cultural milestone voice of a generation for

00:42.880 --> 00:45.200
Wine Mom's Mamma Mia! got a sequel.

00:45.200 --> 00:48.080
You know, so, being a grudge holder makes you fat?

00:48.080 --> 00:49.480
But here's the thing, fam.

00:49.480 --> 00:52.800
On top of movie pass going bankrupt, it's a streaming world now.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.600
I don't like going outside.

00:54.600 --> 00:57.720
And I really don't like giving my undivided attention to things.

00:57.720 --> 01:01.520
And this newfound medium of streaming is reducing interest in the cinema.

01:01.520 --> 01:05.880
I need a gimmick to get my ass out of the house and drive the whole 1.2 miles down to

01:05.880 --> 01:10.400
the Rolling Hills AMC so I can see the latest release in 4K 3D.

01:10.400 --> 01:15.320
If we have enough gimmicks, then surely interest in the cinema will revive.

01:15.320 --> 01:16.320
Or will it?

01:16.320 --> 01:20.640
So, obviously, the Hollywood panic of trying to incentivize people to stop watching goddamn

01:20.640 --> 01:24.560
Stranger Things on Netflix for the fifth time, and to come on out to the movies by

01:24.560 --> 01:29.680
pushing the prestige of gimmicks like 3D, 4D, and even 6D, applies more to big-budget

01:29.680 --> 01:35.680
tentpoles like superhero movies, superhero movies, live-action remakes of Disney classics,

01:35.680 --> 01:40.760
and even superhero movies, more than it does the Hollywood musical.

01:40.760 --> 01:45.080
But that hasn't always been the case.

01:45.080 --> 01:50.480
A long time ago, way back, back in those halcyon days before Valerian and the City of a Thousand

01:50.480 --> 01:55.120
Planets, I had a segment in my video about Joel Schumacher's Phantom of the Opera alluding

01:55.120 --> 01:59.320
to the crash and ultimately the final dumpster fire resting place of the big Hollywood movie

01:59.320 --> 02:02.120
musical, namely Hello Dolly.

02:02.120 --> 02:05.920
But the fall of the great American musical was, of course, much more complicated than

02:05.920 --> 02:08.920
just one movie not making its money back.

02:08.920 --> 02:11.080
And that is what we're going to talk about today.

02:11.080 --> 02:14.200
Because in many regards, the dramatic and expensive death throes of the big Hollywood

02:14.200 --> 02:18.760
musical in the 1960s had more in common with our current-day endless glut of sequels, remakes,

02:18.760 --> 02:23.240
and superhero movies than it does with Mamma Mia, Here We Go Again.

02:23.240 --> 02:25.760
There was a time when musicals were the biggest game in town.

02:25.760 --> 02:30.680
It was a world dominated by Rodgers and Hammerstein, by Julie Andrews, by Gene Kelly.

02:30.680 --> 02:35.200
For decades, the saccharine Broadway-style musical was the event movie.

02:35.200 --> 02:46.320
These were the tentpoles of the mid-20th century, until one day, it all came crashing down.

02:46.320 --> 02:49.680
With the advent of talkies, it wasn't long before musicals found their way onto the big

02:49.680 --> 02:50.680
screen.

02:50.680 --> 02:54.920
First through musical shorts featuring popular performers, and eventually full-length features.

02:54.920 --> 02:58.360
Ever since the advent of sound, musicals were a consistently popular staple.

02:58.360 --> 03:03.340
But in 1939, MGM Studios hired producer Arthur Fried, whose production unit went on to create

03:03.340 --> 03:07.680
what would eventually become the golden era of movie musicals, with titles like Easter

03:07.680 --> 03:11.760
Parade, On the Town, Singing in the Rain, and An American in Paris.

03:12.240 --> 03:16.160
And in the 1950s and early 1960s, the way musicals built hype around their big important

03:16.160 --> 03:18.420
movies was the roadshow.

03:18.420 --> 03:22.040
So what is a roadshow, and how does it fit in here?

03:22.040 --> 03:24.060
Well, it's a gimmick.

03:24.060 --> 03:28.920
But a gimmick that was, particularly through the 1950s to the 1970s, used to promote more

03:28.920 --> 03:31.160
prestige-oriented films.

03:31.160 --> 03:37.240
You got your historical epics, your gut-wrenching war dramas, and of course, the larger-than-life

03:37.240 --> 03:38.240
musical.

03:38.240 --> 03:46.560
You're The Day the Earth Stood Still's and fluffy beach-blanket bingos couldn't

03:46.560 --> 03:50.760
ne'er dream of having a roadshow release, but your Ben Hur's, your Dr. Zhivago's,

03:50.760 --> 03:53.240
and your West Side Story's made for prime fodder.

03:53.240 --> 03:57.080
Basically, before the film goes into wide release, a studio would take it on the road

03:57.080 --> 04:04.480
for a limited, premium release.

04:04.480 --> 04:07.880
Ticket prices were at a premium compared to your average film screening, but the marketing

04:07.880 --> 04:10.120
appealed to a more luxuriant experience.

04:10.120 --> 04:13.320
To quote Mike Todd, the leading purveyor of roadshows in the 1950s,

04:13.320 --> 04:17.720
"'To show audiences gut class and appreciate the arts, they'd be insulted if you didn't

04:17.720 --> 04:20.660
charge premium prices and make it a little hard to see.

04:20.660 --> 04:23.280
This way they don't have to rub elbows with the gum-chewers.'"

04:23.280 --> 04:27.000
Roadshow movies were usually longer than your average release, did not include any shorts

04:27.000 --> 04:30.400
or trailers in front of them, and almost always had an intermission.

04:30.400 --> 04:33.840
You can see this last element parodied in later movies, like Monty Python and the Holy

04:33.840 --> 04:39.840
Grail.

04:39.840 --> 04:44.360
Roadshow movies were presented with pre-recorded overtures, on-tracks, and exit music to mimic

04:44.360 --> 04:51.120
an actual night at the theater.

04:51.120 --> 04:54.520
They almost always included a number of souvenirs and accoutrements for audience members to

04:54.520 --> 04:59.000
take home with them, including programs, pins, and all sorts of licensed merchandise.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.640
So if you're wondering who the f*** would ever buy a $12 Infinity War Popcorn Bucket,

05:03.640 --> 05:06.620
well, there is a precedent for that sort of thing.

05:06.620 --> 05:10.360
And to be clear, roadshows were not only for movie musicals.

05:10.360 --> 05:14.680
Gone with the Wind saw massive success with the roadshow marketing campaign, just that

05:14.680 --> 05:18.880
the format of the musical lent itself well to the roadshow, making them the most common

05:18.880 --> 05:20.520
and often the most popular.

05:20.520 --> 05:24.160
In effect, to buy a ticket to a roadshow movie was to build prestige around the movie, to

05:24.160 --> 05:30.040
make it feel more like an evening night or a Broadway show than just celluloid print.

05:30.040 --> 05:35.520
And if this sounds like a really expensive ploy to get butts into seats, it's because

05:35.520 --> 05:36.520
it is.

05:36.520 --> 05:39.880
Which is why most of these films had a roadshow in a limited release, and ended up getting

05:39.880 --> 05:43.920
a theatrical-cut wide release to most mainstream movie theaters.

05:43.920 --> 05:49.200
But a successful roadshow garnered not only premium ticket sales and more rentals from

05:49.200 --> 05:53.960
regular theaters, but also great word of mouth for a wide release, making them best-case

05:53.960 --> 05:57.760
scenario a risky but profitable marketing method.

05:57.760 --> 06:01.480
So this marketing strategy works well for big-budget movies for decades, and all seems

06:01.480 --> 06:02.640
well and good.

06:02.640 --> 06:06.320
But as movie studios were throwing this promotion at everything and anything being made, as

06:06.320 --> 06:11.520
well as hitting almost toddler levels of managing film budgets themselves, comes the 1950s,

06:11.520 --> 06:13.360
and there's a new game in town.

06:13.360 --> 06:18.400
When you can get this wonderful new 17-inch Westinghouse set at a modest price.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.260
But here's the thing, fam.

06:20.260 --> 06:24.100
On top of the communists ruining everything, it's a television world now.

06:24.100 --> 06:28.380
I have TV dinners to make, and going to the movies makes it really hard to milk any sweet

06:28.380 --> 06:30.740
drops of affection from my loveless marriage.

06:30.740 --> 06:35.660
I don't want to haul ass all the way out of the house and drive 12 miles to Los Angeles

06:35.660 --> 06:38.740
to the Carthay Circle Theater.

06:38.740 --> 06:42.780
Why would I pay more to see a movie that's going to get a wide release in a few weeks

06:42.780 --> 06:47.500
anyway when I can watch Bonanza on the television from the comfort of my own home?

06:47.500 --> 06:51.540
Some recognize the increased dependency on huge roadshows as a dangerous game.

06:51.540 --> 06:56.060
According to Films and Filming in 1963, should these gigantic investments achieve the desired

06:56.060 --> 06:59.740
outcome, Hollywood may well have found the definitive and triumphant answer to the threat

06:59.740 --> 07:00.860
of television.

07:00.860 --> 07:05.020
Should they encounter defeat, the whole face of the film industry may be drastically changed.

07:05.020 --> 07:09.100
Will the public pay the higher prices made necessary by these colossal expenditures?

07:09.100 --> 07:12.460
Is there an audience sufficiently large to permit these pictures to emerge without a

07:12.460 --> 07:13.460
loss?

07:13.460 --> 07:17.900
Will these fabulously expensive films can and will filmgoers absorb?

07:17.900 --> 07:22.660
Around this same time, a string of expensive movie bombs nearly sink entire movie studios.

07:22.660 --> 07:26.820
The most infamous from this era being 20th Century Fox's Cleopatra, a bomb of such

07:26.820 --> 07:30.700
gigantic proportions that it nearly tipped the studio into complete bankruptcy.

07:30.700 --> 07:34.580
Throw in the nascent cultural changes of the early mid-60s, and studios were starting to

07:34.580 --> 07:38.840
realize that the whole concept of the roadshow just wasn't worth the investment anymore,

07:38.840 --> 07:42.980
an aging relic that signaled it was time to let go and move on.

07:42.980 --> 07:47.900
And then, something unexpected happened.

07:47.900 --> 07:58.100
Winds in the east, mist coming in, like something is brewing, about to begin, can't put me

07:58.100 --> 08:12.380
finger on what lies in store, I feel what's to happen, all happened before.

08:12.380 --> 08:15.980
The Hollywood movie musical looks like it might be on its deathbed, and who should come

08:15.980 --> 08:19.300
along to revive it but Walt Disney and Mary Poppins.

08:19.300 --> 08:23.180
The film launches Julie Andrews' film career, ironically after her getting snubbed from

08:23.180 --> 08:27.820
being cast in the role she originated on Broadway with My Fair Lady, and it won a ton of Academy

08:27.820 --> 08:30.300
Awards, including Best Actress for Andrews.

08:30.300 --> 08:34.620
Mary Poppins cost a relatively low $5.2 million to make, and it returned that amount at the

08:34.620 --> 08:38.420
box office quickly, and though it did not run as a roadshow feature in the United States,

08:38.420 --> 08:40.140
it did in London to great success.

08:40.140 --> 08:44.020
Moreover, the film was doing equivalent business to a roadshow release, and Poppins was what

08:44.020 --> 08:48.460
really convinced Disney that he should enter the roadshow musical business.

08:48.460 --> 08:56.900
We'll get to that.

08:56.900 --> 09:00.520
Then there was Warner Bros.' My Fair Lady, the most expensive at the time production

09:00.520 --> 09:03.860
for the A-Link Studio, which was about to be up for sale at the time.

09:03.860 --> 09:11.740
They cast Audrey Hepburn as Eliza Doolittle, a big star with a weaker voice to replace

09:11.740 --> 09:15.700
the Broadway originator of the role, Julie Andrews, and not only does the roadshow gambit

09:15.700 --> 09:25.660
pay off with a huge hit, it nets 8 Academy Awards.

09:25.660 --> 09:37.460
But then, oh boy, here comes the big guns.

09:37.460 --> 09:43.100
The Sound of Music is a big 1950s-style musical smack in the middle of the 1960s, and it does

09:43.100 --> 09:45.780
record box office numbers for a roadshow feature.

09:45.780 --> 09:49.780
The Sound of Music effectively single-handedly reversed the box office disaster 20th Century

09:49.780 --> 09:53.460
Fox had with Cleopatra, so when it looked like the big musical juggernaut was finally

09:53.460 --> 09:58.180
dying as the event movie trend in Hollywood, three big box office musical smashes happened

09:58.180 --> 09:59.760
one right after the other.

09:59.760 --> 10:03.980
Along with a wave of prestige that seemed to back up the phenomena, My Fair Lady, Poppins,

10:03.980 --> 10:09.320
and Music were nominated for a combined 35 Oscars and garnered a total of 18 wins.

10:09.320 --> 10:11.800
And studios lose their shit.

10:11.800 --> 10:14.820
So what do they do in the face of these massive successes?

10:14.820 --> 10:16.460
You gotta chase that trend.

10:16.460 --> 10:21.260
But the earlier prevailing wisdom was that roadshows and big bawdy 1950s-style Hollywood

10:21.260 --> 10:24.220
musicals were on their way out, and that was not wrong.

10:24.220 --> 10:26.340
They were very much on their way out.

10:26.340 --> 10:28.620
But studios were going to ignore this.

10:28.620 --> 10:35.700
To their own downfall.

10:35.700 --> 10:38.860
According to film historian Matthew Kennedy, in the seven years that followed The Sound

10:38.860 --> 10:43.180
of Music, it became de rigueur for any film musical to be released in the roadshow format

10:43.180 --> 10:46.800
if they wanted to be rightfully labeled major, important, or lavish.

10:46.800 --> 10:50.360
The first canary in this coal mine actually came from the Disney company with The Happiest

10:50.360 --> 10:55.000
Millionaire, a roadshow release completed after Walt's death that bombed so spectacularly

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
you've never heard of it.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.760
But this wasn't a huge investment, and it didn't tank the studio.

10:59.760 --> 11:05.840
Other studios did much, much worse.

11:05.840 --> 11:09.800
Warner Bros. wants to recapture the success of My Fair Lady with another popular Broadway

11:09.800 --> 11:14.960
musical vehicle, Lerner and Lowe's Camelot, a romantic love triangle story based on T.H.

11:14.960 --> 11:18.800
White's The Once and Future King and a personal favorite of the Kennedy family.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.960
It was, by all accounts, the production from hell.

11:21.960 --> 11:27.280
Super expensive attention to detail of historical accuracy inflates the budget and causes delays.

11:27.280 --> 11:31.740
It featured the cast mostly from hell, namely its star, Richard Harris, who was drunk to

11:31.740 --> 11:36.080
a point of liability on set and constantly in giant fights with the producers, its third

11:36.080 --> 11:41.000
party star as Lancelot, Italian actor Francis Nero, barely speaks English, and the production

11:41.000 --> 11:42.620
is plagued by delays.

11:42.620 --> 11:46.760
Most of its tremendously costly shoot in England is unusable, and all of this is going down

11:46.760 --> 11:51.000
while Warner Bros. is being sold, and the studios basically like, fuck it, whatever,

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
just get it done.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.600
Ultimately, the film ends up costing $15 million, making it the second most expensive Warner

11:55.600 --> 11:57.560
Bros. production after My Fair Lady.

11:57.560 --> 12:02.380
And in the midst of all this, roadshow prices are flipped up from $2 to $6.

12:02.380 --> 12:06.440
And as we all know, raising prices for the exact same product for no reason to see the

12:06.440 --> 12:09.760
exact same thing is a great way to get butts into seats.

12:09.760 --> 12:12.400
Critical response to Camelot is dire.

12:12.400 --> 12:16.240
Whereas The Sound of Music got ripped hard for its sentimentality, but not much else,

12:16.240 --> 12:20.240
Camelot is almost universally panned, not just for its dated sense of traditionalism

12:20.240 --> 12:22.920
and sentimentality, but for a lot of technical reasons.

12:22.920 --> 12:27.240
Also, in contrast with musicals like The Sound of Music, no one gave a fuck about Camelot

12:27.240 --> 12:32.000
the Musical before the film version, it having closed on Broadway in 1963 after a modest

12:32.000 --> 12:33.280
three-year run.

12:33.280 --> 12:37.280
It didn't have the fervent fanbase of other Broadway shows, nor did it have any artistically

12:37.280 --> 12:39.740
inspired moments a la Mary Poppins.

12:39.740 --> 12:44.080
And by 1967, movies like this are starting to feel like a relic.

12:44.800 --> 12:47.000
Isn't that Malcolm there?

12:47.000 --> 12:50.880
By this point, movies like Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, Bonnie and Clyde, and Help

12:50.880 --> 12:52.680
are revolutionizing cinema.

12:52.680 --> 12:56.540
But these movies are new, unpredictable, and studios wanted to continue sinking their money

12:56.540 --> 13:00.080
into what up until this point had been considered safe.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.080
It's incredible.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.080
It's impossible.

13:03.080 --> 13:04.080
But it's true.

13:04.080 --> 13:07.480
A man can talk to the animal.

13:07.480 --> 13:11.940
Hey, people liked Rex Harrison and My Fair Lady, and people loved Mary Poppins.

13:11.940 --> 13:15.100
Why not create an original musical based on an English children's book series that's

13:15.100 --> 13:16.500
also a vehicle for Harrison?

13:16.500 --> 13:20.580
At the time, Dr. Dolittle seemed like a good idea, given that a more child-friendly musical

13:20.580 --> 13:24.100
with a large cast of animals would reach a larger audience and also be ripe for the picking

13:24.100 --> 13:25.420
when it came to toyetic tie-ins.

13:25.420 --> 13:27.020
But we have a problem.

13:27.020 --> 13:31.060
Rex Harrison is a giant pain in the ass who, like Richard Harris, is tremendously difficult

13:31.060 --> 13:32.060
to work with.

13:32.060 --> 13:35.080
So Harrison leaves the film, and Christopher Plummer is brought on.

13:35.080 --> 13:39.100
But then, hey-o, Rex Harrison wants back in, and the studio is still contractually obligated

13:39.100 --> 13:41.180
to pay Plummer his agreed-upon salary.

13:41.180 --> 13:46.220
There was also the constant recasting of Bumpo, the prince of a fictional African kingdom.

13:46.220 --> 13:47.220
Yikes.

13:47.220 --> 13:51.420
Bumpo was originally supposed to be played by Sammy Davis Jr., whom Harrison refused

13:51.420 --> 13:52.420
to work with.

13:52.420 --> 13:53.420
Said Harrison,

13:53.420 --> 13:54.740
I don't want to work with an entertainer.

13:54.740 --> 13:55.740
I want an actor.

13:55.740 --> 13:56.740
A real actor.

13:56.740 --> 13:57.820
Not a song and dance man.

13:57.820 --> 14:01.580
But eventually the part was finally reduced, given to relatively unknown character actor

14:01.580 --> 14:06.460
Jeffrey Holder, who had his name changed to…

14:06.460 --> 14:08.180
William Shakespeare the Tenth.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.620
God, this just keeps getting weirder.

14:10.700 --> 14:12.020
Oh, and animals.

14:12.020 --> 14:13.020
Oh, animals.

14:16.060 --> 14:19.980
Two million dollars of the budget were allotted to the animal-related costs, quarantine fees,

14:19.980 --> 14:25.300
which included a lot of giraffe-related mishaps, between one dying on set, trying to get Rex

14:25.300 --> 14:30.140
Harrison to ride on one, and a three-day production delay that happened when, according to Doolittle

14:30.140 --> 14:33.540
Choreographer, the giraffe stepped on his own cock.

14:33.540 --> 14:37.500
The film ended up costing $18 million, triple the original budget.

14:37.540 --> 14:41.420
And the final result is… a mess.

14:41.420 --> 14:44.020
The roadshow for Doolittle became more of a focus group.

14:44.020 --> 14:47.500
They were editing it as they were taking it on the road, trying to trim it based on audience

14:47.500 --> 14:50.380
reactions, which was tepid to negative throughout.

14:50.380 --> 14:53.580
All this to say nothing of the exorbitant amount of merchandising that accompanied the

14:53.580 --> 14:54.580
movie.

14:54.580 --> 14:59.820
With over 300 official pieces of Dr. Doolittle swag, from bikinis to pudding mix, worth $200

14:59.820 --> 15:01.780
million, little of which sold.

15:01.780 --> 15:03.980
To quote a Fox promotion staffer years later,

15:04.020 --> 15:07.060
That f***ing Dr. Doolittle killed off merchandising tie-ins.

15:07.060 --> 15:08.060
Ha ha ha.

15:08.060 --> 15:09.060
Ha ha.

15:09.060 --> 15:10.060
For now.

15:10.060 --> 15:14.140
In the end, box office and critical response murdered Dr. Doolittle, with the movie only

15:14.140 --> 15:18.500
grossing $9 million of its $18 million budget, and it being derided as a boring movie laced

15:18.500 --> 15:22.580
with a white man's burden narrative and cartoonishly racist stereotypes of Africa.

15:22.580 --> 15:25.740
Its legacy is perhaps summed up best by producer Robert Zanuck.

15:25.740 --> 15:28.740
You look back now and ask, how could you have been so stupid?

15:28.740 --> 15:31.540
Dr. Doolittle was conceived in a period of euphoria.

15:31.540 --> 15:35.140
We were riding a musical wave that we didn't realize was going to come crashing down on

15:35.140 --> 15:36.140
the beach all at once.

15:36.140 --> 15:39.380
Sure, there were probably signs and warnings out there, but you were already so committed

15:39.380 --> 15:43.200
financially and emotionally that it's very hard to pull the plug on these big undertakings.

15:43.200 --> 15:47.580
Other films like Finian's Rainbow, Paint Your Wagon, and Man of La Mancha also underperformed

15:47.580 --> 15:50.020
during this weird glut period.

15:50.020 --> 15:53.660
But none landed with such an expensive thud as...

15:53.660 --> 15:55.740
Well, hello.

15:55.740 --> 15:56.740
Look who's here.

15:56.740 --> 15:57.740
Dolly.

15:57.740 --> 15:58.740
This is Louis.

15:58.740 --> 15:59.740
Hello, Louis.

15:59.740 --> 16:00.740
Dolly.

16:01.380 --> 16:04.460
On paper, Hello, Dolly! seemed like a natural for film adaptation.

16:04.460 --> 16:08.460
A light-hearted romantic comedy that swept the Tony Awards in 1964 with a then-record

16:08.460 --> 16:09.740
Breaking 10 wins.

16:09.740 --> 16:13.300
The casting of Barbra Streisand was bolstered by the success of Funny Girl a year before

16:13.300 --> 16:14.300
the film's release.

16:14.300 --> 16:20.380
Don't tell me not to live, just sit and putter Life's candy and the sun's a ball of butter

16:20.380 --> 16:22.980
Cementing Streisand as America's darling.

16:22.980 --> 16:27.220
But even then, the studio was ignoring how miscast Streisand was.

16:27.220 --> 16:31.900
Dolly Levi is supposed to be, like, middle-aged, she's in her 50s, and at the time, Barbra

16:31.900 --> 16:38.740
Streisand was 25.

16:38.740 --> 16:48.700
The casting choice also snubbed Broadway role-originator Carol Channing for a younger, hotter actress

16:48.700 --> 16:53.380
in the title role, resulting in a Channing-Streisand feud that was arguably more interesting than

16:53.380 --> 16:54.620
the movie itself.

16:54.620 --> 16:57.500
But there were already concerns about the relevance of the film, which was about the

16:57.500 --> 17:01.660
romantic, sunny exploits of turn-of-the-century white New Yorkers from as high up as its own

17:01.660 --> 17:03.020
director Gene Kelly.

17:03.020 --> 17:04.020
To quote Kelly,

17:04.020 --> 17:07.180
It's not the kind of film I would make as a first choice, but what else is there?

17:07.180 --> 17:10.940
What happens now is that studios buy stage shows after they are already dated and then

17:10.940 --> 17:13.500
spends a lot of money turning them into dated movies.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.960
The musical is the victim of changing times.

17:15.960 --> 17:21.260
So even director Gene Kelly kind of knew that this was kind of a bad idea, but they went

17:21.260 --> 17:22.740
ahead and made it anyway.

17:22.860 --> 17:26.900
Initially, Dolly was given a budget of $10 million, with $1 million alone going to Barbra

17:26.900 --> 17:27.900
Streisand.

17:27.900 --> 17:29.900
Of course, this too fell into budget hell.

17:29.900 --> 17:33.100
Adding to that was a clause in the contract that Fox had struck with Broadway producer

17:33.100 --> 17:36.940
David Merrick, that is, that the film version of Dolly could not be released within five

17:36.940 --> 17:38.860
years of the original contract signing.

17:38.860 --> 17:51.100
By 1969, with the Broadway production still in healthy financial shape, Dolly had been

17:51.100 --> 17:54.540
sitting on the already cash-broke Fox's shelf for long enough.

17:54.540 --> 17:58.340
In the end, Fox broke their contract and promised Zanuck an additional $2 million, along with

17:58.340 --> 18:03.140
the promise to reimburse the Broadway production if its weekly box office fell below $60,000.

18:03.140 --> 18:07.460
And while Dolly seemed poised to do well, if not sound of music numbers at the box office,

18:07.460 --> 18:11.340
it did not have repeat viewers, audience admiration, or critical clout to keep up the momentum

18:11.340 --> 18:13.260
or even turn a profit for Fox.

18:13.260 --> 18:17.340
According to Matthew Kennedy, when Dolly finished production, 17 of the 25 top film rentals

18:17.340 --> 18:18.340
were road shows.

18:18.340 --> 18:21.580
In response, the industry prepared a bottleneck of reserved seat giants.

18:21.580 --> 18:26.220
A record-breaking 12 were scheduled for release over the last four months of 1968.

18:26.220 --> 18:29.660
Marketers faced a huge dilemma in catching people's attention amid the glut and convincing

18:29.660 --> 18:33.100
them that the road show experience was still worth the time, cost, and effort.

18:33.100 --> 18:36.180
With a road show opening practically every week, how do you market something as being

18:36.180 --> 18:38.380
special when it isn't special anymore?

18:38.380 --> 18:43.080
Said film critic Pauline Kael in the wake of the 1969 musical Paint Your Wagon, giant

18:43.080 --> 18:46.540
musicals have finally broken the back of the American film industry.

18:46.540 --> 18:50.860
There is almost no way, short of a miracle, that Paint Your Wagon can recover its costs,

18:50.860 --> 18:53.780
although there are several other movies of this kind waiting to be released or to be

18:53.780 --> 18:56.540
completed, and at least one of them is even more expensive.

18:56.540 --> 18:59.740
It is highly unlikely that any new ones will be scheduled for production in the years to

18:59.740 --> 19:01.300
come, or perhaps, ever.

19:06.540 --> 19:10.100
There were outliers to this trend, like Fiddler on the Roof and Cabaret.

19:10.100 --> 19:14.100
Fiddler was given the road show treatment, but carefully, and it sported no budget-breaking

19:14.100 --> 19:15.900
stars, names, or elaborate sets.

19:15.900 --> 19:20.060
Cabaret was not a road show, and very much falls into a more experimental, counter-cultural

19:20.060 --> 19:23.060
rubric that has little in common with films like Dolly.

19:23.060 --> 19:27.260
According to Matthew Kennedy, Fosse made a musical for people who hated musicals.

19:27.260 --> 19:31.500
This wasn't the death of the musical, but it was the death of a certain type of musical.

19:31.500 --> 19:36.160
But at the same time, it still speaks to this continued Hollywood truism, Hollywood digging

19:36.160 --> 19:42.580
into certain ideas on what it considers safe long after these truisms are no longer true.

19:42.580 --> 19:44.940
Add Pauline Kael in her review of Hello, Dolly!

19:44.940 --> 19:48.660
At just the time for great new movie musicals, the moguls who can't see further than the

19:48.660 --> 19:51.020
end of their cigars tell us that the form is dead.

19:51.020 --> 19:54.960
Daryl F. Zanuck says you can't make little musicals, and the rest of the industry seems

19:54.960 --> 19:55.960
to concur.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.020
I think they're dead wrong.

19:57.020 --> 20:00.540
I love musicals, but I hate big, expensive musicals because I have to wade through all

20:00.540 --> 20:04.300
the filler of production values to get what I want to see, and I suspect there are millions

20:04.300 --> 20:06.100
of people who feel the same way.

20:06.100 --> 20:09.540
We have seen time and time again the film industry having to fight not only to keep

20:09.540 --> 20:13.780
itself alive, but to keep it the most culturally relevant thing.

20:13.780 --> 20:17.460
How do you compete with media that doesn't require you to go anywhere?

20:17.460 --> 20:22.580
When you can get this wonderful new 17-inch Westinghouse set at a modest price.

20:22.580 --> 20:25.820
The fall of the Hollywood musical created the landscape that would lead to the era of

20:25.820 --> 20:26.820
the blockbuster.

20:26.820 --> 20:29.060
Jaws, Star Wars, Indiana Jones.

20:29.060 --> 20:34.020
We'd have gimmicks like 3D in the 1980s, which mercifully died until it came back.

20:34.020 --> 20:35.220
And it's back.

20:35.220 --> 20:36.460
I love it.

20:36.460 --> 20:40.980
There was also the expansion of 70mm, which played well with films like Lawrence of Arabia,

20:40.980 --> 20:42.900
and eventually IMAX.

20:42.900 --> 20:44.060
And LIMAX.

20:44.060 --> 20:47.780
The film industry upped its game with special effects that television, up until really,

20:47.780 --> 20:50.540
really recently, could never hope to compete with.

20:50.540 --> 20:53.940
And of course there was that goddamn 48fps bullshit with The Hobbit.

20:53.940 --> 20:57.340
And of course now we not only have 3D, we have 4D.

20:57.340 --> 21:02.020
But the rise and fall of the roadshow, Hollywood's focus on what they perceive as safe bets,

21:02.020 --> 21:06.260
as well as their desire for trends to never change so that they can predict them, speaks

21:06.260 --> 21:10.380
not only to the gimmicks Hollywood tries to keep on life support, but also to actual

21:10.380 --> 21:12.140
trends as well.

21:12.140 --> 21:16.220
But what is interesting to me is not so much the roadshow itself, but the insistence of

21:16.220 --> 21:20.300
throwing money into genres and gimmicks that audiences are showing increased antipathy

21:20.300 --> 21:21.300
for.

21:21.300 --> 21:24.940
Just look at the recent trailers for Titans and Venom, films that the studios made to

21:24.940 --> 21:29.060
respond to trends that died years ago, and the trailers to which were met with uproarious

21:29.060 --> 21:31.740
laughter and yet someone edited in lines like

21:32.740 --> 21:35.740
and whatever this is.

21:44.260 --> 21:49.140
And high-fived each other in the editing bay and went, yeah, badass.

21:49.140 --> 21:53.980
How do you do, fellow kids?

21:53.980 --> 21:54.980
Just as we didn't get from

21:54.980 --> 21:58.780
Why so serious?

21:58.780 --> 21:59.780
to

21:59.780 --> 22:02.300
Like a turd in the wind

22:02.300 --> 22:05.580
overnight, there was a time and a place for the movie musical before they turned into

22:05.580 --> 22:06.860
self-parody.

22:06.860 --> 22:11.700
The ironic thing now is that Mamma Mia, Here We Go Again is this rare healthy being of

22:11.700 --> 22:16.980
a movie that actually isn't riding a dying trend, and is responding to what a certain

22:16.980 --> 22:18.740
audience wants to see.

22:18.740 --> 22:23.040
There are a lot of wine moms out there, and they're all bankrupting moviepass.

22:23.100 --> 22:26.960
With the merger of Disney and Fox, and the monopolization of an industry that was already

22:26.960 --> 22:33.120
incredibly insular, we are creeping back to that 1960s level of fewer movies being released

22:33.120 --> 22:35.520
and yet bigger and bigger budgets.

22:35.520 --> 22:39.360
And have we hit a point where between domestic and international markets, these movies are

22:39.360 --> 22:44.640
too big to fail and bring down the entire industry like it was in the 1960s?

22:44.640 --> 22:45.860
Probably not.

22:45.860 --> 22:51.000
Studios have gotten much better about at least not losing money the way they did in the 1960s,

22:51.000 --> 22:54.680
but with more and more money being funneled into fewer and fewer projects, the current

22:54.680 --> 23:00.160
state is beginning to resemble the studio system of the late 1960s, just ever so slightly

23:00.160 --> 23:02.120
more monopolistic.

23:02.120 --> 23:06.440
And again, one has to wonder where the studios are responding to a demand, or if they're

23:06.440 --> 23:10.640
trying to force a trend on life support when in the real world, audiences were over it

23:10.640 --> 23:11.640
a long time ago.

23:11.640 --> 23:16.720
Then we will eat your face right off your head, like a turd in the wind.

23:16.720 --> 23:19.880
I've seen trends you people wouldn't believe.

23:19.880 --> 23:24.280
48 frames per second bouncing off the shoulder of a storm giant.

23:24.280 --> 23:32.360
I've seen and smelled 4D versions of Josh Brolin's CGI Thanos face that looks like forgotten bacon.

23:32.360 --> 23:38.600
All these moments will be lost in time, like turds in the wind.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.200
Time to die.

23:40.200 --> 23:47.840
Who are we shilling for today?

23:47.840 --> 23:48.840
It's Skillshare.

23:48.840 --> 23:53.040
Okay, so this episode was brought to you in part by Skillshare.

23:53.040 --> 23:58.400
Skillshare is an online learning community with over 20,000 classes in design, business,

23:58.400 --> 23:59.400
technology, and more.

23:59.400 --> 24:03.120
So one of the most common questions I get is just about the ins and outs of how one

24:03.120 --> 24:09.760
creates a video essay, and turns out they actually already have a class on that at Skillshare.

24:09.760 --> 24:13.720
It's done by fellow YouTuber, Wendover Productions, and he's already created a class about how

24:13.720 --> 24:17.760
he creates video essays, so if you want a tutorial, it's already there.

24:17.760 --> 24:22.080
As for me, I'll actually be creating a class for Skillshare later in the fall.

24:22.080 --> 24:25.200
It's going to be more about research.

24:25.200 --> 24:28.000
As you can see, this episode was very research-heavy.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.320
How does one go about organizing their research?

24:30.320 --> 24:32.080
Well, we'll get to that.

24:32.080 --> 24:36.760
Premium membership gives you unlimited access to high-quality classes on must-know topics.

24:36.760 --> 24:39.520
The host must mention specific classes, categories, oh, I already did that.

24:39.520 --> 24:43.760
For my special offer, you can go down to this URL, and that gives you two months of

24:43.760 --> 24:45.840

24:50.800 --> 24:55.000
As you can see, here are their names in the credits.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.680
Some of them are even real names.
