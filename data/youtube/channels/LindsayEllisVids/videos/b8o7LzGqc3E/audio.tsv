0	6640	There were a lot of event movies to talk about that have come out in 2018 that echoed trends
6640	8960	that have shaped our cinematic past.
8960	13840	But there was one movie this year that is truly the embodiment of the modern epoch.
13840	18980	One movie that some have described as the most ambitious crossover of all time.
18980	23820	One movie that built so skillfully on the cinematic universe that came before it.
23820	27440	One movie that is the defining moment of our era.
27440	30920	I'm talking, of course, about Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.
30920	34120	Mamma Mia! Here I go again!
34120	37160	Oh boy, the Great American Musical is back!
37160	42880	But, eh, I mean, on the one hand, high-time cultural milestone voice of a generation for
42880	45200	Wine Mom's Mamma Mia! got a sequel.
45200	48080	You know, so, being a grudge holder makes you fat?
48080	49480	But here's the thing, fam.
49480	52800	On top of movie pass going bankrupt, it's a streaming world now.
52800	54600	I don't like going outside.
54600	57720	And I really don't like giving my undivided attention to things.
57720	61520	And this newfound medium of streaming is reducing interest in the cinema.
61520	65880	I need a gimmick to get my ass out of the house and drive the whole 1.2 miles down to
65880	70400	the Rolling Hills AMC so I can see the latest release in 4K 3D.
70400	75320	If we have enough gimmicks, then surely interest in the cinema will revive.
75320	76320	Or will it?
76320	80640	So, obviously, the Hollywood panic of trying to incentivize people to stop watching goddamn
80640	84560	Stranger Things on Netflix for the fifth time, and to come on out to the movies by
84560	89680	pushing the prestige of gimmicks like 3D, 4D, and even 6D, applies more to big-budget
89680	95680	tentpoles like superhero movies, superhero movies, live-action remakes of Disney classics,
95680	100760	and even superhero movies, more than it does the Hollywood musical.
100760	105080	But that hasn't always been the case.
105080	110480	A long time ago, way back, back in those halcyon days before Valerian and the City of a Thousand
110480	115120	Planets, I had a segment in my video about Joel Schumacher's Phantom of the Opera alluding
115120	119320	to the crash and ultimately the final dumpster fire resting place of the big Hollywood movie
119320	122120	musical, namely Hello Dolly.
122120	125920	But the fall of the great American musical was, of course, much more complicated than
125920	128920	just one movie not making its money back.
128920	131080	And that is what we're going to talk about today.
131080	134200	Because in many regards, the dramatic and expensive death throes of the big Hollywood
134200	138760	musical in the 1960s had more in common with our current-day endless glut of sequels, remakes,
138760	143240	and superhero movies than it does with Mamma Mia, Here We Go Again.
143240	145760	There was a time when musicals were the biggest game in town.
145760	150680	It was a world dominated by Rodgers and Hammerstein, by Julie Andrews, by Gene Kelly.
150680	155200	For decades, the saccharine Broadway-style musical was the event movie.
155200	166320	These were the tentpoles of the mid-20th century, until one day, it all came crashing down.
166320	169680	With the advent of talkies, it wasn't long before musicals found their way onto the big
169680	170680	screen.
170680	174920	First through musical shorts featuring popular performers, and eventually full-length features.
174920	178360	Ever since the advent of sound, musicals were a consistently popular staple.
178360	183340	But in 1939, MGM Studios hired producer Arthur Fried, whose production unit went on to create
183340	187680	what would eventually become the golden era of movie musicals, with titles like Easter
187680	191760	Parade, On the Town, Singing in the Rain, and An American in Paris.
192240	196160	And in the 1950s and early 1960s, the way musicals built hype around their big important
196160	198420	movies was the roadshow.
198420	202040	So what is a roadshow, and how does it fit in here?
202040	204060	Well, it's a gimmick.
204060	208920	But a gimmick that was, particularly through the 1950s to the 1970s, used to promote more
208920	211160	prestige-oriented films.
211160	217240	You got your historical epics, your gut-wrenching war dramas, and of course, the larger-than-life
217240	218240	musical.
218240	226560	You're The Day the Earth Stood Still's and fluffy beach-blanket bingos couldn't
226560	230760	ne'er dream of having a roadshow release, but your Ben Hur's, your Dr. Zhivago's,
230760	233240	and your West Side Story's made for prime fodder.
233240	237080	Basically, before the film goes into wide release, a studio would take it on the road
237080	244480	for a limited, premium release.
244480	247880	Ticket prices were at a premium compared to your average film screening, but the marketing
247880	250120	appealed to a more luxuriant experience.
250120	253320	To quote Mike Todd, the leading purveyor of roadshows in the 1950s,
253320	257720	"'To show audiences gut class and appreciate the arts, they'd be insulted if you didn't
257720	260660	charge premium prices and make it a little hard to see.
260660	263280	This way they don't have to rub elbows with the gum-chewers.'"
263280	267000	Roadshow movies were usually longer than your average release, did not include any shorts
267000	270400	or trailers in front of them, and almost always had an intermission.
270400	273840	You can see this last element parodied in later movies, like Monty Python and the Holy
273840	279840	Grail.
279840	284360	Roadshow movies were presented with pre-recorded overtures, on-tracks, and exit music to mimic
284360	291120	an actual night at the theater.
291120	294520	They almost always included a number of souvenirs and accoutrements for audience members to
294520	299000	take home with them, including programs, pins, and all sorts of licensed merchandise.
299000	303640	So if you're wondering who the f*** would ever buy a $12 Infinity War Popcorn Bucket,
303640	306620	well, there is a precedent for that sort of thing.
306620	310360	And to be clear, roadshows were not only for movie musicals.
310360	314680	Gone with the Wind saw massive success with the roadshow marketing campaign, just that
314680	318880	the format of the musical lent itself well to the roadshow, making them the most common
318880	320520	and often the most popular.
320520	324160	In effect, to buy a ticket to a roadshow movie was to build prestige around the movie, to
324160	330040	make it feel more like an evening night or a Broadway show than just celluloid print.
330040	335520	And if this sounds like a really expensive ploy to get butts into seats, it's because
335520	336520	it is.
336520	339880	Which is why most of these films had a roadshow in a limited release, and ended up getting
339880	343920	a theatrical-cut wide release to most mainstream movie theaters.
343920	349200	But a successful roadshow garnered not only premium ticket sales and more rentals from
349200	353960	regular theaters, but also great word of mouth for a wide release, making them best-case
353960	357760	scenario a risky but profitable marketing method.
357760	361480	So this marketing strategy works well for big-budget movies for decades, and all seems
361480	362640	well and good.
362640	366320	But as movie studios were throwing this promotion at everything and anything being made, as
366320	371520	well as hitting almost toddler levels of managing film budgets themselves, comes the 1950s,
371520	373360	and there's a new game in town.
373360	378400	When you can get this wonderful new 17-inch Westinghouse set at a modest price.
378400	380260	But here's the thing, fam.
380260	384100	On top of the communists ruining everything, it's a television world now.
384100	388380	I have TV dinners to make, and going to the movies makes it really hard to milk any sweet
388380	390740	drops of affection from my loveless marriage.
390740	395660	I don't want to haul ass all the way out of the house and drive 12 miles to Los Angeles
395660	398740	to the Carthay Circle Theater.
398740	402780	Why would I pay more to see a movie that's going to get a wide release in a few weeks
402780	407500	anyway when I can watch Bonanza on the television from the comfort of my own home?
407500	411540	Some recognize the increased dependency on huge roadshows as a dangerous game.
411540	416060	According to Films and Filming in 1963, should these gigantic investments achieve the desired
416060	419740	outcome, Hollywood may well have found the definitive and triumphant answer to the threat
419740	420860	of television.
420860	425020	Should they encounter defeat, the whole face of the film industry may be drastically changed.
425020	429100	Will the public pay the higher prices made necessary by these colossal expenditures?
429100	432460	Is there an audience sufficiently large to permit these pictures to emerge without a
432460	433460	loss?
433460	437900	Will these fabulously expensive films can and will filmgoers absorb?
437900	442660	Around this same time, a string of expensive movie bombs nearly sink entire movie studios.
442660	446820	The most infamous from this era being 20th Century Fox's Cleopatra, a bomb of such
446820	450700	gigantic proportions that it nearly tipped the studio into complete bankruptcy.
450700	454580	Throw in the nascent cultural changes of the early mid-60s, and studios were starting to
454580	458840	realize that the whole concept of the roadshow just wasn't worth the investment anymore,
458840	462980	an aging relic that signaled it was time to let go and move on.
462980	467900	And then, something unexpected happened.
467900	478100	Winds in the east, mist coming in, like something is brewing, about to begin, can't put me
478100	492380	finger on what lies in store, I feel what's to happen, all happened before.
492380	495980	The Hollywood movie musical looks like it might be on its deathbed, and who should come
495980	499300	along to revive it but Walt Disney and Mary Poppins.
499300	503180	The film launches Julie Andrews' film career, ironically after her getting snubbed from
503180	507820	being cast in the role she originated on Broadway with My Fair Lady, and it won a ton of Academy
507820	510300	Awards, including Best Actress for Andrews.
510300	514620	Mary Poppins cost a relatively low $5.2 million to make, and it returned that amount at the
514620	518420	box office quickly, and though it did not run as a roadshow feature in the United States,
518420	520140	it did in London to great success.
520140	524020	Moreover, the film was doing equivalent business to a roadshow release, and Poppins was what
524020	528460	really convinced Disney that he should enter the roadshow musical business.
528460	536900	We'll get to that.
536900	540520	Then there was Warner Bros.' My Fair Lady, the most expensive at the time production
540520	543860	for the A-Link Studio, which was about to be up for sale at the time.
543860	551740	They cast Audrey Hepburn as Eliza Doolittle, a big star with a weaker voice to replace
551740	555700	the Broadway originator of the role, Julie Andrews, and not only does the roadshow gambit
555700	565660	pay off with a huge hit, it nets 8 Academy Awards.
565660	577460	But then, oh boy, here comes the big guns.
577460	583100	The Sound of Music is a big 1950s-style musical smack in the middle of the 1960s, and it does
583100	585780	record box office numbers for a roadshow feature.
585780	589780	The Sound of Music effectively single-handedly reversed the box office disaster 20th Century
589780	593460	Fox had with Cleopatra, so when it looked like the big musical juggernaut was finally
593460	598180	dying as the event movie trend in Hollywood, three big box office musical smashes happened
598180	599760	one right after the other.
599760	603980	Along with a wave of prestige that seemed to back up the phenomena, My Fair Lady, Poppins,
603980	609320	and Music were nominated for a combined 35 Oscars and garnered a total of 18 wins.
609320	611800	And studios lose their shit.
611800	614820	So what do they do in the face of these massive successes?
614820	616460	You gotta chase that trend.
616460	621260	But the earlier prevailing wisdom was that roadshows and big bawdy 1950s-style Hollywood
621260	624220	musicals were on their way out, and that was not wrong.
624220	626340	They were very much on their way out.
626340	628620	But studios were going to ignore this.
628620	635700	To their own downfall.
635700	638860	According to film historian Matthew Kennedy, in the seven years that followed The Sound
638860	643180	of Music, it became de rigueur for any film musical to be released in the roadshow format
643180	646800	if they wanted to be rightfully labeled major, important, or lavish.
646800	650360	The first canary in this coal mine actually came from the Disney company with The Happiest
650360	655000	Millionaire, a roadshow release completed after Walt's death that bombed so spectacularly
655000	656000	you've never heard of it.
656000	659760	But this wasn't a huge investment, and it didn't tank the studio.
659760	665840	Other studios did much, much worse.
665840	669800	Warner Bros. wants to recapture the success of My Fair Lady with another popular Broadway
669800	674960	musical vehicle, Lerner and Lowe's Camelot, a romantic love triangle story based on T.H.
674960	678800	White's The Once and Future King and a personal favorite of the Kennedy family.
678800	681960	It was, by all accounts, the production from hell.
681960	687280	Super expensive attention to detail of historical accuracy inflates the budget and causes delays.
687280	691740	It featured the cast mostly from hell, namely its star, Richard Harris, who was drunk to
691740	696080	a point of liability on set and constantly in giant fights with the producers, its third
696080	701000	party star as Lancelot, Italian actor Francis Nero, barely speaks English, and the production
701000	702620	is plagued by delays.
702620	706760	Most of its tremendously costly shoot in England is unusable, and all of this is going down
706760	711000	while Warner Bros. is being sold, and the studios basically like, fuck it, whatever,
711000	712000	just get it done.
712000	715600	Ultimately, the film ends up costing $15 million, making it the second most expensive Warner
715600	717560	Bros. production after My Fair Lady.
717560	722380	And in the midst of all this, roadshow prices are flipped up from $2 to $6.
722380	726440	And as we all know, raising prices for the exact same product for no reason to see the
726440	729760	exact same thing is a great way to get butts into seats.
729760	732400	Critical response to Camelot is dire.
732400	736240	Whereas The Sound of Music got ripped hard for its sentimentality, but not much else,
736240	740240	Camelot is almost universally panned, not just for its dated sense of traditionalism
740240	742920	and sentimentality, but for a lot of technical reasons.
742920	747240	Also, in contrast with musicals like The Sound of Music, no one gave a fuck about Camelot
747240	752000	the Musical before the film version, it having closed on Broadway in 1963 after a modest
752000	753280	three-year run.
753280	757280	It didn't have the fervent fanbase of other Broadway shows, nor did it have any artistically
757280	759740	inspired moments a la Mary Poppins.
759740	764080	And by 1967, movies like this are starting to feel like a relic.
764800	767000	Isn't that Malcolm there?
767000	770880	By this point, movies like Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, Bonnie and Clyde, and Help
770880	772680	are revolutionizing cinema.
772680	776540	But these movies are new, unpredictable, and studios wanted to continue sinking their money
776540	780080	into what up until this point had been considered safe.
780080	782080	It's incredible.
782080	783080	It's impossible.
783080	784080	But it's true.
784080	787480	A man can talk to the animal.
787480	791940	Hey, people liked Rex Harrison and My Fair Lady, and people loved Mary Poppins.
791940	795100	Why not create an original musical based on an English children's book series that's
795100	796500	also a vehicle for Harrison?
796500	800580	At the time, Dr. Dolittle seemed like a good idea, given that a more child-friendly musical
800580	804100	with a large cast of animals would reach a larger audience and also be ripe for the picking
804100	805420	when it came to toyetic tie-ins.
805420	807020	But we have a problem.
807020	811060	Rex Harrison is a giant pain in the ass who, like Richard Harris, is tremendously difficult
811060	812060	to work with.
812060	815080	So Harrison leaves the film, and Christopher Plummer is brought on.
815080	819100	But then, hey-o, Rex Harrison wants back in, and the studio is still contractually obligated
819100	821180	to pay Plummer his agreed-upon salary.
821180	826220	There was also the constant recasting of Bumpo, the prince of a fictional African kingdom.
826220	827220	Yikes.
827220	831420	Bumpo was originally supposed to be played by Sammy Davis Jr., whom Harrison refused
831420	832420	to work with.
832420	833420	Said Harrison,
833420	834740	I don't want to work with an entertainer.
834740	835740	I want an actor.
835740	836740	A real actor.
836740	837820	Not a song and dance man.
837820	841580	But eventually the part was finally reduced, given to relatively unknown character actor
841580	846460	Jeffrey Holder, who had his name changed to…
846460	848180	William Shakespeare the Tenth.
848180	850620	God, this just keeps getting weirder.
850700	852020	Oh, and animals.
852020	853020	Oh, animals.
856060	859980	Two million dollars of the budget were allotted to the animal-related costs, quarantine fees,
859980	865300	which included a lot of giraffe-related mishaps, between one dying on set, trying to get Rex
865300	870140	Harrison to ride on one, and a three-day production delay that happened when, according to Doolittle
870140	873540	Choreographer, the giraffe stepped on his own cock.
873540	877500	The film ended up costing $18 million, triple the original budget.
877540	881420	And the final result is… a mess.
881420	884020	The roadshow for Doolittle became more of a focus group.
884020	887500	They were editing it as they were taking it on the road, trying to trim it based on audience
887500	890380	reactions, which was tepid to negative throughout.
890380	893580	All this to say nothing of the exorbitant amount of merchandising that accompanied the
893580	894580	movie.
894580	899820	With over 300 official pieces of Dr. Doolittle swag, from bikinis to pudding mix, worth $200
899820	901780	million, little of which sold.
901780	903980	To quote a Fox promotion staffer years later,
904020	907060	That f***ing Dr. Doolittle killed off merchandising tie-ins.
907060	908060	Ha ha ha.
908060	909060	Ha ha.
909060	910060	For now.
910060	914140	In the end, box office and critical response murdered Dr. Doolittle, with the movie only
914140	918500	grossing $9 million of its $18 million budget, and it being derided as a boring movie laced
918500	922580	with a white man's burden narrative and cartoonishly racist stereotypes of Africa.
922580	925740	Its legacy is perhaps summed up best by producer Robert Zanuck.
925740	928740	You look back now and ask, how could you have been so stupid?
928740	931540	Dr. Doolittle was conceived in a period of euphoria.
931540	935140	We were riding a musical wave that we didn't realize was going to come crashing down on
935140	936140	the beach all at once.
936140	939380	Sure, there were probably signs and warnings out there, but you were already so committed
939380	943200	financially and emotionally that it's very hard to pull the plug on these big undertakings.
943200	947580	Other films like Finian's Rainbow, Paint Your Wagon, and Man of La Mancha also underperformed
947580	950020	during this weird glut period.
950020	953660	But none landed with such an expensive thud as...
953660	955740	Well, hello.
955740	956740	Look who's here.
956740	957740	Dolly.
957740	958740	This is Louis.
958740	959740	Hello, Louis.
959740	960740	Dolly.
961380	964460	On paper, Hello, Dolly! seemed like a natural for film adaptation.
964460	968460	A light-hearted romantic comedy that swept the Tony Awards in 1964 with a then-record
968460	969740	Breaking 10 wins.
969740	973300	The casting of Barbra Streisand was bolstered by the success of Funny Girl a year before
973300	974300	the film's release.
974300	980380	Don't tell me not to live, just sit and putter Life's candy and the sun's a ball of butter
980380	982980	Cementing Streisand as America's darling.
982980	987220	But even then, the studio was ignoring how miscast Streisand was.
987220	991900	Dolly Levi is supposed to be, like, middle-aged, she's in her 50s, and at the time, Barbra
991900	998740	Streisand was 25.
998740	1008700	The casting choice also snubbed Broadway role-originator Carol Channing for a younger, hotter actress
1008700	1013380	in the title role, resulting in a Channing-Streisand feud that was arguably more interesting than
1013380	1014620	the movie itself.
1014620	1017500	But there were already concerns about the relevance of the film, which was about the
1017500	1021660	romantic, sunny exploits of turn-of-the-century white New Yorkers from as high up as its own
1021660	1023020	director Gene Kelly.
1023020	1024020	To quote Kelly,
1024020	1027180	It's not the kind of film I would make as a first choice, but what else is there?
1027180	1030940	What happens now is that studios buy stage shows after they are already dated and then
1030940	1033500	spends a lot of money turning them into dated movies.
1033500	1035960	The musical is the victim of changing times.
1035960	1041260	So even director Gene Kelly kind of knew that this was kind of a bad idea, but they went
1041260	1042740	ahead and made it anyway.
1042860	1046900	Initially, Dolly was given a budget of $10 million, with $1 million alone going to Barbra
1046900	1047900	Streisand.
1047900	1049900	Of course, this too fell into budget hell.
1049900	1053100	Adding to that was a clause in the contract that Fox had struck with Broadway producer
1053100	1056940	David Merrick, that is, that the film version of Dolly could not be released within five
1056940	1058860	years of the original contract signing.
1058860	1071100	By 1969, with the Broadway production still in healthy financial shape, Dolly had been
1071100	1074540	sitting on the already cash-broke Fox's shelf for long enough.
1074540	1078340	In the end, Fox broke their contract and promised Zanuck an additional $2 million, along with
1078340	1083140	the promise to reimburse the Broadway production if its weekly box office fell below $60,000.
1083140	1087460	And while Dolly seemed poised to do well, if not sound of music numbers at the box office,
1087460	1091340	it did not have repeat viewers, audience admiration, or critical clout to keep up the momentum
1091340	1093260	or even turn a profit for Fox.
1093260	1097340	According to Matthew Kennedy, when Dolly finished production, 17 of the 25 top film rentals
1097340	1098340	were road shows.
1098340	1101580	In response, the industry prepared a bottleneck of reserved seat giants.
1101580	1106220	A record-breaking 12 were scheduled for release over the last four months of 1968.
1106220	1109660	Marketers faced a huge dilemma in catching people's attention amid the glut and convincing
1109660	1113100	them that the road show experience was still worth the time, cost, and effort.
1113100	1116180	With a road show opening practically every week, how do you market something as being
1116180	1118380	special when it isn't special anymore?
1118380	1123080	Said film critic Pauline Kael in the wake of the 1969 musical Paint Your Wagon, giant
1123080	1126540	musicals have finally broken the back of the American film industry.
1126540	1130860	There is almost no way, short of a miracle, that Paint Your Wagon can recover its costs,
1130860	1133780	although there are several other movies of this kind waiting to be released or to be
1133780	1136540	completed, and at least one of them is even more expensive.
1136540	1139740	It is highly unlikely that any new ones will be scheduled for production in the years to
1139740	1141300	come, or perhaps, ever.
1146540	1150100	There were outliers to this trend, like Fiddler on the Roof and Cabaret.
1150100	1154100	Fiddler was given the road show treatment, but carefully, and it sported no budget-breaking
1154100	1155900	stars, names, or elaborate sets.
1155900	1160060	Cabaret was not a road show, and very much falls into a more experimental, counter-cultural
1160060	1163060	rubric that has little in common with films like Dolly.
1163060	1167260	According to Matthew Kennedy, Fosse made a musical for people who hated musicals.
1167260	1171500	This wasn't the death of the musical, but it was the death of a certain type of musical.
1171500	1176160	But at the same time, it still speaks to this continued Hollywood truism, Hollywood digging
1176160	1182580	into certain ideas on what it considers safe long after these truisms are no longer true.
1182580	1184940	Add Pauline Kael in her review of Hello, Dolly!
1184940	1188660	At just the time for great new movie musicals, the moguls who can't see further than the
1188660	1191020	end of their cigars tell us that the form is dead.
1191020	1194960	Daryl F. Zanuck says you can't make little musicals, and the rest of the industry seems
1194960	1195960	to concur.
1195960	1197020	I think they're dead wrong.
1197020	1200540	I love musicals, but I hate big, expensive musicals because I have to wade through all
1200540	1204300	the filler of production values to get what I want to see, and I suspect there are millions
1204300	1206100	of people who feel the same way.
1206100	1209540	We have seen time and time again the film industry having to fight not only to keep
1209540	1213780	itself alive, but to keep it the most culturally relevant thing.
1213780	1217460	How do you compete with media that doesn't require you to go anywhere?
1217460	1222580	When you can get this wonderful new 17-inch Westinghouse set at a modest price.
1222580	1225820	The fall of the Hollywood musical created the landscape that would lead to the era of
1225820	1226820	the blockbuster.
1226820	1229060	Jaws, Star Wars, Indiana Jones.
1229060	1234020	We'd have gimmicks like 3D in the 1980s, which mercifully died until it came back.
1234020	1235220	And it's back.
1235220	1236460	I love it.
1236460	1240980	There was also the expansion of 70mm, which played well with films like Lawrence of Arabia,
1240980	1242900	and eventually IMAX.
1242900	1244060	And LIMAX.
1244060	1247780	The film industry upped its game with special effects that television, up until really,
1247780	1250540	really recently, could never hope to compete with.
1250540	1253940	And of course there was that goddamn 48fps bullshit with The Hobbit.
1253940	1257340	And of course now we not only have 3D, we have 4D.
1257340	1262020	But the rise and fall of the roadshow, Hollywood's focus on what they perceive as safe bets,
1262020	1266260	as well as their desire for trends to never change so that they can predict them, speaks
1266260	1270380	not only to the gimmicks Hollywood tries to keep on life support, but also to actual
1270380	1272140	trends as well.
1272140	1276220	But what is interesting to me is not so much the roadshow itself, but the insistence of
1276220	1280300	throwing money into genres and gimmicks that audiences are showing increased antipathy
1280300	1281300	for.
1281300	1284940	Just look at the recent trailers for Titans and Venom, films that the studios made to
1284940	1289060	respond to trends that died years ago, and the trailers to which were met with uproarious
1289060	1291740	laughter and yet someone edited in lines like
1292740	1295740	and whatever this is.
1304260	1309140	And high-fived each other in the editing bay and went, yeah, badass.
1309140	1313980	How do you do, fellow kids?
1313980	1314980	Just as we didn't get from
1314980	1318780	Why so serious?
1318780	1319780	to
1319780	1322300	Like a turd in the wind
1322300	1325580	overnight, there was a time and a place for the movie musical before they turned into
1325580	1326860	self-parody.
1326860	1331700	The ironic thing now is that Mamma Mia, Here We Go Again is this rare healthy being of
1331700	1336980	a movie that actually isn't riding a dying trend, and is responding to what a certain
1336980	1338740	audience wants to see.
1338740	1343040	There are a lot of wine moms out there, and they're all bankrupting moviepass.
1343100	1346960	With the merger of Disney and Fox, and the monopolization of an industry that was already
1346960	1353120	incredibly insular, we are creeping back to that 1960s level of fewer movies being released
1353120	1355520	and yet bigger and bigger budgets.
1355520	1359360	And have we hit a point where between domestic and international markets, these movies are
1359360	1364640	too big to fail and bring down the entire industry like it was in the 1960s?
1364640	1365860	Probably not.
1365860	1371000	Studios have gotten much better about at least not losing money the way they did in the 1960s,
1371000	1374680	but with more and more money being funneled into fewer and fewer projects, the current
1374680	1380160	state is beginning to resemble the studio system of the late 1960s, just ever so slightly
1380160	1382120	more monopolistic.
1382120	1386440	And again, one has to wonder where the studios are responding to a demand, or if they're
1386440	1390640	trying to force a trend on life support when in the real world, audiences were over it
1390640	1391640	a long time ago.
1391640	1396720	Then we will eat your face right off your head, like a turd in the wind.
1396720	1399880	I've seen trends you people wouldn't believe.
1399880	1404280	48 frames per second bouncing off the shoulder of a storm giant.
1404280	1412360	I've seen and smelled 4D versions of Josh Brolin's CGI Thanos face that looks like forgotten bacon.
1412360	1418600	All these moments will be lost in time, like turds in the wind.
1418600	1420200	Time to die.
1420200	1427840	Who are we shilling for today?
1427840	1428840	It's Skillshare.
1428840	1433040	Okay, so this episode was brought to you in part by Skillshare.

1438400	1439400	technology, and more.
1439400	1443120	So one of the most common questions I get is just about the ins and outs of how one
1443120	1449760	creates a video essay, and turns out they actually already have a class on that at Skillshare.
1449760	1453720	It's done by fellow YouTuber, Wendover Productions, and he's already created a class about how
1453720	1457760	he creates video essays, so if you want a tutorial, it's already there.
1457760	1462080	As for me, I'll actually be creating a class for Skillshare later in the fall.
1462080	1465200	It's going to be more about research.
1465200	1468000	As you can see, this episode was very research-heavy.
1468000	1470320	How does one go about organizing their research?
