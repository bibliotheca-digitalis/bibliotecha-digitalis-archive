1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,500
Yay! I'm happy. So, the last vote for Loose Cannon was X-Men themed because I said so.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:16,800
And while it was really close, the closest I've had yet, in fact, my favorite X-Man, Kurt Wagner, won. Hooray!

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,500
This is the Nightcrawler episode.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,500
Considering Nightcrawler's not one of the main X-Men that you see in, like, every fucking thing,

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
he's surprisingly popular because he is the best.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Seriously, I don't have anything, like, deep to say about this character. He's just the best.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
In a franchise that is often dour and portentous and way too convoluted, Kurt Wagner is our beacon of light.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
He is not, like, nightcrawling in my skin. Most of the time.

9
00:00:49,500 --> 00:01:00,500
So, let's take a look at everybody's favorite acrobat-turned-superhero-turned-priest-turned-superhero-again, Kurt Wagner, Nightcrawler.

10
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,500
The X-Men can be read as an allegory for basically any minority group.

11
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,500
This was always the intent, but it would coalesce more significantly when we learn about Magneto's backstory

12
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,000
as a prisoner of German concentration camps a few years after the series launched,

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and Xavier and Magneto eventually taking on what some would describe as a sort of Martin Luther King-Malcolm X dynamic,

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
with respect to their ideologies.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm not gonna touch that one.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
There's something I need to tell you.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
By the time the movies came out, it had shifted more to a big gay allegory,

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
especially under the vision of director Bryan Singer.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Have you tried not being a mutant?

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,500
That one is a bit more on the nose, because unlike, say, a race allegory,

21
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,500
you can't usually tell who's a mutant just by looking at them.

22
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:59,500
Most of them can pass as normal, so to speak, but there are a few who cannot.

23
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Nightcrawler was created by artist Dave Cockrum super-originally in the 60s,

24
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:11,500
but the X-Men version debuted in 1975 alongside Storm, Colossus, and Thunderbird, who died one issue later.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Before Nightcrawler was an X-Men character, he was one of Cockrum's own creations,

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
a demon, and he acted like one, and he was a jerk.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But then Cockrum made him an alien,

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
because his people were, like, the source of Earth's legends and mythologies about demons,

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and eventually, when Marvel came a-knockin', a mutant.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Kurt is usually described as being fuzzy.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
In some versions, he just has blue skin,

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
but usually it's taken to mean that he's, like, covered in this layer of, like,

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,500
not so much, like, animal fur, like, beast, but, like, you know, fuzz.

34
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,500
And then he also has normal human hair on top of that.

35
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,500
He can teleport, but not very far.

36
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,000
A couple of miles at the most, and always somewhere he's already been.

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,500
I have to be able to see where I'm going, otherwise I could wind up inside a wall.

38
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,500
But superpowers aside, the reason Kurt has remained so popular over the years as a character

39
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,500
isn't his powers or the way that he looks, but really because of his personality.

40
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,000
For a long time, Nightcrawler was the only member of the X-Men who couldn't pass for a non-mutant,

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
because, you know, Beast was not with the X-Men through basically all the 70s.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He's also probably the most affable member of the team.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
He's flirtatious, he's chivalrous, he's playful.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,500
He uses swords, and he dresses like a pirate sometimes.

45
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,500
He loves Errol Flynn movies.

46
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,000
Even Wolverine likes him.

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,500
He's just the best.

48
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,500
And that persona is basically one giant coping mechanism.

49
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,000
He states many times over in the comics that he knows people will be freaked out

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
by the way that he looks, so he anticipates this and goes out of his way to be chill about it,

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,500
basically using his charms to overcome people's prejudices.

52
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Again, this worked a lot better when mutants were a relative rarity in the Marvel Universe

53
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,500
and not basically like every other person you bump into while walking down Bleeker Street.

54
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:59,000
As a baby, Kurt was adopted and raised by a Romani, uh, sorceress named Mergali,

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,500
like every foundling in the Marvel Universe.

56
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,500
She's off and on evil and basically makes no sense.

57
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,000
We're not gonna talk about her.

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,500
Originally, he was going to be Mystique's child by destiny.

59
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,000
Mystique in the form of a dude impregnating Destiny.

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,500
Despite their lesbian relationship being canon, Marvel was like,

61
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,000
eh, no, no, no, no.

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So, um, he was originally the son of some German aristocrat named Count Wagner

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,500
or Baron Von Wagner or something.

64
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,500
It changes.

65
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,000
Given that Kurt has never actually met this guy,

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,500
it's unclear as to why he didn't take Mergali's surname instead of

67
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,500
biological dad Wagner's surname, but okay.

68
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,500
Kurt basically macks on everybody.

69
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,500
Again, this is probably somewhat a part of that coping mechanism thing

70
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,500
until he up and decided, hey, I want to be a priest.

71
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,500
We'll get to that.

72
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,000
He is sometimes romantically paired with the occasional fellow X-Man,

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,500
but the most consistent love interest is his adopted sister, Amanda Sefton.

74
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,500
Kurt seems to be into Amanda when she's around.

75
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,500
It'll be like, yay, you're back, you're the love of my life,

76
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,500
and then she goes away for some reason,

77
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,000
and then he gets over it and maybe dates someone else,

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and then it's like, yay, you're back, you're the love of my life,

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,500
and then she goes away for some reason.

80
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,500
At the time of the recording, she literally just went away

81
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,500
in the Nightcrawler series.

82
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,500
Kurt is also Wolverine's best friend.

83
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,500
So for all of Wolverine's relationships that matter,

84
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,500
he's got Jean, who he wants or wanted,

85
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,500
a small army of plucky female sidekicks,

86
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,500
and Kurt, who he drinks beer with.

87
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,500
And sometimes, well, that was a thing that happened

88
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,500
from the first Nightcrawler miniseries, not the one that's going on now.

89
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,500
And in the words of the artist, nobody at Marvel noticed.

90
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,500
Cheeky, literally.

91
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,500
Anyway, let's look at some of the adaptations.

92
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Pride of the X-Men, Pride with a Y,

93
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,500
was a pilot for an unproduced X-Men animated series,

94
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,500
and you can see why it was not meant to be.

95
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,500
The animation quality is about on par with a Jim and the Holograms episode,

96
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,500
and it is very Jim in style and in quality.

97
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,500
Magneto is truly, truly outrageous.

98
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,500
But the writing and acting was just not there.

99
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,500
It is good, little one. Colossus like rain.

100
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,500
This show follows Kitty Pryde when she first shows up at the Xavier School,

101
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,500
and they are going for the playful, precocious Kurt

102
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,500
and failing so beautifully.

103
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,500
Ah, Fräulein, what a lovely vision you are.

104
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,500
Please, allow me.

105
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,500
That is literally their first interaction.

106
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,500
Stranger danger.

107
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Fräulein, you left before I could properly welcome you.

108
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,500
Stranger danger, Kitty. Stranger danger.

109
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,500
This did happen in the comics, but it was way, way, way more low-key.

110
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,500
Kurt was not stranger danger in the comic version of this.

111
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Until later, my child.

112
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Stranger danger, Kitty. Don't be alone in a room with him.

113
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,500
They're trying to frame it like she's the unreasonable one,

114
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,500
when he's just being like, ah, stop touching me.

115
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,500
So that series didn't turn into a thing,

116
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,500
but by the time we did get a real X-Men series a few years later,

117
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Kurt was not in the X-Men comics anymore.

118
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,500
The X-Men all died or something, fake died.

119
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Anyway, so they're off the map,

120
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,500
and Kurt and Kitty Pryde, who are by this point besties,

121
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,500
they have a sad, but they go to England

122
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,500
and start their own damn superhero group called Excalibur.

123
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
And this series lasted for ten years.

124
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,500
It was also one of those rare co-ed groups that had a female majority,

125
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,500
at least for the first few years, and no one ever commented on it.

126
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Excalibur wasn't really much with the social issues.

127
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,500
It was a much lighter adventure story thing.

128
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,500
It was cute, it was fun, it dealt with a lot of universe hopping, and I loved it.

129
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,500
This was all before Kurt really found God,

130
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,500
because when he does come back to the X-Men, boom.

131
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,500
Kurt being all Jesus-y is also an element in the animated series.

132
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,500
Our ability to understand God's purpose is limited,

133
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,500
but we take comfort in the fact that his love is limitless.

134
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Kurt only shows up in two episodes of this show,

135
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,500
and it's kind of odd, considering he was one of the most popular X-Men characters,

136
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,500
even though he wasn't in the main X-Men books at the time.

137
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,500
He is a monk who dresses like that.

138
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,500
The episode starts with him literally being chased

139
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,500
by literal townsfolk with literal torches and pitchforks.

140
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,500
Wolverine, Rogue, and Gambit, meanwhile, are on vacation?

141
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Yeah? Well, next time, plan your own darn vacation.

142
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Like, they seem like they're being forced into this vacation.

143
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,500
And before you know it, the episode has turned into a conversation

144
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,500
about Wolverine's personal relationship with Jesus Christ.

145
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,500
I've tried. Don't you think I want that?

146
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,500
Whoa, tone it down, Wolverine.

147
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,500
Fortunately, even though the monastery burns down,

148
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,500
what with the torches and pitchforks,

149
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,500
the episode ends with the townsfolk getting over it

150
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
and everybody gets along.

151
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
But the most beautiful thing about this,

152
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,500
the episode ends with Wolverine finding God.

153
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,500
You comforted me. I will trust and will not be afraid.

154
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
Yep.

155
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,500
He pops up again in an episode where, so proper that X-Men was,

156
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,500
we find out that everyone is related.

157
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
They just want your brother!

158
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,500
Huh?

159
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,500
It's like how Magneto is everyone's father,

160
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
while Mystique is everyone's mother.

161
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,500
And Kurt, you are just so insufferably preachy in this series.

162
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,500
Actually, I take it back. I'm glad you're only in two episodes.

163
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Why should you or your God care about me?

164
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,500
As for God, he cares for all of us.

165
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,500
But in the end, Mystique, despite being about to sell him out,

166
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,500
does a bit of the old self-sacrifice, so I guess she's not all bad.

167
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,500
And that's the last we see of him in this series.

168
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,500
This was about the time in the comics when Kurt went from being, like,

169
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,500
modestly, normal, you know, practicing Catholic,

170
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,500
to, hey guys, I'mma be a priest.

171
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,500
And everyone's like, weird, you never expressed interest in that before.

172
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
Yeah, I did.

173
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,500
This didn't come completely out of nowhere,

174
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,500
but before this, the religious stuff was initially much more low-key.

175
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,500
In one of his earlier comics, Wolverine walks in one day and sees Kurt praying,

176
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,500
and he's like, hey, I didn't know you were religious.

177
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
And Kurt's like, yep.

178
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,500
And so, it was always there after that,

179
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,500
but only insofar as Kurt appears to be, like, practicing Catholic,

180
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,500
then with no motivating factor or ever showing prior interest in joining the priesthood.

181
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,500
Priest.

182
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,500
Somewhere along the line in the late 90s, he gets fully ordained offscreen somewhere.

183
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,500
Never mind that that shit takes, you know, years.

184
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
You know, it's kind of like becoming a doctor.

185
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,500
Whatever, he's blue.

186
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
This got retconned a few years after that,

187
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,500
and I feel like I am one of the few X-Men fans who did not loathe

188
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,500
the entirety of the infamous Chuck Austin run of Uncanny X-Men,

189
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,500
but about the things that he did with Kurt.

190
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
Number one was Holy War.

191
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,500
See, turns out that Kurt never was ordained as a priest.

192
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,500
Someone telepathically implanted it in his mind.

193
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,500
Man, the trust issues people must have in this universe.

194
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,500
Anyway, it's stupid, but the long and short is that there was this big conspiracy

195
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,500
that wanted Kurt to eventually become the pope,

196
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:36,500
and then they were going to use communion wafers to make all the Catholics in the world explode,

197
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,500
and people would be like,

198
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,500
ah, rapture, and then it would be revealed that Kurt looks the way he does,

199
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,500
and then people were going to think he was the Antichrist,

200
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:52,500
and this was all set in motion because there was a nun who got raped by a priest

201
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,500
and wanted to murder all of the Catholics.

202
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,500
You see why people didn't care much for this stretch?

203
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,500
And then, of course, the other thing was the retcon of Kurt's origin story.

204
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:07,500
During the Draco, we find out that Kurt's dad was this red motherfucker named Azazel.

205
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,500
He's kind of the worst.

206
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,500
Like, he's a demon mutant.

207
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,500
A mutant in the way that Apocalypse is a mutant, I guess.

208
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Some kind of demon something,

209
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,500
and he was just making babies all over the planet to help with his evil plan,

210
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,500
and Kurt was one of them.

211
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Nope. Couldn't be enough that he happens to look like a demon.

212
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,500
He's gotta be actual demon spawn.

213
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,500
Then Chuck Austin went on the record in some interview and said that Kurt also has two dicks,

214
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
because he's got two fingers.

215
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,500
I heard that motherfucker had, like, 30 goddamn dicks.

216
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,500
You know how, like, normal people have four fingers so they have four dicks?

217
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
Okay, Chuck Austin.

218
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
Buh-bye.

219
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,500
We are right beside you, popcorn!

220
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,500
X-Men Evolution showed us a more successful execution of what I think they were going for

221
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
with Pride of the X-Men.

222
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,500
He's not Stranger Danger here so much as overcompensating,

223
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,500
socially awkward, but good-natured for an exchange student.

224
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Ah, she's fully not into the fuzzy dude.

225
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,500
The characters are divided between teachers and students here.

226
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Kurt is one of the students.

227
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,500
The show also keeps both the mystique-is-his-mom and the rogue-is-his-adoptive-sister angle.

228
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,500
Amanda Sefton is here too, and thank God she is not his adoptive sister this time,

229
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,500
so it's way less weird.

230
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
Although it is still kind of weird.

231
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,500
When you suddenly changed into...into something else,

232
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,500
and then disappeared, I couldn't believe it!

233
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,500
But I couldn't stop thinking about it.

234
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,500
Your...your tail, your...didgeridoo-hind legs.

235
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,500
All I knew was, I just had to get to know you.

236
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,500
She sees his true self and thinks,

237
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
hot, and not like,

238
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,500
what?

239
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,500
Anyway, this show is on the lighter side,

240
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,500
younger, skewing, and probably the best of the X-Men cartoons,

241
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
if only because it really holds to that whole

242
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
school-for-mutants thing,

243
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,500
instead of school-for-adults

244
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,500
that train in the danger room all the time.

245
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
Who the hell is this?

246
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,500
But in the Munich Circus, I was known as the Incredible Nightcrawler.

247
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,500
Kurt had a goodly-sized part in X2 X-Men United,

248
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,500
played by Alan Cumming.

249
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,500
The movie starts when he tries to kill the president

250
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
in a scene that is just the best damn scene,

251
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
under mind control, of course.

252
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
He's...he's a cinnamon roll in this version.

253
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,500
He's a bit shyer and more religious than in the comic incarnations,

254
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,500
and the problem that a lot of people had with this version

255
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
that it is too religious,

256
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,500
to which I say, hey, the guy's just been under mind control.

257
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,500
He's kind of freaked out.

258
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
The praying doesn't bother me, that makes sense.

259
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
The scarification...

260
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,500
How many do you have?

261
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
One for every sin.

262
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,500
So quite a few.

263
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
It's like cutting is cool when it's for Jesus.

264
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Which, again, would kind of make sense

265
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
if you have a religious person who looks like him

266
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,500
who's desperate to prove just how not a demon he is.

267
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,500
Especially when you consider that at the end of the day,

268
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,500
the character they're going for,

269
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,500
he seems kind of just like a good-natured religious dude,

270
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,500
not a self-flagellating scarification practitioner.

271
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,500
It's even more flimsy when at the end of the day,

272
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,500
the scars are there pretty much totally for aesthetic reasons.

273
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
That said...

274
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,500
F*** the haters.

275
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,500
I love Alan Cumming, and I love this version,

276
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
and I love this movie. This movie is so great.

277
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,500
You know, he's nice, and he's shy, and sometimes mischievous,

278
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,500
and often heroic.

279
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
He's even kind of proud of his whole circus thing.

280
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,500
But in the Munich circus, I was known as the incredible nightcrawler.

281
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,500
Yes, save it.

282
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,500
Aww.

283
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,500
I feel like this was meant to be set up for that third X-Men movie

284
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,500
that they never ended up making.

285
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Like, Kurt and Logan were going to learn to be friends,

286
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
and that third X-Men movie, that didn't...

287
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,500
Yep.

288
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,500
Too bad they never made that third X-Men movie, huh?

289
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
Welcome, mutants.

290
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,500
For the I wish X-Men Evolution had been darker and grittier crowd,

291
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
we have Wolverine and the X-Men.

292
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,500
And this series assumes the audience has some familiarity with the material,

293
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,500
because it starts after the X-Men have already disbanded.

294
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
Xavier and Jean have disappeared,

295
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,500
and Wolverine is trying to get the gang back together,

296
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,500
and the plot for the whole season is ridiculously convoluted,

297
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
so I'm not even going to bother.

298
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,500
It's, like, all of the bad guys.

299
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
All of them.

300
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,500
You can tell this show skews older,

301
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,500
because the male characters actually appear to have some human anatomy.

302
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,500
I'm going to assume there's only one dick in there.

303
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,500
Nightcrawler's off doing his own thing for the first half of the series,

304
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:38,500
and during this period, we only see him in episodes where he is the main character.

305
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:43,500
He ends up on Genosha, which is Magneto's totalitarian mutant-topia.

306
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
And of course, things are not going so great over there,

307
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
because, you know, Magneto's a little bit of a dictator,

308
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,500
but he does kind of have, like, a little bit of a thing with the Scarlet Witch.

309
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
Anyway, while he is gallant and heroic,

310
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,500
he's also not much fun in this show, because nobody is.

311
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
As always, there are alternate versions within the comics,

312
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,500
although they have an odd consistency to them.

313
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,500
We meet an alternate Nazi version in the Excalibur comics,

314
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,500
who's a... rapist.

315
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,500
And then there's an evil version in the Magic miniseries from the 80s,

316
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
who's also...

317
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,500
And then there's the version from the Ultimate Universe.

318
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,500
Hello, darkness, my old friend.

319
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,500
Well, he's obsessed with Dazzler, and kidnaps her at one point.

320
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,500
He's also dark and gritty and really inconsistent, and nobody likes him.

321
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,500
But he's dead now, so eh.

322
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,500
Are there ultimate versions of characters that people actually like, besides Miles?

323
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,500
And finally, because it was his turn, I guess,

324
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,500
Nightcrawler died during one of those belabored,

325
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,500
multi-issue series-spanning event crossovers that I hate.

326
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,500
There is a living MacGuffin named Hope,

327
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,500
and he dies saving her in a way that...

328
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,500
I can't help but think, you know,

329
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,500
he could have figured out something a little bit less, you know,

330
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
martyr-y, but...

331
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Okay.

332
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
X-Man down, you know the drill.

333
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,500
Nightcrawler's only down for about two years before they bring him back.

334
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,500
He's in heaven, and you know who shows back up?

335
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,500
But that motherf***er Azazel.

336
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,500
And you know what?

337
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:11,500
If we must have a character as ridiculous as Azazel,

338
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,500
he may as well be dressed like a pirate,

339
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,500
and sailing a pirate ship around the afterlife,

340
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,500
and commanding an army of demons in his quest to take over heaven,

341
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,500
while dressed like a pirate.

342
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,500
So, Nightcrawler's alive again.

343
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,500
But I actually really like the series he was brought back in and stars in now.

344
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,500
Not the this, but the this.

345
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,500
Because it's fun, and it's like an adventure book,

346
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,500
and it's not trying to do the ultimate gritty thing,

347
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
and it retains that allegory,

348
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
but it has fun with it, and it's well-written,

349
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,500
and I dig it, keep, oh wait.

350
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
Damn it, Secret Wars.

351
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,500
And next year, get hype, because he's back, baby!

352
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,500
Yay!

353
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,500
Finally!

354
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500
He is played by this kid,

355
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,500
and, um,

356
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,500
when did he get started on those scars?

357
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,500
He's like, 12.

358
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,500
Anyway, well I'm so happy he's back,

359
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,500
because there was a really big hole in my heart

360
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,500
left by that third X-Men movie that they never made.

361
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,500
Yeah, anyway.

362
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,500
So, thank you very much for watching.

363
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,500

The next vote, because my website is down,

366
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,500
is going to be in my personal blog,

367
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,500
and you can vote for the next round right here,

368

and here are your options,

369
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,500
because, you know, October and Spoopy,

370
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,500
we're doing Universal Monsters.

371
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,500
So, here are the three.

372
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,500
Choose wisely.
