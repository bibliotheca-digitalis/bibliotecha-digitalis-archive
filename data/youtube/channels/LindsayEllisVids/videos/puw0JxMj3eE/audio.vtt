00:00.000 --> 00:08.500
Yay! I'm happy. So, the last vote for Loose Cannon was X-Men themed because I said so.

00:08.500 --> 00:16.800
And while it was really close, the closest I've had yet, in fact, my favorite X-Man, Kurt Wagner, won. Hooray!

00:16.800 --> 00:18.500
This is the Nightcrawler episode.

00:19.500 --> 00:25.500
Considering Nightcrawler's not one of the main X-Men that you see in, like, every fucking thing,

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
he's surprisingly popular because he is the best.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
Seriously, I don't have anything, like, deep to say about this character. He's just the best.

00:36.000 --> 00:44.000
In a franchise that is often dour and portentous and way too convoluted, Kurt Wagner is our beacon of light.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
He is not, like, nightcrawling in my skin. Most of the time.

00:49.500 --> 01:00.500
So, let's take a look at everybody's favorite acrobat-turned-superhero-turned-priest-turned-superhero-again, Kurt Wagner, Nightcrawler.

01:07.500 --> 01:11.500
The X-Men can be read as an allegory for basically any minority group.

01:11.500 --> 01:16.500
This was always the intent, but it would coalesce more significantly when we learn about Magneto's backstory

01:16.500 --> 01:21.000
as a prisoner of German concentration camps a few years after the series launched,

01:21.000 --> 01:29.000
and Xavier and Magneto eventually taking on what some would describe as a sort of Martin Luther King-Malcolm X dynamic,

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
with respect to their ideologies.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
I'm not gonna touch that one.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
There's something I need to tell you.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
By the time the movies came out, it had shifted more to a big gay allegory,

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
especially under the vision of director Bryan Singer.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
Have you tried not being a mutant?

01:46.000 --> 01:50.500
That one is a bit more on the nose, because unlike, say, a race allegory,

01:50.500 --> 01:53.500
you can't usually tell who's a mutant just by looking at them.

01:53.500 --> 01:59.500
Most of them can pass as normal, so to speak, but there are a few who cannot.

01:59.500 --> 02:04.500
Nightcrawler was created by artist Dave Cockrum super-originally in the 60s,

02:04.500 --> 02:11.500
but the X-Men version debuted in 1975 alongside Storm, Colossus, and Thunderbird, who died one issue later.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
Before Nightcrawler was an X-Men character, he was one of Cockrum's own creations,

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
a demon, and he acted like one, and he was a jerk.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
But then Cockrum made him an alien,

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
because his people were, like, the source of Earth's legends and mythologies about demons,

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
and eventually, when Marvel came a-knockin', a mutant.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
Kurt is usually described as being fuzzy.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
In some versions, he just has blue skin,

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
but usually it's taken to mean that he's, like, covered in this layer of, like,

02:39.000 --> 02:43.500
not so much, like, animal fur, like, beast, but, like, you know, fuzz.

02:43.500 --> 02:46.500
And then he also has normal human hair on top of that.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.500
He can teleport, but not very far.

02:49.500 --> 02:53.000
A couple of miles at the most, and always somewhere he's already been.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.500
I have to be able to see where I'm going, otherwise I could wind up inside a wall.

02:57.500 --> 03:01.500
But superpowers aside, the reason Kurt has remained so popular over the years as a character

03:01.500 --> 03:05.500
isn't his powers or the way that he looks, but really because of his personality.

03:05.500 --> 03:10.000
For a long time, Nightcrawler was the only member of the X-Men who couldn't pass for a non-mutant,

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
because, you know, Beast was not with the X-Men through basically all the 70s.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
He's also probably the most affable member of the team.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
He's flirtatious, he's chivalrous, he's playful.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.500
He uses swords, and he dresses like a pirate sometimes.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.500
He loves Errol Flynn movies.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.000
Even Wolverine likes him.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.500
He's just the best.

03:27.500 --> 03:31.500
And that persona is basically one giant coping mechanism.

03:31.500 --> 03:35.000
He states many times over in the comics that he knows people will be freaked out

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
by the way that he looks, so he anticipates this and goes out of his way to be chill about it,

03:39.000 --> 03:42.500
basically using his charms to overcome people's prejudices.

03:42.500 --> 03:47.500
Again, this worked a lot better when mutants were a relative rarity in the Marvel Universe

03:47.500 --> 03:52.500
and not basically like every other person you bump into while walking down Bleeker Street.

03:52.500 --> 03:59.000
As a baby, Kurt was adopted and raised by a Romani, uh, sorceress named Mergali,

03:59.000 --> 04:01.500
like every foundling in the Marvel Universe.

04:01.500 --> 04:04.500
She's off and on evil and basically makes no sense.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.000
We're not gonna talk about her.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.500
Originally, he was going to be Mystique's child by destiny.

04:09.500 --> 04:13.000
Mystique in the form of a dude impregnating Destiny.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.500
Despite their lesbian relationship being canon, Marvel was like,

04:16.500 --> 04:18.000
eh, no, no, no, no.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
So, um, he was originally the son of some German aristocrat named Count Wagner

04:24.000 --> 04:27.500
or Baron Von Wagner or something.

04:27.500 --> 04:28.500
It changes.

04:28.500 --> 04:31.000
Given that Kurt has never actually met this guy,

04:31.000 --> 04:35.500
it's unclear as to why he didn't take Mergali's surname instead of

04:35.500 --> 04:38.500
biological dad Wagner's surname, but okay.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.500
Kurt basically macks on everybody.

04:40.500 --> 04:44.500
Again, this is probably somewhat a part of that coping mechanism thing

04:44.500 --> 04:47.500
until he up and decided, hey, I want to be a priest.

04:47.500 --> 04:48.500
We'll get to that.

04:48.500 --> 04:52.000
He is sometimes romantically paired with the occasional fellow X-Man,

04:52.000 --> 04:56.500
but the most consistent love interest is his adopted sister, Amanda Sefton.

04:56.500 --> 05:01.500
Kurt seems to be into Amanda when she's around.

05:01.500 --> 05:04.500
It'll be like, yay, you're back, you're the love of my life,

05:04.500 --> 05:06.500
and then she goes away for some reason,

05:06.500 --> 05:09.000
and then he gets over it and maybe dates someone else,

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
and then it's like, yay, you're back, you're the love of my life,

05:12.000 --> 05:14.500
and then she goes away for some reason.

05:14.500 --> 05:18.500
At the time of the recording, she literally just went away

05:18.500 --> 05:20.500
in the Nightcrawler series.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.500
Kurt is also Wolverine's best friend.

05:22.500 --> 05:25.500
So for all of Wolverine's relationships that matter,

05:25.500 --> 05:28.500
he's got Jean, who he wants or wanted,

05:28.500 --> 05:31.500
a small army of plucky female sidekicks,

05:31.500 --> 05:33.500
and Kurt, who he drinks beer with.

05:33.500 --> 05:38.500
And sometimes, well, that was a thing that happened

05:38.500 --> 05:41.500
from the first Nightcrawler miniseries, not the one that's going on now.

05:41.500 --> 05:46.500
And in the words of the artist, nobody at Marvel noticed.

05:46.500 --> 05:49.500
Cheeky, literally.

05:49.500 --> 05:52.500
Anyway, let's look at some of the adaptations.

05:53.500 --> 05:56.500
Pride of the X-Men, Pride with a Y,

05:56.500 --> 05:59.500
was a pilot for an unproduced X-Men animated series,

05:59.500 --> 06:02.500
and you can see why it was not meant to be.

06:02.500 --> 06:06.500
The animation quality is about on par with a Jim and the Holograms episode,

06:06.500 --> 06:09.500
and it is very Jim in style and in quality.

06:09.500 --> 06:12.500
Magneto is truly, truly outrageous.

06:12.500 --> 06:16.500
But the writing and acting was just not there.

06:16.500 --> 06:20.500
It is good, little one. Colossus like rain.

06:20.500 --> 06:23.500
This show follows Kitty Pryde when she first shows up at the Xavier School,

06:23.500 --> 06:26.500
and they are going for the playful, precocious Kurt

06:26.500 --> 06:29.500
and failing so beautifully.

06:29.500 --> 06:33.500
Ah, Fräulein, what a lovely vision you are.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.500
Please, allow me.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.500
That is literally their first interaction.

06:38.500 --> 06:39.500
Stranger danger.

06:39.500 --> 06:43.500
Fräulein, you left before I could properly welcome you.

06:43.500 --> 06:46.500
Stranger danger, Kitty. Stranger danger.

06:46.500 --> 06:51.500
This did happen in the comics, but it was way, way, way more low-key.

06:51.500 --> 06:55.500
Kurt was not stranger danger in the comic version of this.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.500
Until later, my child.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.500
Stranger danger, Kitty. Don't be alone in a room with him.

07:00.500 --> 07:04.500
They're trying to frame it like she's the unreasonable one,

07:04.500 --> 07:08.500
when he's just being like, ah, stop touching me.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.500
So that series didn't turn into a thing,

07:10.500 --> 07:14.500
but by the time we did get a real X-Men series a few years later,

07:14.500 --> 07:17.500
Kurt was not in the X-Men comics anymore.

07:17.500 --> 07:21.500
The X-Men all died or something, fake died.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.500
Anyway, so they're off the map,

07:23.500 --> 07:26.500
and Kurt and Kitty Pryde, who are by this point besties,

07:26.500 --> 07:29.500
they have a sad, but they go to England

07:29.500 --> 07:32.500
and start their own damn superhero group called Excalibur.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.500
And this series lasted for ten years.

07:34.500 --> 07:37.500
It was also one of those rare co-ed groups that had a female majority,

07:37.500 --> 07:41.500
at least for the first few years, and no one ever commented on it.

07:41.500 --> 07:44.500
Excalibur wasn't really much with the social issues.

07:44.500 --> 07:47.500
It was a much lighter adventure story thing.

07:47.500 --> 07:52.500
It was cute, it was fun, it dealt with a lot of universe hopping, and I loved it.

07:52.500 --> 07:55.500
This was all before Kurt really found God,

07:55.500 --> 07:59.500
because when he does come back to the X-Men, boom.

07:59.500 --> 08:04.500
Kurt being all Jesus-y is also an element in the animated series.

08:04.500 --> 08:07.500
Our ability to understand God's purpose is limited,

08:07.500 --> 08:11.500
but we take comfort in the fact that his love is limitless.

08:11.500 --> 08:14.500
Kurt only shows up in two episodes of this show,

08:14.500 --> 08:18.500
and it's kind of odd, considering he was one of the most popular X-Men characters,

08:18.500 --> 08:21.500
even though he wasn't in the main X-Men books at the time.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.500
He is a monk who dresses like that.

08:24.500 --> 08:27.500
The episode starts with him literally being chased

08:27.500 --> 08:31.500
by literal townsfolk with literal torches and pitchforks.

08:31.500 --> 08:35.500
Wolverine, Rogue, and Gambit, meanwhile, are on vacation?

08:35.500 --> 08:39.500
Yeah? Well, next time, plan your own darn vacation.

08:39.500 --> 08:42.500
Like, they seem like they're being forced into this vacation.

08:42.500 --> 08:46.500
And before you know it, the episode has turned into a conversation

08:46.500 --> 08:49.500
about Wolverine's personal relationship with Jesus Christ.

08:49.500 --> 08:53.500
I've tried. Don't you think I want that?

08:53.500 --> 08:56.500
Whoa, tone it down, Wolverine.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.500
Fortunately, even though the monastery burns down,

08:59.500 --> 09:01.500
what with the torches and pitchforks,

09:01.500 --> 09:04.500
the episode ends with the townsfolk getting over it

09:04.500 --> 09:06.500
and everybody gets along.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.500
But the most beautiful thing about this,

09:08.500 --> 09:11.500
the episode ends with Wolverine finding God.

09:11.500 --> 09:16.500
You comforted me. I will trust and will not be afraid.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.500
Yep.

09:20.500 --> 09:23.500
He pops up again in an episode where, so proper that X-Men was,

09:23.500 --> 09:26.500
we find out that everyone is related.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.500
They just want your brother!

09:28.500 --> 09:29.500
Huh?

09:29.500 --> 09:31.500
It's like how Magneto is everyone's father,

09:31.500 --> 09:33.500
while Mystique is everyone's mother.

09:33.500 --> 09:37.500
And Kurt, you are just so insufferably preachy in this series.

09:37.500 --> 09:40.500
Actually, I take it back. I'm glad you're only in two episodes.

09:40.500 --> 09:44.500
Why should you or your God care about me?

09:44.500 --> 09:47.500
As for God, he cares for all of us.

09:47.500 --> 09:50.500
But in the end, Mystique, despite being about to sell him out,

09:50.500 --> 09:54.500
does a bit of the old self-sacrifice, so I guess she's not all bad.

09:54.500 --> 09:58.500
And that's the last we see of him in this series.

09:58.500 --> 10:02.500
This was about the time in the comics when Kurt went from being, like,

10:03.500 --> 10:06.500
modestly, normal, you know, practicing Catholic,

10:06.500 --> 10:09.500
to, hey guys, I'mma be a priest.

10:09.500 --> 10:13.500
And everyone's like, weird, you never expressed interest in that before.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.500
Yeah, I did.

10:16.500 --> 10:19.500
This didn't come completely out of nowhere,

10:19.500 --> 10:24.500
but before this, the religious stuff was initially much more low-key.

10:24.500 --> 10:27.500
In one of his earlier comics, Wolverine walks in one day and sees Kurt praying,

10:27.500 --> 10:30.500
and he's like, hey, I didn't know you were religious.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.500
And Kurt's like, yep.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.500
And so, it was always there after that,

10:34.500 --> 10:37.500
but only insofar as Kurt appears to be, like, practicing Catholic,

10:37.500 --> 10:42.500
then with no motivating factor or ever showing prior interest in joining the priesthood.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.500
Priest.

10:44.500 --> 10:48.500
Somewhere along the line in the late 90s, he gets fully ordained offscreen somewhere.

10:48.500 --> 10:51.500
Never mind that that shit takes, you know, years.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.500
You know, it's kind of like becoming a doctor.

10:53.500 --> 10:55.500
Whatever, he's blue.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.500
This got retconned a few years after that,

10:57.500 --> 11:02.500
and I feel like I am one of the few X-Men fans who did not loathe

11:02.500 --> 11:07.500
the entirety of the infamous Chuck Austin run of Uncanny X-Men,

11:07.500 --> 11:11.500
but about the things that he did with Kurt.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.500
Number one was Holy War.

11:13.500 --> 11:17.500
See, turns out that Kurt never was ordained as a priest.

11:17.500 --> 11:20.500
Someone telepathically implanted it in his mind.

11:20.500 --> 11:23.500
Man, the trust issues people must have in this universe.

11:23.500 --> 11:27.500
Anyway, it's stupid, but the long and short is that there was this big conspiracy

11:27.500 --> 11:30.500
that wanted Kurt to eventually become the pope,

11:30.500 --> 11:36.500
and then they were going to use communion wafers to make all the Catholics in the world explode,

11:36.500 --> 11:39.500
and people would be like,

11:39.500 --> 11:43.500
ah, rapture, and then it would be revealed that Kurt looks the way he does,

11:43.500 --> 11:46.500
and then people were going to think he was the Antichrist,

11:46.500 --> 11:52.500
and this was all set in motion because there was a nun who got raped by a priest

11:52.500 --> 11:54.500
and wanted to murder all of the Catholics.

11:54.500 --> 11:57.500
You see why people didn't care much for this stretch?

11:57.500 --> 12:01.500
And then, of course, the other thing was the retcon of Kurt's origin story.

12:01.500 --> 12:07.500
During the Draco, we find out that Kurt's dad was this red motherfucker named Azazel.

12:07.500 --> 12:09.500
He's kind of the worst.

12:09.500 --> 12:12.500
Like, he's a demon mutant.

12:12.500 --> 12:16.500
A mutant in the way that Apocalypse is a mutant, I guess.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.500
Some kind of demon something,

12:18.500 --> 12:23.500
and he was just making babies all over the planet to help with his evil plan,

12:23.500 --> 12:25.500
and Kurt was one of them.

12:25.500 --> 12:29.500
Nope. Couldn't be enough that he happens to look like a demon.

12:29.500 --> 12:33.500
He's gotta be actual demon spawn.

12:33.500 --> 12:37.500
Then Chuck Austin went on the record in some interview and said that Kurt also has two dicks,

12:37.500 --> 12:39.500
because he's got two fingers.

12:39.500 --> 12:44.500
I heard that motherfucker had, like, 30 goddamn dicks.

12:44.500 --> 12:48.500
You know how, like, normal people have four fingers so they have four dicks?

12:49.500 --> 12:51.500
Okay, Chuck Austin.

12:51.500 --> 12:52.500
Buh-bye.

12:52.500 --> 12:55.500
We are right beside you, popcorn!

12:55.500 --> 13:00.500
X-Men Evolution showed us a more successful execution of what I think they were going for

13:00.500 --> 13:02.500
with Pride of the X-Men.

13:02.500 --> 13:05.500
He's not Stranger Danger here so much as overcompensating,

13:05.500 --> 13:08.500
socially awkward, but good-natured for an exchange student.

13:08.500 --> 13:11.500
Ah, she's fully not into the fuzzy dude.

13:11.500 --> 13:14.500
The characters are divided between teachers and students here.

13:14.500 --> 13:15.500
Kurt is one of the students.

13:15.500 --> 13:20.500
The show also keeps both the mystique-is-his-mom and the rogue-is-his-adoptive-sister angle.

13:20.500 --> 13:25.500
Amanda Sefton is here too, and thank God she is not his adoptive sister this time,

13:25.500 --> 13:26.500
so it's way less weird.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.500
Although it is still kind of weird.

13:28.500 --> 13:32.500
When you suddenly changed into...into something else,

13:32.500 --> 13:35.500
and then disappeared, I couldn't believe it!

13:35.500 --> 13:37.500
But I couldn't stop thinking about it.

13:37.500 --> 13:41.500
Your...your tail, your...didgeridoo-hind legs.

13:41.500 --> 13:44.500
All I knew was, I just had to get to know you.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.500
She sees his true self and thinks,

13:46.500 --> 13:48.500
hot, and not like,

13:48.500 --> 13:49.500
what?

13:49.500 --> 13:52.500
Anyway, this show is on the lighter side,

13:52.500 --> 13:56.500
younger, skewing, and probably the best of the X-Men cartoons,

13:56.500 --> 13:58.500
if only because it really holds to that whole

13:58.500 --> 14:00.500
school-for-mutants thing,

14:00.500 --> 14:02.500
instead of school-for-adults

14:02.500 --> 14:04.500
that train in the danger room all the time.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.500
Who the hell is this?

14:07.500 --> 14:10.500
But in the Munich Circus, I was known as the Incredible Nightcrawler.

14:10.500 --> 14:13.500
Kurt had a goodly-sized part in X2 X-Men United,

14:13.500 --> 14:14.500
played by Alan Cumming.

14:14.500 --> 14:17.500
The movie starts when he tries to kill the president

14:17.500 --> 14:19.500
in a scene that is just the best damn scene,

14:19.500 --> 14:21.500
under mind control, of course.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.500
He's...he's a cinnamon roll in this version.

14:23.500 --> 14:27.500
He's a bit shyer and more religious than in the comic incarnations,

14:27.500 --> 14:29.500
and the problem that a lot of people had with this version

14:29.500 --> 14:31.500
that it is too religious,

14:31.500 --> 14:34.500
to which I say, hey, the guy's just been under mind control.

14:34.500 --> 14:35.500
He's kind of freaked out.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.500
The praying doesn't bother me, that makes sense.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.500
The scarification...

14:40.500 --> 14:42.500
How many do you have?

14:42.500 --> 14:44.500
One for every sin.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.500
So quite a few.

14:46.500 --> 14:48.500
It's like cutting is cool when it's for Jesus.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.500
Which, again, would kind of make sense

14:50.500 --> 14:52.500
if you have a religious person who looks like him

14:52.500 --> 14:55.500
who's desperate to prove just how not a demon he is.

14:55.500 --> 14:57.500
Especially when you consider that at the end of the day,

14:57.500 --> 14:59.500
the character they're going for,

14:59.500 --> 15:02.500
he seems kind of just like a good-natured religious dude,

15:02.500 --> 15:05.500
not a self-flagellating scarification practitioner.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.500
It's even more flimsy when at the end of the day,

15:07.500 --> 15:11.500
the scars are there pretty much totally for aesthetic reasons.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.500
That said...

15:14.500 --> 15:16.500
F*** the haters.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.500
I love Alan Cumming, and I love this version,

15:18.500 --> 15:20.500
and I love this movie. This movie is so great.

15:20.500 --> 15:23.500
You know, he's nice, and he's shy, and sometimes mischievous,

15:23.500 --> 15:24.500
and often heroic.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.500
He's even kind of proud of his whole circus thing.

15:26.500 --> 15:29.500
But in the Munich circus, I was known as the incredible nightcrawler.

15:29.500 --> 15:30.500
Yes, save it.

15:30.500 --> 15:31.500
Aww.

15:31.500 --> 15:35.500
I feel like this was meant to be set up for that third X-Men movie

15:35.500 --> 15:37.500
that they never ended up making.

15:37.500 --> 15:40.500
Like, Kurt and Logan were going to learn to be friends,

15:40.500 --> 15:42.500
and that third X-Men movie, that didn't...

15:42.500 --> 15:43.500
Yep.

15:43.500 --> 15:47.500
Too bad they never made that third X-Men movie, huh?

15:50.500 --> 15:52.500
Welcome, mutants.

15:52.500 --> 15:56.500
For the I wish X-Men Evolution had been darker and grittier crowd,

15:56.500 --> 15:58.500
we have Wolverine and the X-Men.

15:58.500 --> 16:03.500
And this series assumes the audience has some familiarity with the material,

16:03.500 --> 16:06.500
because it starts after the X-Men have already disbanded.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.500
Xavier and Jean have disappeared,

16:08.500 --> 16:11.500
and Wolverine is trying to get the gang back together,

16:11.500 --> 16:14.500
and the plot for the whole season is ridiculously convoluted,

16:14.500 --> 16:16.500
so I'm not even going to bother.

16:16.500 --> 16:19.500
It's, like, all of the bad guys.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.500
All of them.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.500
You can tell this show skews older,

16:23.500 --> 16:26.500
because the male characters actually appear to have some human anatomy.

16:26.500 --> 16:29.500
I'm going to assume there's only one dick in there.

16:30.500 --> 16:33.500
Nightcrawler's off doing his own thing for the first half of the series,

16:33.500 --> 16:38.500
and during this period, we only see him in episodes where he is the main character.

16:38.500 --> 16:43.500
He ends up on Genosha, which is Magneto's totalitarian mutant-topia.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.500
And of course, things are not going so great over there,

16:45.500 --> 16:47.500
because, you know, Magneto's a little bit of a dictator,

16:47.500 --> 16:50.500
but he does kind of have, like, a little bit of a thing with the Scarlet Witch.

16:50.500 --> 16:52.500
Anyway, while he is gallant and heroic,

16:52.500 --> 16:55.500
he's also not much fun in this show, because nobody is.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.500
As always, there are alternate versions within the comics,

16:57.500 --> 17:00.500
although they have an odd consistency to them.

17:00.500 --> 17:03.500
We meet an alternate Nazi version in the Excalibur comics,

17:03.500 --> 17:05.500
who's a... rapist.

17:05.500 --> 17:10.500
And then there's an evil version in the Magic miniseries from the 80s,

17:10.500 --> 17:12.500
who's also...

17:12.500 --> 17:15.500
And then there's the version from the Ultimate Universe.

17:15.500 --> 17:18.500
Hello, darkness, my old friend.

17:18.500 --> 17:22.500
Well, he's obsessed with Dazzler, and kidnaps her at one point.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.500
He's also dark and gritty and really inconsistent, and nobody likes him.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.500
But he's dead now, so eh.

17:27.500 --> 17:31.500
Are there ultimate versions of characters that people actually like, besides Miles?

17:31.500 --> 17:34.500
And finally, because it was his turn, I guess,

17:34.500 --> 17:37.500
Nightcrawler died during one of those belabored,

17:37.500 --> 17:41.500
multi-issue series-spanning event crossovers that I hate.

17:41.500 --> 17:44.500
There is a living MacGuffin named Hope,

17:44.500 --> 17:47.500
and he dies saving her in a way that...

17:47.500 --> 17:49.500
I can't help but think, you know,

17:49.500 --> 17:52.500
he could have figured out something a little bit less, you know,

17:52.500 --> 17:54.500
martyr-y, but...

17:54.500 --> 17:55.500
Okay.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.500
X-Man down, you know the drill.

17:57.500 --> 18:00.500
Nightcrawler's only down for about two years before they bring him back.

18:00.500 --> 18:03.500
He's in heaven, and you know who shows back up?

18:03.500 --> 18:05.500
But that motherf***er Azazel.

18:05.500 --> 18:06.500
And you know what?

18:06.500 --> 18:11.500
If we must have a character as ridiculous as Azazel,

18:11.500 --> 18:14.500
he may as well be dressed like a pirate,

18:14.500 --> 18:17.500
and sailing a pirate ship around the afterlife,

18:17.500 --> 18:21.500
and commanding an army of demons in his quest to take over heaven,

18:21.500 --> 18:23.500
while dressed like a pirate.

18:23.500 --> 18:26.500
So, Nightcrawler's alive again.

18:26.500 --> 18:29.500
But I actually really like the series he was brought back in and stars in now.

18:29.500 --> 18:32.500
Not the this, but the this.

18:32.500 --> 18:35.500
Because it's fun, and it's like an adventure book,

18:35.500 --> 18:39.500
and it's not trying to do the ultimate gritty thing,

18:39.500 --> 18:41.500
and it retains that allegory,

18:41.500 --> 18:43.500
but it has fun with it, and it's well-written,

18:43.500 --> 18:45.500
and I dig it, keep, oh wait.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.500
Damn it, Secret Wars.

18:47.500 --> 18:51.500
And next year, get hype, because he's back, baby!

18:51.500 --> 18:52.500
Yay!

18:52.500 --> 18:53.500
Finally!

18:53.500 --> 18:55.500
He is played by this kid,

18:55.500 --> 18:57.500
and, um,

18:59.500 --> 19:01.500
when did he get started on those scars?

19:01.500 --> 19:03.500
He's like, 12.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.500
Anyway, well I'm so happy he's back,

19:05.500 --> 19:08.500
because there was a really big hole in my heart

19:08.500 --> 19:13.500
left by that third X-Men movie that they never made.

19:16.500 --> 19:17.500
Yeah, anyway.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.500
So, thank you very much for watching.

19:19.500 --> 19:22.500
If you like this show, you can support it on Patreon here,

19:22.500 --> 19:25.500
and of course you can follow me on Twitter.

19:25.500 --> 19:28.500
The next vote, because my website is down,

19:28.500 --> 19:30.500
is going to be in my personal blog,

19:30.500 --> 19:33.500
and you can vote for the next round right here,

19:33.500 --> 19:35.500
and here are your options,

19:35.500 --> 19:38.500
because, you know, October and Spoopy,

19:38.500 --> 19:41.500
we're doing Universal Monsters.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.500
So, here are the three.

19:43.500 --> 19:44.500
Choose wisely.
