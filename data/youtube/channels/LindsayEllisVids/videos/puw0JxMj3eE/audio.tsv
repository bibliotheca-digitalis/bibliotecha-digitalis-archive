0	8500	Yay! I'm happy. So, the last vote for Loose Cannon was X-Men themed because I said so.
8500	16800	And while it was really close, the closest I've had yet, in fact, my favorite X-Man, Kurt Wagner, won. Hooray!
16800	18500	This is the Nightcrawler episode.
19500	25500	Considering Nightcrawler's not one of the main X-Men that you see in, like, every fucking thing,
26000	30000	he's surprisingly popular because he is the best.
30000	36000	Seriously, I don't have anything, like, deep to say about this character. He's just the best.
36000	44000	In a franchise that is often dour and portentous and way too convoluted, Kurt Wagner is our beacon of light.
44000	49000	He is not, like, nightcrawling in my skin. Most of the time.
49500	60500	So, let's take a look at everybody's favorite acrobat-turned-superhero-turned-priest-turned-superhero-again, Kurt Wagner, Nightcrawler.
67500	71500	The X-Men can be read as an allegory for basically any minority group.
71500	76500	This was always the intent, but it would coalesce more significantly when we learn about Magneto's backstory
76500	81000	as a prisoner of German concentration camps a few years after the series launched,
81000	89000	and Xavier and Magneto eventually taking on what some would describe as a sort of Martin Luther King-Malcolm X dynamic,
89000	91000	with respect to their ideologies.
91000	93000	I'm not gonna touch that one.
93000	95000	There's something I need to tell you.
95000	99000	By the time the movies came out, it had shifted more to a big gay allegory,
99000	102000	especially under the vision of director Bryan Singer.
102000	106000	Have you tried not being a mutant?
106000	110500	That one is a bit more on the nose, because unlike, say, a race allegory,
110500	113500	you can't usually tell who's a mutant just by looking at them.
113500	119500	Most of them can pass as normal, so to speak, but there are a few who cannot.
119500	124500	Nightcrawler was created by artist Dave Cockrum super-originally in the 60s,
124500	131500	but the X-Men version debuted in 1975 alongside Storm, Colossus, and Thunderbird, who died one issue later.
132000	137000	Before Nightcrawler was an X-Men character, he was one of Cockrum's own creations,
137000	140000	a demon, and he acted like one, and he was a jerk.
140000	142000	But then Cockrum made him an alien,
142000	147000	because his people were, like, the source of Earth's legends and mythologies about demons,
147000	150000	and eventually, when Marvel came a-knockin', a mutant.
150000	153000	Kurt is usually described as being fuzzy.
153000	155000	In some versions, he just has blue skin,
155000	159000	but usually it's taken to mean that he's, like, covered in this layer of, like,
159000	163500	not so much, like, animal fur, like, beast, but, like, you know, fuzz.
163500	166500	And then he also has normal human hair on top of that.
167500	169500	He can teleport, but not very far.
169500	173000	A couple of miles at the most, and always somewhere he's already been.
173000	177500	I have to be able to see where I'm going, otherwise I could wind up inside a wall.
177500	181500	But superpowers aside, the reason Kurt has remained so popular over the years as a character
181500	185500	isn't his powers or the way that he looks, but really because of his personality.
185500	190000	For a long time, Nightcrawler was the only member of the X-Men who couldn't pass for a non-mutant,
190000	193000	because, you know, Beast was not with the X-Men through basically all the 70s.
193000	196000	He's also probably the most affable member of the team.
196000	199000	He's flirtatious, he's chivalrous, he's playful.
199000	202500	He uses swords, and he dresses like a pirate sometimes.
202500	204500	He loves Errol Flynn movies.
204500	206000	Even Wolverine likes him.
206000	207500	He's just the best.
207500	211500	And that persona is basically one giant coping mechanism.
211500	215000	He states many times over in the comics that he knows people will be freaked out
215000	219000	by the way that he looks, so he anticipates this and goes out of his way to be chill about it,
219000	222500	basically using his charms to overcome people's prejudices.
222500	227500	Again, this worked a lot better when mutants were a relative rarity in the Marvel Universe
227500	232500	and not basically like every other person you bump into while walking down Bleeker Street.
232500	239000	As a baby, Kurt was adopted and raised by a Romani, uh, sorceress named Mergali,
239000	241500	like every foundling in the Marvel Universe.
241500	244500	She's off and on evil and basically makes no sense.
244500	246000	We're not gonna talk about her.
246000	249500	Originally, he was going to be Mystique's child by destiny.
249500	253000	Mystique in the form of a dude impregnating Destiny.
253000	256500	Despite their lesbian relationship being canon, Marvel was like,
256500	258000	eh, no, no, no, no.
258000	264000	So, um, he was originally the son of some German aristocrat named Count Wagner
264000	267500	or Baron Von Wagner or something.
267500	268500	It changes.
268500	271000	Given that Kurt has never actually met this guy,
271000	275500	it's unclear as to why he didn't take Mergali's surname instead of
275500	278500	biological dad Wagner's surname, but okay.
278500	280500	Kurt basically macks on everybody.
280500	284500	Again, this is probably somewhat a part of that coping mechanism thing
284500	287500	until he up and decided, hey, I want to be a priest.
287500	288500	We'll get to that.
288500	292000	He is sometimes romantically paired with the occasional fellow X-Man,
292000	296500	but the most consistent love interest is his adopted sister, Amanda Sefton.
296500	301500	Kurt seems to be into Amanda when she's around.
301500	304500	It'll be like, yay, you're back, you're the love of my life,
304500	306500	and then she goes away for some reason,
306500	309000	and then he gets over it and maybe dates someone else,
309000	312000	and then it's like, yay, you're back, you're the love of my life,
312000	314500	and then she goes away for some reason.
314500	318500	At the time of the recording, she literally just went away
318500	320500	in the Nightcrawler series.
320500	322500	Kurt is also Wolverine's best friend.
322500	325500	So for all of Wolverine's relationships that matter,
325500	328500	he's got Jean, who he wants or wanted,
328500	331500	a small army of plucky female sidekicks,
331500	333500	and Kurt, who he drinks beer with.
333500	338500	And sometimes, well, that was a thing that happened
338500	341500	from the first Nightcrawler miniseries, not the one that's going on now.
341500	346500	And in the words of the artist, nobody at Marvel noticed.
346500	349500	Cheeky, literally.
349500	352500	Anyway, let's look at some of the adaptations.
353500	356500	Pride of the X-Men, Pride with a Y,
356500	359500	was a pilot for an unproduced X-Men animated series,
359500	362500	and you can see why it was not meant to be.
362500	366500	The animation quality is about on par with a Jim and the Holograms episode,
366500	369500	and it is very Jim in style and in quality.
369500	372500	Magneto is truly, truly outrageous.
372500	376500	But the writing and acting was just not there.
376500	380500	It is good, little one. Colossus like rain.
380500	383500	This show follows Kitty Pryde when she first shows up at the Xavier School,
383500	386500	and they are going for the playful, precocious Kurt
386500	389500	and failing so beautifully.
389500	393500	Ah, Fräulein, what a lovely vision you are.
393500	395500	Please, allow me.
395500	398500	That is literally their first interaction.
398500	399500	Stranger danger.
399500	403500	Fräulein, you left before I could properly welcome you.
403500	406500	Stranger danger, Kitty. Stranger danger.
406500	411500	This did happen in the comics, but it was way, way, way more low-key.
411500	415500	Kurt was not stranger danger in the comic version of this.
415500	417500	Until later, my child.
417500	420500	Stranger danger, Kitty. Don't be alone in a room with him.
420500	424500	They're trying to frame it like she's the unreasonable one,
424500	428500	when he's just being like, ah, stop touching me.
428500	430500	So that series didn't turn into a thing,
430500	434500	but by the time we did get a real X-Men series a few years later,
434500	437500	Kurt was not in the X-Men comics anymore.
437500	441500	The X-Men all died or something, fake died.
441500	443500	Anyway, so they're off the map,
443500	446500	and Kurt and Kitty Pryde, who are by this point besties,
446500	449500	they have a sad, but they go to England
449500	452500	and start their own damn superhero group called Excalibur.
452500	454500	And this series lasted for ten years.
454500	457500	It was also one of those rare co-ed groups that had a female majority,
457500	461500	at least for the first few years, and no one ever commented on it.
461500	464500	Excalibur wasn't really much with the social issues.
464500	467500	It was a much lighter adventure story thing.
467500	472500	It was cute, it was fun, it dealt with a lot of universe hopping, and I loved it.
472500	475500	This was all before Kurt really found God,
475500	479500	because when he does come back to the X-Men, boom.
479500	484500	Kurt being all Jesus-y is also an element in the animated series.
484500	487500	Our ability to understand God's purpose is limited,
487500	491500	but we take comfort in the fact that his love is limitless.
491500	494500	Kurt only shows up in two episodes of this show,
494500	498500	and it's kind of odd, considering he was one of the most popular X-Men characters,
498500	501500	even though he wasn't in the main X-Men books at the time.
501500	504500	He is a monk who dresses like that.
504500	507500	The episode starts with him literally being chased
507500	511500	by literal townsfolk with literal torches and pitchforks.
511500	515500	Wolverine, Rogue, and Gambit, meanwhile, are on vacation?
515500	519500	Yeah? Well, next time, plan your own darn vacation.
519500	522500	Like, they seem like they're being forced into this vacation.
522500	526500	And before you know it, the episode has turned into a conversation
526500	529500	about Wolverine's personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
529500	533500	I've tried. Don't you think I want that?
533500	536500	Whoa, tone it down, Wolverine.
536500	539500	Fortunately, even though the monastery burns down,
539500	541500	what with the torches and pitchforks,
541500	544500	the episode ends with the townsfolk getting over it
544500	546500	and everybody gets along.
546500	548500	But the most beautiful thing about this,
548500	551500	the episode ends with Wolverine finding God.
551500	556500	You comforted me. I will trust and will not be afraid.
558500	560500	Yep.
560500	563500	He pops up again in an episode where, so proper that X-Men was,
563500	566500	we find out that everyone is related.
566500	568500	They just want your brother!
568500	569500	Huh?
569500	571500	It's like how Magneto is everyone's father,
571500	573500	while Mystique is everyone's mother.
573500	577500	And Kurt, you are just so insufferably preachy in this series.
577500	580500	Actually, I take it back. I'm glad you're only in two episodes.
580500	584500	Why should you or your God care about me?
584500	587500	As for God, he cares for all of us.
587500	590500	But in the end, Mystique, despite being about to sell him out,
590500	594500	does a bit of the old self-sacrifice, so I guess she's not all bad.
594500	598500	And that's the last we see of him in this series.
598500	602500	This was about the time in the comics when Kurt went from being, like,
603500	606500	modestly, normal, you know, practicing Catholic,
606500	609500	to, hey guys, I'mma be a priest.
609500	613500	And everyone's like, weird, you never expressed interest in that before.
613500	615500	Yeah, I did.
616500	619500	This didn't come completely out of nowhere,
619500	624500	but before this, the religious stuff was initially much more low-key.
624500	627500	In one of his earlier comics, Wolverine walks in one day and sees Kurt praying,
627500	630500	and he's like, hey, I didn't know you were religious.
630500	632500	And Kurt's like, yep.
632500	634500	And so, it was always there after that,
634500	637500	but only insofar as Kurt appears to be, like, practicing Catholic,
637500	642500	then with no motivating factor or ever showing prior interest in joining the priesthood.
642500	644500	Priest.
644500	648500	Somewhere along the line in the late 90s, he gets fully ordained offscreen somewhere.
648500	651500	Never mind that that shit takes, you know, years.
651500	653500	You know, it's kind of like becoming a doctor.
653500	655500	Whatever, he's blue.
655500	657500	This got retconned a few years after that,
657500	662500	and I feel like I am one of the few X-Men fans who did not loathe
662500	667500	the entirety of the infamous Chuck Austin run of Uncanny X-Men,
667500	671500	but about the things that he did with Kurt.
671500	673500	Number one was Holy War.
673500	677500	See, turns out that Kurt never was ordained as a priest.
677500	680500	Someone telepathically implanted it in his mind.
680500	683500	Man, the trust issues people must have in this universe.
683500	687500	Anyway, it's stupid, but the long and short is that there was this big conspiracy
687500	690500	that wanted Kurt to eventually become the pope,
690500	696500	and then they were going to use communion wafers to make all the Catholics in the world explode,
696500	699500	and people would be like,
699500	703500	ah, rapture, and then it would be revealed that Kurt looks the way he does,
703500	706500	and then people were going to think he was the Antichrist,
706500	712500	and this was all set in motion because there was a nun who got raped by a priest
712500	714500	and wanted to murder all of the Catholics.
714500	717500	You see why people didn't care much for this stretch?
717500	721500	And then, of course, the other thing was the retcon of Kurt's origin story.
721500	727500	During the Draco, we find out that Kurt's dad was this red motherfucker named Azazel.
727500	729500	He's kind of the worst.
729500	732500	Like, he's a demon mutant.
732500	736500	A mutant in the way that Apocalypse is a mutant, I guess.
736500	738500	Some kind of demon something,
738500	743500	and he was just making babies all over the planet to help with his evil plan,
743500	745500	and Kurt was one of them.
745500	749500	Nope. Couldn't be enough that he happens to look like a demon.
749500	753500	He's gotta be actual demon spawn.
753500	757500	Then Chuck Austin went on the record in some interview and said that Kurt also has two dicks,
757500	759500	because he's got two fingers.
759500	764500	I heard that motherfucker had, like, 30 goddamn dicks.
764500	768500	You know how, like, normal people have four fingers so they have four dicks?
769500	771500	Okay, Chuck Austin.
771500	772500	Buh-bye.
772500	775500	We are right beside you, popcorn!
775500	780500	X-Men Evolution showed us a more successful execution of what I think they were going for
780500	782500	with Pride of the X-Men.
782500	785500	He's not Stranger Danger here so much as overcompensating,
785500	788500	socially awkward, but good-natured for an exchange student.
788500	791500	Ah, she's fully not into the fuzzy dude.
791500	794500	The characters are divided between teachers and students here.
794500	795500	Kurt is one of the students.
795500	800500	The show also keeps both the mystique-is-his-mom and the rogue-is-his-adoptive-sister angle.
800500	805500	Amanda Sefton is here too, and thank God she is not his adoptive sister this time,
805500	806500	so it's way less weird.
806500	808500	Although it is still kind of weird.
808500	812500	When you suddenly changed into...into something else,
812500	815500	and then disappeared, I couldn't believe it!
815500	817500	But I couldn't stop thinking about it.
817500	821500	Your...your tail, your...didgeridoo-hind legs.
821500	824500	All I knew was, I just had to get to know you.
824500	826500	She sees his true self and thinks,
826500	828500	hot, and not like,
828500	829500	what?
829500	832500	Anyway, this show is on the lighter side,
832500	836500	younger, skewing, and probably the best of the X-Men cartoons,
836500	838500	if only because it really holds to that whole
838500	840500	school-for-mutants thing,
840500	842500	instead of school-for-adults
842500	844500	that train in the danger room all the time.
844500	846500	Who the hell is this?
847500	850500	But in the Munich Circus, I was known as the Incredible Nightcrawler.
850500	853500	Kurt had a goodly-sized part in X2 X-Men United,
853500	854500	played by Alan Cumming.
854500	857500	The movie starts when he tries to kill the president
857500	859500	in a scene that is just the best damn scene,
859500	861500	under mind control, of course.
861500	863500	He's...he's a cinnamon roll in this version.
863500	867500	He's a bit shyer and more religious than in the comic incarnations,
867500	869500	and the problem that a lot of people had with this version
869500	871500	that it is too religious,
871500	874500	to which I say, hey, the guy's just been under mind control.
874500	875500	He's kind of freaked out.
875500	877500	The praying doesn't bother me, that makes sense.
877500	879500	The scarification...
880500	882500	How many do you have?
882500	884500	One for every sin.
884500	886500	So quite a few.
886500	888500	It's like cutting is cool when it's for Jesus.
888500	890500	Which, again, would kind of make sense
890500	892500	if you have a religious person who looks like him
892500	895500	who's desperate to prove just how not a demon he is.
895500	897500	Especially when you consider that at the end of the day,
897500	899500	the character they're going for,
899500	902500	he seems kind of just like a good-natured religious dude,
902500	905500	not a self-flagellating scarification practitioner.
905500	907500	It's even more flimsy when at the end of the day,
907500	911500	the scars are there pretty much totally for aesthetic reasons.
911500	913500	That said...
914500	916500	F*** the haters.
916500	918500	I love Alan Cumming, and I love this version,
918500	920500	and I love this movie. This movie is so great.
920500	923500	You know, he's nice, and he's shy, and sometimes mischievous,
923500	924500	and often heroic.
924500	926500	He's even kind of proud of his whole circus thing.
926500	929500	But in the Munich circus, I was known as the incredible nightcrawler.
929500	930500	Yes, save it.
930500	931500	Aww.
931500	935500	I feel like this was meant to be set up for that third X-Men movie
935500	937500	that they never ended up making.
937500	940500	Like, Kurt and Logan were going to learn to be friends,
940500	942500	and that third X-Men movie, that didn't...
942500	943500	Yep.
943500	947500	Too bad they never made that third X-Men movie, huh?
950500	952500	Welcome, mutants.
952500	956500	For the I wish X-Men Evolution had been darker and grittier crowd,
956500	958500	we have Wolverine and the X-Men.
958500	963500	And this series assumes the audience has some familiarity with the material,
963500	966500	because it starts after the X-Men have already disbanded.
966500	968500	Xavier and Jean have disappeared,
968500	971500	and Wolverine is trying to get the gang back together,
971500	974500	and the plot for the whole season is ridiculously convoluted,
974500	976500	so I'm not even going to bother.
976500	979500	It's, like, all of the bad guys.
979500	981500	All of them.
981500	983500	You can tell this show skews older,
983500	986500	because the male characters actually appear to have some human anatomy.
986500	989500	I'm going to assume there's only one dick in there.
990500	993500	Nightcrawler's off doing his own thing for the first half of the series,
993500	998500	and during this period, we only see him in episodes where he is the main character.
998500	1003500	He ends up on Genosha, which is Magneto's totalitarian mutant-topia.
1003500	1005500	And of course, things are not going so great over there,
1005500	1007500	because, you know, Magneto's a little bit of a dictator,
1007500	1010500	but he does kind of have, like, a little bit of a thing with the Scarlet Witch.
1010500	1012500	Anyway, while he is gallant and heroic,
1012500	1015500	he's also not much fun in this show, because nobody is.
1015500	1017500	As always, there are alternate versions within the comics,
1017500	1020500	although they have an odd consistency to them.
1020500	1023500	We meet an alternate Nazi version in the Excalibur comics,
1023500	1025500	who's a... rapist.
1025500	1030500	And then there's an evil version in the Magic miniseries from the 80s,
1030500	1032500	who's also...
1032500	1035500	And then there's the version from the Ultimate Universe.
1035500	1038500	Hello, darkness, my old friend.
1038500	1042500	Well, he's obsessed with Dazzler, and kidnaps her at one point.
1042500	1045500	He's also dark and gritty and really inconsistent, and nobody likes him.
1045500	1047500	But he's dead now, so eh.
1047500	1051500	Are there ultimate versions of characters that people actually like, besides Miles?
1051500	1054500	And finally, because it was his turn, I guess,
1054500	1057500	Nightcrawler died during one of those belabored,
1057500	1061500	multi-issue series-spanning event crossovers that I hate.
1061500	1064500	There is a living MacGuffin named Hope,
1064500	1067500	and he dies saving her in a way that...
1067500	1069500	I can't help but think, you know,
1069500	1072500	he could have figured out something a little bit less, you know,
1072500	1074500	martyr-y, but...
1074500	1075500	Okay.
1075500	1077500	X-Man down, you know the drill.
1077500	1080500	Nightcrawler's only down for about two years before they bring him back.
1080500	1083500	He's in heaven, and you know who shows back up?
1083500	1085500	But that motherf***er Azazel.
1085500	1086500	And you know what?
1086500	1091500	If we must have a character as ridiculous as Azazel,
1091500	1094500	he may as well be dressed like a pirate,
1094500	1097500	and sailing a pirate ship around the afterlife,
1097500	1101500	and commanding an army of demons in his quest to take over heaven,
1101500	1103500	while dressed like a pirate.
1103500	1106500	So, Nightcrawler's alive again.
1106500	1109500	But I actually really like the series he was brought back in and stars in now.
1109500	1112500	Not the this, but the this.
1112500	1115500	Because it's fun, and it's like an adventure book,
1115500	1119500	and it's not trying to do the ultimate gritty thing,
1119500	1121500	and it retains that allegory,
1121500	1123500	but it has fun with it, and it's well-written,
1123500	1125500	and I dig it, keep, oh wait.
1125500	1127500	Damn it, Secret Wars.
1127500	1131500	And next year, get hype, because he's back, baby!
1131500	1132500	Yay!
1132500	1133500	Finally!
1133500	1135500	He is played by this kid,
1135500	1137500	and, um,
1139500	1141500	when did he get started on those scars?
1141500	1143500	He's like, 12.
1143500	1145500	Anyway, well I'm so happy he's back,
1145500	1148500	because there was a really big hole in my heart
1148500	1153500	left by that third X-Men movie that they never made.
1156500	1157500	Yeah, anyway.
1157500	1159500	So, thank you very much for watching.
