1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
So, what's on the menu today?

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,320
Today we have a very special episode that I'm super excited about on both counts.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,760
Let's see, let's start with our libation today, which we haven't even poured yet.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,400
It's mainly because of this one reason here.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,400
Oh, yeah.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,220
Let me show you the audience at home.

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:27,540
It's because it's made by nerds, so hence we're obligated to drink this.

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,500
This is called Industry Standard Vodka.

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,460
The truth is, this was a gift from the people who make it.

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,060
They are some very nice, very cool people in Brooklyn, and this one's exciting to me.

11
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,660
I'm not normally a big vodka person.

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,060
You're supposed to drink it neat and chilled, which this is.

13
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,960
We planned ahead today.

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,780
And it's made with sugar beets with love and yeast and all sorts of fun things.

15
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,780
And it smells like nothing.

16
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,780
And super smooth.

17
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,780
I've had it before.

18
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,380
It's like ridiculously smooth.

19
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,380
Holy shit.

20
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,380
Yeah.

21
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,380
I'm not normally a vodka person.

22
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,380
I am not a vodka person either.

23
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,380
Well done.

24
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,260
I think sugar beets is where it's at.

25
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,260
Yeah.

26
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,260
The future is sugar beets.

27
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,820
The future of vodka.

28
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:15,420
If you're in the New York area, you can find it here, or you can order it maybe here, depending

29
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,420
on what state you live in.

30
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,420
You know how that is.

31
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,420
Cheers.

32
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,420
Let's begin.

33
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:31,100
This is a very special episode because, as you know, or at least our previous viewers,

34
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:37,140
we usually review things based on your suggestions, things that are already out, so you can read

35
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,480
along with us.

36
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,100
So today is a special one.

37
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,860
We are reviewing Lock In by John Scalzi.

38
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,420
Very exciting.

39
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,460
And this is one that has not come out yet.

40
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,540
So this will be an interesting episode because since it hasn't come out yet, we can't go

41
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:58,820
into very much depth about the plot and the who did what and the who killed who and the

42
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,780
what now.

43
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,580
So basically, we're going to split this one into two.

44
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,420
First half, we're going to give our broad impressions, who would like it, what we thought

45
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,180
about it, what the basic premise is, et cetera.

46
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:16,900
And then after the break, we are going to have a very mild spoilers discussion.

47
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,900
Deeper discussion.

48
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,500
Yeah, we won't be spoiling any plot elements, but we will talk about characters and style

49
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,500
choices and story decisions, stuff like that.

50
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:32,140
If you don't want extremely mild spoilers, then just, you know, keep the video in your

51
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,900
tabs, go out, get the book on August 26th, which is when it comes out, and then come

52
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,420
back and watch our video.

53
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,380
And then come back and watch part two.

54
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:47,140
So let's see, Lock In, a novel of the near future, basic premise is a new virus shows

55
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:53,060
up and creates a scenario where some people who catch the virus, their bodies just stop

56
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,060
working.

57
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,500
So they're what's called locked in, they're still in there, they're conscious, but their

58
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,020
bodies don't go.

59
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:07,540
Well, it examines what would happen in a society, especially in America, when 1% of your population

60
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,220
is in this locked in state, they are still there, they're still human, they're still

61
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,180
thinking, they cannot move, they cannot take care of themselves.

62
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,860
And a lot of government money subsidizes the care and development of technologies that

63
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:27,140
allow the locked in to integrate back into society.

64
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:31,260
And the solution, of course, is robots, basically.

65
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:36,820
And the main conflict at the beginning of the book is that a law has been passed by

66
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:44,900
the government that will no longer subsidize the care and cost of being a Hayden, or a

67
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,580
lock in sufferer.

68
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:51,020
So there is sabotage and intrigue from there.

69
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:56,420
Nella, what did you think of Lock In by John Scalzi?

70
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:03,980
I thought it was the kind of world building that is so well realized, it needs more than

71
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,980
one book.

72
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,780
And I'm the one sitting here complaining about a series, no more series.

73
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,260
And here I am sitting here being all like, oh God, it ended on a cliffhanger, not another

74
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,260
series.

75
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,260
I just wanted a standalone.

76
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,580
And then the standalone comes across and I'm like, this could have really worked if I was

77
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,580
a TV show.

78
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,580
Yeah.

79
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,460
And the funny thing is, there were a lot of elements about it that kind of reminded me

80
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,420
of, I believe, the now canceled show, Almost Human, that I watched and enjoyed.

81
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,620
But I always found it could have explored its own world much better.

82
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,980
And I feel like this did what Almost Human wanted to do, which was create the society

83
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:48,820
of haves and have-nots, and also of a different class structure that reflects upon really

84
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:56,180
our own, because it's sci-fi, and explores it really well, but leaves so much left to

85
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,580
still explore.

86
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,060
I agree completely.

87
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,660
Good night, everybody.

88
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:09,900
No, it's funny, because I mean, it was funny, because I was talking to some people, and

89
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:15,340
they're in publishing, and they had also read it, and it seemed to think it was a spoiler

90
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,340
the fact that it ends.

91
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:22,580
I was like, no, that would be in the promotional material, right?

92
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,340
But I was not expecting it to end.

93
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:31,140
I was like, 20 pages from the end, I'm like, surely, no, this isn't one.

94
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,140
Oh, I guess it is.

95
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,760
Can I just say one?

96
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,900
It has a great resolution.

97
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,860
I was so thoroughly entranced by its resolution.

98
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:48,740
It ended so neatly, because I found myself, because it was in the last, what, 20 pages

99
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,700
of the book, and I was getting that- The Shades of Grey?

100
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:58,060
The Shades of Grey, with the whole fear of, no, there's no way this will resolve itself,

101
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:03,320
or it's going to resolve itself really fast, and instead, it was just fast enough.

102
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,380
It's funny to mention Shades of Grey, because maybe it's because I read this right after

103
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:13,460
I read this, and I was kind of in that brain space of longing for death, because all world

104
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:22,100
building and no subsidence, so this was quite refreshing after Jasper Ford, where I longed

105
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,100
for death.

106
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:29,360
Well, one of its huge strengths was the characters, and it was a huge strength and a weakness,

107
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:36,060
because there's so much left to the imagination, and I feel like this is kind of a him thing,

108
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,780
You've never read any of Skullsy's books, right?

109
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,780
Not yet.

110
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,780
This is your first.

111
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,660
So that is definitely a thing with him, where it's kind of obvious that he has in his head

112
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:51,380
these giant character backstories with far reaching implications and sweeping motivations,

113
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:57,820
but there ends up being A, a cast of thousands, and B, a lot not on the page.

114
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:03,300
A lot just sort of like someone will show up and may or may not serve a plot point,

115
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:08,500
but they kind of have a lot that you don't see, which I guess maybe we're kind of used

116
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,860
to seeing, like the NaNoWriMo must put more words in all of the things.

117
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,860
Tigers.

118
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,860
Yeah.

119
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:22,220
I think I much prefer the, it could have been a series, but it stands alone.

120
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,700
That you actually leave your audience wanting more.

121
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,540
Well, I guess I kind of have mixed feelings about it, because I left this book kind of

122
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:34,780
feeling too much world for not enough book, because it is a very short book.

123
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,820
It is extremely, extremely zippy.

124
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:43,060
It was such a well-realized world, and there were a lot of things that were mentioned,

125
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,460
but barely explored.

126
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:56,100
To me, it kind of felt like a sci-fi examination of the struggle within the deaf community,

127
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:03,500
and the idea of there is a deaf culture, so stop trying to implant ocular devices into

128
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:09,900
our children's heads, because just because they're deaf doesn't mean they are disabled.

129
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:15,940
We have figured out a new way of being abled, and it's our culture, leave it alone.

130
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:21,980
The things that able-bodied people assume that other types of people are disabled when

131
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,780
maybe they may not see themselves that way, which there was one character in particular

132
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:31,780
that, speaking of things that weren't developed or explored, there was one character that

133
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:37,820
was mentioned a lot throughout the book, and only shows up at the very, very end, and was

134
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,140
another one of those things where, obviously, this has got to be a series, because this

135
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:47,740
character could have their own series, clearly just by hearing them describe, they were very

136
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,480
interesting, but they don't get a lot of screen time, or a lot of payoff.

137
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,360
But the thing is, a book that leaves you wanting more is still...

138
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,880
Still better than Longing for Death.

139
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,880
Longing for a Dead.

140
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,880
Longing for Death.

141
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:08,360
It's a very snappy tone, so it's not dour at all, it's a very light, almost sort of

142
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,360
mystery novel.

143
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,160
I would consider it a mystery novel.

144
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,200
And it also has the element of buddy comedy going on too, so that I always enjoy.

145
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Buddy Cop.

146
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,560
Yeah, the buddy cops that don't have the sex.

147
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
Oh, shocking.

148
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
Kind of shocking.

149
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,560
And also, like, I mean, this just cursed me, this wasn't even one that was suggested, guys,

150
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,760
and this is the first thing we've read with no romance in it.

151
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,760
Yay!

152
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,760
We found one!

153
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,760
We found it!

154
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,760
It exists!

155
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,760
Thank you, John Scruggs.

156
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,760
It only needed a man to write.

157
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:46,560
And not to be YA, we found one, it was like, we found the unicorn.

158
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,560
Anyway, so after the break, we're going to get into extremely, extremely mild spoilers,

159
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,560
but we were going to talk about stylistic stuff and story choices and theme and whatnot,

160
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,560
so if you want to wait until after you read the book, do that, and then come watch the

161
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,560
second half, or just join us now, and we're going to talk about this in comparison to

162
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,560
this.

163
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,560
Insular Regis.

164
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,560
Which everybody loved.

165
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,560
So let's talk spoilers.

166
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,560
Minor, minor spoilers.

167
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,560
Extremely minor spoilers.

168
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:22,560
I don't even know if I would consider this a spoiler so much as an experiment, a thought

169
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,560
experiment, which is why it reminded me of this, which was sort of like, speaking of

170
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,560
John Scalzi, he's just everywhere.

171
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,560
He has thoughts.

172
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,560
He has some thoughts to think.

173
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:40,560
I kind of can't help but wonder if this was a little bit, tiny bit inspired by this.

174
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,560
John Scalzi would like to weigh in.

175
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,560
This one was kind of remarkable in the way it deals with gender, specifically the main

176
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,560
character's gender, which we never really find out, which strictly speaking doesn't

177
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,560
exist because the main character is an AI, but she is in a body, like a human body, which

178
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,560
may or may not have a gender.

179
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:11,560
And the gender she was created in, all gender is referred to in the female.

180
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,560
Which, when you first read it, I mean when I first read it I was thinking, is this some

181
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,560
sort of Amazonian snooch here?

182
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,560
Planet of the ruled by women.

183
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,560
And Captain Riker's going to come in and he's going to take their mate Yaki down a peg.

184
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:31,560
But that could be fun, like the examination of the old sci-fi trope of the planet of Amazons

185
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,560
where they're all women and there are no men, but that wasn't the case.

186
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,560
It was just that there was one gender.

187
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,560
Why can't you gender?

188
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,560
And she's like, gender is hard!

189
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,560
I'm a ship.

190
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,560
Not all ships.

191
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:52,560
So in this one, the main character is never explicitly gendered.

192
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,560
And I think this was intentional.

193
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,560
So we kind of broke our rule a little and discussed this minorly beforehand, but you...

194
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,560
I gendered my own head, this character is male.

195
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560
Based on...

196
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,560
Well, two things.

197
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,560
His name is Chris.

198
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,560
No, his name is Chris and I have a brother named Chris.

199
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,560
So that tends to have some connotations in my head.

200
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:21,560
A friend of mine brought that up, my good friend who recommended me this, that she asked

201
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:27,560
me if I picked up on that and I said I did for about 25% of it because I think I was

202
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,560
maybe like 20-30 pages in when I was like, well, this character hasn't been gendered

203
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,560
and it's in the first person.

204
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,560
Maybe it's kind of going for this ancillary justice thing.

205
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:41,560
And I guess it was about maybe 25-30% through the book when I was like, no, it's a guy.

206
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,560
Because...

207
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,560
Think about being a woman.

208
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,560
Especially if you're a woman in a male-dominated field.

209
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,560
Especially if you turn out to be a famous person.

210
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,560
Yeah, especially if you're a famous woman.

211
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,560
Because that's the thing, you can assume that the Threeps are gender neutral or have

212
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:04,560
that option to be gender neutral, but our main character is kind of a famous person,

213
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,560
so everybody knows who they are.

214
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,560
Like I said, think about being a woman.

215
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,560
People like to remind you of it a lot.

216
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,560
And this is what they like to call microaggressions.

217
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,560
I work in post-production, motherfucker, and oh my god, I can't enter a room without someone

218
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,560
saying something.

219
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,560
I mean, it's usually a good joke, but it's just like, oh, there's a girl here, I guess

220
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
we're going to have to shower.

221
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,560
You know, stuff like that.

222
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,560
Just little tiny micro-aggressive things in the way language is used and the way you're

223
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,560
treated.

224
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,560
And this is near future.

225
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,560
This is super 20, 30, 40 years into the future.

226
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:44,560
But there's still a lot of the same problems in this future that like, you know, racism

227
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,560
and Second Amendment and gun nuts are still a thing.

228
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,560
Black men with guns is still a thing.

229
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,560
Black men with guns is still scary.

230
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,560
So I was like, I think, because I was talking to a friend about it and he's like, he asked

231
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,560
me if I thought that the premise was inherently flawed and I said no, because I think it worked

232
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:09,560
really well in Ancillary Justice, which has my vodka on it, which I have my vodka on.

233
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,560
But the thing about Ancillary Justice is it's not near future at all.

234
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,560
It's super not distant future.

235
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,560
Like planets, other species, distant future.

236
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,560
There's like aliens and shit, whereas this one is really, really near.

237
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:27,560
So I think like, it's not a flaw of the writing per se, but I think it is a flaw of the time

238
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,560
period that it's set in.

239
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,560
You know, it was an interesting idea.

240
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,560
I don't think it really works for so near into the future.

241
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,560
Well, the thing that, like once we started having this discussion and I realized that

242
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:46,560
I had gendered the character, but the cues I was picking up on were those things we discussed.

243
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,560
Like, I mean, aside from my own like, okay, who names Chris?

244
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,560
Like my brother.

245
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,560
Just how they're treated made me think, man.

246
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,560
Yeah, exactly.

247
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,560
I mean, like I think there's like, sort of like maybe if you're reading something in

248
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,560
the first person and it's a cop, you will default to it in a certain way.

249
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,560
But then there's other things.

250
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,560
But then there's the way that the characters treat the main character and they treat the

251
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,560
main character like he's a guy.

252
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,560
Well, us discussing it made me think of the whole Dumbledore is gay controversy because

253
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,560
J.K.

254
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,560
Rowling comes out after the fact and says, of course, Dumbledore is gay.

255
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,560
Like, that's how I imagined him.

256
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,560
And a lot of people went, well, Dumbledore is gay.

257
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,560
We have representation.

258
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,560
And then other people went in no way, shape or form in the book doesn't even hint at the

259
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,560
fact that he is gay.

260
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,560
He's not openly gay.

261
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,560
That doesn't do anyone a service at all.

262
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:39,560
And we're at the point in our society where the thought exercise is great, but we still

263
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:46,560
so desperately need obvious female characters, gay characters, pansexual characters, transgender

264
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,560
characters.

265
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:56,560
We need them because the given is still, there's still microaggressions and outright aggressions

266
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,560
towards not men.

267
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,560
And I think that's another thing about like, because this novel goes to such great lengths

268
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:10,560
to be realistic in the way the majority is often aggressive towards the minority, specifically

269
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,560
the Hadens and their Threeps.

270
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:18,560
Well, it also brings to mind, like, think of how non-Haden humans would react to Threeps

271
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,560
and the fact that you can't identify them right off the bat.

272
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,560
And could you imagine how angry some people would get at the fact that, what do you mean

273
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,560
I can't gender you just from seeing you?

274
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,560
People get angry about that just seeing the human face to face.

275
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:39,560
If they see someone who appears to be androgynous, that makes people still angry.

276
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,560
Yeah, definitely.

277
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,560
Violently angry if they misgender you.

278
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,560
Like you treat them.

279
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,560
And then it's your fault.

280
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,560
Yeah, and then it's your fault.

281
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:55,560
So for something so based in a near future examination of current issues, that was one

282
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,560
that felt a little sorely lacking, especially once...

283
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,560
Well, I think it was an interesting experiment.

284
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,560
I think that experiment worked a lot better in Ancillary Justice just because of the setting

285
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,560
and the fact that the setting did have to do with gender or lack thereof.

286
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:17,560
Whereas this one is just basically our world with robots and we still live in a very gendered

287
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,560
time.

288
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,560
And I think the idea that Hadens would look at gender differently makes perfect sense

289
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:27,560
because they don't have, they don't sex, they can't.

290
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,560
Fuck biology.

291
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,560
We can't.

292
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,560
We can't.

293
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,560
Or maybe they can, but it's never really explored in how the...

294
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,560
It becomes very cerebral.

295
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,560
Wow.

296
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,560
It becomes super cerebral.

297
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,560
And isn't that just what sex really is for humans?

298
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,560
Yeah.

299
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:49,560
So it would make sense that this group would kind of just reject this idea of gender altogether,

300
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,560
but that's not really addressed in this book.

301
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,560
Which again, this is too much world for not enough books.

302
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:00,560
So, I mean, if you're coming back and watching this video to get to the spoiler bit, and

303
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,560
you have read it, spoiler, comment below.

304
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,560
Let us, well, also I guess maybe spoiler tag your stuff.

305
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,560
After August 26?

306
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,560
After August 26.

307
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,560
But let's talk about this more.

308
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:19,560
Are we in an age where we still have to be explicit in our representation and how we

309
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,560
write our characters?

310
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,560
Now?

311
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,560
Now?

312
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,560
Yes, absolutely.

313
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,560
Okay.

314
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,560
That's not a question.

315
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,560
That's just a statement.

316
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,560
That's a statement now, absolutely.

317
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,560
And I feel like that doesn't mean that there's no room for thought experiments.

318
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,560
But I feel like they're sort of like when they do take place in basically our future,

319
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,560
they are kind of doomed to failure based on the fact that we know how people are treated

320
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,560
when they are a certain way.

321
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,560
Yeah.

322
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,560
Or even the whole thing with the integrators.

323
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:49,560
And integrators are people who are able to carry Hayden consciousnesses.

324
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,560
Yeah, so it's like rather than being in the robot body, they could actually be in a human

325
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,560
body.

326
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,560
And use the human body to experience.

327
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,560
Yeah.

328
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:02,560
Eat food and pee and go to Disney World and stuff like that.

329
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,560
Yeah.

330
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,560
And then the whole world of the integrators.

331
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,560
Like I said, there's a lot of books.

332
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,560
I know, there's so much books.

333
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,560
Incredibly tiny book.

334
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,560
The world is extremely, extremely integral to the plot.

335
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,560
I think it's kind of funny that we're reviewing this in a show called Boo's Your Own Adventure

336
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:25,560
because of our fun functioning alcoholic partner, the cop partner.

337
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,560
Oh, yeah.

338
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,560
Man who drinks because of her pain.

339
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,560
Because Leslie, her life has been hard.

340
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,560
Yeah, her life is hard.

341
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,560
So drinking.

342
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,560
I mean, I can't like, I did honestly like the idea that she's like, I didn't like it,

343
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,560
so I just would get drunk during my integration and then I could deal with it.

344
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,560
I'm like, yeah, no, that makes perfect sense.

345
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,560
I could, yeah, I could feel that.

346
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,560
Yeah.

347
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,560
Like, this makes me uncomfortable.

348
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,560
I'm just going to loosen myself up with a couple of drinks.

349
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:58,560
Because there's like, there is a sort of, she has a sort of antagonistic figure who

350
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,560
really hates her for some reason that we never really find out.

351
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,560
Why?

352
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,560
Aside from that, she's sloppy.

353
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,560
Aside from that, she's sloppy and drunk all the time.

354
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,560
Yeah.

355
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:13,560
And so there's sort of like a setup for like, she's really going to fail you.

356
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,560
And maybe the payoff is that she doesn't.

357
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:21,560
Yeah, but when I think about like, her tragic backstory and why she is as she is, I mean

358
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,560
that's, it's really just brought in.

359
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,560
Just as it's so real now.

360
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,560
You put the idea in your head of like, like that very thing she's always feared is exactly

361
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,560
what's happened.

362
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,560
Yeah.

363
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,560
I mean, well that's what you expect from like.

364
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,560
Yeah.

365
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,560
Like, well maybe if this is all right, fine, let's sit down and I'm going to tell you my

366
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,560
thing.

367
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,560
Yeah.

368
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,560
And I love how like the main character is like, are you sure you don't want to do this

369
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,560
later?

370
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,560
It's backstory time.

371
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,560
Are you sure?

372
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,560
Like, no, we're doing it now.

373
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,560
We've got like 50 pages of book left.

374
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,560
We got to go.

375
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,560
We got to get this over with.

376
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,560
I was pretty sure we discussed doing this once we solved the case and I put in my shut

377
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,560
up, sit down and telling you my thing.

378
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,560
Once we solved the case, the book is over.

379
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,560
We've got to do it now.

380
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,560
Right now.

381
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,560
Right the fuck now.

382
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,560
So that is Lock In by John Scalzi.

383
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,560
Like I said, I feel like we'd super recommend it.

384
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:09,560
Well no, I feel like we've barely scratched the surface of the book because there's so

385
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,560
much book for not a lot of book.

386
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
It's like 300 pages long.

387
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,560
It's so short.

388
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,560
Like it really did feel like a breath of fresh air after Shades of Grey, which really made

389
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,560
me long for death.

390
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:24,560
Um, in a lot of ways, because I feel like this is world building, uh, done really well

391
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,560
and engagingly.

392
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,560
Yeah.

393
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,560
Uh, like I feel like it's, that is, I think that is his gift there.

394
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,560
At least that is his strongest point is the fact that he is able to world build really

395
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,560
well.

396
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,560
It's based on like the, the ones that I've read.

397
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,560
And that was like, speaking of like, we're bitching about prologues, like he's like one

398
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,560
of the very few people I think that can do a prologue and it actually adds to something.

399
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,560
Like the prologue in this is just, it's just like two pages of, it's like a Wikipedia article.

400
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,560
Yeah.

401
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,560
In fact, it says it's on highschoolcheatsheet.com.

402
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,560
Yeah.

403
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,560
There we go.

404
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,560
Yeah.

405
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,560
I, I really liked that I had no romance.

406
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,560
I really liked the world building.

407
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,560
I wish there was more book in the book and I wish that the cast of thousands paid off

408
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,560
more.

409
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,560
Yeah.

410
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,560
Nella?

411
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,560
Um, hell, I have to agree to a lot of that.

412
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,560
It was a very fun read.

413
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:13,560
Um, like I said, it made me long for it to become a TV series or to replace the TV series

414
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,560
for like quite a while.

415
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,560
Well, he seems to be like, yeah, he seems to be doing well on that front.

416
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,560
Like, so who knows?

417
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,560
Give him a week.

418
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,560
He'll have like another like TV series number three.

419
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,560
I'm psyched.

420
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,560
Like we said, thank you so much for Zach at Industry Standards.

421
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,560
They make this lovely vodka distilled in, distilled in Brooklyn, New York.

422
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,560
It's probably not as chilled right now as it should be because this room is so hot.

423
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,560
Yeah, it is really hot.

424
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,560
It's made by two guys and a cat in Brooklyn.

425
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,560
Go to their website if you're interested in trying it.

426
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,560
It's very, very good.

427
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,560
And we say this is not vodka people.

428
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,560
Yeah.

429
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,560
Vodka is not my poison of choice.

430
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,560
And Lock In by John Scalzi goes on sale August 26th.

431
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,560
Pre-order that.

432
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,560
As always, please leave your comments, your thoughts on John Scalzi, Lock In and everything

433
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:59,560
on cheapocalypse.com or you can visit his website, which I believe is called whatever.

434
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,560
Damn your grab.

435
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,560
Damn you, sir.

436
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,560
And we will be very interested in hearing your thoughts.

437
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,560
Please, you know, after it comes out, read it, come back and share your thoughts, whether

438
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:16,560
you thought the gender thing worked or not, the payoff, cast of thousands, and of course

439
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,560
the lack of romance.

440
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,560
All of the thumbs up for that, sir.

441
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,560
We hate love.

442
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:25,560
I recommend this book solely for the fact there's no fucking romance.

443
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,560
There, two thumbs way, way up.

444
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,560
I feel like it's kind of like we had to have like an ungendered main character in order

445
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,560
to get that, but I'll take it.

446
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,560
Hey, you know what?

447
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,560
I'll take it.

448
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,560
Them what are starving.

449
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,560
Yeah, so anyway, this was a lot of fun.

450
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,560
Again, thank you so much for Zach at Industry Standard for his lovely vodka.

451
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,560
And thank you to John Scalzi for signing my book.

452
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,560
It's like a big G.

453
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,560
It kind of looks like the Star Trek symbol only.

454
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,560
It kind of does, which kind of works.

455
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,560
Anyway, so yeah, cheers.

456
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,560
Cheers.

457
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:11,560
I feel like Meg Ryan's 90s fat brunette sister.

458
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,560
Hey guys, so we forgot to mention one thing.

459
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,560
We need a book for next week.

460
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,560
Right, we need a book for the next episode.

461
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,560
Next week we're going to be outlining.

462
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,560
So, you have three options.

463
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,560
We're going to do multiple choice this time based on your suggestions.

464
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,560
Choose wisely.

465
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,560
And also this one that I happen to have.

466
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,560
E.

467
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,560
So this is a book that is already out.

468
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,560
This is called The Girl with All the Gifts.

469
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,560
This was given to me by a friend who works at Orbit,

470
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,560
which is a wonderful imprint.

471
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,560
They did ancillary justice.

472
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,560
And so our three options are going to be one,

473
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,560
the Kindle and Kylie Kardashian sister book that came in and gone.

474
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,560
City of something.

475
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,560
Colon something something.

476
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,560
Two, Save the Pearls.

477
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,560
And three, this.

478
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,560
I just want to remind everyone that I am currently two,

479
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:01,560
a prologue and two chapters deep in a recap of Tiger's Curse.

480
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,560
So, please keep in mind that if you pick a bad book,

481
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,560
I'm forced to read two at the same time.

482
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,560
So, those are three.

483
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,560
The Kardashian sister book, Save the Pearls, infamous as always.

484
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,560
And The Girl with All the Gifts, by all accounts a good book.

485
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,560
So, leave your suggestions in the comments.

486
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,560
Suggest this one.

487
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,560
And read along as always.

488
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,560
Good night.

489
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,560
Good night.
