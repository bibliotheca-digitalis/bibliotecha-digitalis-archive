WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.960
So, what's on the menu today?

00:05.960 --> 00:11.320
Today we have a very special episode that I'm super excited about on both counts.

00:11.320 --> 00:15.760
Let's see, let's start with our libation today, which we haven't even poured yet.

00:15.760 --> 00:17.400
It's mainly because of this one reason here.

00:17.400 --> 00:18.400
Oh, yeah.

00:18.400 --> 00:20.220
Let me show you the audience at home.

00:20.220 --> 00:27.540
It's because it's made by nerds, so hence we're obligated to drink this.

00:27.540 --> 00:29.500
This is called Industry Standard Vodka.

00:29.500 --> 00:33.460
The truth is, this was a gift from the people who make it.

00:33.460 --> 00:38.060
They are some very nice, very cool people in Brooklyn, and this one's exciting to me.

00:38.060 --> 00:39.660
I'm not normally a big vodka person.

00:39.660 --> 00:43.060
You're supposed to drink it neat and chilled, which this is.

00:43.060 --> 00:46.960
We planned ahead today.

00:46.960 --> 00:49.780
And it's made with sugar beets with love and yeast and all sorts of fun things.

00:49.780 --> 00:51.780
And it smells like nothing.

00:51.780 --> 00:52.780
And super smooth.

00:52.780 --> 00:53.780
I've had it before.

00:53.780 --> 00:57.380
It's like ridiculously smooth.

00:57.380 --> 00:58.380
Holy shit.

00:58.380 --> 00:59.380
Yeah.

00:59.380 --> 01:00.380
I'm not normally a vodka person.

01:00.380 --> 01:02.380
I am not a vodka person either.

01:02.380 --> 01:03.380
Well done.

01:03.380 --> 01:05.260
I think sugar beets is where it's at.

01:05.260 --> 01:06.260
Yeah.

01:06.260 --> 01:07.260
The future is sugar beets.

01:07.260 --> 01:08.820
The future of vodka.

01:08.820 --> 01:15.420
If you're in the New York area, you can find it here, or you can order it maybe here, depending

01:15.420 --> 01:16.420
on what state you live in.

01:16.420 --> 01:17.420
You know how that is.

01:17.420 --> 01:18.420
Cheers.

01:18.420 --> 01:19.420
Let's begin.

01:19.420 --> 01:31.100
This is a very special episode because, as you know, or at least our previous viewers,

01:31.100 --> 01:37.140
we usually review things based on your suggestions, things that are already out, so you can read

01:37.140 --> 01:38.480
along with us.

01:38.480 --> 01:40.100
So today is a special one.

01:40.100 --> 01:43.860
We are reviewing Lock In by John Scalzi.

01:43.860 --> 01:45.420
Very exciting.

01:45.420 --> 01:48.460
And this is one that has not come out yet.

01:48.500 --> 01:53.540
So this will be an interesting episode because since it hasn't come out yet, we can't go

01:53.540 --> 01:58.820
into very much depth about the plot and the who did what and the who killed who and the

01:58.820 --> 02:00.780
what now.

02:00.780 --> 02:04.580
So basically, we're going to split this one into two.

02:04.580 --> 02:08.420
First half, we're going to give our broad impressions, who would like it, what we thought

02:08.420 --> 02:11.180
about it, what the basic premise is, et cetera.

02:11.180 --> 02:16.900
And then after the break, we are going to have a very mild spoilers discussion.

02:16.900 --> 02:17.900
Deeper discussion.

02:18.340 --> 02:23.500
Yeah, we won't be spoiling any plot elements, but we will talk about characters and style

02:23.500 --> 02:26.500
choices and story decisions, stuff like that.

02:26.500 --> 02:32.140
If you don't want extremely mild spoilers, then just, you know, keep the video in your

02:32.140 --> 02:36.900
tabs, go out, get the book on August 26th, which is when it comes out, and then come

02:36.900 --> 02:39.420
back and watch our video.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.380
And then come back and watch part two.

02:41.380 --> 02:47.140
So let's see, Lock In, a novel of the near future, basic premise is a new virus shows

02:47.140 --> 02:53.060
up and creates a scenario where some people who catch the virus, their bodies just stop

02:53.060 --> 02:54.060
working.

02:54.060 --> 02:57.500
So they're what's called locked in, they're still in there, they're conscious, but their

02:57.500 --> 02:59.020
bodies don't go.

02:59.020 --> 03:07.540
Well, it examines what would happen in a society, especially in America, when 1% of your population

03:07.540 --> 03:12.220
is in this locked in state, they are still there, they're still human, they're still

03:12.220 --> 03:16.180
thinking, they cannot move, they cannot take care of themselves.

03:16.180 --> 03:21.860
And a lot of government money subsidizes the care and development of technologies that

03:21.860 --> 03:27.140
allow the locked in to integrate back into society.

03:27.140 --> 03:31.260
And the solution, of course, is robots, basically.

03:31.260 --> 03:36.820
And the main conflict at the beginning of the book is that a law has been passed by

03:36.820 --> 03:44.900
the government that will no longer subsidize the care and cost of being a Hayden, or a

03:44.900 --> 03:46.580
lock in sufferer.

03:46.580 --> 03:51.020
So there is sabotage and intrigue from there.

03:51.020 --> 03:56.420
Nella, what did you think of Lock In by John Scalzi?

03:56.420 --> 04:03.980
I thought it was the kind of world building that is so well realized, it needs more than

04:03.980 --> 04:04.980
one book.

04:04.980 --> 04:09.780
And I'm the one sitting here complaining about a series, no more series.

04:09.780 --> 04:14.260
And here I am sitting here being all like, oh God, it ended on a cliffhanger, not another

04:14.260 --> 04:15.260
series.

04:15.260 --> 04:16.260
I just wanted a standalone.

04:16.260 --> 04:20.580
And then the standalone comes across and I'm like, this could have really worked if I was

04:20.580 --> 04:21.580
a TV show.

04:21.580 --> 04:22.580
Yeah.

04:22.580 --> 04:26.460
And the funny thing is, there were a lot of elements about it that kind of reminded me

04:26.460 --> 04:30.420
of, I believe, the now canceled show, Almost Human, that I watched and enjoyed.

04:30.420 --> 04:34.620
But I always found it could have explored its own world much better.

04:34.620 --> 04:39.980
And I feel like this did what Almost Human wanted to do, which was create the society

04:39.980 --> 04:48.820
of haves and have-nots, and also of a different class structure that reflects upon really

04:48.820 --> 04:56.180
our own, because it's sci-fi, and explores it really well, but leaves so much left to

04:56.180 --> 04:57.580
still explore.

04:57.580 --> 05:00.060
I agree completely.

05:00.060 --> 05:02.660
Good night, everybody.

05:02.660 --> 05:09.900
No, it's funny, because I mean, it was funny, because I was talking to some people, and

05:09.900 --> 05:15.340
they're in publishing, and they had also read it, and it seemed to think it was a spoiler

05:15.340 --> 05:16.340
the fact that it ends.

05:16.340 --> 05:22.580
I was like, no, that would be in the promotional material, right?

05:22.580 --> 05:26.340
But I was not expecting it to end.

05:26.340 --> 05:31.140
I was like, 20 pages from the end, I'm like, surely, no, this isn't one.

05:31.140 --> 05:33.140
Oh, I guess it is.

05:33.140 --> 05:35.760
Can I just say one?

05:35.760 --> 05:37.900
It has a great resolution.

05:37.900 --> 05:41.860
I was so thoroughly entranced by its resolution.

05:41.860 --> 05:48.740
It ended so neatly, because I found myself, because it was in the last, what, 20 pages

05:48.740 --> 05:52.700
of the book, and I was getting that- The Shades of Grey?

05:52.700 --> 05:58.060
The Shades of Grey, with the whole fear of, no, there's no way this will resolve itself,

05:58.060 --> 06:03.320
or it's going to resolve itself really fast, and instead, it was just fast enough.

06:03.320 --> 06:07.380
It's funny to mention Shades of Grey, because maybe it's because I read this right after

06:07.380 --> 06:13.460
I read this, and I was kind of in that brain space of longing for death, because all world

06:13.460 --> 06:22.100
building and no subsidence, so this was quite refreshing after Jasper Ford, where I longed

06:22.100 --> 06:23.100
for death.

06:23.100 --> 06:29.360
Well, one of its huge strengths was the characters, and it was a huge strength and a weakness,

06:29.360 --> 06:36.060
because there's so much left to the imagination, and I feel like this is kind of a him thing,

06:36.280 --> 06:38.780
You've never read any of Skullsy's books, right?

06:38.780 --> 06:39.780
Not yet.

06:39.780 --> 06:40.780
This is your first.

06:40.780 --> 06:45.660
So that is definitely a thing with him, where it's kind of obvious that he has in his head

06:45.660 --> 06:51.380
these giant character backstories with far reaching implications and sweeping motivations,

06:51.380 --> 06:57.820
but there ends up being A, a cast of thousands, and B, a lot not on the page.

06:57.820 --> 07:03.300
A lot just sort of like someone will show up and may or may not serve a plot point,

07:03.300 --> 07:08.500
but they kind of have a lot that you don't see, which I guess maybe we're kind of used

07:08.500 --> 07:13.860
to seeing, like the NaNoWriMo must put more words in all of the things.

07:13.860 --> 07:14.860
Tigers.

07:14.860 --> 07:15.860
Yeah.

07:15.860 --> 07:22.220
I think I much prefer the, it could have been a series, but it stands alone.

07:22.220 --> 07:24.700
That you actually leave your audience wanting more.

07:24.700 --> 07:29.540
Well, I guess I kind of have mixed feelings about it, because I left this book kind of

07:29.540 --> 07:34.780
feeling too much world for not enough book, because it is a very short book.

07:34.780 --> 07:36.820
It is extremely, extremely zippy.

07:36.820 --> 07:43.060
It was such a well-realized world, and there were a lot of things that were mentioned,

07:43.060 --> 07:46.460
but barely explored.

07:46.460 --> 07:56.100
To me, it kind of felt like a sci-fi examination of the struggle within the deaf community,

07:56.100 --> 08:03.500
and the idea of there is a deaf culture, so stop trying to implant ocular devices into

08:03.500 --> 08:09.900
our children's heads, because just because they're deaf doesn't mean they are disabled.

08:09.900 --> 08:15.940
We have figured out a new way of being abled, and it's our culture, leave it alone.

08:15.940 --> 08:21.980
The things that able-bodied people assume that other types of people are disabled when

08:21.980 --> 08:25.780
maybe they may not see themselves that way, which there was one character in particular

08:25.780 --> 08:31.780
that, speaking of things that weren't developed or explored, there was one character that

08:31.780 --> 08:37.820
was mentioned a lot throughout the book, and only shows up at the very, very end, and was

08:37.820 --> 08:42.140
another one of those things where, obviously, this has got to be a series, because this

08:42.140 --> 08:47.740
character could have their own series, clearly just by hearing them describe, they were very

08:47.740 --> 08:52.480
interesting, but they don't get a lot of screen time, or a lot of payoff.

08:52.480 --> 08:55.360
But the thing is, a book that leaves you wanting more is still...

08:55.360 --> 08:58.880
Still better than Longing for Death.

08:58.880 --> 08:59.880
Longing for a Dead.

08:59.880 --> 09:00.880
Longing for Death.

09:00.880 --> 09:08.360
It's a very snappy tone, so it's not dour at all, it's a very light, almost sort of

09:08.360 --> 09:09.360
mystery novel.

09:09.360 --> 09:11.160
I would consider it a mystery novel.

09:11.160 --> 09:16.200
And it also has the element of buddy comedy going on too, so that I always enjoy.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.200
Buddy Cop.

09:17.200 --> 09:20.560
Yeah, the buddy cops that don't have the sex.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.560
Oh, shocking.

09:21.640 --> 09:22.640
Kind of shocking.

09:22.640 --> 09:27.560
And also, like, I mean, this just cursed me, this wasn't even one that was suggested, guys,

09:27.560 --> 09:30.760
and this is the first thing we've read with no romance in it.

09:30.760 --> 09:31.760
Yay!

09:31.760 --> 09:32.760
We found one!

09:32.760 --> 09:33.760
We found it!

09:33.760 --> 09:34.760
It exists!

09:34.760 --> 09:35.760
Thank you, John Scruggs.

09:35.760 --> 09:40.760
It only needed a man to write.

09:40.760 --> 09:46.560
And not to be YA, we found one, it was like, we found the unicorn.

09:46.560 --> 09:50.560
Anyway, so after the break, we're going to get into extremely, extremely mild spoilers,

09:50.560 --> 09:55.560
but we were going to talk about stylistic stuff and story choices and theme and whatnot,

09:55.560 --> 09:59.560
so if you want to wait until after you read the book, do that, and then come watch the

09:59.560 --> 10:04.560
second half, or just join us now, and we're going to talk about this in comparison to

10:04.560 --> 10:05.560
this.

10:05.560 --> 10:06.560
Insular Regis.

10:06.560 --> 10:07.560
Which everybody loved.

10:13.560 --> 10:15.560
So let's talk spoilers.

10:15.560 --> 10:16.560
Minor, minor spoilers.

10:16.560 --> 10:17.560
Extremely minor spoilers.

10:17.560 --> 10:22.560
I don't even know if I would consider this a spoiler so much as an experiment, a thought

10:22.560 --> 10:26.560
experiment, which is why it reminded me of this, which was sort of like, speaking of

10:26.560 --> 10:30.560
John Scalzi, he's just everywhere.

10:30.560 --> 10:31.560
He has thoughts.

10:31.560 --> 10:33.560
He has some thoughts to think.

10:33.560 --> 10:40.560
I kind of can't help but wonder if this was a little bit, tiny bit inspired by this.

10:41.560 --> 10:43.560
John Scalzi would like to weigh in.

10:50.560 --> 10:56.560
This one was kind of remarkable in the way it deals with gender, specifically the main

10:56.560 --> 11:00.560
character's gender, which we never really find out, which strictly speaking doesn't

11:00.560 --> 11:04.560
exist because the main character is an AI, but she is in a body, like a human body, which

11:04.560 --> 11:05.560
may or may not have a gender.

11:05.560 --> 11:11.560
And the gender she was created in, all gender is referred to in the female.

11:11.560 --> 11:16.560
Which, when you first read it, I mean when I first read it I was thinking, is this some

11:16.560 --> 11:18.560
sort of Amazonian snooch here?

11:18.560 --> 11:20.560
Planet of the ruled by women.

11:20.560 --> 11:25.560
And Captain Riker's going to come in and he's going to take their mate Yaki down a peg.

11:25.560 --> 11:31.560
But that could be fun, like the examination of the old sci-fi trope of the planet of Amazons

11:31.560 --> 11:35.560
where they're all women and there are no men, but that wasn't the case.

11:35.560 --> 11:37.560
It was just that there was one gender.

11:37.560 --> 11:38.560
Why can't you gender?

11:38.560 --> 11:41.560
And she's like, gender is hard!

11:41.560 --> 11:42.560
I'm a ship.

11:42.560 --> 11:44.560
Not all ships.

11:44.560 --> 11:52.560
So in this one, the main character is never explicitly gendered.

11:52.560 --> 11:54.560
And I think this was intentional.

11:54.560 --> 11:58.560
So we kind of broke our rule a little and discussed this minorly beforehand, but you...

11:59.560 --> 12:03.560
I gendered my own head, this character is male.

12:03.560 --> 12:04.560
Based on...

12:04.560 --> 12:06.560
Well, two things.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.560
His name is Chris.

12:08.560 --> 12:11.560
No, his name is Chris and I have a brother named Chris.

12:11.560 --> 12:15.560
So that tends to have some connotations in my head.

12:15.560 --> 12:21.560
A friend of mine brought that up, my good friend who recommended me this, that she asked

12:21.560 --> 12:27.560
me if I picked up on that and I said I did for about 25% of it because I think I was

12:27.560 --> 12:31.560
maybe like 20-30 pages in when I was like, well, this character hasn't been gendered

12:31.560 --> 12:32.560
and it's in the first person.

12:32.560 --> 12:35.560
Maybe it's kind of going for this ancillary justice thing.

12:35.560 --> 12:41.560
And I guess it was about maybe 25-30% through the book when I was like, no, it's a guy.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.560
Because...

12:43.560 --> 12:45.560
Think about being a woman.

12:45.560 --> 12:49.560
Especially if you're a woman in a male-dominated field.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.560
Especially if you turn out to be a famous person.

12:51.560 --> 12:54.560
Yeah, especially if you're a famous woman.

12:54.560 --> 12:58.560
Because that's the thing, you can assume that the Threeps are gender neutral or have

12:58.560 --> 13:04.560
that option to be gender neutral, but our main character is kind of a famous person,

13:04.560 --> 13:07.560
so everybody knows who they are.

13:07.560 --> 13:09.560
Like I said, think about being a woman.

13:09.560 --> 13:12.560
People like to remind you of it a lot.

13:12.560 --> 13:15.560
And this is what they like to call microaggressions.

13:15.560 --> 13:20.560
I work in post-production, motherfucker, and oh my god, I can't enter a room without someone

13:20.560 --> 13:21.560
saying something.

13:21.560 --> 13:24.560
I mean, it's usually a good joke, but it's just like, oh, there's a girl here, I guess

13:24.560 --> 13:26.560
we're going to have to shower.

13:26.560 --> 13:27.560
You know, stuff like that.

13:27.560 --> 13:31.560
Just little tiny micro-aggressive things in the way language is used and the way you're

13:31.560 --> 13:32.560
treated.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.560
And this is near future.

13:34.560 --> 13:37.560
This is super 20, 30, 40 years into the future.

13:37.560 --> 13:44.560
But there's still a lot of the same problems in this future that like, you know, racism

13:44.560 --> 13:48.560
and Second Amendment and gun nuts are still a thing.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.560
Black men with guns is still a thing.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.560
Black men with guns is still scary.

13:52.560 --> 13:58.560
So I was like, I think, because I was talking to a friend about it and he's like, he asked

13:58.560 --> 14:03.560
me if I thought that the premise was inherently flawed and I said no, because I think it worked

14:03.560 --> 14:09.560
really well in Ancillary Justice, which has my vodka on it, which I have my vodka on.

14:09.560 --> 14:12.560
But the thing about Ancillary Justice is it's not near future at all.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.560
It's super not distant future.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.560
Like planets, other species, distant future.

14:17.560 --> 14:20.560
There's like aliens and shit, whereas this one is really, really near.

14:20.560 --> 14:27.560
So I think like, it's not a flaw of the writing per se, but I think it is a flaw of the time

14:27.560 --> 14:28.560
period that it's set in.

14:28.560 --> 14:30.560
You know, it was an interesting idea.

14:30.560 --> 14:34.560
I don't think it really works for so near into the future.

14:34.560 --> 14:39.560
Well, the thing that, like once we started having this discussion and I realized that

14:39.560 --> 14:46.560
I had gendered the character, but the cues I was picking up on were those things we discussed.

14:46.560 --> 14:49.560
Like, I mean, aside from my own like, okay, who names Chris?

14:49.560 --> 14:50.560
Like my brother.

14:50.560 --> 14:53.560
Just how they're treated made me think, man.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.560
Yeah, exactly.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.560
I mean, like I think there's like, sort of like maybe if you're reading something in

14:57.560 --> 15:02.560
the first person and it's a cop, you will default to it in a certain way.

15:02.560 --> 15:03.560
But then there's other things.

15:03.560 --> 15:06.560
But then there's the way that the characters treat the main character and they treat the

15:06.560 --> 15:08.560
main character like he's a guy.

15:08.560 --> 15:14.560
Well, us discussing it made me think of the whole Dumbledore is gay controversy because

15:14.560 --> 15:15.560
J.K.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.560
Rowling comes out after the fact and says, of course, Dumbledore is gay.

15:17.560 --> 15:19.560
Like, that's how I imagined him.

15:19.560 --> 15:22.560
And a lot of people went, well, Dumbledore is gay.

15:22.560 --> 15:23.560
We have representation.

15:23.560 --> 15:27.560
And then other people went in no way, shape or form in the book doesn't even hint at the

15:27.560 --> 15:28.560
fact that he is gay.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.560
He's not openly gay.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.560
That doesn't do anyone a service at all.

15:32.560 --> 15:39.560
And we're at the point in our society where the thought exercise is great, but we still

15:39.560 --> 15:46.560
so desperately need obvious female characters, gay characters, pansexual characters, transgender

15:46.560 --> 15:47.560
characters.

15:47.560 --> 15:56.560
We need them because the given is still, there's still microaggressions and outright aggressions

15:56.560 --> 15:58.560
towards not men.

15:58.560 --> 16:03.560
And I think that's another thing about like, because this novel goes to such great lengths

16:03.560 --> 16:10.560
to be realistic in the way the majority is often aggressive towards the minority, specifically

16:10.560 --> 16:11.560
the Hadens and their Threeps.

16:11.560 --> 16:18.560
Well, it also brings to mind, like, think of how non-Haden humans would react to Threeps

16:18.560 --> 16:22.560
and the fact that you can't identify them right off the bat.

16:22.560 --> 16:27.560
And could you imagine how angry some people would get at the fact that, what do you mean

16:27.560 --> 16:29.560
I can't gender you just from seeing you?

16:29.560 --> 16:33.560
People get angry about that just seeing the human face to face.

16:33.560 --> 16:39.560
If they see someone who appears to be androgynous, that makes people still angry.

16:39.560 --> 16:40.560
Yeah, definitely.

16:40.560 --> 16:43.560
Violently angry if they misgender you.

16:43.560 --> 16:44.560
Like you treat them.

16:44.560 --> 16:45.560
And then it's your fault.

16:45.560 --> 16:46.560
Yeah, and then it's your fault.

16:46.560 --> 16:55.560
So for something so based in a near future examination of current issues, that was one

16:55.560 --> 16:58.560
that felt a little sorely lacking, especially once...

16:58.560 --> 17:01.560
Well, I think it was an interesting experiment.

17:01.560 --> 17:06.560
I think that experiment worked a lot better in Ancillary Justice just because of the setting

17:06.560 --> 17:11.560
and the fact that the setting did have to do with gender or lack thereof.

17:11.560 --> 17:17.560
Whereas this one is just basically our world with robots and we still live in a very gendered

17:17.560 --> 17:18.560
time.

17:18.560 --> 17:22.560
And I think the idea that Hadens would look at gender differently makes perfect sense

17:22.560 --> 17:27.560
because they don't have, they don't sex, they can't.

17:27.560 --> 17:28.560
Fuck biology.

17:28.560 --> 17:29.560
We can't.

17:29.560 --> 17:30.560
We can't.

17:30.560 --> 17:35.560
Or maybe they can, but it's never really explored in how the...

17:35.560 --> 17:37.560
It becomes very cerebral.

17:37.560 --> 17:38.560
Wow.

17:38.560 --> 17:39.560
It becomes super cerebral.

17:39.560 --> 17:42.560
And isn't that just what sex really is for humans?

17:42.560 --> 17:43.560
Yeah.

17:43.560 --> 17:49.560
So it would make sense that this group would kind of just reject this idea of gender altogether,

17:49.560 --> 17:51.560
but that's not really addressed in this book.

17:51.560 --> 17:55.560
Which again, this is too much world for not enough books.

17:55.560 --> 18:00.560
So, I mean, if you're coming back and watching this video to get to the spoiler bit, and

18:00.560 --> 18:04.560
you have read it, spoiler, comment below.

18:04.560 --> 18:07.560
Let us, well, also I guess maybe spoiler tag your stuff.

18:07.560 --> 18:08.560
After August 26?

18:08.560 --> 18:09.560
After August 26.

18:09.560 --> 18:12.560
But let's talk about this more.

18:12.560 --> 18:19.560
Are we in an age where we still have to be explicit in our representation and how we

18:19.560 --> 18:20.560
write our characters?

18:20.560 --> 18:21.560
Now?

18:21.560 --> 18:22.560
Now?

18:22.560 --> 18:23.560
Yes, absolutely.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.560
Okay.

18:24.560 --> 18:25.560
That's not a question.

18:25.560 --> 18:26.560
That's just a statement.

18:26.560 --> 18:27.560
That's a statement now, absolutely.

18:27.560 --> 18:31.560
And I feel like that doesn't mean that there's no room for thought experiments.

18:31.560 --> 18:35.560
But I feel like they're sort of like when they do take place in basically our future,

18:35.560 --> 18:38.560
they are kind of doomed to failure based on the fact that we know how people are treated

18:38.560 --> 18:40.560
when they are a certain way.

18:40.560 --> 18:41.560
Yeah.

18:41.560 --> 18:43.560
Or even the whole thing with the integrators.

18:43.560 --> 18:49.560
And integrators are people who are able to carry Hayden consciousnesses.

18:49.560 --> 18:52.560
Yeah, so it's like rather than being in the robot body, they could actually be in a human

18:52.560 --> 18:53.560
body.

18:53.560 --> 18:56.560
And use the human body to experience.

18:56.560 --> 18:57.560
Yeah.

18:57.560 --> 19:02.560
Eat food and pee and go to Disney World and stuff like that.

19:02.560 --> 19:03.560
Yeah.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.560
And then the whole world of the integrators.

19:06.560 --> 19:07.560
Like I said, there's a lot of books.

19:07.560 --> 19:08.560
I know, there's so much books.

19:08.560 --> 19:10.560
Incredibly tiny book.

19:10.560 --> 19:14.560
The world is extremely, extremely integral to the plot.

19:14.560 --> 19:18.560
I think it's kind of funny that we're reviewing this in a show called Boo's Your Own Adventure

19:18.560 --> 19:25.560
because of our fun functioning alcoholic partner, the cop partner.

19:25.560 --> 19:26.560
Oh, yeah.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.560
Man who drinks because of her pain.

19:28.560 --> 19:30.560
Because Leslie, her life has been hard.

19:30.560 --> 19:31.560
Yeah, her life is hard.

19:31.560 --> 19:32.560
So drinking.

19:32.560 --> 19:37.560
I mean, I can't like, I did honestly like the idea that she's like, I didn't like it,

19:37.560 --> 19:40.560
so I just would get drunk during my integration and then I could deal with it.

19:40.560 --> 19:43.560
I'm like, yeah, no, that makes perfect sense.

19:43.560 --> 19:45.560
I could, yeah, I could feel that.

19:45.560 --> 19:46.560
Yeah.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.560
Like, this makes me uncomfortable.

19:48.560 --> 19:51.560
I'm just going to loosen myself up with a couple of drinks.

19:51.560 --> 19:58.560
Because there's like, there is a sort of, she has a sort of antagonistic figure who

19:58.560 --> 20:01.560
really hates her for some reason that we never really find out.

20:01.560 --> 20:02.560
Why?

20:02.560 --> 20:03.560
Aside from that, she's sloppy.

20:03.560 --> 20:06.560
Aside from that, she's sloppy and drunk all the time.

20:06.560 --> 20:07.560
Yeah.

20:07.560 --> 20:13.560
And so there's sort of like a setup for like, she's really going to fail you.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.560
And maybe the payoff is that she doesn't.

20:15.560 --> 20:21.560
Yeah, but when I think about like, her tragic backstory and why she is as she is, I mean

20:21.560 --> 20:23.560
that's, it's really just brought in.

20:23.560 --> 20:24.560
Just as it's so real now.

20:24.560 --> 20:29.560
You put the idea in your head of like, like that very thing she's always feared is exactly

20:29.560 --> 20:30.560
what's happened.

20:30.560 --> 20:31.560
Yeah.

20:31.560 --> 20:32.560
I mean, well that's what you expect from like.

20:32.560 --> 20:33.560
Yeah.

20:33.560 --> 20:36.560
Like, well maybe if this is all right, fine, let's sit down and I'm going to tell you my

20:36.560 --> 20:37.560
thing.

20:37.560 --> 20:38.560
Yeah.

20:38.560 --> 20:41.560
And I love how like the main character is like, are you sure you don't want to do this

20:41.560 --> 20:42.560
later?

20:42.560 --> 20:43.560
It's backstory time.

20:43.560 --> 20:44.560
Are you sure?

20:44.560 --> 20:45.560
Like, no, we're doing it now.

20:45.560 --> 20:48.560
We've got like 50 pages of book left.

20:48.560 --> 20:49.560
We got to go.

20:49.560 --> 20:50.560
We got to get this over with.

20:50.560 --> 20:54.560
I was pretty sure we discussed doing this once we solved the case and I put in my shut

20:54.560 --> 20:55.560
up, sit down and telling you my thing.

20:55.560 --> 20:57.560
Once we solved the case, the book is over.

20:57.560 --> 20:58.560
We've got to do it now.

20:58.560 --> 20:59.560
Right now.

20:59.560 --> 21:00.560
Right the fuck now.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.560
So that is Lock In by John Scalzi.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.560
Like I said, I feel like we'd super recommend it.

21:04.560 --> 21:09.560
Well no, I feel like we've barely scratched the surface of the book because there's so

21:09.560 --> 21:11.560
much book for not a lot of book.

21:11.560 --> 21:12.560
It's like 300 pages long.

21:12.560 --> 21:13.560
It's so short.

21:13.560 --> 21:16.560
Like it really did feel like a breath of fresh air after Shades of Grey, which really made

21:16.560 --> 21:17.560
me long for death.

21:17.560 --> 21:24.560
Um, in a lot of ways, because I feel like this is world building, uh, done really well

21:24.560 --> 21:25.560
and engagingly.

21:25.560 --> 21:26.560
Yeah.

21:26.560 --> 21:29.560
Uh, like I feel like it's, that is, I think that is his gift there.

21:29.560 --> 21:33.560
At least that is his strongest point is the fact that he is able to world build really

21:33.560 --> 21:34.560
well.

21:34.560 --> 21:35.560
It's based on like the, the ones that I've read.

21:35.560 --> 21:38.560
And that was like, speaking of like, we're bitching about prologues, like he's like one

21:38.560 --> 21:43.560
of the very few people I think that can do a prologue and it actually adds to something.

21:43.560 --> 21:47.560
Like the prologue in this is just, it's just like two pages of, it's like a Wikipedia article.

21:47.560 --> 21:48.560
Yeah.

21:48.560 --> 21:50.560
In fact, it says it's on highschoolcheatsheet.com.

21:50.560 --> 21:51.560
Yeah.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.560
There we go.

21:52.560 --> 21:53.560
Yeah.

21:53.560 --> 21:54.560
I, I really liked that I had no romance.

21:54.560 --> 21:55.560
I really liked the world building.

21:55.560 --> 21:59.560
I wish there was more book in the book and I wish that the cast of thousands paid off

21:59.560 --> 22:00.560
more.

22:00.560 --> 22:01.560
Yeah.

22:01.560 --> 22:02.560
Nella?

22:02.560 --> 22:05.560
Um, hell, I have to agree to a lot of that.

22:05.560 --> 22:07.560
It was a very fun read.

22:07.560 --> 22:13.560
Um, like I said, it made me long for it to become a TV series or to replace the TV series

22:13.560 --> 22:14.560
for like quite a while.

22:14.560 --> 22:17.560
Well, he seems to be like, yeah, he seems to be doing well on that front.

22:17.560 --> 22:18.560
Like, so who knows?

22:18.560 --> 22:19.560
Give him a week.

22:19.560 --> 22:20.560
He'll have like another like TV series number three.

22:20.560 --> 22:21.560
I'm psyched.

22:21.560 --> 22:23.560
Like we said, thank you so much for Zach at Industry Standards.

22:23.560 --> 22:27.560
They make this lovely vodka distilled in, distilled in Brooklyn, New York.

22:27.560 --> 22:30.560
It's probably not as chilled right now as it should be because this room is so hot.

22:30.560 --> 22:31.560
Yeah, it is really hot.

22:31.560 --> 22:34.560
It's made by two guys and a cat in Brooklyn.

22:34.560 --> 22:36.560
Go to their website if you're interested in trying it.

22:36.560 --> 22:37.560
It's very, very good.

22:37.560 --> 22:39.560
And we say this is not vodka people.

22:39.560 --> 22:40.560
Yeah.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.560
Vodka is not my poison of choice.

22:42.560 --> 22:47.560
And Lock In by John Scalzi goes on sale August 26th.

22:47.560 --> 22:48.560
Pre-order that.

22:48.560 --> 22:53.560
As always, please leave your comments, your thoughts on John Scalzi, Lock In and everything

22:53.560 --> 22:59.560
on cheapocalypse.com or you can visit his website, which I believe is called whatever.

22:59.560 --> 23:02.560
Damn your grab.

23:02.560 --> 23:05.560
Damn you, sir.

23:05.560 --> 23:09.560
And we will be very interested in hearing your thoughts.

23:09.560 --> 23:12.560
Please, you know, after it comes out, read it, come back and share your thoughts, whether

23:12.560 --> 23:16.560
you thought the gender thing worked or not, the payoff, cast of thousands, and of course

23:16.560 --> 23:17.560
the lack of romance.

23:17.560 --> 23:20.560
All of the thumbs up for that, sir.

23:20.560 --> 23:21.560
We hate love.

23:21.560 --> 23:25.560
I recommend this book solely for the fact there's no fucking romance.

23:25.560 --> 23:27.560
There, two thumbs way, way up.

23:27.560 --> 23:31.560
I feel like it's kind of like we had to have like an ungendered main character in order

23:31.560 --> 23:34.560
to get that, but I'll take it.

23:34.560 --> 23:35.560
Hey, you know what?

23:35.560 --> 23:36.560
I'll take it.

23:36.560 --> 23:37.560
Them what are starving.

23:37.560 --> 23:39.560
Yeah, so anyway, this was a lot of fun.

23:39.560 --> 23:43.560
Again, thank you so much for Zach at Industry Standard for his lovely vodka.

23:43.560 --> 23:47.560
And thank you to John Scalzi for signing my book.

23:47.560 --> 23:50.560
It's like a big G.

23:50.560 --> 23:52.560
It kind of looks like the Star Trek symbol only.

23:52.560 --> 23:54.560
It kind of does, which kind of works.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.560
Anyway, so yeah, cheers.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.560
Cheers.

24:02.560 --> 24:11.560
I feel like Meg Ryan's 90s fat brunette sister.

24:11.560 --> 24:15.560
Hey guys, so we forgot to mention one thing.

24:15.560 --> 24:16.560
We need a book for next week.

24:16.560 --> 24:18.560
Right, we need a book for the next episode.

24:18.560 --> 24:19.560
Next week we're going to be outlining.

24:19.560 --> 24:21.560
So, you have three options.

24:21.560 --> 24:23.560
We're going to do multiple choice this time based on your suggestions.

24:23.560 --> 24:24.560
Choose wisely.

24:24.560 --> 24:25.560
And also this one that I happen to have.

24:25.560 --> 24:26.560
E.

24:26.560 --> 24:28.560
So this is a book that is already out.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.560
This is called The Girl with All the Gifts.

24:30.560 --> 24:33.560
This was given to me by a friend who works at Orbit,

24:33.560 --> 24:35.560
which is a wonderful imprint.

24:35.560 --> 24:37.560
They did ancillary justice.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.560
And so our three options are going to be one,

24:40.560 --> 24:44.560
the Kindle and Kylie Kardashian sister book that came in and gone.

24:44.560 --> 24:45.560
City of something.

24:45.560 --> 24:47.560
Colon something something.

24:47.560 --> 24:49.560
Two, Save the Pearls.

24:49.560 --> 24:51.560
And three, this.

24:51.560 --> 24:55.560
I just want to remind everyone that I am currently two,

24:55.560 --> 25:01.560
a prologue and two chapters deep in a recap of Tiger's Curse.

25:01.560 --> 25:04.560
So, please keep in mind that if you pick a bad book,

25:04.560 --> 25:07.560
I'm forced to read two at the same time.

25:07.560 --> 25:09.560
So, those are three.

25:09.560 --> 25:12.560
The Kardashian sister book, Save the Pearls, infamous as always.

25:12.560 --> 25:16.560
And The Girl with All the Gifts, by all accounts a good book.

25:16.560 --> 25:19.560
So, leave your suggestions in the comments.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.560
Suggest this one.

25:21.560 --> 25:23.560
And read along as always.

25:23.560 --> 25:24.560
Good night.

25:24.560 --> 25:25.560
Good night.
