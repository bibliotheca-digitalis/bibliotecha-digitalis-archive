0	5960	So, what's on the menu today?
5960	11320	Today we have a very special episode that I'm super excited about on both counts.
11320	15760	Let's see, let's start with our libation today, which we haven't even poured yet.
15760	17400	It's mainly because of this one reason here.
17400	18400	Oh, yeah.
18400	20220	Let me show you the audience at home.
20220	27540	It's because it's made by nerds, so hence we're obligated to drink this.
27540	29500	This is called Industry Standard Vodka.
29500	33460	The truth is, this was a gift from the people who make it.
33460	38060	They are some very nice, very cool people in Brooklyn, and this one's exciting to me.
38060	39660	I'm not normally a big vodka person.
39660	43060	You're supposed to drink it neat and chilled, which this is.
43060	46960	We planned ahead today.
46960	49780	And it's made with sugar beets with love and yeast and all sorts of fun things.
49780	51780	And it smells like nothing.
51780	52780	And super smooth.
52780	53780	I've had it before.
53780	57380	It's like ridiculously smooth.
57380	58380	Holy shit.
58380	59380	Yeah.
59380	60380	I'm not normally a vodka person.
60380	62380	I am not a vodka person either.
62380	63380	Well done.
63380	65260	I think sugar beets is where it's at.
65260	66260	Yeah.
66260	67260	The future is sugar beets.
67260	68820	The future of vodka.
68820	75420	If you're in the New York area, you can find it here, or you can order it maybe here, depending
75420	76420	on what state you live in.
76420	77420	You know how that is.
77420	78420	Cheers.
78420	79420	Let's begin.
79420	91100	This is a very special episode because, as you know, or at least our previous viewers,
91100	97140	we usually review things based on your suggestions, things that are already out, so you can read
97140	98480	along with us.
98480	100100	So today is a special one.
100100	103860	We are reviewing Lock In by John Scalzi.
103860	105420	Very exciting.
105420	108460	And this is one that has not come out yet.
108500	113540	So this will be an interesting episode because since it hasn't come out yet, we can't go
113540	118820	into very much depth about the plot and the who did what and the who killed who and the
118820	120780	what now.
120780	124580	So basically, we're going to split this one into two.
124580	128420	First half, we're going to give our broad impressions, who would like it, what we thought
128420	131180	about it, what the basic premise is, et cetera.
131180	136900	And then after the break, we are going to have a very mild spoilers discussion.
136900	137900	Deeper discussion.
138340	143500	Yeah, we won't be spoiling any plot elements, but we will talk about characters and style
143500	146500	choices and story decisions, stuff like that.
146500	152140	If you don't want extremely mild spoilers, then just, you know, keep the video in your
152140	156900	tabs, go out, get the book on August 26th, which is when it comes out, and then come
156900	159420	back and watch our video.
159420	161380	And then come back and watch part two.
161380	167140	So let's see, Lock In, a novel of the near future, basic premise is a new virus shows
167140	173060	up and creates a scenario where some people who catch the virus, their bodies just stop
173060	174060	working.
174060	177500	So they're what's called locked in, they're still in there, they're conscious, but their
177500	179020	bodies don't go.
179020	187540	Well, it examines what would happen in a society, especially in America, when 1% of your population
187540	192220	is in this locked in state, they are still there, they're still human, they're still
192220	196180	thinking, they cannot move, they cannot take care of themselves.
196180	201860	And a lot of government money subsidizes the care and development of technologies that
201860	207140	allow the locked in to integrate back into society.
207140	211260	And the solution, of course, is robots, basically.
211260	216820	And the main conflict at the beginning of the book is that a law has been passed by
216820	224900	the government that will no longer subsidize the care and cost of being a Hayden, or a
224900	226580	lock in sufferer.
226580	231020	So there is sabotage and intrigue from there.
231020	236420	Nella, what did you think of Lock In by John Scalzi?
236420	243980	I thought it was the kind of world building that is so well realized, it needs more than
243980	244980	one book.
244980	249780	And I'm the one sitting here complaining about a series, no more series.
249780	254260	And here I am sitting here being all like, oh God, it ended on a cliffhanger, not another
254260	255260	series.
255260	256260	I just wanted a standalone.
256260	260580	And then the standalone comes across and I'm like, this could have really worked if I was
260580	261580	a TV show.
261580	262580	Yeah.
262580	266460	And the funny thing is, there were a lot of elements about it that kind of reminded me
266460	270420	of, I believe, the now canceled show, Almost Human, that I watched and enjoyed.
270420	274620	But I always found it could have explored its own world much better.
274620	279980	And I feel like this did what Almost Human wanted to do, which was create the society
279980	288820	of haves and have-nots, and also of a different class structure that reflects upon really
288820	296180	our own, because it's sci-fi, and explores it really well, but leaves so much left to
296180	297580	still explore.
297580	300060	I agree completely.
300060	302660	Good night, everybody.
302660	309900	No, it's funny, because I mean, it was funny, because I was talking to some people, and
309900	315340	they're in publishing, and they had also read it, and it seemed to think it was a spoiler
315340	316340	the fact that it ends.
316340	322580	I was like, no, that would be in the promotional material, right?
322580	326340	But I was not expecting it to end.
326340	331140	I was like, 20 pages from the end, I'm like, surely, no, this isn't one.
331140	333140	Oh, I guess it is.
333140	335760	Can I just say one?
335760	337900	It has a great resolution.
337900	341860	I was so thoroughly entranced by its resolution.
341860	348740	It ended so neatly, because I found myself, because it was in the last, what, 20 pages
348740	352700	of the book, and I was getting that- The Shades of Grey?
352700	358060	The Shades of Grey, with the whole fear of, no, there's no way this will resolve itself,
358060	363320	or it's going to resolve itself really fast, and instead, it was just fast enough.
363320	367380	It's funny to mention Shades of Grey, because maybe it's because I read this right after
367380	373460	I read this, and I was kind of in that brain space of longing for death, because all world
373460	382100	building and no subsidence, so this was quite refreshing after Jasper Ford, where I longed
382100	383100	for death.
383100	389360	Well, one of its huge strengths was the characters, and it was a huge strength and a weakness,
389360	396060	because there's so much left to the imagination, and I feel like this is kind of a him thing,
396280	398780	You've never read any of Skullsy's books, right?
398780	399780	Not yet.
399780	400780	This is your first.
400780	405660	So that is definitely a thing with him, where it's kind of obvious that he has in his head
405660	411380	these giant character backstories with far reaching implications and sweeping motivations,
411380	417820	but there ends up being A, a cast of thousands, and B, a lot not on the page.
417820	423300	A lot just sort of like someone will show up and may or may not serve a plot point,
423300	428500	but they kind of have a lot that you don't see, which I guess maybe we're kind of used
428500	433860	to seeing, like the NaNoWriMo must put more words in all of the things.
433860	434860	Tigers.
434860	435860	Yeah.
435860	442220	I think I much prefer the, it could have been a series, but it stands alone.
442220	444700	That you actually leave your audience wanting more.
444700	449540	Well, I guess I kind of have mixed feelings about it, because I left this book kind of
449540	454780	feeling too much world for not enough book, because it is a very short book.
454780	456820	It is extremely, extremely zippy.
456820	463060	It was such a well-realized world, and there were a lot of things that were mentioned,
463060	466460	but barely explored.
466460	476100	To me, it kind of felt like a sci-fi examination of the struggle within the deaf community,
476100	483500	and the idea of there is a deaf culture, so stop trying to implant ocular devices into
483500	489900	our children's heads, because just because they're deaf doesn't mean they are disabled.
489900	495940	We have figured out a new way of being abled, and it's our culture, leave it alone.
495940	501980	The things that able-bodied people assume that other types of people are disabled when
501980	505780	maybe they may not see themselves that way, which there was one character in particular
505780	511780	that, speaking of things that weren't developed or explored, there was one character that
511780	517820	was mentioned a lot throughout the book, and only shows up at the very, very end, and was
517820	522140	another one of those things where, obviously, this has got to be a series, because this
522140	527740	character could have their own series, clearly just by hearing them describe, they were very
527740	532480	interesting, but they don't get a lot of screen time, or a lot of payoff.
532480	535360	But the thing is, a book that leaves you wanting more is still...
535360	538880	Still better than Longing for Death.
538880	539880	Longing for a Dead.
539880	540880	Longing for Death.
540880	548360	It's a very snappy tone, so it's not dour at all, it's a very light, almost sort of
548360	549360	mystery novel.
549360	551160	I would consider it a mystery novel.
551160	556200	And it also has the element of buddy comedy going on too, so that I always enjoy.
556200	557200	Buddy Cop.
557200	560560	Yeah, the buddy cops that don't have the sex.
560560	561560	Oh, shocking.
561640	562640	Kind of shocking.
562640	567560	And also, like, I mean, this just cursed me, this wasn't even one that was suggested, guys,
567560	570760	and this is the first thing we've read with no romance in it.
570760	571760	Yay!
571760	572760	We found one!
572760	573760	We found it!
573760	574760	It exists!
574760	575760	Thank you, John Scruggs.
575760	580760	It only needed a man to write.
580760	586560	And not to be YA, we found one, it was like, we found the unicorn.
586560	590560	Anyway, so after the break, we're going to get into extremely, extremely mild spoilers,
590560	595560	but we were going to talk about stylistic stuff and story choices and theme and whatnot,
595560	599560	so if you want to wait until after you read the book, do that, and then come watch the
599560	604560	second half, or just join us now, and we're going to talk about this in comparison to
604560	605560	this.
605560	606560	Insular Regis.
606560	607560	Which everybody loved.
613560	615560	So let's talk spoilers.
615560	616560	Minor, minor spoilers.
616560	617560	Extremely minor spoilers.
617560	622560	I don't even know if I would consider this a spoiler so much as an experiment, a thought
622560	626560	experiment, which is why it reminded me of this, which was sort of like, speaking of
626560	630560	John Scalzi, he's just everywhere.
630560	631560	He has thoughts.
631560	633560	He has some thoughts to think.
633560	640560	I kind of can't help but wonder if this was a little bit, tiny bit inspired by this.
641560	643560	John Scalzi would like to weigh in.
650560	656560	This one was kind of remarkable in the way it deals with gender, specifically the main
656560	660560	character's gender, which we never really find out, which strictly speaking doesn't
660560	664560	exist because the main character is an AI, but she is in a body, like a human body, which
664560	665560	may or may not have a gender.
665560	671560	And the gender she was created in, all gender is referred to in the female.
671560	676560	Which, when you first read it, I mean when I first read it I was thinking, is this some
676560	678560	sort of Amazonian snooch here?
678560	680560	Planet of the ruled by women.
680560	685560	And Captain Riker's going to come in and he's going to take their mate Yaki down a peg.
685560	691560	But that could be fun, like the examination of the old sci-fi trope of the planet of Amazons
691560	695560	where they're all women and there are no men, but that wasn't the case.
695560	697560	It was just that there was one gender.
697560	698560	Why can't you gender?
698560	701560	And she's like, gender is hard!
701560	702560	I'm a ship.
702560	704560	Not all ships.
704560	712560	So in this one, the main character is never explicitly gendered.
712560	714560	And I think this was intentional.
714560	718560	So we kind of broke our rule a little and discussed this minorly beforehand, but you...
719560	723560	I gendered my own head, this character is male.
723560	724560	Based on...
724560	726560	Well, two things.
726560	728560	His name is Chris.
728560	731560	No, his name is Chris and I have a brother named Chris.
731560	735560	So that tends to have some connotations in my head.
735560	741560	A friend of mine brought that up, my good friend who recommended me this, that she asked
741560	747560	me if I picked up on that and I said I did for about 25% of it because I think I was
747560	751560	maybe like 20-30 pages in when I was like, well, this character hasn't been gendered
751560	752560	and it's in the first person.
752560	755560	Maybe it's kind of going for this ancillary justice thing.
755560	761560	And I guess it was about maybe 25-30% through the book when I was like, no, it's a guy.
761560	763560	Because...
763560	765560	Think about being a woman.
765560	769560	Especially if you're a woman in a male-dominated field.
769560	771560	Especially if you turn out to be a famous person.
771560	774560	Yeah, especially if you're a famous woman.
774560	778560	Because that's the thing, you can assume that the Threeps are gender neutral or have
778560	784560	that option to be gender neutral, but our main character is kind of a famous person,
784560	787560	so everybody knows who they are.
787560	789560	Like I said, think about being a woman.
789560	792560	People like to remind you of it a lot.
792560	795560	And this is what they like to call microaggressions.
795560	800560	I work in post-production, motherfucker, and oh my god, I can't enter a room without someone
800560	801560	saying something.
801560	804560	I mean, it's usually a good joke, but it's just like, oh, there's a girl here, I guess
804560	806560	we're going to have to shower.
806560	807560	You know, stuff like that.
807560	811560	Just little tiny micro-aggressive things in the way language is used and the way you're
811560	812560	treated.
812560	814560	And this is near future.
814560	817560	This is super 20, 30, 40 years into the future.
817560	824560	But there's still a lot of the same problems in this future that like, you know, racism
824560	828560	and Second Amendment and gun nuts are still a thing.
828560	830560	Black men with guns is still a thing.
830560	832560	Black men with guns is still scary.
832560	838560	So I was like, I think, because I was talking to a friend about it and he's like, he asked
838560	843560	me if I thought that the premise was inherently flawed and I said no, because I think it worked
843560	849560	really well in Ancillary Justice, which has my vodka on it, which I have my vodka on.
849560	852560	But the thing about Ancillary Justice is it's not near future at all.
852560	854560	It's super not distant future.
854560	857560	Like planets, other species, distant future.
857560	860560	There's like aliens and shit, whereas this one is really, really near.
860560	867560	So I think like, it's not a flaw of the writing per se, but I think it is a flaw of the time
867560	868560	period that it's set in.
868560	870560	You know, it was an interesting idea.
870560	874560	I don't think it really works for so near into the future.
874560	879560	Well, the thing that, like once we started having this discussion and I realized that
879560	886560	I had gendered the character, but the cues I was picking up on were those things we discussed.
886560	889560	Like, I mean, aside from my own like, okay, who names Chris?
889560	890560	Like my brother.
890560	893560	Just how they're treated made me think, man.
893560	894560	Yeah, exactly.
894560	897560	I mean, like I think there's like, sort of like maybe if you're reading something in
897560	902560	the first person and it's a cop, you will default to it in a certain way.
902560	903560	But then there's other things.
903560	906560	But then there's the way that the characters treat the main character and they treat the
906560	908560	main character like he's a guy.
908560	914560	Well, us discussing it made me think of the whole Dumbledore is gay controversy because
914560	915560	J.K.
915560	917560	Rowling comes out after the fact and says, of course, Dumbledore is gay.
917560	919560	Like, that's how I imagined him.
919560	922560	And a lot of people went, well, Dumbledore is gay.
922560	923560	We have representation.
923560	927560	And then other people went in no way, shape or form in the book doesn't even hint at the
927560	928560	fact that he is gay.
928560	930560	He's not openly gay.
930560	932560	That doesn't do anyone a service at all.
932560	939560	And we're at the point in our society where the thought exercise is great, but we still
939560	946560	so desperately need obvious female characters, gay characters, pansexual characters, transgender
946560	947560	characters.
947560	956560	We need them because the given is still, there's still microaggressions and outright aggressions
956560	958560	towards not men.
958560	963560	And I think that's another thing about like, because this novel goes to such great lengths
963560	970560	to be realistic in the way the majority is often aggressive towards the minority, specifically
970560	971560	the Hadens and their Threeps.
971560	978560	Well, it also brings to mind, like, think of how non-Haden humans would react to Threeps
978560	982560	and the fact that you can't identify them right off the bat.
982560	987560	And could you imagine how angry some people would get at the fact that, what do you mean
987560	989560	I can't gender you just from seeing you?
989560	993560	People get angry about that just seeing the human face to face.
993560	999560	If they see someone who appears to be androgynous, that makes people still angry.
999560	1000560	Yeah, definitely.
1000560	1003560	Violently angry if they misgender you.
1003560	1004560	Like you treat them.
1004560	1005560	And then it's your fault.
1005560	1006560	Yeah, and then it's your fault.
1006560	1015560	So for something so based in a near future examination of current issues, that was one
1015560	1018560	that felt a little sorely lacking, especially once...
1018560	1021560	Well, I think it was an interesting experiment.
1021560	1026560	I think that experiment worked a lot better in Ancillary Justice just because of the setting
1026560	1031560	and the fact that the setting did have to do with gender or lack thereof.
1031560	1037560	Whereas this one is just basically our world with robots and we still live in a very gendered
1037560	1038560	time.
1038560	1042560	And I think the idea that Hadens would look at gender differently makes perfect sense
1042560	1047560	because they don't have, they don't sex, they can't.
1047560	1048560	Fuck biology.
1048560	1049560	We can't.
1049560	1050560	We can't.
1050560	1055560	Or maybe they can, but it's never really explored in how the...
1055560	1057560	It becomes very cerebral.
1057560	1058560	Wow.
1058560	1059560	It becomes super cerebral.
1059560	1062560	And isn't that just what sex really is for humans?
1062560	1063560	Yeah.
1063560	1069560	So it would make sense that this group would kind of just reject this idea of gender altogether,
1069560	1071560	but that's not really addressed in this book.
1071560	1075560	Which again, this is too much world for not enough books.
1075560	1080560	So, I mean, if you're coming back and watching this video to get to the spoiler bit, and
1080560	1084560	you have read it, spoiler, comment below.
1084560	1087560	Let us, well, also I guess maybe spoiler tag your stuff.
1087560	1088560	After August 26?
1088560	1089560	After August 26.
1089560	1092560	But let's talk about this more.
1092560	1099560	Are we in an age where we still have to be explicit in our representation and how we
1099560	1100560	write our characters?
1100560	1101560	Now?
1101560	1102560	Now?
1102560	1103560	Yes, absolutely.
1103560	1104560	Okay.
1104560	1105560	That's not a question.
1105560	1106560	That's just a statement.
1106560	1107560	That's a statement now, absolutely.
1107560	1111560	And I feel like that doesn't mean that there's no room for thought experiments.
1111560	1115560	But I feel like they're sort of like when they do take place in basically our future,
1115560	1118560	they are kind of doomed to failure based on the fact that we know how people are treated
1118560	1120560	when they are a certain way.
1120560	1121560	Yeah.
1121560	1123560	Or even the whole thing with the integrators.
1123560	1129560	And integrators are people who are able to carry Hayden consciousnesses.
1129560	1132560	Yeah, so it's like rather than being in the robot body, they could actually be in a human
1132560	1133560	body.
1133560	1136560	And use the human body to experience.
1136560	1137560	Yeah.
1137560	1142560	Eat food and pee and go to Disney World and stuff like that.
1142560	1143560	Yeah.
1143560	1146560	And then the whole world of the integrators.
1146560	1147560	Like I said, there's a lot of books.
1147560	1148560	I know, there's so much books.
1148560	1150560	Incredibly tiny book.
1150560	1154560	The world is extremely, extremely integral to the plot.
1154560	1158560	I think it's kind of funny that we're reviewing this in a show called Boo's Your Own Adventure
1158560	1165560	because of our fun functioning alcoholic partner, the cop partner.
1165560	1166560	Oh, yeah.
1166560	1168560	Man who drinks because of her pain.
1168560	1170560	Because Leslie, her life has been hard.
1170560	1171560	Yeah, her life is hard.
1171560	1172560	So drinking.
1172560	1177560	I mean, I can't like, I did honestly like the idea that she's like, I didn't like it,
1177560	1180560	so I just would get drunk during my integration and then I could deal with it.
1180560	1183560	I'm like, yeah, no, that makes perfect sense.
1183560	1185560	I could, yeah, I could feel that.
1185560	1186560	Yeah.
1186560	1188560	Like, this makes me uncomfortable.
1188560	1191560	I'm just going to loosen myself up with a couple of drinks.
1191560	1198560	Because there's like, there is a sort of, she has a sort of antagonistic figure who
1198560	1201560	really hates her for some reason that we never really find out.
1201560	1202560	Why?
1202560	1203560	Aside from that, she's sloppy.
1203560	1206560	Aside from that, she's sloppy and drunk all the time.
1206560	1207560	Yeah.
1207560	1213560	And so there's sort of like a setup for like, she's really going to fail you.
1213560	1215560	And maybe the payoff is that she doesn't.
1215560	1221560	Yeah, but when I think about like, her tragic backstory and why she is as she is, I mean
1221560	1223560	that's, it's really just brought in.
1223560	1224560	Just as it's so real now.
1224560	1229560	You put the idea in your head of like, like that very thing she's always feared is exactly
1229560	1230560	what's happened.
1230560	1231560	Yeah.
1231560	1232560	I mean, well that's what you expect from like.
1232560	1233560	Yeah.
1233560	1236560	Like, well maybe if this is all right, fine, let's sit down and I'm going to tell you my
1236560	1237560	thing.
1237560	1238560	Yeah.
1238560	1241560	And I love how like the main character is like, are you sure you don't want to do this
1241560	1242560	later?
1242560	1243560	It's backstory time.
1243560	1244560	Are you sure?
1244560	1245560	Like, no, we're doing it now.
1245560	1248560	We've got like 50 pages of book left.
1248560	1249560	We got to go.
1249560	1250560	We got to get this over with.
1250560	1254560	I was pretty sure we discussed doing this once we solved the case and I put in my shut
1254560	1255560	up, sit down and telling you my thing.
1255560	1257560	Once we solved the case, the book is over.
1257560	1258560	We've got to do it now.
1258560	1259560	Right now.
1259560	1260560	Right the fuck now.
1260560	1262560	So that is Lock In by John Scalzi.
1262560	1264560	Like I said, I feel like we'd super recommend it.
1264560	1269560	Well no, I feel like we've barely scratched the surface of the book because there's so
1269560	1271560	much book for not a lot of book.
1271560	1272560	It's like 300 pages long.
1272560	1273560	It's so short.
1273560	1276560	Like it really did feel like a breath of fresh air after Shades of Grey, which really made
1276560	1277560	me long for death.
1277560	1284560	Um, in a lot of ways, because I feel like this is world building, uh, done really well
1284560	1285560	and engagingly.
1285560	1286560	Yeah.
1286560	1289560	Uh, like I feel like it's, that is, I think that is his gift there.
1289560	1293560	At least that is his strongest point is the fact that he is able to world build really
1293560	1294560	well.
1294560	1295560	It's based on like the, the ones that I've read.
1295560	1298560	And that was like, speaking of like, we're bitching about prologues, like he's like one
1298560	1303560	of the very few people I think that can do a prologue and it actually adds to something.
1303560	1307560	Like the prologue in this is just, it's just like two pages of, it's like a Wikipedia article.
1307560	1308560	Yeah.
1308560	1310560	In fact, it says it's on highschoolcheatsheet.com.
1310560	1311560	Yeah.
1311560	1312560	There we go.
1312560	1313560	Yeah.
1313560	1314560	I, I really liked that I had no romance.
1314560	1315560	I really liked the world building.
1315560	1319560	I wish there was more book in the book and I wish that the cast of thousands paid off
1319560	1320560	more.
1320560	1321560	Yeah.
1321560	1322560	Nella?
1322560	1325560	Um, hell, I have to agree to a lot of that.
1325560	1327560	It was a very fun read.
1327560	1333560	Um, like I said, it made me long for it to become a TV series or to replace the TV series
1333560	1334560	for like quite a while.
1334560	1337560	Well, he seems to be like, yeah, he seems to be doing well on that front.
1337560	1338560	Like, so who knows?
1338560	1339560	Give him a week.
1339560	1340560	He'll have like another like TV series number three.
1340560	1341560	I'm psyched.
1341560	1343560	Like we said, thank you so much for Zach at Industry Standards.
1343560	1347560	They make this lovely vodka distilled in, distilled in Brooklyn, New York.
1347560	1350560	It's probably not as chilled right now as it should be because this room is so hot.
1350560	1351560	Yeah, it is really hot.
1351560	1354560	It's made by two guys and a cat in Brooklyn.
1354560	1356560	Go to their website if you're interested in trying it.
1356560	1357560	It's very, very good.
1357560	1359560	And we say this is not vodka people.
1359560	1360560	Yeah.
1360560	1362560	Vodka is not my poison of choice.
1362560	1367560	And Lock In by John Scalzi goes on sale August 26th.
1367560	1368560	Pre-order that.
1368560	1373560	As always, please leave your comments, your thoughts on John Scalzi, Lock In and everything
1373560	1379560	on cheapocalypse.com or you can visit his website, which I believe is called whatever.
1379560	1382560	Damn your grab.
1382560	1385560	Damn you, sir.
1385560	1389560	And we will be very interested in hearing your thoughts.
1389560	1392560	Please, you know, after it comes out, read it, come back and share your thoughts, whether
1392560	1396560	you thought the gender thing worked or not, the payoff, cast of thousands, and of course
1396560	1397560	the lack of romance.
1397560	1400560	All of the thumbs up for that, sir.
1400560	1401560	We hate love.
1401560	1405560	I recommend this book solely for the fact there's no fucking romance.
1405560	1407560	There, two thumbs way, way up.
1407560	1411560	I feel like it's kind of like we had to have like an ungendered main character in order
1411560	1414560	to get that, but I'll take it.
1414560	1415560	Hey, you know what?
1415560	1416560	I'll take it.
1416560	1417560	Them what are starving.
1417560	1419560	Yeah, so anyway, this was a lot of fun.
1419560	1423560	Again, thank you so much for Zach at Industry Standard for his lovely vodka.
1423560	1427560	And thank you to John Scalzi for signing my book.
1427560	1430560	It's like a big G.
1430560	1432560	It kind of looks like the Star Trek symbol only.
1432560	1434560	It kind of does, which kind of works.
1434560	1436560	Anyway, so yeah, cheers.
1436560	1437560	Cheers.
1442560	1451560	I feel like Meg Ryan's 90s fat brunette sister.
1451560	1455560	Hey guys, so we forgot to mention one thing.
1455560	1456560	We need a book for next week.
1456560	1458560	Right, we need a book for the next episode.
1458560	1459560	Next week we're going to be outlining.
1459560	1461560	So, you have three options.
1461560	1463560	We're going to do multiple choice this time based on your suggestions.
1463560	1464560	Choose wisely.
1464560	1465560	And also this one that I happen to have.
1465560	1466560	E.
1466560	1468560	So this is a book that is already out.
1468560	1470560	This is called The Girl with All the Gifts.
1470560	1473560	This was given to me by a friend who works at Orbit,
1473560	1475560	which is a wonderful imprint.
1475560	1477560	They did ancillary justice.
1477560	1480560	And so our three options are going to be one,
1480560	1484560	the Kindle and Kylie Kardashian sister book that came in and gone.
1484560	1485560	City of something.
1485560	1487560	Colon something something.
1487560	1489560	Two, Save the Pearls.
1489560	1491560	And three, this.
1491560	1495560	I just want to remind everyone that I am currently two,
1495560	1501560	a prologue and two chapters deep in a recap of Tiger's Curse.
1501560	1504560	So, please keep in mind that if you pick a bad book,
1504560	1507560	I'm forced to read two at the same time.
1507560	1509560	So, those are three.
1509560	1512560	The Kardashian sister book, Save the Pearls, infamous as always.
1512560	1516560	And The Girl with All the Gifts, by all accounts a good book.
1516560	1519560	So, leave your suggestions in the comments.
1519560	1521560	Suggest this one.
1521560	1523560	And read along as always.
1523560	1524560	Good night.
1524560	1525560	Good night.
