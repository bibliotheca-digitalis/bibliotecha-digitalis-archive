WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
So what are we drinking today? This is, uh...

00:03.000 --> 00:05.800
Um, I am drinking the Art of Whiskey.

00:05.800 --> 00:06.800
The Art of Whiskey.

00:06.800 --> 00:07.800
Goes with the Art of Wishing.

00:07.800 --> 00:08.800
Yes, it does.

00:08.800 --> 00:12.300
I'm on the fourth whiskey, which is why I can't brain today.

00:12.300 --> 00:12.800
It's fine.

00:12.800 --> 00:14.800
I'm on the I Wish I Were Drinking.

00:14.800 --> 00:15.800
The Wishful Drinking.

00:15.800 --> 00:16.800
The Wishful Drinking.

00:17.800 --> 00:18.800
It's lemonade.

00:18.800 --> 00:19.800
Pat, pat.

00:22.800 --> 00:24.800
But it's pink lemonade, so it's fine.

00:24.800 --> 00:26.800
It goes with the thing.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.800
This is our very special guest, Other Lindsey.

00:29.800 --> 00:34.800
So, Lindsey Rebar, who is a young adult author with Penguin.

00:34.800 --> 00:40.800
And she's released one book, her paperback of which is coming out the second week of June.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.800
That is The Art of Wishing.

00:43.800 --> 00:47.800
And her second book, The Fourth Wish, is coming out in July.

00:49.800 --> 00:50.800
It's so pink.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.800
And also, she is an agent with Brain.

00:53.800 --> 00:55.800
Sanford J. Greenberger Associates.

00:55.800 --> 01:02.800
She's a literary agent, so we'll talk a little bit about what the market for all you crazy kids who are looking to break in.

01:02.800 --> 01:05.800
So anyway, The Art of Wishing.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.800
Give us the elevator pitch.

01:07.800 --> 01:14.800
The Art of Wishing is about a high school senior, amateur singer-songwriter, and professional control freak named Margo McKenna

01:14.800 --> 01:22.800
who falls in love with a high school sophomore, amateur photographer, and professional genie named Oliver Parrish.

01:22.800 --> 01:30.800
And she discovers that she is the only person who can save her brand new genie boyfriend from his evil genie ex-boyfriend.

01:30.800 --> 01:31.800
Yeah.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.800
There's a stigma with paranormal romance.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.800
There's a lot of tropes.

01:36.800 --> 01:43.800
And as someone who is intelligent and educated and very well read...

01:43.800 --> 01:44.800
You heard it here first.

01:45.800 --> 01:46.800
Just basically perfect.

01:46.800 --> 01:47.800
Yeah.

01:47.800 --> 01:48.800
Well, she is a Lindsey, so...

01:48.800 --> 01:49.800
Well, that's true.

01:49.800 --> 01:54.800
How did you reconcile that with the negative stigma?

01:54.800 --> 02:00.800
Well, I think a lot of the negative stigma comes from the fact that there is this idea.

02:00.800 --> 02:02.800
I couldn't tell you where it came from.

02:02.800 --> 02:07.800
That all paranormal romance heroines...

02:07.800 --> 02:11.800
I mean, we're talking about specifically the kind where it's human girl, supernatural boy.

02:12.800 --> 02:17.800
There's this thing where the human girl always has to be this beaten down beta female

02:17.800 --> 02:25.800
who is just looking for a super-duper powerful guy to come in and probably save her from some evil that wouldn't exist

02:25.800 --> 02:27.800
if he hadn't come into her life in the first place.

02:27.800 --> 02:32.800
But I kind of wanted to turn that specifically on its head.

02:32.800 --> 02:36.800
I wanted a kind of thing where not only is it the girl who saves the boy at the end.

02:36.800 --> 02:37.800
Spoilers.

02:37.800 --> 02:42.800
It is kind of her that is in control of the relationship from the beginning.

02:42.800 --> 02:46.800
So not only is she the sort of alpha personality-wise,

02:46.800 --> 02:51.800
but she is inherently the alpha of the relationship because she is his master.

02:51.800 --> 02:55.800
And that comes with its own set of problems, and I had a lot of fun dealing with those.

02:55.800 --> 03:01.800
So genies by their very nature offer that opportunity as opposed to, you know, vampires or Cthulhu.

03:03.800 --> 03:04.800
What are you talking about?

03:05.800 --> 03:13.800
Well, a lot of those things that we ended up parodying were somewhat subverted in yours.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.800
I think more in the second one.

03:15.800 --> 03:16.800
Definitely more in the second one.

03:16.800 --> 03:24.800
Since that was the one that really deals with the implications of this, you know, dynamic, this master-slave magic.

03:24.800 --> 03:28.800
And the interesting thing about it, you know, you have the male genie who is in the subservient role,

03:28.800 --> 03:30.800
but in the second one you have female genie.

03:30.800 --> 03:34.800
And female genie being put in that role raises all kinds of other questions.

03:34.800 --> 03:40.800
You know, questions that come down to like, you know, sexual assault and consent and things that go really extreme.

03:40.800 --> 03:47.800
And having your male genie also be bisexual is something else that was really interesting.

03:47.800 --> 03:52.800
So yeah, at the end of the first book she makes a fourth wish to save Oliver,

03:52.800 --> 03:55.800
which means that she is trading her human life for another wish.

03:55.800 --> 04:00.800
She becomes a genie, and she knows in theory what that means going into it,

04:00.800 --> 04:02.800
being a shapeshifter, being bound to a master.

04:02.800 --> 04:09.800
But only when she actually tries to do the shapeshifting herself does she actually understand what that means.

04:09.800 --> 04:14.800
And there's a point where, spoilers, she turns into a boy for a very specific reason.

04:14.800 --> 04:20.800
And she has a moment where she's like, well, I still feel like a girl, but like I'm in a costume.

04:21.800 --> 04:25.800
So I got to bring up sort of the difference between sex and gender that way.

04:25.800 --> 04:29.800
These discussions of sex and gender and sexuality,

04:29.800 --> 04:33.800
how do you feel that you're fitting into that with the changing ways of the market?

04:33.800 --> 04:36.800
I think the market is definitely changing for the better.

04:36.800 --> 04:42.800
Every agent I know and every editor I know is actively looking for more LGBT characters

04:42.800 --> 04:46.800
where it's not just coming out 101 like, oh shit, I think I'm gay.

04:46.800 --> 04:48.800
I have to come out to my parents. How do I do it?

04:48.800 --> 04:50.800
And the entire plot is about that.

04:50.800 --> 04:53.800
And don't get me wrong, those definitely have their place.

04:53.800 --> 04:56.800
And they're important books, but there are so many of them at this point.

04:56.800 --> 05:03.800
It's equally as important to show people who live outside the privileged norm

05:03.800 --> 05:08.800
and just show them living their lives and having, you know, bigger problems

05:08.800 --> 05:10.800
than how to come out to your parents.

05:10.800 --> 05:16.800
I feel like, I don't know how much you'd consider the twilight parallel

05:16.800 --> 05:19.800
with the I become the thing for my boyfriend.

05:19.800 --> 05:20.800
Yeah.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.800
Was that intentional?

05:22.800 --> 05:25.800
Because I know a lot of the second book, and thank God,

05:25.800 --> 05:29.800
was kind of exploring the repercussions of that.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.800
So what was that modus operandi?

05:31.800 --> 05:38.800
So yeah, she's coming from a place where she has everything that she could logically want,

05:38.800 --> 05:43.800
but she has never been impulsive about anything,

05:43.800 --> 05:48.800
and she's never been emotionally stimulated to the point where she wants to do something

05:48.800 --> 05:50.800
for someone else instead of for herself.

05:50.800 --> 05:54.800
It's about the kind of person that she thinks she is choosing to be.

05:54.800 --> 05:57.800
It's a little bit about wanting to stay with Oliver,

05:57.800 --> 06:00.800
but it's mostly about trying to redefine herself.

06:00.800 --> 06:07.800
And in book two, that doesn't mean at all what she thinks it means when she actually does it.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.800
So she's this alpha female character.

06:09.800 --> 06:13.800
She's the one in control, and then in book two, she finds herself in the beta position.

06:13.800 --> 06:14.800
Exactly.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.800
For eternity, essentially, not even just the rest of her life,

06:16.800 --> 06:18.800
because now she's in the morning tuning.

06:18.800 --> 06:23.800
And because I had established her specifically as an alpha female,

06:23.800 --> 06:28.800
kind of in reaction to all those twilights and twilight knockoffs.

06:28.800 --> 06:33.800
So what's the most interesting thing you can do to a character

06:33.800 --> 06:35.800
who is so comfortable in their own life?

06:35.800 --> 06:40.800
Give them the most uncomfortable life position that they could possibly ever deal with

06:40.800 --> 06:41.800
and watch them deal with it.

06:41.800 --> 06:47.800
So, I mean, Oliver, the genie boyfriend, is kind of a natural submissive.

06:47.800 --> 06:48.800
He's the ultimate beta male.

06:48.800 --> 06:52.800
He loves people giving him orders in every sense of the word.

06:52.800 --> 06:56.800
She's going through all of these questions of, you know,

06:56.800 --> 06:58.800
how do I deal with being bossed around?

06:58.800 --> 07:02.800
Do I or do I not get to punch people in the face when they do things I don't like?

07:02.800 --> 07:07.800
And he doesn't really understand why it's not as easy for her as it is for him.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.800
Because what you were just saying kind of reminded me,

07:10.800 --> 07:12.800
I want to talk a little bit about, like, the process.

07:12.800 --> 07:19.800
You identify as what they call the pantser, meaning you don't outline.

07:19.800 --> 07:20.800
Right.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.800
And she and I are very, very adamant outliners.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.800
Is that Vogue?

07:25.800 --> 07:26.800
Why?

07:26.800 --> 07:28.800
That's my outline for this.

07:28.800 --> 07:31.800
Yes, must have, like, skeleton in place.

07:31.800 --> 07:32.800
Yeah, totally.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.800
So, like, wire reinforced.

07:34.800 --> 07:35.800
I mean, I know you're like skulls.

07:35.800 --> 07:38.800
I work from the bones.

07:38.800 --> 07:40.800
This does not shock me.

07:40.800 --> 07:44.800
Pantser means you write by the seat of your pants, by the way.

07:44.800 --> 07:45.800
That's what pantser means.

07:45.800 --> 07:46.800
Yes.

07:46.800 --> 07:50.800
I tried to outline the second book because I sold it on proposal,

07:50.800 --> 07:54.800
which meant that I didn't really do a traditional outline,

07:54.800 --> 07:55.800
like a chapter by chapter thing,

07:55.800 --> 08:00.800
but I did a list of things that might vaguely happen at some point

08:00.800 --> 08:03.800
or another more or less in book two.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.800
I tried to write to that, and it screwed me up,

08:05.800 --> 08:07.800
and it probably set me back by, like, six months

08:07.800 --> 08:11.800
because my favorite part of drafting is that I like to be surprised.

08:11.800 --> 08:14.800
There are points that I know I will hit, usually.

08:14.800 --> 08:15.800
Sometimes they change.

08:15.800 --> 08:16.800
Sometimes they don't.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.800
But when my characters discover something,

08:18.800 --> 08:21.800
usually the thing that makes the plot happen,

08:21.800 --> 08:23.800
I want to be surprised right along with them.

08:24.800 --> 08:26.800
But you were querying it in 2011,

08:26.800 --> 08:29.800
and so we talk a lot about, you know, like publishing,

08:29.800 --> 08:31.800
despite being so incredibly slow,

08:31.800 --> 08:34.800
like the market and the demand for everything changes so radically,

08:34.800 --> 08:37.800
like every single freaking year.

08:37.800 --> 08:41.800
Well, first off, you queried a paranormal romance in 2011

08:41.800 --> 08:44.800
when that thing was already kind of like, eh.

08:44.800 --> 08:47.800
So, yeah, that was not the first book that I queried.

08:47.800 --> 08:53.800
The first book was a thinly-veiled Harry Potter fanfic-type thing

08:53.800 --> 08:57.800
with a lot of werewolves and also forbidden magic.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.800
There was actually no kissing in my book,

08:59.800 --> 09:01.800
unless you count the adult's backstory,

09:01.800 --> 09:04.800
which I was trying to pull off Prisoner of Azkaban.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.800
It didn't work, surprisingly.

09:06.800 --> 09:08.800
So you queried that, and it didn't sell,

09:08.800 --> 09:13.800
and then when Art of Wishing came around, you were querying that.

09:13.800 --> 09:18.800
Yeah, so this one, I queried, I want to say, 20 or 30 agents,

09:18.800 --> 09:20.800
and I got no's across the board,

09:20.800 --> 09:25.800
including from Brenda Bowen, who works across the hall from me

09:25.800 --> 09:28.800
and is currently my agent.

09:28.800 --> 09:32.800
And I was just sending out wave after wave of queries,

09:32.800 --> 09:36.800
and eventually I got sick of it because I was sick of the book,

09:36.800 --> 09:40.800
and I also had this new idea that was, you know, genies, yay!

09:40.800 --> 09:42.800
So I focused on writing that instead

09:42.800 --> 09:47.800
and kind of let the spellcaster's wolf drop off.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.800
I know, I know, I know!

09:50.800 --> 09:54.800
Next question, why didn't you get an agent, Lindsay?

09:56.800 --> 10:01.800
No! I want a world with the spellcaster's wolf in it.

10:01.800 --> 10:04.800
You can't. You cannot have it.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.800
You say Brenda works across the hall from you.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.800
Where do you work?

10:09.800 --> 10:12.800
I am a literary agent by day,

10:12.800 --> 10:14.800
and I work at Sanford Greenberger Associates,

10:14.800 --> 10:17.800
which is a mid-sized agency downtown.

10:17.800 --> 10:22.800
Sanford Greenberger is an agency that's been around for over 70 years,

10:22.800 --> 10:25.800
and we've got Kafka, we've got The Little Prince,

10:25.800 --> 10:28.800
we've got Dan Brown, we've got a lot of fantasy

10:28.800 --> 10:31.800
and a lot of picture books and YA as well.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.800
But mostly kids' books.

10:33.800 --> 10:34.800
So here's a question.

10:34.800 --> 10:39.800
If Sarah Ellenson had queried you, straight up,

10:39.800 --> 10:42.800
what would your feel have been?

10:42.800 --> 10:44.800
My feel would have been,

10:44.800 --> 10:48.800
how long do I have to wait to post about this on Twitter

10:48.800 --> 10:51.800
without her finding out?

10:53.800 --> 10:56.800
Forever. She's a compulsive self-Googler, so you can never know.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.800
Oh, so she would have found out about it.

10:58.800 --> 11:01.800
And then she would have written an angry blog post about it.

11:02.800 --> 11:05.800
She would have gotten really mad at you.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.800
She would go on Goodreads.

11:07.800 --> 11:08.800
I know she has fans.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.800
Would you have been an appropriate agent for her to query?

11:11.800 --> 11:13.800
If she hadn't been...

11:13.800 --> 11:15.800
That depends on how she was...

11:15.800 --> 11:19.800
If she was querying it as a straight-up paranormal romance,

11:19.800 --> 11:22.800
no, because while I really like that genre,

11:22.800 --> 11:25.800
I'm not looking for it right now because it's not really selling.

11:25.800 --> 11:29.800
If she was querying it as a satire, then absolutely, yes.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.800
She doesn't know what satire means.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.800
That's the problem.

11:33.800 --> 11:35.800
That was one of our discussions.

11:35.800 --> 11:38.800
We'd actually kind of wished, in retrospect,

11:38.800 --> 11:40.800
that we'd made it more overtly satirical

11:40.800 --> 11:43.800
because the one publisher we did talk to was like,

11:43.800 --> 11:46.800
this is a little too subtle.

11:46.800 --> 11:49.800
It's Cthulhu. How is that subtle? Please tell me.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.800
He wanted it to be parody-parody.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.800
Like Nightlight.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.800
Which I liked. Poop jokes and that kind of thing.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.800
Which we wouldn't have wanted to do,

11:59.800 --> 12:01.800
but it could have been more satirical

12:01.800 --> 12:03.800
because a lot of people didn't follow through.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.800
Well, we don't want to talk about that.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.800
Anyway.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.800
Given how the market is changing very quickly,

12:09.800 --> 12:11.800
do you have any advice for people

12:11.800 --> 12:14.800
who may be thinking about querying within the next year or so?

12:14.800 --> 12:16.800
Yes, don't write to the market

12:16.800 --> 12:19.800
because as a reader, what you're seeing published yesterday

12:19.800 --> 12:23.800
are titles that sold usually one to three years ago.

12:23.800 --> 12:25.800
It is impossible to write to the market

12:25.800 --> 12:27.800
because once you're done with your awesome idea

12:27.800 --> 12:30.800
that you ripped off from Publisher's Marketplace yesterday,

12:30.800 --> 12:32.800
it'll be a month, six months, a year from now

12:32.800 --> 12:34.800
and that trend will already be over.

12:34.800 --> 12:37.800
So write what you love. Write the book that you want to read.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.800
So The Fourth Wish comes out in July.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.800
It comes out on July 31st, which is Harry Potter's birthday.

12:42.800 --> 12:45.800
Which is pretty much the only reason I remember my own birthday.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.800
Nerd! What?

12:47.800 --> 12:49.800
I don't know what you're talking about.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.800
I would be celebrating by...

12:51.800 --> 12:54.800
I just wanted to let everyone know how many skulls we moved

12:54.800 --> 12:56.800
in order to film this and it not be weird.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.800
This is my home, by the way.

12:58.800 --> 13:01.800
There are so many skulls, it's a little bit amazing.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.800
So many skulls offscreen right now.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.800
I got moved because we're talking about genies.

13:05.800 --> 13:09.800
It seems as time goes by and the internet gets more internet-y,

13:09.800 --> 13:12.800
it seems to be getting more and more difficult

13:12.800 --> 13:14.800
to make a living off of writing.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.800
Do you have anything to say to that?

13:16.800 --> 13:20.800
Especially, I guess, in relation to your own aspirations?

13:21.800 --> 13:23.800
Um...

13:23.800 --> 13:27.800
I'm still trying to figure out what my own aspirations are.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.800
Well, you'd just like to be able to make a living off writing, right?

13:30.800 --> 13:32.800
Yeah, I would like to, but I also like agenting.

13:32.800 --> 13:35.800
So, I mean, get a day job that you like

13:35.800 --> 13:39.800
and don't quit it until you are absolutely sure that you can.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.800
I get stuff like that too, where people are like,

13:41.800 --> 13:43.800
I want to quit my day job and do internet things.

13:43.800 --> 13:46.800
I want to do internet video, and it's like, it takes a while.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.800
Do internet video and then quit your day job.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.800
Save up a nest egg.

13:50.800 --> 13:53.800
Live off that while you're pursuing your artistic dreams.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.800
I mean, also figure out if it's something you definitely want to do.

13:56.800 --> 13:59.800
Yeah, because writing blows. I don't know why people write.

13:59.800 --> 14:01.800
I mean, there are a lot of people who are like,

14:01.800 --> 14:03.800
I don't like writing, I like having written.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.800
I don't like looking forward to writing.

14:06.800 --> 14:09.800
I don't like the process of sitting my ass down in the chair

14:09.800 --> 14:12.800
and trying to be like, alright, write some words.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.800
But once I'm actually in the zone, it's fun.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.800
And I'm three books in and I know that now.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.800
But there was a time, like circa mid book two,

14:21.800 --> 14:23.800
when I was on the 17th version of the plot,

14:23.800 --> 14:26.800
I was like, this is terrible. Why did I ever want to do this?

14:26.800 --> 14:29.800
But I'm kind of over the hump now, and I know I want to do it,

14:29.800 --> 14:32.800
but I mean, there are definitely people who write one book

14:32.800 --> 14:34.800
and they're like, great, I wrote a book.

14:34.800 --> 14:36.800
And now I'm going to move on to something else.

14:36.800 --> 14:41.800
So, if you are the type of person that would like Twilight in theory

14:41.800 --> 14:44.800
if it wasn't so fucking problematic and want to see like a...

14:44.800 --> 14:45.800
Really?

14:45.800 --> 14:48.800
Yeah, no, I liked Twilight in theory before I actually read the book.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.800
And then I read the book and I was like, wow.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.800
A, there's no plot until page 350.

14:53.800 --> 14:56.800
I know, and then the plot shows up and it had not been foreshadowed at all.

14:56.800 --> 15:01.800
The plot shows up and I was like, oh, plot, that's too bad.

15:01.800 --> 15:04.800
There is definitely some abusive shit that goes on,

15:04.800 --> 15:07.800
not between the main couple in the second book.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.800
And it's handled appropriately.

15:09.800 --> 15:10.800
I mean, I think so.

15:10.800 --> 15:15.800
I do think that it was shades of gray, such as it were,

15:15.800 --> 15:21.800
that you dealt with the implications, but it didn't really take sides.

15:21.800 --> 15:24.800
And that was what I, especially about the second book,

15:24.800 --> 15:27.800
that we're not spoiling because it's not out yet.

15:27.800 --> 15:31.800
And of course, leave your comments at SheaApocalypse,

15:31.800 --> 15:32.800
because that's where we read them,

15:32.800 --> 15:36.800
because there's a lot of websites to keep up with that we post at.

15:36.800 --> 15:40.800
So anyway, I'm going to get my empty, my fourth, this is the fifth whiskey.

15:40.800 --> 15:41.800
The fifth whiskey.

15:41.800 --> 15:45.800
Yeah, because in case we ever follow Margo's adventures in college.

15:45.800 --> 15:46.800
I whiskey.

15:48.800 --> 15:49.800
So thank you so much for coming.

15:49.800 --> 15:50.800
My pleasure.

15:50.800 --> 15:51.800
It's been a joy.

15:51.800 --> 15:52.800
This has been really fun.

15:52.800 --> 15:53.800
Yeah, it's been a joy talking to you.

15:53.800 --> 15:58.800
And The Fourth Wish comes out in paperback on June 14th.

15:58.800 --> 15:59.800
In hardcover.

15:59.800 --> 16:03.800
Oh, okay, sorry, I'm the fourth whiskey.

16:03.800 --> 16:05.800
Okay, well, she's had a lot of whiskey,

16:05.800 --> 16:09.800
so The Art of Wishing comes out in paperback on June 12th,

16:09.800 --> 16:11.800
which is the day before my sister's birthday.

16:11.800 --> 16:12.800
Look at this lovely reading.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.800
Yeah, it's so blue.

16:14.800 --> 16:19.800
And The Fourth Wish comes out in hardcover on July 31st.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.800
It comes out on July 31st, which is Harry Potter's birthday.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.800
So those are both very easy to remember.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.800
And ooh, it's so pink.

16:28.800 --> 16:29.800
We love pink.

16:29.800 --> 16:30.800
Good, I'm glad.

16:31.800 --> 16:33.800
If you didn't follow us reading,

16:33.800 --> 16:36.800
of course you can check out The Art of Wishing and The Fourth Wish.

16:36.800 --> 16:40.800
Both are, you know, I guess a much more grounded paranormal romance.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.800
It's not morose and moody,

16:42.800 --> 16:47.800
but it does deal with a lot of the implications of the paranormal myths,

16:47.800 --> 16:51.800
which a lot of YA paranormal mythsists tend to forget to do.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.800
So if that interests you, please check it out.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.800
And thank you so much for coming.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.800
Thanks for having me.

16:57.800 --> 16:58.800
Cheers again.

16:58.800 --> 16:59.800
Get your lemonade.

16:59.800 --> 17:00.800
Cheers.

17:00.800 --> 17:01.800
Whiskey.

17:01.800 --> 17:02.800
Whiskey.

17:03.800 --> 17:04.800
Blue.

17:04.800 --> 17:05.800
Blue.

17:05.800 --> 17:06.800
Blue.

17:06.800 --> 17:07.800
Blue.

17:07.800 --> 17:08.800
Blue.

17:08.800 --> 17:09.800
Blue.

17:09.800 --> 17:10.800
Blue.

17:10.800 --> 17:11.800
Blue.

17:11.800 --> 17:12.800
Blue.

17:12.800 --> 17:13.800
Blue.

17:13.800 --> 17:14.800
Blue.

17:14.800 --> 17:15.800
Blue.

17:15.800 --> 17:16.800
Blue.

17:16.800 --> 17:17.800
Blue.

17:17.800 --> 17:18.800
Blue.

17:18.800 --> 17:19.800
Blue.

17:19.800 --> 17:20.800
Blue.

17:20.800 --> 17:20.800
