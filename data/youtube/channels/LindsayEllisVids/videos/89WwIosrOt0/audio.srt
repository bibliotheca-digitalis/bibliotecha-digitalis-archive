1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So what are we drinking today? This is, uh...

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,800
Um, I am drinking the Art of Whiskey.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,800
The Art of Whiskey.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,800
Goes with the Art of Wishing.

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,800
Yes, it does.

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,300
I'm on the fourth whiskey, which is why I can't brain today.

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:12,800
It's fine.

8
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,800
I'm on the I Wish I Were Drinking.

9
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,800
The Wishful Drinking.

10
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,800
The Wishful Drinking.

11
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,800
It's lemonade.

12
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,800
Pat, pat.

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,800
But it's pink lemonade, so it's fine.

14
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,800
It goes with the thing.

15
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,800
This is our very special guest, Other Lindsey.

16
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,800
So, Lindsey Rebar, who is a young adult author with Penguin.

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,800
And she's released one book, her paperback of which is coming out the second week of June.

18
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,800
That is The Art of Wishing.

19
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,800
And her second book, The Fourth Wish, is coming out in July.

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,800
It's so pink.

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,800
And also, she is an agent with Brain.

22
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,800
Sanford J. Greenberger Associates.

23
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:02,800
She's a literary agent, so we'll talk a little bit about what the market for all you crazy kids who are looking to break in.

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,800
So anyway, The Art of Wishing.

25
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,800
Give us the elevator pitch.

26
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:14,800
The Art of Wishing is about a high school senior, amateur singer-songwriter, and professional control freak named Margo McKenna

27
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:22,800
who falls in love with a high school sophomore, amateur photographer, and professional genie named Oliver Parrish.

28
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:30,800
And she discovers that she is the only person who can save her brand new genie boyfriend from his evil genie ex-boyfriend.

29
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Yeah.

30
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,800
There's a stigma with paranormal romance.

31
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
There's a lot of tropes.

32
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:43,800
And as someone who is intelligent and educated and very well read...

33
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,800
You heard it here first.

34
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,800
Just basically perfect.

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,800
Yeah.

36
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,800
Well, she is a Lindsey, so...

37
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,800
Well, that's true.

38
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,800
How did you reconcile that with the negative stigma?

39
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:00,800
Well, I think a lot of the negative stigma comes from the fact that there is this idea.

40
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,800
I couldn't tell you where it came from.

41
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,800
That all paranormal romance heroines...

42
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,800
I mean, we're talking about specifically the kind where it's human girl, supernatural boy.

43
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,800
There's this thing where the human girl always has to be this beaten down beta female

44
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:25,800
who is just looking for a super-duper powerful guy to come in and probably save her from some evil that wouldn't exist

45
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,800
if he hadn't come into her life in the first place.

46
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,800
But I kind of wanted to turn that specifically on its head.

47
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,800
I wanted a kind of thing where not only is it the girl who saves the boy at the end.

48
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,800
Spoilers.

49
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,800
It is kind of her that is in control of the relationship from the beginning.

50
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,800
So not only is she the sort of alpha personality-wise,

51
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,800
but she is inherently the alpha of the relationship because she is his master.

52
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,800
And that comes with its own set of problems, and I had a lot of fun dealing with those.

53
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,800
So genies by their very nature offer that opportunity as opposed to, you know, vampires or Cthulhu.

54
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
What are you talking about?

55
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:13,800
Well, a lot of those things that we ended up parodying were somewhat subverted in yours.

56
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,800
I think more in the second one.

57
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Definitely more in the second one.

58
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Since that was the one that really deals with the implications of this, you know, dynamic, this master-slave magic.

59
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,800
And the interesting thing about it, you know, you have the male genie who is in the subservient role,

60
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,800
but in the second one you have female genie.

61
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,800
And female genie being put in that role raises all kinds of other questions.

62
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,800
You know, questions that come down to like, you know, sexual assault and consent and things that go really extreme.

63
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:47,800
And having your male genie also be bisexual is something else that was really interesting.

64
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,800
So yeah, at the end of the first book she makes a fourth wish to save Oliver,

65
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,800
which means that she is trading her human life for another wish.

66
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,800
She becomes a genie, and she knows in theory what that means going into it,

67
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,800
being a shapeshifter, being bound to a master.

68
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:09,800
But only when she actually tries to do the shapeshifting herself does she actually understand what that means.

69
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,800
And there's a point where, spoilers, she turns into a boy for a very specific reason.

70
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:20,800
And she has a moment where she's like, well, I still feel like a girl, but like I'm in a costume.

71
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,800
So I got to bring up sort of the difference between sex and gender that way.

72
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,800
These discussions of sex and gender and sexuality,

73
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,800
how do you feel that you're fitting into that with the changing ways of the market?

74
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,800
I think the market is definitely changing for the better.

75
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Every agent I know and every editor I know is actively looking for more LGBT characters

76
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,800
where it's not just coming out 101 like, oh shit, I think I'm gay.

77
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
I have to come out to my parents. How do I do it?

78
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,800
And the entire plot is about that.

79
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,800
And don't get me wrong, those definitely have their place.

80
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,800
And they're important books, but there are so many of them at this point.

81
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,800
It's equally as important to show people who live outside the privileged norm

82
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,800
and just show them living their lives and having, you know, bigger problems

83
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,800
than how to come out to your parents.

84
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,800
I feel like, I don't know how much you'd consider the twilight parallel

85
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,800
with the I become the thing for my boyfriend.

86
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Yeah.

87
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
Was that intentional?

88
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Because I know a lot of the second book, and thank God,

89
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,800
was kind of exploring the repercussions of that.

90
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,800
So what was that modus operandi?

91
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:38,800
So yeah, she's coming from a place where she has everything that she could logically want,

92
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,800
but she has never been impulsive about anything,

93
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,800
and she's never been emotionally stimulated to the point where she wants to do something

94
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,800
for someone else instead of for herself.

95
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,800
It's about the kind of person that she thinks she is choosing to be.

96
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,800
It's a little bit about wanting to stay with Oliver,

97
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,800
but it's mostly about trying to redefine herself.

98
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,800
And in book two, that doesn't mean at all what she thinks it means when she actually does it.

99
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,800
So she's this alpha female character.

100
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,800
She's the one in control, and then in book two, she finds herself in the beta position.

101
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
Exactly.

102
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
For eternity, essentially, not even just the rest of her life,

103
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
because now she's in the morning tuning.

104
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,800
And because I had established her specifically as an alpha female,

105
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,800
kind of in reaction to all those twilights and twilight knockoffs.

106
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,800
So what's the most interesting thing you can do to a character

107
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,800
who is so comfortable in their own life?

108
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,800
Give them the most uncomfortable life position that they could possibly ever deal with

109
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
and watch them deal with it.

110
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,800
So, I mean, Oliver, the genie boyfriend, is kind of a natural submissive.

111
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
He's the ultimate beta male.

112
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,800
He loves people giving him orders in every sense of the word.

113
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,800
She's going through all of these questions of, you know,

114
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
how do I deal with being bossed around?

115
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,800
Do I or do I not get to punch people in the face when they do things I don't like?

116
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,800
And he doesn't really understand why it's not as easy for her as it is for him.

117
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,800
Because what you were just saying kind of reminded me,

118
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
I want to talk a little bit about, like, the process.

119
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,800
You identify as what they call the pantser, meaning you don't outline.

120
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,800
Right.

121
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,800
And she and I are very, very adamant outliners.

122
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Is that Vogue?

123
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
Why?

124
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
That's my outline for this.

125
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Yes, must have, like, skeleton in place.

126
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
Yeah, totally.

127
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
So, like, wire reinforced.

128
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
I mean, I know you're like skulls.

129
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,800
I work from the bones.

130
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
This does not shock me.

131
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Pantser means you write by the seat of your pants, by the way.

132
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
That's what pantser means.

133
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Yes.

134
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,800
I tried to outline the second book because I sold it on proposal,

135
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,800
which meant that I didn't really do a traditional outline,

136
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
like a chapter by chapter thing,

137
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,800
but I did a list of things that might vaguely happen at some point

138
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,800
or another more or less in book two.

139
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
I tried to write to that, and it screwed me up,

140
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
and it probably set me back by, like, six months

141
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,800
because my favorite part of drafting is that I like to be surprised.

142
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,800
There are points that I know I will hit, usually.

143
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
Sometimes they change.

144
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Sometimes they don't.

145
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
But when my characters discover something,

146
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,800
usually the thing that makes the plot happen,

147
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
I want to be surprised right along with them.

148
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
But you were querying it in 2011,

149
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,800
and so we talk a lot about, you know, like publishing,

150
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
despite being so incredibly slow,

151
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,800
like the market and the demand for everything changes so radically,

152
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,800
like every single freaking year.

153
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,800
Well, first off, you queried a paranormal romance in 2011

154
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,800
when that thing was already kind of like, eh.

155
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,800
So, yeah, that was not the first book that I queried.

156
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,800
The first book was a thinly-veiled Harry Potter fanfic-type thing

157
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,800
with a lot of werewolves and also forbidden magic.

158
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
There was actually no kissing in my book,

159
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
unless you count the adult's backstory,

160
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,800
which I was trying to pull off Prisoner of Azkaban.

161
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
It didn't work, surprisingly.

162
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
So you queried that, and it didn't sell,

163
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,800
and then when Art of Wishing came around, you were querying that.

164
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,800
Yeah, so this one, I queried, I want to say, 20 or 30 agents,

165
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
and I got no's across the board,

166
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,800
including from Brenda Bowen, who works across the hall from me

167
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,800
and is currently my agent.

168
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,800
And I was just sending out wave after wave of queries,

169
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,800
and eventually I got sick of it because I was sick of the book,

170
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,800
and I also had this new idea that was, you know, genies, yay!

171
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
So I focused on writing that instead

172
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,800
and kind of let the spellcaster's wolf drop off.

173
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,800
I know, I know, I know!

174
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,800
Next question, why didn't you get an agent, Lindsay?

175
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,800
No! I want a world with the spellcaster's wolf in it.

176
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,800
You can't. You cannot have it.

177
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
You say Brenda works across the hall from you.

178
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
Where do you work?

179
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,800
I am a literary agent by day,

180
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
and I work at Sanford Greenberger Associates,

181
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,800
which is a mid-sized agency downtown.

182
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Sanford Greenberger is an agency that's been around for over 70 years,

183
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,800
and we've got Kafka, we've got The Little Prince,

184
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,800
we've got Dan Brown, we've got a lot of fantasy

185
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,800
and a lot of picture books and YA as well.

186
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
But mostly kids' books.

187
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,800
So here's a question.

188
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,800
If Sarah Ellenson had queried you, straight up,

189
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,800
what would your feel have been?

190
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
My feel would have been,

191
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,800
how long do I have to wait to post about this on Twitter

192
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,800
without her finding out?

193
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,800
Forever. She's a compulsive self-Googler, so you can never know.

194
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
Oh, so she would have found out about it.

195
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,800
And then she would have written an angry blog post about it.

196
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,800
She would have gotten really mad at you.

197
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,800
She would go on Goodreads.

198
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,800
I know she has fans.

199
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,800
Would you have been an appropriate agent for her to query?

200
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
If she hadn't been...

201
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
That depends on how she was...

202
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,800
If she was querying it as a straight-up paranormal romance,

203
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,800
no, because while I really like that genre,

204
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,800
I'm not looking for it right now because it's not really selling.

205
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,800
If she was querying it as a satire, then absolutely, yes.

206
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
She doesn't know what satire means.

207
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
That's the problem.

208
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
That was one of our discussions.

209
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,800
We'd actually kind of wished, in retrospect,

210
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
that we'd made it more overtly satirical

211
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,800
because the one publisher we did talk to was like,

212
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,800
this is a little too subtle.

213
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,800
It's Cthulhu. How is that subtle? Please tell me.

214
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
He wanted it to be parody-parody.

215
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
Like Nightlight.

216
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,800
Which I liked. Poop jokes and that kind of thing.

217
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,800
Which we wouldn't have wanted to do,

218
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
but it could have been more satirical

219
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,800
because a lot of people didn't follow through.

220
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,800
Well, we don't want to talk about that.

221
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Anyway.

222
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
Given how the market is changing very quickly,

223
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,800
do you have any advice for people

224
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,800
who may be thinking about querying within the next year or so?

225
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
Yes, don't write to the market

226
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,800
because as a reader, what you're seeing published yesterday

227
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,800
are titles that sold usually one to three years ago.

228
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,800
It is impossible to write to the market

229
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
because once you're done with your awesome idea

230
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,800
that you ripped off from Publisher's Marketplace yesterday,

231
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
it'll be a month, six months, a year from now

232
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
and that trend will already be over.

233
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,800
So write what you love. Write the book that you want to read.

234
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,800
So The Fourth Wish comes out in July.

235
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,800
It comes out on July 31st, which is Harry Potter's birthday.

236
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,800
Which is pretty much the only reason I remember my own birthday.

237
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,800
Nerd! What?

238
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,800
I don't know what you're talking about.

239
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,800
I would be celebrating by...

240
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,800
I just wanted to let everyone know how many skulls we moved

241
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
in order to film this and it not be weird.

242
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,800
This is my home, by the way.

243
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,800
There are so many skulls, it's a little bit amazing.

244
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
So many skulls offscreen right now.

245
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
I got moved because we're talking about genies.

246
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,800
It seems as time goes by and the internet gets more internet-y,

247
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,800
it seems to be getting more and more difficult

248
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
to make a living off of writing.

249
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
Do you have anything to say to that?

250
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,800
Especially, I guess, in relation to your own aspirations?

251
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,800
Um...

252
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,800
I'm still trying to figure out what my own aspirations are.

253
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,800
Well, you'd just like to be able to make a living off writing, right?

254
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Yeah, I would like to, but I also like agenting.

255
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,800
So, I mean, get a day job that you like

256
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,800
and don't quit it until you are absolutely sure that you can.

257
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
I get stuff like that too, where people are like,

258
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,800
I want to quit my day job and do internet things.

259
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,800
I want to do internet video, and it's like, it takes a while.

260
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Do internet video and then quit your day job.

261
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,800
Save up a nest egg.

262
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Live off that while you're pursuing your artistic dreams.

263
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,800
I mean, also figure out if it's something you definitely want to do.

264
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,800
Yeah, because writing blows. I don't know why people write.

265
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,800
I mean, there are a lot of people who are like,

266
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,800
I don't like writing, I like having written.

267
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,800
I don't like looking forward to writing.

268
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,800
I don't like the process of sitting my ass down in the chair

269
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,800
and trying to be like, alright, write some words.

270
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,800
But once I'm actually in the zone, it's fun.

271
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,800
And I'm three books in and I know that now.

272
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,800
But there was a time, like circa mid book two,

273
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,800
when I was on the 17th version of the plot,

274
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,800
I was like, this is terrible. Why did I ever want to do this?

275
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,800
But I'm kind of over the hump now, and I know I want to do it,

276
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,800
but I mean, there are definitely people who write one book

277
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,800
and they're like, great, I wrote a book.

278
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
And now I'm going to move on to something else.

279
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,800
So, if you are the type of person that would like Twilight in theory

280
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,800
if it wasn't so fucking problematic and want to see like a...

281
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
Really?

282
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,800
Yeah, no, I liked Twilight in theory before I actually read the book.

283
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,800
And then I read the book and I was like, wow.

284
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
A, there's no plot until page 350.

285
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,800
I know, and then the plot shows up and it had not been foreshadowed at all.

286
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,800
The plot shows up and I was like, oh, plot, that's too bad.

287
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,800
There is definitely some abusive shit that goes on,

288
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,800
not between the main couple in the second book.

289
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
And it's handled appropriately.

290
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,800
I mean, I think so.

291
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,800
I do think that it was shades of gray, such as it were,

292
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:21,800
that you dealt with the implications, but it didn't really take sides.

293
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,800
And that was what I, especially about the second book,

294
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,800
that we're not spoiling because it's not out yet.

295
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,800
And of course, leave your comments at SheaApocalypse,

296
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,800
because that's where we read them,

297
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,800
because there's a lot of websites to keep up with that we post at.

298
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,800
So anyway, I'm going to get my empty, my fourth, this is the fifth whiskey.

299
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,800
The fifth whiskey.

300
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Yeah, because in case we ever follow Margo's adventures in college.

301
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,800
I whiskey.

302
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,800
So thank you so much for coming.

303
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,800
My pleasure.

304
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,800
It's been a joy.

305
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
This has been really fun.

306
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Yeah, it's been a joy talking to you.

307
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,800
And The Fourth Wish comes out in paperback on June 14th.

308
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
In hardcover.

309
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,800
Oh, okay, sorry, I'm the fourth whiskey.

310
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Okay, well, she's had a lot of whiskey,

311
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,800
so The Art of Wishing comes out in paperback on June 12th,

312
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,800
which is the day before my sister's birthday.

313
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
Look at this lovely reading.

314
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Yeah, it's so blue.

315
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,800
And The Fourth Wish comes out in hardcover on July 31st.

316
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,800
It comes out on July 31st, which is Harry Potter's birthday.

317
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
So those are both very easy to remember.

318
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
And ooh, it's so pink.

319
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,800
We love pink.

320
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
Good, I'm glad.

321
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
If you didn't follow us reading,

322
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,800
of course you can check out The Art of Wishing and The Fourth Wish.

323
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,800
Both are, you know, I guess a much more grounded paranormal romance.

324
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
It's not morose and moody,

325
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,800
but it does deal with a lot of the implications of the paranormal myths,

326
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,800
which a lot of YA paranormal mythsists tend to forget to do.

327
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
So if that interests you, please check it out.

328
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
And thank you so much for coming.

329
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,800
Thanks for having me.

330
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
Cheers again.

331
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
Get your lemonade.

332
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,800
Cheers.

333
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
Whiskey.

334
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,800
Whiskey.

335
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,800
Blue.

336
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,800
Blue.

337
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
Blue.

338
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
Blue.

339
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
Blue.
