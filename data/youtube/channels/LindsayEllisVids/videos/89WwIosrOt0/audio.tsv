0	3000	So what are we drinking today? This is, uh...
3000	5800	Um, I am drinking the Art of Whiskey.
5800	6800	The Art of Whiskey.
6800	7800	Goes with the Art of Wishing.
7800	8800	Yes, it does.
8800	12300	I'm on the fourth whiskey, which is why I can't brain today.
12300	12800	It's fine.
12800	14800	I'm on the I Wish I Were Drinking.
14800	15800	The Wishful Drinking.
15800	16800	The Wishful Drinking.
17800	18800	It's lemonade.
18800	19800	Pat, pat.
22800	24800	But it's pink lemonade, so it's fine.
24800	26800	It goes with the thing.
26800	29800	This is our very special guest, Other Lindsey.
29800	34800	So, Lindsey Rebar, who is a young adult author with Penguin.
34800	40800	And she's released one book, her paperback of which is coming out the second week of June.
41800	43800	That is The Art of Wishing.
43800	47800	And her second book, The Fourth Wish, is coming out in July.
49800	50800	It's so pink.
50800	53800	And also, she is an agent with Brain.
53800	55800	Sanford J. Greenberger Associates.
55800	62800	She's a literary agent, so we'll talk a little bit about what the market for all you crazy kids who are looking to break in.
62800	65800	So anyway, The Art of Wishing.
65800	67800	Give us the elevator pitch.
67800	74800	The Art of Wishing is about a high school senior, amateur singer-songwriter, and professional control freak named Margo McKenna
74800	82800	who falls in love with a high school sophomore, amateur photographer, and professional genie named Oliver Parrish.
82800	90800	And she discovers that she is the only person who can save her brand new genie boyfriend from his evil genie ex-boyfriend.
90800	91800	Yeah.
91800	94800	There's a stigma with paranormal romance.
94800	96800	There's a lot of tropes.
96800	103800	And as someone who is intelligent and educated and very well read...
103800	104800	You heard it here first.
105800	106800	Just basically perfect.
106800	107800	Yeah.
107800	108800	Well, she is a Lindsey, so...
108800	109800	Well, that's true.
109800	114800	How did you reconcile that with the negative stigma?
114800	120800	Well, I think a lot of the negative stigma comes from the fact that there is this idea.
120800	122800	I couldn't tell you where it came from.
122800	127800	That all paranormal romance heroines...
127800	131800	I mean, we're talking about specifically the kind where it's human girl, supernatural boy.
132800	137800	There's this thing where the human girl always has to be this beaten down beta female
137800	145800	who is just looking for a super-duper powerful guy to come in and probably save her from some evil that wouldn't exist
145800	147800	if he hadn't come into her life in the first place.
147800	152800	But I kind of wanted to turn that specifically on its head.
152800	156800	I wanted a kind of thing where not only is it the girl who saves the boy at the end.
156800	157800	Spoilers.
157800	162800	It is kind of her that is in control of the relationship from the beginning.
162800	166800	So not only is she the sort of alpha personality-wise,
166800	171800	but she is inherently the alpha of the relationship because she is his master.
171800	175800	And that comes with its own set of problems, and I had a lot of fun dealing with those.
175800	181800	So genies by their very nature offer that opportunity as opposed to, you know, vampires or Cthulhu.
183800	184800	What are you talking about?
185800	193800	Well, a lot of those things that we ended up parodying were somewhat subverted in yours.
193800	195800	I think more in the second one.
195800	196800	Definitely more in the second one.
196800	204800	Since that was the one that really deals with the implications of this, you know, dynamic, this master-slave magic.
204800	208800	And the interesting thing about it, you know, you have the male genie who is in the subservient role,
208800	210800	but in the second one you have female genie.
210800	214800	And female genie being put in that role raises all kinds of other questions.
214800	220800	You know, questions that come down to like, you know, sexual assault and consent and things that go really extreme.
220800	227800	And having your male genie also be bisexual is something else that was really interesting.
227800	232800	So yeah, at the end of the first book she makes a fourth wish to save Oliver,
232800	235800	which means that she is trading her human life for another wish.
235800	240800	She becomes a genie, and she knows in theory what that means going into it,
240800	242800	being a shapeshifter, being bound to a master.
242800	249800	But only when she actually tries to do the shapeshifting herself does she actually understand what that means.
249800	254800	And there's a point where, spoilers, she turns into a boy for a very specific reason.
254800	260800	And she has a moment where she's like, well, I still feel like a girl, but like I'm in a costume.
261800	265800	So I got to bring up sort of the difference between sex and gender that way.
265800	269800	These discussions of sex and gender and sexuality,
269800	273800	how do you feel that you're fitting into that with the changing ways of the market?
273800	276800	I think the market is definitely changing for the better.
276800	282800	Every agent I know and every editor I know is actively looking for more LGBT characters
282800	286800	where it's not just coming out 101 like, oh shit, I think I'm gay.
286800	288800	I have to come out to my parents. How do I do it?
288800	290800	And the entire plot is about that.
290800	293800	And don't get me wrong, those definitely have their place.
293800	296800	And they're important books, but there are so many of them at this point.
296800	303800	It's equally as important to show people who live outside the privileged norm
303800	308800	and just show them living their lives and having, you know, bigger problems
308800	310800	than how to come out to your parents.
310800	316800	I feel like, I don't know how much you'd consider the twilight parallel
316800	319800	with the I become the thing for my boyfriend.
319800	320800	Yeah.
320800	322800	Was that intentional?
322800	325800	Because I know a lot of the second book, and thank God,
325800	329800	was kind of exploring the repercussions of that.
329800	331800	So what was that modus operandi?
331800	338800	So yeah, she's coming from a place where she has everything that she could logically want,
338800	343800	but she has never been impulsive about anything,
343800	348800	and she's never been emotionally stimulated to the point where she wants to do something
348800	350800	for someone else instead of for herself.
350800	354800	It's about the kind of person that she thinks she is choosing to be.
354800	357800	It's a little bit about wanting to stay with Oliver,
357800	360800	but it's mostly about trying to redefine herself.
360800	367800	And in book two, that doesn't mean at all what she thinks it means when she actually does it.
367800	369800	So she's this alpha female character.
369800	373800	She's the one in control, and then in book two, she finds herself in the beta position.
373800	374800	Exactly.
374800	376800	For eternity, essentially, not even just the rest of her life,
376800	378800	because now she's in the morning tuning.
378800	383800	And because I had established her specifically as an alpha female,
383800	388800	kind of in reaction to all those twilights and twilight knockoffs.
388800	393800	So what's the most interesting thing you can do to a character
393800	395800	who is so comfortable in their own life?
395800	400800	Give them the most uncomfortable life position that they could possibly ever deal with
400800	401800	and watch them deal with it.
401800	407800	So, I mean, Oliver, the genie boyfriend, is kind of a natural submissive.
407800	408800	He's the ultimate beta male.
408800	412800	He loves people giving him orders in every sense of the word.
412800	416800	She's going through all of these questions of, you know,
416800	418800	how do I deal with being bossed around?
418800	422800	Do I or do I not get to punch people in the face when they do things I don't like?
422800	427800	And he doesn't really understand why it's not as easy for her as it is for him.
427800	430800	Because what you were just saying kind of reminded me,
430800	432800	I want to talk a little bit about, like, the process.
432800	439800	You identify as what they call the pantser, meaning you don't outline.
439800	440800	Right.
440800	443800	And she and I are very, very adamant outliners.
443800	445800	Is that Vogue?
445800	446800	Why?
446800	448800	That's my outline for this.
448800	451800	Yes, must have, like, skeleton in place.
451800	452800	Yeah, totally.
452800	454800	So, like, wire reinforced.
454800	455800	I mean, I know you're like skulls.
455800	458800	I work from the bones.
458800	460800	This does not shock me.
460800	464800	Pantser means you write by the seat of your pants, by the way.
464800	465800	That's what pantser means.
465800	466800	Yes.
466800	470800	I tried to outline the second book because I sold it on proposal,
470800	474800	which meant that I didn't really do a traditional outline,
474800	475800	like a chapter by chapter thing,
475800	480800	but I did a list of things that might vaguely happen at some point
480800	483800	or another more or less in book two.
483800	485800	I tried to write to that, and it screwed me up,
485800	487800	and it probably set me back by, like, six months
487800	491800	because my favorite part of drafting is that I like to be surprised.
491800	494800	There are points that I know I will hit, usually.
494800	495800	Sometimes they change.
495800	496800	Sometimes they don't.
496800	498800	But when my characters discover something,
498800	501800	usually the thing that makes the plot happen,
501800	503800	I want to be surprised right along with them.
504800	506800	But you were querying it in 2011,
506800	509800	and so we talk a lot about, you know, like publishing,
509800	511800	despite being so incredibly slow,
511800	514800	like the market and the demand for everything changes so radically,
514800	517800	like every single freaking year.
517800	521800	Well, first off, you queried a paranormal romance in 2011
521800	524800	when that thing was already kind of like, eh.
524800	527800	So, yeah, that was not the first book that I queried.
527800	533800	The first book was a thinly-veiled Harry Potter fanfic-type thing
533800	537800	with a lot of werewolves and also forbidden magic.
537800	539800	There was actually no kissing in my book,
539800	541800	unless you count the adult's backstory,
541800	544800	which I was trying to pull off Prisoner of Azkaban.
544800	546800	It didn't work, surprisingly.
546800	548800	So you queried that, and it didn't sell,
548800	553800	and then when Art of Wishing came around, you were querying that.
553800	558800	Yeah, so this one, I queried, I want to say, 20 or 30 agents,
558800	560800	and I got no's across the board,
560800	565800	including from Brenda Bowen, who works across the hall from me
565800	568800	and is currently my agent.
568800	572800	And I was just sending out wave after wave of queries,
572800	576800	and eventually I got sick of it because I was sick of the book,
576800	580800	and I also had this new idea that was, you know, genies, yay!
580800	582800	So I focused on writing that instead
582800	587800	and kind of let the spellcaster's wolf drop off.
587800	590800	I know, I know, I know!
590800	594800	Next question, why didn't you get an agent, Lindsay?
596800	601800	No! I want a world with the spellcaster's wolf in it.
601800	604800	You can't. You cannot have it.
605800	607800	You say Brenda works across the hall from you.
607800	609800	Where do you work?
609800	612800	I am a literary agent by day,
612800	614800	and I work at Sanford Greenberger Associates,
614800	617800	which is a mid-sized agency downtown.
617800	622800	Sanford Greenberger is an agency that's been around for over 70 years,
622800	625800	and we've got Kafka, we've got The Little Prince,
625800	628800	we've got Dan Brown, we've got a lot of fantasy
628800	631800	and a lot of picture books and YA as well.
631800	633800	But mostly kids' books.
633800	634800	So here's a question.
634800	639800	If Sarah Ellenson had queried you, straight up,
639800	642800	what would your feel have been?
642800	644800	My feel would have been,
644800	648800	how long do I have to wait to post about this on Twitter
648800	651800	without her finding out?
653800	656800	Forever. She's a compulsive self-Googler, so you can never know.
656800	658800	Oh, so she would have found out about it.
658800	661800	And then she would have written an angry blog post about it.
662800	665800	She would have gotten really mad at you.
665800	667800	She would go on Goodreads.
667800	668800	I know she has fans.
668800	671800	Would you have been an appropriate agent for her to query?
671800	673800	If she hadn't been...
673800	675800	That depends on how she was...
675800	679800	If she was querying it as a straight-up paranormal romance,
679800	682800	no, because while I really like that genre,
682800	685800	I'm not looking for it right now because it's not really selling.
685800	689800	If she was querying it as a satire, then absolutely, yes.
689800	691800	She doesn't know what satire means.
691800	693800	That's the problem.
693800	695800	That was one of our discussions.
695800	698800	We'd actually kind of wished, in retrospect,
698800	700800	that we'd made it more overtly satirical
700800	703800	because the one publisher we did talk to was like,
703800	706800	this is a little too subtle.
706800	709800	It's Cthulhu. How is that subtle? Please tell me.
709800	711800	He wanted it to be parody-parody.
711800	713800	Like Nightlight.
713800	716800	Which I liked. Poop jokes and that kind of thing.
717800	719800	Which we wouldn't have wanted to do,
719800	721800	but it could have been more satirical
721800	723800	because a lot of people didn't follow through.
723800	725800	Well, we don't want to talk about that.
725800	727800	Anyway.
727800	729800	Given how the market is changing very quickly,
729800	731800	do you have any advice for people
731800	734800	who may be thinking about querying within the next year or so?
734800	736800	Yes, don't write to the market
736800	739800	because as a reader, what you're seeing published yesterday
739800	743800	are titles that sold usually one to three years ago.
743800	745800	It is impossible to write to the market
745800	747800	because once you're done with your awesome idea
747800	750800	that you ripped off from Publisher's Marketplace yesterday,
750800	752800	it'll be a month, six months, a year from now
752800	754800	and that trend will already be over.
754800	757800	So write what you love. Write the book that you want to read.
757800	759800	So The Fourth Wish comes out in July.
759800	762800	It comes out on July 31st, which is Harry Potter's birthday.
762800	765800	Which is pretty much the only reason I remember my own birthday.
765800	767800	Nerd! What?
767800	769800	I don't know what you're talking about.
769800	771800	I would be celebrating by...
771800	774800	I just wanted to let everyone know how many skulls we moved
774800	776800	in order to film this and it not be weird.
776800	778800	This is my home, by the way.
778800	781800	There are so many skulls, it's a little bit amazing.
781800	783800	So many skulls offscreen right now.
783800	785800	I got moved because we're talking about genies.
785800	789800	It seems as time goes by and the internet gets more internet-y,
789800	792800	it seems to be getting more and more difficult
792800	794800	to make a living off of writing.
794800	796800	Do you have anything to say to that?
796800	800800	Especially, I guess, in relation to your own aspirations?
801800	803800	Um...
803800	807800	I'm still trying to figure out what my own aspirations are.
807800	810800	Well, you'd just like to be able to make a living off writing, right?
810800	812800	Yeah, I would like to, but I also like agenting.
812800	815800	So, I mean, get a day job that you like
815800	819800	and don't quit it until you are absolutely sure that you can.
819800	821800	I get stuff like that too, where people are like,
821800	823800	I want to quit my day job and do internet things.
823800	826800	I want to do internet video, and it's like, it takes a while.
826800	828800	Do internet video and then quit your day job.
828800	830800	Save up a nest egg.
830800	833800	Live off that while you're pursuing your artistic dreams.
833800	836800	I mean, also figure out if it's something you definitely want to do.
836800	839800	Yeah, because writing blows. I don't know why people write.
839800	841800	I mean, there are a lot of people who are like,
841800	843800	I don't like writing, I like having written.
843800	846800	I don't like looking forward to writing.
846800	849800	I don't like the process of sitting my ass down in the chair
849800	852800	and trying to be like, alright, write some words.
852800	855800	But once I'm actually in the zone, it's fun.
855800	858800	And I'm three books in and I know that now.
858800	861800	But there was a time, like circa mid book two,
861800	863800	when I was on the 17th version of the plot,
863800	866800	I was like, this is terrible. Why did I ever want to do this?
866800	869800	But I'm kind of over the hump now, and I know I want to do it,
869800	872800	but I mean, there are definitely people who write one book
872800	874800	and they're like, great, I wrote a book.
874800	876800	And now I'm going to move on to something else.
876800	881800	So, if you are the type of person that would like Twilight in theory
881800	884800	if it wasn't so fucking problematic and want to see like a...
884800	885800	Really?
885800	888800	Yeah, no, I liked Twilight in theory before I actually read the book.
888800	891800	And then I read the book and I was like, wow.
891800	893800	A, there's no plot until page 350.
893800	896800	I know, and then the plot shows up and it had not been foreshadowed at all.
896800	901800	The plot shows up and I was like, oh, plot, that's too bad.
901800	904800	There is definitely some abusive shit that goes on,
904800	907800	not between the main couple in the second book.
907800	909800	And it's handled appropriately.
909800	910800	I mean, I think so.
910800	915800	I do think that it was shades of gray, such as it were,
915800	921800	that you dealt with the implications, but it didn't really take sides.
921800	924800	And that was what I, especially about the second book,
924800	927800	that we're not spoiling because it's not out yet.
927800	931800	And of course, leave your comments at SheaApocalypse,
931800	932800	because that's where we read them,
932800	936800	because there's a lot of websites to keep up with that we post at.
936800	940800	So anyway, I'm going to get my empty, my fourth, this is the fifth whiskey.
940800	941800	The fifth whiskey.
941800	945800	Yeah, because in case we ever follow Margo's adventures in college.
945800	946800	I whiskey.
948800	949800	So thank you so much for coming.
949800	950800	My pleasure.
950800	951800	It's been a joy.
951800	952800	This has been really fun.
952800	953800	Yeah, it's been a joy talking to you.
953800	958800	And The Fourth Wish comes out in paperback on June 14th.
958800	959800	In hardcover.
959800	963800	Oh, okay, sorry, I'm the fourth whiskey.
963800	965800	Okay, well, she's had a lot of whiskey,
965800	969800	so The Art of Wishing comes out in paperback on June 12th,
969800	971800	which is the day before my sister's birthday.
971800	972800	Look at this lovely reading.
972800	974800	Yeah, it's so blue.
974800	979800	And The Fourth Wish comes out in hardcover on July 31st.
981800	984800	It comes out on July 31st, which is Harry Potter's birthday.
984800	986800	So those are both very easy to remember.
986800	988800	And ooh, it's so pink.
988800	989800	We love pink.
989800	990800	Good, I'm glad.
991800	993800	If you didn't follow us reading,
993800	996800	of course you can check out The Art of Wishing and The Fourth Wish.
996800	1000800	Both are, you know, I guess a much more grounded paranormal romance.
1000800	1002800	It's not morose and moody,
1002800	1007800	but it does deal with a lot of the implications of the paranormal myths,
1007800	1011800	which a lot of YA paranormal mythsists tend to forget to do.
1011800	1013800	So if that interests you, please check it out.
1013800	1015800	And thank you so much for coming.
1015800	1017800	Thanks for having me.
