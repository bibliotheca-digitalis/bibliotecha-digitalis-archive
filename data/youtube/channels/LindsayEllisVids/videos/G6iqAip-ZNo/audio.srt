1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
I listened to it all and I said Andrew, is this something I don't get? Is this about

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:14,480
Queen Victoria? She's the main cat and Disraeli and Gladstone are other cats and then there

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:24,640
are poor cats. Am I missing this? And he took a terrible, painful long pause and said Hal,

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,400
it's about cats and we never discussed it again.

5
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,200
In 2012, New York Times food critic Pete Wells published a review of Food Network Personality

6
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:57,800
and Human Can of Bud Light Lime, Guy Fieri's massive Times Square restaurant, Guy Fieri's

7
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,560
American Kitchen and Bar, fittingly located right across the street from the Majestic

8
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,600
Theater, which at the time had hosted Phantom of the Opera on Broadway for nearly 25 years.

9
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,160
And while some eight years later, we've come full circle to where we've all decided that

10
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,400
Guy Fieri is both prime meme fodder and also good now.

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:28,560
2012 was a different time, and Wells' review pulled no punches.

12
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,960
Guy Fieri, have you eaten at your new restaurant in Times Square? Did panic grip your soul

13
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,160
as you stared into the whirling hypno-wheel of the menu, where adjectives and nouns spin

14
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,840
a crazy vortex, when you saw the burger described as Guy's Pat LaFrieda Custom Blend All Natural

15
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,160
Creekstone Farm Black Angus Beef Patty, L-Top, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, and Pickle, SMC, Super

16
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,160
Melted Cheese, and a slathering of donkey sauce on garlic buttered brioche, did your

17
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,880
mind touch the void for a minute? Hey, did you try that blue drink, the one that glows

18
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,760
like nuclear waste, the watermelon margarita? Any idea why it tastes like some combination

19
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:06,040
of radiator fluid and formaldehyde? What is going on at this new restaurant of yours,

20
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,040
really?

21
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,400
And in a way that food reviews seldom do, Wells' piece blew up and went viral, with

22
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,160
everyone sharing it to their Facebook and Twitter timelines, cheering and celebrating

23
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,620
the epic pwnage of Guy Fieri, that sun-drenched, frosted-tipped buffoon, by one of the most

24
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,560
widely circulated newspapers in the world. And while rubbernecking trash fires has been

25
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,760
a time-honored tradition as long as civilization has been a thing, the commodification of our

26
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,800
need to see trash being eviscerated by the critic intelligentsia has become an ever-evolving

27
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,480
industry. One can, after all, easily elevate their online brand with a well-timed takedown.

28
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:46,000
There's no mist in the galaxy? Ding! That's not Earth! Fake! Ding!

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,400
And with Tom Hooper's 2019 trainwreck adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical of the

30
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,200
same name, there was blood in the water.

31
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,960
Watching Cats is like stumbling upon an unholy and hit-you-for-unknown genre of porn. Every

32
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,880
time these horny fur demons tongue a milk bowl and start moaning, I was certain the

33
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,720
FBI would raid the theater.

34
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,160
It's loud to report that Cats is everything you'd hoped for and more, a mesmerizingly

35
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,160
ugly fiasco that makes you feel like your brain is being eaten by a parasite, a viewing

36
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,680
experience so stressful that it honestly brought on a migraine.

37
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:26,200
Can you make a movie so bad that the Academy takes back your Best Director Oscar? Asking

38
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
for a Tom Hooper.

39
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,320
By the time I left the theater, I wasn't even sure what a real cat looked like anymore.

40
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:37,360
To assess Cats as good or bad feels like the entirely wrong axis on which to see it.

41
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,280
It is, with all affection, a monstrosity.

42
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,120
I am not a cat person. Second off, after watching this frankly mortifying film adaptation of

43
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,520
Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats, I'm not altogether sure I am a movie person anymore either.

44
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,540
Finally, a whole new generation can discover that Cats the musical is two hours of human-feline

45
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,800
hybrids without genitals, having no touch sex, and begging for death via song.

46
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,560
Cats is the worst thing to happen to cats since dogs.

47
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,280
Cats is pure nightmare fuel. The rejects from the Island of Dr. Mero putting on a show is

48
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,640
bad enough, but add to that more crotch shots than a Michael Bay movie and every imaginable

49
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,480
pun and that still won't prepare you for the hellscape that is children's faces CGI'd

50
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,480
onto mice.

51
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:25,600
For the most part, Cats is both a horror and an endurance test. A dispatch from some neon-drenched

52
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,080
netherworld where the ghastly is inextricable from the tedious.

53
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,920
I felt the light inside me slowly fading.

54
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,920
Oh god, my eyes!

55
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,000
Are you blind when you're born? Can you see in the dark?

56
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,400
I was one of the very first people to see Cats, the movie, the musical, if Tom Hooper

57
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,520
is to be believed, some 24 hours after the film was even finished.

58
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,560
This was not because I'm the world's biggest Cats stan or because I'm just that important,

59
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,040
it was because I cajoled my friend who got invited to a critic screening to let me be

60
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,880
her plus one.

61
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,800
See, after weeks of reveling in the pure unintentional Salvadorian madness that was the trailer,

62
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,240
I was keen to be one of the first. I got my complimentary cat ears, they gave us Cats

63
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,560
temporary tattoos and Cats champagne, presumably to help black out what we were about to see,

64
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,880
and we settled in for the ride of a lifetime.

65
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,720
There were two types of people at this screening, people who were familiar with Andrew Lloyd

66
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,640
Webber's Cats, and people who until now had lived in blissful ignorance.

67
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,760
I was, in fact, sandwiched right between two of these people, to my left sat Angie Hahn,

68
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,560
critic for Mashable.com and who knew f*** all about Cats, and to my right, Emily Vanderwerf,

69
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,040
critic at large for Vox.com and the person I cajoled into taking me, and who, like me,

70
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,560
was familiar with Cats.

71
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,400
Emily spent more or less the whole film making this face, and Andrew spent the whole film

72
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,360
making this face. Both of them deeply enjoyed the experience, for the record. Maybe not

73
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,320
the film itself, but definitely the experience.

74
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,720
For people who hadn't seen Cats before, the questions seemed to be,

75
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm saying a cat is not a dog.

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,200
Is this it? Is this what Cats is? Is this what Cats has been the whole time?

77
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,800
And on that day, I was like, I mean, yeah, that's pretty much Cats. What did you expect?

78
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:31,320
And say a cat is not a dog.

79
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,320
And if you follow me on Twitter, you know I spent most of my December and January obsessed

80
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:41,720
with the Cats movie, which was every bit as much of a trainwreck as I had hoped. And why?

81
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,160
Even now, I honestly could not tell you.

82
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,040
But the more time I spent on Cats and thinking about this movie, the more I had to actually

83
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,360
confront these questions. Not just the question of why am I so fixated on this unquestionable

84
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,360
disaster, but why is Cats? How did this become a thing?

85
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,440
Because that the movie and the stage musical exist at all, let alone that the musical was

86
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,440
as popular as it was, is somewhat baffling.

87
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,400
I got so fixated on this that I started a podcast about it, where I explain musicals

88
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,820
to my friend who hates musicals. Information in the description.

89
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,380
And of course, our pilot episode was about Cats. But even there, where I attempt to explain

90
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:25,380
that which is Cats, I kind of fail because that question of why came up a few times.

91
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:32,260
So it still leads to the real question, which is, who likes Cats? I would argue it's kids.

92
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,580
I say I don't know. Like, I don't, I don't know who Cats is for because I don't know

93
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,260
anyone who's write or die for Cats.

94
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,980
I'm literally looking at a person who's write or die for Cats.

95
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,980
No, I'm not.

96
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,980
You can deny it all you want.

97
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,380
But I don't think that in that episode, I answered that why question satisfactorily.

98
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,780
And part of that is, I think, the mistake of conflating the why for the stage musical,

99
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,740
which is almost 40 years old, kind of like me, and the why for the movie.

100
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,460
I realize now that those two why-god-whys have very different answers.

101
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:05,280
The first time I saw the film, I was like, well, what did you expect? This is Cats.

102
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,740
But I'm going to have to walk back this assessment.

103
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:17,980
If we are asking why this happened, and wholly conflating this

104
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:23,780
with this,

105
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,780
then, my Jellicle friends, we are asking the wrong questions.

106
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:44,620
Cats the Musical is based on a collection of poems entitled Old Possum's Book of Practical

107
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,320
Cats, written by T.S. Eliot and published in 1939.

108
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,500
As the poems were originally written for Eliot's young godchildren, the nature of them skews

109
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,940
light and comedic, short and whimsical.

110
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:01,580
Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber not only grew up with this book of poetry, he also just loves cats.

111
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,580
How?

112
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,780
It's about cats.

113
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,120
Just big fan of cats.

114
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,880
Nothing deep, nothing weird, man just likes him a cat.

115
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,360
But Lloyd Webber didn't come to the idea of turning practical cats into a show until

116
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
the late 1970s.

117
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,820
A friend had asked him if he'd be interested in composing music set to poetry.

118
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,200
And one day, while Evita was in rehearsals, he thought of that book that his mother had

119
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,780
read to him as a child.

120
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:31,100
My mother used to read them to me, and I always loved them, and I had them myself, and I kept

121
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,880
them for years.

122
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,160
And I always thought that there was something about them that was very musical, I guess.

123
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,480
But it wasn't until he had a long, liquid lunch with producer Cameron Mackintosh in

124
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,680
1980, however, that Cats the Stage Musical became its own moving engine.

125
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,560
But a large, dance-centric show was a daring move for musical theatre at the time.

126
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,280
Cameron was already friends with acclaimed choreographer Gillian Lynn, who would ultimately

127
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,280
choreograph the show.

128
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,240
The man was wonderful when he made love to me, but I hated him.

129
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,640
But getting the rights from T.S. Eliot's widow, or finding a director, even?

130
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,040
Everybody thought we were mad to do a show about cats.

131
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,040
Everybody.

132
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,040
But it turned out that T.S. Eliot's widow was not as hard a sell as they feared.

133
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,680
After years of dodging requests to make Old Possum's book into an animated film from

134
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,120
companies like Disney, she was afraid that Old Possum would turn out like Winnie the

135
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,040
Pooh or something, Sir Horny Lloyd Webber came to her with a more novel, adult approach.

136
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,880
So I plucked up my courage and I said to Valerie, I said, what would, if I say, if I wanted

137
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,600
them to be a bit like hot gossip?

138
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,920
She said, Tom would have liked that.

139
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,440
If you're not familiar with hot gossip, here was their big hit at the time.

140
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,160
I lost my heart to a Starship Trooper.

141
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,880
I lost my heart, I lost my heart.

142
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,480
Hal Prince was not available to direct this show, however.

143
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,120
Hal, it's about cats.

144
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,600
And after being passed over by multiple stage directors, Lloyd Webber and McIntosh settled

145
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,840
on Royal Shakespeare Company director Trevor Nunn.

146
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,400
But right off the bat, Lloyd Webber kept running into problems of people not getting it.

147
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,520
All cats are jellicles, you see.

148
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,560
This is made clear in one of the unpublished poems.

149
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,920
Yes, but all the other cats are jellicles as well.

150
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,720
All cats are jellicle cats, fundamentally.

151
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,160
You see, dogs are polycle dogs, and cats are jellicle cats.

152
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,240
Cats is more like a review than a traditional plot-driven musical in its format, which isn't

153
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,220
a surprise given that it's based on a collection of poems without much connective tissue except

154
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,560
for the whole cat thing.

155
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,240
But it was director Trevor Nunn who suggested giving an emotional throughline to the show

156
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,360
that would give it some semblance of a story.

157
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,680
The plot, well, if it can be said to have one, is similar to Broadway's previous longest-running

158
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,520
show, 1975's A Chorus Line, as characters take turns singing to win a contest.

159
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,280
And the sympathy vote goes to the one busted old lady, long in the tooth and yearning for

160
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,500
another chance.

161
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,800
In Cats, she's Grizabella, the Glamour Cat, a stinky Sally Bowles with whiskers.

162
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,160
Along with her are a bunch of other feline hopefuls sporting names like MonkaStrep, the

163
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,240
Rum Tum Tugger, Skimbleshanks, the Railway Cat, Ginny Annie Dots, the Gumby Cat, Asparagus,

164
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,080
the Theatre Cat, Ain't It Chief, the Cancelled Cat, Nala, the Girlboss Cat, Fieri, the Flavortown

165
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,840
Cat, and so on.

166
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,400
And the success of Cats was by no means a given.

167
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,200
The ambitious nature of the musical meant that few theatres were willing to risk hosting

168
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,400
it, and the one they eventually did secure, the New London Theatre, saw a massive overhaul

169
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,200
of the theatre itself just for this production.

170
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,560
Funding was also coming up short, and Lloyd Webber had to take out a second mortgage on

171
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,480
his home just to complete it.

172
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,960
So Cats was, weirdly enough, an underdog passion project that Lloyd Webber risked everything

173
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:34,960
for.

174
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,440
And all of this was before the show could be considered anything remotely close to done.

175
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,440
The writing process was a work in progress throughout previews right until opening, in

176
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,360
no small part because figuring out the connective tissue between a bunch of poems wasn't exactly

177
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,000
a priority for Lloyd Webber, who just wanted a bunch of people in Lycra to sing about being

178
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
cats.

179
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:04,400
But a major issue was the lack of an emotional lynchpin, the showstopper, that emotional

180
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,520
ballad that is the keystone of every musical.

181
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,920
Cats didn't really have one, nor did it have a character to sing it, and none of Eliot's

182
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,880
whimsical poems really lent themselves to that sort of ballad.

183
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,680
Said character came in the form of one of Eliot's unpublished poems, Grizabella the

184
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:24,160
Glamour Cat, a poem about a sad has-been cat that Eliot cut from his collection because,

185
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:35,600
given that the collection was for children, he considered it too sad.

186
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:46,440
So Grizabella the Glamour Cat became the song that served as the character's entrance.

187
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,980
But what would she sing?

188
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,820
As a composer, Lloyd Webber would sometimes write a song, but not really have a home for

189
00:13:51,820 --> 00:14:04,280
it in whatever show he was working on.

190
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,300
The song that would become Memory, the melody for it at least, he had written several years

191
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,860
earlier, and was basically saving it for just such an occasion.

192
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,620
So there was the melody, but there weren't really any cat poems that fit it.

193
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,420
So the lyrics are inspired by, rather than directly lifted from, an Eliot poem that

194
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,620
was not part of Old Possum, Rhapsody on a Windy Night.

195
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,720
I say inspired by because the lyrics went through a lot of versions, one of which from

196
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,780
Lloyd Webber's former lyricist and writing partner, Tim Rice, who had co-written with

197
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:36,940
him Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Jesus Christ Superstar, and Evita.

198
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,300
Now by this point, Lloyd Webber and Rice had well and truly fallen out, even though neither

199
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,820
of them have ever really publicly explained why, but Lloyd Webber asked him to do a pass

200
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,820
on it.

201
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,660
Rice was like, fine, he did, and then he was like, actually don't use my lyrics, but then

202
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,660
they used his lyrics during previews, and he got really mad, and he threatened to sue,

203
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,660
it was a whole thing.

204
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,500
I did write a lyric for Memory, and it went into the show for a couple of nights in previews,

205
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:06,020
and then it was taken out and given to a lyricist chosen by the director.

206
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,020
The director.

207
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,860
Eventually, it was none who found the most agreeable interpretation of the poem, and

208
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:24,020
lo, Cats has its signature song, completed sometime during previews.

209
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:28,780
And despite all of those low expectations, despite the no plot, despite the weirdness,

210
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:34,380
despite the lycra, despite the hair, despite everything, by 1981, Cats had opened in London,

211
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:39,020
and soon swept the Olivier Awards, coming to Broadway some 18 months later, and there

212
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:47,660
swept the Tonys, including Best Musical.

213
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:52,700
But despite the show's success, critics were not super enamored with Cats, ripping

214
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:57,380
apart the gossamer-thin plot, the weird mood, the focus on dance, which according to theatre

215
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:03,140
professor Alison McLemore, musical theatre scholars tend to be biased against.

216
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:21,100
Broadway legend Elaine Stritch just walked out, said Stritch later.

217
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,840
But in spite of all of its strange, gaudy, borderline showtime-after-midnight drapings

218
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:31,260
and utterly befuddling story, Cats managed to amass its own army of stay-at-home moms,

219
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,780
lonely 12-year-olds, and perverts that critics could never hope to dissuade.

220
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:39,740
It's for everybody, it's for kids, it's for adults, I've seen it about 9 times now,

221
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,660
and every time it's better than last year.

222
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,180
I enjoyed it more tonight than I did 18 years ago when it first came out.

223
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:51,260
It's very exciting, you know, all different things are happening, like, you know, it's

224
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,260
very emotional.

225
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,700
To quote a Guardian article from last winter,

226
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:06,300
Cats is the best show I ever saw.

227
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,460
Gorgeous, simply gorgeous.

228
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,620
Cats was also the original blockbuster megamusical.

229
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:16,000
On the business side, everything that was wrong with Cats worked to its benefit.

230
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,300
No stars meant cast changes were not a problem.

231
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,740
Thin story meant those lucrative foreign tourists don't miss anything.

232
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,460
No money quote from the Times Review?

233
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,500
Well, we don't need it, we've got this amazing poster that would only be harmed by

234
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,940
critic quotes.

235
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,420
Minimalism, baby.

236
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:35,580
The actors also traditionally interact with the audience, which, while not much fun for

237
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:40,540
Elaine Stritch, helps most theatergoers lose themselves in the shamelessness of it all.

238
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:47,100
Jellicles come to the Jellicle Bowl.

239
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,940
Nostalgia is also a factor.

240
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:54,580
While Cats fans do come in all ages, the superfans tend to be age 40 plus and remember the original

241
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,540
West End and Broadway versions.

242
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,060
Another part of the show's appeal is that there are so many characters for audiences

243
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,180
to relate to.

244
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:04,620
And for most fans of the show, the fact that it is so weird, so removed from reality is

245
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:12,980
not a bug, but a feature.

246
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:17,640
In his New York Times review of Cats, Frank Rich wrote that despite its flaws, the reason

247
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,060
people will hunger to see Cats is that it's a musical that transports the audience into

248
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:30,180
a complete fantasy world that could only exist in theater.

249
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,100
Rich added some 40 years later,

250
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:49,100
And once again, we circle back to that question of, but why, though?

251
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,100
What's a Jellicle Cat?

252
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,100
What's a Jellicle Cat?

253
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,100
Steven Spielberg and Amblin Entertainment reached out to work with Andrew Lloyd Webber

254
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,100
on an animated version in 1989.

255
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,620
Spielberg's vision was to be set in a dark, World War II era London, and to be somewhat

256
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,100
Brechtian in tone, which, okay.

257
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,100
The concept art that has been released is actually pretty cool, and as is the case with

258
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,260
most musicals, an animated adaptation makes way more sense than the Nietzschean horror

259
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,940
that we eventually got.

260
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,260
But ultimately, between production delays, squabbles about the screenplay, and how to

261
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:40,260
create an actual plot, and the failure of Amblin's other animated films like An American

262
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:45,300
Tale, Fievel Goes West, We're Back, A Dinosaur Story, and Balto, the studio shut down in

263
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,220
1997 and ended any hope of the animated film coming to fruition.

264
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,500
A multi-camera version of the stage show was filmed and released in 1998, shortening the

265
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,660
musical and adding new elements, like force lightning.

266
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,980
So this should be good enough.

267
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,980
We have this.

268
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,980
We don't need a live-action movie.

269
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,820
And of all of the musicals to adapt, it makes the most sense that Cats had evaded adaptation

270
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:13,020
for so long, despite its popularity.

271
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,220
Universal bought the film rights to Cats sometime after the Amblin production folded, and it

272
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,700
kind of existed in that development hell limbo ever since.

273
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,260
Lloyd Webber kind of hinted at something being in the works as early as 2013, but we didn't

274
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,460
see movement until about three years later.

275
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,740
So what happened in that time?

276
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:36,620
Well, Greatest Showman came along and made half a billion dollars worldwide.

277
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:41,660
Obviously, I'm not Mr. Universal, but we can surmise that Mr. Universal saw the long-in-development

278
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:45,540
Cats project and thought, hey, let's give that the go-ahead and then we too can make

279
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,020
half a billion dollars.

280
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,620
And while we're there, let's attach to it the last guy who won a bunch of Oscars

281
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,620
for a musical.

282
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,620
That's the ticket.

283
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,180
Half a billion dollars and Oscars.

284
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,500
Everybody wins.

285
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:00,100
So it does kind of feel like we're missing a step here, that a prestige musical adaptation

286
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,420
equals Oscar bait de facto.

287
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:06,180
For most of the early history of the Academy Awards, musicals were a major presence if

288
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:10,620
for no other reason than in the early days of talkies, musicals just made up a much larger

289
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,540
proportion of films that got made.

290
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:16,400
But as we covered in the episode about roadshows, the big studio musical was kind of on its

291
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,200
way out in the 1960s in favor of more heady experimental cinema.

292
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,760
But then we had a couple of big hits and more importantly, big Oscar winners in the form

293
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,960
of Mary Poppins and The Sound of Music.

294
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,460
So that created a sort of boom and bust for the musical as an awards darling, but also

295
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,220
for the movie musical in general.

296
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,460
After Hello Dolly was a critical and commercial failure, the Hollywood musical was kind of

297
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,320
dead for a while.

298
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,120
So after that you had movies like Cabaret, which while unlike big studio musicals in

299
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,640
most regard, did win a bunch of Oscars.

300
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,120
But that was kind of the end of the era of musicals as Oscar darlings.

301
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,520
You'd have your greases, your little shops, but they were more like popcorn movies.

302
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,600
They weren't awards bait.

303
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,600
And musicals mostly moved into animation.

304
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,720
Hell, the next musical after Cabaret and All That Jazz in the 70s, both directed by Bob

305
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,920
Fosse, to get nominated for Best Picture was Disney's Beauty and the Beast.

306
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,080
So fast forward to 2001, where we are still firmly in the musicals equals popcorn movies

307
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,080
mindset.

308
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,840
Diamonds are a girl's best friend.

309
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,040
Moulin Rouge was not designed to be an Oscar movie.

310
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,280
It was designed for Baz Luhrmann's Romeo plus Juliet, made a bunch of money, and he

311
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,120
has a budget now so let's just let him do whatever he wants.

312
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,000
And Moulin Rouge is an even bigger hit than Romeo plus Juliet.

313
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,280
Outside it may be raining, but in here it's entertaining.

314
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,320
Now Moulin Rouge came out around the end of May, but like Greatest Showman, it had really

315
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
good legs.

316
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,320
Heh.

317
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,680
And by the time awards season comes around, it's still in theaters, so Fox was like,

318
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,120
hey, let's just go ahead and do a four year consideration campaign, and boom, Best Picture

319
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,120
nominee.

320
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,440
Who would have ever thought?

321
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,080
Everything's going so well!

322
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:00,040
This sets the stage for the already in development Chicago, itself fueled by Harvey Weinstein's

323
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:04,240
four year consideration campaigns of attrition, and not only does Chicago win Best Picture,

324
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,320
but five other awards in 2003, the first musical to win Best Picture since Oliver in

325
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,320
1968.

326
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,600
Now, two things here.

327
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,760
One is that adaptations of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals have historically not yielded very

328
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:22,040
good results, either commercially or with regard to awards.

329
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:28,040
I mean, don't get me wrong, they try.

330
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,560
The most successful to date is the 1996 film adaptation of Evita, starring Madonna and

331
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:37,440
Antonio Banderas, which while not an Oscar darling, despite winning Best Original Song,

332
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,960
it did win a bunch of Golden Globes, including Actress for Madonna and Best Motion Picture,

333
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,960
Musical or Comedy.

334
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:52,560
Then, of course, there's Phantom of the Opera, which was also released in the thick of awards

335
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,160
season with high hopes.

336
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,360
It did have a pretty aggressive four year consideration campaign, and it did yield a

337
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,800
couple of Oscar nominations, including, bewilderingly, Cinematography.

338
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:12,480
For more on why that is terrible, watch the video I made on why it is terrible.

339
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,000
Second is that Cats is not structured like a Hollywood screenplay, even in relation to

340
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,840
other Andrew Lloyd Webber shows, which do tend to have, you know, like a plot.

341
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,880
So right off the bat, even in comparison to projects like Phantom of the Opera or Evita,

342
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,960
With Cats, they are starting at a huge disadvantage, which I suspect Mr. Universal knew for a long

343
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,960
time considering how long it took them to get Cats out of development hell.

344
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,200
How do you give this thing the structure of a Hollywood movie, while also keeping it recognizably

345
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,200
Cats?

346
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:49,360
I can dance how he dances too, let me see, it's easy, well, apparently you don't.

347
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,520
So it wasn't just the incredible, unexpected success of Greatest Showman, it was also who

348
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,360
directed the film, and I am absolutely 100% positive that Tom Hooper would never have

349
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:11,640
been attached to Cats if the song Memory was not Cats' biggest staple.

350
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,640
Ignoring Universal's aggressive For Your Consideration campaign for Les Miserables,

351
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,720
a movie which proved that musicals can still be Oscar darlings even into the 2010s, most

352
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,600
point to Anne Hathaway's rendition of I Dreamed a Dream as the thing that clinched

353
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,200
her an Oscar win.

354
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,400
So attaching Hooper to Cats was a no-brainer.

355
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,360
Cats has the big Oscar-winning ballad, Les Mis has the big Oscar-winning ballad, it's

356
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:43,280
just, it's some synergy.

357
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,680
But Les Miserables was a harbinger of things to come, and for every truly bewildering decision

358
00:25:47,680 --> 00:26:04,760
that Hooper made in Cats, the warning signs were always there.

359
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:10,080
When philosopher and media theorist Marshall McLuhan famously said, the medium is the message,

360
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,880
what did he mean by that?

361
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,760
Simplistically, it's the idea that you can only receive an idea or a story through a

362
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:25,600
Be that medium a poem, a novel, a film, a stage show, or even just the act of talking.

363
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,520
It is not the idea or story itself that is being expressed, but a medium that is expressing

364
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,520
it.

365
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,320
Therefore, the medium should be the focus of study.

366
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,120
According to theater scholar Linda Hutchin, while no medium is inherently good at doing

367
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,860
one thing and not another, each medium, like each genre, has different means of expression

368
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,800
and so can aim at certain things better than others.

369
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,120
So let's look at Les Miserables as a case study.

370
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,200
You have Victor Hugo's novel Les Miserables, you have the PBS Masterpiece miniseries starring

371
00:26:52,200 --> 00:27:02,600
Dominic West and David Oyelowo, and you have the Bublil and Schoenberg stage musicals.

372
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,920
Three different mediums telling the same story, but owing to difference in medium, they tell

373
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,960
them in very different ways that are designed, first and foremost, to fit their respective

374
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,960
medium.

375
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,400
So what can often happen when you have someone schooled in one medium who is suddenly having

376
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,440
to figure out how to most effectively do another, that can lead to some dissonance.

377
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,800
I think what I was trying to achieve was a combination of extreme realism so that the

378
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:32,200
film would feel rooted in a visceral reality, but also allowing a certain heightening of

379
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,200
reality.

380
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,560
We saw this in Phantom of the Opera, directed by Joel Schumacher, where there's a lot

381
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,760
of little things that just show him trying to make it less of a musical.

382
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:49,760
Like having them speak singing lines that don't make sense to speak sing, and then

383
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:58,200
having Butler scream half his lines instead of singing them.

384
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,080
And this, of course, works both ways.

385
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,840
The Producers, the 2005 film, was directed by Susan Stroman, who also directed the Broadway

386
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,840
stage show.

387
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,120
The Producer shows us what it's like when a stage director is uncomfortable working

388
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,720
in the format of film.

389
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,200
People who've never seen this show but did see the movie, an adaptation which is faithful

390
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,760
to a fault because it's basically just the stage show, are like, that's it?

391
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,920
That's the winningest, toniest show ever?

392
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,360
But this film version is emblematic of how medium matters.

393
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,040
So much that worked on the stage and led the producers to win the most tonies of any musical

394
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:49,360
by a single production in history, just didn't translate to film.

395
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,400
Quoting film scholar Robert Stamm,

396
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,960
Film clearly has resources that the stage can never have.

397
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,360
The power of the close-up that gives the micro-drama of the human countenance and the separate

398
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,440
soundtracks of film that permit voice-overs, music, and the non-vocal to intermingle.

399
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,440
Linda Hutcheon adds,

400
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,800
And, when we sit quiet and still, in the dark watching real live bodies on the stage, our

401
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,760
kind of identification is different from when we sit in front of a screen and have the reality

402
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,160
mediated for us by technology.

403
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,760
So live theater naturally requires way more suspension of disbelief than film does.

404
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,840
You are in the same room with these people, you have to applaud after every musical number,

405
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,800
you can see the sets, you can see that the snow isn't real.

406
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,680
The actors are probably pantomiming like half of a set that isn't there.

407
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,200
But the medium of film works against that necessary suspension of disbelief.

408
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,200
I'd rather just sing.

409
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,200
Stop that, stop that.

410
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,360
You're not going into a song while I'm here.

411
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,800
And must be adjusted for with stylism.

412
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,600
That's why musicals tend to work better as animated movies than live action movies.

413
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:54,800
An animated movie requires more suspension of disbelief because this isn't real, it's a drawing.

414
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,600
Why was everyone singing?

415
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,520
We've just got a song in our hearts.

416
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,360
And therefore it fits more easily with the requirements of believing that these characters

417
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,120
might suddenly just burst into song.

418
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,120
How is it you all know the words?

419
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,120
Did you rehearse?

420
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,120
Yeah, every Thursday.

421
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,040
Didn't you see the flyers?

422
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,680
Of course, film directors do sometimes figure out ways to bridge this gap gracefully.

423
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,240
Chicago springs to mind.

424
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,000
It manages to work with the realism of the tone while incorporating the more theatrical

425
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,600
framing, all while making it work within its own internal logic.

426
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,880
And sometimes other movie musicals just don't care about how realistic or not the framing

427
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,360
is, and they just don't bother caring about that.

428
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,360
The Mamma Mia's are a good example.

429
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,480
They are not going for high art, and that's fine.

430
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,040
But part of the tilt toward realism in film is because the Academy tends to reward a more

431
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,680
realistic style.

432
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,280
Not always, but overall.

433
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,960
And for those of you out there who argue that Tom Hooper's style is actually kind of weird,

434
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,600
strange angles and lots of dead space of exposed brick and wallpaper does not an unrealistically

435
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,000
styled film make.

436
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,800
Yes, Hooper does use a lot of unsettling visual language, and I'll get to that in a minute,

437
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,320
but that doesn't mean that groundedness in realism isn't ultimately what he's going for.

438
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,800
So in addition to a sort of stylistic discomfort with musicals in general, there's also incentive

439
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,560
to make the visual style of the film more realistic.

440
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,800
So his proclivity for dragging the medium of the musical kicking and screaming into

441
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:23,360
the style of realism preferred by the Oscars, it was only a matter of time before he slipped

442
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,360
into the Uncanny Valley.

443
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:31,280
So the tactic with Les Mis' visual language was, in part, visual realism.

444
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,560
But in addition to that, in order to make it feel more immediate and more realistic,

445
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:46,280
Hooper also elected to use set sound, recording the actors as they sang.

446
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,520
Other than the more traditional way of doing it, by having the actors sing along to playback.

447
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,760
Hooper went to very great lengths to make the performance feel more authentic.

448
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:59,960
By recording it live, Tom is allowing us the spontaneity of normal film acting.

449
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,360
And it was a great gimmick to sell to Academy voters.

450
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,880
So the medium of musical theater, which in the case of Les Mis and Cats requires the

451
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,440
cast to be singing the whole time, already requires a much higher degree of suspension

452
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,160
of disbelief than film does.

453
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,680
And not just realistic, actively at war with the big emotions of the music.

454
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:21,840
You have extreme close-ups, constantly, for three hours, on actors who are singing songs

455
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,640
designed to play to cheap seats.

456
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:30,060
Well, he did, Les Mis is bad, but it won some awards.

457
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:38,760
So even though the main impact of that movie is in Le Chauvet memes.

458
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,920
The formula, according to Universal, appears to be Tom Hooper plus Beloved Classic Musical

459
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,480
equals profit.

460
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,720
So that's how we got here.

461
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,640
Let's see what we got.

462
00:32:49,640 --> 00:33:01,800
I don't know what I expected.

463
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,100
Although I will attempt to find rationale, if not reason, in the film version of Cats,

464
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:12,740
there are many bewildering choices that I can only attribute to Hooperian whimsy.

465
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:17,300
From horny Judi Dench scissoring in delight after Gus the theater cat, to Jennifer Hudson

466
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:21,740
spending most of her screen time in close-ups with her face covered in snot, to McCavity

467
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,540
being played the way that he is.

468
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:31,580
How do you manage to make Idris Elba unappealing?

469
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:35,260
The aspect of the film that drew the most attention, positive and negative, after that

470
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:39,300
first trailer was released was the uncanny valley-ness of it all, which all goes back

471
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,780
to Hooper's attempts to draw this weird fantastical show back down to realism.

472
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,420
Said Hooper in an interview for The Atlantic,

473
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,540
I wanted to keep it very grounded in the present moment.

474
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:52,420
The thing I'm most proud of is that you feel grounded watching it.

475
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,860
It's not that fantastical.

476
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,980
Which... it's Cats, dude.

477
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:04,020
Blame has been laid upon the visual effects team, which...

478
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:14,660
Nobody more than us understands the importance of good visual effects.

479
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,580
Okay let's talk about that for a moment.

480
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:21,260
We've used digital fur technology to create the most perfect covering of fur.

481
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:26,180
So Hooper wanted the film to be grounded and not that fantastical, and part of that was

482
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:31,700
wanting his actors to be X amount of unencumbered, and also to shoot on practical sets.

483
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,500
A weird scale.

484
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,620
So he elected that they should not use mocap suits.

485
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:41,540
Despite the fact that the suits they did wear looked plenty ridiculous, allegedly, this

486
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:45,380
is hearsay, no one has gone on the record to say this, Hooper didn't want his actors

487
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,420
distracted or encumbered.

488
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,300
So no mocap suits.

489
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:53,740
So all of the digital fur technology had to be done manually, which not only ballooned

490
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:58,420
the post-production budget, it massively increased the labor required to finish it.

491
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:03,300
But after the trailer hit, allegedly, again this is through my grapevine, Mr. Universal

492
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,060
kind of panicked and slashed the funding going to post-production.

493
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:12,900
And that, in part, is why you get these shots that look, well, kind of bad.

494
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,620
And why you've got like these floating faces, and why there are some shots that aren't

495
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,620
even finished.

496
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:22,180
So when you hear horror stories of the VFX team for Cats being underfunded and understaffed

497
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:26,700
and overworked, allegedly, again no one has gone on the record to discuss this in any

498
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,180
meaningful detail because they don't want to lose their jobs, so this is all hearsay,

499
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,540
this is the result.

500
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:36,020
So the manually rotoscoped digital fur technology, the slashed budget, and Hooper's bizarre

501
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:41,300
insistence on making changes up to the 11th hour, in part, leads us here.

502
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:46,460
But even if it had gotten the time and money it needed, could this have worked visually?

503
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,460
Would this have worked for audiences?

504
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,980
Probably not.

505
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:56,380
Hooper's dedication to making the movie feel grounded backfired horribly, no matter

506
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,500
how much time the VFX team had.

507
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,020
These decisions were all rooted in trying to bridge that realism gap, so much so that

508
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:06,740
certain elements are somehow both overthought and underthought at the same time.

509
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:12,500
The film's approach to the titular animal is both way more literal and way more dense

510
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,740
at the same time.

511
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:17,940
One wonders if any of these people have ever even seen a cat.

512
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,900
The film adds way more literal cat things that aren't even there in the show, like

513
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:27,380
their ears move around, they crawl around on all fours and paw at each other, they lap

514
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:32,940
at things, and go meow meow meow.

515
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:37,500
Gillian Lynn's choreography in the show is designed to be, like, more evocative of

516
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,940
the idea of a cat, not a literal imitation of a cat.

517
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:45,460
But here we are, not ten minutes in, and we got a crotch-lickin' joke.

518
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,460
I'm a kitty.

519
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,460
Meow.

520
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,460
Meow.

521
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:51,620
And all of this adds up to create a suspension of disbelief problem that isn't there in

522
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,620
the musical.

523
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:56,100
There are not humans in the musical, for instance, but here they are at the beginning of the

524
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,100
film.

525
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,260
We see them before we see any cats.

526
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,820
Humans with their human bodies.

527
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,300
Throwing away a kitten in a bag.

528
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,100
Who also has a human body?

529
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:08,620
But as in Les Mis, Hooper just doesn't seem comfortable or particularly interested in

530
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,380
the medium of the musical.

531
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,380
The breaking of the fourth wall, for instance.

532
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,380
Pretty common in musicals.

533
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,700
Are you blind when you're born?

534
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:20,700
We see this in Les Mis in a scene where, in the musical, Gavroche is addressing the audience.

535
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,700
How do you do?

536
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,700
My name's Gavroche.

537
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,700
These are my people.

538
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,700
Here's my patch.

539
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:30,700
But we can't have that, so in the movie, he addresses some random rich dude.

540
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,700
How do you do?

541
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,700
My name's Gavroche.

542
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,700
These are my people.

543
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,700
Here's my patch.

544
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:39,700
But then in the following line, he addresses the audience anyway, so...

545
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,700
There was a time we killed the king.

546
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,020
We tried to change the world too fast.

547
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:48,740
Cats the Musical breaks the fourth wall a lot more than Les Mis.

548
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,740
The cats address the audience.

549
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,060
They explain things to the audience.

550
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,700
They interact with the audience physically.

551
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,340
But we can't have that, so the movie gets around this by making Victoria the fish out

552
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,340
of water.

553
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,860
They explain the jellicle thing to her instead of the audience.

554
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,860
So cutting this...

555
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:10,460
Do I actually see with my own very eyes?

556
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:14,860
A man who's not heard of a jellicle cat.

557
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:18,220
Sets up in the movie that fourth wall breaking is not a thing that is done here.

558
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,940
Which, you know what, fine.

559
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,860
It's a movie, not a stage show.

560
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:26,460
So then they hold to this change for the whole movie until the end when they have Dench address

561
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:29,460
the camera for like five minutes straight.

562
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:37,300
You've heard of several kinds of cats should need no interpreter.

563
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:43,100
To understand the cats are very much like you.

564
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:49,500
You've seen us both, our habits and our habitat.

565
00:38:49,500 --> 00:39:04,340
But how would you know first your memory and say a cat is not a dog.

566
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:09,380
With cats, some say one rule is true.

567
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:17,540
A cat will condescend to treat you are spoken to myself.

568
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,540
I do not.

569
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:33,100
Oh, for a cat will condescend to treat you dish of cream or you might now and then.

570
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:41,540
And so in time you reach your aim and call him by his name.

571
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:46,380
Movie adaptations also often change the arrangements of songs, which again, fine.

572
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:50,620
But in Cats, it just feels like Hooper did it because he was bored with them.

573
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,780
The Rum Tum Tugger is one of the show's most high energy numbers.

574
00:39:53,780 --> 00:40:01,060
And Derulo is actually a pretty good Rum Tum Tugger, except for that accent.

575
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:11,820
So why, God why, do we keep interrupting this number for Rebel Wilson's bad improv?

576
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:17,540
In the very next scene, we interrupt Bustopher Jones for more Rebel Wilson shenanigans.

577
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:22,740
Anyway, back to the song.

578
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:27,540
Even during Skimbleshanks, the best number in the movie, a mouse yells CATS.

579
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,800
Yep, that's what we're watching.

580
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,120
These things wouldn't be bad in and of themselves except that they don't add anything.

581
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,520
It's like he's breaking up the musical numbers because he feels like they're too

582
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:47,520
boring to stand on their own without something to break them up.

583
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,280
The filmmakers' discomfort slash disinterest with the material expands beyond just the

584
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,040
medium of the musical and the show that they're adapting itself.

585
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:58,600
There's a patent rejection of anything non-heteronormative that's pretty overt to anyone familiar with

586
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,920
the stage musical.

587
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,560
There is a lot of no-homo in this movie.

588
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,120
Romantical cats.

589
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:08,720
Yeah, God forbid that this guy be clocked as anything but the straightest manly man.

590
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,840
It is often played in the musical that Mistoffelees and Rum Tum Tugger have like a little something

591
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,840
going on.

592
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,920
The Rum Tum Tugger is a terrible bore.

593
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,920
And we can't have that.

594
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,920
So both of them get their no-homo moments with Victoria.

595
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,920
VICTORIA!

596
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:31,920
And Mistoffelees gets it in the form of an all-out subplot.

597
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,920
I'm coming, Victoria!

598
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,520
For all the other terrible cat puns and figures of speech that they added in the movie, I'm

599
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,920
surprised they didn't add something about how Rum Tum Tugger loves da pussy.

600
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,920
Romantical cats.

601
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,920
Heterosexual cats, heterosexual cats, heterosexual cats.

602
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,920
But if there's one scene that was always doomed to failure, or wild success depending

603
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:58,920
on how you look at it, in anything live-action or remotely realistic, it is the old Gumby

604
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,920
Cat sequence.

605
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,920
I have a Gumby Cat in mind.

606
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,920
Her name is Jenny Any Dots.

607
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,920
Wherein we hear about the titular Gumby Cat, who lays around all day but at night teaches

608
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,920
mice and other vermin to like, you know, be upstanding members of society.

609
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,920
The show accomplishes this with pantomime and props that are like, you know, garbage

610
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:29,920
from the junkyard that the cats are hanging out in, made to look like, you know, mice.

611
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,920
There are multiple times in the show where the cats pantomime other animals and objects,

612
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:40,920
like mice and dogs and roaches and choo-choo trains, by appropriating trash and turning

613
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,920
it into props and such.

614
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,920
Now they could have done that, but realism.

615
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,920
So instead we get this.

616
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:57,920
And it just keeps escalating and getting more and more horrifying.

617
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,920
I can't even make commentary on this so I'm not gonna.

618
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,920
Except, why god why did they give the mice children's faces?

619
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,920
End of show.

620
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,920
From the moment the trailer came out, my biggest question was how would they try to give cats

621
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,920
the shape of a Hollywood movie?

622
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,920
I kind of deep down thought that they'd be smarter than that and just wouldn't bother.

623
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,920
Like, they'd just let it keep its review-like qualities and have it be something kind of

624
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,920
disjointed in the vein of Fantasia.

625
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,920
But, wow, did they fly wildly in the other direction.

626
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,920
Structuring the film with not one storyline from the musical on steroids, but two.

627
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,920
The first is the enormously expanded part of Victoria, who's the protagonist now,

628
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,920
and the emotional through-line of Grizabella.

629
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,920
A kitten with one brief dance solo in the show and no songs, the film gives her a little

630
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,920
orphan abandoned in the world of the Jellicle Cats narrative and takes this moment from

631
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,920
the stage show and makes it the emotional through-line of the movie.

632
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:26,920
And I'm not saying this is handled gracefully in the show, but the movie tries to bolster it

633
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,920
and in doing so reveals the whole thing's weaknesses.

634
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,920
It is distantly implied in the show, but stated outright in the movie.

635
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,920
Why is Grizabella shunned by the other Jellicle Cats?

636
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,920
Then she went with Macavity.

637
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,920
Macavity?

638
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,920
Macavity!

639
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,920
Trying to add a little more logic to her story is not the most counterintuitive change in the world,

640
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,920
but it does conflict with the other big change they made.

641
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,920
Macavity.

642
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,920
Meow!

643
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,920
Macavity is like an obstacle that shows up towards the end of the show, like earlier

644
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,920
some cats titter hearing about him and then later he shows up, he kidnaps old Deuteronomy,

645
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,920
they immediately undo it and no one ever speaks of it again.

646
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,920
And again, I'm not saying that this is good.

647
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:19,920
It is charitably flimsy and Macavity is not really an antagonist, more of like a thing that happens.

648
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:25,920
The tension of the story, if it can be said to have one, is just the question of who gets to die.

649
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,920
Who gets to die the good death?

650
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:31,920
Macavity in the show doesn't really care about this, but in the movie...

651
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,920
I'm determined to win and I prefer my competition chained up.

652
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,920
Wow, it's his life's goal, that heavy side layer.

653
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:40,920
Why?

654
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:41,920
Because.

655
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,920
Meow!

656
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,920
And then, as if all this doesn't make you want to crawl out of your skin enough...

657
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,920
The Napoleon of Crime!

658
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,920
Ha ha ha!

659
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,920
Ah ha ha!

660
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,920
Macavity! Macavity!

661
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,920
Okay, so Macavity is the color of Idris Elba.

662
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:07,920
Like, couldn't they just make him like a black cat or give him some stripes or something?

663
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,920
I get that that could be problematic,

664
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,920
but I don't think that the only alternative is to tumble head over ass into the uncanny valley

665
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,920
by creating a cat that's just the color of human skin.

666
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,920
Which is itself kind of revealing.

667
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,920
Like, imagine if one of the white actors had the same treatment.

668
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,920
Just a cat the color of human skin.

669
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,920
Would they have not caught this for the uncanny valley yikes that it is?

670
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,920
He's a fiend, he likes shit!

671
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:34,920
So Macavity's function in the movie is to remove the other cats from the competition

672
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,920
so he will be the jellicle choice.

673
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,920
Despite the fact that he seems to be doing pretty well in this life,

674
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,920
but whatever, he wants a new one.

675
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,920
Macavity also serves the dual purpose of extracting your A-list celebrities

676
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,920
who wanted to be in the movie but didn't want to be on set for more than three days.

677
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,920
Macavity!

678
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,920
So he ferrets his kidnapped celebrity cats, and also skimbleshanks,

679
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,920
to a boat which is manned by Ray Winstone, who is also a cat.

680
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,920
And despite Macavity's magical powers,

681
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,920
once they, I don't know, get bored of being tied up with a large chain,

682
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,920
they escape easily, they get back just in time for memory,

683
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,920
and then this happens.

684
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,920
Anyway, so when Grizabella shows up at the end after the whole boat fight,

685
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,920
it's like, well the movie's already had its climax.

686
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,920
We got old dude back, why are we still here?

687
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,920
Oh right, the heavy side layer, the big climax.

688
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,920
Making the Macavity subplot more of a focus leads to the resolution of that subplot

689
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,920
getting way more screen time and involving way more characters.

690
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,920
And it gives it the feel of the climax of the movie.

691
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,920
But it's not. Memory is the climax.

692
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,920
So the film builds in a new climax on the boat.

693
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,920
Growltiger, make her walk the plank.

694
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,920
While also keeping the original one.

695
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,920
Jennifer Hudson is such a good singer that, like,

696
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:58,920
I've never not watched this scene and gotten chills.

697
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,920
Touch me.

698
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,920
No, even leave me.

699
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,920
Like, the arrangement and mixing are so good

700
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,920
that even in the two rowdy screenings I've gone to,

701
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,920
the audience reverently listens to this bit.

702
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,920
The plot was always paper-thin and flimsy, and it was that by design.

703
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,920
But the film doesn't make the plot, such as it were, less flimsy,

704
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,920
it just creates more of it,

705
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,920
and more nonsense that the film obligates itself to explain,

706
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,920
because we have committed ourselves to the style of realism and logic.

707
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,920
But ultimately, if you want to ask the question of why Cats is the way it is,

708
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,920
Cats is the story of hubris.

709
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,920
Awards hubris. Celebrity hubris. Director hubris.

710
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,920
Just good old-fashioned hubris.

711
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,920
Like Les Mis, they wanted to have an all-star cast.

712
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,920
But Cats is a terrible thing to adapt for big stars,

713
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,920
because, unlike Les Mis,

714
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,920
it requires its cast to more or less be on stage the whole time,

715
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,920
as opposed to Les Mis, where you can have Anne Hathaway

716
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,920
for her 20 minutes of award-winning screen time,

717
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,920
and then she's out for the rest of the movie.

718
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,920
Cats is not designed like this.

719
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,920
You're either a cat that has a solo, or a cat that is in the ensemble,

720
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,920
but you're on stage more or less the whole time.

721
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,920
Most of the songs don't have the cats singing about themselves,

722
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,920
but another cat doing the singing.

723
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:17,920
Gus is the cat at the theater door.

724
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,920
The movie changes this by having them half the time just singing about themselves.

725
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:26,920
Gus is the cat at the theater door.

726
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,920
Gus the theater cat, Bustopher Jones,

727
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,920
and especially the old Gumby Cat come to mind,

728
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,920
as songs that were changed to give the stars more screen time.

729
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,920
Don't get cocky!

730
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,920
Because they certainly were not changed because the arrangement was better.

731
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,920
And wow do they fuck up the old Gumby Cat by giving this song...

732
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,920
When the deed's hustle and bustle is done,

733
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,920
Then the Gumby Cat's work is but honey begun.

734
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,920
...to Rebel Wilson, who is not only not a great singer...

735
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,920
When the deed's hustle and bustle is done,

736
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,920
Then the Gumby Cat's work...

737
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,920
It also nixes a three-part harmony.

738
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,920
Because if you want Rebel Wilson in this movie for 20 minutes,

739
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,920
she gots to gets her a solo.

740
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:14,920
But I...

741
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:18,920
Or in the case of Macavity, they take a duet and make it a solo,

742
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,920
because Taylor Swift is not sharing the stage, my friends.

743
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,920
So what do we do with a bunch of celebrities that want solos

744
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,920
and want to be in the movie?

745
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,920
Because it's got the awards guy attached to it, see?

746
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,920
So it's gonna win awards.

747
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,920
But they don't wanna, you know, be on set for more than like three days.

748
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,920
Corden's got his talk show to work around.

749
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,920
Taylor Swift's on tour.

750
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,920
You know what? We can't be bothered by being on set for more than three days.

751
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:45,920
Well, how about Macavity kidnaps the A-listers?

752
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,920
Ineffable.

753
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,920
This not only solves our problem of not really having a threat or tension,

754
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,920
it also means that we have a real solid good reason

755
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,920
for these people not being in the background

756
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,920
when they are not the center of attention.

757
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,920
So not only do we now have a lazy reason to get our A-listers

758
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,920
who don't want to be in the background out of the movie,

759
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,920
we also made the movie worse.

760
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:06,920
Macavity!

761
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:07,920
Go team.

762
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,920
And no awards hubris musical would be complete

763
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,920
without the unnecessary new song.

764
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,920
But at least you have beautiful ghosts.

765
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,920
This one's called Beautiful Ghost.

766
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,920
It was co-written by Taylor Swift and Andrew Lloyd Webber.

767
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,920
You can't write a modern lyric for cats.

768
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,920
So, like, if you can't get T.S. Eliot, like, get T.S.

769
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:35,920
And it, like all of these musical numbers added to the movie to win an award,

770
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:39,920
is completely unnecessary and totally grinds the movie to a halt.

771
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,920
You know, more than it already was.

772
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,920
I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts.

773
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,920
If Francesca Hayward sounds kind of unsure,

774
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,920
it's because she doesn't really know the song,

775
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,920
because they more or less finished it, like, the day of.

776
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:55,920
We were just rushing.

777
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,920
We had written it the day before.

778
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,920
I came in and we had the sheet music made up.

779
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,920
Like an hour or two before they shot it.

780
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:03,920
It's a dreadful day.

781
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:04,920
Terrible.

782
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,920
Taylor Swift over here looking at Lady Gaga, Oscar winner, like,

783
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:10,920
I want that.

784
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,920
One step closer to EGOT.

785
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,920
And her singing it got us a Golden Globe nomination.

786
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:16,920
Wow.

787
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,920
So what, in the end, is the fallout of Cats?

788
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,920
Are we going to have a bunch of cats copy Cats?

789
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,920
Is Cats going to be like the Sharknado of musicals?

790
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,920
Well, I doubt it.

791
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,920
First of all, Cats is kind of one of a kind.

792
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,920
It was a massive, massive loss.

793
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,920
And despite the fact that it's probably going to be

794
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,920
the new darling of midnight screenings

795
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,920
and supplant the likes of Rocky Horror in the room

796
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,920
with its cult following,

797
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:45,920
Hi, doggie.

798
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,920
these are not the tracks that any other studios

799
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,920
are going to want to follow in.

800
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,920
But I have heard some concern

801
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,920
that this might kind of be the end of musical movies.

802
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,920
In an Entertainment Weekly article,

803
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,920
conflicted theater fan Mark Snitiker wrote,

804
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,920
I fear a similar turmoil that happened in the 80s may occur again,

805
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,920
because Cats is, at its core,

806
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,920
a musical that confirms for people who hate musicals

807
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,920
why they hate musicals.

808
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,920
But though we did not ask for it,

809
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:11,920
though we are not responsible for it,

810
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,920
though we need not answer for it,

811
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,920
I believe theater fans must not abandon Cats.

812
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:17,920
Because as much as we may hate it,

813
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,920
we can't deny that we care about it.

814
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,920
You care about it.

815
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,920
But how would you address a cat?

816
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,920
Here is the thing.

817
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,920
Some musicals, not all,

818
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,920
but most of them require a visual medium

819
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,920
that jives with the way that the musical itself is constructed.

820
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,920
Les Misérables was constructed for the stage.

821
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,920
Cats was constructed for the stage.

822
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,920
That is the thing about theater,

823
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,920
especially in a show like Hamilton,

824
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,920
which basically has no props, let alone a set.

825
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,920
It is constructed so that the audience

826
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,920
has to imagine what's going on in the story.

827
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,920
Overcoming that suspension of disbelief

828
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,920
is built into the design of the medium

829
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,920
in a way that it is not with film.

830
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,920
But your traditional Oscar-bait movie

831
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,920
does not allow for that.

832
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,920
Oscar-bait movies demand visual realism,

833
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,920
and it's very rare that something actually

834
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,920
gets rewarded for being stylistic.

835
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:11,920
It happens,

836
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,920
but the Academy prefers gritty realism right now.

837
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:15,920
That's just how it is.

838
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,920
To this idea that there might be a backlash

839
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,920
against musical films,

840
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:21,920
that Cats might be the end of Hollywood

841
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:22,920
taking musicals seriously,

842
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,920
to that I say, good.

843
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,920
Good f***ing riddance, Tom Hooper,

844
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,920
and your musical awards-bait bullshit.

845
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,920
Popular musical being adapted to films

846
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,920
because Oscar-bait is a disease.

847
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:37,920
The only way movies like this work

848
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,920
is either through hyper-stylization

849
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:40,920
in the vein of decent films

850
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,920
like Moulin Rouge or Chicago,

851
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:43,920
or animation,

852
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,920
which likewise can rise visually

853
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,920
to the magical unrealism

854
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,920
inherent to the medium of musicals.

855
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,920
But gritty realism?

856
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:51,920
Oscar-bait?

857
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,920
No thank.

858
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,920
Like, I love Hamilton, but Hamilton the movie?

859
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:58,920
I will kill your friends and family.

860
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:00,920
Please no.

861
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,920
Yes, I will gladly take your live recording

862
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,920
that you filmed five years ago

863
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:05,920
and won't release till next year.

864
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:06,920
I will take it.

865
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,920
But the Oscar-bait musical,

866
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:11,920
the adaptation for adaptation's sake?

867
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,920
Let it burn.

868
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:14,920
Musical theater right now

869
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,920
is kind of in a new golden age.

870
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,920
It is doing just fine,

871
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,920
and it does not need legitimacy from Hollywood.

872
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,920
We do not need film adaptations of musicals

873
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,920
just cause,

874
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,920
just because it's brand name recognition,

875
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,920
just because Chicago won a bunch of Oscars.

876
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,920
So if Cats marks a demarcation

877
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:32,920
where musicals aren't being adapted

878
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,920
for the screen anymore?

879
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:37,920
Good.

880
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,920
I don't want Hadestown the movie.

881
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,920
Super do not want Hamilton the movie.

882
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:43,920
If you watch any one of these

883
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,920
amateur animatics on YouTube,

884
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,920
I promise you they work way better

885
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,920
than anything Tom Hooper has ever done.

886
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,920
So thank you, Cats.

887
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:52,920
Thank you not only for being

888
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,920
the true embodiment of modern horror,

889
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,920
a monument to celebrity hubris,

890
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,920
but also for ending this nonsense

891
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:00,920
of bad musical adaptations

892
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,920
with aggressive four-year consideration campaigns

893
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:04,920
and Oscar dreams.

894
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,920
Wow, we don't need it.

895
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,920
Just save everybody a lot of heartache and money

896
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,920
and just film the damn thing.

897
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,920
Cats 98 will always be there,

898
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,920
but Cats 2019 is a cautionary tale

899
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,920
of a completely different sort.

900
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,920
Someone is smoking over there.

901
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,920
Something we cats would never do.

902
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,920
Filling their lungs with thick, dark hair.

903
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,920
What a disgusting thing to do.

904
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,920
Cats have nine lives with eight to spare.

905
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:37,920
Humans have one.

906
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,920
With none to barter.

907
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:40,920
Why do they smoke?

908
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:41,920
Why don't they care?

909
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,920
Humans are smart, but cats are smarter.

910
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,920
Listen to Cats, you men.

911
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:47,920
Listen to Cats, you men.

912
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,920
Listen to Cats, you men.

913
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,920
Listen to Cats, you men.

914
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,920
Cats, you men and women, take care of your lungs.

915
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,920
They're only human.

916
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,920
The American Lung Association.

917
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,920
The Christmas Seal People.

918
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:02,920
An accident.

919
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:03,920
An accident.

920
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,920
An accident.

921
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,920
The humans had an accident.

922
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,920
There was a child in the car.

923
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,920
A child.

924
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:10,920
A child?

925
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:11,920
A child?

926
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,920
Cats have nine lives, children only one.

927
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,920
Help them live that life.

928
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,920
Buckle them into a car seat.

929
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,920
No one wants a child to become a memory.

930
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:28,920
Memory, all alone in the moonlight.
