0	7920	I listened to it all and I said Andrew, is this something I don't get? Is this about
7920	14480	Queen Victoria? She's the main cat and Disraeli and Gladstone are other cats and then there
14480	24640	are poor cats. Am I missing this? And he took a terrible, painful long pause and said Hal,
24640	28400	it's about cats and we never discussed it again.
45280	50200	In 2012, New York Times food critic Pete Wells published a review of Food Network Personality
50200	57800	and Human Can of Bud Light Lime, Guy Fieri's massive Times Square restaurant, Guy Fieri's
57800	61560	American Kitchen and Bar, fittingly located right across the street from the Majestic
61560	66600	Theater, which at the time had hosted Phantom of the Opera on Broadway for nearly 25 years.
66600	70160	And while some eight years later, we've come full circle to where we've all decided that
70160	74400	Guy Fieri is both prime meme fodder and also good now.
74400	88560	2012 was a different time, and Wells' review pulled no punches.
88560	92960	Guy Fieri, have you eaten at your new restaurant in Times Square? Did panic grip your soul
92960	97160	as you stared into the whirling hypno-wheel of the menu, where adjectives and nouns spin
97160	102840	a crazy vortex, when you saw the burger described as Guy's Pat LaFrieda Custom Blend All Natural
102840	108160	Creekstone Farm Black Angus Beef Patty, L-Top, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, and Pickle, SMC, Super
108160	112160	Melted Cheese, and a slathering of donkey sauce on garlic buttered brioche, did your
112160	115880	mind touch the void for a minute? Hey, did you try that blue drink, the one that glows
115880	120760	like nuclear waste, the watermelon margarita? Any idea why it tastes like some combination
120760	126040	of radiator fluid and formaldehyde? What is going on at this new restaurant of yours,
126040	127040	really?
127040	131400	And in a way that food reviews seldom do, Wells' piece blew up and went viral, with
131400	135160	everyone sharing it to their Facebook and Twitter timelines, cheering and celebrating
135160	140620	the epic pwnage of Guy Fieri, that sun-drenched, frosted-tipped buffoon, by one of the most
140620	144560	widely circulated newspapers in the world. And while rubbernecking trash fires has been
144560	148760	a time-honored tradition as long as civilization has been a thing, the commodification of our
148760	153800	need to see trash being eviscerated by the critic intelligentsia has become an ever-evolving
153800	159480	industry. One can, after all, easily elevate their online brand with a well-timed takedown.
159720	166000	There's no mist in the galaxy? Ding! That's not Earth! Fake! Ding!
166000	170400	And with Tom Hooper's 2019 trainwreck adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical of the
170400	174200	same name, there was blood in the water.
174200	179960	Watching Cats is like stumbling upon an unholy and hit-you-for-unknown genre of porn. Every
179960	184880	time these horny fur demons tongue a milk bowl and start moaning, I was certain the
184880	186720	FBI would raid the theater.
186720	192160	It's loud to report that Cats is everything you'd hoped for and more, a mesmerizingly
192160	197160	ugly fiasco that makes you feel like your brain is being eaten by a parasite, a viewing
197160	200680	experience so stressful that it honestly brought on a migraine.
200680	206200	Can you make a movie so bad that the Academy takes back your Best Director Oscar? Asking
206200	207200	for a Tom Hooper.
207200	211320	By the time I left the theater, I wasn't even sure what a real cat looked like anymore.
211320	217360	To assess Cats as good or bad feels like the entirely wrong axis on which to see it.
217360	220280	It is, with all affection, a monstrosity.
220280	225120	I am not a cat person. Second off, after watching this frankly mortifying film adaptation of
225120	229520	Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats, I'm not altogether sure I am a movie person anymore either.
229520	234540	Finally, a whole new generation can discover that Cats the musical is two hours of human-feline
234540	239800	hybrids without genitals, having no touch sex, and begging for death via song.
239800	243560	Cats is the worst thing to happen to cats since dogs.
243560	247280	Cats is pure nightmare fuel. The rejects from the Island of Dr. Mero putting on a show is
247280	252640	bad enough, but add to that more crotch shots than a Michael Bay movie and every imaginable
252640	257480	pun and that still won't prepare you for the hellscape that is children's faces CGI'd
257480	258480	onto mice.
258480	265600	For the most part, Cats is both a horror and an endurance test. A dispatch from some neon-drenched
265600	271080	netherworld where the ghastly is inextricable from the tedious.
271080	274920	I felt the light inside me slowly fading.
274920	276920	Oh god, my eyes!
280800	287000	Are you blind when you're born? Can you see in the dark?
287000	291400	I was one of the very first people to see Cats, the movie, the musical, if Tom Hooper
291400	295520	is to be believed, some 24 hours after the film was even finished.
295520	299560	This was not because I'm the world's biggest Cats stan or because I'm just that important,
299560	303040	it was because I cajoled my friend who got invited to a critic screening to let me be
303040	304880	her plus one.
304880	310800	See, after weeks of reveling in the pure unintentional Salvadorian madness that was the trailer,
310800	315240	I was keen to be one of the first. I got my complimentary cat ears, they gave us Cats
315240	320560	temporary tattoos and Cats champagne, presumably to help black out what we were about to see,
320600	322880	and we settled in for the ride of a lifetime.
322880	326720	There were two types of people at this screening, people who were familiar with Andrew Lloyd
326720	330640	Webber's Cats, and people who until now had lived in blissful ignorance.
334640	339760	I was, in fact, sandwiched right between two of these people, to my left sat Angie Hahn,
339760	344560	critic for Mashable.com and who knew f*** all about Cats, and to my right, Emily Vanderwerf,
344560	349040	critic at large for Vox.com and the person I cajoled into taking me, and who, like me,
349040	350560	was familiar with Cats.
350560	354400	Emily spent more or less the whole film making this face, and Andrew spent the whole film
354400	358360	making this face. Both of them deeply enjoyed the experience, for the record. Maybe not
358360	363320	the film itself, but definitely the experience.
363320	366720	For people who hadn't seen Cats before, the questions seemed to be,
366720	373000	I'm saying a cat is not a dog.
373000	378200	Is this it? Is this what Cats is? Is this what Cats has been the whole time?
378360	383800	And on that day, I was like, I mean, yeah, that's pretty much Cats. What did you expect?
383800	391320	And say a cat is not a dog.
391320	395320	And if you follow me on Twitter, you know I spent most of my December and January obsessed
395320	401720	with the Cats movie, which was every bit as much of a trainwreck as I had hoped. And why?
401720	405160	Even now, I honestly could not tell you.
405160	410040	But the more time I spent on Cats and thinking about this movie, the more I had to actually
410040	415360	confront these questions. Not just the question of why am I so fixated on this unquestionable
415360	420360	disaster, but why is Cats? How did this become a thing?
420360	424440	Because that the movie and the stage musical exist at all, let alone that the musical was
424440	427440	as popular as it was, is somewhat baffling.
427440	431400	I got so fixated on this that I started a podcast about it, where I explain musicals
431400	434820	to my friend who hates musicals. Information in the description.
434820	439380	And of course, our pilot episode was about Cats. But even there, where I attempt to explain
439380	445380	that which is Cats, I kind of fail because that question of why came up a few times.
445380	452260	So it still leads to the real question, which is, who likes Cats? I would argue it's kids.
452260	456580	I say I don't know. Like, I don't, I don't know who Cats is for because I don't know
456580	459260	anyone who's write or die for Cats.
459260	461980	I'm literally looking at a person who's write or die for Cats.
461980	462980	No, I'm not.
462980	463980	You can deny it all you want.
463980	468380	But I don't think that in that episode, I answered that why question satisfactorily.
468380	472780	And part of that is, I think, the mistake of conflating the why for the stage musical,
472780	476740	which is almost 40 years old, kind of like me, and the why for the movie.
476740	480460	I realize now that those two why-god-whys have very different answers.
480460	485280	The first time I saw the film, I was like, well, what did you expect? This is Cats.
485280	487740	But I'm going to have to walk back this assessment.
487740	497980	If we are asking why this happened, and wholly conflating this
497980	503780	with this,
503780	507780	then, my Jellicle friends, we are asking the wrong questions.
518740	524620	Cats the Musical is based on a collection of poems entitled Old Possum's Book of Practical
524620	528320	Cats, written by T.S. Eliot and published in 1939.
528320	532500	As the poems were originally written for Eliot's young godchildren, the nature of them skews
532500	535940	light and comedic, short and whimsical.
535940	541580	Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber not only grew up with this book of poetry, he also just loves cats.
541580	542580	How?
542580	544780	It's about cats.
544780	547120	Just big fan of cats.
547160	550880	Nothing deep, nothing weird, man just likes him a cat.
550880	554360	But Lloyd Webber didn't come to the idea of turning practical cats into a show until
554360	555360	the late 1970s.
555360	559820	A friend had asked him if he'd be interested in composing music set to poetry.
559820	563200	And one day, while Evita was in rehearsals, he thought of that book that his mother had
563200	564780	read to him as a child.
564780	571100	My mother used to read them to me, and I always loved them, and I had them myself, and I kept
571100	572880	them for years.
572880	578160	And I always thought that there was something about them that was very musical, I guess.
578160	581480	But it wasn't until he had a long, liquid lunch with producer Cameron Mackintosh in
581480	585680	1980, however, that Cats the Stage Musical became its own moving engine.
585680	589560	But a large, dance-centric show was a daring move for musical theatre at the time.
589560	593280	Cameron was already friends with acclaimed choreographer Gillian Lynn, who would ultimately
593280	594280	choreograph the show.
594280	598240	The man was wonderful when he made love to me, but I hated him.
598240	602640	But getting the rights from T.S. Eliot's widow, or finding a director, even?
602680	606040	Everybody thought we were mad to do a show about cats.
606040	607040	Everybody.
607040	611040	But it turned out that T.S. Eliot's widow was not as hard a sell as they feared.
611040	614680	After years of dodging requests to make Old Possum's book into an animated film from
614680	618120	companies like Disney, she was afraid that Old Possum would turn out like Winnie the
618120	623040	Pooh or something, Sir Horny Lloyd Webber came to her with a more novel, adult approach.
623040	628880	So I plucked up my courage and I said to Valerie, I said, what would, if I say, if I wanted
628880	630600	them to be a bit like hot gossip?
630600	632920	She said, Tom would have liked that.
632920	636440	If you're not familiar with hot gossip, here was their big hit at the time.
636440	640160	I lost my heart to a Starship Trooper.
640160	643880	I lost my heart, I lost my heart.
643880	646480	Hal Prince was not available to direct this show, however.
646480	649120	Hal, it's about cats.
649120	653600	And after being passed over by multiple stage directors, Lloyd Webber and McIntosh settled
653600	656840	on Royal Shakespeare Company director Trevor Nunn.
656880	661400	But right off the bat, Lloyd Webber kept running into problems of people not getting it.
661400	663520	All cats are jellicles, you see.
663520	665560	This is made clear in one of the unpublished poems.
665560	667920	Yes, but all the other cats are jellicles as well.
667920	669720	All cats are jellicle cats, fundamentally.
669720	674160	You see, dogs are polycle dogs, and cats are jellicle cats.
674160	678240	Cats is more like a review than a traditional plot-driven musical in its format, which isn't
678240	682220	a surprise given that it's based on a collection of poems without much connective tissue except
682220	683560	for the whole cat thing.
683560	687240	But it was director Trevor Nunn who suggested giving an emotional throughline to the show
687240	689360	that would give it some semblance of a story.
689360	694680	The plot, well, if it can be said to have one, is similar to Broadway's previous longest-running
694680	699520	show, 1975's A Chorus Line, as characters take turns singing to win a contest.
699520	703280	And the sympathy vote goes to the one busted old lady, long in the tooth and yearning for
703280	704500	another chance.
704500	708800	In Cats, she's Grizabella, the Glamour Cat, a stinky Sally Bowles with whiskers.
708800	713160	Along with her are a bunch of other feline hopefuls sporting names like MonkaStrep, the
713160	718240	Rum Tum Tugger, Skimbleshanks, the Railway Cat, Ginny Annie Dots, the Gumby Cat, Asparagus,
718240	723080	the Theatre Cat, Ain't It Chief, the Cancelled Cat, Nala, the Girlboss Cat, Fieri, the Flavortown
723080	724840	Cat, and so on.
724840	727400	And the success of Cats was by no means a given.
727400	731200	The ambitious nature of the musical meant that few theatres were willing to risk hosting
731200	735400	it, and the one they eventually did secure, the New London Theatre, saw a massive overhaul
735400	738200	of the theatre itself just for this production.
738200	741560	Funding was also coming up short, and Lloyd Webber had to take out a second mortgage on
741560	743480	his home just to complete it.
743480	748960	So Cats was, weirdly enough, an underdog passion project that Lloyd Webber risked everything
748960	754960	for.
754960	759440	And all of this was before the show could be considered anything remotely close to done.
759440	763440	The writing process was a work in progress throughout previews right until opening, in
763440	767360	no small part because figuring out the connective tissue between a bunch of poems wasn't exactly
767360	771000	a priority for Lloyd Webber, who just wanted a bunch of people in Lycra to sing about being
771000	772000	cats.
772000	784400	But a major issue was the lack of an emotional lynchpin, the showstopper, that emotional
784400	787520	ballad that is the keystone of every musical.
787520	791920	Cats didn't really have one, nor did it have a character to sing it, and none of Eliot's
791920	794880	whimsical poems really lent themselves to that sort of ballad.
794880	798680	Said character came in the form of one of Eliot's unpublished poems, Grizabella the
798680	804160	Glamour Cat, a poem about a sad has-been cat that Eliot cut from his collection because,
804160	815600	given that the collection was for children, he considered it too sad.
815600	826440	So Grizabella the Glamour Cat became the song that served as the character's entrance.
826440	827980	But what would she sing?
827980	831820	As a composer, Lloyd Webber would sometimes write a song, but not really have a home for
831820	844280	it in whatever show he was working on.
844280	848300	The song that would become Memory, the melody for it at least, he had written several years
848300	851860	earlier, and was basically saving it for just such an occasion.
851860	855620	So there was the melody, but there weren't really any cat poems that fit it.
855620	860420	So the lyrics are inspired by, rather than directly lifted from, an Eliot poem that
860420	863620	was not part of Old Possum, Rhapsody on a Windy Night.
863620	867720	I say inspired by because the lyrics went through a lot of versions, one of which from
867720	871780	Lloyd Webber's former lyricist and writing partner, Tim Rice, who had co-written with
871780	876940	him Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Jesus Christ Superstar, and Evita.
876940	881300	Now by this point, Lloyd Webber and Rice had well and truly fallen out, even though neither
881300	885820	of them have ever really publicly explained why, but Lloyd Webber asked him to do a pass
885820	886820	on it.
886820	889660	Rice was like, fine, he did, and then he was like, actually don't use my lyrics, but then
889660	893660	they used his lyrics during previews, and he got really mad, and he threatened to sue,
893660	894660	it was a whole thing.
894660	897500	I did write a lyric for Memory, and it went into the show for a couple of nights in previews,
897500	906020	and then it was taken out and given to a lyricist chosen by the director.
906020	907020	The director.
907020	910860	Eventually, it was none who found the most agreeable interpretation of the poem, and
910860	924020	lo, Cats has its signature song, completed sometime during previews.
924020	928780	And despite all of those low expectations, despite the no plot, despite the weirdness,
928780	934380	despite the lycra, despite the hair, despite everything, by 1981, Cats had opened in London,
934380	939020	and soon swept the Olivier Awards, coming to Broadway some 18 months later, and there
939020	947660	swept the Tonys, including Best Musical.
947660	952700	But despite the show's success, critics were not super enamored with Cats, ripping
952700	957380	apart the gossamer-thin plot, the weird mood, the focus on dance, which according to theatre
957380	963140	professor Alison McLemore, musical theatre scholars tend to be biased against.
963140	981100	Broadway legend Elaine Stritch just walked out, said Stritch later.
981100	985840	But in spite of all of its strange, gaudy, borderline showtime-after-midnight drapings
985840	991260	and utterly befuddling story, Cats managed to amass its own army of stay-at-home moms,
991340	994780	lonely 12-year-olds, and perverts that critics could never hope to dissuade.
994780	999740	It's for everybody, it's for kids, it's for adults, I've seen it about 9 times now,
999740	1001660	and every time it's better than last year.
1001660	1005180	I enjoyed it more tonight than I did 18 years ago when it first came out.
1005180	1011260	It's very exciting, you know, all different things are happening, like, you know, it's
1011260	1012260	very emotional.
1012260	1014700	To quote a Guardian article from last winter,
1021260	1026300	Cats is the best show I ever saw.
1026300	1028460	Gorgeous, simply gorgeous.
1028460	1031620	Cats was also the original blockbuster megamusical.
1031620	1036000	On the business side, everything that was wrong with Cats worked to its benefit.
1036000	1039300	No stars meant cast changes were not a problem.
1039300	1042740	Thin story meant those lucrative foreign tourists don't miss anything.
1042740	1044460	No money quote from the Times Review?
1044460	1048500	Well, we don't need it, we've got this amazing poster that would only be harmed by
1048500	1049940	critic quotes.
1049940	1051420	Minimalism, baby.
1051420	1055580	The actors also traditionally interact with the audience, which, while not much fun for
1055580	1060540	Elaine Stritch, helps most theatergoers lose themselves in the shamelessness of it all.
1060540	1067100	Jellicles come to the Jellicle Bowl.
1067100	1068940	Nostalgia is also a factor.
1068940	1074580	While Cats fans do come in all ages, the superfans tend to be age 40 plus and remember the original
1074580	1076540	West End and Broadway versions.
1076540	1079060	Another part of the show's appeal is that there are so many characters for audiences
1079060	1080180	to relate to.
1080180	1084620	And for most fans of the show, the fact that it is so weird, so removed from reality is
1084620	1092980	not a bug, but a feature.
1092980	1097640	In his New York Times review of Cats, Frank Rich wrote that despite its flaws, the reason
1097640	1102060	people will hunger to see Cats is that it's a musical that transports the audience into
1102060	1110180	a complete fantasy world that could only exist in theater.
1110180	1112100	Rich added some 40 years later,
1112100	1129100	And once again, we circle back to that question of, but why, though?
1130100	1134100	What's a Jellicle Cat?
1134100	1137100	What's a Jellicle Cat?
1147100	1150100	Steven Spielberg and Amblin Entertainment reached out to work with Andrew Lloyd Webber
1150100	1152100	on an animated version in 1989.
1152100	1156620	Spielberg's vision was to be set in a dark, World War II era London, and to be somewhat
1156620	1160100	Brechtian in tone, which, okay.
1160100	1164100	The concept art that has been released is actually pretty cool, and as is the case with
1164100	1168260	most musicals, an animated adaptation makes way more sense than the Nietzschean horror
1168260	1172940	that we eventually got.
1172940	1176260	But ultimately, between production delays, squabbles about the screenplay, and how to
1176260	1180260	create an actual plot, and the failure of Amblin's other animated films like An American
1180260	1185300	Tale, Fievel Goes West, We're Back, A Dinosaur Story, and Balto, the studio shut down in
1185300	1189220	1997 and ended any hope of the animated film coming to fruition.
1189220	1193500	A multi-camera version of the stage show was filmed and released in 1998, shortening the
1193500	1198660	musical and adding new elements, like force lightning.
1198660	1199980	So this should be good enough.
1199980	1200980	We have this.
1200980	1202980	We don't need a live-action movie.
1202980	1206820	And of all of the musicals to adapt, it makes the most sense that Cats had evaded adaptation
1206820	1213020	for so long, despite its popularity.
1213340	1217220	Universal bought the film rights to Cats sometime after the Amblin production folded, and it
1217220	1220700	kind of existed in that development hell limbo ever since.
1220700	1225260	Lloyd Webber kind of hinted at something being in the works as early as 2013, but we didn't
1225260	1227460	see movement until about three years later.
1227460	1229740	So what happened in that time?
1229740	1236620	Well, Greatest Showman came along and made half a billion dollars worldwide.
1236620	1241660	Obviously, I'm not Mr. Universal, but we can surmise that Mr. Universal saw the long-in-development
1241660	1245540	Cats project and thought, hey, let's give that the go-ahead and then we too can make
1245540	1247020	half a billion dollars.
1247020	1249620	And while we're there, let's attach to it the last guy who won a bunch of Oscars
1249620	1250620	for a musical.
1250620	1251620	That's the ticket.
1251620	1254180	Half a billion dollars and Oscars.
1254180	1255500	Everybody wins.
1255500	1260100	So it does kind of feel like we're missing a step here, that a prestige musical adaptation
1260100	1262420	equals Oscar bait de facto.
1262420	1266180	For most of the early history of the Academy Awards, musicals were a major presence if
1266180	1270620	for no other reason than in the early days of talkies, musicals just made up a much larger
1270620	1272540	proportion of films that got made.
1272540	1276400	But as we covered in the episode about roadshows, the big studio musical was kind of on its
1276400	1280200	way out in the 1960s in favor of more heady experimental cinema.
1280200	1283760	But then we had a couple of big hits and more importantly, big Oscar winners in the form
1283760	1285960	of Mary Poppins and The Sound of Music.
1285960	1290460	So that created a sort of boom and bust for the musical as an awards darling, but also
1290460	1292220	for the movie musical in general.
1292220	1296460	After Hello Dolly was a critical and commercial failure, the Hollywood musical was kind of
1296460	1298320	dead for a while.
1298320	1302120	So after that you had movies like Cabaret, which while unlike big studio musicals in
1302120	1304640	most regard, did win a bunch of Oscars.
1304640	1309120	But that was kind of the end of the era of musicals as Oscar darlings.
1309120	1313520	You'd have your greases, your little shops, but they were more like popcorn movies.
1313520	1314600	They weren't awards bait.
1314600	1316600	And musicals mostly moved into animation.
1316600	1321720	Hell, the next musical after Cabaret and All That Jazz in the 70s, both directed by Bob
1321720	1325920	Fosse, to get nominated for Best Picture was Disney's Beauty and the Beast.
1329320	1334080	So fast forward to 2001, where we are still firmly in the musicals equals popcorn movies
1334080	1335080	mindset.
1335080	1337840	Diamonds are a girl's best friend.
1337840	1341040	Moulin Rouge was not designed to be an Oscar movie.
1341040	1345280	It was designed for Baz Luhrmann's Romeo plus Juliet, made a bunch of money, and he
1345280	1348120	has a budget now so let's just let him do whatever he wants.
1348120	1351000	And Moulin Rouge is an even bigger hit than Romeo plus Juliet.
1351000	1355280	Outside it may be raining, but in here it's entertaining.
1355320	1359320	Now Moulin Rouge came out around the end of May, but like Greatest Showman, it had really
1359320	1360320	good legs.
1360320	1361320	Heh.
1361320	1364680	And by the time awards season comes around, it's still in theaters, so Fox was like,
1364680	1369120	hey, let's just go ahead and do a four year consideration campaign, and boom, Best Picture
1369120	1370120	nominee.
1370120	1371440	Who would have ever thought?
1371440	1375080	Everything's going so well!
1375080	1380040	This sets the stage for the already in development Chicago, itself fueled by Harvey Weinstein's
1380040	1384240	four year consideration campaigns of attrition, and not only does Chicago win Best Picture,
1384240	1389320	but five other awards in 2003, the first musical to win Best Picture since Oliver in
1389320	1390320	1968.
1390320	1392600	Now, two things here.
1392600	1396760	One is that adaptations of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals have historically not yielded very
1396760	1402040	good results, either commercially or with regard to awards.
1402040	1408040	I mean, don't get me wrong, they try.
1408040	1412560	The most successful to date is the 1996 film adaptation of Evita, starring Madonna and
1412560	1417440	Antonio Banderas, which while not an Oscar darling, despite winning Best Original Song,
1417440	1421960	it did win a bunch of Golden Globes, including Actress for Madonna and Best Motion Picture,
1421960	1422960	Musical or Comedy.
1422960	1432560	Then, of course, there's Phantom of the Opera, which was also released in the thick of awards
1432560	1434160	season with high hopes.
1434160	1437360	It did have a pretty aggressive four year consideration campaign, and it did yield a
1437360	1442800	couple of Oscar nominations, including, bewilderingly, Cinematography.
1442800	1452480	For more on why that is terrible, watch the video I made on why it is terrible.
1452480	1457000	Second is that Cats is not structured like a Hollywood screenplay, even in relation to
1457000	1460840	other Andrew Lloyd Webber shows, which do tend to have, you know, like a plot.
1460840	1464880	So right off the bat, even in comparison to projects like Phantom of the Opera or Evita,
1464880	1469960	With Cats, they are starting at a huge disadvantage, which I suspect Mr. Universal knew for a long
1469960	1473960	time considering how long it took them to get Cats out of development hell.
1473960	1479200	How do you give this thing the structure of a Hollywood movie, while also keeping it recognizably
1479200	1480200	Cats?
1480200	1489360	I can dance how he dances too, let me see, it's easy, well, apparently you don't.
1489360	1493520	So it wasn't just the incredible, unexpected success of Greatest Showman, it was also who
1493520	1498360	directed the film, and I am absolutely 100% positive that Tom Hooper would never have
1498360	1511640	been attached to Cats if the song Memory was not Cats' biggest staple.
1511640	1515640	Ignoring Universal's aggressive For Your Consideration campaign for Les Miserables,
1515640	1520720	a movie which proved that musicals can still be Oscar darlings even into the 2010s, most
1520720	1524600	point to Anne Hathaway's rendition of I Dreamed a Dream as the thing that clinched
1524600	1527200	her an Oscar win.
1527200	1530400	So attaching Hooper to Cats was a no-brainer.
1530400	1535360	Cats has the big Oscar-winning ballad, Les Mis has the big Oscar-winning ballad, it's
1535360	1543280	just, it's some synergy.
1543280	1547680	But Les Miserables was a harbinger of things to come, and for every truly bewildering decision
1547680	1564760	that Hooper made in Cats, the warning signs were always there.
1564760	1570080	When philosopher and media theorist Marshall McLuhan famously said, the medium is the message,
1570080	1571880	what did he mean by that?
1571880	1576760	Simplistically, it's the idea that you can only receive an idea or a story through a
1577240	1585600	Be that medium a poem, a novel, a film, a stage show, or even just the act of talking.
1585600	1590520	It is not the idea or story itself that is being expressed, but a medium that is expressing
1590520	1591520	it.
1591520	1593320	Therefore, the medium should be the focus of study.
1593320	1597120	According to theater scholar Linda Hutchin, while no medium is inherently good at doing
1597120	1601860	one thing and not another, each medium, like each genre, has different means of expression
1601860	1604800	and so can aim at certain things better than others.
1604840	1607120	So let's look at Les Miserables as a case study.
1607120	1612200	You have Victor Hugo's novel Les Miserables, you have the PBS Masterpiece miniseries starring
1612200	1622600	Dominic West and David Oyelowo, and you have the Bublil and Schoenberg stage musicals.
1622600	1626920	Three different mediums telling the same story, but owing to difference in medium, they tell
1626920	1630960	them in very different ways that are designed, first and foremost, to fit their respective
1630960	1631960	medium.
1631960	1636400	So what can often happen when you have someone schooled in one medium who is suddenly having
1636400	1640440	to figure out how to most effectively do another, that can lead to some dissonance.
1640440	1645800	I think what I was trying to achieve was a combination of extreme realism so that the
1645800	1652200	film would feel rooted in a visceral reality, but also allowing a certain heightening of
1652200	1653200	reality.
1653200	1656560	We saw this in Phantom of the Opera, directed by Joel Schumacher, where there's a lot
1656560	1660760	of little things that just show him trying to make it less of a musical.
1660760	1669760	Like having them speak singing lines that don't make sense to speak sing, and then
1669760	1678200	having Butler scream half his lines instead of singing them.
1678200	1683080	And this, of course, works both ways.
1683080	1687840	The Producers, the 2005 film, was directed by Susan Stroman, who also directed the Broadway
1687840	1688840	stage show.
1688920	1692120	The Producer shows us what it's like when a stage director is uncomfortable working
1692120	1693720	in the format of film.
1693720	1697200	People who've never seen this show but did see the movie, an adaptation which is faithful
1697200	1701760	to a fault because it's basically just the stage show, are like, that's it?
1701760	1708920	That's the winningest, toniest show ever?
1708920	1712360	But this film version is emblematic of how medium matters.
1712360	1716040	So much that worked on the stage and led the producers to win the most tonies of any musical
1716040	1729360	by a single production in history, just didn't translate to film.
1729360	1731400	Quoting film scholar Robert Stamm,
1731400	1733960	Film clearly has resources that the stage can never have.
1733960	1737360	The power of the close-up that gives the micro-drama of the human countenance and the separate
1737360	1741440	soundtracks of film that permit voice-overs, music, and the non-vocal to intermingle.
1741440	1742440	Linda Hutcheon adds,
1742440	1746800	And, when we sit quiet and still, in the dark watching real live bodies on the stage, our
1746800	1750760	kind of identification is different from when we sit in front of a screen and have the reality
1750760	1753160	mediated for us by technology.
1753160	1757760	So live theater naturally requires way more suspension of disbelief than film does.
1757760	1762840	You are in the same room with these people, you have to applaud after every musical number,
1762840	1766800	you can see the sets, you can see that the snow isn't real.
1766800	1770680	The actors are probably pantomiming like half of a set that isn't there.
1770720	1774200	But the medium of film works against that necessary suspension of disbelief.
1774200	1778200	I'd rather just sing.
1778200	1780200	Stop that, stop that.
1780200	1782360	You're not going into a song while I'm here.
1782360	1784800	And must be adjusted for with stylism.
1784800	1788600	That's why musicals tend to work better as animated movies than live action movies.
1788600	1794800	An animated movie requires more suspension of disbelief because this isn't real, it's a drawing.
1794800	1796600	Why was everyone singing?
1796600	1798520	We've just got a song in our hearts.
1798520	1802360	And therefore it fits more easily with the requirements of believing that these characters
1802360	1804120	might suddenly just burst into song.
1804120	1806120	How is it you all know the words?
1806120	1807120	Did you rehearse?
1807120	1808120	Yeah, every Thursday.
1808120	1811040	Didn't you see the flyers?
1811040	1815680	Of course, film directors do sometimes figure out ways to bridge this gap gracefully.
1815680	1817240	Chicago springs to mind.
1817240	1821000	It manages to work with the realism of the tone while incorporating the more theatrical
1821000	1824600	framing, all while making it work within its own internal logic.
1824600	1829880	And sometimes other movie musicals just don't care about how realistic or not the framing
1829880	1834360	is, and they just don't bother caring about that.
1834360	1836360	The Mamma Mia's are a good example.
1836360	1839480	They are not going for high art, and that's fine.
1839480	1844040	But part of the tilt toward realism in film is because the Academy tends to reward a more
1844040	1845680	realistic style.
1845680	1848280	Not always, but overall.
1848280	1852960	And for those of you out there who argue that Tom Hooper's style is actually kind of weird,
1852960	1857600	strange angles and lots of dead space of exposed brick and wallpaper does not an unrealistically
1857600	1859000	styled film make.
1859000	1862800	Yes, Hooper does use a lot of unsettling visual language, and I'll get to that in a minute,
1862800	1867320	but that doesn't mean that groundedness in realism isn't ultimately what he's going for.
1867320	1871800	So in addition to a sort of stylistic discomfort with musicals in general, there's also incentive
1871800	1875560	to make the visual style of the film more realistic.
1875560	1878800	So his proclivity for dragging the medium of the musical kicking and screaming into
1878800	1883360	the style of realism preferred by the Oscars, it was only a matter of time before he slipped
1883360	1886360	into the Uncanny Valley.
1886360	1891280	So the tactic with Les Mis' visual language was, in part, visual realism.
1891280	1895560	But in addition to that, in order to make it feel more immediate and more realistic,
1895560	1906280	Hooper also elected to use set sound, recording the actors as they sang.
1906280	1910520	Other than the more traditional way of doing it, by having the actors sing along to playback.
1910520	1914760	Hooper went to very great lengths to make the performance feel more authentic.
1914760	1919960	By recording it live, Tom is allowing us the spontaneity of normal film acting.
1919960	1922360	And it was a great gimmick to sell to Academy voters.
1922360	1925880	So the medium of musical theater, which in the case of Les Mis and Cats requires the
1925880	1930440	cast to be singing the whole time, already requires a much higher degree of suspension
1930440	1932160	of disbelief than film does.
1932160	1936680	And not just realistic, actively at war with the big emotions of the music.
1936680	1941840	You have extreme close-ups, constantly, for three hours, on actors who are singing songs
1941840	1943640	designed to play to cheap seats.
1943640	1950060	Well, he did, Les Mis is bad, but it won some awards.
1950060	1958760	So even though the main impact of that movie is in Le Chauvet memes.
1958760	1962920	The formula, according to Universal, appears to be Tom Hooper plus Beloved Classic Musical
1962920	1964480	equals profit.
1964480	1967720	So that's how we got here.
1967720	1969640	Let's see what we got.
1969640	1981800	I don't know what I expected.
1981800	1986100	Although I will attempt to find rationale, if not reason, in the film version of Cats,
1986100	1992740	there are many bewildering choices that I can only attribute to Hooperian whimsy.
1992740	1997300	From horny Judi Dench scissoring in delight after Gus the theater cat, to Jennifer Hudson
1997300	2001740	spending most of her screen time in close-ups with her face covered in snot, to McCavity
2001740	2005540	being played the way that he is.
2005540	2011580	How do you manage to make Idris Elba unappealing?
2011580	2015260	The aspect of the film that drew the most attention, positive and negative, after that
2015300	2019300	first trailer was released was the uncanny valley-ness of it all, which all goes back
2019300	2023780	to Hooper's attempts to draw this weird fantastical show back down to realism.
2023780	2025420	Said Hooper in an interview for The Atlantic,
2025420	2028540	I wanted to keep it very grounded in the present moment.
2028540	2032420	The thing I'm most proud of is that you feel grounded watching it.
2032420	2034860	It's not that fantastical.
2034860	2038980	Which... it's Cats, dude.
2038980	2044020	Blame has been laid upon the visual effects team, which...
2044020	2054660	Nobody more than us understands the importance of good visual effects.
2054660	2056580	Okay let's talk about that for a moment.
2056580	2061260	We've used digital fur technology to create the most perfect covering of fur.
2061260	2066180	So Hooper wanted the film to be grounded and not that fantastical, and part of that was
2066180	2071700	wanting his actors to be X amount of unencumbered, and also to shoot on practical sets.
2071700	2073500	A weird scale.
2073500	2076620	So he elected that they should not use mocap suits.
2076620	2081540	Despite the fact that the suits they did wear looked plenty ridiculous, allegedly, this
2081540	2085380	is hearsay, no one has gone on the record to say this, Hooper didn't want his actors
2085380	2087420	distracted or encumbered.
2087420	2089300	So no mocap suits.
2089300	2093740	So all of the digital fur technology had to be done manually, which not only ballooned
2093740	2098420	the post-production budget, it massively increased the labor required to finish it.
2098420	2103300	But after the trailer hit, allegedly, again this is through my grapevine, Mr. Universal
2103300	2107060	kind of panicked and slashed the funding going to post-production.
2107060	2112900	And that, in part, is why you get these shots that look, well, kind of bad.
2112900	2116620	And why you've got like these floating faces, and why there are some shots that aren't
2116620	2117620	even finished.
2117620	2122180	So when you hear horror stories of the VFX team for Cats being underfunded and understaffed
2122180	2126700	and overworked, allegedly, again no one has gone on the record to discuss this in any
2126700	2130180	meaningful detail because they don't want to lose their jobs, so this is all hearsay,
2130180	2131540	this is the result.
2131540	2136020	So the manually rotoscoped digital fur technology, the slashed budget, and Hooper's bizarre
2136020	2141300	insistence on making changes up to the 11th hour, in part, leads us here.
2141300	2146460	But even if it had gotten the time and money it needed, could this have worked visually?
2146460	2149460	Would this have worked for audiences?
2149460	2151980	Probably not.
2151980	2156380	Hooper's dedication to making the movie feel grounded backfired horribly, no matter
2156380	2158500	how much time the VFX team had.
2158500	2162020	These decisions were all rooted in trying to bridge that realism gap, so much so that
2162020	2166740	certain elements are somehow both overthought and underthought at the same time.
2166740	2172500	The film's approach to the titular animal is both way more literal and way more dense
2172500	2173740	at the same time.
2173740	2177940	One wonders if any of these people have ever even seen a cat.
2177940	2181900	The film adds way more literal cat things that aren't even there in the show, like
2181900	2187380	their ears move around, they crawl around on all fours and paw at each other, they lap
2187380	2192940	at things, and go meow meow meow.
2192940	2197500	Gillian Lynn's choreography in the show is designed to be, like, more evocative of
2197500	2201940	the idea of a cat, not a literal imitation of a cat.
2201940	2205460	But here we are, not ten minutes in, and we got a crotch-lickin' joke.
2205460	2206460	I'm a kitty.
2206460	2207460	Meow.
2207460	2208460	Meow.
2208460	2211620	And all of this adds up to create a suspension of disbelief problem that isn't there in
2211620	2212620	the musical.
2212620	2216100	There are not humans in the musical, for instance, but here they are at the beginning of the
2216100	2217100	film.
2217100	2219260	We see them before we see any cats.
2219260	2220820	Humans with their human bodies.
2220820	2222300	Throwing away a kitten in a bag.
2222300	2224100	Who also has a human body?
2224100	2228620	But as in Les Mis, Hooper just doesn't seem comfortable or particularly interested in
2228620	2230380	the medium of the musical.
2230380	2232380	The breaking of the fourth wall, for instance.
2232380	2233380	Pretty common in musicals.
2233700	2236700	Are you blind when you're born?
2236700	2240700	We see this in Les Mis in a scene where, in the musical, Gavroche is addressing the audience.
2240700	2241700	How do you do?
2241700	2242700	My name's Gavroche.
2242700	2243700	These are my people.
2243700	2244700	Here's my patch.
2244700	2250700	But we can't have that, so in the movie, he addresses some random rich dude.
2250700	2251700	How do you do?
2251700	2252700	My name's Gavroche.
2252700	2253700	These are my people.
2253700	2254700	Here's my patch.
2254700	2259700	But then in the following line, he addresses the audience anyway, so...
2259700	2262700	There was a time we killed the king.
2263020	2265020	We tried to change the world too fast.
2265020	2268740	Cats the Musical breaks the fourth wall a lot more than Les Mis.
2268740	2269740	The cats address the audience.
2269740	2272060	They explain things to the audience.
2272060	2274700	They interact with the audience physically.
2274700	2278340	But we can't have that, so the movie gets around this by making Victoria the fish out
2278340	2279340	of water.
2279340	2282860	They explain the jellicle thing to her instead of the audience.
2282860	2283860	So cutting this...
2283860	2290460	Do I actually see with my own very eyes?
2290460	2294860	A man who's not heard of a jellicle cat.
2294860	2298220	Sets up in the movie that fourth wall breaking is not a thing that is done here.
2298220	2299940	Which, you know what, fine.
2299940	2301860	It's a movie, not a stage show.
2301860	2306460	So then they hold to this change for the whole movie until the end when they have Dench address
2306460	2309460	the camera for like five minutes straight.
2309460	2317300	You've heard of several kinds of cats should need no interpreter.
2317300	2323100	To understand the cats are very much like you.
2323100	2329500	You've seen us both, our habits and our habitat.
2329500	2344340	But how would you know first your memory and say a cat is not a dog.
2344340	2349380	With cats, some say one rule is true.
2349380	2357540	A cat will condescend to treat you are spoken to myself.
2357540	2358540	I do not.
2358540	2373100	Oh, for a cat will condescend to treat you dish of cream or you might now and then.
2373100	2381540	And so in time you reach your aim and call him by his name.
2381540	2386380	Movie adaptations also often change the arrangements of songs, which again, fine.
2386380	2390620	But in Cats, it just feels like Hooper did it because he was bored with them.
2390620	2393780	The Rum Tum Tugger is one of the show's most high energy numbers.
2393780	2401060	And Derulo is actually a pretty good Rum Tum Tugger, except for that accent.
2401060	2411820	So why, God why, do we keep interrupting this number for Rebel Wilson's bad improv?
2411820	2417540	In the very next scene, we interrupt Bustopher Jones for more Rebel Wilson shenanigans.
2417540	2422740	Anyway, back to the song.
2422740	2427540	Even during Skimbleshanks, the best number in the movie, a mouse yells CATS.
2427540	2430800	Yep, that's what we're watching.
2430800	2434120	These things wouldn't be bad in and of themselves except that they don't add anything.
2434120	2437520	It's like he's breaking up the musical numbers because he feels like they're too
2437520	2447520	boring to stand on their own without something to break them up.
2447520	2451280	The filmmakers' discomfort slash disinterest with the material expands beyond just the
2451280	2454040	medium of the musical and the show that they're adapting itself.
2454040	2458600	There's a patent rejection of anything non-heteronormative that's pretty overt to anyone familiar with
2458600	2459920	the stage musical.
2460040	2462560	There is a lot of no-homo in this movie.
2462560	2464120	Romantical cats.
2464120	2468720	Yeah, God forbid that this guy be clocked as anything but the straightest manly man.
2468720	2472840	It is often played in the musical that Mistoffelees and Rum Tum Tugger have like a little something
2472840	2473840	going on.
2473840	2477920	The Rum Tum Tugger is a terrible bore.
2477920	2478920	And we can't have that.
2478920	2482920	So both of them get their no-homo moments with Victoria.
2482920	2484920	VICTORIA!
2485920	2491920	And Mistoffelees gets it in the form of an all-out subplot.
2491920	2494920	I'm coming, Victoria!
2494920	2498520	For all the other terrible cat puns and figures of speech that they added in the movie, I'm
2498520	2501920	surprised they didn't add something about how Rum Tum Tugger loves da pussy.
2501920	2503920	Romantical cats.
2503920	2507920	Heterosexual cats, heterosexual cats, heterosexual cats.
2507920	2512920	But if there's one scene that was always doomed to failure, or wild success depending
2512920	2518920	on how you look at it, in anything live-action or remotely realistic, it is the old Gumby
2518920	2519920	Cat sequence.
2519920	2525920	I have a Gumby Cat in mind.
2525920	2529920	Her name is Jenny Any Dots.
2529920	2534920	Wherein we hear about the titular Gumby Cat, who lays around all day but at night teaches
2534920	2538920	mice and other vermin to like, you know, be upstanding members of society.
2539920	2544920	The show accomplishes this with pantomime and props that are like, you know, garbage
2544920	2549920	from the junkyard that the cats are hanging out in, made to look like, you know, mice.
2549920	2553920	There are multiple times in the show where the cats pantomime other animals and objects,
2553920	2560920	like mice and dogs and roaches and choo-choo trains, by appropriating trash and turning
2560920	2561920	it into props and such.
2561920	2565920	Now they could have done that, but realism.
2565920	2567920	So instead we get this.
2567920	2577920	And it just keeps escalating and getting more and more horrifying.
2584920	2587920	I can't even make commentary on this so I'm not gonna.
2587920	2591920	Except, why god why did they give the mice children's faces?
2597920	2598920	End of show.
2607920	2611920	From the moment the trailer came out, my biggest question was how would they try to give cats
2611920	2613920	the shape of a Hollywood movie?
2613920	2617920	I kind of deep down thought that they'd be smarter than that and just wouldn't bother.
2617920	2621920	Like, they'd just let it keep its review-like qualities and have it be something kind of
2621920	2624920	disjointed in the vein of Fantasia.
2624920	2627920	But, wow, did they fly wildly in the other direction.
2635920	2639920	Structuring the film with not one storyline from the musical on steroids, but two.
2639920	2644920	The first is the enormously expanded part of Victoria, who's the protagonist now,
2644920	2647920	and the emotional through-line of Grizabella.
2647920	2652920	A kitten with one brief dance solo in the show and no songs, the film gives her a little
2652920	2656920	orphan abandoned in the world of the Jellicle Cats narrative and takes this moment from
2656920	2660920	the stage show and makes it the emotional through-line of the movie.
2660920	2666920	And I'm not saying this is handled gracefully in the show, but the movie tries to bolster it
2666920	2669920	and in doing so reveals the whole thing's weaknesses.
2669920	2674920	It is distantly implied in the show, but stated outright in the movie.
2674920	2677920	Why is Grizabella shunned by the other Jellicle Cats?
2683920	2685920	Then she went with Macavity.
2685920	2686920	Macavity?
2686920	2687920	Macavity!
2687920	2692920	Trying to add a little more logic to her story is not the most counterintuitive change in the world,
2692920	2695920	but it does conflict with the other big change they made.
2695920	2696920	Macavity.
2696920	2697920	Meow!
2697920	2702920	Macavity is like an obstacle that shows up towards the end of the show, like earlier
2702920	2707920	some cats titter hearing about him and then later he shows up, he kidnaps old Deuteronomy,
2707920	2710920	they immediately undo it and no one ever speaks of it again.
2710920	2712920	And again, I'm not saying that this is good.
2712920	2719920	It is charitably flimsy and Macavity is not really an antagonist, more of like a thing that happens.
2719920	2725920	The tension of the story, if it can be said to have one, is just the question of who gets to die.
2725920	2726920	Who gets to die the good death?
2726920	2731920	Macavity in the show doesn't really care about this, but in the movie...
2731920	2735920	I'm determined to win and I prefer my competition chained up.
2735920	2739920	Wow, it's his life's goal, that heavy side layer.
2739920	2740920	Why?
2740920	2741920	Because.
2741920	2742920	Meow!
2742920	2746920	And then, as if all this doesn't make you want to crawl out of your skin enough...
2746920	2750920	The Napoleon of Crime!
2750920	2752920	Ha ha ha!
2754920	2756920	Ah ha ha!
2756920	2759920	Macavity! Macavity!
2759920	2762920	Okay, so Macavity is the color of Idris Elba.
2762920	2767920	Like, couldn't they just make him like a black cat or give him some stripes or something?
2767920	2769920	I get that that could be problematic,
2769920	2773920	but I don't think that the only alternative is to tumble head over ass into the uncanny valley
2773920	2776920	by creating a cat that's just the color of human skin.
2776920	2778920	Which is itself kind of revealing.
2778920	2780920	Like, imagine if one of the white actors had the same treatment.
2780920	2783920	Just a cat the color of human skin.
2783920	2787920	Would they have not caught this for the uncanny valley yikes that it is?
2787920	2790920	He's a fiend, he likes shit!
2790920	2794920	So Macavity's function in the movie is to remove the other cats from the competition
2794920	2796920	so he will be the jellicle choice.
2796920	2799920	Despite the fact that he seems to be doing pretty well in this life,
2799920	2801920	but whatever, he wants a new one.
2801920	2804920	Macavity also serves the dual purpose of extracting your A-list celebrities
2804920	2808920	who wanted to be in the movie but didn't want to be on set for more than three days.
2808920	2809920	Macavity!
2809920	2813920	So he ferrets his kidnapped celebrity cats, and also skimbleshanks,
2813920	2817920	to a boat which is manned by Ray Winstone, who is also a cat.
2820920	2822920	And despite Macavity's magical powers,
2822920	2825920	once they, I don't know, get bored of being tied up with a large chain,
2825920	2829920	they escape easily, they get back just in time for memory,
2829920	2831920	and then this happens.
2837920	2841920	Anyway, so when Grizabella shows up at the end after the whole boat fight,
2841920	2844920	it's like, well the movie's already had its climax.
2844920	2847920	We got old dude back, why are we still here?
2847920	2850920	Oh right, the heavy side layer, the big climax.
2850920	2853920	Making the Macavity subplot more of a focus leads to the resolution of that subplot
2853920	2857920	getting way more screen time and involving way more characters.
2857920	2860920	And it gives it the feel of the climax of the movie.
2860920	2862920	But it's not. Memory is the climax.
2862920	2866920	So the film builds in a new climax on the boat.
2866920	2869920	Growltiger, make her walk the plank.
2870920	2872920	While also keeping the original one.
2872920	2874920	Jennifer Hudson is such a good singer that, like,
2874920	2878920	I've never not watched this scene and gotten chills.
2878920	2881920	Touch me.
2881920	2886920	No, even leave me.
2886920	2888920	Like, the arrangement and mixing are so good
2888920	2891920	that even in the two rowdy screenings I've gone to,
2891920	2893920	the audience reverently listens to this bit.
2893920	2897920	The plot was always paper-thin and flimsy, and it was that by design.
2897920	2900920	But the film doesn't make the plot, such as it were, less flimsy,
2900920	2902920	it just creates more of it,
2902920	2905920	and more nonsense that the film obligates itself to explain,
2905920	2908920	because we have committed ourselves to the style of realism and logic.
2910920	2913920	But ultimately, if you want to ask the question of why Cats is the way it is,
2913920	2916920	Cats is the story of hubris.
2916920	2919920	Awards hubris. Celebrity hubris. Director hubris.
2919920	2922920	Just good old-fashioned hubris.
2922920	2925920	Like Les Mis, they wanted to have an all-star cast.
2925920	2927920	But Cats is a terrible thing to adapt for big stars,
2927920	2929920	because, unlike Les Mis,
2929920	2932920	it requires its cast to more or less be on stage the whole time,
2932920	2935920	as opposed to Les Mis, where you can have Anne Hathaway
2935920	2937920	for her 20 minutes of award-winning screen time,
2937920	2939920	and then she's out for the rest of the movie.
2939920	2941920	Cats is not designed like this.
2941920	2944920	You're either a cat that has a solo, or a cat that is in the ensemble,
2944920	2946920	but you're on stage more or less the whole time.
2946920	2949920	Most of the songs don't have the cats singing about themselves,
2949920	2951920	but another cat doing the singing.
2951920	2957920	Gus is the cat at the theater door.
2957920	2961920	The movie changes this by having them half the time just singing about themselves.
2961920	2966920	Gus is the cat at the theater door.
2966920	2968920	Gus the theater cat, Bustopher Jones,
2968920	2971920	and especially the old Gumby Cat come to mind,
2971920	2974920	as songs that were changed to give the stars more screen time.
2974920	2978920	Don't get cocky!
2978920	2981920	Because they certainly were not changed because the arrangement was better.
2981920	2984920	And wow do they fuck up the old Gumby Cat by giving this song...
2984920	2987920	When the deed's hustle and bustle is done,
2987920	2990920	Then the Gumby Cat's work is but honey begun.
2990920	2993920	...to Rebel Wilson, who is not only not a great singer...
2993920	2996920	When the deed's hustle and bustle is done,
2996920	2998920	Then the Gumby Cat's work...
2998920	3000920	It also nixes a three-part harmony.
3000920	3003920	Because if you want Rebel Wilson in this movie for 20 minutes,
3003920	3006920	she gots to gets her a solo.
3006920	3014920	But I...
3014920	3018920	Or in the case of Macavity, they take a duet and make it a solo,
3018920	3021920	because Taylor Swift is not sharing the stage, my friends.
3021920	3024920	So what do we do with a bunch of celebrities that want solos
3024920	3026920	and want to be in the movie?
3026920	3028920	Because it's got the awards guy attached to it, see?
3028920	3030920	So it's gonna win awards.
3030920	3033920	But they don't wanna, you know, be on set for more than like three days.
3033920	3035920	Corden's got his talk show to work around.
3035920	3037920	Taylor Swift's on tour.
3037920	3040920	You know what? We can't be bothered by being on set for more than three days.
3040920	3045920	Well, how about Macavity kidnaps the A-listers?
3045920	3046920	Ineffable.
3046920	3050920	This not only solves our problem of not really having a threat or tension,
3050920	3053920	it also means that we have a real solid good reason
3053920	3055920	for these people not being in the background
3055920	3058920	when they are not the center of attention.
3058920	3061920	So not only do we now have a lazy reason to get our A-listers
3061920	3063920	who don't want to be in the background out of the movie,
3063920	3065920	we also made the movie worse.
3065920	3066920	Macavity!
3066920	3067920	Go team.
3067920	3069920	And no awards hubris musical would be complete
3069920	3072920	without the unnecessary new song.
3073920	3077920	But at least you have beautiful ghosts.
3077920	3079920	This one's called Beautiful Ghost.
3079920	3083920	It was co-written by Taylor Swift and Andrew Lloyd Webber.
3083920	3085920	You can't write a modern lyric for cats.
3085920	3090920	So, like, if you can't get T.S. Eliot, like, get T.S.
3090920	3095920	And it, like all of these musical numbers added to the movie to win an award,
3095920	3099920	is completely unnecessary and totally grinds the movie to a halt.
3099920	3101920	You know, more than it already was.
3101920	3106920	I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts.
3106920	3108920	If Francesca Hayward sounds kind of unsure,
3108920	3111920	it's because she doesn't really know the song,
3111920	3114920	because they more or less finished it, like, the day of.
3114920	3115920	We were just rushing.
3115920	3117920	We had written it the day before.
3117920	3120920	I came in and we had the sheet music made up.
3120920	3122920	Like an hour or two before they shot it.
3122920	3123920	It's a dreadful day.
3123920	3124920	Terrible.
3125920	3129920	Taylor Swift over here looking at Lady Gaga, Oscar winner, like,
3129920	3130920	I want that.
3130920	3132920	One step closer to EGOT.
3132920	3135920	And her singing it got us a Golden Globe nomination.
3135920	3136920	Wow.
3138920	3141920	So what, in the end, is the fallout of Cats?
3141920	3144920	Are we going to have a bunch of cats copy Cats?
3144920	3147920	Is Cats going to be like the Sharknado of musicals?
3147920	3148920	Well, I doubt it.
3148920	3151920	First of all, Cats is kind of one of a kind.
3152920	3155920	It was a massive, massive loss.
3155920	3158920	And despite the fact that it's probably going to be
3158920	3160920	the new darling of midnight screenings
3160920	3163920	and supplant the likes of Rocky Horror in the room
3163920	3164920	with its cult following,
3164920	3165920	Hi, doggie.
3165920	3167920	these are not the tracks that any other studios
3167920	3168920	are going to want to follow in.
3168920	3170920	But I have heard some concern
3170920	3173920	that this might kind of be the end of musical movies.
3173920	3175920	In an Entertainment Weekly article,
3175920	3178920	conflicted theater fan Mark Snitiker wrote,
3178920	3181920	I fear a similar turmoil that happened in the 80s may occur again,
3181920	3183920	because Cats is, at its core,
3183920	3186920	a musical that confirms for people who hate musicals
3186920	3188920	why they hate musicals.
3188920	3190920	But though we did not ask for it,
3190920	3191920	though we are not responsible for it,
3191920	3193920	though we need not answer for it,
3193920	3196920	I believe theater fans must not abandon Cats.
3196920	3197920	Because as much as we may hate it,
3197920	3199920	we can't deny that we care about it.
3199920	3201920	You care about it.
3201920	3206920	But how would you address a cat?
3206920	3208920	Here is the thing.
3208920	3210920	Some musicals, not all,
3211920	3214920	but most of them require a visual medium
3214920	3217920	that jives with the way that the musical itself is constructed.
3217920	3220920	Les Misérables was constructed for the stage.
3220920	3223920	Cats was constructed for the stage.
3223920	3225920	That is the thing about theater,
3225920	3227920	especially in a show like Hamilton,
3227920	3230920	which basically has no props, let alone a set.
3230920	3232920	It is constructed so that the audience
3232920	3234920	has to imagine what's going on in the story.
3234920	3236920	Overcoming that suspension of disbelief
3236920	3239920	is built into the design of the medium
3239920	3241920	in a way that it is not with film.
3241920	3243920	But your traditional Oscar-bait movie
3243920	3244920	does not allow for that.
3244920	3246920	Oscar-bait movies demand visual realism,
3246920	3248920	and it's very rare that something actually
3248920	3250920	gets rewarded for being stylistic.
3250920	3251920	It happens,
3251920	3254920	but the Academy prefers gritty realism right now.
3254920	3255920	That's just how it is.
3255920	3257920	To this idea that there might be a backlash
3257920	3258920	against musical films,
3258920	3261920	that Cats might be the end of Hollywood
3261920	3262920	taking musicals seriously,
3262920	3265920	to that I say, good.
3266920	3268920	Good f***ing riddance, Tom Hooper,
3268920	3271920	and your musical awards-bait bullshit.
3271920	3273920	Popular musical being adapted to films
3273920	3276920	because Oscar-bait is a disease.
3276920	3277920	The only way movies like this work
3277920	3279920	is either through hyper-stylization
3279920	3280920	in the vein of decent films
3280920	3282920	like Moulin Rouge or Chicago,
3282920	3283920	or animation,
3283920	3284920	which likewise can rise visually
3284920	3286920	to the magical unrealism
3286920	3288920	inherent to the medium of musicals.
3288920	3290920	But gritty realism?
3290920	3291920	Oscar-bait?
3291920	3292920	No thank.
3292920	3294920	Like, I love Hamilton, but Hamilton the movie?
3294920	3298920	I will kill your friends and family.
3299920	3300920	Please no.
3300920	3302920	Yes, I will gladly take your live recording
3302920	3304920	that you filmed five years ago
3304920	3305920	and won't release till next year.
3305920	3306920	I will take it.
3306920	3308920	But the Oscar-bait musical,
3308920	3311920	the adaptation for adaptation's sake?
3311920	3313920	Let it burn.
3313920	3314920	Musical theater right now
3314920	3316920	is kind of in a new golden age.
3316920	3317920	It is doing just fine,
3317920	3320920	and it does not need legitimacy from Hollywood.
3320920	3323920	We do not need film adaptations of musicals
3323920	3324920	just cause,
3324920	3326920	just because it's brand name recognition,
3326920	3329920	just because Chicago won a bunch of Oscars.
3329920	3331920	So if Cats marks a demarcation
3331920	3332920	where musicals aren't being adapted
3332920	3334920	for the screen anymore?
3336920	3337920	Good.
3337920	3339920	I don't want Hadestown the movie.
3339920	3342920	Super do not want Hamilton the movie.
3342920	3343920	If you watch any one of these
3343920	3345920	amateur animatics on YouTube,
3345920	3347920	I promise you they work way better
3347920	3349920	than anything Tom Hooper has ever done.
3349920	3351920	So thank you, Cats.
3351920	3352920	Thank you not only for being
3352920	3355920	the true embodiment of modern horror,
3355920	3357920	a monument to celebrity hubris,
3357920	3359920	but also for ending this nonsense
3359920	3360920	of bad musical adaptations
3360920	3363920	with aggressive four-year consideration campaigns
3363920	3364920	and Oscar dreams.
3364920	3366920	Wow, we don't need it.
3366920	3368920	Just save everybody a lot of heartache and money
3368920	3370920	and just film the damn thing.
3370920	3372920	Cats 98 will always be there,
3372920	3375920	but Cats 2019 is a cautionary tale
3375920	3377920	of a completely different sort.
3382920	3385920	Someone is smoking over there.
3385920	3388920	Something we cats would never do.
3388920	3391920	Filling their lungs with thick, dark hair.
3391920	3393920	What a disgusting thing to do.
3393920	3396920	Cats have nine lives with eight to spare.
3396920	3397920	Humans have one.
3397920	3399920	With none to barter.
3399920	3400920	Why do they smoke?
3400920	3401920	Why don't they care?
3401920	3404920	Humans are smart, but cats are smarter.
3404920	3406920	Listen to Cats, you men.
3406920	3407920	Listen to Cats, you men.
3407920	3409920	Listen to Cats, you men.
3409920	3411920	Listen to Cats, you men.
3411920	3414920	Cats, you men and women, take care of your lungs.
3414920	3416920	They're only human.
3416920	3417920	The American Lung Association.
3417920	3419920	The Christmas Seal People.
3421920	3422920	An accident.
3422920	3423920	An accident.
3423920	3424920	An accident.
3424920	3426920	The humans had an accident.
3426920	3428920	There was a child in the car.
3428920	3429920	A child.
3429920	3430920	A child?
3430920	3431920	A child?
3431920	3434920	Cats have nine lives, children only one.
3434920	3436920	Help them live that life.
3436920	3438920	Buckle them into a car seat.
3438920	3441920	No one wants a child to become a memory.
3441920	3448920	Memory, all alone in the moonlight.
