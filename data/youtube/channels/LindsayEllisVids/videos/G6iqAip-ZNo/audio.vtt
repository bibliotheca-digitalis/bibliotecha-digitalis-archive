WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.920
I listened to it all and I said Andrew, is this something I don't get? Is this about

00:07.920 --> 00:14.480
Queen Victoria? She's the main cat and Disraeli and Gladstone are other cats and then there

00:14.480 --> 00:24.640
are poor cats. Am I missing this? And he took a terrible, painful long pause and said Hal,

00:24.640 --> 00:28.400
it's about cats and we never discussed it again.

00:45.280 --> 00:50.200
In 2012, New York Times food critic Pete Wells published a review of Food Network Personality

00:50.200 --> 00:57.800
and Human Can of Bud Light Lime, Guy Fieri's massive Times Square restaurant, Guy Fieri's

00:57.800 --> 01:01.560
American Kitchen and Bar, fittingly located right across the street from the Majestic

01:01.560 --> 01:06.600
Theater, which at the time had hosted Phantom of the Opera on Broadway for nearly 25 years.

01:06.600 --> 01:10.160
And while some eight years later, we've come full circle to where we've all decided that

01:10.160 --> 01:14.400
Guy Fieri is both prime meme fodder and also good now.

01:14.400 --> 01:28.560
2012 was a different time, and Wells' review pulled no punches.

01:28.560 --> 01:32.960
Guy Fieri, have you eaten at your new restaurant in Times Square? Did panic grip your soul

01:32.960 --> 01:37.160
as you stared into the whirling hypno-wheel of the menu, where adjectives and nouns spin

01:37.160 --> 01:42.840
a crazy vortex, when you saw the burger described as Guy's Pat LaFrieda Custom Blend All Natural

01:42.840 --> 01:48.160
Creekstone Farm Black Angus Beef Patty, L-Top, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, and Pickle, SMC, Super

01:48.160 --> 01:52.160
Melted Cheese, and a slathering of donkey sauce on garlic buttered brioche, did your

01:52.160 --> 01:55.880
mind touch the void for a minute? Hey, did you try that blue drink, the one that glows

01:55.880 --> 02:00.760
like nuclear waste, the watermelon margarita? Any idea why it tastes like some combination

02:00.760 --> 02:06.040
of radiator fluid and formaldehyde? What is going on at this new restaurant of yours,

02:06.040 --> 02:07.040
really?

02:07.040 --> 02:11.400
And in a way that food reviews seldom do, Wells' piece blew up and went viral, with

02:11.400 --> 02:15.160
everyone sharing it to their Facebook and Twitter timelines, cheering and celebrating

02:15.160 --> 02:20.620
the epic pwnage of Guy Fieri, that sun-drenched, frosted-tipped buffoon, by one of the most

02:20.620 --> 02:24.560
widely circulated newspapers in the world. And while rubbernecking trash fires has been

02:24.560 --> 02:28.760
a time-honored tradition as long as civilization has been a thing, the commodification of our

02:28.760 --> 02:33.800
need to see trash being eviscerated by the critic intelligentsia has become an ever-evolving

02:33.800 --> 02:39.480
industry. One can, after all, easily elevate their online brand with a well-timed takedown.

02:39.720 --> 02:46.000
There's no mist in the galaxy? Ding! That's not Earth! Fake! Ding!

02:46.000 --> 02:50.400
And with Tom Hooper's 2019 trainwreck adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical of the

02:50.400 --> 02:54.200
same name, there was blood in the water.

02:54.200 --> 02:59.960
Watching Cats is like stumbling upon an unholy and hit-you-for-unknown genre of porn. Every

02:59.960 --> 03:04.880
time these horny fur demons tongue a milk bowl and start moaning, I was certain the

03:04.880 --> 03:06.720
FBI would raid the theater.

03:06.720 --> 03:12.160
It's loud to report that Cats is everything you'd hoped for and more, a mesmerizingly

03:12.160 --> 03:17.160
ugly fiasco that makes you feel like your brain is being eaten by a parasite, a viewing

03:17.160 --> 03:20.680
experience so stressful that it honestly brought on a migraine.

03:20.680 --> 03:26.200
Can you make a movie so bad that the Academy takes back your Best Director Oscar? Asking

03:26.200 --> 03:27.200
for a Tom Hooper.

03:27.200 --> 03:31.320
By the time I left the theater, I wasn't even sure what a real cat looked like anymore.

03:31.320 --> 03:37.360
To assess Cats as good or bad feels like the entirely wrong axis on which to see it.

03:37.360 --> 03:40.280
It is, with all affection, a monstrosity.

03:40.280 --> 03:45.120
I am not a cat person. Second off, after watching this frankly mortifying film adaptation of

03:45.120 --> 03:49.520
Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats, I'm not altogether sure I am a movie person anymore either.

03:49.520 --> 03:54.540
Finally, a whole new generation can discover that Cats the musical is two hours of human-feline

03:54.540 --> 03:59.800
hybrids without genitals, having no touch sex, and begging for death via song.

03:59.800 --> 04:03.560
Cats is the worst thing to happen to cats since dogs.

04:03.560 --> 04:07.280
Cats is pure nightmare fuel. The rejects from the Island of Dr. Mero putting on a show is

04:07.280 --> 04:12.640
bad enough, but add to that more crotch shots than a Michael Bay movie and every imaginable

04:12.640 --> 04:17.480
pun and that still won't prepare you for the hellscape that is children's faces CGI'd

04:17.480 --> 04:18.480
onto mice.

04:18.480 --> 04:25.600
For the most part, Cats is both a horror and an endurance test. A dispatch from some neon-drenched

04:25.600 --> 04:31.080
netherworld where the ghastly is inextricable from the tedious.

04:31.080 --> 04:34.920
I felt the light inside me slowly fading.

04:34.920 --> 04:36.920
Oh god, my eyes!

04:40.800 --> 04:47.000
Are you blind when you're born? Can you see in the dark?

04:47.000 --> 04:51.400
I was one of the very first people to see Cats, the movie, the musical, if Tom Hooper

04:51.400 --> 04:55.520
is to be believed, some 24 hours after the film was even finished.

04:55.520 --> 04:59.560
This was not because I'm the world's biggest Cats stan or because I'm just that important,

04:59.560 --> 05:03.040
it was because I cajoled my friend who got invited to a critic screening to let me be

05:03.040 --> 05:04.880
her plus one.

05:04.880 --> 05:10.800
See, after weeks of reveling in the pure unintentional Salvadorian madness that was the trailer,

05:10.800 --> 05:15.240
I was keen to be one of the first. I got my complimentary cat ears, they gave us Cats

05:15.240 --> 05:20.560
temporary tattoos and Cats champagne, presumably to help black out what we were about to see,

05:20.600 --> 05:22.880
and we settled in for the ride of a lifetime.

05:22.880 --> 05:26.720
There were two types of people at this screening, people who were familiar with Andrew Lloyd

05:26.720 --> 05:30.640
Webber's Cats, and people who until now had lived in blissful ignorance.

05:34.640 --> 05:39.760
I was, in fact, sandwiched right between two of these people, to my left sat Angie Hahn,

05:39.760 --> 05:44.560
critic for Mashable.com and who knew f*** all about Cats, and to my right, Emily Vanderwerf,

05:44.560 --> 05:49.040
critic at large for Vox.com and the person I cajoled into taking me, and who, like me,

05:49.040 --> 05:50.560
was familiar with Cats.

05:50.560 --> 05:54.400
Emily spent more or less the whole film making this face, and Andrew spent the whole film

05:54.400 --> 05:58.360
making this face. Both of them deeply enjoyed the experience, for the record. Maybe not

05:58.360 --> 06:03.320
the film itself, but definitely the experience.

06:03.320 --> 06:06.720
For people who hadn't seen Cats before, the questions seemed to be,

06:06.720 --> 06:13.000
I'm saying a cat is not a dog.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.200
Is this it? Is this what Cats is? Is this what Cats has been the whole time?

06:18.360 --> 06:23.800
And on that day, I was like, I mean, yeah, that's pretty much Cats. What did you expect?

06:23.800 --> 06:31.320
And say a cat is not a dog.

06:31.320 --> 06:35.320
And if you follow me on Twitter, you know I spent most of my December and January obsessed

06:35.320 --> 06:41.720
with the Cats movie, which was every bit as much of a trainwreck as I had hoped. And why?

06:41.720 --> 06:45.160
Even now, I honestly could not tell you.

06:45.160 --> 06:50.040
But the more time I spent on Cats and thinking about this movie, the more I had to actually

06:50.040 --> 06:55.360
confront these questions. Not just the question of why am I so fixated on this unquestionable

06:55.360 --> 07:00.360
disaster, but why is Cats? How did this become a thing?

07:00.360 --> 07:04.440
Because that the movie and the stage musical exist at all, let alone that the musical was

07:04.440 --> 07:07.440
as popular as it was, is somewhat baffling.

07:07.440 --> 07:11.400
I got so fixated on this that I started a podcast about it, where I explain musicals

07:11.400 --> 07:14.820
to my friend who hates musicals. Information in the description.

07:14.820 --> 07:19.380
And of course, our pilot episode was about Cats. But even there, where I attempt to explain

07:19.380 --> 07:25.380
that which is Cats, I kind of fail because that question of why came up a few times.

07:25.380 --> 07:32.260
So it still leads to the real question, which is, who likes Cats? I would argue it's kids.

07:32.260 --> 07:36.580
I say I don't know. Like, I don't, I don't know who Cats is for because I don't know

07:36.580 --> 07:39.260
anyone who's write or die for Cats.

07:39.260 --> 07:41.980
I'm literally looking at a person who's write or die for Cats.

07:41.980 --> 07:42.980
No, I'm not.

07:42.980 --> 07:43.980
You can deny it all you want.

07:43.980 --> 07:48.380
But I don't think that in that episode, I answered that why question satisfactorily.

07:48.380 --> 07:52.780
And part of that is, I think, the mistake of conflating the why for the stage musical,

07:52.780 --> 07:56.740
which is almost 40 years old, kind of like me, and the why for the movie.

07:56.740 --> 08:00.460
I realize now that those two why-god-whys have very different answers.

08:00.460 --> 08:05.280
The first time I saw the film, I was like, well, what did you expect? This is Cats.

08:05.280 --> 08:07.740
But I'm going to have to walk back this assessment.

08:07.740 --> 08:17.980
If we are asking why this happened, and wholly conflating this

08:17.980 --> 08:23.780
with this,

08:23.780 --> 08:27.780
then, my Jellicle friends, we are asking the wrong questions.

08:38.740 --> 08:44.620
Cats the Musical is based on a collection of poems entitled Old Possum's Book of Practical

08:44.620 --> 08:48.320
Cats, written by T.S. Eliot and published in 1939.

08:48.320 --> 08:52.500
As the poems were originally written for Eliot's young godchildren, the nature of them skews

08:52.500 --> 08:55.940
light and comedic, short and whimsical.

08:55.940 --> 09:01.580
Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber not only grew up with this book of poetry, he also just loves cats.

09:01.580 --> 09:02.580
How?

09:02.580 --> 09:04.780
It's about cats.

09:04.780 --> 09:07.120
Just big fan of cats.

09:07.160 --> 09:10.880
Nothing deep, nothing weird, man just likes him a cat.

09:10.880 --> 09:14.360
But Lloyd Webber didn't come to the idea of turning practical cats into a show until

09:14.360 --> 09:15.360
the late 1970s.

09:15.360 --> 09:19.820
A friend had asked him if he'd be interested in composing music set to poetry.

09:19.820 --> 09:23.200
And one day, while Evita was in rehearsals, he thought of that book that his mother had

09:23.200 --> 09:24.780
read to him as a child.

09:24.780 --> 09:31.100
My mother used to read them to me, and I always loved them, and I had them myself, and I kept

09:31.100 --> 09:32.880
them for years.

09:32.880 --> 09:38.160
And I always thought that there was something about them that was very musical, I guess.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.480
But it wasn't until he had a long, liquid lunch with producer Cameron Mackintosh in

09:41.480 --> 09:45.680
1980, however, that Cats the Stage Musical became its own moving engine.

09:45.680 --> 09:49.560
But a large, dance-centric show was a daring move for musical theatre at the time.

09:49.560 --> 09:53.280
Cameron was already friends with acclaimed choreographer Gillian Lynn, who would ultimately

09:53.280 --> 09:54.280
choreograph the show.

09:54.280 --> 09:58.240
The man was wonderful when he made love to me, but I hated him.

09:58.240 --> 10:02.640
But getting the rights from T.S. Eliot's widow, or finding a director, even?

10:02.680 --> 10:06.040
Everybody thought we were mad to do a show about cats.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.040
Everybody.

10:07.040 --> 10:11.040
But it turned out that T.S. Eliot's widow was not as hard a sell as they feared.

10:11.040 --> 10:14.680
After years of dodging requests to make Old Possum's book into an animated film from

10:14.680 --> 10:18.120
companies like Disney, she was afraid that Old Possum would turn out like Winnie the

10:18.120 --> 10:23.040
Pooh or something, Sir Horny Lloyd Webber came to her with a more novel, adult approach.

10:23.040 --> 10:28.880
So I plucked up my courage and I said to Valerie, I said, what would, if I say, if I wanted

10:28.880 --> 10:30.600
them to be a bit like hot gossip?

10:30.600 --> 10:32.920
She said, Tom would have liked that.

10:32.920 --> 10:36.440
If you're not familiar with hot gossip, here was their big hit at the time.

10:36.440 --> 10:40.160
I lost my heart to a Starship Trooper.

10:40.160 --> 10:43.880
I lost my heart, I lost my heart.

10:43.880 --> 10:46.480
Hal Prince was not available to direct this show, however.

10:46.480 --> 10:49.120
Hal, it's about cats.

10:49.120 --> 10:53.600
And after being passed over by multiple stage directors, Lloyd Webber and McIntosh settled

10:53.600 --> 10:56.840
on Royal Shakespeare Company director Trevor Nunn.

10:56.880 --> 11:01.400
But right off the bat, Lloyd Webber kept running into problems of people not getting it.

11:01.400 --> 11:03.520
All cats are jellicles, you see.

11:03.520 --> 11:05.560
This is made clear in one of the unpublished poems.

11:05.560 --> 11:07.920
Yes, but all the other cats are jellicles as well.

11:07.920 --> 11:09.720
All cats are jellicle cats, fundamentally.

11:09.720 --> 11:14.160
You see, dogs are polycle dogs, and cats are jellicle cats.

11:14.160 --> 11:18.240
Cats is more like a review than a traditional plot-driven musical in its format, which isn't

11:18.240 --> 11:22.220
a surprise given that it's based on a collection of poems without much connective tissue except

11:22.220 --> 11:23.560
for the whole cat thing.

11:23.560 --> 11:27.240
But it was director Trevor Nunn who suggested giving an emotional throughline to the show

11:27.240 --> 11:29.360
that would give it some semblance of a story.

11:29.360 --> 11:34.680
The plot, well, if it can be said to have one, is similar to Broadway's previous longest-running

11:34.680 --> 11:39.520
show, 1975's A Chorus Line, as characters take turns singing to win a contest.

11:39.520 --> 11:43.280
And the sympathy vote goes to the one busted old lady, long in the tooth and yearning for

11:43.280 --> 11:44.500
another chance.

11:44.500 --> 11:48.800
In Cats, she's Grizabella, the Glamour Cat, a stinky Sally Bowles with whiskers.

11:48.800 --> 11:53.160
Along with her are a bunch of other feline hopefuls sporting names like MonkaStrep, the

11:53.160 --> 11:58.240
Rum Tum Tugger, Skimbleshanks, the Railway Cat, Ginny Annie Dots, the Gumby Cat, Asparagus,

11:58.240 --> 12:03.080
the Theatre Cat, Ain't It Chief, the Cancelled Cat, Nala, the Girlboss Cat, Fieri, the Flavortown

12:03.080 --> 12:04.840
Cat, and so on.

12:04.840 --> 12:07.400
And the success of Cats was by no means a given.

12:07.400 --> 12:11.200
The ambitious nature of the musical meant that few theatres were willing to risk hosting

12:11.200 --> 12:15.400
it, and the one they eventually did secure, the New London Theatre, saw a massive overhaul

12:15.400 --> 12:18.200
of the theatre itself just for this production.

12:18.200 --> 12:21.560
Funding was also coming up short, and Lloyd Webber had to take out a second mortgage on

12:21.560 --> 12:23.480
his home just to complete it.

12:23.480 --> 12:28.960
So Cats was, weirdly enough, an underdog passion project that Lloyd Webber risked everything

12:28.960 --> 12:34.960
for.

12:34.960 --> 12:39.440
And all of this was before the show could be considered anything remotely close to done.

12:39.440 --> 12:43.440
The writing process was a work in progress throughout previews right until opening, in

12:43.440 --> 12:47.360
no small part because figuring out the connective tissue between a bunch of poems wasn't exactly

12:47.360 --> 12:51.000
a priority for Lloyd Webber, who just wanted a bunch of people in Lycra to sing about being

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
cats.

12:52.000 --> 13:04.400
But a major issue was the lack of an emotional lynchpin, the showstopper, that emotional

13:04.400 --> 13:07.520
ballad that is the keystone of every musical.

13:07.520 --> 13:11.920
Cats didn't really have one, nor did it have a character to sing it, and none of Eliot's

13:11.920 --> 13:14.880
whimsical poems really lent themselves to that sort of ballad.

13:14.880 --> 13:18.680
Said character came in the form of one of Eliot's unpublished poems, Grizabella the

13:18.680 --> 13:24.160
Glamour Cat, a poem about a sad has-been cat that Eliot cut from his collection because,

13:24.160 --> 13:35.600
given that the collection was for children, he considered it too sad.

13:35.600 --> 13:46.440
So Grizabella the Glamour Cat became the song that served as the character's entrance.

13:46.440 --> 13:47.980
But what would she sing?

13:47.980 --> 13:51.820
As a composer, Lloyd Webber would sometimes write a song, but not really have a home for

13:51.820 --> 14:04.280
it in whatever show he was working on.

14:04.280 --> 14:08.300
The song that would become Memory, the melody for it at least, he had written several years

14:08.300 --> 14:11.860
earlier, and was basically saving it for just such an occasion.

14:11.860 --> 14:15.620
So there was the melody, but there weren't really any cat poems that fit it.

14:15.620 --> 14:20.420
So the lyrics are inspired by, rather than directly lifted from, an Eliot poem that

14:20.420 --> 14:23.620
was not part of Old Possum, Rhapsody on a Windy Night.

14:23.620 --> 14:27.720
I say inspired by because the lyrics went through a lot of versions, one of which from

14:27.720 --> 14:31.780
Lloyd Webber's former lyricist and writing partner, Tim Rice, who had co-written with

14:31.780 --> 14:36.940
him Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Jesus Christ Superstar, and Evita.

14:36.940 --> 14:41.300
Now by this point, Lloyd Webber and Rice had well and truly fallen out, even though neither

14:41.300 --> 14:45.820
of them have ever really publicly explained why, but Lloyd Webber asked him to do a pass

14:45.820 --> 14:46.820
on it.

14:46.820 --> 14:49.660
Rice was like, fine, he did, and then he was like, actually don't use my lyrics, but then

14:49.660 --> 14:53.660
they used his lyrics during previews, and he got really mad, and he threatened to sue,

14:53.660 --> 14:54.660
it was a whole thing.

14:54.660 --> 14:57.500
I did write a lyric for Memory, and it went into the show for a couple of nights in previews,

14:57.500 --> 15:06.020
and then it was taken out and given to a lyricist chosen by the director.

15:06.020 --> 15:07.020
The director.

15:07.020 --> 15:10.860
Eventually, it was none who found the most agreeable interpretation of the poem, and

15:10.860 --> 15:24.020
lo, Cats has its signature song, completed sometime during previews.

15:24.020 --> 15:28.780
And despite all of those low expectations, despite the no plot, despite the weirdness,

15:28.780 --> 15:34.380
despite the lycra, despite the hair, despite everything, by 1981, Cats had opened in London,

15:34.380 --> 15:39.020
and soon swept the Olivier Awards, coming to Broadway some 18 months later, and there

15:39.020 --> 15:47.660
swept the Tonys, including Best Musical.

15:47.660 --> 15:52.700
But despite the show's success, critics were not super enamored with Cats, ripping

15:52.700 --> 15:57.380
apart the gossamer-thin plot, the weird mood, the focus on dance, which according to theatre

15:57.380 --> 16:03.140
professor Alison McLemore, musical theatre scholars tend to be biased against.

16:03.140 --> 16:21.100
Broadway legend Elaine Stritch just walked out, said Stritch later.

16:21.100 --> 16:25.840
But in spite of all of its strange, gaudy, borderline showtime-after-midnight drapings

16:25.840 --> 16:31.260
and utterly befuddling story, Cats managed to amass its own army of stay-at-home moms,

16:31.340 --> 16:34.780
lonely 12-year-olds, and perverts that critics could never hope to dissuade.

16:34.780 --> 16:39.740
It's for everybody, it's for kids, it's for adults, I've seen it about 9 times now,

16:39.740 --> 16:41.660
and every time it's better than last year.

16:41.660 --> 16:45.180
I enjoyed it more tonight than I did 18 years ago when it first came out.

16:45.180 --> 16:51.260
It's very exciting, you know, all different things are happening, like, you know, it's

16:51.260 --> 16:52.260
very emotional.

16:52.260 --> 16:54.700
To quote a Guardian article from last winter,

17:01.260 --> 17:06.300
Cats is the best show I ever saw.

17:06.300 --> 17:08.460
Gorgeous, simply gorgeous.

17:08.460 --> 17:11.620
Cats was also the original blockbuster megamusical.

17:11.620 --> 17:16.000
On the business side, everything that was wrong with Cats worked to its benefit.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.300
No stars meant cast changes were not a problem.

17:19.300 --> 17:22.740
Thin story meant those lucrative foreign tourists don't miss anything.

17:22.740 --> 17:24.460
No money quote from the Times Review?

17:24.460 --> 17:28.500
Well, we don't need it, we've got this amazing poster that would only be harmed by

17:28.500 --> 17:29.940
critic quotes.

17:29.940 --> 17:31.420
Minimalism, baby.

17:31.420 --> 17:35.580
The actors also traditionally interact with the audience, which, while not much fun for

17:35.580 --> 17:40.540
Elaine Stritch, helps most theatergoers lose themselves in the shamelessness of it all.

17:40.540 --> 17:47.100
Jellicles come to the Jellicle Bowl.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.940
Nostalgia is also a factor.

17:48.940 --> 17:54.580
While Cats fans do come in all ages, the superfans tend to be age 40 plus and remember the original

17:54.580 --> 17:56.540
West End and Broadway versions.

17:56.540 --> 17:59.060
Another part of the show's appeal is that there are so many characters for audiences

17:59.060 --> 18:00.180
to relate to.

18:00.180 --> 18:04.620
And for most fans of the show, the fact that it is so weird, so removed from reality is

18:04.620 --> 18:12.980
not a bug, but a feature.

18:12.980 --> 18:17.640
In his New York Times review of Cats, Frank Rich wrote that despite its flaws, the reason

18:17.640 --> 18:22.060
people will hunger to see Cats is that it's a musical that transports the audience into

18:22.060 --> 18:30.180
a complete fantasy world that could only exist in theater.

18:30.180 --> 18:32.100
Rich added some 40 years later,

18:32.100 --> 18:49.100
And once again, we circle back to that question of, but why, though?

18:50.100 --> 18:54.100
What's a Jellicle Cat?

18:54.100 --> 18:57.100
What's a Jellicle Cat?

19:07.100 --> 19:10.100
Steven Spielberg and Amblin Entertainment reached out to work with Andrew Lloyd Webber

19:10.100 --> 19:12.100
on an animated version in 1989.

19:12.100 --> 19:16.620
Spielberg's vision was to be set in a dark, World War II era London, and to be somewhat

19:16.620 --> 19:20.100
Brechtian in tone, which, okay.

19:20.100 --> 19:24.100
The concept art that has been released is actually pretty cool, and as is the case with

19:24.100 --> 19:28.260
most musicals, an animated adaptation makes way more sense than the Nietzschean horror

19:28.260 --> 19:32.940
that we eventually got.

19:32.940 --> 19:36.260
But ultimately, between production delays, squabbles about the screenplay, and how to

19:36.260 --> 19:40.260
create an actual plot, and the failure of Amblin's other animated films like An American

19:40.260 --> 19:45.300
Tale, Fievel Goes West, We're Back, A Dinosaur Story, and Balto, the studio shut down in

19:45.300 --> 19:49.220
1997 and ended any hope of the animated film coming to fruition.

19:49.220 --> 19:53.500
A multi-camera version of the stage show was filmed and released in 1998, shortening the

19:53.500 --> 19:58.660
musical and adding new elements, like force lightning.

19:58.660 --> 19:59.980
So this should be good enough.

19:59.980 --> 20:00.980
We have this.

20:00.980 --> 20:02.980
We don't need a live-action movie.

20:02.980 --> 20:06.820
And of all of the musicals to adapt, it makes the most sense that Cats had evaded adaptation

20:06.820 --> 20:13.020
for so long, despite its popularity.

20:13.340 --> 20:17.220
Universal bought the film rights to Cats sometime after the Amblin production folded, and it

20:17.220 --> 20:20.700
kind of existed in that development hell limbo ever since.

20:20.700 --> 20:25.260
Lloyd Webber kind of hinted at something being in the works as early as 2013, but we didn't

20:25.260 --> 20:27.460
see movement until about three years later.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.740
So what happened in that time?

20:29.740 --> 20:36.620
Well, Greatest Showman came along and made half a billion dollars worldwide.

20:36.620 --> 20:41.660
Obviously, I'm not Mr. Universal, but we can surmise that Mr. Universal saw the long-in-development

20:41.660 --> 20:45.540
Cats project and thought, hey, let's give that the go-ahead and then we too can make

20:45.540 --> 20:47.020
half a billion dollars.

20:47.020 --> 20:49.620
And while we're there, let's attach to it the last guy who won a bunch of Oscars

20:49.620 --> 20:50.620
for a musical.

20:50.620 --> 20:51.620
That's the ticket.

20:51.620 --> 20:54.180
Half a billion dollars and Oscars.

20:54.180 --> 20:55.500
Everybody wins.

20:55.500 --> 21:00.100
So it does kind of feel like we're missing a step here, that a prestige musical adaptation

21:00.100 --> 21:02.420
equals Oscar bait de facto.

21:02.420 --> 21:06.180
For most of the early history of the Academy Awards, musicals were a major presence if

21:06.180 --> 21:10.620
for no other reason than in the early days of talkies, musicals just made up a much larger

21:10.620 --> 21:12.540
proportion of films that got made.

21:12.540 --> 21:16.400
But as we covered in the episode about roadshows, the big studio musical was kind of on its

21:16.400 --> 21:20.200
way out in the 1960s in favor of more heady experimental cinema.

21:20.200 --> 21:23.760
But then we had a couple of big hits and more importantly, big Oscar winners in the form

21:23.760 --> 21:25.960
of Mary Poppins and The Sound of Music.

21:25.960 --> 21:30.460
So that created a sort of boom and bust for the musical as an awards darling, but also

21:30.460 --> 21:32.220
for the movie musical in general.

21:32.220 --> 21:36.460
After Hello Dolly was a critical and commercial failure, the Hollywood musical was kind of

21:36.460 --> 21:38.320
dead for a while.

21:38.320 --> 21:42.120
So after that you had movies like Cabaret, which while unlike big studio musicals in

21:42.120 --> 21:44.640
most regard, did win a bunch of Oscars.

21:44.640 --> 21:49.120
But that was kind of the end of the era of musicals as Oscar darlings.

21:49.120 --> 21:53.520
You'd have your greases, your little shops, but they were more like popcorn movies.

21:53.520 --> 21:54.600
They weren't awards bait.

21:54.600 --> 21:56.600
And musicals mostly moved into animation.

21:56.600 --> 22:01.720
Hell, the next musical after Cabaret and All That Jazz in the 70s, both directed by Bob

22:01.720 --> 22:05.920
Fosse, to get nominated for Best Picture was Disney's Beauty and the Beast.

22:09.320 --> 22:14.080
So fast forward to 2001, where we are still firmly in the musicals equals popcorn movies

22:14.080 --> 22:15.080
mindset.

22:15.080 --> 22:17.840
Diamonds are a girl's best friend.

22:17.840 --> 22:21.040
Moulin Rouge was not designed to be an Oscar movie.

22:21.040 --> 22:25.280
It was designed for Baz Luhrmann's Romeo plus Juliet, made a bunch of money, and he

22:25.280 --> 22:28.120
has a budget now so let's just let him do whatever he wants.

22:28.120 --> 22:31.000
And Moulin Rouge is an even bigger hit than Romeo plus Juliet.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.280
Outside it may be raining, but in here it's entertaining.

22:35.320 --> 22:39.320
Now Moulin Rouge came out around the end of May, but like Greatest Showman, it had really

22:39.320 --> 22:40.320
good legs.

22:40.320 --> 22:41.320
Heh.

22:41.320 --> 22:44.680
And by the time awards season comes around, it's still in theaters, so Fox was like,

22:44.680 --> 22:49.120
hey, let's just go ahead and do a four year consideration campaign, and boom, Best Picture

22:49.120 --> 22:50.120
nominee.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.440
Who would have ever thought?

22:51.440 --> 22:55.080
Everything's going so well!

22:55.080 --> 23:00.040
This sets the stage for the already in development Chicago, itself fueled by Harvey Weinstein's

23:00.040 --> 23:04.240
four year consideration campaigns of attrition, and not only does Chicago win Best Picture,

23:04.240 --> 23:09.320
but five other awards in 2003, the first musical to win Best Picture since Oliver in

23:09.320 --> 23:10.320
1968.

23:10.320 --> 23:12.600
Now, two things here.

23:12.600 --> 23:16.760
One is that adaptations of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals have historically not yielded very

23:16.760 --> 23:22.040
good results, either commercially or with regard to awards.

23:22.040 --> 23:28.040
I mean, don't get me wrong, they try.

23:28.040 --> 23:32.560
The most successful to date is the 1996 film adaptation of Evita, starring Madonna and

23:32.560 --> 23:37.440
Antonio Banderas, which while not an Oscar darling, despite winning Best Original Song,

23:37.440 --> 23:41.960
it did win a bunch of Golden Globes, including Actress for Madonna and Best Motion Picture,

23:41.960 --> 23:42.960
Musical or Comedy.

23:42.960 --> 23:52.560
Then, of course, there's Phantom of the Opera, which was also released in the thick of awards

23:52.560 --> 23:54.160
season with high hopes.

23:54.160 --> 23:57.360
It did have a pretty aggressive four year consideration campaign, and it did yield a

23:57.360 --> 24:02.800
couple of Oscar nominations, including, bewilderingly, Cinematography.

24:02.800 --> 24:12.480
For more on why that is terrible, watch the video I made on why it is terrible.

24:12.480 --> 24:17.000
Second is that Cats is not structured like a Hollywood screenplay, even in relation to

24:17.000 --> 24:20.840
other Andrew Lloyd Webber shows, which do tend to have, you know, like a plot.

24:20.840 --> 24:24.880
So right off the bat, even in comparison to projects like Phantom of the Opera or Evita,

24:24.880 --> 24:29.960
With Cats, they are starting at a huge disadvantage, which I suspect Mr. Universal knew for a long

24:29.960 --> 24:33.960
time considering how long it took them to get Cats out of development hell.

24:33.960 --> 24:39.200
How do you give this thing the structure of a Hollywood movie, while also keeping it recognizably

24:39.200 --> 24:40.200
Cats?

24:40.200 --> 24:49.360
I can dance how he dances too, let me see, it's easy, well, apparently you don't.

24:49.360 --> 24:53.520
So it wasn't just the incredible, unexpected success of Greatest Showman, it was also who

24:53.520 --> 24:58.360
directed the film, and I am absolutely 100% positive that Tom Hooper would never have

24:58.360 --> 25:11.640
been attached to Cats if the song Memory was not Cats' biggest staple.

25:11.640 --> 25:15.640
Ignoring Universal's aggressive For Your Consideration campaign for Les Miserables,

25:15.640 --> 25:20.720
a movie which proved that musicals can still be Oscar darlings even into the 2010s, most

25:20.720 --> 25:24.600
point to Anne Hathaway's rendition of I Dreamed a Dream as the thing that clinched

25:24.600 --> 25:27.200
her an Oscar win.

25:27.200 --> 25:30.400
So attaching Hooper to Cats was a no-brainer.

25:30.400 --> 25:35.360
Cats has the big Oscar-winning ballad, Les Mis has the big Oscar-winning ballad, it's

25:35.360 --> 25:43.280
just, it's some synergy.

25:43.280 --> 25:47.680
But Les Miserables was a harbinger of things to come, and for every truly bewildering decision

25:47.680 --> 26:04.760
that Hooper made in Cats, the warning signs were always there.

26:04.760 --> 26:10.080
When philosopher and media theorist Marshall McLuhan famously said, the medium is the message,

26:10.080 --> 26:11.880
what did he mean by that?

26:11.880 --> 26:16.760
Simplistically, it's the idea that you can only receive an idea or a story through a

26:17.240 --> 26:25.600
Be that medium a poem, a novel, a film, a stage show, or even just the act of talking.

26:25.600 --> 26:30.520
It is not the idea or story itself that is being expressed, but a medium that is expressing

26:30.520 --> 26:31.520
it.

26:31.520 --> 26:33.320
Therefore, the medium should be the focus of study.

26:33.320 --> 26:37.120
According to theater scholar Linda Hutchin, while no medium is inherently good at doing

26:37.120 --> 26:41.860
one thing and not another, each medium, like each genre, has different means of expression

26:41.860 --> 26:44.800
and so can aim at certain things better than others.

26:44.840 --> 26:47.120
So let's look at Les Miserables as a case study.

26:47.120 --> 26:52.200
You have Victor Hugo's novel Les Miserables, you have the PBS Masterpiece miniseries starring

26:52.200 --> 27:02.600
Dominic West and David Oyelowo, and you have the Bublil and Schoenberg stage musicals.

27:02.600 --> 27:06.920
Three different mediums telling the same story, but owing to difference in medium, they tell

27:06.920 --> 27:10.960
them in very different ways that are designed, first and foremost, to fit their respective

27:10.960 --> 27:11.960
medium.

27:11.960 --> 27:16.400
So what can often happen when you have someone schooled in one medium who is suddenly having

27:16.400 --> 27:20.440
to figure out how to most effectively do another, that can lead to some dissonance.

27:20.440 --> 27:25.800
I think what I was trying to achieve was a combination of extreme realism so that the

27:25.800 --> 27:32.200
film would feel rooted in a visceral reality, but also allowing a certain heightening of

27:32.200 --> 27:33.200
reality.

27:33.200 --> 27:36.560
We saw this in Phantom of the Opera, directed by Joel Schumacher, where there's a lot

27:36.560 --> 27:40.760
of little things that just show him trying to make it less of a musical.

27:40.760 --> 27:49.760
Like having them speak singing lines that don't make sense to speak sing, and then

27:49.760 --> 27:58.200
having Butler scream half his lines instead of singing them.

27:58.200 --> 28:03.080
And this, of course, works both ways.

28:03.080 --> 28:07.840
The Producers, the 2005 film, was directed by Susan Stroman, who also directed the Broadway

28:07.840 --> 28:08.840
stage show.

28:08.920 --> 28:12.120
The Producer shows us what it's like when a stage director is uncomfortable working

28:12.120 --> 28:13.720
in the format of film.

28:13.720 --> 28:17.200
People who've never seen this show but did see the movie, an adaptation which is faithful

28:17.200 --> 28:21.760
to a fault because it's basically just the stage show, are like, that's it?

28:21.760 --> 28:28.920
That's the winningest, toniest show ever?

28:28.920 --> 28:32.360
But this film version is emblematic of how medium matters.

28:32.360 --> 28:36.040
So much that worked on the stage and led the producers to win the most tonies of any musical

28:36.040 --> 28:49.360
by a single production in history, just didn't translate to film.

28:49.360 --> 28:51.400
Quoting film scholar Robert Stamm,

28:51.400 --> 28:53.960
Film clearly has resources that the stage can never have.

28:53.960 --> 28:57.360
The power of the close-up that gives the micro-drama of the human countenance and the separate

28:57.360 --> 29:01.440
soundtracks of film that permit voice-overs, music, and the non-vocal to intermingle.

29:01.440 --> 29:02.440
Linda Hutcheon adds,

29:02.440 --> 29:06.800
And, when we sit quiet and still, in the dark watching real live bodies on the stage, our

29:06.800 --> 29:10.760
kind of identification is different from when we sit in front of a screen and have the reality

29:10.760 --> 29:13.160
mediated for us by technology.

29:13.160 --> 29:17.760
So live theater naturally requires way more suspension of disbelief than film does.

29:17.760 --> 29:22.840
You are in the same room with these people, you have to applaud after every musical number,

29:22.840 --> 29:26.800
you can see the sets, you can see that the snow isn't real.

29:26.800 --> 29:30.680
The actors are probably pantomiming like half of a set that isn't there.

29:30.720 --> 29:34.200
But the medium of film works against that necessary suspension of disbelief.

29:34.200 --> 29:38.200
I'd rather just sing.

29:38.200 --> 29:40.200
Stop that, stop that.

29:40.200 --> 29:42.360
You're not going into a song while I'm here.

29:42.360 --> 29:44.800
And must be adjusted for with stylism.

29:44.800 --> 29:48.600
That's why musicals tend to work better as animated movies than live action movies.

29:48.600 --> 29:54.800
An animated movie requires more suspension of disbelief because this isn't real, it's a drawing.

29:54.800 --> 29:56.600
Why was everyone singing?

29:56.600 --> 29:58.520
We've just got a song in our hearts.

29:58.520 --> 30:02.360
And therefore it fits more easily with the requirements of believing that these characters

30:02.360 --> 30:04.120
might suddenly just burst into song.

30:04.120 --> 30:06.120
How is it you all know the words?

30:06.120 --> 30:07.120
Did you rehearse?

30:07.120 --> 30:08.120
Yeah, every Thursday.

30:08.120 --> 30:11.040
Didn't you see the flyers?

30:11.040 --> 30:15.680
Of course, film directors do sometimes figure out ways to bridge this gap gracefully.

30:15.680 --> 30:17.240
Chicago springs to mind.

30:17.240 --> 30:21.000
It manages to work with the realism of the tone while incorporating the more theatrical

30:21.000 --> 30:24.600
framing, all while making it work within its own internal logic.

30:24.600 --> 30:29.880
And sometimes other movie musicals just don't care about how realistic or not the framing

30:29.880 --> 30:34.360
is, and they just don't bother caring about that.

30:34.360 --> 30:36.360
The Mamma Mia's are a good example.

30:36.360 --> 30:39.480
They are not going for high art, and that's fine.

30:39.480 --> 30:44.040
But part of the tilt toward realism in film is because the Academy tends to reward a more

30:44.040 --> 30:45.680
realistic style.

30:45.680 --> 30:48.280
Not always, but overall.

30:48.280 --> 30:52.960
And for those of you out there who argue that Tom Hooper's style is actually kind of weird,

30:52.960 --> 30:57.600
strange angles and lots of dead space of exposed brick and wallpaper does not an unrealistically

30:57.600 --> 30:59.000
styled film make.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.800
Yes, Hooper does use a lot of unsettling visual language, and I'll get to that in a minute,

31:02.800 --> 31:07.320
but that doesn't mean that groundedness in realism isn't ultimately what he's going for.

31:07.320 --> 31:11.800
So in addition to a sort of stylistic discomfort with musicals in general, there's also incentive

31:11.800 --> 31:15.560
to make the visual style of the film more realistic.

31:15.560 --> 31:18.800
So his proclivity for dragging the medium of the musical kicking and screaming into

31:18.800 --> 31:23.360
the style of realism preferred by the Oscars, it was only a matter of time before he slipped

31:23.360 --> 31:26.360
into the Uncanny Valley.

31:26.360 --> 31:31.280
So the tactic with Les Mis' visual language was, in part, visual realism.

31:31.280 --> 31:35.560
But in addition to that, in order to make it feel more immediate and more realistic,

31:35.560 --> 31:46.280
Hooper also elected to use set sound, recording the actors as they sang.

31:46.280 --> 31:50.520
Other than the more traditional way of doing it, by having the actors sing along to playback.

31:50.520 --> 31:54.760
Hooper went to very great lengths to make the performance feel more authentic.

31:54.760 --> 31:59.960
By recording it live, Tom is allowing us the spontaneity of normal film acting.

31:59.960 --> 32:02.360
And it was a great gimmick to sell to Academy voters.

32:02.360 --> 32:05.880
So the medium of musical theater, which in the case of Les Mis and Cats requires the

32:05.880 --> 32:10.440
cast to be singing the whole time, already requires a much higher degree of suspension

32:10.440 --> 32:12.160
of disbelief than film does.

32:12.160 --> 32:16.680
And not just realistic, actively at war with the big emotions of the music.

32:16.680 --> 32:21.840
You have extreme close-ups, constantly, for three hours, on actors who are singing songs

32:21.840 --> 32:23.640
designed to play to cheap seats.

32:23.640 --> 32:30.060
Well, he did, Les Mis is bad, but it won some awards.

32:30.060 --> 32:38.760
So even though the main impact of that movie is in Le Chauvet memes.

32:38.760 --> 32:42.920
The formula, according to Universal, appears to be Tom Hooper plus Beloved Classic Musical

32:42.920 --> 32:44.480
equals profit.

32:44.480 --> 32:47.720
So that's how we got here.

32:47.720 --> 32:49.640
Let's see what we got.

32:49.640 --> 33:01.800
I don't know what I expected.

33:01.800 --> 33:06.100
Although I will attempt to find rationale, if not reason, in the film version of Cats,

33:06.100 --> 33:12.740
there are many bewildering choices that I can only attribute to Hooperian whimsy.

33:12.740 --> 33:17.300
From horny Judi Dench scissoring in delight after Gus the theater cat, to Jennifer Hudson

33:17.300 --> 33:21.740
spending most of her screen time in close-ups with her face covered in snot, to McCavity

33:21.740 --> 33:25.540
being played the way that he is.

33:25.540 --> 33:31.580
How do you manage to make Idris Elba unappealing?

33:31.580 --> 33:35.260
The aspect of the film that drew the most attention, positive and negative, after that

33:35.300 --> 33:39.300
first trailer was released was the uncanny valley-ness of it all, which all goes back

33:39.300 --> 33:43.780
to Hooper's attempts to draw this weird fantastical show back down to realism.

33:43.780 --> 33:45.420
Said Hooper in an interview for The Atlantic,

33:45.420 --> 33:48.540
I wanted to keep it very grounded in the present moment.

33:48.540 --> 33:52.420
The thing I'm most proud of is that you feel grounded watching it.

33:52.420 --> 33:54.860
It's not that fantastical.

33:54.860 --> 33:58.980
Which... it's Cats, dude.

33:58.980 --> 34:04.020
Blame has been laid upon the visual effects team, which...

34:04.020 --> 34:14.660
Nobody more than us understands the importance of good visual effects.

34:14.660 --> 34:16.580
Okay let's talk about that for a moment.

34:16.580 --> 34:21.260
We've used digital fur technology to create the most perfect covering of fur.

34:21.260 --> 34:26.180
So Hooper wanted the film to be grounded and not that fantastical, and part of that was

34:26.180 --> 34:31.700
wanting his actors to be X amount of unencumbered, and also to shoot on practical sets.

34:31.700 --> 34:33.500
A weird scale.

34:33.500 --> 34:36.620
So he elected that they should not use mocap suits.

34:36.620 --> 34:41.540
Despite the fact that the suits they did wear looked plenty ridiculous, allegedly, this

34:41.540 --> 34:45.380
is hearsay, no one has gone on the record to say this, Hooper didn't want his actors

34:45.380 --> 34:47.420
distracted or encumbered.

34:47.420 --> 34:49.300
So no mocap suits.

34:49.300 --> 34:53.740
So all of the digital fur technology had to be done manually, which not only ballooned

34:53.740 --> 34:58.420
the post-production budget, it massively increased the labor required to finish it.

34:58.420 --> 35:03.300
But after the trailer hit, allegedly, again this is through my grapevine, Mr. Universal

35:03.300 --> 35:07.060
kind of panicked and slashed the funding going to post-production.

35:07.060 --> 35:12.900
And that, in part, is why you get these shots that look, well, kind of bad.

35:12.900 --> 35:16.620
And why you've got like these floating faces, and why there are some shots that aren't

35:16.620 --> 35:17.620
even finished.

35:17.620 --> 35:22.180
So when you hear horror stories of the VFX team for Cats being underfunded and understaffed

35:22.180 --> 35:26.700
and overworked, allegedly, again no one has gone on the record to discuss this in any

35:26.700 --> 35:30.180
meaningful detail because they don't want to lose their jobs, so this is all hearsay,

35:30.180 --> 35:31.540
this is the result.

35:31.540 --> 35:36.020
So the manually rotoscoped digital fur technology, the slashed budget, and Hooper's bizarre

35:36.020 --> 35:41.300
insistence on making changes up to the 11th hour, in part, leads us here.

35:41.300 --> 35:46.460
But even if it had gotten the time and money it needed, could this have worked visually?

35:46.460 --> 35:49.460
Would this have worked for audiences?

35:49.460 --> 35:51.980
Probably not.

35:51.980 --> 35:56.380
Hooper's dedication to making the movie feel grounded backfired horribly, no matter

35:56.380 --> 35:58.500
how much time the VFX team had.

35:58.500 --> 36:02.020
These decisions were all rooted in trying to bridge that realism gap, so much so that

36:02.020 --> 36:06.740
certain elements are somehow both overthought and underthought at the same time.

36:06.740 --> 36:12.500
The film's approach to the titular animal is both way more literal and way more dense

36:12.500 --> 36:13.740
at the same time.

36:13.740 --> 36:17.940
One wonders if any of these people have ever even seen a cat.

36:17.940 --> 36:21.900
The film adds way more literal cat things that aren't even there in the show, like

36:21.900 --> 36:27.380
their ears move around, they crawl around on all fours and paw at each other, they lap

36:27.380 --> 36:32.940
at things, and go meow meow meow.

36:32.940 --> 36:37.500
Gillian Lynn's choreography in the show is designed to be, like, more evocative of

36:37.500 --> 36:41.940
the idea of a cat, not a literal imitation of a cat.

36:41.940 --> 36:45.460
But here we are, not ten minutes in, and we got a crotch-lickin' joke.

36:45.460 --> 36:46.460
I'm a kitty.

36:46.460 --> 36:47.460
Meow.

36:47.460 --> 36:48.460
Meow.

36:48.460 --> 36:51.620
And all of this adds up to create a suspension of disbelief problem that isn't there in

36:51.620 --> 36:52.620
the musical.

36:52.620 --> 36:56.100
There are not humans in the musical, for instance, but here they are at the beginning of the

36:56.100 --> 36:57.100
film.

36:57.100 --> 36:59.260
We see them before we see any cats.

36:59.260 --> 37:00.820
Humans with their human bodies.

37:00.820 --> 37:02.300
Throwing away a kitten in a bag.

37:02.300 --> 37:04.100
Who also has a human body?

37:04.100 --> 37:08.620
But as in Les Mis, Hooper just doesn't seem comfortable or particularly interested in

37:08.620 --> 37:10.380
the medium of the musical.

37:10.380 --> 37:12.380
The breaking of the fourth wall, for instance.

37:12.380 --> 37:13.380
Pretty common in musicals.

37:13.700 --> 37:16.700
Are you blind when you're born?

37:16.700 --> 37:20.700
We see this in Les Mis in a scene where, in the musical, Gavroche is addressing the audience.

37:20.700 --> 37:21.700
How do you do?

37:21.700 --> 37:22.700
My name's Gavroche.

37:22.700 --> 37:23.700
These are my people.

37:23.700 --> 37:24.700
Here's my patch.

37:24.700 --> 37:30.700
But we can't have that, so in the movie, he addresses some random rich dude.

37:30.700 --> 37:31.700
How do you do?

37:31.700 --> 37:32.700
My name's Gavroche.

37:32.700 --> 37:33.700
These are my people.

37:33.700 --> 37:34.700
Here's my patch.

37:34.700 --> 37:39.700
But then in the following line, he addresses the audience anyway, so...

37:39.700 --> 37:42.700
There was a time we killed the king.

37:43.020 --> 37:45.020
We tried to change the world too fast.

37:45.020 --> 37:48.740
Cats the Musical breaks the fourth wall a lot more than Les Mis.

37:48.740 --> 37:49.740
The cats address the audience.

37:49.740 --> 37:52.060
They explain things to the audience.

37:52.060 --> 37:54.700
They interact with the audience physically.

37:54.700 --> 37:58.340
But we can't have that, so the movie gets around this by making Victoria the fish out

37:58.340 --> 37:59.340
of water.

37:59.340 --> 38:02.860
They explain the jellicle thing to her instead of the audience.

38:02.860 --> 38:03.860
So cutting this...

38:03.860 --> 38:10.460
Do I actually see with my own very eyes?

38:10.460 --> 38:14.860
A man who's not heard of a jellicle cat.

38:14.860 --> 38:18.220
Sets up in the movie that fourth wall breaking is not a thing that is done here.

38:18.220 --> 38:19.940
Which, you know what, fine.

38:19.940 --> 38:21.860
It's a movie, not a stage show.

38:21.860 --> 38:26.460
So then they hold to this change for the whole movie until the end when they have Dench address

38:26.460 --> 38:29.460
the camera for like five minutes straight.

38:29.460 --> 38:37.300
You've heard of several kinds of cats should need no interpreter.

38:37.300 --> 38:43.100
To understand the cats are very much like you.

38:43.100 --> 38:49.500
You've seen us both, our habits and our habitat.

38:49.500 --> 39:04.340
But how would you know first your memory and say a cat is not a dog.

39:04.340 --> 39:09.380
With cats, some say one rule is true.

39:09.380 --> 39:17.540
A cat will condescend to treat you are spoken to myself.

39:17.540 --> 39:18.540
I do not.

39:18.540 --> 39:33.100
Oh, for a cat will condescend to treat you dish of cream or you might now and then.

39:33.100 --> 39:41.540
And so in time you reach your aim and call him by his name.

39:41.540 --> 39:46.380
Movie adaptations also often change the arrangements of songs, which again, fine.

39:46.380 --> 39:50.620
But in Cats, it just feels like Hooper did it because he was bored with them.

39:50.620 --> 39:53.780
The Rum Tum Tugger is one of the show's most high energy numbers.

39:53.780 --> 40:01.060
And Derulo is actually a pretty good Rum Tum Tugger, except for that accent.

40:01.060 --> 40:11.820
So why, God why, do we keep interrupting this number for Rebel Wilson's bad improv?

40:11.820 --> 40:17.540
In the very next scene, we interrupt Bustopher Jones for more Rebel Wilson shenanigans.

40:17.540 --> 40:22.740
Anyway, back to the song.

40:22.740 --> 40:27.540
Even during Skimbleshanks, the best number in the movie, a mouse yells CATS.

40:27.540 --> 40:30.800
Yep, that's what we're watching.

40:30.800 --> 40:34.120
These things wouldn't be bad in and of themselves except that they don't add anything.

40:34.120 --> 40:37.520
It's like he's breaking up the musical numbers because he feels like they're too

40:37.520 --> 40:47.520
boring to stand on their own without something to break them up.

40:47.520 --> 40:51.280
The filmmakers' discomfort slash disinterest with the material expands beyond just the

40:51.280 --> 40:54.040
medium of the musical and the show that they're adapting itself.

40:54.040 --> 40:58.600
There's a patent rejection of anything non-heteronormative that's pretty overt to anyone familiar with

40:58.600 --> 40:59.920
the stage musical.

41:00.040 --> 41:02.560
There is a lot of no-homo in this movie.

41:02.560 --> 41:04.120
Romantical cats.

41:04.120 --> 41:08.720
Yeah, God forbid that this guy be clocked as anything but the straightest manly man.

41:08.720 --> 41:12.840
It is often played in the musical that Mistoffelees and Rum Tum Tugger have like a little something

41:12.840 --> 41:13.840
going on.

41:13.840 --> 41:17.920
The Rum Tum Tugger is a terrible bore.

41:17.920 --> 41:18.920
And we can't have that.

41:18.920 --> 41:22.920
So both of them get their no-homo moments with Victoria.

41:22.920 --> 41:24.920
VICTORIA!

41:25.920 --> 41:31.920
And Mistoffelees gets it in the form of an all-out subplot.

41:31.920 --> 41:34.920
I'm coming, Victoria!

41:34.920 --> 41:38.520
For all the other terrible cat puns and figures of speech that they added in the movie, I'm

41:38.520 --> 41:41.920
surprised they didn't add something about how Rum Tum Tugger loves da pussy.

41:41.920 --> 41:43.920
Romantical cats.

41:43.920 --> 41:47.920
Heterosexual cats, heterosexual cats, heterosexual cats.

41:47.920 --> 41:52.920
But if there's one scene that was always doomed to failure, or wild success depending

41:52.920 --> 41:58.920
on how you look at it, in anything live-action or remotely realistic, it is the old Gumby

41:58.920 --> 41:59.920
Cat sequence.

41:59.920 --> 42:05.920
I have a Gumby Cat in mind.

42:05.920 --> 42:09.920
Her name is Jenny Any Dots.

42:09.920 --> 42:14.920
Wherein we hear about the titular Gumby Cat, who lays around all day but at night teaches

42:14.920 --> 42:18.920
mice and other vermin to like, you know, be upstanding members of society.

42:19.920 --> 42:24.920
The show accomplishes this with pantomime and props that are like, you know, garbage

42:24.920 --> 42:29.920
from the junkyard that the cats are hanging out in, made to look like, you know, mice.

42:29.920 --> 42:33.920
There are multiple times in the show where the cats pantomime other animals and objects,

42:33.920 --> 42:40.920
like mice and dogs and roaches and choo-choo trains, by appropriating trash and turning

42:40.920 --> 42:41.920
it into props and such.

42:41.920 --> 42:45.920
Now they could have done that, but realism.

42:45.920 --> 42:47.920
So instead we get this.

42:47.920 --> 42:57.920
And it just keeps escalating and getting more and more horrifying.

43:04.920 --> 43:07.920
I can't even make commentary on this so I'm not gonna.

43:07.920 --> 43:11.920
Except, why god why did they give the mice children's faces?

43:17.920 --> 43:18.920
End of show.

43:27.920 --> 43:31.920
From the moment the trailer came out, my biggest question was how would they try to give cats

43:31.920 --> 43:33.920
the shape of a Hollywood movie?

43:33.920 --> 43:37.920
I kind of deep down thought that they'd be smarter than that and just wouldn't bother.

43:37.920 --> 43:41.920
Like, they'd just let it keep its review-like qualities and have it be something kind of

43:41.920 --> 43:44.920
disjointed in the vein of Fantasia.

43:44.920 --> 43:47.920
But, wow, did they fly wildly in the other direction.

43:55.920 --> 43:59.920
Structuring the film with not one storyline from the musical on steroids, but two.

43:59.920 --> 44:04.920
The first is the enormously expanded part of Victoria, who's the protagonist now,

44:04.920 --> 44:07.920
and the emotional through-line of Grizabella.

44:07.920 --> 44:12.920
A kitten with one brief dance solo in the show and no songs, the film gives her a little

44:12.920 --> 44:16.920
orphan abandoned in the world of the Jellicle Cats narrative and takes this moment from

44:16.920 --> 44:20.920
the stage show and makes it the emotional through-line of the movie.

44:20.920 --> 44:26.920
And I'm not saying this is handled gracefully in the show, but the movie tries to bolster it

44:26.920 --> 44:29.920
and in doing so reveals the whole thing's weaknesses.

44:29.920 --> 44:34.920
It is distantly implied in the show, but stated outright in the movie.

44:34.920 --> 44:37.920
Why is Grizabella shunned by the other Jellicle Cats?

44:43.920 --> 44:45.920
Then she went with Macavity.

44:45.920 --> 44:46.920
Macavity?

44:46.920 --> 44:47.920
Macavity!

44:47.920 --> 44:52.920
Trying to add a little more logic to her story is not the most counterintuitive change in the world,

44:52.920 --> 44:55.920
but it does conflict with the other big change they made.

44:55.920 --> 44:56.920
Macavity.

44:56.920 --> 44:57.920
Meow!

44:57.920 --> 45:02.920
Macavity is like an obstacle that shows up towards the end of the show, like earlier

45:02.920 --> 45:07.920
some cats titter hearing about him and then later he shows up, he kidnaps old Deuteronomy,

45:07.920 --> 45:10.920
they immediately undo it and no one ever speaks of it again.

45:10.920 --> 45:12.920
And again, I'm not saying that this is good.

45:12.920 --> 45:19.920
It is charitably flimsy and Macavity is not really an antagonist, more of like a thing that happens.

45:19.920 --> 45:25.920
The tension of the story, if it can be said to have one, is just the question of who gets to die.

45:25.920 --> 45:26.920
Who gets to die the good death?

45:26.920 --> 45:31.920
Macavity in the show doesn't really care about this, but in the movie...

45:31.920 --> 45:35.920
I'm determined to win and I prefer my competition chained up.

45:35.920 --> 45:39.920
Wow, it's his life's goal, that heavy side layer.

45:39.920 --> 45:40.920
Why?

45:40.920 --> 45:41.920
Because.

45:41.920 --> 45:42.920
Meow!

45:42.920 --> 45:46.920
And then, as if all this doesn't make you want to crawl out of your skin enough...

45:46.920 --> 45:50.920
The Napoleon of Crime!

45:50.920 --> 45:52.920
Ha ha ha!

45:54.920 --> 45:56.920
Ah ha ha!

45:56.920 --> 45:59.920
Macavity! Macavity!

45:59.920 --> 46:02.920
Okay, so Macavity is the color of Idris Elba.

46:02.920 --> 46:07.920
Like, couldn't they just make him like a black cat or give him some stripes or something?

46:07.920 --> 46:09.920
I get that that could be problematic,

46:09.920 --> 46:13.920
but I don't think that the only alternative is to tumble head over ass into the uncanny valley

46:13.920 --> 46:16.920
by creating a cat that's just the color of human skin.

46:16.920 --> 46:18.920
Which is itself kind of revealing.

46:18.920 --> 46:20.920
Like, imagine if one of the white actors had the same treatment.

46:20.920 --> 46:23.920
Just a cat the color of human skin.

46:23.920 --> 46:27.920
Would they have not caught this for the uncanny valley yikes that it is?

46:27.920 --> 46:30.920
He's a fiend, he likes shit!

46:30.920 --> 46:34.920
So Macavity's function in the movie is to remove the other cats from the competition

46:34.920 --> 46:36.920
so he will be the jellicle choice.

46:36.920 --> 46:39.920
Despite the fact that he seems to be doing pretty well in this life,

46:39.920 --> 46:41.920
but whatever, he wants a new one.

46:41.920 --> 46:44.920
Macavity also serves the dual purpose of extracting your A-list celebrities

46:44.920 --> 46:48.920
who wanted to be in the movie but didn't want to be on set for more than three days.

46:48.920 --> 46:49.920
Macavity!

46:49.920 --> 46:53.920
So he ferrets his kidnapped celebrity cats, and also skimbleshanks,

46:53.920 --> 46:57.920
to a boat which is manned by Ray Winstone, who is also a cat.

47:00.920 --> 47:02.920
And despite Macavity's magical powers,

47:02.920 --> 47:05.920
once they, I don't know, get bored of being tied up with a large chain,

47:05.920 --> 47:09.920
they escape easily, they get back just in time for memory,

47:09.920 --> 47:11.920
and then this happens.

47:17.920 --> 47:21.920
Anyway, so when Grizabella shows up at the end after the whole boat fight,

47:21.920 --> 47:24.920
it's like, well the movie's already had its climax.

47:24.920 --> 47:27.920
We got old dude back, why are we still here?

47:27.920 --> 47:30.920
Oh right, the heavy side layer, the big climax.

47:30.920 --> 47:33.920
Making the Macavity subplot more of a focus leads to the resolution of that subplot

47:33.920 --> 47:37.920
getting way more screen time and involving way more characters.

47:37.920 --> 47:40.920
And it gives it the feel of the climax of the movie.

47:40.920 --> 47:42.920
But it's not. Memory is the climax.

47:42.920 --> 47:46.920
So the film builds in a new climax on the boat.

47:46.920 --> 47:49.920
Growltiger, make her walk the plank.

47:50.920 --> 47:52.920
While also keeping the original one.

47:52.920 --> 47:54.920
Jennifer Hudson is such a good singer that, like,

47:54.920 --> 47:58.920
I've never not watched this scene and gotten chills.

47:58.920 --> 48:01.920
Touch me.

48:01.920 --> 48:06.920
No, even leave me.

48:06.920 --> 48:08.920
Like, the arrangement and mixing are so good

48:08.920 --> 48:11.920
that even in the two rowdy screenings I've gone to,

48:11.920 --> 48:13.920
the audience reverently listens to this bit.

48:13.920 --> 48:17.920
The plot was always paper-thin and flimsy, and it was that by design.

48:17.920 --> 48:20.920
But the film doesn't make the plot, such as it were, less flimsy,

48:20.920 --> 48:22.920
it just creates more of it,

48:22.920 --> 48:25.920
and more nonsense that the film obligates itself to explain,

48:25.920 --> 48:28.920
because we have committed ourselves to the style of realism and logic.

48:30.920 --> 48:33.920
But ultimately, if you want to ask the question of why Cats is the way it is,

48:33.920 --> 48:36.920
Cats is the story of hubris.

48:36.920 --> 48:39.920
Awards hubris. Celebrity hubris. Director hubris.

48:39.920 --> 48:42.920
Just good old-fashioned hubris.

48:42.920 --> 48:45.920
Like Les Mis, they wanted to have an all-star cast.

48:45.920 --> 48:47.920
But Cats is a terrible thing to adapt for big stars,

48:47.920 --> 48:49.920
because, unlike Les Mis,

48:49.920 --> 48:52.920
it requires its cast to more or less be on stage the whole time,

48:52.920 --> 48:55.920
as opposed to Les Mis, where you can have Anne Hathaway

48:55.920 --> 48:57.920
for her 20 minutes of award-winning screen time,

48:57.920 --> 48:59.920
and then she's out for the rest of the movie.

48:59.920 --> 49:01.920
Cats is not designed like this.

49:01.920 --> 49:04.920
You're either a cat that has a solo, or a cat that is in the ensemble,

49:04.920 --> 49:06.920
but you're on stage more or less the whole time.

49:06.920 --> 49:09.920
Most of the songs don't have the cats singing about themselves,

49:09.920 --> 49:11.920
but another cat doing the singing.

49:11.920 --> 49:17.920
Gus is the cat at the theater door.

49:17.920 --> 49:21.920
The movie changes this by having them half the time just singing about themselves.

49:21.920 --> 49:26.920
Gus is the cat at the theater door.

49:26.920 --> 49:28.920
Gus the theater cat, Bustopher Jones,

49:28.920 --> 49:31.920
and especially the old Gumby Cat come to mind,

49:31.920 --> 49:34.920
as songs that were changed to give the stars more screen time.

49:34.920 --> 49:38.920
Don't get cocky!

49:38.920 --> 49:41.920
Because they certainly were not changed because the arrangement was better.

49:41.920 --> 49:44.920
And wow do they fuck up the old Gumby Cat by giving this song...

49:44.920 --> 49:47.920
When the deed's hustle and bustle is done,

49:47.920 --> 49:50.920
Then the Gumby Cat's work is but honey begun.

49:50.920 --> 49:53.920
...to Rebel Wilson, who is not only not a great singer...

49:53.920 --> 49:56.920
When the deed's hustle and bustle is done,

49:56.920 --> 49:58.920
Then the Gumby Cat's work...

49:58.920 --> 50:00.920
It also nixes a three-part harmony.

50:00.920 --> 50:03.920
Because if you want Rebel Wilson in this movie for 20 minutes,

50:03.920 --> 50:06.920
she gots to gets her a solo.

50:06.920 --> 50:14.920
But I...

50:14.920 --> 50:18.920
Or in the case of Macavity, they take a duet and make it a solo,

50:18.920 --> 50:21.920
because Taylor Swift is not sharing the stage, my friends.

50:21.920 --> 50:24.920
So what do we do with a bunch of celebrities that want solos

50:24.920 --> 50:26.920
and want to be in the movie?

50:26.920 --> 50:28.920
Because it's got the awards guy attached to it, see?

50:28.920 --> 50:30.920
So it's gonna win awards.

50:30.920 --> 50:33.920
But they don't wanna, you know, be on set for more than like three days.

50:33.920 --> 50:35.920
Corden's got his talk show to work around.

50:35.920 --> 50:37.920
Taylor Swift's on tour.

50:37.920 --> 50:40.920
You know what? We can't be bothered by being on set for more than three days.

50:40.920 --> 50:45.920
Well, how about Macavity kidnaps the A-listers?

50:45.920 --> 50:46.920
Ineffable.

50:46.920 --> 50:50.920
This not only solves our problem of not really having a threat or tension,

50:50.920 --> 50:53.920
it also means that we have a real solid good reason

50:53.920 --> 50:55.920
for these people not being in the background

50:55.920 --> 50:58.920
when they are not the center of attention.

50:58.920 --> 51:01.920
So not only do we now have a lazy reason to get our A-listers

51:01.920 --> 51:03.920
who don't want to be in the background out of the movie,

51:03.920 --> 51:05.920
we also made the movie worse.

51:05.920 --> 51:06.920
Macavity!

51:06.920 --> 51:07.920
Go team.

51:07.920 --> 51:09.920
And no awards hubris musical would be complete

51:09.920 --> 51:12.920
without the unnecessary new song.

51:13.920 --> 51:17.920
But at least you have beautiful ghosts.

51:17.920 --> 51:19.920
This one's called Beautiful Ghost.

51:19.920 --> 51:23.920
It was co-written by Taylor Swift and Andrew Lloyd Webber.

51:23.920 --> 51:25.920
You can't write a modern lyric for cats.

51:25.920 --> 51:30.920
So, like, if you can't get T.S. Eliot, like, get T.S.

51:30.920 --> 51:35.920
And it, like all of these musical numbers added to the movie to win an award,

51:35.920 --> 51:39.920
is completely unnecessary and totally grinds the movie to a halt.

51:39.920 --> 51:41.920
You know, more than it already was.

51:41.920 --> 51:46.920
I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts.

51:46.920 --> 51:48.920
If Francesca Hayward sounds kind of unsure,

51:48.920 --> 51:51.920
it's because she doesn't really know the song,

51:51.920 --> 51:54.920
because they more or less finished it, like, the day of.

51:54.920 --> 51:55.920
We were just rushing.

51:55.920 --> 51:57.920
We had written it the day before.

51:57.920 --> 52:00.920
I came in and we had the sheet music made up.

52:00.920 --> 52:02.920
Like an hour or two before they shot it.

52:02.920 --> 52:03.920
It's a dreadful day.

52:03.920 --> 52:04.920
Terrible.

52:05.920 --> 52:09.920
Taylor Swift over here looking at Lady Gaga, Oscar winner, like,

52:09.920 --> 52:10.920
I want that.

52:10.920 --> 52:12.920
One step closer to EGOT.

52:12.920 --> 52:15.920
And her singing it got us a Golden Globe nomination.

52:15.920 --> 52:16.920
Wow.

52:18.920 --> 52:21.920
So what, in the end, is the fallout of Cats?

52:21.920 --> 52:24.920
Are we going to have a bunch of cats copy Cats?

52:24.920 --> 52:27.920
Is Cats going to be like the Sharknado of musicals?

52:27.920 --> 52:28.920
Well, I doubt it.

52:28.920 --> 52:31.920
First of all, Cats is kind of one of a kind.

52:32.920 --> 52:35.920
It was a massive, massive loss.

52:35.920 --> 52:38.920
And despite the fact that it's probably going to be

52:38.920 --> 52:40.920
the new darling of midnight screenings

52:40.920 --> 52:43.920
and supplant the likes of Rocky Horror in the room

52:43.920 --> 52:44.920
with its cult following,

52:44.920 --> 52:45.920
Hi, doggie.

52:45.920 --> 52:47.920
these are not the tracks that any other studios

52:47.920 --> 52:48.920
are going to want to follow in.

52:48.920 --> 52:50.920
But I have heard some concern

52:50.920 --> 52:53.920
that this might kind of be the end of musical movies.

52:53.920 --> 52:55.920
In an Entertainment Weekly article,

52:55.920 --> 52:58.920
conflicted theater fan Mark Snitiker wrote,

52:58.920 --> 53:01.920
I fear a similar turmoil that happened in the 80s may occur again,

53:01.920 --> 53:03.920
because Cats is, at its core,

53:03.920 --> 53:06.920
a musical that confirms for people who hate musicals

53:06.920 --> 53:08.920
why they hate musicals.

53:08.920 --> 53:10.920
But though we did not ask for it,

53:10.920 --> 53:11.920
though we are not responsible for it,

53:11.920 --> 53:13.920
though we need not answer for it,

53:13.920 --> 53:16.920
I believe theater fans must not abandon Cats.

53:16.920 --> 53:17.920
Because as much as we may hate it,

53:17.920 --> 53:19.920
we can't deny that we care about it.

53:19.920 --> 53:21.920
You care about it.

53:21.920 --> 53:26.920
But how would you address a cat?

53:26.920 --> 53:28.920
Here is the thing.

53:28.920 --> 53:30.920
Some musicals, not all,

53:31.920 --> 53:34.920
but most of them require a visual medium

53:34.920 --> 53:37.920
that jives with the way that the musical itself is constructed.

53:37.920 --> 53:40.920
Les Misérables was constructed for the stage.

53:40.920 --> 53:43.920
Cats was constructed for the stage.

53:43.920 --> 53:45.920
That is the thing about theater,

53:45.920 --> 53:47.920
especially in a show like Hamilton,

53:47.920 --> 53:50.920
which basically has no props, let alone a set.

53:50.920 --> 53:52.920
It is constructed so that the audience

53:52.920 --> 53:54.920
has to imagine what's going on in the story.

53:54.920 --> 53:56.920
Overcoming that suspension of disbelief

53:56.920 --> 53:59.920
is built into the design of the medium

53:59.920 --> 54:01.920
in a way that it is not with film.

54:01.920 --> 54:03.920
But your traditional Oscar-bait movie

54:03.920 --> 54:04.920
does not allow for that.

54:04.920 --> 54:06.920
Oscar-bait movies demand visual realism,

54:06.920 --> 54:08.920
and it's very rare that something actually

54:08.920 --> 54:10.920
gets rewarded for being stylistic.

54:10.920 --> 54:11.920
It happens,

54:11.920 --> 54:14.920
but the Academy prefers gritty realism right now.

54:14.920 --> 54:15.920
That's just how it is.

54:15.920 --> 54:17.920
To this idea that there might be a backlash

54:17.920 --> 54:18.920
against musical films,

54:18.920 --> 54:21.920
that Cats might be the end of Hollywood

54:21.920 --> 54:22.920
taking musicals seriously,

54:22.920 --> 54:25.920
to that I say, good.

54:26.920 --> 54:28.920
Good f***ing riddance, Tom Hooper,

54:28.920 --> 54:31.920
and your musical awards-bait bullshit.

54:31.920 --> 54:33.920
Popular musical being adapted to films

54:33.920 --> 54:36.920
because Oscar-bait is a disease.

54:36.920 --> 54:37.920
The only way movies like this work

54:37.920 --> 54:39.920
is either through hyper-stylization

54:39.920 --> 54:40.920
in the vein of decent films

54:40.920 --> 54:42.920
like Moulin Rouge or Chicago,

54:42.920 --> 54:43.920
or animation,

54:43.920 --> 54:44.920
which likewise can rise visually

54:44.920 --> 54:46.920
to the magical unrealism

54:46.920 --> 54:48.920
inherent to the medium of musicals.

54:48.920 --> 54:50.920
But gritty realism?

54:50.920 --> 54:51.920
Oscar-bait?

54:51.920 --> 54:52.920
No thank.

54:52.920 --> 54:54.920
Like, I love Hamilton, but Hamilton the movie?

54:54.920 --> 54:58.920
I will kill your friends and family.

54:59.920 --> 55:00.920
Please no.

55:00.920 --> 55:02.920
Yes, I will gladly take your live recording

55:02.920 --> 55:04.920
that you filmed five years ago

55:04.920 --> 55:05.920
and won't release till next year.

55:05.920 --> 55:06.920
I will take it.

55:06.920 --> 55:08.920
But the Oscar-bait musical,

55:08.920 --> 55:11.920
the adaptation for adaptation's sake?

55:11.920 --> 55:13.920
Let it burn.

55:13.920 --> 55:14.920
Musical theater right now

55:14.920 --> 55:16.920
is kind of in a new golden age.

55:16.920 --> 55:17.920
It is doing just fine,

55:17.920 --> 55:20.920
and it does not need legitimacy from Hollywood.

55:20.920 --> 55:23.920
We do not need film adaptations of musicals

55:23.920 --> 55:24.920
just cause,

55:24.920 --> 55:26.920
just because it's brand name recognition,

55:26.920 --> 55:29.920
just because Chicago won a bunch of Oscars.

55:29.920 --> 55:31.920
So if Cats marks a demarcation

55:31.920 --> 55:32.920
where musicals aren't being adapted

55:32.920 --> 55:34.920
for the screen anymore?

55:36.920 --> 55:37.920
Good.

55:37.920 --> 55:39.920
I don't want Hadestown the movie.

55:39.920 --> 55:42.920
Super do not want Hamilton the movie.

55:42.920 --> 55:43.920
If you watch any one of these

55:43.920 --> 55:45.920
amateur animatics on YouTube,

55:45.920 --> 55:47.920
I promise you they work way better

55:47.920 --> 55:49.920
than anything Tom Hooper has ever done.

55:49.920 --> 55:51.920
So thank you, Cats.

55:51.920 --> 55:52.920
Thank you not only for being

55:52.920 --> 55:55.920
the true embodiment of modern horror,

55:55.920 --> 55:57.920
a monument to celebrity hubris,

55:57.920 --> 55:59.920
but also for ending this nonsense

55:59.920 --> 56:00.920
of bad musical adaptations

56:00.920 --> 56:03.920
with aggressive four-year consideration campaigns

56:03.920 --> 56:04.920
and Oscar dreams.

56:04.920 --> 56:06.920
Wow, we don't need it.

56:06.920 --> 56:08.920
Just save everybody a lot of heartache and money

56:08.920 --> 56:10.920
and just film the damn thing.

56:10.920 --> 56:12.920
Cats 98 will always be there,

56:12.920 --> 56:15.920
but Cats 2019 is a cautionary tale

56:15.920 --> 56:17.920
of a completely different sort.

56:22.920 --> 56:25.920
Someone is smoking over there.

56:25.920 --> 56:28.920
Something we cats would never do.

56:28.920 --> 56:31.920
Filling their lungs with thick, dark hair.

56:31.920 --> 56:33.920
What a disgusting thing to do.

56:33.920 --> 56:36.920
Cats have nine lives with eight to spare.

56:36.920 --> 56:37.920
Humans have one.

56:37.920 --> 56:39.920
With none to barter.

56:39.920 --> 56:40.920
Why do they smoke?

56:40.920 --> 56:41.920
Why don't they care?

56:41.920 --> 56:44.920
Humans are smart, but cats are smarter.

56:44.920 --> 56:46.920
Listen to Cats, you men.

56:46.920 --> 56:47.920
Listen to Cats, you men.

56:47.920 --> 56:49.920
Listen to Cats, you men.

56:49.920 --> 56:51.920
Listen to Cats, you men.

56:51.920 --> 56:54.920
Cats, you men and women, take care of your lungs.

56:54.920 --> 56:56.920
They're only human.

56:56.920 --> 56:57.920
The American Lung Association.

56:57.920 --> 56:59.920
The Christmas Seal People.

57:01.920 --> 57:02.920
An accident.

57:02.920 --> 57:03.920
An accident.

57:03.920 --> 57:04.920
An accident.

57:04.920 --> 57:06.920
The humans had an accident.

57:06.920 --> 57:08.920
There was a child in the car.

57:08.920 --> 57:09.920
A child.

57:09.920 --> 57:10.920
A child?

57:10.920 --> 57:11.920
A child?

57:11.920 --> 57:14.920
Cats have nine lives, children only one.

57:14.920 --> 57:16.920
Help them live that life.

57:16.920 --> 57:18.920
Buckle them into a car seat.

57:18.920 --> 57:21.920
No one wants a child to become a memory.

57:21.920 --> 57:28.920
Memory, all alone in the moonlight.
