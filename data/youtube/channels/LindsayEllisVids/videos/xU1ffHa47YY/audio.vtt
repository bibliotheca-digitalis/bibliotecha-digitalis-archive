WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.520
Let's get ready for DUMBOOOOOOO!

00:07.520 --> 00:10.320
Twice. They do it twice.

00:10.320 --> 00:12.480
Let's get ready for DUMBOOOOO!

00:12.480 --> 00:15.120
In the last couple of decades, there's been this trend of

00:15.120 --> 00:18.960
family films being self-aware and trope-savvy, as if to say,

00:18.960 --> 00:23.840
yes, parents in the room, we know that you have to endure this, but we also know

00:23.840 --> 00:28.800
that you are, in fact, smarter than your five-year-old.

00:28.800 --> 00:29.760
You did it.

00:29.760 --> 00:33.200
And while this has been present in Disney films since, debatably, Aladdin,

00:33.200 --> 00:37.680
this kind of meta-commentary has slowly been shifting from the occasional throwaway gag

00:37.680 --> 00:40.560
It's a small world after all

00:40.560 --> 00:43.280
No! No! Anything but that.

00:43.280 --> 00:46.160
to full-on important thematic statement.

00:46.160 --> 00:50.800
Enchanted is the real milestone here, and also represented a turning point for the studio in general,

00:50.800 --> 00:54.800
the entire premise of the film positing what would actually happen if a Disney princess

00:54.800 --> 00:58.480
were magically transported into the real world.

00:58.480 --> 01:01.360
She's yours!

01:01.360 --> 01:03.760
Don't see. It's okay, you know? Let's just walk.

01:03.760 --> 01:07.840
See, Patrick Dempsey's trying to get his daughter into, like, Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

01:12.480 --> 01:13.600
A book?

01:13.600 --> 01:15.920
He wants her to be a strong independent woman.

01:15.920 --> 01:20.160
But then, hey, a literal Disney princess brings magic into their lives.

01:20.160 --> 01:23.280
So, hey, I guess the truth is somewhere in the middle.

01:23.280 --> 01:27.440
You can be a strong independent woman who also buys Disney princess merch.

01:27.440 --> 01:31.360
And today, we're going to be checking out some new toys in honor of Princess Jasmine.

01:31.360 --> 01:35.040
It wasn't obvious at the time, but this was laying the groundwork for a much broader

01:35.040 --> 01:39.920
trend of Disney acknowledging that times have changed from the era of princesses being saved

01:39.920 --> 01:44.160
by princes, and it's cool that you want to go to law school, strong independent woman.

01:45.040 --> 01:47.760
But please don't stop buying our stuff.

01:48.960 --> 01:51.920
Audiences really liked this meta aspect of Enchanted,

01:51.920 --> 01:55.040
and we saw similar elements in other films, like Frozen.

01:55.040 --> 01:57.680
You got engaged to someone you just met that day?

01:57.680 --> 01:58.720
Yeah, anyway.

01:58.720 --> 01:59.280
Moana.

01:59.280 --> 02:03.440
If you wear a dress and you have an animal sidekick, you're a princess.

02:03.440 --> 02:05.760
And, more recently, Wreck-It Ralph.

02:05.760 --> 02:07.440
Ralph Breaks the Internet.

02:07.440 --> 02:08.400
Were you poisoned?

02:08.400 --> 02:08.960
No.

02:08.960 --> 02:09.600
Cursed?

02:09.600 --> 02:10.080
No.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.280
Kidnapped or enslaved?

02:11.280 --> 02:13.520
No, are you guys okay? Should I call the police?

02:13.520 --> 02:17.440
Soon, we entered the era of the live-action remake slash sequel slash spin-off,

02:17.440 --> 02:22.240
beginning debatably with Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland, starring girl-interrupted Alice,

02:22.320 --> 02:27.200
what-wears-armor, and a tortured tragic mad hatter, and whatever this is.

02:30.880 --> 02:33.920
As far as this trend goes, Cinderella felt like a test run.

02:33.920 --> 02:38.800
It had no real interest in reinventing the wheel so much, as much as it slides in on the whole

02:38.800 --> 02:43.440
knowing the prince before the ball slash riding a horse equals empowerment shtick

02:43.440 --> 02:47.120
that Ever After did better, because by this point that was old hat.

02:47.120 --> 02:50.960
But on the flip side of the coin we have Maleficent, or as I like to call it,

02:50.960 --> 02:51.680
my trash.

02:53.680 --> 02:55.120
Well, well.

02:55.120 --> 02:57.680
Maleficent is a remake, sort of,

02:57.680 --> 03:02.080
which works as meta commentary by suggesting that the villain wasn't one-dimensional,

03:02.080 --> 03:03.760
but had sympathetic motivations.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.720
Very sympathetic motivations.

03:06.720 --> 03:11.600
Motivations which I think that only Angelina Jolie knew what she was doing.

03:15.760 --> 03:16.800
I mean, I get it, girl.

03:16.800 --> 03:21.120
But really, the difference now, even from a movie as relatively recent as Maleficent,

03:21.120 --> 03:25.360
is that these films are not so much using commentary as a means to examine their past

03:25.360 --> 03:27.120
in the films that they are based on,

03:27.120 --> 03:30.960
as much as they are using meta commentary to justify their own existence.

03:31.760 --> 03:35.920
Teaching another girl to read isn't one enough.

03:35.920 --> 03:36.420
Get it?

03:37.120 --> 03:39.520
The original movie wasn't empowering.

03:40.960 --> 03:42.000
But now it is.

03:42.880 --> 03:47.040
The tendency to self-correct the outdated or questionable morality of the source material

03:47.040 --> 03:49.120
is all over the place in these remakes.

03:49.120 --> 03:51.520
Dumbo, in particular, is ripe with it.

03:53.680 --> 03:54.640
Look at the sign!

03:55.360 --> 03:55.840
Dumbo!

03:56.720 --> 04:01.600
See, in the original film, Dumbo accidentally gets lit on some champagne and hallucinates.

04:04.800 --> 04:05.280
But here...

04:05.280 --> 04:06.960
Champagne for Dumbo!

04:07.520 --> 04:11.680
No, we couldn't allow underaged elephants to drink.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.440
What would the children think?

04:17.440 --> 04:20.560
And we're the original Dumbo reunited with his mother at the end of the movie,

04:20.560 --> 04:24.000
who seems to be enjoying retirement on her own train car.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.960
The remake has them return to the jungle,

04:26.960 --> 04:30.640
and Danny DeVito gets an epilogue where he explains to the viewer that the circus is

04:30.640 --> 04:31.920
now cruelty free.

04:31.920 --> 04:33.200
And the movie is not.

04:33.200 --> 04:37.520
Dumbo gets an epilogue where he explains to the viewer that the circus is now cruelty free.

04:37.520 --> 04:41.840
We believe no wild animals shall be held in captivity.

04:41.840 --> 04:45.280
So the remake has this forced Aesop that animal cruelty is bad.

04:45.840 --> 04:48.240
You know, which is not a bad thing in and of itself.

04:48.240 --> 04:51.440
It is bad, and I'm glad animals in circuses have been phased out,

04:51.440 --> 04:54.240
but the Dumbo happens in the late 1910s,

04:54.240 --> 04:59.200
and that this is how the film ends feels a little disingenuous.

05:03.200 --> 05:06.880
Like, audiences know it was a different time.

05:06.880 --> 05:11.120
I don't think anyone wanted or expected a Dumbo remake to have a message about how it's

05:11.120 --> 05:13.520
probably kind of unethical to have circus animals.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.880
Here I make a funny here ugly baby.

05:16.880 --> 05:20.880
So instead of addressing actual criticisms that people have had of Dumbo,

05:20.880 --> 05:21.840
and we'll get to that,

05:21.840 --> 05:24.880
it seems that the film is presenting itself as thoughtful by

05:25.600 --> 05:29.920
fixing a moral outrage that, well, no one but PETA really had.

05:30.480 --> 05:33.040
So some of this strategy is built either around

05:33.040 --> 05:37.520
blatantly ignoring said dated material and cutesily joking it away,

05:37.520 --> 05:40.240
but in the interest of pretending that Disney is at least

05:40.240 --> 05:44.400
somewhat more hip to the criticism that it faces as a powerful conglomerate,

05:44.400 --> 05:48.720
it has latched onto addressing other critiques with that thing that the kids like nowadays,

05:49.360 --> 05:50.240
the wokeness.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.640
How do you do, fellow kids?

05:54.640 --> 05:55.140
What?

05:55.520 --> 05:58.160
Because these movies need a reason to exist, right?

05:58.880 --> 06:00.720
So it's that thing you like already.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.640
But woke.

06:02.640 --> 06:04.960
I've done a whole 35 minute video on this topic,

06:04.960 --> 06:09.920
so I will be brief in my beating of this very dead horse and very girl boss horse.

06:09.920 --> 06:13.840
But the 2017 Beauty and the Beast remake is what I see as the turning point

06:13.840 --> 06:17.360
from meta commentary as a fun way of reexamining Disney canon

06:17.360 --> 06:21.600
to woke meta commentary as justifying the film's existing at all.

06:21.600 --> 06:24.560
Yes, the poor thing is probably in there scared to death.

06:24.560 --> 06:25.280
Exactly.

06:25.280 --> 06:31.360
This is where the movies stop trying to expand and instead want to be more like,

06:31.360 --> 06:35.520
yeah, we've read the YMMV slash head scratchers page on TV Tropes,

06:35.520 --> 06:38.080
so let's nitpick our own movies.

06:38.080 --> 06:38.880
What's your name?

06:39.520 --> 06:40.880
That is a hairbrush.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.800
She doesn't have Stockholm syndrome.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.280
She's- she- she basically says so.

06:45.920 --> 06:49.120
You've taken me as your prisoner and now you want to have dinner with me?

06:49.120 --> 06:52.000
The Beast negs her and she rolls her eyes at him.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.080
Actually, Romeo and Juliet's my favorite play.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.840
Why is that not a surprise?

06:57.840 --> 06:59.040
She tries to escape.

06:59.760 --> 07:01.760
See, what a girl boss.

07:01.760 --> 07:04.000
She's an inventor who reads.

07:04.720 --> 07:05.680
Girl boss.

07:05.680 --> 07:10.160
Their utter lack of chemistry is, I don't know, feminist somehow.

07:12.560 --> 07:16.480
And as much as the 1991 Beauty and the Beast was a success for the studio,

07:16.480 --> 07:20.560
it also became an easy target for bad faith or lazy criticisms.

07:20.560 --> 07:23.760
It feels like an exercise of self-flagellation,

07:23.760 --> 07:25.840
but one that the audience is in on.

07:25.840 --> 07:29.280
Since Disney Studios' brand is so tied up in the idea of princesses,

07:29.280 --> 07:32.640
it's been constantly re-evaluating its relationship to the concept.

07:32.640 --> 07:35.360
We definitely saw some evolution in the 90s.

07:35.360 --> 07:38.000
Then maybe I don't want to be a princess anymore.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.600
But in the wake of Lean In,

07:39.600 --> 07:44.640
it's like we can't have a female character without really overt text about how empowered she is.

07:49.280 --> 07:51.440
In Dumbo, there is a girl child.

07:51.520 --> 07:53.920
Colin Farrell's daughter who wants to be a scientist.

07:58.720 --> 08:01.440
Not a circus performer like her father once.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.640
Which, fine.

08:05.280 --> 08:08.240
Except it plays into the plot not at all.

08:08.240 --> 08:14.160
She doesn't discover anything about Dumbo or figure out the aerodynamics of elephants flying.

08:14.160 --> 08:18.640
It serves no other purpose other than to show that she's not like other girls,

08:18.640 --> 08:22.000
what with their frippery and need for attention.

08:24.240 --> 08:27.680
This girl is like two lines away from pulling a Neil deGrasse Tyson

08:27.680 --> 08:31.440
and asking her dad if he knows how many people die in elephant-related accidents

08:31.440 --> 08:32.960
compared to the Spanish flu.

08:32.960 --> 08:35.440
And in The Lion King, not only is Nala's part expanded,

08:35.440 --> 08:37.280
but Shenzi is a girl boss now.

08:37.280 --> 08:38.160
You know, but sinister.

08:48.800 --> 08:53.520
Which means they listened to the feminist critique of the original or something.

08:53.520 --> 08:56.480
It wasn't a critique that any actual human person had.

08:57.440 --> 09:03.120
But okay, let's pretend there was this big groundswell of mad feminists who were like,

09:03.120 --> 09:05.600
yeah, Shenzi should have been a girl boss.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.440
And Disney was like, yeah, we hear you.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.720
There's only one true thing you ever set, Scar.

09:11.600 --> 09:14.960
The hyena's belly is never full.

09:14.960 --> 09:19.200
So they added that, but changed nothing else,

09:19.200 --> 09:23.120
nor does the film change any of the elements that people actually did take issue with,

09:23.120 --> 09:25.040
so thanks?

09:25.040 --> 09:28.720
Aladdin likewise features new empowered girl boss Jasmine.

09:28.720 --> 09:32.080
I was born to do more than marry some useless prince.

09:32.080 --> 09:34.960
Jasmine in this version doesn't only want to marry for love,

09:34.960 --> 09:38.160
which to her seems kind of a secondary concern, if that.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.760
She wants to be the Sultan.

09:39.760 --> 09:43.200
I have been preparing for this my whole life.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.320
She quite literally aspires to be a girl boss.

09:47.760 --> 09:51.920
You shall be the next Sultan.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.360
See, the monarchy isn't bad.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.320
It's progressive.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.400
It just needs a female CEO.

09:56.400 --> 10:00.880
Also, Jasmine, one of the most iconic, dynamic, and beloved princesses,

10:00.880 --> 10:06.080
gets her own power ballad about how she's not speechless and you're gonna listen to her.

10:06.320 --> 10:10.800
It won't be silence.

10:10.800 --> 10:14.160
Even though that was never an issue for that character in the original.

10:14.160 --> 10:19.120
How dare you, all of you, standing around deciding my future?

10:19.680 --> 10:21.600
I am not a prize to be won.

10:21.600 --> 10:24.320
And also isn't really an issue in this movie either.

10:24.320 --> 10:25.920
She doesn't really self-censor.

10:25.920 --> 10:28.480
She's not shy about her needs or stating them.

10:28.480 --> 10:32.400
Also, there's something just kind of hilarious about a character power ballading to the gods

10:32.400 --> 10:35.680
about being speechless and then immediately being taken prisoner.

10:35.680 --> 10:36.800
And needing to be rescued.

10:41.680 --> 10:46.000
So the goal here is to make princesses feel still relevant.

10:46.000 --> 10:51.120
And they do that in the way that's effectively, you know, we need more female CEOs.

10:51.120 --> 10:52.640
The people, they make it beautiful.

10:53.360 --> 10:55.280
And they deserve a leader who knows that.

10:55.280 --> 10:59.680
And with that in mind, I really can't wait to see how they're gonna woke-ify The Little Mermaid.

10:59.680 --> 11:02.320
Like, it'll have Ariel really lean into that, like,

11:02.320 --> 11:05.840
bright young women ready to stand line and have her want to be on land

11:05.840 --> 11:08.960
because she found a shipwrecked copy of Girl, Wash Your Face.

11:08.960 --> 11:12.320
And they're gonna go way out of their way to say it's not for a guy.

11:12.320 --> 11:13.280
It's not for a guy.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.680
He's just a, he's a fringe benefit.

11:17.680 --> 11:23.920
So the metatextual inclusion of gender-related progress gets addressed by adding lean-in feminism

11:23.920 --> 11:25.920
and making everyone a girl boss.

11:25.920 --> 11:31.920
But how do these new live-action movies address critique of race in older Disney films?

11:31.920 --> 11:33.520
That's certainly a hot topic.

11:34.240 --> 11:38.480
Well, here is a Washington Post article that asked that very question about Dumbo.

11:38.480 --> 11:39.840
How do they deal with it?

11:40.960 --> 11:41.600
They don't.

11:41.600 --> 11:45.600
Despite being more than happy to address gender-related criticisms in the metatext

11:45.600 --> 11:50.480
by just adding a coat of girl boss paint, race-related issues go completely ignored.

11:50.480 --> 11:54.480
Take, for instance, The Lion King, a story about how divine right birthright monarchy

11:54.480 --> 11:57.280
is not only good but divine by nature,

11:57.280 --> 12:00.800
and also about how segregation is probably best for everybody.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.800
Now, these themes are there in the original,

12:02.800 --> 12:07.440
but given that the original elevates itself into this magical emotional realm,

12:07.440 --> 12:09.760
it just reads differently than the remake,

12:09.760 --> 12:13.200
which is run through this hyper-realism sterilization filter.

12:13.200 --> 12:17.120
So while Lion King 2019 does a little bit of the girl boss thing,

12:17.120 --> 12:21.280
it also kind of doubles down on the whole race mixing is bad thing.

12:21.280 --> 12:25.840
It can't just be this obscure nature is mad at the disruption of the natural order

12:25.840 --> 12:27.040
as it was in the original.

12:27.040 --> 12:31.840
The text has to explain why the hyenas are bad for the Pride Lands.

12:31.840 --> 12:35.360
It has to justify why they are naturally worse than lions.

12:36.000 --> 12:42.560
The lions will eat after the hyenas, and they don't leave much behind.

12:42.560 --> 12:46.960
But to me, the sidestepping of race issues is nowhere more evident than in Dumbo.

12:46.960 --> 12:50.240
The original Dumbo was kind of beautiful in how flawed it was,

12:50.240 --> 12:53.600
including the elements that are abrasive to modern sensibilities.

12:57.760 --> 13:00.640
Which happened, and are a part of Disney history,

13:00.640 --> 13:04.080
and we're not doing ourselves any favors by pretending that they did not.

13:04.080 --> 13:07.440
Take, for instance, the scene of baby Dumbo accidentally getting lit,

13:07.440 --> 13:09.280
which, yes, we need to lampshade.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.040
Now, the pink elephant sequence,

13:19.040 --> 13:21.280
which is one of the best sequences from early Disney

13:21.280 --> 13:25.920
because it's just so unapologetic and creepy and, you know, good,

13:25.920 --> 13:27.440
does get referenced in the remake.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.320
Um, okay.

13:32.960 --> 13:34.000
Pink elephants.

13:34.640 --> 13:35.140
So?

13:35.920 --> 13:36.480
Sure.

13:36.480 --> 13:40.400
Dumbo is also arguably the most, let's be charitable and call it,

13:40.400 --> 13:42.960
racially insensitive of the feature canon.

13:42.960 --> 13:46.800
The song of the roustabout shows these guys pitching a circus tent

13:46.800 --> 13:48.160
and has lyrics like this.

13:48.160 --> 13:57.040
So, that's completely ignored in the remake.

13:57.040 --> 13:59.600
More infamous, and perhaps the most glaring in omission,

13:59.600 --> 14:02.000
are the crows Dumbo befriends towards the end of the film.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.560
The crows employ some pretty egregious stereotyping,

14:08.560 --> 14:10.640
singing a song written by white songwriters.

14:10.720 --> 14:21.120
The crows voiced largely, if not entirely, by white actors,

14:21.120 --> 14:24.720
featuring a lead crow named by the animation department Jim Crow.

14:28.480 --> 14:31.520
And it took us a while to figure out whether this was apocryphal or not,

14:31.520 --> 14:35.280
because Dumbo is, like, the least chronicled of all of the Disney movies

14:35.280 --> 14:37.200
and there basically are no production notes

14:37.200 --> 14:39.280
and what few there are don't actually mention it,

14:39.280 --> 14:40.480
but turns out, yep, yep.

14:41.200 --> 14:41.920
That was a thing.

14:41.920 --> 14:45.440
And I know there is discourse on how to handle history like this,

14:45.440 --> 14:47.840
but pretending that it just didn't exist,

14:47.840 --> 14:50.400
just ignoring it all together and pretending it didn't happen,

14:50.400 --> 14:53.760
how is that helping make the world better or educate people?

15:00.880 --> 15:05.520
The crows are a part of the DNA of Dumbo just as much as baby mine or pink elephants,

15:05.520 --> 15:09.200
but unlike those two, which are ham-fistedly jammed into the remake,

15:09.840 --> 15:11.280
the crows don't even get mentioned.

15:11.280 --> 15:13.040
The song isn't there, save a few words,

15:13.040 --> 15:16.480
which strikes me as noteworthy since the song itself is pretty tame.

15:29.840 --> 15:32.800
But the crows aren't referenced, and even Dumbo's feather,

15:32.800 --> 15:35.360
which was gifted to him by the crows in the original,

15:35.360 --> 15:44.400
has somehow also managed to turn white.

15:44.400 --> 15:48.720
It's like there was never racism here in this universe and there never will be.

15:48.720 --> 15:51.760
We just kind of live in this nice multi-cultiverse where

15:51.760 --> 15:55.760
other forms of bigotry exist and are not the ones we live with in the real world,

15:55.760 --> 15:56.560
but, you know,

16:00.800 --> 16:03.280
we have our cutesy analogs sometimes.

16:06.320 --> 16:09.600
If the films acknowledge racism at all, it's never systemic,

16:09.600 --> 16:13.600
but the product of a few bad apples, i.e. the princess and the frog.

16:13.600 --> 16:18.560
Which is why a little woman of your background would have had her hands full.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.400
And not the system itself.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.960
Systemic racism doesn't exist in the metaverse.

16:22.960 --> 16:25.280
If it does, again princess and the frog,

16:25.280 --> 16:29.760
it can be handled with basically the ideological equivalent of a good guy with a gun.

16:30.320 --> 16:35.280
John Goodman just needs to realize that the woman who makes his favorite beignets

16:35.280 --> 16:36.320
needs more money.

16:39.760 --> 16:40.800
He's a nice guy.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.520
There are good rich whites.

16:44.400 --> 16:48.080
It seems like meaningfully addressing any of these societal problems in the

16:48.080 --> 16:52.160
text of their films would mean that Disney would have to really acknowledge its own past.

16:52.800 --> 16:57.200
Which, well, that's not really why these films have meta commentary now, is it?

16:57.200 --> 16:59.280
They aren't woke to make the world better.

16:59.280 --> 17:00.880
They're woke for you to buy stuff.

17:05.280 --> 17:19.680
It's a whole new world.

17:21.280 --> 17:22.400
To lean into.

17:22.960 --> 17:27.120
See, there's no like girl wash your face lean in feminism that Disney can make marketable

17:27.120 --> 17:28.800
where race is concerned.

17:28.800 --> 17:33.040
So where they can overcorrect the princesses and make them more marketable by turning them

17:33.040 --> 17:37.520
into girl bosses, ain't much they can do to correct critique of race in Disney movies

17:37.520 --> 17:41.920
that's, you know, corporate approved, so they just ignore it.

17:41.920 --> 17:46.240
But one of the more nefarious of these joking about the sons of the father aspects of these

17:46.240 --> 17:53.600
remakes comes at the expense of the Walt Disney Company itself and its business model.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.280
Dumbo really leans into this.

17:55.280 --> 17:59.840
The plot of the original Dumbo comprises basically the first act of the 2019 remake,

17:59.840 --> 18:04.800
and from there goes into what appears to be a winking meta-critique of Disney itself.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.160
Join me in my family.

18:06.880 --> 18:09.440
Let me take us all into the future.

18:09.440 --> 18:13.760
Let me take us all to Dreamland.

18:13.760 --> 18:18.160
With really obvious and heavy-handed references to Disneyland in its theme park,

18:18.160 --> 18:23.600
owned by Michael Keaton's villain, Vandermeer, himself a weird mixture of P.T. Barnum, Walt Disney,

18:23.600 --> 18:29.280
and Vanderbilt, there are blatant nods to actual attractions like the Astro Orbiter

18:29.280 --> 18:33.520
and the Carousel of Progress and just park aesthetic in general.

18:33.520 --> 18:36.560
There's a wonder of science attraction that, well...

18:37.280 --> 18:38.960
Dad, wonders of science.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.360
Don't worry, honey, it's bought by ExxonMobil.

18:41.360 --> 18:45.120
Also within this is a weird half-assed critique of the overuse of the word

18:45.120 --> 18:48.480
dream and the need to feel like a child again.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.000
You've made me a child again.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.520
I'm still parsing out what the intention of this weird take on Disney's own past

18:53.520 --> 18:56.880
and corporate culture is meant to say, besides a weird

18:56.880 --> 19:00.880
Well, you can't hate their corporate monopoly if they make fun of themselves.

19:00.880 --> 19:02.480
Self-awareness is relatable.

19:07.600 --> 19:11.680
It feels like commentary, but it's commentary that does not say anything.

19:11.680 --> 19:14.240
Vandermeer's park looks like Disneyland,

19:14.240 --> 19:17.920
but beyond that it seems to be an indictment of P.T. Barnum more than anything,

19:17.920 --> 19:21.600
especially since the film ends with Dumbo going back to the jungle

19:21.600 --> 19:24.960
and Woke Circus getting rid of all their animal acts.

19:24.960 --> 19:28.880
Mary Poppins Returns also has a curious relationship to wealth and power.

19:28.880 --> 19:31.280
Jane has grown up to be a union organizer.

19:31.280 --> 19:36.000
No, it's the Society for the Protection of the Rights of the Underpaid Citizens of England.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
A labor organizer.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.520
Which, considering Walt's relationship to unions itself, is kind of hilarious.

19:41.520 --> 19:43.920
But she is mostly portrayed as kind of a ditz,

19:43.920 --> 19:48.160
and the ending relies on her asking the Lamplighters for unpaid labor,

19:48.160 --> 19:51.520
not for the benefit of any kind of, you know, labor union,

19:51.600 --> 19:55.520
but to help her save her house that she owns.

19:55.520 --> 19:58.800
Jane's advocacy doesn't really do anything for organized labor.

19:58.800 --> 20:02.400
If anything, it's just more, you know, just ripping off the original, you know.

20:02.400 --> 20:06.400
Well, her mom was a suffragette, so Jane's a pinko, I guess.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.520
But the main plot surrounds the banks,

20:10.080 --> 20:14.480
and also the bank, which wants to repossess the bank's house.

20:14.480 --> 20:18.080
In the original, the bank is portrayed as something of a neutral evil.

20:18.080 --> 20:20.080
Heartless and bottom line obsessed.

20:20.080 --> 20:23.680
Something that Mr. Banks overvalues at the expense of his family.

20:23.680 --> 20:28.800
Meanwhile, in sequel land, the main villain is a rogue Colin Firth, the bad rich man.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.640
The Banks family is on the cusp of losing their house,

20:36.640 --> 20:40.480
because Michael is bad at money, and Jane is a communist.

20:40.480 --> 20:43.280
A home they love so much they've tied their identity to it,

20:43.280 --> 20:46.960
in much the same way that Mr. Banks did his job in the original.

20:46.960 --> 20:49.360
Towards the end, it looks like they're going to lose their house,

20:49.360 --> 20:51.840
unless they do the thing by the stroke of midnight.

20:51.840 --> 20:54.320
But don't worry, the one bad man is removed,

20:54.320 --> 20:57.760
they are able to keep their house because the bank itself is good and moral,

20:57.760 --> 20:59.840
and is on the side of the middle class, and thus,

21:03.120 --> 21:05.680
the bank's identity and happiness can continue to be tied

21:05.680 --> 21:07.520
to their possession of material things.

21:08.080 --> 21:10.000
And I find that interesting, because in the original,

21:10.000 --> 21:13.760
Mr. Banks lets go of the thing that he had erroneously attached

21:13.760 --> 21:15.840
his own value and sense of identity to.

21:15.840 --> 21:20.960
But in the remake, don't worry, they never have to have that moment of self-reevaluation,

21:20.960 --> 21:24.160
because they never lose the thing they were worried about losing,

21:24.160 --> 21:27.280
because good capitalist is here to save the day.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.280
And he's played by Dick Van Dyke.

21:33.840 --> 21:35.280
Dick Van Dyke is over here like,

21:35.280 --> 21:38.800
oh, the bank would never intentionally hurt their trusting customers.

21:38.880 --> 21:46.880
A large business always has the best intentions.

21:46.880 --> 21:51.040
Big corporations aren't bad, but the rare nefarious individual.

21:51.040 --> 21:52.240
That is the bad one.

21:52.240 --> 21:55.600
It is not the system that is bad, but a few bad apples.

21:55.600 --> 21:59.600
If anything, the transition from old Disney to new Disney is a transition from

21:59.600 --> 22:02.640
monarchy is good to capitalism is good.

22:03.280 --> 22:07.360
There's always a good king or a good bank or a good businessman,

22:07.360 --> 22:10.480
and these conclusions, while they pay lip service to progressive ideals,

22:10.480 --> 22:14.320
ultimately conclude that nothing of the status quo need be challenged.

22:14.320 --> 22:17.600
Not really, which feels pretty convenient when the company producing these things

22:17.600 --> 22:20.320
own more and more of the media that we consume every day.

22:20.320 --> 22:22.560
But now Disney will have full control of Hulu,

22:23.280 --> 22:27.680
will control its customer management, its technology, its data sharing.

22:27.680 --> 22:32.000
This is not to say that empowering women to be leaders or a family keeping their house

22:32.000 --> 22:37.280
or cruelty-free circuses are a bad thing, but if that's all you got, then that's not progress.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.240
That's just marketing.

22:38.960 --> 22:44.480
These movies are redundant, with a couple of exceptions, weird outliers like Maleficent,

22:44.480 --> 22:46.880
and I guess you could make a case for The Jungle Book.

22:46.880 --> 22:50.000
But for the most part, these movies don't need to exist,

22:50.000 --> 22:54.800
so they give themselves a metatextual reason to exist in the text.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.800
It's that thing you like, but woke.

22:57.360 --> 23:01.760
For The Lion King, it's take the majestic thing and run it through this hyper-sterilized

23:01.760 --> 23:02.800
realism filter.

23:02.800 --> 23:06.640
For Beauty and the Beast, it's sending this love story about personal growth

23:06.640 --> 23:09.520
and forgiveness through the Beast for She filter.

23:09.520 --> 23:13.360
And for Aladdin, it's sending Princess Jasmine through the Girlboss filter.

23:13.360 --> 23:17.920
And for Dumbo, it's take the problematic thing and de-problematizing it to the point

23:17.920 --> 23:21.920
where it's unrecognizable and Dumbo isn't even the main character anymore.

23:23.040 --> 23:24.960
Wow, this is a disaster.

23:25.600 --> 23:30.320
Like, okay, so you've taken a property from the 1940s and you have identified that it

23:30.320 --> 23:36.000
has certain insensitivities relating to race and animal cruelty.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.080
You have declared the thing problematic.

23:39.280 --> 23:40.720
Yeah, great, good for you.

23:40.720 --> 23:41.920
In the words of Alan Arkin,

23:42.640 --> 23:43.360
So?

23:43.360 --> 23:47.360
And that's one of the more frustrating things about this era of pop criticism,

23:47.360 --> 23:49.760
where we look back on media history and be like,

23:49.760 --> 23:54.880
thing bad, and people can look on history with this smugness of hindsight and say,

23:54.880 --> 23:56.640
you know that thing you liked as a kid?

23:57.280 --> 24:00.160
Well, it was, it had problems.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.320
It was problematic.

24:03.200 --> 24:04.960
Did I blow your mind yet?

24:06.000 --> 24:07.360
And it's like, okay.

24:08.480 --> 24:09.120
So?

24:09.120 --> 24:11.840
You've taken step one, you've identified the problem.

24:11.840 --> 24:13.600
What do you want to do with that?

24:13.600 --> 24:18.000
Are you that guy in that Onion article that always likes to bring up that John Lennon

24:18.000 --> 24:19.280
beat his wife?

24:19.280 --> 24:22.720
Do you want to drag the company that made the thing through the street?

24:22.720 --> 24:27.200
Do you want to wave it off and say it was a product of its time, so who cares?

24:27.200 --> 24:32.000
Or do you want to do what Disney is doing with its remakes and just erase the history

24:32.000 --> 24:35.440
and just ignore the stuff that aged poorly and just pretend it never happened?

24:36.400 --> 24:38.480
Wow, this is a disaster.

24:38.480 --> 24:43.280
Because a part of media literacy is taking film history, understanding its context,

24:43.280 --> 24:46.480
exploring different viewpoints on the media and the history in question,

24:46.480 --> 24:49.920
and accepting it for what it was, not pretending it didn't happen.

24:50.640 --> 24:54.000
There are some power structures that Disney movies are never going to challenge.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.840
The original entries in the Disney film canon were never about challenge or change,

24:57.840 --> 25:01.200
and so it goes with their remakes and their reboots and their sequels.

25:01.200 --> 25:05.040
It's not the system that's bad, it's that women aren't allowed to be CEOs.

25:05.040 --> 25:07.840
Let Jasmine be a girl boss, Sultan.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.240
It's not that class stratification is bad,

25:10.240 --> 25:14.080
it's just Belle totally sticking it to those narrow-minded poor townies

25:14.080 --> 25:16.720
by owning a VC-funded washing machine startup.

25:16.720 --> 25:19.120
Only Maleficent, hot mess though it is,

25:19.120 --> 25:22.640
kind of feels a little transgressive and an outlier in this trend

25:22.640 --> 25:25.280
because it's actually centered on women and their pain,

25:25.280 --> 25:27.520
and actually challenges the foundation of the original

25:27.520 --> 25:29.760
in a way that you don't see in any of these other movies.

25:29.760 --> 25:33.040
And Maleficent's girl boss angle doesn't feel so hollow

25:33.040 --> 25:35.040
since it ends with the ladies in power,

25:35.040 --> 25:40.080
and we actually develop the originally very underdeveloped lead of Aurora

25:40.080 --> 25:42.800
in lieu of trying to correct anything in the original.

25:42.800 --> 25:45.600
It must needs be remarked that one of the big issues here,

25:45.600 --> 25:48.960
especially once Disney started dipping into the waters of making animated films

25:48.960 --> 25:51.280
with non-European settings or characters of color,

25:51.280 --> 25:54.800
is that people of color or from the backgrounds of the people being depicted

25:54.800 --> 25:57.120
were rarely involved in the behind-the-scenes work.

25:57.120 --> 26:00.000
With the live-action films, there could have been space to correct this,

26:00.000 --> 26:04.960
but Guy Ritchie is directing Aladdin, I guess.

26:06.160 --> 26:08.240
Was all of Bollywood busy?

26:09.280 --> 26:09.760
All of it?

26:15.200 --> 26:19.680
Again, games made but ultimately still minute compared to the sheer volume of content

26:19.680 --> 26:22.720
that Disney puts out, especially in the live-action department

26:22.720 --> 26:27.120
that is presently doing pretty, pretty well.

26:27.440 --> 26:31.440
Why the company wants to show that they recognize their problematic past with gender

26:31.440 --> 26:34.400
but totally ignores its problematic history with race

26:34.400 --> 26:38.480
is because it's really easy to make lean-in feminism profitable.

26:38.480 --> 26:41.360
After all, Disney princesses are girl bosses now.

26:41.920 --> 26:46.640
Do people assume all your problems got solved because a big strong man showed up?

26:46.640 --> 26:48.720
Yes! What is up with that?

26:48.720 --> 26:50.800
Just like you will be one day.

26:53.120 --> 26:56.160
And this is why I find Disney wokeness highly cynical.

26:56.960 --> 27:00.560
They're more than happy to show how they've changed in some regards,

27:00.560 --> 27:02.240
but only the profitable ones.

27:02.240 --> 27:05.840
They have better race representation now, which is good,

27:05.840 --> 27:10.080
but they aren't about to admit that there was ever, ever anything the company has to move beyond.

27:10.640 --> 27:13.840
Song of the South? That didn't happen. That's never getting a release.

27:13.840 --> 27:16.560
These parts of Dumbo? That didn't happen.

27:16.560 --> 27:20.480
What Makes the Red Man Red? We Are Siamese? Didn't happen.

27:20.480 --> 27:23.200
There's no like corporate-approved profitable way to make any

27:23.200 --> 27:26.720
metatextual examination of Disney's history with race representation,

27:27.280 --> 27:31.200
or lack thereof, profitable. So they don't.

27:31.840 --> 27:34.640
The insidious thing to me is that with Disney positioning itself

27:34.640 --> 27:37.040
to be the biggest media monopoly in history,

27:37.040 --> 27:42.160
the trend is less about meta-commentary but priming people to be loyal to the company.

27:42.720 --> 27:45.840
After all, the company sees and hears your criticisms.

27:45.840 --> 27:48.080
It agrees with your ideals about inclusivity.

27:48.080 --> 27:51.680
So don't worry about the fact that they're well on their way to owning everything.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.560
They're here to support you being a girl boss.

27:55.600 --> 27:58.320
Do you have daddy issues? I don't even have a mom!

27:58.320 --> 27:59.760
Neither do we!

27:59.760 --> 28:03.440
And speaking of being a boss, babe, we need to pay the bills.

28:04.320 --> 28:05.920
Because we live in a society.

28:05.920 --> 28:07.520
So this episode was sponsored by Audible,

28:07.520 --> 28:11.360
and originally this episode was going to have way more to do with Disney in the 90s,

28:11.360 --> 28:16.320
but then it didn't. But I'm going to recommend Disney War on Audible to you anyway,

28:16.320 --> 28:20.320
if you want to read about the supervillain rise and fall of Michael Eisner.

28:21.280 --> 28:36.480
Try saying that ten times fast.

28:46.400 --> 28:49.760
Audible members can easily exchange any title that they don't love at any time,

28:49.760 --> 28:54.080
and members keep their library of listens forever, even if they cancel.

28:54.080 --> 28:56.800

29:13.200 --> 29:14.960
Yes, I have to say this twice.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.680
Like it's the radio.

29:17.680 --> 29:20.320
And now I finally earned this.

29:21.520 --> 29:33.600
And I don't even know what these things are called.

29:47.680 --> 29:55.600
So
