0	7520	Let's get ready for DUMBOOOOOOO!
7520	10320	Twice. They do it twice.
10320	12480	Let's get ready for DUMBOOOOO!
12480	15120	In the last couple of decades, there's been this trend of
15120	18960	family films being self-aware and trope-savvy, as if to say,
18960	23840	yes, parents in the room, we know that you have to endure this, but we also know
23840	28800	that you are, in fact, smarter than your five-year-old.
28800	29760	You did it.
29760	33200	And while this has been present in Disney films since, debatably, Aladdin,
33200	37680	this kind of meta-commentary has slowly been shifting from the occasional throwaway gag
37680	40560	It's a small world after all
40560	43280	No! No! Anything but that.
43280	46160	to full-on important thematic statement.
46160	50800	Enchanted is the real milestone here, and also represented a turning point for the studio in general,
50800	54800	the entire premise of the film positing what would actually happen if a Disney princess
54800	58480	were magically transported into the real world.
58480	61360	She's yours!
61360	63760	Don't see. It's okay, you know? Let's just walk.
63760	67840	See, Patrick Dempsey's trying to get his daughter into, like, Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
72480	73600	A book?
73600	75920	He wants her to be a strong independent woman.
75920	80160	But then, hey, a literal Disney princess brings magic into their lives.
80160	83280	So, hey, I guess the truth is somewhere in the middle.
83280	87440	You can be a strong independent woman who also buys Disney princess merch.
87440	91360	And today, we're going to be checking out some new toys in honor of Princess Jasmine.
91360	95040	It wasn't obvious at the time, but this was laying the groundwork for a much broader
95040	99920	trend of Disney acknowledging that times have changed from the era of princesses being saved
99920	104160	by princes, and it's cool that you want to go to law school, strong independent woman.
105040	107760	But please don't stop buying our stuff.
108960	111920	Audiences really liked this meta aspect of Enchanted,
111920	115040	and we saw similar elements in other films, like Frozen.
115040	117680	You got engaged to someone you just met that day?
117680	118720	Yeah, anyway.
118720	119280	Moana.
119280	123440	If you wear a dress and you have an animal sidekick, you're a princess.
123440	125760	And, more recently, Wreck-It Ralph.
125760	127440	Ralph Breaks the Internet.
127440	128400	Were you poisoned?
128400	128960	No.
128960	129600	Cursed?
129600	130080	No.
130080	131280	Kidnapped or enslaved?
131280	133520	No, are you guys okay? Should I call the police?
133520	137440	Soon, we entered the era of the live-action remake slash sequel slash spin-off,
137440	142240	beginning debatably with Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland, starring girl-interrupted Alice,
142320	147200	what-wears-armor, and a tortured tragic mad hatter, and whatever this is.
150880	153920	As far as this trend goes, Cinderella felt like a test run.
153920	158800	It had no real interest in reinventing the wheel so much, as much as it slides in on the whole
158800	163440	knowing the prince before the ball slash riding a horse equals empowerment shtick
163440	167120	that Ever After did better, because by this point that was old hat.
167120	170960	But on the flip side of the coin we have Maleficent, or as I like to call it,
170960	171680	my trash.
173680	175120	Well, well.
175120	177680	Maleficent is a remake, sort of,
177680	182080	which works as meta commentary by suggesting that the villain wasn't one-dimensional,
182080	183760	but had sympathetic motivations.
184800	186720	Very sympathetic motivations.
186720	191600	Motivations which I think that only Angelina Jolie knew what she was doing.
195760	196800	I mean, I get it, girl.
196800	201120	But really, the difference now, even from a movie as relatively recent as Maleficent,
201120	205360	is that these films are not so much using commentary as a means to examine their past
205360	207120	in the films that they are based on,
207120	210960	as much as they are using meta commentary to justify their own existence.
211760	215920	Teaching another girl to read isn't one enough.
215920	216420	Get it?
217120	219520	The original movie wasn't empowering.
220960	222000	But now it is.
222880	227040	The tendency to self-correct the outdated or questionable morality of the source material
227040	229120	is all over the place in these remakes.
229120	231520	Dumbo, in particular, is ripe with it.
233680	234640	Look at the sign!
235360	235840	Dumbo!
236720	241600	See, in the original film, Dumbo accidentally gets lit on some champagne and hallucinates.
244800	245280	But here...
245280	246960	Champagne for Dumbo!
247520	251680	No, we couldn't allow underaged elephants to drink.
251680	253440	What would the children think?
257440	260560	And we're the original Dumbo reunited with his mother at the end of the movie,
260560	264000	who seems to be enjoying retirement on her own train car.
264000	266960	The remake has them return to the jungle,
266960	270640	and Danny DeVito gets an epilogue where he explains to the viewer that the circus is
270640	271920	now cruelty free.
271920	273200	And the movie is not.
273200	277520	Dumbo gets an epilogue where he explains to the viewer that the circus is now cruelty free.
277520	281840	We believe no wild animals shall be held in captivity.
281840	285280	So the remake has this forced Aesop that animal cruelty is bad.
285840	288240	You know, which is not a bad thing in and of itself.
288240	291440	It is bad, and I'm glad animals in circuses have been phased out,
291440	294240	but the Dumbo happens in the late 1910s,
294240	299200	and that this is how the film ends feels a little disingenuous.
303200	306880	Like, audiences know it was a different time.
306880	311120	I don't think anyone wanted or expected a Dumbo remake to have a message about how it's
311120	313520	probably kind of unethical to have circus animals.
314640	316880	Here I make a funny here ugly baby.
316880	320880	So instead of addressing actual criticisms that people have had of Dumbo,
320880	321840	and we'll get to that,
321840	324880	it seems that the film is presenting itself as thoughtful by
325600	329920	fixing a moral outrage that, well, no one but PETA really had.
330480	333040	So some of this strategy is built either around
333040	337520	blatantly ignoring said dated material and cutesily joking it away,
337520	340240	but in the interest of pretending that Disney is at least
340240	344400	somewhat more hip to the criticism that it faces as a powerful conglomerate,
344400	348720	it has latched onto addressing other critiques with that thing that the kids like nowadays,
349360	350240	the wokeness.
352960	354640	How do you do, fellow kids?
354640	355140	What?
355520	358160	Because these movies need a reason to exist, right?
358880	360720	So it's that thing you like already.
361600	362640	But woke.
362640	364960	I've done a whole 35 minute video on this topic,
364960	369920	so I will be brief in my beating of this very dead horse and very girl boss horse.
369920	373840	But the 2017 Beauty and the Beast remake is what I see as the turning point
373840	377360	from meta commentary as a fun way of reexamining Disney canon
377360	381600	to woke meta commentary as justifying the film's existing at all.
381600	384560	Yes, the poor thing is probably in there scared to death.
384560	385280	Exactly.
385280	391360	This is where the movies stop trying to expand and instead want to be more like,
391360	395520	yeah, we've read the YMMV slash head scratchers page on TV Tropes,
395520	398080	so let's nitpick our own movies.
398080	398880	What's your name?
399520	400880	That is a hairbrush.
400880	402800	She doesn't have Stockholm syndrome.
402800	405280	She's- she- she basically says so.
405920	409120	You've taken me as your prisoner and now you want to have dinner with me?
409120	412000	The Beast negs her and she rolls her eyes at him.
412000	414080	Actually, Romeo and Juliet's my favorite play.
415840	417840	Why is that not a surprise?
417840	419040	She tries to escape.
419760	421760	See, what a girl boss.
421760	424000	She's an inventor who reads.
424720	425680	Girl boss.
425680	430160	Their utter lack of chemistry is, I don't know, feminist somehow.
432560	436480	And as much as the 1991 Beauty and the Beast was a success for the studio,
436480	440560	it also became an easy target for bad faith or lazy criticisms.
440560	443760	It feels like an exercise of self-flagellation,
443760	445840	but one that the audience is in on.
445840	449280	Since Disney Studios' brand is so tied up in the idea of princesses,
449280	452640	it's been constantly re-evaluating its relationship to the concept.
452640	455360	We definitely saw some evolution in the 90s.
455360	458000	Then maybe I don't want to be a princess anymore.
458000	459600	But in the wake of Lean In,
459600	464640	it's like we can't have a female character without really overt text about how empowered she is.
469280	471440	In Dumbo, there is a girl child.
471520	473920	Colin Farrell's daughter who wants to be a scientist.
478720	481440	Not a circus performer like her father once.
481440	482640	Which, fine.
485280	488240	Except it plays into the plot not at all.
488240	494160	She doesn't discover anything about Dumbo or figure out the aerodynamics of elephants flying.
494160	498640	It serves no other purpose other than to show that she's not like other girls,
498640	502000	what with their frippery and need for attention.
504240	507680	This girl is like two lines away from pulling a Neil deGrasse Tyson
507680	511440	and asking her dad if he knows how many people die in elephant-related accidents
511440	512960	compared to the Spanish flu.
512960	515440	And in The Lion King, not only is Nala's part expanded,
515440	517280	but Shenzi is a girl boss now.
517280	518160	You know, but sinister.
528800	533520	Which means they listened to the feminist critique of the original or something.
533520	536480	It wasn't a critique that any actual human person had.
537440	543120	But okay, let's pretend there was this big groundswell of mad feminists who were like,
543120	545600	yeah, Shenzi should have been a girl boss.
545600	547440	And Disney was like, yeah, we hear you.
548080	550720	There's only one true thing you ever set, Scar.
551600	554960	The hyena's belly is never full.
554960	559200	So they added that, but changed nothing else,
559200	563120	nor does the film change any of the elements that people actually did take issue with,
563120	565040	so thanks?
565040	568720	Aladdin likewise features new empowered girl boss Jasmine.
568720	572080	I was born to do more than marry some useless prince.
572080	574960	Jasmine in this version doesn't only want to marry for love,
574960	578160	which to her seems kind of a secondary concern, if that.
578160	579760	She wants to be the Sultan.
579760	583200	I have been preparing for this my whole life.
583200	586320	She quite literally aspires to be a girl boss.
587760	591920	You shall be the next Sultan.
591920	593360	See, the monarchy isn't bad.
593360	594320	It's progressive.
594320	596400	It just needs a female CEO.
596400	600880	Also, Jasmine, one of the most iconic, dynamic, and beloved princesses,
600880	606080	gets her own power ballad about how she's not speechless and you're gonna listen to her.
606320	610800	It won't be silence.
610800	614160	Even though that was never an issue for that character in the original.
614160	619120	How dare you, all of you, standing around deciding my future?
619680	621600	I am not a prize to be won.
621600	624320	And also isn't really an issue in this movie either.
624320	625920	She doesn't really self-censor.
625920	628480	She's not shy about her needs or stating them.
628480	632400	Also, there's something just kind of hilarious about a character power ballading to the gods
632400	635680	about being speechless and then immediately being taken prisoner.
635680	636800	And needing to be rescued.
641680	646000	So the goal here is to make princesses feel still relevant.
646000	651120	And they do that in the way that's effectively, you know, we need more female CEOs.
651120	652640	The people, they make it beautiful.
653360	655280	And they deserve a leader who knows that.
655280	659680	And with that in mind, I really can't wait to see how they're gonna woke-ify The Little Mermaid.
659680	662320	Like, it'll have Ariel really lean into that, like,
662320	665840	bright young women ready to stand line and have her want to be on land
665840	668960	because she found a shipwrecked copy of Girl, Wash Your Face.
668960	672320	And they're gonna go way out of their way to say it's not for a guy.
672320	673280	It's not for a guy.
674000	677680	He's just a, he's a fringe benefit.
677680	683920	So the metatextual inclusion of gender-related progress gets addressed by adding lean-in feminism
683920	685920	and making everyone a girl boss.
685920	691920	But how do these new live-action movies address critique of race in older Disney films?
691920	693520	That's certainly a hot topic.
694240	698480	Well, here is a Washington Post article that asked that very question about Dumbo.
698480	699840	How do they deal with it?
700960	701600	They don't.
701600	705600	Despite being more than happy to address gender-related criticisms in the metatext
705600	710480	by just adding a coat of girl boss paint, race-related issues go completely ignored.
710480	714480	Take, for instance, The Lion King, a story about how divine right birthright monarchy
714480	717280	is not only good but divine by nature,
717280	720800	and also about how segregation is probably best for everybody.
720800	722800	Now, these themes are there in the original,
722800	727440	but given that the original elevates itself into this magical emotional realm,
727440	729760	it just reads differently than the remake,
729760	733200	which is run through this hyper-realism sterilization filter.
733200	737120	So while Lion King 2019 does a little bit of the girl boss thing,
737120	741280	it also kind of doubles down on the whole race mixing is bad thing.
741280	745840	It can't just be this obscure nature is mad at the disruption of the natural order
745840	747040	as it was in the original.
747040	751840	The text has to explain why the hyenas are bad for the Pride Lands.
751840	755360	It has to justify why they are naturally worse than lions.
756000	762560	The lions will eat after the hyenas, and they don't leave much behind.
762560	766960	But to me, the sidestepping of race issues is nowhere more evident than in Dumbo.
766960	770240	The original Dumbo was kind of beautiful in how flawed it was,
770240	773600	including the elements that are abrasive to modern sensibilities.
777760	780640	Which happened, and are a part of Disney history,
780640	784080	and we're not doing ourselves any favors by pretending that they did not.
784080	787440	Take, for instance, the scene of baby Dumbo accidentally getting lit,
787440	789280	which, yes, we need to lampshade.
797520	799040	Now, the pink elephant sequence,
799040	801280	which is one of the best sequences from early Disney
801280	805920	because it's just so unapologetic and creepy and, you know, good,
805920	807440	does get referenced in the remake.
808320	810320	Um, okay.
812960	814000	Pink elephants.
814640	815140	So?
815920	816480	Sure.
816480	820400	Dumbo is also arguably the most, let's be charitable and call it,
820400	822960	racially insensitive of the feature canon.
822960	826800	The song of the roustabout shows these guys pitching a circus tent
826800	828160	and has lyrics like this.
828160	837040	So, that's completely ignored in the remake.
837040	839600	More infamous, and perhaps the most glaring in omission,
839600	842000	are the crows Dumbo befriends towards the end of the film.
846000	848560	The crows employ some pretty egregious stereotyping,
848560	850640	singing a song written by white songwriters.
850720	861120	The crows voiced largely, if not entirely, by white actors,
861120	864720	featuring a lead crow named by the animation department Jim Crow.
868480	871520	And it took us a while to figure out whether this was apocryphal or not,
871520	875280	because Dumbo is, like, the least chronicled of all of the Disney movies
875280	877200	and there basically are no production notes
877200	879280	and what few there are don't actually mention it,
879280	880480	but turns out, yep, yep.
881200	881920	That was a thing.
881920	885440	And I know there is discourse on how to handle history like this,
885440	887840	but pretending that it just didn't exist,
887840	890400	just ignoring it all together and pretending it didn't happen,
890400	893760	how is that helping make the world better or educate people?
900880	905520	The crows are a part of the DNA of Dumbo just as much as baby mine or pink elephants,
905520	909200	but unlike those two, which are ham-fistedly jammed into the remake,
909840	911280	the crows don't even get mentioned.
911280	913040	The song isn't there, save a few words,
913040	916480	which strikes me as noteworthy since the song itself is pretty tame.
929840	932800	But the crows aren't referenced, and even Dumbo's feather,
932800	935360	which was gifted to him by the crows in the original,
935360	944400	has somehow also managed to turn white.
944400	948720	It's like there was never racism here in this universe and there never will be.
948720	951760	We just kind of live in this nice multi-cultiverse where
951760	955760	other forms of bigotry exist and are not the ones we live with in the real world,
955760	956560	but, you know,
960800	963280	we have our cutesy analogs sometimes.
966320	969600	If the films acknowledge racism at all, it's never systemic,
969600	973600	but the product of a few bad apples, i.e. the princess and the frog.
973600	978560	Which is why a little woman of your background would have had her hands full.
978560	980400	And not the system itself.
980400	982960	Systemic racism doesn't exist in the metaverse.
982960	985280	If it does, again princess and the frog,
985280	989760	it can be handled with basically the ideological equivalent of a good guy with a gun.
990320	995280	John Goodman just needs to realize that the woman who makes his favorite beignets
995280	996320	needs more money.
999760	1000800	He's a nice guy.
1001920	1003520	There are good rich whites.
1004400	1008080	It seems like meaningfully addressing any of these societal problems in the
1008080	1012160	text of their films would mean that Disney would have to really acknowledge its own past.
1012800	1017200	Which, well, that's not really why these films have meta commentary now, is it?
1017200	1019280	They aren't woke to make the world better.
1019280	1020880	They're woke for you to buy stuff.
1025280	1039680	It's a whole new world.
1041280	1042400	To lean into.
1042960	1047120	See, there's no like girl wash your face lean in feminism that Disney can make marketable
1047120	1048800	where race is concerned.
1048800	1053040	So where they can overcorrect the princesses and make them more marketable by turning them
1053040	1057520	into girl bosses, ain't much they can do to correct critique of race in Disney movies
1057520	1061920	that's, you know, corporate approved, so they just ignore it.
1061920	1066240	But one of the more nefarious of these joking about the sons of the father aspects of these
1066240	1073600	remakes comes at the expense of the Walt Disney Company itself and its business model.
1073600	1075280	Dumbo really leans into this.
1075280	1079840	The plot of the original Dumbo comprises basically the first act of the 2019 remake,
1079840	1084800	and from there goes into what appears to be a winking meta-critique of Disney itself.
1084800	1086160	Join me in my family.
1086880	1089440	Let me take us all into the future.
1089440	1093760	Let me take us all to Dreamland.
1093760	1098160	With really obvious and heavy-handed references to Disneyland in its theme park,
1098160	1103600	owned by Michael Keaton's villain, Vandermeer, himself a weird mixture of P.T. Barnum, Walt Disney,
1103600	1109280	and Vanderbilt, there are blatant nods to actual attractions like the Astro Orbiter
1109280	1113520	and the Carousel of Progress and just park aesthetic in general.
1113520	1116560	There's a wonder of science attraction that, well...
1117280	1118960	Dad, wonders of science.
1119600	1121360	Don't worry, honey, it's bought by ExxonMobil.
1121360	1125120	Also within this is a weird half-assed critique of the overuse of the word
1125120	1128480	dream and the need to feel like a child again.
1128480	1130000	You've made me a child again.
1130000	1133520	I'm still parsing out what the intention of this weird take on Disney's own past
1133520	1136880	and corporate culture is meant to say, besides a weird
1136880	1140880	Well, you can't hate their corporate monopoly if they make fun of themselves.
1140880	1142480	Self-awareness is relatable.
1147600	1151680	It feels like commentary, but it's commentary that does not say anything.
1151680	1154240	Vandermeer's park looks like Disneyland,
1154240	1157920	but beyond that it seems to be an indictment of P.T. Barnum more than anything,
1157920	1161600	especially since the film ends with Dumbo going back to the jungle
1161600	1164960	and Woke Circus getting rid of all their animal acts.
1164960	1168880	Mary Poppins Returns also has a curious relationship to wealth and power.
1168880	1171280	Jane has grown up to be a union organizer.
1171280	1176000	No, it's the Society for the Protection of the Rights of the Underpaid Citizens of England.
1176000	1178000	A labor organizer.
1178000	1181520	Which, considering Walt's relationship to unions itself, is kind of hilarious.
1181520	1183920	But she is mostly portrayed as kind of a ditz,
1183920	1188160	and the ending relies on her asking the Lamplighters for unpaid labor,
1188160	1191520	not for the benefit of any kind of, you know, labor union,
1191600	1195520	but to help her save her house that she owns.
1195520	1198800	Jane's advocacy doesn't really do anything for organized labor.
1198800	1202400	If anything, it's just more, you know, just ripping off the original, you know.
1202400	1206400	Well, her mom was a suffragette, so Jane's a pinko, I guess.
1207040	1209520	But the main plot surrounds the banks,
1210080	1214480	and also the bank, which wants to repossess the bank's house.
1214480	1218080	In the original, the bank is portrayed as something of a neutral evil.
1218080	1220080	Heartless and bottom line obsessed.
1220080	1223680	Something that Mr. Banks overvalues at the expense of his family.
1223680	1228800	Meanwhile, in sequel land, the main villain is a rogue Colin Firth, the bad rich man.
1234320	1236640	The Banks family is on the cusp of losing their house,
1236640	1240480	because Michael is bad at money, and Jane is a communist.
1240480	1243280	A home they love so much they've tied their identity to it,
1243280	1246960	in much the same way that Mr. Banks did his job in the original.
1246960	1249360	Towards the end, it looks like they're going to lose their house,
1249360	1251840	unless they do the thing by the stroke of midnight.
1251840	1254320	But don't worry, the one bad man is removed,
1254320	1257760	they are able to keep their house because the bank itself is good and moral,
1257760	1259840	and is on the side of the middle class, and thus,
1263120	1265680	the bank's identity and happiness can continue to be tied
1265680	1267520	to their possession of material things.
1268080	1270000	And I find that interesting, because in the original,
1270000	1273760	Mr. Banks lets go of the thing that he had erroneously attached
1273760	1275840	his own value and sense of identity to.
1275840	1280960	But in the remake, don't worry, they never have to have that moment of self-reevaluation,
1280960	1284160	because they never lose the thing they were worried about losing,
1284160	1287280	because good capitalist is here to save the day.
1287840	1289280	And he's played by Dick Van Dyke.
1293840	1295280	Dick Van Dyke is over here like,
1295280	1298800	oh, the bank would never intentionally hurt their trusting customers.
1298880	1306880	A large business always has the best intentions.
1306880	1311040	Big corporations aren't bad, but the rare nefarious individual.
1311040	1312240	That is the bad one.
1312240	1315600	It is not the system that is bad, but a few bad apples.
1315600	1319600	If anything, the transition from old Disney to new Disney is a transition from
1319600	1322640	monarchy is good to capitalism is good.
1323280	1327360	There's always a good king or a good bank or a good businessman,
1327360	1330480	and these conclusions, while they pay lip service to progressive ideals,
1330480	1334320	ultimately conclude that nothing of the status quo need be challenged.
1334320	1337600	Not really, which feels pretty convenient when the company producing these things
1337600	1340320	own more and more of the media that we consume every day.
1340320	1342560	But now Disney will have full control of Hulu,
1343280	1347680	will control its customer management, its technology, its data sharing.
1347680	1352000	This is not to say that empowering women to be leaders or a family keeping their house
1352000	1357280	or cruelty-free circuses are a bad thing, but if that's all you got, then that's not progress.
1357280	1358240	That's just marketing.
1358960	1364480	These movies are redundant, with a couple of exceptions, weird outliers like Maleficent,
1364480	1366880	and I guess you could make a case for The Jungle Book.
1366880	1370000	But for the most part, these movies don't need to exist,
1370000	1374800	so they give themselves a metatextual reason to exist in the text.
1374800	1376800	It's that thing you like, but woke.
1377360	1381760	For The Lion King, it's take the majestic thing and run it through this hyper-sterilized
1381760	1382800	realism filter.
1382800	1386640	For Beauty and the Beast, it's sending this love story about personal growth
1386640	1389520	and forgiveness through the Beast for She filter.
1389520	1393360	And for Aladdin, it's sending Princess Jasmine through the Girlboss filter.
1393360	1397920	And for Dumbo, it's take the problematic thing and de-problematizing it to the point
1397920	1401920	where it's unrecognizable and Dumbo isn't even the main character anymore.
1403040	1404960	Wow, this is a disaster.
1405600	1410320	Like, okay, so you've taken a property from the 1940s and you have identified that it
1410320	1416000	has certain insensitivities relating to race and animal cruelty.
1416000	1418080	You have declared the thing problematic.
1419280	1420720	Yeah, great, good for you.
1420720	1421920	In the words of Alan Arkin,
1422640	1423360	So?
1423360	1427360	And that's one of the more frustrating things about this era of pop criticism,
1427360	1429760	where we look back on media history and be like,
1429760	1434880	thing bad, and people can look on history with this smugness of hindsight and say,
1434880	1436640	you know that thing you liked as a kid?
1437280	1440160	Well, it was, it had problems.
1441200	1442320	It was problematic.
1443200	1444960	Did I blow your mind yet?
1446000	1447360	And it's like, okay.
1448480	1449120	So?
1449120	1451840	You've taken step one, you've identified the problem.
1451840	1453600	What do you want to do with that?
1453600	1458000	Are you that guy in that Onion article that always likes to bring up that John Lennon
1458000	1459280	beat his wife?
1459280	1462720	Do you want to drag the company that made the thing through the street?
1462720	1467200	Do you want to wave it off and say it was a product of its time, so who cares?
1467200	1472000	Or do you want to do what Disney is doing with its remakes and just erase the history
1472000	1475440	and just ignore the stuff that aged poorly and just pretend it never happened?
1476400	1478480	Wow, this is a disaster.
1478480	1483280	Because a part of media literacy is taking film history, understanding its context,
1483280	1486480	exploring different viewpoints on the media and the history in question,
1486480	1489920	and accepting it for what it was, not pretending it didn't happen.
1490640	1494000	There are some power structures that Disney movies are never going to challenge.
1494000	1497840	The original entries in the Disney film canon were never about challenge or change,
1497840	1501200	and so it goes with their remakes and their reboots and their sequels.
1501200	1505040	It's not the system that's bad, it's that women aren't allowed to be CEOs.
1505040	1507840	Let Jasmine be a girl boss, Sultan.
1507840	1510240	It's not that class stratification is bad,
1510240	1514080	it's just Belle totally sticking it to those narrow-minded poor townies
1514080	1516720	by owning a VC-funded washing machine startup.
1516720	1519120	Only Maleficent, hot mess though it is,
1519120	1522640	kind of feels a little transgressive and an outlier in this trend
1522640	1525280	because it's actually centered on women and their pain,
1525280	1527520	and actually challenges the foundation of the original
1527520	1529760	in a way that you don't see in any of these other movies.
1529760	1533040	And Maleficent's girl boss angle doesn't feel so hollow
1533040	1535040	since it ends with the ladies in power,
1535040	1540080	and we actually develop the originally very underdeveloped lead of Aurora
1540080	1542800	in lieu of trying to correct anything in the original.
1542800	1545600	It must needs be remarked that one of the big issues here,
1545600	1548960	especially once Disney started dipping into the waters of making animated films
1548960	1551280	with non-European settings or characters of color,
1551280	1554800	is that people of color or from the backgrounds of the people being depicted
1554800	1557120	were rarely involved in the behind-the-scenes work.
1557120	1560000	With the live-action films, there could have been space to correct this,
1560000	1564960	but Guy Ritchie is directing Aladdin, I guess.
1566160	1568240	Was all of Bollywood busy?
1569280	1569760	All of it?
1575200	1579680	Again, games made but ultimately still minute compared to the sheer volume of content
1579680	1582720	that Disney puts out, especially in the live-action department
1582720	1587120	that is presently doing pretty, pretty well.
1587440	1591440	Why the company wants to show that they recognize their problematic past with gender
1591440	1594400	but totally ignores its problematic history with race
1594400	1598480	is because it's really easy to make lean-in feminism profitable.
1598480	1601360	After all, Disney princesses are girl bosses now.
1601920	1606640	Do people assume all your problems got solved because a big strong man showed up?
1606640	1608720	Yes! What is up with that?
1608720	1610800	Just like you will be one day.
1613120	1616160	And this is why I find Disney wokeness highly cynical.
1616960	1620560	They're more than happy to show how they've changed in some regards,
1620560	1622240	but only the profitable ones.
1622240	1625840	They have better race representation now, which is good,
1625840	1630080	but they aren't about to admit that there was ever, ever anything the company has to move beyond.
1630640	1633840	Song of the South? That didn't happen. That's never getting a release.
1633840	1636560	These parts of Dumbo? That didn't happen.
1636560	1640480	What Makes the Red Man Red? We Are Siamese? Didn't happen.
1640480	1643200	There's no like corporate-approved profitable way to make any
1643200	1646720	metatextual examination of Disney's history with race representation,
1647280	1651200	or lack thereof, profitable. So they don't.
1651840	1654640	The insidious thing to me is that with Disney positioning itself
1654640	1657040	to be the biggest media monopoly in history,
1657040	1662160	the trend is less about meta-commentary but priming people to be loyal to the company.
1662720	1665840	After all, the company sees and hears your criticisms.
1665840	1668080	It agrees with your ideals about inclusivity.
1668080	1671680	So don't worry about the fact that they're well on their way to owning everything.
1672000	1674560	They're here to support you being a girl boss.
1675600	1678320	Do you have daddy issues? I don't even have a mom!
1678320	1679760	Neither do we!
1679760	1683440	And speaking of being a boss, babe, we need to pay the bills.
1684320	1685920	Because we live in a society.
1685920	1687520	So this episode was sponsored by Audible,
1687520	1691360	and originally this episode was going to have way more to do with Disney in the 90s,
1691360	1696320	but then it didn't. But I'm going to recommend Disney War on Audible to you anyway,
1696320	1700320	if you want to read about the supervillain rise and fall of Michael Eisner.
