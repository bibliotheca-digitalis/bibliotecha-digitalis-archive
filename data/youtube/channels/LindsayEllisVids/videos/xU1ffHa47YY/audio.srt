1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,520
Let's get ready for DUMBOOOOOOO!

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Twice. They do it twice.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,480
Let's get ready for DUMBOOOOO!

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,120
In the last couple of decades, there's been this trend of

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,960
family films being self-aware and trope-savvy, as if to say,

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,840
yes, parents in the room, we know that you have to endure this, but we also know

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,800
that you are, in fact, smarter than your five-year-old.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,760
You did it.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,200
And while this has been present in Disney films since, debatably, Aladdin,

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,680
this kind of meta-commentary has slowly been shifting from the occasional throwaway gag

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,560
It's a small world after all

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,280
No! No! Anything but that.

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,160
to full-on important thematic statement.

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,800
Enchanted is the real milestone here, and also represented a turning point for the studio in general,

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,800
the entire premise of the film positing what would actually happen if a Disney princess

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,480
were magically transported into the real world.

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,360
She's yours!

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,760
Don't see. It's okay, you know? Let's just walk.

19
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,840
See, Patrick Dempsey's trying to get his daughter into, like, Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,600
A book?

21
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,920
He wants her to be a strong independent woman.

22
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,160
But then, hey, a literal Disney princess brings magic into their lives.

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,280
So, hey, I guess the truth is somewhere in the middle.

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,440
You can be a strong independent woman who also buys Disney princess merch.

25
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,360
And today, we're going to be checking out some new toys in honor of Princess Jasmine.

26
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,040
It wasn't obvious at the time, but this was laying the groundwork for a much broader

27
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,920
trend of Disney acknowledging that times have changed from the era of princesses being saved

28
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,160
by princes, and it's cool that you want to go to law school, strong independent woman.

29
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,760
But please don't stop buying our stuff.

30
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,920
Audiences really liked this meta aspect of Enchanted,

31
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,040
and we saw similar elements in other films, like Frozen.

32
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,680
You got engaged to someone you just met that day?

33
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,720
Yeah, anyway.

34
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,280
Moana.

35
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,440
If you wear a dress and you have an animal sidekick, you're a princess.

36
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,760
And, more recently, Wreck-It Ralph.

37
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,440
Ralph Breaks the Internet.

38
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,400
Were you poisoned?

39
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:08,960
No.

40
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,600
Cursed?

41
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,080
No.

42
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,280
Kidnapped or enslaved?

43
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,520
No, are you guys okay? Should I call the police?

44
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,440
Soon, we entered the era of the live-action remake slash sequel slash spin-off,

45
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,240
beginning debatably with Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland, starring girl-interrupted Alice,

46
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,200
what-wears-armor, and a tortured tragic mad hatter, and whatever this is.

47
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,920
As far as this trend goes, Cinderella felt like a test run.

48
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,800
It had no real interest in reinventing the wheel so much, as much as it slides in on the whole

49
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,440
knowing the prince before the ball slash riding a horse equals empowerment shtick

50
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,120
that Ever After did better, because by this point that was old hat.

51
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,960
But on the flip side of the coin we have Maleficent, or as I like to call it,

52
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,680
my trash.

53
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,120
Well, well.

54
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,680
Maleficent is a remake, sort of,

55
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,080
which works as meta commentary by suggesting that the villain wasn't one-dimensional,

56
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,760
but had sympathetic motivations.

57
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,720
Very sympathetic motivations.

58
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,600
Motivations which I think that only Angelina Jolie knew what she was doing.

59
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,800
I mean, I get it, girl.

60
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,120
But really, the difference now, even from a movie as relatively recent as Maleficent,

61
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,360
is that these films are not so much using commentary as a means to examine their past

62
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,120
in the films that they are based on,

63
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,960
as much as they are using meta commentary to justify their own existence.

64
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,920
Teaching another girl to read isn't one enough.

65
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,420
Get it?

66
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,520
The original movie wasn't empowering.

67
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,000
But now it is.

68
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,040
The tendency to self-correct the outdated or questionable morality of the source material

69
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,120
is all over the place in these remakes.

70
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,520
Dumbo, in particular, is ripe with it.

71
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,640
Look at the sign!

72
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,840
Dumbo!

73
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,600
See, in the original film, Dumbo accidentally gets lit on some champagne and hallucinates.

74
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,280
But here...

75
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,960
Champagne for Dumbo!

76
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,680
No, we couldn't allow underaged elephants to drink.

77
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,440
What would the children think?

78
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,560
And we're the original Dumbo reunited with his mother at the end of the movie,

79
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,000
who seems to be enjoying retirement on her own train car.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,960
The remake has them return to the jungle,

81
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,640
and Danny DeVito gets an epilogue where he explains to the viewer that the circus is

82
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,920
now cruelty free.

83
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,200
And the movie is not.

84
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,520
Dumbo gets an epilogue where he explains to the viewer that the circus is now cruelty free.

85
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,840
We believe no wild animals shall be held in captivity.

86
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,280
So the remake has this forced Aesop that animal cruelty is bad.

87
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,240
You know, which is not a bad thing in and of itself.

88
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,440
It is bad, and I'm glad animals in circuses have been phased out,

89
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,240
but the Dumbo happens in the late 1910s,

90
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,200
and that this is how the film ends feels a little disingenuous.

91
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,880
Like, audiences know it was a different time.

92
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,120
I don't think anyone wanted or expected a Dumbo remake to have a message about how it's

93
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,520
probably kind of unethical to have circus animals.

94
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,880
Here I make a funny here ugly baby.

95
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,880
So instead of addressing actual criticisms that people have had of Dumbo,

96
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,840
and we'll get to that,

97
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,880
it seems that the film is presenting itself as thoughtful by

98
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,920
fixing a moral outrage that, well, no one but PETA really had.

99
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,040
So some of this strategy is built either around

100
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,520
blatantly ignoring said dated material and cutesily joking it away,

101
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,240
but in the interest of pretending that Disney is at least

102
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,400
somewhat more hip to the criticism that it faces as a powerful conglomerate,

103
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,720
it has latched onto addressing other critiques with that thing that the kids like nowadays,

104
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,240
the wokeness.

105
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,640
How do you do, fellow kids?

106
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,140
What?

107
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,160
Because these movies need a reason to exist, right?

108
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,720
So it's that thing you like already.

109
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,640
But woke.

110
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,960
I've done a whole 35 minute video on this topic,

111
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,920
so I will be brief in my beating of this very dead horse and very girl boss horse.

112
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,840
But the 2017 Beauty and the Beast remake is what I see as the turning point

113
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,360
from meta commentary as a fun way of reexamining Disney canon

114
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,600
to woke meta commentary as justifying the film's existing at all.

115
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,560
Yes, the poor thing is probably in there scared to death.

116
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,280
Exactly.

117
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,360
This is where the movies stop trying to expand and instead want to be more like,

118
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,520
yeah, we've read the YMMV slash head scratchers page on TV Tropes,

119
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,080
so let's nitpick our own movies.

120
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,880
What's your name?

121
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,880
That is a hairbrush.

122
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,800
She doesn't have Stockholm syndrome.

123
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,280
She's- she- she basically says so.

124
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,120
You've taken me as your prisoner and now you want to have dinner with me?

125
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,000
The Beast negs her and she rolls her eyes at him.

126
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,080
Actually, Romeo and Juliet's my favorite play.

127
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,840
Why is that not a surprise?

128
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,040
She tries to escape.

129
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,760
See, what a girl boss.

130
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,000
She's an inventor who reads.

131
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,680
Girl boss.

132
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,160
Their utter lack of chemistry is, I don't know, feminist somehow.

133
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,480
And as much as the 1991 Beauty and the Beast was a success for the studio,

134
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,560
it also became an easy target for bad faith or lazy criticisms.

135
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,760
It feels like an exercise of self-flagellation,

136
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,840
but one that the audience is in on.

137
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,280
Since Disney Studios' brand is so tied up in the idea of princesses,

138
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,640
it's been constantly re-evaluating its relationship to the concept.

139
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,360
We definitely saw some evolution in the 90s.

140
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,000
Then maybe I don't want to be a princess anymore.

141
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,600
But in the wake of Lean In,

142
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,640
it's like we can't have a female character without really overt text about how empowered she is.

143
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,440
In Dumbo, there is a girl child.

144
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,920
Colin Farrell's daughter who wants to be a scientist.

145
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,440
Not a circus performer like her father once.

146
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,640
Which, fine.

147
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,240
Except it plays into the plot not at all.

148
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,160
She doesn't discover anything about Dumbo or figure out the aerodynamics of elephants flying.

149
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,640
It serves no other purpose other than to show that she's not like other girls,

150
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,000
what with their frippery and need for attention.

151
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,680
This girl is like two lines away from pulling a Neil deGrasse Tyson

152
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,440
and asking her dad if he knows how many people die in elephant-related accidents

153
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,960
compared to the Spanish flu.

154
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,440
And in The Lion King, not only is Nala's part expanded,

155
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,280
but Shenzi is a girl boss now.

156
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,160
You know, but sinister.

157
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,520
Which means they listened to the feminist critique of the original or something.

158
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,480
It wasn't a critique that any actual human person had.

159
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,120
But okay, let's pretend there was this big groundswell of mad feminists who were like,

160
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,600
yeah, Shenzi should have been a girl boss.

161
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,440
And Disney was like, yeah, we hear you.

162
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,720
There's only one true thing you ever set, Scar.

163
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,960
The hyena's belly is never full.

164
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,200
So they added that, but changed nothing else,

165
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,120
nor does the film change any of the elements that people actually did take issue with,

166
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,040
so thanks?

167
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,720
Aladdin likewise features new empowered girl boss Jasmine.

168
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,080
I was born to do more than marry some useless prince.

169
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,960
Jasmine in this version doesn't only want to marry for love,

170
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,160
which to her seems kind of a secondary concern, if that.

171
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,760
She wants to be the Sultan.

172
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,200
I have been preparing for this my whole life.

173
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,320
She quite literally aspires to be a girl boss.

174
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,920
You shall be the next Sultan.

175
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,360
See, the monarchy isn't bad.

176
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,320
It's progressive.

177
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,400
It just needs a female CEO.

178
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,880
Also, Jasmine, one of the most iconic, dynamic, and beloved princesses,

179
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,080
gets her own power ballad about how she's not speechless and you're gonna listen to her.

180
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,800
It won't be silence.

181
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,160
Even though that was never an issue for that character in the original.

182
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,120
How dare you, all of you, standing around deciding my future?

183
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,600
I am not a prize to be won.

184
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,320
And also isn't really an issue in this movie either.

185
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,920
She doesn't really self-censor.

186
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,480
She's not shy about her needs or stating them.

187
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,400
Also, there's something just kind of hilarious about a character power ballading to the gods

188
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,680
about being speechless and then immediately being taken prisoner.

189
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,800
And needing to be rescued.

190
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,000
So the goal here is to make princesses feel still relevant.

191
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,120
And they do that in the way that's effectively, you know, we need more female CEOs.

192
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,640
The people, they make it beautiful.

193
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,280
And they deserve a leader who knows that.

194
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,680
And with that in mind, I really can't wait to see how they're gonna woke-ify The Little Mermaid.

195
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,320
Like, it'll have Ariel really lean into that, like,

196
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,840
bright young women ready to stand line and have her want to be on land

197
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,960
because she found a shipwrecked copy of Girl, Wash Your Face.

198
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,320
And they're gonna go way out of their way to say it's not for a guy.

199
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,280
It's not for a guy.

200
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,680
He's just a, he's a fringe benefit.

201
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,920
So the metatextual inclusion of gender-related progress gets addressed by adding lean-in feminism

202
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,920
and making everyone a girl boss.

203
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,920
But how do these new live-action movies address critique of race in older Disney films?

204
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,520
That's certainly a hot topic.

205
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,480
Well, here is a Washington Post article that asked that very question about Dumbo.

206
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,840
How do they deal with it?

207
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,600
They don't.

208
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,600
Despite being more than happy to address gender-related criticisms in the metatext

209
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,480
by just adding a coat of girl boss paint, race-related issues go completely ignored.

210
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,480
Take, for instance, The Lion King, a story about how divine right birthright monarchy

211
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,280
is not only good but divine by nature,

212
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,800
and also about how segregation is probably best for everybody.

213
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
Now, these themes are there in the original,

214
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,440
but given that the original elevates itself into this magical emotional realm,

215
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,760
it just reads differently than the remake,

216
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,200
which is run through this hyper-realism sterilization filter.

217
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,120
So while Lion King 2019 does a little bit of the girl boss thing,

218
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,280
it also kind of doubles down on the whole race mixing is bad thing.

219
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,840
It can't just be this obscure nature is mad at the disruption of the natural order

220
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,040
as it was in the original.

221
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,840
The text has to explain why the hyenas are bad for the Pride Lands.

222
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,360
It has to justify why they are naturally worse than lions.

223
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,560
The lions will eat after the hyenas, and they don't leave much behind.

224
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,960
But to me, the sidestepping of race issues is nowhere more evident than in Dumbo.

225
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,240
The original Dumbo was kind of beautiful in how flawed it was,

226
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,600
including the elements that are abrasive to modern sensibilities.

227
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,640
Which happened, and are a part of Disney history,

228
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,080
and we're not doing ourselves any favors by pretending that they did not.

229
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,440
Take, for instance, the scene of baby Dumbo accidentally getting lit,

230
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,280
which, yes, we need to lampshade.

231
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,040
Now, the pink elephant sequence,

232
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,280
which is one of the best sequences from early Disney

233
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,920
because it's just so unapologetic and creepy and, you know, good,

234
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,440
does get referenced in the remake.

235
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
Um, okay.

236
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,000
Pink elephants.

237
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,140
So?

238
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,480
Sure.

239
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,400
Dumbo is also arguably the most, let's be charitable and call it,

240
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,960
racially insensitive of the feature canon.

241
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,800
The song of the roustabout shows these guys pitching a circus tent

242
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,160
and has lyrics like this.

243
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:57,040
So, that's completely ignored in the remake.

244
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,600
More infamous, and perhaps the most glaring in omission,

245
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,000
are the crows Dumbo befriends towards the end of the film.

246
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,560
The crows employ some pretty egregious stereotyping,

247
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,640
singing a song written by white songwriters.

248
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:21,120
The crows voiced largely, if not entirely, by white actors,

249
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,720
featuring a lead crow named by the animation department Jim Crow.

250
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,520
And it took us a while to figure out whether this was apocryphal or not,

251
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,280
because Dumbo is, like, the least chronicled of all of the Disney movies

252
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,200
and there basically are no production notes

253
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,280
and what few there are don't actually mention it,

254
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,480
but turns out, yep, yep.

255
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,920
That was a thing.

256
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,440
And I know there is discourse on how to handle history like this,

257
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,840
but pretending that it just didn't exist,

258
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,400
just ignoring it all together and pretending it didn't happen,

259
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,760
how is that helping make the world better or educate people?

260
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,520
The crows are a part of the DNA of Dumbo just as much as baby mine or pink elephants,

261
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,200
but unlike those two, which are ham-fistedly jammed into the remake,

262
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,280
the crows don't even get mentioned.

263
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,040
The song isn't there, save a few words,

264
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,480
which strikes me as noteworthy since the song itself is pretty tame.

265
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,800
But the crows aren't referenced, and even Dumbo's feather,

266
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,360
which was gifted to him by the crows in the original,

267
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:44,400
has somehow also managed to turn white.

268
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,720
It's like there was never racism here in this universe and there never will be.

269
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,760
We just kind of live in this nice multi-cultiverse where

270
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,760
other forms of bigotry exist and are not the ones we live with in the real world,

271
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,560
but, you know,

272
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,280
we have our cutesy analogs sometimes.

273
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,600
If the films acknowledge racism at all, it's never systemic,

274
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,600
but the product of a few bad apples, i.e. the princess and the frog.

275
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,560
Which is why a little woman of your background would have had her hands full.

276
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,400
And not the system itself.

277
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,960
Systemic racism doesn't exist in the metaverse.

278
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,280
If it does, again princess and the frog,

279
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,760
it can be handled with basically the ideological equivalent of a good guy with a gun.

280
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,280
John Goodman just needs to realize that the woman who makes his favorite beignets

281
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,320
needs more money.

282
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,800
He's a nice guy.

283
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,520
There are good rich whites.

284
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,080
It seems like meaningfully addressing any of these societal problems in the

285
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,160
text of their films would mean that Disney would have to really acknowledge its own past.

286
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,200
Which, well, that's not really why these films have meta commentary now, is it?

287
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,280
They aren't woke to make the world better.

288
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,880
They're woke for you to buy stuff.

289
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:19,680
It's a whole new world.

290
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,400
To lean into.

291
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,120
See, there's no like girl wash your face lean in feminism that Disney can make marketable

292
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,800
where race is concerned.

293
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,040
So where they can overcorrect the princesses and make them more marketable by turning them

294
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,520
into girl bosses, ain't much they can do to correct critique of race in Disney movies

295
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,920
that's, you know, corporate approved, so they just ignore it.

296
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,240
But one of the more nefarious of these joking about the sons of the father aspects of these

297
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:53,600
remakes comes at the expense of the Walt Disney Company itself and its business model.

298
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,280
Dumbo really leans into this.

299
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,840
The plot of the original Dumbo comprises basically the first act of the 2019 remake,

300
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,800
and from there goes into what appears to be a winking meta-critique of Disney itself.

301
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,160
Join me in my family.

302
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,440
Let me take us all into the future.

303
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,760
Let me take us all to Dreamland.

304
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,160
With really obvious and heavy-handed references to Disneyland in its theme park,

305
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,600
owned by Michael Keaton's villain, Vandermeer, himself a weird mixture of P.T. Barnum, Walt Disney,

306
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,280
and Vanderbilt, there are blatant nods to actual attractions like the Astro Orbiter

307
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,520
and the Carousel of Progress and just park aesthetic in general.

308
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,560
There's a wonder of science attraction that, well...

309
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,960
Dad, wonders of science.

310
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,360
Don't worry, honey, it's bought by ExxonMobil.

311
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,120
Also within this is a weird half-assed critique of the overuse of the word

312
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,480
dream and the need to feel like a child again.

313
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,000
You've made me a child again.

314
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,520
I'm still parsing out what the intention of this weird take on Disney's own past

315
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,880
and corporate culture is meant to say, besides a weird

316
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,880
Well, you can't hate their corporate monopoly if they make fun of themselves.

317
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,480
Self-awareness is relatable.

318
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,680
It feels like commentary, but it's commentary that does not say anything.

319
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,240
Vandermeer's park looks like Disneyland,

320
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,920
but beyond that it seems to be an indictment of P.T. Barnum more than anything,

321
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,600
especially since the film ends with Dumbo going back to the jungle

322
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,960
and Woke Circus getting rid of all their animal acts.

323
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,880
Mary Poppins Returns also has a curious relationship to wealth and power.

324
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,280
Jane has grown up to be a union organizer.

325
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,000
No, it's the Society for the Protection of the Rights of the Underpaid Citizens of England.

326
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
A labor organizer.

327
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,520
Which, considering Walt's relationship to unions itself, is kind of hilarious.

328
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,920
But she is mostly portrayed as kind of a ditz,

329
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:48,160
and the ending relies on her asking the Lamplighters for unpaid labor,

330
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,520
not for the benefit of any kind of, you know, labor union,

331
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,520
but to help her save her house that she owns.

332
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,800
Jane's advocacy doesn't really do anything for organized labor.

333
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,400
If anything, it's just more, you know, just ripping off the original, you know.

334
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,400
Well, her mom was a suffragette, so Jane's a pinko, I guess.

335
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,520
But the main plot surrounds the banks,

336
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,480
and also the bank, which wants to repossess the bank's house.

337
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,080
In the original, the bank is portrayed as something of a neutral evil.

338
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,080
Heartless and bottom line obsessed.

339
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,680
Something that Mr. Banks overvalues at the expense of his family.

340
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,800
Meanwhile, in sequel land, the main villain is a rogue Colin Firth, the bad rich man.

341
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,640
The Banks family is on the cusp of losing their house,

342
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,480
because Michael is bad at money, and Jane is a communist.

343
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,280
A home they love so much they've tied their identity to it,

344
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,960
in much the same way that Mr. Banks did his job in the original.

345
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,360
Towards the end, it looks like they're going to lose their house,

346
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,840
unless they do the thing by the stroke of midnight.

347
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,320
But don't worry, the one bad man is removed,

348
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,760
they are able to keep their house because the bank itself is good and moral,

349
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,840
and is on the side of the middle class, and thus,

350
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,680
the bank's identity and happiness can continue to be tied

351
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,520
to their possession of material things.

352
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,000
And I find that interesting, because in the original,

353
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,760
Mr. Banks lets go of the thing that he had erroneously attached

354
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,840
his own value and sense of identity to.

355
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,960
But in the remake, don't worry, they never have to have that moment of self-reevaluation,

356
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,160
because they never lose the thing they were worried about losing,

357
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,280
because good capitalist is here to save the day.

358
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,280
And he's played by Dick Van Dyke.

359
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,280
Dick Van Dyke is over here like,

360
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,800
oh, the bank would never intentionally hurt their trusting customers.

361
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:46,880
A large business always has the best intentions.

362
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,040
Big corporations aren't bad, but the rare nefarious individual.

363
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,240
That is the bad one.

364
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,600
It is not the system that is bad, but a few bad apples.

365
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,600
If anything, the transition from old Disney to new Disney is a transition from

366
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,640
monarchy is good to capitalism is good.

367
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,360
There's always a good king or a good bank or a good businessman,

368
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,480
and these conclusions, while they pay lip service to progressive ideals,

369
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,320
ultimately conclude that nothing of the status quo need be challenged.

370
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,600
Not really, which feels pretty convenient when the company producing these things

371
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,320
own more and more of the media that we consume every day.

372
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,560
But now Disney will have full control of Hulu,

373
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,680
will control its customer management, its technology, its data sharing.

374
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,000
This is not to say that empowering women to be leaders or a family keeping their house

375
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,280
or cruelty-free circuses are a bad thing, but if that's all you got, then that's not progress.

376
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,240
That's just marketing.

377
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,480
These movies are redundant, with a couple of exceptions, weird outliers like Maleficent,

378
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,880
and I guess you could make a case for The Jungle Book.

379
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,000
But for the most part, these movies don't need to exist,

380
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,800
so they give themselves a metatextual reason to exist in the text.

381
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,800
It's that thing you like, but woke.

382
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,760
For The Lion King, it's take the majestic thing and run it through this hyper-sterilized

383
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,800
realism filter.

384
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,640
For Beauty and the Beast, it's sending this love story about personal growth

385
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,520
and forgiveness through the Beast for She filter.

386
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,360
And for Aladdin, it's sending Princess Jasmine through the Girlboss filter.

387
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,920
And for Dumbo, it's take the problematic thing and de-problematizing it to the point

388
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,920
where it's unrecognizable and Dumbo isn't even the main character anymore.

389
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,960
Wow, this is a disaster.

390
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,320
Like, okay, so you've taken a property from the 1940s and you have identified that it

391
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:36,000
has certain insensitivities relating to race and animal cruelty.

392
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,080
You have declared the thing problematic.

393
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,720
Yeah, great, good for you.

394
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,920
In the words of Alan Arkin,

395
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,360
So?

396
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,360
And that's one of the more frustrating things about this era of pop criticism,

397
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,760
where we look back on media history and be like,

398
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,880
thing bad, and people can look on history with this smugness of hindsight and say,

399
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,640
you know that thing you liked as a kid?

400
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,160
Well, it was, it had problems.

401
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,320
It was problematic.

402
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,960
Did I blow your mind yet?

403
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,360
And it's like, okay.

404
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,120
So?

405
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,840
You've taken step one, you've identified the problem.

406
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,600
What do you want to do with that?

407
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,000
Are you that guy in that Onion article that always likes to bring up that John Lennon

408
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,280
beat his wife?

409
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,720
Do you want to drag the company that made the thing through the street?

410
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,200
Do you want to wave it off and say it was a product of its time, so who cares?

411
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,000
Or do you want to do what Disney is doing with its remakes and just erase the history

412
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,440
and just ignore the stuff that aged poorly and just pretend it never happened?

413
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,480
Wow, this is a disaster.

414
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,280
Because a part of media literacy is taking film history, understanding its context,

415
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,480
exploring different viewpoints on the media and the history in question,

416
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,920
and accepting it for what it was, not pretending it didn't happen.

417
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,000
There are some power structures that Disney movies are never going to challenge.

418
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,840
The original entries in the Disney film canon were never about challenge or change,

419
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,200
and so it goes with their remakes and their reboots and their sequels.

420
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,040
It's not the system that's bad, it's that women aren't allowed to be CEOs.

421
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,840
Let Jasmine be a girl boss, Sultan.

422
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,240
It's not that class stratification is bad,

423
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,080
it's just Belle totally sticking it to those narrow-minded poor townies

424
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,720
by owning a VC-funded washing machine startup.

425
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,120
Only Maleficent, hot mess though it is,

426
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,640
kind of feels a little transgressive and an outlier in this trend

427
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,280
because it's actually centered on women and their pain,

428
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,520
and actually challenges the foundation of the original

429
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,760
in a way that you don't see in any of these other movies.

430
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,040
And Maleficent's girl boss angle doesn't feel so hollow

431
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,040
since it ends with the ladies in power,

432
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:40,080
and we actually develop the originally very underdeveloped lead of Aurora

433
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,800
in lieu of trying to correct anything in the original.

434
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,600
It must needs be remarked that one of the big issues here,

435
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,960
especially once Disney started dipping into the waters of making animated films

436
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,280
with non-European settings or characters of color,

437
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,800
is that people of color or from the backgrounds of the people being depicted

438
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,120
were rarely involved in the behind-the-scenes work.

439
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,000
With the live-action films, there could have been space to correct this,

440
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,960
but Guy Ritchie is directing Aladdin, I guess.

441
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,240
Was all of Bollywood busy?

442
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,760
All of it?

443
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,680
Again, games made but ultimately still minute compared to the sheer volume of content

444
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,720
that Disney puts out, especially in the live-action department

445
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,120
that is presently doing pretty, pretty well.

446
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,440
Why the company wants to show that they recognize their problematic past with gender

447
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,400
but totally ignores its problematic history with race

448
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,480
is because it's really easy to make lean-in feminism profitable.

449
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,360
After all, Disney princesses are girl bosses now.

450
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,640
Do people assume all your problems got solved because a big strong man showed up?

451
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,720
Yes! What is up with that?

452
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,800
Just like you will be one day.

453
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,160
And this is why I find Disney wokeness highly cynical.

454
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,560
They're more than happy to show how they've changed in some regards,

455
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,240
but only the profitable ones.

456
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,840
They have better race representation now, which is good,

457
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,080
but they aren't about to admit that there was ever, ever anything the company has to move beyond.

458
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,840
Song of the South? That didn't happen. That's never getting a release.

459
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,560
These parts of Dumbo? That didn't happen.

460
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,480
What Makes the Red Man Red? We Are Siamese? Didn't happen.

461
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,200
There's no like corporate-approved profitable way to make any

462
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,720
metatextual examination of Disney's history with race representation,

463
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,200
or lack thereof, profitable. So they don't.

464
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,640
The insidious thing to me is that with Disney positioning itself

465
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,040
to be the biggest media monopoly in history,

466
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:42,160
the trend is less about meta-commentary but priming people to be loyal to the company.

467
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,840
After all, the company sees and hears your criticisms.

468
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,080
It agrees with your ideals about inclusivity.

469
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,680
So don't worry about the fact that they're well on their way to owning everything.

470
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,560
They're here to support you being a girl boss.

471
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,320
Do you have daddy issues? I don't even have a mom!

472
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,760
Neither do we!

473
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,440
And speaking of being a boss, babe, we need to pay the bills.

474
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,920
Because we live in a society.

475
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,520
So this episode was sponsored by Audible,

476
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,360
and originally this episode was going to have way more to do with Disney in the 90s,

477
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,320
but then it didn't. But I'm going to recommend Disney War on Audible to you anyway,

478
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,320
if you want to read about the supervillain rise and fall of Michael Eisner.

479
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:36,480
Try saying that ten times fast.

480
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,760
Audible members can easily exchange any title that they don't love at any time,

481

486
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,960
Yes, I have to say this twice.

487
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,680
Like it's the radio.

488

And now I finally earned this.

So
