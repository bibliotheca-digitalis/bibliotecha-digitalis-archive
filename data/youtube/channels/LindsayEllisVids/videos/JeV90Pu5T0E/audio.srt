1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
This is a really good idea. I think doing this with all these electronics around.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,400
Oh yeah. Oh, here, let me.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,440
Yeah, spill it.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,440
You should do it like a shake weight.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,160
This is a lot yellower than I anticipated.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,160
This week we come with a cocktail recipe.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,800
Yes.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:32,080
This is a burnt sugar whiskey sour to celebrate the burning love between

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,080
hot Cthulhu and Lycopyrrhic, and also Anastasia Steele's burning need for alcohol,

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,160
which we honor every week by drinking.

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:40,880
Yes.

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,600
And also because we had a lot of submissions.

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,520
You were expecting like 50.

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,960
Yeah, I was expecting around 50.

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,200
I was expecting in the 150 ballpark.

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,800
We got closer to 500. It was between 400 and 500.

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,280
Learning experience. This is how we grow.

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,120
This is how we grow. I feel like I've learned a lot about what

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,520
literary agents must go through all day, every day.

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,080
But here's the thing. You guys brought it. You brought some really good stuff.

21
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,280
Y'all brought the rain.

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,200
It's incredibly hard for us to narrow it down. I have to share some of my favorites.

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,080
Although I guess we should clarify, while we aren't going to name any names here,

24
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,240
we're still finalizing who our actual team is going to be.

25
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,560
We will share some of our favorite excerpts.

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:26,960
Yeah.

27
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,200
We have from James Carmen.

28
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,280
Why are you here? He hissed. Why do you invade my dreams?

29
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,520
But I could not finish the sentence. You're in mine.

30
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,600
Ask me to stay and I'll never leave your side again.

31
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,880
He died a thousand times in silence that followed.

32
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,160
But she turned to him, eyes brimming, and she stroked his jaw and breathed the words

33
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,880
that brought him back to life. Stay.

34
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,600
Now this one I love because it's so encapsulated.

35
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,080
My issues with Anastasia Steele and her priorities with Around Fifty Shades.

36
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,600
So you're the new heartthrob, eh? Uncle Neil chuckled as he walked

37
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,520
around me looking at me up and down. Not nearly as many tentacles as the last one.

38
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,880
Something cold and slimy writhed in my stomach and I yanked my hand out of Riley's grasp.

39
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,400
Last one, I demanded, fury giving me the confidence to look him in the eye.

40
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,480
She is a sheep unless she feels threatened by another woman.

41
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,120
But only threatened by another woman.

42
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,600
Balanced on the tip of his tentacle was a butterfly.

43
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,960
Its tiny blue wings flapped lazily, unafraid.

44
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,240
Before I manifested, I saw this as a world of tiny minds,

45
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,480
little mortals beneath pity or contempt.

46
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,720
But in a desert of countless identical grains of sand, I have found a diamond.

47
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,040
Now I know even tiny things can be beautiful.

48
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,440
Butterfly.

49
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,720
Butterfly.

50
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,320
Among other scenes we got a lot of, we got a lot of the pool scene.

51
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,680
Yeah, the pool scene, oddly enough, was very popular.

52
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,760
Another really popular one was the dream sequence, the opening dream sequence.

53
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,760
Some of them were absolutely spot on into the literalness of it.

54
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,960
And Adora Lee actually wrote a scene that the literal dream was her imagining herself as Andromeda

55
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:20,880
chained to the rocks as the Kraken monster was about to attack her and devour her.

56
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,440
I really enjoyed that.

57
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,160
We were discussing changing the name of Penelope to something else.

58
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,120
To maybe Andromeda, which is the appropriate level of ridiculousness.

59
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,920
And then her nickname could be Andy.

60
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,600
Talking about the literal dream though,

61
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,560
a few people didn't quite understand how literal this dream must be.

62
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,400
She's with her friend Mike and Jacob's there, her hands in Jacob's hand in the dream.

63
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,560
Jacob, I screamed, but he was gone and his place was a large red brown wolf with black eyes.

64
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,240
What could it mean?

65
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,680
What could it mean?

66
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,400
And then Edward steps out of the tree, his skin faintly glowing, his eyes black and dangerous.

67
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,120
Edward smiled then and his teeth were sharp, pointed.

68
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,600
What could it mean?

69
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,000
And then the dream ends with her saying,

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,600
the wolf launched himself across the space between me and the vampire fangs aiming for the jugular.

71
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,600
What could it mean?

72
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,520
That's just the greatest visual though ever.

73
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,640
Like fangs aiming like.

74
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,040
The utter lack of subtlety is key.

75
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:30,000
So one of the more difficult things that went with picking who we were going to go with,

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,480
was some people had some really great submissions.

77
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,520
And we did end up going with one or two that broke with convention a little bit.

78
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,440
But I think a lot of people kind of went with a more Lovecraftian tone

79
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,880
when what we're doing is writing a young adult novel with Lovecraftian elements.

80
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,440
So that that was a hard line to cross.

81
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,280
With Lovecraftian elements.

82
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,440
So that that was a hard line to walk.

83
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,320
Picking people that got the young adult tone,

84
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,160
but could include some of the Lovecraft ridiculous purple prose.

85
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,560
Yeah.

86
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,840
Get that thesaurus.

87
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,640
Get it!

88
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,480
Like it's uh Blazing Saddles.

89
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,960
It's like, excuse me while I whip this out.

90
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,960
Ahhhh!

91
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,280
Wait!

92
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,320
Ahhhh!

93
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,120
There aren't that many synonyms for chaos, Lovecraft.

94
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,960
You're just gonna have to say chaos a lot.

95
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,760
So what are some of the hallmarks of the young adult tone?

96
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,720
I think the most important thing, at least in modern young adult,

97
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,040
the point of view has to be from the main character.

98
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,080
Which gives it some serious limitations.

99
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,760
One of the things that bothered me in the Hunger Games

100
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,840
was because it's in Katniss's head,

101
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,360
you're with Katniss the whole time and you know exactly what she's feeling,

102
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,200
but it makes it super difficult to understand what else is going on behind the scenes.

103
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,960
And very often that leads to massive information dumps from other characters.

104
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,200
Which is a huge improvement in the movie.

105
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,480
Yeah, well that's one thing.

106
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,480
That's also kind of why I like the movie better.

107
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:54,880
Yeah.

108
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,040
Sometimes it's to the story's benefit that the audience knows information

109
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,640
that the main character does not.

110
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:00,960
Yeah.

111
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,840
And in the Hunger Games, it's like if you're over the age of, I don't know, 18,

112
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,680
you're probably at any given time a good 10 steps ahead of Katniss.

113
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,880
So she's like observing thing and you're like, okay, all right.

114
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,920
So it's a trap. Okay. So you're being set up. Okay. Yeah.

115
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,000
Like, so, you know, you're always ahead of her.

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,080
And she's always playing it like, what?

117
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,240
To me, it becomes a very difficult tense to write

118
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,680
because you don't want to play them too stupid.

119
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:27,920
Yeah.

120
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,960
But this is how you're telling the story.

121
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,440
They are the narrator.

122
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,440
We were getting some great submissions that were like omniscient third person.

123
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,320
And a lot of them had to do with the scene where

124
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,240
the female cult leader has captured ethnic third wheel.

125
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,600
Obviously, though, a scene like that is going to have to be some sort of pensive or like...

126
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah.

127
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,480
Or like someone shows it in a crystal ball.

128
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,720
Like they go to Uncle Neil's and he's like,

129
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,080
dude, let's do some reconnaissance on the bad guys.

130
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,800
Oh, shit. It's that redheaded teacher that's really hot.

131
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,280
Oh, she's your best friend.

132
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,800
The most interesting contrast is Ender's Game,

133
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,960
which I can't imagine being published today.

134
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,400
Or if it had been published today, it would not be published in the form it was.

135
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Because for one thing, it follows this kid from about age 6 to 13.

136
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,520
No bueno.

137
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,080
And for another, there are a lot of point of view shifts.

138
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,760
Like there are entire chapters from the point of view of the siblings.

139
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,800
There are entire chapters from the point of view of the teachers.

140
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,520
There are a lot of point of view shifts in that book.

141
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,120
And at the time it was published, it was just sci-fi.

142
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,640
But now it seems like what the marker for genre is,

143
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,600
unless it's really high concept, something like Life of Pi,

144
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,960
it's going to be the age of the protagonist.

145
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,880
And in that case, if you are going with young adult,

146
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,200
you have these limitations placed on you.

147
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,520
And a lot of it is tone and a lot of it is language,

148
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,560
a lot of it is point of view.

149
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,280
Even something like Ender's Game, which is not that high concept,

150
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,040
probably wouldn't be published now.

151
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,960
Because the publishers are looking like, oh, young adult, change it.

152
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,600
A good 25% of the book doesn't have Ender in it at all.

153
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,640
It can't be outside of the point of view of the protagonist.

154
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,120
It's just not done.

155
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,760
At the end of the day, we wanted people that had a good grasp

156
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,920
on that aspect of modern YA.

157
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,760
Yeah, and we saw a lot of great examples of people

158
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,880
who balance the line between the YA tone,

159
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,240
but also what makes Lovecraft lovecraft.

160
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,600
The ridiculousness.

161
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,800
And you guys made it hard.

162
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,560
We have begun getting in touch with people.

163
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,800
And as soon as we get confirmation from them,

164
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,000
um, we will be making the official announcement

165
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,440
and the writing will commence.

166
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,520
In the meantime, we still want ideas on little details,

167
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:13,120
which are, um, what I'm finding to be the most fun.

168
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,000
Yeah.

169
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,680
You know, like, when it would be like,

170
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,840
just this idea that Lego brick is reading Pride and Prejudice

171
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,360
for the fifth time or...

172
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,120
Or like what Uncle Neil, what is it?

173
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,800
His offhanded, uh, like, remarks.

174
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,480
Maybe he wears, like, bunny slippers.

175
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,880
I think his shop needs to be called Crawling Chaos.

176
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,440
So as always, follow us for updates at ChezApocalypse.com.

177
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,200
Follow us at ChezApocalypse and, uh, funny retweet Twitter.

178
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,240
Maybe we should change sexy alien book to sexy Thule book.

179
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,920
Yeah, can you do that?

180
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,640
Oh, yeah.

181
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,280
Next week, we'll have our outline done

182
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,800
and our writers probably already getting going.

183
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,160
Our goal is to have the entire manuscript

184
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,240
written and edited by the end of April.

185
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,720
It is April 2nd.

186
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,220
Holla.

187
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,740
Um...

188
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,200
Just look on her face.

189
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,480
You're crazy.

190
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,240
You're beautiful and savvy.

191
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,480
That's beautiful.

192
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,600
Reach for the stars.

193
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,000
You'll still get the moon.

194
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,400
I know, reach for the moon.

195
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,160
You'll still land among the stars.

196
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,960
That's the quote.

197
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,480
Wait, that doesn't make any sense.

198
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:22,720
No.

199
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,720
You aim for the moon.

200
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,280
If you miss, you'll still land among the stars.

201
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,520
Stars are further than the moon.

202
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:38,800
Who said that?
