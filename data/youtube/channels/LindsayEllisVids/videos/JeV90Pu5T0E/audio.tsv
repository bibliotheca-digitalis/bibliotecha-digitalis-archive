0	6640	This is a really good idea. I think doing this with all these electronics around.
6640	8400	Oh yeah. Oh, here, let me.
8400	9440	Yeah, spill it.
9440	11440	You should do it like a shake weight.
17440	22160	This is a lot yellower than I anticipated.
22160	24160	This week we come with a cocktail recipe.
24160	24800	Yes.
25200	32080	This is a burnt sugar whiskey sour to celebrate the burning love between
32960	38080	hot Cthulhu and Lycopyrrhic, and also Anastasia Steele's burning need for alcohol,
38080	40160	which we honor every week by drinking.
40160	40880	Yes.
40880	43600	And also because we had a lot of submissions.
44160	45520	You were expecting like 50.
45520	46960	Yeah, I was expecting around 50.
46960	49200	I was expecting in the 150 ballpark.
49200	52800	We got closer to 500. It was between 400 and 500.
52800	55280	Learning experience. This is how we grow.
55920	59120	This is how we grow. I feel like I've learned a lot about what
59120	61520	literary agents must go through all day, every day.
62160	66080	But here's the thing. You guys brought it. You brought some really good stuff.
66080	67280	Y'all brought the rain.
67280	73200	It's incredibly hard for us to narrow it down. I have to share some of my favorites.
73200	78080	Although I guess we should clarify, while we aren't going to name any names here,
78160	82240	we're still finalizing who our actual team is going to be.
82240	86560	We will share some of our favorite excerpts.
86560	86960	Yeah.
86960	89200	We have from James Carmen.
89760	93280	Why are you here? He hissed. Why do you invade my dreams?
94160	97520	But I could not finish the sentence. You're in mine.
98560	101600	Ask me to stay and I'll never leave your side again.
101600	104880	He died a thousand times in silence that followed.
104880	108160	But she turned to him, eyes brimming, and she stroked his jaw and breathed the words
108160	110880	that brought him back to life. Stay.
114480	117600	Now this one I love because it's so encapsulated.
117600	122080	My issues with Anastasia Steele and her priorities with Around Fifty Shades.
122080	125600	So you're the new heartthrob, eh? Uncle Neil chuckled as he walked
125600	129520	around me looking at me up and down. Not nearly as many tentacles as the last one.
130320	134880	Something cold and slimy writhed in my stomach and I yanked my hand out of Riley's grasp.
135440	140400	Last one, I demanded, fury giving me the confidence to look him in the eye.
140400	144480	She is a sheep unless she feels threatened by another woman.
145520	147120	But only threatened by another woman.
147120	149600	Balanced on the tip of his tentacle was a butterfly.
149600	152960	Its tiny blue wings flapped lazily, unafraid.
152960	156240	Before I manifested, I saw this as a world of tiny minds,
156240	158480	little mortals beneath pity or contempt.
158480	162720	But in a desert of countless identical grains of sand, I have found a diamond.
162720	165040	Now I know even tiny things can be beautiful.
168720	169440	Butterfly.
170080	170720	Butterfly.
173120	176320	Among other scenes we got a lot of, we got a lot of the pool scene.
176320	179680	Yeah, the pool scene, oddly enough, was very popular.
179680	183760	Another really popular one was the dream sequence, the opening dream sequence.
184480	187760	Some of them were absolutely spot on into the literalness of it.
187760	194960	And Adora Lee actually wrote a scene that the literal dream was her imagining herself as Andromeda
194960	200880	chained to the rocks as the Kraken monster was about to attack her and devour her.
202240	203440	I really enjoyed that.
203440	208160	We were discussing changing the name of Penelope to something else.
208160	213120	To maybe Andromeda, which is the appropriate level of ridiculousness.
213680	215920	And then her nickname could be Andy.
215920	217600	Talking about the literal dream though,
218320	222560	a few people didn't quite understand how literal this dream must be.
222560	228400	She's with her friend Mike and Jacob's there, her hands in Jacob's hand in the dream.
228400	232560	Jacob, I screamed, but he was gone and his place was a large red brown wolf with black eyes.
233120	234240	What could it mean?
234240	235680	What could it mean?
235680	240400	And then Edward steps out of the tree, his skin faintly glowing, his eyes black and dangerous.
240400	243120	Edward smiled then and his teeth were sharp, pointed.
244080	245600	What could it mean?
245600	248000	And then the dream ends with her saying,
248000	253600	the wolf launched himself across the space between me and the vampire fangs aiming for the jugular.
254240	255600	What could it mean?
255600	257520	That's just the greatest visual though ever.
257520	258640	Like fangs aiming like.
259680	263040	The utter lack of subtlety is key.
263120	270000	So one of the more difficult things that went with picking who we were going to go with,
270000	272480	was some people had some really great submissions.
273600	277520	And we did end up going with one or two that broke with convention a little bit.
277520	281440	But I think a lot of people kind of went with a more Lovecraftian tone
282400	286880	when what we're doing is writing a young adult novel with Lovecraftian elements.
286880	289440	So that that was a hard line to cross.
289680	291280	With Lovecraftian elements.
291280	293440	So that that was a hard line to walk.
293440	296320	Picking people that got the young adult tone,
296320	302160	but could include some of the Lovecraft ridiculous purple prose.
302160	302560	Yeah.
302560	303840	Get that thesaurus.
303840	304640	Get it!
304640	306480	Like it's uh Blazing Saddles.
306480	308960	It's like, excuse me while I whip this out.
308960	310960	Ahhhh!
310960	311280	Wait!
311280	312320	Ahhhh!
312320	315120	There aren't that many synonyms for chaos, Lovecraft.
315120	316960	You're just gonna have to say chaos a lot.
317840	321760	So what are some of the hallmarks of the young adult tone?
321760	324720	I think the most important thing, at least in modern young adult,
324720	329040	the point of view has to be from the main character.
330080	332080	Which gives it some serious limitations.
332080	335760	One of the things that bothered me in the Hunger Games
335760	337840	was because it's in Katniss's head,
337840	341360	you're with Katniss the whole time and you know exactly what she's feeling,
341360	345200	but it makes it super difficult to understand what else is going on behind the scenes.
345200	348960	And very often that leads to massive information dumps from other characters.
348960	351200	Which is a huge improvement in the movie.
351200	352480	Yeah, well that's one thing.
352480	354480	That's also kind of why I like the movie better.
354480	354880	Yeah.
354880	359040	Sometimes it's to the story's benefit that the audience knows information
359040	360640	that the main character does not.
360640	360960	Yeah.
360960	365840	And in the Hunger Games, it's like if you're over the age of, I don't know, 18,
365840	371680	you're probably at any given time a good 10 steps ahead of Katniss.
371680	374880	So she's like observing thing and you're like, okay, all right.
374960	377920	So it's a trap. Okay. So you're being set up. Okay. Yeah.
377920	380000	Like, so, you know, you're always ahead of her.
380000	382080	And she's always playing it like, what?
382080	384240	To me, it becomes a very difficult tense to write
385520	387680	because you don't want to play them too stupid.
387680	387920	Yeah.
388720	390960	But this is how you're telling the story.
392160	393440	They are the narrator.
393440	399440	We were getting some great submissions that were like omniscient third person.
400400	402320	And a lot of them had to do with the scene where
403360	408240	the female cult leader has captured ethnic third wheel.
408240	411600	Obviously, though, a scene like that is going to have to be some sort of pensive or like...
411600	412000	Yeah.
412000	414480	Or like someone shows it in a crystal ball.
414480	416720	Like they go to Uncle Neil's and he's like,
416720	420080	dude, let's do some reconnaissance on the bad guys.
420080	422800	Oh, shit. It's that redheaded teacher that's really hot.
423600	425280	Oh, she's your best friend.
425840	428800	The most interesting contrast is Ender's Game,
429440	432960	which I can't imagine being published today.
433680	438400	Or if it had been published today, it would not be published in the form it was.
438400	442400	Because for one thing, it follows this kid from about age 6 to 13.
442400	443520	No bueno.
443520	448080	And for another, there are a lot of point of view shifts.
448080	451760	Like there are entire chapters from the point of view of the siblings.
451760	454800	There are entire chapters from the point of view of the teachers.
454880	457520	There are a lot of point of view shifts in that book.
457520	461120	And at the time it was published, it was just sci-fi.
461760	466640	But now it seems like what the marker for genre is,
466640	469600	unless it's really high concept, something like Life of Pi,
470320	472960	it's going to be the age of the protagonist.
473600	476880	And in that case, if you are going with young adult,
477680	481200	you have these limitations placed on you.
481200	483520	And a lot of it is tone and a lot of it is language,
483520	484560	a lot of it is point of view.
485120	489280	Even something like Ender's Game, which is not that high concept,
490720	493040	probably wouldn't be published now.
493040	496960	Because the publishers are looking like, oh, young adult, change it.
497680	501600	A good 25% of the book doesn't have Ender in it at all.
501600	506640	It can't be outside of the point of view of the protagonist.
507280	509120	It's just not done.
509840	515760	At the end of the day, we wanted people that had a good grasp
515760	517920	on that aspect of modern YA.
517920	521760	Yeah, and we saw a lot of great examples of people
521760	524880	who balance the line between the YA tone,
525440	528240	but also what makes Lovecraft lovecraft.
528240	529600	The ridiculousness.
529600	532800	And you guys made it hard.
532800	534560	We have begun getting in touch with people.
534560	536800	And as soon as we get confirmation from them,
537440	540000	um, we will be making the official announcement
540000	541440	and the writing will commence.
544480	547520	In the meantime, we still want ideas on little details,
547520	553120	which are, um, what I'm finding to be the most fun.
553680	554000	Yeah.
554000	555680	You know, like, when it would be like,
555680	559840	just this idea that Lego brick is reading Pride and Prejudice
559840	561360	for the fifth time or...
561360	563120	Or like what Uncle Neil, what is it?
563600	566800	His offhanded, uh, like, remarks.
566800	568480	Maybe he wears, like, bunny slippers.
568480	570880	I think his shop needs to be called Crawling Chaos.
571840	575440	So as always, follow us for updates at ChezApocalypse.com.
575440	579200	Follow us at ChezApocalypse and, uh, funny retweet Twitter.
579200	582240	Maybe we should change sexy alien book to sexy Thule book.
582880	583920	Yeah, can you do that?
583920	584640	Oh, yeah.
584640	587280	Next week, we'll have our outline done
588080	592800	and our writers probably already getting going.
593360	596160	Our goal is to have the entire manuscript
596160	598240	written and edited by the end of April.
599120	600720	It is April 2nd.
600720	601220	Holla.
602240	602740	Um...
604160	605200	Just look on her face.
607360	608480	You're crazy.
608480	610240	You're beautiful and savvy.
611600	612480	That's beautiful.
612480	613600	Reach for the stars.
614320	616000	You'll still get the moon.
616880	618400	I know, reach for the moon.
618400	620160	You'll still land among the stars.
620160	620960	That's the quote.
620960	622480	Wait, that doesn't make any sense.
622480	622720	No.
623200	624720	You aim for the moon.
624720	627280	If you miss, you'll still land among the stars.
628160	629520	Stars are further than the moon.
629520	638800	Who said that?
