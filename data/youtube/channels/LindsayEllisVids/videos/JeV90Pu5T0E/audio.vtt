WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.640
This is a really good idea. I think doing this with all these electronics around.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.400
Oh yeah. Oh, here, let me.

00:08.400 --> 00:09.440
Yeah, spill it.

00:09.440 --> 00:11.440
You should do it like a shake weight.

00:17.440 --> 00:22.160
This is a lot yellower than I anticipated.

00:22.160 --> 00:24.160
This week we come with a cocktail recipe.

00:24.160 --> 00:24.800
Yes.

00:25.200 --> 00:32.080
This is a burnt sugar whiskey sour to celebrate the burning love between

00:32.960 --> 00:38.080
hot Cthulhu and Lycopyrrhic, and also Anastasia Steele's burning need for alcohol,

00:38.080 --> 00:40.160
which we honor every week by drinking.

00:40.160 --> 00:40.880
Yes.

00:40.880 --> 00:43.600
And also because we had a lot of submissions.

00:44.160 --> 00:45.520
You were expecting like 50.

00:45.520 --> 00:46.960
Yeah, I was expecting around 50.

00:46.960 --> 00:49.200
I was expecting in the 150 ballpark.

00:49.200 --> 00:52.800
We got closer to 500. It was between 400 and 500.

00:52.800 --> 00:55.280
Learning experience. This is how we grow.

00:55.920 --> 00:59.120
This is how we grow. I feel like I've learned a lot about what

00:59.120 --> 01:01.520
literary agents must go through all day, every day.

01:02.160 --> 01:06.080
But here's the thing. You guys brought it. You brought some really good stuff.

01:06.080 --> 01:07.280
Y'all brought the rain.

01:07.280 --> 01:13.200
It's incredibly hard for us to narrow it down. I have to share some of my favorites.

01:13.200 --> 01:18.080
Although I guess we should clarify, while we aren't going to name any names here,

01:18.160 --> 01:22.240
we're still finalizing who our actual team is going to be.

01:22.240 --> 01:26.560
We will share some of our favorite excerpts.

01:26.560 --> 01:26.960
Yeah.

01:26.960 --> 01:29.200
We have from James Carmen.

01:29.760 --> 01:33.280
Why are you here? He hissed. Why do you invade my dreams?

01:34.160 --> 01:37.520
But I could not finish the sentence. You're in mine.

01:38.560 --> 01:41.600
Ask me to stay and I'll never leave your side again.

01:41.600 --> 01:44.880
He died a thousand times in silence that followed.

01:44.880 --> 01:48.160
But she turned to him, eyes brimming, and she stroked his jaw and breathed the words

01:48.160 --> 01:50.880
that brought him back to life. Stay.

01:54.480 --> 01:57.600
Now this one I love because it's so encapsulated.

01:57.600 --> 02:02.080
My issues with Anastasia Steele and her priorities with Around Fifty Shades.

02:02.080 --> 02:05.600
So you're the new heartthrob, eh? Uncle Neil chuckled as he walked

02:05.600 --> 02:09.520
around me looking at me up and down. Not nearly as many tentacles as the last one.

02:10.320 --> 02:14.880
Something cold and slimy writhed in my stomach and I yanked my hand out of Riley's grasp.

02:15.440 --> 02:20.400
Last one, I demanded, fury giving me the confidence to look him in the eye.

02:20.400 --> 02:24.480
She is a sheep unless she feels threatened by another woman.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.120
But only threatened by another woman.

02:27.120 --> 02:29.600
Balanced on the tip of his tentacle was a butterfly.

02:29.600 --> 02:32.960
Its tiny blue wings flapped lazily, unafraid.

02:32.960 --> 02:36.240
Before I manifested, I saw this as a world of tiny minds,

02:36.240 --> 02:38.480
little mortals beneath pity or contempt.

02:38.480 --> 02:42.720
But in a desert of countless identical grains of sand, I have found a diamond.

02:42.720 --> 02:45.040
Now I know even tiny things can be beautiful.

02:48.720 --> 02:49.440
Butterfly.

02:50.080 --> 02:50.720
Butterfly.

02:53.120 --> 02:56.320
Among other scenes we got a lot of, we got a lot of the pool scene.

02:56.320 --> 02:59.680
Yeah, the pool scene, oddly enough, was very popular.

02:59.680 --> 03:03.760
Another really popular one was the dream sequence, the opening dream sequence.

03:04.480 --> 03:07.760
Some of them were absolutely spot on into the literalness of it.

03:07.760 --> 03:14.960
And Adora Lee actually wrote a scene that the literal dream was her imagining herself as Andromeda

03:14.960 --> 03:20.880
chained to the rocks as the Kraken monster was about to attack her and devour her.

03:22.240 --> 03:23.440
I really enjoyed that.

03:23.440 --> 03:28.160
We were discussing changing the name of Penelope to something else.

03:28.160 --> 03:33.120
To maybe Andromeda, which is the appropriate level of ridiculousness.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.920
And then her nickname could be Andy.

03:35.920 --> 03:37.600
Talking about the literal dream though,

03:38.320 --> 03:42.560
a few people didn't quite understand how literal this dream must be.

03:42.560 --> 03:48.400
She's with her friend Mike and Jacob's there, her hands in Jacob's hand in the dream.

03:48.400 --> 03:52.560
Jacob, I screamed, but he was gone and his place was a large red brown wolf with black eyes.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.240
What could it mean?

03:54.240 --> 03:55.680
What could it mean?

03:55.680 --> 04:00.400
And then Edward steps out of the tree, his skin faintly glowing, his eyes black and dangerous.

04:00.400 --> 04:03.120
Edward smiled then and his teeth were sharp, pointed.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.600
What could it mean?

04:05.600 --> 04:08.000
And then the dream ends with her saying,

04:08.000 --> 04:13.600
the wolf launched himself across the space between me and the vampire fangs aiming for the jugular.

04:14.240 --> 04:15.600
What could it mean?

04:15.600 --> 04:17.520
That's just the greatest visual though ever.

04:17.520 --> 04:18.640
Like fangs aiming like.

04:19.680 --> 04:23.040
The utter lack of subtlety is key.

04:23.120 --> 04:30.000
So one of the more difficult things that went with picking who we were going to go with,

04:30.000 --> 04:32.480
was some people had some really great submissions.

04:33.600 --> 04:37.520
And we did end up going with one or two that broke with convention a little bit.

04:37.520 --> 04:41.440
But I think a lot of people kind of went with a more Lovecraftian tone

04:42.400 --> 04:46.880
when what we're doing is writing a young adult novel with Lovecraftian elements.

04:46.880 --> 04:49.440
So that that was a hard line to cross.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.280
With Lovecraftian elements.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.440
So that that was a hard line to walk.

04:53.440 --> 04:56.320
Picking people that got the young adult tone,

04:56.320 --> 05:02.160
but could include some of the Lovecraft ridiculous purple prose.

05:02.160 --> 05:02.560
Yeah.

05:02.560 --> 05:03.840
Get that thesaurus.

05:03.840 --> 05:04.640
Get it!

05:04.640 --> 05:06.480
Like it's uh Blazing Saddles.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.960
It's like, excuse me while I whip this out.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.960
Ahhhh!

05:10.960 --> 05:11.280
Wait!

05:11.280 --> 05:12.320
Ahhhh!

05:12.320 --> 05:15.120
There aren't that many synonyms for chaos, Lovecraft.

05:15.120 --> 05:16.960
You're just gonna have to say chaos a lot.

05:17.840 --> 05:21.760
So what are some of the hallmarks of the young adult tone?

05:21.760 --> 05:24.720
I think the most important thing, at least in modern young adult,

05:24.720 --> 05:29.040
the point of view has to be from the main character.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.080
Which gives it some serious limitations.

05:32.080 --> 05:35.760
One of the things that bothered me in the Hunger Games

05:35.760 --> 05:37.840
was because it's in Katniss's head,

05:37.840 --> 05:41.360
you're with Katniss the whole time and you know exactly what she's feeling,

05:41.360 --> 05:45.200
but it makes it super difficult to understand what else is going on behind the scenes.

05:45.200 --> 05:48.960
And very often that leads to massive information dumps from other characters.

05:48.960 --> 05:51.200
Which is a huge improvement in the movie.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.480
Yeah, well that's one thing.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.480
That's also kind of why I like the movie better.

05:54.480 --> 05:54.880
Yeah.

05:54.880 --> 05:59.040
Sometimes it's to the story's benefit that the audience knows information

05:59.040 --> 06:00.640
that the main character does not.

06:00.640 --> 06:00.960
Yeah.

06:00.960 --> 06:05.840
And in the Hunger Games, it's like if you're over the age of, I don't know, 18,

06:05.840 --> 06:11.680
you're probably at any given time a good 10 steps ahead of Katniss.

06:11.680 --> 06:14.880
So she's like observing thing and you're like, okay, all right.

06:14.960 --> 06:17.920
So it's a trap. Okay. So you're being set up. Okay. Yeah.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.000
Like, so, you know, you're always ahead of her.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.080
And she's always playing it like, what?

06:22.080 --> 06:24.240
To me, it becomes a very difficult tense to write

06:25.520 --> 06:27.680
because you don't want to play them too stupid.

06:27.680 --> 06:27.920
Yeah.

06:28.720 --> 06:30.960
But this is how you're telling the story.

06:32.160 --> 06:33.440
They are the narrator.

06:33.440 --> 06:39.440
We were getting some great submissions that were like omniscient third person.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.320
And a lot of them had to do with the scene where

06:43.360 --> 06:48.240
the female cult leader has captured ethnic third wheel.

06:48.240 --> 06:51.600
Obviously, though, a scene like that is going to have to be some sort of pensive or like...

06:51.600 --> 06:52.000
Yeah.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.480
Or like someone shows it in a crystal ball.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.720
Like they go to Uncle Neil's and he's like,

06:56.720 --> 07:00.080
dude, let's do some reconnaissance on the bad guys.

07:00.080 --> 07:02.800
Oh, shit. It's that redheaded teacher that's really hot.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.280
Oh, she's your best friend.

07:05.840 --> 07:08.800
The most interesting contrast is Ender's Game,

07:09.440 --> 07:12.960
which I can't imagine being published today.

07:13.680 --> 07:18.400
Or if it had been published today, it would not be published in the form it was.

07:18.400 --> 07:22.400
Because for one thing, it follows this kid from about age 6 to 13.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.520
No bueno.

07:23.520 --> 07:28.080
And for another, there are a lot of point of view shifts.

07:28.080 --> 07:31.760
Like there are entire chapters from the point of view of the siblings.

07:31.760 --> 07:34.800
There are entire chapters from the point of view of the teachers.

07:34.880 --> 07:37.520
There are a lot of point of view shifts in that book.

07:37.520 --> 07:41.120
And at the time it was published, it was just sci-fi.

07:41.760 --> 07:46.640
But now it seems like what the marker for genre is,

07:46.640 --> 07:49.600
unless it's really high concept, something like Life of Pi,

07:50.320 --> 07:52.960
it's going to be the age of the protagonist.

07:53.600 --> 07:56.880
And in that case, if you are going with young adult,

07:57.680 --> 08:01.200
you have these limitations placed on you.

08:01.200 --> 08:03.520
And a lot of it is tone and a lot of it is language,

08:03.520 --> 08:04.560
a lot of it is point of view.

08:05.120 --> 08:09.280
Even something like Ender's Game, which is not that high concept,

08:10.720 --> 08:13.040
probably wouldn't be published now.

08:13.040 --> 08:16.960
Because the publishers are looking like, oh, young adult, change it.

08:17.680 --> 08:21.600
A good 25% of the book doesn't have Ender in it at all.

08:21.600 --> 08:26.640
It can't be outside of the point of view of the protagonist.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.120
It's just not done.

08:29.840 --> 08:35.760
At the end of the day, we wanted people that had a good grasp

08:35.760 --> 08:37.920
on that aspect of modern YA.

08:37.920 --> 08:41.760
Yeah, and we saw a lot of great examples of people

08:41.760 --> 08:44.880
who balance the line between the YA tone,

08:45.440 --> 08:48.240
but also what makes Lovecraft lovecraft.

08:48.240 --> 08:49.600
The ridiculousness.

08:49.600 --> 08:52.800
And you guys made it hard.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.560
We have begun getting in touch with people.

08:54.560 --> 08:56.800
And as soon as we get confirmation from them,

08:57.440 --> 09:00.000
um, we will be making the official announcement

09:00.000 --> 09:01.440
and the writing will commence.

09:04.480 --> 09:07.520
In the meantime, we still want ideas on little details,

09:07.520 --> 09:13.120
which are, um, what I'm finding to be the most fun.

09:13.680 --> 09:14.000
Yeah.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.680
You know, like, when it would be like,

09:15.680 --> 09:19.840
just this idea that Lego brick is reading Pride and Prejudice

09:19.840 --> 09:21.360
for the fifth time or...

09:21.360 --> 09:23.120
Or like what Uncle Neil, what is it?

09:23.600 --> 09:26.800
His offhanded, uh, like, remarks.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.480
Maybe he wears, like, bunny slippers.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.880
I think his shop needs to be called Crawling Chaos.

09:31.840 --> 09:35.440
So as always, follow us for updates at ChezApocalypse.com.

09:35.440 --> 09:39.200
Follow us at ChezApocalypse and, uh, funny retweet Twitter.

09:39.200 --> 09:42.240
Maybe we should change sexy alien book to sexy Thule book.

09:42.880 --> 09:43.920
Yeah, can you do that?

09:43.920 --> 09:44.640
Oh, yeah.

09:44.640 --> 09:47.280
Next week, we'll have our outline done

09:48.080 --> 09:52.800
and our writers probably already getting going.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.160
Our goal is to have the entire manuscript

09:56.160 --> 09:58.240
written and edited by the end of April.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.720
It is April 2nd.

10:00.720 --> 10:01.220
Holla.

10:02.240 --> 10:02.740
Um...

10:04.160 --> 10:05.200
Just look on her face.

10:07.360 --> 10:08.480
You're crazy.

10:08.480 --> 10:10.240
You're beautiful and savvy.

10:11.600 --> 10:12.480
That's beautiful.

10:12.480 --> 10:13.600
Reach for the stars.

10:14.320 --> 10:16.000
You'll still get the moon.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.400
I know, reach for the moon.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.160
You'll still land among the stars.

10:20.160 --> 10:20.960
That's the quote.

10:20.960 --> 10:22.480
Wait, that doesn't make any sense.

10:22.480 --> 10:22.720
No.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.720
You aim for the moon.

10:24.720 --> 10:27.280
If you miss, you'll still land among the stars.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.520
Stars are further than the moon.

10:29.520 --> 10:38.800
Who said that?
