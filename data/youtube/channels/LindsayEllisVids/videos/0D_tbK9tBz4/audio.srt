1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
So, we're back, bitches!

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,000
Woo!

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
It's been like some time!

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Ah, thank you.

5
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,000
Yeah.

6
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Pass over that other one.

7
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This week, it's Omagong three philosphers...

8
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
...philophethers...

9
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
...ale, because, um...

10
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
...'cause...

11
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
...you know.

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's good, that's why.

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Cheers!

14
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Welcome to the second season of our, uh...

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
...book-themed show...

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
...titled, To Be Decided.

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yes, we decided to move away from the, uh...

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
...Fifty Shades of Green moniker...

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
...mainly because it was really driving me crazy with the, uh...

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
...Google alerts I had...

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
...where it'd be things for, like, gardening.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So, it's been a while, we had an interesting year...

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
...watching Awoken...

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
...leave the nest...

25
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
...and, uh...

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
...so now it's time for season two, because obviously...

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
...this being young adult paranormal romance...

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
...you gotta have a...

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
...yeah, it's a trilogy.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Obviously, it's a trilogy.

31
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But, you know, since we, you know...

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
...we spent so much time last season, like, coming up with our gimmick...

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
...and, you know, talking about, like, who the characters were...

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
...obviously this season it's not going to be that so much...

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
...because we already know who the characters are...

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
...and while we do, of course, need a plot...

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
...um, you know, we know what our gimmick is and all that, so...

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
...this season we're going to expand the reach...

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
...of this show and this channel...

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
...uh, once we decide what it's called.

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And that's where you come in.

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's not laziness.

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's not our, uh...

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
...complete dearth of creativity.

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's just because we love your suggestions...

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
...and it's just more fun than bringing the kids in to play.

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yeah, since we figured, like, the show was always intended to be interactive...

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
...when we came up with the title, it was inspired by...

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
...Fifty Shades of Grey...

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
...and, uh, now it's kind of turned into...

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
...you know, Fifty Shades of Grey knockoff slash parody...

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
...number 9,007,365.

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So, um, and it's also moved away...

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
...because we initially thought it was going to be more...

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
...along the lines of a Fifty Shades parody...

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
...and it did not turn out to be that, yeah.

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So, yeah, I think we need to move away.

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It went off, did its own thing, and...

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
...we think it's time to pick a name or create a name.

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That more reflects that.

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah.

62
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
See, our wall is very much, you know, still alive...

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
...and still very, uh, Cthulhu-inspired.

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Why mess with perfection?

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yeah.

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We do need more wall things, though.

67
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But since we intend to expand our reach...

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
...we might want to expand beyond the world of...

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
...young adult paranormal romance...

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
...as that genre's kind of dead.

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Mmm.

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But another thing this season we also wanted...

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
...was not just to create a project...

74
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
...which obviously we will do, because that's fun...

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
...and people have fun with it.

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And hopefully keep better track of whose idea was what.

77
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yeah.

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Because we were really bad about that.

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You know, it's said that to become a better writer...

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
...you should read a lot.

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Mm-hmm.

82
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Um, so I think to prepare for writing...

83
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
...the second book of Awoken...

84
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
...to really grow as writers ourselves...

85
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
...I think we need to delve deeper into the young adult...

86
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
...genre, uh, fiction.

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Well, not just young adult.

88
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I think since we'd been knocking around ideas for the sequel...

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
...a lot of those ideas were inspired by, um, you know...

90
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
...adult books like Pray Love and...

91
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm really excited about that one.

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah.

93
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And we'll talk about, uh, Awoken Book Two...

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
...uh, which I think should be called Arisen.

95
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
No, of course.

96
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Next week.

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
If you guys can come up with something better than Arisen.

98
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But we're pretty.

99
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Our hearts are pretty set on Arisen.

100
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So, like, challenge accepted...

101
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
...but, like, our hearts are really on it being Book Two title.

102
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah.

103
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Well, I mean, that's the thing with the YA trilogies...

104
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
...is, like, they're all, like, divergent...

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
...was it insurgent?

106
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Allegiant?

107
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You know, they're, like, all the same word.

108
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Astringent.

109
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Belligerent.

110
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Belligerent.

111
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Like, it's all, they're all the same word.

112
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Frozen.

113
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Frozen.

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah, no, Disney took it to Tangled.

115
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Tangled?

116
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Are you kidding me?

117
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
In fact, her hair decidedly did not get tangled...

118
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
...at any point in that friggin' movie.

119
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Like, at least Frozen, like, you know, was in it.

120
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Like, there was no tangling in Tangled.

121
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No.

122
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I mean, she has magic hair.

123
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
There's no tangling.

124
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It was pretty, it was pretty fuckin' well-conditioned, that hair.

125
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The idea is to make a shaved book club...

126
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
...with you giving us the suggestions of what should be on our reading list.

127
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Now, please don't throw us in just totally bad books.

128
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We like some variety.

129
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
While bad is fun, and, you know, ranting is fun...

130
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
...I feel like I'm more interested in what people like...

131
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
...and what people respond to emotionally, personally.

132
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And also, like, who likes reading shitty books?

133
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Well, we do, apparently.

134
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Because we read so many bad books last year.

135
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't know if like is the right word.

136
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I feel like a shitty book kind of drains you more than a shitty movie.

137
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yeah, it's more of a time.

138
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
There's no 2012 for books.

139
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
No.

140
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Except for maybe The Da Vinci Code.

141
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So, for books that people are going to suggest to us...

142
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
...we do have some restrictions.

143
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Let's see.

144
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
One, we can't have read them already.

145
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Because we want our responses to feel fresh.

146
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yes.

147
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The next rule is that no Game of Thrones-length books.

148
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We need to be able to knock this out in two weeks.

149
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Exactly.

150
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And that's the time frame.

151
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Two weeks, you suggest a book.

152
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Two weeks, we read it.

153
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We come back with our review of it.

154
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So, we gotta keep it...

155
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What's the page count?

156
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I don't know.

157
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Game of Thrones is like 300-some thousand words.

158
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's three Twilights.

159
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
No Dostoevsky.

160
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Keep it in your average bestseller range.

161
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Something that won't make my eyes go cross.

162
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
100-150 thousand words.

163
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
No tomes.

164
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
No Lord of the Rings.

165
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Because, you know, we're on a time frame.

166
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
As much as we like long books, but...

167
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We do that on our own time.

168
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That's another great thing about Young Adult.

169
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Short.

170
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It needs to be a recent title.

171
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Within the last five years.

172
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I can't think of why we might make an exception, but maybe we will.

173
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Who knows?

174
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And keeping it in the theme of our show is that...

175
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
...since we were inspired by Young Adult and science fiction and fantasy...

176
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
...we probably want to stick to Young Adult, science fiction, and fantasy.

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Not just Young Adult.

178
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And also I feel like the lines between Young Adult and adult are getting blurred a lot more.

179
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yeah.

180
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Trying to market something to broader audiences is much more popular.

181
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Although, whenever I go into the Young Adult section...

182
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You know, I'll go into the library and check out a book that is in the...

183
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And then there are all these teenagers looking at me like...

184
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And I feel like Amy Poehler in Mean Girls.

185
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm like, hey! What's up, homies?

186
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm not a regular mom. I'm a cool mom.

187
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Someday I think we need to go to a mall.

188
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I went to the mall the other day and there were teenagers there.

189
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Which surprised me because I didn't know teenagers still went to the mall.

190
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I thought they just kind of stayed inside and played World of Warcraft.

191
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I went to the Queen's Center Mall and it was full of teenagers.

192
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
They were all talking about Divergent.

193
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And I was like, they're real.

194
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
We should talk to them and see what they like now.

195
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm like, do you actually watch MTV?

196
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Because someone has to.

197
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yeah.

198
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Or, what do you like?

199
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We're so old.

200
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I know!

201
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's weird to think that I'm in the same generation of these kids.

202
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's just like, technically we're all millennials.

203
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But I'm just like, I have this old soul I feel in my feet.

204
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm like, take antacids now!

205
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Me too.

206
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
For Arisen, again, we have some ideas.

207
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Inspired very much by...

208
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Eat, Pray, Love.

209
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Eat, Pray, Love.

210
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Because of course, of course Cthulhu has to leave her.

211
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Of course.

212
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And only this time, you know, she's not going to...

213
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Well, I mean, she'll probably want to kill herself.

214
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
She needs to go on an Eat, Pray, Love trip.

215
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yeah.

216
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So about that show title.

217
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We originally titled the show when we thought the show was going to take a different direction than it did.

218
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So knowing now that, you know, it is going to hinge almost entirely on the Cthulhu Lego brick trilogy.

219
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But also on an expanded goal of exploring what is out there right now.

220
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yeah.

221
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Try to avoid the Lovecraft or Cthulhu references.

222
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So if you have an idea for what our title could be or should be.

223
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Something that screams, we're reading books.

224
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
We're reading books and we're writing about sexy Cthulhu.

225
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Just so damn charming and quirky.

226
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Two ladies and beer, what else?

227
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Literary and drinky.

228
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And we drink a lot.

229
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah.

230
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Because again, with the Fifty Shades, you know, it was inspired by Anna's most of her calories being alcohol calories.

231
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Not that I would know any...

232
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Fucking protein thing about that.

233
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Would a leafy green kill you?

234
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So welcome back to the books and drinking show of indeterminate name.

235
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Season 2.

236
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Rebranding Boogaloo.

237
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
We can't wait to get started in earnest on Awoken Book 2 Arisen.

238
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But in the meanwhile, leave your suggestions for stuff we should read in the comments.

239
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
We will announce our selections on Twitter based on popularity of the thing suggested.

240
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And also if we are interested in it or not.

241
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
We should probably keep track of our progress on Goodreads.

242
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah, we should start a Goodreads account.

243
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yeah.

244
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
We just came up with an idea.

245
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So we look forward to another season of interactive book written debauchery as helped and enabled by you.

246
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And booze.

247
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And also beer.

248
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Cheers.
