0	1500	So, we're back, bitches!
1500	2000	Woo!
2000	3000	It's been like some time!
3000	3500	Ah, thank you.
3500	4000	Yeah.
4000	5000	Pass over that other one.
5000	8000	This week, it's Omagong three philosphers...
8000	10000	...philophethers...
10000	12000	...ale, because, um...
12000	14000	...'cause...
16000	17000	...you know.
18000	19000	It's good, that's why.
22000	23000	Cheers!
23000	26000	Welcome to the second season of our, uh...
26000	28000	...book-themed show...
29000	31000	...titled, To Be Decided.
31000	33000	Yes, we decided to move away from the, uh...
33000	35000	...Fifty Shades of Green moniker...
35000	38000	...mainly because it was really driving me crazy with the, uh...
38000	40000	...Google alerts I had...
40000	42000	...where it'd be things for, like, gardening.
42000	45000	So, it's been a while, we had an interesting year...
45000	47000	...watching Awoken...
47000	49000	...leave the nest...
49000	50000	...and, uh...
50000	53000	...so now it's time for season two, because obviously...
53000	56000	...this being young adult paranormal romance...
56000	58000	...you gotta have a...
58000	60000	...yeah, it's a trilogy.
60000	61000	Obviously, it's a trilogy.
61000	63000	But, you know, since we, you know...
63000	66000	...we spent so much time last season, like, coming up with our gimmick...
66000	69000	...and, you know, talking about, like, who the characters were...
69000	73000	...obviously this season it's not going to be that so much...
73000	75000	...because we already know who the characters are...
75000	77000	...and while we do, of course, need a plot...
77000	80000	...um, you know, we know what our gimmick is and all that, so...
80000	84000	...this season we're going to expand the reach...
84000	86000	...of this show and this channel...
86000	89000	...uh, once we decide what it's called.
89000	91000	And that's where you come in.
92000	94000	It's not laziness.
94000	96000	It's not our, uh...
96000	99000	...complete dearth of creativity.
99000	102000	It's just because we love your suggestions...
102000	105000	...and it's just more fun than bringing the kids in to play.
105000	109000	Yeah, since we figured, like, the show was always intended to be interactive...
109000	112000	...when we came up with the title, it was inspired by...
112000	114000	...Fifty Shades of Grey...
114000	117000	...and, uh, now it's kind of turned into...
117000	120000	...you know, Fifty Shades of Grey knockoff slash parody...
120000	123000	...number 9,007,365.
123000	126000	So, um, and it's also moved away...
126000	128000	...because we initially thought it was going to be more...
128000	130000	...along the lines of a Fifty Shades parody...
130000	132000	...and it did not turn out to be that, yeah.
132000	135000	So, yeah, I think we need to move away.
135000	138000	It went off, did its own thing, and...
138000	141000	...we think it's time to pick a name or create a name.
141000	142000	That more reflects that.
142000	143000	Yeah.
143000	146000	See, our wall is very much, you know, still alive...
146000	150000	...and still very, uh, Cthulhu-inspired.
150000	152000	Why mess with perfection?
152000	153000	Yeah.
153000	155000	We do need more wall things, though.
155000	158000	But since we intend to expand our reach...
158000	161000	...we might want to expand beyond the world of...
161000	164000	...young adult paranormal romance...
164000	167000	...as that genre's kind of dead.
167000	168000	Mmm.
170000	172000	But another thing this season we also wanted...
172000	175000	...was not just to create a project...
175000	177000	...which obviously we will do, because that's fun...
177000	179000	...and people have fun with it.
179000	183000	And hopefully keep better track of whose idea was what.
183000	184000	Yeah.
184000	186000	Because we were really bad about that.
186000	188000	You know, it's said that to become a better writer...
188000	190000	...you should read a lot.
190000	191000	Mm-hmm.
191000	195000	Um, so I think to prepare for writing...
195000	197000	...the second book of Awoken...
197000	200000	...to really grow as writers ourselves...
200000	203000	...I think we need to delve deeper into the young adult...
203000	206000	...genre, uh, fiction.
206000	207000	Well, not just young adult.
207000	210000	I think since we'd been knocking around ideas for the sequel...
210000	214000	...a lot of those ideas were inspired by, um, you know...
214000	217000	...adult books like Pray Love and...
217000	220000	I'm really excited about that one.
220000	221000	Yeah.
221000	224000	And we'll talk about, uh, Awoken Book Two...
224000	226000	...uh, which I think should be called Arisen.
226000	227000	No, of course.
227000	228000	Next week.
228000	230000	If you guys can come up with something better than Arisen.
230000	231000	But we're pretty.
231000	233000	Our hearts are pretty set on Arisen.
233000	235000	So, like, challenge accepted...
235000	239000	...but, like, our hearts are really on it being Book Two title.
239000	240000	Yeah.
240000	243000	Well, I mean, that's the thing with the YA trilogies...
243000	246000	...is, like, they're all, like, divergent...
246000	247000	...was it insurgent?
247000	248000	Allegiant?
248000	250000	You know, they're, like, all the same word.
250000	251000	Astringent.
251000	252000	Belligerent.
252000	253000	Belligerent.
253000	255000	Like, it's all, they're all the same word.
256000	257000	Frozen.
257000	258000	Frozen.
258000	260000	Yeah, no, Disney took it to Tangled.
260000	261000	Tangled?
261000	262000	Are you kidding me?
262000	264000	In fact, her hair decidedly did not get tangled...
264000	266000	...at any point in that friggin' movie.
266000	269000	Like, at least Frozen, like, you know, was in it.
269000	271000	Like, there was no tangling in Tangled.
271000	272000	No.
272000	273000	I mean, she has magic hair.
273000	274000	There's no tangling.
274000	277000	It was pretty, it was pretty fuckin' well-conditioned, that hair.
277000	280000	The idea is to make a shaved book club...
280000	284000	...with you giving us the suggestions of what should be on our reading list.
284000	288000	Now, please don't throw us in just totally bad books.
288000	290000	We like some variety.
290000	294000	While bad is fun, and, you know, ranting is fun...
294000	298000	...I feel like I'm more interested in what people like...
298000	301000	...and what people respond to emotionally, personally.
301000	303000	And also, like, who likes reading shitty books?
303000	305000	Well, we do, apparently.
305000	307000	Because we read so many bad books last year.
307000	309000	I don't know if like is the right word.
310000	313000	I feel like a shitty book kind of drains you more than a shitty movie.
313000	315000	Yeah, it's more of a time.
315000	317000	There's no 2012 for books.
317000	318000	No.
318000	320000	Except for maybe The Da Vinci Code.
321000	323000	So, for books that people are going to suggest to us...
323000	325000	...we do have some restrictions.
325000	326000	Let's see.
326000	329000	One, we can't have read them already.
329000	332000	Because we want our responses to feel fresh.
332000	333000	Yes.
333000	338000	The next rule is that no Game of Thrones-length books.
338000	340000	We need to be able to knock this out in two weeks.
340000	341000	Exactly.
341000	342000	And that's the time frame.
342000	343000	Two weeks, you suggest a book.
343000	344000	Two weeks, we read it.
344000	347000	We come back with our review of it.
347000	349000	So, we gotta keep it...
349000	351000	What's the page count?
351000	352000	I don't know.
352000	355000	Game of Thrones is like 300-some thousand words.
355000	356000	It's three Twilights.
356000	357000	No Dostoevsky.
357000	360000	Keep it in your average bestseller range.
360000	362000	Something that won't make my eyes go cross.
362000	364000	100-150 thousand words.
364000	366000	No tomes.
366000	367000	No Lord of the Rings.
367000	369000	Because, you know, we're on a time frame.
369000	371000	As much as we like long books, but...
371000	373000	We do that on our own time.
373000	375000	That's another great thing about Young Adult.
375000	376000	Short.
377000	379000	It needs to be a recent title.
379000	380000	Within the last five years.
380000	383000	I can't think of why we might make an exception, but maybe we will.
383000	384000	Who knows?
384000	387000	And keeping it in the theme of our show is that...
387000	392000	...since we were inspired by Young Adult and science fiction and fantasy...
392000	396000	...we probably want to stick to Young Adult, science fiction, and fantasy.
396000	398000	Not just Young Adult.
398000	402000	And also I feel like the lines between Young Adult and adult are getting blurred a lot more.
402000	403000	Yeah.
403000	408000	Trying to market something to broader audiences is much more popular.
408000	411000	Although, whenever I go into the Young Adult section...
411000	416000	You know, I'll go into the library and check out a book that is in the...
416000	418000	And then there are all these teenagers looking at me like...
419000	423000	And I feel like Amy Poehler in Mean Girls.
423000	426000	I'm like, hey! What's up, homies?
427000	429000	I'm not a regular mom. I'm a cool mom.
429000	431000	Someday I think we need to go to a mall.
431000	434000	I went to the mall the other day and there were teenagers there.
434000	437000	Which surprised me because I didn't know teenagers still went to the mall.
437000	440000	I thought they just kind of stayed inside and played World of Warcraft.
440000	442000	I went to the Queen's Center Mall and it was full of teenagers.
442000	445000	They were all talking about Divergent.
445000	448000	And I was like, they're real.
450000	453000	We should talk to them and see what they like now.
453000	456000	I'm like, do you actually watch MTV?
456000	458000	Because someone has to.
458000	459000	Yeah.
459000	461000	Or, what do you like?
461000	462000	We're so old.
462000	463000	I know!
464000	467000	It's weird to think that I'm in the same generation of these kids.
467000	469000	It's just like, technically we're all millennials.
469000	471000	But I'm just like, I have this old soul I feel in my feet.
471000	473000	I'm like, take antacids now!
474000	475000	Me too.
476000	479000	For Arisen, again, we have some ideas.
479000	482000	Inspired very much by...
482000	483000	Eat, Pray, Love.
483000	484000	Eat, Pray, Love.
484000	488000	Because of course, of course Cthulhu has to leave her.
488000	489000	Of course.
489000	492000	And only this time, you know, she's not going to...
492000	494000	Well, I mean, she'll probably want to kill herself.
496000	498000	She needs to go on an Eat, Pray, Love trip.
498000	499000	Yeah.
499000	500000	So about that show title.
500000	506000	We originally titled the show when we thought the show was going to take a different direction than it did.
506000	514000	So knowing now that, you know, it is going to hinge almost entirely on the Cthulhu Lego brick trilogy.
514000	522000	But also on an expanded goal of exploring what is out there right now.
522000	523000	Yeah.
523000	525000	Try to avoid the Lovecraft or Cthulhu references.
525000	530000	So if you have an idea for what our title could be or should be.
530000	533000	Something that screams, we're reading books.
533000	536000	We're reading books and we're writing about sexy Cthulhu.
536000	539000	Just so damn charming and quirky.
539000	541000	Two ladies and beer, what else?
541000	543000	Literary and drinky.
543000	544000	And we drink a lot.
544000	545000	Yeah.
545000	551000	Because again, with the Fifty Shades, you know, it was inspired by Anna's most of her calories being alcohol calories.
551000	554000	Not that I would know any...
554000	556000	Fucking protein thing about that.
556000	558000	Would a leafy green kill you?
558000	564000	So welcome back to the books and drinking show of indeterminate name.
564000	565000	Season 2.
565000	568000	Rebranding Boogaloo.
568000	573000	We can't wait to get started in earnest on Awoken Book 2 Arisen.
573000	578000	But in the meanwhile, leave your suggestions for stuff we should read in the comments.
578000	584000	We will announce our selections on Twitter based on popularity of the thing suggested.
584000	587000	And also if we are interested in it or not.
587000	590000	We should probably keep track of our progress on Goodreads.
590000	593000	Yeah, we should start a Goodreads account.
593000	594000	Yeah.
594000	596000	We just came up with an idea.
596000	605000	So we look forward to another season of interactive book written debauchery as helped and enabled by you.
605000	606000	And booze.
606000	607000	And also beer.
607000	608000	Cheers.
