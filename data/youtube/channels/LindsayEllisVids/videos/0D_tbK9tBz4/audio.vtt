WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.500
So, we're back, bitches!

00:01.500 --> 00:02.000
Woo!

00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
It's been like some time!

00:03.000 --> 00:03.500
Ah, thank you.

00:03.500 --> 00:04.000
Yeah.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
Pass over that other one.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
This week, it's Omagong three philosphers...

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
...philophethers...

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
...ale, because, um...

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
...'cause...

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
...you know.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
It's good, that's why.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
Cheers!

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
Welcome to the second season of our, uh...

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
...book-themed show...

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
...titled, To Be Decided.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Yes, we decided to move away from the, uh...

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
...Fifty Shades of Green moniker...

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
...mainly because it was really driving me crazy with the, uh...

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
...Google alerts I had...

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
...where it'd be things for, like, gardening.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
So, it's been a while, we had an interesting year...

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
...watching Awoken...

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
...leave the nest...

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
...and, uh...

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
...so now it's time for season two, because obviously...

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
...this being young adult paranormal romance...

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
...you gotta have a...

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
...yeah, it's a trilogy.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Obviously, it's a trilogy.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
But, you know, since we, you know...

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
...we spent so much time last season, like, coming up with our gimmick...

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
...and, you know, talking about, like, who the characters were...

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
...obviously this season it's not going to be that so much...

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
...because we already know who the characters are...

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
...and while we do, of course, need a plot...

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
...um, you know, we know what our gimmick is and all that, so...

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
...this season we're going to expand the reach...

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
...of this show and this channel...

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
...uh, once we decide what it's called.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
And that's where you come in.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
It's not laziness.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
It's not our, uh...

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
...complete dearth of creativity.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
It's just because we love your suggestions...

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
...and it's just more fun than bringing the kids in to play.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
Yeah, since we figured, like, the show was always intended to be interactive...

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
...when we came up with the title, it was inspired by...

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
...Fifty Shades of Grey...

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
...and, uh, now it's kind of turned into...

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
...you know, Fifty Shades of Grey knockoff slash parody...

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
...number 9,007,365.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
So, um, and it's also moved away...

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
...because we initially thought it was going to be more...

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
...along the lines of a Fifty Shades parody...

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
...and it did not turn out to be that, yeah.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
So, yeah, I think we need to move away.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
It went off, did its own thing, and...

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
...we think it's time to pick a name or create a name.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
That more reflects that.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Yeah.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
See, our wall is very much, you know, still alive...

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
...and still very, uh, Cthulhu-inspired.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Why mess with perfection?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Yeah.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
We do need more wall things, though.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
But since we intend to expand our reach...

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
...we might want to expand beyond the world of...

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
...young adult paranormal romance...

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
...as that genre's kind of dead.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Mmm.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
But another thing this season we also wanted...

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
...was not just to create a project...

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
...which obviously we will do, because that's fun...

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
...and people have fun with it.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
And hopefully keep better track of whose idea was what.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Yeah.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Because we were really bad about that.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
You know, it's said that to become a better writer...

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
...you should read a lot.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Mm-hmm.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
Um, so I think to prepare for writing...

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
...the second book of Awoken...

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
...to really grow as writers ourselves...

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
...I think we need to delve deeper into the young adult...

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
...genre, uh, fiction.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Well, not just young adult.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
I think since we'd been knocking around ideas for the sequel...

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
...a lot of those ideas were inspired by, um, you know...

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
...adult books like Pray Love and...

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
I'm really excited about that one.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Yeah.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
And we'll talk about, uh, Awoken Book Two...

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
...uh, which I think should be called Arisen.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
No, of course.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Next week.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
If you guys can come up with something better than Arisen.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
But we're pretty.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Our hearts are pretty set on Arisen.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
So, like, challenge accepted...

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
...but, like, our hearts are really on it being Book Two title.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Yeah.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
Well, I mean, that's the thing with the YA trilogies...

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
...is, like, they're all, like, divergent...

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
...was it insurgent?

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Allegiant?

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
You know, they're, like, all the same word.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Astringent.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Belligerent.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Belligerent.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Like, it's all, they're all the same word.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Frozen.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Frozen.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Yeah, no, Disney took it to Tangled.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Tangled?

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Are you kidding me?

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
In fact, her hair decidedly did not get tangled...

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
...at any point in that friggin' movie.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Like, at least Frozen, like, you know, was in it.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Like, there was no tangling in Tangled.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
No.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
I mean, she has magic hair.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
There's no tangling.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
It was pretty, it was pretty fuckin' well-conditioned, that hair.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
The idea is to make a shaved book club...

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
...with you giving us the suggestions of what should be on our reading list.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
Now, please don't throw us in just totally bad books.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
We like some variety.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
While bad is fun, and, you know, ranting is fun...

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
...I feel like I'm more interested in what people like...

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
...and what people respond to emotionally, personally.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
And also, like, who likes reading shitty books?

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Well, we do, apparently.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Because we read so many bad books last year.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
I don't know if like is the right word.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
I feel like a shitty book kind of drains you more than a shitty movie.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Yeah, it's more of a time.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
There's no 2012 for books.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
No.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Except for maybe The Da Vinci Code.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
So, for books that people are going to suggest to us...

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
...we do have some restrictions.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Let's see.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
One, we can't have read them already.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Because we want our responses to feel fresh.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Yes.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
The next rule is that no Game of Thrones-length books.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
We need to be able to knock this out in two weeks.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Exactly.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
And that's the time frame.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Two weeks, you suggest a book.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Two weeks, we read it.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
We come back with our review of it.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
So, we gotta keep it...

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
What's the page count?

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
I don't know.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Game of Thrones is like 300-some thousand words.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
It's three Twilights.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
No Dostoevsky.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Keep it in your average bestseller range.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Something that won't make my eyes go cross.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
100-150 thousand words.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
No tomes.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
No Lord of the Rings.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Because, you know, we're on a time frame.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
As much as we like long books, but...

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
We do that on our own time.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
That's another great thing about Young Adult.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Short.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
It needs to be a recent title.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Within the last five years.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
I can't think of why we might make an exception, but maybe we will.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Who knows?

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
And keeping it in the theme of our show is that...

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
...since we were inspired by Young Adult and science fiction and fantasy...

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
...we probably want to stick to Young Adult, science fiction, and fantasy.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Not just Young Adult.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
And also I feel like the lines between Young Adult and adult are getting blurred a lot more.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Yeah.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
Trying to market something to broader audiences is much more popular.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Although, whenever I go into the Young Adult section...

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
You know, I'll go into the library and check out a book that is in the...

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
And then there are all these teenagers looking at me like...

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
And I feel like Amy Poehler in Mean Girls.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
I'm like, hey! What's up, homies?

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
I'm not a regular mom. I'm a cool mom.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Someday I think we need to go to a mall.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
I went to the mall the other day and there were teenagers there.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
Which surprised me because I didn't know teenagers still went to the mall.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
I thought they just kind of stayed inside and played World of Warcraft.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
I went to the Queen's Center Mall and it was full of teenagers.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
They were all talking about Divergent.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
And I was like, they're real.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
We should talk to them and see what they like now.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
I'm like, do you actually watch MTV?

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Because someone has to.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Yeah.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Or, what do you like?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
We're so old.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
I know!

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
It's weird to think that I'm in the same generation of these kids.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
It's just like, technically we're all millennials.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
But I'm just like, I have this old soul I feel in my feet.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
I'm like, take antacids now!

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Me too.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
For Arisen, again, we have some ideas.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
Inspired very much by...

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Eat, Pray, Love.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Eat, Pray, Love.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
Because of course, of course Cthulhu has to leave her.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Of course.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
And only this time, you know, she's not going to...

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Well, I mean, she'll probably want to kill herself.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
She needs to go on an Eat, Pray, Love trip.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Yeah.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
So about that show title.

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
We originally titled the show when we thought the show was going to take a different direction than it did.

08:26.000 --> 08:34.000
So knowing now that, you know, it is going to hinge almost entirely on the Cthulhu Lego brick trilogy.

08:34.000 --> 08:42.000
But also on an expanded goal of exploring what is out there right now.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Yeah.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Try to avoid the Lovecraft or Cthulhu references.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
So if you have an idea for what our title could be or should be.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
Something that screams, we're reading books.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
We're reading books and we're writing about sexy Cthulhu.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Just so damn charming and quirky.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Two ladies and beer, what else?

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Literary and drinky.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
And we drink a lot.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Yeah.

09:05.000 --> 09:11.000
Because again, with the Fifty Shades, you know, it was inspired by Anna's most of her calories being alcohol calories.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
Not that I would know any...

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Fucking protein thing about that.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Would a leafy green kill you?

09:18.000 --> 09:24.000
So welcome back to the books and drinking show of indeterminate name.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Season 2.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
Rebranding Boogaloo.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
We can't wait to get started in earnest on Awoken Book 2 Arisen.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
But in the meanwhile, leave your suggestions for stuff we should read in the comments.

09:38.000 --> 09:44.000
We will announce our selections on Twitter based on popularity of the thing suggested.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
And also if we are interested in it or not.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
We should probably keep track of our progress on Goodreads.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
Yeah, we should start a Goodreads account.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Yeah.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
We just came up with an idea.

09:56.000 --> 10:05.000
So we look forward to another season of interactive book written debauchery as helped and enabled by you.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
And booze.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
And also beer.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Cheers.
