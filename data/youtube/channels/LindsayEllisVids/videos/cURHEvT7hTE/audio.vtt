WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.760
Welcome to Sunday Brunch.

00:04.760 --> 00:11.440
Yes, the Sunday Brunch edition of Booze Your Own Adventure, where we'll actually be adventuring,

00:11.440 --> 00:14.040
which we haven't been doing for a little while.

00:14.040 --> 00:15.040
Yeah.

00:15.040 --> 00:16.440
So what are we drinking today, Nella?

00:16.440 --> 00:20.480
Well, because it's Sunday, we're just going to go classic brunch with some Bellinis, which

00:20.480 --> 00:23.560
is peach nectar and sparkling white wine.

00:23.560 --> 00:26.720
And so we're going to be talking about the outline this week, but next week we are going

00:26.720 --> 00:28.360
to have our guest author.

00:28.360 --> 00:33.120
Her name is Lindsay Rebar, and she is the author of The Art of Wishing and The Fourth

00:33.120 --> 00:35.000
Wish.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.560
It's about genies.

00:36.560 --> 00:40.080
So if you want to join us in our discussion of that, make sure you read that before the

00:40.080 --> 00:45.080
next episode, which actually will be out a week from this one-ish, I promise, because

00:45.080 --> 00:46.080
that one's already shot.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.080
I don't have an excuse.

00:47.080 --> 00:55.240
Well, I think at this point, we'll announce on Twitter the release date, so you guys know

00:55.240 --> 00:58.240
our schedule a little better.

00:58.240 --> 00:59.240
We're adults.

00:59.240 --> 01:01.400
We're adults.

01:01.400 --> 01:09.000
So obviously we have the interactive element of our project, where you suggest to us scenes,

01:09.000 --> 01:14.720
tropes, characters, you know, and we have gotten very many, you know, very good ideas.

01:14.720 --> 01:19.600
Uncle Neil, for instance, was one million percent not our brainchild.

01:19.600 --> 01:23.480
He is the gift that keeps on giving, and we thank you for him.

01:23.480 --> 01:28.000
But like as with last time, we went ahead and cobbled together a very, very rough possible

01:28.000 --> 01:31.760
skeleton of an outline.

01:31.760 --> 01:35.760
And so what we're going to do now is kind of explain the skeleton for Viridian Saga

01:35.760 --> 01:36.760
book two.

01:36.760 --> 01:41.200
Okay, so in the broadest of strokes, what is this one going to be a parody of?

01:41.200 --> 01:43.560
Because we're doing dystopia in the third book.

01:43.560 --> 01:44.560
Yeah.

01:44.560 --> 01:53.200
So this one is the parody of New Moon, where our lovebirds have, where everything was perfect,

01:53.200 --> 01:55.360
and then all of a sudden, no, it's not.

01:55.360 --> 02:01.040
And it's that, it's just the continuation, the long drawn out, will they, won't they,

02:01.040 --> 02:02.040
where's he gone.

02:02.040 --> 02:08.440
So if you've read Awoken, it's basically going to be a novel length version of chapter 19.

02:08.440 --> 02:09.440
Yeah.

02:09.440 --> 02:14.680
Except of course, we have to bring in our, the setup of the ethnic third wheel love interest.

02:14.680 --> 02:15.680
Yeah.

02:15.680 --> 02:22.560
And his blossoming powers, which he has due to his, you know, wonderful exotic ethnicness.

02:22.560 --> 02:23.560
Yeah.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.960
As somewhat inspired by Jacob Black.

02:25.960 --> 02:29.560
But also, it's also kind of a dig on things like, well, for one thing, Tiger's Curse,

02:29.560 --> 02:33.160
a book that nobody but us read, but we were just so inspired by.

02:33.160 --> 02:34.160
And we highly recommend.

02:34.160 --> 02:37.160
Oh yeah, that's part of your homework.

02:37.160 --> 02:38.720
That's part of your homework.

02:38.720 --> 02:40.080
Read Tiger's Curse.

02:40.080 --> 02:45.480
Go ahead and throw that poor author a few bones, because, you know, we rag on her so

02:45.480 --> 02:46.480
much.

02:46.480 --> 02:47.480
We could at least give her some money.

02:47.880 --> 02:52.160
And then come back and let's talk about It's-a-Me, Maritzia.

02:52.160 --> 02:53.160
Because that's...

02:53.160 --> 02:54.160
And the guru in the woods!

02:54.160 --> 02:55.520
And the guru in the woods!

02:55.520 --> 03:01.840
With the bath bombs and the copper tub that he has for our white princess in the Mediterranean

03:01.840 --> 03:02.840
Chateau.

03:02.840 --> 03:05.840
So anyway, that's why you have to read it, so we can talk about it more in the comments.

03:05.840 --> 03:09.840
So we're going to watch the movie Eat, Pray, Love for inspiration, not read the books,

03:09.840 --> 03:11.840
because that's what Sarah would do.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.840
So we'll do that at some point within the next...

03:14.200 --> 03:19.480
We really want to play with this whole white person goes to a foreign country to find themselves

03:19.480 --> 03:25.240
and white savior trope, so that's definitely going to be a big part of this that we're

03:25.240 --> 03:27.280
going to be making fun of.

03:27.280 --> 03:29.120
That's our broad strokes idea.

03:29.120 --> 03:31.040
Let's discuss this outline.

03:31.040 --> 03:35.240
So of course the book's got to open with Andi reflecting on how much her life has changed

03:35.240 --> 03:37.320
since she met The One.

03:37.320 --> 03:38.320
Like two weeks ago.

03:38.320 --> 03:43.000
Yeah, and you definitely want to keep the frame very tight.

03:43.160 --> 03:49.040
Of course everything is awesome, life is fantastic, she's best friends with his sister, and it's

03:49.040 --> 03:50.040
only been two weeks.

03:50.040 --> 03:54.640
Yeah, we were like, didn't want it to be such a knockoff of Twilight, but I guess that's

03:54.640 --> 03:56.080
kind of inevitable.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.400
So we were like, what happens?

03:57.400 --> 04:02.000
I guess he like almost like sleep eats her soul or something.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.240
Obviously give us suggestions for what this inciting incident could be to make it maybe

04:06.240 --> 04:08.480
slightly less of a Twilight knockoff, I don't know.

04:08.480 --> 04:13.560
He needs to go find a soul to sate his hunger, and he feels bad, so obviously he's gotta

04:13.560 --> 04:18.520
A. leave her for her own good, and B. go devour her soul somewhere.

04:18.520 --> 04:21.640
No fucks were given that day about the people who were going to die.

04:21.640 --> 04:23.880
She just obviously is just like catatonic.

04:23.880 --> 04:28.160
Yeah, we're definitely not going with the ethical vampires here.

04:28.160 --> 04:31.280
No, he's awful and she's awful, it's awesome.

04:31.280 --> 04:36.120
But he doesn't tell her she's going, he just fucking goes, and I think we had this possible

04:36.120 --> 04:41.520
reveal that he left a note with Uncle Neil who forgot to give it to her or something

04:41.520 --> 04:42.520
like that.

04:42.520 --> 04:46.400
But of course, there's gotta be at least two scenes where it's kind of like, it's right

04:46.400 --> 04:50.920
there, and Neil's like, I had, you know, never mind.

04:50.920 --> 04:55.520
As a side note, with Riley, I'm sort of wondering if, do we even want to try and do the thing

04:55.520 --> 04:59.520
where it's like, well I was going after a wife beater to feed my soul, like it shouldn't

04:59.520 --> 05:00.520
be like, he goes after-

05:00.520 --> 05:01.520
Yeah, that could be interesting.

05:01.520 --> 05:03.600
Well, what do you think?

05:03.600 --> 05:04.600
Should he-

05:05.080 --> 05:07.080
Just be a terrible person who just indiscriminately-

05:07.080 --> 05:10.680
Should he just go after whoever, or should he go after only the bad ones, like Dexter?

05:10.680 --> 05:11.680
Yeah.

05:11.680 --> 05:12.680
You know?

05:12.680 --> 05:16.680
He only eats the souls of serial killers now, he's a reformed eldritch horror.

05:16.680 --> 05:18.680
Like dog kickers.

05:18.680 --> 05:21.680
He's a reformed eldritch horror.

05:21.680 --> 05:28.280
So Vic's relatives come to school and convinces the teacher to take the class to India, cause

05:28.280 --> 05:29.280
why not?

05:29.280 --> 05:31.280
Yeah, and they're in high school, that seems legit.

05:31.280 --> 05:33.040
Yeah, no, it's the big spring break.

05:33.520 --> 05:39.440
I think it should also be like, a little missionary thing as well, like, hey, pay money, let's

05:39.440 --> 05:41.440
go to another country and build houses.

05:41.440 --> 05:44.440
Yeah, yeah, they're like Habitat for Humanity or something.

05:44.440 --> 05:46.440
Let's go dig some holes in the ground.

05:46.440 --> 05:49.440
Already there's too much thought being put into this.

05:49.440 --> 05:54.440
Well I think this fits for Sarah Ellison though, because she comes from a very religious background,

05:54.440 --> 05:57.440
you know in high school she went on a missionary trip.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.440
For the Anaprotestants.

05:58.440 --> 06:00.440
And she just learned so much about herself.

06:00.840 --> 06:04.840
The Anaprotestants go to Dayton, like that's their mission.

06:04.840 --> 06:06.840
She goes from Trotwood to Dayton.

06:06.840 --> 06:08.840
And that's very big exotic.

06:08.840 --> 06:14.840
So they go to India, and that's like, you know, about in the winter, spring break.

06:14.840 --> 06:16.840
Airport of course is right next to the Ganges River.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.840
There are people bathing in it.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.840
So this is where we-

06:23.840 --> 06:27.840
I think we should only call like, Mumbai is just only referred to as Bombay.

06:27.840 --> 06:29.840
Like the whole time.

06:30.240 --> 06:33.240
I feel like maybe some people will try to correct whoever's talking.

06:33.240 --> 06:35.240
And they're like, just kaboosh.

06:35.240 --> 06:37.240
Istanbul is Constantinople.

06:37.240 --> 06:39.240
Uncle Neil also shows up.

06:39.240 --> 06:41.240
We definitely want him driving-

06:41.240 --> 06:43.240
He plows out of the Ganges.

06:43.240 --> 06:45.240
Driving his car out of the Ganges.

06:45.240 --> 06:47.240
Fishing water out of his ear.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.240
What'd I miss? Why are you here?

06:49.240 --> 06:51.240
I forget, there's something I was supposed to tell you.

06:51.240 --> 06:54.240
Yeah, it's like somewhere in the middle he shows up for some reason.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.240
What's the reason, audience?

06:56.240 --> 06:59.240
You would definitely want to crib a little from Transformers.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.640
No, it was that Annie's mom gets high.

07:01.640 --> 07:03.640
Oh yeah!

07:03.640 --> 07:05.640
We need to do some-

07:05.640 --> 07:07.640
Because it's funny.

07:07.640 --> 07:09.640
We need to do some Revenge of the Fallen action.

07:09.640 --> 07:11.640
Mom gets high, I'm-

07:11.640 --> 07:13.640
I don't know, like peace pipe.

07:13.640 --> 07:15.640
It should be a peace pipe or something.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.640
But that's while they're in India.

07:17.640 --> 07:19.640
However, when they first get off the airplane,

07:19.640 --> 07:21.640
and this is where we start getting into Act 2,

07:21.640 --> 07:23.640
a turbaned assassin attacks.

07:23.640 --> 07:25.640
Oh yeah.

07:25.640 --> 07:27.640
Now, here's the thing.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.040
Everyone will always think all this stuff

07:30.040 --> 07:32.040
is for Andy,

07:32.040 --> 07:34.040
but it's actually for Vic.

07:34.040 --> 07:36.040
Yeah, and there's gonna be a big reveal in the middle

07:36.040 --> 07:38.040
that we find out

07:38.040 --> 07:40.040
that Vic is actually-

07:40.040 --> 07:42.040
So things will repeatedly happen.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.040
Yeah.

07:44.040 --> 07:46.040
Things will repeatedly happen.

07:46.040 --> 07:48.040
Andy's like, obviously it's because of me.

07:48.040 --> 07:50.040
So some special things start to happen to Vic.

07:50.040 --> 07:52.040
Like we go to the rat temple,

07:52.040 --> 07:54.040
and all the rats just-

07:54.040 --> 07:56.040
I feel so dirty.

07:56.440 --> 07:58.440
I feel so dirty.

07:58.440 --> 08:00.440
We've gotta be really careful about this.

08:00.440 --> 08:02.440
Yeah, I mean-

08:02.440 --> 08:04.440
This is gonna take a deft hand.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.440
Of course Andy thinks it's all about her,

08:06.440 --> 08:08.440
no it's not.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.440
What we're just gonna have to do is that

08:10.440 --> 08:12.440
in the descriptions, it has to be

08:12.440 --> 08:14.440
what characters say and how things are described.

08:14.440 --> 08:16.440
This is gonna be really hard.

08:16.440 --> 08:18.440
We looked up for the Hindi word

08:18.440 --> 08:20.440
because we were like,

08:20.440 --> 08:22.440
Andy's gotta be the special.

08:22.440 --> 08:24.440
So we looked up the Hindi word

08:24.840 --> 08:26.840
for special, which is

08:26.840 --> 08:28.840
I think the sesa.

08:28.840 --> 08:30.840
I might need to double check

08:30.840 --> 08:32.840
any Hindi or Urdu speakers

08:32.840 --> 08:34.840
on my pronunciation.

08:34.840 --> 08:36.840
I studied Hindi very briefly,

08:36.840 --> 08:38.840
but it was years ago.

08:38.840 --> 08:40.840
I forget things the day after I learn them.

08:40.840 --> 08:42.840
Meanwhile, this is all going on in the background.

08:42.840 --> 08:44.840
Bree is having awesome Indiana Jones adventures.

08:44.840 --> 08:46.840
Pretty much discovering why

08:46.840 --> 08:48.840
Andy can't be the special.

08:48.840 --> 08:50.840
She's like, I don't think it's you.

08:50.840 --> 08:52.840
It said it had to be someone that was like,

08:52.840 --> 08:54.840
I'm from this land.

08:54.840 --> 08:56.840
They meet multiple Maharajas.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.840
Every town has a Maharaj.

08:58.840 --> 09:00.840
And in the midpoint,

09:00.840 --> 09:02.840
we reveal that Vic is the special

09:02.840 --> 09:04.840
and has been the whole time.

09:04.840 --> 09:06.840
Somehow or other, this ties in with

09:06.840 --> 09:08.840
Cthulhu lore somehow.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.840
75% into this story,

09:10.840 --> 09:12.840
Riley has to come back.

09:12.840 --> 09:14.840
We have to have the scene where

09:14.840 --> 09:16.840
Andy almost kisses Vic.

09:16.840 --> 09:18.840
I don't know, magical starlit night.

09:18.840 --> 09:20.840
Or maybe he's

09:20.840 --> 09:22.840
tapped into his

09:22.840 --> 09:24.840
special powers.

09:24.840 --> 09:26.840
And she cannot

09:26.840 --> 09:28.840
resist them. She just has a thing

09:28.840 --> 09:30.840
for avatars.

09:30.840 --> 09:32.840
I'm imagining

09:32.840 --> 09:34.840
a big Bollywood wedding

09:34.840 --> 09:36.840
that they just get invited to.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.840
That would be kind of awesome.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.840
There's a single

09:40.840 --> 09:42.840
red rose.

09:46.840 --> 09:48.840
It shouldn't even come to a kiss.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.840
Just be like, he caresses her with a red rose

09:50.840 --> 09:52.840
and then Riley shows up.

09:52.840 --> 09:54.840
He knows exactly what that means.

09:54.840 --> 09:56.840
He's seen Cholet.

09:56.840 --> 09:58.840
He knows what's up.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.840
I don't think the rose was in Cholet.

10:00.840 --> 10:02.840
Riley hurts Vic.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.840
Or Vic's powered now and is actually

10:04.840 --> 10:06.840
a match for Riley.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.840
And Andy's like, say.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.840
Because wasn't the

10:10.840 --> 10:12.840
idea behind the special going to be

10:12.840 --> 10:14.840
turns out he is in fact

10:14.840 --> 10:16.840
the 10th avatar of Vishnu.

10:16.840 --> 10:18.840
Kalki, who

10:18.840 --> 10:20.840
is destined to bring

10:20.840 --> 10:22.840
an end to this world and a beginning to the next.

10:22.840 --> 10:24.840
And only she can stop him.

10:24.840 --> 10:26.840
Obviously.

10:26.840 --> 10:28.840
Maybe this is her destiny all along.

10:28.840 --> 10:30.840
She's the heart of Vishnu.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.840
She's the only one

10:34.840 --> 10:36.840
who can never stop anyone.

10:36.840 --> 10:38.840
She's the heart of everything.

10:38.840 --> 10:40.840
But she just doesn't listen.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.840
Why would you leave me?

10:42.840 --> 10:44.840
I feel so scorned.

10:44.840 --> 10:46.840
And now she understands.

10:46.840 --> 10:48.840
She thinks about Scarlet.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.840
And wonders

10:50.840 --> 10:52.840
if this was the scorn.

10:52.840 --> 10:54.840
Could I turn out like her?

10:54.840 --> 10:56.840
Now that I've been scorned.

10:56.840 --> 10:58.840
So that's our end of act two.

10:58.840 --> 11:00.840
And Vic gets kidnapped

11:00.840 --> 11:02.840
by...

11:02.840 --> 11:04.840
So this is our bad guy.

11:04.840 --> 11:06.840
So who's our bad guy, Lindsay?

11:06.840 --> 11:08.840
Oh yeah.

11:08.840 --> 11:10.840
Wasn't it Loki?

11:10.840 --> 11:12.840
Oh yeah.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.840
Kidnapped by Loki

11:14.840 --> 11:16.840
in Guise of Indian God.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.840
And I would honestly

11:18.840 --> 11:20.840
at this point say how drunk were we when we realized

11:20.840 --> 11:22.840
but I know we were fat.

11:22.840 --> 11:24.840
We were at a tea place with Lisa

11:24.840 --> 11:26.840
who is super pregnant and therefore can't drink.

11:26.840 --> 11:28.840
So we were so sober.

11:28.840 --> 11:30.840
Sober cracked out.

11:30.840 --> 11:32.840
Which is great.

11:32.840 --> 11:34.840
My thought about Loki was that it's

11:34.840 --> 11:36.840
just like Tom Hiddleston.

11:36.840 --> 11:38.840
Word for word he keeps quoting

11:38.840 --> 11:40.840
the movies or skirting the

11:40.840 --> 11:42.840
copyright of quoting the movies.

11:42.840 --> 11:44.840
And it's awesome.

11:44.840 --> 11:46.840
That's all Sarah really knows

11:46.840 --> 11:48.840
about Norse mythology.

11:48.840 --> 11:50.840
Anyway, so Vic gets

11:50.840 --> 11:52.840
kidnapped and then Riley doesn't want to help

11:52.840 --> 11:54.840
even though it would be saving the world.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.840
So Andi's on her own. Of course with Bri.

11:56.840 --> 11:58.840
Yeah, we need to find a way to make

11:58.840 --> 12:00.840
Riley suck less

12:00.840 --> 12:02.840
than he is in this outline.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.840
I mean like he sucks

12:04.840 --> 12:06.840
but he needs to be kind of like

12:06.840 --> 12:08.840
an alluring kind of suck.

12:08.840 --> 12:10.840
Like if you were writing

12:10.840 --> 12:12.840
an asshole that also still

12:12.840 --> 12:14.840
Like a Christian Grey type who sucks

12:14.840 --> 12:16.840
that the readers like for some

12:16.840 --> 12:18.840
unfettered reason.

12:18.840 --> 12:20.840
You know how everyone will be like, but by the end of the book

12:20.840 --> 12:22.840
she really sort of comes into

12:22.840 --> 12:24.840
her own and she's not getting pushed around

12:24.840 --> 12:26.840
anymore.

12:26.840 --> 12:28.840
That's exactly what's happening

12:28.840 --> 12:30.840
by the third of those books.

12:30.840 --> 12:32.840
Since it is Loki, we do learn that Vic

12:32.840 --> 12:34.840
is in fact not the 10th Avatar Vishnu

12:34.840 --> 12:36.840
but some Nordic

12:36.840 --> 12:38.840
the special. Like he's actually

12:38.840 --> 12:40.840
the Nordic special and it's not gonna be

12:40.840 --> 12:42.840
the Hindu version

12:42.840 --> 12:44.840
of the end of this world

12:44.840 --> 12:46.840
but the Nordic Ragnarok

12:46.840 --> 12:48.840
which is basically the same thing.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.840
I mean it's the same but not.

12:50.840 --> 12:52.840
You know obviously details differ.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.840
But the whole vague like this world is ending

12:54.840 --> 12:56.840
and a new one's gonna begin. One world ends in fire

12:56.840 --> 12:58.840
and the other ends in ice.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.840
In Hinduism it's

13:00.840 --> 13:02.840
the end of the world

13:02.840 --> 13:04.840
is considered a good thing

13:04.840 --> 13:06.840
because this world

13:06.840 --> 13:08.840
I forget the word for it but it basically means

13:08.840 --> 13:10.840
dark times. It's like Kali something.

13:10.840 --> 13:12.840
And it's like

13:12.840 --> 13:14.840
this world sucks but then the

13:14.840 --> 13:16.840
10th Avatar Vishnu's gonna come and make

13:16.840 --> 13:18.840
this world end and then we're gonna have a good age

13:18.840 --> 13:20.840
and it's gonna be like the fun awesome age

13:20.840 --> 13:22.840
that sucks considerably less than this age

13:22.840 --> 13:24.840
does and we live in the age of suck.

13:24.840 --> 13:26.840
And I know I'm doing

13:26.840 --> 13:28.840
complete justice to this

13:28.840 --> 13:30.840
really in-depth

13:30.840 --> 13:32.840
proud history

13:32.840 --> 13:34.840
and deeply religious

13:34.840 --> 13:36.840
concept. The age of suck

13:36.840 --> 13:38.840
is what it's

13:38.840 --> 13:40.840
official term in Hindi.

13:40.840 --> 13:42.840
And the ending is

13:42.840 --> 13:44.840
basically that.

13:44.840 --> 13:46.840
The world doesn't end. It is reborn

13:46.840 --> 13:48.840
in fact. Surprise.

13:48.840 --> 13:50.840
And there's no Thursdays.

13:50.840 --> 13:52.840
That was gonna be a joke. No more Thors

13:52.840 --> 13:54.840
days. But also

13:54.840 --> 13:56.840
it ends with there is

13:56.840 --> 13:58.840
not only a dystopia in this

13:58.840 --> 14:00.840
new horrible changed world but also a matriarchy

14:00.840 --> 14:02.840
and only our heroes

14:02.840 --> 14:04.840
have any memory of the way things

14:04.840 --> 14:06.840
should be.

14:06.840 --> 14:08.840
And so we're thinking this one's gonna end on

14:08.840 --> 14:10.840
a cliffhanger. So that is our very

14:10.840 --> 14:12.840
very very loose

14:12.840 --> 14:14.840
skeleton. Obviously there are a lot of holes

14:14.840 --> 14:16.840
that need filling in in our plot.

14:16.840 --> 14:18.840
And also

14:18.840 --> 14:20.840
what would you like to see parodied

14:20.840 --> 14:22.840
in this one that we haven't touched upon yet?

14:22.840 --> 14:24.840
Obviously we talk, we dig a lot

14:24.840 --> 14:26.840
on things like pray love tiger's curse

14:26.840 --> 14:28.840
and new moon and hinting

14:28.840 --> 14:30.840
at things like divergent

14:30.840 --> 14:32.840
which will obviously come in a third book. But what else?

14:32.840 --> 14:34.840
Hannah Jones. Of course Transformers

14:34.840 --> 14:36.840
Revenge of the Fallen. Yes.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.840
The greatest sequel of all time.

14:38.840 --> 14:40.840
She hasn't finished it.

14:40.840 --> 14:42.840
It got like 40 minutes in.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.840
We tried once.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.840
So leave your comments.

14:46.840 --> 14:48.840
Give us your suggestions.

14:48.840 --> 14:50.840
We talk not only about plot points but also

14:50.840 --> 14:52.840
new characters, new

14:52.840 --> 14:54.840
faces. Obviously Neil

14:54.840 --> 14:56.840
kind of takes up all of the awesome for the book

14:56.840 --> 14:58.840
but we'd be interested to see if

14:58.840 --> 15:00.840
there are any others. I think we need a

15:00.840 --> 15:02.840
Maharaja guru.

15:02.840 --> 15:04.840
It should be like he's a Maharaja

15:04.840 --> 15:06.840
but he's a guru.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.840
This is a character that keeps popping up throughout

15:08.840 --> 15:10.840
the book. It's like I thought you were a Maharaja. Yeah I'm also

15:10.840 --> 15:12.840
a guru. As always leave your

15:12.840 --> 15:14.840
suggestions, comments

15:14.840 --> 15:16.840
and warnings

15:16.840 --> 15:18.840
on

15:18.840 --> 15:20.840
SheaApocalypse.com where we read

15:20.840 --> 15:22.840
the comments. Also be sure to tweet at us and

15:22.840 --> 15:24.840
follow us at SheaApocalypse.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.840
And remember

15:26.840 --> 15:28.840
next week

15:28.840 --> 15:30.840
we are going to be doing our first author interview.

15:30.840 --> 15:32.840
Lisa is going to be filling in for

15:32.840 --> 15:34.840
Nella. I will not be here.

15:34.840 --> 15:36.840
The week after that is going to be

15:36.840 --> 15:38.840
another review. We are going to

15:38.840 --> 15:40.840
review John Scalzi's new book

15:40.840 --> 15:42.840
which you can't read

15:42.840 --> 15:44.840
because it's not out yet.

15:44.840 --> 15:46.840
So we're going to review a thing before

15:46.840 --> 15:48.840
it comes out. Go team.

15:48.840 --> 15:50.840
Exciting. Yay.

15:50.840 --> 15:52.840
You know that life, it sure does happen

15:52.840 --> 15:54.840
doesn't it Lindsay? And again

15:54.840 --> 15:56.840
we are very sorry at our inability

15:56.840 --> 15:58.840
to keep to a schedule. Summer is

15:58.840 --> 16:00.840
difficult because we are basically not

16:00.840 --> 16:02.840
here during the weekends. We're here to shoot an edit.

16:02.840 --> 16:04.840
Damn day jobs

16:04.840 --> 16:06.840
slash ponds. I haven't even been to the beach yet.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.840
I know. I have not been

16:08.840 --> 16:10.840
near a body of water and we live literally

16:10.840 --> 16:12.840
by the ocean. Yeah.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.840
Our lives are hard. Our lives are really

16:14.840 --> 16:16.840
hard. It's so hard.

16:16.840 --> 16:18.840
It's just so freaking hard.

16:22.840 --> 16:24.840
.
