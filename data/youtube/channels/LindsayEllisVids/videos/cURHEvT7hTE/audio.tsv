0	4760	Welcome to Sunday Brunch.
4760	11440	Yes, the Sunday Brunch edition of Booze Your Own Adventure, where we'll actually be adventuring,
11440	14040	which we haven't been doing for a little while.
14040	15040	Yeah.
15040	16440	So what are we drinking today, Nella?
16440	20480	Well, because it's Sunday, we're just going to go classic brunch with some Bellinis, which
20480	23560	is peach nectar and sparkling white wine.
23560	26720	And so we're going to be talking about the outline this week, but next week we are going
26720	28360	to have our guest author.
28360	33120	Her name is Lindsay Rebar, and she is the author of The Art of Wishing and The Fourth
33120	35000	Wish.
35000	36560	It's about genies.
36560	40080	So if you want to join us in our discussion of that, make sure you read that before the
40080	45080	next episode, which actually will be out a week from this one-ish, I promise, because
45080	46080	that one's already shot.
46080	47080	I don't have an excuse.
47080	55240	Well, I think at this point, we'll announce on Twitter the release date, so you guys know
55240	58240	our schedule a little better.
58240	59240	We're adults.
59240	61400	We're adults.
61400	69000	So obviously we have the interactive element of our project, where you suggest to us scenes,
69000	74720	tropes, characters, you know, and we have gotten very many, you know, very good ideas.
74720	79600	Uncle Neil, for instance, was one million percent not our brainchild.
79600	83480	He is the gift that keeps on giving, and we thank you for him.
83480	88000	But like as with last time, we went ahead and cobbled together a very, very rough possible
88000	91760	skeleton of an outline.
91760	95760	And so what we're going to do now is kind of explain the skeleton for Viridian Saga
95760	96760	book two.
96760	101200	Okay, so in the broadest of strokes, what is this one going to be a parody of?
101200	103560	Because we're doing dystopia in the third book.
103560	104560	Yeah.
104560	113200	So this one is the parody of New Moon, where our lovebirds have, where everything was perfect,
113200	115360	and then all of a sudden, no, it's not.
115360	121040	And it's that, it's just the continuation, the long drawn out, will they, won't they,
121040	122040	where's he gone.
122040	128440	So if you've read Awoken, it's basically going to be a novel length version of chapter 19.
128440	129440	Yeah.
129440	134680	Except of course, we have to bring in our, the setup of the ethnic third wheel love interest.
134680	135680	Yeah.
135680	142560	And his blossoming powers, which he has due to his, you know, wonderful exotic ethnicness.
142560	143560	Yeah.
143560	145960	As somewhat inspired by Jacob Black.
145960	149560	But also, it's also kind of a dig on things like, well, for one thing, Tiger's Curse,
149560	153160	a book that nobody but us read, but we were just so inspired by.
153160	154160	And we highly recommend.
154160	157160	Oh yeah, that's part of your homework.
157160	158720	That's part of your homework.
158720	160080	Read Tiger's Curse.
160080	165480	Go ahead and throw that poor author a few bones, because, you know, we rag on her so
165480	166480	much.
166480	167480	We could at least give her some money.
167880	172160	And then come back and let's talk about It's-a-Me, Maritzia.
172160	173160	Because that's...
173160	174160	And the guru in the woods!
174160	175520	And the guru in the woods!
175520	181840	With the bath bombs and the copper tub that he has for our white princess in the Mediterranean
181840	182840	Chateau.
182840	185840	So anyway, that's why you have to read it, so we can talk about it more in the comments.
185840	189840	So we're going to watch the movie Eat, Pray, Love for inspiration, not read the books,
189840	191840	because that's what Sarah would do.
191840	193840	So we'll do that at some point within the next...
194200	199480	We really want to play with this whole white person goes to a foreign country to find themselves
199480	205240	and white savior trope, so that's definitely going to be a big part of this that we're
205240	207280	going to be making fun of.
207280	209120	That's our broad strokes idea.
209120	211040	Let's discuss this outline.
211040	215240	So of course the book's got to open with Andi reflecting on how much her life has changed
215240	217320	since she met The One.
217320	218320	Like two weeks ago.
218320	223000	Yeah, and you definitely want to keep the frame very tight.
223160	229040	Of course everything is awesome, life is fantastic, she's best friends with his sister, and it's
229040	230040	only been two weeks.
230040	234640	Yeah, we were like, didn't want it to be such a knockoff of Twilight, but I guess that's
234640	236080	kind of inevitable.
236080	237400	So we were like, what happens?
237400	242000	I guess he like almost like sleep eats her soul or something.
242000	246240	Obviously give us suggestions for what this inciting incident could be to make it maybe
246240	248480	slightly less of a Twilight knockoff, I don't know.
248480	253560	He needs to go find a soul to sate his hunger, and he feels bad, so obviously he's gotta
253560	258520	A. leave her for her own good, and B. go devour her soul somewhere.
258520	261640	No fucks were given that day about the people who were going to die.
261640	263880	She just obviously is just like catatonic.
263880	268160	Yeah, we're definitely not going with the ethical vampires here.
268160	271280	No, he's awful and she's awful, it's awesome.
271280	276120	But he doesn't tell her she's going, he just fucking goes, and I think we had this possible
276120	281520	reveal that he left a note with Uncle Neil who forgot to give it to her or something
281520	282520	like that.
282520	286400	But of course, there's gotta be at least two scenes where it's kind of like, it's right
286400	290920	there, and Neil's like, I had, you know, never mind.
290920	295520	As a side note, with Riley, I'm sort of wondering if, do we even want to try and do the thing
295520	299520	where it's like, well I was going after a wife beater to feed my soul, like it shouldn't
299520	300520	be like, he goes after-
300520	301520	Yeah, that could be interesting.
301520	303600	Well, what do you think?
303600	304600	Should he-
305080	307080	Just be a terrible person who just indiscriminately-
307080	310680	Should he just go after whoever, or should he go after only the bad ones, like Dexter?
310680	311680	Yeah.
311680	312680	You know?
312680	316680	He only eats the souls of serial killers now, he's a reformed eldritch horror.
316680	318680	Like dog kickers.
318680	321680	He's a reformed eldritch horror.
321680	328280	So Vic's relatives come to school and convinces the teacher to take the class to India, cause
328280	329280	why not?
329280	331280	Yeah, and they're in high school, that seems legit.
331280	333040	Yeah, no, it's the big spring break.
333520	339440	I think it should also be like, a little missionary thing as well, like, hey, pay money, let's
339440	341440	go to another country and build houses.
341440	344440	Yeah, yeah, they're like Habitat for Humanity or something.
344440	346440	Let's go dig some holes in the ground.
346440	349440	Already there's too much thought being put into this.
349440	354440	Well I think this fits for Sarah Ellison though, because she comes from a very religious background,
354440	357440	you know in high school she went on a missionary trip.
357440	358440	For the Anaprotestants.
358440	360440	And she just learned so much about herself.
360840	364840	The Anaprotestants go to Dayton, like that's their mission.
364840	366840	She goes from Trotwood to Dayton.
366840	368840	And that's very big exotic.
368840	374840	So they go to India, and that's like, you know, about in the winter, spring break.
374840	376840	Airport of course is right next to the Ganges River.
376840	378840	There are people bathing in it.
381840	383840	So this is where we-
383840	387840	I think we should only call like, Mumbai is just only referred to as Bombay.
387840	389840	Like the whole time.
390240	393240	I feel like maybe some people will try to correct whoever's talking.
393240	395240	And they're like, just kaboosh.
395240	397240	Istanbul is Constantinople.
397240	399240	Uncle Neil also shows up.
399240	401240	We definitely want him driving-
401240	403240	He plows out of the Ganges.
403240	405240	Driving his car out of the Ganges.
405240	407240	Fishing water out of his ear.
407240	409240	What'd I miss? Why are you here?
409240	411240	I forget, there's something I was supposed to tell you.
411240	414240	Yeah, it's like somewhere in the middle he shows up for some reason.
414240	416240	What's the reason, audience?
416240	419240	You would definitely want to crib a little from Transformers.
419640	421640	No, it was that Annie's mom gets high.
421640	423640	Oh yeah!
423640	425640	We need to do some-
425640	427640	Because it's funny.
427640	429640	We need to do some Revenge of the Fallen action.
429640	431640	Mom gets high, I'm-
431640	433640	I don't know, like peace pipe.
433640	435640	It should be a peace pipe or something.
435640	437640	But that's while they're in India.
437640	439640	However, when they first get off the airplane,
439640	441640	and this is where we start getting into Act 2,
441640	443640	a turbaned assassin attacks.
443640	445640	Oh yeah.
445640	447640	Now, here's the thing.
448040	450040	Everyone will always think all this stuff
450040	452040	is for Andy,
452040	454040	but it's actually for Vic.
454040	456040	Yeah, and there's gonna be a big reveal in the middle
456040	458040	that we find out
458040	460040	that Vic is actually-
460040	462040	So things will repeatedly happen.
462040	464040	Yeah.
464040	466040	Things will repeatedly happen.
466040	468040	Andy's like, obviously it's because of me.
468040	470040	So some special things start to happen to Vic.
470040	472040	Like we go to the rat temple,
472040	474040	and all the rats just-
474040	476040	I feel so dirty.
476440	478440	I feel so dirty.
478440	480440	We've gotta be really careful about this.
480440	482440	Yeah, I mean-
482440	484440	This is gonna take a deft hand.
484440	486440	Of course Andy thinks it's all about her,
486440	488440	no it's not.
488440	490440	What we're just gonna have to do is that
490440	492440	in the descriptions, it has to be
492440	494440	what characters say and how things are described.
494440	496440	This is gonna be really hard.
496440	498440	We looked up for the Hindi word
498440	500440	because we were like,
500440	502440	Andy's gotta be the special.
502440	504440	So we looked up the Hindi word
504840	506840	for special, which is
506840	508840	I think the sesa.
508840	510840	I might need to double check
510840	512840	any Hindi or Urdu speakers
512840	514840	on my pronunciation.
514840	516840	I studied Hindi very briefly,
516840	518840	but it was years ago.
518840	520840	I forget things the day after I learn them.
520840	522840	Meanwhile, this is all going on in the background.
522840	524840	Bree is having awesome Indiana Jones adventures.
524840	526840	Pretty much discovering why
526840	528840	Andy can't be the special.
528840	530840	She's like, I don't think it's you.
530840	532840	It said it had to be someone that was like,
532840	534840	I'm from this land.
534840	536840	They meet multiple Maharajas.
536840	538840	Every town has a Maharaj.
538840	540840	And in the midpoint,
540840	542840	we reveal that Vic is the special
542840	544840	and has been the whole time.
544840	546840	Somehow or other, this ties in with
546840	548840	Cthulhu lore somehow.
548840	550840	75% into this story,
550840	552840	Riley has to come back.
552840	554840	We have to have the scene where
554840	556840	Andy almost kisses Vic.
556840	558840	I don't know, magical starlit night.
558840	560840	Or maybe he's
560840	562840	tapped into his
562840	564840	special powers.
564840	566840	And she cannot
566840	568840	resist them. She just has a thing
568840	570840	for avatars.
570840	572840	I'm imagining
572840	574840	a big Bollywood wedding
574840	576840	that they just get invited to.
576840	578840	That would be kind of awesome.
578840	580840	There's a single
580840	582840	red rose.
586840	588840	It shouldn't even come to a kiss.
588840	590840	Just be like, he caresses her with a red rose
590840	592840	and then Riley shows up.
592840	594840	He knows exactly what that means.
594840	596840	He's seen Cholet.
596840	598840	He knows what's up.
598840	600840	I don't think the rose was in Cholet.
600840	602840	Riley hurts Vic.
602840	604840	Or Vic's powered now and is actually
604840	606840	a match for Riley.
606840	608840	And Andy's like, say.
608840	610840	Because wasn't the
610840	612840	idea behind the special going to be
612840	614840	turns out he is in fact
614840	616840	the 10th avatar of Vishnu.
616840	618840	Kalki, who
618840	620840	is destined to bring
620840	622840	an end to this world and a beginning to the next.
622840	624840	And only she can stop him.
624840	626840	Obviously.
626840	628840	Maybe this is her destiny all along.
628840	630840	She's the heart of Vishnu.
632840	634840	She's the only one
634840	636840	who can never stop anyone.
636840	638840	She's the heart of everything.
638840	640840	But she just doesn't listen.
640840	642840	Why would you leave me?
642840	644840	I feel so scorned.
644840	646840	And now she understands.
646840	648840	She thinks about Scarlet.
648840	650840	And wonders
650840	652840	if this was the scorn.
652840	654840	Could I turn out like her?
654840	656840	Now that I've been scorned.
656840	658840	So that's our end of act two.
658840	660840	And Vic gets kidnapped
660840	662840	by...
662840	664840	So this is our bad guy.
664840	666840	So who's our bad guy, Lindsay?
666840	668840	Oh yeah.
668840	670840	Wasn't it Loki?
670840	672840	Oh yeah.
672840	674840	Kidnapped by Loki
674840	676840	in Guise of Indian God.
676840	678840	And I would honestly
678840	680840	at this point say how drunk were we when we realized
680840	682840	but I know we were fat.
682840	684840	We were at a tea place with Lisa
684840	686840	who is super pregnant and therefore can't drink.
686840	688840	So we were so sober.
688840	690840	Sober cracked out.
690840	692840	Which is great.
692840	694840	My thought about Loki was that it's
694840	696840	just like Tom Hiddleston.
696840	698840	Word for word he keeps quoting
698840	700840	the movies or skirting the
700840	702840	copyright of quoting the movies.
702840	704840	And it's awesome.
704840	706840	That's all Sarah really knows
706840	708840	about Norse mythology.
708840	710840	Anyway, so Vic gets
710840	712840	kidnapped and then Riley doesn't want to help
712840	714840	even though it would be saving the world.
714840	716840	So Andi's on her own. Of course with Bri.
716840	718840	Yeah, we need to find a way to make
718840	720840	Riley suck less
720840	722840	than he is in this outline.
722840	724840	I mean like he sucks
724840	726840	but he needs to be kind of like
726840	728840	an alluring kind of suck.
728840	730840	Like if you were writing
730840	732840	an asshole that also still
732840	734840	Like a Christian Grey type who sucks
734840	736840	that the readers like for some
736840	738840	unfettered reason.
738840	740840	You know how everyone will be like, but by the end of the book
740840	742840	she really sort of comes into
742840	744840	her own and she's not getting pushed around
744840	746840	anymore.
746840	748840	That's exactly what's happening
748840	750840	by the third of those books.
750840	752840	Since it is Loki, we do learn that Vic
752840	754840	is in fact not the 10th Avatar Vishnu
754840	756840	but some Nordic
756840	758840	the special. Like he's actually
758840	760840	the Nordic special and it's not gonna be
760840	762840	the Hindu version
762840	764840	of the end of this world
764840	766840	but the Nordic Ragnarok
766840	768840	which is basically the same thing.
768840	770840	I mean it's the same but not.
770840	772840	You know obviously details differ.
772840	774840	But the whole vague like this world is ending
774840	776840	and a new one's gonna begin. One world ends in fire
776840	778840	and the other ends in ice.
778840	780840	In Hinduism it's
780840	782840	the end of the world
782840	784840	is considered a good thing
784840	786840	because this world
786840	788840	I forget the word for it but it basically means
788840	790840	dark times. It's like Kali something.
790840	792840	And it's like
792840	794840	this world sucks but then the
794840	796840	10th Avatar Vishnu's gonna come and make
796840	798840	this world end and then we're gonna have a good age
798840	800840	and it's gonna be like the fun awesome age
800840	802840	that sucks considerably less than this age
802840	804840	does and we live in the age of suck.
804840	806840	And I know I'm doing
806840	808840	complete justice to this
808840	810840	really in-depth
810840	812840	proud history
812840	814840	and deeply religious
814840	816840	concept. The age of suck
816840	818840	is what it's
818840	820840	official term in Hindi.
820840	822840	And the ending is
822840	824840	basically that.
824840	826840	The world doesn't end. It is reborn
826840	828840	in fact. Surprise.
828840	830840	And there's no Thursdays.
830840	832840	That was gonna be a joke. No more Thors
832840	834840	days. But also
834840	836840	it ends with there is
836840	838840	not only a dystopia in this
838840	840840	new horrible changed world but also a matriarchy
840840	842840	and only our heroes
842840	844840	have any memory of the way things
844840	846840	should be.
846840	848840	And so we're thinking this one's gonna end on
848840	850840	a cliffhanger. So that is our very
850840	852840	very very loose
852840	854840	skeleton. Obviously there are a lot of holes
854840	856840	that need filling in in our plot.
856840	858840	And also
858840	860840	what would you like to see parodied
860840	862840	in this one that we haven't touched upon yet?
862840	864840	Obviously we talk, we dig a lot
864840	866840	on things like pray love tiger's curse
866840	868840	and new moon and hinting
868840	870840	at things like divergent
870840	872840	which will obviously come in a third book. But what else?
872840	874840	Hannah Jones. Of course Transformers
874840	876840	Revenge of the Fallen. Yes.
876840	878840	The greatest sequel of all time.
878840	880840	She hasn't finished it.
880840	882840	It got like 40 minutes in.
882840	884840	We tried once.
884840	886840	So leave your comments.
886840	888840	Give us your suggestions.
888840	890840	We talk not only about plot points but also
890840	892840	new characters, new
892840	894840	faces. Obviously Neil
894840	896840	kind of takes up all of the awesome for the book
896840	898840	but we'd be interested to see if
898840	900840	there are any others. I think we need a
900840	902840	Maharaja guru.
902840	904840	It should be like he's a Maharaja
904840	906840	but he's a guru.
906840	908840	This is a character that keeps popping up throughout
908840	910840	the book. It's like I thought you were a Maharaja. Yeah I'm also
910840	912840	a guru. As always leave your
912840	914840	suggestions, comments
914840	916840	and warnings
916840	918840	on
918840	920840	SheaApocalypse.com where we read
920840	922840	the comments. Also be sure to tweet at us and
922840	924840	follow us at SheaApocalypse.
924840	926840	And remember
926840	928840	next week
928840	930840	we are going to be doing our first author interview.
930840	932840	Lisa is going to be filling in for
932840	934840	Nella. I will not be here.
934840	936840	The week after that is going to be
936840	938840	another review. We are going to
938840	940840	review John Scalzi's new book
940840	942840	which you can't read
942840	944840	because it's not out yet.
944840	946840	So we're going to review a thing before
946840	948840	it comes out. Go team.
948840	950840	Exciting. Yay.
950840	952840	You know that life, it sure does happen
952840	954840	doesn't it Lindsay? And again
954840	956840	we are very sorry at our inability
956840	958840	to keep to a schedule. Summer is
958840	960840	difficult because we are basically not
960840	962840	here during the weekends. We're here to shoot an edit.
962840	964840	Damn day jobs
964840	966840	slash ponds. I haven't even been to the beach yet.
966840	968840	I know. I have not been
968840	970840	near a body of water and we live literally
970840	972840	by the ocean. Yeah.
972840	974840	Our lives are hard. Our lives are really
974840	976840	hard. It's so hard.
976840	978840	It's just so freaking hard.
982840	984840	.
