1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Welcome to Sunday Brunch.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:11,440
Yes, the Sunday Brunch edition of Booze Your Own Adventure, where we'll actually be adventuring,

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,040
which we haven't been doing for a little while.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,040
Yeah.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,440
So what are we drinking today, Nella?

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,480
Well, because it's Sunday, we're just going to go classic brunch with some Bellinis, which

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,560
is peach nectar and sparkling white wine.

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,720
And so we're going to be talking about the outline this week, but next week we are going

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,360
to have our guest author.

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,120
Her name is Lindsay Rebar, and she is the author of The Art of Wishing and The Fourth

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,000
Wish.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,560
It's about genies.

13
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,080
So if you want to join us in our discussion of that, make sure you read that before the

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,080
next episode, which actually will be out a week from this one-ish, I promise, because

15
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,080
that one's already shot.

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,080
I don't have an excuse.

17
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:55,240
Well, I think at this point, we'll announce on Twitter the release date, so you guys know

18
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,240
our schedule a little better.

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,240
We're adults.

20
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,400
We're adults.

21
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:09,000
So obviously we have the interactive element of our project, where you suggest to us scenes,

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,720
tropes, characters, you know, and we have gotten very many, you know, very good ideas.

23
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,600
Uncle Neil, for instance, was one million percent not our brainchild.

24
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,480
He is the gift that keeps on giving, and we thank you for him.

25
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,000
But like as with last time, we went ahead and cobbled together a very, very rough possible

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,760
skeleton of an outline.

27
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,760
And so what we're going to do now is kind of explain the skeleton for Viridian Saga

28
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,760
book two.

29
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,200
Okay, so in the broadest of strokes, what is this one going to be a parody of?

30
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,560
Because we're doing dystopia in the third book.

31
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,560
Yeah.

32
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:53,200
So this one is the parody of New Moon, where our lovebirds have, where everything was perfect,

33
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,360
and then all of a sudden, no, it's not.

34
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,040
And it's that, it's just the continuation, the long drawn out, will they, won't they,

35
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040
where's he gone.

36
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,440
So if you've read Awoken, it's basically going to be a novel length version of chapter 19.

37
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,440
Yeah.

38
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,680
Except of course, we have to bring in our, the setup of the ethnic third wheel love interest.

39
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,680
Yeah.

40
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,560
And his blossoming powers, which he has due to his, you know, wonderful exotic ethnicness.

41
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,560
Yeah.

42
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,960
As somewhat inspired by Jacob Black.

43
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,560
But also, it's also kind of a dig on things like, well, for one thing, Tiger's Curse,

44
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,160
a book that nobody but us read, but we were just so inspired by.

45
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,160
And we highly recommend.

46
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,160
Oh yeah, that's part of your homework.

47
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,720
That's part of your homework.

48
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,080
Read Tiger's Curse.

49
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,480
Go ahead and throw that poor author a few bones, because, you know, we rag on her so

50
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,480
much.

51
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,480
We could at least give her some money.

52
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,160
And then come back and let's talk about It's-a-Me, Maritzia.

53
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,160
Because that's...

54
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,160
And the guru in the woods!

55
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,520
And the guru in the woods!

56
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:01,840
With the bath bombs and the copper tub that he has for our white princess in the Mediterranean

57
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,840
Chateau.

58
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,840
So anyway, that's why you have to read it, so we can talk about it more in the comments.

59
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,840
So we're going to watch the movie Eat, Pray, Love for inspiration, not read the books,

60
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,840
because that's what Sarah would do.

61
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,840
So we'll do that at some point within the next...

62
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,480
We really want to play with this whole white person goes to a foreign country to find themselves

63
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:25,240
and white savior trope, so that's definitely going to be a big part of this that we're

64
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,280
going to be making fun of.

65
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,120
That's our broad strokes idea.

66
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,040
Let's discuss this outline.

67
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,240
So of course the book's got to open with Andi reflecting on how much her life has changed

68
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,320
since she met The One.

69
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
Like two weeks ago.

70
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,000
Yeah, and you definitely want to keep the frame very tight.

71
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:49,040
Of course everything is awesome, life is fantastic, she's best friends with his sister, and it's

72
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,040
only been two weeks.

73
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,640
Yeah, we were like, didn't want it to be such a knockoff of Twilight, but I guess that's

74
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,080
kind of inevitable.

75
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,400
So we were like, what happens?

76
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,000
I guess he like almost like sleep eats her soul or something.

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,240
Obviously give us suggestions for what this inciting incident could be to make it maybe

78
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,480
slightly less of a Twilight knockoff, I don't know.

79
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,560
He needs to go find a soul to sate his hunger, and he feels bad, so obviously he's gotta

80
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,520
A. leave her for her own good, and B. go devour her soul somewhere.

81
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,640
No fucks were given that day about the people who were going to die.

82
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,880
She just obviously is just like catatonic.

83
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,160
Yeah, we're definitely not going with the ethical vampires here.

84
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,280
No, he's awful and she's awful, it's awesome.

85
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,120
But he doesn't tell her she's going, he just fucking goes, and I think we had this possible

86
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,520
reveal that he left a note with Uncle Neil who forgot to give it to her or something

87
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
like that.

88
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,400
But of course, there's gotta be at least two scenes where it's kind of like, it's right

89
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,920
there, and Neil's like, I had, you know, never mind.

90
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,520
As a side note, with Riley, I'm sort of wondering if, do we even want to try and do the thing

91
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,520
where it's like, well I was going after a wife beater to feed my soul, like it shouldn't

92
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,520
be like, he goes after-

93
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,520
Yeah, that could be interesting.

94
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,600
Well, what do you think?

95
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Should he-

96
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,080
Just be a terrible person who just indiscriminately-

97
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,680
Should he just go after whoever, or should he go after only the bad ones, like Dexter?

98
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
Yeah.

99
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,680
You know?

100
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,680
He only eats the souls of serial killers now, he's a reformed eldritch horror.

101
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,680
Like dog kickers.

102
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,680
He's a reformed eldritch horror.

103
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,280
So Vic's relatives come to school and convinces the teacher to take the class to India, cause

104
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,280
why not?

105
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,280
Yeah, and they're in high school, that seems legit.

106
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,040
Yeah, no, it's the big spring break.

107
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,440
I think it should also be like, a little missionary thing as well, like, hey, pay money, let's

108
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,440
go to another country and build houses.

109
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,440
Yeah, yeah, they're like Habitat for Humanity or something.

110
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,440
Let's go dig some holes in the ground.

111
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,440
Already there's too much thought being put into this.

112
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,440
Well I think this fits for Sarah Ellison though, because she comes from a very religious background,

113
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,440
you know in high school she went on a missionary trip.

114
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,440
For the Anaprotestants.

115
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,440
And she just learned so much about herself.

116
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,840
The Anaprotestants go to Dayton, like that's their mission.

117
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,840
She goes from Trotwood to Dayton.

118
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,840
And that's very big exotic.

119
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:14,840
So they go to India, and that's like, you know, about in the winter, spring break.

120
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,840
Airport of course is right next to the Ganges River.

121
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,840
There are people bathing in it.

122
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,840
So this is where we-

123
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,840
I think we should only call like, Mumbai is just only referred to as Bombay.

124
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,840
Like the whole time.

125
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,240
I feel like maybe some people will try to correct whoever's talking.

126
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,240
And they're like, just kaboosh.

127
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,240
Istanbul is Constantinople.

128
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,240
Uncle Neil also shows up.

129
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,240
We definitely want him driving-

130
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,240
He plows out of the Ganges.

131
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,240
Driving his car out of the Ganges.

132
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,240
Fishing water out of his ear.

133
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,240
What'd I miss? Why are you here?

134
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,240
I forget, there's something I was supposed to tell you.

135
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,240
Yeah, it's like somewhere in the middle he shows up for some reason.

136
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,240
What's the reason, audience?

137
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,240
You would definitely want to crib a little from Transformers.

138
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,640
No, it was that Annie's mom gets high.

139
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,640
Oh yeah!

140
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,640
We need to do some-

141
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,640
Because it's funny.

142
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,640
We need to do some Revenge of the Fallen action.

143
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,640
Mom gets high, I'm-

144
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,640
I don't know, like peace pipe.

145
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,640
It should be a peace pipe or something.

146
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,640
But that's while they're in India.

147
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,640
However, when they first get off the airplane,

148
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,640
and this is where we start getting into Act 2,

149
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,640
a turbaned assassin attacks.

150
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,640
Oh yeah.

151
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,640
Now, here's the thing.

152
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,040
Everyone will always think all this stuff

153
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,040
is for Andy,

154
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,040
but it's actually for Vic.

155
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,040
Yeah, and there's gonna be a big reveal in the middle

156
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,040
that we find out

157
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,040
that Vic is actually-

158
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,040
So things will repeatedly happen.

159
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,040
Yeah.

160
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Things will repeatedly happen.

161
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,040
Andy's like, obviously it's because of me.

162
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,040
So some special things start to happen to Vic.

163
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,040
Like we go to the rat temple,

164
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,040
and all the rats just-

165
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,040
I feel so dirty.

166
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,440
I feel so dirty.

167
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,440
We've gotta be really careful about this.

168
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,440
Yeah, I mean-

169
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,440
This is gonna take a deft hand.

170
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,440
Of course Andy thinks it's all about her,

171
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,440
no it's not.

172
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,440
What we're just gonna have to do is that

173
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,440
in the descriptions, it has to be

174
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,440
what characters say and how things are described.

175
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,440
This is gonna be really hard.

176
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,440
We looked up for the Hindi word

177
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,440
because we were like,

178
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,440
Andy's gotta be the special.

179
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,440
So we looked up the Hindi word

180
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,840
for special, which is

181
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,840
I think the sesa.

182
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,840
I might need to double check

183
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,840
any Hindi or Urdu speakers

184
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,840
on my pronunciation.

185
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,840
I studied Hindi very briefly,

186
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,840
but it was years ago.

187
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,840
I forget things the day after I learn them.

188
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,840
Meanwhile, this is all going on in the background.

189
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,840
Bree is having awesome Indiana Jones adventures.

190
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,840
Pretty much discovering why

191
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,840
Andy can't be the special.

192
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,840
She's like, I don't think it's you.

193
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,840
It said it had to be someone that was like,

194
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,840
I'm from this land.

195
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,840
They meet multiple Maharajas.

196
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,840
Every town has a Maharaj.

197
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,840
And in the midpoint,

198
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,840
we reveal that Vic is the special

199
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,840
and has been the whole time.

200
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,840
Somehow or other, this ties in with

201
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,840
Cthulhu lore somehow.

202
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,840
75% into this story,

203
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,840
Riley has to come back.

204
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,840
We have to have the scene where

205
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,840
Andy almost kisses Vic.

206
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,840
I don't know, magical starlit night.

207
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,840
Or maybe he's

208
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,840
tapped into his

209
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,840
special powers.

210
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,840
And she cannot

211
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,840
resist them. She just has a thing

212
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,840
for avatars.

213
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,840
I'm imagining

214
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,840
a big Bollywood wedding

215
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,840
that they just get invited to.

216
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,840
That would be kind of awesome.

217
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,840
There's a single

218
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,840
red rose.

219
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,840
It shouldn't even come to a kiss.

220
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,840
Just be like, he caresses her with a red rose

221
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,840
and then Riley shows up.

222
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,840
He knows exactly what that means.

223
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,840
He's seen Cholet.

224
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,840
He knows what's up.

225
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,840
I don't think the rose was in Cholet.

226
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,840
Riley hurts Vic.

227
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,840
Or Vic's powered now and is actually

228
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,840
a match for Riley.

229
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,840
And Andy's like, say.

230
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Because wasn't the

231
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,840
idea behind the special going to be

232
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,840
turns out he is in fact

233
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,840
the 10th avatar of Vishnu.

234
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,840
Kalki, who

235
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,840
is destined to bring

236
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,840
an end to this world and a beginning to the next.

237
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,840
And only she can stop him.

238
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,840
Obviously.

239
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,840
Maybe this is her destiny all along.

240
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,840
She's the heart of Vishnu.

241
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,840
She's the only one

242
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,840
who can never stop anyone.

243
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,840
She's the heart of everything.

244
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,840
But she just doesn't listen.

245
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,840
Why would you leave me?

246
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,840
I feel so scorned.

247
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,840
And now she understands.

248
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,840
She thinks about Scarlet.

249
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,840
And wonders

250
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,840
if this was the scorn.

251
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,840
Could I turn out like her?

252
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,840
Now that I've been scorned.

253
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,840
So that's our end of act two.

254
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,840
And Vic gets kidnapped

255
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,840
by...

256
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,840
So this is our bad guy.

257
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,840
So who's our bad guy, Lindsay?

258
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,840
Oh yeah.

259
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,840
Wasn't it Loki?

260
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,840
Oh yeah.

261
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,840
Kidnapped by Loki

262
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,840
in Guise of Indian God.

263
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,840
And I would honestly

264
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,840
at this point say how drunk were we when we realized

265
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,840
but I know we were fat.

266
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,840
We were at a tea place with Lisa

267
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,840
who is super pregnant and therefore can't drink.

268
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,840
So we were so sober.

269
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,840
Sober cracked out.

270
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,840
Which is great.

271
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,840
My thought about Loki was that it's

272
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,840
just like Tom Hiddleston.

273
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,840
Word for word he keeps quoting

274
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,840
the movies or skirting the

275
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,840
copyright of quoting the movies.

276
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,840
And it's awesome.

277
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,840
That's all Sarah really knows

278
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,840
about Norse mythology.

279
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,840
Anyway, so Vic gets

280
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,840
kidnapped and then Riley doesn't want to help

281
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,840
even though it would be saving the world.

282
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,840
So Andi's on her own. Of course with Bri.

283
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,840
Yeah, we need to find a way to make

284
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,840
Riley suck less

285
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,840
than he is in this outline.

286
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,840
I mean like he sucks

287
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,840
but he needs to be kind of like

288
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,840
an alluring kind of suck.

289
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,840
Like if you were writing

290
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,840
an asshole that also still

291
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,840
Like a Christian Grey type who sucks

292
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,840
that the readers like for some

293
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,840
unfettered reason.

294
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,840
You know how everyone will be like, but by the end of the book

295
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,840
she really sort of comes into

296
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,840
her own and she's not getting pushed around

297
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,840
anymore.

298
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,840
That's exactly what's happening

299
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,840
by the third of those books.

300
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,840
Since it is Loki, we do learn that Vic

301
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,840
is in fact not the 10th Avatar Vishnu

302
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,840
but some Nordic

303
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,840
the special. Like he's actually

304
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,840
the Nordic special and it's not gonna be

305
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,840
the Hindu version

306
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,840
of the end of this world

307
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,840
but the Nordic Ragnarok

308
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,840
which is basically the same thing.

309
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,840
I mean it's the same but not.

310
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,840
You know obviously details differ.

311
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,840
But the whole vague like this world is ending

312
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,840
and a new one's gonna begin. One world ends in fire

313
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,840
and the other ends in ice.

314
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,840
In Hinduism it's

315
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,840
the end of the world

316
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,840
is considered a good thing

317
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,840
because this world

318
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,840
I forget the word for it but it basically means

319
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,840
dark times. It's like Kali something.

320
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,840
And it's like

321
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,840
this world sucks but then the

322
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,840
10th Avatar Vishnu's gonna come and make

323
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,840
this world end and then we're gonna have a good age

324
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,840
and it's gonna be like the fun awesome age

325
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,840
that sucks considerably less than this age

326
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,840
does and we live in the age of suck.

327
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,840
And I know I'm doing

328
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,840
complete justice to this

329
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,840
really in-depth

330
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,840
proud history

331
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,840
and deeply religious

332
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,840
concept. The age of suck

333
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,840
is what it's

334
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,840
official term in Hindi.

335
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,840
And the ending is

336
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,840
basically that.

337
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,840
The world doesn't end. It is reborn

338
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,840
in fact. Surprise.

339
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,840
And there's no Thursdays.

340
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,840
That was gonna be a joke. No more Thors

341
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,840
days. But also

342
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,840
it ends with there is

343
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,840
not only a dystopia in this

344
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,840
new horrible changed world but also a matriarchy

345
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,840
and only our heroes

346
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,840
have any memory of the way things

347
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,840
should be.

348
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,840
And so we're thinking this one's gonna end on

349
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,840
a cliffhanger. So that is our very

350
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,840
very very loose

351
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,840
skeleton. Obviously there are a lot of holes

352
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,840
that need filling in in our plot.

353
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,840
And also

354
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,840
what would you like to see parodied

355
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,840
in this one that we haven't touched upon yet?

356
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,840
Obviously we talk, we dig a lot

357
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,840
on things like pray love tiger's curse

358
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,840
and new moon and hinting

359
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,840
at things like divergent

360
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,840
which will obviously come in a third book. But what else?

361
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,840
Hannah Jones. Of course Transformers

362
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,840
Revenge of the Fallen. Yes.

363
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,840
The greatest sequel of all time.

364
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,840
She hasn't finished it.

365
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,840
It got like 40 minutes in.

366
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,840
We tried once.

367
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,840
So leave your comments.

368
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,840
Give us your suggestions.

369
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,840
We talk not only about plot points but also

370
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,840
new characters, new

371
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,840
faces. Obviously Neil

372
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,840
kind of takes up all of the awesome for the book

373
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,840
but we'd be interested to see if

374
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,840
there are any others. I think we need a

375
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,840
Maharaja guru.

376
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,840
It should be like he's a Maharaja

377
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,840
but he's a guru.

378
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,840
This is a character that keeps popping up throughout

379
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,840
the book. It's like I thought you were a Maharaja. Yeah I'm also

380
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,840
a guru. As always leave your

381
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,840
suggestions, comments

382
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,840
and warnings

383
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,840
on

384
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,840
SheaApocalypse.com where we read

385
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,840
the comments. Also be sure to tweet at us and

386
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,840
follow us at SheaApocalypse.

387
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,840
And remember

388
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,840
next week

389
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,840
we are going to be doing our first author interview.

390
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,840
Lisa is going to be filling in for

391
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,840
Nella. I will not be here.

392
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,840
The week after that is going to be

393
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,840
another review. We are going to

394
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,840
review John Scalzi's new book

395
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,840
which you can't read

396
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,840
because it's not out yet.

397
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,840
So we're going to review a thing before

398
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,840
it comes out. Go team.

399
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,840
Exciting. Yay.

400
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,840
You know that life, it sure does happen

401
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,840
doesn't it Lindsay? And again

402
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,840
we are very sorry at our inability

403
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,840
to keep to a schedule. Summer is

404
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,840
difficult because we are basically not

405
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,840
here during the weekends. We're here to shoot an edit.

406
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,840
Damn day jobs

407
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,840
slash ponds. I haven't even been to the beach yet.

408
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,840
I know. I have not been

409
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,840
near a body of water and we live literally

410
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,840
by the ocean. Yeah.

411
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,840
Our lives are hard. Our lives are really

412
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,840
hard. It's so hard.

413
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,840
It's just so freaking hard.

414
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,840
.
