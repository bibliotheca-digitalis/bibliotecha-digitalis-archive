0	7600	So 2017 was a momentous year in which a mainstream movie finally went where scores of women had wanted it to go for decades.
20600	25240	The Shape of Water takes the monster movie in a new direction, conceding that, hey,
25240	28980	maybe the maiden isn't terrified of being carried off by the fish man.
29280	34100	Maybe she relates to the fish man. Maybe the fish man is lonely like she is.
34500	41760	Maybe the fish man is treated the same way that you, a woman or disabled person or gay man or person of color in
41880	44480	your unfair era, feel treated by society.
44680	49240	Maybe that fish man just wants what most of us want, which is to feel loved and safe.
49360	52680	Wait, he ate your neighbor's cat? And you find a lot of people,
52680	58220	but especially women and LGBT people, who are super excited that Del Toro is going there.
58920	66000	And just as many people who were kind of bewildered that there were people who were excited that Del Toro was going there.
66000	69760	The Shape of Water is not necessarily the first piece of media that goes there,
69760	73480	but it does mark a turning point in taking that idea and turning it mainstream.
73480	77640	The monster in The Shape of Water is not a changeling. He does not turn into a prince at the end.
77640	80940	There is no transformative change brought on by contact with beauty.
81100	84540	He is an anatomically correct fish man, and she's super into that.
84540	86540	Does he have a...
93020	93700	Mm-hmm.
93700	98780	But the ideas in and of themself are not you and unique. That all of this is present in a critically acclaimed
99300	105260	mainstream movie is new and unique. And there are those out there that are like, what happened?
105260	109660	Why are women suddenly into this idea of boinking monsters?
109660	117040	And it's not that they suddenly are, it's that there is a mainstream filmmaker who is ready and willing to go there.
117580	121440	Obviously, this is nothing new. This is, dare I say it,
122300	124300	a tale as old as time.
124700	126700	Tale as old as time.
129580	131580	True as it can be.
131700	135640	The folkloric monster is always a sort of embodiment of cultural anxieties,
135720	137720	either ones that must be understood,
138080	143040	endured, or empathized with, as in the case with Beauty and the Beast, or one that must be vanquished.
143360	149060	Historically, the Beast in Beauty and the Beast stories is an animal. Wolves, bears, or some sort of chimera of the above that posed an
149160	150800	existential threat to our ancestors.
150800	157160	There are folk tales about animal bridegrooms in every storytelling culture, and in Western culture it often acts as stories of
157360	165280	transformative redemption. What author and folklorist Maria Tatar has described as the transformative power of empathy that encodes messages about how we manage social
165400	172520	and cultural anxieties about romance, marriage, and the other. In the 20th century, the Beauty and the Beast dynamic evolved a more reactionary,
172840	178740	fearful stance, where the Beast was a giant ape, or a gillman, or an alien, or...
179960	181280	We'll get to that.
181280	188080	The 1950s horror monster is particularly noteworthy with regard to the shape of water, not only because of the time period, but because of the
188200	191280	anxieties the monsters are inspired by. The Cold War,
192200	193620	desegregation,
193660	199740	emotionalization, and so on. As Tatar points out, in the future the Beast may take the form of an android or a cyborg,
200340	202620	machines that embody our anxieties and phobias.
202620	204620	I'm half machine.
204620	206620	I'm a monster!
208980	215980	So beasts, whether they must be vanquished by the hero or they turn into a prince at the end, must also have elements that make them
216260	221220	attractive. The Greek word for monster, teras, captures the paradox of monsterhood,
221740	228500	designating something both repulsive and attractive. Which brings us to why beasts are so often paired with, and ultimately
228860	231100	transformed by, or killed by,
231940	233940	beauty. It wasn't the airplanes.
235220	237220	It was Beauty killed the Beast.
238860	243340	Nearly every storytelling culture maps out dating practices with Beast
243540	249540	partners. From ancient Rome, with the myth of Eros and Psyche, to the old Norse folk tale, East of the Sun, West in the Moon,
249580	256180	which is nearly identical to the myth of Eros and Psyche, an Indian variant has a girl in an arranged marriage to a snake, and
256300	262020	in doing exactly as she is told and being happy in her arranged snake marriage, the snake turns into a fancy Brahmin.
262020	267580	There is a Chilean version that is almost identical to the myth of Eros and Psyche, with the prince taking the form of an enchanted
267580	273620	parrot. A Ghanaian variant features an inversion on the arranged marriage theme, in which a girl marries for love and oops,
273620	275020	she married a hyena man.
275020	278660	And that's why you should always listen to your mother and enter marriages arranged by your parents.
278660	283060	These folk tales originate in times when arranged marriages were the norm in pretty much every culture on Earth.
283340	288860	Many in arranged marriage must have seemed like being tethered to a monster, and the telling of stories like Beauty and the Beast may have
288860	294180	furnished women with a socially acceptable channel for providing advice, comfort, and the consolation of imagination.
294700	301780	See girls, he may seem like a horrible monster, but you know, maybe if you're really nice and virtuous and self-sacrificing,
302260	304260	you can change him.
304340	307820	Common themes of Beauty and Beast tales the world over include
308060	310060	Beauty is not like other girls.
310220	318180	She is exceptionally virtuous and self-sacrificing. Other less virtuous female characters, what we in the academic world call jealous bitches,
318740	324540	Beauty is often punished for her curiosity about the Beast. As with Psyche and East of the Sun, West of the Moon,
324900	330060	often the jealous bitches coerce Beauty to look upon the Beast when Beauty was not supposed to, and then the Beast is like,
330260	337540	God damn it, Beauty! My enchantment was almost lifted! I was two weeks away from retirement and now I'm gonna be Beast forever!
337540	341460	And now Beauty must go on some torturous penance journey to break his curse.
341580	347180	Beast is usually materially wealthy, or at least has some sort of enchanted means for providing for Beauty's every want.
347300	350060	This motif is as old as the written word,
350060	356140	but the story that we know as Beauty and the Beast was penned in 1756 by Madame Le Prince de Beaumont
356580	358140	for her
358140	364740	the purpose of which was to promote good manners in the young and to indoctrinate and enlighten children about the virtues of fine
364820	370940	manners and good breeding. Beauty is predisposed from the very beginning to acts of self-sacrifice. Without question,
370940	372940	she agrees to give her life for her father.
377940	382700	In the end, Beauty preferred virtue to looks, not like her sisters who are jealous bitches.
386340	393060	Beauty doesn't care that Beast isn't the wittiest man alive. He's nice.
393940	401180	Also, rich. And the story ends with Beauty being rewarded with a handsome prince who was also secretly intelligent the whole time, and Beauty's
401180	404140	haters being turned into stone and being forced to watch
404700	411700	Beauty's happy life until they learn their lesson. According to Tarr, Beaumont's take attempted to study the fears of young women, to reconcile them to
411700	418300	the custom of arranged marriages, and to brace them for an alliance that required prefacing their own desires and submitting to the will of a
418300	425460	monster. Ain't history fun? Moving forward in time a little bit, we get to another big monster milestone with Mary Shelley's
425820	430540	Frankenstein. The rise of the Byronic hero made the Beast more of a metaphorical one and
430820	433700	relegated Beauty and the Beast stories to folklore and children's tales.
433900	440020	But there was also the rise of a sort of Byronic monster at the same time, as we saw with the creature in Mary Shelley's
440100	447540	Frankenstein, who, while a creature with pathos, is still an unholy abomination that needed to be vanquished. Though written by a woman, this monster
447540	454900	isn't really positioned against fear or anxiety specific to womanhood. Shelley famously wrote Frankenstein, or the modern Prometheus during a writing
454900	456700	contest put forth by Lord Byron.
456700	462900	She came up with the idea when she was listening to a conversation between Percy Shelley and Lord Byron talking about some rumored scientific
463060	467820	experiments that may eventually lead to corpses being brought back to life, and it freaked her out so much
467820	471460	she had nightmares about it. In the preface to the 1831 reprint of the book,
471700	477740	Shelley wrote of her nightmare that she saw the creature show signs of life and stir with an uneasy half-vital motion.
478180	484700	Frightful must it be, for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavor to mock the stupendous mechanism of the creator of the
484700	485700	world.
485700	492340	Frankenstein was written at a time when there was a lot of mass anxiety about the scientific world rubbing up against a religious one, and
492540	495140	Frankenstein's monster is very much an embodiment of that anxiety.
495580	502940	Frankenstein was a seminal science fiction novel, and its monster was not only a milestone for how we envision monsters,
502940	506760	but it was also a milestone for how media envisions monsters,
507060	512580	especially once Hollywood came into the picture. And with American visual mass media came the rise of the monster movie.
512580	516860	And yes, you have your opera phantoms, your Nosferatu's, your
517700	520500	Frankenstein's, all monsters who terrorize women.
521060	527020	But we should we should also talk about Birth of a Nation. Birth of a Nation is a significant movie in many regards,
527020	527900	but in this case,
527900	531540	I want to focus on the character Gus, played by a white man in blackface,
531680	535040	who chases a white woman into the hills with the intent of raping her.
535040	540260	She would rather die, and she jumps to her death to escape. In response to this, the heroic
540380	545840	KKK hunts Gus down and lynches him. This is framed in the film as good and heroic. And
546360	547640	of course, the
547640	553680	monster in this movie very much exemplifies the anxieties of white America at the beginning of the 20th century.
553980	555980	Hey boys,
556720	558720	look what I got here.
560320	566720	Hey, where are the white women at? Birth of a Nation is kind of under-discussed, at least recently, as to
566840	569920	why it was so important for the formation of film,
570080	577680	but a super under-discussed element is the way that it would eventually lead to the coding in monster movies, and the way that
577840	580560	monsters relate to women as symbols of purity.
581880	587200	To white women. Flash forward a few decades, and being quite so literal with what it is
587200	591560	we're worried is going to come after our white women is perhaps a little gauche.
591920	599160	Hey, where are the white women at? Enter the real movie monster of Hollywood, the beast what was killed by beauty, King Kong, and
599480	602800	20 years after that, we have a whole host of sci-fi B movies.
602800	606920	Oh, the women what were carried away screaming by these inhuman monsters.
607280	613160	So, societal fears and how they play into popular culture of the 1950s is a very, very big topic,
613160	616200	so I'm going to try and keep this concise. In the post-World War II era,
616200	623480	we had this booming economy and really conservative culture rubbing up against the end of the colonial era. Fears of the commies, the anxieties concerning
623840	625440	desegregation and miscegenation,
625440	633240	the atomic bomb, and so on. Throughout the media of the 30s and the 50s, the difference, or lack thereof, between the primitive and
633240	635160	the civilized was a popular theme.
635160	640440	So it's not a huge coincidence that so many monsters of the 30s, 40s, and 50s came from Africa, or
640960	644400	west of Sumatra, or in the creatures case, the Amazon.
645120	650880	A non-comprehensive list of films featuring missing link style monsters would include Bride of the Gorilla, The Neanderthal Man,
651560	654800	Monster on the Campus, and of course, King Kong.
655440	660640	And this is to say nothing about the aliens that totally don't represent our anxieties about the impending communist invasion.
661040	664800	They have to be destroyed. All of them. They will be. Everyone.
664800	667800	But the most iconic from this era is the Creature from the Black Lagoon.
668080	672120	According to film historian Fatima Tobingroni, the basic narrative of the Creature series,
672120	679280	especially the first two films, is fueled by the violence of the Gill Man's attraction to and pursuit of the female lead, and the heroes
679280	685360	need to protect her from the monster. All of these films use womanhood as a sort of avatar for a precious status quo.
685440	689440	That must be protected. And not just womanhood, white womanhood.
689920	696900	Roney contends that the portrayal of figures such as Anne Darrow and King Kong reveals a cinematic fascination with beautiful white women as
697080	698720	unconscious source of disorder.
698720	704140	Both the Creature from the Black Lagoon and the Revenge of the Creature end with a monster presumably killed by white men,
704240	707560	galvanized into action by the abduction of the various female leads.
708560	709800	Hmm.
709800	712580	So it's not a huge stretch to draw a direct line from this...
712580	714580	...
714620	716340	...to this...
716340	718140	...to this.
718140	723780	And again, to paraphrase Tolkien, I do not wish to confuse applicability with allegory.
723780	731060	I do not think that the filmmakers deliberately went out to code the Creature from the Black Lagoon as a person of color that is threatening
731060	737600	white female purity. That said, that does not mean that the Creature is bereft of coding, intentional or no.
737760	743800	So, for the difference between coding and allegory, skipped about to the 24-minute mark in the bright video.
747800	748600	It's over here.
748600	755720	But these monsters, unlike the black-faced rhathus gusts in Birth of a Nation, are portrayed with pathos, like a B-movie
755960	759360	Shakespearean tragedy. King Kong's death is treated like an inevitability,
759360	765000	but a tragic one. When Kong and the Creature are brought into violent contact with modernity, disaster occurs.
765040	768280	They are incompatible with it, and then they are inevitably destroyed.
768680	774480	There is a fear of the primitive and unknown embodied by the monster, but don't worry, modernity will mow it down in the end.
774600	778800	So what changed? How did we get from this to this?
788000	794000	Part of the major shift in storytelling and monster stories is the re-examination of what monsterhood actually entails.
795000	797000	I bring you love.
797000	799000	It's bringing love, don't let it get away!
799000	800000	Break its legs!
800000	806000	Namely, internal versus external monsterhood, a theme that is made explicit in Disney's Beauty and the Beast.
806000	813000	But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances, for beauty is found within.
813000	815000	In Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame.
815000	820000	Who is the monster and who is the man?
820000	822000	And in The Shape of Water.
822000	825000	And the tale of love and loss.
825000	828000	And the monster.
828000	830000	Who tried to destroy it all.
830000	838000	What we typically saw in those old B movies from the 1950s was that there was a strapping white hero in opposite to the brutish beast that lusted after beauty.
838000	842000	But somewhere along the line we began to realize the insidious undertones of this whole dynamic.
842000	846000	The monster who was minding his own business is then kidnapped into modernity,
846000	849000	the strapping hero who only knows how to solve problems through violence,
849000	853000	the passive woman who existed only to be carried away screaming by the monster.
853000	857000	So later versions of Beauty Beast monster stories changed a lot.
857000	863000	Beauty is no longer so self-sacrificing, the jealous bitches are either relegated to ascended extras,
863000	864000	What's wrong with her?
864000	865000	She's crazy!
865000	866000	She's gorgeous!
866000	869000	removed altogether or actually loving and supportive.
869000	873000	The character of Zelda in The Shape of Water is a total inversion of the jealous bitch archetype,
873000	878000	even going so far as to act as an accomplice to protagonist Eliza at great risk to herself.
878000	882000	We also see a rising trend of an outside antagonistic force.
882000	888000	Disney was not the original innovator of a hyper-masculine yet foppish authoritarian Gaston in opposition to the beast.
888000	891000	That, like many things, was taken from the Jean Cocteau adaptation.
891000	895000	But the handsome, or at least normal-looking villain,
895000	900000	became a popular addition to these stories to play up this idea of internal versus external monsterhood,
900000	904000	another obstacle for the couple who effectively embodies an unaccepting society.
904000	907000	So, starting with the media revolutions of the late 60s and 70s,
907000	913000	there is renewed interest in finding humanity, even the attraction, in the things that scare us.
913000	915000	It's probably just from some nearby cottage.
915000	917000	It's nothing to worry about.
917000	919000	Where are you going?
919000	921000	All you men are all alike.
921000	926000	Seven or eight quick ones and you're off with the boys to boast and brag.
926000	928000	You better keep your mouth shut!
928000	930000	Oh, I think I love him.
930000	935000	But actually depicting attraction to a monster in a visual medium?
935000	940000	Uh, it's really hard to do that well and not be completely awkward.
940000	947000	The 1976 remake of King Kong attempted to depict Kong and Dwan's attraction as somewhat mutual.
954000	958000	This is the very hotness. Hit me with that gorilla breath.
958000	965000	Perhaps the Urine version of the 1950s movie monster in the 1980s is Swamp Thing and his many knockoffs,
965000	968000	wherein the romantic hero gets turned into a monster,
968000	974000	and then he and his lady friend spend the entire rest of the movie fighting off bad guys in a swamp.
974000	979000	In the 1980s, CBS had a primetime version of Beauty and the Beast starring Linda Hamilton,
979000	982000	opposite sexy manimal Ron Perlman.
983000	984000	Catherine.
988000	993000	Where the Beast, Vincent, remains in a constant state of beastliness and Beauty, Catherine,
993000	997000	lives a dual life between her day career as a New York City assistant district attorney
997000	1000000	and her night career wearing silky pajamas.
1000000	1004000	Here, the Beast saves her from a violent assault and nurses her back to health
1004000	1009000	and he wants Catherine to be happy and supports her in her daytime career as badass lady lawyer.
1009000	1013000	This is so unbearably sincere. I cannot believe this exists.
1013000	1016000	What bombed out wine mom wrote this?
1019000	1020000	Really?
1020000	1024000	Also mega popular at this point in history is the Phantom of the Opera on Broadway.
1024000	1026000	By the late 1980s, the Phantom has evolved.
1026000	1032000	He's no longer the evil, gollum-y wretch of the Lon Chaney movie who gets torn apart by an angry mob.
1032000	1036000	Now he's basically the romantic hero and one third of a love triangle.
1036000	1040000	He still doesn't get the girl in the end, but he is much more human, tragic, and empathetic.
1040000	1043000	Most importantly, he is romantic.
1043000	1045000	And then, of course, comes the Disney movie.
1046000	1048000	She's so beautiful and I'm...
1048000	1050000	Well, look at me!
1052000	1055000	Oh, you must help her to see past all that.
1055000	1056000	I don't know how.
1056000	1061000	A few years after that, DreamWorks Animation built effectively a cottage industry around fairy tale inversion.
1061000	1066000	First with Shrek, a Beauty and the Beast story which ends with Beauty turning into a beast at the end.
1067000	1069000	I'm supposed to be beautiful.
1071000	1073000	But you are beautiful.
1073000	1077000	After that, we saw Megamind, which also has a story of transformative empathy
1077000	1080000	and includes a major plot element of trying to look normal.
1080000	1083000	Just a technical glitch. Don't look yet.
1083000	1086000	But in the end, he does get the girl despite not changing his appearance.
1086000	1089000	And then there's Monsters vs. Aliens, which features...
1089000	1092000	The rare female monster.
1092000	1095000	Susan's story is effectively about being comfortable in her own skin.
1095000	1097000	You're doing great.
1097000	1099000	I'm doing everything!
1099000	1105000	Around this time in Beauty and the Beastim, there was also this really lame trend in visual media that kind of walked back.
1105000	1109000	There was a CW Beauty and the Beast series where the Beast has got like a scar
1109000	1113000	and I guess he's a beast because he hulks out sometimes.
1113000	1115000	I can kill you in less than a second!
1115000	1117000	And then there was Beastly, starring Vanessa Hudgens.
1117000	1124000	And the Beast is only a beast in that he has these rad, sexy scars and badass beast tattoos.
1124000	1126000	This isn't Beastly.
1126000	1127000	I want my manimal!
1127000	1128000	Whoa, not that manimal. Never mind.
1128000	1130000	Actually, Romeo and Juliet's my favorite play.
1132000	1134000	Why is that not a surprise?
1134000	1136000	Ah yes, my fantasy. A beast that megs.
1136000	1143000	In more recent years, we've seen the curious, unabashed rise of self-published monster erotica on places like Amazon.
1143000	1146000	We also now have super popular anime and manga, Ancient Magus Bride,
1146000	1151000	the author of which claims she was inspired to write it because she was disappointed with Beauty and the Beast stories,
1151000	1154000	always ending with the Beast turning back into a prince at the end.
1154000	1156000	And then, of course, The Shape of Water.
1157000	1160000	The Shape of Water playing monster romance straight is not the first.
1160000	1165000	Hell, it's not even the first for Guillermo del Toro, who is eponymous monster man, also played by Ron Perlman,
1165000	1167000	I wish I could do something about this.
1167000	1169000	got the girl at the end of Hellboy,
1169000	1173000	while the white guy who would have been the hero in a 1950s monster movie looks on sadly.
1173000	1178000	Del Toro stated that the whole idea for The Shape of Water came to him after feeling sympathy for the Gill-man
1178000	1180000	when he saw the creature from the Black Lagoon as a child.
1180000	1184000	Del Toro has always had a special fascination, and even sympathy for monsters,
1184000	1187000	and he was well aware of the racial coding in the original Creature series,
1187000	1190000	which is why The Shape of Water turns into a deliberate inversion.
1190000	1192000	According to del Toro,
1208000	1210000	There's always been coding in stories like this,
1210000	1214000	so it's no coincidence that eventually people from marginalized communities,
1214000	1217000	immigrants, queer people, people of color,
1217000	1219000	would not only see themselves in movie monsters,
1219000	1224000	but kind of lean into this and then really start to invert what we even expect from monsters.
1224000	1230000	Because there is some truth to this idea that there's allegory there to being a queer person,
1230000	1234000	a person of color in America, or both.
1237000	1238000	Hello?
1238000	1241000	My name is Kenzie. It's La'Ron from the YouTube channel ReadUs101.
1241000	1244000	So, my M'Baku senses were tingling earlier,
1244000	1249000	and I was just calling to make sure you weren't trying to speak for a group of individuals that you don't necessarily represent.
1249000	1255000	No! No! I wouldn't. I'm woke. I'm the wokest.
1255000	1257000	Oh, good. That's great to hear.
1257000	1262000	Well, considering that I'm actually a queer person of color living in America,
1262000	1265000	do you mind hearing my opinions on the matter?
1265000	1267000	Yes, by all means. Go ahead.
1267000	1269000	Well, it's definitely like you stated earlier.
1269000	1276000	Monster movies are the perfect allegory for what it's like being queer, a person of color, or both in America.
1276000	1283000	Depending on the era the movie takes place in, racism and LGBT phobia ostracized a lot of individuals.
1283000	1290000	And it's because of that ostracization that it makes sense that those affected would find the monsters in monster movies relatable.
1290000	1293000	After being called an abomination for being attracted to the same sex,
1294000	1299000	you might find the actual walking abomination that is Frankenstein's monster,
1299000	1302000	and how he's treated throughout the film as relatable.
1302000	1305000	The original or Peter Jackson's 2005 remake,
1305000	1309000	King Kong's capture, enslavement, and the bond that he forms with Anne
1309000	1313000	says a lot about not only the obvious oppression of African Americans,
1313000	1320000	but is also a very well done allegory for the at-the-time taboo subject of interracial relationships.
1320000	1324000	Well, maybe the 2005 movie more than the original.
1331000	1334000	Actually, forget I said that.
1334000	1337000	Speaking of relationships, didn't you just do a video about the shape of water
1337000	1341000	and why certain people might be attracted to monsters like that in the first place?
1341000	1343000	Oh yeah, I did. I...
1345000	1347000	How did you do that?
1347000	1351000	The same way you called me in the middle of a pre-written and recorded video essay.
1353000	1355000	So does this mean that The Fish Man does it for you?
1363000	1367000	Anything you've heard about novel-length Starscream fanfic is a lie!
1368000	1369000	Moving on.
1369000	1373000	Part of what makes this movie unique is the intentionality with which it approaches coding.
1373000	1376000	You see this in mainstream romance novels too,
1376000	1379000	but romances written for women, especially Beauty and the Beast stories,
1379000	1382000	tend to have a theme of the transformative aspect of love,
1382000	1386000	this being the whole thrust behind Fifty Shades of Grey, for better or worse.
1386000	1389000	And again, to be clear, that shit is my jam.
1389000	1393000	I still pay to see Phantom of the Opera on Broadway.
1394000	1395000	Depending on who's the phantom.
1395000	1399000	It is relevant that the monster of Del Toro's romance does not transform,
1399000	1401000	either physically or internally.
1401000	1404000	Del Toro was more interested in the empathy being there from the outset,
1404000	1408000	and the creature being accepted for who and what he is without having to change.
1408000	1411000	And that is reflective of changing sensitivities.
1411000	1415000	People are more interested in relating to the monster's pain than in hunting down and killing him.
1415000	1417000	Or, sometimes, her.
1417000	1420000	A monster is always an embodiment of some kind of anxiety,
1420000	1424000	but the fate of the monster depends on the anxiety and what angle is it approached from,
1424000	1427000	and what moral, the culture, and the storyteller wants to push.
1427000	1431000	The interesting change we're seeing now is concern for the well-being of the monster,
1431000	1434000	which I think speaks to a broader trend of more empathetic storytelling.
1434000	1438000	At the very least, it's a more interesting way to write the monster.
1461000	1463000	Thank you for watching.
