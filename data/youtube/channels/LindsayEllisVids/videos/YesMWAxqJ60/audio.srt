1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
So 2017 was a momentous year in which a mainstream movie finally went where scores of women had wanted it to go for decades.

2
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,240
The Shape of Water takes the monster movie in a new direction, conceding that, hey,

3
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,980
maybe the maiden isn't terrified of being carried off by the fish man.

4
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,100
Maybe she relates to the fish man. Maybe the fish man is lonely like she is.

5
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,760
Maybe the fish man is treated the same way that you, a woman or disabled person or gay man or person of color in

6
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,480
your unfair era, feel treated by society.

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,240
Maybe that fish man just wants what most of us want, which is to feel loved and safe.

8
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,680
Wait, he ate your neighbor's cat? And you find a lot of people,

9
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,220
but especially women and LGBT people, who are super excited that Del Toro is going there.

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:06,000
And just as many people who were kind of bewildered that there were people who were excited that Del Toro was going there.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,760
The Shape of Water is not necessarily the first piece of media that goes there,

12
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,480
but it does mark a turning point in taking that idea and turning it mainstream.

13
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,640
The monster in The Shape of Water is not a changeling. He does not turn into a prince at the end.

14
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,940
There is no transformative change brought on by contact with beauty.

15
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,540
He is an anatomically correct fish man, and she's super into that.

16
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,540
Does he have a...

17
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,700
Mm-hmm.

18
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,780
But the ideas in and of themself are not you and unique. That all of this is present in a critically acclaimed

19
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:45,260
mainstream movie is new and unique. And there are those out there that are like, what happened?

20
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,660
Why are women suddenly into this idea of boinking monsters?

21
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:57,040
And it's not that they suddenly are, it's that there is a mainstream filmmaker who is ready and willing to go there.

22
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,440
Obviously, this is nothing new. This is, dare I say it,

23
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,300
a tale as old as time.

24
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,700
Tale as old as time.

25
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,580
True as it can be.

26
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,640
The folkloric monster is always a sort of embodiment of cultural anxieties,

27
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,720
either ones that must be understood,

28
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,040
endured, or empathized with, as in the case with Beauty and the Beast, or one that must be vanquished.

29
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,060
Historically, the Beast in Beauty and the Beast stories is an animal. Wolves, bears, or some sort of chimera of the above that posed an

30
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,800
existential threat to our ancestors.

31
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,160
There are folk tales about animal bridegrooms in every storytelling culture, and in Western culture it often acts as stories of

32
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:45,280
transformative redemption. What author and folklorist Maria Tatar has described as the transformative power of empathy that encodes messages about how we manage social

33
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:52,520
and cultural anxieties about romance, marriage, and the other. In the 20th century, the Beauty and the Beast dynamic evolved a more reactionary,

34
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,740
fearful stance, where the Beast was a giant ape, or a gillman, or an alien, or...

35
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,280
We'll get to that.

36
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:08,080
The 1950s horror monster is particularly noteworthy with regard to the shape of water, not only because of the time period, but because of the

37
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,280
anxieties the monsters are inspired by. The Cold War,

38
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,620
desegregation,

39
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:19,740
emotionalization, and so on. As Tatar points out, in the future the Beast may take the form of an android or a cyborg,

40
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,620
machines that embody our anxieties and phobias.

41
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,620
I'm half machine.

42
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,620
I'm a monster!

43
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:35,980
So beasts, whether they must be vanquished by the hero or they turn into a prince at the end, must also have elements that make them

44
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:41,220
attractive. The Greek word for monster, teras, captures the paradox of monsterhood,

45
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:48,500
designating something both repulsive and attractive. Which brings us to why beasts are so often paired with, and ultimately

46
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,100
transformed by, or killed by,

47
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,940
beauty. It wasn't the airplanes.

48
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,220
It was Beauty killed the Beast.

49
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,340
Nearly every storytelling culture maps out dating practices with Beast

50
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:09,540
partners. From ancient Rome, with the myth of Eros and Psyche, to the old Norse folk tale, East of the Sun, West in the Moon,

51
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:16,180
which is nearly identical to the myth of Eros and Psyche, an Indian variant has a girl in an arranged marriage to a snake, and

52
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:22,020
in doing exactly as she is told and being happy in her arranged snake marriage, the snake turns into a fancy Brahmin.

53
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:27,580
There is a Chilean version that is almost identical to the myth of Eros and Psyche, with the prince taking the form of an enchanted

54
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:33,620
parrot. A Ghanaian variant features an inversion on the arranged marriage theme, in which a girl marries for love and oops,

55
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,020
she married a hyena man.

56
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,660
And that's why you should always listen to your mother and enter marriages arranged by your parents.

57
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,060
These folk tales originate in times when arranged marriages were the norm in pretty much every culture on Earth.

58
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:48,860
Many in arranged marriage must have seemed like being tethered to a monster, and the telling of stories like Beauty and the Beast may have

59
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:54,180
furnished women with a socially acceptable channel for providing advice, comfort, and the consolation of imagination.

60
00:04:54,700 --> 00:05:01,780
See girls, he may seem like a horrible monster, but you know, maybe if you're really nice and virtuous and self-sacrificing,

61
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,260
you can change him.

62
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,820
Common themes of Beauty and Beast tales the world over include

63
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,060
Beauty is not like other girls.

64
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:18,180
She is exceptionally virtuous and self-sacrificing. Other less virtuous female characters, what we in the academic world call jealous bitches,

65
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:24,540
Beauty is often punished for her curiosity about the Beast. As with Psyche and East of the Sun, West of the Moon,

66
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,060
often the jealous bitches coerce Beauty to look upon the Beast when Beauty was not supposed to, and then the Beast is like,

67
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:37,540
God damn it, Beauty! My enchantment was almost lifted! I was two weeks away from retirement and now I'm gonna be Beast forever!

68
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,460
And now Beauty must go on some torturous penance journey to break his curse.

69
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:47,180
Beast is usually materially wealthy, or at least has some sort of enchanted means for providing for Beauty's every want.

70
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,060
This motif is as old as the written word,

71
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:56,140
but the story that we know as Beauty and the Beast was penned in 1756 by Madame Le Prince de Beaumont

72
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,140
for her

73
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:04,740
the purpose of which was to promote good manners in the young and to indoctrinate and enlighten children about the virtues of fine

74
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:10,940
manners and good breeding. Beauty is predisposed from the very beginning to acts of self-sacrifice. Without question,

75
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,940
she agrees to give her life for her father.

76
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,700
In the end, Beauty preferred virtue to looks, not like her sisters who are jealous bitches.

77
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:33,060
Beauty doesn't care that Beast isn't the wittiest man alive. He's nice.

78
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:41,180
Also, rich. And the story ends with Beauty being rewarded with a handsome prince who was also secretly intelligent the whole time, and Beauty's

79
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,140
haters being turned into stone and being forced to watch

80
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:51,700
Beauty's happy life until they learn their lesson. According to Tarr, Beaumont's take attempted to study the fears of young women, to reconcile them to

81
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:58,300
the custom of arranged marriages, and to brace them for an alliance that required prefacing their own desires and submitting to the will of a

82
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:05,460
monster. Ain't history fun? Moving forward in time a little bit, we get to another big monster milestone with Mary Shelley's

83
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,540
Frankenstein. The rise of the Byronic hero made the Beast more of a metaphorical one and

84
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,700
relegated Beauty and the Beast stories to folklore and children's tales.

85
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:20,020
But there was also the rise of a sort of Byronic monster at the same time, as we saw with the creature in Mary Shelley's

86
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:27,540
Frankenstein, who, while a creature with pathos, is still an unholy abomination that needed to be vanquished. Though written by a woman, this monster

87
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:34,900
isn't really positioned against fear or anxiety specific to womanhood. Shelley famously wrote Frankenstein, or the modern Prometheus during a writing

88
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,700
contest put forth by Lord Byron.

89
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:42,900
She came up with the idea when she was listening to a conversation between Percy Shelley and Lord Byron talking about some rumored scientific

90
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,820
experiments that may eventually lead to corpses being brought back to life, and it freaked her out so much

91
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,460
she had nightmares about it. In the preface to the 1831 reprint of the book,

92
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:57,740
Shelley wrote of her nightmare that she saw the creature show signs of life and stir with an uneasy half-vital motion.

93
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:04,700
Frightful must it be, for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavor to mock the stupendous mechanism of the creator of the

94
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,700
world.

95
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:12,340
Frankenstein was written at a time when there was a lot of mass anxiety about the scientific world rubbing up against a religious one, and

96
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,140
Frankenstein's monster is very much an embodiment of that anxiety.

97
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:22,940
Frankenstein was a seminal science fiction novel, and its monster was not only a milestone for how we envision monsters,

98
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,760
but it was also a milestone for how media envisions monsters,

99
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,580
especially once Hollywood came into the picture. And with American visual mass media came the rise of the monster movie.

100
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,860
And yes, you have your opera phantoms, your Nosferatu's, your

101
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,500
Frankenstein's, all monsters who terrorize women.

102
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:47,020
But we should we should also talk about Birth of a Nation. Birth of a Nation is a significant movie in many regards,

103
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,900
but in this case,

104
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,540
I want to focus on the character Gus, played by a white man in blackface,

105
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,040
who chases a white woman into the hills with the intent of raping her.

106
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,260
She would rather die, and she jumps to her death to escape. In response to this, the heroic

107
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:05,840
KKK hunts Gus down and lynches him. This is framed in the film as good and heroic. And

108
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,640
of course, the

109
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,680
monster in this movie very much exemplifies the anxieties of white America at the beginning of the 20th century.

110
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,980
Hey boys,

111
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,720
look what I got here.

112
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,720
Hey, where are the white women at? Birth of a Nation is kind of under-discussed, at least recently, as to

113
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,920
why it was so important for the formation of film,

114
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:37,680
but a super under-discussed element is the way that it would eventually lead to the coding in monster movies, and the way that

115
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,560
monsters relate to women as symbols of purity.

116
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:47,200
To white women. Flash forward a few decades, and being quite so literal with what it is

117
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,560
we're worried is going to come after our white women is perhaps a little gauche.

118
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:59,160
Hey, where are the white women at? Enter the real movie monster of Hollywood, the beast what was killed by beauty, King Kong, and

119
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,800
20 years after that, we have a whole host of sci-fi B movies.

120
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,920
Oh, the women what were carried away screaming by these inhuman monsters.

121
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:13,160
So, societal fears and how they play into popular culture of the 1950s is a very, very big topic,

122
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,200
so I'm going to try and keep this concise. In the post-World War II era,

123
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:23,480
we had this booming economy and really conservative culture rubbing up against the end of the colonial era. Fears of the commies, the anxieties concerning

124
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,440
desegregation and miscegenation,

125
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:33,240
the atomic bomb, and so on. Throughout the media of the 30s and the 50s, the difference, or lack thereof, between the primitive and

126
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,160
the civilized was a popular theme.

127
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:40,440
So it's not a huge coincidence that so many monsters of the 30s, 40s, and 50s came from Africa, or

128
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,400
west of Sumatra, or in the creatures case, the Amazon.

129
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,880
A non-comprehensive list of films featuring missing link style monsters would include Bride of the Gorilla, The Neanderthal Man,

130
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,800
Monster on the Campus, and of course, King Kong.

131
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,640
And this is to say nothing about the aliens that totally don't represent our anxieties about the impending communist invasion.

132
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,800
They have to be destroyed. All of them. They will be. Everyone.

133
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,800
But the most iconic from this era is the Creature from the Black Lagoon.

134
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,120
According to film historian Fatima Tobingroni, the basic narrative of the Creature series,

135
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:19,280
especially the first two films, is fueled by the violence of the Gill Man's attraction to and pursuit of the female lead, and the heroes

136
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:25,360
need to protect her from the monster. All of these films use womanhood as a sort of avatar for a precious status quo.

137
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,440
That must be protected. And not just womanhood, white womanhood.

138
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:36,900
Roney contends that the portrayal of figures such as Anne Darrow and King Kong reveals a cinematic fascination with beautiful white women as

139
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,720
unconscious source of disorder.

140
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,140
Both the Creature from the Black Lagoon and the Revenge of the Creature end with a monster presumably killed by white men,

141
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,560
galvanized into action by the abduction of the various female leads.

142
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,800
Hmm.

143
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,580
So it's not a huge stretch to draw a direct line from this...

144
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,580
...

145
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,340
...to this...

146
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,140
...to this.

147
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:03,780
And again, to paraphrase Tolkien, I do not wish to confuse applicability with allegory.

148
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:11,060
I do not think that the filmmakers deliberately went out to code the Creature from the Black Lagoon as a person of color that is threatening

149
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:17,600
white female purity. That said, that does not mean that the Creature is bereft of coding, intentional or no.

150
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,800
So, for the difference between coding and allegory, skipped about to the 24-minute mark in the bright video.

151
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,600
It's over here.

152
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:35,720
But these monsters, unlike the black-faced rhathus gusts in Birth of a Nation, are portrayed with pathos, like a B-movie

153
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,360
Shakespearean tragedy. King Kong's death is treated like an inevitability,

154
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,000
but a tragic one. When Kong and the Creature are brought into violent contact with modernity, disaster occurs.

155
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,280
They are incompatible with it, and then they are inevitably destroyed.

156
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:54,480
There is a fear of the primitive and unknown embodied by the monster, but don't worry, modernity will mow it down in the end.

157
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,800
So what changed? How did we get from this to this?

158
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Part of the major shift in storytelling and monster stories is the re-examination of what monsterhood actually entails.

159
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I bring you love.

160
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's bringing love, don't let it get away!

161
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Break its legs!

162
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Namely, internal versus external monsterhood, a theme that is made explicit in Disney's Beauty and the Beast.

163
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances, for beauty is found within.

164
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
In Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame.

165
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Who is the monster and who is the man?

166
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And in The Shape of Water.

167
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And the tale of love and loss.

168
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And the monster.

169
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Who tried to destroy it all.

170
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What we typically saw in those old B movies from the 1950s was that there was a strapping white hero in opposite to the brutish beast that lusted after beauty.

171
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
But somewhere along the line we began to realize the insidious undertones of this whole dynamic.

172
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The monster who was minding his own business is then kidnapped into modernity,

173
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
the strapping hero who only knows how to solve problems through violence,

174
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
the passive woman who existed only to be carried away screaming by the monster.

175
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So later versions of Beauty Beast monster stories changed a lot.

176
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Beauty is no longer so self-sacrificing, the jealous bitches are either relegated to ascended extras,

177
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What's wrong with her?

178
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
She's crazy!

179
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
She's gorgeous!

180
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
removed altogether or actually loving and supportive.

181
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
The character of Zelda in The Shape of Water is a total inversion of the jealous bitch archetype,

182
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
even going so far as to act as an accomplice to protagonist Eliza at great risk to herself.

183
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
We also see a rising trend of an outside antagonistic force.

184
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Disney was not the original innovator of a hyper-masculine yet foppish authoritarian Gaston in opposition to the beast.

185
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
That, like many things, was taken from the Jean Cocteau adaptation.

186
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
But the handsome, or at least normal-looking villain,

187
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
became a popular addition to these stories to play up this idea of internal versus external monsterhood,

188
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
another obstacle for the couple who effectively embodies an unaccepting society.

189
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So, starting with the media revolutions of the late 60s and 70s,

190
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
there is renewed interest in finding humanity, even the attraction, in the things that scare us.

191
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's probably just from some nearby cottage.

192
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's nothing to worry about.

193
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Where are you going?

194
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
All you men are all alike.

195
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Seven or eight quick ones and you're off with the boys to boast and brag.

196
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You better keep your mouth shut!

197
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Oh, I think I love him.

198
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But actually depicting attraction to a monster in a visual medium?

199
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Uh, it's really hard to do that well and not be completely awkward.

200
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The 1976 remake of King Kong attempted to depict Kong and Dwan's attraction as somewhat mutual.

201
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
This is the very hotness. Hit me with that gorilla breath.

202
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Perhaps the Urine version of the 1950s movie monster in the 1980s is Swamp Thing and his many knockoffs,

203
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
wherein the romantic hero gets turned into a monster,

204
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and then he and his lady friend spend the entire rest of the movie fighting off bad guys in a swamp.

205
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
In the 1980s, CBS had a primetime version of Beauty and the Beast starring Linda Hamilton,

206
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
opposite sexy manimal Ron Perlman.

207
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Catherine.

208
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Where the Beast, Vincent, remains in a constant state of beastliness and Beauty, Catherine,

209
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
lives a dual life between her day career as a New York City assistant district attorney

210
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
and her night career wearing silky pajamas.

211
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Here, the Beast saves her from a violent assault and nurses her back to health

212
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
and he wants Catherine to be happy and supports her in her daytime career as badass lady lawyer.

213
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
This is so unbearably sincere. I cannot believe this exists.

214
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
What bombed out wine mom wrote this?

215
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Really?

216
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Also mega popular at this point in history is the Phantom of the Opera on Broadway.

217
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
By the late 1980s, the Phantom has evolved.

218
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
He's no longer the evil, gollum-y wretch of the Lon Chaney movie who gets torn apart by an angry mob.

219
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Now he's basically the romantic hero and one third of a love triangle.

220
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
He still doesn't get the girl in the end, but he is much more human, tragic, and empathetic.

221
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Most importantly, he is romantic.

222
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And then, of course, comes the Disney movie.

223
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
She's so beautiful and I'm...

224
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Well, look at me!

225
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Oh, you must help her to see past all that.

226
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I don't know how.

227
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
A few years after that, DreamWorks Animation built effectively a cottage industry around fairy tale inversion.

228
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
First with Shrek, a Beauty and the Beast story which ends with Beauty turning into a beast at the end.

229
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm supposed to be beautiful.

230
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
But you are beautiful.

231
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
After that, we saw Megamind, which also has a story of transformative empathy

232
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
and includes a major plot element of trying to look normal.

233
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Just a technical glitch. Don't look yet.

234
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
But in the end, he does get the girl despite not changing his appearance.

235
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And then there's Monsters vs. Aliens, which features...

236
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
The rare female monster.

237
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Susan's story is effectively about being comfortable in her own skin.

238
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You're doing great.

239
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm doing everything!

240
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Around this time in Beauty and the Beastim, there was also this really lame trend in visual media that kind of walked back.

241
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
There was a CW Beauty and the Beast series where the Beast has got like a scar

242
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
and I guess he's a beast because he hulks out sometimes.

243
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I can kill you in less than a second!

244
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And then there was Beastly, starring Vanessa Hudgens.

245
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And the Beast is only a beast in that he has these rad, sexy scars and badass beast tattoos.

246
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
This isn't Beastly.

247
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I want my manimal!

248
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Whoa, not that manimal. Never mind.

249
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Actually, Romeo and Juliet's my favorite play.

250
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Why is that not a surprise?

251
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Ah yes, my fantasy. A beast that megs.

252
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,000
In more recent years, we've seen the curious, unabashed rise of self-published monster erotica on places like Amazon.

253
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
We also now have super popular anime and manga, Ancient Magus Bride,

254
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
the author of which claims she was inspired to write it because she was disappointed with Beauty and the Beast stories,

255
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
always ending with the Beast turning back into a prince at the end.

256
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And then, of course, The Shape of Water.

257
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The Shape of Water playing monster romance straight is not the first.

258
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Hell, it's not even the first for Guillermo del Toro, who is eponymous monster man, also played by Ron Perlman,

259
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I wish I could do something about this.

260
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
got the girl at the end of Hellboy,

261
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
while the white guy who would have been the hero in a 1950s monster movie looks on sadly.

262
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Del Toro stated that the whole idea for The Shape of Water came to him after feeling sympathy for the Gill-man

263
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
when he saw the creature from the Black Lagoon as a child.

264
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Del Toro has always had a special fascination, and even sympathy for monsters,

265
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
and he was well aware of the racial coding in the original Creature series,

266
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
which is why The Shape of Water turns into a deliberate inversion.

267
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
According to del Toro,

268
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
There's always been coding in stories like this,

269
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
so it's no coincidence that eventually people from marginalized communities,

270
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
immigrants, queer people, people of color,

271
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
would not only see themselves in movie monsters,

272
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
but kind of lean into this and then really start to invert what we even expect from monsters.

273
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Because there is some truth to this idea that there's allegory there to being a queer person,

274
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
a person of color in America, or both.

275
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Hello?

276
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
My name is Kenzie. It's La'Ron from the YouTube channel ReadUs101.

277
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
So, my M'Baku senses were tingling earlier,

278
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
and I was just calling to make sure you weren't trying to speak for a group of individuals that you don't necessarily represent.

279
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
No! No! I wouldn't. I'm woke. I'm the wokest.

280
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Oh, good. That's great to hear.

281
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Well, considering that I'm actually a queer person of color living in America,

282
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
do you mind hearing my opinions on the matter?

283
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Yes, by all means. Go ahead.

284
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Well, it's definitely like you stated earlier.

285
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Monster movies are the perfect allegory for what it's like being queer, a person of color, or both in America.

286
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Depending on the era the movie takes place in, racism and LGBT phobia ostracized a lot of individuals.

287
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And it's because of that ostracization that it makes sense that those affected would find the monsters in monster movies relatable.

288
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
After being called an abomination for being attracted to the same sex,

289
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
you might find the actual walking abomination that is Frankenstein's monster,

290
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
and how he's treated throughout the film as relatable.

291
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
The original or Peter Jackson's 2005 remake,

292
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
King Kong's capture, enslavement, and the bond that he forms with Anne

293
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
says a lot about not only the obvious oppression of African Americans,

294
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:00,000
but is also a very well done allegory for the at-the-time taboo subject of interracial relationships.

295
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Well, maybe the 2005 movie more than the original.

296
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Actually, forget I said that.

297
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Speaking of relationships, didn't you just do a video about the shape of water

298
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
and why certain people might be attracted to monsters like that in the first place?

299
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Oh yeah, I did. I...

300
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
How did you do that?

301
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The same way you called me in the middle of a pre-written and recorded video essay.

302
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So does this mean that The Fish Man does it for you?

303
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Anything you've heard about novel-length Starscream fanfic is a lie!

304
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Moving on.

305
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Part of what makes this movie unique is the intentionality with which it approaches coding.

306
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You see this in mainstream romance novels too,

307
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
but romances written for women, especially Beauty and the Beast stories,

308
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
tend to have a theme of the transformative aspect of love,

309
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
this being the whole thrust behind Fifty Shades of Grey, for better or worse.

310
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And again, to be clear, that shit is my jam.

311
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I still pay to see Phantom of the Opera on Broadway.

312
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Depending on who's the phantom.

313
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It is relevant that the monster of Del Toro's romance does not transform,

314
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
either physically or internally.

315
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Del Toro was more interested in the empathy being there from the outset,

316
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
and the creature being accepted for who and what he is without having to change.

317
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And that is reflective of changing sensitivities.

318
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
People are more interested in relating to the monster's pain than in hunting down and killing him.

319
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Or, sometimes, her.

320
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
A monster is always an embodiment of some kind of anxiety,

321
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
but the fate of the monster depends on the anxiety and what angle is it approached from,

322
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
and what moral, the culture, and the storyteller wants to push.

323
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
The interesting change we're seeing now is concern for the well-being of the monster,

324
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
which I think speaks to a broader trend of more empathetic storytelling.

325
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
At the very least, it's a more interesting way to write the monster.

326
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Thank you for watching.
