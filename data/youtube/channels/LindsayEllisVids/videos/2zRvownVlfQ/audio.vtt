WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.320
I mean, we were like, we could play it cool and act like we didn't already shoot this

00:07.320 --> 00:14.380
episode months ago, but it's currently on this thing, which we are having a hard time

00:14.380 --> 00:18.780
getting it off of, because the other two shoot to SD cards, this sucker shoots on tape.

00:18.780 --> 00:21.400
And it's not cooperating, so.

00:21.400 --> 00:25.440
So damn you, giant camera A. How dare you.

00:25.440 --> 00:26.440
Camera A is out of commission.

00:26.440 --> 00:27.440
So what do we got?

00:27.440 --> 00:32.560
We finally get to break into the Finnish liquor that our friend Rita brought with her many

00:32.560 --> 00:36.680
months ago, many, many months ago, brought with her on her great New York adventure.

00:36.680 --> 00:38.280
And we met up with her.

00:38.280 --> 00:42.360
And the first one, I think I'm only drinking because it is a licorice one.

00:42.360 --> 00:45.680
It also needs to be served, chilled and shaken.

00:45.680 --> 00:49.520
Oh my God, that is black as sin.

00:49.520 --> 00:50.520
Holy.

00:50.520 --> 00:51.520
Wow.

00:51.520 --> 00:56.320
So that's what they do when the long never ending nights.

00:56.320 --> 00:59.960
So, and like Finland will laugh at my pronunciation.

00:59.960 --> 01:04.960
From what I understand, this is called, uh, Salmari?

01:04.960 --> 01:09.600
Cold spiteful language.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.600
It's um.

01:10.600 --> 01:14.360
Is this like, is the backwards K like a backwards K like corn?

01:14.360 --> 01:15.680
It's rad.

01:15.680 --> 01:16.680
You know what?

01:16.680 --> 01:17.680
It is Finland.

01:17.680 --> 01:18.680
I feel like that could be.

01:18.680 --> 01:19.680
They did give us Lordi.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.760
Anyway, I just want to read the thing on the back of it though.

01:21.760 --> 01:33.000
Deep in its dark licorice infused heart, is an unforgettable drinking experience waiting

01:33.000 --> 01:34.200
to be released.

01:34.200 --> 01:37.000
Drink as shots, but don't be misled.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.640
Experience the spirit of Finland and taste Finnish folklore.

01:39.640 --> 01:43.240
This is appropriate since we're talking about a book that's going to take place in India.

01:43.240 --> 01:44.240
I know.

01:44.240 --> 01:45.240
Which is the opposite of Finland.

01:45.240 --> 01:46.240
How appropriate of us.

01:46.240 --> 01:49.760
I'm embracing the heart of Finland right now.

01:50.760 --> 01:51.760
Oh!

01:51.760 --> 01:55.760
So that's the heart of Finland.

01:55.760 --> 01:56.760
Okay.

01:56.760 --> 01:57.760
How's the heart of Finland?

01:57.760 --> 01:58.760
It's licorice.

01:58.760 --> 02:03.040
It's, um, it's, it's got the, the winter chill on it.

02:03.040 --> 02:09.360
Also the, the, the bitter of forever night, the boredom of never seeing the sun.

02:09.360 --> 02:10.360
Yeah.

02:10.360 --> 02:11.680
It's a lot nicer than Jaeger.

02:11.680 --> 02:12.680
Oh yeah.

02:12.680 --> 02:13.680
Oh, you know what?

02:13.680 --> 02:14.680
Yeah, totally.

02:14.680 --> 02:15.680
So.

02:15.680 --> 02:16.680
Like considerably.

02:16.680 --> 02:17.680
So.

02:17.680 --> 02:18.680
All right.

02:18.680 --> 02:19.680
And then we have our other things courtesy of Rita.

02:20.600 --> 02:21.600
Wall stuff, because we need wall stuff.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.600
Like, yeah.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.280
Including the fan art from Nella's Tiger's Courtesy Cats.

02:24.280 --> 02:27.640
I've actually got to print some of those up and put them on because they are delightful.

02:27.640 --> 02:32.520
But if you want to give us alcohol from your region of the world, that's okay too.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.520
We totally accept any.

02:33.520 --> 02:36.520
Find a way to ship it.

02:36.520 --> 02:37.680
Technically illegal in New York.

02:37.680 --> 02:43.320
When we last left off last season, which is totally deliberate that we divvied this up

02:43.320 --> 02:44.680
between several months.

02:44.680 --> 02:51.760
When we last left off, it was, um, we were going to A, talk about, uh, some people's

02:51.760 --> 02:57.400
ideas for the outline and B, we were going to review The Girl with All the Gifts, which

02:57.400 --> 02:59.240
we will do next episode.

02:59.240 --> 03:02.000
Also a lot of stuff, like we're, we're leaving Channel Awesome.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
So that's a thing.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Yeah.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.160
Uh, if you're watching this on Channel Awesome, you might want to start following us on Twitter

03:07.160 --> 03:08.160
or something.

03:08.160 --> 03:09.160
Yeah.

03:09.160 --> 03:10.160
Uh, follow us over to Shea Apocalypse.

03:10.160 --> 03:11.160
Yeah.

03:12.040 --> 03:14.560
This will probably be the last episode on Channel Awesome.

03:14.560 --> 03:15.960
So it's been real y'all.

03:15.960 --> 03:16.960
Yeah.

03:16.960 --> 03:20.920
We're going to still go just, you know, uh, as, as separate entities flying free.

03:20.920 --> 03:21.920
We're leaving the nest.

03:21.920 --> 03:22.920
Yeah.

03:22.920 --> 03:27.640
We had a bunch of comments that were just ideas for Awoken book two, which what was

03:27.640 --> 03:28.640
it?

03:28.640 --> 03:30.920
Was it going to be, it was either Arisen or Aliven.

03:30.920 --> 03:31.920
Yeah.

03:31.920 --> 03:32.920
We haven't decided yet.

03:32.920 --> 03:33.920
Yeah.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.960
We still haven't, you know, we haven't, or another Mary.

03:35.960 --> 03:40.280
No, I feel like another has to be book three.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.920
I just feel like after two, like when we actually get around to writing three, people would

03:43.920 --> 03:44.920
be like another?

03:44.920 --> 03:47.560
Cause it's been a little while.

03:47.560 --> 03:53.000
Uh, what was the basic thrust of the book or this plot?

03:53.000 --> 03:57.720
And you know, obviously it will, you will appreciate it more if you follow Nella's Tiger's

03:57.720 --> 03:58.720
Curse recaps.

03:58.720 --> 03:59.720
Yes.

03:59.720 --> 04:00.720
Which I also took a break from.

04:00.720 --> 04:04.800
It's like, you know, that scene where Sam and Frodo are on the mountains, like the slopes

04:04.800 --> 04:09.560
of Mount Doom and it's like, no, I can't remember, you know, the taste of food.

04:09.840 --> 04:14.240
Or, you know, water or light.

04:14.240 --> 04:16.320
That's what Tiger's Curse has been for me.

04:16.320 --> 04:21.680
And we had to, you had to finish that cause it's like this, this book is more like where

04:21.680 --> 04:23.680
Awoken was more parody of Twilight.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.720
This one is more parody of Tiger's Curse.

04:25.720 --> 04:30.480
So if you're curious as to what that means, definitely go check up the recaps of Tiger's

04:30.480 --> 04:32.040
Curse under Let's Read with Nella.

04:32.040 --> 04:36.680
I've, uh, I've been getting comments from people saying like, just your recaps are painful

04:36.680 --> 04:37.680
for us.

04:37.680 --> 04:38.880
Like this book is terrible.

04:38.880 --> 04:40.480
The most amazingly redundant book.

04:40.480 --> 04:41.680
Oh, it's so redundant.

04:41.680 --> 04:49.760
So the basic plot of Awoken book two, um, Arisen or Aliven, kind of like Aliven, cause

04:49.760 --> 04:53.600
I feel like that was, that was a big complaint with the first one was that it was too stealth

04:53.600 --> 04:54.600
a parody.

04:54.600 --> 04:55.600
Yeah.

04:55.600 --> 04:56.600
And like, maybe it's just like, you know what?

04:56.600 --> 04:58.600
We had our fun being kind of a stealth parody.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.160
Maybe let's go a little more cracked out.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.160
Yeah.

05:01.160 --> 05:04.680
So the thrust of book two is, you know, it starts with this sort of breaking dawn thing

05:04.680 --> 05:10.440
where, um, not Edward, Riley leaves her for her own good again, because he did that in

05:10.440 --> 05:11.440
the first book.

05:11.440 --> 05:14.720
Although I'm really, after reading, uh, Tiger's Curse, I really do feel like it has to be

05:14.720 --> 05:21.480
like the rich, like family member, like the ex-Bollywood uncle who flies in a school trip

05:21.480 --> 05:22.480
to India.

05:22.480 --> 05:26.080
You will, you want to just like an excuse for Mr. Kadam.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.080
Yes, I do.

05:27.080 --> 05:28.080
Who needs an excuse?

05:28.080 --> 05:32.080
Mr. Kadam is the only redeeming factor of Tiger's Curse.

05:32.080 --> 05:33.080
No, we could have that.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.080
And then it turns out it was Uncle Neil the whole time.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.080
Mm.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.080
Like he wanted to get some balls rolling.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.080
Uh, yeah.

05:39.080 --> 05:41.080
Like, oh, it was me all along.

05:41.080 --> 05:43.080
I was the turkey.

05:43.080 --> 05:47.080
But then would Uncle Neil then be able to drive a car out of the Ganges?

05:47.080 --> 05:53.080
Because I really have this mental image in my head of him driving a car out of the Ganges

05:53.080 --> 05:54.080
and it's kind of delightful.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.080
Well, I don't know.

05:55.080 --> 05:56.080
Here's the thing.

05:56.080 --> 06:01.080
I kind of feel like Uncle Neil and a Kadama-like are a little mutually exclusive.

06:01.080 --> 06:02.080
Mm.

06:02.080 --> 06:05.080
But then, you know, both characters would be kind of redundant since Uncle Neil was

06:05.080 --> 06:09.080
the awesome character that you wanted the book to be about and who keeps getting cut

06:09.080 --> 06:10.080
off.

06:10.080 --> 06:15.080
So the basic thrust is we go to India, somehow or other there's like a super powerful thing

06:15.080 --> 06:20.080
that happens and everyone assumes that Andy is the special Lego movie style because she

06:20.080 --> 06:26.080
is the, you know, she's the white girl that outnatives the natives a la Avatar and all

06:26.080 --> 06:27.080
that fun stuff.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.080
Mm.

06:29.080 --> 06:32.080
But then eventually the plot happens and we find out that Vic is the special.

06:32.080 --> 06:33.080
Yeah.

06:33.080 --> 06:37.080
But like everything just lines up just so it makes it seem like it was her.

06:37.080 --> 06:39.080
Yeah, and everyone just assumes it's her.

06:39.080 --> 06:40.080
Except for Bri.

06:40.080 --> 06:42.080
I think Bri would be the one like foreshadowing things.

06:42.080 --> 06:43.080
I don't know.

06:43.080 --> 06:46.080
It's like, this prophecy says born of this land.

06:46.080 --> 06:48.080
My great grandmother's Cherokee.

06:50.080 --> 06:51.080
Oh, God.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.080
Oh, God.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.080
Oh, God.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.080
It's like Andy should have like a great great something that was like English but she like

06:56.080 --> 06:57.080
was born in India.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.080
I think.

07:01.080 --> 07:02.080
So that's why she thinks.

07:02.080 --> 07:03.080
I don't know.

07:03.080 --> 07:07.080
I'm still kind of enamored with Cherokee princess, but I don't even know if Andy is that dense.

07:07.080 --> 07:08.080
I know.

07:08.080 --> 07:11.080
Well, things to ponder.

07:11.080 --> 07:14.080
Which kind of Indian should Andy claim?

07:14.080 --> 07:19.080
Hayley Combs suggests that all the other kids in Andy's class be respectful and understanding

07:19.080 --> 07:23.080
of Indian culture in the background, but Andy is just the hapless white savior princess

07:23.080 --> 07:25.080
who has no idea of anything at all.

07:25.080 --> 07:31.080
Do we want to do like the totally like over-the-top like caste discrimination?

07:31.080 --> 07:35.080
Like, should there be like overt caste discrimination?

07:35.080 --> 07:39.080
I don't think Sarah would know about the caste system.

07:40.080 --> 07:44.080
No, but I feel like, I mean, I feel like that's that thing that Westerners like.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.080
I don't know.

07:45.080 --> 07:46.080
It's like Colleen Houk didn't.

07:46.080 --> 07:49.080
She kind of like mentioned it in this like I read a Wikipedia article.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.080
Or that like, well this happened in the past.

07:51.080 --> 07:53.080
Like she'd like conflate Varnas with caste.

07:53.080 --> 07:56.080
You know, like, okay, there's four Varnas, but there's like 90 bajillion castes.

07:56.080 --> 07:58.080
And she's like, well, they're the same thing.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.080
Yeah.

07:59.080 --> 08:02.080
You know, and like, and like I read the Wikipedia article.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.080
It's like, I'm Kshatriya.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.080
And like, and then that's all you need to know.

08:06.080 --> 08:08.080
I mean, maybe someone could be like, wait a minute.

08:08.080 --> 08:11.080
That, you know, it's like, there's a lot of castes and Varnas and castes.

08:11.080 --> 08:12.080
Like, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

08:12.080 --> 08:13.080
That should be Bree.

08:13.080 --> 08:14.080
Bree should always be the voice of Bree.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.080
Yeah.

08:15.080 --> 08:22.080
And Toli Berra, also speaking of Bree, suggests that Vic and Bree maybe hook up as a sort

08:22.080 --> 08:25.080
of parody of Renesmee Jacob.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.080
We got to find a way to make that creepy if we're going to go that way.

08:27.080 --> 08:28.080
I know.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.080
Creepy-er.

08:29.080 --> 08:30.080
It has to be creepy.

08:30.080 --> 08:31.080
But let's get back to the TIFF.

08:31.080 --> 08:32.080
Okay.

08:32.080 --> 08:38.080
Because, you know, in the beginning, like, I think the idea was that he would, or that

08:38.080 --> 08:42.080
Riley would accidentally try to soul snack on Andy.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.080
Uh-huh.

08:43.080 --> 08:44.080
Well, they were together.

08:44.080 --> 08:45.080
Oh, yeah.

08:45.080 --> 08:46.080
Like she's.

08:46.080 --> 08:50.080
But Toli Berra writes that Riley's no soul snacks.

08:50.080 --> 08:54.080
I think he should go after criminals because, and I quote, I selected them because I want

08:54.080 --> 08:55.080
to make the world safer for you.

08:55.080 --> 08:56.080
Yeah.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.080
And, like, the TIFF maybe.

08:57.080 --> 08:58.080
Either she'd be that super romantic.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.080
No, no, she's like.

08:59.080 --> 09:02.080
No, I think it's like he almost soul snacks her, like, in their sleep or something.

09:02.080 --> 09:03.080
Yeah.

09:03.080 --> 09:04.080
And then, like, afterwards, while he's gone out.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.080
Like he sleep snacks.

09:05.080 --> 09:07.080
Yeah, he goes out and states his lust.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.080
He's like, I found some petty thieves.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.080
Yeah.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.080
They were arrested on minor drug charges.

09:12.080 --> 09:14.080
Oh, my God.

09:14.080 --> 09:15.080
They were 16.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.080
Oh, God.

09:17.080 --> 09:21.080
And she's like, well, that's great that you only go after criminals.

09:21.080 --> 09:22.080
I don't know.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.080
I like the idea that he only goes.

09:24.080 --> 09:25.080
But.

09:25.080 --> 09:26.080
He only goes after criminals.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.080
But.

09:27.080 --> 09:28.080
But it's like drug.

09:28.080 --> 09:32.080
That would certainly knock off a whole bunch of people of our Patreon folks that have been

09:32.080 --> 09:33.080
donating money.

09:33.080 --> 09:34.080
That's a good point.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.080
So.

09:35.080 --> 09:36.080
The petty criminal.

09:36.080 --> 09:37.080
Again, we all.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.080
Some of you might be petty criminals.

09:38.080 --> 09:42.080
We didn't promise that the people who Patreon on that top level would get to die.

09:42.080 --> 09:45.080
Like, not only are they going to be written into the book, but they get to die a horrible

09:45.080 --> 09:46.080
being eaten by Cthulhu death.

09:46.080 --> 09:47.080
So that's.

09:47.080 --> 09:48.080
That's not incentive.

09:48.080 --> 09:49.080
I don't know what is.

09:49.080 --> 09:51.080
Aurelia Verity writes that.

09:51.080 --> 09:55.080
At first, Andy speaks about how clearly important it is to do missionary work and help people

09:55.080 --> 09:58.080
and how they're going to change people's lives while they're there.

09:58.080 --> 10:01.080
And clearly, at this point, these will be Sarah's words.

10:01.080 --> 10:03.080
And Andy is just the mouthpiece.

10:03.080 --> 10:04.080
And like that whole idea.

10:04.080 --> 10:07.080
Like, well, maybe there's a missionary element.

10:07.080 --> 10:08.080
Like.

10:08.080 --> 10:09.080
She doesn't use that word.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.080
Like building houses.

10:10.080 --> 10:11.080
It's like Habitat for Humanity.

10:11.080 --> 10:12.080
Yeah.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.080
It's a field trip.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.080
It's weird.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.080
It's like whatever.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.080
They're building wells.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.080
We do that.

10:17.080 --> 10:18.080
That's a really popular thing to do.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.080
Like.

10:19.080 --> 10:23.080
Arthur Limbo suggests that the whole India thing is framed like the Lizzie McGuire movie.

10:23.080 --> 10:26.080
And, you know, and there's like this part.

10:26.080 --> 10:30.080
For instance, there's this part where Lizzie rides on a motorcycle with like a random stranger.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.080
She gets to ride on like an elephant with Vic.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.080
Yeah.

10:33.080 --> 10:34.080
Ethnic third wheel.

10:34.080 --> 10:37.080
Well, going back to Aurelia, they write.

10:37.080 --> 10:41.080
Although they're on a school trip, Vic and Andy just wander off, off into different cities

10:41.080 --> 10:42.080
and temples for hours and days.

10:42.080 --> 10:45.080
And no teacher or supervisor cares or notices.

10:45.080 --> 10:47.080
Which, yes, I think that absolutely needs.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.080
So like.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.080
And then there's an elephant that happens.

10:49.080 --> 10:50.080
I think there needs.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.080
There has to be a romantic elephant at some point.

10:52.080 --> 10:55.080
And also like just to run with Tiger's Curse.

10:55.080 --> 10:57.080
Absolutely no forms are signed.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.080
No worries about passports.

10:59.080 --> 11:01.080
No worries about paperwork.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.080
Yeah.

11:02.080 --> 11:05.080
It's just like a week before the plane takes off.

11:05.080 --> 11:10.080
Like someone's like, hey, kids, let's dig wells in India.

11:11.080 --> 11:12.080
Over spring break.

11:12.080 --> 11:15.080
And you're like, yeah, that's the legitist thing.

11:15.080 --> 11:21.080
Shiksabell suggests possibly inappropriate comparison between Andy and Riley's relationship

11:21.080 --> 11:22.080
and the Ramayana.

11:22.080 --> 11:25.080
But perhaps that would be giving Sarah too much credit.

11:25.080 --> 11:26.080
I agree.

11:26.080 --> 11:27.080
But she could just get it wildly wrong.

11:27.080 --> 11:29.080
I think that's a wiki article.

11:29.080 --> 11:30.080
Yeah.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.080
Yeah.

11:31.080 --> 11:36.080
Inujade points out that you could in-universe call Loki and his elk the young gods as opposed

11:36.080 --> 11:38.080
to the Lovecraftian old gods.

11:38.080 --> 11:46.080
Because remember, the joke or our basic plot was there was going to be some like pseudo

11:46.080 --> 11:47.080
Indian bad guy.

11:47.080 --> 11:49.080
And then it turns out it was Loki the whole time.

11:49.080 --> 11:50.080
And that's going to be the plot.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.080
Yeah.

11:51.080 --> 11:52.080
And he's trying to bring about Ragnarok.

11:52.080 --> 11:54.080
But then going back to the god thing.

11:54.080 --> 11:59.080
And Piano Slave points out, going off the multiple god idea, maybe there can be a council

11:59.080 --> 12:03.080
where all the different gods get together and talk like in the vampire council thing

12:03.080 --> 12:04.080
in New Moon.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.080
Or we could save that for the third book.

12:06.080 --> 12:07.080
I feel like that could be the opening of the third book.

12:07.080 --> 12:08.080
Like all the gods gathering.

12:08.080 --> 12:11.080
Yeah, like turns out there's like a big god council.

12:11.080 --> 12:13.080
And maybe Sarah actually kind of has like an imagination.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.080
I don't know.

12:14.080 --> 12:19.080
Chrysander the Great brings up the romantic scene between Vic and Andy should be inspired

12:19.080 --> 12:21.080
by the magic carpet ride from Aladdin.

12:21.080 --> 12:22.080
Yes.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.080
Yeah.

12:23.080 --> 12:24.080
Absolutely.

12:24.080 --> 12:25.080
Except it should be a romantic elephant ride under the stars.

12:25.080 --> 12:27.080
So I think we're all on the same page here.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.080
Yeah.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.080
Yeah.

12:29.080 --> 12:30.080
And it should be really direct.

12:30.080 --> 12:34.080
Like, tell me Andy, when did you last let your heart decide?

12:34.080 --> 12:40.080
And finally, Froglet suggests that Andy should be jealous of a woman whose soul Riley is

12:40.080 --> 12:41.080
trying to eat.

12:41.080 --> 12:45.080
Maybe in that sort of, it's not what it looks like scenario.

12:45.080 --> 12:46.080
Absolutely.

12:46.080 --> 12:49.080
I hope she's also a petty drug criminal.

12:49.080 --> 12:53.080
Well, I mean, she has like an ounce of marijuana and deserves to die.

12:53.080 --> 12:54.080
Yeah.

12:54.080 --> 12:58.080
So thus with our little outline begins our season two.

12:58.080 --> 13:00.080
So, yeah.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.080
What would you like to see, Nella?

13:02.080 --> 13:04.080
Is it technically season three at this point?

13:04.080 --> 13:05.080
So thus...

13:09.080 --> 13:10.080
Stuff is strong.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.080
Yeah.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.080
It hurts your head.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.080
Noble liquor.

13:13.080 --> 13:14.080
Noble.

13:14.080 --> 13:18.080
So thus with our little outline, we start our season three.

13:18.080 --> 13:23.080
So at the beginning of season two, we started reviewing things in addition to working on

13:23.080 --> 13:24.080
the Viridian Saga.

13:24.080 --> 13:25.080
Yeah.

13:25.080 --> 13:28.080
What would you like to see this season, Nella?

13:28.080 --> 13:29.080
Oh, gosh.

13:29.080 --> 13:34.080
I think I would just like to see some better books with female protagonists and, you know,

13:34.080 --> 13:39.080
love on the romance and maybe on the sci-fi fantasy element.

13:39.080 --> 13:40.080
Especially on the YA side.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.080
Yeah.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.080
Hashtag never.

13:42.080 --> 13:49.080
Well, there's also, we might branch into interviews more because we did that once last season.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.080
Yeah.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.080
So what do you want us to read?

13:51.080 --> 13:52.080
Yeah.

13:52.080 --> 13:54.080
So now we need to start whittling down our options.

13:54.080 --> 13:57.080
Of course, there is, of course, this.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.080
Ooh, a sequel.

13:58.080 --> 14:01.080
Which we didn't even really discuss the first one except...

14:01.080 --> 14:02.080
I know.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.080
As it pertained to...

14:03.080 --> 14:04.080
Lock-in.

14:04.080 --> 14:05.080
This.

14:05.080 --> 14:08.080
But that is something to consider.

14:08.080 --> 14:13.080
But, of course, also keep in mind that, you know, I am still working on Tiger's Curse.

14:13.080 --> 14:14.080
Yeah.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.080
So if we could...

14:15.080 --> 14:16.080
You might die.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.080
Lay off.

14:17.080 --> 14:19.080
Well, if we could lay off the really terrible books, that'd be nice.

14:19.080 --> 14:20.080
That's a good point.

14:20.080 --> 14:21.080
Yeah.

14:21.080 --> 14:25.080
I feel like while we're making fun of things like Tiger's Curse and writing things like

14:25.080 --> 14:30.080
Awoken, you know, when we do our read-alongs, we want to at least think that...

14:30.080 --> 14:31.080
Experience girl.

14:31.080 --> 14:36.080
Take the genres that we like and make them rise above, you know.

14:36.080 --> 14:40.080
I mean, Shades of Grey filled me with a powerful hate, but it was thoughtful.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.080
It was a thoughtful hate.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.080
It was so powerful.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.080
It was a thoughtful hate.

14:43.080 --> 14:47.080
There was a lot of thinking and discussion and all sorts of fun things.

14:47.080 --> 14:52.080
I think that was the wonderful thing about The Girl with All the Gifts, which we are going to be discussing next time.

14:53.080 --> 14:56.080
So if you can get a hold of it, do and follow along with us.

14:56.080 --> 14:57.080
Yes.

14:57.080 --> 14:58.080
Spoilers.

14:58.080 --> 14:59.080
It is excellent.

14:59.080 --> 15:00.080
It's so good.

15:00.080 --> 15:04.080
Like, it's going to be a really boring episode because it's just going to be gushing.

15:04.080 --> 15:05.080
So...

15:05.080 --> 15:08.080
But oh, the gushing.

15:08.080 --> 15:11.080
It's going to be some profound gushing, so...

15:11.080 --> 15:12.080
Such gush.

15:12.080 --> 15:13.080
Yeah.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.080
So tell us what you'd like us to talk about this season.

15:15.080 --> 15:19.080
If there's any kind of branching out that might interest you, author interviews or genre,

15:19.080 --> 15:21.080
bear in mind we won't branch out too much.

15:21.080 --> 15:22.080
Yeah.

15:22.080 --> 15:25.080
And as always, leave comments at SheaApocalypse.com.

15:25.080 --> 15:29.080
Those are where we actually tabulate the comments because we have a system.

15:29.080 --> 15:34.080
If you're on YouTube, go to SheaApocalypse.com where there are comments allowed.

15:34.080 --> 15:37.080
And as always, follow us on Twitter at SheaApocalypse.

15:37.080 --> 15:39.080
You can follow Sarah on Twitter as well.

15:39.080 --> 15:48.080
Hopefully she will start updating with her observations on the writing life and hashtag amwriting and hashtag blessed and all that fun stuff.

15:48.080 --> 15:52.080
Let's have a good and productive 2015.

15:52.080 --> 15:53.080
Cheers.

15:53.080 --> 15:54.080
Cheers.
