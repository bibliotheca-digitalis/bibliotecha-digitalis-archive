0	7320	I mean, we were like, we could play it cool and act like we didn't already shoot this
7320	14380	episode months ago, but it's currently on this thing, which we are having a hard time
14380	18780	getting it off of, because the other two shoot to SD cards, this sucker shoots on tape.
18780	21400	And it's not cooperating, so.
21400	25440	So damn you, giant camera A. How dare you.
25440	26440	Camera A is out of commission.
26440	27440	So what do we got?
27440	32560	We finally get to break into the Finnish liquor that our friend Rita brought with her many
32560	36680	months ago, many, many months ago, brought with her on her great New York adventure.
36680	38280	And we met up with her.
38280	42360	And the first one, I think I'm only drinking because it is a licorice one.
42360	45680	It also needs to be served, chilled and shaken.
45680	49520	Oh my God, that is black as sin.
49520	50520	Holy.
50520	51520	Wow.
51520	56320	So that's what they do when the long never ending nights.
56320	59960	So, and like Finland will laugh at my pronunciation.
59960	64960	From what I understand, this is called, uh, Salmari?
64960	69600	Cold spiteful language.
69600	70600	It's um.
70600	74360	Is this like, is the backwards K like a backwards K like corn?
74360	75680	It's rad.
75680	76680	You know what?
76680	77680	It is Finland.
77680	78680	I feel like that could be.
78680	79680	They did give us Lordi.
79680	81760	Anyway, I just want to read the thing on the back of it though.
81760	93000	Deep in its dark licorice infused heart, is an unforgettable drinking experience waiting
93000	94200	to be released.
94200	97000	Drink as shots, but don't be misled.
97000	99640	Experience the spirit of Finland and taste Finnish folklore.
99640	103240	This is appropriate since we're talking about a book that's going to take place in India.
103240	104240	I know.
104240	105240	Which is the opposite of Finland.
105240	106240	How appropriate of us.
106240	109760	I'm embracing the heart of Finland right now.
110760	111760	Oh!
111760	115760	So that's the heart of Finland.
115760	116760	Okay.
116760	117760	How's the heart of Finland?
117760	118760	It's licorice.
118760	123040	It's, um, it's, it's got the, the winter chill on it.
123040	129360	Also the, the, the bitter of forever night, the boredom of never seeing the sun.
129360	130360	Yeah.
130360	131680	It's a lot nicer than Jaeger.
131680	132680	Oh yeah.
132680	133680	Oh, you know what?
133680	134680	Yeah, totally.
134680	135680	So.
135680	136680	Like considerably.
136680	137680	So.
137680	138680	All right.
138680	139680	And then we have our other things courtesy of Rita.
140600	141600	Wall stuff, because we need wall stuff.
141600	142600	Like, yeah.
142600	144280	Including the fan art from Nella's Tiger's Courtesy Cats.
144280	147640	I've actually got to print some of those up and put them on because they are delightful.
147640	152520	But if you want to give us alcohol from your region of the world, that's okay too.
152520	153520	We totally accept any.
153520	156520	Find a way to ship it.
156520	157680	Technically illegal in New York.
157680	163320	When we last left off last season, which is totally deliberate that we divvied this up
163320	164680	between several months.
164680	171760	When we last left off, it was, um, we were going to A, talk about, uh, some people's
171760	177400	ideas for the outline and B, we were going to review The Girl with All the Gifts, which
177400	179240	we will do next episode.
179240	182000	Also a lot of stuff, like we're, we're leaving Channel Awesome.
182000	183000	So that's a thing.
183000	184000	Yeah.
184000	187160	Uh, if you're watching this on Channel Awesome, you might want to start following us on Twitter
187160	188160	or something.
188160	189160	Yeah.
189160	190160	Uh, follow us over to Shea Apocalypse.
190160	191160	Yeah.
192040	194560	This will probably be the last episode on Channel Awesome.
194560	195960	So it's been real y'all.
195960	196960	Yeah.
196960	200920	We're going to still go just, you know, uh, as, as separate entities flying free.
200920	201920	We're leaving the nest.
201920	202920	Yeah.
202920	207640	We had a bunch of comments that were just ideas for Awoken book two, which what was
207640	208640	it?
208640	210920	Was it going to be, it was either Arisen or Aliven.
210920	211920	Yeah.
211920	212920	We haven't decided yet.
212920	213920	Yeah.
213920	215960	We still haven't, you know, we haven't, or another Mary.
215960	220280	No, I feel like another has to be book three.
220400	223920	I just feel like after two, like when we actually get around to writing three, people would
223920	224920	be like another?
224920	227560	Cause it's been a little while.
227560	233000	Uh, what was the basic thrust of the book or this plot?
233000	237720	And you know, obviously it will, you will appreciate it more if you follow Nella's Tiger's
237720	238720	Curse recaps.
238720	239720	Yes.
239720	240720	Which I also took a break from.
240720	244800	It's like, you know, that scene where Sam and Frodo are on the mountains, like the slopes
244800	249560	of Mount Doom and it's like, no, I can't remember, you know, the taste of food.
249840	254240	Or, you know, water or light.
254240	256320	That's what Tiger's Curse has been for me.
256320	261680	And we had to, you had to finish that cause it's like this, this book is more like where
261680	263680	Awoken was more parody of Twilight.
263680	265720	This one is more parody of Tiger's Curse.
265720	270480	So if you're curious as to what that means, definitely go check up the recaps of Tiger's
270480	272040	Curse under Let's Read with Nella.
272040	276680	I've, uh, I've been getting comments from people saying like, just your recaps are painful
276680	277680	for us.
277680	278880	Like this book is terrible.
278880	280480	The most amazingly redundant book.
280480	281680	Oh, it's so redundant.
281680	289760	So the basic plot of Awoken book two, um, Arisen or Aliven, kind of like Aliven, cause
289760	293600	I feel like that was, that was a big complaint with the first one was that it was too stealth
293600	294600	a parody.
294600	295600	Yeah.
295600	296600	And like, maybe it's just like, you know what?
296600	298600	We had our fun being kind of a stealth parody.
298600	300160	Maybe let's go a little more cracked out.
300160	301160	Yeah.
301160	304680	So the thrust of book two is, you know, it starts with this sort of breaking dawn thing
304680	310440	where, um, not Edward, Riley leaves her for her own good again, because he did that in
310440	311440	the first book.
311440	314720	Although I'm really, after reading, uh, Tiger's Curse, I really do feel like it has to be
314720	321480	like the rich, like family member, like the ex-Bollywood uncle who flies in a school trip
321480	322480	to India.
322480	326080	You will, you want to just like an excuse for Mr. Kadam.
326080	327080	Yes, I do.
327080	328080	Who needs an excuse?
328080	332080	Mr. Kadam is the only redeeming factor of Tiger's Curse.
332080	333080	No, we could have that.
333080	335080	And then it turns out it was Uncle Neil the whole time.
335080	336080	Mm.
336080	338080	Like he wanted to get some balls rolling.
338080	339080	Uh, yeah.
339080	341080	Like, oh, it was me all along.
341080	343080	I was the turkey.
343080	347080	But then would Uncle Neil then be able to drive a car out of the Ganges?
347080	353080	Because I really have this mental image in my head of him driving a car out of the Ganges
353080	354080	and it's kind of delightful.
354080	355080	Well, I don't know.
355080	356080	Here's the thing.
356080	361080	I kind of feel like Uncle Neil and a Kadama-like are a little mutually exclusive.
361080	362080	Mm.
362080	365080	But then, you know, both characters would be kind of redundant since Uncle Neil was
365080	369080	the awesome character that you wanted the book to be about and who keeps getting cut
369080	370080	off.
370080	375080	So the basic thrust is we go to India, somehow or other there's like a super powerful thing
375080	380080	that happens and everyone assumes that Andy is the special Lego movie style because she
380080	386080	is the, you know, she's the white girl that outnatives the natives a la Avatar and all
386080	387080	that fun stuff.
387080	388080	Mm.
389080	392080	But then eventually the plot happens and we find out that Vic is the special.
392080	393080	Yeah.
393080	397080	But like everything just lines up just so it makes it seem like it was her.
397080	399080	Yeah, and everyone just assumes it's her.
399080	400080	Except for Bri.
400080	402080	I think Bri would be the one like foreshadowing things.
402080	403080	I don't know.
403080	406080	It's like, this prophecy says born of this land.
406080	408080	My great grandmother's Cherokee.
410080	411080	Oh, God.
411080	412080	Oh, God.
412080	413080	Oh, God.
413080	416080	It's like Andy should have like a great great something that was like English but she like
416080	417080	was born in India.
419080	420080	I think.
421080	422080	So that's why she thinks.
422080	423080	I don't know.
423080	427080	I'm still kind of enamored with Cherokee princess, but I don't even know if Andy is that dense.
427080	428080	I know.
428080	431080	Well, things to ponder.
431080	434080	Which kind of Indian should Andy claim?
434080	439080	Hayley Combs suggests that all the other kids in Andy's class be respectful and understanding
439080	443080	of Indian culture in the background, but Andy is just the hapless white savior princess
443080	445080	who has no idea of anything at all.
445080	451080	Do we want to do like the totally like over-the-top like caste discrimination?
451080	455080	Like, should there be like overt caste discrimination?
455080	459080	I don't think Sarah would know about the caste system.
460080	464080	No, but I feel like, I mean, I feel like that's that thing that Westerners like.
464080	465080	I don't know.
465080	466080	It's like Colleen Houk didn't.
466080	469080	She kind of like mentioned it in this like I read a Wikipedia article.
469080	471080	Or that like, well this happened in the past.
471080	473080	Like she'd like conflate Varnas with caste.
473080	476080	You know, like, okay, there's four Varnas, but there's like 90 bajillion castes.
476080	478080	And she's like, well, they're the same thing.
478080	479080	Yeah.
479080	482080	You know, and like, and like I read the Wikipedia article.
482080	484080	It's like, I'm Kshatriya.
484080	486080	And like, and then that's all you need to know.
486080	488080	I mean, maybe someone could be like, wait a minute.
488080	491080	That, you know, it's like, there's a lot of castes and Varnas and castes.
491080	492080	Like, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
492080	493080	That should be Bree.
493080	494080	Bree should always be the voice of Bree.
494080	495080	Yeah.
495080	502080	And Toli Berra, also speaking of Bree, suggests that Vic and Bree maybe hook up as a sort
502080	505080	of parody of Renesmee Jacob.
505080	507080	We got to find a way to make that creepy if we're going to go that way.
507080	508080	I know.
508080	509080	Creepy-er.
509080	510080	It has to be creepy.
510080	511080	But let's get back to the TIFF.
511080	512080	Okay.
512080	518080	Because, you know, in the beginning, like, I think the idea was that he would, or that
518080	522080	Riley would accidentally try to soul snack on Andy.
522080	523080	Uh-huh.
523080	524080	Well, they were together.
524080	525080	Oh, yeah.
525080	526080	Like she's.
526080	530080	But Toli Berra writes that Riley's no soul snacks.
530080	534080	I think he should go after criminals because, and I quote, I selected them because I want
534080	535080	to make the world safer for you.
535080	536080	Yeah.
536080	537080	And, like, the TIFF maybe.
537080	538080	Either she'd be that super romantic.
538080	539080	No, no, she's like.
539080	542080	No, I think it's like he almost soul snacks her, like, in their sleep or something.
542080	543080	Yeah.
543080	544080	And then, like, afterwards, while he's gone out.
544080	545080	Like he sleep snacks.
545080	547080	Yeah, he goes out and states his lust.
547080	549080	He's like, I found some petty thieves.
549080	550080	Yeah.
550080	552080	They were arrested on minor drug charges.
552080	554080	Oh, my God.
554080	555080	They were 16.
555080	556080	Oh, God.
557080	561080	And she's like, well, that's great that you only go after criminals.
561080	562080	I don't know.
562080	564080	I like the idea that he only goes.
564080	565080	But.
565080	566080	He only goes after criminals.
566080	567080	But.
567080	568080	But it's like drug.
568080	572080	That would certainly knock off a whole bunch of people of our Patreon folks that have been
572080	573080	donating money.
573080	574080	That's a good point.
574080	575080	So.
575080	576080	The petty criminal.
576080	577080	Again, we all.
577080	578080	Some of you might be petty criminals.
578080	582080	We didn't promise that the people who Patreon on that top level would get to die.
582080	585080	Like, not only are they going to be written into the book, but they get to die a horrible
585080	586080	being eaten by Cthulhu death.
586080	587080	So that's.
587080	588080	That's not incentive.
588080	589080	I don't know what is.
589080	591080	Aurelia Verity writes that.
591080	595080	At first, Andy speaks about how clearly important it is to do missionary work and help people
595080	598080	and how they're going to change people's lives while they're there.
598080	601080	And clearly, at this point, these will be Sarah's words.
601080	603080	And Andy is just the mouthpiece.
603080	604080	And like that whole idea.
604080	607080	Like, well, maybe there's a missionary element.
607080	608080	Like.
608080	609080	She doesn't use that word.
609080	610080	Like building houses.
610080	611080	It's like Habitat for Humanity.
611080	612080	Yeah.
612080	613080	It's a field trip.
613080	614080	It's weird.
614080	615080	It's like whatever.
615080	616080	They're building wells.
616080	617080	We do that.
617080	618080	That's a really popular thing to do.
618080	619080	Like.
619080	623080	Arthur Limbo suggests that the whole India thing is framed like the Lizzie McGuire movie.
623080	626080	And, you know, and there's like this part.
626080	630080	For instance, there's this part where Lizzie rides on a motorcycle with like a random stranger.
630080	632080	She gets to ride on like an elephant with Vic.
632080	633080	Yeah.
633080	634080	Ethnic third wheel.
634080	637080	Well, going back to Aurelia, they write.
637080	641080	Although they're on a school trip, Vic and Andy just wander off, off into different cities
641080	642080	and temples for hours and days.
642080	645080	And no teacher or supervisor cares or notices.
645080	647080	Which, yes, I think that absolutely needs.
647080	648080	So like.
648080	649080	And then there's an elephant that happens.
649080	650080	I think there needs.
650080	652080	There has to be a romantic elephant at some point.
652080	655080	And also like just to run with Tiger's Curse.
655080	657080	Absolutely no forms are signed.
657080	659080	No worries about passports.
659080	661080	No worries about paperwork.
661080	662080	Yeah.
662080	665080	It's just like a week before the plane takes off.
665080	670080	Like someone's like, hey, kids, let's dig wells in India.
671080	672080	Over spring break.
672080	675080	And you're like, yeah, that's the legitist thing.
675080	681080	Shiksabell suggests possibly inappropriate comparison between Andy and Riley's relationship
681080	682080	and the Ramayana.
682080	685080	But perhaps that would be giving Sarah too much credit.
685080	686080	I agree.
686080	687080	But she could just get it wildly wrong.
687080	689080	I think that's a wiki article.
689080	690080	Yeah.
690080	691080	Yeah.
691080	696080	Inujade points out that you could in-universe call Loki and his elk the young gods as opposed
696080	698080	to the Lovecraftian old gods.
698080	706080	Because remember, the joke or our basic plot was there was going to be some like pseudo
706080	707080	Indian bad guy.
707080	709080	And then it turns out it was Loki the whole time.
709080	710080	And that's going to be the plot.
710080	711080	Yeah.
711080	712080	And he's trying to bring about Ragnarok.
712080	714080	But then going back to the god thing.
714080	719080	And Piano Slave points out, going off the multiple god idea, maybe there can be a council
719080	723080	where all the different gods get together and talk like in the vampire council thing
723080	724080	in New Moon.
724080	726080	Or we could save that for the third book.
726080	727080	I feel like that could be the opening of the third book.
727080	728080	Like all the gods gathering.
728080	731080	Yeah, like turns out there's like a big god council.
731080	733080	And maybe Sarah actually kind of has like an imagination.
733080	734080	I don't know.
734080	739080	Chrysander the Great brings up the romantic scene between Vic and Andy should be inspired
739080	741080	by the magic carpet ride from Aladdin.
741080	742080	Yes.
742080	743080	Yeah.
743080	744080	Absolutely.
744080	745080	Except it should be a romantic elephant ride under the stars.
745080	747080	So I think we're all on the same page here.
747080	748080	Yeah.
748080	749080	Yeah.
749080	750080	And it should be really direct.
750080	754080	Like, tell me Andy, when did you last let your heart decide?
754080	760080	And finally, Froglet suggests that Andy should be jealous of a woman whose soul Riley is
760080	761080	trying to eat.
761080	765080	Maybe in that sort of, it's not what it looks like scenario.
765080	766080	Absolutely.
766080	769080	I hope she's also a petty drug criminal.
769080	773080	Well, I mean, she has like an ounce of marijuana and deserves to die.
773080	774080	Yeah.
774080	778080	So thus with our little outline begins our season two.
778080	780080	So, yeah.
780080	782080	What would you like to see, Nella?
782080	784080	Is it technically season three at this point?
784080	785080	So thus...
789080	790080	Stuff is strong.
790080	791080	Yeah.
791080	792080	It hurts your head.
792080	793080	Noble liquor.
793080	794080	Noble.
794080	798080	So thus with our little outline, we start our season three.
798080	803080	So at the beginning of season two, we started reviewing things in addition to working on
803080	804080	the Viridian Saga.
804080	805080	Yeah.
805080	808080	What would you like to see this season, Nella?
808080	809080	Oh, gosh.
809080	814080	I think I would just like to see some better books with female protagonists and, you know,
814080	819080	love on the romance and maybe on the sci-fi fantasy element.
819080	820080	Especially on the YA side.
820080	821080	Yeah.
821080	822080	Hashtag never.
822080	829080	Well, there's also, we might branch into interviews more because we did that once last season.
829080	830080	Yeah.
830080	831080	So what do you want us to read?
831080	832080	Yeah.
832080	834080	So now we need to start whittling down our options.
834080	837080	Of course, there is, of course, this.
837080	838080	Ooh, a sequel.
838080	841080	Which we didn't even really discuss the first one except...
841080	842080	I know.
842080	843080	As it pertained to...
843080	844080	Lock-in.
844080	845080	This.
845080	848080	But that is something to consider.
848080	853080	But, of course, also keep in mind that, you know, I am still working on Tiger's Curse.
853080	854080	Yeah.
854080	855080	So if we could...
855080	856080	You might die.
856080	857080	Lay off.
857080	859080	Well, if we could lay off the really terrible books, that'd be nice.
859080	860080	That's a good point.
860080	861080	Yeah.
861080	865080	I feel like while we're making fun of things like Tiger's Curse and writing things like
865080	870080	Awoken, you know, when we do our read-alongs, we want to at least think that...
870080	871080	Experience girl.
871080	876080	Take the genres that we like and make them rise above, you know.
876080	880080	I mean, Shades of Grey filled me with a powerful hate, but it was thoughtful.
880080	881080	It was a thoughtful hate.
881080	882080	It was so powerful.
882080	883080	It was a thoughtful hate.
883080	887080	There was a lot of thinking and discussion and all sorts of fun things.
887080	892080	I think that was the wonderful thing about The Girl with All the Gifts, which we are going to be discussing next time.
893080	896080	So if you can get a hold of it, do and follow along with us.
896080	897080	Yes.
897080	898080	Spoilers.
898080	899080	It is excellent.
899080	900080	It's so good.
900080	904080	Like, it's going to be a really boring episode because it's just going to be gushing.
904080	905080	So...
905080	908080	But oh, the gushing.
908080	911080	It's going to be some profound gushing, so...
911080	912080	Such gush.
912080	913080	Yeah.
913080	915080	So tell us what you'd like us to talk about this season.
915080	919080	If there's any kind of branching out that might interest you, author interviews or genre,
919080	921080	bear in mind we won't branch out too much.
