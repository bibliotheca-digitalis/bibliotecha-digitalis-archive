1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
I mean, we were like, we could play it cool and act like we didn't already shoot this

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:14,380
episode months ago, but it's currently on this thing, which we are having a hard time

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,780
getting it off of, because the other two shoot to SD cards, this sucker shoots on tape.

4
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,400
And it's not cooperating, so.

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,440
So damn you, giant camera A. How dare you.

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,440
Camera A is out of commission.

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,440
So what do we got?

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,560
We finally get to break into the Finnish liquor that our friend Rita brought with her many

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,680
months ago, many, many months ago, brought with her on her great New York adventure.

10
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,280
And we met up with her.

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,360
And the first one, I think I'm only drinking because it is a licorice one.

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,680
It also needs to be served, chilled and shaken.

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,520
Oh my God, that is black as sin.

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,520
Holy.

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,520
Wow.

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,320
So that's what they do when the long never ending nights.

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,960
So, and like Finland will laugh at my pronunciation.

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,960
From what I understand, this is called, uh, Salmari?

19
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,600
Cold spiteful language.

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,600
It's um.

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,360
Is this like, is the backwards K like a backwards K like corn?

22
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,680
It's rad.

23
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,680
You know what?

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,680
It is Finland.

25
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,680
I feel like that could be.

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,680
They did give us Lordi.

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,760
Anyway, I just want to read the thing on the back of it though.

28
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:33,000
Deep in its dark licorice infused heart, is an unforgettable drinking experience waiting

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,200
to be released.

30
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,000
Drink as shots, but don't be misled.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,640
Experience the spirit of Finland and taste Finnish folklore.

32
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,240
This is appropriate since we're talking about a book that's going to take place in India.

33
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,240
I know.

34
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,240
Which is the opposite of Finland.

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,240
How appropriate of us.

36
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,760
I'm embracing the heart of Finland right now.

37
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,760
Oh!

38
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,760
So that's the heart of Finland.

39
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,760
Okay.

40
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,760
How's the heart of Finland?

41
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,760
It's licorice.

42
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,040
It's, um, it's, it's got the, the winter chill on it.

43
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,360
Also the, the, the bitter of forever night, the boredom of never seeing the sun.

44
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,360
Yeah.

45
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,680
It's a lot nicer than Jaeger.

46
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,680
Oh yeah.

47
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,680
Oh, you know what?

48
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,680
Yeah, totally.

49
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,680
So.

50
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,680
Like considerably.

51
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,680
So.

52
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,680
All right.

53
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,680
And then we have our other things courtesy of Rita.

54
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Wall stuff, because we need wall stuff.

55
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Like, yeah.

56
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,280
Including the fan art from Nella's Tiger's Courtesy Cats.

57
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,640
I've actually got to print some of those up and put them on because they are delightful.

58
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,520
But if you want to give us alcohol from your region of the world, that's okay too.

59
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,520
We totally accept any.

60
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,520
Find a way to ship it.

61
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,680
Technically illegal in New York.

62
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,320
When we last left off last season, which is totally deliberate that we divvied this up

63
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,680
between several months.

64
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:51,760
When we last left off, it was, um, we were going to A, talk about, uh, some people's

65
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,400
ideas for the outline and B, we were going to review The Girl with All the Gifts, which

66
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,240
we will do next episode.

67
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,000
Also a lot of stuff, like we're, we're leaving Channel Awesome.

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So that's a thing.

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yeah.

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,160
Uh, if you're watching this on Channel Awesome, you might want to start following us on Twitter

71
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,160
or something.

72
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,160
Yeah.

73
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,160
Uh, follow us over to Shea Apocalypse.

74
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,160
Yeah.

75
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,560
This will probably be the last episode on Channel Awesome.

76
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,960
So it's been real y'all.

77
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,960
Yeah.

78
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,920
We're going to still go just, you know, uh, as, as separate entities flying free.

79
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
We're leaving the nest.

80
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,920
Yeah.

81
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,640
We had a bunch of comments that were just ideas for Awoken book two, which what was

82
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
it?

83
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,920
Was it going to be, it was either Arisen or Aliven.

84
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,920
Yeah.

85
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,920
We haven't decided yet.

86
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,920
Yeah.

87
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,960
We still haven't, you know, we haven't, or another Mary.

88
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,280
No, I feel like another has to be book three.

89
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,920
I just feel like after two, like when we actually get around to writing three, people would

90
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,920
be like another?

91
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,560
Cause it's been a little while.

92
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,000
Uh, what was the basic thrust of the book or this plot?

93
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,720
And you know, obviously it will, you will appreciate it more if you follow Nella's Tiger's

94
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,720
Curse recaps.

95
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
Yes.

96
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,720
Which I also took a break from.

97
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,800
It's like, you know, that scene where Sam and Frodo are on the mountains, like the slopes

98
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,560
of Mount Doom and it's like, no, I can't remember, you know, the taste of food.

99
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,240
Or, you know, water or light.

100
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,320
That's what Tiger's Curse has been for me.

101
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,680
And we had to, you had to finish that cause it's like this, this book is more like where

102
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,680
Awoken was more parody of Twilight.

103
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,720
This one is more parody of Tiger's Curse.

104
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,480
So if you're curious as to what that means, definitely go check up the recaps of Tiger's

105
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,040
Curse under Let's Read with Nella.

106
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,680
I've, uh, I've been getting comments from people saying like, just your recaps are painful

107
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,680
for us.

108
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,880
Like this book is terrible.

109
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,480
The most amazingly redundant book.

110
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,680
Oh, it's so redundant.

111
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:49,760
So the basic plot of Awoken book two, um, Arisen or Aliven, kind of like Aliven, cause

112
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,600
I feel like that was, that was a big complaint with the first one was that it was too stealth

113
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
a parody.

114
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Yeah.

115
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
And like, maybe it's just like, you know what?

116
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
We had our fun being kind of a stealth parody.

117
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,160
Maybe let's go a little more cracked out.

118
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,160
Yeah.

119
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,680
So the thrust of book two is, you know, it starts with this sort of breaking dawn thing

120
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,440
where, um, not Edward, Riley leaves her for her own good again, because he did that in

121
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
the first book.

122
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,720
Although I'm really, after reading, uh, Tiger's Curse, I really do feel like it has to be

123
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,480
like the rich, like family member, like the ex-Bollywood uncle who flies in a school trip

124
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,480
to India.

125
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,080
You will, you want to just like an excuse for Mr. Kadam.

126
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,080
Yes, I do.

127
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,080
Who needs an excuse?

128
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,080
Mr. Kadam is the only redeeming factor of Tiger's Curse.

129
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,080
No, we could have that.

130
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,080
And then it turns out it was Uncle Neil the whole time.

131
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,080
Mm.

132
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,080
Like he wanted to get some balls rolling.

133
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
Uh, yeah.

134
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,080
Like, oh, it was me all along.

135
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,080
I was the turkey.

136
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,080
But then would Uncle Neil then be able to drive a car out of the Ganges?

137
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:53,080
Because I really have this mental image in my head of him driving a car out of the Ganges

138
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,080
and it's kind of delightful.

139
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,080
Well, I don't know.

140
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,080
Here's the thing.

141
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,080
I kind of feel like Uncle Neil and a Kadama-like are a little mutually exclusive.

142
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,080
Mm.

143
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,080
But then, you know, both characters would be kind of redundant since Uncle Neil was

144
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,080
the awesome character that you wanted the book to be about and who keeps getting cut

145
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,080
off.

146
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,080
So the basic thrust is we go to India, somehow or other there's like a super powerful thing

147
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,080
that happens and everyone assumes that Andy is the special Lego movie style because she

148
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,080
is the, you know, she's the white girl that outnatives the natives a la Avatar and all

149
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,080
that fun stuff.

150
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,080
Mm.

151
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,080
But then eventually the plot happens and we find out that Vic is the special.

152
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
Yeah.

153
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,080
But like everything just lines up just so it makes it seem like it was her.

154
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,080
Yeah, and everyone just assumes it's her.

155
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,080
Except for Bri.

156
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,080
I think Bri would be the one like foreshadowing things.

157
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,080
I don't know.

158
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,080
It's like, this prophecy says born of this land.

159
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,080
My great grandmother's Cherokee.

160
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,080
Oh, God.

161
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
Oh, God.

162
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,080
Oh, God.

163
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,080
It's like Andy should have like a great great something that was like English but she like

164
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,080
was born in India.

165
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,080
I think.

166
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,080
So that's why she thinks.

167
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,080
I don't know.

168
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,080
I'm still kind of enamored with Cherokee princess, but I don't even know if Andy is that dense.

169
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,080
I know.

170
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,080
Well, things to ponder.

171
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,080
Which kind of Indian should Andy claim?

172
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,080
Hayley Combs suggests that all the other kids in Andy's class be respectful and understanding

173
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,080
of Indian culture in the background, but Andy is just the hapless white savior princess

174
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,080
who has no idea of anything at all.

175
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:31,080
Do we want to do like the totally like over-the-top like caste discrimination?

176
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,080
Like, should there be like overt caste discrimination?

177
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,080
I don't think Sarah would know about the caste system.

178
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,080
No, but I feel like, I mean, I feel like that's that thing that Westerners like.

179
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,080
I don't know.

180
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,080
It's like Colleen Houk didn't.

181
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,080
She kind of like mentioned it in this like I read a Wikipedia article.

182
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,080
Or that like, well this happened in the past.

183
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,080
Like she'd like conflate Varnas with caste.

184
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,080
You know, like, okay, there's four Varnas, but there's like 90 bajillion castes.

185
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,080
And she's like, well, they're the same thing.

186
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,080
Yeah.

187
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,080
You know, and like, and like I read the Wikipedia article.

188
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
It's like, I'm Kshatriya.

189
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
And like, and then that's all you need to know.

190
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
I mean, maybe someone could be like, wait a minute.

191
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,080
That, you know, it's like, there's a lot of castes and Varnas and castes.

192
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
Like, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

193
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,080
That should be Bree.

194
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,080
Bree should always be the voice of Bree.

195
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,080
Yeah.

196
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:22,080
And Toli Berra, also speaking of Bree, suggests that Vic and Bree maybe hook up as a sort

197
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,080
of parody of Renesmee Jacob.

198
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,080
We got to find a way to make that creepy if we're going to go that way.

199
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,080
I know.

200
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,080
Creepy-er.

201
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,080
It has to be creepy.

202
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,080
But let's get back to the TIFF.

203
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,080
Okay.

204
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,080
Because, you know, in the beginning, like, I think the idea was that he would, or that

205
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,080
Riley would accidentally try to soul snack on Andy.

206
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,080
Uh-huh.

207
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,080
Well, they were together.

208
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,080
Oh, yeah.

209
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,080
Like she's.

210
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,080
But Toli Berra writes that Riley's no soul snacks.

211
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,080
I think he should go after criminals because, and I quote, I selected them because I want

212
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,080
to make the world safer for you.

213
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,080
Yeah.

214
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,080
And, like, the TIFF maybe.

215
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,080
Either she'd be that super romantic.

216
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,080
No, no, she's like.

217
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,080
No, I think it's like he almost soul snacks her, like, in their sleep or something.

218
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
Yeah.

219
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,080
And then, like, afterwards, while he's gone out.

220
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,080
Like he sleep snacks.

221
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,080
Yeah, he goes out and states his lust.

222
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,080
He's like, I found some petty thieves.

223
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,080
Yeah.

224
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,080
They were arrested on minor drug charges.

225
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,080
Oh, my God.

226
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
They were 16.

227
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
Oh, God.

228
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,080
And she's like, well, that's great that you only go after criminals.

229
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,080
I don't know.

230
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,080
I like the idea that he only goes.

231
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,080
But.

232
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
He only goes after criminals.

233
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,080
But.

234
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,080
But it's like drug.

235
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,080
That would certainly knock off a whole bunch of people of our Patreon folks that have been

236
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,080
donating money.

237
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,080
That's a good point.

238
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
So.

239
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,080
The petty criminal.

240
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,080
Again, we all.

241
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,080
Some of you might be petty criminals.

242
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,080
We didn't promise that the people who Patreon on that top level would get to die.

243
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,080
Like, not only are they going to be written into the book, but they get to die a horrible

244
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,080
being eaten by Cthulhu death.

245
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,080
So that's.

246
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,080
That's not incentive.

247
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,080
I don't know what is.

248
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,080
Aurelia Verity writes that.

249
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,080
At first, Andy speaks about how clearly important it is to do missionary work and help people

250
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,080
and how they're going to change people's lives while they're there.

251
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,080
And clearly, at this point, these will be Sarah's words.

252
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,080
And Andy is just the mouthpiece.

253
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,080
And like that whole idea.

254
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,080
Like, well, maybe there's a missionary element.

255
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,080
Like.

256
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,080
She doesn't use that word.

257
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,080
Like building houses.

258
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,080
It's like Habitat for Humanity.

259
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,080
Yeah.

260
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,080
It's a field trip.

261
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,080
It's weird.

262
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,080
It's like whatever.

263
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,080
They're building wells.

264
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
We do that.

265
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,080
That's a really popular thing to do.

266
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,080
Like.

267
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,080
Arthur Limbo suggests that the whole India thing is framed like the Lizzie McGuire movie.

268
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,080
And, you know, and there's like this part.

269
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,080
For instance, there's this part where Lizzie rides on a motorcycle with like a random stranger.

270
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,080
She gets to ride on like an elephant with Vic.

271
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,080
Yeah.

272
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,080
Ethnic third wheel.

273
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,080
Well, going back to Aurelia, they write.

274
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,080
Although they're on a school trip, Vic and Andy just wander off, off into different cities

275
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,080
and temples for hours and days.

276
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,080
And no teacher or supervisor cares or notices.

277
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,080
Which, yes, I think that absolutely needs.

278
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,080
So like.

279
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
And then there's an elephant that happens.

280
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,080
I think there needs.

281
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,080
There has to be a romantic elephant at some point.

282
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,080
And also like just to run with Tiger's Curse.

283
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,080
Absolutely no forms are signed.

284
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,080
No worries about passports.

285
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,080
No worries about paperwork.

286
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,080
Yeah.

287
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,080
It's just like a week before the plane takes off.

288
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,080
Like someone's like, hey, kids, let's dig wells in India.

289
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,080
Over spring break.

290
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,080
And you're like, yeah, that's the legitist thing.

291
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:21,080
Shiksabell suggests possibly inappropriate comparison between Andy and Riley's relationship

292
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,080
and the Ramayana.

293
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,080
But perhaps that would be giving Sarah too much credit.

294
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,080
I agree.

295
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,080
But she could just get it wildly wrong.

296
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,080
I think that's a wiki article.

297
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,080
Yeah.

298
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,080
Yeah.

299
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:36,080
Inujade points out that you could in-universe call Loki and his elk the young gods as opposed

300
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,080
to the Lovecraftian old gods.

301
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:46,080
Because remember, the joke or our basic plot was there was going to be some like pseudo

302
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,080
Indian bad guy.

303
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,080
And then it turns out it was Loki the whole time.

304
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,080
And that's going to be the plot.

305
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
Yeah.

306
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,080
And he's trying to bring about Ragnarok.

307
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,080
But then going back to the god thing.

308
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,080
And Piano Slave points out, going off the multiple god idea, maybe there can be a council

309
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,080
where all the different gods get together and talk like in the vampire council thing

310
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
in New Moon.

311
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,080
Or we could save that for the third book.

312
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,080
I feel like that could be the opening of the third book.

313
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,080
Like all the gods gathering.

314
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,080
Yeah, like turns out there's like a big god council.

315
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,080
And maybe Sarah actually kind of has like an imagination.

316
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,080
I don't know.

317
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,080
Chrysander the Great brings up the romantic scene between Vic and Andy should be inspired

318
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,080
by the magic carpet ride from Aladdin.

319
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
Yes.

320
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,080
Yeah.

321
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,080
Absolutely.

322
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,080
Except it should be a romantic elephant ride under the stars.

323
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,080
So I think we're all on the same page here.

324
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,080
Yeah.

325
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,080
Yeah.

326
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,080
And it should be really direct.

327
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,080
Like, tell me Andy, when did you last let your heart decide?

328
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:40,080
And finally, Froglet suggests that Andy should be jealous of a woman whose soul Riley is

329
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,080
trying to eat.

330
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,080
Maybe in that sort of, it's not what it looks like scenario.

331
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,080
Absolutely.

332
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,080
I hope she's also a petty drug criminal.

333
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,080
Well, I mean, she has like an ounce of marijuana and deserves to die.

334
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,080
Yeah.

335
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,080
So thus with our little outline begins our season two.

336
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,080
So, yeah.

337
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,080
What would you like to see, Nella?

338
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,080
Is it technically season three at this point?

339
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,080
So thus...

340
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,080
Stuff is strong.

341
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,080
Yeah.

342
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,080
It hurts your head.

343
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
Noble liquor.

344
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,080
Noble.

345
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,080
So thus with our little outline, we start our season three.

346
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,080
So at the beginning of season two, we started reviewing things in addition to working on

347
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,080
the Viridian Saga.

348
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,080
Yeah.

349
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,080
What would you like to see this season, Nella?

350
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,080
Oh, gosh.

351
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:34,080
I think I would just like to see some better books with female protagonists and, you know,

352
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,080
love on the romance and maybe on the sci-fi fantasy element.

353
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
Especially on the YA side.

354
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
Yeah.

355
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
Hashtag never.

356
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:49,080
Well, there's also, we might branch into interviews more because we did that once last season.

357
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,080
Yeah.

358
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,080
So what do you want us to read?

359
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,080
Yeah.

360
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,080
So now we need to start whittling down our options.

361
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,080
Of course, there is, of course, this.

362
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,080
Ooh, a sequel.

363
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,080
Which we didn't even really discuss the first one except...

364
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
I know.

365
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,080
As it pertained to...

366
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,080
Lock-in.

367
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,080
This.

368
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,080
But that is something to consider.

369
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,080
But, of course, also keep in mind that, you know, I am still working on Tiger's Curse.

370
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,080
Yeah.

371
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
So if we could...

372
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,080
You might die.

373
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,080
Lay off.

374
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,080
Well, if we could lay off the really terrible books, that'd be nice.

375
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,080
That's a good point.

376
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,080
Yeah.

377
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,080
I feel like while we're making fun of things like Tiger's Curse and writing things like

378
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:30,080
Awoken, you know, when we do our read-alongs, we want to at least think that...

379
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,080
Experience girl.

380
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:36,080
Take the genres that we like and make them rise above, you know.

381
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,080
I mean, Shades of Grey filled me with a powerful hate, but it was thoughtful.

382
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,080
It was a thoughtful hate.

383
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,080
It was so powerful.

384
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,080
It was a thoughtful hate.

385
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,080
There was a lot of thinking and discussion and all sorts of fun things.

386
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:52,080
I think that was the wonderful thing about The Girl with All the Gifts, which we are going to be discussing next time.

387
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,080
So if you can get a hold of it, do and follow along with us.

388
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,080
Yes.

389
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,080
Spoilers.

390
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,080
It is excellent.

391
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,080
It's so good.

392
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,080
Like, it's going to be a really boring episode because it's just going to be gushing.

393
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,080
So...

394
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,080
But oh, the gushing.

395
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,080
It's going to be some profound gushing, so...

396
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,080
Such gush.

397
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,080
Yeah.

398
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,080
So tell us what you'd like us to talk about this season.

399
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,080
If there's any kind of branching out that might interest you, author interviews or genre,

400
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,080
bear in mind we won't branch out too much.

401
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
Yeah.

402
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,080
And as always, leave comments at SheaApocalypse.com.

403
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,080
Those are where we actually tabulate the comments because we have a system.

404
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,080
If you're on YouTube, go to SheaApocalypse.com where there are comments allowed.

405
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,080
And as always, follow us on Twitter at SheaApocalypse.

406
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,080
You can follow Sarah on Twitter as well.

407
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:48,080
Hopefully she will start updating with her observations on the writing life and hashtag amwriting and hashtag blessed and all that fun stuff.

408
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,080
Let's have a good and productive 2015.

409
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,080
Cheers.

410
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,080
Cheers.
