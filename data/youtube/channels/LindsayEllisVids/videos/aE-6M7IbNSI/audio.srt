1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
The first time I saw Transformers, I saw it with my then-roommate, who was less,

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,480
shall we say, fascinated by the Michael Bay oeuvre than I was, even then. Two days later,

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:19,760
out of the blue, she says to me, did a robot pee on John Turturro in that movie? And I was like,

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,200
no, of course not, that's ridiculous. Why would a robot pee on John Turturro? And she was like,

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:32,480
no, that did happen. Bumblebee peed on John Turturro. In fact, I think it even had a bee-yoing

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:45,040
sound as its hubcap popped off before it peed on beloved indie icon John Turturro. I was like, no,

7
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,880
that did not happen. So of course I then had to see Transformers again, and I would say that,

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,880
although that second viewing ultimately threw me down a rabbit hole from which I had yet to emerge,

9
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:05,600
I realized something that day. Bumblebee peed on John Turturro. That was a thing that happened

10
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,960
in that movie, and somehow I did not remember it. Years later, I have watched Transformers 3

11
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,800
half a dozen times, and unless I have the Wikipedia article right in front of me,

12
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,760
I still have difficulty trying to explain the plot to you. And this isn't really so much an issue in

13
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:30,080
other visually busy action movie franchises. I remember what happened in Guardians of the Galaxy

14
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,160
both 1 and 2 pretty well, and I only saw either of those once. Which begs a question that I feel

15
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:41,360
like a lot of people know is a thing, but maybe have not even really thought to ask.

16
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,480
Why is it so difficult to remember what happens in these f***ing Transformers movies?

17
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,880
This ties into auteur theory because the answer to that question lies very much in the Bay

18
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,360
aesthetic, the way Bay technically puts his movies together. Some characteristics of the

19
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,880
Michael Bay aesthetic include helicopters at sunset, wide parallax,

20
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:23,600
standing into the frame, helicopters at sunset, robot helicopters, street lamps,

21
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:31,920
high color contrast, frequent rapid cutting, and helicopters after sunset. So if I were to

22
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,320
point out that the frame in the Transformers movies tend to be a touch...busy, I would be

23
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,120
roughly the 9 millionth person to point that out. What I want to do is tie in that idea with the

24
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,640
lack of impression these films make on the viewer, Bay's filmmaker ethos, and the language of film

25
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:59,120
in general. So let's say you have a person talking, me for instance right now, and besides some very

26
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,440
mild visual elements, the only information you are getting are my body language and the words

27
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,280
that are coming out of my mouth. So let's add to that a big block of text that has nothing to do

28
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,240
with what I am saying right now. You can either listen to me and what I'm saying, or you can read

29
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,440
the block of text. I mean, you could try to do both, but now you're working twice as hard to try

30
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,840
to absorb whatever is coming at you. And you can maybe listen to me and read the block of text and

31
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,040
actually absorb what is saying, but your ability for it to stick with you is diminished. The same

32
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,080
applies to film language. Your human brain has only so much processing power and has to be

33
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,440
absorbing film language information just as much as dialogue information. And if the film makes you

34
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,840
work too hard to absorb that information, your brain is going to get tired and frustrated by

35
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,320
that pretty quickly. If the information is too cluttered or too quick, you just won't absorb it,

36
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,360
but too slow, and it likes excitement, and then you get bored. This is why editing and framing are

37
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,320
much more integral aspects of film language than dialogue. In terms of sheer information,

38
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:08,560
where we are in time, what the tone is, what is even happening, you get far more raw information

39
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,000
than the words coming out of the actor's mouth from film language. Film language is all-encompassing.

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Everything you see on screen uses film language, even if it's just pure blackness.

41
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:26,160
Much that once was is lost. Or whiteness. All of this tells your brain something, even if the

42
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,880
something is just the concept of the color white. Okay, I know white's not a color. Now let's add

43
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,680
something else. Maybe some reverb on my voice, and some angelic music. Even combining the very

44
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,680
simplest of elements in a frame can create a form of shorthand. Maybe I'm dead. And talking about

45
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:54,400
film language from the beyond. Maybe I am God. Maybe God is dead. Transformers. The nuances of

46
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,400
film language would be impossible to list because new ones are being developed literally every day.

47
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,200
Film language is extremely fluid. But simply put, all elements of the film, from the frame, to the

48
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:13,920
dialogue, to the editing, to the acting, all of these things convey information to the audience.

49
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,120
And some frames, by necessity, are more impactful than others. To borrow once again from Every

50
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,400
Frame a Painting's episode on Bayhem, Michael Bay tends not only to maximize visual impact in

51
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,920
important shots, shots that convey crucial plot information, but maximizes visual impact in every

52
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:37,200
shot. Bay's aesthetic is a series of dynamic shots and no non-dynamic ones. So rather than a visual

53
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:43,280
intensity rising and falling as the story does, the visuals in Michael Bay's movies hang around

54
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,680
a nine or a ten. Meaning that every frame is telling you that this information is of max

55
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,480
importance and therefore it is harder to retain it. Let's talk about visual contrast and affinity

56
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:02,640
and its impact on what the audience absorbs. Be it with cinematography, editing, sound, lighting.

57
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:11,280
You have contrast and you have affinity. Affinity means similarity. Contrast means contrast.

58
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,840
A general rule of thumb. Contrast is generally more striking and therefore more impactful.

59
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,120
Affinity is less striking and therefore less impactful. That does not mean that one is better

60
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,440
than the other. In fact, you need both in order to make a coherent film. Let's look at a scene

61
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,960
from Psycho. In this scene, Norman is giving Marion a sandwich. Norman is attracted to Marion,

62
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,400
but has a lot of shame in the form of the mother personality. This is an important

63
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,040
scene because at the end of it, Marion decides that she needs to leave and go back to her real

64
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:46,080
life and own up to the consequences of what she's done. It's a very long dialogue scene with a lot

65
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,280
of shot-reverse-shot. Maximum viewer impact happens upon the first time you see a shot.

66
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,240
This is why shot-reverse-shot gets kind of dull if the frame never changes. And this is also why

67
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,280
changing the shots needs to be motivated. The frame on Norman changes when Marion challenges

68
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:10,880
the idea of Norman's mother. We go from a more conventional frame to a frame with more tonal

69
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,560
contrast, that is more pronounced blacks and whites, and also with a bird of doom in the

70
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,360
background. And it changes again when Marion suggests that Norman institutionalized his mother

71
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:29,600
and he turns on her. The frame changes when the beat and tone of the scene change and the tension

72
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,320
builds. I use the example of Psycho because the changes in the frame are highly motivated. After

73
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,720
a long stretch of visual affinity, the visual contrast of the new frame tells the viewer that

74
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,560
this is an important shift and needs to be remembered. Bay understands that the more times

75
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,120
you cut back to the same frame, you lose some tension, which is why you so rarely see a cut

76
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,400
back and forth to the same frame in a Michael Bay movie. His camera is always moving, he rarely uses

77
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,000
traditional shot-reverse-shot, and he rarely cuts back to the same frame. Visual contrast can be of

78
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,920
tone, of hue, of movement, but in editing, when the focus falls in the same place from shot to shot,

79
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,240
that is called affinity of continuum of movement. Haven't I seen you before?

80
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,600
Maybe. When the focus falls in two different places from shot to shot,

81
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,480
that is called contrast of continuum of movement.

82
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,800
You may have heard of the centering technique used in Mad Max Fury Road. The cinematographer

83
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,640
deliberately kept the action in the center of the shot during the action scenes,

84
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,400
so editor Margaret Sixel would have maximum temporal freedom in the edit,

85
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,560
meaning she could make the shots go for as long or as short as she desired. And she had that

86
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,520
freedom because the focus is always in the same place from shot to shot, the center of the frame.

87
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,320
This is a good example of affinity of continuum of movement. The continuum of movement is the

88
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,080
This is a good example of affinity of continuum of movement.

89
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,960
The continuum of movement in Transformers action scenes

90
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,080
kind of goes back and forth. Sometimes there is excellent affinity of continuum of movement,

91
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,560
and sometimes there's a lot of contrast.

92
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,800
That is not to say that contrast of continuum of movement in action scenes is always a bad thing

93
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,280
when it is used deliberately. There is a scene in Batman Begins where the Bat-Man

94
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,840
uses Scarecrow's scare tactics against him and it's really hard to follow what's going on in

95
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,880
the scene. This scene is meant to be intentionally disorienting, to give some menace to Batman,

96
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,600
as we see him from the point of view of the criminal. But it is important to know also

97
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,600
that this is not consistent with the rest of the visual style of the film.

98
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,880
This style of editing is used very rarely, therefore it is memorable when it does happen.

99
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,880
Most of the film is shot very traditionally, so when you do have a scene that deliberately

100
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,600
uses a lot of contrast of continuum of movement, not only does the audience remember the scene,

101
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,160
the intended effect helps the audience remember the scene, rather than diminishes your ability

102
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,360
to do so. Here's an example of rapid fire cutting and contrast of continuum of movement to create

103
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,000
a desired effect. In the Transformers movies, especially the later ones, there's little focus

104
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,800
of where the eye is supposed to be, especially when the robots are on screen. So when you combine

105
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,240
visually confusing character design, no clear focus in the frame, the rapid fire nature of

106
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,360
the cutting, and contrast of continuum of movement, eventually your brain is just going to kind of

107
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,720
tune out and sit back and enjoy the spectacle. It's like a firework show you're only half paying

108
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,720
attention to because you're looking at your phone. And that is what some people are here for.

109
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,880
That is what a lot of people are here for.

110
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,760
But the visual language makes no distinction between what is important and what isn't.

111
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,480
And while loud and noisome, its homogeneity in the form of being loud and noisome

112
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,000
makes it difficult to absorb what is even going on. The way your eye moves takes brain processing

113
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,640
power. The more your eye has to move around, the more work your brain has to do, the less

114
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,400
information you're able to absorb. And again, this is not inherently a bad technique when the intent

115
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,520
is motivated. And this is also not to say that Bay never slows down or focuses his frame. Again,

116
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,840
this is part of why the first half of the first movie, I argue, is the strongest because it takes

117
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,960
the time to set up important plot points visually. And the plot point of Sam's glasses, dumb as it

118
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:17,120
is, at least you remember that's what the Autobots are interested in and why Sam matters. Take note,

119
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,200
audience, extreme close-ups staying on the glasses means you need to remember the glasses. Therefore

120
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,760
you remember the glasses. And I cannot say the same for the pillars in Transformers 3 or the

121
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:37,520
whatever the problem was in Transformers 2 or 4. Transformium? How are you in every movie, Stanley

122
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,080
Tucci? So as the films progress, when there is a relatively important piece of plot information

123
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,240
being imparted, the language of the film does not tell your brain, this is important and you need to

124
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,760
remember this. Or it doesn't sink in because every shot is given equal weight visually. The focus on

125
00:11:51,760 --> 00:12:00,160
visual spectacle increases and the editing gets sloppier. I want to pay special attention to the

126
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,800
sequence in Dark of the Moon. Here we have two conflicting elements of film language. Shia's

127
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:19,280
acting is in direct contradiction with the editing. His screaming is supposed to be humorous,

128
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,320
but there is no time for the joke to land. There is no like moment where Bumblebee kind of playfully

129
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,880
rips in with like a pop song or something. No moment where the audience is allowed to take a

130
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,760
breath and collect itself before the next action sequence starts. No moment where Sam composes

131
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,960
himself. He screams, the emotion of it has no time to land, and then the film cuts to the next scene.

132
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,920
And the thing is, action scenes are uniquely hard to edit. Rapid cutting means the cuts need to match

133
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,480
where the eye was on a previous cut. You having to work to figure out where the focus is in the

134
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,960
new cut means your brain can't absorb information because it's too busy trying to figure out where

135
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,440
to look. I wanted to incorporate the episode on film language into the greater discussion of

136
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:04,160
auteur theory because this discussion is somewhat unique to Michael Bay and also rubs up against the

137
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:11,520
greater thesis of this entire series, which is that the text of the film rubs up and often conflicts

138
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:17,280
against the framing. And I hear you saying, text? What text? And yes, these movies have plots and

139
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,920
stories and they are convoluted as hell and the director seems largely uninterested in the story

140
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,240
and therefore does not create frames that complement the story, but rather creates frames

141
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,560
designed for maximum spectacle. And spectacle is great if it is used with purpose, and if your film

142
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,400
is all spectacle with no focus, then your audience is going to have a difficult time remembering

143
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:44,080
which information is important to the plot and which information isn't.
