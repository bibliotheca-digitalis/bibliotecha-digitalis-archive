00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
The first time I saw Transformers, I saw it with my then-roommate, who was less,

00:05.920 --> 00:12.480
shall we say, fascinated by the Michael Bay oeuvre than I was, even then. Two days later,

00:12.480 --> 00:19.760
out of the blue, she says to me, did a robot pee on John Turturro in that movie? And I was like,

00:19.760 --> 00:25.200
no, of course not, that's ridiculous. Why would a robot pee on John Turturro? And she was like,

00:25.200 --> 00:32.480
no, that did happen. Bumblebee peed on John Turturro. In fact, I think it even had a bee-yoing

00:32.480 --> 00:45.040
sound as its hubcap popped off before it peed on beloved indie icon John Turturro. I was like, no,

00:45.040 --> 00:50.880
that did not happen. So of course I then had to see Transformers again, and I would say that,

00:50.960 --> 00:54.880
although that second viewing ultimately threw me down a rabbit hole from which I had yet to emerge,

00:54.880 --> 01:05.600
I realized something that day. Bumblebee peed on John Turturro. That was a thing that happened

01:05.600 --> 01:12.960
in that movie, and somehow I did not remember it. Years later, I have watched Transformers 3

01:12.960 --> 01:16.800
half a dozen times, and unless I have the Wikipedia article right in front of me,

01:17.360 --> 01:23.760
I still have difficulty trying to explain the plot to you. And this isn't really so much an issue in

01:23.760 --> 01:30.080
other visually busy action movie franchises. I remember what happened in Guardians of the Galaxy

01:30.080 --> 01:36.160
both 1 and 2 pretty well, and I only saw either of those once. Which begs a question that I feel

01:36.160 --> 01:41.360
like a lot of people know is a thing, but maybe have not even really thought to ask.

01:42.320 --> 01:48.480
Why is it so difficult to remember what happens in these f***ing Transformers movies?

01:56.160 --> 02:00.880
This ties into auteur theory because the answer to that question lies very much in the Bay

02:00.880 --> 02:07.360
aesthetic, the way Bay technically puts his movies together. Some characteristics of the

02:07.760 --> 02:12.880
Michael Bay aesthetic include helicopters at sunset, wide parallax,

02:15.120 --> 02:23.600
standing into the frame, helicopters at sunset, robot helicopters, street lamps,

02:23.600 --> 02:31.920
high color contrast, frequent rapid cutting, and helicopters after sunset. So if I were to

02:31.920 --> 02:38.320
point out that the frame in the Transformers movies tend to be a touch...busy, I would be

02:38.320 --> 02:43.120
roughly the 9 millionth person to point that out. What I want to do is tie in that idea with the

02:43.120 --> 02:48.640
lack of impression these films make on the viewer, Bay's filmmaker ethos, and the language of film

02:48.640 --> 02:59.120
in general. So let's say you have a person talking, me for instance right now, and besides some very

02:59.120 --> 03:05.440
mild visual elements, the only information you are getting are my body language and the words

03:05.440 --> 03:11.280
that are coming out of my mouth. So let's add to that a big block of text that has nothing to do

03:11.280 --> 03:16.240
with what I am saying right now. You can either listen to me and what I'm saying, or you can read

03:16.240 --> 03:21.440
the block of text. I mean, you could try to do both, but now you're working twice as hard to try

03:21.440 --> 03:27.840
to absorb whatever is coming at you. And you can maybe listen to me and read the block of text and

03:27.840 --> 03:33.040
actually absorb what is saying, but your ability for it to stick with you is diminished. The same

03:33.040 --> 03:38.080
applies to film language. Your human brain has only so much processing power and has to be

03:38.080 --> 03:43.440
absorbing film language information just as much as dialogue information. And if the film makes you

03:43.440 --> 03:47.840
work too hard to absorb that information, your brain is going to get tired and frustrated by

03:47.840 --> 03:52.320
that pretty quickly. If the information is too cluttered or too quick, you just won't absorb it,

03:52.320 --> 03:57.360
but too slow, and it likes excitement, and then you get bored. This is why editing and framing are

03:57.360 --> 04:02.320
much more integral aspects of film language than dialogue. In terms of sheer information,

04:02.320 --> 04:08.560
where we are in time, what the tone is, what is even happening, you get far more raw information

04:08.560 --> 04:14.000
than the words coming out of the actor's mouth from film language. Film language is all-encompassing.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
Everything you see on screen uses film language, even if it's just pure blackness.

04:19.040 --> 04:26.160
Much that once was is lost. Or whiteness. All of this tells your brain something, even if the

04:26.160 --> 04:32.880
something is just the concept of the color white. Okay, I know white's not a color. Now let's add

04:32.880 --> 04:39.680
something else. Maybe some reverb on my voice, and some angelic music. Even combining the very

04:39.680 --> 04:45.680
simplest of elements in a frame can create a form of shorthand. Maybe I'm dead. And talking about

04:45.680 --> 04:54.400
film language from the beyond. Maybe I am God. Maybe God is dead. Transformers. The nuances of

04:54.400 --> 05:00.400
film language would be impossible to list because new ones are being developed literally every day.

05:00.400 --> 05:07.200
Film language is extremely fluid. But simply put, all elements of the film, from the frame, to the

05:07.200 --> 05:13.920
dialogue, to the editing, to the acting, all of these things convey information to the audience.

05:13.920 --> 05:19.120
And some frames, by necessity, are more impactful than others. To borrow once again from Every

05:19.120 --> 05:24.400
Frame a Painting's episode on Bayhem, Michael Bay tends not only to maximize visual impact in

05:24.400 --> 05:29.920
important shots, shots that convey crucial plot information, but maximizes visual impact in every

05:29.920 --> 05:37.200
shot. Bay's aesthetic is a series of dynamic shots and no non-dynamic ones. So rather than a visual

05:37.200 --> 05:43.280
intensity rising and falling as the story does, the visuals in Michael Bay's movies hang around

05:43.280 --> 05:47.680
a nine or a ten. Meaning that every frame is telling you that this information is of max

05:47.680 --> 05:54.480
importance and therefore it is harder to retain it. Let's talk about visual contrast and affinity

05:54.480 --> 06:02.640
and its impact on what the audience absorbs. Be it with cinematography, editing, sound, lighting.

06:04.160 --> 06:11.280
You have contrast and you have affinity. Affinity means similarity. Contrast means contrast.

06:11.280 --> 06:17.840
A general rule of thumb. Contrast is generally more striking and therefore more impactful.

06:17.840 --> 06:23.120
Affinity is less striking and therefore less impactful. That does not mean that one is better

06:23.120 --> 06:27.440
than the other. In fact, you need both in order to make a coherent film. Let's look at a scene

06:27.440 --> 06:32.960
from Psycho. In this scene, Norman is giving Marion a sandwich. Norman is attracted to Marion,

06:32.960 --> 06:36.400
but has a lot of shame in the form of the mother personality. This is an important

06:36.400 --> 06:41.040
scene because at the end of it, Marion decides that she needs to leave and go back to her real

06:41.040 --> 06:46.080
life and own up to the consequences of what she's done. It's a very long dialogue scene with a lot

06:46.080 --> 06:51.280
of shot-reverse-shot. Maximum viewer impact happens upon the first time you see a shot.

06:51.280 --> 06:56.240
This is why shot-reverse-shot gets kind of dull if the frame never changes. And this is also why

06:56.240 --> 07:01.280
changing the shots needs to be motivated. The frame on Norman changes when Marion challenges

07:01.280 --> 07:10.880
the idea of Norman's mother. We go from a more conventional frame to a frame with more tonal

07:10.880 --> 07:14.560
contrast, that is more pronounced blacks and whites, and also with a bird of doom in the

07:14.560 --> 07:19.360
background. And it changes again when Marion suggests that Norman institutionalized his mother

07:19.360 --> 07:29.600
and he turns on her. The frame changes when the beat and tone of the scene change and the tension

07:29.600 --> 07:34.320
builds. I use the example of Psycho because the changes in the frame are highly motivated. After

07:34.320 --> 07:38.720
a long stretch of visual affinity, the visual contrast of the new frame tells the viewer that

07:38.720 --> 07:42.560
this is an important shift and needs to be remembered. Bay understands that the more times

07:42.560 --> 07:47.120
you cut back to the same frame, you lose some tension, which is why you so rarely see a cut

07:47.120 --> 07:52.400
back and forth to the same frame in a Michael Bay movie. His camera is always moving, he rarely uses

07:52.400 --> 07:58.000
traditional shot-reverse-shot, and he rarely cuts back to the same frame. Visual contrast can be of

07:58.000 --> 08:03.920
tone, of hue, of movement, but in editing, when the focus falls in the same place from shot to shot,

08:03.920 --> 08:08.240
that is called affinity of continuum of movement. Haven't I seen you before?

08:11.760 --> 08:15.600
Maybe. When the focus falls in two different places from shot to shot,

08:15.600 --> 08:18.480
that is called contrast of continuum of movement.

08:18.880 --> 08:22.800
You may have heard of the centering technique used in Mad Max Fury Road. The cinematographer

08:22.800 --> 08:26.640
deliberately kept the action in the center of the shot during the action scenes,

08:26.640 --> 08:30.400
so editor Margaret Sixel would have maximum temporal freedom in the edit,

08:30.400 --> 08:34.560
meaning she could make the shots go for as long or as short as she desired. And she had that

08:34.560 --> 08:39.520
freedom because the focus is always in the same place from shot to shot, the center of the frame.

08:39.520 --> 08:44.320
This is a good example of affinity of continuum of movement. The continuum of movement is the

08:44.720 --> 08:48.080
This is a good example of affinity of continuum of movement.

08:48.080 --> 08:50.960
The continuum of movement in Transformers action scenes

08:51.760 --> 08:56.080
kind of goes back and forth. Sometimes there is excellent affinity of continuum of movement,

08:58.880 --> 09:00.560
and sometimes there's a lot of contrast.

09:05.920 --> 09:10.800
That is not to say that contrast of continuum of movement in action scenes is always a bad thing

09:10.800 --> 09:15.280
when it is used deliberately. There is a scene in Batman Begins where the Bat-Man

09:17.360 --> 09:21.840
uses Scarecrow's scare tactics against him and it's really hard to follow what's going on in

09:21.840 --> 09:26.880
the scene. This scene is meant to be intentionally disorienting, to give some menace to Batman,

09:26.880 --> 09:31.600
as we see him from the point of view of the criminal. But it is important to know also

09:31.600 --> 09:35.600
that this is not consistent with the rest of the visual style of the film.

09:35.600 --> 09:40.880
This style of editing is used very rarely, therefore it is memorable when it does happen.

09:40.880 --> 09:44.880
Most of the film is shot very traditionally, so when you do have a scene that deliberately

09:44.880 --> 09:49.600
uses a lot of contrast of continuum of movement, not only does the audience remember the scene,

09:49.600 --> 09:54.160
the intended effect helps the audience remember the scene, rather than diminishes your ability

09:54.160 --> 09:59.360
to do so. Here's an example of rapid fire cutting and contrast of continuum of movement to create

09:59.360 --> 10:04.000
a desired effect. In the Transformers movies, especially the later ones, there's little focus

10:04.000 --> 10:08.800
of where the eye is supposed to be, especially when the robots are on screen. So when you combine

10:08.800 --> 10:14.240
visually confusing character design, no clear focus in the frame, the rapid fire nature of

10:14.240 --> 10:19.360
the cutting, and contrast of continuum of movement, eventually your brain is just going to kind of

10:19.360 --> 10:24.720
tune out and sit back and enjoy the spectacle. It's like a firework show you're only half paying

10:24.720 --> 10:28.720
attention to because you're looking at your phone. And that is what some people are here for.

10:28.720 --> 10:30.880
That is what a lot of people are here for.

10:30.880 --> 10:35.760
But the visual language makes no distinction between what is important and what isn't.

10:35.760 --> 10:40.480
And while loud and noisome, its homogeneity in the form of being loud and noisome

10:40.480 --> 10:46.000
makes it difficult to absorb what is even going on. The way your eye moves takes brain processing

10:46.000 --> 10:50.640
power. The more your eye has to move around, the more work your brain has to do, the less

10:50.640 --> 10:56.400
information you're able to absorb. And again, this is not inherently a bad technique when the intent

10:56.400 --> 11:01.520
is motivated. And this is also not to say that Bay never slows down or focuses his frame. Again,

11:01.520 --> 11:05.840
this is part of why the first half of the first movie, I argue, is the strongest because it takes

11:05.840 --> 11:10.960
the time to set up important plot points visually. And the plot point of Sam's glasses, dumb as it

11:10.960 --> 11:17.120
is, at least you remember that's what the Autobots are interested in and why Sam matters. Take note,

11:17.120 --> 11:21.200
audience, extreme close-ups staying on the glasses means you need to remember the glasses. Therefore

11:21.200 --> 11:27.760
you remember the glasses. And I cannot say the same for the pillars in Transformers 3 or the

11:28.480 --> 11:37.520
whatever the problem was in Transformers 2 or 4. Transformium? How are you in every movie, Stanley

11:37.520 --> 11:42.080
Tucci? So as the films progress, when there is a relatively important piece of plot information

11:42.080 --> 11:46.240
being imparted, the language of the film does not tell your brain, this is important and you need to

11:46.240 --> 11:51.760
remember this. Or it doesn't sink in because every shot is given equal weight visually. The focus on

11:51.760 --> 12:00.160
visual spectacle increases and the editing gets sloppier. I want to pay special attention to the

12:00.160 --> 12:04.800
sequence in Dark of the Moon. Here we have two conflicting elements of film language. Shia's

12:04.800 --> 12:19.280
acting is in direct contradiction with the editing. His screaming is supposed to be humorous,

12:19.280 --> 12:24.320
but there is no time for the joke to land. There is no like moment where Bumblebee kind of playfully

12:24.320 --> 12:28.880
rips in with like a pop song or something. No moment where the audience is allowed to take a

12:28.880 --> 12:33.760
breath and collect itself before the next action sequence starts. No moment where Sam composes

12:33.760 --> 12:38.960
himself. He screams, the emotion of it has no time to land, and then the film cuts to the next scene.

12:38.960 --> 12:43.920
And the thing is, action scenes are uniquely hard to edit. Rapid cutting means the cuts need to match

12:43.920 --> 12:48.480
where the eye was on a previous cut. You having to work to figure out where the focus is in the

12:48.480 --> 12:52.960
new cut means your brain can't absorb information because it's too busy trying to figure out where

12:52.960 --> 12:57.440
to look. I wanted to incorporate the episode on film language into the greater discussion of

12:57.440 --> 13:04.160
auteur theory because this discussion is somewhat unique to Michael Bay and also rubs up against the

13:04.160 --> 13:11.520
greater thesis of this entire series, which is that the text of the film rubs up and often conflicts

13:11.520 --> 13:17.280
against the framing. And I hear you saying, text? What text? And yes, these movies have plots and

13:17.280 --> 13:21.920
stories and they are convoluted as hell and the director seems largely uninterested in the story

13:21.920 --> 13:26.240
and therefore does not create frames that complement the story, but rather creates frames

13:26.240 --> 13:32.560
designed for maximum spectacle. And spectacle is great if it is used with purpose, and if your film

13:32.560 --> 13:38.400
is all spectacle with no focus, then your audience is going to have a difficult time remembering

13:38.400 --> 13:44.080
which information is important to the plot and which information isn't.
