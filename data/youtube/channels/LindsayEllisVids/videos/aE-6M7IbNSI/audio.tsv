0	5280	The first time I saw Transformers, I saw it with my then-roommate, who was less,
5920	12480	shall we say, fascinated by the Michael Bay oeuvre than I was, even then. Two days later,
12480	19760	out of the blue, she says to me, did a robot pee on John Turturro in that movie? And I was like,
19760	25200	no, of course not, that's ridiculous. Why would a robot pee on John Turturro? And she was like,
25200	32480	no, that did happen. Bumblebee peed on John Turturro. In fact, I think it even had a bee-yoing
32480	45040	sound as its hubcap popped off before it peed on beloved indie icon John Turturro. I was like, no,
45040	50880	that did not happen. So of course I then had to see Transformers again, and I would say that,
50960	54880	although that second viewing ultimately threw me down a rabbit hole from which I had yet to emerge,
54880	65600	I realized something that day. Bumblebee peed on John Turturro. That was a thing that happened
65600	72960	in that movie, and somehow I did not remember it. Years later, I have watched Transformers 3
72960	76800	half a dozen times, and unless I have the Wikipedia article right in front of me,
77360	83760	I still have difficulty trying to explain the plot to you. And this isn't really so much an issue in
83760	90080	other visually busy action movie franchises. I remember what happened in Guardians of the Galaxy
90080	96160	both 1 and 2 pretty well, and I only saw either of those once. Which begs a question that I feel
96160	101360	like a lot of people know is a thing, but maybe have not even really thought to ask.
102320	108480	Why is it so difficult to remember what happens in these f***ing Transformers movies?
116160	120880	This ties into auteur theory because the answer to that question lies very much in the Bay
120880	127360	aesthetic, the way Bay technically puts his movies together. Some characteristics of the
127760	132880	Michael Bay aesthetic include helicopters at sunset, wide parallax,
135120	143600	standing into the frame, helicopters at sunset, robot helicopters, street lamps,
143600	151920	high color contrast, frequent rapid cutting, and helicopters after sunset. So if I were to
151920	158320	point out that the frame in the Transformers movies tend to be a touch...busy, I would be
158320	163120	roughly the 9 millionth person to point that out. What I want to do is tie in that idea with the
163120	168640	lack of impression these films make on the viewer, Bay's filmmaker ethos, and the language of film
168640	179120	in general. So let's say you have a person talking, me for instance right now, and besides some very
179120	185440	mild visual elements, the only information you are getting are my body language and the words
185440	191280	that are coming out of my mouth. So let's add to that a big block of text that has nothing to do
191280	196240	with what I am saying right now. You can either listen to me and what I'm saying, or you can read
196240	201440	the block of text. I mean, you could try to do both, but now you're working twice as hard to try
201440	207840	to absorb whatever is coming at you. And you can maybe listen to me and read the block of text and
207840	213040	actually absorb what is saying, but your ability for it to stick with you is diminished. The same
213040	218080	applies to film language. Your human brain has only so much processing power and has to be
218080	223440	absorbing film language information just as much as dialogue information. And if the film makes you
223440	227840	work too hard to absorb that information, your brain is going to get tired and frustrated by
227840	232320	that pretty quickly. If the information is too cluttered or too quick, you just won't absorb it,
232320	237360	but too slow, and it likes excitement, and then you get bored. This is why editing and framing are
237360	242320	much more integral aspects of film language than dialogue. In terms of sheer information,
242320	248560	where we are in time, what the tone is, what is even happening, you get far more raw information
248560	254000	than the words coming out of the actor's mouth from film language. Film language is all-encompassing.
254000	258000	Everything you see on screen uses film language, even if it's just pure blackness.
259040	266160	Much that once was is lost. Or whiteness. All of this tells your brain something, even if the
266160	272880	something is just the concept of the color white. Okay, I know white's not a color. Now let's add
272880	279680	something else. Maybe some reverb on my voice, and some angelic music. Even combining the very
279680	285680	simplest of elements in a frame can create a form of shorthand. Maybe I'm dead. And talking about
285680	294400	film language from the beyond. Maybe I am God. Maybe God is dead. Transformers. The nuances of
294400	300400	film language would be impossible to list because new ones are being developed literally every day.
300400	307200	Film language is extremely fluid. But simply put, all elements of the film, from the frame, to the
307200	313920	dialogue, to the editing, to the acting, all of these things convey information to the audience.
313920	319120	And some frames, by necessity, are more impactful than others. To borrow once again from Every
319120	324400	Frame a Painting's episode on Bayhem, Michael Bay tends not only to maximize visual impact in
324400	329920	important shots, shots that convey crucial plot information, but maximizes visual impact in every
329920	337200	shot. Bay's aesthetic is a series of dynamic shots and no non-dynamic ones. So rather than a visual
337200	343280	intensity rising and falling as the story does, the visuals in Michael Bay's movies hang around
343280	347680	a nine or a ten. Meaning that every frame is telling you that this information is of max
347680	354480	importance and therefore it is harder to retain it. Let's talk about visual contrast and affinity
354480	362640	and its impact on what the audience absorbs. Be it with cinematography, editing, sound, lighting.
364160	371280	You have contrast and you have affinity. Affinity means similarity. Contrast means contrast.
371280	377840	A general rule of thumb. Contrast is generally more striking and therefore more impactful.
377840	383120	Affinity is less striking and therefore less impactful. That does not mean that one is better
383120	387440	than the other. In fact, you need both in order to make a coherent film. Let's look at a scene
387440	392960	from Psycho. In this scene, Norman is giving Marion a sandwich. Norman is attracted to Marion,
392960	396400	but has a lot of shame in the form of the mother personality. This is an important
396400	401040	scene because at the end of it, Marion decides that she needs to leave and go back to her real
401040	406080	life and own up to the consequences of what she's done. It's a very long dialogue scene with a lot
406080	411280	of shot-reverse-shot. Maximum viewer impact happens upon the first time you see a shot.
411280	416240	This is why shot-reverse-shot gets kind of dull if the frame never changes. And this is also why
416240	421280	changing the shots needs to be motivated. The frame on Norman changes when Marion challenges
421280	430880	the idea of Norman's mother. We go from a more conventional frame to a frame with more tonal
430880	434560	contrast, that is more pronounced blacks and whites, and also with a bird of doom in the
434560	439360	background. And it changes again when Marion suggests that Norman institutionalized his mother
439360	449600	and he turns on her. The frame changes when the beat and tone of the scene change and the tension
449600	454320	builds. I use the example of Psycho because the changes in the frame are highly motivated. After
454320	458720	a long stretch of visual affinity, the visual contrast of the new frame tells the viewer that
458720	462560	this is an important shift and needs to be remembered. Bay understands that the more times
462560	467120	you cut back to the same frame, you lose some tension, which is why you so rarely see a cut
467120	472400	back and forth to the same frame in a Michael Bay movie. His camera is always moving, he rarely uses
472400	478000	traditional shot-reverse-shot, and he rarely cuts back to the same frame. Visual contrast can be of
478000	483920	tone, of hue, of movement, but in editing, when the focus falls in the same place from shot to shot,
483920	488240	that is called affinity of continuum of movement. Haven't I seen you before?
491760	495600	Maybe. When the focus falls in two different places from shot to shot,
495600	498480	that is called contrast of continuum of movement.
498880	502800	You may have heard of the centering technique used in Mad Max Fury Road. The cinematographer
502800	506640	deliberately kept the action in the center of the shot during the action scenes,
506640	510400	so editor Margaret Sixel would have maximum temporal freedom in the edit,
510400	514560	meaning she could make the shots go for as long or as short as she desired. And she had that
514560	519520	freedom because the focus is always in the same place from shot to shot, the center of the frame.
519520	524320	This is a good example of affinity of continuum of movement. The continuum of movement is the
524720	528080	This is a good example of affinity of continuum of movement.
528080	530960	The continuum of movement in Transformers action scenes
531760	536080	kind of goes back and forth. Sometimes there is excellent affinity of continuum of movement,
538880	540560	and sometimes there's a lot of contrast.
545920	550800	That is not to say that contrast of continuum of movement in action scenes is always a bad thing
550800	555280	when it is used deliberately. There is a scene in Batman Begins where the Bat-Man
557360	561840	uses Scarecrow's scare tactics against him and it's really hard to follow what's going on in
561840	566880	the scene. This scene is meant to be intentionally disorienting, to give some menace to Batman,
566880	571600	as we see him from the point of view of the criminal. But it is important to know also
571600	575600	that this is not consistent with the rest of the visual style of the film.
575600	580880	This style of editing is used very rarely, therefore it is memorable when it does happen.
580880	584880	Most of the film is shot very traditionally, so when you do have a scene that deliberately
584880	589600	uses a lot of contrast of continuum of movement, not only does the audience remember the scene,
589600	594160	the intended effect helps the audience remember the scene, rather than diminishes your ability
594160	599360	to do so. Here's an example of rapid fire cutting and contrast of continuum of movement to create
599360	604000	a desired effect. In the Transformers movies, especially the later ones, there's little focus
604000	608800	of where the eye is supposed to be, especially when the robots are on screen. So when you combine
608800	614240	visually confusing character design, no clear focus in the frame, the rapid fire nature of
614240	619360	the cutting, and contrast of continuum of movement, eventually your brain is just going to kind of
619360	624720	tune out and sit back and enjoy the spectacle. It's like a firework show you're only half paying
624720	628720	attention to because you're looking at your phone. And that is what some people are here for.
628720	630880	That is what a lot of people are here for.
630880	635760	But the visual language makes no distinction between what is important and what isn't.
635760	640480	And while loud and noisome, its homogeneity in the form of being loud and noisome
640480	646000	makes it difficult to absorb what is even going on. The way your eye moves takes brain processing
646000	650640	power. The more your eye has to move around, the more work your brain has to do, the less
650640	656400	information you're able to absorb. And again, this is not inherently a bad technique when the intent
656400	661520	is motivated. And this is also not to say that Bay never slows down or focuses his frame. Again,
661520	665840	this is part of why the first half of the first movie, I argue, is the strongest because it takes
665840	670960	the time to set up important plot points visually. And the plot point of Sam's glasses, dumb as it
670960	677120	is, at least you remember that's what the Autobots are interested in and why Sam matters. Take note,
677120	681200	audience, extreme close-ups staying on the glasses means you need to remember the glasses. Therefore
681200	687760	you remember the glasses. And I cannot say the same for the pillars in Transformers 3 or the
688480	697520	whatever the problem was in Transformers 2 or 4. Transformium? How are you in every movie, Stanley
697520	702080	Tucci? So as the films progress, when there is a relatively important piece of plot information
702080	706240	being imparted, the language of the film does not tell your brain, this is important and you need to
706240	711760	remember this. Or it doesn't sink in because every shot is given equal weight visually. The focus on
711760	720160	visual spectacle increases and the editing gets sloppier. I want to pay special attention to the
720160	724800	sequence in Dark of the Moon. Here we have two conflicting elements of film language. Shia's
724800	739280	acting is in direct contradiction with the editing. His screaming is supposed to be humorous,
739280	744320	but there is no time for the joke to land. There is no like moment where Bumblebee kind of playfully
744320	748880	rips in with like a pop song or something. No moment where the audience is allowed to take a
748880	753760	breath and collect itself before the next action sequence starts. No moment where Sam composes
753760	758960	himself. He screams, the emotion of it has no time to land, and then the film cuts to the next scene.
758960	763920	And the thing is, action scenes are uniquely hard to edit. Rapid cutting means the cuts need to match
763920	768480	where the eye was on a previous cut. You having to work to figure out where the focus is in the
768480	772960	new cut means your brain can't absorb information because it's too busy trying to figure out where
772960	777440	to look. I wanted to incorporate the episode on film language into the greater discussion of
777440	784160	auteur theory because this discussion is somewhat unique to Michael Bay and also rubs up against the
784160	791520	greater thesis of this entire series, which is that the text of the film rubs up and often conflicts
791520	797280	against the framing. And I hear you saying, text? What text? And yes, these movies have plots and
797280	801920	stories and they are convoluted as hell and the director seems largely uninterested in the story
801920	806240	and therefore does not create frames that complement the story, but rather creates frames
806240	812560	designed for maximum spectacle. And spectacle is great if it is used with purpose, and if your film
812560	818400	is all spectacle with no focus, then your audience is going to have a difficult time remembering
818400	824080	which information is important to the plot and which information isn't.
