1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello and welcome. This is my old friend from film school days, Mark I, David McCracken.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Savviest of viewers might remember him as Michael Bay.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yeah, my hair's no wig this time.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yeah, with the dollar, yeah, whenever in the nostalgic days of earliest and least effort.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Sweet, young, lovely, beautiful, Michael Bay.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
But I still have the Michael Bay thing that I hold to this day.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You were actually one of the first Michael Bay apologists I think I ever met.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yeah, I think so, yeah, because coming to film school it was, you know, everybody likes their auteurs

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and you and I both said we like helicopters at sunset.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yeah, helicopters at sunset.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So we bonded, yeah.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I asked David to come on so we could talk about screenwriting and micro-budget filmmaking

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,000
because he is in the very last processes of finishing his solo directorial feature film, Bullet County.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's not something we can erase.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I saw a lion there.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
In all the wet ferns and moss.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Is blood black in the moonlight.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Can you give us the, as we were taught...

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Elevator pitch.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Elevator pitch.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The power drill pitch.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The pitch that you have to go in between drills.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yeah.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah, it's basically, it's an action thriller that is about four friends on the Kentucky bourbon trail in the 70s.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
They're trying to relive the good old days.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
They did the trail ten years ago in college.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And so one of them's getting married.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So his best man says, hey, why don't we do it again and actually finish it?

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Because we didn't finish it last time.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But there's, along the way they discover that there's buried Prohibition money out in Kentucky somewhere.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So they go looking for that.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And as is wont to do with characters finding money, you know, they start getting greedy and tearing each other apart and that kind of thing.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But it's very, I mean, the term gets thrown around a lot, but it is very Coen Brothers-y in terms of it's funny.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's black humor.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You know, you get some moments of violence.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And so we've kind of pitched it as the Shining meets No Country for Old Men.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Right now they're running a Kickstarter.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Can you give us the sales pitch?

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So the Kickstarter is for finishing funds.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So like you said, we're pretty much done.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But the Kickstarter is to get us final color correction, you know, final VFX and that kind of thing.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So like we're having a poster done by Akiko who did It Follows and Blue Ruin and that kind of thing.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So it's basically to help us complete the film, which we actually have just successfully funded.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But now we're trying to get to, I think, $50,000 so that all backers who contribute $25,000 or more will get a Blu-ray of it.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yeah, so it's, you know, like anything, as you're making a movie you budget out for certain things.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And then you realize some things are more costly.

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So hence finishing funds and Kickstarters and that kind of thing.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What was your budget originally for the actual shooting?

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
For production only?

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That one I don't know.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I think we were trying to aim for the whole movie to be about $200,000.

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So the idea was pull as many favors as we could initially and for production.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And we always knew that Kickstarter was a big possibility as for a lot of indie films it is.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But this one we thought we would try to, if we were going to do a Kickstarter, to do it at the end so that we actually had something to show for it.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Instead of, you know, a lot of Kickstarters are the potential for a movie.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You know, help me get it off the ground and the movie most likely won't get finished or even started because it ends up costing more all the complications.

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So we thought if we got through production, got through editing, got it far enough along to where it had to be completed,

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
then the Kickstarter made more sense to incentivize people.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Well, I guess that's sort of the thing though.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I feel like movies are more sure if they're indie.

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Because you hear all these horror stories of studio movies that even get greenlit and maybe even start production and then you're like, no, you can't.

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah, I think a lot of it must be passion or some kind of drive on the part of the filmmakers.

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,000
If they really want to get it done, they'll pull out all the stops and they'll work on it for as long as they possibly can to get it finished.

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Well, you have to.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I mean, it's so thankless and it's so competitive.

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I think maybe that's true in all arts, but not to demoralize, but it's just like it's so crowded and it's so hard to even be noticed.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah, that's why I think a lot of it has to do with, honestly, talent.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I mean, there's business savvy and there's that kind of thing, but it really is hoping that you can put together a strong enough team that all cares about the project enough to bring it to fruition and, you know, take a hit on their paycheck or be willing to live in a house.

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And in this case, in Indiana and Kentucky, which is where we shot it because it takes place in the Bourbon Trail.

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
But, you know, to kind of rely on people's passion for the material, you know, or passion for power drills.

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I think that's a really underrated subject.

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yes.

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
How did you find your crew?

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You know, people that actually give enough of a shit to go through the hell of low budget filmmaking.

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Well, there was a long brainwashing process when I put them in a dentist chair.

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The drills reminded me of that.

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Did you have like the eye drops?

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Eye drops.

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yeah.

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But, yeah, it was actually a combination of things.

84
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
One of them was USC initially.

85
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I did what was called a 546.

86
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You did a 547.

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I did a 547.

88
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yours was the nonfiction.

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Mine was the fiction.

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yeah.

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I did a documentary.

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yeah.

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yeah.

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So on that one, I had a really good crew on that, a really good cast.

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And so after working on that, I took the lead actor from that, wrote a feature for him, and the DP from that.

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And then through other channels at USC, from professors and that kind of thing, just really, while I was, you know, fully employed elsewhere,

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:52,000
we were putting together this movie, and I was just taking meetings and meeting people through other, you know, USC channels, friends of friends, friends.

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So, I mean, a lot of it was trying to find that nice Venn diagram of passion, but not too crazy, but crazy enough to want to leave L.A. for a month.

99
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I just noticed you have a USC ring.

100
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I do.

101
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You know, I got this because, you know, did you get a class ring?

102
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
No.

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I didn't either because they're like $700.

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yeah.

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I was like, I know it's University of Spoiled Children, but come on.

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah.

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So my day of graduation, the day of walking, we went to the bookstore, and, you know, there's all the class rings and stuff.

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And I saw this for like $40 or $50, and I thought, I'll get this, and it'll basically be my wedding ring to my debt.

109
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So when I pay off my debt, I'm going to throw this into Mount Doom and get rid of it.

110
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah, so it always reminds me.

111
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So, actually, that kind of brings me to another discussion point, which is, like, I've talked on this channel about film school before.

112
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah.

113
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That was with a colleague who went to a more vocational school, whereas I had gone to USC, and I hadn't at the time.

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
At the time, I was a dropout.

115
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Now I'm a graduate almost.

116
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yeah.

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But I guess now the question of film school, would you say it was worth it?

118
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yeah, it's, you know, I think about that a lot every time my credit card gets hit with more debt payments.

119
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Every time your credit score gets down because your debt is so ballooning.

120
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Ballooning, it's like a tick.

121
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yeah, you can't tear down the principal, you're just paying off interest.

122
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You don't really know what you didn't know, so you don't really know how much you learned or were absorbed.

123
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And it's also about the relationships.

124
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Like, we wouldn't have met.

125
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I wouldn't have met any, like, the people that worked on this movie.

126
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Like, anybody who worked on this movie that I even met, you know, three people removed from USC, I wouldn't know.

127
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So this crew would be completely different.

128
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The cast would be completely different.

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
This crew is like, it's a racket.

130
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yeah, that's right.

131
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I went there.

132
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I sent my kids.

133
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I really shouldn't have filmed in an aviator.

134
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That was a bad call.

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But the beauty of nature.

136
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That's right.

137
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Those aren't planes, they're just pterodactyls.

138
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah, no, this is like, your movie was shot outside mostly.

139
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This is outside.

140
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I like nature.

141
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's like, it's so controllable.

142
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Oh my gosh.

143
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yeah, we were in a color session the other day, and it was just, the colorist was going...

144
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It was just speckled trees, lighting was all over the place.

145
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
This is like an aviary airport.

146
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Oh my gosh, I know.

147
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's not really either or indie or studio, but I guess one of the questions is why you decided to go almost full indie

148
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
instead of either going with a financier or clawing your way up through the studio system,

149
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
as some of our other classmates are doing.

150
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I think a lot of it is control.

151
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Like we have control right now.

152
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yeah, exactly.

153
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
This is a metaphor.

154
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This is all post.

155
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Intentional AF.

156
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah, we added the birds and the hammers after we shot.

157
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
This was actually really funny.

158
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
We're actually like in the middle of nowhere, it's really creepy.

159
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
This is green screen, we're improv-ing off nothing, and then we just, yeah, the sirens.

160
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But yeah, I think a lot of it's control in a number of ways, but mostly because ironically, as you know,

161
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
in this industry, people don't have a lot of imagination, so you could give them a script,

162
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and you could say like, here's what I want to do, here's exactly this, this, here's the cast, here's everything.

163
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Just throw me 200 grand, which means nothing to a lot of people.

164
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And they would just say no or not get it.

165
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So I think a lot of it is just let's make it, then no imagination, here's the movie.

166
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I mean, it definitely is a starting point, and it's a gamble in a lot of ways, but at the same time,

167
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I don't really know of any other way to do it than using the siren.

168
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Oh wait, I just had a heart attack, that's why they're coming, I'm dead.

169
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Forgot to tell you.

170
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yeah, it's the studio system coming for us.

171
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
If you want it done right, do it yourself, do it with as much control as you can,

172
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and then hope for the best, hope it turns out, but that's like anything, you don't have control ultimately.

173
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But at least you have a movie to show for it instead of a script.

174
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Because I know a lot of times, and I was frustrated with this and a lot of people are,

175
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
is you can have a great script that you believe in, but it's even hard to get your friends to read it and get notes.

176
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It feels like homework.

177
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Yeah, because we were talking about this the other day, nobody cares until everybody cares.

178
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And this is something, people please stop asking me to read your scripts and your novels.

179
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's not cool.

180
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Whenever I say it's skilled labor, it is.

181
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Especially for us, we both have master's degrees.

182
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Asking for feedback, it's time consuming, and it's kind of a job.

183
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
There's a reason people get paid for that.

184
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yeah, it's tough and it's also, you know, a lot of people want to say,

185
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm going to work with Spielberg one day, but it is all about your peers and coming up together with your peers.

186
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So, you know, have your friends and people whose opinions you trust.

187
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I mean, yeah, it's great to have somebody with a lot of know-how read something,

188
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
but they also don't get your voice as much.

189
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
They might not be able to be as prescriptive or as helpful as maybe somebody who knows you better.

190
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But at the end of the day, you're really just fighting a losing battle, trying to get your thing read.

191
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I think it depends on your goal, but I think also it is really hard to get people,

192
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
again, if they don't know you, unless they're an agent and they're actively looking,

193
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
then yeah, it is totally fighting a losing battle.

194
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Especially in Hollywood, where like you said, people are interested in ideas,

195
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
they're not really interested in quality.

196
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah, I mean, I even had a lot of situations when we crewed up for Bullet County where, you know,

197
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I was going to have a meeting with, say, a costume designer or something,

198
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
send them the script, have a meeting with them, and they hadn't even read it.

199
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So, you know, at the point that people who you could employ,

200
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
especially in a lot of cases it was going to be their first feature as that department head,

201
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
and they're not even reading it, you know.

202
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Like, it's tough to get people to read your work, for sure.

203
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yeah, and it's like, it's not necessarily a reflection on your work,

204
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
but I think you need to understand that it's like, while it kind of sucks,

205
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
because, you know, it's like you, by the very nature of the creative act,

206
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
you have to care way more than is rational.

207
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's so hard working, like, just working for so long on a thing,

208
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
and it's kind of one thing that if you're going to go anywhere,

209
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
you have to accept that nobody cares.

210
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Even, like, your mother, like, nobody cares.

211
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Nobody cares.

212
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Until everybody cares.

213
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Right, and they'll care for selfish reasons, for fame or, you know,

214
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
for their own betterment or money or something.

215
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But, like, yeah, I mean, even, you know, you find out even running, you know,

216
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
like a Kickstarter or something, you're essentially trying to get your cast

217
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and crew to care about getting the movie funded and finished.

218
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And even then, like, the percentage of people that care is a huge drop-off,

219
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
and they're all people who worked on the movie and gave, you know,

220
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
many months of their lives to it.

221
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So even then, yeah, it's just important to remember that you've been in this bubble,

222
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
this creative bubble, and nobody else has that perspective.

223
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yeah, exactly.

224
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I think that there's maybe a little, it's kind of not really helping anyone,

225
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
this sort of, you know, people are going to care because you're special,

226
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,000
when, you know, the reality is people are, you know, like you said, it's selfish.

227
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And there's nothing really wrong with that because, you know,

228
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
we all got places to be and people to do, but.

229
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Yeah, it's kind of this weird balance of having perspective on what we're talking about,

230
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
of nobody's going to care as much about your work as you are,

231
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
but your job is to make them care as much as possible,

232
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,000
like enough to read your work or watch your movie or work on your movie in some degree.

233
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And it is hard, and you're not always going to pull it off, but at least,

234
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I mean, that's how you get a movie made.

235
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You get people to care enough either for money purposes or to further their career

236
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
or because they really passionately believe in it.

237
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And, you know, in the indie world, it's not for money,

238
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
so you're really fighting an uphill battle to get people who care about whatever you've, you know, written.

239
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So with all that in mind, how do you stay motivated?

240
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Um, alcohol.

241
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I mean, besides that.

242
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Besides the obvious.

243
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Liquid courage.

244
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I have to think that I have something to say,

245
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
something to say in a different way than I've seen before.

246
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's not like reinventing the wheel or anything,

247
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
but, you know, you hear a lot of movie pitches like, you know,

248
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
like I was saying, The Shining meets No Country for Old Men or whatever it is.

249
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Like, I haven't quite seen that movie, so that's new somewhat.

250
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And I think a lot of it is just, um, believe it.

251
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It sounds hippy-dippy, but believe in yourself.

252
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Like, you really do have to believe in yourself

253
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
because there will come points where nobody else will,

254
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
and you either use that to keep going or it'll kill you, you know,

255
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
or you'll stop doing it.

256
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And, you know, yeah, sometimes it takes realistic expectations

257
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
and you think maybe this isn't for me.

258
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
But I think a lot of it is I've found,

259
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
and I think we've talked about this before,

260
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
you kind of get shark-brained a lot and you just don't even think about it.

261
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's like at the point that you just can do nothing else

262
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
and you have to do that,

263
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
then there's really no second guessing because you're just doing it.

264
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You're almost the robot.

265
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
No, I think that's necessary.

266
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
To me it's necessary.

267
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Like, you have to shark-brain sometimes.

268
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And I think a lot of people get hung up on the what will people think.

269
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Yeah, yeah, don't.

270
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And that is, you know, it's like fear is the mind killer.

271
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's that, you know, don't get hung up on that.

272
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Even if it's just like, is this problematic?

273
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Are people going to hate me?

274
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You know, I mean, don't be a racist, but.

275
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Well, because you're always going to have to defend yourself.

276
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You're always going to have to, you know,

277
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
people are going to say take that scene out or it's not worth shooting

278
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
or take it out of the movie

279
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
or the score should be this way and not that way.

280
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And, you know, yeah, they might present a good case

281
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
and you might say, yeah, you know, because you want to field ideas.

282
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
But if it's something you really want in there,

283
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
for whatever reason, stick to your guns, you know, if you can.

284
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Has that been a process to actually figure out how

285
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
or were you always kind of there?

286
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
No, it's always a process

287
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
because I think a lot of it is you do want to remain open minded enough

288
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
to take good ideas.

289
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
But you also don't want to lose sight of what it is that you're doing

290
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
or what you're trying to say.

291
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
For this one, you know, for me being so involved in it,

292
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
like I wrote, directed it.

293
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
My producing partner and I kind of co-produced it

294
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
in terms of, you know, pre-production and that kind of thing

295
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
and pulling a lot of our resources.

296
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
So we were...

297
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You made that joke about the aviary.

298
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Now I can't stop.

299
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Now I can't, yeah.

300
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I can't unhear it. Sorry.

301
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I just want that dish to be a laser and to shoot.

302
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Just a plane killer, yeah.

303
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Plane killer.

304
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You'll show you to wreck my student film.

305
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
This is for YouTube. This is an amateur hour.

306
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I think we're like the kind of defending yourself

307
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
versus fielding ideas from other people

308
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
really came to fruition in the editorial process.

309
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
So when you get to editorial,

310
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
you've spent money on certain things.

311
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You've, you know, acted your heart out.

312
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You've written scenes that you really like.

313
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
So there were several scenes in it that I wrote.

314
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
There was a scene I really liked

315
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
and it was a monologue that my character had

316
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
and I actually think I acted pretty well in it.

317
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
But we cut it out, you know,

318
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
because you're like it just doesn't further the movie.

319
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's slowing it down for pace reasons.

320
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
There was another scene that was

321
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
one of the most expensive scenes we shot

322
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
and we cut it out, you know.

323
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And it's all in service of that movie,

324
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
at the end of the day.

325
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
So for all those aspiring indie filmmakers out there,

326
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
what advice do you have,

327
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
now that you're almost on the other side

328
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
of having a finished product?

329
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I mean, the advice is simple.

330
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
If you believe in it enough,

331
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
just really don't stop and do it.

332
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Don't do it.

333
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Don't do it.

334
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I don't need the competition for one.

335
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
She's just like,

336
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I don't want to see your white supremacist manifesto,

337
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
to be honest.

338
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I've seen enough curb stomping.

339
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Jesus Christ.

340
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Never give up on your dreams.

341
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It's true though.

342
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Because I think the other thing is like,

343
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I think people really have a hard time

344
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
with this idea that

345
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
the first thing out of the gate

346
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
is going to be your breakout

347
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
rather than just be,

348
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
like you said,

349
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
you've already shot a feature before.

350
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You did 546.

351
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You were at USC for several years.

352
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
This isn't your first rodeo.

353
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Plus, you actually worked in the industry.

354
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Yeah, it's a lot of it.

355
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I mean, you hate to be so nebulous,

356
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
but it is all a learning process.

357
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And I know that, you know,

358
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
we've all learned lessons

359
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
and made the next movie better.

360
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It may not be a better film overall,

361
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
but there may have been things

362
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
that you've done better overall.

363
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And it's all a continuum.

364
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And so, like you said,

365
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
yeah, your first thing

366
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
is not going to be the best,

367
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
most likely,

368
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
unless you're, you know, some savant.

369
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
There's a part of me that wishes

370
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I could find my

371
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Phantom of the Opera fan fiction

372
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
from 2001.

373
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Well, at least I can have that right now.

374
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm doing a live reading.

375
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yeah, like we were saying,

376
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
you have to believe in yourself.

377
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You have to work really hard,

378
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
but you also have to

379
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
not think about it too much.

380
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah.

381
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And just go on autopilot

382
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
and really work hard.

383
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And that is a skill.

384
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It is hard work.

385
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And I think it's just like,

386
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
it's one of those skills that,

387
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
you know, it's not like you,

388
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
it's not like nirvana,

389
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
like you reach it,

390
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
like, I'm here.

391
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It's like, you,

392
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
it's always kind of a process

393
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
to just stay, like, sane

394
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
through the process of creating

395
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
and, you know,

396
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
care way too much

397
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
and accept that nobody cares

398
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
until everybody cares.

399
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Yeah.

400
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Like, do you know anybody

401
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
who's been successful

402
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
in this industry

403
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
that hasn't worked their ass off?

404
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I don't know of any.

405
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I mean, unless it's...

406
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah, I can think of a few people

407
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
who, like, maybe you were,

408
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
are legacies.

409
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Yeah, legacy people.

410
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Let's put it that way.

411
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Legacy people maybe didn't work as,

412
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I mean, they think they did, but...

413
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Sure.

414
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Yeah, yeah.

415
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
But, I mean, in general,

416
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
like, a lot of the people

417
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I've worked with or know

418
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
or respect,

419
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I mean, they just worked really hard.

420
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Yeah, like Ryan.

421
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
He was always, like, kind of...

422
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Yeah, he worked really hard.

423
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Like, I remember, like,

424
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
looking at him and being like,

425
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
no, I never could do, like,

426
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
you know, just the motivation.

427
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Like, I mean,

428
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I look at his success

429
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
and I'm just not really

430
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
terribly surprised

431
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
just because of, like,

432
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
yeah, he was just really,

433
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
really high energy.

434
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yeah.

435
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And I don't feel like

436
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I ever saw him be like...

437
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Really?

438
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I mean, because what is it

439
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
that there's that kind of adage

440
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
that you make it in this industry

441
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
because you just outlast

442
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
everybody else, you know?

443
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And you and I both know

444
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
a ton of people

445
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
who we went to USC with

446
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
who aren't in the industry anymore.

447
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
They moved back

448
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
or they just fell out of love with it

449
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
for whatever reason.

450
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Yeah, because I...

451
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Honestly, like,

452
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
because I did work in post

453
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
for a while like you did

454
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
and part of the reason

455
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
why I decided

456
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I was going to leave

457
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
the industry side of things

458
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
and do writing

459
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
and YouTube full time

460
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
was just because

461
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I didn't have the passion for it,

462
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
especially post production,

463
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
and I was like,

464
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I can't half-ass two things.

465
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Yeah, and it's not

466
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
a sign of failure either.

467
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I mean, I've tried

468
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
so many things

469
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
that I've had a passion for

470
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
and just, eh,

471
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
it's not for me, you know,

472
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
and there's no harm in it.

473
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Bullitt County will be out

474
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
whenever the,

475
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I guess the end

476
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
of the festival process.

477
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Yeah.

478
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
That could be

479
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
another conversation.

480
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Oh my, yeah, yeah.

481
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's just kind of

482
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
seeing where it goes,

483
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
but so far,

484
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
everybody who's seen it

485
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
likes it and it's all

486
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
they can hope for.

487
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Well, congratulations

488
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
on finishing.

489
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Thank you.

490
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
That in and of itself

491
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
is like,

492
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
y'all ain't even know.

493
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
It's a bit, you know,

494
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
it's, you know, high five.

495
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Thank you.

496
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Anything buried out there

497
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
is meant to stay buried.

498
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
David, you're at

499
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Mr. Pictures Film

500
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
on Twitter, Instagram,

501
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
and Facebook?

502
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Yes.

503
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
With your co-producer

504
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
and also...

505
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
We're getting a YouTube

506
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
thing going,

507
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
but it's, yeah, slow.

508
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
We've been too busy

509
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
on this movie.

510
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I know, I know.

511
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
We're also on YouPorn.

512
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Just look for us.

513
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Mr. Dishes.

514
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Not Pornhub.

515
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
No, not Pornhub.

516
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Because their search interface

517
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
is so much better.

518
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Yeah, really.

519
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Yeah.

520
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Come to think of it,

521
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
we should get on Pornhub.

522
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Yeah.

523
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
What are you doing?

524
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
They have better comments.

525
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Also, the link to his

526
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Kickstarter is below.

527
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
It's like,

528
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
depending on when you see this,

529
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
it should be still going

530
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
for another couple days

531
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
if you want to support

532
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
indie film.

533
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Yeah, so if you want

534
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
to see some scenes

535
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
from the movie

536
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
that are almost completed,

537
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
go to the update section

538
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
in Kickstarter

539
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
and there's some

540
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
scenes in there.

541
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
All right, great.

542
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Well, David,

543
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
hopefully we'll be having

544
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
a different conversation

545
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
five or ten years from now

546
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
that we'll look back on this

547
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
and laugh at the time

548
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
we chatted in the aviary.

549
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I'll still be doing

550
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Michael Bay impressions.

551
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Yeah, we need to get

552
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
your dollar sign hat back.

553
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Well, thank you for coming.

554
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Thank you.
