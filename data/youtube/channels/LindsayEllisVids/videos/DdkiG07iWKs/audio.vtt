00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Hello and welcome. This is my old friend from film school days, Mark I, David McCracken.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
Hello.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
Savviest of viewers might remember him as Michael Bay.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
Yeah, my hair's no wig this time.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
Yeah, with the dollar, yeah, whenever in the nostalgic days of earliest and least effort.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.000
Sweet, young, lovely, beautiful, Michael Bay.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
But I still have the Michael Bay thing that I hold to this day.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
You were actually one of the first Michael Bay apologists I think I ever met.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
Yeah, I think so, yeah, because coming to film school it was, you know, everybody likes their auteurs

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
and you and I both said we like helicopters at sunset.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Yeah, helicopters at sunset.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
So we bonded, yeah.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
I asked David to come on so we could talk about screenwriting and micro-budget filmmaking

00:52.000 --> 01:02.000
because he is in the very last processes of finishing his solo directorial feature film, Bullet County.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Yeah.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
It's not something we can erase.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
I saw a lion there.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
In all the wet ferns and moss.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Is blood black in the moonlight.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Can you give us the, as we were taught...

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Elevator pitch.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Elevator pitch.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
The power drill pitch.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
The pitch that you have to go in between drills.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Yeah.

01:30.000 --> 01:39.000
Yeah, it's basically, it's an action thriller that is about four friends on the Kentucky bourbon trail in the 70s.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
They're trying to relive the good old days.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
They did the trail ten years ago in college.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
And so one of them's getting married.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
So his best man says, hey, why don't we do it again and actually finish it?

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Because we didn't finish it last time.

01:50.000 --> 01:57.000
But there's, along the way they discover that there's buried Prohibition money out in Kentucky somewhere.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
So they go looking for that.

01:58.000 --> 02:06.000
And as is wont to do with characters finding money, you know, they start getting greedy and tearing each other apart and that kind of thing.

02:06.000 --> 02:13.000
But it's very, I mean, the term gets thrown around a lot, but it is very Coen Brothers-y in terms of it's funny.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
It's black humor.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
You know, you get some moments of violence.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
And so we've kind of pitched it as the Shining meets No Country for Old Men.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Right now they're running a Kickstarter.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Can you give us the sales pitch?

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Yeah.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
So the Kickstarter is for finishing funds.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
So like you said, we're pretty much done.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
But the Kickstarter is to get us final color correction, you know, final VFX and that kind of thing.

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
So like we're having a poster done by Akiko who did It Follows and Blue Ruin and that kind of thing.

02:46.000 --> 02:55.000
So it's basically to help us complete the film, which we actually have just successfully funded.

02:55.000 --> 03:04.000
But now we're trying to get to, I think, $50,000 so that all backers who contribute $25,000 or more will get a Blu-ray of it.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
Yeah, so it's, you know, like anything, as you're making a movie you budget out for certain things.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
And then you realize some things are more costly.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
So hence finishing funds and Kickstarters and that kind of thing.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
What was your budget originally for the actual shooting?

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
For production only?

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
That one I don't know.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
I think we were trying to aim for the whole movie to be about $200,000.

03:28.000 --> 03:35.000
So the idea was pull as many favors as we could initially and for production.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.000
And we always knew that Kickstarter was a big possibility as for a lot of indie films it is.

03:41.000 --> 03:49.000
But this one we thought we would try to, if we were going to do a Kickstarter, to do it at the end so that we actually had something to show for it.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
Instead of, you know, a lot of Kickstarters are the potential for a movie.

03:54.000 --> 04:02.000
You know, help me get it off the ground and the movie most likely won't get finished or even started because it ends up costing more all the complications.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
So we thought if we got through production, got through editing, got it far enough along to where it had to be completed,

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
then the Kickstarter made more sense to incentivize people.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Well, I guess that's sort of the thing though.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
I feel like movies are more sure if they're indie.

04:19.000 --> 04:27.000
Because you hear all these horror stories of studio movies that even get greenlit and maybe even start production and then you're like, no, you can't.

04:27.000 --> 04:33.000
Yeah, I think a lot of it must be passion or some kind of drive on the part of the filmmakers.

04:33.000 --> 04:41.000
If they really want to get it done, they'll pull out all the stops and they'll work on it for as long as they possibly can to get it finished.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Well, you have to.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
I mean, it's so thankless and it's so competitive.

04:47.000 --> 04:57.000
I think maybe that's true in all arts, but not to demoralize, but it's just like it's so crowded and it's so hard to even be noticed.

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
Yeah, that's why I think a lot of it has to do with, honestly, talent.

05:04.000 --> 05:22.000
I mean, there's business savvy and there's that kind of thing, but it really is hoping that you can put together a strong enough team that all cares about the project enough to bring it to fruition and, you know, take a hit on their paycheck or be willing to live in a house.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.000
And in this case, in Indiana and Kentucky, which is where we shot it because it takes place in the Bourbon Trail.

05:28.000 --> 05:35.000
But, you know, to kind of rely on people's passion for the material, you know, or passion for power drills.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
I think that's a really underrated subject.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Yes.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
How did you find your crew?

05:40.000 --> 05:48.000
You know, people that actually give enough of a shit to go through the hell of low budget filmmaking.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
Well, there was a long brainwashing process when I put them in a dentist chair.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
The drills reminded me of that.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Did you have like the eye drops?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Eye drops.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Yeah.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
But, yeah, it was actually a combination of things.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
One of them was USC initially.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
I did what was called a 546.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
You did a 547.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
I did a 547.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Yours was the nonfiction.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Mine was the fiction.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Yeah.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
I did a documentary.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Yeah.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Yeah.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
So on that one, I had a really good crew on that, a really good cast.

06:24.000 --> 06:35.000
And so after working on that, I took the lead actor from that, wrote a feature for him, and the DP from that.

06:35.000 --> 06:44.000
And then through other channels at USC, from professors and that kind of thing, just really, while I was, you know, fully employed elsewhere,

06:44.000 --> 06:52.000
we were putting together this movie, and I was just taking meetings and meeting people through other, you know, USC channels, friends of friends, friends.

06:52.000 --> 07:01.000
So, I mean, a lot of it was trying to find that nice Venn diagram of passion, but not too crazy, but crazy enough to want to leave L.A. for a month.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
I just noticed you have a USC ring.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
I do.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
You know, I got this because, you know, did you get a class ring?

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
No.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
I didn't either because they're like $700.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Yeah.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
I was like, I know it's University of Spoiled Children, but come on.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Yeah.

07:14.000 --> 07:21.000
So my day of graduation, the day of walking, we went to the bookstore, and, you know, there's all the class rings and stuff.

07:21.000 --> 07:30.000
And I saw this for like $40 or $50, and I thought, I'll get this, and it'll basically be my wedding ring to my debt.

07:30.000 --> 07:36.000
So when I pay off my debt, I'm going to throw this into Mount Doom and get rid of it.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Yeah, so it always reminds me.

07:38.000 --> 07:45.000
So, actually, that kind of brings me to another discussion point, which is, like, I've talked on this channel about film school before.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Yeah.

07:46.000 --> 07:53.000
That was with a colleague who went to a more vocational school, whereas I had gone to USC, and I hadn't at the time.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
At the time, I was a dropout.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Now I'm a graduate almost.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Yeah.

07:56.000 --> 08:02.000
But I guess now the question of film school, would you say it was worth it?

08:02.000 --> 08:10.000
Yeah, it's, you know, I think about that a lot every time my credit card gets hit with more debt payments.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
Every time your credit score gets down because your debt is so ballooning.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Ballooning, it's like a tick.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
Yeah, you can't tear down the principal, you're just paying off interest.

08:20.000 --> 08:27.000
You don't really know what you didn't know, so you don't really know how much you learned or were absorbed.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
And it's also about the relationships.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Like, we wouldn't have met.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
I wouldn't have met any, like, the people that worked on this movie.

08:33.000 --> 08:40.000
Like, anybody who worked on this movie that I even met, you know, three people removed from USC, I wouldn't know.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
So this crew would be completely different.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
The cast would be completely different.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
This crew is like, it's a racket.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Yeah, that's right.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
I went there.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
I sent my kids.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
I really shouldn't have filmed in an aviator.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
That was a bad call.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
But the beauty of nature.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
That's right.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Those aren't planes, they're just pterodactyls.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
Yeah, no, this is like, your movie was shot outside mostly.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
This is outside.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
I like nature.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
It's like, it's so controllable.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Oh my gosh.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
Yeah, we were in a color session the other day, and it was just, the colorist was going...

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
It was just speckled trees, lighting was all over the place.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
This is like an aviary airport.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Oh my gosh, I know.

09:29.000 --> 09:39.000
It's not really either or indie or studio, but I guess one of the questions is why you decided to go almost full indie

09:39.000 --> 09:46.000
instead of either going with a financier or clawing your way up through the studio system,

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
as some of our other classmates are doing.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
I think a lot of it is control.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Like we have control right now.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Yeah, exactly.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
This is a metaphor.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
This is all post.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Intentional AF.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
Yeah, we added the birds and the hammers after we shot.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
This was actually really funny.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
We're actually like in the middle of nowhere, it's really creepy.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
This is green screen, we're improv-ing off nothing, and then we just, yeah, the sirens.

10:17.000 --> 10:23.000
But yeah, I think a lot of it's control in a number of ways, but mostly because ironically, as you know,

10:23.000 --> 10:29.000
in this industry, people don't have a lot of imagination, so you could give them a script,

10:29.000 --> 10:35.000
and you could say like, here's what I want to do, here's exactly this, this, here's the cast, here's everything.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Just throw me 200 grand, which means nothing to a lot of people.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
And they would just say no or not get it.

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
So I think a lot of it is just let's make it, then no imagination, here's the movie.

10:48.000 --> 10:54.000
I mean, it definitely is a starting point, and it's a gamble in a lot of ways, but at the same time,

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
I don't really know of any other way to do it than using the siren.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
Oh wait, I just had a heart attack, that's why they're coming, I'm dead.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Forgot to tell you.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
Yeah, it's the studio system coming for us.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
If you want it done right, do it yourself, do it with as much control as you can,

11:13.000 --> 11:20.000
and then hope for the best, hope it turns out, but that's like anything, you don't have control ultimately.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
But at least you have a movie to show for it instead of a script.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
Because I know a lot of times, and I was frustrated with this and a lot of people are,

11:28.000 --> 11:35.000
is you can have a great script that you believe in, but it's even hard to get your friends to read it and get notes.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
It feels like homework.

11:36.000 --> 11:42.000
Yeah, because we were talking about this the other day, nobody cares until everybody cares.

11:42.000 --> 11:50.000
And this is something, people please stop asking me to read your scripts and your novels.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
It's not cool.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
Whenever I say it's skilled labor, it is.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
Especially for us, we both have master's degrees.

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
Asking for feedback, it's time consuming, and it's kind of a job.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
There's a reason people get paid for that.

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
Yeah, it's tough and it's also, you know, a lot of people want to say,

12:15.000 --> 12:21.000
I'm going to work with Spielberg one day, but it is all about your peers and coming up together with your peers.

12:21.000 --> 12:26.000
So, you know, have your friends and people whose opinions you trust.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
I mean, yeah, it's great to have somebody with a lot of know-how read something,

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
but they also don't get your voice as much.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
They might not be able to be as prescriptive or as helpful as maybe somebody who knows you better.

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
But at the end of the day, you're really just fighting a losing battle, trying to get your thing read.

12:44.000 --> 12:50.000
I think it depends on your goal, but I think also it is really hard to get people,

12:50.000 --> 12:56.000
again, if they don't know you, unless they're an agent and they're actively looking,

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
then yeah, it is totally fighting a losing battle.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
Especially in Hollywood, where like you said, people are interested in ideas,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
they're not really interested in quality.

13:04.000 --> 13:10.000
Yeah, I mean, I even had a lot of situations when we crewed up for Bullet County where, you know,

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
I was going to have a meeting with, say, a costume designer or something,

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
send them the script, have a meeting with them, and they hadn't even read it.

13:18.000 --> 13:24.000
So, you know, at the point that people who you could employ,

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
especially in a lot of cases it was going to be their first feature as that department head,

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
and they're not even reading it, you know.

13:32.000 --> 13:37.000
Like, it's tough to get people to read your work, for sure.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
Yeah, and it's like, it's not necessarily a reflection on your work,

13:41.000 --> 13:46.000
but I think you need to understand that it's like, while it kind of sucks,

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
because, you know, it's like you, by the very nature of the creative act,

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
you have to care way more than is rational.

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
It's so hard working, like, just working for so long on a thing,

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
and it's kind of one thing that if you're going to go anywhere,

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
you have to accept that nobody cares.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
Even, like, your mother, like, nobody cares.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Nobody cares.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Until everybody cares.

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
Right, and they'll care for selfish reasons, for fame or, you know,

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
for their own betterment or money or something.

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
But, like, yeah, I mean, even, you know, you find out even running, you know,

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
like a Kickstarter or something, you're essentially trying to get your cast

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
and crew to care about getting the movie funded and finished.

14:31.000 --> 14:37.000
And even then, like, the percentage of people that care is a huge drop-off,

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
and they're all people who worked on the movie and gave, you know,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
many months of their lives to it.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
So even then, yeah, it's just important to remember that you've been in this bubble,

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
this creative bubble, and nobody else has that perspective.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Yeah, exactly.

14:50.000 --> 14:56.000
I think that there's maybe a little, it's kind of not really helping anyone,

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
this sort of, you know, people are going to care because you're special,

15:00.000 --> 15:07.000
when, you know, the reality is people are, you know, like you said, it's selfish.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
And there's nothing really wrong with that because, you know,

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
we all got places to be and people to do, but.

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
Yeah, it's kind of this weird balance of having perspective on what we're talking about,

15:18.000 --> 15:23.000
of nobody's going to care as much about your work as you are,

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
but your job is to make them care as much as possible,

15:26.000 --> 15:33.000
like enough to read your work or watch your movie or work on your movie in some degree.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
And it is hard, and you're not always going to pull it off, but at least,

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
I mean, that's how you get a movie made.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
You get people to care enough either for money purposes or to further their career

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
or because they really passionately believe in it.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
And, you know, in the indie world, it's not for money,

15:49.000 --> 15:55.000
so you're really fighting an uphill battle to get people who care about whatever you've, you know, written.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
So with all that in mind, how do you stay motivated?

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
Um, alcohol.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
I mean, besides that.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Besides the obvious.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Liquid courage.

16:08.000 --> 16:13.000
I have to think that I have something to say,

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
something to say in a different way than I've seen before.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
It's not like reinventing the wheel or anything,

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
but, you know, you hear a lot of movie pitches like, you know,

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
like I was saying, The Shining meets No Country for Old Men or whatever it is.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
Like, I haven't quite seen that movie, so that's new somewhat.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
And I think a lot of it is just, um, believe it.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
It sounds hippy-dippy, but believe in yourself.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Like, you really do have to believe in yourself

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
because there will come points where nobody else will,

16:44.000 --> 16:50.000
and you either use that to keep going or it'll kill you, you know,

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
or you'll stop doing it.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
And, you know, yeah, sometimes it takes realistic expectations

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
and you think maybe this isn't for me.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
But I think a lot of it is I've found,

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
and I think we've talked about this before,

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
you kind of get shark-brained a lot and you just don't even think about it.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
It's like at the point that you just can do nothing else

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
and you have to do that,

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
then there's really no second guessing because you're just doing it.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
You're almost the robot.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
No, I think that's necessary.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
To me it's necessary.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
Like, you have to shark-brain sometimes.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
And I think a lot of people get hung up on the what will people think.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Yeah, yeah, don't.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
And that is, you know, it's like fear is the mind killer.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
It's that, you know, don't get hung up on that.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Even if it's just like, is this problematic?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Are people going to hate me?

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
You know, I mean, don't be a racist, but.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
Well, because you're always going to have to defend yourself.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
You're always going to have to, you know,

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
people are going to say take that scene out or it's not worth shooting

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
or take it out of the movie

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
or the score should be this way and not that way.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
And, you know, yeah, they might present a good case

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
and you might say, yeah, you know, because you want to field ideas.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
But if it's something you really want in there,

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
for whatever reason, stick to your guns, you know, if you can.

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
Has that been a process to actually figure out how

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
or were you always kind of there?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
No, it's always a process

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
because I think a lot of it is you do want to remain open minded enough

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
to take good ideas.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
But you also don't want to lose sight of what it is that you're doing

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
or what you're trying to say.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
For this one, you know, for me being so involved in it,

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
like I wrote, directed it.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
My producing partner and I kind of co-produced it

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
in terms of, you know, pre-production and that kind of thing

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
and pulling a lot of our resources.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
So we were...

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
You made that joke about the aviary.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Now I can't stop.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Now I can't, yeah.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
I can't unhear it. Sorry.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
I just want that dish to be a laser and to shoot.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Just a plane killer, yeah.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Plane killer.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
You'll show you to wreck my student film.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
This is for YouTube. This is an amateur hour.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
I think we're like the kind of defending yourself

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
versus fielding ideas from other people

19:17.000 --> 19:22.000
really came to fruition in the editorial process.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
So when you get to editorial,

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
you've spent money on certain things.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
You've, you know, acted your heart out.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
You've written scenes that you really like.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
So there were several scenes in it that I wrote.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
There was a scene I really liked

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
and it was a monologue that my character had

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
and I actually think I acted pretty well in it.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
But we cut it out, you know,

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
because you're like it just doesn't further the movie.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
It's slowing it down for pace reasons.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
There was another scene that was

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
one of the most expensive scenes we shot

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
and we cut it out, you know.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
And it's all in service of that movie,

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
at the end of the day.

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
So for all those aspiring indie filmmakers out there,

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
what advice do you have,

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
now that you're almost on the other side

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
of having a finished product?

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I mean, the advice is simple.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
If you believe in it enough,

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
just really don't stop and do it.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Don't do it.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Don't do it.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I don't need the competition for one.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
She's just like,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
I don't want to see your white supremacist manifesto,

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
to be honest.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
I've seen enough curb stomping.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Jesus Christ.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Never give up on your dreams.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
It's true though.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Because I think the other thing is like,

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
I think people really have a hard time

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
with this idea that

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
the first thing out of the gate

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
is going to be your breakout

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
rather than just be,

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
like you said,

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
you've already shot a feature before.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
You did 546.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
You were at USC for several years.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
This isn't your first rodeo.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Plus, you actually worked in the industry.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Yeah, it's a lot of it.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
I mean, you hate to be so nebulous,

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
but it is all a learning process.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
And I know that, you know,

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
we've all learned lessons

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
and made the next movie better.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
It may not be a better film overall,

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
but there may have been things

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
that you've done better overall.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
And it's all a continuum.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
And so, like you said,

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
yeah, your first thing

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
is not going to be the best,

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
most likely,

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
unless you're, you know, some savant.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
There's a part of me that wishes

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
I could find my

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Phantom of the Opera fan fiction

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
from 2001.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Well, at least I can have that right now.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
I'm doing a live reading.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Yeah, like we were saying,

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
you have to believe in yourself.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
You have to work really hard,

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
but you also have to

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
not think about it too much.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Yeah.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
And just go on autopilot

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
and really work hard.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
And that is a skill.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
It is hard work.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
And I think it's just like,

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
it's one of those skills that,

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
you know, it's not like you,

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
it's not like nirvana,

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
like you reach it,

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
like, I'm here.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
It's like, you,

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
it's always kind of a process

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
to just stay, like, sane

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
through the process of creating

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
and, you know,

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
care way too much

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
and accept that nobody cares

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
until everybody cares.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Yeah.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
Like, do you know anybody

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
who's been successful

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
in this industry

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
that hasn't worked their ass off?

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
I don't know of any.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
I mean, unless it's...

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Yeah, I can think of a few people

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
who, like, maybe you were,

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
are legacies.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Yeah, legacy people.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Let's put it that way.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Legacy people maybe didn't work as,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
I mean, they think they did, but...

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Sure.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Yeah, yeah.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
But, I mean, in general,

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
like, a lot of the people

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
I've worked with or know

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
or respect,

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
I mean, they just worked really hard.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Yeah, like Ryan.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
He was always, like, kind of...

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Yeah, he worked really hard.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Like, I remember, like,

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
looking at him and being like,

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
no, I never could do, like,

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
you know, just the motivation.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Like, I mean,

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
I look at his success

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
and I'm just not really

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
terribly surprised

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
just because of, like,

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
yeah, he was just really,

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
really high energy.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Yeah.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
And I don't feel like

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I ever saw him be like...

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Really?

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
I mean, because what is it

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
that there's that kind of adage

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
that you make it in this industry

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
because you just outlast

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
everybody else, you know?

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
And you and I both know

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
a ton of people

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
who we went to USC with

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
who aren't in the industry anymore.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
They moved back

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
or they just fell out of love with it

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
for whatever reason.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Yeah, because I...

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Honestly, like,

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
because I did work in post

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
for a while like you did

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
and part of the reason

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
why I decided

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
I was going to leave

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
the industry side of things

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
and do writing

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
and YouTube full time

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
was just because

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
I didn't have the passion for it,

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
especially post production,

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
and I was like,

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
I can't half-ass two things.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Yeah, and it's not

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
a sign of failure either.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
I mean, I've tried

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
so many things

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
that I've had a passion for

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
and just, eh,

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
it's not for me, you know,

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
and there's no harm in it.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Bullitt County will be out

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
whenever the,

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
I guess the end

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
of the festival process.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
Yeah.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
That could be

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
another conversation.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Oh my, yeah, yeah.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
It's just kind of

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
seeing where it goes,

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
but so far,

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
everybody who's seen it

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
likes it and it's all

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
they can hope for.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Well, congratulations

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
on finishing.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Thank you.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
That in and of itself

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
is like,

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
y'all ain't even know.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
It's a bit, you know,

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
it's, you know, high five.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Thank you.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
Anything buried out there

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
is meant to stay buried.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
David, you're at

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Mr. Pictures Film

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
on Twitter, Instagram,

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
and Facebook?

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Yes.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
With your co-producer

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
and also...

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
We're getting a YouTube

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
thing going,

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
but it's, yeah, slow.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
We've been too busy

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
on this movie.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
I know, I know.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
We're also on YouPorn.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Just look for us.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Mr. Dishes.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Not Pornhub.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
No, not Pornhub.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
Because their search interface

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
is so much better.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Yeah, really.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Yeah.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Come to think of it,

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
we should get on Pornhub.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Yeah.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
What are you doing?

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
They have better comments.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
Also, the link to his

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Kickstarter is below.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
It's like,

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
depending on when you see this,

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
it should be still going

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
for another couple days

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
if you want to support

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
indie film.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Yeah, so if you want

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
to see some scenes

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
from the movie

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
that are almost completed,

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
go to the update section

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
in Kickstarter

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
and there's some

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
scenes in there.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
All right, great.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Well, David,

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
hopefully we'll be having

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
a different conversation

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
five or ten years from now

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
that we'll look back on this

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
and laugh at the time

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
we chatted in the aviary.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
I'll still be doing

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Michael Bay impressions.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Yeah, we need to get

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
your dollar sign hat back.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
Well, thank you for coming.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Thank you.
