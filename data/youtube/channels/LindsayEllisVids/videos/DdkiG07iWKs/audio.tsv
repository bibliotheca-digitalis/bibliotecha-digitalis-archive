0	8000	Hello and welcome. This is my old friend from film school days, Mark I, David McCracken.
8000	9000	Hello.
9000	14000	Savviest of viewers might remember him as Michael Bay.
14000	17000	Yeah, my hair's no wig this time.
17000	23000	Yeah, with the dollar, yeah, whenever in the nostalgic days of earliest and least effort.
23000	29000	Sweet, young, lovely, beautiful, Michael Bay.
29000	33000	But I still have the Michael Bay thing that I hold to this day.
33000	37000	You were actually one of the first Michael Bay apologists I think I ever met.
37000	42000	Yeah, I think so, yeah, because coming to film school it was, you know, everybody likes their auteurs
42000	45000	and you and I both said we like helicopters at sunset.
45000	46000	Yeah, helicopters at sunset.
46000	47000	So we bonded, yeah.
48000	52000	I asked David to come on so we could talk about screenwriting and micro-budget filmmaking
52000	62000	because he is in the very last processes of finishing his solo directorial feature film, Bullet County.
62000	63000	Yeah.
63000	65000	It's not something we can erase.
68000	70000	I saw a lion there.
71000	74000	In all the wet ferns and moss.
77000	80000	Is blood black in the moonlight.
80000	83000	Can you give us the, as we were taught...
83000	84000	Elevator pitch.
84000	85000	Elevator pitch.
85000	87000	The power drill pitch.
87000	89000	The pitch that you have to go in between drills.
89000	90000	Yeah.
90000	99000	Yeah, it's basically, it's an action thriller that is about four friends on the Kentucky bourbon trail in the 70s.
99000	100000	They're trying to relive the good old days.
100000	102000	They did the trail ten years ago in college.
102000	104000	And so one of them's getting married.
104000	108000	So his best man says, hey, why don't we do it again and actually finish it?
108000	110000	Because we didn't finish it last time.
110000	117000	But there's, along the way they discover that there's buried Prohibition money out in Kentucky somewhere.
117000	118000	So they go looking for that.
118000	126000	And as is wont to do with characters finding money, you know, they start getting greedy and tearing each other apart and that kind of thing.
126000	133000	But it's very, I mean, the term gets thrown around a lot, but it is very Coen Brothers-y in terms of it's funny.
133000	135000	It's black humor.
135000	137000	You know, you get some moments of violence.
137000	143000	And so we've kind of pitched it as the Shining meets No Country for Old Men.
143000	145000	Right now they're running a Kickstarter.
145000	147000	Can you give us the sales pitch?
147000	148000	Yeah.
148000	150000	So the Kickstarter is for finishing funds.
150000	153000	So like you said, we're pretty much done.
153000	159000	But the Kickstarter is to get us final color correction, you know, final VFX and that kind of thing.
159000	166000	So like we're having a poster done by Akiko who did It Follows and Blue Ruin and that kind of thing.
166000	175000	So it's basically to help us complete the film, which we actually have just successfully funded.
175000	184000	But now we're trying to get to, I think, $50,000 so that all backers who contribute $25,000 or more will get a Blu-ray of it.
184000	189000	Yeah, so it's, you know, like anything, as you're making a movie you budget out for certain things.
189000	191000	And then you realize some things are more costly.
191000	195000	So hence finishing funds and Kickstarters and that kind of thing.
195000	199000	What was your budget originally for the actual shooting?
199000	201000	For production only?
201000	203000	That one I don't know.
203000	208000	I think we were trying to aim for the whole movie to be about $200,000.
208000	215000	So the idea was pull as many favors as we could initially and for production.
215000	221000	And we always knew that Kickstarter was a big possibility as for a lot of indie films it is.
221000	229000	But this one we thought we would try to, if we were going to do a Kickstarter, to do it at the end so that we actually had something to show for it.
229000	234000	Instead of, you know, a lot of Kickstarters are the potential for a movie.
234000	242000	You know, help me get it off the ground and the movie most likely won't get finished or even started because it ends up costing more all the complications.
242000	247000	So we thought if we got through production, got through editing, got it far enough along to where it had to be completed,
247000	251000	then the Kickstarter made more sense to incentivize people.
251000	253000	Well, I guess that's sort of the thing though.
253000	258000	I feel like movies are more sure if they're indie.
259000	267000	Because you hear all these horror stories of studio movies that even get greenlit and maybe even start production and then you're like, no, you can't.
267000	273000	Yeah, I think a lot of it must be passion or some kind of drive on the part of the filmmakers.
273000	281000	If they really want to get it done, they'll pull out all the stops and they'll work on it for as long as they possibly can to get it finished.
281000	282000	Well, you have to.
282000	287000	I mean, it's so thankless and it's so competitive.
287000	297000	I think maybe that's true in all arts, but not to demoralize, but it's just like it's so crowded and it's so hard to even be noticed.
297000	303000	Yeah, that's why I think a lot of it has to do with, honestly, talent.
304000	322000	I mean, there's business savvy and there's that kind of thing, but it really is hoping that you can put together a strong enough team that all cares about the project enough to bring it to fruition and, you know, take a hit on their paycheck or be willing to live in a house.
322000	328000	And in this case, in Indiana and Kentucky, which is where we shot it because it takes place in the Bourbon Trail.
328000	335000	But, you know, to kind of rely on people's passion for the material, you know, or passion for power drills.
335000	338000	I think that's a really underrated subject.
338000	339000	Yes.
339000	340000	How did you find your crew?
340000	348000	You know, people that actually give enough of a shit to go through the hell of low budget filmmaking.
348000	353000	Well, there was a long brainwashing process when I put them in a dentist chair.
353000	355000	The drills reminded me of that.
355000	357000	Did you have like the eye drops?
357000	358000	Eye drops.
358000	359000	Yeah.
359000	363000	But, yeah, it was actually a combination of things.
363000	366000	One of them was USC initially.
366000	369000	I did what was called a 546.
369000	371000	You did a 547.
371000	372000	I did a 547.
372000	373000	Yours was the nonfiction.
373000	374000	Mine was the fiction.
374000	375000	Yeah.
375000	376000	I did a documentary.
376000	377000	Yeah.
377000	378000	Yeah.
378000	383000	So on that one, I had a really good crew on that, a really good cast.
384000	395000	And so after working on that, I took the lead actor from that, wrote a feature for him, and the DP from that.
395000	404000	And then through other channels at USC, from professors and that kind of thing, just really, while I was, you know, fully employed elsewhere,
404000	412000	we were putting together this movie, and I was just taking meetings and meeting people through other, you know, USC channels, friends of friends, friends.
412000	421000	So, I mean, a lot of it was trying to find that nice Venn diagram of passion, but not too crazy, but crazy enough to want to leave L.A. for a month.
421000	423000	I just noticed you have a USC ring.
423000	424000	I do.
424000	427000	You know, I got this because, you know, did you get a class ring?
427000	428000	No.
428000	429000	I didn't either because they're like $700.
429000	430000	Yeah.
430000	433000	I was like, I know it's University of Spoiled Children, but come on.
433000	434000	Yeah.
434000	441000	So my day of graduation, the day of walking, we went to the bookstore, and, you know, there's all the class rings and stuff.
441000	450000	And I saw this for like $40 or $50, and I thought, I'll get this, and it'll basically be my wedding ring to my debt.
450000	456000	So when I pay off my debt, I'm going to throw this into Mount Doom and get rid of it.
456000	458000	Yeah, so it always reminds me.
458000	465000	So, actually, that kind of brings me to another discussion point, which is, like, I've talked on this channel about film school before.
465000	466000	Yeah.
466000	473000	That was with a colleague who went to a more vocational school, whereas I had gone to USC, and I hadn't at the time.
473000	474000	At the time, I was a dropout.
474000	475000	Now I'm a graduate almost.
475000	476000	Yeah.
476000	482000	But I guess now the question of film school, would you say it was worth it?
482000	490000	Yeah, it's, you know, I think about that a lot every time my credit card gets hit with more debt payments.
490000	495000	Every time your credit score gets down because your debt is so ballooning.
495000	496000	Ballooning, it's like a tick.
496000	500000	Yeah, you can't tear down the principal, you're just paying off interest.
500000	507000	You don't really know what you didn't know, so you don't really know how much you learned or were absorbed.
507000	509000	And it's also about the relationships.
509000	510000	Like, we wouldn't have met.
510000	513000	I wouldn't have met any, like, the people that worked on this movie.
513000	520000	Like, anybody who worked on this movie that I even met, you know, three people removed from USC, I wouldn't know.
520000	522000	So this crew would be completely different.
522000	524000	The cast would be completely different.
524000	527000	This crew is like, it's a racket.
527000	529000	Yeah, that's right.
529000	530000	I went there.
530000	531000	I sent my kids.
531000	533000	I really shouldn't have filmed in an aviator.
533000	536000	That was a bad call.
536000	538000	But the beauty of nature.
538000	539000	That's right.
539000	540000	Those aren't planes, they're just pterodactyls.
540000	544000	Yeah, no, this is like, your movie was shot outside mostly.
544000	545000	This is outside.
545000	546000	I like nature.
546000	548000	It's like, it's so controllable.
548000	549000	Oh my gosh.
549000	554000	Yeah, we were in a color session the other day, and it was just, the colorist was going...
555000	559000	It was just speckled trees, lighting was all over the place.
565000	567000	This is like an aviary airport.
567000	568000	Oh my gosh, I know.
569000	579000	It's not really either or indie or studio, but I guess one of the questions is why you decided to go almost full indie
579000	586000	instead of either going with a financier or clawing your way up through the studio system,
586000	589000	as some of our other classmates are doing.
589000	594000	I think a lot of it is control.
595000	597000	Like we have control right now.
598000	599000	Yeah, exactly.
599000	600000	This is a metaphor.
600000	601000	This is all post.
601000	602000	Intentional AF.
603000	606000	Yeah, we added the birds and the hammers after we shot.
606000	607000	This was actually really funny.
609000	611000	We're actually like in the middle of nowhere, it's really creepy.
611000	615000	This is green screen, we're improv-ing off nothing, and then we just, yeah, the sirens.
617000	623000	But yeah, I think a lot of it's control in a number of ways, but mostly because ironically, as you know,
623000	629000	in this industry, people don't have a lot of imagination, so you could give them a script,
629000	635000	and you could say like, here's what I want to do, here's exactly this, this, here's the cast, here's everything.
635000	638000	Just throw me 200 grand, which means nothing to a lot of people.
640000	642000	And they would just say no or not get it.
642000	647000	So I think a lot of it is just let's make it, then no imagination, here's the movie.
648000	654000	I mean, it definitely is a starting point, and it's a gamble in a lot of ways, but at the same time,
654000	659000	I don't really know of any other way to do it than using the siren.
661000	664000	Oh wait, I just had a heart attack, that's why they're coming, I'm dead.
665000	666000	Forgot to tell you.
666000	669000	Yeah, it's the studio system coming for us.
669000	673000	If you want it done right, do it yourself, do it with as much control as you can,
673000	680000	and then hope for the best, hope it turns out, but that's like anything, you don't have control ultimately.
680000	684000	But at least you have a movie to show for it instead of a script.
684000	688000	Because I know a lot of times, and I was frustrated with this and a lot of people are,
688000	695000	is you can have a great script that you believe in, but it's even hard to get your friends to read it and get notes.
695000	696000	It feels like homework.
696000	702000	Yeah, because we were talking about this the other day, nobody cares until everybody cares.
702000	710000	And this is something, people please stop asking me to read your scripts and your novels.
710000	712000	It's not cool.
714000	717000	Whenever I say it's skilled labor, it is.
717000	720000	Especially for us, we both have master's degrees.
723000	728000	Asking for feedback, it's time consuming, and it's kind of a job.
728000	730000	There's a reason people get paid for that.
730000	735000	Yeah, it's tough and it's also, you know, a lot of people want to say,
735000	741000	I'm going to work with Spielberg one day, but it is all about your peers and coming up together with your peers.
741000	746000	So, you know, have your friends and people whose opinions you trust.
746000	750000	I mean, yeah, it's great to have somebody with a lot of know-how read something,
750000	752000	but they also don't get your voice as much.
752000	757000	They might not be able to be as prescriptive or as helpful as maybe somebody who knows you better.
758000	764000	But at the end of the day, you're really just fighting a losing battle, trying to get your thing read.
764000	770000	I think it depends on your goal, but I think also it is really hard to get people,
770000	776000	again, if they don't know you, unless they're an agent and they're actively looking,
776000	778000	then yeah, it is totally fighting a losing battle.
778000	782000	Especially in Hollywood, where like you said, people are interested in ideas,
782000	784000	they're not really interested in quality.
784000	790000	Yeah, I mean, I even had a lot of situations when we crewed up for Bullet County where, you know,
790000	794000	I was going to have a meeting with, say, a costume designer or something,
794000	798000	send them the script, have a meeting with them, and they hadn't even read it.
798000	804000	So, you know, at the point that people who you could employ,
804000	809000	especially in a lot of cases it was going to be their first feature as that department head,
810000	812000	and they're not even reading it, you know.
812000	817000	Like, it's tough to get people to read your work, for sure.
817000	821000	Yeah, and it's like, it's not necessarily a reflection on your work,
821000	826000	but I think you need to understand that it's like, while it kind of sucks,
826000	830000	because, you know, it's like you, by the very nature of the creative act,
830000	834000	you have to care way more than is rational.
834000	839000	It's so hard working, like, just working for so long on a thing,
839000	843000	and it's kind of one thing that if you're going to go anywhere,
843000	846000	you have to accept that nobody cares.
846000	849000	Even, like, your mother, like, nobody cares.
849000	850000	Nobody cares.
850000	851000	Until everybody cares.
851000	856000	Right, and they'll care for selfish reasons, for fame or, you know,
856000	858000	for their own betterment or money or something.
858000	863000	But, like, yeah, I mean, even, you know, you find out even running, you know,
863000	867000	like a Kickstarter or something, you're essentially trying to get your cast
867000	871000	and crew to care about getting the movie funded and finished.
871000	877000	And even then, like, the percentage of people that care is a huge drop-off,
877000	880000	and they're all people who worked on the movie and gave, you know,
880000	882000	many months of their lives to it.
882000	886000	So even then, yeah, it's just important to remember that you've been in this bubble,
886000	889000	this creative bubble, and nobody else has that perspective.
889000	890000	Yeah, exactly.
890000	896000	I think that there's maybe a little, it's kind of not really helping anyone,
896000	900000	this sort of, you know, people are going to care because you're special,
900000	907000	when, you know, the reality is people are, you know, like you said, it's selfish.
907000	909000	And there's nothing really wrong with that because, you know,
909000	913000	we all got places to be and people to do, but.
913000	918000	Yeah, it's kind of this weird balance of having perspective on what we're talking about,
918000	923000	of nobody's going to care as much about your work as you are,
923000	926000	but your job is to make them care as much as possible,
926000	933000	like enough to read your work or watch your movie or work on your movie in some degree.
933000	937000	And it is hard, and you're not always going to pull it off, but at least,
937000	939000	I mean, that's how you get a movie made.
939000	944000	You get people to care enough either for money purposes or to further their career
944000	946000	or because they really passionately believe in it.
946000	949000	And, you know, in the indie world, it's not for money,
949000	955000	so you're really fighting an uphill battle to get people who care about whatever you've, you know, written.
955000	959000	So with all that in mind, how do you stay motivated?
959000	962000	Um, alcohol.
962000	966000	I mean, besides that.
966000	967000	Besides the obvious.
967000	968000	Liquid courage.
968000	973000	I have to think that I have something to say,
973000	977000	something to say in a different way than I've seen before.
977000	980000	It's not like reinventing the wheel or anything,
980000	984000	but, you know, you hear a lot of movie pitches like, you know,
984000	987000	like I was saying, The Shining meets No Country for Old Men or whatever it is.
987000	991000	Like, I haven't quite seen that movie, so that's new somewhat.
991000	995000	And I think a lot of it is just, um, believe it.
995000	998000	It sounds hippy-dippy, but believe in yourself.
998000	1000000	Like, you really do have to believe in yourself
1000000	1004000	because there will come points where nobody else will,
1004000	1010000	and you either use that to keep going or it'll kill you, you know,
1010000	1011000	or you'll stop doing it.
1011000	1015000	And, you know, yeah, sometimes it takes realistic expectations
1015000	1017000	and you think maybe this isn't for me.
1017000	1020000	But I think a lot of it is I've found,
1020000	1022000	and I think we've talked about this before,
1022000	1026000	you kind of get shark-brained a lot and you just don't even think about it.
1026000	1029000	It's like at the point that you just can do nothing else
1029000	1031000	and you have to do that,
1031000	1035000	then there's really no second guessing because you're just doing it.
1035000	1036000	You're almost the robot.
1036000	1039000	No, I think that's necessary.
1039000	1040000	To me it's necessary.
1040000	1044000	Like, you have to shark-brain sometimes.
1044000	1049000	And I think a lot of people get hung up on the what will people think.
1049000	1050000	Yeah, yeah, don't.
1050000	1053000	And that is, you know, it's like fear is the mind killer.
1053000	1056000	It's that, you know, don't get hung up on that.
1056000	1058000	Even if it's just like, is this problematic?
1058000	1060000	Are people going to hate me?
1060000	1063000	You know, I mean, don't be a racist, but.
1063000	1066000	Well, because you're always going to have to defend yourself.
1066000	1068000	You're always going to have to, you know,
1068000	1071000	people are going to say take that scene out or it's not worth shooting
1071000	1073000	or take it out of the movie
1073000	1076000	or the score should be this way and not that way.
1076000	1078000	And, you know, yeah, they might present a good case
1078000	1081000	and you might say, yeah, you know, because you want to field ideas.
1081000	1084000	But if it's something you really want in there,
1084000	1088000	for whatever reason, stick to your guns, you know, if you can.
1088000	1093000	Has that been a process to actually figure out how
1093000	1096000	or were you always kind of there?
1096000	1098000	No, it's always a process
1098000	1102000	because I think a lot of it is you do want to remain open minded enough
1102000	1105000	to take good ideas.
1105000	1109000	But you also don't want to lose sight of what it is that you're doing
1109000	1111000	or what you're trying to say.
1111000	1114000	For this one, you know, for me being so involved in it,
1114000	1117000	like I wrote, directed it.
1117000	1121000	My producing partner and I kind of co-produced it
1121000	1124000	in terms of, you know, pre-production and that kind of thing
1124000	1127000	and pulling a lot of our resources.
1127000	1129000	So we were...
1129000	1131000	You made that joke about the aviary.
1131000	1132000	Now I can't stop.
1132000	1133000	Now I can't, yeah.
1133000	1135000	I can't unhear it. Sorry.
1135000	1138000	I just want that dish to be a laser and to shoot.
1142000	1144000	Just a plane killer, yeah.
1144000	1145000	Plane killer.
1145000	1147000	You'll show you to wreck my student film.
1147000	1150000	This is for YouTube. This is an amateur hour.
1150000	1154000	I think we're like the kind of defending yourself
1154000	1157000	versus fielding ideas from other people
1157000	1162000	really came to fruition in the editorial process.
1162000	1164000	So when you get to editorial,
1164000	1166000	you've spent money on certain things.
1166000	1168000	You've, you know, acted your heart out.
1168000	1170000	You've written scenes that you really like.
1170000	1173000	So there were several scenes in it that I wrote.
1173000	1175000	There was a scene I really liked
1175000	1177000	and it was a monologue that my character had
1177000	1179000	and I actually think I acted pretty well in it.
1179000	1181000	But we cut it out, you know,
1181000	1183000	because you're like it just doesn't further the movie.
1183000	1185000	It's slowing it down for pace reasons.
1185000	1187000	There was another scene that was
1187000	1190000	one of the most expensive scenes we shot
1190000	1192000	and we cut it out, you know.
1192000	1194000	And it's all in service of that movie,
1194000	1195000	at the end of the day.
1195000	1199000	So for all those aspiring indie filmmakers out there,
1199000	1200000	what advice do you have,
1200000	1203000	now that you're almost on the other side
1203000	1205000	of having a finished product?
1205000	1207000	I mean, the advice is simple.
1207000	1210000	If you believe in it enough,
1210000	1214000	just really don't stop and do it.
1218000	1219000	Don't do it.
1219000	1220000	Don't do it.
1220000	1222000	I don't need the competition for one.
1225000	1226000	She's just like,
1226000	1228000	I don't want to see your white supremacist manifesto,
1228000	1229000	to be honest.
1229000	1231000	I've seen enough curb stomping.
1231000	1232000	Jesus Christ.
1232000	1234000	Never give up on your dreams.
1236000	1237000	It's true though.
1237000	1239000	Because I think the other thing is like,
1239000	1241000	I think people really have a hard time
1241000	1242000	with this idea that
1242000	1244000	the first thing out of the gate
1244000	1247000	is going to be your breakout
1247000	1249000	rather than just be,
1249000	1250000	like you said,
1250000	1251000	you've already shot a feature before.
1251000	1252000	You did 546.
1252000	1253000	You were at USC for several years.
1253000	1255000	This isn't your first rodeo.
1255000	1257000	Plus, you actually worked in the industry.
1257000	1259000	Yeah, it's a lot of it.
1259000	1261000	I mean, you hate to be so nebulous,
1261000	1263000	but it is all a learning process.
1263000	1265000	And I know that, you know,
1265000	1267000	we've all learned lessons
1267000	1269000	and made the next movie better.
1269000	1272000	It may not be a better film overall,
1272000	1273000	but there may have been things
1273000	1275000	that you've done better overall.
1275000	1276000	And it's all a continuum.
1276000	1277000	And so, like you said,
1277000	1280000	yeah, your first thing
1280000	1282000	is not going to be the best,
1282000	1283000	most likely,
1283000	1285000	unless you're, you know, some savant.
1285000	1287000	There's a part of me that wishes
1287000	1288000	I could find my
1288000	1290000	Phantom of the Opera fan fiction
1290000	1292000	from 2001.
1292000	1294000	Well, at least I can have that right now.
1295000	1296000	I'm doing a live reading.
1296000	1297000	Yeah, like we were saying,
1297000	1299000	you have to believe in yourself.
1299000	1300000	You have to work really hard,
1300000	1301000	but you also have to
1301000	1302000	not think about it too much.
1302000	1303000	Yeah.
1303000	1304000	And just go on autopilot
1304000	1305000	and really work hard.
1305000	1306000	And that is a skill.
1306000	1307000	It is hard work.
1307000	1308000	And I think it's just like,
1308000	1309000	it's one of those skills that,
1309000	1310000	you know, it's not like you,
1310000	1311000	it's not like nirvana,
1311000	1312000	like you reach it,
1312000	1313000	like, I'm here.
1313000	1314000	It's like, you,
1314000	1316000	it's always kind of a process
1316000	1318000	to just stay, like, sane
1318000	1320000	through the process of creating
1320000	1321000	and, you know,
1321000	1322000	care way too much
1322000	1323000	and accept that nobody cares
1323000	1324000	until everybody cares.
1324000	1325000	Yeah.
1325000	1326000	Like, do you know anybody
1326000	1327000	who's been successful
1327000	1328000	in this industry
1328000	1330000	that hasn't worked their ass off?
1331000	1333000	I don't know of any.
1333000	1335000	I mean, unless it's...
1336000	1337000	Yeah, I can think of a few people
1337000	1338000	who, like, maybe you were,
1338000	1339000	are legacies.
1339000	1340000	Yeah, legacy people.
1340000	1341000	Let's put it that way.
1341000	1342000	Legacy people maybe didn't work as,
1342000	1344000	I mean, they think they did, but...
1344000	1345000	Sure.
1345000	1346000	Yeah, yeah.
1346000	1347000	But, I mean, in general,
1347000	1348000	like, a lot of the people
1348000	1349000	I've worked with or know
1349000	1350000	or respect,
1350000	1352000	I mean, they just worked really hard.
1352000	1353000	Yeah, like Ryan.
1354000	1355000	He was always, like, kind of...
1355000	1356000	Yeah, he worked really hard.
1356000	1357000	Like, I remember, like,
1357000	1358000	looking at him and being like,
1358000	1360000	no, I never could do, like,
1360000	1362000	you know, just the motivation.
1362000	1363000	Like, I mean,
1363000	1365000	I look at his success
1365000	1367000	and I'm just not really
1367000	1368000	terribly surprised
1368000	1369000	just because of, like,
1369000	1370000	yeah, he was just really,
1370000	1372000	really high energy.
1372000	1373000	Yeah.
1373000	1374000	And I don't feel like
1374000	1376000	I ever saw him be like...
1376000	1377000	Really?
1377000	1378000	I mean, because what is it
1378000	1379000	that there's that kind of adage
1379000	1381000	that you make it in this industry
1381000	1382000	because you just outlast
1382000	1384000	everybody else, you know?
1384000	1385000	And you and I both know
1385000	1386000	a ton of people
1386000	1387000	who we went to USC with
1387000	1389000	who aren't in the industry anymore.
1389000	1390000	They moved back
1390000	1392000	or they just fell out of love with it
1392000	1393000	for whatever reason.
1393000	1394000	Yeah, because I...
1394000	1395000	Honestly, like,
1395000	1396000	because I did work in post
1396000	1397000	for a while like you did
1397000	1398000	and part of the reason
1398000	1399000	why I decided
1399000	1401000	I was going to leave
1401000	1403000	the industry side of things
1403000	1405000	and do writing
1405000	1406000	and YouTube full time
1406000	1407000	was just because
1407000	1409000	I didn't have the passion for it,
1409000	1410000	especially post production,
1410000	1411000	and I was like,
1411000	1414000	I can't half-ass two things.
1414000	1415000	Yeah, and it's not
1415000	1416000	a sign of failure either.
1416000	1417000	I mean, I've tried
1417000	1418000	so many things
1418000	1419000	that I've had a passion for
1419000	1420000	and just, eh,
1420000	1421000	it's not for me, you know,
1421000	1423000	and there's no harm in it.
1423000	1425000	Bullitt County will be out
1425000	1427000	whenever the,
1427000	1428000	I guess the end
1428000	1429000	of the festival process.
1429000	1430000	Yeah.
1430000	1431000	That could be
1431000	1432000	another conversation.
1432000	1433000	Oh my, yeah, yeah.
1433000	1434000	It's just kind of
1434000	1435000	seeing where it goes,
1435000	1436000	but so far,
1436000	1437000	everybody who's seen it
1437000	1438000	likes it and it's all
1438000	1439000	they can hope for.
1439000	1440000	Well, congratulations
1440000	1441000	on finishing.
1441000	1442000	Thank you.
1442000	1443000	That in and of itself
1443000	1444000	is like,
1444000	1445000	y'all ain't even know.
1445000	1446000	It's a bit, you know,
1446000	1447000	it's, you know, high five.
1447000	1448000	Thank you.
1463000	1466000	Anything buried out there
1466000	1468000	is meant to stay buried.
1471000	1472000	David, you're at
1472000	1473000	Mr. Pictures Film
1473000	1474000	on Twitter, Instagram,
1474000	1475000	and Facebook?
1475000	1476000	Yes.
1476000	1477000	With your co-producer
1477000	1478000	and also...
1478000	1479000	We're getting a YouTube
1479000	1480000	thing going,
1480000	1481000	but it's, yeah, slow.
1481000	1482000	We've been too busy
1482000	1483000	on this movie.
1483000	1484000	I know, I know.
1485000	1487000	We're also on YouPorn.
1488000	1490000	Just look for us.
1490000	1492000	Mr. Dishes.
1492000	1493000	Not Pornhub.
1493000	1494000	No, not Pornhub.
1494000	1495000	Because their search interface
1495000	1496000	is so much better.
1496000	1497000	Yeah, really.
1497000	1498000	Yeah.
1498000	1499000	Come to think of it,
1499000	1500000	we should get on Pornhub.
1500000	1501000	Yeah.
1501000	1502000	What are you doing?
1502000	1503000	They have better comments.
1503000	1504000	Also, the link to his
1504000	1505000	Kickstarter is below.
1505000	1506000	It's like,
1506000	1507000	depending on when you see this,
1507000	1508000	it should be still going
1508000	1509000	for another couple days
1509000	1510000	if you want to support
1510000	1512000	indie film.
1512000	1513000	Yeah, so if you want
1513000	1514000	to see some scenes
1514000	1515000	from the movie
1515000	1516000	that are almost completed,
1516000	1517000	go to the update section
1517000	1518000	in Kickstarter
1518000	1519000	and there's some
1519000	1520000	scenes in there.
1520000	1521000	All right, great.
1521000	1522000	Well, David,
1522000	1523000	hopefully we'll be having
1523000	1525000	a different conversation
1525000	1527000	five or ten years from now
1528000	1530000	that we'll look back on this
1530000	1533000	and laugh at the time
1533000	1535000	we chatted in the aviary.
1535000	1536000	I'll still be doing
1536000	1537000	Michael Bay impressions.
1537000	1538000	Yeah, we need to get
1538000	1540000	your dollar sign hat back.
1540000	1541000	Well, thank you for coming.
1541000	1542000	Thank you.
