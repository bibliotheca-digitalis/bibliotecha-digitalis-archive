00:00.000 --> 00:03.200
It's said that there is only one God.

00:03.200 --> 00:07.300
The anthropomorphic personification of death was a staple in Western culture

00:07.300 --> 00:10.500
long before he, she, or it appeared in modern media.

00:10.500 --> 00:15.000
And of all the anthropomorphic personifications of concepts,

00:15.000 --> 00:17.200
death is by far the most common.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.700
Death is a concept that's hard to come to terms with,

00:19.700 --> 00:24.200
and in fiction we often see characters trying to find ways to weasel their way out of death

00:24.200 --> 00:28.800
by pleading with this personification, or trying to slightly deal with them,

00:28.800 --> 00:30.500
or just avoid it altogether.

00:30.500 --> 00:33.500
Sometimes death him or herself gets a character arc,

00:33.500 --> 00:37.200
but for the most part, stories with death the character aren't about death,

00:37.200 --> 00:39.200
but who is confronting them.

00:39.200 --> 00:42.800
So, unlike, say, Captain America or Starscream,

00:42.800 --> 00:45.200
this concept is extremely broad,

00:45.200 --> 00:49.500
and the characterization is extremely varied in interpretation.

00:49.500 --> 00:54.000
So, since this character and this topic is so broad,

00:54.000 --> 00:56.700
instead of doing it chronologically like I normally do,

00:56.800 --> 01:00.100
I'm going to do it a little bit differently this month.

01:00.100 --> 01:07.400
So, let us now take a merry jaunt through some of the many pop culture iterations of death.

01:16.300 --> 01:20.600
The traditional image of death nowadays is that of a dude in a large billowing black cloak,

01:20.600 --> 01:22.300
and usually with a scythe.

01:22.300 --> 01:26.400
The first attested use of the term the Grim Reaper was in 1847,

01:26.400 --> 01:29.400
hence the scythe. He harvests souls.

01:29.400 --> 01:33.700
This interpretation is the most recognizable and is therefore the most common here in the West.

01:33.700 --> 01:35.000
So, history.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.400
Hades was the lord of the dead, but Thanatos was death itself, not Hades.

01:40.400 --> 01:44.500
Entities like Hades or Osiris or the Norse goddess Hel,

01:44.500 --> 01:49.200
they are death-relevant, but not death personifications.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.500
They don't make the death happen.

01:51.500 --> 01:55.800
The most well-known myth involving the Greek Thanatos is that of King Sisyphus

01:55.800 --> 02:00.200
tricking him into getting chained up so no one died for a little while.

02:00.200 --> 02:04.600
Of course, this did not last, and Sisyphus' eventual punishment

02:04.600 --> 02:08.600
was the whole pushing a boulder up a hill for eternity thing.

02:08.600 --> 02:11.700
This is the origin for many narratives involving tricking death,

02:11.700 --> 02:16.000
outwitting death, playing games against death, etc.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.900
The most well-known mention of death in the Christian tradition is in the Book of Revelation.

02:19.900 --> 02:26.300
One of the four horsemen, death rides a pale horse, and Hel followed with, well, actually Hades.

02:26.300 --> 02:29.300
You know, remember how the Bible had some, like, translation wonk,

02:29.300 --> 02:31.800
which we went over back in the Hades episode?

02:31.800 --> 02:33.300
This is that.

02:33.300 --> 02:34.800
Continuity!

02:34.800 --> 02:38.500
Anyway, the four horsemen are really common. We're basically gonna skip over that.

02:38.500 --> 02:43.200
Usually, death takes the form of a pale dude or a skeleton dude.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.000
Usually.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.200
Women are often associated with mothers and fertility and therefore life,

02:48.200 --> 02:51.800
meaning that death is usually male, but not always.

02:51.800 --> 02:56.600
In Polish, the word for death is feminine, because, you know, some languages gender their nouns,

02:56.600 --> 02:58.900
and therefore the Grim Reaper was, too.

02:58.900 --> 03:03.300
Death was also traditionally female in Lithuania, Spain, France, and some Slavic countries

03:03.300 --> 03:05.700
up until the 19th and 20th century.

03:05.700 --> 03:10.400
But the modern Grim Reaper that we usually think of is mostly influenced by English and German traditions,

03:10.400 --> 03:13.700
so this guy, he's mostly from that part of the world.

03:13.700 --> 03:19.800
So anyway, all of this business is ambling up to one of the most popular modern versions of Death,

03:19.800 --> 03:28.000
the character who comes in the form not of this guy, but of this in Neil Gaiman's Sandman series.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.800
Death here is a subversion of the typical Grim Reaper.

03:30.800 --> 03:37.600
She appreciates life, she appreciates the point, she's quite merciful, she sympathizes with mortality.

03:37.600 --> 03:41.800
She is also a caring, nurturing presence, in Dream's life in particular.

03:41.900 --> 03:44.900
He's the series' protagonist, and also a huge dick.

03:44.900 --> 03:50.700
There's not really anything cruel about her, unlike Dream, who, again, likes to fuck with your minds,

03:50.700 --> 03:55.300
and using his powers of eternity, and doesn't really care much for humans.

03:55.300 --> 04:03.100
Not Death. Having spent some time amongst the living, she gained an appreciation for the shortness and vitality that is life.

04:03.100 --> 04:07.500
And, contrary to popular belief, she is not based on Tori Amos.

04:07.600 --> 04:13.200
Anyway, but the most common narrative purpose for Death is the being what gets barred in with,

04:13.200 --> 04:19.700
and this is not a thing we see so much in Sandman, which really sets it apart in many ways, but that's the biggie.

04:19.700 --> 04:25.400
The Sisyphean desire to outwit Death, trick Death, or outplay him is very, very popular,

04:25.400 --> 04:30.200
and most of what we see in film and television is highly influenced by...

04:33.200 --> 04:35.700
Vimidu.

04:35.700 --> 04:37.000
Ja, I didn't.

04:37.000 --> 04:44.400
Directed by Ingmar Bergman, The Seventh Seal may be the most well-known and influential work starring Death as a main character.

04:44.400 --> 04:49.400
It takes place during the Black Plague, after a Swedish soldier gets back from the Crusades.

04:49.400 --> 04:52.700
And yeah, the chronology for this doesn't work at all, just, you know, go with it.

04:52.700 --> 04:59.000
Antonius meets Death on the beach, and easily talks Death into a game of chess in exchange for his life,

04:59.000 --> 05:02.600
if he wins, because, and Death just likes games, so he's totally down.

05:02.600 --> 05:06.200
But, you know what? Hey, Antonius, what's so bad about dying anyway?

05:06.200 --> 05:08.700
I mean, it's the Middle Ages. Shit sucks.

05:16.100 --> 05:20.100
Ah, there it is. Antonius was never too keen on the whole religion thing,

05:20.100 --> 05:25.400
but faced with Death, he's not willing to go down without knowing, you know, what's it all about.

05:25.400 --> 05:31.000
Death in this version waffles back and forth between darkly comic and gruesome and heavily existential.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.500
There's one point where Death shows up to collect some other guy who's not Antonius,

05:35.500 --> 05:38.800
and he tries to talk Death out of it, but casually, you know?

05:38.800 --> 05:42.300
Like, he's asking for an extension for filing his taxes.

05:47.900 --> 05:53.600
In the end, Antonius loses the game, and Death comes for not only him, but his entire entourage,

05:53.600 --> 05:59.200
all of whom react differently to meeting Death in credulity, despair, even happiness.

06:00.200 --> 06:08.200
This version of Death, as in the same guy from The Seventh Seal, actually shows up again in Last Action Hero.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.500
The entire conceit of this film is film characters coming to life.

06:11.500 --> 06:17.400
So someone puts on Seventh Seal, and then, whoop, there he is, and now he's played by Ian McKellen,

06:17.400 --> 06:20.000
and oh my god, he's so Ian McKellen.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.800
He's not on any of my lists.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.600
He just seems to be, like, following them around to f**k with them.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.600
I was only curious.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
So why are you...?

06:30.000 --> 06:31.100
Eh.

06:31.100 --> 06:33.100
How's it hanging, Death?

06:33.100 --> 06:37.800
Another obvious example of Seventh Seal's influence is Bill and Ted's bogus journey,

06:37.800 --> 06:41.800
the second entry to the Bill and Ted saga.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.000
Bill and Ted spend about half of this movie dead,

06:44.000 --> 06:48.800
owing to robot clones from the future coming back in time to kill them.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.300
I totally loogied on that good dead me!

06:51.300 --> 06:53.300
And so when Death shows up, they run.

06:53.300 --> 06:57.200
I can't believe we just met up with Death!

06:57.200 --> 07:00.500
Bill and Ted spend a fair chunk of the movie meandering through the afterlife

07:00.500 --> 07:05.100
before actually getting around to playing a game against Death in exchange for their lives.

07:05.100 --> 07:07.400
First, Battleship.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.500
You have sank my battleship.

07:09.500 --> 07:14.300
And then Clue, because Death is a sore loser and wants to do it again.

07:14.300 --> 07:19.900
And then Electronic Football, and finally, Twister.

07:19.900 --> 07:22.100
Death is obligated then to sneak Bill and Ted into Heaven

07:22.100 --> 07:24.700
and talk God into giving them their lives back.

07:24.700 --> 07:26.900
They meld into me.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.800
Curiously, the narrative doesn't lose Death after he does his job,

07:30.800 --> 07:33.600
but he and some, you know, alien engineers,

07:33.600 --> 07:34.500
it's Bill and Ted,

07:34.500 --> 07:38.800
tag along to help Bill and Ted save their girlfriends and win the Battle of the Bands.

07:38.800 --> 07:42.000
So this is one of the more complete character arcs we see for Death.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.100
At first, he's all insecure because he lost,

07:44.100 --> 07:50.700
but then he finds meaning in joining the band as a bassist and melding the bad guy.

07:50.700 --> 07:52.600
Melding.

07:52.600 --> 07:55.100
Another in the vein of playing against Death and winning,

07:55.200 --> 07:58.000
we have The Grimm Adventures of Billy and Mandy,

07:58.000 --> 08:01.300
in which the two leads challenge the Grimm Reaper to a game

08:01.300 --> 08:04.700
when he comes to claim their elderly hamster.

08:04.700 --> 08:09.100
When Death loses the game, in this case, the game being the limbo,

08:09.100 --> 08:11.300
he must become their best friend forever.

08:11.300 --> 08:13.900
Though the more accurate term would be slave.

08:13.900 --> 08:17.600
The entire conceit of this series is based on Billy and Mandy humiliating Grimm

08:17.600 --> 08:19.900
like the horrid little sociopaths that they are,

08:19.900 --> 08:24.500
while Grimm bemoans his horrible lot in, um, on life.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.200
Not life. Whatever it is.

08:32.200 --> 08:35.400
This show lasted seven seasons.

08:35.400 --> 08:38.300
You can't kick me because your brain is stupid.

08:38.300 --> 08:41.900
A more recent example of playing against Death is Adventure Time,

08:41.900 --> 08:44.800
which carries also flavors the myth of Orpheus,

08:44.800 --> 08:49.100
where our hero ventures into the underworld to bring his wife back from the dead.

08:49.100 --> 08:50.100
I mean, plant.

08:50.100 --> 08:53.700
Finn was tasked with babysitting a plant and immediately killed it.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.200
So he's got to get the plant back.

08:55.200 --> 08:59.400
So, like in The Seventh Seal, Finn loses and all hope seems lost.

08:59.400 --> 09:03.800
But, unlike Seventh Seal, Finn and Death happen to have a mutual friend.

09:03.800 --> 09:07.900
Before I die, I'm honor-bound to tell you, Peppermint Butler says hi.

09:07.900 --> 09:10.200
What? You know Peppermint Butler?

09:10.200 --> 09:12.400
So that gets him out of it.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.000
Who are you?

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
I'm Callista Flockhart. Who the hell do you think I am? I'm Death.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.500
Death pops up in Family Guy a few times.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.600
In the first episode, he's played by Norm Macdonald,

09:22.600 --> 09:24.700
and then in all other appearances by Adam Carolla.

09:24.700 --> 09:27.900
I gotcha. It's just me, Death. I'm here for the body.

09:27.900 --> 09:31.700
The first time he shows up is an episode where Peter fakes his death,

09:31.700 --> 09:34.300
which in turn makes the real Death decide that,

09:34.300 --> 09:37.500
okay, that sounds legit. Time to come with me.

09:37.500 --> 09:41.200
But when Death sprains his ankle, Peter has to fill in for him.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.100
So through this, Peter gets out of dying,

09:43.100 --> 09:48.500
and Death shows up on occasion to answer, like, existential questions,

09:48.500 --> 09:51.400
and, of course, makes Seth MacFarlane jokes.

09:54.100 --> 09:56.500
So outwitting Death or making some deal with him is really common.

09:56.500 --> 10:00.300
But if you aren't playing a game with Death or making some kind of deal with him,

10:00.300 --> 10:03.200
maybe you're just straight-up trying to escape him.

10:03.200 --> 10:08.500
If I don't watch out, if I let down even for a moment, he'll get in.

10:08.500 --> 10:12.400
A famous episode of The Twilight Zone features an old lady named Wanda

10:12.500 --> 10:16.000
who has started noticing Death in crowds before he takes people

10:16.000 --> 10:19.800
and has now spent God knows how many years holed up in her house,

10:19.800 --> 10:24.700
refusing to go outside or let anyone in because she knows Death is after her.

10:24.700 --> 10:26.300
I never go out.

10:26.300 --> 10:28.000
Never.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.600
I haven't been out for years.

10:30.600 --> 10:33.400
But one day, she finally caves, even though—

10:33.400 --> 10:36.500
Yep, sorry, Wanda.

10:36.500 --> 10:40.300
But look, he's baby Robert Redford.

10:42.500 --> 10:46.800
And then he's, like, blue-stealing her.

10:46.800 --> 10:49.700
Death is such a cinnamon roll in this version, you know?

10:49.700 --> 10:53.100
What a great guy to transition people out of this life and into the next.

10:53.100 --> 10:54.700
Go, Wanda, go.

10:54.700 --> 10:56.500
You go with baby Robert Redford.

10:56.500 --> 11:02.600
What you feared would come like an explosion is like a whisper.

11:02.600 --> 11:04.800
Death has no master.

11:04.800 --> 11:09.900
1964's Mask of the Red Death, based on the Edgar Allan Poe story of the same name,

11:09.900 --> 11:12.700
features another group of people holding up to avoid Death,

11:12.700 --> 11:15.600
only this Death is not such a cinnamon roll.

11:15.600 --> 11:18.700
This isn't just any Death, but a very specific plague.

11:18.700 --> 11:21.300
In fact, there appear to be, like, a whole rainbow of Deaths.

11:21.300 --> 11:23.400
Black Death, Yellow Death, Green Death.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.700
It's a Death Rainbow Brigade.

11:25.700 --> 11:28.700
This movie stars the deliciously hammy Vincent Price,

11:28.700 --> 11:34.500
both as the evil Prince Prospero and, eventually, as the Red Death himself.

11:34.500 --> 11:37.700
The original story takes place during a horrible plague

11:37.700 --> 11:40.600
where a bunch of rich asshats hide in their castle

11:40.600 --> 11:43.300
while the Red Death ravages the peasantry below.

11:43.300 --> 11:46.700
But where Prince Prospero and his fellow rich folk in the original story

11:46.700 --> 11:50.800
just ignore the suffering, Vincent Price's version takes it a step further.

11:50.800 --> 11:56.400
Okay, more like a giant Superman leap further, and is also a Satanist.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.600
When the Red Death shows up, Prospero's like,

11:58.600 --> 12:03.200
Yay, it's Satan. You're here to, like, reward me for worshipping you, right?

12:03.200 --> 12:07.400
No. No. No. Sorry. Sorry, Vincent Price.

12:07.400 --> 12:11.300
Death is a major backstory player in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,

12:11.300 --> 12:16.100
where he pops up in Hermione's telling of how our MacGuffins came into existence in the first place.

12:16.100 --> 12:21.100
In this story, Death feels cheated when three wizard brothers evade a dangerous river

12:21.100 --> 12:23.000
that usually kills people.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.800
So, he tells these three brothers he'll grant them some wish

12:25.800 --> 12:27.800
in a sort of deal-with-the-devil setup.

12:27.800 --> 12:30.000
Numbers one and two die because of their arrogance,

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
but brother number three evades Death.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.400
You know, for a while, because he's humble.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.400
But, of course, not forever, you know, since Valor Morghulis.

12:37.400 --> 12:41.600
He then greeted Death as an old friend, and went with him gladly.

12:41.600 --> 12:46.800
It's weird that he'd greet Death as a friend since Death gamed the system like that.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.000
Well, maybe he thought his brothers were dicks, too.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.200
Alice?

12:50.200 --> 12:54.800
The Death feels cheated motif is more central to the plot of the Final Destination series

12:54.800 --> 12:56.600
in increasingly goofy ways.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.800
You can just drop fucking dead.

12:59.800 --> 13:01.000
Oh!

13:01.000 --> 13:02.800
Here, Death falls less on the human end,

13:02.800 --> 13:07.600
more of like a devious, translucent swoosh than a legit personification.

13:07.600 --> 13:12.600
But Death is an antagonist that schemes and has a presence, so I'm counting it.

13:12.600 --> 13:16.400
Death gets cheated out of Devansawa and his buddies in the first movie.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.600
It was an accident.

13:17.600 --> 13:22.200
In Death, there are no accidents and no escapes.

13:22.200 --> 13:27.000
Throughout the series, some of the characters manage to contrive some ways to escape Death's plan.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.800
But for the most part, the theme is that you can't cheat Death.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.400
And if you do evade Death for a time, your resulting eventual death will be ridiculous.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.400
I am Death.

13:44.600 --> 13:47.600
Yes, well, the thing is, we've got some people from America for dinner tonight.

13:47.600 --> 13:48.800
Who is it, darling?

13:48.800 --> 13:51.600
It's a Mr. Death or something. He's come about the reaping.

13:51.600 --> 13:55.200
Monty Python's meaning of life is in that Douglas Adamsian tradition

13:55.400 --> 13:58.600
of exploring human existence through absurdist comedy.

13:58.600 --> 14:02.600
The joke here is mostly about people's inability to face uncomfortable truths.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.800
Good evening. This is Mr. Death.

14:05.800 --> 14:08.200
This is a big theme in British comedy.

14:08.200 --> 14:11.800
The Grim Reaper.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.400
Hardly surprising in this weather.

14:15.400 --> 14:20.800
Another popular concept in recent years is that of there being a bunch of reapers on, like, a payroll

14:20.800 --> 14:24.000
and Death being this big bureaucratic enterprise.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.200
In Dead Like Me, the dead sometimes become grim reapers

14:27.200 --> 14:30.600
and it's treated like a mind-numbing 9-to-5 scenario,

14:30.600 --> 14:35.600
playing what amounts to indentured servitude as a, like, bad temp agency or something.

14:36.800 --> 14:40.600
This is Rube. He's my boss. He's undead too.

14:40.600 --> 14:43.200
Reapers here don't appear to have much in the way of powers.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.200
Why couldn't we have taken a cab?

14:45.200 --> 14:49.800
They can't walk through walls or float or anything, and they just take souls.

14:49.800 --> 14:53.200
Things called gravelings appear to do the actual work of killing.

14:54.200 --> 14:55.200
Come on.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.000
Shit.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.600
This TV show has a tone problem. Moving on.

15:01.600 --> 15:06.400
In the anime Black Butler, we see an even more explicitly bureaucratic organization.

15:06.400 --> 15:10.200
This one almost Men in Black-y with the way it goes about things.

15:10.200 --> 15:14.200
It's just a job, and there is no place for emotion in a job.

15:14.200 --> 15:18.800
And these guys were never human, and when people die, they just come and collect souls.

15:18.800 --> 15:22.000
And souls come out like celluloid, this being all their memories.

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
They each get a scythe, often anachronistic, like, the celluloid, you know, just, you know, roll with it.

15:31.000 --> 15:37.200
Also, this guy is the most popular of the Reaper characters, or maybe any of the characters by a lot.

15:37.200 --> 15:40.200
I'm the queen of the Reapers, the ripest fruit there is.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.600
Oh, Japan.

15:41.600 --> 15:46.000
And no, this isn't just coding. This guy has a huge crush on the titular butler.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.800
At last, our amorous adventure can begin anew.

15:49.600 --> 15:53.000
Death sometimes has motivations other than his or her job.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.200
We often see Death wanting to learn about a thing, or understand a thing.

15:58.200 --> 16:01.600
I could introduce myself properly, but it's not really necessary.

16:01.600 --> 16:06.400
You'll know me well enough and soon enough, depending on a diverse range of variables.

16:06.400 --> 16:12.200
In the book, The Book Thief, Death wants to contextualize a specific life.

16:12.200 --> 16:16.000
That of Liesel, who was a German schoolgirl during World War II,

16:16.200 --> 16:21.200
and who he saw a lot in that time, since she was in Germany during World War II.

16:21.200 --> 16:24.800
This is a first-person narrative by a character who is not the main character,

16:24.800 --> 16:27.600
like the Great Gatsby or Heart of Darkness.

16:27.600 --> 16:32.200
And Death is not in the story at all, unlike those previous two.

16:32.200 --> 16:38.200
So, obviously, since it's a point-of-view thing in a story in which Death is not a character,

16:38.200 --> 16:43.800
like he doesn't show up or give Liesel helpful advice or, you know, make her a dress to wear to the ball or something,

16:43.800 --> 16:50.600
this works way better in the book than in the film adaptation, which exists.

16:50.600 --> 16:55.200
But usually, Death wanting to learn a thing involves Death getting a girlfriend.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.600
Before we go into that, let's talk about the Death and the Maiden.

16:57.600 --> 17:02.000
Death and the Maiden was a popular art motif dating back to the 18th century.

17:02.000 --> 17:07.000
Ludwig Gleim wrote a poem called Enden Tod, or To Death.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.400
Gleim is mad at Death because, you know, his, like, girlfriends keep dying.

17:11.400 --> 17:18.600
So, clearly, it was because Death, you know, totally had, like, a death boner for these girls.

17:18.600 --> 17:22.800
He's like, hey, brah, you don't even have lips, brah. Why are you taking all my girls, brah?

17:22.800 --> 17:28.800
So Death and the Maiden is like a distinct cousin to the Beauty and the Beast motif, that of Death as a lover.

17:28.800 --> 17:34.200
This is played with as a very on-the-nose theme in the original Phantom of the Opera, the book, that is.

17:34.200 --> 17:39.800
But the Phantom, much as he will tell you otherwise, is not Death himself.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.400
The strangest shadow is following us.

17:42.400 --> 17:43.400
Following?

17:43.400 --> 17:45.800
It was right behind us all the time we were racing.

17:45.800 --> 17:49.400
In Death Takes a Holiday, some wealthy idiots have a near-death experience,

17:49.400 --> 17:54.600
and Death decides to stick around because he wants to know why mortals fear him so much.

17:54.600 --> 17:59.600
And so he makes a deal with this duke to stay at his place and eat his food and just jerk around for a bit.

17:59.600 --> 18:06.400
Can you conceive how lonely I am when there is nothing that doesn't shun me, that doesn't fade as I come near?

18:06.400 --> 18:08.400
Death starts a life journal.

18:08.400 --> 18:12.600
His love interest is Grazia, who seems to see marriage as a form of death.

18:13.600 --> 18:14.800
I'm not ready.

18:14.800 --> 18:19.000
All the other girls fear him, but not Grazia. No, she's not like all those other girls.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.200
So when in the end, Death straight-up says,

18:21.200 --> 18:25.200
No, you have to die to come with me, she's like, it's cool.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.200
I'm ready.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.800
No, no, you can't come with me.

18:27.800 --> 18:29.400
Yes, I can.

18:29.400 --> 18:32.200
Would a single goddamn one of you trust me with the decisions I am making?

18:32.200 --> 18:35.000
I get it. I know who you are, and I'm down.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
You see me as I am.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.200
But I've always seen you like that.

18:40.200 --> 18:43.600
And she goes with him, and it's awesome.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.800
And as strong as Death.

18:46.800 --> 18:50.600
Death Takes a Holiday was agonizingly remade into...

18:58.600 --> 19:01.600
It is twice as long.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.200
Kill everything.

19:03.200 --> 19:06.600
It's ironic how much this movie makes you long for death.

19:08.600 --> 19:13.600
In this version, Death gives Anthony Hopkins some more time for putting up with him.

19:13.600 --> 19:17.600
The original works a lot better, because the characters are all dancing around

19:17.600 --> 19:21.200
on the weird formalities of European aristocracy.

19:21.200 --> 19:25.000
So everyone's weird and stilted and unnatural, but it makes sense.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.800
Here, it's just...

19:26.800 --> 19:29.200
Jo, you do get around.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.400
That's your name?

19:30.400 --> 19:32.200
And isn't it a lovely one?

19:32.200 --> 19:35.200
So sturdy, so straight.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.400
Stop it.

19:37.400 --> 19:40.400
The Monty Python scene was more realistic.

19:40.400 --> 19:43.200
Mr. Death is a reaper.

19:43.200 --> 19:47.600
The maiden in this movie does not follow Death into the great beyond.

19:47.600 --> 19:52.400
The sexy body Death took in the form of Brad Pitt pops back to life,

19:52.400 --> 19:54.000
and the lady goes,

19:54.000 --> 19:56.200
Okay, I'll settle.

19:56.200 --> 20:01.000
So on top of being agonizingly long and boring, this one is...

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
problematic.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.400
Thanks for letting me use your body, bruh.

20:05.400 --> 20:10.000
I saved the best for last, as I think few would argue that Terry Pratchett's death...

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
The death of Terry...

20:11.000 --> 20:13.200
Oh my god, there's no good way to praise that.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.800
Discworld!

20:14.800 --> 20:21.600
I am Death, the Grim Reaper of the Discworld.

20:21.600 --> 20:24.800
This version is not only the most fleshed out, so to speak,

20:24.800 --> 20:28.000
but a combination of all of the above in a lot of ways.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.200
Death has appeared in every Discworld novel,

20:30.200 --> 20:32.800
although he was a main character only in five of them.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.200
He does do the occasional play games with you for your life thing,

20:35.200 --> 20:37.400
and he was originally a more sinister presence,

20:37.400 --> 20:41.800
but by the time he was a lead character, he had a more sympathetic and humorous personality.

20:41.800 --> 20:45.600
Death has an adopted daughter named Isabel that he saved from the wastes.

20:45.600 --> 20:46.400
Why?

20:46.400 --> 20:50.800
Well, she says once that, you know, he didn't feel sorry for me.

20:50.800 --> 20:54.600
He never feels anything. He probably thought sorry for me.

20:54.600 --> 20:59.400
This is in no way supported by the narrative, as Death clearly feels lots of stuff.

20:59.400 --> 21:03.200
Ennui, affection, regret, ennui.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.800
He's real big on the ennui.

21:04.800 --> 21:08.600
I need to imbibe vast amounts of alcohol.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.000
Vast? Hermines?

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
I need to forget.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.600
But the real relationship that makes this version unique

21:14.600 --> 21:18.600
is to his granddaughter through Isabel, Susan Stohelid.

21:18.600 --> 21:21.400
Would you like a drink before you go?

21:21.400 --> 21:25.600
A cup of cocoa would be appropriate in the circumstances.

21:25.600 --> 21:29.400
We see her in both of the Discworld adaptations that star Death.

21:29.400 --> 21:33.600
Terry Pratchett's Hogfather, wherein he is voiced by Ian Richardson,

21:33.600 --> 21:38.600
and Soul Music, where he is voiced by Christopher Lee, and it is adorable.

21:38.600 --> 21:44.000
You haven't got a kiss for your old granddad?

21:44.000 --> 21:47.600
The problem with both of these is that they are three hours long.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.000
Each.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.800
In Soul Music, Susan has to take over Death's job

21:52.000 --> 21:56.200
while he's out trying to deal with all those emotions he totally doesn't feel.

21:56.200 --> 22:00.800
I may have allowed myself a flicker of emotion.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.800
I can give it up any time I like.

22:02.800 --> 22:05.400
Terry Pratchett's Hogfather features a similar premise,

22:05.400 --> 22:09.200
where Death has to stand in for the Discworld Santa equivalent.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.200
You're supposed to say thank you.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.800
Thank you.

22:12.800 --> 22:16.000
And be good. This is part of the arrangement.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.200
Yes.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.600
Then we have a contract.

22:18.600 --> 22:23.800
Both of these are a slog to get through because there's so, so much extraneous in there.

22:23.800 --> 22:26.800
This works way better on the page, but the truth is, like,

22:26.800 --> 22:30.400
for both of these, Death's portions are priceless and wonderful.

22:30.400 --> 22:33.800
It is unfair.

22:33.800 --> 22:37.600
Well, that's life, isn't it, Margaery?

22:37.600 --> 22:39.400
But I'm not.

22:39.400 --> 22:45.000
Terry Pratchett has gone on record as saying that he's received letters from terminally ill fans

22:45.000 --> 22:50.000
in which they hope that Death will resemble the Discworld incarnation.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.200
And he's also said that those particular letters

22:54.200 --> 22:58.400
usually cause him to spend some time staring at the wall.

22:58.400 --> 23:02.800
I think a wise man thinks of death as a friend.

23:02.800 --> 23:07.400
If that death comes later.

23:07.400 --> 23:11.800
That comes from one of the last interviews that Terry Pratchett did before he died earlier this year,

23:11.800 --> 23:17.400
and illustrates why that version sticks with people so very much.

23:17.400 --> 23:19.600
Would I give you a hand?

23:19.600 --> 23:23.200
Death being greeted as a friend, what better way to cope with it?

23:23.200 --> 23:27.400
It's less about Death himself so much as how he is greeted.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.800
Die vollbrot.

23:29.800 --> 23:34.200
Especially if your brothers were apparently massive pricks.

23:34.200 --> 23:38.000
So thank you for watching. Obligatory Patreon.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.200
Not gonna be a vote this time because, like I said last time,

23:41.200 --> 23:44.400
this one's going to be my choice, which I will do every five episodes.

23:44.400 --> 23:47.000
So, you think you know but you have no idea?

23:47.000 --> 23:49.600
Or maybe you do? I am pretty predictable. What is it?

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
King Kong.
