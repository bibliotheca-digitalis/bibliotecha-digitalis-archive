1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
It's said that there is only one God.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,300
The anthropomorphic personification of death was a staple in Western culture

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,500
long before he, she, or it appeared in modern media.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,000
And of all the anthropomorphic personifications of concepts,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,200
death is by far the most common.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,700
Death is a concept that's hard to come to terms with,

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,200
and in fiction we often see characters trying to find ways to weasel their way out of death

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,800
by pleading with this personification, or trying to slightly deal with them,

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,500
or just avoid it altogether.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,500
Sometimes death him or herself gets a character arc,

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,200
but for the most part, stories with death the character aren't about death,

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,200
but who is confronting them.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,800
So, unlike, say, Captain America or Starscream,

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,200
this concept is extremely broad,

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,500
and the characterization is extremely varied in interpretation.

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
So, since this character and this topic is so broad,

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,700
instead of doing it chronologically like I normally do,

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,100
I'm going to do it a little bit differently this month.

19
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:07,400
So, let us now take a merry jaunt through some of the many pop culture iterations of death.

20
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,600
The traditional image of death nowadays is that of a dude in a large billowing black cloak,

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,300
and usually with a scythe.

22
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,400
The first attested use of the term the Grim Reaper was in 1847,

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,400
hence the scythe. He harvests souls.

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,700
This interpretation is the most recognizable and is therefore the most common here in the West.

25
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,000
So, history.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,400
Hades was the lord of the dead, but Thanatos was death itself, not Hades.

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,500
Entities like Hades or Osiris or the Norse goddess Hel,

28
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,200
they are death-relevant, but not death personifications.

29
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,500
They don't make the death happen.

30
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,800
The most well-known myth involving the Greek Thanatos is that of King Sisyphus

31
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,200
tricking him into getting chained up so no one died for a little while.

32
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,600
Of course, this did not last, and Sisyphus' eventual punishment

33
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,600
was the whole pushing a boulder up a hill for eternity thing.

34
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,700
This is the origin for many narratives involving tricking death,

35
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,000
outwitting death, playing games against death, etc.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,900
The most well-known mention of death in the Christian tradition is in the Book of Revelation.

37
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:26,300
One of the four horsemen, death rides a pale horse, and Hel followed with, well, actually Hades.

38
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,300
You know, remember how the Bible had some, like, translation wonk,

39
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,800
which we went over back in the Hades episode?

40
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,300
This is that.

41
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,800
Continuity!

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,500
Anyway, the four horsemen are really common. We're basically gonna skip over that.

43
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,200
Usually, death takes the form of a pale dude or a skeleton dude.

44
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,000
Usually.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,200
Women are often associated with mothers and fertility and therefore life,

46
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,800
meaning that death is usually male, but not always.

47
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,600
In Polish, the word for death is feminine, because, you know, some languages gender their nouns,

48
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,900
and therefore the Grim Reaper was, too.

49
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,300
Death was also traditionally female in Lithuania, Spain, France, and some Slavic countries

50
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,700
up until the 19th and 20th century.

51
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,400
But the modern Grim Reaper that we usually think of is mostly influenced by English and German traditions,

52
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,700
so this guy, he's mostly from that part of the world.

53
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:19,800
So anyway, all of this business is ambling up to one of the most popular modern versions of Death,

54
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:28,000
the character who comes in the form not of this guy, but of this in Neil Gaiman's Sandman series.

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,800
Death here is a subversion of the typical Grim Reaper.

56
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:37,600
She appreciates life, she appreciates the point, she's quite merciful, she sympathizes with mortality.

57
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,800
She is also a caring, nurturing presence, in Dream's life in particular.

58
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,900
He's the series' protagonist, and also a huge dick.

59
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:50,700
There's not really anything cruel about her, unlike Dream, who, again, likes to fuck with your minds,

60
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,300
and using his powers of eternity, and doesn't really care much for humans.

61
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:03,100
Not Death. Having spent some time amongst the living, she gained an appreciation for the shortness and vitality that is life.

62
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,500
And, contrary to popular belief, she is not based on Tori Amos.

63
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:13,200
Anyway, but the most common narrative purpose for Death is the being what gets barred in with,

64
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,700
and this is not a thing we see so much in Sandman, which really sets it apart in many ways, but that's the biggie.

65
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:25,400
The Sisyphean desire to outwit Death, trick Death, or outplay him is very, very popular,

66
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,200
and most of what we see in film and television is highly influenced by...

67
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,700
Vimidu.

68
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,000
Ja, I didn't.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,400
Directed by Ingmar Bergman, The Seventh Seal may be the most well-known and influential work starring Death as a main character.

70
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,400
It takes place during the Black Plague, after a Swedish soldier gets back from the Crusades.

71
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,700
And yeah, the chronology for this doesn't work at all, just, you know, go with it.

72
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:59,000
Antonius meets Death on the beach, and easily talks Death into a game of chess in exchange for his life,

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,600
if he wins, because, and Death just likes games, so he's totally down.

74
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,200
But, you know what? Hey, Antonius, what's so bad about dying anyway?

75
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,700
I mean, it's the Middle Ages. Shit sucks.

76
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,100
Ah, there it is. Antonius was never too keen on the whole religion thing,

77
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,400
but faced with Death, he's not willing to go down without knowing, you know, what's it all about.

78
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,000
Death in this version waffles back and forth between darkly comic and gruesome and heavily existential.

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,500
There's one point where Death shows up to collect some other guy who's not Antonius,

80
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,800
and he tries to talk Death out of it, but casually, you know?

81
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,300
Like, he's asking for an extension for filing his taxes.

82
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:53,600
In the end, Antonius loses the game, and Death comes for not only him, but his entire entourage,

83
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,200
all of whom react differently to meeting Death in credulity, despair, even happiness.

84
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:08,200
This version of Death, as in the same guy from The Seventh Seal, actually shows up again in Last Action Hero.

85
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,500
The entire conceit of this film is film characters coming to life.

86
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:17,400
So someone puts on Seventh Seal, and then, whoop, there he is, and now he's played by Ian McKellen,

87
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,000
and oh my god, he's so Ian McKellen.

88
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,800
He's not on any of my lists.

89
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,600
He just seems to be, like, following them around to f**k with them.

90
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
I was only curious.

91
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So why are you...?

92
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,100
Eh.

93
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,100
How's it hanging, Death?

94
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,800
Another obvious example of Seventh Seal's influence is Bill and Ted's bogus journey,

95
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,800
the second entry to the Bill and Ted saga.

96
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,000
Bill and Ted spend about half of this movie dead,

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,800
owing to robot clones from the future coming back in time to kill them.

98
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,300
I totally loogied on that good dead me!

99
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,300
And so when Death shows up, they run.

100
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,200
I can't believe we just met up with Death!

101
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,500
Bill and Ted spend a fair chunk of the movie meandering through the afterlife

102
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,100
before actually getting around to playing a game against Death in exchange for their lives.

103
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,400
First, Battleship.

104
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,500
You have sank my battleship.

105
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,300
And then Clue, because Death is a sore loser and wants to do it again.

106
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,900
And then Electronic Football, and finally, Twister.

107
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,100
Death is obligated then to sneak Bill and Ted into Heaven

108
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,700
and talk God into giving them their lives back.

109
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,900
They meld into me.

110
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,800
Curiously, the narrative doesn't lose Death after he does his job,

111
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,600
but he and some, you know, alien engineers,

112
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,500
it's Bill and Ted,

113
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,800
tag along to help Bill and Ted save their girlfriends and win the Battle of the Bands.

114
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,000
So this is one of the more complete character arcs we see for Death.

115
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,100
At first, he's all insecure because he lost,

116
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:50,700
but then he finds meaning in joining the band as a bassist and melding the bad guy.

117
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,600
Melding.

118
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,100
Another in the vein of playing against Death and winning,

119
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,000
we have The Grimm Adventures of Billy and Mandy,

120
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,300
in which the two leads challenge the Grimm Reaper to a game

121
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,700
when he comes to claim their elderly hamster.

122
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,100
When Death loses the game, in this case, the game being the limbo,

123
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,300
he must become their best friend forever.

124
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,900
Though the more accurate term would be slave.

125
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,600
The entire conceit of this series is based on Billy and Mandy humiliating Grimm

126
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,900
like the horrid little sociopaths that they are,

127
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,500
while Grimm bemoans his horrible lot in, um, on life.

128
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,200
Not life. Whatever it is.

129
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,400
This show lasted seven seasons.

130
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,300
You can't kick me because your brain is stupid.

131
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,900
A more recent example of playing against Death is Adventure Time,

132
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,800
which carries also flavors the myth of Orpheus,

133
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,100
where our hero ventures into the underworld to bring his wife back from the dead.

134
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,100
I mean, plant.

135
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,700
Finn was tasked with babysitting a plant and immediately killed it.

136
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,200
So he's got to get the plant back.

137
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,400
So, like in The Seventh Seal, Finn loses and all hope seems lost.

138
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,800
But, unlike Seventh Seal, Finn and Death happen to have a mutual friend.

139
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,900
Before I die, I'm honor-bound to tell you, Peppermint Butler says hi.

140
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,200
What? You know Peppermint Butler?

141
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,400
So that gets him out of it.

142
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,000
Who are you?

143
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm Callista Flockhart. Who the hell do you think I am? I'm Death.

144
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,500
Death pops up in Family Guy a few times.

145
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,600
In the first episode, he's played by Norm Macdonald,

146
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,700
and then in all other appearances by Adam Carolla.

147
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,900
I gotcha. It's just me, Death. I'm here for the body.

148
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,700
The first time he shows up is an episode where Peter fakes his death,

149
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,300
which in turn makes the real Death decide that,

150
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,500
okay, that sounds legit. Time to come with me.

151
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,200
But when Death sprains his ankle, Peter has to fill in for him.

152
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,100
So through this, Peter gets out of dying,

153
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:48,500
and Death shows up on occasion to answer, like, existential questions,

154
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,400
and, of course, makes Seth MacFarlane jokes.

155
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,500
So outwitting Death or making some deal with him is really common.

156
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,300
But if you aren't playing a game with Death or making some kind of deal with him,

157
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,200
maybe you're just straight-up trying to escape him.

158
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,500
If I don't watch out, if I let down even for a moment, he'll get in.

159
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,400
A famous episode of The Twilight Zone features an old lady named Wanda

160
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,000
who has started noticing Death in crowds before he takes people

161
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,800
and has now spent God knows how many years holed up in her house,

162
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,700
refusing to go outside or let anyone in because she knows Death is after her.

163
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,300
I never go out.

164
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,000
Never.

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,600
I haven't been out for years.

166
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,400
But one day, she finally caves, even though—

167
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,500
Yep, sorry, Wanda.

168
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,300
But look, he's baby Robert Redford.

169
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,800
And then he's, like, blue-stealing her.

170
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,700
Death is such a cinnamon roll in this version, you know?

171
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,100
What a great guy to transition people out of this life and into the next.

172
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,700
Go, Wanda, go.

173
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,500
You go with baby Robert Redford.

174
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:02,600
What you feared would come like an explosion is like a whisper.

175
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,800
Death has no master.

176
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,900
1964's Mask of the Red Death, based on the Edgar Allan Poe story of the same name,

177
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,700
features another group of people holding up to avoid Death,

178
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,600
only this Death is not such a cinnamon roll.

179
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,700
This isn't just any Death, but a very specific plague.

180
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,300
In fact, there appear to be, like, a whole rainbow of Deaths.

181
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,400
Black Death, Yellow Death, Green Death.

182
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,700
It's a Death Rainbow Brigade.

183
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,700
This movie stars the deliciously hammy Vincent Price,

184
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:34,500
both as the evil Prince Prospero and, eventually, as the Red Death himself.

185
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,700
The original story takes place during a horrible plague

186
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,600
where a bunch of rich asshats hide in their castle

187
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,300
while the Red Death ravages the peasantry below.

188
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,700
But where Prince Prospero and his fellow rich folk in the original story

189
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,800
just ignore the suffering, Vincent Price's version takes it a step further.

190
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,400
Okay, more like a giant Superman leap further, and is also a Satanist.

191
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,600
When the Red Death shows up, Prospero's like,

192
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,200
Yay, it's Satan. You're here to, like, reward me for worshipping you, right?

193
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,400
No. No. No. Sorry. Sorry, Vincent Price.

194
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,300
Death is a major backstory player in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,

195
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:16,100
where he pops up in Hermione's telling of how our MacGuffins came into existence in the first place.

196
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,100
In this story, Death feels cheated when three wizard brothers evade a dangerous river

197
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,000
that usually kills people.

198
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,800
So, he tells these three brothers he'll grant them some wish

199
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
in a sort of deal-with-the-devil setup.

200
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,000
Numbers one and two die because of their arrogance,

201
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
but brother number three evades Death.

202
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,400
You know, for a while, because he's humble.

203
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,400
But, of course, not forever, you know, since Valor Morghulis.

204
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,600
He then greeted Death as an old friend, and went with him gladly.

205
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,800
It's weird that he'd greet Death as a friend since Death gamed the system like that.

206
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,000
Well, maybe he thought his brothers were dicks, too.

207
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,200
Alice?

208
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,800
The Death feels cheated motif is more central to the plot of the Final Destination series

209
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,600
in increasingly goofy ways.

210
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,800
You can just drop fucking dead.

211
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,000
Oh!

212
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,800
Here, Death falls less on the human end,

213
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,600
more of like a devious, translucent swoosh than a legit personification.

214
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,600
But Death is an antagonist that schemes and has a presence, so I'm counting it.

215
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,400
Death gets cheated out of Devansawa and his buddies in the first movie.

216
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,600
It was an accident.

217
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,200
In Death, there are no accidents and no escapes.

218
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,000
Throughout the series, some of the characters manage to contrive some ways to escape Death's plan.

219
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,800
But for the most part, the theme is that you can't cheat Death.

220
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,400
And if you do evade Death for a time, your resulting eventual death will be ridiculous.

221
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,400
I am Death.

222
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,600
Yes, well, the thing is, we've got some people from America for dinner tonight.

223
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,800
Who is it, darling?

224
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,600
It's a Mr. Death or something. He's come about the reaping.

225
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,200
Monty Python's meaning of life is in that Douglas Adamsian tradition

226
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,600
of exploring human existence through absurdist comedy.

227
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,600
The joke here is mostly about people's inability to face uncomfortable truths.

228
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,800
Good evening. This is Mr. Death.

229
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,200
This is a big theme in British comedy.

230
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,800
The Grim Reaper.

231
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,400
Hardly surprising in this weather.

232
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:20,800
Another popular concept in recent years is that of there being a bunch of reapers on, like, a payroll

233
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,000
and Death being this big bureaucratic enterprise.

234
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,200
In Dead Like Me, the dead sometimes become grim reapers

235
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,600
and it's treated like a mind-numbing 9-to-5 scenario,

236
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,600
playing what amounts to indentured servitude as a, like, bad temp agency or something.

237
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,600
This is Rube. He's my boss. He's undead too.

238
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,200
Reapers here don't appear to have much in the way of powers.

239
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,200
Why couldn't we have taken a cab?

240
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,800
They can't walk through walls or float or anything, and they just take souls.

241
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,200
Things called gravelings appear to do the actual work of killing.

242
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,200
Come on.

243
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,000
Shit.

244
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,600
This TV show has a tone problem. Moving on.

245
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,400
In the anime Black Butler, we see an even more explicitly bureaucratic organization.

246
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,200
This one almost Men in Black-y with the way it goes about things.

247
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,200
It's just a job, and there is no place for emotion in a job.

248
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,800
And these guys were never human, and when people die, they just come and collect souls.

249
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,000
And souls come out like celluloid, this being all their memories.

250
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
They each get a scythe, often anachronistic, like, the celluloid, you know, just, you know, roll with it.

251
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,200
Also, this guy is the most popular of the Reaper characters, or maybe any of the characters by a lot.

252
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,200
I'm the queen of the Reapers, the ripest fruit there is.

253
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,600
Oh, Japan.

254
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,000
And no, this isn't just coding. This guy has a huge crush on the titular butler.

255
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,800
At last, our amorous adventure can begin anew.

256
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,000
Death sometimes has motivations other than his or her job.

257
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,200
We often see Death wanting to learn about a thing, or understand a thing.

258
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,600
I could introduce myself properly, but it's not really necessary.

259
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,400
You'll know me well enough and soon enough, depending on a diverse range of variables.

260
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:12,200
In the book, The Book Thief, Death wants to contextualize a specific life.

261
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,000
That of Liesel, who was a German schoolgirl during World War II,

262
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:21,200
and who he saw a lot in that time, since she was in Germany during World War II.

263
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,800
This is a first-person narrative by a character who is not the main character,

264
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,600
like the Great Gatsby or Heart of Darkness.

265
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,200
And Death is not in the story at all, unlike those previous two.

266
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:38,200
So, obviously, since it's a point-of-view thing in a story in which Death is not a character,

267
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,800
like he doesn't show up or give Liesel helpful advice or, you know, make her a dress to wear to the ball or something,

268
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:50,600
this works way better in the book than in the film adaptation, which exists.

269
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,200
But usually, Death wanting to learn a thing involves Death getting a girlfriend.

270
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,600
Before we go into that, let's talk about the Death and the Maiden.

271
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,000
Death and the Maiden was a popular art motif dating back to the 18th century.

272
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Ludwig Gleim wrote a poem called Enden Tod, or To Death.

273
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,400
Gleim is mad at Death because, you know, his, like, girlfriends keep dying.

274
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:18,600
So, clearly, it was because Death, you know, totally had, like, a death boner for these girls.

275
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,800
He's like, hey, brah, you don't even have lips, brah. Why are you taking all my girls, brah?

276
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:28,800
So Death and the Maiden is like a distinct cousin to the Beauty and the Beast motif, that of Death as a lover.

277
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:34,200
This is played with as a very on-the-nose theme in the original Phantom of the Opera, the book, that is.

278
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,800
But the Phantom, much as he will tell you otherwise, is not Death himself.

279
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,400
The strangest shadow is following us.

280
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,400
Following?

281
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,800
It was right behind us all the time we were racing.

282
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,400
In Death Takes a Holiday, some wealthy idiots have a near-death experience,

283
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,600
and Death decides to stick around because he wants to know why mortals fear him so much.

284
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,600
And so he makes a deal with this duke to stay at his place and eat his food and just jerk around for a bit.

285
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:06,400
Can you conceive how lonely I am when there is nothing that doesn't shun me, that doesn't fade as I come near?

286
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Death starts a life journal.

287
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,600
His love interest is Grazia, who seems to see marriage as a form of death.

288
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,800
I'm not ready.

289
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,000
All the other girls fear him, but not Grazia. No, she's not like all those other girls.

290
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,200
So when in the end, Death straight-up says,

291
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,200
No, you have to die to come with me, she's like, it's cool.

292
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,200
I'm ready.

293
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,800
No, no, you can't come with me.

294
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,400
Yes, I can.

295
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,200
Would a single goddamn one of you trust me with the decisions I am making?

296
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,000
I get it. I know who you are, and I'm down.

297
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You see me as I am.

298
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,200
But I've always seen you like that.

299
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,600
And she goes with him, and it's awesome.

300
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,800
And as strong as Death.

301
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,600
Death Takes a Holiday was agonizingly remade into...

302
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,600
It is twice as long.

303
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,200
Kill everything.

304
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,600
It's ironic how much this movie makes you long for death.

305
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,600
In this version, Death gives Anthony Hopkins some more time for putting up with him.

306
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,600
The original works a lot better, because the characters are all dancing around

307
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,200
on the weird formalities of European aristocracy.

308
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,000
So everyone's weird and stilted and unnatural, but it makes sense.

309
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,800
Here, it's just...

310
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,200
Jo, you do get around.

311
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,400
That's your name?

312
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,200
And isn't it a lovely one?

313
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,200
So sturdy, so straight.

314
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,400
Stop it.

315
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,400
The Monty Python scene was more realistic.

316
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,200
Mr. Death is a reaper.

317
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,600
The maiden in this movie does not follow Death into the great beyond.

318
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,400
The sexy body Death took in the form of Brad Pitt pops back to life,

319
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,000
and the lady goes,

320
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,200
Okay, I'll settle.

321
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,000
So on top of being agonizingly long and boring, this one is...

322
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
problematic.

323
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,400
Thanks for letting me use your body, bruh.

324
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,000
I saved the best for last, as I think few would argue that Terry Pratchett's death...

325
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
The death of Terry...

326
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,200
Oh my god, there's no good way to praise that.

327
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,800
Discworld!

328
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:21,600
I am Death, the Grim Reaper of the Discworld.

329
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,800
This version is not only the most fleshed out, so to speak,

330
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,000
but a combination of all of the above in a lot of ways.

331
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,200
Death has appeared in every Discworld novel,

332
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,800
although he was a main character only in five of them.

333
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,200
He does do the occasional play games with you for your life thing,

334
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,400
and he was originally a more sinister presence,

335
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,800
but by the time he was a lead character, he had a more sympathetic and humorous personality.

336
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,600
Death has an adopted daughter named Isabel that he saved from the wastes.

337
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,400
Why?

338
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,800
Well, she says once that, you know, he didn't feel sorry for me.

339
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,600
He never feels anything. He probably thought sorry for me.

340
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,400
This is in no way supported by the narrative, as Death clearly feels lots of stuff.

341
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,200
Ennui, affection, regret, ennui.

342
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,800
He's real big on the ennui.

343
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,600
I need to imbibe vast amounts of alcohol.

344
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,000
Vast? Hermines?

345
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I need to forget.

346
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,600
But the real relationship that makes this version unique

347
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,600
is to his granddaughter through Isabel, Susan Stohelid.

348
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,400
Would you like a drink before you go?

349
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,600
A cup of cocoa would be appropriate in the circumstances.

350
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,400
We see her in both of the Discworld adaptations that star Death.

351
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,600
Terry Pratchett's Hogfather, wherein he is voiced by Ian Richardson,

352
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,600
and Soul Music, where he is voiced by Christopher Lee, and it is adorable.

353
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:44,000
You haven't got a kiss for your old granddad?

354
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,600
The problem with both of these is that they are three hours long.

355
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,000
Each.

356
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,800
In Soul Music, Susan has to take over Death's job

357
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,200
while he's out trying to deal with all those emotions he totally doesn't feel.

358
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,800
I may have allowed myself a flicker of emotion.

359
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
I can give it up any time I like.

360
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,400
Terry Pratchett's Hogfather features a similar premise,

361
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,200
where Death has to stand in for the Discworld Santa equivalent.

362
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
You're supposed to say thank you.

363
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,800
Thank you.

364
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,000
And be good. This is part of the arrangement.

365
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,200
Yes.

366
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,600
Then we have a contract.

367
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:23,800
Both of these are a slog to get through because there's so, so much extraneous in there.

368
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,800
This works way better on the page, but the truth is, like,

369
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,400
for both of these, Death's portions are priceless and wonderful.

370
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,800
It is unfair.

371
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,600
Well, that's life, isn't it, Margaery?

372
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,400
But I'm not.

373
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:45,000
Terry Pratchett has gone on record as saying that he's received letters from terminally ill fans

374
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
in which they hope that Death will resemble the Discworld incarnation.

375
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,200
And he's also said that those particular letters

376
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,400
usually cause him to spend some time staring at the wall.

377
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,800
I think a wise man thinks of death as a friend.

378
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,400
If that death comes later.

379
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,800
That comes from one of the last interviews that Terry Pratchett did before he died earlier this year,

380
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:17,400
and illustrates why that version sticks with people so very much.

381
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,600
Would I give you a hand?

382
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,200
Death being greeted as a friend, what better way to cope with it?

383
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,400
It's less about Death himself so much as how he is greeted.

384
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,800
Die vollbrot.

385
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:34,200
Especially if your brothers were apparently massive pricks.

386
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,000
So thank you for watching. Obligatory Patreon.

387
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,200
Not gonna be a vote this time because, like I said last time,

388
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,400
this one's going to be my choice, which I will do every five episodes.

389
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,000
So, you think you know but you have no idea?

390
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,600
Or maybe you do? I am pretty predictable. What is it?

391
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
King Kong.
