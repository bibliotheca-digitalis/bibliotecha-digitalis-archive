0	3200	It's said that there is only one God.
3200	7300	The anthropomorphic personification of death was a staple in Western culture
7300	10500	long before he, she, or it appeared in modern media.
10500	15000	And of all the anthropomorphic personifications of concepts,
15000	17200	death is by far the most common.
17200	19700	Death is a concept that's hard to come to terms with,
19700	24200	and in fiction we often see characters trying to find ways to weasel their way out of death
24200	28800	by pleading with this personification, or trying to slightly deal with them,
28800	30500	or just avoid it altogether.
30500	33500	Sometimes death him or herself gets a character arc,
33500	37200	but for the most part, stories with death the character aren't about death,
37200	39200	but who is confronting them.
39200	42800	So, unlike, say, Captain America or Starscream,
42800	45200	this concept is extremely broad,
45200	49500	and the characterization is extremely varied in interpretation.
49500	54000	So, since this character and this topic is so broad,
54000	56700	instead of doing it chronologically like I normally do,
56800	60100	I'm going to do it a little bit differently this month.
60100	67400	So, let us now take a merry jaunt through some of the many pop culture iterations of death.
76300	80600	The traditional image of death nowadays is that of a dude in a large billowing black cloak,
80600	82300	and usually with a scythe.
82300	86400	The first attested use of the term the Grim Reaper was in 1847,
86400	89400	hence the scythe. He harvests souls.
89400	93700	This interpretation is the most recognizable and is therefore the most common here in the West.
93700	95000	So, history.
95000	100400	Hades was the lord of the dead, but Thanatos was death itself, not Hades.
100400	104500	Entities like Hades or Osiris or the Norse goddess Hel,
104500	109200	they are death-relevant, but not death personifications.
109200	111500	They don't make the death happen.
111500	115800	The most well-known myth involving the Greek Thanatos is that of King Sisyphus
115800	120200	tricking him into getting chained up so no one died for a little while.
120200	124600	Of course, this did not last, and Sisyphus' eventual punishment
124600	128600	was the whole pushing a boulder up a hill for eternity thing.
128600	131700	This is the origin for many narratives involving tricking death,
131700	136000	outwitting death, playing games against death, etc.
136000	139900	The most well-known mention of death in the Christian tradition is in the Book of Revelation.
139900	146300	One of the four horsemen, death rides a pale horse, and Hel followed with, well, actually Hades.
146300	149300	You know, remember how the Bible had some, like, translation wonk,
149300	151800	which we went over back in the Hades episode?
151800	153300	This is that.
153300	154800	Continuity!
154800	158500	Anyway, the four horsemen are really common. We're basically gonna skip over that.
158500	163200	Usually, death takes the form of a pale dude or a skeleton dude.
163200	164000	Usually.
164000	168200	Women are often associated with mothers and fertility and therefore life,
168200	171800	meaning that death is usually male, but not always.
171800	176600	In Polish, the word for death is feminine, because, you know, some languages gender their nouns,
176600	178900	and therefore the Grim Reaper was, too.
178900	183300	Death was also traditionally female in Lithuania, Spain, France, and some Slavic countries
183300	185700	up until the 19th and 20th century.
185700	190400	But the modern Grim Reaper that we usually think of is mostly influenced by English and German traditions,
190400	193700	so this guy, he's mostly from that part of the world.
193700	199800	So anyway, all of this business is ambling up to one of the most popular modern versions of Death,
199800	208000	the character who comes in the form not of this guy, but of this in Neil Gaiman's Sandman series.
208000	210800	Death here is a subversion of the typical Grim Reaper.
210800	217600	She appreciates life, she appreciates the point, she's quite merciful, she sympathizes with mortality.
217600	221800	She is also a caring, nurturing presence, in Dream's life in particular.
221900	224900	He's the series' protagonist, and also a huge dick.
224900	230700	There's not really anything cruel about her, unlike Dream, who, again, likes to fuck with your minds,
230700	235300	and using his powers of eternity, and doesn't really care much for humans.
235300	243100	Not Death. Having spent some time amongst the living, she gained an appreciation for the shortness and vitality that is life.
243100	247500	And, contrary to popular belief, she is not based on Tori Amos.
247600	253200	Anyway, but the most common narrative purpose for Death is the being what gets barred in with,
253200	259700	and this is not a thing we see so much in Sandman, which really sets it apart in many ways, but that's the biggie.
259700	265400	The Sisyphean desire to outwit Death, trick Death, or outplay him is very, very popular,
265400	270200	and most of what we see in film and television is highly influenced by...
273200	275700	Vimidu.
275700	277000	Ja, I didn't.
277000	284400	Directed by Ingmar Bergman, The Seventh Seal may be the most well-known and influential work starring Death as a main character.
284400	289400	It takes place during the Black Plague, after a Swedish soldier gets back from the Crusades.
289400	292700	And yeah, the chronology for this doesn't work at all, just, you know, go with it.
292700	299000	Antonius meets Death on the beach, and easily talks Death into a game of chess in exchange for his life,
299000	302600	if he wins, because, and Death just likes games, so he's totally down.
302600	306200	But, you know what? Hey, Antonius, what's so bad about dying anyway?
306200	308700	I mean, it's the Middle Ages. Shit sucks.
316100	320100	Ah, there it is. Antonius was never too keen on the whole religion thing,
320100	325400	but faced with Death, he's not willing to go down without knowing, you know, what's it all about.
325400	331000	Death in this version waffles back and forth between darkly comic and gruesome and heavily existential.
331000	335500	There's one point where Death shows up to collect some other guy who's not Antonius,
335500	338800	and he tries to talk Death out of it, but casually, you know?
338800	342300	Like, he's asking for an extension for filing his taxes.
347900	353600	In the end, Antonius loses the game, and Death comes for not only him, but his entire entourage,
353600	359200	all of whom react differently to meeting Death in credulity, despair, even happiness.
360200	368200	This version of Death, as in the same guy from The Seventh Seal, actually shows up again in Last Action Hero.
368200	371500	The entire conceit of this film is film characters coming to life.
371500	377400	So someone puts on Seventh Seal, and then, whoop, there he is, and now he's played by Ian McKellen,
377400	380000	and oh my god, he's so Ian McKellen.
380000	382800	He's not on any of my lists.
382800	385600	He just seems to be, like, following them around to f**k with them.
385600	387600	I was only curious.
388000	390000	So why are you...?
390000	391100	Eh.
391100	393100	How's it hanging, Death?
393100	397800	Another obvious example of Seventh Seal's influence is Bill and Ted's bogus journey,
397800	401800	the second entry to the Bill and Ted saga.
401800	404000	Bill and Ted spend about half of this movie dead,
404000	408800	owing to robot clones from the future coming back in time to kill them.
408800	411300	I totally loogied on that good dead me!
411300	413300	And so when Death shows up, they run.
413300	417200	I can't believe we just met up with Death!
417200	420500	Bill and Ted spend a fair chunk of the movie meandering through the afterlife
420500	425100	before actually getting around to playing a game against Death in exchange for their lives.
425100	427400	First, Battleship.
427400	429500	You have sank my battleship.
429500	434300	And then Clue, because Death is a sore loser and wants to do it again.
434300	439900	And then Electronic Football, and finally, Twister.
439900	442100	Death is obligated then to sneak Bill and Ted into Heaven
442100	444700	and talk God into giving them their lives back.
444700	446900	They meld into me.
447000	450800	Curiously, the narrative doesn't lose Death after he does his job,
450800	453600	but he and some, you know, alien engineers,
453600	454500	it's Bill and Ted,
454500	458800	tag along to help Bill and Ted save their girlfriends and win the Battle of the Bands.
458800	462000	So this is one of the more complete character arcs we see for Death.
462000	464100	At first, he's all insecure because he lost,
464100	470700	but then he finds meaning in joining the band as a bassist and melding the bad guy.
470700	472600	Melding.
472600	475100	Another in the vein of playing against Death and winning,
475200	478000	we have The Grimm Adventures of Billy and Mandy,
478000	481300	in which the two leads challenge the Grimm Reaper to a game
481300	484700	when he comes to claim their elderly hamster.
484700	489100	When Death loses the game, in this case, the game being the limbo,
489100	491300	he must become their best friend forever.
491300	493900	Though the more accurate term would be slave.
493900	497600	The entire conceit of this series is based on Billy and Mandy humiliating Grimm
497600	499900	like the horrid little sociopaths that they are,
499900	504500	while Grimm bemoans his horrible lot in, um, on life.
504500	506200	Not life. Whatever it is.
512200	515400	This show lasted seven seasons.
515400	518300	You can't kick me because your brain is stupid.
518300	521900	A more recent example of playing against Death is Adventure Time,
521900	524800	which carries also flavors the myth of Orpheus,
524800	529100	where our hero ventures into the underworld to bring his wife back from the dead.
529100	530100	I mean, plant.
530100	533700	Finn was tasked with babysitting a plant and immediately killed it.
533700	535200	So he's got to get the plant back.
535200	539400	So, like in The Seventh Seal, Finn loses and all hope seems lost.
539400	543800	But, unlike Seventh Seal, Finn and Death happen to have a mutual friend.
543800	547900	Before I die, I'm honor-bound to tell you, Peppermint Butler says hi.
547900	550200	What? You know Peppermint Butler?
550200	552400	So that gets him out of it.
552400	554000	Who are you?
554000	558000	I'm Callista Flockhart. Who the hell do you think I am? I'm Death.
558000	560500	Death pops up in Family Guy a few times.
560500	562600	In the first episode, he's played by Norm Macdonald,
562600	564700	and then in all other appearances by Adam Carolla.
564700	567900	I gotcha. It's just me, Death. I'm here for the body.
567900	571700	The first time he shows up is an episode where Peter fakes his death,
571700	574300	which in turn makes the real Death decide that,
574300	577500	okay, that sounds legit. Time to come with me.
577500	581200	But when Death sprains his ankle, Peter has to fill in for him.
581200	583100	So through this, Peter gets out of dying,
583100	588500	and Death shows up on occasion to answer, like, existential questions,
588500	591400	and, of course, makes Seth MacFarlane jokes.
594100	596500	So outwitting Death or making some deal with him is really common.
596500	600300	But if you aren't playing a game with Death or making some kind of deal with him,
600300	603200	maybe you're just straight-up trying to escape him.
603200	608500	If I don't watch out, if I let down even for a moment, he'll get in.
608500	612400	A famous episode of The Twilight Zone features an old lady named Wanda
612500	616000	who has started noticing Death in crowds before he takes people
616000	619800	and has now spent God knows how many years holed up in her house,
619800	624700	refusing to go outside or let anyone in because she knows Death is after her.
624700	626300	I never go out.
626300	628000	Never.
628000	630600	I haven't been out for years.
630600	633400	But one day, she finally caves, even though—
633400	636500	Yep, sorry, Wanda.
636500	640300	But look, he's baby Robert Redford.
642500	646800	And then he's, like, blue-stealing her.
646800	649700	Death is such a cinnamon roll in this version, you know?
649700	653100	What a great guy to transition people out of this life and into the next.
653100	654700	Go, Wanda, go.
654700	656500	You go with baby Robert Redford.
656500	662600	What you feared would come like an explosion is like a whisper.
662600	664800	Death has no master.
664800	669900	1964's Mask of the Red Death, based on the Edgar Allan Poe story of the same name,
669900	672700	features another group of people holding up to avoid Death,
672700	675600	only this Death is not such a cinnamon roll.
675600	678700	This isn't just any Death, but a very specific plague.
678700	681300	In fact, there appear to be, like, a whole rainbow of Deaths.
681300	683400	Black Death, Yellow Death, Green Death.
683400	685700	It's a Death Rainbow Brigade.
685700	688700	This movie stars the deliciously hammy Vincent Price,
688700	694500	both as the evil Prince Prospero and, eventually, as the Red Death himself.
694500	697700	The original story takes place during a horrible plague
697700	700600	where a bunch of rich asshats hide in their castle
700600	703300	while the Red Death ravages the peasantry below.
703300	706700	But where Prince Prospero and his fellow rich folk in the original story
706700	710800	just ignore the suffering, Vincent Price's version takes it a step further.
710800	716400	Okay, more like a giant Superman leap further, and is also a Satanist.
716400	718600	When the Red Death shows up, Prospero's like,
718600	723200	Yay, it's Satan. You're here to, like, reward me for worshipping you, right?
723200	727400	No. No. No. Sorry. Sorry, Vincent Price.
727400	731300	Death is a major backstory player in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,
731300	736100	where he pops up in Hermione's telling of how our MacGuffins came into existence in the first place.
736100	741100	In this story, Death feels cheated when three wizard brothers evade a dangerous river
741100	743000	that usually kills people.
743000	745800	So, he tells these three brothers he'll grant them some wish
745800	747800	in a sort of deal-with-the-devil setup.
747800	750000	Numbers one and two die because of their arrogance,
750000	752000	but brother number three evades Death.
752000	754400	You know, for a while, because he's humble.
754400	757400	But, of course, not forever, you know, since Valor Morghulis.
757400	761600	He then greeted Death as an old friend, and went with him gladly.
761600	766800	It's weird that he'd greet Death as a friend since Death gamed the system like that.
766800	769000	Well, maybe he thought his brothers were dicks, too.
769000	770200	Alice?
770200	774800	The Death feels cheated motif is more central to the plot of the Final Destination series
774800	776600	in increasingly goofy ways.
776600	778800	You can just drop fucking dead.
779800	781000	Oh!
781000	782800	Here, Death falls less on the human end,
782800	787600	more of like a devious, translucent swoosh than a legit personification.
787600	792600	But Death is an antagonist that schemes and has a presence, so I'm counting it.
792600	796400	Death gets cheated out of Devansawa and his buddies in the first movie.
796400	797600	It was an accident.
797600	802200	In Death, there are no accidents and no escapes.
802200	807000	Throughout the series, some of the characters manage to contrive some ways to escape Death's plan.
807000	809800	But for the most part, the theme is that you can't cheat Death.
811000	816400	And if you do evade Death for a time, your resulting eventual death will be ridiculous.
821000	823400	I am Death.
824600	827600	Yes, well, the thing is, we've got some people from America for dinner tonight.
827600	828800	Who is it, darling?
828800	831600	It's a Mr. Death or something. He's come about the reaping.
831600	835200	Monty Python's meaning of life is in that Douglas Adamsian tradition
835400	838600	of exploring human existence through absurdist comedy.
838600	842600	The joke here is mostly about people's inability to face uncomfortable truths.
842600	845800	Good evening. This is Mr. Death.
845800	848200	This is a big theme in British comedy.
848200	851800	The Grim Reaper.
851800	853400	Hardly surprising in this weather.
855400	860800	Another popular concept in recent years is that of there being a bunch of reapers on, like, a payroll
860800	864000	and Death being this big bureaucratic enterprise.
864000	867200	In Dead Like Me, the dead sometimes become grim reapers
867200	870600	and it's treated like a mind-numbing 9-to-5 scenario,
870600	875600	playing what amounts to indentured servitude as a, like, bad temp agency or something.
876800	880600	This is Rube. He's my boss. He's undead too.
880600	883200	Reapers here don't appear to have much in the way of powers.
883200	885200	Why couldn't we have taken a cab?
885200	889800	They can't walk through walls or float or anything, and they just take souls.
889800	893200	Things called gravelings appear to do the actual work of killing.
894200	895200	Come on.
898200	899000	Shit.
899000	901600	This TV show has a tone problem. Moving on.
901600	906400	In the anime Black Butler, we see an even more explicitly bureaucratic organization.
906400	910200	This one almost Men in Black-y with the way it goes about things.
910200	914200	It's just a job, and there is no place for emotion in a job.
914200	918800	And these guys were never human, and when people die, they just come and collect souls.
918800	922000	And souls come out like celluloid, this being all their memories.
922000	927000	They each get a scythe, often anachronistic, like, the celluloid, you know, just, you know, roll with it.
931000	937200	Also, this guy is the most popular of the Reaper characters, or maybe any of the characters by a lot.
937200	940200	I'm the queen of the Reapers, the ripest fruit there is.
940200	941600	Oh, Japan.
941600	946000	And no, this isn't just coding. This guy has a huge crush on the titular butler.
946000	948800	At last, our amorous adventure can begin anew.
949600	953000	Death sometimes has motivations other than his or her job.
953000	958200	We often see Death wanting to learn about a thing, or understand a thing.
958200	961600	I could introduce myself properly, but it's not really necessary.
961600	966400	You'll know me well enough and soon enough, depending on a diverse range of variables.
966400	972200	In the book, The Book Thief, Death wants to contextualize a specific life.
972200	976000	That of Liesel, who was a German schoolgirl during World War II,
976200	981200	and who he saw a lot in that time, since she was in Germany during World War II.
981200	984800	This is a first-person narrative by a character who is not the main character,
984800	987600	like the Great Gatsby or Heart of Darkness.
987600	992200	And Death is not in the story at all, unlike those previous two.
992200	998200	So, obviously, since it's a point-of-view thing in a story in which Death is not a character,
998200	1003800	like he doesn't show up or give Liesel helpful advice or, you know, make her a dress to wear to the ball or something,
1003800	1010600	this works way better in the book than in the film adaptation, which exists.
1010600	1015200	But usually, Death wanting to learn a thing involves Death getting a girlfriend.
1015200	1017600	Before we go into that, let's talk about the Death and the Maiden.
1017600	1022000	Death and the Maiden was a popular art motif dating back to the 18th century.
1022000	1027000	Ludwig Gleim wrote a poem called Enden Tod, or To Death.
1027000	1031400	Gleim is mad at Death because, you know, his, like, girlfriends keep dying.
1031400	1038600	So, clearly, it was because Death, you know, totally had, like, a death boner for these girls.
1038600	1042800	He's like, hey, brah, you don't even have lips, brah. Why are you taking all my girls, brah?
1042800	1048800	So Death and the Maiden is like a distinct cousin to the Beauty and the Beast motif, that of Death as a lover.
1048800	1054200	This is played with as a very on-the-nose theme in the original Phantom of the Opera, the book, that is.
1054200	1059800	But the Phantom, much as he will tell you otherwise, is not Death himself.
1060000	1062400	The strangest shadow is following us.
1062400	1063400	Following?
1063400	1065800	It was right behind us all the time we were racing.
1065800	1069400	In Death Takes a Holiday, some wealthy idiots have a near-death experience,
1069400	1074600	and Death decides to stick around because he wants to know why mortals fear him so much.
1074600	1079600	And so he makes a deal with this duke to stay at his place and eat his food and just jerk around for a bit.
1079600	1086400	Can you conceive how lonely I am when there is nothing that doesn't shun me, that doesn't fade as I come near?
1086400	1088400	Death starts a life journal.
1088400	1092600	His love interest is Grazia, who seems to see marriage as a form of death.
1093600	1094800	I'm not ready.
1094800	1099000	All the other girls fear him, but not Grazia. No, she's not like all those other girls.
1099000	1101200	So when in the end, Death straight-up says,
1101200	1105200	No, you have to die to come with me, she's like, it's cool.
1105200	1106200	I'm ready.
1106200	1107800	No, no, you can't come with me.
1107800	1109400	Yes, I can.
1109400	1112200	Would a single goddamn one of you trust me with the decisions I am making?
1112200	1115000	I get it. I know who you are, and I'm down.
1115000	1118000	You see me as I am.
1118000	1120200	But I've always seen you like that.
1120200	1123600	And she goes with him, and it's awesome.
1123600	1126800	And as strong as Death.
1126800	1130600	Death Takes a Holiday was agonizingly remade into...
1138600	1141600	It is twice as long.
1141600	1143200	Kill everything.
1143200	1146600	It's ironic how much this movie makes you long for death.
1148600	1153600	In this version, Death gives Anthony Hopkins some more time for putting up with him.
1153600	1157600	The original works a lot better, because the characters are all dancing around
1157600	1161200	on the weird formalities of European aristocracy.
1161200	1165000	So everyone's weird and stilted and unnatural, but it makes sense.
1165000	1166800	Here, it's just...
1166800	1169200	Jo, you do get around.
1169200	1170400	That's your name?
1170400	1172200	And isn't it a lovely one?
1172200	1175200	So sturdy, so straight.
1176200	1177400	Stop it.
1177400	1180400	The Monty Python scene was more realistic.
1180400	1183200	Mr. Death is a reaper.
1183200	1187600	The maiden in this movie does not follow Death into the great beyond.
1187600	1192400	The sexy body Death took in the form of Brad Pitt pops back to life,
1192400	1194000	and the lady goes,
1194000	1196200	Okay, I'll settle.
1196200	1201000	So on top of being agonizingly long and boring, this one is...
1201000	1203000	problematic.
1203000	1205400	Thanks for letting me use your body, bruh.
1205400	1210000	I saved the best for last, as I think few would argue that Terry Pratchett's death...
1210000	1211000	The death of Terry...
1211000	1213200	Oh my god, there's no good way to praise that.
1213200	1214800	Discworld!
1214800	1221600	I am Death, the Grim Reaper of the Discworld.
1221600	1224800	This version is not only the most fleshed out, so to speak,
1224800	1228000	but a combination of all of the above in a lot of ways.
1228000	1230200	Death has appeared in every Discworld novel,
1230200	1232800	although he was a main character only in five of them.
1232800	1235200	He does do the occasional play games with you for your life thing,
1235200	1237400	and he was originally a more sinister presence,
1237400	1241800	but by the time he was a lead character, he had a more sympathetic and humorous personality.
1241800	1245600	Death has an adopted daughter named Isabel that he saved from the wastes.
1245600	1246400	Why?
1246400	1250800	Well, she says once that, you know, he didn't feel sorry for me.
1250800	1254600	He never feels anything. He probably thought sorry for me.
1254600	1259400	This is in no way supported by the narrative, as Death clearly feels lots of stuff.
1259400	1263200	Ennui, affection, regret, ennui.
1263200	1264800	He's real big on the ennui.
1264800	1268600	I need to imbibe vast amounts of alcohol.
1268600	1270000	Vast? Hermines?
1270000	1272000	I need to forget.
1272000	1274600	But the real relationship that makes this version unique
1274600	1278600	is to his granddaughter through Isabel, Susan Stohelid.
1278600	1281400	Would you like a drink before you go?
1281400	1285600	A cup of cocoa would be appropriate in the circumstances.
1285600	1289400	We see her in both of the Discworld adaptations that star Death.
1289400	1293600	Terry Pratchett's Hogfather, wherein he is voiced by Ian Richardson,
1293600	1298600	and Soul Music, where he is voiced by Christopher Lee, and it is adorable.
1298600	1304000	You haven't got a kiss for your old granddad?
1304000	1307600	The problem with both of these is that they are three hours long.
1307600	1309000	Each.
1309000	1311800	In Soul Music, Susan has to take over Death's job
1312000	1316200	while he's out trying to deal with all those emotions he totally doesn't feel.
1316200	1320800	I may have allowed myself a flicker of emotion.
1320800	1322800	I can give it up any time I like.
1322800	1325400	Terry Pratchett's Hogfather features a similar premise,
1325400	1329200	where Death has to stand in for the Discworld Santa equivalent.
1329200	1331200	You're supposed to say thank you.
1331200	1332800	Thank you.
1332800	1336000	And be good. This is part of the arrangement.
1336000	1337200	Yes.
1337200	1338600	Then we have a contract.
1338600	1343800	Both of these are a slog to get through because there's so, so much extraneous in there.
1343800	1346800	This works way better on the page, but the truth is, like,
1346800	1350400	for both of these, Death's portions are priceless and wonderful.
1350400	1353800	It is unfair.
1353800	1357600	Well, that's life, isn't it, Margaery?
1357600	1359400	But I'm not.
1359400	1365000	Terry Pratchett has gone on record as saying that he's received letters from terminally ill fans
1365000	1370000	in which they hope that Death will resemble the Discworld incarnation.
1370000	1374200	And he's also said that those particular letters
1374200	1378400	usually cause him to spend some time staring at the wall.
1378400	1382800	I think a wise man thinks of death as a friend.
1382800	1387400	If that death comes later.
1387400	1391800	That comes from one of the last interviews that Terry Pratchett did before he died earlier this year,
1391800	1397400	and illustrates why that version sticks with people so very much.
1397400	1399600	Would I give you a hand?
1399600	1403200	Death being greeted as a friend, what better way to cope with it?
1403200	1407400	It's less about Death himself so much as how he is greeted.
1407400	1409800	Die vollbrot.
1409800	1414200	Especially if your brothers were apparently massive pricks.
1414200	1418000	So thank you for watching. Obligatory Patreon.
1418000	1421200	Not gonna be a vote this time because, like I said last time,
1421200	1424400	this one's going to be my choice, which I will do every five episodes.
1424400	1427000	So, you think you know but you have no idea?
1427000	1429600	Or maybe you do? I am pretty predictable. What is it?
1433000	1434000	King Kong.
