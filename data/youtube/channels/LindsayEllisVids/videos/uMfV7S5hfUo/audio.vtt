WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.300
Boy, oh boy, so this is the one that everyone's been looking forward to.

00:03.300 --> 00:07.620
I'm sure Tom talked about some feminist theory on YouTube. That always goes over well.

00:07.720 --> 00:10.440
Yeah, this is gonna be an interesting topic because I feel like, you know,

00:10.440 --> 00:15.220
most of you kind of have like at least a passing knowledge of how, like, feminist film theory works.

00:15.220 --> 00:21.940
And then there's the segment of the audience that thinks it's like the matriarchal tentacle of the globalist new world order to destroy all men.

00:22.280 --> 00:24.920
So that's gonna be an interesting tightrope to walk.

00:25.880 --> 00:28.080
Glad I chose Transformers to do it!

00:28.080 --> 00:35.080
I don't play. I don't play. I don't play. I don't play.

00:35.160 --> 00:38.820
So ignoring the part where the internet has lost its mind over the last few years,

00:39.240 --> 00:43.960
feminist theory has been an integral part of critical studies for decades. And while for the sake of simplicity

00:43.960 --> 00:51.640
I would like to be able to separate feminist academia from the wide wide world of feminist hot takes on the internet,

00:52.080 --> 00:54.080
the truth is I can't because

00:54.880 --> 01:00.480
feminist academia is kind of influenced by the wide wide world of feminist hot takes on the internet and vice versa.

01:00.840 --> 01:05.440
Which leads to a lot of confusion, and I'm not really going to try to untangle that right now,

01:05.440 --> 01:09.280
but I see a lot of buzzwords being thrown around as sort of

01:09.800 --> 01:13.900
boogeyman with little regard to what the terms actually mean. Terms like

01:14.640 --> 01:16.640
feminism, post-modernism,

01:17.560 --> 01:21.920
Marxism, Freudian psychoanalysis, the Jews, and so on.

01:21.920 --> 01:27.000
But the important thing to remember about any kind of theory is that while yeah, it usually has some kind of an agenda,

01:27.000 --> 01:29.160
it's really more about putting

01:29.740 --> 01:34.480
some element of culture within a framework, in this case a feminist theoretical framework.

01:34.480 --> 01:39.720
So the first thing to remember about feminist theory is that it doesn't really share any unifying single point of view.

01:39.980 --> 01:43.400
Even the Mulveian view that like male gaze is a thing.

01:43.400 --> 01:48.880
There's even disagreement on that. A part of the ever-evolving praxis of feminist theory is the exchange of ideas,

01:49.040 --> 01:52.160
usually through essays or books, or now video essays.

01:52.160 --> 01:58.720
I will make this a legitimate academic form alone if I have to. An essayist will present an idea, for instance in this case in

01:58.920 --> 02:04.920
Michael Bay movies, women are rarely depicted as being in positions of power, and when they are in positions of power

02:04.920 --> 02:06.640
they're depicted as either being

02:06.640 --> 02:13.800
duplicitous, incompetent, or both. The writer would then use examples from the media in question and from other academics to help support their thesis.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.540
And that's how you apply feminist theory to a work or a body of work.

02:18.220 --> 02:20.220
It's that easy!

02:20.380 --> 02:21.860
Laura Mulvey's

02:21.860 --> 02:27.220
1975 essay, Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema, is basically ground zero for most feminist media studies,

02:27.220 --> 02:31.620
so we'll start there. The Mulveian view involves a theoretical combination of semiotics,

02:32.140 --> 02:34.640
Altherosian Marxism, and Lacanian psychoanalysis.

02:34.640 --> 02:36.640
I hope that clears up any confusion.

02:36.860 --> 02:44.580
Mulvey saw men as subjects identifying with agents who drive the film's narrative forward, and women as objects for masculine desire and fetishistic gazing.

02:44.580 --> 02:49.860
We'll come back to Mulvey, but consider Mulvey less a holy text so much as a jumping-off point.

02:50.700 --> 02:54.940
Mulvey's essay is also where the term male gaze comes from, and we'll get back to that later.

02:54.940 --> 03:00.260
In essence, the whole of feminist theory as it pertains to media studies is not to destroy all men, though

03:00.260 --> 03:06.180
that is certainly a priority, but to question the role of gender in our society and in particular the portrayal of women in media.

03:06.240 --> 03:12.140
So the rest of this 26-part series will be exploring the many nuances of postmodernist, cultural Marxist, feminist,

03:12.460 --> 03:17.560
intersectional film theory. I'm kidding. I'm kidding! Only 23 of them will be that.

03:19.660 --> 03:21.660
Quick! Define postmodernism!

03:22.540 --> 03:26.940
Yeah, me neither. I see a lot of antipathy towards the term postmodernism, which is

03:27.540 --> 03:34.740
pretty odd to me, because postmodernism doesn't really stand for anything except for a really broad line of thinking that

03:34.820 --> 03:39.620
questions universal truths. A lot of feminist theory does arise from postmodernist thought,

03:39.820 --> 03:42.900
but what do even postmodernism?

03:44.540 --> 03:51.040
Modernism arose as a philosophical movement in the late 19th and early 20th century as a reaction to the certainty of enlightenment thinking,

03:51.380 --> 03:56.740
especially the idea that there were universal truths. From modernism, we saw the rise of art movements like Dada,

03:57.260 --> 04:00.980
absurdism, pop art, as well as the wide rejection of religious belief.

04:01.620 --> 04:06.580
Postmodernism is an umbrella term for an incredibly broad line of thinking that I won't go into any depth with right now.

04:06.660 --> 04:11.460
You can expect a full deconstruction of postmodernism and transformers in my upcoming 12-part series

04:11.940 --> 04:15.100
directly beneath the enemy scrotum, coming Christmas 2019.

04:18.500 --> 04:22.220
Postmodernism is really an extension of modernism, especially as the idea of

04:22.460 --> 04:28.060
universalism came back in a big way in America in 1950s, with the rise of objectivism and writers like Ayn Rand.

04:30.300 --> 04:35.500
The 1950s saw a return to almost Victorian ideals of universal truths in strict societal roles,

04:35.820 --> 04:39.420
especially as it pertained to gender, so postmodernism was a reaction to...

04:39.940 --> 04:45.040
that. Postmodernism questions more binarist modes of thinking favored by universalism,

04:45.740 --> 04:47.740
objectivism, and the ideas that there are

04:48.540 --> 04:51.940
universal truths that apply to everything equally always.

04:53.020 --> 04:54.820
It's that easy!

04:54.820 --> 05:02.760
Feminist theory derives from postmodernism in that early feminist theorists looked at societal ideas that were presented about the idea of gender roles and asked,

05:02.760 --> 05:08.400
But why? Why do we take for granted these ostensibly constructed absolute truths?

05:09.240 --> 05:16.920
Postmodernism rests on a rejection of objectivist thinking, especially in the humanities, and the idea that there are no universal truths, and

05:17.440 --> 05:21.120
I can kind of see where that would get frustrating for some people.

05:21.120 --> 05:27.080
So really, with all this talk of mauve and feminist theory and postmodernism and rejection of

05:27.280 --> 05:32.400
objectivism and binarist modes of thinking, what I'm really, really trying to ask

05:33.360 --> 05:35.360
is why have all the robots got to be dudes?

05:39.300 --> 05:46.320
When people think of women and Transformers, the first thing that usually comes to mind is male gaziness and Megan Fox, and we'll get to that.

05:46.320 --> 05:48.320
Oh, we'll get to you, Michaela.

05:49.520 --> 05:53.160
But to start, I want to delve into a much more existential gender question.

05:53.200 --> 05:55.600
Let's talk about the gender of the robots.

05:55.760 --> 06:01.640
Those of you who are new to Transformers fandom might be surprised to learn that the issue of gender is actually a somewhat contentious one.

06:01.640 --> 06:06.000
Or maybe you're not. The issue of gender seems to be a fairly contentious one in general,

06:06.000 --> 06:07.880
even when you don't throw robots into the mix.

06:07.880 --> 06:11.960
But here's the thing. There haven't always, always been female robots in Transformers,

06:11.960 --> 06:18.560
but there have nearly always been female robots in Transformers. We first see them in season two of the G1 cartoon.

06:18.560 --> 06:22.000
Hold it, Ironhide. Ladies first.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.280
Oh, we're sorry, ma'am. Forgot my manners.

06:25.280 --> 06:27.600
FART SOUND

06:27.600 --> 06:35.960
The most famous token girl Autobot, though, was Arcee, who debuted in 1986's The Transformers The Movie, and totally isn't visually based on Princess Leia.

06:35.960 --> 06:41.960
There have been a smattering of girlbots throughout the years, the most well-known before the movies being Blackarachnia from Beast Wars.

06:41.960 --> 06:45.960
But flash forward to the 2007 movie and the question of gender pops up again.

06:45.960 --> 06:49.360
Should they all be coded male, or do we have a girlbot?

06:49.360 --> 06:54.960
Originally, we did have a girlbot. In an earlier version of the film, Arcee was going to be one of the core five Autobots.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
But late in the game, Arcee was replaced with Ironhide.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.200
You feeling lucky, punk?

07:00.200 --> 07:08.800
According to co-writer Bob Orci, I would have liked to see Arcee, but the idea of a female Transformer just needs its own explanation, and there just wasn't going to be enough time.

07:08.800 --> 07:13.080
It would have been like, oh, that's convenient. They're trying to appease women with a pink Transformer.

07:13.080 --> 07:18.080
So rather than have that happen, let's just let it be a straight shot and speak for itself right now.

07:18.080 --> 07:20.080
So we don't need to explain this.

07:20.080 --> 07:22.080
Or this.

07:32.080 --> 07:36.080
But a ladybot would have made audiences go, hmm, I don't know.

07:36.080 --> 07:43.080
I mean, Megatron accidentally etching coordinates to the MacGuffin inside another MacGuffin I'll buy.

07:43.080 --> 07:49.080
A magical glowcube that's the progenitor for all the alien robots that turn into Camaros I'll buy.

07:49.080 --> 07:54.080
But that one of them displays female secondary sex characteristics and is pink?

07:54.080 --> 07:57.080
Hmm, I don't know, man.

07:57.080 --> 08:04.080
I'm gonna have to absorb more of Optimus' robo-pecs and enjoy his deep manly voice while I smoke on this for a little while.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.080
My name is Optimus Prime.

08:06.080 --> 08:11.080
Wouldn't it be more interesting to explore a robot society that exists outside the confines of gender?

08:11.080 --> 08:15.080
Or that explores the purpose of gender in a species that does not reproduce sexually?

08:15.080 --> 08:18.080
And yes, believe it or not, some Transformers fiction does get into that.

08:18.080 --> 08:23.080
The IDW comics are doing some interesting stuff with the idea of gender in a non-sexual society right now.

08:23.080 --> 08:25.080
But the movies are not here for that.

08:30.080 --> 08:36.080
The most common response you hear is that the Transformers are coded male, but they don't really have gender.

08:36.080 --> 08:40.080
To which the postmodernist cultural Marxist communist feminist might reply,

08:40.080 --> 08:44.080
But these Transformers are obviously unambiguously coded male.

08:44.080 --> 08:51.080
How can you say that these characters have no gender when the flesh monkeys, what created them, created them to have such unambiguous masculine traits?

08:51.080 --> 08:53.080
I just wanted to show him my cannons.

08:53.080 --> 08:56.080
And then you remember, this is Michael Bay, and nothing matters.

09:00.080 --> 09:03.080
The question of do Transformers have gender is purely semiotic.

09:03.080 --> 09:06.080
Like all fiction, the answer is a reflection of the audience.

09:06.080 --> 09:09.080
Transformers are fictional characters. They aren't real.

09:09.080 --> 09:12.080
They do or do not have gender if we say so.

09:12.080 --> 09:17.080
But because this is a franchise primarily catering to little boys, the robots are unambiguously coded male.

09:17.080 --> 09:20.080
They have robopecks, they have masculine voices, they use male pronouns.

09:20.080 --> 09:23.080
They reflect a certain version of masculinity.

09:23.080 --> 09:26.080
And that is a part of male gaze.

09:26.080 --> 09:29.080
Male is coded default, any variation from that is an aberration.

09:29.080 --> 09:31.080
And this is not a modern idea.

09:31.080 --> 09:35.080
The very foundations of Western civilization have this undercurrent on the idea of gender.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.080
Eve is an aberrant deviation of Adam.

09:37.080 --> 09:40.080
Pandora is a corrupt aberration variation of man.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.080
Manly manly Optimus Prime is fine.

09:42.080 --> 09:47.080
But hot pink RC is an aberration, requiring an explanation, and we better not go there.

09:47.080 --> 09:50.080
RC did show up in Revenge of the Fallen, sort of.

09:50.080 --> 09:55.080
She seems to be a combiner of some sort, a gestalt of three motorcycles that combines into one ladybot.

09:55.080 --> 09:58.080
She basically has no lines and then dies.

09:58.080 --> 10:01.080
Like Jazz in the first movie, blink and you'll miss it.

10:01.080 --> 10:03.080
Then there's Alice, which...

10:07.080 --> 10:10.080
You know, sometimes I think Michael Bay has issues with women.

10:10.080 --> 10:15.080
And in the fifth movie there's Quintessa, who's not a Transformer but is called the Deceiver.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.080
Which, okay.

10:17.080 --> 10:21.080
But RC is the closest we got to an actual female Transformer in the movies.

10:21.080 --> 10:26.080
And this in an era when there are actually a lot more ladyformers across all areas of Transformers-dom.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.080
It's not just tokenism anymore.

10:28.080 --> 10:30.080
Often there are multiple female Transformers in the same series.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.080
But not in the movies.

10:33.080 --> 10:34.080
Boom.

10:34.080 --> 10:36.080
Hashtag justice for RC.

10:36.080 --> 10:37.080
Hashtag feminism.

10:37.080 --> 10:41.080
Feminine coding in these movies means you're either utterly impotent, like RC,

10:41.080 --> 10:43.080
a horrifying abomination, like Alice,

10:43.080 --> 10:46.080
or a duplicitous controller of minds, like Quintessa.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.080
And we ain't even got to the human womens yet.

10:48.080 --> 10:51.080
Yeah, no, I'm cool with, you know, females working on my engine.

10:51.080 --> 10:56.080
One attitude I see a lot, especially when we talk about big budget action movies and Michael Bay,

10:56.080 --> 11:01.080
is an idea that it's odd to question what we are given in our media,

11:01.080 --> 11:04.080
rather than ask what brought us here in the first place.

11:04.080 --> 11:10.080
The fact that the male robots, clearly coded as male, would be accepted by the audience without question,

11:10.080 --> 11:15.080
but a female robot is regarded as aberrant and begs an explanation,

11:15.080 --> 11:19.080
makes you wonder, why would the filmmakers think that?

11:19.080 --> 11:22.080
And, more importantly, is that true?

11:22.080 --> 11:26.080
Critical Studies is not here to shame you for what you like,

11:26.080 --> 11:29.080
much as it apparently feels that way to some people,

11:29.080 --> 11:33.080
but rather to help give us the tools to question the media we consume

11:33.080 --> 11:35.080
and what it says about the culture that created it.

11:35.080 --> 11:41.080
Questions like, why do we need to gender code a race of robot aliens in order to humanize and relate with them,

11:41.080 --> 11:47.080
but then really never go into what gender would even mean to a race of robot aliens in the first place?

11:47.080 --> 11:49.080
And we ain't even get into Megan Fox yet.

11:49.080 --> 12:03.080
In the arms of Mark Wahlberg, you can crack a beer

12:03.080 --> 12:09.080
With these dark, cold transformers

12:09.080 --> 12:15.080
And the female bots that you fear

12:16.080 --> 12:21.080
You are pulled into wreckage

12:21.080 --> 12:25.080
By the mayhem's fear of
