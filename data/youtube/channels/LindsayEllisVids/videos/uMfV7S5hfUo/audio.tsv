0	3300	Boy, oh boy, so this is the one that everyone's been looking forward to.
3300	7620	I'm sure Tom talked about some feminist theory on YouTube. That always goes over well.
7720	10440	Yeah, this is gonna be an interesting topic because I feel like, you know,
10440	15220	most of you kind of have like at least a passing knowledge of how, like, feminist film theory works.
15220	21940	And then there's the segment of the audience that thinks it's like the matriarchal tentacle of the globalist new world order to destroy all men.
22280	24920	So that's gonna be an interesting tightrope to walk.
25880	28080	Glad I chose Transformers to do it!
28080	35080	I don't play. I don't play. I don't play. I don't play.
35160	38820	So ignoring the part where the internet has lost its mind over the last few years,
39240	43960	feminist theory has been an integral part of critical studies for decades. And while for the sake of simplicity
43960	51640	I would like to be able to separate feminist academia from the wide wide world of feminist hot takes on the internet,
52080	54080	the truth is I can't because
54880	60480	feminist academia is kind of influenced by the wide wide world of feminist hot takes on the internet and vice versa.
60840	65440	Which leads to a lot of confusion, and I'm not really going to try to untangle that right now,
65440	69280	but I see a lot of buzzwords being thrown around as sort of
69800	73900	boogeyman with little regard to what the terms actually mean. Terms like
74640	76640	feminism, post-modernism,
77560	81920	Marxism, Freudian psychoanalysis, the Jews, and so on.
81920	87000	But the important thing to remember about any kind of theory is that while yeah, it usually has some kind of an agenda,
87000	89160	it's really more about putting
89740	94480	some element of culture within a framework, in this case a feminist theoretical framework.
94480	99720	So the first thing to remember about feminist theory is that it doesn't really share any unifying single point of view.
99980	103400	Even the Mulveian view that like male gaze is a thing.
103400	108880	There's even disagreement on that. A part of the ever-evolving praxis of feminist theory is the exchange of ideas,
109040	112160	usually through essays or books, or now video essays.
112160	118720	I will make this a legitimate academic form alone if I have to. An essayist will present an idea, for instance in this case in
118920	124920	Michael Bay movies, women are rarely depicted as being in positions of power, and when they are in positions of power
124920	126640	they're depicted as either being
126640	133800	duplicitous, incompetent, or both. The writer would then use examples from the media in question and from other academics to help support their thesis.
133800	137540	And that's how you apply feminist theory to a work or a body of work.
138220	140220	It's that easy!
140380	141860	Laura Mulvey's
141860	147220	1975 essay, Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema, is basically ground zero for most feminist media studies,
147220	151620	so we'll start there. The Mulveian view involves a theoretical combination of semiotics,
152140	154640	Altherosian Marxism, and Lacanian psychoanalysis.
154640	156640	I hope that clears up any confusion.
156860	164580	Mulvey saw men as subjects identifying with agents who drive the film's narrative forward, and women as objects for masculine desire and fetishistic gazing.
164580	169860	We'll come back to Mulvey, but consider Mulvey less a holy text so much as a jumping-off point.
170700	174940	Mulvey's essay is also where the term male gaze comes from, and we'll get back to that later.
174940	180260	In essence, the whole of feminist theory as it pertains to media studies is not to destroy all men, though
180260	186180	that is certainly a priority, but to question the role of gender in our society and in particular the portrayal of women in media.
186240	192140	So the rest of this 26-part series will be exploring the many nuances of postmodernist, cultural Marxist, feminist,
192460	197560	intersectional film theory. I'm kidding. I'm kidding! Only 23 of them will be that.
199660	201660	Quick! Define postmodernism!
202540	206940	Yeah, me neither. I see a lot of antipathy towards the term postmodernism, which is
207540	214740	pretty odd to me, because postmodernism doesn't really stand for anything except for a really broad line of thinking that
214820	219620	questions universal truths. A lot of feminist theory does arise from postmodernist thought,
219820	222900	but what do even postmodernism?
224540	231040	Modernism arose as a philosophical movement in the late 19th and early 20th century as a reaction to the certainty of enlightenment thinking,
231380	236740	especially the idea that there were universal truths. From modernism, we saw the rise of art movements like Dada,
237260	240980	absurdism, pop art, as well as the wide rejection of religious belief.
241620	246580	Postmodernism is an umbrella term for an incredibly broad line of thinking that I won't go into any depth with right now.
246660	251460	You can expect a full deconstruction of postmodernism and transformers in my upcoming 12-part series
251940	255100	directly beneath the enemy scrotum, coming Christmas 2019.
258500	262220	Postmodernism is really an extension of modernism, especially as the idea of
262460	268060	universalism came back in a big way in America in 1950s, with the rise of objectivism and writers like Ayn Rand.
270300	275500	The 1950s saw a return to almost Victorian ideals of universal truths in strict societal roles,
275820	279420	especially as it pertained to gender, so postmodernism was a reaction to...
279940	285040	that. Postmodernism questions more binarist modes of thinking favored by universalism,
285740	287740	objectivism, and the ideas that there are
288540	291940	universal truths that apply to everything equally always.
293020	294820	It's that easy!
294820	302760	Feminist theory derives from postmodernism in that early feminist theorists looked at societal ideas that were presented about the idea of gender roles and asked,
302760	308400	But why? Why do we take for granted these ostensibly constructed absolute truths?
309240	316920	Postmodernism rests on a rejection of objectivist thinking, especially in the humanities, and the idea that there are no universal truths, and
317440	321120	I can kind of see where that would get frustrating for some people.
321120	327080	So really, with all this talk of mauve and feminist theory and postmodernism and rejection of
327280	332400	objectivism and binarist modes of thinking, what I'm really, really trying to ask
333360	335360	is why have all the robots got to be dudes?
339300	346320	When people think of women and Transformers, the first thing that usually comes to mind is male gaziness and Megan Fox, and we'll get to that.
346320	348320	Oh, we'll get to you, Michaela.
349520	353160	But to start, I want to delve into a much more existential gender question.
353200	355600	Let's talk about the gender of the robots.
355760	361640	Those of you who are new to Transformers fandom might be surprised to learn that the issue of gender is actually a somewhat contentious one.
361640	366000	Or maybe you're not. The issue of gender seems to be a fairly contentious one in general,
366000	367880	even when you don't throw robots into the mix.
367880	371960	But here's the thing. There haven't always, always been female robots in Transformers,
371960	378560	but there have nearly always been female robots in Transformers. We first see them in season two of the G1 cartoon.
378560	382000	Hold it, Ironhide. Ladies first.
382000	385280	Oh, we're sorry, ma'am. Forgot my manners.
385280	387600	FART SOUND
387600	395960	The most famous token girl Autobot, though, was Arcee, who debuted in 1986's The Transformers The Movie, and totally isn't visually based on Princess Leia.
395960	401960	There have been a smattering of girlbots throughout the years, the most well-known before the movies being Blackarachnia from Beast Wars.
401960	405960	But flash forward to the 2007 movie and the question of gender pops up again.
405960	409360	Should they all be coded male, or do we have a girlbot?
409360	414960	Originally, we did have a girlbot. In an earlier version of the film, Arcee was going to be one of the core five Autobots.
415000	418000	But late in the game, Arcee was replaced with Ironhide.
418000	420200	You feeling lucky, punk?
420200	428800	According to co-writer Bob Orci, I would have liked to see Arcee, but the idea of a female Transformer just needs its own explanation, and there just wasn't going to be enough time.
428800	433080	It would have been like, oh, that's convenient. They're trying to appease women with a pink Transformer.
433080	438080	So rather than have that happen, let's just let it be a straight shot and speak for itself right now.
438080	440080	So we don't need to explain this.
440080	442080	Or this.
452080	456080	But a ladybot would have made audiences go, hmm, I don't know.
456080	463080	I mean, Megatron accidentally etching coordinates to the MacGuffin inside another MacGuffin I'll buy.
463080	469080	A magical glowcube that's the progenitor for all the alien robots that turn into Camaros I'll buy.
469080	474080	But that one of them displays female secondary sex characteristics and is pink?
474080	477080	Hmm, I don't know, man.
477080	484080	I'm gonna have to absorb more of Optimus' robo-pecs and enjoy his deep manly voice while I smoke on this for a little while.
484080	486080	My name is Optimus Prime.
486080	491080	Wouldn't it be more interesting to explore a robot society that exists outside the confines of gender?
491080	495080	Or that explores the purpose of gender in a species that does not reproduce sexually?
495080	498080	And yes, believe it or not, some Transformers fiction does get into that.
498080	503080	The IDW comics are doing some interesting stuff with the idea of gender in a non-sexual society right now.
503080	505080	But the movies are not here for that.
510080	516080	The most common response you hear is that the Transformers are coded male, but they don't really have gender.
516080	520080	To which the postmodernist cultural Marxist communist feminist might reply,
520080	524080	But these Transformers are obviously unambiguously coded male.
524080	531080	How can you say that these characters have no gender when the flesh monkeys, what created them, created them to have such unambiguous masculine traits?
531080	533080	I just wanted to show him my cannons.
533080	536080	And then you remember, this is Michael Bay, and nothing matters.
540080	543080	The question of do Transformers have gender is purely semiotic.
543080	546080	Like all fiction, the answer is a reflection of the audience.
546080	549080	Transformers are fictional characters. They aren't real.
549080	552080	They do or do not have gender if we say so.
552080	557080	But because this is a franchise primarily catering to little boys, the robots are unambiguously coded male.
557080	560080	They have robopecks, they have masculine voices, they use male pronouns.
560080	563080	They reflect a certain version of masculinity.
563080	566080	And that is a part of male gaze.
566080	569080	Male is coded default, any variation from that is an aberration.
569080	571080	And this is not a modern idea.
571080	575080	The very foundations of Western civilization have this undercurrent on the idea of gender.
575080	577080	Eve is an aberrant deviation of Adam.
577080	580080	Pandora is a corrupt aberration variation of man.
580080	582080	Manly manly Optimus Prime is fine.
582080	587080	But hot pink RC is an aberration, requiring an explanation, and we better not go there.
587080	590080	RC did show up in Revenge of the Fallen, sort of.
590080	595080	She seems to be a combiner of some sort, a gestalt of three motorcycles that combines into one ladybot.
595080	598080	She basically has no lines and then dies.
598080	601080	Like Jazz in the first movie, blink and you'll miss it.
601080	603080	Then there's Alice, which...
607080	610080	You know, sometimes I think Michael Bay has issues with women.
610080	615080	And in the fifth movie there's Quintessa, who's not a Transformer but is called the Deceiver.
615080	617080	Which, okay.
617080	621080	But RC is the closest we got to an actual female Transformer in the movies.
621080	626080	And this in an era when there are actually a lot more ladyformers across all areas of Transformers-dom.
626080	628080	It's not just tokenism anymore.
628080	630080	Often there are multiple female Transformers in the same series.
630080	632080	But not in the movies.
633080	634080	Boom.
634080	636080	Hashtag justice for RC.
636080	637080	Hashtag feminism.
637080	641080	Feminine coding in these movies means you're either utterly impotent, like RC,
641080	643080	a horrifying abomination, like Alice,
643080	646080	or a duplicitous controller of minds, like Quintessa.
646080	648080	And we ain't even got to the human womens yet.
648080	651080	Yeah, no, I'm cool with, you know, females working on my engine.
651080	656080	One attitude I see a lot, especially when we talk about big budget action movies and Michael Bay,
656080	661080	is an idea that it's odd to question what we are given in our media,
661080	664080	rather than ask what brought us here in the first place.
664080	670080	The fact that the male robots, clearly coded as male, would be accepted by the audience without question,
670080	675080	but a female robot is regarded as aberrant and begs an explanation,
675080	679080	makes you wonder, why would the filmmakers think that?
679080	682080	And, more importantly, is that true?
682080	686080	Critical Studies is not here to shame you for what you like,
686080	689080	much as it apparently feels that way to some people,
689080	693080	but rather to help give us the tools to question the media we consume
693080	695080	and what it says about the culture that created it.
695080	701080	Questions like, why do we need to gender code a race of robot aliens in order to humanize and relate with them,
701080	707080	but then really never go into what gender would even mean to a race of robot aliens in the first place?
707080	709080	And we ain't even get into Megan Fox yet.
709080	723080	In the arms of Mark Wahlberg, you can crack a beer
723080	729080	With these dark, cold transformers
729080	735080	And the female bots that you fear
736080	741080	You are pulled into wreckage
741080	745080	By the mayhem's fear of
