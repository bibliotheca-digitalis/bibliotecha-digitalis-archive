1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
Boy, oh boy, so this is the one that everyone's been looking forward to.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,620
I'm sure Tom talked about some feminist theory on YouTube. That always goes over well.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,440
Yeah, this is gonna be an interesting topic because I feel like, you know,

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,220
most of you kind of have like at least a passing knowledge of how, like, feminist film theory works.

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:21,940
And then there's the segment of the audience that thinks it's like the matriarchal tentacle of the globalist new world order to destroy all men.

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,920
So that's gonna be an interesting tightrope to walk.

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,080
Glad I chose Transformers to do it!

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:35,080
I don't play. I don't play. I don't play. I don't play.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,820
So ignoring the part where the internet has lost its mind over the last few years,

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,960
feminist theory has been an integral part of critical studies for decades. And while for the sake of simplicity

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:51,640
I would like to be able to separate feminist academia from the wide wide world of feminist hot takes on the internet,

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,080
the truth is I can't because

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,480
feminist academia is kind of influenced by the wide wide world of feminist hot takes on the internet and vice versa.

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,440
Which leads to a lot of confusion, and I'm not really going to try to untangle that right now,

15
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,280
but I see a lot of buzzwords being thrown around as sort of

16
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,900
boogeyman with little regard to what the terms actually mean. Terms like

17
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,640
feminism, post-modernism,

18
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,920
Marxism, Freudian psychoanalysis, the Jews, and so on.

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,000
But the important thing to remember about any kind of theory is that while yeah, it usually has some kind of an agenda,

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,160
it's really more about putting

21
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,480
some element of culture within a framework, in this case a feminist theoretical framework.

22
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,720
So the first thing to remember about feminist theory is that it doesn't really share any unifying single point of view.

23
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,400
Even the Mulveian view that like male gaze is a thing.

24
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,880
There's even disagreement on that. A part of the ever-evolving praxis of feminist theory is the exchange of ideas,

25
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,160
usually through essays or books, or now video essays.

26
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:58,720
I will make this a legitimate academic form alone if I have to. An essayist will present an idea, for instance in this case in

27
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,920
Michael Bay movies, women are rarely depicted as being in positions of power, and when they are in positions of power

28
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,640
they're depicted as either being

29
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:13,800
duplicitous, incompetent, or both. The writer would then use examples from the media in question and from other academics to help support their thesis.

30
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,540
And that's how you apply feminist theory to a work or a body of work.

31
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,220
It's that easy!

32
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,860
Laura Mulvey's

33
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:27,220
1975 essay, Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema, is basically ground zero for most feminist media studies,

34
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,620
so we'll start there. The Mulveian view involves a theoretical combination of semiotics,

35
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,640
Altherosian Marxism, and Lacanian psychoanalysis.

36
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,640
I hope that clears up any confusion.

37
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:44,580
Mulvey saw men as subjects identifying with agents who drive the film's narrative forward, and women as objects for masculine desire and fetishistic gazing.

38
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,860
We'll come back to Mulvey, but consider Mulvey less a holy text so much as a jumping-off point.

39
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,940
Mulvey's essay is also where the term male gaze comes from, and we'll get back to that later.

40
00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:00,260
In essence, the whole of feminist theory as it pertains to media studies is not to destroy all men, though

41
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:06,180
that is certainly a priority, but to question the role of gender in our society and in particular the portrayal of women in media.

42
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:12,140
So the rest of this 26-part series will be exploring the many nuances of postmodernist, cultural Marxist, feminist,

43
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:17,560
intersectional film theory. I'm kidding. I'm kidding! Only 23 of them will be that.

44
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,660
Quick! Define postmodernism!

45
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,940
Yeah, me neither. I see a lot of antipathy towards the term postmodernism, which is

46
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:34,740
pretty odd to me, because postmodernism doesn't really stand for anything except for a really broad line of thinking that

47
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:39,620
questions universal truths. A lot of feminist theory does arise from postmodernist thought,

48
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,900
but what do even postmodernism?

49
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:51,040
Modernism arose as a philosophical movement in the late 19th and early 20th century as a reaction to the certainty of enlightenment thinking,

50
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:56,740
especially the idea that there were universal truths. From modernism, we saw the rise of art movements like Dada,

51
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,980
absurdism, pop art, as well as the wide rejection of religious belief.

52
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,580
Postmodernism is an umbrella term for an incredibly broad line of thinking that I won't go into any depth with right now.

53
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,460
You can expect a full deconstruction of postmodernism and transformers in my upcoming 12-part series

54
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,100
directly beneath the enemy scrotum, coming Christmas 2019.

55
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,220
Postmodernism is really an extension of modernism, especially as the idea of

56
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:28,060
universalism came back in a big way in America in 1950s, with the rise of objectivism and writers like Ayn Rand.

57
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,500
The 1950s saw a return to almost Victorian ideals of universal truths in strict societal roles,

58
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,420
especially as it pertained to gender, so postmodernism was a reaction to...

59
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:45,040
that. Postmodernism questions more binarist modes of thinking favored by universalism,

60
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,740
objectivism, and the ideas that there are

61
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,940
universal truths that apply to everything equally always.

62
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,820
It's that easy!

63
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:02,760
Feminist theory derives from postmodernism in that early feminist theorists looked at societal ideas that were presented about the idea of gender roles and asked,

64
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:08,400
But why? Why do we take for granted these ostensibly constructed absolute truths?

65
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:16,920
Postmodernism rests on a rejection of objectivist thinking, especially in the humanities, and the idea that there are no universal truths, and

66
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,120
I can kind of see where that would get frustrating for some people.

67
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,080
So really, with all this talk of mauve and feminist theory and postmodernism and rejection of

68
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,400
objectivism and binarist modes of thinking, what I'm really, really trying to ask

69
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
is why have all the robots got to be dudes?

70
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:46,320
When people think of women and Transformers, the first thing that usually comes to mind is male gaziness and Megan Fox, and we'll get to that.

71
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Oh, we'll get to you, Michaela.

72
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,160
But to start, I want to delve into a much more existential gender question.

73
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,600
Let's talk about the gender of the robots.

74
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,640
Those of you who are new to Transformers fandom might be surprised to learn that the issue of gender is actually a somewhat contentious one.

75
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:06,000
Or maybe you're not. The issue of gender seems to be a fairly contentious one in general,

76
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,880
even when you don't throw robots into the mix.

77
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,960
But here's the thing. There haven't always, always been female robots in Transformers,

78
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:18,560
but there have nearly always been female robots in Transformers. We first see them in season two of the G1 cartoon.

79
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,000
Hold it, Ironhide. Ladies first.

80
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,280
Oh, we're sorry, ma'am. Forgot my manners.

81
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,600
FART SOUND

82
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:35,960
The most famous token girl Autobot, though, was Arcee, who debuted in 1986's The Transformers The Movie, and totally isn't visually based on Princess Leia.

83
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,960
There have been a smattering of girlbots throughout the years, the most well-known before the movies being Blackarachnia from Beast Wars.

84
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,960
But flash forward to the 2007 movie and the question of gender pops up again.

85
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,360
Should they all be coded male, or do we have a girlbot?

86
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,960
Originally, we did have a girlbot. In an earlier version of the film, Arcee was going to be one of the core five Autobots.

87
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But late in the game, Arcee was replaced with Ironhide.

88
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,200
You feeling lucky, punk?

89
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:08,800
According to co-writer Bob Orci, I would have liked to see Arcee, but the idea of a female Transformer just needs its own explanation, and there just wasn't going to be enough time.

90
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,080
It would have been like, oh, that's convenient. They're trying to appease women with a pink Transformer.

91
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,080
So rather than have that happen, let's just let it be a straight shot and speak for itself right now.

92
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
So we don't need to explain this.

93
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,080
Or this.

94
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,080
But a ladybot would have made audiences go, hmm, I don't know.

95
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:43,080
I mean, Megatron accidentally etching coordinates to the MacGuffin inside another MacGuffin I'll buy.

96
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:49,080
A magical glowcube that's the progenitor for all the alien robots that turn into Camaros I'll buy.

97
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:54,080
But that one of them displays female secondary sex characteristics and is pink?

98
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,080
Hmm, I don't know, man.

99
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:04,080
I'm gonna have to absorb more of Optimus' robo-pecs and enjoy his deep manly voice while I smoke on this for a little while.

100
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
My name is Optimus Prime.

101
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,080
Wouldn't it be more interesting to explore a robot society that exists outside the confines of gender?

102
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,080
Or that explores the purpose of gender in a species that does not reproduce sexually?

103
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,080
And yes, believe it or not, some Transformers fiction does get into that.

104
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,080
The IDW comics are doing some interesting stuff with the idea of gender in a non-sexual society right now.

105
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,080
But the movies are not here for that.

106
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:36,080
The most common response you hear is that the Transformers are coded male, but they don't really have gender.

107
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,080
To which the postmodernist cultural Marxist communist feminist might reply,

108
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,080
But these Transformers are obviously unambiguously coded male.

109
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:51,080
How can you say that these characters have no gender when the flesh monkeys, what created them, created them to have such unambiguous masculine traits?

110
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,080
I just wanted to show him my cannons.

111
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,080
And then you remember, this is Michael Bay, and nothing matters.

112
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,080
The question of do Transformers have gender is purely semiotic.

113
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,080
Like all fiction, the answer is a reflection of the audience.

114
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,080
Transformers are fictional characters. They aren't real.

115
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,080
They do or do not have gender if we say so.

116
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,080
But because this is a franchise primarily catering to little boys, the robots are unambiguously coded male.

117
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,080
They have robopecks, they have masculine voices, they use male pronouns.

118
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,080
They reflect a certain version of masculinity.

119
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,080
And that is a part of male gaze.

120
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,080
Male is coded default, any variation from that is an aberration.

121
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,080
And this is not a modern idea.

122
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,080
The very foundations of Western civilization have this undercurrent on the idea of gender.

123
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,080
Eve is an aberrant deviation of Adam.

124
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,080
Pandora is a corrupt aberration variation of man.

125
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,080
Manly manly Optimus Prime is fine.

126
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,080
But hot pink RC is an aberration, requiring an explanation, and we better not go there.

127
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,080
RC did show up in Revenge of the Fallen, sort of.

128
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,080
She seems to be a combiner of some sort, a gestalt of three motorcycles that combines into one ladybot.

129
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,080
She basically has no lines and then dies.

130
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,080
Like Jazz in the first movie, blink and you'll miss it.

131
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,080
Then there's Alice, which...

132
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,080
You know, sometimes I think Michael Bay has issues with women.

133
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,080
And in the fifth movie there's Quintessa, who's not a Transformer but is called the Deceiver.

134
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,080
Which, okay.

135
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,080
But RC is the closest we got to an actual female Transformer in the movies.

136
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:26,080
And this in an era when there are actually a lot more ladyformers across all areas of Transformers-dom.

137
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,080
It's not just tokenism anymore.

138
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,080
Often there are multiple female Transformers in the same series.

139
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,080
But not in the movies.

140
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,080
Boom.

141
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,080
Hashtag justice for RC.

142
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,080
Hashtag feminism.

143
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,080
Feminine coding in these movies means you're either utterly impotent, like RC,

144
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,080
a horrifying abomination, like Alice,

145
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,080
or a duplicitous controller of minds, like Quintessa.

146
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,080
And we ain't even got to the human womens yet.

147
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,080
Yeah, no, I'm cool with, you know, females working on my engine.

148
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:56,080
One attitude I see a lot, especially when we talk about big budget action movies and Michael Bay,

149
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,080
is an idea that it's odd to question what we are given in our media,

150
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,080
rather than ask what brought us here in the first place.

151
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:10,080
The fact that the male robots, clearly coded as male, would be accepted by the audience without question,

152
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,080
but a female robot is regarded as aberrant and begs an explanation,

153
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,080
makes you wonder, why would the filmmakers think that?

154
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,080
And, more importantly, is that true?

155

Critical Studies is not here to shame you for what you like,

156
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,080
