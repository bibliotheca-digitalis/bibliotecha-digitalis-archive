WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.520
Thank you, Buford.

00:01.520 --> 00:02.400
Well, hello.

00:02.400 --> 00:05.240
It is time for a hot take,

00:05.240 --> 00:08.200
and I think it is simply that

00:08.200 --> 00:11.120
Titanic is good, actually.

00:11.120 --> 00:14.240
James Cameron is a very specific type of genius

00:14.240 --> 00:17.040
that all nerds kind of wish they were,

00:17.040 --> 00:19.080
and I imagine that is why so many people

00:19.080 --> 00:20.680
are so eager to hate this guy,

00:20.680 --> 00:22.620
and not just because of his not-so-secret reputation

00:22.620 --> 00:24.120
of being a tremendous asshole.

00:26.080 --> 00:28.880
And I'm going to demonstrate this particular brand of genius

00:28.920 --> 00:32.040
by drawing a comparison to, of course,

00:32.040 --> 00:32.880
what else?

00:34.360 --> 00:35.240
Phantom of the Opera.

00:35.240 --> 00:36.080
No, no, please don't leave.

00:36.080 --> 00:37.800
I swear this isn't a bait-and-switch about Phantom.

00:37.800 --> 00:38.640
I'll keep it short.

00:38.640 --> 00:40.640
A good production of Phantom of the Opera

00:40.640 --> 00:43.000
will have you responding to the actors,

00:43.000 --> 00:45.400
as is the case with the 25th anniversary cast,

00:45.400 --> 00:46.800
and the chemistry between the actors

00:46.800 --> 00:48.840
nearly sucking their souls out of each other's bodies

00:48.840 --> 00:50.760
from the sheer intensity of it,

00:50.760 --> 00:52.880
more than the flashy set pieces.

00:52.880 --> 00:54.880
This lies in contrast with the most recent

00:54.880 --> 00:57.120
and umpteenth time I saw Phantom on Broadway

00:57.120 --> 00:58.920
earlier this year for my podcast,

00:58.920 --> 01:02.760
where the cast was so lacking in everything

01:02.760 --> 01:05.240
that the biggest reaction slash applause from the audience

01:05.240 --> 01:07.800
were for the set pieces, not for the actors.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.720
The audience applauded for the chandelier,

01:09.720 --> 01:11.520
they applauded for some of the stunts

01:11.520 --> 01:13.600
and the badly-aged pyrotechnics,

01:13.600 --> 01:14.440
but for the actors,

01:14.440 --> 01:17.440
it was more of an applause of obligation, if at all.

01:17.440 --> 01:20.160
In fact, there was hardly even a standing ovation,

01:20.160 --> 01:22.320
and I never see begrudging standing ovations

01:22.320 --> 01:25.040
at Broadway shows anymore, at least in the before time.

01:25.040 --> 01:26.820
And if they enjoyed the spectacle,

01:26.820 --> 01:29.020
that's fine, that's whatever,

01:29.020 --> 01:31.500
but if they didn't connect with the actors,

01:31.500 --> 01:33.540
if they didn't connect with the performers,

01:33.540 --> 01:36.820
then that's not going to make the thing stick with people.

01:36.820 --> 01:38.700
Which brings us to Titanic,

01:38.700 --> 01:41.540
a film so wrapped up in spectacle,

01:41.540 --> 01:43.700
it's kind of hard to imagine that James Cameron

01:43.700 --> 01:47.500
had any room in his brain for anything but spectacle.

01:47.500 --> 01:48.860
But people came for the spectacle,

01:48.860 --> 01:51.100
they did not stay for the spectacle,

01:51.100 --> 01:55.420
they stayed for the story, the characters,

01:55.420 --> 01:58.700
the je ne sais quoi, the iconic love story.

01:59.980 --> 02:01.140
This requires skill.

02:01.140 --> 02:02.580
And it is iconic.

02:02.580 --> 02:05.500
The film still lives strong in our lexicon,

02:05.500 --> 02:07.100
the meme's immortal.

02:07.100 --> 02:12.100
Kate Winslet, DiCaprio, perfectly fine.

02:12.580 --> 02:14.460
We have no choice but to stand.

02:14.460 --> 02:15.860
Compare Titanic to Avatar,

02:15.860 --> 02:17.780
which despite what the Walt Disney Company

02:17.780 --> 02:18.980
would have you believe.

02:18.980 --> 02:21.300
Now everyone, including me,

02:21.300 --> 02:24.500
who has ever dreamed of visiting this extraordinary world,

02:24.500 --> 02:26.780
can explore its astonishing landscape.

02:26.780 --> 02:29.140
Usually, Sudlucid's a lukewarm meh

02:29.140 --> 02:30.940
from people when you bring it up,

02:30.940 --> 02:32.180
except for dads.

02:33.780 --> 02:36.180
Maybe they remember like the special effects

02:36.180 --> 02:39.260
or the 3D or Bill Wellington,

02:39.260 --> 02:41.220
Chris Cumberbatch, you know,

02:41.220 --> 02:43.900
that guy that was in the movies in 2010.

02:43.900 --> 02:46.540
But there's not much memorable about the story itself.

02:46.540 --> 02:48.100
When people think about Avatar,

02:48.100 --> 02:50.740
they think of the technology upon which it was hyped.

02:50.740 --> 02:53.340
And then they probably make a blue Pocahontas joke.

02:53.380 --> 02:54.540
There are those who are kind of

02:54.540 --> 02:55.980
into the world-building elements,

02:55.980 --> 02:59.020
I think, I can't tell how ironic this is,

02:59.020 --> 03:00.100
and I actually know her.

03:00.100 --> 03:01.460
But no one is terribly invested

03:01.460 --> 03:04.100
in the story of Jake, Sully, and Neytiri.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.900
But with Cameron, up until his slip

03:05.900 --> 03:07.940
really started to show with Avatar,

03:07.940 --> 03:12.740
he was very good at balancing spectacle with story,

03:12.740 --> 03:16.740
but up until Titanic, usually giving the edge to spectacle,

03:16.740 --> 03:19.620
because that seemed to be more where his interests lie.

03:19.620 --> 03:20.660
In the case of Titanic,

03:20.660 --> 03:23.700
it was the biggest spectacle in cinematic history.

03:23.700 --> 03:27.060
But at the end of the day, the story is what remains.

03:27.060 --> 03:29.020
It is what sticks with people.

03:29.020 --> 03:30.300
Cameron has done this before

03:30.300 --> 03:32.020
by turning his love of deep-sea diving

03:32.020 --> 03:34.580
into the 1989 film, The Abyss.

03:34.580 --> 03:37.620
A lesser-known Cameron joined about deep-sea aliens,

03:37.620 --> 03:39.700
but that fixation on deep-sea diving leapfrogged

03:39.700 --> 03:40.780
eventually into a fixation

03:40.780 --> 03:43.940
on the newly rediscovered Titanic in the 1990s.

03:43.940 --> 03:46.220
Cameron spent a ton of his own fortune

03:46.220 --> 03:47.700
on diving in Titanic stuff.

03:47.700 --> 03:50.420
And, you know, I've always been interested in the ocean.

03:50.420 --> 03:52.140
So there's a certain transition point

03:52.140 --> 03:54.420
where I realized I was heading toward

03:54.420 --> 03:56.500
making a film on that subject.

03:56.500 --> 03:59.380
And before long, like so many YouTubers after him,

03:59.380 --> 04:01.220
he looked at his greatest interest and thought,

04:01.220 --> 04:03.860
hey, I could monetize this.

04:03.860 --> 04:06.020
Turn down for what?

04:06.020 --> 04:07.700
And so monetize it he did,

04:07.700 --> 04:09.820
with one of the most expensive, remarkable,

04:09.820 --> 04:13.140
and memorable movies of all time, Titanic.

04:13.140 --> 04:16.100
I'm the king of the world!

04:16.580 --> 04:18.540
Whoa!

04:23.540 --> 04:25.100
But the remarkable thing about Titanic

04:25.100 --> 04:26.820
within the Cameron canon,

04:26.820 --> 04:28.140
the first thing that people think about

04:28.140 --> 04:31.380
is not the spectacle, a la the Alien Queen in Aliens

04:31.380 --> 04:34.180
or the T-1000 in Terminator 2,

04:34.180 --> 04:35.540
but for better or worse,

04:35.540 --> 04:37.860
it is the characters, the story.

04:37.860 --> 04:40.900
They think about, draw me like one of your French girls.

04:40.900 --> 04:43.380
They think about, I'm flying.

04:43.580 --> 04:47.260
They think about, I'm the king of the world.

04:47.260 --> 04:50.140
About, it's been 84 years.

04:50.140 --> 04:51.780
They think of putting the diamond in the coat

04:51.780 --> 04:53.260
and putting the coat on her.

04:53.260 --> 04:57.500
The story still trumps the spectacle in the cultural canon,

04:57.500 --> 04:58.780
which is why it's so odd to me

04:58.780 --> 05:00.780
that creeping up on a quarter century later,

05:00.780 --> 05:02.860
there are so many people still insisting

05:02.860 --> 05:06.420
that Titanic is bad, actually.

05:06.420 --> 05:07.780
But I'm not just here to argue

05:07.780 --> 05:10.020
that Titanic is good, actually.

05:10.020 --> 05:13.940
Oh no, I am here to argue that Titanic is actually

05:13.940 --> 05:16.260
one of the greatest cinematic achievements in history,

05:16.260 --> 05:19.140
that it did deserve all of the awards and acclaim.

05:19.140 --> 05:20.820
And no, it did not deserve

05:20.820 --> 05:23.340
that big, dumb, stupid, giant backlash,

05:23.340 --> 05:26.860
one of the biggest ever and one of the most influential.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.340
A backlash so fierce that never again

05:29.340 --> 05:31.700
would the popular thing be allowed

05:31.700 --> 05:34.740
in the same paddock with the high art thing.

05:34.740 --> 05:37.260
No Best Picture nomination for you, Dark Knight.

05:37.260 --> 05:40.380
A segregation of pop art and high art so severe

05:40.380 --> 05:42.580
that the Academy eventually had to expand

05:42.580 --> 05:46.100
the Best Picture category back out to 10 nominations

05:46.100 --> 05:48.020
because could we please get

05:48.020 --> 05:50.700
some popular stuff nominated again?

05:50.700 --> 05:51.540
Please.

05:51.540 --> 05:55.060
So following in the footsteps of those intrepid divers

05:55.060 --> 05:57.700
alongside James Cameron who rediscovered

05:57.700 --> 05:59.140
the wreckage of the great ship,

05:59.140 --> 06:04.060
I am here to dive down and rescue Titanic's reputation

06:04.060 --> 06:07.020
as a cinematic great before it gets eaten

06:07.020 --> 06:11.500
by the iron-eaten bacteria

06:11.500 --> 06:14.820
of this incredibly mixed metaphor.

06:18.380 --> 06:22.180
♪♪

06:22.180 --> 06:24.420
Titanic is one of those movies that,

06:24.420 --> 06:26.500
when I feel like people try to articulate

06:26.500 --> 06:28.180
what they don't like about it,

06:28.180 --> 06:31.260
they tend to be grasping at straws

06:31.260 --> 06:33.500
or declaring certain elements to be subpar

06:34.060 --> 06:35.860
when I'm like, am I missing something?

06:35.860 --> 06:36.900
Did we watch the same movie?

06:36.900 --> 06:37.980
This is fine.

06:37.980 --> 06:40.420
Like Leonardo DiCaprio's acting, for instance.

06:40.420 --> 06:43.140
It's a perfectly fine use of your DiCaprio.

06:43.140 --> 06:45.020
With all due respect, miss,

06:45.020 --> 06:47.100
I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship here.

06:47.100 --> 06:50.140
We know what bad DiCaprio looks like.

06:50.140 --> 06:52.060
And your love has meant nothing to either of us.

06:52.060 --> 06:53.780
No, no!

06:53.780 --> 06:54.620
Watch them!

06:54.620 --> 06:57.500
First of all, my own brother's trying to do this to me!

06:57.500 --> 06:58.900
Surrender now!

06:58.900 --> 06:59.740
No!

07:00.060 --> 07:01.820
Wear it until you love it!

07:01.820 --> 07:03.500
This is not bad DiCaprio.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.260
The basis of most of the criticisms

07:05.260 --> 07:08.740
seems to be based on story is simple

07:08.740 --> 07:10.740
or characters are simple

07:10.740 --> 07:13.020
or wow, such melodrama.

07:13.020 --> 07:15.220
But that said, Titanic is about as complex

07:15.220 --> 07:17.500
as any other mass-appealed blockbuster.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.380
Neither its characters nor its writing

07:19.380 --> 07:22.100
are remarkable in this regard compared to other movies.

07:22.100 --> 07:23.220
Same with the characters.

07:23.220 --> 07:25.900
Are you of the Boston Dawsons?

07:25.900 --> 07:27.940
No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons.

07:28.060 --> 07:30.860
No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.

07:30.860 --> 07:31.700
Oh, yes.

07:31.700 --> 07:33.140
Jack Dawson gets more backstory

07:33.140 --> 07:35.500
than generally agreed upon good characters

07:35.500 --> 07:38.380
like everyone in Jurassic Park.

07:38.380 --> 07:40.580
What's your backstory, Alan Grant?

07:40.580 --> 07:42.940
We're going to find out why you don't like kids?

07:42.940 --> 07:43.780
Oh, wait, who cares?

07:43.780 --> 07:44.620
It doesn't matter.

07:44.620 --> 07:45.540
And then there's the criticism

07:45.540 --> 07:47.020
that the film is melodramatic,

07:47.020 --> 07:48.020
which I also find odd

07:48.020 --> 07:50.100
because the melodrama of the situation

07:50.100 --> 07:53.340
is why we remember the Titanic disaster at all.

07:53.340 --> 07:55.500
It was the largest moving object in the world

07:55.500 --> 07:57.380
built by human hands at the time,

07:57.420 --> 07:59.900
as well as the apex of Edwardian glamour.

07:59.900 --> 08:03.260
It was to be the captain's last voyage before he retired,

08:03.260 --> 08:06.460
and the ship sank on its maiden voyage.

08:06.460 --> 08:08.500
Any publisher would throw that concept out

08:08.500 --> 08:10.700
for being way too over the top

08:10.700 --> 08:12.460
if it had not actually happened.

08:12.460 --> 08:15.660
It is a fundamentally melodramatic historical event,

08:15.660 --> 08:17.860
so there's not really anything tonally off

08:17.860 --> 08:20.940
about having a big emotions romantic epic

08:20.940 --> 08:22.980
on board the ship right before it sinks.

08:22.980 --> 08:25.340
Simplicity, likewise, is a fine line to walk.

08:25.340 --> 08:27.060
A storyline might feel simple

08:27.060 --> 08:29.300
after you've watched a movie 400 times,

08:29.300 --> 08:30.900
but one must also consider

08:30.900 --> 08:33.580
how a story lands to a first-time audience,

08:33.580 --> 08:35.500
as well as repeat viewers.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.860
Not to be that guy, but now that, like...

08:37.860 --> 08:39.420
I'm a writer now.

08:39.420 --> 08:41.020
But after I sold my first book,

08:41.020 --> 08:43.660
available July 21st, pre-order link in the description,

08:43.660 --> 08:45.740
a huge component of the revisions

08:45.740 --> 08:48.700
were simplifying the mysteries what get revealed

08:48.700 --> 08:51.100
and clarifying world-building and plot elements

08:51.100 --> 08:53.620
that I had thought were pretty clear,

08:53.620 --> 08:56.380
but were reading as confusing to first-time readers,

08:56.380 --> 08:59.820
like my editor and my literary agent.

08:59.820 --> 09:02.060
So simplicity and clarity is harder to do

09:02.060 --> 09:03.260
than you might think,

09:03.260 --> 09:06.500
and more complex does not equal more good.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.540
In the case of Titanic, the main love story,

09:08.540 --> 09:10.660
star-crossed lovers of different class who meet,

09:10.660 --> 09:12.420
fall in love, and then one of them dies,

09:12.420 --> 09:13.620
is fairly simple,

09:13.620 --> 09:16.140
in the same way that Romeo and Juliet is fairly simple

09:16.140 --> 09:18.100
if you reduce it to its core components.

09:18.100 --> 09:21.260
I defy you stars!

09:21.260 --> 09:22.540
But it has to balance its bulk

09:22.540 --> 09:23.740
with a bunch of other subplots,

09:23.740 --> 09:25.300
both with tying in the two mains

09:25.300 --> 09:27.340
and with the fate of the ship itself.

09:27.340 --> 09:29.260
So the film needs to walk a fine line.

09:29.260 --> 09:31.300
Spectacle versus emotional core,

09:31.300 --> 09:33.260
melodrama versus absurdity,

09:33.260 --> 09:34.700
sincerity versus irony,

09:34.700 --> 09:37.500
and all the while appeal to as many people as possible.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.260
Cameron himself described his script

09:39.260 --> 09:41.220
as intentionally incorporating universals

09:41.220 --> 09:42.700
of human experience and emotion

09:42.700 --> 09:44.340
that are timeless and familiar

09:44.340 --> 09:47.140
because they reflect our basic emotional fabric.

09:47.140 --> 09:49.500
And all the while I feel I'm

09:49.500 --> 09:51.300
standing in the middle of a crowded room

09:51.300 --> 09:53.060
screaming at the top of my lungs

09:53.060 --> 09:54.700
and no one even looks up.

09:54.700 --> 09:57.260
In response to the accusation that the film is cliche,

09:57.260 --> 09:58.100
Cameron said,

09:58.100 --> 10:00.500
LA Times critic Kenneth Turan mistakes archetypes

10:00.500 --> 10:01.660
for cliche.

10:01.660 --> 10:03.300
I don't share his view that the best scripts

10:03.300 --> 10:04.580
are only the ones that explore

10:04.580 --> 10:06.260
the perimeter of human experience

10:06.260 --> 10:08.660
or flashly pirouette their witty and cynical dialogue

10:08.660 --> 10:10.060
for our admiration.

10:10.060 --> 10:11.780
You dropped this, King.

10:12.820 --> 10:15.100
It's from my masterpiece, Starscream,

10:15.100 --> 10:16.660
it's the only crown I have.

10:16.660 --> 10:18.580
And of course the mere audacity of that attempt

10:18.580 --> 10:20.500
is a strike against the movie's favor.

10:20.500 --> 10:22.580
It's trying to be populist trash.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.620
Which leads us to another common criticism,

10:24.620 --> 10:26.620
that the film is too base.

10:26.620 --> 10:28.700
The swill of the common folk.

10:28.700 --> 10:31.060
Like that is a bug and not a feature.

10:31.060 --> 10:32.340
There is a sort of classism

10:32.340 --> 10:34.300
inherent to criticisms like this.

10:34.300 --> 10:37.220
In effect, it's too many people like this.

10:37.220 --> 10:39.060
Which one sees reflected in the criticism

10:39.060 --> 10:42.260
that Cameron's Titanic valorizes the third class

10:42.260 --> 10:44.700
and demonizes the first class.

10:44.700 --> 10:46.380
My favorite bad Titanic take

10:46.380 --> 10:49.140
comes from historian Richard Davenport Hind,

10:49.140 --> 10:49.980
who wrote,

10:49.980 --> 10:52.740
Cameron's film diabolized rich Americans

10:52.740 --> 10:54.500
and educated English,

10:54.500 --> 10:57.380
anathematizing their emotional restraint,

10:57.380 --> 10:58.620
good tailoring,

10:58.620 --> 11:00.100
punctilious manners,

11:00.100 --> 11:01.700
and grammatical training,

11:01.700 --> 11:03.660
while it made romantic heroes

11:03.660 --> 11:06.500
of the poor Irish and the unlettered.

11:08.940 --> 11:09.980
Wow.

11:09.980 --> 11:12.380
But the thing about popular and low art

11:12.380 --> 11:14.060
is that given enough time,

11:14.060 --> 11:16.940
history often reframes it as high art.

11:16.940 --> 11:18.500
Shakespeare, Puccini, Dickens,

11:18.500 --> 11:19.780
even the novel itself,

11:19.780 --> 11:21.460
all started off as popular art

11:21.460 --> 11:24.380
that only got reframed as high art in retrospect.

11:24.380 --> 11:26.980
So popular art that hits with a wide audience,

11:26.980 --> 11:27.820
difficult to do,

11:27.820 --> 11:30.820
but popular art that stands the test of time,

11:30.820 --> 11:31.740
even harder.

11:31.740 --> 11:33.100
There's truth, but no logic.

11:33.100 --> 11:34.380
What's the artist's name?

11:34.380 --> 11:35.820
Something Picasso.

11:35.820 --> 11:39.340
Even Empire Magazine originally gave the film five stars,

11:39.340 --> 11:42.900
then later revised it down to four after the backlash,

11:42.900 --> 11:46.060
and then eventually revised it back up to five

11:46.060 --> 11:46.980
when they realized

11:46.980 --> 11:48.580
that they were basically peer pressured

11:48.580 --> 11:49.940
into giving it a bad review.

11:49.940 --> 11:52.540
So I feel like the eagerness that some film people have

11:52.540 --> 11:54.780
to distance themselves from Titanic

11:54.780 --> 11:57.620
isn't really out of a desire to assess the quality

11:57.620 --> 11:59.140
or impact of the film,

11:59.140 --> 12:02.100
but to tiptoe around the backlash that followed it.

12:02.100 --> 12:04.820
And even if you're too young to remember the backlash,

12:04.820 --> 12:07.820
you can still probably feel it in the atmosphere.

12:07.820 --> 12:10.580
Like saying that one of the most successful movies

12:10.580 --> 12:12.700
in history is good, actually,

12:12.700 --> 12:14.780
is a ding against your credibility.

12:14.780 --> 12:17.380
Are the masses really that stupid

12:17.380 --> 12:18.540
that if they like the thing,

12:18.540 --> 12:21.340
it must be because the thing is bad, actually?

12:21.340 --> 12:23.780
Well, if one must descend into the trash pile

12:23.780 --> 12:26.100
in order to admit that we enjoy the thing,

12:26.100 --> 12:28.740
then this is where we live now.

12:28.740 --> 12:31.300
So we're not going outside anytime soon.

12:31.300 --> 12:35.660
♪♪

12:35.660 --> 12:37.060
Why this shipwreck?

12:37.060 --> 12:39.060
You know, why not the Lusitania?

12:39.060 --> 12:40.500
Why not the Morrow Castle?

12:40.500 --> 12:42.140
Why not the Atlantic?

12:42.140 --> 12:43.860
I mean, you've got, you know, the biggest ship in the world.

12:43.860 --> 12:45.100
It's on its maiden voyage.

12:45.100 --> 12:47.260
You've got the president of the company on board that owns it.

12:47.260 --> 12:49.060
You've got the builder on board.

12:49.060 --> 12:52.260
And it hits an iceberg, and it sinks so slowly

12:52.260 --> 12:53.580
that you've got all these hours

12:53.580 --> 12:55.340
for all this drama to be acted out.

12:55.340 --> 12:57.940
But there's way more to it than the drama of it all.

12:57.940 --> 12:59.460
The time period in which it happened

12:59.460 --> 13:01.620
is also, of course, relevant.

13:01.620 --> 13:03.900
The Edwardian era, and yes, this counts,

13:03.900 --> 13:07.140
was the last before the advent of modern warfare.

13:07.140 --> 13:08.820
With World War I came all of this

13:08.820 --> 13:10.820
senseless death and carnage.

13:10.820 --> 13:16.460
Then World War II, where a solid 3% of all of humanity died.

13:16.460 --> 13:17.860
Then the nuclear age.

13:17.860 --> 13:19.420
And, of course, the sword of Damocles

13:19.420 --> 13:22.180
that hangs over us to this day, climate change.

13:22.180 --> 13:25.660
So it's almost like a simpler world

13:25.660 --> 13:27.260
went down with the boat.

13:27.260 --> 13:28.940
A more civilized world.

13:28.940 --> 13:31.100
A more glamorous world.

13:31.100 --> 13:34.420
It's always oversimplifying to say it was a simpler time

13:34.420 --> 13:36.340
or a more innocent time,

13:36.340 --> 13:39.540
but that is kind of what it felt like.

13:39.580 --> 13:40.740
Similar to Downton Abbey,

13:40.740 --> 13:43.740
which basically captures the last gasps of aristocracy

13:43.740 --> 13:45.500
before World War I in England.

13:45.500 --> 13:46.900
Do we know anyone on board?

13:46.900 --> 13:49.060
Your mother knows the Astors, at least she knows him.

13:49.060 --> 13:50.700
Titanic does the same.

13:50.700 --> 13:52.980
Yes, class stratification and inequality

13:52.980 --> 13:54.660
are still major things today,

13:54.660 --> 13:56.820
but there's no glamour to the social lives

13:56.820 --> 13:59.420
of, like, Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates.

13:59.420 --> 14:01.500
So you're saying you teach them that they have chores?

14:01.500 --> 14:02.340
Yeah. They have chores.

14:02.340 --> 14:03.180
Your kids have chores.

14:03.180 --> 14:04.020
Yeah, they have responsibilities.

14:04.020 --> 14:05.340
They have chores, they have responsibilities.

14:06.340 --> 14:07.660
Now, flaunting your wealth

14:07.660 --> 14:09.380
is what the kids call a bad look.

14:09.380 --> 14:11.860
Cameron was far from being the first or only person

14:11.860 --> 14:13.380
to wring the entertainment potential

14:13.380 --> 14:14.940
out of this tragedy of errors.

14:14.940 --> 14:16.940
In fact, it was only weeks after the ship sank

14:16.940 --> 14:18.300
that studios around the world

14:18.300 --> 14:20.060
began producing dramatized films.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.740
One notable being the silent short

14:21.740 --> 14:25.940
Saved From the Titanic released a cool 29 days

14:25.940 --> 14:26.780
after the shipwreck

14:26.780 --> 14:30.140
and starring a survivor of the disaster, Dorothy Gibson.

14:30.140 --> 14:32.460
But the heyday for the Titanic dramatization

14:32.460 --> 14:33.780
came in the 1950s.

14:33.780 --> 14:36.260
There was a 1953 Barbara Stanwyck film

14:36.260 --> 14:37.460
simply called Titanic,

14:37.460 --> 14:38.820
which is a wildly inaccurate,

14:38.820 --> 14:40.420
fanciful piece of fan fiction.

14:40.420 --> 14:45.420
♪ River, why don't you be ♪

14:47.060 --> 14:50.460
♪ River, why don't you be ♪

14:50.460 --> 14:53.780
♪ River, why don't you be ♪

14:53.780 --> 14:55.060
But hey, you know, it made money

14:55.060 --> 14:56.660
and walked away with the best screenplay Oscar.

14:56.660 --> 14:58.980
And it paved the road for A Night to Remember,

14:58.980 --> 15:00.940
widely considered the more historically accurate

15:00.940 --> 15:02.300
of the bunch and easily the film

15:02.300 --> 15:04.340
with the greatest influence on Cameron's version.

15:04.340 --> 15:06.860
It's kind of like how Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame

15:06.860 --> 15:10.420
is really more of a remake of the 1939 Hunchback of Notre Dame

15:10.420 --> 15:12.300
than an adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel.

15:12.300 --> 15:14.820
Hell, even the Nazis made their own propaganda version

15:14.820 --> 15:16.020
of Titanic.

15:16.020 --> 15:18.900
And this version took the narrative of J. Bruce Ismay,

15:18.900 --> 15:20.740
wealthy coward who survived,

15:20.740 --> 15:23.540
and turned him into an evil, greedy Jew

15:23.540 --> 15:26.020
who was also a coward that survived.

15:26.020 --> 15:27.340
Because of course they did.

15:27.940 --> 15:30.420
And as a side note, perhaps the person done dirtiest

15:30.420 --> 15:33.020
by history and dramatized versions of Titanic

15:33.020 --> 15:36.140
is J. Bruce Ismay, who was the highest ranking official

15:36.140 --> 15:38.580
on board the Titanic who actually survived.

15:38.580 --> 15:39.500
And he's the guy in the movie

15:39.500 --> 15:41.700
he's pushing the captain to make the boat go faster.

15:41.700 --> 15:43.540
The person is the size of Titanic.

15:43.540 --> 15:46.100
Now I want them to marvel at her speed.

15:46.100 --> 15:49.020
In real life, Ismay was not the living embodiment of hubris.

15:49.020 --> 15:50.740
While he did get on the last lifeboat,

15:50.740 --> 15:52.740
he was not the last man on the Titanic.

15:52.740 --> 15:54.580
He was the last man on the Titanic.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.260
While he did get on the last lifeboat,

15:57.260 --> 15:58.620
there is little evidence to support

15:58.620 --> 16:00.940
that he actually ordered the Titanic to go faster.

16:00.940 --> 16:02.620
Most of the people who saw him on the boat

16:02.620 --> 16:04.740
actually testified that he helped save people

16:04.740 --> 16:05.620
and only hopped in the boat

16:05.620 --> 16:07.220
because there were no women and children around

16:07.220 --> 16:08.100
to take the space.

16:08.100 --> 16:10.100
And a lot of the Ismay hearsay was established

16:10.100 --> 16:13.500
by William Randolph Hearst, who hated Ismay.

16:13.500 --> 16:16.460
And Cameron knew this, so why include it?

16:16.460 --> 16:18.540
Well, because according to Cameron,

16:18.540 --> 16:20.060
people expected to see it.

16:20.060 --> 16:23.420
And so he's here in this role

16:23.580 --> 16:25.500
to play to people's expectations,

16:25.500 --> 16:26.900
to give them what they want.

16:27.740 --> 16:29.820
The 90s resurgence of Titanic interest

16:29.820 --> 16:31.500
most likely came about as a result

16:31.500 --> 16:32.820
of the wreckage being discovered.

16:32.820 --> 16:34.820
There was a TV miniseries from 1996

16:34.820 --> 16:36.140
starring Catherine Zeta-Jones

16:36.140 --> 16:38.100
in a role quite similar to Rose.

16:39.140 --> 16:41.140
Just breathe, darling.

16:42.780 --> 16:45.540
Just show them you can breathe, darling.

16:45.540 --> 16:48.420
Just breathe, just breathe.

16:48.420 --> 16:51.340
There was a musical from 1997 called Titanic,

16:51.340 --> 16:53.620
a new musical written by Maury Yeston

16:53.620 --> 16:55.340
and Arthur Coppett of nine fame

16:55.340 --> 16:58.500
and this proto phantom.

17:00.660 --> 17:03.060
And while this musical swept a very low energy

17:03.060 --> 17:05.020
Tony Award season, winning five awards,

17:05.020 --> 17:07.140
including best musical, it ranks pretty high

17:07.140 --> 17:10.140

and so far the ones we've discussed that are relevant

18:04.940 --> 18:07.300
to Titanic have been 40-year cycles,

18:07.300 --> 18:10.220
with a big resurgence of interest in the 1950s

18:10.220 --> 18:12.540

18:14.940 --> 18:17.620
nostalgia cycle is the 20-year cycle,

18:17.620 --> 18:20.180
because generally it applies to a demographic

18:20.180 --> 18:22.780
who are, you know, they're kinda getting settled in life,

18:22.780 --> 18:25.220

18:31.140 --> 18:33.580
Think of how Grease, a huge hit released in the 70s,

18:33.580 --> 18:35.140
was nostalgic for the 50s.

18:35.140 --> 18:37.700
You have your Brady Bunch and all sorts of sitcom remakes

18:37.700 --> 18:40.540
that were released in the 90s, nostalgic for the 70s.

18:40.540 --> 18:41.820
Sure, Jan.

18:41.820 --> 18:44.940
But also in the 90s we had the stylistic nostalgia cycle

18:44.940 --> 18:46.540
for disaster movies.

18:46.540 --> 18:48.180
In the 70s you had big hits like

18:48.180 --> 18:50.340
Towering Inferno and Earthquake.

18:50.340 --> 18:52.220
But in the 90s we had another resurgence,

18:52.220 --> 18:53.820
not only with natural disaster movies

18:53.820 --> 18:57.540
like Dante's Peak and Volcano, Deep Impact, Armageddon,

18:57.540 --> 18:58.540
God, there were so many,

18:58.540 --> 19:00.380
but we also had like alien invasions,

19:00.380 --> 19:02.140
we had Independence Day,

19:02.140 --> 19:07.140
any manner of way we can almost wipe out human civilization.

19:07.300 --> 19:08.940
We were so bored in the 90s.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.900
And right now we're on the verge of a 20-year cycle

19:10.900 --> 19:12.660
for the 2000s as well,

19:12.660 --> 19:15.660
which I intend on capitalizing shamelessly.

19:15.660 --> 19:16.860
Link in the description.

19:18.300 --> 19:19.140
It's a period piece.

19:19.140 --> 19:21.500
Titanic was pitched as Romeo and Juliet,

19:21.500 --> 19:22.860
but on the Titanic.

19:22.860 --> 19:24.980
But the danger there is then it looks like

19:24.980 --> 19:27.100
a movie for women's.

19:27.100 --> 19:28.580
Look, is it a boy movie or a girl movie?

19:28.580 --> 19:29.420
We have to choose.

19:29.420 --> 19:31.300
And I could go into the convoluted nightmare

19:31.300 --> 19:32.700
of the production of this movie

19:32.700 --> 19:35.180
and how all signs pointed to failure,

19:35.180 --> 19:37.380
but really that would deserve its own video.

19:37.380 --> 19:40.300
By virtue of the fact that Cameron was a proven hit maker,

19:40.300 --> 19:42.980
studios gave him a lot more money and freedom

19:42.980 --> 19:44.980
than they would have to other directors,

19:44.980 --> 19:47.420
which is partially why Titanic is allowed to

19:47.420 --> 19:50.580
so completely inhabit both worlds,

19:50.580 --> 19:52.140
both shamelessly romantic

19:52.140 --> 19:54.980
and a textbook 90s disaster movie.

19:54.980 --> 19:56.940
But because the studio was capping costs,

19:56.940 --> 19:58.340
Titanic didn't have anything like

19:58.340 --> 20:00.940
the marketing push we see in big movies today.

20:00.940 --> 20:04.420
So a lot of its success really did kind of

20:04.420 --> 20:06.580
come by word of mouth.

20:06.580 --> 20:07.980
And the fact that for the most part,

20:07.980 --> 20:11.140
Hollywood failed to repeat the success of Titanic,

20:11.140 --> 20:12.260
and we'll get to that,

20:12.260 --> 20:14.340
tells me that they never really understood

20:14.340 --> 20:16.820
why it was a success in the first place.

20:16.820 --> 20:18.700
I mean, attempts were made.

20:18.700 --> 20:20.020
And I'll get to that in a minute.

20:20.020 --> 20:22.380
But first, I would like to talk about.

20:22.380 --> 20:26.540
♪♪

20:26.540 --> 20:27.900
A lot of people joked at the time

20:27.900 --> 20:29.860
about who would want to see a Titanic movie,

20:29.860 --> 20:32.580
because, you know, we all know how it ends, right?

20:32.580 --> 20:33.900
So within the text of the film,

20:33.900 --> 20:36.820
the audience needs an incentive to engage with the story

20:36.820 --> 20:39.140
outside of simply knowing how it ends.

20:39.140 --> 20:41.340
See, previous Titanic movies or musicals

20:41.340 --> 20:43.460
just told the story as a period piece.

20:43.460 --> 20:45.300
But Cameron's film uses the modern day

20:45.300 --> 20:47.780
and a self-insert character named Bill Paxton

20:47.780 --> 20:51.820
as James Cameron's, if you'll excuse the term, avatar.

20:51.820 --> 20:54.140
Meet Bill Paxton, played by Brock Lovett,

20:54.140 --> 20:55.500
our James Cameron insert

20:55.500 --> 20:58.100
who only cares about the money, not the science.

20:58.100 --> 21:00.180
He's in it for the money, not the science.

21:00.180 --> 21:01.300
He's in it for the glory,

21:01.300 --> 21:03.700
but doesn't really understand the heart of the tragedy.

21:03.700 --> 21:04.700
You know, he doesn't get it.

21:04.700 --> 21:06.060
And that's where Rose comes in.

21:06.060 --> 21:07.260
She's going to tell her story,

21:07.260 --> 21:09.580
and then he's going to get it.

21:09.580 --> 21:11.660
Part of the reason Titanic was such a hit

21:11.660 --> 21:13.940
was because audiences were really starring

21:13.940 --> 21:16.860
for deeply sincere emotional content.

21:16.860 --> 21:18.020
But if you're going to go that route,

21:18.020 --> 21:20.540
you can't just bust in with a high melodrama.

21:20.540 --> 21:21.780
Look, it's the 90s, kids.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.220
We are all irony poisoned.

21:23.220 --> 21:24.740
The president is being impeached over

21:25.180 --> 21:27.220
politics are for suckers and nothing matters.

21:27.220 --> 21:28.900
But we are all deeply lonely.

21:28.900 --> 21:30.860
The success of Titanic kind of reminds me

21:30.860 --> 21:32.540
of Star Wars 20 years earlier.

21:32.540 --> 21:35.580
The 70s weren't as irony poisoned as the 90s,

21:35.580 --> 21:39.340
but the trend definitely rejected old Hollywood simplicity

21:39.340 --> 21:41.740
or this epic tone that Star Wars was going for.

21:41.740 --> 21:43.460
The assumption was that audiences

21:43.460 --> 21:45.060
would be turned off by that approach,

21:45.060 --> 21:47.500
when in reality, they were apparently starving for it.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.500
A cowboy movie set in space.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.020
That's Star Wars.

21:51.020 --> 21:53.340
It's old-fashioned, escapist entertainment,

21:53.340 --> 21:56.580
pure and simple, with no moral, no message.

21:56.580 --> 21:58.940
And it appears this is what just about everybody

21:58.940 --> 22:00.580
in the country is in the mood for.

22:00.580 --> 22:02.420
So Titanic's framing device is important

22:02.420 --> 22:04.860
in the context of a 90s movie in particular,

22:04.860 --> 22:07.540
because by allowing for all of this eye rolling

22:07.540 --> 22:10.980
and yeah, we know it's schmaltzy, but just roll with it.

22:14.980 --> 22:18.260
It's easier for the audience to suspend their disbelief

22:18.260 --> 22:21.500
or their irony in the case of the 90s and accept the story.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.060
It takes about 25 minutes to get through

22:23.060 --> 22:24.660
the framing device at the beginning.

22:24.660 --> 22:26.220
And not only does it leave no doubt

22:26.220 --> 22:27.580
as to how the story ends,

22:27.580 --> 22:30.180
we know the ship sinks before the story proper even starts.

22:30.180 --> 22:32.460
It also tells us the science of what is happening.

22:32.460 --> 22:35.500
So when the ship does sink some two hours later,

22:35.500 --> 22:37.020
you don't have the audience being like,

22:37.020 --> 22:40.420
what the hell, when it breaks in half or sinks vertically.

22:40.420 --> 22:44.540
The stern rises up, slow at first and faster and faster

22:44.540 --> 22:46.340
until finally she's got her whole ass

22:46.340 --> 22:47.340
sticking up in the air.

22:47.340 --> 22:49.700
But moreover, the thing about a Titanic movie is,

22:49.700 --> 22:52.020
I mean, the fact that we know how it ends

22:52.020 --> 22:53.740
means you have to have a new main tension

22:53.740 --> 22:55.380
rather than will the boat sink or not.

22:55.380 --> 22:57.060
Instead of will the ship sink,

22:57.060 --> 22:59.020
the narrative hooks are character-based.

22:59.020 --> 23:01.100
We know Rose survives, but how?

23:01.100 --> 23:03.540
And why has she kept her identity a secret?

23:03.540 --> 23:04.740
What happened to Jack?

23:04.740 --> 23:06.820
And where is that necklace anyway?

23:06.820 --> 23:08.620
In the context of the framing device,

23:08.620 --> 23:11.500
the necklace is what we call a MacGuffin.

23:11.500 --> 23:12.340
Is it a-

23:12.340 --> 23:13.180
Diamond, yes.

23:13.180 --> 23:14.980
In simple terms, a MacGuffin is a thing

23:14.980 --> 23:16.140
that drives the plot,

23:16.140 --> 23:18.660
but it doesn't actually matter to the story.

23:18.660 --> 23:21.060
Everybody wants the necklace because of course they do.

23:21.060 --> 23:22.420
It's a thing we can fight over.

23:22.420 --> 23:24.740
It's the reason Rose and Bill Paxton

23:24.740 --> 23:25.980
meet in the first place.

23:25.980 --> 23:27.580
But it doesn't actually matter to the story

23:27.580 --> 23:31.220
because the story is about Jack and Rose, not the diamond.

23:31.220 --> 23:33.420
Hence she throws it into the ocean at the end.

23:33.420 --> 23:36.460
But now you know there was a man named Jack Dawson

23:37.460 --> 23:38.780
and that he saved me

23:39.660 --> 23:42.940
in every way that a person can be saved.

23:42.940 --> 23:44.420
And it's stuff like this that leads to

23:44.420 --> 23:46.060
a lot of really lame criticism

23:46.060 --> 23:48.180
because all we have to do now

23:48.180 --> 23:50.980
that it's the end times is logic the thing.

23:50.980 --> 23:52.220
Like in the making of this video,

23:52.220 --> 23:53.940
every time I tweeted about Titanic,

23:53.940 --> 23:57.660
I got like 400 ats about the door or headboard

23:57.660 --> 23:58.940
or whatever that thing is.

23:58.940 --> 24:00.740
Like, Jack could have fit on there too.

24:00.740 --> 24:02.060
They both could have fit on the head.

24:02.060 --> 24:04.540
Like, way to miss the point, assholes.

24:04.540 --> 24:06.820
Like there's even a really lame deleted scene

24:06.820 --> 24:08.420
where they address this.

24:08.420 --> 24:09.900
Just enough for this lady.

24:09.900 --> 24:11.060
We'll push it under.

24:11.060 --> 24:13.940
Let me try at least or I'll die soon.

24:13.940 --> 24:15.580
You'll die sooner if you come any closer.

24:15.580 --> 24:16.900
You see, we, the audience,

24:16.900 --> 24:19.140
need to feel the weight of the loss here.

24:19.140 --> 24:21.620
Not just the 1,500 randos that died,

24:21.620 --> 24:23.340
but the character that we've come to know

24:23.340 --> 24:24.900
and care about for the last three hours.

24:24.900 --> 24:27.540
So Jack sacrificing himself is a micro version

24:27.540 --> 24:29.660
of what makes the story so remarkable.

24:29.660 --> 24:31.500
Any room for a gentleman, gentlemen?

24:31.500 --> 24:33.300
I don't need women at this time, sir.

24:33.300 --> 24:34.700
Women and children first

24:34.700 --> 24:37.340
wasn't an official policy by any stretch.

24:37.340 --> 24:39.340
It was not maritime law.

24:39.340 --> 24:41.020
It was more like the Pirate's Code

24:41.020 --> 24:43.740
and Pirates of the Caribbean, more of a guideline.

24:43.740 --> 24:46.220
So while in theory in a disaster situation,

24:46.220 --> 24:50.300
the men folk would try to save the women and children first,

24:50.300 --> 24:52.060
the reality is that women and children

24:52.060 --> 24:55.260
were way less likely to survive shipwrecks.

24:55.260 --> 24:57.740
And in practice, it was usually every man for himself.

24:57.740 --> 25:00.660
The White Star Line's previous worst maritime disaster,

25:00.660 --> 25:02.260
the sinking of the SS Atlantic,

25:02.260 --> 25:04.660
lost more than half of its passengers when it sank

25:04.660 --> 25:06.500
and every single woman on board

25:06.500 --> 25:08.900
and all but one of the children died.

25:08.900 --> 25:11.180
So the fact that the majority of Titanic survivors

25:11.180 --> 25:14.500
were women and children is actually an extreme outlier.

25:14.540 --> 25:16.460
So Jack giving up his spot for Rose

25:16.460 --> 25:19.420
serves as synecdoche for the greater sacrifice.

25:19.420 --> 25:21.420
He knowingly gives up his spot for her

25:21.420 --> 25:23.340
just as hundreds of others did.

25:23.340 --> 25:25.500
Cameron could have contrived any number of ways

25:25.500 --> 25:28.220
for Jack to give up his chance at life for Rose,

25:28.220 --> 25:31.220
but to get so obsessed with the logistics of the door

25:31.220 --> 25:33.580
and the buoyancy and the square footage,

25:33.580 --> 25:35.620
which is explained in the text.

25:40.620 --> 25:43.260
So to focus on that instead of the simple plot element

25:43.260 --> 25:45.620
of Jack sacrifices his life for Rose

25:45.620 --> 25:47.180
is to completely miss the point.

25:47.180 --> 25:48.980
If you want to contrive some other way

25:48.980 --> 25:51.060
for Cameron to have gotten this across,

25:51.060 --> 25:54.940
leave me a comment, boost my algorithm rating.

25:55.980 --> 25:58.700
I promise I'll read each one.

25:58.700 --> 26:02.940
Thank you for that fine forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.

26:07.060 --> 26:08.740
Titanic is functionally two movies.

26:08.740 --> 26:11.460
In the first half, the Romeo and Juliet love story,

26:11.500 --> 26:13.420
and the second half, the action movie,

26:13.420 --> 26:14.900
which again should not work

26:14.900 --> 26:16.580
and is really difficult to pull off.

26:16.580 --> 26:18.300
But in practice, the first half serves

26:18.300 --> 26:20.380
to make the audience care about the thing,

26:20.380 --> 26:22.500
the ship, the people on it, the love story,

26:22.500 --> 26:24.420
and then the second half takes it all away.

26:24.420 --> 26:26.740
The two halves have completely different tensions.

26:26.740 --> 26:29.060
The first half being the will they won't they get together,

26:29.060 --> 26:32.100
the second half being who will survive and how.

26:32.100 --> 26:33.180
To again quote Cameron,

26:33.180 --> 26:34.500
you have to care about the ship

26:34.500 --> 26:36.060
in order to care about the sinking.

26:36.060 --> 26:38.820
I have built you a good ship, strong and true.

26:38.820 --> 26:40.900
The best case for what works about Titanic

26:40.900 --> 26:42.340
can be made by comparing it

26:42.340 --> 26:45.100
to its most blatant ripoff, Pearl Harbor.

26:47.980 --> 26:50.420
Pearl Harbor is a love story set against the backdrop

26:50.420 --> 26:52.180
of a major historical tragedy,

26:52.180 --> 26:53.700
in this case, a surprise attack

26:53.700 --> 26:55.900
that led to the U.S. entering World War II.

26:55.900 --> 26:58.980
There are more obvious ripoff elements, the score.

27:04.100 --> 27:08.300
It has a fun dance scene, both involve ship sinking.

27:08.380 --> 27:11.220
Also, where Titanic has Fabrizio.

27:11.220 --> 27:16.220
Goodbye, I will never forget you, I go to America.

27:17.100 --> 27:19.540
I can see the Statue of Liberty already.

27:19.540 --> 27:23.060
Pearl Harbor has like seven Fabrizios.

27:23.060 --> 27:25.820
Here's a Fabrizio, there's a Fabrizio,

27:25.820 --> 27:29.300
Fabrizio, black Fabrizio, lady Fabrizio.

27:29.300 --> 27:31.100
But it's not what the movie takes from Titanic

27:31.100 --> 27:34.580
that makes Pearl Harbor such a failure, it's what it lacks.

27:34.580 --> 27:36.500
Pearl Harbor approaches its love story

27:36.500 --> 27:38.420
with the same logic as the clowns

27:38.420 --> 27:43.140
from the original animated Dumbo approach, laughing.

27:43.140 --> 27:45.940
Yeah, if they laugh when he jumps 20 feet,

27:45.940 --> 27:49.140
they'll laugh twice just hard if he jumps 40 feet.

27:49.140 --> 27:51.700
If you were rooting for these two crazy kids,

27:51.700 --> 27:54.380
how about these three crazy kids?

27:59.460 --> 28:01.020
Yeah, so love triangles are generally

28:01.020 --> 28:02.740
pretty frustrating narrative devices,

28:02.740 --> 28:04.860
especially if the narrative isn't serialized

28:04.860 --> 28:06.820
like in a TV show or a book series.

28:08.260 --> 28:09.300
You've gotta be kidding me.

28:09.300 --> 28:11.020
And when they do work incorporated

28:11.020 --> 28:12.620
in something short like a movie,

28:12.620 --> 28:14.500
it's where the choice is obvious.

28:14.500 --> 28:17.820
I feel this, I feel, I feel the pain.

28:17.820 --> 28:19.740
Yes, you are, and I will.

28:19.740 --> 28:21.660
It's not who will Rose choose,

28:21.660 --> 28:24.460
it's will Rose get away from the bad one?

28:24.460 --> 28:25.980
Again, the choice is simple,

28:25.980 --> 28:28.460
and in this case, simple is not bad.

28:28.460 --> 28:30.540
You jump, I jump, right?

28:30.540 --> 28:32.540
In a movie, you just don't really have enough time

28:32.540 --> 28:35.380
to develop two relationships well enough

28:35.380 --> 28:37.900
to the point where it's like, oh wow,

28:37.900 --> 28:40.500
I wonder who she'll choose, Team Jacob.

28:40.500 --> 28:42.700
But the real difference between the romance in Titanic

28:42.700 --> 28:44.380
and the romance in Pearl Harbor

28:44.380 --> 28:47.260
goes back to the simple screenwriting question

28:47.260 --> 28:49.140
of want versus need,

28:49.140 --> 28:51.540
a motivating want that drives the plot

28:51.540 --> 28:53.860
and a character arc defining need.

28:53.860 --> 28:56.780
Again, for another example of simple is not bad,

28:56.780 --> 29:00.140
Michael Jordan wants to be a baseball player,

29:00.140 --> 29:02.660
and this is what serves as his character motivation

29:02.660 --> 29:04.340
in the first act of the film.

29:04.340 --> 29:06.580
But when, because of some space monsters,

29:06.580 --> 29:08.980
the only thing that can save the world

29:08.980 --> 29:11.820
is someone with mad basketball skills,

29:11.820 --> 29:16.260
he realizes that he needs to go back to basketball

29:16.260 --> 29:19.740
and that his true place is on the court.

29:19.740 --> 29:21.300
Now leave the baseball player alone, man.

29:21.300 --> 29:23.340
You know he doesn't play basketball anymore.

29:23.340 --> 29:25.140
Michael, did you hear that?

29:25.140 --> 29:27.340
They don't think you can play the game anymore.

29:30.980 --> 29:32.940
There's only one way to find out.

29:32.940 --> 29:34.460
But at the beginning of Pearl Harbor,

29:34.460 --> 29:36.860
none of the main characters want for anything

29:36.860 --> 29:38.980
before they meet and fall in love,

29:38.980 --> 29:41.140
except for Ben Affleck's dyslexia

29:41.140 --> 29:43.700
maybe getting in the way of him becoming a pilot.

29:43.700 --> 29:45.620
I'm never gonna be an English teacher,

29:46.620 --> 29:49.780
but I know why I'm here, to be a pilot.

29:49.780 --> 29:51.340
And you don't dogfight with manuals.

29:51.340 --> 29:53.500
Which is immediately resolved anyway.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.540
In Titanic, Rose is our point of view character

29:55.540 --> 29:57.660
and she's the one who's really missing something

29:57.660 --> 29:59.700
in her life when the narrative begins.

29:59.780 --> 30:01.740
She is repressed, she is lonely,

30:01.740 --> 30:03.220
she is desperate to break free

30:03.220 --> 30:05.260
and feels like there's no way out

30:05.260 --> 30:06.860
until she meets Jack.

30:06.860 --> 30:08.100
And manic pixie dream Jack

30:08.100 --> 30:09.940
helps her complete her character arc.

30:09.940 --> 30:12.740
But in Pearl Harbor, no one really wants for anything,

30:12.740 --> 30:14.180
let alone needs it.

30:14.180 --> 30:16.180
Kate Beckinsale has her girlfriends,

30:16.180 --> 30:18.100
Affleck and Hartnett have each other

30:18.100 --> 30:20.020
and their terrible Southern accents.

30:20.020 --> 30:21.820
I don't wanna teach loops and barrel rows,

30:21.820 --> 30:23.340
I wanna be a combat fighter.

30:23.340 --> 30:25.700
So no one is lonely or unsupported.

30:25.700 --> 30:27.780
No one is missing something critical in their lives

30:27.780 --> 30:30.060
that might be improved by having a soulmate.

30:30.060 --> 30:31.380
They're just attractive people

30:31.380 --> 30:34.180
who are attracted to whoever, I guess.

30:34.180 --> 30:35.780
I suppose the argument could be made

30:35.780 --> 30:38.140
for Beckinsale's character needing something

30:38.140 --> 30:39.940
after she thinks Affleck is dead

30:39.940 --> 30:43.260
and she falls head over ass into bed with Josh Hartnett.

30:43.260 --> 30:45.180
But it's like, personally,

30:45.180 --> 30:47.620
if I see someone filling the gap of their dead lover

30:47.620 --> 30:49.140
with his best friend,

30:49.140 --> 30:51.580
I mean, it's not that that can't be compelling content,

30:51.580 --> 30:54.460
it would make for some great Real Housewives drama.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.500
You f***ing whore!

30:56.500 --> 30:58.180
You f***ing whore!

30:58.180 --> 31:01.020
A guy in my f***ing ass!

31:01.020 --> 31:02.180
You f***ing whore!

31:02.180 --> 31:04.060
But I'm not watching this and going,

31:04.060 --> 31:07.540
oh man, I hope these crazy kids make it through the war.

31:07.540 --> 31:09.300
Like, as an audience member,

31:09.300 --> 31:11.780
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to feel here.

31:11.780 --> 31:13.300
But I just wanna know why.

31:13.300 --> 31:14.540
So throughout Pearl Harbor,

31:14.540 --> 31:16.780
the love story feels incredibly hollow.

31:16.780 --> 31:19.740
Nothing is at stake if they go back to their old lives.

31:19.740 --> 31:21.780
And for Beckinsale, it basically reads like,

31:21.780 --> 31:24.300
well, at least now I've got a spare

31:24.300 --> 31:26.420
for when one gets killed in action,

31:26.420 --> 31:29.340
which of course, unlike Rose and Jack,

31:29.340 --> 31:31.380
where there is real stakes to their relationship

31:31.380 --> 31:34.380
outside of, you know, young love for both of them,

31:34.380 --> 31:36.580
but particularly for Rose.

31:36.580 --> 31:40.500
Sooner or later, that fire that I love about you, Rose,

31:40.500 --> 31:42.220
that fire is gonna burn out.

31:42.220 --> 31:44.380
But upon rewatch, the most remarkable thing to me

31:44.380 --> 31:47.300
about Pearl Harbor is that it completely drops the ball

31:47.300 --> 31:49.660
at the thing Titanic nails.

31:49.700 --> 31:53.340
We, the audience, don't really care about the ships.

31:53.340 --> 31:55.100
It was a symbolic strike, yes,

31:55.100 --> 31:56.500
but the Japanese at Pearl Harbor

31:56.500 --> 31:59.580
weren't attacking civilians, sailors, or soldiers.

31:59.580 --> 32:01.940
They were attacking the fleet,

32:01.940 --> 32:03.060
which is another thing I hate,

32:03.060 --> 32:06.540
the bombers going after civilians and the hospital.

32:06.540 --> 32:08.340
Okay, okay, we're not gonna go there.

32:08.340 --> 32:10.500
So surely there must have been some way

32:10.500 --> 32:12.460
for the audience to really appreciate

32:12.460 --> 32:15.900
the grandeur of these boats before they get destroyed.

32:15.900 --> 32:19.540
You know, make us care about the fleet before you sink it.

32:20.420 --> 32:21.860
Get out!

32:21.860 --> 32:23.500
Pearl Harbor rips off Titanic

32:23.500 --> 32:25.340
just enough to be frustrating,

32:25.340 --> 32:28.620
but it misses what makes those elements in Titanic work,

32:28.620 --> 32:31.500
that it succeeds in making you care about the ship itself,

32:31.500 --> 32:33.380
and it makes you care about the love story,

32:33.380 --> 32:35.740
in no small part because they are intertwined.

32:35.740 --> 32:39.980
When the ship docks, I'm getting off with you.

32:45.180 --> 32:47.660
So in light of the fact that Broadway is shuttered

32:47.660 --> 32:50.580
and will remain so for a long time,

32:50.580 --> 32:54.060
I saw Hadestown again recently for my podcast,

32:54.060 --> 32:55.700
and at the time, seeing it yet again,

32:55.700 --> 32:57.420
I felt kind of gratuitous,

32:57.420 --> 33:00.260
like I was being really extravagant,

33:00.260 --> 33:02.060
I don't need to do this,

33:02.060 --> 33:04.380
and I don't think I would have felt that way

33:04.380 --> 33:09.300
if I had known that there was about to be no more theater.

33:09.300 --> 33:11.580
But the thing I love the most about Hadestown

33:11.580 --> 33:13.700
is it's a story that, you know,

33:13.700 --> 33:16.100
is brave enough to have a tragic ending,

33:16.140 --> 33:19.220
but also takes the time to really explore

33:19.220 --> 33:22.460
the appeal of stories with tragic endings.

33:22.460 --> 33:25.380
I hear that I've been shown

33:25.380 --> 33:28.300
That's only not so

33:28.300 --> 33:31.300
I'm coming

33:31.300 --> 33:33.100
The musical Hadestown is a retelling

33:33.100 --> 33:35.140
of the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice,

33:35.140 --> 33:38.540
and if you aren't familiar with the myth of Orpheus,

33:38.540 --> 33:40.500
it ends tragically.

33:40.500 --> 33:42.420
But the remarkable thing about this musical

33:42.420 --> 33:44.100
is as you're watching it,

33:44.100 --> 33:46.220
it invests far more in the love story

33:46.220 --> 33:47.860
than the original myth ever could,

33:47.860 --> 33:49.540
and by the end, it makes you believe that,

33:49.540 --> 33:50.660
like Jack and Rose,

33:50.660 --> 33:53.580
those crazy kids might actually make it out this time.

33:53.580 --> 33:54.500
And if you know the myth,

33:54.500 --> 33:56.260
but this is your first time seeing the musical,

33:56.260 --> 33:58.860
it genuinely draws you in and makes you wonder,

33:58.860 --> 34:00.740
are they actually gonna change the ending?

34:00.740 --> 34:04.140
Because that's kind of where it feels like it's going.

34:04.140 --> 34:05.140
They don't.

34:05.140 --> 34:07.420
But there is more to Hadestown than the tragic ending.

34:07.420 --> 34:09.060
It uses that ending to demonstrate

34:09.060 --> 34:10.540
the narrative appeal of tragedy,

34:10.540 --> 34:12.180
and why certain stories get told

34:12.180 --> 34:14.100
and retold over and over again.

34:14.100 --> 34:17.900
A well-told tragedy appeals to the human desire to hope.

34:17.900 --> 34:19.660
And every time you watch Titanic,

34:19.660 --> 34:21.980
or hell, every time I watch one of those

34:21.980 --> 34:25.220
Titanic sinks-in-real-time simulations on YouTube,

34:25.220 --> 34:28.460
of which I have watched all of them,

34:28.460 --> 34:29.300
there's this part of you

34:29.300 --> 34:32.180
that sees the ship approaching the iceberg and goes like,

34:33.020 --> 34:38.020
Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

34:45.660 --> 34:47.500
Like even 23-odd years later,

34:47.500 --> 34:49.020
there's still tension there

34:49.020 --> 34:51.460
because you still kind of hope

34:51.460 --> 34:53.340
that this time they might get out of it.

34:53.340 --> 34:56.420
But even upon rewatch, you still feel that story tension.

34:56.420 --> 34:57.860
And you don't leave feeling upset

34:57.860 --> 35:01.580
because the tragic ending is a satisfying one.

35:01.580 --> 35:04.580
When Rose either goes to sleep or dies at the end,

35:04.580 --> 35:08.100
debate that, not the stupid door.

35:08.100 --> 35:09.660
And she is spiritually reunited

35:09.660 --> 35:11.420
with everyone who died on the ship.

35:17.780 --> 35:19.140
Gets me every time.

35:24.820 --> 35:27.060
We chose this topic as we were developing

35:27.060 --> 35:29.580
a different topic that was more topical,

35:29.620 --> 35:33.540
but also more heavy and a little too heavy

35:33.540 --> 35:35.340
considering the circumstances.

35:35.340 --> 35:36.180
What?

35:42.620 --> 35:44.900
And when we found ourselves much more drawn

35:44.900 --> 35:46.740
to wallowing in nostalgia

35:46.740 --> 35:48.820
than examining the current state of things,

35:48.820 --> 35:50.180
we thought, hey,

35:50.180 --> 35:53.180
maybe that's what the people need right now instead.

35:53.180 --> 35:56.260
The trash pile is where we live, and that's fine.

35:56.260 --> 35:58.100
But even still, this episode was difficult to write

35:58.100 --> 36:01.540
because writing about how a thing is good, actually,

36:01.540 --> 36:04.940
especially one that nerds don't universally agree on,

36:04.940 --> 36:06.980
is surprisingly hard to articulate.

36:06.980 --> 36:09.020
And I think because, especially on YouTube,

36:09.020 --> 36:11.220
it puts you in a defensive position,

36:11.220 --> 36:13.820
and that in and of itself is harder to write.

36:13.820 --> 36:14.820
But more importantly,

36:14.820 --> 36:17.540
it's also what YouTube's algorithm recommends

36:17.540 --> 36:19.620
and what people want to watch.

36:19.620 --> 36:23.460
Thing bad content tends to get way more views.

36:23.460 --> 36:25.620
But moreover, you're also opening yourself up

36:25.620 --> 36:27.900
to vulnerability and points of attack.

36:28.660 --> 36:29.500
As one example,

36:29.500 --> 36:30.900
and this is not even something I said on YouTube,

36:30.900 --> 36:34.220
I said a nice thing about someone else's book,

36:34.220 --> 36:37.860
a very popular and award-winning book at that,

36:37.860 --> 36:40.100
in an interview for Newsweek.

36:40.100 --> 36:41.940
And I saw in a Reddit thread

36:41.940 --> 36:45.020
saying that said book that I said the nice thing about

36:45.020 --> 36:47.380
was not good, actually.

36:47.380 --> 36:49.940
And if I say that the thing is good

36:49.940 --> 36:51.980
when in fact the thing is not good,

36:51.980 --> 36:56.980
then we can extrapolate that my book is probably also bad.

36:56.980 --> 36:58.100
And some of you will think it is,

36:58.100 --> 36:58.940
that's just how it works,

36:58.940 --> 36:59.780
and that's beside the point.

36:59.780 --> 37:01.260
It's amazing how in criticism,

37:01.260 --> 37:03.820
your likes can be a bigger strike against your credibility

37:03.820 --> 37:05.140
than your dislikes,

37:05.140 --> 37:08.380
especially here on YouTube.com,

37:08.380 --> 37:11.860
where liking thing is for stupids.

37:11.860 --> 37:13.620
And of course, we do have to write with a mind

37:13.620 --> 37:14.660
towards the algorithm.

37:14.660 --> 37:16.860
Negativity just gets more views.

37:16.860 --> 37:18.580
So for those of you who like to leave

37:18.580 --> 37:20.140
don't you like anything comments,

37:20.140 --> 37:23.460
I refer you to Jim Sterling's video on the same topic.

37:23.460 --> 37:25.500
It is surprisingly difficult to create content

37:25.500 --> 37:27.100
that will hit with a wide audience

37:27.100 --> 37:29.340
while not also being thing bad,

37:29.340 --> 37:31.700
which is partially why in my old age,

37:31.700 --> 37:34.740
I'm more and more appreciative of films like Titanic.

37:34.740 --> 37:37.740
Widely popular while also being sincere

37:37.740 --> 37:39.060
and generally hopeful.

37:39.060 --> 37:41.100
Who are you arrogant man

37:41.100 --> 37:43.540
to call yourself the king of the world?

37:43.540 --> 37:44.620
I'm the king of the world.

37:44.620 --> 37:46.180
I'm the king of the world.

37:46.180 --> 37:47.020
Woo!

37:48.020 --> 37:50.500
I think you're not.

37:50.500 --> 37:55.260
Man, remember when James Cameron got canceled for that?

37:55.900 --> 37:56.940
Woo!

37:56.940 --> 37:59.340
James Cameron got canceled for quoting his own movie

37:59.340 --> 38:00.460
at the Academy Awards

38:00.460 --> 38:02.380
and Kate Winslet got fat shamed.

38:02.380 --> 38:03.460
Man, fuck the 90s.

38:03.460 --> 38:05.060
So I'm not saying that I'm not doing

38:05.060 --> 38:06.980
thing bad style content anymore

38:06.980 --> 38:10.620
because frankly, it is often fun to write.

38:10.620 --> 38:11.620
10 years old.

38:18.620 --> 38:20.020
But it is an interesting challenge

38:20.020 --> 38:21.700
to do more exploratory topics,

38:21.700 --> 38:25.100
or in this case, thing good content.

38:25.940 --> 38:28.180
And who better to emulate in that regard

38:28.180 --> 38:30.020
than James Cameron?

38:30.020 --> 38:30.860
Woo!

38:34.220 --> 38:38.620
In many ways, the work of a critic is easy.

38:38.620 --> 38:40.660
We risk very little,

38:40.660 --> 38:42.940
yet enjoy a position over those

38:42.940 --> 38:46.940
who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment.

38:46.940 --> 38:49.580
We thrive on negative criticism,

38:49.580 --> 38:52.700
which is fun to write and to read.

38:52.740 --> 38:54.660
In the grand scheme of things,

38:54.660 --> 38:58.860
the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful

38:58.860 --> 39:01.740
than our criticism designating it so.

39:06.940 --> 39:08.260
So you remember like six months ago

39:08.260 --> 39:09.420
when I said this is going to be

39:09.420 --> 39:14.420
the shameless self-promotion section of the channel?

39:15.540 --> 39:17.220
Well, guess what month it is.

39:18.180 --> 39:20.140
This was supposed to be a lot more fun.

39:23.700 --> 39:25.660
This is all your fault.

39:47.220 --> 39:48.060
That's it.

39:48.060 --> 39:48.900
That's all she wrote.

39:49.020 --> 39:51.180
I'm the king of the world!

39:53.180 --> 39:54.020
Julian!

39:54.020 --> 39:55.420
You shut up!

39:55.420 --> 39:56.620
Shut up!

39:56.620 --> 40:00.220
Now let's knock this motherfucker out of the park!

40:01.940 --> 40:04.060
Wear it until you love it!

40:04.060 --> 40:06.860
Where is my beautiful sister?

40:08.860 --> 40:09.700
Fuck you!

40:09.700 --> 40:10.540
Wait, bro!

40:10.540 --> 40:13.460
Fuck you and all your hateful people!

40:13.460 --> 40:14.780
God damn it!

40:14.780 --> 40:15.620
Ah!

40:15.620 --> 40:16.460
Ah!

40:16.460 --> 40:17.300
Ah!

40:17.340 --> 40:18.180
Ah!

40:18.180 --> 40:19.020
Ah!

40:19.020 --> 40:19.860
Ah!

40:19.860 --> 40:20.700
Ah!

40:20.700 --> 40:21.540
Ah!

40:21.540 --> 40:22.380
Ah!

40:22.380 --> 40:23.220
Ah!

40:23.220 --> 40:24.940
Sit in there like a fucking baboon!

40:24.940 --> 40:25.780
No, no, no!

40:25.780 --> 40:27.580
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do!

40:27.580 --> 40:29.140
I hate fucking whiskey, son!

40:29.140 --> 40:31.140
I couldn't stop at fucking three or four!

40:31.140 --> 40:31.980
I hate!

40:33.100 --> 40:35.980
I defy you stars!
