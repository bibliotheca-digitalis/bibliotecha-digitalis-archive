1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
Thank you, Buford.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,400
Well, hello.

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,240
It is time for a hot take,

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,200
and I think it is simply that

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,120
Titanic is good, actually.

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,240
James Cameron is a very specific type of genius

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,040
that all nerds kind of wish they were,

8
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,080
and I imagine that is why so many people

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,680
are so eager to hate this guy,

10
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,620
and not just because of his not-so-secret reputation

11
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,120
of being a tremendous asshole.

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,880
And I'm going to demonstrate this particular brand of genius

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,040
by drawing a comparison to, of course,

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:32,880
what else?

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,240
Phantom of the Opera.

16
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,080
No, no, please don't leave.

17
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,800
I swear this isn't a bait-and-switch about Phantom.

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,640
I'll keep it short.

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,640
A good production of Phantom of the Opera

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,000
will have you responding to the actors,

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,400
as is the case with the 25th anniversary cast,

22
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,800
and the chemistry between the actors

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,840
nearly sucking their souls out of each other's bodies

24
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,760
from the sheer intensity of it,

25
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,880
more than the flashy set pieces.

26
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,880
This lies in contrast with the most recent

27
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,120
and umpteenth time I saw Phantom on Broadway

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,920
earlier this year for my podcast,

29
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,760
where the cast was so lacking in everything

30
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,240
that the biggest reaction slash applause from the audience

31
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,800
were for the set pieces, not for the actors.

32
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,720
The audience applauded for the chandelier,

33
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,520
they applauded for some of the stunts

34
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,600
and the badly-aged pyrotechnics,

35
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,440
but for the actors,

36
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,440
it was more of an applause of obligation, if at all.

37
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,160
In fact, there was hardly even a standing ovation,

38
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,320
and I never see begrudging standing ovations

39
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,040
at Broadway shows anymore, at least in the before time.

40
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,820
And if they enjoyed the spectacle,

41
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,020
that's fine, that's whatever,

42
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,500
but if they didn't connect with the actors,

43
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,540
if they didn't connect with the performers,

44
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,820
then that's not going to make the thing stick with people.

45
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,700
Which brings us to Titanic,

46
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,540
a film so wrapped up in spectacle,

47
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,700
it's kind of hard to imagine that James Cameron

48
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,500
had any room in his brain for anything but spectacle.

49
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,860
But people came for the spectacle,

50
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,100
they did not stay for the spectacle,

51
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,420
they stayed for the story, the characters,

52
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,700
the je ne sais quoi, the iconic love story.

53
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,140
This requires skill.

54
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,580
And it is iconic.

55
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,500
The film still lives strong in our lexicon,

56
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,100
the meme's immortal.

57
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:12,100
Kate Winslet, DiCaprio, perfectly fine.

58
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,460
We have no choice but to stand.

59
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,860
Compare Titanic to Avatar,

60
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,780
which despite what the Walt Disney Company

61
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,980
would have you believe.

62
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,300
Now everyone, including me,

63
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,500
who has ever dreamed of visiting this extraordinary world,

64
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,780
can explore its astonishing landscape.

65
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,140
Usually, Sudlucid's a lukewarm meh

66
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,940
from people when you bring it up,

67
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,180
except for dads.

68
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,180
Maybe they remember like the special effects

69
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,260
or the 3D or Bill Wellington,

70
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,220
Chris Cumberbatch, you know,

71
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,900
that guy that was in the movies in 2010.

72
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,540
But there's not much memorable about the story itself.

73
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,100
When people think about Avatar,

74
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,740
they think of the technology upon which it was hyped.

75
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,340
And then they probably make a blue Pocahontas joke.

76
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,540
There are those who are kind of

77
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,980
into the world-building elements,

78
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,020
I think, I can't tell how ironic this is,

79
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,100
and I actually know her.

80
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,460
But no one is terribly invested

81
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,100
in the story of Jake, Sully, and Neytiri.

82
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,900
But with Cameron, up until his slip

83
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,940
really started to show with Avatar,

84
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:12,740
he was very good at balancing spectacle with story,

85
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,740
but up until Titanic, usually giving the edge to spectacle,

86
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,620
because that seemed to be more where his interests lie.

87
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,660
In the case of Titanic,

88
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,700
it was the biggest spectacle in cinematic history.

89
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,060
But at the end of the day, the story is what remains.

90
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,020
It is what sticks with people.

91
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,300
Cameron has done this before

92
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,020
by turning his love of deep-sea diving

93
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,580
into the 1989 film, The Abyss.

94
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,620
A lesser-known Cameron joined about deep-sea aliens,

95
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,700
but that fixation on deep-sea diving leapfrogged

96
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,780
eventually into a fixation

97
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,940
on the newly rediscovered Titanic in the 1990s.

98
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,220
Cameron spent a ton of his own fortune

99
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,700
on diving in Titanic stuff.

100
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,420
And, you know, I've always been interested in the ocean.

101
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,140
So there's a certain transition point

102
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,420
where I realized I was heading toward

103
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,500
making a film on that subject.

104
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,380
And before long, like so many YouTubers after him,

105
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,220
he looked at his greatest interest and thought,

106
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,860
hey, I could monetize this.

107
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,020
Turn down for what?

108
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,700
And so monetize it he did,

109
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,820
with one of the most expensive, remarkable,

110
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,140
and memorable movies of all time, Titanic.

111
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,100
I'm the king of the world!

112
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,540
Whoa!

113
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,100
But the remarkable thing about Titanic

114
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,820
within the Cameron canon,

115
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,140
the first thing that people think about

116
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,380
is not the spectacle, a la the Alien Queen in Aliens

117
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,180
or the T-1000 in Terminator 2,

118
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,540
but for better or worse,

119
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,860
it is the characters, the story.

120
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,900
They think about, draw me like one of your French girls.

121
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,380
They think about, I'm flying.

122
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,260
They think about, I'm the king of the world.

123
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,140
About, it's been 84 years.

124
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,780
They think of putting the diamond in the coat

125
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,260
and putting the coat on her.

126
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,500
The story still trumps the spectacle in the cultural canon,

127
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,780
which is why it's so odd to me

128
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,780
that creeping up on a quarter century later,

129
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,860
there are so many people still insisting

130
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,420
that Titanic is bad, actually.

131
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,780
But I'm not just here to argue

132
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,020
that Titanic is good, actually.

133
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,940
Oh no, I am here to argue that Titanic is actually

134
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,260
one of the greatest cinematic achievements in history,

135
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,140
that it did deserve all of the awards and acclaim.

136
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,820
And no, it did not deserve

137
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,340
that big, dumb, stupid, giant backlash,

138
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,860
one of the biggest ever and one of the most influential.

139
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,340
A backlash so fierce that never again

140
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,700
would the popular thing be allowed

141
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,740
in the same paddock with the high art thing.

142
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,260
No Best Picture nomination for you, Dark Knight.

143
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,380
A segregation of pop art and high art so severe

144
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,580
that the Academy eventually had to expand

145
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,100
the Best Picture category back out to 10 nominations

146
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,020
because could we please get

147
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,700
some popular stuff nominated again?

148
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,540
Please.

149
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,060
So following in the footsteps of those intrepid divers

150
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,700
alongside James Cameron who rediscovered

151
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,140
the wreckage of the great ship,

152
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:04,060
I am here to dive down and rescue Titanic's reputation

153
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,020
as a cinematic great before it gets eaten

154
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,500
by the iron-eaten bacteria

155
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,820
of this incredibly mixed metaphor.

156
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,180
♪♪

157
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,420
Titanic is one of those movies that,

158
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,500
when I feel like people try to articulate

159
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,180
what they don't like about it,

160
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,260
they tend to be grasping at straws

161
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,500
or declaring certain elements to be subpar

162
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,860
when I'm like, am I missing something?

163
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,900
Did we watch the same movie?

164
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,980
This is fine.

165
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,420
Like Leonardo DiCaprio's acting, for instance.

166
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,140
It's a perfectly fine use of your DiCaprio.

167
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,020
With all due respect, miss,

168
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,100
I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship here.

169
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,140
We know what bad DiCaprio looks like.

170
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,060
And your love has meant nothing to either of us.

171
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,780
No, no!

172
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,620
Watch them!

173
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,500
First of all, my own brother's trying to do this to me!

174
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,900
Surrender now!

175
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,740
No!

176
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,820
Wear it until you love it!

177
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,500
This is not bad DiCaprio.

178
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,260
The basis of most of the criticisms

179
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,740
seems to be based on story is simple

180
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,740
or characters are simple

181
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,020
or wow, such melodrama.

182
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,220
But that said, Titanic is about as complex

183
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,500
as any other mass-appealed blockbuster.

184
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,380
Neither its characters nor its writing

185
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,100
are remarkable in this regard compared to other movies.

186
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,220
Same with the characters.

187
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,900
Are you of the Boston Dawsons?

188
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,940
No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons.

189
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,860
No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.

190
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,700
Oh, yes.

191
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,140
Jack Dawson gets more backstory

192
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,500
than generally agreed upon good characters

193
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,380
like everyone in Jurassic Park.

194
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,580
What's your backstory, Alan Grant?

195
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,940
We're going to find out why you don't like kids?

196
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,780
Oh, wait, who cares?

197
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,620
It doesn't matter.

198
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,540
And then there's the criticism

199
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,020
that the film is melodramatic,

200
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,020
which I also find odd

201
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,100
because the melodrama of the situation

202
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,340
is why we remember the Titanic disaster at all.

203
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,500
It was the largest moving object in the world

204
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,380
built by human hands at the time,

205
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,900
as well as the apex of Edwardian glamour.

206
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,260
It was to be the captain's last voyage before he retired,

207
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,460
and the ship sank on its maiden voyage.

208
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,500
Any publisher would throw that concept out

209
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,700
for being way too over the top

210
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,460
if it had not actually happened.

211
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,660
It is a fundamentally melodramatic historical event,

212
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,860
so there's not really anything tonally off

213
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,940
about having a big emotions romantic epic

214
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,980
on board the ship right before it sinks.

215
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,340
Simplicity, likewise, is a fine line to walk.

216
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,060
A storyline might feel simple

217
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,300
after you've watched a movie 400 times,

218
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,900
but one must also consider

219
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,580
how a story lands to a first-time audience,

220
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,500
as well as repeat viewers.

221
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,860
Not to be that guy, but now that, like...

222
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,420
I'm a writer now.

223
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,020
But after I sold my first book,

224
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,660
available July 21st, pre-order link in the description,

225
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,740
a huge component of the revisions

226
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,700
were simplifying the mysteries what get revealed

227
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,100
and clarifying world-building and plot elements

228
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,620
that I had thought were pretty clear,

229
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,380
but were reading as confusing to first-time readers,

230
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,820
like my editor and my literary agent.

231
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,060
So simplicity and clarity is harder to do

232
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,260
than you might think,

233
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,500
and more complex does not equal more good.

234
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,540
In the case of Titanic, the main love story,

235
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,660
star-crossed lovers of different class who meet,

236
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,420
fall in love, and then one of them dies,

237
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,620
is fairly simple,

238
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,140
in the same way that Romeo and Juliet is fairly simple

239
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,100
if you reduce it to its core components.

240
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,260
I defy you stars!

241
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,540
But it has to balance its bulk

242
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,740
with a bunch of other subplots,

243
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,300
both with tying in the two mains

244
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,340
and with the fate of the ship itself.

245
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,260
So the film needs to walk a fine line.

246
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,300
Spectacle versus emotional core,

247
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,260
melodrama versus absurdity,

248
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,700
sincerity versus irony,

249
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,500
and all the while appeal to as many people as possible.

250
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,260
Cameron himself described his script

251
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,220
as intentionally incorporating universals

252
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,700
of human experience and emotion

253
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,340
that are timeless and familiar

254
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,140
because they reflect our basic emotional fabric.

255
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,500
And all the while I feel I'm

256
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,300
standing in the middle of a crowded room

257
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,060
screaming at the top of my lungs

258
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,700
and no one even looks up.

259
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,260
In response to the accusation that the film is cliche,

260
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,100
Cameron said,

261
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,500
LA Times critic Kenneth Turan mistakes archetypes

262
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,660
for cliche.

263
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,300
I don't share his view that the best scripts

264
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,580
are only the ones that explore

265
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,260
the perimeter of human experience

266
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,660
or flashly pirouette their witty and cynical dialogue

267
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,060
for our admiration.

268
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,780
You dropped this, King.

269
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,100
It's from my masterpiece, Starscream,

270
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,660
it's the only crown I have.

271
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,580
And of course the mere audacity of that attempt

272
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,500
is a strike against the movie's favor.

273
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,580
It's trying to be populist trash.

274
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,620
Which leads us to another common criticism,

275
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,620
that the film is too base.

276
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,700
The swill of the common folk.

277
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,060
Like that is a bug and not a feature.

278
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,340
There is a sort of classism

279
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,300
inherent to criticisms like this.

280
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,220
In effect, it's too many people like this.

281
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,060
Which one sees reflected in the criticism

282
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,260
that Cameron's Titanic valorizes the third class

283
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,700
and demonizes the first class.

284
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,380
My favorite bad Titanic take

285
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,140
comes from historian Richard Davenport Hind,

286
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:49,980
who wrote,

287
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,740
Cameron's film diabolized rich Americans

288
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,500
and educated English,

289
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,380
anathematizing their emotional restraint,

290
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,620
good tailoring,

291
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,100
punctilious manners,

292
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,700
and grammatical training,

293
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,660
while it made romantic heroes

294
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,500
of the poor Irish and the unlettered.

295
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,980
Wow.

296
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,380
But the thing about popular and low art

297
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,060
is that given enough time,

298
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,940
history often reframes it as high art.

299
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,500
Shakespeare, Puccini, Dickens,

300
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,780
even the novel itself,

301
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,460
all started off as popular art

302
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,380
that only got reframed as high art in retrospect.

303
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,980
So popular art that hits with a wide audience,

304
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,820
difficult to do,

305
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,820
but popular art that stands the test of time,

306
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,740
even harder.

307
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,100
There's truth, but no logic.

308
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,380
What's the artist's name?

309
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,820
Something Picasso.

310
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,340
Even Empire Magazine originally gave the film five stars,

311
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,900
then later revised it down to four after the backlash,

312
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,060
and then eventually revised it back up to five

313
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:46,980
when they realized

314
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,580
that they were basically peer pressured

315
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,940
into giving it a bad review.

316
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,540
So I feel like the eagerness that some film people have

317
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,780
to distance themselves from Titanic

318
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,620
isn't really out of a desire to assess the quality

319
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,140
or impact of the film,

320
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,100
but to tiptoe around the backlash that followed it.

321
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,820
And even if you're too young to remember the backlash,

322
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,820
you can still probably feel it in the atmosphere.

323
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,580
Like saying that one of the most successful movies

324
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,700
in history is good, actually,

325
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,780
is a ding against your credibility.

326
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,380
Are the masses really that stupid

327
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,540
that if they like the thing,

328
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,340
it must be because the thing is bad, actually?

329
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,780
Well, if one must descend into the trash pile

330
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,100
in order to admit that we enjoy the thing,

331
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,740
then this is where we live now.

332
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,300
So we're not going outside anytime soon.

333
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,660
♪♪

334
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,060
Why this shipwreck?

335
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,060
You know, why not the Lusitania?

336
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,500
Why not the Morrow Castle?

337
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,140
Why not the Atlantic?

338
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,860
I mean, you've got, you know, the biggest ship in the world.

339
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,100
It's on its maiden voyage.

340
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,260
You've got the president of the company on board that owns it.

341
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,060
You've got the builder on board.

342
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,260
And it hits an iceberg, and it sinks so slowly

343
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,580
that you've got all these hours

344
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,340
for all this drama to be acted out.

345
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,940
But there's way more to it than the drama of it all.

346
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,460
The time period in which it happened

347
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,620
is also, of course, relevant.

348
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,900
The Edwardian era, and yes, this counts,

349
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,140
was the last before the advent of modern warfare.

350
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,820
With World War I came all of this

351
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,820
senseless death and carnage.

352
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:16,460
Then World War II, where a solid 3% of all of humanity died.

353
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,860
Then the nuclear age.

354
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,420
And, of course, the sword of Damocles

355
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,180
that hangs over us to this day, climate change.

356
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,660
So it's almost like a simpler world

357
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,260
went down with the boat.

358
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,940
A more civilized world.

359
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,100
A more glamorous world.

360
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,420
It's always oversimplifying to say it was a simpler time

361
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,340
or a more innocent time,

362
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,540
but that is kind of what it felt like.

363
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,740
Similar to Downton Abbey,

364
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,740
which basically captures the last gasps of aristocracy

365
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,500
before World War I in England.

366
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,900
Do we know anyone on board?

367
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,060
Your mother knows the Astors, at least she knows him.

368
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,700
Titanic does the same.

369
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,980
Yes, class stratification and inequality

370
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,660
are still major things today,

371
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,820
but there's no glamour to the social lives

372
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,420
of, like, Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates.

373
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,500
So you're saying you teach them that they have chores?

374
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,340
Yeah. They have chores.

375
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,180
Your kids have chores.

376
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,020
Yeah, they have responsibilities.

377
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,340
They have chores, they have responsibilities.

378
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,660
Now, flaunting your wealth

379
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,380
is what the kids call a bad look.

380
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,860
Cameron was far from being the first or only person

381
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,380
to wring the entertainment potential

382
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,940
out of this tragedy of errors.

383
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,940
In fact, it was only weeks after the ship sank

384
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,300
that studios around the world

385
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,060
began producing dramatized films.

386
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,740
One notable being the silent short

387
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,940
Saved From the Titanic released a cool 29 days

388
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,780
after the shipwreck

389
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,140
and starring a survivor of the disaster, Dorothy Gibson.

390
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,460
But the heyday for the Titanic dramatization

391
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,780
came in the 1950s.

392
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,260
There was a 1953 Barbara Stanwyck film

393
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,460
simply called Titanic,

394
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,820
which is a wildly inaccurate,

395
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,420
fanciful piece of fan fiction.

396
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:45,420
♪ River, why don't you be ♪

397
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,460
♪ River, why don't you be ♪

398
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,780
♪ River, why don't you be ♪

399
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,060
But hey, you know, it made money

400
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,660
and walked away with the best screenplay Oscar.

401
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,980
And it paved the road for A Night to Remember,

402
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,940
widely considered the more historically accurate

403
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,300
of the bunch and easily the film

404
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,340
with the greatest influence on Cameron's version.

405
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,860
It's kind of like how Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame

406
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,420
is really more of a remake of the 1939 Hunchback of Notre Dame

407
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,300
than an adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel.

408
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,820
Hell, even the Nazis made their own propaganda version

409
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,020
of Titanic.

410
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,900
And this version took the narrative of J. Bruce Ismay,

411
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,740
wealthy coward who survived,

412
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,540
and turned him into an evil, greedy Jew

413
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,020
who was also a coward that survived.

414
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,340
Because of course they did.

415
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,420
And as a side note, perhaps the person done dirtiest

416
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,020
by history and dramatized versions of Titanic

417
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,140
is J. Bruce Ismay, who was the highest ranking official

418
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,580
on board the Titanic who actually survived.

419
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,500
And he's the guy in the movie

420
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,700
he's pushing the captain to make the boat go faster.

421
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,540
The person is the size of Titanic.

422
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,100
Now I want them to marvel at her speed.

423
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,020
In real life, Ismay was not the living embodiment of hubris.

424
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,740
While he did get on the last lifeboat,

425
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,740
he was not the last man on the Titanic.

426
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,580
He was the last man on the Titanic.

427
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,260
While he did get on the last lifeboat,

428
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,620
there is little evidence to support

429
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,940
that he actually ordered the Titanic to go faster.

430
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,620
Most of the people who saw him on the boat

431
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,740
actually testified that he helped save people

432
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,620
and only hopped in the boat

433
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,220
because there were no women and children around

434
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,100
to take the space.

435
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,100
And a lot of the Ismay hearsay was established

436
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,500
by William Randolph Hearst, who hated Ismay.

437
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,460
And Cameron knew this, so why include it?

438
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,540
Well, because according to Cameron,

439
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,060
people expected to see it.

440
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,420
And so he's here in this role

441
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,500
to play to people's expectations,

442
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,900
to give them what they want.

443
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,820
The 90s resurgence of Titanic interest

444
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,500
most likely came about as a result

445
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,820
of the wreckage being discovered.

446
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,820
There was a TV miniseries from 1996

447
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,140
starring Catherine Zeta-Jones

448
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,100
in a role quite similar to Rose.

449
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,140
Just breathe, darling.

450
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,540
Just show them you can breathe, darling.

451
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,420
Just breathe, just breathe.

452
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,340
There was a musical from 1997 called Titanic,

453
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,620
a new musical written by Maury Yeston

454
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,340
and Arthur Coppett of nine fame

455
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,500
and this proto phantom.

456
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,060
And while this musical swept a very low energy

457
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,020
Tony Award season, winning five awards,

458
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,140
including best musical, it ranks pretty high

459
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,140
on my hunch the musical scale of musicals.

460
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,140
♪ I've got a hunch this is love ♪

461
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,900
♪ Love ♪

462
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,980
It wasn't that historical movies

463
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:24,100
were or were not particularly big in the 90s.

464
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,860
For every Braveheart and Dances with Wolves,

465
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,540
you had big disappointments like Far and Away

466
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,940
and Cutthroat Island.

467
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,060
And history is increasingly unkind

468
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,620
to the former two examples.

469
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,940

I said run!

00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,140
John!

474
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,380
But the more relevant context for which the period

475
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,900
in which Titanic was made wasn't period pieces,

476
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,180
it was.

477
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,900
♪ I've got a hunch this is love ♪

478
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,580
There are different cycles for nostalgia

479
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,940
and so far the ones we've discussed that are relevant

480
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,300
to Titanic have been 40-year cycles,

481
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,220
with a big resurgence of interest in the 1950s

482
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,540
and then again in the 1990s.

483
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,940
But arguably the most consistently lucrative

484
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,620
nostalgia cycle is the 20-year cycle,

485
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,180
because generally it applies to a demographic

486
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,780
who are, you know, they're kinda getting settled in life,

487
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,220
getting married, having kids, buying houses.

488
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,260
That was a thing people our age did in the 90s.

489
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,060
And now they're, you know, feeling wistful

490
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,140
about their lost youth and they wanna go to the movies.

491
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,580
Think of how Grease, a huge hit released in the 70s,

492
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,140
was nostalgic for the 50s.

493
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,700
You have your Brady Bunch and all sorts of sitcom remakes

494
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,540
that were released in the 90s, nostalgic for the 70s.

495
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,820
Sure, Jan.

496
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,940
But also in the 90s we had the stylistic nostalgia cycle

497
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,540
for disaster movies.

498
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,180
In the 70s you had big hits like

499
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,340
Towering Inferno and Earthquake.

500
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,220
But in the 90s we had another resurgence,

501
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,820
not only with natural disaster movies

502
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,540
like Dante's Peak and Volcano, Deep Impact, Armageddon,

503
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,540
God, there were so many,

504
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,380
but we also had like alien invasions,

505
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,140
we had Independence Day,

506
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:07,140
any manner of way we can almost wipe out human civilization.

507
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,940
We were so bored in the 90s.

508
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,900
And right now we're on the verge of a 20-year cycle

509
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,660
for the 2000s as well,

510
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,660
which I intend on capitalizing shamelessly.

511
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,860
Link in the description.

512
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,140
It's a period piece.

513
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,500
Titanic was pitched as Romeo and Juliet,

514
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,860
but on the Titanic.

515
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,980
But the danger there is then it looks like

516
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,100
a movie for women's.

517
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,580
Look, is it a boy movie or a girl movie?

518
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,420
We have to choose.

519
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,300
And I could go into the convoluted nightmare

520
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,700
of the production of this movie

521
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,180
and how all signs pointed to failure,

522
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,380
but really that would deserve its own video.

523
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,300
By virtue of the fact that Cameron was a proven hit maker,

524
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,980
studios gave him a lot more money and freedom

525
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,980
than they would have to other directors,

526
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,420
which is partially why Titanic is allowed to

527
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,580
so completely inhabit both worlds,

528
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,140
both shamelessly romantic

529
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,980
and a textbook 90s disaster movie.

530
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,940
But because the studio was capping costs,

531
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,340
Titanic didn't have anything like

532
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,940
the marketing push we see in big movies today.

533
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,420
So a lot of its success really did kind of

534
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,580
come by word of mouth.

535
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,980
And the fact that for the most part,

536
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,140
Hollywood failed to repeat the success of Titanic,

537
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,260
and we'll get to that,

538
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,340
tells me that they never really understood

539
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,820
why it was a success in the first place.

540
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,700
I mean, attempts were made.

541
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,020
And I'll get to that in a minute.

542
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,380
But first, I would like to talk about.

543
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,540
♪♪

544
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,900
A lot of people joked at the time

545
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,860
about who would want to see a Titanic movie,

546
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,580
because, you know, we all know how it ends, right?

547
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,900
So within the text of the film,

548
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,820
the audience needs an incentive to engage with the story

549
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,140
outside of simply knowing how it ends.

550
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,340
See, previous Titanic movies or musicals

551
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,460
just told the story as a period piece.

552
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,300
But Cameron's film uses the modern day

553
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,780
and a self-insert character named Bill Paxton

554
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:51,820
as James Cameron's, if you'll excuse the term, avatar.

555
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,140
Meet Bill Paxton, played by Brock Lovett,

556
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,500
our James Cameron insert

557
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,100
who only cares about the money, not the science.

558
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,180
He's in it for the money, not the science.

559
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,300
He's in it for the glory,

560
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,700
but doesn't really understand the heart of the tragedy.

561
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,700
You know, he doesn't get it.

562
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,060
And that's where Rose comes in.

563
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,260
She's going to tell her story,

564
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,580
and then he's going to get it.

565
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,660
Part of the reason Titanic was such a hit

566
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,940
was because audiences were really starring

567
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,860
for deeply sincere emotional content.

568
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,020
But if you're going to go that route,

569
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,540
you can't just bust in with a high melodrama.

570
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,780
Look, it's the 90s, kids.

571
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,220
We are all irony poisoned.

572
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,740
The president is being impeached over

573
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,220
politics are for suckers and nothing matters.

574
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,900
But we are all deeply lonely.

575
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,860
The success of Titanic kind of reminds me

576
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,540
of Star Wars 20 years earlier.

577
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:35,580
The 70s weren't as irony poisoned as the 90s,

578
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,340
but the trend definitely rejected old Hollywood simplicity

579
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,740
or this epic tone that Star Wars was going for.

580
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,460
The assumption was that audiences

581
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,060
would be turned off by that approach,

582
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,500
when in reality, they were apparently starving for it.

583
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,500
A cowboy movie set in space.

584
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,020
That's Star Wars.

585
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,340
It's old-fashioned, escapist entertainment,

586
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,580
pure and simple, with no moral, no message.

587
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,940
And it appears this is what just about everybody

588
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,580
in the country is in the mood for.

589
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,420
So Titanic's framing device is important

590
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,860
in the context of a 90s movie in particular,

591
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,540
because by allowing for all of this eye rolling

592
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,980
and yeah, we know it's schmaltzy, but just roll with it.

593
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,260
It's easier for the audience to suspend their disbelief

594
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,500
or their irony in the case of the 90s and accept the story.

595
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,060
It takes about 25 minutes to get through

596
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,660
the framing device at the beginning.

597
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,220
And not only does it leave no doubt

598
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,580
as to how the story ends,

599
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,180
we know the ship sinks before the story proper even starts.

600
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,460
It also tells us the science of what is happening.

601
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,500
So when the ship does sink some two hours later,

602
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,020
you don't have the audience being like,

603
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,420
what the hell, when it breaks in half or sinks vertically.

604
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:44,540
The stern rises up, slow at first and faster and faster

605
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,340
until finally she's got her whole ass

606
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,340
sticking up in the air.

607
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,700
But moreover, the thing about a Titanic movie is,

608
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,020
I mean, the fact that we know how it ends

609
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,740
means you have to have a new main tension

610
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,380
rather than will the boat sink or not.

611
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,060
Instead of will the ship sink,

612
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,020
the narrative hooks are character-based.

613
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,100
We know Rose survives, but how?

614
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,540
And why has she kept her identity a secret?

615
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,740
What happened to Jack?

616
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,820
And where is that necklace anyway?

617
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,620
In the context of the framing device,

618
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,500
the necklace is what we call a MacGuffin.

619
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,340
Is it a-

620
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,180
Diamond, yes.

621
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,980
In simple terms, a MacGuffin is a thing

622
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,140
that drives the plot,

623
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,660
but it doesn't actually matter to the story.

624
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,060
Everybody wants the necklace because of course they do.

625
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,420
It's a thing we can fight over.

626
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,740
It's the reason Rose and Bill Paxton

627
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,980
meet in the first place.

628
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,580
But it doesn't actually matter to the story

629
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:31,220
because the story is about Jack and Rose, not the diamond.

630
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,420
Hence she throws it into the ocean at the end.

631
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:36,460
But now you know there was a man named Jack Dawson

632
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,780
and that he saved me

633
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,940
in every way that a person can be saved.

634
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,420
And it's stuff like this that leads to

635
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,060
a lot of really lame criticism

636
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,180
because all we have to do now

637
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,980
that it's the end times is logic the thing.

638
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,220
Like in the making of this video,

639
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,940
every time I tweeted about Titanic,

640
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,660
I got like 400 ats about the door or headboard

641
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,940
or whatever that thing is.

642
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,740
Like, Jack could have fit on there too.

643
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,060
They both could have fit on the head.

644
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,540
Like, way to miss the point, assholes.

645
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,820
Like there's even a really lame deleted scene

646
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,420
where they address this.

647
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,900
Just enough for this lady.

648
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,060
We'll push it under.

649
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,940
Let me try at least or I'll die soon.

650
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,580
You'll die sooner if you come any closer.

651
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,900
You see, we, the audience,

652
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,140
need to feel the weight of the loss here.

653
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,620
Not just the 1,500 randos that died,

654
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,340
but the character that we've come to know

655
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,900
and care about for the last three hours.

656
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,540
So Jack sacrificing himself is a micro version

657
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,660
of what makes the story so remarkable.

658
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,500
Any room for a gentleman, gentlemen?

659
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,300
I don't need women at this time, sir.

660
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,700
Women and children first

661
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,340
wasn't an official policy by any stretch.

662
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,340
It was not maritime law.

663
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,020
It was more like the Pirate's Code

664
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,740
and Pirates of the Caribbean, more of a guideline.

665
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,220
So while in theory in a disaster situation,

666
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:50,300
the men folk would try to save the women and children first,

667
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,060
the reality is that women and children

668
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:55,260
were way less likely to survive shipwrecks.

669
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,740
And in practice, it was usually every man for himself.

670
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,660
The White Star Line's previous worst maritime disaster,

671
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,260
the sinking of the SS Atlantic,

672
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,660
lost more than half of its passengers when it sank

673
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,500
and every single woman on board

674
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,900
and all but one of the children died.

675
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,180
So the fact that the majority of Titanic survivors

676
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,500
were women and children is actually an extreme outlier.

677
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,460
So Jack giving up his spot for Rose

678
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,420
serves as synecdoche for the greater sacrifice.

679
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,420
He knowingly gives up his spot for her

680
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,340
just as hundreds of others did.

681
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,500
Cameron could have contrived any number of ways

682
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,220
for Jack to give up his chance at life for Rose,

683
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,220
but to get so obsessed with the logistics of the door

684
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,580
and the buoyancy and the square footage,

685
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,620
which is explained in the text.

686
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,260
So to focus on that instead of the simple plot element

687
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,620
of Jack sacrifices his life for Rose

688
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,180
is to completely miss the point.

689
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,980
If you want to contrive some other way

690
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,060
for Cameron to have gotten this across,

691
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,940
leave me a comment, boost my algorithm rating.

692
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,700
I promise I'll read each one.

693
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,940
Thank you for that fine forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.

694
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,740
Titanic is functionally two movies.

695
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,460
In the first half, the Romeo and Juliet love story,

696
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,420
and the second half, the action movie,

697
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,900
which again should not work

698
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,580
and is really difficult to pull off.

699
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,300
But in practice, the first half serves

700
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,380
to make the audience care about the thing,

701
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,500
the ship, the people on it, the love story,

702
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,420
and then the second half takes it all away.

703
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,740
The two halves have completely different tensions.

704
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,060
The first half being the will they won't they get together,

705
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,100
the second half being who will survive and how.

706
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,180
To again quote Cameron,

707
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,500
you have to care about the ship

708
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,060
in order to care about the sinking.

709
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,820
I have built you a good ship, strong and true.

710
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,900
The best case for what works about Titanic

711
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,340
can be made by comparing it

712
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,100
to its most blatant ripoff, Pearl Harbor.

713
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,420
Pearl Harbor is a love story set against the backdrop

714
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,180
of a major historical tragedy,

715
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,700
in this case, a surprise attack

716
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,900
that led to the U.S. entering World War II.

717
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,980
There are more obvious ripoff elements, the score.

718
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:08,300
It has a fun dance scene, both involve ship sinking.

719
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,220
Also, where Titanic has Fabrizio.

720
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:16,220
Goodbye, I will never forget you, I go to America.

721
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,540
I can see the Statue of Liberty already.

722
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:23,060
Pearl Harbor has like seven Fabrizios.

723
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,820
Here's a Fabrizio, there's a Fabrizio,

724
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,300
Fabrizio, black Fabrizio, lady Fabrizio.

725
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,100
But it's not what the movie takes from Titanic

726
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,580
that makes Pearl Harbor such a failure, it's what it lacks.

727
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,500
Pearl Harbor approaches its love story

728
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,420
with the same logic as the clowns

729
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:43,140
from the original animated Dumbo approach, laughing.

730
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,940
Yeah, if they laugh when he jumps 20 feet,

731
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:49,140
they'll laugh twice just hard if he jumps 40 feet.

732
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,700
If you were rooting for these two crazy kids,

733
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,380
how about these three crazy kids?

734
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,020
Yeah, so love triangles are generally

735
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,740
pretty frustrating narrative devices,

736
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,860
especially if the narrative isn't serialized

737
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,820
like in a TV show or a book series.

738
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,300
You've gotta be kidding me.

739
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,020
And when they do work incorporated

740
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,620
in something short like a movie,

741
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,500
it's where the choice is obvious.

742
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,820
I feel this, I feel, I feel the pain.

743
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,740
Yes, you are, and I will.

744
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,660
It's not who will Rose choose,

745
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,460
it's will Rose get away from the bad one?

746
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,980
Again, the choice is simple,

747
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,460
and in this case, simple is not bad.

748
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,540
You jump, I jump, right?

749
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,540
In a movie, you just don't really have enough time

750
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,380
to develop two relationships well enough

751
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,900
to the point where it's like, oh wow,

752
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,500
I wonder who she'll choose, Team Jacob.

753
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,700
But the real difference between the romance in Titanic

754
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,380
and the romance in Pearl Harbor

755
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,260
goes back to the simple screenwriting question

756
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,140
of want versus need,

757
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,540
a motivating want that drives the plot

758
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,860
and a character arc defining need.

759
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,780
Again, for another example of simple is not bad,

760
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:00,140
Michael Jordan wants to be a baseball player,

761
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,660
and this is what serves as his character motivation

762
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,340
in the first act of the film.

763
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,580
But when, because of some space monsters,

764
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,980
the only thing that can save the world

765
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,820
is someone with mad basketball skills,

766
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:16,260
he realizes that he needs to go back to basketball

767
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,740
and that his true place is on the court.

768
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,300
Now leave the baseball player alone, man.

769
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,340
You know he doesn't play basketball anymore.

770
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,140
Michael, did you hear that?

771
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,340
They don't think you can play the game anymore.

772
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,940
There's only one way to find out.

773
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,460
But at the beginning of Pearl Harbor,

774
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,860
none of the main characters want for anything

775
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,980
before they meet and fall in love,

776
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,140
except for Ben Affleck's dyslexia

777
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,700
maybe getting in the way of him becoming a pilot.

778
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,620
I'm never gonna be an English teacher,

779
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,780
but I know why I'm here, to be a pilot.

780
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,340
And you don't dogfight with manuals.

781
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,500
Which is immediately resolved anyway.

782
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,540
In Titanic, Rose is our point of view character

783
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,660
and she's the one who's really missing something

784
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,700
in her life when the narrative begins.

785
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,740
She is repressed, she is lonely,

786
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,220
she is desperate to break free

787
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,260
and feels like there's no way out

788
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,860
until she meets Jack.

789
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,100
And manic pixie dream Jack

790
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,940
helps her complete her character arc.

791
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,740
But in Pearl Harbor, no one really wants for anything,

792
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,180
let alone needs it.

793
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,180
Kate Beckinsale has her girlfriends,

794
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,100
Affleck and Hartnett have each other

795
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,020
and their terrible Southern accents.

796
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,820
I don't wanna teach loops and barrel rows,

797
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,340
I wanna be a combat fighter.

798
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,700
So no one is lonely or unsupported.

799
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,780
No one is missing something critical in their lives

800
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,060
that might be improved by having a soulmate.

801
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,380
They're just attractive people

802
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,180
who are attracted to whoever, I guess.

803
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,780
I suppose the argument could be made

804
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,140
for Beckinsale's character needing something

805
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,940
after she thinks Affleck is dead

806
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:43,260
and she falls head over ass into bed with Josh Hartnett.

807
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,180
But it's like, personally,

808
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,620
if I see someone filling the gap of their dead lover

809
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,140
with his best friend,

810
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,580
I mean, it's not that that can't be compelling content,

811
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,460
it would make for some great Real Housewives drama.

812
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,500
You f***ing whore!

813
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,180
You f***ing whore!

814
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,020
A guy in my f***ing ass!

815
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,180
You f***ing whore!

816
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,060
But I'm not watching this and going,

817
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:07,540
oh man, I hope these crazy kids make it through the war.

818
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,300
Like, as an audience member,

819
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,780
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to feel here.

820
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,300
But I just wanna know why.

821
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,540
So throughout Pearl Harbor,

822
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,780
the love story feels incredibly hollow.

823
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,740
Nothing is at stake if they go back to their old lives.

824
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,780
And for Beckinsale, it basically reads like,

825
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,300
well, at least now I've got a spare

826
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,420
for when one gets killed in action,

827
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,340
which of course, unlike Rose and Jack,

828
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,380
where there is real stakes to their relationship

829
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,380
outside of, you know, young love for both of them,

830
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,580
but particularly for Rose.

831
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,500
Sooner or later, that fire that I love about you, Rose,

832
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,220
that fire is gonna burn out.

833
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,380
But upon rewatch, the most remarkable thing to me

834
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,300
about Pearl Harbor is that it completely drops the ball

835
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,660
at the thing Titanic nails.

836
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,340
We, the audience, don't really care about the ships.

837
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,100
It was a symbolic strike, yes,

838
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,500
but the Japanese at Pearl Harbor

839
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,580
weren't attacking civilians, sailors, or soldiers.

840
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,940
They were attacking the fleet,

841
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,060
which is another thing I hate,

842
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,540
the bombers going after civilians and the hospital.

843
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,340
Okay, okay, we're not gonna go there.

844
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,500
So surely there must have been some way

845
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,460
for the audience to really appreciate

846
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,900
the grandeur of these boats before they get destroyed.

847
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,540
You know, make us care about the fleet before you sink it.

848
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,860
Get out!

849
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,500
Pearl Harbor rips off Titanic

850
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,340
just enough to be frustrating,

851
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:28,620
but it misses what makes those elements in Titanic work,

852
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,500
that it succeeds in making you care about the ship itself,

853
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,380
and it makes you care about the love story,

854
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,740
in no small part because they are intertwined.

855
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,980
When the ship docks, I'm getting off with you.

856
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,660
So in light of the fact that Broadway is shuttered

857
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,580
and will remain so for a long time,

858
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:54,060
I saw Hadestown again recently for my podcast,

859
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,700
and at the time, seeing it yet again,

860
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,420
I felt kind of gratuitous,

861
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,260
like I was being really extravagant,

862
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,060
I don't need to do this,

863
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,380
and I don't think I would have felt that way

864
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:09,300
if I had known that there was about to be no more theater.

865
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,580
But the thing I love the most about Hadestown

866
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,700
is it's a story that, you know,

867
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,100
is brave enough to have a tragic ending,

868
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,220
but also takes the time to really explore

869
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,460
the appeal of stories with tragic endings.

870
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,380
I hear that I've been shown

871
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,300
That's only not so

872
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,300
I'm coming

873
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,100
The musical Hadestown is a retelling

874
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,140
of the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice,

875
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,540
and if you aren't familiar with the myth of Orpheus,

876
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,500
it ends tragically.

877
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,420
But the remarkable thing about this musical

878
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,100
is as you're watching it,

879
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,220
it invests far more in the love story

880
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,860
than the original myth ever could,

881
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,540
and by the end, it makes you believe that,

882
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,660
like Jack and Rose,

883
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,580
those crazy kids might actually make it out this time.

884
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,500
And if you know the myth,

885
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,260
but this is your first time seeing the musical,

886
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,860
it genuinely draws you in and makes you wonder,

887
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,740
are they actually gonna change the ending?

888
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,140
Because that's kind of where it feels like it's going.

889
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,140
They don't.

890
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,420
But there is more to Hadestown than the tragic ending.

891
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,060
It uses that ending to demonstrate

892
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,540
the narrative appeal of tragedy,

893
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,180
and why certain stories get told

894
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,100
and retold over and over again.

895
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,900
A well-told tragedy appeals to the human desire to hope.

896
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,660
And every time you watch Titanic,

897
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,980
or hell, every time I watch one of those

898
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:25,220
Titanic sinks-in-real-time simulations on YouTube,

899
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:28,460
of which I have watched all of them,

900
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,300
there's this part of you

901
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,180
that sees the ship approaching the iceberg and goes like,

902
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:38,020
Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

903
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,500
Like even 23-odd years later,

904
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,020
there's still tension there

905
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,460
because you still kind of hope

906
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,340
that this time they might get out of it.

907
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:56,420
But even upon rewatch, you still feel that story tension.

908
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,860
And you don't leave feeling upset

909
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:01,580
because the tragic ending is a satisfying one.

910
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,580
When Rose either goes to sleep or dies at the end,

911
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:08,100
debate that, not the stupid door.

912
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,660
And she is spiritually reunited

913
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,420
with everyone who died on the ship.

914
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,140
Gets me every time.

915
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:27,060
We chose this topic as we were developing

916
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,580
a different topic that was more topical,

917
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:33,540
but also more heavy and a little too heavy

918
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,340
considering the circumstances.

919
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,180
What?

920
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,900
And when we found ourselves much more drawn

921
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,740
to wallowing in nostalgia

922
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,820
than examining the current state of things,

923
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,180
we thought, hey,

924
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,180
maybe that's what the people need right now instead.

925
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:56,260
The trash pile is where we live, and that's fine.

926
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,100
But even still, this episode was difficult to write

927
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,540
because writing about how a thing is good, actually,

928
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:04,940
especially one that nerds don't universally agree on,

929
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,980
is surprisingly hard to articulate.

930
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,020
And I think because, especially on YouTube,

931
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,220
it puts you in a defensive position,

932
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,820
and that in and of itself is harder to write.

933
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,820
But more importantly,

934
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,540
it's also what YouTube's algorithm recommends

935
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,620
and what people want to watch.

936
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:23,460
Thing bad content tends to get way more views.

937
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,620
But moreover, you're also opening yourself up

938
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,900
to vulnerability and points of attack.

939
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,500
As one example,

940
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,900
and this is not even something I said on YouTube,

941
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,220
I said a nice thing about someone else's book,

942
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:37,860
a very popular and award-winning book at that,

943
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,100
in an interview for Newsweek.

944
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,940
And I saw in a Reddit thread

945
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:45,020
saying that said book that I said the nice thing about

946
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,380
was not good, actually.

947
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,940
And if I say that the thing is good

948
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,980
when in fact the thing is not good,

949
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:56,980
then we can extrapolate that my book is probably also bad.

950
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,100
And some of you will think it is,

951
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:58,940
that's just how it works,

952
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,780
and that's beside the point.

953
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,260
It's amazing how in criticism,

954
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,820
your likes can be a bigger strike against your credibility

955
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,140
than your dislikes,

956
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,380
especially here on YouTube.com,

957
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:11,860
where liking thing is for stupids.

958
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,620
And of course, we do have to write with a mind

959
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,660
towards the algorithm.

960
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,860
Negativity just gets more views.

961
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,580
So for those of you who like to leave

962
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,140
don't you like anything comments,

963
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:23,460
I refer you to Jim Sterling's video on the same topic.

964
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,500
It is surprisingly difficult to create content

965
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,100
that will hit with a wide audience

966
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,340
while not also being thing bad,

967
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,700
which is partially why in my old age,

968
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,740
I'm more and more appreciative of films like Titanic.

969
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,740
Widely popular while also being sincere

970
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,060
and generally hopeful.

971
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,100
Who are you arrogant man

972
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,540
to call yourself the king of the world?

973
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,620
I'm the king of the world.

974
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,180
I'm the king of the world.

975
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,020
Woo!

976
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,500
I think you're not.

977
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:55,260
Man, remember when James Cameron got canceled for that?

978
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,940
Woo!

979
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,340
James Cameron got canceled for quoting his own movie

980
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,460
at the Academy Awards

981
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,380
and Kate Winslet got fat shamed.

982
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,460
Man, fuck the 90s.

983
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,060
So I'm not saying that I'm not doing

984
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,980
thing bad style content anymore

985
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:10,620
because frankly, it is often fun to write.

986
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,620
10 years old.

987
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,020
But it is an interesting challenge

988
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,700
to do more exploratory topics,

989
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:25,100
or in this case, thing good content.

990
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,180
And who better to emulate in that regard

991
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,020
than James Cameron?

992
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:30,860
Woo!

993
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:38,620
In many ways, the work of a critic is easy.

994
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,660
We risk very little,

995
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,940
yet enjoy a position over those

996
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:46,940
who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment.

997
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,580
We thrive on negative criticism,

998
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:52,700
which is fun to write and to read.

999
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,660
In the grand scheme of things,

1000
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:58,860
the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful

1001
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,740
than our criticism designating it so.

1002
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,260
So you remember like six months ago

1003
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,420
when I said this is going to be

1004
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:14,420
the shameless self-promotion section of the channel?

1005
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,220
Well, guess what month it is.

1006
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,140
This was supposed to be a lot more fun.

1007
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,660
This is all your fault.

1008
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,060
That's it.

1009
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:48,900
That's all she wrote.

1010
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,180
I'm the king of the world!

1011
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,020
Julian!

1012
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,420
You shut up!

1013
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,620
Shut up!

1014
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:00,220
Now let's knock this motherfucker out of the park!

1015
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,060
Wear it until you love it!

1016
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,860
Where is my beautiful sister?

1017
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,700
Fuck you!

1018
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,540
Wait, bro!

1019
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,460
Fuck you and all your hateful people!

1020
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,780
God damn it!

1021
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,620
Ah!

1022
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,460
Ah!

1023
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,300
Ah!

1024
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,180
Ah!

1025
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,020
Ah!

1026
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:19,860
Ah!

1027
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,700
Ah!

1028
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,540
Ah!

1029
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,380
Ah!

1030
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,220
Ah!

1031
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,940
Sit in there like a fucking baboon!

1032
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:25,780
No, no, no!

1033
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,580
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do!

1034
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,140
I hate fucking whiskey, son!

1035
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,140
I couldn't stop at fucking three or four!

1036
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:31,980
I hate!

1037
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,980
I defy you stars!
