0	1520	Thank you, Buford.
1520	2400	Well, hello.
2400	5240	It is time for a hot take,
5240	8200	and I think it is simply that
8200	11120	Titanic is good, actually.
11120	14240	James Cameron is a very specific type of genius
14240	17040	that all nerds kind of wish they were,
17040	19080	and I imagine that is why so many people
19080	20680	are so eager to hate this guy,
20680	22620	and not just because of his not-so-secret reputation
22620	24120	of being a tremendous asshole.
26080	28880	And I'm going to demonstrate this particular brand of genius
28920	32040	by drawing a comparison to, of course,
32040	32880	what else?
34360	35240	Phantom of the Opera.
35240	36080	No, no, please don't leave.
36080	37800	I swear this isn't a bait-and-switch about Phantom.
37800	38640	I'll keep it short.
38640	40640	A good production of Phantom of the Opera
40640	43000	will have you responding to the actors,
43000	45400	as is the case with the 25th anniversary cast,
45400	46800	and the chemistry between the actors
46800	48840	nearly sucking their souls out of each other's bodies
48840	50760	from the sheer intensity of it,
50760	52880	more than the flashy set pieces.
52880	54880	This lies in contrast with the most recent
54880	57120	and umpteenth time I saw Phantom on Broadway
57120	58920	earlier this year for my podcast,
58920	62760	where the cast was so lacking in everything
62760	65240	that the biggest reaction slash applause from the audience
65240	67800	were for the set pieces, not for the actors.
67800	69720	The audience applauded for the chandelier,
69720	71520	they applauded for some of the stunts
71520	73600	and the badly-aged pyrotechnics,
73600	74440	but for the actors,
74440	77440	it was more of an applause of obligation, if at all.
77440	80160	In fact, there was hardly even a standing ovation,
80160	82320	and I never see begrudging standing ovations
82320	85040	at Broadway shows anymore, at least in the before time.
85040	86820	And if they enjoyed the spectacle,
86820	89020	that's fine, that's whatever,
89020	91500	but if they didn't connect with the actors,
91500	93540	if they didn't connect with the performers,
93540	96820	then that's not going to make the thing stick with people.
96820	98700	Which brings us to Titanic,
98700	101540	a film so wrapped up in spectacle,
101540	103700	it's kind of hard to imagine that James Cameron
103700	107500	had any room in his brain for anything but spectacle.
107500	108860	But people came for the spectacle,
108860	111100	they did not stay for the spectacle,
111100	115420	they stayed for the story, the characters,
115420	118700	the je ne sais quoi, the iconic love story.
119980	121140	This requires skill.
121140	122580	And it is iconic.
122580	125500	The film still lives strong in our lexicon,
125500	127100	the meme's immortal.
127100	132100	Kate Winslet, DiCaprio, perfectly fine.
132580	134460	We have no choice but to stand.
134460	135860	Compare Titanic to Avatar,
135860	137780	which despite what the Walt Disney Company
137780	138980	would have you believe.
138980	141300	Now everyone, including me,
141300	144500	who has ever dreamed of visiting this extraordinary world,
144500	146780	can explore its astonishing landscape.
146780	149140	Usually, Sudlucid's a lukewarm meh
149140	150940	from people when you bring it up,
150940	152180	except for dads.
153780	156180	Maybe they remember like the special effects
156180	159260	or the 3D or Bill Wellington,
159260	161220	Chris Cumberbatch, you know,
161220	163900	that guy that was in the movies in 2010.
163900	166540	But there's not much memorable about the story itself.
166540	168100	When people think about Avatar,
168100	170740	they think of the technology upon which it was hyped.
170740	173340	And then they probably make a blue Pocahontas joke.
173380	174540	There are those who are kind of
174540	175980	into the world-building elements,
175980	179020	I think, I can't tell how ironic this is,
179020	180100	and I actually know her.
180100	181460	But no one is terribly invested
181460	184100	in the story of Jake, Sully, and Neytiri.
184100	185900	But with Cameron, up until his slip
185900	187940	really started to show with Avatar,
187940	192740	he was very good at balancing spectacle with story,
192740	196740	but up until Titanic, usually giving the edge to spectacle,
196740	199620	because that seemed to be more where his interests lie.
199620	200660	In the case of Titanic,
200660	203700	it was the biggest spectacle in cinematic history.
203700	207060	But at the end of the day, the story is what remains.
207060	209020	It is what sticks with people.
209020	210300	Cameron has done this before
210300	212020	by turning his love of deep-sea diving
212020	214580	into the 1989 film, The Abyss.
214580	217620	A lesser-known Cameron joined about deep-sea aliens,
217620	219700	but that fixation on deep-sea diving leapfrogged
219700	220780	eventually into a fixation
220780	223940	on the newly rediscovered Titanic in the 1990s.
223940	226220	Cameron spent a ton of his own fortune
226220	227700	on diving in Titanic stuff.
227700	230420	And, you know, I've always been interested in the ocean.
230420	232140	So there's a certain transition point
232140	234420	where I realized I was heading toward
234420	236500	making a film on that subject.
236500	239380	And before long, like so many YouTubers after him,
239380	241220	he looked at his greatest interest and thought,
241220	243860	hey, I could monetize this.
243860	246020	Turn down for what?
246020	247700	And so monetize it he did,
247700	249820	with one of the most expensive, remarkable,
249820	253140	and memorable movies of all time, Titanic.
253140	256100	I'm the king of the world!
256580	258540	Whoa!
263540	265100	But the remarkable thing about Titanic
265100	266820	within the Cameron canon,
266820	268140	the first thing that people think about
268140	271380	is not the spectacle, a la the Alien Queen in Aliens
271380	274180	or the T-1000 in Terminator 2,
274180	275540	but for better or worse,
275540	277860	it is the characters, the story.
277860	280900	They think about, draw me like one of your French girls.
280900	283380	They think about, I'm flying.
283580	287260	They think about, I'm the king of the world.
287260	290140	About, it's been 84 years.
290140	291780	They think of putting the diamond in the coat
291780	293260	and putting the coat on her.
293260	297500	The story still trumps the spectacle in the cultural canon,
297500	298780	which is why it's so odd to me
298780	300780	that creeping up on a quarter century later,
300780	302860	there are so many people still insisting
302860	306420	that Titanic is bad, actually.
306420	307780	But I'm not just here to argue
307780	310020	that Titanic is good, actually.
310020	313940	Oh no, I am here to argue that Titanic is actually
313940	316260	one of the greatest cinematic achievements in history,
316260	319140	that it did deserve all of the awards and acclaim.
319140	320820	And no, it did not deserve
320820	323340	that big, dumb, stupid, giant backlash,
323340	326860	one of the biggest ever and one of the most influential.
326860	329340	A backlash so fierce that never again
329340	331700	would the popular thing be allowed
331700	334740	in the same paddock with the high art thing.
334740	337260	No Best Picture nomination for you, Dark Knight.
337260	340380	A segregation of pop art and high art so severe
340380	342580	that the Academy eventually had to expand
342580	346100	the Best Picture category back out to 10 nominations
346100	348020	because could we please get
348020	350700	some popular stuff nominated again?
350700	351540	Please.
351540	355060	So following in the footsteps of those intrepid divers
355060	357700	alongside James Cameron who rediscovered
357700	359140	the wreckage of the great ship,
359140	364060	I am here to dive down and rescue Titanic's reputation
364060	367020	as a cinematic great before it gets eaten
367020	371500	by the iron-eaten bacteria
371500	374820	of this incredibly mixed metaphor.
378380	382180	♪♪
382180	384420	Titanic is one of those movies that,
384420	386500	when I feel like people try to articulate
386500	388180	what they don't like about it,
388180	391260	they tend to be grasping at straws
391260	393500	or declaring certain elements to be subpar
394060	395860	when I'm like, am I missing something?
395860	396900	Did we watch the same movie?
396900	397980	This is fine.
397980	400420	Like Leonardo DiCaprio's acting, for instance.
400420	403140	It's a perfectly fine use of your DiCaprio.
403140	405020	With all due respect, miss,
405020	407100	I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship here.
407100	410140	We know what bad DiCaprio looks like.
410140	412060	And your love has meant nothing to either of us.
412060	413780	No, no!
413780	414620	Watch them!
414620	417500	First of all, my own brother's trying to do this to me!
417500	418900	Surrender now!
418900	419740	No!
420060	421820	Wear it until you love it!
421820	423500	This is not bad DiCaprio.
423500	425260	The basis of most of the criticisms
425260	428740	seems to be based on story is simple
428740	430740	or characters are simple
430740	433020	or wow, such melodrama.
433020	435220	But that said, Titanic is about as complex
435220	437500	as any other mass-appealed blockbuster.
437500	439380	Neither its characters nor its writing
439380	442100	are remarkable in this regard compared to other movies.
442100	443220	Same with the characters.
443220	445900	Are you of the Boston Dawsons?
445900	447940	No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons.
448060	450860	No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.
450860	451700	Oh, yes.
451700	453140	Jack Dawson gets more backstory
453140	455500	than generally agreed upon good characters
455500	458380	like everyone in Jurassic Park.
458380	460580	What's your backstory, Alan Grant?
460580	462940	We're going to find out why you don't like kids?
462940	463780	Oh, wait, who cares?
463780	464620	It doesn't matter.
464620	465540	And then there's the criticism
465540	467020	that the film is melodramatic,
467020	468020	which I also find odd
468020	470100	because the melodrama of the situation
470100	473340	is why we remember the Titanic disaster at all.
473340	475500	It was the largest moving object in the world
475500	477380	built by human hands at the time,
477420	479900	as well as the apex of Edwardian glamour.
479900	483260	It was to be the captain's last voyage before he retired,
483260	486460	and the ship sank on its maiden voyage.
486460	488500	Any publisher would throw that concept out
488500	490700	for being way too over the top
490700	492460	if it had not actually happened.
492460	495660	It is a fundamentally melodramatic historical event,
495660	497860	so there's not really anything tonally off
497860	500940	about having a big emotions romantic epic
500940	502980	on board the ship right before it sinks.
502980	505340	Simplicity, likewise, is a fine line to walk.
505340	507060	A storyline might feel simple
507060	509300	after you've watched a movie 400 times,
509300	510900	but one must also consider
510900	513580	how a story lands to a first-time audience,
513580	515500	as well as repeat viewers.
515500	517860	Not to be that guy, but now that, like...
517860	519420	I'm a writer now.
519420	521020	But after I sold my first book,
521020	523660	available July 21st, pre-order link in the description,
523660	525740	a huge component of the revisions
525740	528700	were simplifying the mysteries what get revealed
528700	531100	and clarifying world-building and plot elements
531100	533620	that I had thought were pretty clear,
533620	536380	but were reading as confusing to first-time readers,
536380	539820	like my editor and my literary agent.
539820	542060	So simplicity and clarity is harder to do
542060	543260	than you might think,
543260	546500	and more complex does not equal more good.
546500	548540	In the case of Titanic, the main love story,
548540	550660	star-crossed lovers of different class who meet,
550660	552420	fall in love, and then one of them dies,
552420	553620	is fairly simple,
553620	556140	in the same way that Romeo and Juliet is fairly simple
556140	558100	if you reduce it to its core components.
558100	561260	I defy you stars!
561260	562540	But it has to balance its bulk
562540	563740	with a bunch of other subplots,
563740	565300	both with tying in the two mains
565300	567340	and with the fate of the ship itself.
567340	569260	So the film needs to walk a fine line.
569260	571300	Spectacle versus emotional core,
571300	573260	melodrama versus absurdity,
573260	574700	sincerity versus irony,
574700	577500	and all the while appeal to as many people as possible.
577500	579260	Cameron himself described his script
579260	581220	as intentionally incorporating universals
581220	582700	of human experience and emotion
582700	584340	that are timeless and familiar
584340	587140	because they reflect our basic emotional fabric.
587140	589500	And all the while I feel I'm
589500	591300	standing in the middle of a crowded room
591300	593060	screaming at the top of my lungs
593060	594700	and no one even looks up.
594700	597260	In response to the accusation that the film is cliche,
597260	598100	Cameron said,
598100	600500	LA Times critic Kenneth Turan mistakes archetypes
600500	601660	for cliche.
601660	603300	I don't share his view that the best scripts
603300	604580	are only the ones that explore
604580	606260	the perimeter of human experience
606260	608660	or flashly pirouette their witty and cynical dialogue
608660	610060	for our admiration.
610060	611780	You dropped this, King.
612820	615100	It's from my masterpiece, Starscream,
615100	616660	it's the only crown I have.
616660	618580	And of course the mere audacity of that attempt
618580	620500	is a strike against the movie's favor.
620500	622580	It's trying to be populist trash.
622580	624620	Which leads us to another common criticism,
624620	626620	that the film is too base.
626620	628700	The swill of the common folk.
628700	631060	Like that is a bug and not a feature.
631060	632340	There is a sort of classism
632340	634300	inherent to criticisms like this.
634300	637220	In effect, it's too many people like this.
637220	639060	Which one sees reflected in the criticism
639060	642260	that Cameron's Titanic valorizes the third class
642260	644700	and demonizes the first class.
644700	646380	My favorite bad Titanic take
646380	649140	comes from historian Richard Davenport Hind,
649140	649980	who wrote,
649980	652740	Cameron's film diabolized rich Americans
652740	654500	and educated English,
654500	657380	anathematizing their emotional restraint,
657380	658620	good tailoring,
658620	660100	punctilious manners,
660100	661700	and grammatical training,
661700	663660	while it made romantic heroes
663660	666500	of the poor Irish and the unlettered.
668940	669980	Wow.
669980	672380	But the thing about popular and low art
672380	674060	is that given enough time,
674060	676940	history often reframes it as high art.
676940	678500	Shakespeare, Puccini, Dickens,
678500	679780	even the novel itself,
679780	681460	all started off as popular art
681460	684380	that only got reframed as high art in retrospect.
684380	686980	So popular art that hits with a wide audience,
686980	687820	difficult to do,
687820	690820	but popular art that stands the test of time,
690820	691740	even harder.
691740	693100	There's truth, but no logic.
693100	694380	What's the artist's name?
694380	695820	Something Picasso.
695820	699340	Even Empire Magazine originally gave the film five stars,
699340	702900	then later revised it down to four after the backlash,
702900	706060	and then eventually revised it back up to five
706060	706980	when they realized
706980	708580	that they were basically peer pressured
708580	709940	into giving it a bad review.
709940	712540	So I feel like the eagerness that some film people have
712540	714780	to distance themselves from Titanic
714780	717620	isn't really out of a desire to assess the quality
717620	719140	or impact of the film,
719140	722100	but to tiptoe around the backlash that followed it.
722100	724820	And even if you're too young to remember the backlash,
724820	727820	you can still probably feel it in the atmosphere.
727820	730580	Like saying that one of the most successful movies
730580	732700	in history is good, actually,
732700	734780	is a ding against your credibility.
734780	737380	Are the masses really that stupid
737380	738540	that if they like the thing,
738540	741340	it must be because the thing is bad, actually?
741340	743780	Well, if one must descend into the trash pile
743780	746100	in order to admit that we enjoy the thing,
746100	748740	then this is where we live now.
748740	751300	So we're not going outside anytime soon.
751300	755660	♪♪
755660	757060	Why this shipwreck?
757060	759060	You know, why not the Lusitania?
759060	760500	Why not the Morrow Castle?
760500	762140	Why not the Atlantic?
762140	763860	I mean, you've got, you know, the biggest ship in the world.
763860	765100	It's on its maiden voyage.
765100	767260	You've got the president of the company on board that owns it.
767260	769060	You've got the builder on board.
769060	772260	And it hits an iceberg, and it sinks so slowly
772260	773580	that you've got all these hours
773580	775340	for all this drama to be acted out.
775340	777940	But there's way more to it than the drama of it all.
777940	779460	The time period in which it happened
779460	781620	is also, of course, relevant.
781620	783900	The Edwardian era, and yes, this counts,
783900	787140	was the last before the advent of modern warfare.
787140	788820	With World War I came all of this
788820	790820	senseless death and carnage.
790820	796460	Then World War II, where a solid 3% of all of humanity died.
796460	797860	Then the nuclear age.
797860	799420	And, of course, the sword of Damocles
799420	802180	that hangs over us to this day, climate change.
802180	805660	So it's almost like a simpler world
805660	807260	went down with the boat.
807260	808940	A more civilized world.
808940	811100	A more glamorous world.
811100	814420	It's always oversimplifying to say it was a simpler time
814420	816340	or a more innocent time,
816340	819540	but that is kind of what it felt like.
819580	820740	Similar to Downton Abbey,
820740	823740	which basically captures the last gasps of aristocracy
823740	825500	before World War I in England.
825500	826900	Do we know anyone on board?
826900	829060	Your mother knows the Astors, at least she knows him.
829060	830700	Titanic does the same.
830700	832980	Yes, class stratification and inequality
832980	834660	are still major things today,
834660	836820	but there's no glamour to the social lives
836820	839420	of, like, Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates.
839420	841500	So you're saying you teach them that they have chores?
841500	842340	Yeah. They have chores.
842340	843180	Your kids have chores.
843180	844020	Yeah, they have responsibilities.
844020	845340	They have chores, they have responsibilities.
846340	847660	Now, flaunting your wealth
847660	849380	is what the kids call a bad look.
849380	851860	Cameron was far from being the first or only person
851860	853380	to wring the entertainment potential
853380	854940	out of this tragedy of errors.
854940	856940	In fact, it was only weeks after the ship sank
856940	858300	that studios around the world
858300	860060	began producing dramatized films.
860060	861740	One notable being the silent short
861740	865940	Saved From the Titanic released a cool 29 days
865940	866780	after the shipwreck
866780	870140	and starring a survivor of the disaster, Dorothy Gibson.
870140	872460	But the heyday for the Titanic dramatization
872460	873780	came in the 1950s.
873780	876260	There was a 1953 Barbara Stanwyck film
876260	877460	simply called Titanic,
877460	878820	which is a wildly inaccurate,
878820	880420	fanciful piece of fan fiction.
880420	885420	♪ River, why don't you be ♪
887060	890460	♪ River, why don't you be ♪
890460	893780	♪ River, why don't you be ♪
893780	895060	But hey, you know, it made money
895060	896660	and walked away with the best screenplay Oscar.
896660	898980	And it paved the road for A Night to Remember,
898980	900940	widely considered the more historically accurate
900940	902300	of the bunch and easily the film
902300	904340	with the greatest influence on Cameron's version.
904340	906860	It's kind of like how Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame
906860	910420	is really more of a remake of the 1939 Hunchback of Notre Dame
910420	912300	than an adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel.
912300	914820	Hell, even the Nazis made their own propaganda version
914820	916020	of Titanic.
916020	918900	And this version took the narrative of J. Bruce Ismay,
918900	920740	wealthy coward who survived,
920740	923540	and turned him into an evil, greedy Jew
923540	926020	who was also a coward that survived.
926020	927340	Because of course they did.
927940	930420	And as a side note, perhaps the person done dirtiest
930420	933020	by history and dramatized versions of Titanic
933020	936140	is J. Bruce Ismay, who was the highest ranking official
936140	938580	on board the Titanic who actually survived.
938580	939500	And he's the guy in the movie
939500	941700	he's pushing the captain to make the boat go faster.
941700	943540	The person is the size of Titanic.
943540	946100	Now I want them to marvel at her speed.
946100	949020	In real life, Ismay was not the living embodiment of hubris.
949020	950740	While he did get on the last lifeboat,
950740	952740	he was not the last man on the Titanic.
952740	954580	He was the last man on the Titanic.
955580	957260	While he did get on the last lifeboat,
957260	958620	there is little evidence to support
958620	960940	that he actually ordered the Titanic to go faster.
960940	962620	Most of the people who saw him on the boat
962620	964740	actually testified that he helped save people
964740	965620	and only hopped in the boat
965620	967220	because there were no women and children around
967220	968100	to take the space.
968100	970100	And a lot of the Ismay hearsay was established
970100	973500	by William Randolph Hearst, who hated Ismay.
973500	976460	And Cameron knew this, so why include it?
976460	978540	Well, because according to Cameron,
978540	980060	people expected to see it.
980060	983420	And so he's here in this role
983580	985500	to play to people's expectations,
985500	986900	to give them what they want.
987740	989820	The 90s resurgence of Titanic interest
989820	991500	most likely came about as a result
991500	992820	of the wreckage being discovered.
992820	994820	There was a TV miniseries from 1996
994820	996140	starring Catherine Zeta-Jones
996140	998100	in a role quite similar to Rose.
999140	1001140	Just breathe, darling.
1002780	1005540	Just show them you can breathe, darling.
1005540	1008420	Just breathe, just breathe.
1008420	1011340	There was a musical from 1997 called Titanic,
1011340	1013620	a new musical written by Maury Yeston
1013620	1015340	and Arthur Coppett of nine fame
1015340	1018500	and this proto phantom.
1020660	1023060	And while this musical swept a very low energy
1023060	1025020	Tony Award season, winning five awards,
1025020	1027140	including best musical, it ranks pretty high
1027140	1030140	on my hunch the musical scale of musicals.
1030140	1034140	♪ I've got a hunch this is love ♪
1034980	1036900	♪ Love ♪
1039500	1040980	It wasn't that historical movies
1040980	1044100	were or were not particularly big in the 90s.

1046860	1049540	you had big disappointments like Far and Away
1049540	1050940	and Cutthroat Island.
1050940	1053060	And history is increasingly unkind
1053060	1054620	to the former two examples.
1055180	1058940	♪ I've got a hunch this is love ♪
1058940	1060780	♪ Love ♪

1070140	1072380	But the more relevant context for which the period
1072380	1075900	in which Titanic was made wasn't period pieces,
1075900	1077180	it was.
1077180	1080900	♪ I've got a hunch this is love ♪
1080900	1082580	There are different cycles for nostalgia
1082580	1084940	and so far the ones we've discussed that are relevant
1084940	1087300	to Titanic have been 40-year cycles,
1087300	1090220	with a big resurgence of interest in the 1950s
1090220	1092540	and then again in the 1990s.
1092540	1094940	But arguably the most consistently lucrative
1094940	1097620	nostalgia cycle is the 20-year cycle,
1097620	1100180	because generally it applies to a demographic
1100180	1102780	who are, you know, they're kinda getting settled in life,
1102780	1105220	getting married, having kids, buying houses.
1105220	1107260	That was a thing people our age did in the 90s.
1107260	1109060	And now they're, you know, feeling wistful
1109060	1111140	about their lost youth and they wanna go to the movies.
1111140	1113580	Think of how Grease, a huge hit released in the 70s,
1113580	1115140	was nostalgic for the 50s.
1115140	1117700	You have your Brady Bunch and all sorts of sitcom remakes
1117700	1120540	that were released in the 90s, nostalgic for the 70s.
1120540	1121820	Sure, Jan.
1121820	1124940	But also in the 90s we had the stylistic nostalgia cycle
1124940	1126540	for disaster movies.
1126540	1128180	In the 70s you had big hits like
1128180	1130340	Towering Inferno and Earthquake.
1130340	1132220	But in the 90s we had another resurgence,
1132220	1133820	not only with natural disaster movies
1133820	1137540	like Dante's Peak and Volcano, Deep Impact, Armageddon,
1137540	1138540	God, there were so many,
1138540	1140380	but we also had like alien invasions,
1140380	1142140	we had Independence Day,
1142140	1147140	any manner of way we can almost wipe out human civilization.
1147300	1148940	We were so bored in the 90s.
1148940	1150900	And right now we're on the verge of a 20-year cycle
1150900	1152660	for the 2000s as well,
1152660	1155660	which I intend on capitalizing shamelessly.
1155660	1156860	Link in the description.
1158300	1159140	It's a period piece.
1159140	1161500	Titanic was pitched as Romeo and Juliet,
1161500	1162860	but on the Titanic.
1162860	1164980	But the danger there is then it looks like
1164980	1167100	a movie for women's.
1167100	1168580	Look, is it a boy movie or a girl movie?
1168580	1169420	We have to choose.
1169420	1171300	And I could go into the convoluted nightmare
1171300	1172700	of the production of this movie
1172700	1175180	and how all signs pointed to failure,
1175180	1177380	but really that would deserve its own video.
1177380	1180300	By virtue of the fact that Cameron was a proven hit maker,
1180300	1182980	studios gave him a lot more money and freedom
1182980	1184980	than they would have to other directors,
1184980	1187420	which is partially why Titanic is allowed to
1187420	1190580	so completely inhabit both worlds,
1190580	1192140	both shamelessly romantic
1192140	1194980	and a textbook 90s disaster movie.
1194980	1196940	But because the studio was capping costs,
1196940	1198340	Titanic didn't have anything like
1198340	1200940	the marketing push we see in big movies today.
1200940	1204420	So a lot of its success really did kind of
1204420	1206580	come by word of mouth.
1206580	1207980	And the fact that for the most part,
1207980	1211140	Hollywood failed to repeat the success of Titanic,
1211140	1212260	and we'll get to that,
1212260	1214340	tells me that they never really understood
1214340	1216820	why it was a success in the first place.
1216820	1218700	I mean, attempts were made.
1218700	1220020	And I'll get to that in a minute.
1220020	1222380	But first, I would like to talk about.
1222380	1226540	♪♪
1226540	1227900	A lot of people joked at the time
1227900	1229860	about who would want to see a Titanic movie,
1229860	1232580	because, you know, we all know how it ends, right?
1232580	1233900	So within the text of the film,
1233900	1236820	the audience needs an incentive to engage with the story
1236820	1239140	outside of simply knowing how it ends.
1239140	1241340	See, previous Titanic movies or musicals
1241340	1243460	just told the story as a period piece.
1243460	1245300	But Cameron's film uses the modern day
1245300	1247780	and a self-insert character named Bill Paxton
1247780	1251820	as James Cameron's, if you'll excuse the term, avatar.
1251820	1254140	Meet Bill Paxton, played by Brock Lovett,
1254140	1255500	our James Cameron insert
1255500	1258100	who only cares about the money, not the science.
1258100	1260180	He's in it for the money, not the science.
1260180	1261300	He's in it for the glory,
1261300	1263700	but doesn't really understand the heart of the tragedy.
1263700	1264700	You know, he doesn't get it.
1264700	1266060	And that's where Rose comes in.
1266060	1267260	She's going to tell her story,
1267260	1269580	and then he's going to get it.
1269580	1271660	Part of the reason Titanic was such a hit
1271660	1273940	was because audiences were really starring
1273940	1276860	for deeply sincere emotional content.
1276860	1278020	But if you're going to go that route,
1278020	1280540	you can't just bust in with a high melodrama.
1280540	1281780	Look, it's the 90s, kids.
1281780	1283220	We are all irony poisoned.
1283220	1284740	The president is being impeached over
1285180	1287220	politics are for suckers and nothing matters.
1287220	1288900	But we are all deeply lonely.
1288900	1290860	The success of Titanic kind of reminds me
1290860	1292540	of Star Wars 20 years earlier.
1292540	1295580	The 70s weren't as irony poisoned as the 90s,
1295580	1299340	but the trend definitely rejected old Hollywood simplicity
1299340	1301740	or this epic tone that Star Wars was going for.
1301740	1303460	The assumption was that audiences
1303460	1305060	would be turned off by that approach,
1305060	1307500	when in reality, they were apparently starving for it.
1307500	1309500	A cowboy movie set in space.
1309500	1311020	That's Star Wars.
1311020	1313340	It's old-fashioned, escapist entertainment,
1313340	1316580	pure and simple, with no moral, no message.
1316580	1318940	And it appears this is what just about everybody
1318940	1320580	in the country is in the mood for.
1320580	1322420	So Titanic's framing device is important
1322420	1324860	in the context of a 90s movie in particular,
1324860	1327540	because by allowing for all of this eye rolling
1327540	1330980	and yeah, we know it's schmaltzy, but just roll with it.
1334980	1338260	It's easier for the audience to suspend their disbelief
1338260	1341500	or their irony in the case of the 90s and accept the story.
1341500	1343060	It takes about 25 minutes to get through
1343060	1344660	the framing device at the beginning.
1344660	1346220	And not only does it leave no doubt
1346220	1347580	as to how the story ends,
1347580	1350180	we know the ship sinks before the story proper even starts.
1350180	1352460	It also tells us the science of what is happening.
1352460	1355500	So when the ship does sink some two hours later,
1355500	1357020	you don't have the audience being like,
1357020	1360420	what the hell, when it breaks in half or sinks vertically.
1360420	1364540	The stern rises up, slow at first and faster and faster
1364540	1366340	until finally she's got her whole ass
1366340	1367340	sticking up in the air.
1367340	1369700	But moreover, the thing about a Titanic movie is,
1369700	1372020	I mean, the fact that we know how it ends
1372020	1373740	means you have to have a new main tension
1373740	1375380	rather than will the boat sink or not.
1375380	1377060	Instead of will the ship sink,
1377060	1379020	the narrative hooks are character-based.
1379020	1381100	We know Rose survives, but how?
1381100	1383540	And why has she kept her identity a secret?
1383540	1384740	What happened to Jack?
1384740	1386820	And where is that necklace anyway?
1386820	1388620	In the context of the framing device,
1388620	1391500	the necklace is what we call a MacGuffin.
1391500	1392340	Is it a-
1392340	1393180	Diamond, yes.
1393180	1394980	In simple terms, a MacGuffin is a thing
1394980	1396140	that drives the plot,
1396140	1398660	but it doesn't actually matter to the story.
1398660	1401060	Everybody wants the necklace because of course they do.
1401060	1402420	It's a thing we can fight over.
1402420	1404740	It's the reason Rose and Bill Paxton
1404740	1405980	meet in the first place.
1405980	1407580	But it doesn't actually matter to the story
1407580	1411220	because the story is about Jack and Rose, not the diamond.
1411220	1413420	Hence she throws it into the ocean at the end.
1413420	1416460	But now you know there was a man named Jack Dawson
1417460	1418780	and that he saved me
1419660	1422940	in every way that a person can be saved.
1422940	1424420	And it's stuff like this that leads to
1424420	1426060	a lot of really lame criticism
1426060	1428180	because all we have to do now
1428180	1430980	that it's the end times is logic the thing.
1430980	1432220	Like in the making of this video,
1432220	1433940	every time I tweeted about Titanic,
1433940	1437660	I got like 400 ats about the door or headboard
1437660	1438940	or whatever that thing is.
1438940	1440740	Like, Jack could have fit on there too.
1440740	1442060	They both could have fit on the head.
1442060	1444540	Like, way to miss the point, assholes.
1444540	1446820	Like there's even a really lame deleted scene
1446820	1448420	where they address this.
1448420	1449900	Just enough for this lady.
1449900	1451060	We'll push it under.
1451060	1453940	Let me try at least or I'll die soon.
1453940	1455580	You'll die sooner if you come any closer.
1455580	1456900	You see, we, the audience,
1456900	1459140	need to feel the weight of the loss here.
1459140	1461620	Not just the 1,500 randos that died,
1461620	1463340	but the character that we've come to know
1463340	1464900	and care about for the last three hours.
1464900	1467540	So Jack sacrificing himself is a micro version
1467540	1469660	of what makes the story so remarkable.
1469660	1471500	Any room for a gentleman, gentlemen?
1471500	1473300	I don't need women at this time, sir.
1473300	1474700	Women and children first
1474700	1477340	wasn't an official policy by any stretch.
1477340	1479340	It was not maritime law.
1479340	1481020	It was more like the Pirate's Code
1481020	1483740	and Pirates of the Caribbean, more of a guideline.
1483740	1486220	So while in theory in a disaster situation,
1486220	1490300	the men folk would try to save the women and children first,
1490300	1492060	the reality is that women and children
1492060	1495260	were way less likely to survive shipwrecks.
1495260	1497740	And in practice, it was usually every man for himself.
1497740	1500660	The White Star Line's previous worst maritime disaster,
1500660	1502260	the sinking of the SS Atlantic,
1502260	1504660	lost more than half of its passengers when it sank
1504660	1506500	and every single woman on board
1506500	1508900	and all but one of the children died.
1508900	1511180	So the fact that the majority of Titanic survivors
1511180	1514500	were women and children is actually an extreme outlier.
1514540	1516460	So Jack giving up his spot for Rose
1516460	1519420	serves as synecdoche for the greater sacrifice.
1519420	1521420	He knowingly gives up his spot for her
1521420	1523340	just as hundreds of others did.
1523340	1525500	Cameron could have contrived any number of ways
1525500	1528220	for Jack to give up his chance at life for Rose,
1528220	1531220	but to get so obsessed with the logistics of the door
1531220	1533580	and the buoyancy and the square footage,
1533580	1535620	which is explained in the text.
1540620	1543260	So to focus on that instead of the simple plot element
1543260	1545620	of Jack sacrifices his life for Rose
1545620	1547180	is to completely miss the point.
1547180	1548980	If you want to contrive some other way
1548980	1551060	for Cameron to have gotten this across,
1551060	1554940	leave me a comment, boost my algorithm rating.
1555980	1558700	I promise I'll read each one.
1558700	1562940	Thank you for that fine forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.
1567060	1568740	Titanic is functionally two movies.
1568740	1571460	In the first half, the Romeo and Juliet love story,
1571500	1573420	and the second half, the action movie,
1573420	1574900	which again should not work
1574900	1576580	and is really difficult to pull off.
1576580	1578300	But in practice, the first half serves
1578300	1580380	to make the audience care about the thing,
1580380	1582500	the ship, the people on it, the love story,
1582500	1584420	and then the second half takes it all away.
1584420	1586740	The two halves have completely different tensions.
1586740	1589060	The first half being the will they won't they get together,
1589060	1592100	the second half being who will survive and how.
1592100	1593180	To again quote Cameron,
1593180	1594500	you have to care about the ship
1594500	1596060	in order to care about the sinking.
1596060	1598820	I have built you a good ship, strong and true.
1598820	1600900	The best case for what works about Titanic
1600900	1602340	can be made by comparing it
1602340	1605100	to its most blatant ripoff, Pearl Harbor.
1607980	1610420	Pearl Harbor is a love story set against the backdrop
1610420	1612180	of a major historical tragedy,
1612180	1613700	in this case, a surprise attack
1613700	1615900	that led to the U.S. entering World War II.
1615900	1618980	There are more obvious ripoff elements, the score.
1624100	1628300	It has a fun dance scene, both involve ship sinking.
1628380	1631220	Also, where Titanic has Fabrizio.
1631220	1636220	Goodbye, I will never forget you, I go to America.
1637100	1639540	I can see the Statue of Liberty already.
1639540	1643060	Pearl Harbor has like seven Fabrizios.
1643060	1645820	Here's a Fabrizio, there's a Fabrizio,
1645820	1649300	Fabrizio, black Fabrizio, lady Fabrizio.
1649300	1651100	But it's not what the movie takes from Titanic
1651100	1654580	that makes Pearl Harbor such a failure, it's what it lacks.
1654580	1656500	Pearl Harbor approaches its love story
1656500	1658420	with the same logic as the clowns
1658420	1663140	from the original animated Dumbo approach, laughing.
1663140	1665940	Yeah, if they laugh when he jumps 20 feet,
1665940	1669140	they'll laugh twice just hard if he jumps 40 feet.
1669140	1671700	If you were rooting for these two crazy kids,
1671700	1674380	how about these three crazy kids?
1679460	1681020	Yeah, so love triangles are generally
1681020	1682740	pretty frustrating narrative devices,
1682740	1684860	especially if the narrative isn't serialized
1684860	1686820	like in a TV show or a book series.
1688260	1689300	You've gotta be kidding me.
1689300	1691020	And when they do work incorporated
1691020	1692620	in something short like a movie,
1692620	1694500	it's where the choice is obvious.
1694500	1697820	I feel this, I feel, I feel the pain.
1697820	1699740	Yes, you are, and I will.
1699740	1701660	It's not who will Rose choose,
1701660	1704460	it's will Rose get away from the bad one?
1704460	1705980	Again, the choice is simple,
1705980	1708460	and in this case, simple is not bad.
1708460	1710540	You jump, I jump, right?
1710540	1712540	In a movie, you just don't really have enough time
1712540	1715380	to develop two relationships well enough
1715380	1717900	to the point where it's like, oh wow,
1717900	1720500	I wonder who she'll choose, Team Jacob.
1720500	1722700	But the real difference between the romance in Titanic
1722700	1724380	and the romance in Pearl Harbor
1724380	1727260	goes back to the simple screenwriting question
1727260	1729140	of want versus need,
1729140	1731540	a motivating want that drives the plot
1731540	1733860	and a character arc defining need.
1733860	1736780	Again, for another example of simple is not bad,
1736780	1740140	Michael Jordan wants to be a baseball player,
1740140	1742660	and this is what serves as his character motivation
1742660	1744340	in the first act of the film.
1744340	1746580	But when, because of some space monsters,
1746580	1748980	the only thing that can save the world
1748980	1751820	is someone with mad basketball skills,
1751820	1756260	he realizes that he needs to go back to basketball
1756260	1759740	and that his true place is on the court.
1759740	1761300	Now leave the baseball player alone, man.
1761300	1763340	You know he doesn't play basketball anymore.
1763340	1765140	Michael, did you hear that?
1765140	1767340	They don't think you can play the game anymore.
1770980	1772940	There's only one way to find out.
1772940	1774460	But at the beginning of Pearl Harbor,
1774460	1776860	none of the main characters want for anything
1776860	1778980	before they meet and fall in love,
1778980	1781140	except for Ben Affleck's dyslexia
1781140	1783700	maybe getting in the way of him becoming a pilot.
1783700	1785620	I'm never gonna be an English teacher,
1786620	1789780	but I know why I'm here, to be a pilot.
1789780	1791340	And you don't dogfight with manuals.
1791340	1793500	Which is immediately resolved anyway.
1793500	1795540	In Titanic, Rose is our point of view character
1795540	1797660	and she's the one who's really missing something
1797660	1799700	in her life when the narrative begins.
1799780	1801740	She is repressed, she is lonely,
1801740	1803220	she is desperate to break free
1803220	1805260	and feels like there's no way out
1805260	1806860	until she meets Jack.
1806860	1808100	And manic pixie dream Jack
1808100	1809940	helps her complete her character arc.
1809940	1812740	But in Pearl Harbor, no one really wants for anything,
1812740	1814180	let alone needs it.
1814180	1816180	Kate Beckinsale has her girlfriends,
1816180	1818100	Affleck and Hartnett have each other
1818100	1820020	and their terrible Southern accents.
1820020	1821820	I don't wanna teach loops and barrel rows,
1821820	1823340	I wanna be a combat fighter.
1823340	1825700	So no one is lonely or unsupported.
1825700	1827780	No one is missing something critical in their lives
1827780	1830060	that might be improved by having a soulmate.
1830060	1831380	They're just attractive people
1831380	1834180	who are attracted to whoever, I guess.
1834180	1835780	I suppose the argument could be made
1835780	1838140	for Beckinsale's character needing something
1838140	1839940	after she thinks Affleck is dead
1839940	1843260	and she falls head over ass into bed with Josh Hartnett.
1843260	1845180	But it's like, personally,
1845180	1847620	if I see someone filling the gap of their dead lover
1847620	1849140	with his best friend,
1849140	1851580	I mean, it's not that that can't be compelling content,
1851580	1854460	it would make for some great Real Housewives drama.
1854940	1856500	You f***ing whore!
1856500	1858180	You f***ing whore!
1858180	1861020	A guy in my f***ing ass!
1861020	1862180	You f***ing whore!
1862180	1864060	But I'm not watching this and going,
1864060	1867540	oh man, I hope these crazy kids make it through the war.
1867540	1869300	Like, as an audience member,
1869300	1871780	I'm not sure what I'm supposed to feel here.
1871780	1873300	But I just wanna know why.
1873300	1874540	So throughout Pearl Harbor,
1874540	1876780	the love story feels incredibly hollow.
1876780	1879740	Nothing is at stake if they go back to their old lives.
1879740	1881780	And for Beckinsale, it basically reads like,
1881780	1884300	well, at least now I've got a spare
1884300	1886420	for when one gets killed in action,
1886420	1889340	which of course, unlike Rose and Jack,
1889340	1891380	where there is real stakes to their relationship
1891380	1894380	outside of, you know, young love for both of them,
1894380	1896580	but particularly for Rose.
1896580	1900500	Sooner or later, that fire that I love about you, Rose,
1900500	1902220	that fire is gonna burn out.
1902220	1904380	But upon rewatch, the most remarkable thing to me
1904380	1907300	about Pearl Harbor is that it completely drops the ball
1907300	1909660	at the thing Titanic nails.
1909700	1913340	We, the audience, don't really care about the ships.
1913340	1915100	It was a symbolic strike, yes,
1915100	1916500	but the Japanese at Pearl Harbor
1916500	1919580	weren't attacking civilians, sailors, or soldiers.
1919580	1921940	They were attacking the fleet,
1921940	1923060	which is another thing I hate,
1923060	1926540	the bombers going after civilians and the hospital.
1926540	1928340	Okay, okay, we're not gonna go there.
1928340	1930500	So surely there must have been some way
1930500	1932460	for the audience to really appreciate
1932460	1935900	the grandeur of these boats before they get destroyed.
1935900	1939540	You know, make us care about the fleet before you sink it.
1940420	1941860	Get out!
1941860	1943500	Pearl Harbor rips off Titanic
1943500	1945340	just enough to be frustrating,
1945340	1948620	but it misses what makes those elements in Titanic work,
1948620	1951500	that it succeeds in making you care about the ship itself,
1951500	1953380	and it makes you care about the love story,
1953380	1955740	in no small part because they are intertwined.
1955740	1959980	When the ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
1965180	1967660	So in light of the fact that Broadway is shuttered
1967660	1970580	and will remain so for a long time,
1970580	1974060	I saw Hadestown again recently for my podcast,
1974060	1975700	and at the time, seeing it yet again,
1975700	1977420	I felt kind of gratuitous,
1977420	1980260	like I was being really extravagant,
1980260	1982060	I don't need to do this,
1982060	1984380	and I don't think I would have felt that way
1984380	1989300	if I had known that there was about to be no more theater.
1989300	1991580	But the thing I love the most about Hadestown
1991580	1993700	is it's a story that, you know,
1993700	1996100	is brave enough to have a tragic ending,
1996140	1999220	but also takes the time to really explore
1999220	2002460	the appeal of stories with tragic endings.
2002460	2005380	I hear that I've been shown
2005380	2008300	That's only not so
2008300	2011300	I'm coming
2011300	2013100	The musical Hadestown is a retelling
2013100	2015140	of the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice,
2015140	2018540	and if you aren't familiar with the myth of Orpheus,
2018540	2020500	it ends tragically.
2020500	2022420	But the remarkable thing about this musical
2022420	2024100	is as you're watching it,
2024100	2026220	it invests far more in the love story
2026220	2027860	than the original myth ever could,
2027860	2029540	and by the end, it makes you believe that,
2029540	2030660	like Jack and Rose,
2030660	2033580	those crazy kids might actually make it out this time.
2033580	2034500	And if you know the myth,
2034500	2036260	but this is your first time seeing the musical,
2036260	2038860	it genuinely draws you in and makes you wonder,
2038860	2040740	are they actually gonna change the ending?
2040740	2044140	Because that's kind of where it feels like it's going.
2044140	2045140	They don't.
2045140	2047420	But there is more to Hadestown than the tragic ending.
2047420	2049060	It uses that ending to demonstrate
2049060	2050540	the narrative appeal of tragedy,
2050540	2052180	and why certain stories get told
2052180	2054100	and retold over and over again.
2054100	2057900	A well-told tragedy appeals to the human desire to hope.
2057900	2059660	And every time you watch Titanic,
2059660	2061980	or hell, every time I watch one of those
2061980	2065220	Titanic sinks-in-real-time simulations on YouTube,
2065220	2068460	of which I have watched all of them,
2068460	2069300	there's this part of you
2069300	2072180	that sees the ship approaching the iceberg and goes like,
2073020	2078020	Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
2085660	2087500	Like even 23-odd years later,
2087500	2089020	there's still tension there
2089020	2091460	because you still kind of hope
2091460	2093340	that this time they might get out of it.
2093340	2096420	But even upon rewatch, you still feel that story tension.
2096420	2097860	And you don't leave feeling upset
2097860	2101580	because the tragic ending is a satisfying one.
2101580	2104580	When Rose either goes to sleep or dies at the end,
2104580	2108100	debate that, not the stupid door.
2108100	2109660	And she is spiritually reunited
2109660	2111420	with everyone who died on the ship.
2117780	2119140	Gets me every time.
2124820	2127060	We chose this topic as we were developing
2127060	2129580	a different topic that was more topical,
2129620	2133540	but also more heavy and a little too heavy
2133540	2135340	considering the circumstances.
2135340	2136180	What?
2142620	2144900	And when we found ourselves much more drawn
2144900	2146740	to wallowing in nostalgia
2146740	2148820	than examining the current state of things,
2148820	2150180	we thought, hey,
2150180	2153180	maybe that's what the people need right now instead.
2153180	2156260	The trash pile is where we live, and that's fine.
2156260	2158100	But even still, this episode was difficult to write
2158100	2161540	because writing about how a thing is good, actually,
2161540	2164940	especially one that nerds don't universally agree on,
2164940	2166980	is surprisingly hard to articulate.
2166980	2169020	And I think because, especially on YouTube,
2169020	2171220	it puts you in a defensive position,
2171220	2173820	and that in and of itself is harder to write.
2173820	2174820	But more importantly,
2174820	2177540	it's also what YouTube's algorithm recommends
2177540	2179620	and what people want to watch.
2179620	2183460	Thing bad content tends to get way more views.
2183460	2185620	But moreover, you're also opening yourself up
2185620	2187900	to vulnerability and points of attack.
2188660	2189500	As one example,
2189500	2190900	and this is not even something I said on YouTube,
2190900	2194220	I said a nice thing about someone else's book,
2194220	2197860	a very popular and award-winning book at that,
2197860	2200100	in an interview for Newsweek.
2200100	2201940	And I saw in a Reddit thread
2201940	2205020	saying that said book that I said the nice thing about
2205020	2207380	was not good, actually.
2207380	2209940	And if I say that the thing is good
2209940	2211980	when in fact the thing is not good,
2211980	2216980	then we can extrapolate that my book is probably also bad.
2216980	2218100	And some of you will think it is,
2218100	2218940	that's just how it works,
2218940	2219780	and that's beside the point.
2219780	2221260	It's amazing how in criticism,
2221260	2223820	your likes can be a bigger strike against your credibility
2223820	2225140	than your dislikes,
2225140	2228380	especially here on YouTube.com,
2228380	2231860	where liking thing is for stupids.
2231860	2233620	And of course, we do have to write with a mind
2233620	2234660	towards the algorithm.
2234660	2236860	Negativity just gets more views.
2236860	2238580	So for those of you who like to leave
2238580	2240140	don't you like anything comments,
2240140	2243460	I refer you to Jim Sterling's video on the same topic.
2243460	2245500	It is surprisingly difficult to create content
2245500	2247100	that will hit with a wide audience
2247100	2249340	while not also being thing bad,
2249340	2251700	which is partially why in my old age,
2251700	2254740	I'm more and more appreciative of films like Titanic.
2254740	2257740	Widely popular while also being sincere
2257740	2259060	and generally hopeful.
2259060	2261100	Who are you arrogant man
2261100	2263540	to call yourself the king of the world?
2263540	2264620	I'm the king of the world.
2264620	2266180	I'm the king of the world.
2266180	2267020	Woo!
2268020	2270500	I think you're not.
2270500	2275260	Man, remember when James Cameron got canceled for that?
2275900	2276940	Woo!
2276940	2279340	James Cameron got canceled for quoting his own movie
2279340	2280460	at the Academy Awards
2280460	2282380	and Kate Winslet got fat shamed.
2282380	2283460	Man, fuck the 90s.
2283460	2285060	So I'm not saying that I'm not doing
2285060	2286980	thing bad style content anymore
2286980	2290620	because frankly, it is often fun to write.
2290620	2291620	10 years old.
2298620	2300020	But it is an interesting challenge
2300020	2301700	to do more exploratory topics,
2301700	2305100	or in this case, thing good content.
2305940	2308180	And who better to emulate in that regard
2308180	2310020	than James Cameron?
2310020	2310860	Woo!
2314220	2318620	In many ways, the work of a critic is easy.
2318620	2320660	We risk very little,
2320660	2322940	yet enjoy a position over those
2322940	2326940	who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment.
2326940	2329580	We thrive on negative criticism,
2329580	2332700	which is fun to write and to read.
2332740	2334660	In the grand scheme of things,
2334660	2338860	the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful
2338860	2341740	than our criticism designating it so.
2346940	2348260	So you remember like six months ago
2348260	2349420	when I said this is going to be
2349420	2354420	the shameless self-promotion section of the channel?
2355540	2357220	Well, guess what month it is.
2358180	2360140	This was supposed to be a lot more fun.
2363700	2365660	This is all your fault.
2387220	2388060	That's it.
2388060	2388900	That's all she wrote.
2389020	2391180	I'm the king of the world!
2393180	2394020	Julian!
2394020	2395420	You shut up!
2395420	2396620	Shut up!
2396620	2400220	Now let's knock this motherfucker out of the park!
2401940	2404060	Wear it until you love it!
2404060	2406860	Where is my beautiful sister?
2408860	2409700	Fuck you!
2409700	2410540	Wait, bro!
2410540	2413460	Fuck you and all your hateful people!
2413460	2414780	God damn it!
2414780	2415620	Ah!
2415620	2416460	Ah!
2416460	2417300	Ah!
2417340	2418180	Ah!
2418180	2419020	Ah!
2419020	2419860	Ah!
2419860	2420700	Ah!
2420700	2421540	Ah!
2421540	2422380	Ah!
2422380	2423220	Ah!
2423220	2424940	Sit in there like a fucking baboon!
2424940	2425780	No, no, no!
2425780	2427580	Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do!
2427580	2429140	I hate fucking whiskey, son!
2429140	2431140	I couldn't stop at fucking three or four!
2431140	2431980	I hate!
2433100	2435980	I defy you stars!
