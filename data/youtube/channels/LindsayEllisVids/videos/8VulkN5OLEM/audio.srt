00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Today, I want to talk about, um, Guardians of the Galaxy.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,200
Showtime, a-holes!

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,900
Yeah, I'm kind of surprised too.

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:14,700
Despite the insistence on certain sects of the internets that there is some grand pro-Marvel, anti-DC conspiracy,

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,900
while on the whole I'd say I'm pretty sick of the media being flooded with superhero movies,

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:25,700
I neither have a particular love nor hate for the Marvel Cinematic Universe so much as I'm just exhausted by it.

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:31,000
But as for the quality of the individual films themselves, to me they run the gamut from,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,200
eh, it's fine, to, eh, it's pretty good.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,200
They rarely prompt a re-watch and they even more rarely evoke any kind of real emotional reaction in me.

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,200
So when I saw Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the third time, with Whiskey,

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,200
He may have been your father, boy, but he wasn't your daddy.

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,700
Ah! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

13
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,000
So I guess this one is joining Moana and too many cooks in the,

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
uh-oh, I'm drunk and there's a movie on, how did this happen club?

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,100
And I was not primed to feel, you know, anything about Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,

16
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,900
but in the end I've always kind of had mixed feelings on the whole Guardians franchise.

17
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,400
On the one hand, the first one came out at a time between Man of Steel and Batman v. Superman,

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,100
and even other Marvel movies that came out around that time were trending really grounded and serious.

19
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,800
So Grimdark looked like it might be the trend for all of superhero-dom.

20
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,200
Hell, hell, what's the matter with you?

21
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,400
Then enter Guardians of the Galaxy with its neon color scheme and its late 70s pop jazz soundtrack

22
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,200
to suddenly throw that grimdark trend into stark relief with something, you know, fun.

23
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,700
They got my dick missing!

24
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,900
So while I am glad that Guardians helped right the ship a little bit,

25
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,900
I don't think that the Guardians approach is beyond criticism.

26
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,300
For one thing, the film features more than a few jokey jokes

27
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,200
that featured more than a whiff of the old casual sexism.

28
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,000
Like Drax's little observation here.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And this green whore she took.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,200
Oh, you must stop!

31
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,900
This doesn't even make sense because he'd literally have to think she was a prostitute

32
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,500
before you f***ing pedants tell me that there's a cutscene where someone calls her a whore,

33
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,000
and Drax does literally think she is a literal prostitute

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
because he takes all of the metaphors literally that's not in the final cut,

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,500
so this joke doesn't even make sense!

36
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,900
Oh, you must stop!

37
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,000
Guardians also suffers from possibly the weakest of any of the Marvel villains,

38
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,100
except for arguably the guy from Thor, The Dark World.

39
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,400
I couldn't even remember his name. I had to look it up.

40
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,100
He was a dark elf or something?

41
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,400
And I was like one of the eight people that actually kind of liked Thor, The Dark World.

42
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,900
Anyway, also I love that this character's name is Ronan.

43
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,800
Like if you spent any time in Ireland, I dare you to find a more common mundane name than Ronan.

44
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,900
There are some who call me...

45
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,900
Tim?

46
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,800
Greetings, Tim the Enchanter.

47
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,900
Although Disney flooding the advertising market with Baby Groot in the month before the movie came out

48
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,700
just really grated on me.

49
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,300
Everyone is paying too much for car insurance.

50
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,800
We've got to save them money.

51
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,700
I agree.

52
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,100
Baby Groot looks like a Funko Pop toy that's going to fill a million landfills

53
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,100
and be used as currency in the post-apocalyptic hellscape.

54
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,900
That loaf of bread is gonna cost you five and a half Baby Groot Funko Pops, please.

55
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,600
But I give Guardians a fairly decent pass by being a genuinely strong narrative

56
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
with likable and well-rounded characters.

57
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,900
So again, my hope for the second movie before it came out was that it would be, you know, fine.

58
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,500
Like, you know, Captain America Civil War was, you know, it was fine.

59
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,800
I went into Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 a bit skeptical.

60
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,400
I was not expecting...

61
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,600
I know I have to go.

62
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,200
Ehhhhhhhhh.

63
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,300
Welcome to the Drunk Cry Club, Guardians.

64
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,000
Prepare to be the subject of many embarrassing tweets.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Because I can pull all the personal anecdotes I want,

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,900
but at the end of the day, it really is kind of personal what strikes you and what doesn't.

67
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,600
I also want to address some points, subtext if you will, that I think some out there missed.

68
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,400
And this kind of hot take troubles me because some out there,

69
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,400
and therefore, by extension, our audience,

70
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,700
are perhaps seeing a little too much of themselves in our very, very deeply flawed protagonist.

71
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,400
Such to the point where they don't understand why our very flawed protagonist hasn't really gotten the girl yet.

72
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,300
Like the prize all manboys are promised at the end of every movie.

73
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,900
But don't worry, everyone.

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,100
I am here to explain this movie to you.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,500
You will always be my sister.

76
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,600
Ehhhhhhhhh.

77
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,300
A lot of why I responded more positively to Guardians 2 than to Guardians 1 has to do with taste.

78
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,100
So, bear that in mind while I try to explain my...

79
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,500
details.

80
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:37,700
My favorite stories in films tend to be ones that, after a viewing, or two, or ten, and some whiskey,

81
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,900
you can distill into one very strong theme.

82
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,000
That uses its plot points to branch into several sub-themes that are driven by the plot,

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,200
but most importantly, by the characters.

84
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,200
That, to me, is the best speculative fiction.

85
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,700
Fiction that uses fantastical elements to explore questions about the nature of humanity.

86
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,500
In effect, all of the Guardians of the Galaxy conceit is about terrible people,

87
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,100
made terrible by abuse,

88
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,200
learning to care about society as a whole,

89
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,000
by learning to empathize with each other.

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,500
Finding friends where you, a terrible person, have none.

91
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,000
And how finding friends can make you a better person.

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,600
A Galaxy Guardian, even.

93
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,000
I look around at us.

94
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,300
You know what I see?

95
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,700
Losers.

96
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,400
I mean, like, folks who have lost stuff.

97
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,600
And we have, man. We have. All of us.

98
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
None of these characters were born bad.

99
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,300
They were made by Thanos, by Yondu, by tragedy,

100
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,200
or by dehumanization and disrespect from everyone.

101
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,100
But that these people can change.

102
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,700
As Movies with Mikey pointed out in his episode about Guardians of the Galaxy,

103
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,900
it's no coincidence that half the characters who were bad guys in the first movie

104
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,300
become good guys in the second.

105
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,600
The second movie expands on this theme, but more specifically, is about parenthood.

106
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,800
Hey, it'll be just a couple of days.

107
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,900
We'll be back before Rockets finish fixing the ship.

108
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,100
Let's take a look at that opening dance montage.

109
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,800
See, this honestly kind of bugged me the first time I saw it,

110
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,100
because it didn't have anything to do with the plot.

111
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,700
I kind of figured that maybe this would end up with Groot actually serving some purpose in this battle.

112
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,700
Like, maybe he might accidentally turn the tide of the battle with his dancing,

113
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,900
or, you know, the dancing might pay off in some way, or something, but it didn't.

114
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,200
No, this credit sequence didn't have anything to do with the plot,

115
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,400
but it had everything to do with the theme.

116
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,200
That is to say, every one of the Guardians gets a parenting moment with baby Groot.

117
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Groot!

118
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Hi!

119
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,600
No, no! Spit it out! Spit it out! Come on!

120
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,900
And that's another thing I really liked about the second movie,

121
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,100
is that a lot of theming was in the subtext.

122
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:49,900
Like, they never sit down and have a conversation about how difficult it is to be four parents to one baby Groot.

123
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:56,700
Like, man, so hard being one quarter co-parent in a galaxy with no socialized childcare.

124
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:02,400
So Guardians 2 is about finding your family, but with regard to parenthood, how your parents affect you.

125
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,500
We'll get to that later.

126
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,500
But what is the greatest challenge to the cohesion of the family?

127
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:12,800
It is not Ronan the Accuser, it is not Thanos, Destroyer of Worlds, it is not any outside force.

128
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,400
The greatest threat to the cohesion of the family is...

129
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,600
Ego.

130
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,100
My name is Ego.

131
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,300
And I do not mean Ego as in the character played by Kurt Russell.

132
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,300
I mean Ego as in the key component of the psychic apparatus defined by Sigmund Freud in 1920.

133
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,200
The villain in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is Ego, with a capital E,

134
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,700
but it is also the egotism of the characters.

135
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,700
To make it through that, you'd have to be the greatest pilot in the universe.

136
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,000
Lucky for us.

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I, uh...

138
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,800
Peter's immaturity and near willingness to throw his friends under the bus at the chance of immortality,

139
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,900
Rocket's inability to admit that he lashes out at his loved ones because he assumes the worst about everyone,

140
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,000
sabotaging everything good in his life,

141
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,800
Yondu's inability to be truthful about his motivations and clinging to prestige until he has lost literally everything,

142
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,400
even Gamora, who as a child was so fixated on her own survival that she didn't see how much her little sister was suffering.

143
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,400
This is why Peter is the nucleus of the story, and to a lesser extent, Rocket.

144
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,600
Peter's ego is his greatest obstacle to becoming a fully realized person.

145
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,500
You're jealous because I'm part God, and you like when I'm the weak one.

146
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,700
You were insufferable to begin with.

147
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:23,500
And part of what makes the portrayal of Peter Quill probably the most confused element of the second film.

148
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,300
I don't consider it as confused in the first because the first film isn't terribly critical of Peter's immaturity

149
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,000
outside of when he's a basic jerk to people.

150
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,200
Indeed, Peter's immaturity saves the day.

151
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,100
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier.

152
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,900
Ooh, child, things will get brighter.

153
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:47,300
But in the second movie, Peter's immaturity is a major character flaw, around which the entire plot revolves.

154
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:53,100
And the film much more clearly equates Peter's love of pop culture with the fact that, well, he needs to grow up.

155
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,100
It's a show that doesn't exist! That's why it would get zero ratings!

156
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,100
I don't know what Cheers is!

157
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,600
Sometimes that works effectively, but then there are these really dramatic moments where it's...

158
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,800
distracting.

159
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,100
Like, really?

160
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,900
Even ego himself seems to conflate compassion and concern for others with immaturity.

161
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,900
You really need to grow up!

162
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,700
Egotism in these films is tied to immaturity, and this is true for all of them.

163
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,800
These characters have come a long way since the beginning of the first movie.

164
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,300
Peter has matured, but clearly has a long way to go.

165
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,300
I thought your thing was a sword!

166
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,000
We've been hired to stop an interdimensional beast from feeding on those batteries, and I'm gonna stop it with a sword?

167
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,200
It's just swords were your thing, and guns were mine.

168
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,100
But I guess we're both doing guns now. I just didn't know that.

169
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,200
And this is how we start our movie. Ego gets in the way over basically nothing.

170
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,500
But hey, this flows right into that big question.

171
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Peter, Gamora, why don't they do the do?

172
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:56,200
I see a lot of confusion over this term.

173
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:03,900
Like, people hear the term toxic masculinity, and they just think it means that being a man is bad.

174
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,100
Which...

175
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,100
...

176
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,000
...

177
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,600
seems like the most common point of contention is not the underlying concept, but the term itself.

178
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,900
I have single-handedly vanquished the beast!

179
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:31,000
So if you don't like the term toxic masculinity, why don't you call it, I don't know, detrimental dick-wagging or patriarchy frown-frowns or machismo no bueno, whatever.

180
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,900
For now, toxic masculinity is the term we have, so that's the one I'm going to use.

181
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:42,900
When we talk about toxic masculinity, the simplest way to describe it is men feeling the need to prove their perceived masculinity through unhealthy means,

182
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,900
harmful to others, but just as often, harmful to themselves.

183
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:55,900
These toxic elements are attached to attributes we as a culture tend to attach to masculinity, including but not limited to anger, being the strongest, pwnage,

184
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,400
Do you bleed?

185
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
eschewing emotional attachment.

186
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Need a hug?

187
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,900
We're not a hugging family.

188
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,900
Damn straight.

189
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,400
Toxic masculinity eschews attributes associated with femininity.

190
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:13,900
Things like emotional vulnerability, crying, giving a shit about other people, and flowers.

191
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,900
I say associated with because obviously everyone has all of these things in them.

192
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,900
Women get angry and men like flowers.

193
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:28,900
So the fact that little boys are taught from a very young age that they're not allowed to cry or that expressing emotion is unmanly,

194
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,900
Is that what you've been filling your head with, boy?

195
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,900
Sentiment!

196
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,900
All of that is a part of toxic masculinity.

197
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:41,900
So with regard to the depiction of masculinity in Guardians, there's a lot you could deconstruct and some of it is a little contradictory.

198
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,900
If I had a blacklight, this would look like a Jackson Pollock painting.

199
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,900
But for simplicity's sake, let's look at Drax, Rocket, Yondu, and Peter.

200
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,900
Drax serves as an interesting deconstruction of the concept.

201
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,900
On the surface, he reads almost like a parody of the mid-90s comic hyper-masculine ideal.

202
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,900
Angry, revenge-driven, muscle-bound, reckless, and uncaring.

203
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:07,900
And the fact that he is primarily motivated by revenge for his murdered wife and daughter is noteworthy.

204
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,900
And also this.

205
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,900
In this green horror sheet.

206
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,900
Oh, you must stop!

207
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,900
But Drax also serves as an interesting deconstruction of the trope as well.

208
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,900
I'm uncertain about parting ways.

209
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,900
God, you're like an old woman.

210
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,900
Because I'm wise?

211
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,900
Part of taking everything literally means that Drax basically has no shame or insecurities.

212
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,900
He's not afraid of emotions associated with femininity.

213
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,900
He has no shame in talking about his love for his dead wife.

214
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,900
The most melodic song in the world could be playing.

215
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,900
She wouldn't even tap her foot.

216
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,900
Including how that affected him physiologically.

217
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,900
They would make my nether regions engorged.

218
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,900
Oh, I get it, yes.

219
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,900
He has no shame about bodily functions in general.

220
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,900
I have famously huge turds.

221
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,900
In fact, his parents recounting the tale of his conception is a thing of beauty to Drax.

222
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,900
My father would tell the story of impregnating my mother every winter solstice.

223
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,900
That's disgusting.

224
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,900
It was beautiful.

225
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,900
You Earthers have hang-ups.

226
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,900
Drax's position as the Gimli of the group, more of a comic relief character,

227
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,900
We dwarves are natural sprinters!

228
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,900
also makes him a bit of a wild card in terms of the way he relates to the other characters.

229
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,900
He's not above laughing at his friend's misfortune.

230
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,900
But there's this one scene at the end of the first Guardians movie that I think is underappreciated.

231
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,900
Rocket is openly weeping at the death of Groot.

232
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,900
Drax sits next to him and then pets him.

233
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,900
Rocket starts to resist, but then just lets him do it.

234
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,900
And you kind of expect Drax to say something mean and insensitive.

235
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,900
But he doesn't.

236
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,900
Neither of them say anything.

237
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,900
And this quiet moment is almost sort of a repudiation of toxic masculinity.

238
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,900
These two don't self-actualize by being the biggest or the baddest or killing the most,

239
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,900
but by being vulnerable and validating that vulnerability.

240
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,900
But that is not to say that Rocket has grown past his toxic tendencies by the second movie.

241
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,900
Far from it.

242
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,900
They told me you people were conceited douchebags.

243
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,900
But that isn't true at all.

244
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:03,900
As the film starts out with a dick-wagging contest between him and Peter that nearly gets everyone killed.

245
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,900
To make it through that, you'd have to be the greatest pilot in the universe.

246
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,900
You're lucky for us.

247
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,900
I am.

248
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,900
Which Gamora spells out explicitly.

249
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,900
Either one of you could have gotten us through that field

250
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,900
had you flown with what's between your ears instead of what's between your legs.

251
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,900
But Rocket's self-sabotaging tendencies are spelled out most explicitly with his relationship with Yondu,

252
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,900
who is second only to Rocket as to how much he deludes himself,

253
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,900
especially with regard to his relationship with his adoptive son, Peter.

254
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,900
Why didn't you deliver Quill the ego like you promised?

255
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,900
He was skinny.

256
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,900
Could fit into places we couldn't.

257
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,900
Good for thieving.

258
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,900
Whom he threatens to kill multiple times in the first movie,

259
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,900
but also always gives Peter an out to save face with his boys.

260
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,900
So much so that Peter seems aware that that's exactly what Yondu is doing,

261
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,900
which seems reinforced by the fact that this is Yondu's reaction

262
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,900
when he realizes that Peter didn't give him an Infinity Stone.

263
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,900
Yondu has gone to incredibly great lengths to protect Peter,

264
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,900
but he is completely dishonest with himself as to why.

265
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,900
No matter how many times Quill betrays you,

266
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,900
you protect him like none of the rest of us much matter.

267
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,900
Yeah!

268
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,900
It's no coincidence that the guy who takes over after him

269
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,900
is a parody of this hyper-masculine idea named

270
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,900
Taserface!

271
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,900
And Yondu is so attached with this construct he has built for himself

272
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,900
that only after he loses everything, his captainship,

273
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,900
the entirety of his crew who is loyal to him,

274
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,900
is he finally able to be honest with himself about why he is the way he is,

275
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,900
and by extension, why Rocket is the way he is.

276
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,900
I know you play like you're the meanest and the hardest,

277
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,900
but actually you're the most scared of all.

278
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,900
Shut up!

279
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,900
I know you steal batteries you don't need,

280
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,900
and you push away anyone who's willing to put up with you,

281
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,900
because just a little bit of love reminds you how big and empty

282
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,900
that hole inside you actually is.

283
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,900
I said shut up!

284
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,900
And then there is Peter, womanizing, insecure,

285
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,900
overcompensating, narcissistic, and lacking in empathy.

286
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,900
The first movie begins with him kicking small animals around for fun.

287
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,900
By the second movie, he has improved a bit.

288
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,900
At the very least, he's aware that diplomacy is a thing.

289
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,900
Careful what you say around these folks.

290
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,900
They're easily offended.

291
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,900
The cost of transgression is death.

292
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,900
But he is also threatened by Gamora using the same weapon as him,

293
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,900
and also gets into that contest of egos with Rocket that nearly gets them all killed.

294
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,900
If this between my legs had a hand on it,

295
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,900
I guarantee I could have landed this ship with it.

296
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,900
Peter, we almost died because of your arrogance.

297
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,900
Peter, like all of us, is the product of the values that are instilled in him.

298
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,900
He lost his mother when he was 12,

299
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,900
so most of these values he did not get from his mother

300
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,900
or from his biological father, who he does not know.

301
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,900
He got it from Yondu.

302
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,900
Is that what she's been filling your head with, boy?

303
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,900
Sentiment!

304
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,900
And deep down, maybe Yondu's intent was ultimately to protect Peter,

305
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,900
but the effect was, well, abusive.

306
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,900
You said you were gonna eat me!

307
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,900
That was being funny!

308
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,900
Not to me!

309
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,900
Damn, is it time for shit to get real already?

310
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,900
So if a big theme of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is parenthood,

311
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,900
then there is the subcategory abusive parenthood.

312
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,900
I will hunt my father like a dog and I will tear him apart slowly,

313
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,900
piece by piece,

314
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:17,900
until he knows some semblance of the profound and unceasing pain I know every single day.

315
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,900
The only parent figure who escapes unscathed is Peter's mother,

316
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,900
and arguably Drax, who may or may not have been a good parent, we don't know.

317
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,900
Ego was absent and neglectful, and then widespread genocidal.

318
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,900
Rocket's creators were abusive.

319
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,900
Yondu's parents sold him into slavery.

320
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:37,900
Just like my own damn parents who sold me, their own little baby, into slavery!

321
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,900
Yondu abused Peter up until basically the last moments of his life,

322
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,900
and then there's Thanos.

323
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,900
We'll get to you, Thanos.

324
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,900
And here's a sentiment I have seen on the Tumblr fringes regarding Yondu's redemption arc.

325
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,900
Since the movie cops to Yondu being an abusive parent, but absolves him anyway,

326
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,900
basically condoning abuse.

327
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,900
I'm sorry I didn't do none of it right.

328
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,900
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.

329
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,900
But I really don't think that's true or fair, or that any relationship is as simple as that.

330
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,900
Because this ties into another theme regarding family.

331
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:13,900
Choosing when to cut people out of your life, and choosing when to forgive.

332
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,900
It shows that neither of these things are necessarily permanent.

333
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,900
Peter effectively cut Yondu out,

334
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,900
and Nebula and Gamora spend the better part of two movies trying to kill each other.

335
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,900
But there are some relationships, as in the case of Thanos,

336
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,900
that do need to be permanently severed.

337
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,900
And despite the fantastical backdrop of these movies,

338
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,900
that Yondu is a blue alien with a whistle-pathic death arrow,

339
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,900
and sisters Gamora and Nebula are genetically altered cyborg assassins,

340
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,900
the underlying emotions are grounded in real, basic human relationships.

341
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,900
I know you haven't been in a literal fight like this with a family member,

342
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:53,900
but you've probably been in a fight that felt like this with a family member.

343
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,900
Both of these storylines end with the characters having to do some intense self-reflection

344
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,900
to recognize how they hurt the people they loved, and ultimately end in forgiveness.

345
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,900
This doesn't absolve bad things, but it means forgiveness is possible.

346
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,900
And that's why I feel like the Gamora and Nebula subplot is a lot more interesting

347
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
than most people have given it credit for.

348
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,900
Gamora and Nebula are the adopted daughters of Thanos.

349
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:19,900
It is implied that they had other siblings who didn't survive the process of being adopted by Thanos.

350
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,900
Out of all our siblings, I hated you least.

351
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,900
And it is implied that Gamora and Nebula were close,

352
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,900
but were driven apart by their adoptive father, forcing them to compete against each other.

353
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,900
As a child, my father would have Gamora and me battle one another in training.

354
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:41,900
But she won. Again, and again, and again, never once refraining.

355
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:47,900
And Nebula, no matter how much she hates Thanos, also resents the shit out of Gamora for being Thanos' favorite.

356
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,900
You alienated my favorite daughter, Gamora.

357
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,900
It's kind of a petty sibling rivalry thing in the first movie,

358
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,900
but this moment here in the second casts all of that in a different light.

359
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,900
You were the one who wanted to win, and I just wanted a sister!

360
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:08,900
The dynamic between Gamora and Nebula might read as familiar for people who grew up in households with abusive or addicted parents,

361
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,900
and that is the displacement of anger from the abuser, in this case Thanos,

362
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,900
to an older sibling or parent that failed to stop the abuser or the addict.

363
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:21,900
Thanos pulled my eye from my head, and my brain from my skull.

364
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,900
Because of you.

365
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:28,900
Nebula seems to be petty and jealous, but really, Gamora could have just once thrown herself under the bus to protect her little sister,

366
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,900
but she never did.

367
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,900
And no, it's not fair to put that kind of emotional burden on a child.

368
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,900
I was a child like you.

369
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,900
I was concerned with staying alive until the next day, every day.

370
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,900
And I never considered what Thanos was doing to you.

371
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,900
But that's what it's like growing up in abusive households,

372
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,900
and that resentment is real and extremely common.

373
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,900
It can be even harder for people to forgive a sibling or a parent who failed to stop abuse

374
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,900
than it is to forgive the abuser.

375
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,900
And having survived this abuse as well is a big piece of Gamora's puzzle.

376
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,900
Peter is obnoxious and immature, sure,

377
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,900
but Gamora has put up all of the walls just as a matter of survival.

378
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,900
And she's not to a place yet where she's really ready to take them down.

379
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,900
Accepting that she failed her sister over and over for years is a bitter enough pill to swallow.

380
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,900
The abusive parent theme also shows up with Mantis, but here is where it gets shaky.

381
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,900
I've seen some criticism that I won't dismiss,

382
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,900
that it is a shame that Gunn bore down so hard with the submissive Asian woman trope.

383
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,900
That is true, that happened.

384
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,900
But I'm more bothered by how all the other characters treat her

385
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,900
with regard to the surviving abusive parent's theme.

386
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,900
He raised me by hand and kept me as his own.

387
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,900
So you're a pet.

388
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,900
She is raised by ego.

389
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,900
He is effectively the only parent she knows,

390
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,900
but everything from her body language to the way she talks about him

391
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,900
shows that she is afraid of him.

392
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,900
She is just as much a survivor of abuse as the rest of them,

393
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,900
but Mantis' pain is almost exclusively played for jokes.

394
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,900
Which is to say nothing about the way Drax talks to her.

395
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,900
I am hideous?

396
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,900
You are horrifying to look at, yes.

397
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,900
It is played as a joke that he would find her unattractive,

398
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,900
but even if it is a joke that works in character,

399
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,900
it still turns her abuse into a joke.

400
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,900
This gross bug lady is my new friend.

401
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,900
I'm learning many things like I'm a pet and ugly.

402
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,900
So it is kind of disappointing, and it muddies the waters a bit,

403
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,900
that we can acknowledge some characters' abuse is legitimate,

404
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,900
but in others it is played for comedy.

405
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,900
Mantis! Look out!

406
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,900
So now we've come full circle.

407
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,900
Why don't they do it already?

408
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,900
So given that the dissonance we've discussed

409
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,900
between the framing of Peter's immaturity

410
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,900
and the fact that he is not rewarded with a girl at the end of either movie

411
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,900
has proven confusing for some,

412
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,900
because movies are generally not critical of our male lead's immaturity,

413
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,900
and the film does start to go down the road

414
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,900
of critiquing Peter's type of immaturity

415
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,900
that is so often forgiven or ignored in movies,

416
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,900
often movies starring Chris Pratt.

417
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,900
You want to consult here or in my bungalow?

418
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,900
But the film ultimately has trouble to really challenge Peter as a character.

419
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,900
Maybe Gunn is saving that for the third one, I don't know.

420
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,900
So what normally happens in movies like this

421
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,900
is our lovable, immature man-child gets the girl.

422
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,900
This, like the nerd nostalgia thing,

423
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,900
is because our lovable, immature man-child is the audience's surrogate,

424
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,900
and his lovable immaturity isn't really a character flaw

425
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,900
that needs to be overcome,

426
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,900
so much as how the filmmakers think the audience sees itself.

427
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,900
I'm a killer, a stone-cold killer.

428
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,900
And there is definitely some of that at work with Peter's character,

429
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,900
and it also feeds into the dissonance of Peter's portrayal.

430
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,900
His lovable immaturity is both framed as relatable,

431
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,900
but also as a character flaw.

432
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,900
Observe the scene where Peter is ranting about his sense of entitlement

433
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,900
at Gamora because the media he grew up with

434
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,900
told him he is owed a relationship.

435
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,900
You know what? This is not Cheers, after all.

436
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,900
This is whatever the show is where one person

437
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,900
is willing to open themselves up to new possibility,

438
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,900
and the other person is a jerk.

439
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,900
I don't know what Cheers is!

440
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,900
Like, yeah, why wouldn't she find that attractive?

441
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,900
But ignoring some of the framing dissonance

442
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,900
where the movie can't decide if Peter's pop culture

443
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,900
referencing womanizing immaturity is fun and relatable,

444
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,900
or if he needs to grow up.

445
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,900
I'm gonna make some weird shit.

446
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,900
The reason why they aren't together goes deeper

447
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,900
than doofy guy meets eye-rolling over serious,

448
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,900
hyper-competent female colleague.

449
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,900
The reason that Gamora and Peter cannot be together, yet,

450
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,900
is that they are not complete people,

451
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,900
at least not in the way that means they have anything

452
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,900
good and healthy to offer in a relationship.

453
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,900
And at least one of them recognizes this.

454
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,900
Gamora and Peter are both radioactive spike balls

455
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,900
of defense mechanisms.

456
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,900
Even Peter's womanizing, which largely gets played as a joke,

457
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,900
This is, like, from a smoking hot Ray Jack girl.

458
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,900
Stabbed me with a fork.

459
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,900
Didn't like me skipping out on her sunrise.

460
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,900
I got right here a Cree girl.

461
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,900
Tried to rip out my thorax.

462
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,900
She caught me with this skinny little Oscar Mirian

463
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,900
who worked in Nova Records.

464
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,900
I was trying to get information.

465
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,900
is his own defense against letting himself get close to women.

466
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,900
Peter is only just starting to come to terms with his mother's death.

467
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,900
I had to watch her die!

468
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,900
And this ties into a scene that I didn't give that much thought

469
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,900
the first time I saw it.

470
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,900
Peter refuses to open the last gift his mother gave to him.

471
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,900
Because when you lose a parent,

472
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,900
especially when you lose a parent that young,

473
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,900
you seal away what little you have of them

474
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,900
as a way of keeping from having to let go.

475
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,900
This is the last thing he will ever get from his mother.

476
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,900
He has a lot of guilt over how he handled his mother's death.

477
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,900
Take my hand.

478
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,900
Peter.

479
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,900
Even then, as if he refused to take her hand,

480
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,900
she wouldn't die.

481
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,900
So it's significant that Peter put off opening this gift for 20 some odd years.

482
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,900
Once he opens it, that's the last thing he'll ever get from her.

483
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,900
There is a direct line drawn between Gamora and Peter's mother

484
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,900
in the first movie with this.

485
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,900
Take my hand!

486
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,900
Take my hand, Peter.

487
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,900
And in the second movie, through Ego, making that connection.

488
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,900
Like the child I put in your mother.

489
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,900
Or the freedom you brought Gamora.

490
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,900
Brandy, you're a fine girl.

491
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,900
What a good wife you would be.

492
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,900
And it is significant that Ego was so threatened

493
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,900
by his love for another person

494
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,900
that it makes perfect sense to him to kill that other person

495
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,900
so his own sense of narcissism won't be threatened by that.

496
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,900
I returned to Earth to see her three times.

497
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,900
And I knew if I returned a fourth, I'd never leave.

498
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,900
But...

499
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,900
it broke my heart to put that tumor in her head.

500
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,900
Gamora has not yet learned how to let people in,

501
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,900
but Peter is still in the process of coming to terms with his own mother's death

502
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,900
and how that informs the way he relates to people.

503
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,900
And both of them have come a long way, but neither of them are there yet.

504
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,900
That's why the movie ends not in them making out over funeral fireworks

505
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,900
after Gamora admits that, yeah, she might have feelings for him,

506
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,900
but with platonic side hug.

507
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,900
So perhaps there were some that didn't find Guardians Vol. 2 narratively satisfying

508
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,900
because rather than rewarding Chris Pratt's egotism and immaturity

509
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,900
with his hyper-competent female co-star as a reward,

510
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,900
instead the film paints Peter's narcissism, misogyny, and character flaws

511
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,900
as an obstacle to being in a relationship.

512
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,900
Oh, I get it. You're jealous because I'm part God

513
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,900
and you like when I'm the weak one.

514
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,900
Which is not something you see all that often in Hollywood movies,

515
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,900
especially movies starring Chris Pratt.

516
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,900
I know it can be kind of jarring having the male protagonist's lovable misogyny

517
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,900
be anything but 100% vindicated by the end of the film.

518
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,900
But the question of Peter and Gamora, will they, won't they,

519
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,900
is more of an emotional subplot.

520
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,900
It's not the focus of the film, nor is it the film's emotional core.

521
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,900
To the surprise of pretty much everyone,

522
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,900
the emotional core of the movie is Yondu.

523
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,900
I'm very popular!

524
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,900
So I know I originally framed this around my emotional reaction to the film

525
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,900
and then didn't really talk about it. Yet.

526
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,900
I lost my father about a year and a half ago.

527
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,900
Peter lost his adoptive father to the cold and feeling vacuum of space.

528
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,900
I lost mine in a similar manner.

529
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,900
Here on Earth, the term for it is Parkinson's disease.

530
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,900
But it wasn't this scene that got to me.

531
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,900
He may have been your father, boy, but he wasn't your daddy.

532
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,900
It was this one.

533
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,900
I told Gamora how, when I was a kid,

534
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,900
I used to pretend David Hasselhoff was my dad.

535
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,900
Earlier it struck me.

536
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,900
Yondu didn't have a talking car, but he did have a flying arrow.

537
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,900
He didn't have the beautiful voice of an angel,

538
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,900
but he did have the whistle of one.

539
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,900
I had a pretty cool dad.

540
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,900
Because I've been there, I've had to give a eulogy for my father.

541
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,900
And a part of the process of figuring that out

542
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,900
is having to put their life in a context.

543
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,900
And that's always impossibly difficult.

544
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,900
The expectation for the reaction of a child after a parent dies

545
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,900
is more akin to Peter's mother,

546
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,900
unquestioning veneration of the parent.

547
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,900
But you left the most wonderful woman ever

548
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,900
to die alone!

549
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,900
But what do you do, how do you feel,

550
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,900
when your parents were not, shall we say, perfect?

551
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,900
I'm not going to get into the details,

552
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,900
but Parkinson's disease changes one's personality.

553
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,900
It changes their physiology, drastically but slowly,

554
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,900
over a period of many, many years.

555
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,900
And when you lose a parent to a chronic illness like I did,

556
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,900
it's only after they die that you realize

557
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,900
how much of your memory of the illness

558
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,900
dominates your memory of them.

559
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,900
And it's only after they're gone that you realize

560
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,900
that you've forgotten that there was a time before it got bad.

561
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,900
That there was something before all this

562
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,900
that helped form who you are as a person.

563
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,900
No, my dad never put a bounty on me.

564
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,900
I want him! Put a bounty on him!

565
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,900
Nor did he threaten to eat me.

566
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,900
Nor did he beat me up to teach me how to fight.

567
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,900
He kicked the crap out of me so I could learn to fight

568
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,900
and kept me in terror by threatening to eat me.

569
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,900
In fact, he wouldn't even let me take karate classes.

570
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,900
But the last few years of his life

571
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,900
were not him sweetly, quietly going into that good night.

572
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,900
So this moment right here...

573
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,900
I had a pretty cool dad.

574
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,900
...was where the broken, open weeping started.

575
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,900
Coming to terms with the death of a parent,

576
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,900
well, I'll let you know if it's even possible,

577
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,900
if I ever get there.

578
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,900
I've even seen Chris Pratt tweeting about his dad on Father's Day

579
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,900
and made me cry for like an hour.

580
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,900
And there are a lot of movies where parents die,

581
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,900
but this movie is one of the few in the mainstream

582
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,900
that addresses the complex feeling of losing a parent

583
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,900
who you had a complicated relationship with.

584
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,900
The other obvious example being Big Fish.

585
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,900
Yondu let everyone down at one point.

586
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,900
His adoptive son, his adoptive father,

587
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,900
and his kindred spirit.

588
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,900
But Yondu was also all of us.

589
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,900
I know who you are, boy!

590
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,900
Because you're me!

591
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,900
And before we go, I need to talk about Rocket for a second.

592
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,900
Rocket is, and I mean this in its intended sense,

593
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,900
triggered by condescension.

594
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,900
You just wanna laugh at me like everyone else!

595
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,900
Rocket, you're drunk, alright? No one's laughing at you.

596
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,900
He thinks I'm some stupid thing!

597
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,900
He does!

598
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,900
People disrespecting him is a psychological trigger for Rocket.

599
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,900
The plot begins in earnest when Rocket steals some batteries

600
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,900
because he feels condescended to by the Sovereign,

601
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,900
prompting their retaliation

602
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,900
and then everyone being correctly angry at Rocket.

603
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,900
Because he stole Anulac's batteries!

604
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,900
They're called Harbulary batteries.

605
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,900
No they're not!

606
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,900
Does Rocket concede to his mistake?

607
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,900
No, he doubles down.

608
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,900
I did it because I wanted to!

609
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,900
Dick.

610
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,900
Rocket engages in some serious self-sabotage

611
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,900
because deep down, he expects to be abandoned

612
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,900
by the people he loves.

613
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,900
Hope daddy isn't as big of a dick as you, orphan boy.

614
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,900
What is your goal here?

615
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,900
To get everybody to hate you?

616
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,900
Because it's working.

617
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,900
At the end of the film, Rocket has bonded with Yondu,

618
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,900
probably more than he ever did with Peter,

619
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,900
and he gives Yondu one means of escape

620
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,900
and one means of survival.

621
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,900
Yondu can either save himself or Peter, but not both.

622
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,900
And without hesitation, Yondu chooses Peter.

623
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,900
Yondu's sacrifice ultimately leads Rocket to telling the Ravagers what Yondu did.

624
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,900
I sent word that Yondu's old Ravager buddies told them what he did.

625
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,900
And Yondu's old adoptive family forgives Yondu for his big crime,

626
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,900
which was effectively child trafficking,

627
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,900
and then giving him a Ravager funeral.

628
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,900
And see also this moment here where Peter acknowledges

629
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,900
that Rocket kind of just wants to be accepted.

630
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,900
He didn't chase him away.

631
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,900
No.

632
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,900
Even though he yelled at him,

633
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,900
I was always mean.

634
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,900
And he stole batteries he didn't need.

635
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,900
Rocket's damage centers wholly around a fear of condescension and rejection,

636
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,900
a fear so profound that he creates scenarios for his friends to reject him.

637
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,900
But then Rocket sees so much of himself in Yondu,

638
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,900
who himself was rejected by his surrogate father, Stalker.

639
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,900
But especially in how both of them are so threatened

640
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,900
by the idea of accepting love from others,

641
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,900
that is why this last scene of the movie belongs to Rocket.

642
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,900
Rocket's entire worldview is built on the expectation

643
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,900
that the people he loves will abandon him,

644
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,900
and that he is not deserving of being loved.

645
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,900
But the fact that his friends forgive him,

646
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,900
and that the Ravagers forgive Yondu,

647
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,900
completely shatters every foundational belief that Rocket had.

648
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,900
In a way, that can be almost traumatic.

649
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,900
There's this tough thing with applying fantastical space operas

650
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,900
to real-world ethics and relationships.

651
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,900
The decision to forgive abusers, or even abuse beneficiaries,

652
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,900
is a deeply personal thing.

653
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,900
And I like that the movie does draw a line.

654
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,900
Sometimes people are way beyond forgiveness,

655
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,900
but sometimes they're not.

656
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,900
And even if you do decide to forgive,

657
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,900
growing up in that environment still has influence to who you become.

658
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,900
Family relationships are messy,

659
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,900
much harder to put a satisfying little bow on than romantic relationships.

660
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,900
But even then you can still consider someone family

661
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,900
without being ready to give yourself over to a relationship.

662
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,900
And that's the reason this film is more interesting than your typical love story.

663
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,900
The evolution of family dynamics has more longevity in a franchise,

664
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,900
and in itself has proven the key to the MCU's longevity.

665
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,900
If nothing else, it has, at long last,

666
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,900
finally gotten me to feel a feeling.

667
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,900
Thank you for watching!
