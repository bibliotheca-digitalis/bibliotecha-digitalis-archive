WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Today, I want to talk about, um, Guardians of the Galaxy.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.200
Showtime, a-holes!

00:06.200 --> 00:07.900
Yeah, I'm kind of surprised too.

00:07.900 --> 00:14.700
Despite the insistence on certain sects of the internets that there is some grand pro-Marvel, anti-DC conspiracy,

00:14.700 --> 00:18.900
while on the whole I'd say I'm pretty sick of the media being flooded with superhero movies,

00:18.900 --> 00:25.700
I neither have a particular love nor hate for the Marvel Cinematic Universe so much as I'm just exhausted by it.

00:25.700 --> 00:31.000
But as for the quality of the individual films themselves, to me they run the gamut from,

00:31.000 --> 00:34.200
eh, it's fine, to, eh, it's pretty good.

00:34.200 --> 00:40.200
They rarely prompt a re-watch and they even more rarely evoke any kind of real emotional reaction in me.

00:40.200 --> 00:46.200
So when I saw Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the third time, with Whiskey,

00:46.200 --> 00:51.200
He may have been your father, boy, but he wasn't your daddy.

00:51.200 --> 00:54.700
Ah! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

00:54.700 --> 00:58.000
So I guess this one is joining Moana and too many cooks in the,

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
uh-oh, I'm drunk and there's a movie on, how did this happen club?

01:01.000 --> 01:06.100
And I was not primed to feel, you know, anything about Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,

01:06.100 --> 01:09.900
but in the end I've always kind of had mixed feelings on the whole Guardians franchise.

01:09.900 --> 01:14.400
On the one hand, the first one came out at a time between Man of Steel and Batman v. Superman,

01:14.400 --> 01:19.100
and even other Marvel movies that came out around that time were trending really grounded and serious.

01:19.100 --> 01:22.800
So Grimdark looked like it might be the trend for all of superhero-dom.

01:22.800 --> 01:27.200
Hell, hell, what's the matter with you?

01:27.200 --> 01:32.400
Then enter Guardians of the Galaxy with its neon color scheme and its late 70s pop jazz soundtrack

01:32.400 --> 01:38.200
to suddenly throw that grimdark trend into stark relief with something, you know, fun.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.700
They got my dick missing!

01:39.700 --> 01:42.900
So while I am glad that Guardians helped right the ship a little bit,

01:42.900 --> 01:45.900
I don't think that the Guardians approach is beyond criticism.

01:45.900 --> 01:48.300
For one thing, the film features more than a few jokey jokes

01:48.300 --> 01:51.200
that featured more than a whiff of the old casual sexism.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.000
Like Drax's little observation here.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
And this green whore she took.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.200
Oh, you must stop!

01:56.200 --> 01:59.900
This doesn't even make sense because he'd literally have to think she was a prostitute

01:59.900 --> 02:03.500
before you f***ing pedants tell me that there's a cutscene where someone calls her a whore,

02:03.500 --> 02:06.000
and Drax does literally think she is a literal prostitute

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
because he takes all of the metaphors literally that's not in the final cut,

02:09.000 --> 02:10.500
so this joke doesn't even make sense!

02:10.500 --> 02:11.900
Oh, you must stop!

02:11.900 --> 02:16.000
Guardians also suffers from possibly the weakest of any of the Marvel villains,

02:16.100 --> 02:19.100
except for arguably the guy from Thor, The Dark World.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.400
I couldn't even remember his name. I had to look it up.

02:25.400 --> 02:28.100
He was a dark elf or something?

02:28.100 --> 02:31.400
And I was like one of the eight people that actually kind of liked Thor, The Dark World.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.900
Anyway, also I love that this character's name is Ronan.

02:33.900 --> 02:38.800
Like if you spent any time in Ireland, I dare you to find a more common mundane name than Ronan.

02:38.800 --> 02:40.900
There are some who call me...

02:42.900 --> 02:43.900
Tim?

02:43.900 --> 02:45.800
Greetings, Tim the Enchanter.

02:45.800 --> 02:49.900
Although Disney flooding the advertising market with Baby Groot in the month before the movie came out

02:49.900 --> 02:51.700
just really grated on me.

02:51.700 --> 02:54.300
Everyone is paying too much for car insurance.

02:54.300 --> 02:56.800
We've got to save them money.

02:56.800 --> 02:57.700
I agree.

02:57.700 --> 03:01.100
Baby Groot looks like a Funko Pop toy that's going to fill a million landfills

03:01.100 --> 03:04.100
and be used as currency in the post-apocalyptic hellscape.

03:04.100 --> 03:07.900
That loaf of bread is gonna cost you five and a half Baby Groot Funko Pops, please.

03:07.900 --> 03:11.600
But I give Guardians a fairly decent pass by being a genuinely strong narrative

03:11.600 --> 03:13.600
with likable and well-rounded characters.

03:13.600 --> 03:17.900
So again, my hope for the second movie before it came out was that it would be, you know, fine.

03:17.900 --> 03:21.500
Like, you know, Captain America Civil War was, you know, it was fine.

03:21.500 --> 03:24.800
I went into Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 a bit skeptical.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.400
I was not expecting...

03:26.400 --> 03:31.600
I know I have to go.

03:31.600 --> 03:35.200
Ehhhhhhhhh.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.300
Welcome to the Drunk Cry Club, Guardians.

03:37.300 --> 03:40.000
Prepare to be the subject of many embarrassing tweets.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Because I can pull all the personal anecdotes I want,

03:42.000 --> 03:45.900
but at the end of the day, it really is kind of personal what strikes you and what doesn't.

03:45.900 --> 03:50.600
I also want to address some points, subtext if you will, that I think some out there missed.

03:50.600 --> 03:53.400
And this kind of hot take troubles me because some out there,

03:53.400 --> 03:55.400
and therefore, by extension, our audience,

03:55.400 --> 03:59.700
are perhaps seeing a little too much of themselves in our very, very deeply flawed protagonist.

03:59.700 --> 04:04.400
Such to the point where they don't understand why our very flawed protagonist hasn't really gotten the girl yet.

04:04.400 --> 04:07.300
Like the prize all manboys are promised at the end of every movie.

04:07.300 --> 04:08.900
But don't worry, everyone.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.100
I am here to explain this movie to you.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.500
You will always be my sister.

04:14.500 --> 04:18.600
Ehhhhhhhhh.

04:22.800 --> 04:27.300
A lot of why I responded more positively to Guardians 2 than to Guardians 1 has to do with taste.

04:27.300 --> 04:30.100
So, bear that in mind while I try to explain my...

04:30.100 --> 04:31.500
details.

04:31.500 --> 04:37.700
My favorite stories in films tend to be ones that, after a viewing, or two, or ten, and some whiskey,

04:37.700 --> 04:39.900
you can distill into one very strong theme.

04:39.900 --> 04:44.000
That uses its plot points to branch into several sub-themes that are driven by the plot,

04:44.000 --> 04:46.200
but most importantly, by the characters.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.200
That, to me, is the best speculative fiction.

04:48.200 --> 04:52.700
Fiction that uses fantastical elements to explore questions about the nature of humanity.

04:52.700 --> 04:56.500
In effect, all of the Guardians of the Galaxy conceit is about terrible people,

04:56.500 --> 04:58.100
made terrible by abuse,

04:58.100 --> 05:00.200
learning to care about society as a whole,

05:00.200 --> 05:02.000
by learning to empathize with each other.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.500
Finding friends where you, a terrible person, have none.

05:05.500 --> 05:08.000
And how finding friends can make you a better person.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.600
A Galaxy Guardian, even.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.000
I look around at us.

05:12.300 --> 05:13.300
You know what I see?

05:14.800 --> 05:15.700
Losers.

05:15.700 --> 05:19.400
I mean, like, folks who have lost stuff.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.600
And we have, man. We have. All of us.

05:21.600 --> 05:23.600
None of these characters were born bad.

05:23.600 --> 05:27.300
They were made by Thanos, by Yondu, by tragedy,

05:27.300 --> 05:30.200
or by dehumanization and disrespect from everyone.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.100
But that these people can change.

05:32.200 --> 05:35.700
As Movies with Mikey pointed out in his episode about Guardians of the Galaxy,

05:35.700 --> 05:38.900
it's no coincidence that half the characters who were bad guys in the first movie

05:38.900 --> 05:40.300
become good guys in the second.

05:40.300 --> 05:44.600
The second movie expands on this theme, but more specifically, is about parenthood.

05:44.600 --> 05:47.800
Hey, it'll be just a couple of days.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.900
We'll be back before Rockets finish fixing the ship.

05:49.900 --> 05:52.100
Let's take a look at that opening dance montage.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.800
See, this honestly kind of bugged me the first time I saw it,

06:00.800 --> 06:03.100
because it didn't have anything to do with the plot.

06:06.800 --> 06:11.700
I kind of figured that maybe this would end up with Groot actually serving some purpose in this battle.

06:11.700 --> 06:14.700
Like, maybe he might accidentally turn the tide of the battle with his dancing,

06:14.700 --> 06:18.900
or, you know, the dancing might pay off in some way, or something, but it didn't.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.200
No, this credit sequence didn't have anything to do with the plot,

06:21.200 --> 06:23.400
but it had everything to do with the theme.

06:23.400 --> 06:27.200
That is to say, every one of the Guardians gets a parenting moment with baby Groot.

06:27.400 --> 06:28.400
Groot!

06:29.600 --> 06:30.600
Hi!

06:34.600 --> 06:37.600
No, no! Spit it out! Spit it out! Come on!

06:38.800 --> 06:40.900
And that's another thing I really liked about the second movie,

06:40.900 --> 06:43.100
is that a lot of theming was in the subtext.

06:43.100 --> 06:49.900
Like, they never sit down and have a conversation about how difficult it is to be four parents to one baby Groot.

06:49.900 --> 06:56.700
Like, man, so hard being one quarter co-parent in a galaxy with no socialized childcare.

06:56.700 --> 07:02.400
So Guardians 2 is about finding your family, but with regard to parenthood, how your parents affect you.

07:02.400 --> 07:03.500
We'll get to that later.

07:03.500 --> 07:06.500
But what is the greatest challenge to the cohesion of the family?

07:06.500 --> 07:12.800
It is not Ronan the Accuser, it is not Thanos, Destroyer of Worlds, it is not any outside force.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.400
The greatest threat to the cohesion of the family is...

07:16.400 --> 07:17.600
Ego.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.100
My name is Ego.

07:19.100 --> 07:22.300
And I do not mean Ego as in the character played by Kurt Russell.

07:22.400 --> 07:27.300
I mean Ego as in the key component of the psychic apparatus defined by Sigmund Freud in 1920.

07:27.300 --> 07:32.200
The villain in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is Ego, with a capital E,

07:32.200 --> 07:34.700
but it is also the egotism of the characters.

07:34.700 --> 07:37.700
To make it through that, you'd have to be the greatest pilot in the universe.

07:37.700 --> 07:39.000
Lucky for us.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
I, uh...

07:41.200 --> 07:45.800
Peter's immaturity and near willingness to throw his friends under the bus at the chance of immortality,

07:45.800 --> 07:50.900
Rocket's inability to admit that he lashes out at his loved ones because he assumes the worst about everyone,

07:50.900 --> 07:53.000
sabotaging everything good in his life,

07:53.000 --> 07:58.800
Yondu's inability to be truthful about his motivations and clinging to prestige until he has lost literally everything,

07:58.800 --> 08:04.400
even Gamora, who as a child was so fixated on her own survival that she didn't see how much her little sister was suffering.

08:04.400 --> 08:08.400
This is why Peter is the nucleus of the story, and to a lesser extent, Rocket.

08:08.400 --> 08:12.600
Peter's ego is his greatest obstacle to becoming a fully realized person.

08:12.600 --> 08:16.500
You're jealous because I'm part God, and you like when I'm the weak one.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.700
You were insufferable to begin with.

08:18.700 --> 08:23.500
And part of what makes the portrayal of Peter Quill probably the most confused element of the second film.

08:23.500 --> 08:28.300
I don't consider it as confused in the first because the first film isn't terribly critical of Peter's immaturity

08:28.300 --> 08:31.000
outside of when he's a basic jerk to people.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.200
Indeed, Peter's immaturity saves the day.

08:33.200 --> 08:38.100
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier.

08:38.100 --> 08:41.900
Ooh, child, things will get brighter.

08:41.900 --> 08:47.300
But in the second movie, Peter's immaturity is a major character flaw, around which the entire plot revolves.

08:47.300 --> 08:53.100
And the film much more clearly equates Peter's love of pop culture with the fact that, well, he needs to grow up.

08:53.100 --> 08:57.100
It's a show that doesn't exist! That's why it would get zero ratings!

08:57.100 --> 08:59.100
I don't know what Cheers is!

08:59.100 --> 09:03.600
Sometimes that works effectively, but then there are these really dramatic moments where it's...

09:03.600 --> 09:04.800
distracting.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.100
Like, really?

09:08.100 --> 09:12.900
Even ego himself seems to conflate compassion and concern for others with immaturity.

09:12.900 --> 09:15.900
You really need to grow up!

09:15.900 --> 09:19.700
Egotism in these films is tied to immaturity, and this is true for all of them.

09:19.700 --> 09:22.800
These characters have come a long way since the beginning of the first movie.

09:22.800 --> 09:26.300
Peter has matured, but clearly has a long way to go.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.300
I thought your thing was a sword!

09:29.300 --> 09:34.000
We've been hired to stop an interdimensional beast from feeding on those batteries, and I'm gonna stop it with a sword?

09:34.000 --> 09:36.200
It's just swords were your thing, and guns were mine.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.100
But I guess we're both doing guns now. I just didn't know that.

09:39.100 --> 09:43.200
And this is how we start our movie. Ego gets in the way over basically nothing.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.500
But hey, this flows right into that big question.

09:45.500 --> 09:50.500
Peter, Gamora, why don't they do the do?

09:50.500 --> 09:56.200
I see a lot of confusion over this term.

09:56.200 --> 10:03.900
Like, people hear the term toxic masculinity, and they just think it means that being a man is bad.

10:03.900 --> 10:06.100
Which...

10:06.100 --> 10:08.100
...

10:08.100 --> 10:11.000
...

10:11.000 --> 10:15.600
seems like the most common point of contention is not the underlying concept, but the term itself.

10:15.600 --> 10:18.900
I have single-handedly vanquished the beast!

10:18.900 --> 10:31.000
So if you don't like the term toxic masculinity, why don't you call it, I don't know, detrimental dick-wagging or patriarchy frown-frowns or machismo no bueno, whatever.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.900
For now, toxic masculinity is the term we have, so that's the one I'm going to use.

10:34.900 --> 10:42.900
When we talk about toxic masculinity, the simplest way to describe it is men feeling the need to prove their perceived masculinity through unhealthy means,

10:42.900 --> 10:45.900
harmful to others, but just as often, harmful to themselves.

10:45.900 --> 10:55.900
These toxic elements are attached to attributes we as a culture tend to attach to masculinity, including but not limited to anger, being the strongest, pwnage,

10:55.900 --> 10:58.400
Do you bleed?

10:58.400 --> 11:00.400
eschewing emotional attachment.

11:00.400 --> 11:01.400
Need a hug?

11:01.400 --> 11:02.900
We're not a hugging family.

11:02.900 --> 11:03.900
Damn straight.

11:03.900 --> 11:07.400
Toxic masculinity eschews attributes associated with femininity.

11:07.400 --> 11:13.900
Things like emotional vulnerability, crying, giving a shit about other people, and flowers.

11:15.900 --> 11:20.900
I say associated with because obviously everyone has all of these things in them.

11:20.900 --> 11:22.900
Women get angry and men like flowers.

11:22.900 --> 11:28.900
So the fact that little boys are taught from a very young age that they're not allowed to cry or that expressing emotion is unmanly,

11:28.900 --> 11:31.900
Is that what you've been filling your head with, boy?

11:31.900 --> 11:32.900
Sentiment!

11:32.900 --> 11:34.900
All of that is a part of toxic masculinity.

11:34.900 --> 11:41.900
So with regard to the depiction of masculinity in Guardians, there's a lot you could deconstruct and some of it is a little contradictory.

11:41.900 --> 11:45.900
If I had a blacklight, this would look like a Jackson Pollock painting.

11:45.900 --> 11:50.900
But for simplicity's sake, let's look at Drax, Rocket, Yondu, and Peter.

11:50.900 --> 11:53.900
Drax serves as an interesting deconstruction of the concept.

11:53.900 --> 11:57.900
On the surface, he reads almost like a parody of the mid-90s comic hyper-masculine ideal.

11:57.900 --> 12:02.900
Angry, revenge-driven, muscle-bound, reckless, and uncaring.

12:02.900 --> 12:07.900
And the fact that he is primarily motivated by revenge for his murdered wife and daughter is noteworthy.

12:07.900 --> 12:08.900
And also this.

12:08.900 --> 12:09.900
In this green horror sheet.

12:09.900 --> 12:11.900
Oh, you must stop!

12:11.900 --> 12:14.900
But Drax also serves as an interesting deconstruction of the trope as well.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.900
I'm uncertain about parting ways.

12:16.900 --> 12:17.900
God, you're like an old woman.

12:17.900 --> 12:19.900
Because I'm wise?

12:19.900 --> 12:24.900
Part of taking everything literally means that Drax basically has no shame or insecurities.

12:24.900 --> 12:27.900
He's not afraid of emotions associated with femininity.

12:27.900 --> 12:30.900
He has no shame in talking about his love for his dead wife.

12:30.900 --> 12:33.900
The most melodic song in the world could be playing.

12:33.900 --> 12:35.900
She wouldn't even tap her foot.

12:35.900 --> 12:38.900
Including how that affected him physiologically.

12:38.900 --> 12:41.900
They would make my nether regions engorged.

12:41.900 --> 12:42.900
Oh, I get it, yes.

12:42.900 --> 12:45.900
He has no shame about bodily functions in general.

12:45.900 --> 12:47.900
I have famously huge turds.

12:47.900 --> 12:51.900
In fact, his parents recounting the tale of his conception is a thing of beauty to Drax.

12:51.900 --> 12:55.900
My father would tell the story of impregnating my mother every winter solstice.

12:55.900 --> 12:56.900
That's disgusting.

12:56.900 --> 12:58.900
It was beautiful.

12:59.900 --> 13:01.900
You Earthers have hang-ups.

13:01.900 --> 13:05.900
Drax's position as the Gimli of the group, more of a comic relief character,

13:05.900 --> 13:07.900
We dwarves are natural sprinters!

13:07.900 --> 13:12.900
also makes him a bit of a wild card in terms of the way he relates to the other characters.

13:12.900 --> 13:14.900
He's not above laughing at his friend's misfortune.

13:14.900 --> 13:18.900
But there's this one scene at the end of the first Guardians movie that I think is underappreciated.

13:18.900 --> 13:21.900
Rocket is openly weeping at the death of Groot.

13:21.900 --> 13:25.900
Drax sits next to him and then pets him.

13:25.900 --> 13:28.900
Rocket starts to resist, but then just lets him do it.

13:28.900 --> 13:32.900
And you kind of expect Drax to say something mean and insensitive.

13:32.900 --> 13:33.900
But he doesn't.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.900
Neither of them say anything.

13:35.900 --> 13:39.900
And this quiet moment is almost sort of a repudiation of toxic masculinity.

13:40.900 --> 13:44.900
These two don't self-actualize by being the biggest or the baddest or killing the most,

13:44.900 --> 13:48.900
but by being vulnerable and validating that vulnerability.

13:48.900 --> 13:52.900
But that is not to say that Rocket has grown past his toxic tendencies by the second movie.

13:52.900 --> 13:53.900
Far from it.

13:53.900 --> 13:56.900
They told me you people were conceited douchebags.

13:56.900 --> 13:58.900
But that isn't true at all.

13:58.900 --> 14:03.900
As the film starts out with a dick-wagging contest between him and Peter that nearly gets everyone killed.

14:03.900 --> 14:06.900
To make it through that, you'd have to be the greatest pilot in the universe.

14:06.900 --> 14:07.900
You're lucky for us.

14:07.900 --> 14:08.900
I am.

14:09.900 --> 14:11.900
Which Gamora spells out explicitly.

14:11.900 --> 14:14.900
Either one of you could have gotten us through that field

14:14.900 --> 14:17.900
had you flown with what's between your ears instead of what's between your legs.

14:17.900 --> 14:22.900
But Rocket's self-sabotaging tendencies are spelled out most explicitly with his relationship with Yondu,

14:22.900 --> 14:25.900
who is second only to Rocket as to how much he deludes himself,

14:25.900 --> 14:29.900
especially with regard to his relationship with his adoptive son, Peter.

14:29.900 --> 14:32.900
Why didn't you deliver Quill the ego like you promised?

14:32.900 --> 14:34.900
He was skinny.

14:34.900 --> 14:37.900
Could fit into places we couldn't.

14:37.900 --> 14:38.900
Good for thieving.

14:38.900 --> 14:41.900
Whom he threatens to kill multiple times in the first movie,

14:41.900 --> 14:44.900
but also always gives Peter an out to save face with his boys.

14:44.900 --> 14:48.900
So much so that Peter seems aware that that's exactly what Yondu is doing,

14:48.900 --> 14:51.900
which seems reinforced by the fact that this is Yondu's reaction

14:51.900 --> 14:54.900
when he realizes that Peter didn't give him an Infinity Stone.

14:54.900 --> 14:57.900
Yondu has gone to incredibly great lengths to protect Peter,

14:57.900 --> 15:00.900
but he is completely dishonest with himself as to why.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.900
No matter how many times Quill betrays you,

15:03.900 --> 15:06.900
you protect him like none of the rest of us much matter.

15:06.900 --> 15:07.900
Yeah!

15:07.900 --> 15:10.900
It's no coincidence that the guy who takes over after him

15:10.900 --> 15:13.900
is a parody of this hyper-masculine idea named

15:13.900 --> 15:16.900
Taserface!

15:16.900 --> 15:20.900
And Yondu is so attached with this construct he has built for himself

15:20.900 --> 15:23.900
that only after he loses everything, his captainship,

15:23.900 --> 15:26.900
the entirety of his crew who is loyal to him,

15:26.900 --> 15:30.900
is he finally able to be honest with himself about why he is the way he is,

15:30.900 --> 15:33.900
and by extension, why Rocket is the way he is.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.900
I know you play like you're the meanest and the hardest,

15:35.900 --> 15:37.900
but actually you're the most scared of all.

15:37.900 --> 15:38.900
Shut up!

15:38.900 --> 15:40.900
I know you steal batteries you don't need,

15:40.900 --> 15:43.900
and you push away anyone who's willing to put up with you,

15:43.900 --> 15:46.900
because just a little bit of love reminds you how big and empty

15:46.900 --> 15:48.900
that hole inside you actually is.

15:48.900 --> 15:49.900
I said shut up!

15:49.900 --> 15:52.900
And then there is Peter, womanizing, insecure,

15:52.900 --> 15:55.900
overcompensating, narcissistic, and lacking in empathy.

15:55.900 --> 15:58.900
The first movie begins with him kicking small animals around for fun.

15:58.900 --> 16:00.900
By the second movie, he has improved a bit.

16:00.900 --> 16:03.900
At the very least, he's aware that diplomacy is a thing.

16:03.900 --> 16:05.900
Careful what you say around these folks.

16:05.900 --> 16:06.900
They're easily offended.

16:06.900 --> 16:08.900
The cost of transgression is death.

16:08.900 --> 16:11.900
But he is also threatened by Gamora using the same weapon as him,

16:11.900 --> 16:15.900
and also gets into that contest of egos with Rocket that nearly gets them all killed.

16:15.900 --> 16:17.900
If this between my legs had a hand on it,

16:17.900 --> 16:19.900
I guarantee I could have landed this ship with it.

16:19.900 --> 16:22.900
Peter, we almost died because of your arrogance.

16:22.900 --> 16:26.900
Peter, like all of us, is the product of the values that are instilled in him.

16:26.900 --> 16:28.900
He lost his mother when he was 12,

16:28.900 --> 16:30.900
so most of these values he did not get from his mother

16:30.900 --> 16:33.900
or from his biological father, who he does not know.

16:33.900 --> 16:34.900
He got it from Yondu.

16:34.900 --> 16:37.900
Is that what she's been filling your head with, boy?

16:37.900 --> 16:38.900
Sentiment!

16:38.900 --> 16:42.900
And deep down, maybe Yondu's intent was ultimately to protect Peter,

16:42.900 --> 16:45.900
but the effect was, well, abusive.

16:45.900 --> 16:47.900
You said you were gonna eat me!

16:47.900 --> 16:49.900
That was being funny!

16:49.900 --> 16:51.900
Not to me!

16:53.900 --> 16:58.900
Damn, is it time for shit to get real already?

16:58.900 --> 17:02.900
So if a big theme of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is parenthood,

17:02.900 --> 17:05.900
then there is the subcategory abusive parenthood.

17:05.900 --> 17:09.900
I will hunt my father like a dog and I will tear him apart slowly,

17:09.900 --> 17:11.900
piece by piece,

17:11.900 --> 17:17.900
until he knows some semblance of the profound and unceasing pain I know every single day.

17:17.900 --> 17:20.900
The only parent figure who escapes unscathed is Peter's mother,

17:20.900 --> 17:24.900
and arguably Drax, who may or may not have been a good parent, we don't know.

17:24.900 --> 17:28.900
Ego was absent and neglectful, and then widespread genocidal.

17:28.900 --> 17:29.900
Rocket's creators were abusive.

17:29.900 --> 17:31.900
Yondu's parents sold him into slavery.

17:31.900 --> 17:37.900
Just like my own damn parents who sold me, their own little baby, into slavery!

17:37.900 --> 17:41.900
Yondu abused Peter up until basically the last moments of his life,

17:41.900 --> 17:43.900
and then there's Thanos.

17:43.900 --> 17:44.900
We'll get to you, Thanos.

17:44.900 --> 17:49.900
And here's a sentiment I have seen on the Tumblr fringes regarding Yondu's redemption arc.

17:49.900 --> 17:53.900
Since the movie cops to Yondu being an abusive parent, but absolves him anyway,

17:53.900 --> 17:55.900
basically condoning abuse.

17:55.900 --> 17:58.900
I'm sorry I didn't do none of it right.

17:58.900 --> 18:00.900
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.

18:00.900 --> 18:05.900
But I really don't think that's true or fair, or that any relationship is as simple as that.

18:05.900 --> 18:08.900
Because this ties into another theme regarding family.

18:08.900 --> 18:13.900
Choosing when to cut people out of your life, and choosing when to forgive.

18:13.900 --> 18:15.900
It shows that neither of these things are necessarily permanent.

18:16.900 --> 18:18.900
Peter effectively cut Yondu out,

18:18.900 --> 18:21.900
and Nebula and Gamora spend the better part of two movies trying to kill each other.

18:21.900 --> 18:24.900
But there are some relationships, as in the case of Thanos,

18:24.900 --> 18:26.900
that do need to be permanently severed.

18:26.900 --> 18:29.900
And despite the fantastical backdrop of these movies,

18:29.900 --> 18:33.900
that Yondu is a blue alien with a whistle-pathic death arrow,

18:33.900 --> 18:37.900
and sisters Gamora and Nebula are genetically altered cyborg assassins,

18:37.900 --> 18:42.900
the underlying emotions are grounded in real, basic human relationships.

18:42.900 --> 18:45.900
I know you haven't been in a literal fight like this with a family member,

18:48.900 --> 18:53.900
but you've probably been in a fight that felt like this with a family member.

18:53.900 --> 18:57.900
Both of these storylines end with the characters having to do some intense self-reflection

18:57.900 --> 19:01.900
to recognize how they hurt the people they loved, and ultimately end in forgiveness.

19:03.900 --> 19:06.900
This doesn't absolve bad things, but it means forgiveness is possible.

19:06.900 --> 19:09.900
And that's why I feel like the Gamora and Nebula subplot is a lot more interesting

19:09.900 --> 19:11.900
than most people have given it credit for.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.900
Gamora and Nebula are the adopted daughters of Thanos.

19:14.900 --> 19:19.900
It is implied that they had other siblings who didn't survive the process of being adopted by Thanos.

19:20.900 --> 19:24.900
Out of all our siblings, I hated you least.

19:24.900 --> 19:26.900
And it is implied that Gamora and Nebula were close,

19:26.900 --> 19:30.900
but were driven apart by their adoptive father, forcing them to compete against each other.

19:30.900 --> 19:34.900
As a child, my father would have Gamora and me battle one another in training.

19:34.900 --> 19:41.900
But she won. Again, and again, and again, never once refraining.

19:41.900 --> 19:47.900
And Nebula, no matter how much she hates Thanos, also resents the shit out of Gamora for being Thanos' favorite.

19:47.900 --> 19:50.900
You alienated my favorite daughter, Gamora.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.900
It's kind of a petty sibling rivalry thing in the first movie,

19:54.900 --> 19:58.900
but this moment here in the second casts all of that in a different light.

19:58.900 --> 20:01.900
You were the one who wanted to win, and I just wanted a sister!

20:02.900 --> 20:08.900
The dynamic between Gamora and Nebula might read as familiar for people who grew up in households with abusive or addicted parents,

20:08.900 --> 20:12.900
and that is the displacement of anger from the abuser, in this case Thanos,

20:12.900 --> 20:16.900
to an older sibling or parent that failed to stop the abuser or the addict.

20:16.900 --> 20:21.900
Thanos pulled my eye from my head, and my brain from my skull.

20:21.900 --> 20:22.900
Because of you.

20:22.900 --> 20:28.900
Nebula seems to be petty and jealous, but really, Gamora could have just once thrown herself under the bus to protect her little sister,

20:28.900 --> 20:29.900
but she never did.

20:29.900 --> 20:32.900
And no, it's not fair to put that kind of emotional burden on a child.

20:32.900 --> 20:34.900
I was a child like you.

20:35.900 --> 20:39.900
I was concerned with staying alive until the next day, every day.

20:39.900 --> 20:42.900
And I never considered what Thanos was doing to you.

20:42.900 --> 20:44.900
But that's what it's like growing up in abusive households,

20:44.900 --> 20:47.900
and that resentment is real and extremely common.

20:47.900 --> 20:51.900
It can be even harder for people to forgive a sibling or a parent who failed to stop abuse

20:51.900 --> 20:53.900
than it is to forgive the abuser.

20:53.900 --> 20:56.900
And having survived this abuse as well is a big piece of Gamora's puzzle.

20:56.900 --> 20:58.900
Peter is obnoxious and immature, sure,

20:58.900 --> 21:02.900
but Gamora has put up all of the walls just as a matter of survival.

21:02.900 --> 21:06.900
And she's not to a place yet where she's really ready to take them down.

21:06.900 --> 21:10.900
Accepting that she failed her sister over and over for years is a bitter enough pill to swallow.

21:10.900 --> 21:14.900
The abusive parent theme also shows up with Mantis, but here is where it gets shaky.

21:14.900 --> 21:17.900
I've seen some criticism that I won't dismiss,

21:17.900 --> 21:21.900
that it is a shame that Gunn bore down so hard with the submissive Asian woman trope.

21:21.900 --> 21:23.900
That is true, that happened.

21:23.900 --> 21:26.900
But I'm more bothered by how all the other characters treat her

21:26.900 --> 21:28.900
with regard to the surviving abusive parent's theme.

21:28.900 --> 21:32.900
He raised me by hand and kept me as his own.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.900
So you're a pet.

21:34.900 --> 21:36.900
She is raised by ego.

21:36.900 --> 21:38.900
He is effectively the only parent she knows,

21:38.900 --> 21:41.900
but everything from her body language to the way she talks about him

21:41.900 --> 21:43.900
shows that she is afraid of him.

21:43.900 --> 21:46.900
She is just as much a survivor of abuse as the rest of them,

21:46.900 --> 21:49.900
but Mantis' pain is almost exclusively played for jokes.

21:49.900 --> 21:52.900
Which is to say nothing about the way Drax talks to her.

21:52.900 --> 21:54.900
I am hideous?

21:54.900 --> 21:57.900
You are horrifying to look at, yes.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.900
It is played as a joke that he would find her unattractive,

21:59.900 --> 22:02.900
but even if it is a joke that works in character,

22:02.900 --> 22:04.900
it still turns her abuse into a joke.

22:04.900 --> 22:06.900
This gross bug lady is my new friend.

22:06.900 --> 22:09.900
I'm learning many things like I'm a pet and ugly.

22:09.900 --> 22:12.900
So it is kind of disappointing, and it muddies the waters a bit,

22:12.900 --> 22:15.900
that we can acknowledge some characters' abuse is legitimate,

22:15.900 --> 22:17.900
but in others it is played for comedy.

22:19.900 --> 22:21.900
Mantis! Look out!

22:23.900 --> 22:26.900
So now we've come full circle.

22:26.900 --> 22:28.900
Why don't they do it already?

22:28.900 --> 22:30.900
So given that the dissonance we've discussed

22:30.900 --> 22:32.900
between the framing of Peter's immaturity

22:32.900 --> 22:35.900
and the fact that he is not rewarded with a girl at the end of either movie

22:35.900 --> 22:37.900
has proven confusing for some,

22:37.900 --> 22:40.900
because movies are generally not critical of our male lead's immaturity,

22:40.900 --> 22:42.900
and the film does start to go down the road

22:42.900 --> 22:44.900
of critiquing Peter's type of immaturity

22:44.900 --> 22:46.900
that is so often forgiven or ignored in movies,

22:46.900 --> 22:48.900
often movies starring Chris Pratt.

22:48.900 --> 22:52.900
You want to consult here or in my bungalow?

22:52.900 --> 22:56.900
But the film ultimately has trouble to really challenge Peter as a character.

22:56.900 --> 22:59.900
Maybe Gunn is saving that for the third one, I don't know.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.900
So what normally happens in movies like this

23:01.900 --> 23:03.900
is our lovable, immature man-child gets the girl.

23:03.900 --> 23:05.900
This, like the nerd nostalgia thing,

23:05.900 --> 23:08.900
is because our lovable, immature man-child is the audience's surrogate,

23:08.900 --> 23:10.900
and his lovable immaturity isn't really a character flaw

23:10.900 --> 23:12.900
that needs to be overcome,

23:12.900 --> 23:14.900
so much as how the filmmakers think the audience sees itself.

23:14.900 --> 23:16.900
I'm a killer, a stone-cold killer.

23:17.900 --> 23:19.900
And there is definitely some of that at work with Peter's character,

23:19.900 --> 23:22.900
and it also feeds into the dissonance of Peter's portrayal.

23:22.900 --> 23:25.900
His lovable immaturity is both framed as relatable,

23:25.900 --> 23:27.900
but also as a character flaw.

23:27.900 --> 23:30.900
Observe the scene where Peter is ranting about his sense of entitlement

23:30.900 --> 23:32.900
at Gamora because the media he grew up with

23:32.900 --> 23:35.900
told him he is owed a relationship.

23:35.900 --> 23:38.900
You know what? This is not Cheers, after all.

23:38.900 --> 23:40.900
This is whatever the show is where one person

23:40.900 --> 23:43.900
is willing to open themselves up to new possibility,

23:43.900 --> 23:45.900
and the other person is a jerk.

23:46.900 --> 23:48.900
I don't know what Cheers is!

23:48.900 --> 23:51.900
Like, yeah, why wouldn't she find that attractive?

23:51.900 --> 23:53.900
But ignoring some of the framing dissonance

23:53.900 --> 23:55.900
where the movie can't decide if Peter's pop culture

23:55.900 --> 23:58.900
referencing womanizing immaturity is fun and relatable,

23:58.900 --> 23:59.900
or if he needs to grow up.

23:59.900 --> 24:01.900
I'm gonna make some weird shit.

24:01.900 --> 24:03.900
The reason why they aren't together goes deeper

24:03.900 --> 24:05.900
than doofy guy meets eye-rolling over serious,

24:05.900 --> 24:07.900
hyper-competent female colleague.

24:07.900 --> 24:11.900
The reason that Gamora and Peter cannot be together, yet,

24:11.900 --> 24:13.900
is that they are not complete people,

24:13.900 --> 24:15.900
at least not in the way that means they have anything

24:15.900 --> 24:17.900
good and healthy to offer in a relationship.

24:17.900 --> 24:19.900
And at least one of them recognizes this.

24:19.900 --> 24:23.900
Gamora and Peter are both radioactive spike balls

24:23.900 --> 24:24.900
of defense mechanisms.

24:24.900 --> 24:27.900
Even Peter's womanizing, which largely gets played as a joke,

24:27.900 --> 24:30.900
This is, like, from a smoking hot Ray Jack girl.

24:30.900 --> 24:31.900
Stabbed me with a fork.

24:31.900 --> 24:33.900
Didn't like me skipping out on her sunrise.

24:33.900 --> 24:35.900
I got right here a Cree girl.

24:35.900 --> 24:36.900
Tried to rip out my thorax.

24:36.900 --> 24:38.900
She caught me with this skinny little Oscar Mirian

24:38.900 --> 24:39.900
who worked in Nova Records.

24:39.900 --> 24:41.900
I was trying to get information.

24:41.900 --> 24:44.900
is his own defense against letting himself get close to women.

24:44.900 --> 24:47.900
Peter is only just starting to come to terms with his mother's death.

24:47.900 --> 24:49.900
I had to watch her die!

24:49.900 --> 24:51.900
And this ties into a scene that I didn't give that much thought

24:51.900 --> 24:53.900
the first time I saw it.

24:53.900 --> 24:56.900
Peter refuses to open the last gift his mother gave to him.

24:56.900 --> 24:57.900
Because when you lose a parent,

24:57.900 --> 24:59.900
especially when you lose a parent that young,

24:59.900 --> 25:01.900
you seal away what little you have of them

25:01.900 --> 25:04.900
as a way of keeping from having to let go.

25:04.900 --> 25:07.900
This is the last thing he will ever get from his mother.

25:07.900 --> 25:09.900
He has a lot of guilt over how he handled his mother's death.

25:09.900 --> 25:11.900
Take my hand.

25:14.900 --> 25:15.900
Peter.

25:15.900 --> 25:17.900
Even then, as if he refused to take her hand,

25:17.900 --> 25:18.900
she wouldn't die.

25:18.900 --> 25:22.900
So it's significant that Peter put off opening this gift for 20 some odd years.

25:22.900 --> 25:25.900
Once he opens it, that's the last thing he'll ever get from her.

25:25.900 --> 25:28.900
There is a direct line drawn between Gamora and Peter's mother

25:28.900 --> 25:30.900
in the first movie with this.

25:30.900 --> 25:32.900
Take my hand!

25:36.900 --> 25:38.900
Take my hand, Peter.

25:38.900 --> 25:41.900
And in the second movie, through Ego, making that connection.

25:41.900 --> 25:44.900
Like the child I put in your mother.

25:44.900 --> 25:47.900
Or the freedom you brought Gamora.

25:47.900 --> 25:50.900
Brandy, you're a fine girl.

25:50.900 --> 25:52.900
What a good wife you would be.

25:52.900 --> 25:55.900
And it is significant that Ego was so threatened

25:55.900 --> 25:57.900
by his love for another person

25:57.900 --> 26:00.900
that it makes perfect sense to him to kill that other person

26:00.900 --> 26:03.900
so his own sense of narcissism won't be threatened by that.

26:03.900 --> 26:06.900
I returned to Earth to see her three times.

26:06.900 --> 26:10.900
And I knew if I returned a fourth, I'd never leave.

26:10.900 --> 26:12.900
But...

26:12.900 --> 26:16.900
it broke my heart to put that tumor in her head.

26:16.900 --> 26:18.900
Gamora has not yet learned how to let people in,

26:18.900 --> 26:21.900
but Peter is still in the process of coming to terms with his own mother's death

26:21.900 --> 26:23.900
and how that informs the way he relates to people.

26:23.900 --> 26:26.900
And both of them have come a long way, but neither of them are there yet.

26:26.900 --> 26:29.900
That's why the movie ends not in them making out over funeral fireworks

26:29.900 --> 26:32.900
after Gamora admits that, yeah, she might have feelings for him,

26:32.900 --> 26:34.900
but with platonic side hug.

26:34.900 --> 26:38.900
So perhaps there were some that didn't find Guardians Vol. 2 narratively satisfying

26:38.900 --> 26:41.900
because rather than rewarding Chris Pratt's egotism and immaturity

26:41.900 --> 26:44.900
with his hyper-competent female co-star as a reward,

26:44.900 --> 26:47.900
instead the film paints Peter's narcissism, misogyny, and character flaws

26:47.900 --> 26:49.900
as an obstacle to being in a relationship.

26:49.900 --> 26:53.900
Oh, I get it. You're jealous because I'm part God

26:53.900 --> 26:55.900
and you like when I'm the weak one.

26:55.900 --> 26:57.900
Which is not something you see all that often in Hollywood movies,

26:57.900 --> 26:59.900
especially movies starring Chris Pratt.

26:59.900 --> 27:03.900
I know it can be kind of jarring having the male protagonist's lovable misogyny

27:03.900 --> 27:06.900
be anything but 100% vindicated by the end of the film.

27:06.900 --> 27:09.900
But the question of Peter and Gamora, will they, won't they,

27:09.900 --> 27:11.900
is more of an emotional subplot.

27:11.900 --> 27:14.900
It's not the focus of the film, nor is it the film's emotional core.

27:14.900 --> 27:17.900
To the surprise of pretty much everyone,

27:17.900 --> 27:20.900
the emotional core of the movie is Yondu.

27:20.900 --> 27:22.900
I'm very popular!

27:27.900 --> 27:30.900
So I know I originally framed this around my emotional reaction to the film

27:30.900 --> 27:33.900
and then didn't really talk about it. Yet.

27:36.900 --> 27:39.900
I lost my father about a year and a half ago.

27:39.900 --> 27:43.900
Peter lost his adoptive father to the cold and feeling vacuum of space.

27:43.900 --> 27:45.900
I lost mine in a similar manner.

27:45.900 --> 27:48.900
Here on Earth, the term for it is Parkinson's disease.

27:48.900 --> 27:50.900
But it wasn't this scene that got to me.

27:50.900 --> 27:54.900
He may have been your father, boy, but he wasn't your daddy.

27:55.900 --> 27:57.900
It was this one.

27:57.900 --> 28:00.900
I told Gamora how, when I was a kid,

28:00.900 --> 28:03.900
I used to pretend David Hasselhoff was my dad.

28:03.900 --> 28:05.900
Earlier it struck me.

28:06.900 --> 28:10.900
Yondu didn't have a talking car, but he did have a flying arrow.

28:10.900 --> 28:13.900
He didn't have the beautiful voice of an angel,

28:13.900 --> 28:15.900
but he did have the whistle of one.

28:15.900 --> 28:17.900
I had a pretty cool dad.

28:17.900 --> 28:21.900
Because I've been there, I've had to give a eulogy for my father.

28:21.900 --> 28:24.900
And a part of the process of figuring that out

28:24.900 --> 28:26.900
is having to put their life in a context.

28:26.900 --> 28:28.900
And that's always impossibly difficult.

28:28.900 --> 28:32.900
The expectation for the reaction of a child after a parent dies

28:32.900 --> 28:34.900
is more akin to Peter's mother,

28:34.900 --> 28:36.900
unquestioning veneration of the parent.

28:36.900 --> 28:40.900
But you left the most wonderful woman ever

28:40.900 --> 28:42.900
to die alone!

28:42.900 --> 28:44.900
But what do you do, how do you feel,

28:44.900 --> 28:47.900
when your parents were not, shall we say, perfect?

28:47.900 --> 28:49.900
I'm not going to get into the details,

28:49.900 --> 28:52.900
but Parkinson's disease changes one's personality.

28:52.900 --> 28:55.900
It changes their physiology, drastically but slowly,

28:55.900 --> 28:58.900
over a period of many, many years.

28:58.900 --> 29:01.900
And when you lose a parent to a chronic illness like I did,

29:01.900 --> 29:04.900
it's only after they die that you realize

29:04.900 --> 29:06.900
how much of your memory of the illness

29:06.900 --> 29:08.900
dominates your memory of them.

29:08.900 --> 29:10.900
And it's only after they're gone that you realize

29:10.900 --> 29:13.900
that you've forgotten that there was a time before it got bad.

29:13.900 --> 29:15.900
That there was something before all this

29:15.900 --> 29:17.900
that helped form who you are as a person.

29:17.900 --> 29:19.900
No, my dad never put a bounty on me.

29:19.900 --> 29:21.900
I want him! Put a bounty on him!

29:21.900 --> 29:23.900
Nor did he threaten to eat me.

29:23.900 --> 29:25.900
Nor did he beat me up to teach me how to fight.

29:25.900 --> 29:28.900
He kicked the crap out of me so I could learn to fight

29:28.900 --> 29:30.900
and kept me in terror by threatening to eat me.

29:30.900 --> 29:32.900
In fact, he wouldn't even let me take karate classes.

29:32.900 --> 29:34.900
But the last few years of his life

29:34.900 --> 29:37.900
were not him sweetly, quietly going into that good night.

29:37.900 --> 29:40.900
So this moment right here...

29:40.900 --> 29:42.900
I had a pretty cool dad.

29:42.900 --> 29:45.900
...was where the broken, open weeping started.

29:45.900 --> 29:47.900
Coming to terms with the death of a parent,

29:47.900 --> 29:50.900
well, I'll let you know if it's even possible,

29:50.900 --> 29:52.900
if I ever get there.

29:52.900 --> 29:55.900
I've even seen Chris Pratt tweeting about his dad on Father's Day

29:55.900 --> 29:57.900
and made me cry for like an hour.

29:57.900 --> 29:59.900
And there are a lot of movies where parents die,

29:59.900 --> 30:01.900
but this movie is one of the few in the mainstream

30:01.900 --> 30:04.900
that addresses the complex feeling of losing a parent

30:04.900 --> 30:06.900
who you had a complicated relationship with.

30:06.900 --> 30:08.900
The other obvious example being Big Fish.

30:08.900 --> 30:11.900
Yondu let everyone down at one point.

30:11.900 --> 30:14.900
His adoptive son, his adoptive father,

30:14.900 --> 30:16.900
and his kindred spirit.

30:16.900 --> 30:18.900
But Yondu was also all of us.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.900
I know who you are, boy!

30:20.900 --> 30:22.900
Because you're me!

30:22.900 --> 30:25.900
And before we go, I need to talk about Rocket for a second.

30:25.900 --> 30:28.900
Rocket is, and I mean this in its intended sense,

30:28.900 --> 30:30.900
triggered by condescension.

30:30.900 --> 30:32.900
You just wanna laugh at me like everyone else!

30:32.900 --> 30:34.900
Rocket, you're drunk, alright? No one's laughing at you.

30:34.900 --> 30:36.900
He thinks I'm some stupid thing!

30:36.900 --> 30:37.900
He does!

30:37.900 --> 30:40.900
People disrespecting him is a psychological trigger for Rocket.

30:40.900 --> 30:43.900
The plot begins in earnest when Rocket steals some batteries

30:43.900 --> 30:45.900
because he feels condescended to by the Sovereign,

30:45.900 --> 30:47.900
prompting their retaliation

30:47.900 --> 30:50.900
and then everyone being correctly angry at Rocket.

30:50.900 --> 30:53.900
Because he stole Anulac's batteries!

30:53.900 --> 30:55.900
They're called Harbulary batteries.

30:55.900 --> 30:56.900
No they're not!

30:56.900 --> 30:58.900
Does Rocket concede to his mistake?

30:58.900 --> 31:00.900
No, he doubles down.

31:00.900 --> 31:02.900
I did it because I wanted to!

31:02.900 --> 31:03.900
Dick.

31:03.900 --> 31:05.900
Rocket engages in some serious self-sabotage

31:05.900 --> 31:08.900
because deep down, he expects to be abandoned

31:08.900 --> 31:10.900
by the people he loves.

31:10.900 --> 31:13.900
Hope daddy isn't as big of a dick as you, orphan boy.

31:14.900 --> 31:16.900
What is your goal here?

31:17.900 --> 31:19.900
To get everybody to hate you?

31:19.900 --> 31:21.900
Because it's working.

31:23.900 --> 31:26.900
At the end of the film, Rocket has bonded with Yondu,

31:26.900 --> 31:28.900
probably more than he ever did with Peter,

31:28.900 --> 31:30.900
and he gives Yondu one means of escape

31:30.900 --> 31:32.900
and one means of survival.

31:32.900 --> 31:35.900
Yondu can either save himself or Peter, but not both.

31:35.900 --> 31:38.900
And without hesitation, Yondu chooses Peter.

31:38.900 --> 31:42.900
Yondu's sacrifice ultimately leads Rocket to telling the Ravagers what Yondu did.

31:42.900 --> 31:45.900
I sent word that Yondu's old Ravager buddies told them what he did.

31:45.900 --> 31:49.900
And Yondu's old adoptive family forgives Yondu for his big crime,

31:49.900 --> 31:51.900
which was effectively child trafficking,

31:51.900 --> 31:53.900
and then giving him a Ravager funeral.

32:01.900 --> 32:04.900
And see also this moment here where Peter acknowledges

32:04.900 --> 32:07.900
that Rocket kind of just wants to be accepted.

32:07.900 --> 32:09.900
He didn't chase him away.

32:09.900 --> 32:11.900
No.

32:11.900 --> 32:13.900
Even though he yelled at him,

32:13.900 --> 32:16.900
I was always mean.

32:17.900 --> 32:20.900
And he stole batteries he didn't need.

32:21.900 --> 32:25.900
Rocket's damage centers wholly around a fear of condescension and rejection,

32:25.900 --> 32:29.900
a fear so profound that he creates scenarios for his friends to reject him.

32:29.900 --> 32:32.900
But then Rocket sees so much of himself in Yondu,

32:32.900 --> 32:35.900
who himself was rejected by his surrogate father, Stalker.

32:35.900 --> 32:37.900
But especially in how both of them are so threatened

32:37.900 --> 32:39.900
by the idea of accepting love from others,

32:39.900 --> 32:42.900
that is why this last scene of the movie belongs to Rocket.

32:42.900 --> 32:45.900
Rocket's entire worldview is built on the expectation

32:45.900 --> 32:47.900
that the people he loves will abandon him,

32:47.900 --> 32:50.900
and that he is not deserving of being loved.

32:50.900 --> 32:52.900
But the fact that his friends forgive him,

32:52.900 --> 32:54.900
and that the Ravagers forgive Yondu,

32:54.900 --> 32:57.900
completely shatters every foundational belief that Rocket had.

32:57.900 --> 33:00.900
In a way, that can be almost traumatic.

33:00.900 --> 33:03.900
There's this tough thing with applying fantastical space operas

33:03.900 --> 33:05.900
to real-world ethics and relationships.

33:05.900 --> 33:08.900
The decision to forgive abusers, or even abuse beneficiaries,

33:08.900 --> 33:10.900
is a deeply personal thing.

33:10.900 --> 33:12.900
And I like that the movie does draw a line.

33:12.900 --> 33:14.900
Sometimes people are way beyond forgiveness,

33:14.900 --> 33:16.900
but sometimes they're not.

33:16.900 --> 33:18.900
And even if you do decide to forgive,

33:18.900 --> 33:21.900
growing up in that environment still has influence to who you become.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.900
Family relationships are messy,

33:23.900 --> 33:26.900
much harder to put a satisfying little bow on than romantic relationships.

33:26.900 --> 33:29.900
But even then you can still consider someone family

33:29.900 --> 33:31.900
without being ready to give yourself over to a relationship.

33:31.900 --> 33:35.900
