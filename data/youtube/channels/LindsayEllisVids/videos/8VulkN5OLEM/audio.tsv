0	4000	Today, I want to talk about, um, Guardians of the Galaxy.
4000	6200	Showtime, a-holes!
6200	7900	Yeah, I'm kind of surprised too.
7900	14700	Despite the insistence on certain sects of the internets that there is some grand pro-Marvel, anti-DC conspiracy,
14700	18900	while on the whole I'd say I'm pretty sick of the media being flooded with superhero movies,
18900	25700	I neither have a particular love nor hate for the Marvel Cinematic Universe so much as I'm just exhausted by it.
25700	31000	But as for the quality of the individual films themselves, to me they run the gamut from,
31000	34200	eh, it's fine, to, eh, it's pretty good.
34200	40200	They rarely prompt a re-watch and they even more rarely evoke any kind of real emotional reaction in me.
40200	46200	So when I saw Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the third time, with Whiskey,
46200	51200	He may have been your father, boy, but he wasn't your daddy.
51200	54700	Ah! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
54700	58000	So I guess this one is joining Moana and too many cooks in the,
58000	61000	uh-oh, I'm drunk and there's a movie on, how did this happen club?
61000	66100	And I was not primed to feel, you know, anything about Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,
66100	69900	but in the end I've always kind of had mixed feelings on the whole Guardians franchise.
69900	74400	On the one hand, the first one came out at a time between Man of Steel and Batman v. Superman,
74400	79100	and even other Marvel movies that came out around that time were trending really grounded and serious.
79100	82800	So Grimdark looked like it might be the trend for all of superhero-dom.
82800	87200	Hell, hell, what's the matter with you?
87200	92400	Then enter Guardians of the Galaxy with its neon color scheme and its late 70s pop jazz soundtrack
92400	98200	to suddenly throw that grimdark trend into stark relief with something, you know, fun.
98200	99700	They got my dick missing!
99700	102900	So while I am glad that Guardians helped right the ship a little bit,
102900	105900	I don't think that the Guardians approach is beyond criticism.
105900	108300	For one thing, the film features more than a few jokey jokes
108300	111200	that featured more than a whiff of the old casual sexism.
111200	113000	Like Drax's little observation here.
113000	115000	And this green whore she took.
115000	116200	Oh, you must stop!
116200	119900	This doesn't even make sense because he'd literally have to think she was a prostitute
119900	123500	before you f***ing pedants tell me that there's a cutscene where someone calls her a whore,
123500	126000	and Drax does literally think she is a literal prostitute
126000	129000	because he takes all of the metaphors literally that's not in the final cut,
129000	130500	so this joke doesn't even make sense!
130500	131900	Oh, you must stop!
131900	136000	Guardians also suffers from possibly the weakest of any of the Marvel villains,
136100	139100	except for arguably the guy from Thor, The Dark World.
143400	145400	I couldn't even remember his name. I had to look it up.
145400	148100	He was a dark elf or something?
148100	151400	And I was like one of the eight people that actually kind of liked Thor, The Dark World.
151400	153900	Anyway, also I love that this character's name is Ronan.
153900	158800	Like if you spent any time in Ireland, I dare you to find a more common mundane name than Ronan.
158800	160900	There are some who call me...
162900	163900	Tim?
163900	165800	Greetings, Tim the Enchanter.
165800	169900	Although Disney flooding the advertising market with Baby Groot in the month before the movie came out
169900	171700	just really grated on me.
171700	174300	Everyone is paying too much for car insurance.
174300	176800	We've got to save them money.
176800	177700	I agree.
177700	181100	Baby Groot looks like a Funko Pop toy that's going to fill a million landfills
181100	184100	and be used as currency in the post-apocalyptic hellscape.
184100	187900	That loaf of bread is gonna cost you five and a half Baby Groot Funko Pops, please.
187900	191600	But I give Guardians a fairly decent pass by being a genuinely strong narrative
191600	193600	with likable and well-rounded characters.
193600	197900	So again, my hope for the second movie before it came out was that it would be, you know, fine.
197900	201500	Like, you know, Captain America Civil War was, you know, it was fine.
201500	204800	I went into Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 a bit skeptical.
204800	206400	I was not expecting...
206400	211600	I know I have to go.
211600	215200	Ehhhhhhhhh.
215200	217300	Welcome to the Drunk Cry Club, Guardians.
217300	220000	Prepare to be the subject of many embarrassing tweets.
220000	222000	Because I can pull all the personal anecdotes I want,
222000	225900	but at the end of the day, it really is kind of personal what strikes you and what doesn't.
225900	230600	I also want to address some points, subtext if you will, that I think some out there missed.
230600	233400	And this kind of hot take troubles me because some out there,
233400	235400	and therefore, by extension, our audience,
235400	239700	are perhaps seeing a little too much of themselves in our very, very deeply flawed protagonist.
239700	244400	Such to the point where they don't understand why our very flawed protagonist hasn't really gotten the girl yet.
244400	247300	Like the prize all manboys are promised at the end of every movie.
247300	248900	But don't worry, everyone.
249000	251100	I am here to explain this movie to you.
253000	254500	You will always be my sister.
254500	258600	Ehhhhhhhhh.
262800	267300	A lot of why I responded more positively to Guardians 2 than to Guardians 1 has to do with taste.
267300	270100	So, bear that in mind while I try to explain my...
270100	271500	details.
271500	277700	My favorite stories in films tend to be ones that, after a viewing, or two, or ten, and some whiskey,
277700	279900	you can distill into one very strong theme.
279900	284000	That uses its plot points to branch into several sub-themes that are driven by the plot,
284000	286200	but most importantly, by the characters.
286200	288200	That, to me, is the best speculative fiction.
288200	292700	Fiction that uses fantastical elements to explore questions about the nature of humanity.
292700	296500	In effect, all of the Guardians of the Galaxy conceit is about terrible people,
296500	298100	made terrible by abuse,
298100	300200	learning to care about society as a whole,
300200	302000	by learning to empathize with each other.
302000	305500	Finding friends where you, a terrible person, have none.
305500	308000	And how finding friends can make you a better person.
308000	309600	A Galaxy Guardian, even.
309600	311000	I look around at us.
312300	313300	You know what I see?
314800	315700	Losers.
315700	319400	I mean, like, folks who have lost stuff.
319400	321600	And we have, man. We have. All of us.
321600	323600	None of these characters were born bad.
323600	327300	They were made by Thanos, by Yondu, by tragedy,
327300	330200	or by dehumanization and disrespect from everyone.
330200	332100	But that these people can change.
332200	335700	As Movies with Mikey pointed out in his episode about Guardians of the Galaxy,
335700	338900	it's no coincidence that half the characters who were bad guys in the first movie
338900	340300	become good guys in the second.
340300	344600	The second movie expands on this theme, but more specifically, is about parenthood.
344600	347800	Hey, it'll be just a couple of days.
347800	349900	We'll be back before Rockets finish fixing the ship.
349900	352100	Let's take a look at that opening dance montage.
358400	360800	See, this honestly kind of bugged me the first time I saw it,
360800	363100	because it didn't have anything to do with the plot.
366800	371700	I kind of figured that maybe this would end up with Groot actually serving some purpose in this battle.
371700	374700	Like, maybe he might accidentally turn the tide of the battle with his dancing,
374700	378900	or, you know, the dancing might pay off in some way, or something, but it didn't.
378900	381200	No, this credit sequence didn't have anything to do with the plot,
381200	383400	but it had everything to do with the theme.
383400	387200	That is to say, every one of the Guardians gets a parenting moment with baby Groot.
387400	388400	Groot!
389600	390600	Hi!
394600	397600	No, no! Spit it out! Spit it out! Come on!
398800	400900	And that's another thing I really liked about the second movie,
400900	403100	is that a lot of theming was in the subtext.
403100	409900	Like, they never sit down and have a conversation about how difficult it is to be four parents to one baby Groot.
409900	416700	Like, man, so hard being one quarter co-parent in a galaxy with no socialized childcare.
416700	422400	So Guardians 2 is about finding your family, but with regard to parenthood, how your parents affect you.
422400	423500	We'll get to that later.
423500	426500	But what is the greatest challenge to the cohesion of the family?
426500	432800	It is not Ronan the Accuser, it is not Thanos, Destroyer of Worlds, it is not any outside force.
432800	436400	The greatest threat to the cohesion of the family is...
436400	437600	Ego.
437600	439100	My name is Ego.
439100	442300	And I do not mean Ego as in the character played by Kurt Russell.
442400	447300	I mean Ego as in the key component of the psychic apparatus defined by Sigmund Freud in 1920.
447300	452200	The villain in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is Ego, with a capital E,
452200	454700	but it is also the egotism of the characters.
454700	457700	To make it through that, you'd have to be the greatest pilot in the universe.
457700	459000	Lucky for us.
459000	460000	I, uh...
461200	465800	Peter's immaturity and near willingness to throw his friends under the bus at the chance of immortality,
465800	470900	Rocket's inability to admit that he lashes out at his loved ones because he assumes the worst about everyone,
470900	473000	sabotaging everything good in his life,
473000	478800	Yondu's inability to be truthful about his motivations and clinging to prestige until he has lost literally everything,
478800	484400	even Gamora, who as a child was so fixated on her own survival that she didn't see how much her little sister was suffering.
484400	488400	This is why Peter is the nucleus of the story, and to a lesser extent, Rocket.
488400	492600	Peter's ego is his greatest obstacle to becoming a fully realized person.
492600	496500	You're jealous because I'm part God, and you like when I'm the weak one.
496500	498700	You were insufferable to begin with.
498700	503500	And part of what makes the portrayal of Peter Quill probably the most confused element of the second film.
503500	508300	I don't consider it as confused in the first because the first film isn't terribly critical of Peter's immaturity
508300	511000	outside of when he's a basic jerk to people.
511000	513200	Indeed, Peter's immaturity saves the day.
513200	518100	Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier.
518100	521900	Ooh, child, things will get brighter.
521900	527300	But in the second movie, Peter's immaturity is a major character flaw, around which the entire plot revolves.
527300	533100	And the film much more clearly equates Peter's love of pop culture with the fact that, well, he needs to grow up.
533100	537100	It's a show that doesn't exist! That's why it would get zero ratings!
537100	539100	I don't know what Cheers is!
539100	543600	Sometimes that works effectively, but then there are these really dramatic moments where it's...
543600	544800	distracting.
546200	548100	Like, really?
548100	552900	Even ego himself seems to conflate compassion and concern for others with immaturity.
552900	555900	You really need to grow up!
555900	559700	Egotism in these films is tied to immaturity, and this is true for all of them.
559700	562800	These characters have come a long way since the beginning of the first movie.
562800	566300	Peter has matured, but clearly has a long way to go.
567800	569300	I thought your thing was a sword!
569300	574000	We've been hired to stop an interdimensional beast from feeding on those batteries, and I'm gonna stop it with a sword?
574000	576200	It's just swords were your thing, and guns were mine.
576200	579100	But I guess we're both doing guns now. I just didn't know that.
579100	583200	And this is how we start our movie. Ego gets in the way over basically nothing.
583200	585500	But hey, this flows right into that big question.
585500	590500	Peter, Gamora, why don't they do the do?
590500	596200	I see a lot of confusion over this term.
596200	603900	Like, people hear the term toxic masculinity, and they just think it means that being a man is bad.
603900	606100	Which...
606100	608100	...
608100	611000	...
611000	615600	seems like the most common point of contention is not the underlying concept, but the term itself.
615600	618900	I have single-handedly vanquished the beast!
618900	631000	So if you don't like the term toxic masculinity, why don't you call it, I don't know, detrimental dick-wagging or patriarchy frown-frowns or machismo no bueno, whatever.
631000	634900	For now, toxic masculinity is the term we have, so that's the one I'm going to use.
634900	642900	When we talk about toxic masculinity, the simplest way to describe it is men feeling the need to prove their perceived masculinity through unhealthy means,
642900	645900	harmful to others, but just as often, harmful to themselves.
645900	655900	These toxic elements are attached to attributes we as a culture tend to attach to masculinity, including but not limited to anger, being the strongest, pwnage,
655900	658400	Do you bleed?
658400	660400	eschewing emotional attachment.
660400	661400	Need a hug?
661400	662900	We're not a hugging family.
662900	663900	Damn straight.
663900	667400	Toxic masculinity eschews attributes associated with femininity.
667400	673900	Things like emotional vulnerability, crying, giving a shit about other people, and flowers.
675900	680900	I say associated with because obviously everyone has all of these things in them.
680900	682900	Women get angry and men like flowers.
682900	688900	So the fact that little boys are taught from a very young age that they're not allowed to cry or that expressing emotion is unmanly,
688900	691900	Is that what you've been filling your head with, boy?
691900	692900	Sentiment!
692900	694900	All of that is a part of toxic masculinity.
694900	701900	So with regard to the depiction of masculinity in Guardians, there's a lot you could deconstruct and some of it is a little contradictory.
701900	705900	If I had a blacklight, this would look like a Jackson Pollock painting.
705900	710900	But for simplicity's sake, let's look at Drax, Rocket, Yondu, and Peter.
710900	713900	Drax serves as an interesting deconstruction of the concept.
713900	717900	On the surface, he reads almost like a parody of the mid-90s comic hyper-masculine ideal.
717900	722900	Angry, revenge-driven, muscle-bound, reckless, and uncaring.
722900	727900	And the fact that he is primarily motivated by revenge for his murdered wife and daughter is noteworthy.
727900	728900	And also this.
728900	729900	In this green horror sheet.
729900	731900	Oh, you must stop!
731900	734900	But Drax also serves as an interesting deconstruction of the trope as well.
734900	736900	I'm uncertain about parting ways.
736900	737900	God, you're like an old woman.
737900	739900	Because I'm wise?
739900	744900	Part of taking everything literally means that Drax basically has no shame or insecurities.
744900	747900	He's not afraid of emotions associated with femininity.
747900	750900	He has no shame in talking about his love for his dead wife.
750900	753900	The most melodic song in the world could be playing.
753900	755900	She wouldn't even tap her foot.
755900	758900	Including how that affected him physiologically.
758900	761900	They would make my nether regions engorged.
761900	762900	Oh, I get it, yes.
762900	765900	He has no shame about bodily functions in general.
765900	767900	I have famously huge turds.
767900	771900	In fact, his parents recounting the tale of his conception is a thing of beauty to Drax.
771900	775900	My father would tell the story of impregnating my mother every winter solstice.
775900	776900	That's disgusting.
776900	778900	It was beautiful.
779900	781900	You Earthers have hang-ups.
781900	785900	Drax's position as the Gimli of the group, more of a comic relief character,
785900	787900	We dwarves are natural sprinters!
787900	792900	also makes him a bit of a wild card in terms of the way he relates to the other characters.
792900	794900	He's not above laughing at his friend's misfortune.
794900	798900	But there's this one scene at the end of the first Guardians movie that I think is underappreciated.
798900	801900	Rocket is openly weeping at the death of Groot.
801900	805900	Drax sits next to him and then pets him.
805900	808900	Rocket starts to resist, but then just lets him do it.
808900	812900	And you kind of expect Drax to say something mean and insensitive.
812900	813900	But he doesn't.
813900	815900	Neither of them say anything.
815900	819900	And this quiet moment is almost sort of a repudiation of toxic masculinity.
820900	824900	These two don't self-actualize by being the biggest or the baddest or killing the most,
824900	828900	but by being vulnerable and validating that vulnerability.
828900	832900	But that is not to say that Rocket has grown past his toxic tendencies by the second movie.
832900	833900	Far from it.
833900	836900	They told me you people were conceited douchebags.
836900	838900	But that isn't true at all.
838900	843900	As the film starts out with a dick-wagging contest between him and Peter that nearly gets everyone killed.
843900	846900	To make it through that, you'd have to be the greatest pilot in the universe.
846900	847900	You're lucky for us.
847900	848900	I am.
849900	851900	Which Gamora spells out explicitly.
851900	854900	Either one of you could have gotten us through that field
854900	857900	had you flown with what's between your ears instead of what's between your legs.
857900	862900	But Rocket's self-sabotaging tendencies are spelled out most explicitly with his relationship with Yondu,
862900	865900	who is second only to Rocket as to how much he deludes himself,
865900	869900	especially with regard to his relationship with his adoptive son, Peter.
869900	872900	Why didn't you deliver Quill the ego like you promised?
872900	874900	He was skinny.
874900	877900	Could fit into places we couldn't.
877900	878900	Good for thieving.
878900	881900	Whom he threatens to kill multiple times in the first movie,
881900	884900	but also always gives Peter an out to save face with his boys.
884900	888900	So much so that Peter seems aware that that's exactly what Yondu is doing,
888900	891900	which seems reinforced by the fact that this is Yondu's reaction
891900	894900	when he realizes that Peter didn't give him an Infinity Stone.
894900	897900	Yondu has gone to incredibly great lengths to protect Peter,
897900	900900	but he is completely dishonest with himself as to why.
900900	903900	No matter how many times Quill betrays you,
903900	906900	you protect him like none of the rest of us much matter.
906900	907900	Yeah!
907900	910900	It's no coincidence that the guy who takes over after him
910900	913900	is a parody of this hyper-masculine idea named
913900	916900	Taserface!
916900	920900	And Yondu is so attached with this construct he has built for himself
920900	923900	that only after he loses everything, his captainship,
923900	926900	the entirety of his crew who is loyal to him,
926900	930900	is he finally able to be honest with himself about why he is the way he is,
930900	933900	and by extension, why Rocket is the way he is.
933900	935900	I know you play like you're the meanest and the hardest,
935900	937900	but actually you're the most scared of all.
937900	938900	Shut up!
938900	940900	I know you steal batteries you don't need,
940900	943900	and you push away anyone who's willing to put up with you,
943900	946900	because just a little bit of love reminds you how big and empty
946900	948900	that hole inside you actually is.
948900	949900	I said shut up!
949900	952900	And then there is Peter, womanizing, insecure,
952900	955900	overcompensating, narcissistic, and lacking in empathy.
955900	958900	The first movie begins with him kicking small animals around for fun.
958900	960900	By the second movie, he has improved a bit.
960900	963900	At the very least, he's aware that diplomacy is a thing.
963900	965900	Careful what you say around these folks.
965900	966900	They're easily offended.
966900	968900	The cost of transgression is death.
968900	971900	But he is also threatened by Gamora using the same weapon as him,
971900	975900	and also gets into that contest of egos with Rocket that nearly gets them all killed.
975900	977900	If this between my legs had a hand on it,
977900	979900	I guarantee I could have landed this ship with it.
979900	982900	Peter, we almost died because of your arrogance.
982900	986900	Peter, like all of us, is the product of the values that are instilled in him.
986900	988900	He lost his mother when he was 12,
988900	990900	so most of these values he did not get from his mother
990900	993900	or from his biological father, who he does not know.
993900	994900	He got it from Yondu.
994900	997900	Is that what she's been filling your head with, boy?
997900	998900	Sentiment!
998900	1002900	And deep down, maybe Yondu's intent was ultimately to protect Peter,
1002900	1005900	but the effect was, well, abusive.
1005900	1007900	You said you were gonna eat me!
1007900	1009900	That was being funny!
1009900	1011900	Not to me!
1013900	1018900	Damn, is it time for shit to get real already?
1018900	1022900	So if a big theme of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is parenthood,
1022900	1025900	then there is the subcategory abusive parenthood.
1025900	1029900	I will hunt my father like a dog and I will tear him apart slowly,
1029900	1031900	piece by piece,
1031900	1037900	until he knows some semblance of the profound and unceasing pain I know every single day.
1037900	1040900	The only parent figure who escapes unscathed is Peter's mother,
1040900	1044900	and arguably Drax, who may or may not have been a good parent, we don't know.
1044900	1048900	Ego was absent and neglectful, and then widespread genocidal.
1048900	1049900	Rocket's creators were abusive.
1049900	1051900	Yondu's parents sold him into slavery.
1051900	1057900	Just like my own damn parents who sold me, their own little baby, into slavery!
1057900	1061900	Yondu abused Peter up until basically the last moments of his life,
1061900	1063900	and then there's Thanos.
1063900	1064900	We'll get to you, Thanos.
1064900	1069900	And here's a sentiment I have seen on the Tumblr fringes regarding Yondu's redemption arc.
1069900	1073900	Since the movie cops to Yondu being an abusive parent, but absolves him anyway,
1073900	1075900	basically condoning abuse.
1075900	1078900	I'm sorry I didn't do none of it right.
1078900	1080900	I'm damn lucky you're my boy.
1080900	1085900	But I really don't think that's true or fair, or that any relationship is as simple as that.
1085900	1088900	Because this ties into another theme regarding family.
1088900	1093900	Choosing when to cut people out of your life, and choosing when to forgive.
1093900	1095900	It shows that neither of these things are necessarily permanent.
1096900	1098900	Peter effectively cut Yondu out,
1098900	1101900	and Nebula and Gamora spend the better part of two movies trying to kill each other.
1101900	1104900	But there are some relationships, as in the case of Thanos,
1104900	1106900	that do need to be permanently severed.
1106900	1109900	And despite the fantastical backdrop of these movies,
1109900	1113900	that Yondu is a blue alien with a whistle-pathic death arrow,
1113900	1117900	and sisters Gamora and Nebula are genetically altered cyborg assassins,
1117900	1122900	the underlying emotions are grounded in real, basic human relationships.
1122900	1125900	I know you haven't been in a literal fight like this with a family member,
1128900	1133900	but you've probably been in a fight that felt like this with a family member.
1133900	1137900	Both of these storylines end with the characters having to do some intense self-reflection
1137900	1141900	to recognize how they hurt the people they loved, and ultimately end in forgiveness.
1143900	1146900	This doesn't absolve bad things, but it means forgiveness is possible.
1146900	1149900	And that's why I feel like the Gamora and Nebula subplot is a lot more interesting
1149900	1151900	than most people have given it credit for.
1151900	1154900	Gamora and Nebula are the adopted daughters of Thanos.
1154900	1159900	It is implied that they had other siblings who didn't survive the process of being adopted by Thanos.
1160900	1164900	Out of all our siblings, I hated you least.
1164900	1166900	And it is implied that Gamora and Nebula were close,
1166900	1170900	but were driven apart by their adoptive father, forcing them to compete against each other.
1170900	1174900	As a child, my father would have Gamora and me battle one another in training.
1174900	1181900	But she won. Again, and again, and again, never once refraining.
1181900	1187900	And Nebula, no matter how much she hates Thanos, also resents the shit out of Gamora for being Thanos' favorite.
1187900	1190900	You alienated my favorite daughter, Gamora.
1192900	1194900	It's kind of a petty sibling rivalry thing in the first movie,
1194900	1198900	but this moment here in the second casts all of that in a different light.
1198900	1201900	You were the one who wanted to win, and I just wanted a sister!
1202900	1208900	The dynamic between Gamora and Nebula might read as familiar for people who grew up in households with abusive or addicted parents,
1208900	1212900	and that is the displacement of anger from the abuser, in this case Thanos,
1212900	1216900	to an older sibling or parent that failed to stop the abuser or the addict.
1216900	1221900	Thanos pulled my eye from my head, and my brain from my skull.
1221900	1222900	Because of you.
1222900	1228900	Nebula seems to be petty and jealous, but really, Gamora could have just once thrown herself under the bus to protect her little sister,
1228900	1229900	but she never did.
1229900	1232900	And no, it's not fair to put that kind of emotional burden on a child.
1232900	1234900	I was a child like you.
1235900	1239900	I was concerned with staying alive until the next day, every day.
1239900	1242900	And I never considered what Thanos was doing to you.
1242900	1244900	But that's what it's like growing up in abusive households,
1244900	1247900	and that resentment is real and extremely common.
1247900	1251900	It can be even harder for people to forgive a sibling or a parent who failed to stop abuse
1251900	1253900	than it is to forgive the abuser.
1253900	1256900	And having survived this abuse as well is a big piece of Gamora's puzzle.
1256900	1258900	Peter is obnoxious and immature, sure,
1258900	1262900	but Gamora has put up all of the walls just as a matter of survival.
1262900	1266900	And she's not to a place yet where she's really ready to take them down.
1266900	1270900	Accepting that she failed her sister over and over for years is a bitter enough pill to swallow.
1270900	1274900	The abusive parent theme also shows up with Mantis, but here is where it gets shaky.
1274900	1277900	I've seen some criticism that I won't dismiss,
1277900	1281900	that it is a shame that Gunn bore down so hard with the submissive Asian woman trope.
1281900	1283900	That is true, that happened.
1283900	1286900	But I'm more bothered by how all the other characters treat her
1286900	1288900	with regard to the surviving abusive parent's theme.
1288900	1292900	He raised me by hand and kept me as his own.
1292900	1294900	So you're a pet.
1294900	1296900	She is raised by ego.
1296900	1298900	He is effectively the only parent she knows,
1298900	1301900	but everything from her body language to the way she talks about him
1301900	1303900	shows that she is afraid of him.
1303900	1306900	She is just as much a survivor of abuse as the rest of them,
1306900	1309900	but Mantis' pain is almost exclusively played for jokes.
1309900	1312900	Which is to say nothing about the way Drax talks to her.
1312900	1314900	I am hideous?
1314900	1317900	You are horrifying to look at, yes.
1317900	1319900	It is played as a joke that he would find her unattractive,
1319900	1322900	but even if it is a joke that works in character,
1322900	1324900	it still turns her abuse into a joke.
1324900	1326900	This gross bug lady is my new friend.
1326900	1329900	I'm learning many things like I'm a pet and ugly.
1329900	1332900	So it is kind of disappointing, and it muddies the waters a bit,
1332900	1335900	that we can acknowledge some characters' abuse is legitimate,
1335900	1337900	but in others it is played for comedy.
1339900	1341900	Mantis! Look out!
1343900	1346900	So now we've come full circle.
1346900	1348900	Why don't they do it already?
1348900	1350900	So given that the dissonance we've discussed
1350900	1352900	between the framing of Peter's immaturity
1352900	1355900	and the fact that he is not rewarded with a girl at the end of either movie
1355900	1357900	has proven confusing for some,
1357900	1360900	because movies are generally not critical of our male lead's immaturity,
1360900	1362900	and the film does start to go down the road
1362900	1364900	of critiquing Peter's type of immaturity
1364900	1366900	that is so often forgiven or ignored in movies,
1366900	1368900	often movies starring Chris Pratt.
1368900	1372900	You want to consult here or in my bungalow?
1372900	1376900	But the film ultimately has trouble to really challenge Peter as a character.
1376900	1379900	Maybe Gunn is saving that for the third one, I don't know.
1379900	1381900	So what normally happens in movies like this
1381900	1383900	is our lovable, immature man-child gets the girl.
1383900	1385900	This, like the nerd nostalgia thing,
1385900	1388900	is because our lovable, immature man-child is the audience's surrogate,
1388900	1390900	and his lovable immaturity isn't really a character flaw
1390900	1392900	that needs to be overcome,
1392900	1394900	so much as how the filmmakers think the audience sees itself.
1394900	1396900	I'm a killer, a stone-cold killer.
1397900	1399900	And there is definitely some of that at work with Peter's character,
1399900	1402900	and it also feeds into the dissonance of Peter's portrayal.
1402900	1405900	His lovable immaturity is both framed as relatable,
1405900	1407900	but also as a character flaw.
1407900	1410900	Observe the scene where Peter is ranting about his sense of entitlement
1410900	1412900	at Gamora because the media he grew up with
1412900	1415900	told him he is owed a relationship.
1415900	1418900	You know what? This is not Cheers, after all.
1418900	1420900	This is whatever the show is where one person
1420900	1423900	is willing to open themselves up to new possibility,
1423900	1425900	and the other person is a jerk.
1426900	1428900	I don't know what Cheers is!
1428900	1431900	Like, yeah, why wouldn't she find that attractive?
1431900	1433900	But ignoring some of the framing dissonance
1433900	1435900	where the movie can't decide if Peter's pop culture
1435900	1438900	referencing womanizing immaturity is fun and relatable,
1438900	1439900	or if he needs to grow up.
1439900	1441900	I'm gonna make some weird shit.
1441900	1443900	The reason why they aren't together goes deeper
1443900	1445900	than doofy guy meets eye-rolling over serious,
1445900	1447900	hyper-competent female colleague.
1447900	1451900	The reason that Gamora and Peter cannot be together, yet,
1451900	1453900	is that they are not complete people,
1453900	1455900	at least not in the way that means they have anything
1455900	1457900	good and healthy to offer in a relationship.
1457900	1459900	And at least one of them recognizes this.
1459900	1463900	Gamora and Peter are both radioactive spike balls
1463900	1464900	of defense mechanisms.
1464900	1467900	Even Peter's womanizing, which largely gets played as a joke,
1467900	1470900	This is, like, from a smoking hot Ray Jack girl.
1470900	1471900	Stabbed me with a fork.
1471900	1473900	Didn't like me skipping out on her sunrise.
1473900	1475900	I got right here a Cree girl.
1475900	1476900	Tried to rip out my thorax.
1476900	1478900	She caught me with this skinny little Oscar Mirian
1478900	1479900	who worked in Nova Records.
1479900	1481900	I was trying to get information.
1481900	1484900	is his own defense against letting himself get close to women.
1484900	1487900	Peter is only just starting to come to terms with his mother's death.
1487900	1489900	I had to watch her die!
1489900	1491900	And this ties into a scene that I didn't give that much thought
1491900	1493900	the first time I saw it.
1493900	1496900	Peter refuses to open the last gift his mother gave to him.
1496900	1497900	Because when you lose a parent,
1497900	1499900	especially when you lose a parent that young,
1499900	1501900	you seal away what little you have of them
1501900	1504900	as a way of keeping from having to let go.
1504900	1507900	This is the last thing he will ever get from his mother.
1507900	1509900	He has a lot of guilt over how he handled his mother's death.
1509900	1511900	Take my hand.
1514900	1515900	Peter.
1515900	1517900	Even then, as if he refused to take her hand,
1517900	1518900	she wouldn't die.
1518900	1522900	So it's significant that Peter put off opening this gift for 20 some odd years.
1522900	1525900	Once he opens it, that's the last thing he'll ever get from her.
1525900	1528900	There is a direct line drawn between Gamora and Peter's mother
1528900	1530900	in the first movie with this.
1530900	1532900	Take my hand!
1536900	1538900	Take my hand, Peter.
1538900	1541900	And in the second movie, through Ego, making that connection.
1541900	1544900	Like the child I put in your mother.
1544900	1547900	Or the freedom you brought Gamora.
1547900	1550900	Brandy, you're a fine girl.
1550900	1552900	What a good wife you would be.
1552900	1555900	And it is significant that Ego was so threatened
1555900	1557900	by his love for another person
1557900	1560900	that it makes perfect sense to him to kill that other person
1560900	1563900	so his own sense of narcissism won't be threatened by that.
1563900	1566900	I returned to Earth to see her three times.
1566900	1570900	And I knew if I returned a fourth, I'd never leave.
1570900	1572900	But...
1572900	1576900	it broke my heart to put that tumor in her head.
1576900	1578900	Gamora has not yet learned how to let people in,
1578900	1581900	but Peter is still in the process of coming to terms with his own mother's death
1581900	1583900	and how that informs the way he relates to people.
1583900	1586900	And both of them have come a long way, but neither of them are there yet.
1586900	1589900	That's why the movie ends not in them making out over funeral fireworks
1589900	1592900	after Gamora admits that, yeah, she might have feelings for him,
1592900	1594900	but with platonic side hug.
1594900	1598900	So perhaps there were some that didn't find Guardians Vol. 2 narratively satisfying
1598900	1601900	because rather than rewarding Chris Pratt's egotism and immaturity
1601900	1604900	with his hyper-competent female co-star as a reward,
1604900	1607900	instead the film paints Peter's narcissism, misogyny, and character flaws
1607900	1609900	as an obstacle to being in a relationship.
1609900	1613900	Oh, I get it. You're jealous because I'm part God
1613900	1615900	and you like when I'm the weak one.
1615900	1617900	Which is not something you see all that often in Hollywood movies,
1617900	1619900	especially movies starring Chris Pratt.
1619900	1623900	I know it can be kind of jarring having the male protagonist's lovable misogyny
1623900	1626900	be anything but 100% vindicated by the end of the film.
1626900	1629900	But the question of Peter and Gamora, will they, won't they,
1629900	1631900	is more of an emotional subplot.
1631900	1634900	It's not the focus of the film, nor is it the film's emotional core.
1634900	1637900	To the surprise of pretty much everyone,
1637900	1640900	the emotional core of the movie is Yondu.
1640900	1642900	I'm very popular!
1647900	1650900	So I know I originally framed this around my emotional reaction to the film
1650900	1653900	and then didn't really talk about it. Yet.
1656900	1659900	I lost my father about a year and a half ago.
1659900	1663900	Peter lost his adoptive father to the cold and feeling vacuum of space.
1663900	1665900	I lost mine in a similar manner.
1665900	1668900	Here on Earth, the term for it is Parkinson's disease.
1668900	1670900	But it wasn't this scene that got to me.
1670900	1674900	He may have been your father, boy, but he wasn't your daddy.
1675900	1677900	It was this one.
1677900	1680900	I told Gamora how, when I was a kid,
1680900	1683900	I used to pretend David Hasselhoff was my dad.
1683900	1685900	Earlier it struck me.
1686900	1690900	Yondu didn't have a talking car, but he did have a flying arrow.
1690900	1693900	He didn't have the beautiful voice of an angel,
1693900	1695900	but he did have the whistle of one.
1695900	1697900	I had a pretty cool dad.
1697900	1701900	Because I've been there, I've had to give a eulogy for my father.
1701900	1704900	And a part of the process of figuring that out
1704900	1706900	is having to put their life in a context.
1706900	1708900	And that's always impossibly difficult.
1708900	1712900	The expectation for the reaction of a child after a parent dies
1712900	1714900	is more akin to Peter's mother,
1714900	1716900	unquestioning veneration of the parent.
1716900	1720900	But you left the most wonderful woman ever
1720900	1722900	to die alone!
1722900	1724900	But what do you do, how do you feel,
1724900	1727900	when your parents were not, shall we say, perfect?
1727900	1729900	I'm not going to get into the details,
1729900	1732900	but Parkinson's disease changes one's personality.
1732900	1735900	It changes their physiology, drastically but slowly,
1735900	1738900	over a period of many, many years.
1738900	1741900	And when you lose a parent to a chronic illness like I did,
1741900	1744900	it's only after they die that you realize
1744900	1746900	how much of your memory of the illness
1746900	1748900	dominates your memory of them.
1748900	1750900	And it's only after they're gone that you realize
1750900	1753900	that you've forgotten that there was a time before it got bad.
1753900	1755900	That there was something before all this
1755900	1757900	that helped form who you are as a person.
1757900	1759900	No, my dad never put a bounty on me.
1759900	1761900	I want him! Put a bounty on him!
1761900	1763900	Nor did he threaten to eat me.
1763900	1765900	Nor did he beat me up to teach me how to fight.
1765900	1768900	He kicked the crap out of me so I could learn to fight
1768900	1770900	and kept me in terror by threatening to eat me.
1770900	1772900	In fact, he wouldn't even let me take karate classes.
1772900	1774900	But the last few years of his life
1774900	1777900	were not him sweetly, quietly going into that good night.
1777900	1780900	So this moment right here...
1780900	1782900	I had a pretty cool dad.
1782900	1785900	...was where the broken, open weeping started.
1785900	1787900	Coming to terms with the death of a parent,
1787900	1790900	well, I'll let you know if it's even possible,
1790900	1792900	if I ever get there.
1792900	1795900	I've even seen Chris Pratt tweeting about his dad on Father's Day
1795900	1797900	and made me cry for like an hour.
1797900	1799900	And there are a lot of movies where parents die,
1799900	1801900	but this movie is one of the few in the mainstream
1801900	1804900	that addresses the complex feeling of losing a parent
1804900	1806900	who you had a complicated relationship with.
1806900	1808900	The other obvious example being Big Fish.
1808900	1811900	Yondu let everyone down at one point.
1811900	1814900	His adoptive son, his adoptive father,
1814900	1816900	and his kindred spirit.
1816900	1818900	But Yondu was also all of us.
1818900	1820900	I know who you are, boy!
1820900	1822900	Because you're me!
1822900	1825900	And before we go, I need to talk about Rocket for a second.
1825900	1828900	Rocket is, and I mean this in its intended sense,
1828900	1830900	triggered by condescension.
1830900	1832900	You just wanna laugh at me like everyone else!
1832900	1834900	Rocket, you're drunk, alright? No one's laughing at you.
1834900	1836900	He thinks I'm some stupid thing!
1836900	1837900	He does!
1837900	1840900	People disrespecting him is a psychological trigger for Rocket.
1840900	1843900	The plot begins in earnest when Rocket steals some batteries
1843900	1845900	because he feels condescended to by the Sovereign,
1845900	1847900	prompting their retaliation
1847900	1850900	and then everyone being correctly angry at Rocket.
1850900	1853900	Because he stole Anulac's batteries!
1853900	1855900	They're called Harbulary batteries.
1855900	1856900	No they're not!
1856900	1858900	Does Rocket concede to his mistake?
1858900	1860900	No, he doubles down.
1860900	1862900	I did it because I wanted to!
1862900	1863900	Dick.
1863900	1865900	Rocket engages in some serious self-sabotage
1865900	1868900	because deep down, he expects to be abandoned
1868900	1870900	by the people he loves.
1870900	1873900	Hope daddy isn't as big of a dick as you, orphan boy.
1874900	1876900	What is your goal here?
1877900	1879900	To get everybody to hate you?
1879900	1881900	Because it's working.
1883900	1886900	At the end of the film, Rocket has bonded with Yondu,
1886900	1888900	probably more than he ever did with Peter,
1888900	1890900	and he gives Yondu one means of escape
1890900	1892900	and one means of survival.
1892900	1895900	Yondu can either save himself or Peter, but not both.
1895900	1898900	And without hesitation, Yondu chooses Peter.
1898900	1902900	Yondu's sacrifice ultimately leads Rocket to telling the Ravagers what Yondu did.
1902900	1905900	I sent word that Yondu's old Ravager buddies told them what he did.
1905900	1909900	And Yondu's old adoptive family forgives Yondu for his big crime,
1909900	1911900	which was effectively child trafficking,
1911900	1913900	and then giving him a Ravager funeral.
1921900	1924900	And see also this moment here where Peter acknowledges
1924900	1927900	that Rocket kind of just wants to be accepted.
1927900	1929900	He didn't chase him away.
1929900	1931900	No.
1931900	1933900	Even though he yelled at him,
1933900	1936900	I was always mean.
1937900	1940900	And he stole batteries he didn't need.
1941900	1945900	Rocket's damage centers wholly around a fear of condescension and rejection,
1945900	1949900	a fear so profound that he creates scenarios for his friends to reject him.
1949900	1952900	But then Rocket sees so much of himself in Yondu,
1952900	1955900	who himself was rejected by his surrogate father, Stalker.
1955900	1957900	But especially in how both of them are so threatened
1957900	1959900	by the idea of accepting love from others,
1959900	1962900	that is why this last scene of the movie belongs to Rocket.
1962900	1965900	Rocket's entire worldview is built on the expectation
1965900	1967900	that the people he loves will abandon him,
1967900	1970900	and that he is not deserving of being loved.
1970900	1972900	But the fact that his friends forgive him,
1972900	1974900	and that the Ravagers forgive Yondu,
1974900	1977900	completely shatters every foundational belief that Rocket had.
1977900	1980900	In a way, that can be almost traumatic.
1980900	1983900	There's this tough thing with applying fantastical space operas
1983900	1985900	to real-world ethics and relationships.
1985900	1988900	The decision to forgive abusers, or even abuse beneficiaries,
1988900	1990900	is a deeply personal thing.
1990900	1992900	And I like that the movie does draw a line.
1992900	1994900	Sometimes people are way beyond forgiveness,
1994900	1996900	but sometimes they're not.
1996900	1998900	And even if you do decide to forgive,
1998900	2001900	growing up in that environment still has influence to who you become.
2001900	2003900	Family relationships are messy,
2003900	2006900	much harder to put a satisfying little bow on than romantic relationships.
2006900	2009900	But even then you can still consider someone family
2009900	2011900	without being ready to give yourself over to a relationship.
2011900	2015900	And that's the reason this film is more interesting than your typical love story.
2015900	2018900	The evolution of family dynamics has more longevity in a franchise,
2018900	2022900	and in itself has proven the key to the MCU's longevity.
2022900	2024900	If nothing else, it has, at long last,
2024900	2026900	finally gotten me to feel a feeling.
