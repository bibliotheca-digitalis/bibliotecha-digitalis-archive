1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So, last week I was in a restaurant in North Carolina and we were sitting at the bar and

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,560
the owner was sitting right there because they were about to close and my mother starts

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,800
talking to her and somehow or other the owner just looks at me and she's like, well, what

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,800
do you do?

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,600
And, you know, I wasn't about to tell her I'm a YouTuber, so I was like, I'm a writer.

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,960
I mean, I am technically.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,960
And she's like, well, what do you do?

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,920
So, I told her my name and she's like, I'm going to Google you and I was like, okay,

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,920
I'm super canceled right now.

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,220
And she like laughed and clearly thought I was kidding or maybe didn't know what that

11
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,480
meant or, you know, knew it in some like right wing way.

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,520
And then she like Googled me and like started laughing because the first thing and, you

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,000
know, like the questions people ask is, why is Lindsay Ellis canceled?

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,740
And I mean, why indeed?

15
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,120
But before I get into this, I need to lay some groundwork.

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,160
Ladies and boomers of the jury, here you go.

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,680
Shaming is a public shaming of a member of a community for some violation of that community

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,780
standards by other members of that community.

19
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,700
But the term actually originated with a 1981 song called Your Love is Canceled by the band

20
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,700
Chic.

21
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,560
The song was inspired by a bad date guitarist Niall Richards went on at the height of the

22
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,040
band's success wherein his date behaved in a way that he felt was presumptuous and unacceptable,

23
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,320
which really turned him off.

24
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:28,200
Your love is canceled No, your love is canceled

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,440
So basically, it was inspired by this idea of any potential future we might have had

26
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,540
any potential love that might have developed canceled.

27
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:40,020
The song was not a hit at the time, but it stuck around and over the decades, the term

28
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,760
as used in the song started appearing in other pieces of art and music, including in songs

29
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:50,160
by rappers like 50 Cent and Lou Wayne until eventually gaining popularity in the vernacular

30
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,180
of black Twitter.

31
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,460
In this original vernacular use, declaring someone or something canceled was not really

32
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:02,140
an attempt to like instigate a boycott or hold someone to account, but more of a personal

33
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:07,460
decision, not unlike Chic's original song, canceling them in the television of your mind.

34
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,440
So to cancel someone wasn't a call to deplatform.

35
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,940
It was more just saying, you stepped out of line, so I'm done with you.

36
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:20,100
Like when the city of New York canceled Mayor de Blasio for eating pizza with fork and knife,

37
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,680
which to be fair is the only reason to criticize the man.

38
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,220
The connotation of this term with call outs and deplatforming didn't happen until a few

39
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,120
years ago as Me Too began and call outs did lead to some powerful people actually losing

40
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
things.

41
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,800
According to Washington Post writer Clyde McGrady, as call outs led to greater consequences,

42
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,580
some people became nervous about how social media had changed power dynamics in the court

43
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,140
of public opinion.

44
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,140
Cancel culture was the diagnosis and the term became a catch all defense for those trying

45
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,820
to evade public criticism of any kind.

46
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:54,260
But now cancel is just another word that white people have taken and run into the ground.

47
00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:00,620
So like woke before it, it has gone from AAV vernacular to right wing grievance buzzword,

48
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,000
which is more or less where we are today.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,300
Pretty quickly and we are now seeing wokeism and diversity and inclusion.

50
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,580
This is just the cancel culture and I will tell you, the people at home should be scared

51
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,500
because their ballgame is next, their business will be next.

52
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,380
If it continues, it won't just be Republicans who get cancelled, it won't just be the president

53
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,180
of the United States.

54
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,100
The cancel culture will come for us all.

55
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,900
So I have a lot that I want to unpack here because I've had a bit of an ordeal that

56
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,060
led to me realizing that I was bad for Twitter and Twitter was bad for me.

57
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,180
And so I deleted my account.

58
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,340
And for some dumb fucking reason, the fact that I deleted my Twitter account not only

59
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,980
made like actual news, my name was trending for several days.

60
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,860
Is this another video about canceling or worse, the dreaded apology video?

61
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,780
Like do these people not realize I'm not a real celebrity?

62
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:59,420
I'm the number 21,000th ish most subscribed channel on YouTube and I've published all

63
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,740
of one book that only reached number seven on the New York Times list, but it did hit

64
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,900
the New York Times list.

65
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,540
So we'll get into why in a minute, but like I'm neither going to go full Andrew Cuomo,

66
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,600
pew pew, I'm being canceled by multiple credible allegations.

67
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,360
You're never going to be president, Andy.

68
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,280
Or full crying apology video, though those do seem to be good for business.

69
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:26,040
And I just ask that you press pause for a moment and even just for 10 seconds, just

70
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,280
cover this in prayer because there is so much healing that needs to take place.

71
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,280
Some of the time.

72
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,280
No, sir.

73
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,860
I've decided to do the one thing Americans should never do and vote third party.

74
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,180
It's been a long time since we've done a list, hasn't it?

75
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,380
So here we go.

76
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:50,660
List part one, Twitter is garbage in the halcyon days of the early 2010s.

77
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:55,940
Justine Sacco was a PR executive who traveled often for work and not having many Twitter

78
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:00,900
followers herself often tweeted pity little nothings, which on the morning of December

79
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:07,060
20th, 2013, as she was boarding a flight at Heathrow for a work trip included this tweet

80
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,060
going to Africa.

81
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,700
Hope I don't get AIDS.

82
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,220
Just kidding.

83
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,220
I'm white.

84
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:21,420
Okay, so on its face, this is pretty inexcusable.

85
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,740
It didn't take long for the tweet to catch the eye of Sam Biddle, then an editor at Gawker

86
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,580
Media, whose signal boosted it with a comment.

87
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,420
And now a funny holiday joke from IAC's new PR boss.

88
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,100
The flight from Heathrow to Cape Town was 11 hours.

89
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:42,540
And in that 11 hours, attention to this tweet spread like wildfire, incredulity, horror,

90
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,280
disgust, and also very quickly, glee, excitement.

91
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,020
Sacco had less than 200 followers and being on a plane with no internet, didn't know that

92
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:56,440
she was Twitter's villain of the day, nor that she was one of the top trends worldwide.

93
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,160
So there was a delicious irony to the fact that this woman had been canceled and didn't

94
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,160
even know it.

95
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,000
She had her flight number, tracked it obsessively, were just thrilled with this idea that she

96
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,840
was going to land, and realized she had been found out.

97
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,580
The hashtag has Justine landed yet also began to trend.

98
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,200
Someone even went to the Cape Town airport when she landed, took a picture of her, and

99
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,040
shared it with the rest of the world.

100
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,880
A few months later, upon being asked why it appealed to him, Sam Biddle said of the incident,

101
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,140
The fact that she was a PR chief made it delicious.

102
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:38,560
It's satisfying to be able to say, okay, let's make a racist tweet by a senior IAC employee

103
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,900
count this time.

104
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,900
And it did.

105
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,040
I'd do it again.

106
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,300
But while people of course gleefully obsessed over the tweet, no one seems interested in

107
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,360
why she said it or what she meant by it.

108
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,380
No matter how you cut it, it's a bad look.

109
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,760
It's a flagrant flaunting of privilege.

110
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:59,800
So it's funny that she got fired and I mean, I'm not gonna, she had it bad for a while.

111
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:06,060
And like, I don't want to speculate on exactly how ruined her life was, but it would also

112
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,480
be reasonable to assume that this is a joke about white privilege, right?

113
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,680
That it was bad and insensitive and made light of a terrible affliction that still kills

114
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,160
thousands of people every day, but that she didn't mean it literally.

115
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,420
And at the time, everyone involved seemed to think that of course she deserved to have

116
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:27,640
her life ruined over it, even if they understood it was a joke about white privilege.

117
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,680
Christine Sacco's family in South Africa were African National Congress supporters,

118
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,400
the party of Nelson Mandela.

119
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,360
They were long-time activists for racial equality.

120
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,600
So while I can't read her original intent, perhaps she felt worldly enough and enough

121
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,040
in the club and enough of an ally that she could comfortably make such a joke and that

122
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,680
it would be understood.

123
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,920
White people do this a lot and I cannot say I am not guilty of this too.

124
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,880
A year later, Sacco said to Jon Ronson, author of So You've Been Publicly Shamed,

125
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,920
To me it was so insane of a comment for anyone to make, I thought there was no way that anyone

126
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,800
could possibly think it was literal.

127
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,760
Living in America puts us in a bit of a bubble when it comes to what is going on in the third

128
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,760
world.

129
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,400
I was making fun of that bubble.

130
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,520
While also conceding, I had no business commenting on the epidemic in such a politically incorrect

131
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,720
manner on such a public platform.

132
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,120
Biddle got caught up in his own shitstorm when he tweeted the following in 2014.

133
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,480
And you'll never guess who was mad on the internet in 2014.

134
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,480
Ultimately, Gamergate is reaffirming what we've known to be true for decades.

135
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,600
Nerds should be constantly shamed and degraded into submission.

136
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,480
Then adding, bring back bullying.

137
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,840
I was there, man.

138
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,280
Bold of you to provoke them like that.

139
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,640
Well, you can guess what happened.

140
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,300
There was a massive campaign against him, some from obvious bad faith right wing trolls,

141
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:53,400
but some who seemed to think that he literally was advocating for a return to the 1950s where

142
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,040
dumping books of dorky middle schoolers was de rigueur.

143
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,100
Biddle publicly apologized to Sacco on the anniversary of her, well, it wasn't called

144
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,700
canceling yet, Twitter-wide dog pile, let's call it, writing,

145
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,560
Twitter is a fast machine that almost begs for misunderstanding and misconstrual.

146
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,660
Deliberate misreading is its lubricant.

147
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,760
The same flatness of affect that can make it such a weird and funny place also makes

148
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,780
it a tricky and dangerous one.

149
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,200
Jokes are complicated.

150
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,560
Context is hard.

151
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,560
Rage is easy.

152
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,960
By this point, they had actually become friends, and comparing their experiences, he said,

153
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,440
structurally, we had made the same sort of joke.

154
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,480
Here is what a truly horrible person, a person whose attitudes were entirely opposite from

155
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,240
mine and those of the people who know me, would say.

156
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,700
You could argue that hers was worse, conjuring a real and pernicious attitude that had resulted

157
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,240
in systemic historical oppression and mass death, but the impulse was the same, and so

158
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,600
were the reactions.

159
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,760
So even though there's a disconnect between the intended interpretation and the actual

160
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,400
interpretation, there's also a disconnect between the severity of the crime and the

161
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:03,300
gleeful savagery of the punishment, and this is not relegated to the early 2010s, it happens

162
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,860
now more than ever.

163
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,360
Twitter always has a villain of the day.

164
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,600
Before me, it was shrimp bean dad, I don't know, something something milkshake duck.

165
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,920
God, am I a milkshake duck?

166
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,560
I feel like I'm too old to be a milkshake duck.

167
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,680
I've been around too long to be a milkshake duck, right?

168
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,720
To a certain extent, the villain of the day almost follows a script, especially now that

169
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,080
we've all been losing our minds because we've all been inside for a year doing nothing but

170
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,780
looking at our phones.

171
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:35,400
Person says dumb thing, it gets some attention, person gets defensive, the defensiveness spurns

172
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:42,900
outrage, people start coming out with receipts, the OP deletes their account...

173
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:48,540
And Twitter is garbage because the user experience, UX as they call it in the industry, is designed

174
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:54,380
to encourage this kind of behavior, it's engagement, fast and emotional and satisfying, and easily

175
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,380
forgotten.

176
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,500
Communication through Twitter often happens through shorthand, micro-interactions that

177
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:05,560
fit a limited number of predetermined narratives and scripts because you're exposed to thousands

178
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,780
of these per day, which is why we have these Twitter script phrases such as, wow, this

179
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:16,780
blew up, friendly reminder, casual reminder, mask off, I don't know who needs to hear

180
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:21,800
this, but thank you for coming to my TED talk, should have stayed in the drafts, read the

181
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,900
room, I'm trying to see something, I'll just leave this here, asking for a friend,

182
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,020
send tweet, the list goes on.

183
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:33,220
And the way it provokes rage in dogpiles is baked into the way the very platform itself

184
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,220
is designed.

185
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:40,280
Twitter as a company has a really big problem where outside of its user base, its reputation

186
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:45,960
is quite bad, and it hasn't really seen an increase in active users in years.

187
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,280
When a site hits its peak in terms of total active accounts, there is still capitalist

188
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:55,980
pressure to increase value and profit, a shrinking pool of eyes plus a need to increase revenue

189
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,480
equals a service that needs to squeeze more blood from the same stones.

190
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,000
So every UX decision is geared towards increasing time spent with eyes on the screen.

191
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,540
That's why they've developed non-chronological timelines, tweets that get added to your feed

192
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:15,300
by virtue of other people liking them, goddamn fucking quote tweets, and so on.

193
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,220
Twitter is designed quite literally to be addictive, they aren't getting new users,

194
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,840
so they have to keep the ones who are there from logging off.

195
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,340
Twitter wants you to post, and it wants you to boost, and it wants you to engage, so it

196
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:31,160
will put as few barriers between the user and engagement action as possible.

197
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,540
So with all that in mind, it's no wonder that among the many pre-written shorthand

198
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:39,140
Twitter scripts, Twitter's villain of the day is even a thing, and that it's a common

199
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:44,900
truism on Twitter that the only goal is not to become the villain of the day.

200
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,420
The unspoken understanding that it can be anyone if they're not careful.

201
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,900
It'll happen to you.

202
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:58,300
No way man, we're gonna keep on rockin' forever, forever, forever, forever, forever.

203
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,940
Engagement is often driven by outrage, and so we have this combination of high emotionality

204
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,740
with a desire to perform.

205
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,260
Social media is designed to manipulate our desire for approval, and a part of that these

206
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,460
days is the desire to perform allyship.

207
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,680
White people in particular all want to be told they're one of the good ones.

208
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,580
Which is why people like Justine Sacco gained such attention in the first place.

209
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:26,500
In a fundamentally unjust world, it's satisfying to take a cosseted bigot down a peg.

210
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:32,060
So if we can only get one more wrong-headed bigoted head on a pike, humiliate one more

211
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:38,580
blackface steward, or one more appropriative food blogger, we could heal this world.

212
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:43,660
And inevitably, it was my turn, because I cannot shut the fuck up on Twitter.

213
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:49,740
On Friday, March 26th, 2021, I was Twitter's villain of the day.

214
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,300
So for those of you who haven't yet seen my offending tweet, let's have it, my Justine

215
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,300
Sacco moment.

216
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,020
Are you ready to see why mommies cancel?

217
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,620
Also watched Raya and the Last Dragon, and I think we need to come up with a name for

218
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,420
this genre that is basically Avatar The Last Airbender reduxes.

219
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,100
It's like half of all YA fantasy published in the last few years anyway.

220
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,300
That's it.

221
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:16,340
That's the tweet.

222
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,540
So I imagine some of you are very confused.

223
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,040
Part two, valid criticism.

224
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,420
So from what I can tell, the whole thing originated when some Southeast Asian artists and animators

225
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:32,060
read the tweet as being dismissive and reductive and implying all Asian inspired things are

226
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,140
the same genre.

227
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,500
And to me, it was made even more frustrating by the fact that several of the people who

228
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,900
started this hadn't even seen the movie.

229
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,160
In fact, most people who were getting involved with this conversation hadn't even seen the

230
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,160
dragon movie.

231
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,780
It looks like no one saw the dragon movie, but here's the thing.

232
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:53,480
I kind of had my own has Justine landed yet experience by popping off the tweet, reading

233
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:59,320
a few responses who understood where I was getting at going to bed and it blew up while

234
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,080
I was asleep.

235
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,160
Hashtag has Lindsay woken up yet?

236
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:08,120
And because by the time I woke up, I'd already gotten a few like, Oh my God, are you okay?

237
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,720
messages from friends before I even opened Twitter.

238
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,660
By the time I looked at my timeline, I saw very little that I would consider valid criticism.

239
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:22,020
So I feel like I need to establish that this whole thing stopped being about valid criticism

240
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,140
very, very quickly.

241
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,700
And I'll talk about that later in the video.

242
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,700
But by the time I woke up, it had already blown way past this is a careless display

243
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:37,660
of white privilege to this sort of thing as a contributing factor to the mass murder of

244
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:43,980
Asian women that just happened.

245
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,140
So this is what we call an overstatement of harm.

246
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:55,200
It had gone from possible insensitive microaggression from a C-list YouTuber to contributing to

247
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,620
hate crimes.

248
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,000
And that didn't feel like anything I would consider valid.

249
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,900
So it's, you know, early in the morning, I just woke up and I responded with frustration

250
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:10,260
because I was being ascribed an intentionality, which was not there, which, well, if anyone

251
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,260
who spent any time on Twitter can tell you, getting defensive and doubling down is about

252
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,160
the last thing anyone should do.

253
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,600
So that was an oopsie.

254
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:24,160
And I tried to give, you know, some credence to the valid criticism by saying, like, you

255
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,960
know, if you squint, I can kind of see what you're saying.

256
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:33,040
And God damn it.

257
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,280
It was like, it was early.

258
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,920
I went like it was like, you shouldn't tweet in the morning.

259
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,320
You shouldn't tweet at all.

260
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,320
You shouldn't tweet.

261
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,320
Nobody should tweet.

262
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,080
So that very poorly worded frustration was met with even more outrage that I was not

263
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:52,560
taking in to be valid critique of POC when I am too busy being bowled down by mountains

264
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,800
of hyperbole and this word racist over and over and over, which is bound to make anyone

265
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,320
a little bit defensive.

266
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,440
So when all of these things are coming at you, it's impossible to genuinely consider

267
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,520
actually valid critique in a timely fashion because your defenses are at a hundred.

268
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,920
And when I'm being accused by hundreds of people of contributing to anti Asian American

269
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:18,980
hate crimes by saying that the Disney thing reminded me of the Nickelodeon thing, it's

270
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:24,040
honestly kind of stunning to me that any reasonable person would expect someone in my position

271
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:30,040
to take in all of these hundreds of tweets, process them reasonably, and within minutes

272
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:36,340
be like, hmm, yes, I see your point, reasonable ones, because I am able to parse you out from

273
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,760
the people saying I'm responsible for hate crimes.

274
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,340
Now before we go forward, it must be acknowledged that being any person of color in the United

275
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:51,720
States right now is just to be constantly worn down in a million tiny ways every day

276
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,240
all the time by a society that is low key shitty.

277
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,600
High key shitty.

278
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
It's shitty.

279
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,940
These critiques don't come from nothing and there are issues both in the film industry

280
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,800
and the culture at large that is making people hyper vigilant.

281
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,760
I'm not going to follow that with a however.

282
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:14,320
I just want to lay that groundwork and acknowledge that.

283
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,680
Part three, white nonsense.

284
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,080
I know that's not the most PC way of saying that, but I have many, many white friends,

285
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,120
so I'm allowed to say that.

286
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,840
So in the case of this tweet, I went to bed morning on the East Coast and you know, there

287
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:35,040
was some discourse by people who, you know, had some valid upset and the nations all live

288
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,160
together in harmony until the whites attacked.

289
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:44,920
Because a common refrain of these valid criticisms were that I was ignoring POC voices and talking

290
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:51,400
over POC voices, but the vast, vast majority of the avalanche of angry I was getting was

291
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,920
from white people.

292
00:18:52,920 --> 00:19:02,400
Not all, but definitely, at least in terms of the extremely hyperbolic ones, the majority.

293
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,800
White people, come here, come here.

294
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
We need to have a chat.

295
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,440
I think maybe we need to admit that those of us on the progressive side of the fence,

296
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,160
as it were, are feeling kind of under pressure these days.

297
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,400
We are horrified by the racial injustice of the world, especially in the US.

298
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,360
We feel the need to perform action, but aren't really presented with very many opportunities

299
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,600
to do so.

300
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,080
My friend and PBS co-host Princess Weeks remarked during another stupider Twitter thing that

301
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:37,520
happened a few weeks prior about fanfiction ethics.

302
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,840
Actually it's about ethics and fanfiction.

303
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,280
It deeply amuses me when people treat shipping, pro and anti, with so much political importance

304
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,300
when they literally apply that to nothing else, and to remove all nuance and context,

305
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,840
to share fake quotes and facts, to perpetuate harm in order to own people, over the right

306
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,400
for two white people to kiss.

307
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,360
When you marginalize really queer BIPOC and marginalized people, for what?

308
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,640
In other words, often white progressives cite black voices when in service of your...

309
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,660
well, in this case, ship.

310
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,660
It was Hannibal.

311
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,720
Oh my god, this is so stupid.

312
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,000
You're interested in black voices when it's in the service of pwning another white person

313
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,200
or white creator, whomst you disagree with, but show little interest for issues or advocacy

314
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,000
that actually concern black voices in their community, independent of said pwnage, only

315
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,880
to immediately be told, you're not a real queer little girl, you privileged little twat

316
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,120
by a white lady about 15 minutes later.

317
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,960
To be clear, this discussion was about fanfiction.

318
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,400
This was about pretend people kissing, pretendly.

319
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,440
So I saw a lot of mealy-mouthed smug nothing about do better and listen to POC.

320
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
Always listen to POC.

321
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,680
Why aren't you listening to POC?

322
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,560
Elevate POC voices, always.

323
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,560
Okay.

324
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,560
Whomst.

325
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,760
Whomst is the valid person of color, oh allies of the jury, because I did listen to a lot

326
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:18,000
of POC, both in public and in private, and I gotta tell ya, there's a diversity of opinions,

327
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,560
almost like people of color aren't a monolith.

328
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:25,360
Marginalized communities are not without diversity or conflict, so treating it as such is totally

329
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,320
reductive and ignoring other POC voices by centering the loudest or angriest as the most

330
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,320
authoritative.

331
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:39,080
A problem only compounded by the way Twitter is designed, which I have already argued,

332
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,080
is bad.

333
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,080
As I was going back and forth over the timeline and everything that had happened, I found

334
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:52,560
this private message from fellow YouTuber who I have to disclose is half Vietnamese

335
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,840
because this is irrelevant, and he said I'm trying not to say anything I'm going to regret

336
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,440
here, but I have very little respect for the people dogpiling me and mine in the defense

337
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,120
of a typically derivative corporate product from the biggest media company in the West

338
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,200
because two of its seven writers and zero of its directors were Asian.

339
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,720
This in private, of course, because, you know, you didn't want to get harassed.

340
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,920
Privileged twat.

341
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:22,120
So I find the listen to POC refrain, because it's only trotted out in the service of white

342
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:28,240
people pwning other white people very revealing because what they mean is listen to the POC

343
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,800
we can use to pwn someone else.

344
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,720
But the POC we don't agree with?

345
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,720
Privileged twat.

346
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:39,560
But note this hilarious exchange between two white people arguing over my riot tweet.

347
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:44,960
When pressed on what exactly it is I need to admit wrongdoing for, this woman says,

348
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,400
again, you're just another white woman talking over actual POC concerns.

349
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,800
I love this exchange because this person, one of the shit billion white people mindlessly

350
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:01,480
regurgitating this listen to POC shorthand, the very same person who called Princess a

351
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,740
privileged twat.

352
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:08,880
You're not a real queer little girl.

353
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,200
Princess's law in action.

354
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,340
There's this incredibly childish dichotomy with the way a lot of people discuss racism,

355
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:21,020
that there are the racists and the non-racists, the two genders.

356
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:27,340
And the way to solve racism is to root out the racists and cast them onto racist island,

357
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:32,400
away from me and mine, the non-racists, one of the good ones.

358
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,120
They do this because they are insecure about their own internalized racism.

359
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,540
They cannot conceive that they have any.

360
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:42,320
That thought is terrifying to them because a racist is the worst thing you can be.

361
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,000
So instead of doing any introspection, they remain hypervigilant to root out the secret

362
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:54,780
bad people so everyone else will know they're one of the good ones.

363
00:23:54,780 --> 00:24:00,680
Racism is a complex system upheld from all wings of our society, from laws to hiring

364
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:06,560
practices to generational wealth to community redlining to internal biases to individual

365
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,260
actions.

366
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,620
We live in a white supremacist society.

367
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:14,060
When you live in a pigpen, you're gonna get covered in shit.

368
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,060
And all of us have the stink on us.

369
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,940
And I don't just mean the whites.

370
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,940
All of you.

371
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,940
Blocked.

372
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,940
Blocked.

373
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,940
Blocked.

374
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,620
None of you are free from sin.

375
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,700
But especially the whites.

376
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:31,420
And yet people still have this like, Elby the racist dragon attitude about how racism

377
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,420
works.

378
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,420
Why are you crying so?

379
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:39,420
I'm crying because all of those horrible villagers chased me into this scary cave.

380
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:43,500
I think it's because I'm so racist.

381
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,300
Get your hand off my tail, you'll make it dirty.

382
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:51,740
Racism isn't a system perpetuated by many, many things, including actions, but a character

383
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,140
trait, a disease that people try to hide from the world because they know if they're found

384
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,580
out, they'll get banished to racist island.

385
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,900
And suddenly, he wasn't racist anymore.

386
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,240
While there are still, of course, racist hate crimes and the like, most general displays

387
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,960
of racism don't come out of grand, like cross burning style gestures, but out of ignorance,

388
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,840
carelessness or negligence.

389
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,160
And for white people, a lot of it is just the reality of benefiting from a system designed

390
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,340
to privilege you.

391
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:26,460
So I'm not going to waste my breath on the I'm not a racist line of defense.

392
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,320
I'm a white woman from Tennessee.

393
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,480
My family is mostly uneducated white trash.

394
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,560
I'm not going to be like, yeah, I didn't internalize any of that.

395
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,560
I'm special.

396
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,920
I shot out of the womb unscathed.

397
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,040
We all have the stink on us.

398
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,960
Yes, even you.

399
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,680
The reason I bring this up is because another thing that happened after that tweet was the

400
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,080
sharing of the receipts.

401
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,840
Thousands of people passing around screen caps of tweets and videos and blog entries

402
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,920
and anecdotes from my personal life, proving that this was not just a one off.

403
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,040
Oh, no, I have a long history.

404
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,040
It was high time.

405
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,320
I was banished to racist island.

406
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:13,120
And it's true, I do have a long history of being on the Internet longer than pretty much

407
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,760
all of you statistically, probably.

408
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:22,060
And there is a list of sins floating around Twitter carefully and obsessively curated

409
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,960
over a period of 13 years.

410
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
Amazing.

411
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,560
Is it because there's a pandemic?

412
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,900
Where do you guys get all this free time?

413
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:34,740
So I've been accused of a lot of terrible things and remanded for never owning up to

414
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,740
my mistakes.

415
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,660
Well, today is your day, receipt keepers.

416
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,960
You guys have worked so, so hard on this.

417
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,020
So I am going to give you what you asked for.

418
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:50,740
Finally, all that hard work meticulously coming through every word I've ever said is going

419
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,740
to pay off.

420
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:57,180
Well, that that's what you wanted, wasn't it?

421
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,980
Part four, my list of sins.

422
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:09,500
You weren't prepared for this to turn into a drama channel, were you?

423
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,500
Yeah, maybe you were.

424
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,020
I mean, this is just what happens when they break your spirit utterly.

425
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:19,560
So a big part of my, you know, self-preservation strategy over the years is to explain myself

426
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,060
as little as possible, because, you know, if you do that, it's already a losing game

427
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,020
and rarely, if ever, talk about my personal life.

428
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,460
Clearly, a big mistake on my part.

429
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,780
Well, today we are turning the page.

430
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,260
We are spilling the tea.

431
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,260
The whiskey.

432
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:38,060
I knew I was saving this for a special occasion.

433
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,060
Technically, whatever.

434
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,820
Got my, got my deception.

435
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,820
I haven't used this one in a while.

436
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,820
Oh, God.

437
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,820
Yeah, I really haven't used this in a while.

438
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:50,080
So take a shot every time Lindsay Ellis does a problematic.

439
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:56,980
So a common refrain during that weekend where I was trending was party A says Lindsay did

440
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,760
a racism and party B's like, well, what did she do?

441
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,400
Party A would show the tweet and party B would be like, I don't get it.

442
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,720
This doesn't seem like a big deal.

443
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,760
And then party A would be like, ah, no, she has a long history of problematic.

444
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,040
And party B is like, ah, I get it now.

445
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,800
And then they skip off together into the sunset.

446
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:23,440
Twitter user Dragon Lady Celeste Sparkle has conveniently collated my long storied history

447
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,880
of all my other sins that explain why the Raya thing was just a mask off moment.

448
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,820
And I deserve this, actually, a very good and normal thing to do with your finite minutes

449
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,820
on this earth.

450
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,760
Take down that YouTuber.

451
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,760
Take her down.

452
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,960
Literally, all day, people have been replying to my tweet with more and more examples of

453
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,980
truly harmful rhetoric that Ellie has been pushing for a while.

454
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:53,120
And all I can say is how the fuck has she not been called out on a mass scale before?

455
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,760
Well, Dragon Sparkle Celeste, she has.

456
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,600
She just never deleted her Twitter account before.

457
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,820
Actually, no, that's not true.

458
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:04,720
Last time I deleted my Twitter account, I didn't trend because I guess I wasn't, you

459
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:11,560
know, number 21,000 on the subscribed YouTube channel by that point.

460
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:16,680
But the last time I deleted my account, it was because of the, you know, white genocide

461
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,920
crowd.

462
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,680
So I guess that's something you have in common.

463
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,200
I don't get why I'm like so hated by both sides of the political fence.

464
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,480
I don't I don't think I'm like interesting enough to like gather this much attention

465
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,480
or emotion.

466
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,480
I drive a Honda Civic like Jesus.

467
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,800
So thank you for compiling it in one convenient thread.

468
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Makes my job easier.

469
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:44,000
Now, the problem with this not at all creepy and obsessive list of every single one of

470
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,500
my perceived transgressions over a period of 13 years is that it does not include the

471
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,360
times when I have addressed them.

472
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:56,200
But, you know, I'm sure they just, you know, forgot to screen cap those tweets slash blog

473
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,400
posts slash streams slash videos, et cetera, you know, because this list is in such good

474
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,480
faith.

475
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,360
Nor does it incorporate any of my entire body of work, which I don't know, doesn't count

476
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,020
apparently because, you know, the list of sins is the real me and the other stuff I

477
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,680
do is for profit or something.

478
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,480
So there's like a jillion of these grievances and, you know, this video is already like

479
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
12 eternities long.

480
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,760
So believe it or not, what I am about to address is non-comprehensive because there are a lot

481
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:32,400
of people who were really, really dedicated to, you know, mask off.

482
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,920
And credit to where it's due.

483
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,680
This was spearheaded by the, you know, leftist Twitter.

484
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,880
But again, a lot of these receipts originated with the right wing.

485
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,320
I don't even want to call them alt-right, you know, because they're not that principled,

486
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:51,160
you know, like more, more like, you know, gamergate refugees, the fortune for the lulz

487
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,120
crowd, diet Nazis, let's call them.

488
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:59,280
So some of this is, as many of you have noted, extremely bad faith interpretations of statements,

489
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,600
which only makes sense if you are working backwards from a foregone conclusion.

490
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,040
That said, I don't want this to be taken as me saying that I have never done anything

491
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,040
wrong.

492
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,940
Unambiguously, I have.

493
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,620
We all make mistakes.

494
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:17,820
So where I feel like an amendment or an apology is warranted, I will do so.

495
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:22,660
But where I feel like the criticism is being made in bad faith, is unreasonable, or is

496
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:26,120
flat out untrue, I shan't bend the knee.

497
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:31,740
Because we here at Lindsay Ellis Industries are not in the business of serving bullshit.

498
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:39,780
So I got my bell of shame here, and as the Black Eyed Peas would say, let's get it started.

499
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:48,020
2020 Harriet Tubman fanfic.

500
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:56,380
This one is, like, really popular.

501
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:02,580
So the narrative here is that because of this tweet, I ship Harriet Tubman with her enslaver,

502
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,220
and I want there to be fanfic of it.

503
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,840
I'm just saying, you have to be giving this a very weird read in order to think that's

504
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,840
what I meant.

505
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,240
But I'm also going to go out on a limb and assume that most of the people mad about this

506
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,180
have not seen the Harriet Tubman movie.

507
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:22,580
Or if they have, are not familiar with her real history.

508
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:26,980
So the central conflict of the film revolves around Harriet's relationship to her enslaver,

509
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:31,760
a twinkie blonde guy named Gideon, played by Taylor Swift's thin boyfriend.

510
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,420
They are around the same age, they basically grow up together, and early in the film he's

511
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:41,040
framed somewhat sympathetically until he propositions her, demands her submission and

512
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,800
fealty, which of course she refuses, and then when she escapes he becomes obsessed with

513
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:50,160
recapturing her, and he is the central antagonist of the entire film.

514
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,720
But here's the thing about Gideon, he never existed.

515
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,240
He was completely made up for the film.

516
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:02,200
Harriet Tubman's IRL enslaver at the time of her escape was a woman, but instead of

517
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,300
having the film center more around Harriet's journey after she got away from the Brodess

518
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:12,420
family, it instead creates this character in the form of Taylor Swift's boyfriend as

519
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:19,300
the antagonist, a man who, and I cannot express this enough, did not exist in real life.

520
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:26,340
So basically the film creates an OC that is like super obsessed with recapturing her in

521
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:31,780
a movie where Harriet Tubman also has superpowers.

522
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,640
It just felt a little fanfic-y to me.

523
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:38,460
And so one day I was on an airplane and the person next to me was watching it, and I just

524
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:43,560
kind of started wondering why the filmmakers decided to go that route with the film creatively,

525
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,020
because again it just kind of felt weird to me.

526
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:53,440
Like you know, the final showdown in the film is between Harriet and Gideon in a forest

527
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,480
that to me was somewhat evocative of the last showdown in The Force Awakens, and this was

528
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,700
also kind of like at the height of this sort of thing, this tendency to fanficify historical

529
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,680
figures that was partially enabled by Hamilton.

530
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:12,280
So I just kind of idly have this thought like, oh man, I wonder if this movie spurned fic

531
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,080
of these two characters, oh god, actually I'm not going to check because I don't want

532
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,080
to know.

533
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:22,020
Usually I don't really check my mentions, so I didn't see any anger when I tweeted that.

534
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:26,220
Only a few days later when screen caps started circling, and then I got some white women

535
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:31,780
in my DMs demanding that I do better and apologize, specifically not to them but to

536
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,260
all of my black fans that I hurt.

537
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:38,500
So like an hour after I tweeted it, I was like, hmm, I better take this down because

538
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:42,900
this is the sort of thing that someone could take out of context in bad faith.

539
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,300
Welp.

540
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:49,560
So the reason I never addressed this is because like the read of that tweet in itself of me

541
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:56,320
being thirsty for Harriet Gideon fanfic was just so absurd, I didn't know what to say.

542
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,720
Now to be clear, no, I should not have tweeted that at all.

543
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:05,120
I was thinking in terms of the creative decision to create Gideon being kind of tone deaf,

544
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:10,360
but the pithy way that I tweeted it still ostensibly glosses over the reality of white

545
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:15,760
owners sexually abusing their slaves being the historical norm, and that is in itself

546
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,540
disrespectful.

547
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:21,680
So while I definitely did not mean what people seem to think I meant, I definitely should

548
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,940
not have said that.

549
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:27,460
I was, as the kids say, showing my ass.

550
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:33,500
Next, 2009 autistic temper tantrum.

551
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:37,740
Boy, I had to go way back for this one.

552
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,100
People wonder why I privated all of my old videos.

553
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:47,300
So I was in film school at the time, and my class was 80% male, and you know, some of

554
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,620
them had a Friday sense of humor.

555
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:54,740
And while I was talking about this movie, Beauty and the Beast, The Enchanted Christmas,

556
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:59,580
one of them made this remark about how the beast and I just kind of mindlessly regurgitated

557
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,580
it.

558
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,580
Beast shape.

559
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:05,820
I'm going to throw an autistic temper tantrum because I was with an edgy boy website at

560
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,900
the time and I wanted to demonstrate that I wasn't like the other girls.

561
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,460
I was a cool edgy boy.

562
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,940
It was insensitive and careless.

563
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:16,020
I definitely should not have said that.

564
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:21,580
Next, 2013, The Prince of Egypt anti-Semitism.

565
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:26,020
God, I just, I can't, I can't believe somebody kept this for so long.

566
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,020
I'm just, I'm sorry.

567
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,820
This is just, this took so much dedication.

568
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:36,020
So the qualm here is that I did an anti-Semitism because I don't like the way the Prince of

569
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:41,540
Egypt, you know, functionally excuses the mass slaughter of innocent children in the

570
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:45,700
narrative, you know, because the book of Exodus frames it as a necessary evil.

571
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,980
And yeah, I just, I don't really care for the Prince of Egypt.

572
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:52,220
And I just don't think the book of Exodus works as a kid's movie.

573
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:56,220
Because it's a kid's movie, it has to frame the protagonists as understandable and relatable

574
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:01,220
to modern family audiences and frame what happens in the book of Exodus as, you know,

575
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,220
all fine and good in the framework of the movie.

576
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:08,900
Even when the good guys do some light, you know, mass slaughter.

577
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:12,740
That tenth plague, man, it's a doozy.

578
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:16,980
I remember when we got to Exodus in Sunday school and, you know, when it got to the part

579
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:21,420
of the wailing and lamentations of the Egyptian women, you know, when they woke up and there

580
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:26,780
were dead children, like even at the age of five, I was like, it was pretty fucked up.

581
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:32,300
So my thought process here is that we take for granted the morality of narratives of

582
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:37,900
biblical texts because we grew up with them and they just kind of have so much informed

583
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:42,620
our cultural framework, when if a story like this existed independent of the Bible, it

584
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,380
would probably be considered pretty messed up.

585
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:48,600
Especially considering how the movie frames it as all Pharaoh's fault because he's such

586
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,580
a stubborn jerk.

587
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,580
Rameses, you bring this upon yourself.

588
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,680
Like at least in the Bible, God keeps hardening his heart.

589
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:04,940
And the other thing is like in the way that the film progresses, it's really funny to

590
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:09,940
me when you're like mass slaughter of children happens, Pharaoh Ralph Fiennes is weeping over

591
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:16,940
the corpse of his only son and then Val Kilmoses morosely peaces out and then bam, miracles.

592
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:28,380
I mean, I guess in a matter of speaking, the 10th plague is a miracle.

593
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,140
And this is not to say you can't make a modern movie about the Bible.

594
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,060
I actually really liked Noah.

595
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:37,740
It's easily my favorite Darren Aronofsky movie because it leans in hard on how fucked up

596
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:42,460
and traumatic it would be to have to sit back and, you know, watch and listen while every

597
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:46,340
other human on earth dies, you know, because God said so.

598
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,340
They are just people.

599
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,340
There is room.

600
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,340
There is no room for them.

601
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:00,380
But this is also an example of me using Twitter to feel out other people's opinions before

602
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,540
I do video content, a thing I will never do again.

603
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,180
A lot of people were like, yeah, but you know, this movie means a lot to me.

604
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,620
And, you know, a lot of that is because of like my religion or my culture.

605
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:13,620
And that was when I decided I was not ever going to touch this movie as a topic for a video.

606
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:17,500
And in the context of this thread, I shouldn't have used the word genocide, considering it's

607
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,380
a film about Jewish characters.

608
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,380
And for that, I do apologize.

609
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:25,140
Like, I don't think I'd be making the world a better place by talking about why I don't

610
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:29,900
think the Prince of Egypt works because I don't feel that strongly about it.

611
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,700
It's not a big deal.

612
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:35,820
I'm not really here for thing you like is bad actually content for its own sake, although

613
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,700
I love how every tweet in this thread has trigger warnings.

614
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,700
Trigger warning.

615
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,700
She didn't like the Prince of Egypt.

616
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,700
Next.

617
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,700
2013.

618
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,700
Charlie's Angels niqab.

619
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:51,380
This is another one I've addressed a few times, most recently on a live stream a few years

620
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:55,940
ago where we rewatched it and had a high old time laughing about what a comical example

621
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:59,580
of early 2010s white feminism this was.

622
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,580
You know what, guys?

623
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,580
I'm sorry.

624
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,580
I'm calling it.

625
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,580
Feminism is over.

626
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,580
I'm sorry.

627
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,580
I'm sorry.

628
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,580
I tried.

629
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,580
We did our best.

630
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,580
But it's our feminism, too.

631
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,580
We should get in it for everyone.

632
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:14,580
I'm not sick of the go make me a sandwich jokes.

633
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,900
Why do we even have that lever?

634
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,420
Yeah, so not gonna lie, this one's pretty bad.

635
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:24,180
This whole thing came about when I was on Twitter one day talking about doing a video

636
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,700
on Charlie's Angels and trying to think of like how visually to dress myself that was

637
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,140
like the opposite of Charlie's Angels.

638
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:34,020
And someone on Twitter was like, hey, you should do it in a burqa with like pigtails

639
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,020
poking out.

640
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,740
And I thought that idea was funny.

641
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,740
It's too confusing.

642
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,740
We don't know what we want.

643
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:42,700
It is apparently way too much to ask that women like either have a certain body type

644
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,000
or dress a certain way without being judged for it.

645
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,460
So two options, burqa or slut.

646
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,460
That's not burqa.

647
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,460
And that's a false dichotomy.

648
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:56,760
And even at the time, several of my Muslim followers were like, please do not do this.

649
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,460
This is a bad idea.

650
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,060
And OK, so this is not excusing it.

651
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,060
But here is some context.

652
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:06,940
So at the time, my next door neighbor was an Egyptian expat named Hajar.

653
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:11,960
And she was slash is a full niqabi, meaning whenever she goes outside, she dresses in

654
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:16,660
like the full, you know, well, basically what I was wearing, minus the pigtails sticking out.

655
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:20,740
And basically Hajar was like the only next door neighbor I've ever been friends with.

656
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:25,060
And it's another one of those weird problems of considering culture as a monolith, like

657
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:29,020
one would assume, or at least I assumed that like she would have zero interest in talking

658
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:32,620
to me and we would have nothing in common, considering she's like super, super religious.

659
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,700
And yes, some women do it voluntarily, but that's something I'm not going to get into

660
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,700
it.

661
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:40,180
But basically, one day we started talking when I was watching the Hunchback of Notre

662
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,740
Dame too loud, really.

663
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:47,620
And she was like, she caught me on the landing, like, so Hunchback of Notre Dame, huh?

664
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,700
So anyway, I mentioned this thing to her and she was like, yeah, whatever.

665
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,740
That's hilarious, lol.

666
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:55,340
And so this is not excusing it, but I kind of took that as, well, my friend I know personally

667
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,580
said it's fine.

668
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:00,460
So I'm going to, you know, take that opinion over these strangers.

669
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:04,900
But again, even at the time I had people on Twitter saying, do not do this thing.

670
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,140
And I ignored them.

671
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:11,460
And either way, I wasn't making content for Egyptian expats, which I'm pretty sure she's

672
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,160
never even seen one of my videos.

673
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,620
And either way, it was also completely unnecessary to the point of the video.

674
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:20,940
Like I could have made the exact same point with like a potato sack with pigtails sticking

675
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,200
out and it probably would have been funnier.

676
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,160
This one was bad and wrong for a lot of reasons.

677
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,840
And I do regret that.

678
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,340
Next.

679
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:38,680
So the Dear Stephanie Meyer video was about me reflecting on how carelessly I had participated

680
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:43,360
in the casual misogyny surrounding the early Twilight backlash around the time that the

681
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,580
first movie came out, you know, late 2000s.

682
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:51,560
And so the general objection here is that the video is racist because I neither mentioned

683
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:55,960
nor condemned Stephanie Meyer's depiction of the Quileute people.

684
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:01,240
So I'm not going to lie and say I didn't consider addressing it.

685
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,960
And I did have some conversations on Twitter with indigenous people that were actually

686
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,960
productive.

687
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,640
See, Twitter's not always bad, just, you know, mostly.

688
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,760
But there were two main reasons I decided not to discuss it in that video.

689
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,000
You know, besides the fact that that was back when I was trying to keep videos around like

690
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,320
the 20 minute mark.

691
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:21,440
One was the fact that during the backlash of the late 2010s, Twilight's appropriation

692
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,360
of the Quileute was not a common criticism and certainly was not weaponized against Stephanie

693
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,480
Meyer.

694
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,920
It is now, but that just was not a substantial proportion of the backlash at that time.

695
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,800
The second one is once again, we come to this question of the voices of a group being considered

696
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,880
a monolith.

697
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:43,280
I definitely talked to some indigenous people that condemned it, but I also saw some that

698
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,680
were like, yeah, I mean, like, I mean, no, it's not the best, but I liked it.

699
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,680
It was something new.

700
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,800
It was like a representation we hadn't seen before.

701
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,920
It was refreshing to have Jacob as this character who isn't like a noble savage stereotype and

702
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,520
isn't like magically in tune with nature and doesn't have like a sad, broken family.

703
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:02,520
He's just like a nice, normal kid who lives on the rez and vibes, you know, at least in

704
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,520
the first book.

705
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,080
Again, this video was addressing a point in time before Breaking Dawn came out.

706
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:10,200
So I just wasn't really comfortable making a value judgment on which of those was the

707
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,520
correct opinion, especially because it didn't really feel relevant to the central thesis.

708
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:18,600
And it's also a complicated issue that just didn't feel at home in that video.

709
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,920
Like, for instance, on the one hand, the way the Quileute are depicted in Twilight puts

710
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,560
the onus on the real Quileute to educate people that they're not werewolves.

711
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:32,040
And then the elders, they, you know, said, hey, Miss Ann, you got to get out there and

712
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,120
educate people that were really not werewolves.

713
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:40,640
But on the other hand, the attention Twilight has brought to the tribe has helped them tremendously,

714
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:46,320
not just through tourism, but actually helped them get land back from the feds.

715
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,920
It's opened the way for our tribe economically.

716
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,320
And then the media, it helped us a lot.

717
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:57,960
You know, our ancestors and our past council members have been fighting for over 50 years

718
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:04,160
for our northern boundary dispute to actually have that day and have the President Obama

719
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,880
signed a document saying that, you know, this land is yours.

720
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,420
It was like, wow.

721
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:15,800
But on the other other hand, Stephenie Meyer is a multimillionaire many times over.

722
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,980
It is kind of weird that she has given none of that wealth, as far as I know, back to

723
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:24,760
a people whose culture she appropriated, you know, for supernatural love triangles.

724
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:28,280
And while we're on this topic, Amanda the Jedi has been doing a Twilight retrospective

725
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,400
and she brought to my attention a fundraiser that the Quileute have been running for a

726
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,280
few years to help move some of their village to higher ground to, you know, protect them

727
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,240
from all the tsunamis and, you know, the climate change and whatnot.

728
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,920
So that is linked below.

729
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:45,040
If I did the video again, especially now that my videos are like eight hours long, I'd probably

730
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:49,520
add a little bit mentioning that this conversation became prominent later.

731
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:54,160
But this criticism does kind of always give me weird vibes because it usually comes with

732
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,400
this subtext of, and this is why Stephenie Meyer did and still does deserve the harassment

733
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,400
she got.

734
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,600
One, that is not why people were hassling her in 2008, so I could not fold that into

735
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,380
the valid common criticism folder.

736
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:07,880
And two, no one deserves that.

737
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:08,880
Next.

738
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:15,440
2018, transphobia via Tarzan.

739
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,000
I genuinely honestly really do regret this one, and I have said so a few times.

740
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,200
Why do they never screencap their attractions?

741
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,200
Weird.

742
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,400
When it was announced that LeFou would become the first out gay character in a Disney movie,

743
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,480
the Ls, the Gs, the Bs, the Ts, and of course all you filthy, filthy Qs.

744
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:35,080
I think it was like 15 minutes after this video went live that I was like, oh God, why

745
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,080
did I do that?

746
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,960
Well, that's because I was thinking about the optics so much as it wasn't a good joke.

747
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,640
Like I should have used Mulan, goddamn my eyes.

748
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,920
I thought this idea of afab turk being angry about wearing a dress was funny, but in hindsight

749
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,120
I really should have considered that it wasn't just any Disney character.

750
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:56,640
It was a gorilla, an animal that trans women are sometimes compared to, and it was extremely

751
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,640
careless.

752
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,760
And it's a shame because I otherwise really do like that video.

753
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,760
Next.

754
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,760
Next.

755
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,760
2020.

756
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,760
Trans men don't experience oppression, actually.

757
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,440
I didn't say that.

758
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:17,560
I said that anecdotally I had heard from a few trans men over my 80 odd years of existence

759
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:21,400
that they felt that they didn't experience the same level of scrutiny or harassment that

760
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,200
they had before they transitioned because of misogyny.

761
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,800
That said, this was also before Elliot Page came out, and I've seen so many people be

762
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:32,600
beastly to him, so, you know, that is a strong counterexample.

763
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,080
And I could say that I can't speak for all trans men's experiences, but I didn't claim

764
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,800
to, and I'm not sure how you could read that into my statement.

765
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,880
I was just repeating anecdotes I had heard.

766
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,200
So some of the hate mail I've been getting is calling me a TERF because of this, which

767
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:51,040
I think is really funny, because it's like, called a TERF for saying trans men are men.

768
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,040
Alright.

769
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,040
Next.

770
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,040
2017.

771
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,440
Next.

772
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,440
2017.

773
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,760
Zack Snyder hates his mother.

774
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:02,920
Once again, tweet clipped out of context, and another one the gamergate refugees were

775
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,120
really obsessed with.

776
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,120
Not that you guys have anything in common, but...

777
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:10,200
So these tweets are all long deleted, but this was a conversation between me and another

778
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:15,320
film critic, I forget who, talking about how difficult it is to meaningfully discuss Zack

779
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:21,040
Snyder's films, especially at the time, because his fans are... a little touchy.

780
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,800
And one Snyder fan said, you know, I don't mind when critics talk about his movies, I

781
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,480
just don't like it when they say stuff like Zack Snyder hates his mother.

782
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,920
And this was just absurd to me because I have never ever heard a real critic say that, so

783
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,520
I responded with what I considered obvious sarcasm, well I actually have it on good authority

784
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:43,040
that Zack Snyder hates his mother.

785
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:47,140
So this was really bad timing because I made this joke literally the night before the news

786
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:52,180
broke that Autumn Snyder had killed herself, the very night before, and so I wake up to

787
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:58,220
just this flood of outrage in my mentions and like, I am so deeply confused before I

788
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:04,240
even realize what's going on, and it was just like, oh my god.

789
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,880
So I don't like Zack Snyder's movies for a lot of reasons, but he does seem like the

790
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:12,660
rare decent powerful man in Hollywood, and I can't imagine how awful it was to go through

791
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:16,780
what he did, especially during such a huge production, and I'm impressed and appreciate

792
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:22,220
that the Snyders have been doing such broad advocacy for suicide prevention now, but like

793
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:31,220
harassing me in the name of like suicide prevention advocacy is like, come on.

794
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:35,020
Now this is by no means Zack Snyder's fault, and I do not mean to imply that it is.

795
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:39,500
Again, from all I've heard through my Hollywood grapevine, he seems like a decent person,

796
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:42,940
and he can't control what his fans do, and even though I wish he had done it sooner,

797
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:45,860
he has finally disavowed the really bad ones.

798
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:50,140
And I also can kind of appreciate that he probably didn't really have the emotional

799
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:55,140
bandwidth to pay attention to that sort of thing for a long time, let alone, you know,

800
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,140
address it.

801
00:49:56,140 --> 00:50:00,420
But I'm also sure that the many, many Snyder fans who have told me to kill myself in the

802
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:06,500
last four years because of this tweet just didn't know about my own history.

803
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:10,340
Either way, I'm sure it's an issue they all care deeply, deeply about.

804
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,020
All over a few Martha jokes.

805
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:13,020
Jesus.

806
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,020
Next.

807
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:19,300
2020 did a misgender.

808
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:20,460
This was a misunderstanding.

809
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,980
John Mulaney did an SNL monologue that I didn't love.

810
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:24,260
I said something about it.

811
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,700
Curio responded to that.

812
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,060
I said, yeah, I know.

813
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,060
Thanks, John.

814
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:29,100
Addressing John.

815
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:30,820
We talked it out over Twitter.

816
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,100
I apologized.

817
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,020
Those tweets are still up.

818
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:35,700
Next.

819
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,540
2012 defending the yellow facing Cloud Atlas.

820
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:43,940
I'm surprised there are no screen caps for this, probably because the diet Nazis didn't

821
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,380
find that worthy of preservation.

822
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,380
But this is true.

823
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,380
There was a lot of criticism of Cloud Atlas at the time, and I said something to the effect

824
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:54,860
of I didn't think it mattered as much as like, you know, the conversations around blackface

825
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:57,340
because they had a different history.

826
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:59,180
And I don't I don't know why I said that.

827
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,340
I don't know what the hell I was thinking.

828
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:04,020
Like, for one thing, I was definitely revealing my ignorance because, like, yellow face is

829
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,620
just, you know, a topic I had never really studied.

830
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:09,380
I'd done plenty on blackface, nothing on yellow face.

831
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:12,300
And falling on your sword for Cloud Atlas, of all things.

832
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,460
My podcast partner is going to be so disappointed.

833
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:15,460
I'm sorry.

834
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:16,460
Copy.

835
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:19,140
So, yeah, I still like Cloud Atlas, but the creative decision to use yellow face in the

836
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,220
way that they did is pretty inexcusable.

837
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:23,860
And honestly, it does kind of make me uncomfortable to watch now.

838
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:24,860
My bad.

839
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:25,860
Next.

840
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:34,700
2015 bisexual erasure.

841
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:39,180
So again, another post clipped out of context, and it is quite literally the only time I

842
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,780
have ever written about my sexuality.

843
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:44,660
And stuff like this is the reason why I was like, wow, never talk about that again.

844
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:48,220
It is from my now deleted blog, but I linked the archive page below.

845
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:53,700
And in effect, it was basically me kind of working out my feelings on feeling like bisexual

846
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,740
erasure was almost a form of privilege.

847
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:59,060
And I still kind of think that's true.

848
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:03,060
And the thing about sexuality is it's just like such a personal thing.

849
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:09,020
And that's why this like conflation of like the political and the personal, while necessary,

850
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:16,060
often makes me really uncomfortable because it was like such a painful process for me.

851
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:21,100
And one, I never really figured out how to reconcile, so I just never did.

852
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:26,580
So I've never really had a coming out or embracing my truths, more just like slow, quiet, begrudging

853
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:27,580
acceptance.

854
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:31,180
Like I just have these laundry lists of experiences, like for being in college and going to gay

855
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:36,020
clubs and having lesbians suddenly turn cold when they find out you're bisexual to the

856
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:42,020
popular axiom at the time of buy now gay later or highway to homo or gay until May

857
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:45,940
to Dan Savage way up into the 2010s saying that bisexual men don't exist or it's all

858
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:51,740
a phase or all the way to former respected person Glenn Greenwald saying that the bisexuals

859
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:56,960
are transing the lesbians out of existence as recently as last month.

860
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,960
So I can't help but feel a sort of imposter syndrome every time I do anything even tangentially

861
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,220
pride related.

862
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,660
I feel tolerated, but not accepted.

863
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:07,140
Why do I want to go to that parade?

864
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,420
Like, oh, you're here.

865
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,420
Fine.

866
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:10,900
I guess we're contractually obligated to let you in.

867
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:15,060
So I think for a lot of bisexuals, especially women, we do kind of live in this liminal

868
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:18,020
space of both privilege and erasure.

869
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:22,100
It is painful to feel ostracized from the community when accepting your identity has

870
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:27,300
caused you so much pain in the first place, but at the same time, you can opt out.

871
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,900
You can, in effect, pass a straight.

872
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:35,020
If I had a dollar for every time someone called me a straight white woman in the last few

873
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:39,060
weeks, that would take care of my Patreon for at least a month.

874
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:44,540
And to answer very good faith actors like Glenn Greenwald, what was his mother thinking?

875
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:48,820
So to answer very good faith actors like Blerp Blerp Blerp as to why proportionally bisexual

876
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:54,180
people tend to end up in heterosexual relationships 75-25 rather than the 50-50 it logically should

877
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,180
be.

878
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:56,180
Hmm.

879
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:57,740
I wonder why that could be.

880
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:00,700
You know, just besides the fact that as a proportion of humanity, there are more straight

881
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:01,700
people to choose from.

882
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,620
Well, here I am making a thing out of it.

883
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:05,820
Am I in the club now?

884
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:09,540
Next.

885
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:11,540
2014.

886
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:15,300
Did a bisexual gatekeeping against Mara Wilson.

887
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:21,180
Ah, so we have reached the speculations on my private life portion of the game show.

888
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:24,780
Is now a good time to bring up the fact that Lindsay Ellis was super shitty and biphobic

889
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:28,820
to Mara Wilson when she came out as bi, or are we giving people of color a moment to

890
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:31,500
drag her for filth before we bring up other shit?

891
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,500
Be honest.

892
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:34,380
Phew.

893
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:37,460
I guess we're doing this.

894
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:42,100
You may know Mara Wilson from her work as a child star in films like Matilda and Mrs.

895
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,100
Doubtfire.

896
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:47,140
In the last odd decade or so, she's worked as a nonfiction author, a voice actor, a Twitter

897
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:52,300
person who makes approximately 680 retweets per day, and also occasionally a writer of

898
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,380
op-eds for outlets like the New York Times.

899
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:58,380
In 2016, when she gave an interview about coming out as bisexual, it included this quote.

900
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,060
I remember being with bisexual friends.

901
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:02,000
I said, I think I might be bisexual.

902
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,080
And a friend of mine who's not a friend anymore said, no you're not.

903
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,080
She was a gaykeeper.

904
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,080
Okay.

905
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,080
That's good.

906
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,920
I'm going to use that.

907
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:15,160
So I'm not sure how this random Twitter user decided that she was talking about me as the

908
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:21,520
gaykeeper in this interview from 2016, but someone decided she must have been talking

909
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:26,000
about me based on no evidence whatsoever, and the accusation stuck, mostly because Mara

910
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,120
liked that tweet, and then about 50 other tweets of people having a high old time with

911
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,000
me as Twitter's villain of the day.

912
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,920
And I really don't know where this random user supposition came from, because I have

913
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:42,440
been very, very careful never to say anything about her publicly, either by reference or

914
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:48,000
implication, despite the many times she has talked about this awful former friend she

915
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:57,640
used to have, either in interviews, podcasts, subtweets, in print.

916
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:58,640
It was me.

917
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,640
It's me!

918
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,160
I was the turkey all along!

919
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,160
I was wondering what that turkey was doing there.

920
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:11,160
And to my knowledge, she's never indicated that I was the gaykeeper until the liking

921
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:14,640
of this tweet, thereby validating these suppositions.

922
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,640
Cool.

923
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,640
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

924
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:22,160
Okay, y'all, I'm about to blow some minds, but first I need to provide some context.

925
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,640
Mara and I were, at a point in history, friends and literal neighbors.

926
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:29,160
You know, we were both in our mid-twenties, we lived like two blocks from each other,

927
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:32,680
we were both recent NYU grads, and we were both aspiring writers.

928
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,680
And many people who've been following us for a long, long time have observed, hmm,

929
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:40,680
you two used to be really good friends, and then suddenly you were not.

930
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,680
And that is true.

931
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:47,680
But here's the thing, the anecdote about the gatekeeping bisexual former friend is

932
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,680
also true.

933
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:52,680
I do remember the conversation she is talking about, and while the wording she uses isn't

934
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:56,680
how I remember it, the basic gist of the conversation is true.

935
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,200
She told me she thought she might be bisexual, and I kind of casually dismissed it on the

936
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:05,200
grounds of her dating style, reminding me of a former roommate who prided herself on

937
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,200
being straight.

938
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:11,200
It was a fairly short conversation, it happened one time, like seven years ago?

939
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,200
Yeah, and we never spoke of it again.

940
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:18,200
So this conversation happened at least a year before we stopped speaking, which was over

941
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,200
five years ago.

942
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,200
And the reason why was a series of compounding factors.

943
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:25,200
This was not one of them, at least to my knowledge.

944
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:28,720
And the truth is, I don't know why I said what I said, or reacted the way I did.

945
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,720
If that had happened now, I would not have reacted that way, but even then, I don't

946
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,720
know why I was so dismissive offhand about something that I know from my own experience

947
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,720
can cause a lot of pain and isolation.

948
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:43,720
And it only came up the one time, was immediately dropped, and we never spoke of it again, and

949
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,720
for that reason, I never thought much of it.

950
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:48,720
I didn't consider that she wasn't just kind of saying something off the cuff, but

951
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,720
was actually admitting something that she had been considering for a while to someone

952
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:55,240
that she thought would understand, and that person dismissed her.

953
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:58,240
And I didn't even begin to know that this caused any hurt until almost two years after

954
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:02,240
that conversation even happened, because she didn't come out until a few months after

955
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,240
Between the two of us, and I cannot express this enough, had nothing to do with this.

956
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:12,240
Like, this is something I feel like I need to press on these so-and-so-is-a-secret-bigot

957
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,240
crusaders.

958
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:17,240
Does it occur to you that you can dislike someone without some irreconcilable, ideological

959
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,240
differences?

960
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,760
This is a personal falling out between two people that has nothing to do with the content

961
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,760
we produce.

962
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,760
I produce.

963
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:28,760
And I just want to dispel this narrative that, like, someone has to be like the secret bigot

964
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:33,760
or, you know, mask off, or there's always the wronged one and the abuser in one of these

965
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,760
falling outs, when it's just like, sometimes people just don't get along, kids.

966
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,760
I would love to know why Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice fell out, but it is, at the end

967
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,760
of the day, none of my business, and they have made it known, and they have kept the

968
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:49,280
under wraps for almost 40 years, and honestly, good for them.

969
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,280
Life goals.

970
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:54,780
And though do trust that this bridge is well and truly forever burned, I do sincerely regret

971
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:56,400
that I reacted the way I did.

972
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:01,280
I think I was probably projecting my own experience with rejection and paying it forward, and

973
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,620
I am sorry for that.

974
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:06,600
And no, I shan't be airing any more dirty laundry on this topic, fascinating though

975
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:07,600
it may be.

976
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:10,600
Next.

977
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,440
2009.

978
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,440
The Rape Rap.

979
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,440
Someone made a rape joke.

980
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,440
Oh my gooooooo-

981
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,440
Someone call the rape joke brigade.

982
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,440
Officer, I have an infraction I need to report to the Ministry of Rape Jokes.

983
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:27,440
Look, honestly, I'm shocked that Lindsay Ellis has not been cancelled forever by the rape

984
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,440
rap.

985
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,440
The zoomers that are cancelling her haven't even discovered the old rape rap she made

986
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:33,440
yet, while very thoughtful that she finally released a Mandarin and Japanese version of

987
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,440
the original rape rap.

988
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,440
Well, this has been a long time coming, hasn't it?

989
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:45,200
There is this semi-infamous video I did back in 2009, which is called Rape Rap, which is

990
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,120
exactly what it sounds like.

991
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:51,980
The joke is that my friend Brian, playing a rapping sexual predator, says horrible things

992
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:57,020
to me online because woman, and I try to get him not to say these things.

993
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:01,080
And honestly, I kind of want to give a slow clap to the diet Nazis because this is a fetch

994
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:04,360
they have been trying to make happen for years.

995
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,880
And I'm honestly kind of happy for them, you know?

996
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:13,440
Like, they have used this to hurt me and humiliate me, and they sent it to like PBS affiliate,

997
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:18,560
PBS corporate, trying to get me fired, and they've uploaded like 800 mirrors to YouTube,

998
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:22,800
they've sent it to my colleagues, they've spammed me with it for over a decade, and

999
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:26,400
it just never spread beyond the diet Nazi sphere.

1000
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:31,560
And it's finally, finally into the mainstream woke-school Twitter.

1001
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,880
You know, I'm happy for them.

1002
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,880
They worked so hard for this.

1003
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:41,340
So I know the people adding this to my list of sins are very, very concerned about rape

1004
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:44,400
victims, and that's why you're upset by this.

1005
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,200
So I know you would want to know the context for this.

1006
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:51,460
You aren't just thoughtlessly adding this to my ledger to help assuage people's moments

1007
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:55,820
of doubt that the harassment against me was, in fact, justified.

1008
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,320
You care about context.

1009
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:01,600
And here's your content warning, so if you don't want to hear this, skip to this time

1010
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:02,600
code.

1011
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,000
We're bringing out the tequila for this one.

1012
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:13,760
This isn't even fake tequila.

1013
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:19,760
So when I was a sophomore in college, my very first sexual experience with another human

1014
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,280
being was _____.

1015
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:26,320
Big reason why I was vulnerable to this person was _____.

1016
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:30,680
So he took me back to his studio apartment and _____.

1017
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:34,600
And when I woke up and realized what had happened, I started freaking out.

1018
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:40,440
And I remember there being this smell, and so basically he just pushed me out of his

1019
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:44,200
apartment and he gave me a $20 bill and just slammed the door in my face.

1020
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,040
And I mean, what are you going to do?

1021
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:52,240
So the $20 bill was enough money exactly for the cab ride home.

1022
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:57,760
And then I got a Nesquik, you know, the chocolate milk and a bagel.

1023
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:03,480
And then I go upstairs to my dorm room and I like just hork it all up.

1024
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:08,080
And then I like take off my clothes and I just like burn the evidence on our gas stove.

1025
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,200
Like I just like, you know, it was the clothes' fault.

1026
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:13,120
I just, my roommate was out of town at the time, so there was nobody.

1027
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:18,400
So I just like burn the clothes and burn the evidence and I didn't tell anyone that this

1028
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,400
happened.

1029
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,400
So nobody knew.

1030
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:26,480
So about one year later, I was at a Dresden Dolls concert, of all things.

1031
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:34,280
And I think this was, yeah, this was 2005 and I was there with my roommate and we lived

1032
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:37,520
in the West Village and the concert was at Webster Hall.

1033
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:42,480
And Webster Hall was about a 15, 20 minute walk from our apartment in the West Village.

1034
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:47,840
And we got separated on the way home, you know, because, you know, concert and partying.

1035
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:52,320
And normally that's like no big deal because like it's no big deal to get separated from

1036
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:55,520
your college roommate for, you know, 10 minutes.

1037
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:06,440
But when I get back to our apartment, I find her on the stairwell covered in because by

1038
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:07,440
our neighbors.

1039
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,860
So like literally across the hallway neighbor.

1040
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:13,100
So I just like see white.

1041
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:19,360
I just like fly into this animal rage and I don't think it was like it couldn't have

1042
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:22,300
been more than like five or 10 minutes before the police showed up.

1043
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:24,660
And I was like still in full hoke mode.

1044
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:32,480
And fortunately, the ambulance showed up before they could take us to jail, as they do.

1045
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:37,980
So we went to the hospital and she got a rape kit done.

1046
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:41,100
And so now I'm involved with that case.

1047
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:44,420
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

1048
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:50,620
All this while, like this whole time, I had not told anybody what had happened to me.

1049
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:55,900
I wouldn't actually tell anybody what happened to me for like another, I think it was like

1050
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:56,900
another year or two.

1051
01:03:56,900 --> 01:04:00,980
I think, yeah, it was probably like, yeah, it was like two years later.

1052
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:02,620
And of course I didn't do it in a healthy way.

1053
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:05,500
I think it was probably, yeah, it was something like this, you know, like, is this healthy?

1054
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:08,620
So here's the thing when like something like this happens, you know, and like, you know,

1055
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:12,420
there's police involved and police reports and hospitalizations, you know, besides the

1056
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:17,860
DA pressuring you out of pressing charges, which is what they did to my roommate.

1057
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:22,540
And, you know, I didn't realize that was because, you know, they want to deflate the crime stats

1058
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:27,020
in their districts until about 15 years later when Reply All did an episode on that.

1059
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:31,180
But the thing is, like, there's a lot of paperwork and like, no, this is relevant.

1060
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:36,640
So basically, like, she and I shared this like hanging file, like for all of our paperwork

1061
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:42,340
that we had for like various things that were just like, you know, financial aid, you know,

1062
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:46,460
essays, college stuff, rape.

1063
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:52,940
For the first like few days, it was just this like untouchable, horrible thing that

1064
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:58,140
like happened and had to be endured and was just like this pall over both of us.

1065
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:01,780
And you know, and this was before the DA pressured her out of pressing charges.

1066
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:07,380
And so we had this folder and so like, we just somehow like I asked her like, well,

1067
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:08,380
what's in that folder?

1068
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:11,460
And she's like, rape.

1069
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:16,140
And we kind of like embellished the folder, like with the musical.

1070
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:22,220
And it was just like, rape and like, you know, horror font, the musical.

1071
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:26,260
And I'm not going to lie and say this like began the process of healing, categorically,

1072
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:27,260
it didn't.

1073
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:31,340
But you know, it did make the reality of the situation like accessible, you know, joking

1074
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:32,820
about it brings it down to earth.

1075
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:36,220
It's no longer this like unspeakable horror.

1076
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:42,380
And like, you know, if Cora's life is based on mine in any way it is this, NYU's TAs were

1077
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:47,500
having a strike that semester, meaning that the undergrads were allowed to drop classes

1078
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:52,040
basically up until finals, without penalty or a failing grade.

1079
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:58,100
And what happened was that like, that was the only semester where that was an option.

1080
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:03,540
And if it weren't for that technicality, where I could drop classes up to finals, I would

1081
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:04,540
have failed out of school.

1082
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:07,940
I mean, the failing out part is taken from my experience, not the rape part.

1083
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:10,020
I didn't I didn't give Cora that tragic backstory.

1084
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:14,100
So being just like this one, two punch of horrible things, like I just like I was honestly

1085
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:15,100
terrible.

1086
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:19,380
Like, I like in so many ways, I went catatonic, I wasn't supportive.

1087
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:24,480
And I just don't remember like big chunks of 2005 and 2006.

1088
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,340
And that sucks because like, I really, you know, treasure a lot of my time and education

1089
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:29,500
at NYU.

1090
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:33,660
There are just like huge blocks of it that I don't remember.

1091
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:39,020
But I do remember this, not long after I graduated a couple years later, Rape the Musical came

1092
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:41,420
up in like a different context.

1093
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:46,260
And my friends, Brian and Pat, both to this day are, you know, still two of my dearest

1094
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:47,260
friends.

1095
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:49,940
Brian even officiated my wedding.

1096
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:54,060
So Brian had this jacket, which he joked made him look like a flasher.

1097
01:06:54,060 --> 01:07:01,020
And like, somehow or other, he was like, freestyling these wraps to me and Pat and I, at the time,

1098
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:03,300
found them just like hilarious and cathartic.

1099
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:04,300
And I was like, you know, keep going.

1100
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:07,420
And so we like started workshopping and we're like, oh, let's make a sketch out of this.

1101
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:12,620
And I just remember these like lame freestyles while Pat just sat there with this like dead

1102
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:18,820
serious expression, not paying attention and just me like dying laughing and like finding

1103
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:20,820
it honestly really helpful.

1104
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:23,180
And I don't think, like at the time, I don't even think they knew.

1105
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:26,080
I think they were just like humoring me.

1106
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:30,200
So this was a way of tying in all of this like horrible nonsense that happened to me

1107
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:34,860
and my roommate in college with some of the misogynist garbage I was getting as a baby

1108
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:37,880
woman on the Internet in 2009.

1109
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:42,060
So it was, as the kids say, a cope.

1110
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:47,540
Now with regard to this jokey joke little sketch that makes such light of rape, I know

1111
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:48,540
what you're thinking.

1112
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:50,380
This must be so hard for you.

1113
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:51,960
That's so sad for you.

1114
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,680
That must have been super fucking hard for you.

1115
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:58,820
But if this was indeed a copey cope jokey joke between friends, should it not have remained

1116
01:07:58,820 --> 01:07:59,820
private?

1117
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:02,780
Yes, you observing good faith person you it should have.

1118
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:06,300
But this was uploaded without my knowledge or permission.

1119
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:09,700
Without my consent, you might say.

1120
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:13,300
I even blogged about it because at the time I was, of course, getting calls for apologies

1121
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:15,660
and I was like, absolutely not.

1122
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:17,060
This happened without my permission.

1123
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:20,820
And there's an archived link to that blog entry in the description if you vultures want

1124
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:21,820
proof.

1125
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:25,780
So the way that this happened at all was at the time Channel Awesome controlled all of

1126
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:30,120
our individual channels and we didn't upload them ourselves.

1127
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:34,160
We uploaded them to an FTP and scheduled them and then someone else uploaded it for

1128
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:35,160
us.

1129
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:38,960
So when I finished this video, I did still think it was funny, but I also realized that

1130
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:40,840
this should never see the light of day.

1131
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,960
This can be just like a practice run for other sketchy things that we do and should stay

1132
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:48,720
a private joke between friends, all the while forgetting that my export folder automatically

1133
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,720
uploaded directly to this FTP.

1134
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:53,480
So months pass, I forgot it was even there.

1135
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:57,320
And then one day the guy who ran the schedule, I guess, got annoyed that I kept blowing my

1136
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:02,280
deadlines and he was like, fine, I'll just upload whatever's in that FTP folder.

1137
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:06,200
But like I started getting these phone calls asking why I scheduled that and I'm like,

1138
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:12,080
I didn't take it down, but it was too late.

1139
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:15,220
And now here we are.

1140
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:20,560
So the Diet Nazis love this video because, you know, they think I'm like this high minded

1141
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:27,340
liberal who is like so holier than thou and therefore that this exposes my hypocrisy.

1142
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:32,280
And so we can use this to just like torment me and humiliate me and just like constantly

1143
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:33,280
like upload it.

1144
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:36,840
And like I'll just see it like in my mentions and sometimes they'll send it to like my colleagues

1145
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:40,680
or my publisher just to like try to get them to get a reaction.

1146
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:45,640
And so now Wokeskull Twitter has discovered it and just mindlessly adds it to my ledger

1147
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,640
of sins.

1148
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:51,600
And so now here we are and I'm having to relive one of the worst times of my life just to

1149
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,760
get you people to back the fuck off.

1150
01:09:54,760 --> 01:10:18,880
So like all of you, just these these people who have been trying to get to me with it

1151
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:24,680
and think that like me staying silent is an admission of guilt rather than it being none

1152
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:29,640
of your fucking business, even considering that this was not supposed to be made public.

1153
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:33,560
And now these Wokeskulls are just adding it to like my ledger and trying to use it to

1154
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,000
discredit me.

1155
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,580
All of you are just loathsome, loathsome people.

1156
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:46,360
And I hope you all...

1157
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:55,080
And as I mentioned earlier, this list is non-comprehensive, but...

1158
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:58,920
And to everyone out there who is like, you know, well, yeah, but why are you making this

1159
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:01,180
all about you?

1160
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:04,240
I didn't make this about me.

1161
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:08,440
You did.

1162
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:11,240
Part five, the tweet.

1163
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:15,600
So if this tweet were a video essay that had been researched for months instead of a tweet

1164
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,840
popped off in a minute, which I never will make, I will never talk about either of these

1165
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:24,040
properties again, it would probably be structured something like this.

1166
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:26,840
Avatar the Last Airbender was a game changer in a lot of ways.

1167
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:29,040
Here are some of the things that influenced it.

1168
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:34,360
Shonen anime, Asian folklore, there's a new generation of American writers, many of them

1169
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:37,000
people of color who were influenced by it.

1170
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,240
Anime and young adult literature have changed a lot because of this direct and indirect

1171
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:42,240
influence.

1172
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:43,560
And honestly, I think that's cool.

1173
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:47,560
I think that shows and books are honestly much more interesting for it than that which

1174
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:50,680
came before.

1175
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:55,960
So with regard to the similarity between these two texts, two big things stuck out to me.

1176
01:11:55,960 --> 01:12:01,080
One is the element-based co-lead being woken up by Katara after hundreds of years of sleep

1177
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:05,880
as the last whatever, now, you know, come on, Aang, we have to go from nation to nation,

1178
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:10,360
and in each nation you will acquire a skill until we face down the ding dang dong fire

1179
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:13,540
nation what started this whole mess and heal the world.

1180
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:17,680
But the thing that stuck out most in my mind as a trend that I've been seeing a lot in

1181
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:23,760
animation and YA literature and it's not a bad thing, Jesus, it's what I'm going to call

1182
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,520
for lack of originality, the Zuko.

1183
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:30,400
The princeling of the rival nation who has a lot to prove to their family and who serves

1184
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:35,320
as the principal antagonist for a while while our heroes bop from nation to nation and he

1185
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:39,040
chases them around but eventually starts to have a change of heart and a redemption

1186
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,040
arc...

1187
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:48,080
Now, the reason I cited like half of YA fantasy, again I did not mean literally half, that

1188
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:55,280
was hyperbole, well basically it was because most of the YA fantasy that I had read, because

1189
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:58,960
those were, you know, the big names that, you know, I had to read to be hept to the

1190
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:04,600
jive that were released in the last few years have Avatar as influences, the most high profile

1191
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:08,080
of which being Children of Blood and Bone by Tomi Adeyemi.

1192
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:13,560
Now I did enjoy this book and like Raya it also made heavy use of the Zuko and for that

1193
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:18,540
reason it was the first thing that popped into my head as being similar to Raya.

1194
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:23,080
And yes, Avatar the Last Airbender makes heavy use of Asian and anime tropes but it was the

1195
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:27,040
piece of media that popularized a lot of these things in the US.

1196
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:31,740
You didn't really see like redemption arcs over several seasons before that and now you

1197
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,240
see it all the time.

1198
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:39,160
Steven Universe does it, the new She-Ra does it, Kipo kind of does it with the frog and

1199
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:40,160
the monkey.

1200
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:42,280
Okay, I never said the Zuko had to be sexy.

1201
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:44,960
And now we have Raya and the Last Dragon.

1202
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:50,040
Now if you did read into my tweet that I was dismissing this or saying it was a bad thing,

1203
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:54,560
I guess I could understand that read because it wasn't very gracefully worded and it doesn't

1204
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,560
say anything positive.

1205
01:13:55,560 --> 01:14:01,000
But it doesn't say anything negative either, it is an inherently neutral statement, it

1206
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,320
is an observation, it's not even a critique.

1207
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:06,560
And so I was like, this is not a dig, ya crazies.

1208
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:11,480
And then the line is like, oh, you're calling POC crazy, which is so disingenuous when the

1209
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:15,840
vast, vast majority of people losing their shit at me in my mentions were white people

1210
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:18,220
projecting their own insecurities at me.

1211
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:23,040
Like obviously, ya crazies was a joke, but as a writer and a media critic, it was just

1212
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:29,360
so frustrating for me to see people interpreting the comparison of these two things as a dig.

1213
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:32,400
Like I was insulting one by comparing it to the other.

1214
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:39,440
What is this like CinemaSins brain poisoning thing being similar to other thing not bad?

1215
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:43,320
One of the funnest things as a writer you get to do when discussing your book or your

1216
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:48,680
media is discussing the influences because ostensibly they are something the author loves

1217
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:50,540
and is excited to talk about.

1218
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:56,120
So I also saw like a bunch of these like weird low digs like, oh, Axiom's End is so original.

1219
01:14:56,120 --> 01:15:00,440
Oh, Axiom's End is derivative, like I know that.

1220
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:05,740
I have marketed the damn thing on it being inspired by alien invasion movies and TV shows

1221
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:07,680
of the 90s and 2000s.

1222
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:11,600
There is a reason why I made a bunch of content about those influences in the year leading

1223
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:12,600
up to its release.

1224
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:15,760
Do you want me to give you a list of them?

1225
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:19,960
Everything has influences and Avatar The Last Airbender is one of the most successful and

1226
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:22,320
beloved children's shows of all time.

1227
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:26,720
As the author Tomi Adeyemi said of Children of Blood and Bone, the book Raya reminded

1228
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:42,480
me a lot of, and even one of the screenwriters of Raya has said that although Avatar was

1229
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:47,360
not a direct inspiration, we don't shy away from the comparison because it's a beautiful

1230
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:51,240
series.

1231
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:55,520
No matter how many mental back bends I do, even if you're tired of this take or feel

1232
01:15:55,520 --> 01:16:00,200
like it's flattening everything inspired by the largest continent on earth, I cannot begin

1233
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:05,040
to understand this causing hurt or anguish unless you are reading into it something that

1234
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:11,200
I did not say, especially when I'm like the 800th person to make this very milquetoast

1235
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,420
observation.

1236
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:16,440
Screen Junkies had released an Honest Trailer several days earlier making the exact same

1237
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:19,640
comparison for the exact same reasons.

1238
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:34,840
And look at that dislike ratio.

1239
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:40,360
I don't think there is a single video on my entire channel with a dislike ratio that low.

1240
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:44,160
I wonder why they didn't get any backlash.

1241
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:48,000
I wonder why it could be.

1242
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,080
Part 6.

1243
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:53,240
She Deserved It If Twitter had streets, there would have been

1244
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:55,520
dancing in them when I deleted my account.

1245
01:16:55,520 --> 01:17:00,560
Like Justine Sacco getting fired, like everyone held accountable by an online mob before me,

1246
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:03,320
this was taken as a victory by many, many people.

1247
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:06,440
And so the problem with making a big thing out of this tweet, which at worst could be

1248
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:11,360
considered an unintentional microaggression, made the outraged reaction to it kind of hard

1249
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,680
to justify.

1250
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:17,400
Which is why we need to establish a history of my offenses to bolster their case.

1251
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,360
And this is where the list of sins comes in.

1252
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:22,120
I'm trending on Twitter for like two days.

1253
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:26,040
There's all this discourse, so of course people are going to have second thoughts.

1254
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:29,640
Like why are so many people talking about this?

1255
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:31,160
Maybe this has gotten out of hand.

1256
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:34,040
Maybe the backlash wasn't worth the original sin.

1257
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:38,580
And here comes Dragon Celeste and hundreds like her like, oh no, don't worry.

1258
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:40,240
This is accountability.

1259
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:44,680
Here is the long list of sins proving that this is just mask off.

1260
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:46,900
She has a long history.

1261
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:49,340
How has she not been called out before?

1262
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:53,000
I know someone who's met her and they say she's a bad person.

1263
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,280
So you don't need to feel bad about hounding her because she deserves it.

1264
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:02,160
And my God, just the joy people took in this, like seeing me taken down a peg.

1265
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:03,660
Good fucking riddance, bitch.

1266
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:04,660
Good riddance.

1267
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:05,660
Good fucking riddance.

1268
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:06,660
Terrible human being.

1269
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:07,860
Dislikes Asians too.

1270
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:09,860
Y'all getting Lindsay Ellis is beautiful.

1271
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:10,860
Don't know shit about her.

1272
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:13,300
I can just look at a white person and know they're awful.

1273
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:14,500
Can't stand that human being.

1274
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,060
Glad I won't have to see her tweets.

1275
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:18,100
Her takes were so awful and embarrassing.

1276
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:20,100
I wouldn't want to be anywhere near her.

1277
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:24,100
Fuck Lindsay Ellis and her awful racism and for being a prominent phantom fan when it

1278
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:25,100
should be me.

1279
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:31,640
But mostly the racism.

1280
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,180
I hate her and Jenny Nicholson.

1281
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:34,940
Serene smiley faces.

1282
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:36,300
Lindsay Ellis deleted.

1283
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:40,220
People like Lindsay Ellis are finally facing consequences for being atrocious human beings.

1284
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:42,380
Lindsay Ellis getting canceled is good, actually.

1285
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:44,300
I will die on this fucking hill.

1286
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:48,420
What have I done to you?

1287
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:51,140
Are you are you rent fans?

1288
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:56,520
So many times I've seen people show the damning evidence to others like, see, look at this.

1289
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:01,700
Only have the people they're showing it to be like, I don't understand where you're getting

1290
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:02,700
this.

1291
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:03,780
Is there some context I'm missing?

1292
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:08,760
Here is a woman of color doing that very thing to Kat Black, demanding that she answer for

1293
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:11,860
sometimes collaborating with such a racist.

1294
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:16,100
And Kat basically responded, why the fuck are you demanding that I answer for my white

1295
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:17,100
colleagues?

1296
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:18,700
Leave her the fuck alone.

1297
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:19,980
And this is just the switches.

1298
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:23,260
Oh, oh, the joy the diet Nazis took in this.

1299
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:25,460
God, they love it when the left eats their own.

1300
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:26,960
And why wouldn't they?

1301
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:30,100
It's hilarious when your political enemies tear each other apart.

1302
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:34,580
I mean, to reiterate, these people have been trying to take me down for years.

1303
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:35,580
Keep trying, boys.

1304
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:39,280
And part of that joy comes with this justification of what they perceive as someone with real

1305
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:43,120
power and wealth and privilege being taken down a peg.

1306
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:48,640
It's like this bizarre delusion that I or any of my friends have any real power or influence

1307
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:51,520
outside of our very niche corner of the internet.

1308
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,840
I am not a real celebrity.

1309
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,920
I almost never get recognized in public.

1310
01:19:55,920 --> 01:20:01,320
I don't have a PR team or a manager or a stylist or a team of lawyers.

1311
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:08,280
Just one very anxious literary agent and one YouTube agent who honestly, he thinks this

1312
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,280
shit is hilarious.

1313
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:12,880
I also kind of miss the diet Nazis because like they at least knew what they were.

1314
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:16,480
They weren't harassing me like it was some civil rights campaign that might make the

1315
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,660
world marginally more just.

1316
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:22,240
They were just bullies, plain and simple, and they were proud of it.

1317
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:25,160
And you know, honestly, in hindsight, I kind of respect that.

1318
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:31,560
At least my mentions being full of like pictures of razor blades and dead animals and Clorox

1319
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,040
saying, hey, drink this.

1320
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,480
You know, at least that's honest.

1321
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:38,080
I do appreciate that the people making good faith criticisms are not responsible for the

1322
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:43,900
people making bad faith criticism or for that matter threats or rejoicing in my downfall.

1323
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:48,040
But it is beyond the scope of reasonable to expect me to take all this stimulus.

1324
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:54,060
Thousands of people screaming at me from reasonable to sadistic, especially considering everything

1325
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:57,760
I've been through in my life and behave like the perfect victim.

1326
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:59,760
If you just say the right thing, we'll leave you alone.

1327
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:02,740
If you just behave in the way we're asking, we'll make it go away.

1328
01:21:02,740 --> 01:21:04,960
If you just apologize, we just stop.

1329
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,440
All she had to do was like, listen.

1330
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:09,440
She had a long history of problematic shit and she never listened.

1331
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:10,960
She should have done the work to make amends.

1332
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:14,280
Maybe next time don't call an entire marginalized group crazy.

1333
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:18,480
She's a biphobic, transphobic racist mess who deleted her account rather than apologize

1334
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:19,680
for being a piece of shit.

1335
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:22,440
She couldn't take actual criticism for people who knew more than she did.

1336
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:26,640
Motherfucker, all you had to do was apologize for her white bread take and move on.

1337
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:28,560
Deleted her own account then just apologized.

1338
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,320
Nuked her account instead of apologized.

1339
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,580
Totally unraveled under the slightest scrutiny.

1340
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:34,320
Deleted her account instead of saying I fucked up.

1341
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:35,320
Sorry.

1342
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:36,320
Why are you so emotional?

1343
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,320
Why are you so upset?

1344
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:40,200
I'm not with the hundreds of people saying you're responsible for hate crimes and mass

1345
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:41,200
murder.

1346
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:44,440
I'm not one of the people trotting out the obsessive documentation of every misstep you've

1347
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:46,240
ever made over the last 15 years.

1348
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,640
I'm the reasonable one.

1349
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:48,640
And I'm calm.

1350
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:49,640
Why aren't you calm?

1351
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:51,200
Why aren't you addressing this?

1352
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:52,200
Why hasn't she apologized?

1353
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:54,200
When is she going to apologize?

1354
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:56,000
When are you going to apologize?

1355
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Never Becky.

1356
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,280
The answer is never.

1357
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,200
At least not to you.

1358
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:04,960
Someone on my subreddit wrote a really thoughtful essay on the whole situation and here is a

1359
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:05,960
quote from that.

1360
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:10,640
Abuse should always be a part of our analysis and we should be aware every single second

1361
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:14,880
that we participate in these conversations that our actions have the potential to excuse

1362
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,400
or perpetuate abuse.

1363
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,220
We should take responsibility for that.

1364
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:21,040
Take steps to mitigate it and hold ourselves accountable.

1365
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:23,720
This is why I have such distrust for the position.

1366
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:25,480
Why should I have to talk about abuse?

1367
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:27,560
I'm not personally abusing anyone.

1368
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:31,280
You should have distrust for that position because that is exactly what they said to

1369
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,800
me during gamergate.

1370
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:34,420
Sucks.

1371
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:35,420
Same thing.

1372
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:44,940
What follows in campaigns like this is the other isolation tactic.

1373
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:47,440
Targeting your colleagues, friends, and loved ones.

1374
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:48,800
This comes in two flavors.

1375
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:53,520
Demanding that the colleagues of the accused answer for their crimes or trying to deplatform

1376
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:58,400
said colleagues because you're already riding high off the previous victory, so who's

1377
01:22:58,400 --> 01:22:59,400
next?

1378
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:00,560
Sara Zett is next.

1379
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,200
Jenny Nicholson is next.

1380
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,720
ContraPoints is next.

1381
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:05,520
Jenny in par-fucking-ticular.

1382
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,520
Jenny is next.

1383
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:07,520
Jenny, you're next.

1384
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:08,520
Jenny, next.

1385
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:09,520
Jenny, next.

1386
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:10,520
Jenny, next.

1387
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:15,320
Both Jenny Nicholson and ContraPoints were trending at certain points during the weekend

1388
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,320
because of me.

1389
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:21,400
Faked screenshots of a racist tweet that Jenny never made spread like wildfire with the goal

1390
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:24,820
of getting her driven off of Twitter because of me.

1391
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:28,280
And a year and a half ago, the shoe was on the other foot because a lot of the same crowd

1392
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:29,900
was attacking Natalie.

1393
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:33,420
It must needs be remarked that a huge contingent of the people who have it out for me right

1394
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:39,260
now hate me for sticking by Natalie during the Angel Buck incident about 18 months ago.

1395
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:42,980
And if you want to know more about that, here's the thingy thingy.

1396
01:23:42,980 --> 01:23:47,220
And it's really only now that I can make sense of it that I got so many hate follows after

1397
01:23:47,220 --> 01:23:51,660
that, that people were so eager to screencap anything and everything I said on Twitter,

1398
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:56,940
no matter how minor or petty, to create this narrative of me as a secret, horrible person

1399
01:23:56,940 --> 01:23:58,540
just because I stood up for my friend.

1400
01:23:58,540 --> 01:23:59,820
And I don't regret doing it.

1401
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:00,820
I would do it again.

1402
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:04,220
But it is insane that I am paying such a high price for that now.

1403
01:24:04,220 --> 01:24:08,400
And now my other colleagues are being targeted for no other reason than the crime of being

1404
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:13,340
friends with me, for not publicly denouncing me, for not validating their anger.

1405
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:14,340
And why?

1406
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:18,700
Jenny is one of the smartest, most insightful people I know.

1407
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:22,360
Sarah always floors me with how much research and nuance and sensitivity she brings to her

1408
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:23,360
topics.

1409
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:25,020
And she's only 22.

1410
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:28,940
Natalie is, well, she's a whore, but she's my whore.

1411
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:33,460
These obsessive campaigns to try to push these narratives of my friends as bad people and

1412
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:37,540
secret TERFs and secret racists are just baffling to me.

1413
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:42,220
Global fascism is on the rise on a level we haven't seen in more than a generation.

1414
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:47,780
Are there not enough out and proud racists that you feel you need to unmask the My Little

1415
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:49,100
Pony YouTuber?

1416
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:51,820
Jenny next, Jenny next, Jenny next.

1417
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:55,940
So do not give me this horseshit about accountability.

1418
01:24:55,940 --> 01:24:58,580
This is obviously just entertainment to you.

1419
01:24:58,580 --> 01:25:00,220
Just fucking own it.

1420
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:05,700
Obsessively chronicling every perceived misstep we've ever made that could be interpreted

1421
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:10,820
badly all while completely ignoring the rest of our entire bodies of work.

1422
01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:13,160
Why are you wasting so much energy on this?

1423
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:16,540
Because you can't impact people who are actually doing your community harm.

1424
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:18,060
You can't shame the shameless.

1425
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:19,940
Trump will never face justice.

1426
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:22,180
Brett Kavanaugh's on the Supreme Court for life.

1427
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:24,440
Ben Shapiro gets off on your outrage.

1428
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:26,980
So you shame those who can be shamed.

1429
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:30,500
And if you call one of us bigoted enough times, people will start to believe it.

1430
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:34,980
And then you can feel like you solved racism by spreading lies about a person you have

1431
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:40,060
never met and never will and was doing you and your community no harm.

1432
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:41,060
Well done.

1433
01:25:41,060 --> 01:25:42,060
Shabosh.

1434
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:43,700
Good job.

1435
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:46,740
Fuck every single one of you.

1436
01:25:46,740 --> 01:25:49,240
You do not deserve grace.

1437
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:55,740
You do not deserve sympathy.

1438
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:58,140
Part eight, the beast.

1439
01:25:58,140 --> 01:26:02,700
So obviously, in my case, the easy thing to do would be eat crow and move on.

1440
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:08,140
I never would have gotten trending if I hadn't deleted my Twitter account, but I'm not here

1441
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:11,480
to say a bunch of shit I don't mean because PR.

1442
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:12,540
Fuck PR.

1443
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:14,820
You want your precious authenticity?

1444
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:15,820
Here it is.

1445
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:19,100
There's a danger to normalizing the insincere apology.

1446
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:24,260
And if we normalize acting like PR bots and dole out disingenuous apologies whenever they

1447
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:30,980
are demanded for any reason, valid or invalid, any harm, real or imagined, then this isn't

1448
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:31,980
discourse.

1449
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:33,380
This is performance.

1450
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:37,520
The reason campaigns like this gain traction is because they prey on communities that try

1451
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:39,740
to operate in good faith.

1452
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:44,380
They take advantage of people's goodwill and they condition cynicism.

1453
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:46,260
So inevitably people harden over.

1454
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:48,140
They default to skepticism.

1455
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:53,400
Even this fucking woman of color who harangued Kat Black demanding that she answer for collaborating

1456
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,680
with such a racist?

1457
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:55,980
Well, guess what?

1458
01:26:55,980 --> 01:27:00,720
That person eventually fessed up to being a white man before deleting his account because,

1459
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:03,040
you know, listen to POC.

1460
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:07,860
People are so obsessed with identity as a rhetorical trump card, you can't even take

1461
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:11,280
it on good faith that people are who they say they are anymore.

1462
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:15,600
And they take that desire to do right and exploit it because it makes them feel powerful.

1463
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,560
This is the real mask off.

1464
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:18,720
You're next, Jenny.

1465
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:19,900
You're next, Sarah.

1466
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:21,280
You're next, Natalie.

1467
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:24,280
Because running women off Twitter is fun.

1468
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:27,000
I mean, accountability.

1469
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:33,000
So militantly performing allyship by rooting out corruption like it's the fucking Red Scare,

1470
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:37,480
sharing doctored screenshots of tweets that don't exist and willfully misinterpreting

1471
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:43,400
things to prove that the My Little Pony YouTuber is a secret racist?

1472
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:46,840
Deep down, you know you're just doing it for clout, right?

1473
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:51,140
You should be sensitive to marginalized groups and you should be constantly advocating for

1474
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:56,900
a more just world and against racism because we all have the stink on us.

1475
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:59,760
But that should be the goal in itself.

1476
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:05,200
Not performing on Twitter so people can reassure you you're one of the good ones.

1477
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:08,420
So you can get max retweets for an awesome dunk.

1478
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:09,640
I am not innocent.

1479
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:11,100
I have done this.

1480
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:16,500
And as content creators, our behavior online turns from due diligence into threat modeling.

1481
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,460
And I'm not playing this game anymore.

1482
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:23,460
Trying to stay 18 steps ahead of the worst possible interpretation of my words or actions

1483
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:25,380
isn't taking accountability.

1484
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:27,380
It's just self-defense.

1485
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:29,720
It's just protecting the brand.

1486
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:34,220
And I understand why there is this lingering culture of distrust, especially among communities

1487
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:35,220
of color.

1488
01:28:35,220 --> 01:28:39,220
But it is the height of dishonesty to suggest that the kind of atmosphere where everything

1489
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:42,580
is taken in bad faith leads to a more just world.

1490
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:46,020
I'm not furious because I'm uniquely wronged.

1491
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:47,240
I will be fine.

1492
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:49,420
I didn't actually lose anything.

1493
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:55,720
I could have pretended nothing happened and probably be better off because nobody cares

1494
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:57,940
about the fucking Raya tweet.

1495
01:28:57,940 --> 01:29:03,080
I'm furious because this keeps happening and we have deluded ourselves into thinking that

1496
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:08,960
savaging each other for the smallest transgression and the most minor disagreement is helping

1497
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,800
right the wrongs of the world.

1498
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:14,920
That there's this broad refusal to admit that our systems that operate on good faith are

1499
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,800
very often abused.

1500
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:20,380
I was going to include a section about other people from more marginalized groups than

1501
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:26,260
me who are held to an even higher standard of purity, who have lost way more than I have

1502
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:29,120
for equally minor perceived transgressions.

1503
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:33,500
But you know, you probably already know some and they probably don't want me using their

1504
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:34,500
names anyway.

1505
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:37,960
But I feel like I need to impress that I didn't start getting noticeable harassment from the

1506
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:43,300
Purity Tester Brigade until I stood up for a trans woman on Twitter over, and I cannot

1507
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:48,040
express this enough, a situation that did not deserve anything approaching the level

1508
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:50,180
of outrage that it fostered.

1509
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:55,620
And that backlash did not come from the alt-right or even the diet Nazis, but our own community.

1510
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:58,520
Our side.

1511
01:29:58,520 --> 01:29:59,520
This is why they win.

1512
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,740
A friend of mine named it The Beast.

1513
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:05,280
The name for this fear that we all live under but don't acknowledge.

1514
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:09,820
And over the last few years, I have had so many of my colleagues, all of them women,

1515
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:14,560
people of color, trans people, queer people, or some combination of the above, voice to

1516
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:19,360
me the constant anxiety that they live with about maybe saying something wrong that will

1517
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,940
get them on the bad side of their own communities.

1518
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:24,000
Every thought is a hostage situation.

1519
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,260
Is this the tweet that's going to sink me?

1520
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:27,540
So what do we call it?

1521
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:31,900
What is the name for this unspoken, unacknowledged culture of fear where we all know that one

1522
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:34,060
misstep can ruin our lives?

1523
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:38,980
This social media culture where we participate in the public shaming one day and become chained

1524
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:40,340
to the pillory the next.

1525
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:43,140
We can't even talk about it because The Beast does not have a name.

1526
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:46,900
If we admit that this is a problem, then the right will just take it and run with it and

1527
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:49,120
use it to increase their own power.

1528
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:50,660
Same as they did with cancel.

1529
01:30:50,660 --> 01:30:52,200
Same as they did with woke.

1530
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:53,620
Same as they did with fake news.

1531
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:55,580
If it has a name, then it has power.

1532
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:58,440
So it is a discussion that cannot be had.

1533
01:30:58,440 --> 01:30:59,660
And so we do not have it.

1534
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:03,540
We say cancel culture doesn't exist and ignore this disease.

1535
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:05,940
Pretend it isn't doing real harm.

1536
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:10,120
Not just to individuals who are targeted, but to the state of discourse in general.

1537
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:14,780
And especially to individuals in marginalized groups, because they are always held to the

1538
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:18,860
highest standard of purity and they always have the most to lose.

1539
01:31:18,860 --> 01:31:21,900
It isn't even about saying something tone-deaf or insensitive.

1540
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:27,340
A mere difference in opinion might get you fired from your job if enough people raise

1541
01:31:27,340 --> 01:31:28,660
a stink about it.

1542
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:31,720
And just so we're clear, I'm not really even talking about me.

1543
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:33,380
I will be fine.

1544
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:38,460
But living under the shadow of the beast makes it hard to just create at all.

1545
01:31:38,460 --> 01:31:44,260
A big factor in why it takes us so long to do a single video is threat modeling.

1546
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:49,020
Because god forbid you say something mildly positive about one of the bad ones that you

1547
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:51,160
did not know were bad.

1548
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:56,060
So much of the work we do is getting ahead of any potential misstep by adding like 1800

1549
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:59,560
caveats and acknowledgments and it's never enough.

1550
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:03,340
Angelina and I were collaborating with fellow author and essayist Jeanette Ng on a video

1551
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:07,560
about the live-action Mulan that Jeanette was co-writing and was going to co-host.

1552
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:12,280
And we'd been working on it for months and right after this happened I was like, we have

1553
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:13,720
to scrap this video.

1554
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:16,340
But then after a few days I was like, for what?

1555
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:21,000
Because a bunch of Twitter teens are gonna call me a racist for criticizing a movie nobody

1556
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
likes?

1557
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,400
Y'all were gonna do that either way.

1558
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:28,020
Believe me, I know that this video is not going to change any minds.

1559
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:33,340
It's going to make a lot of people very angry and I hope they get lots of engagement.

1560
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:34,620
I hope they see.

1561
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:37,020
I wish you all of the retweets.

1562
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:38,540
But I can't stay ahead of it anymore.

1563
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:43,380
I'm not going to do the performance of avoiding offense, of staying 500 steps ahead of everything

1564
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:46,260
that might be misread or misinterpreted.

1565
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:50,020
Not because it's the right thing to do, but just to protect my brand.

1566
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:51,020
Fuck my brand.

1567
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:54,180
I will do the due diligence, but I'm done with threat modeling.

1568
01:32:54,180 --> 01:32:55,420
I just don't care anymore.

1569
01:32:55,420 --> 01:33:00,160
If you want to read bigoted dog whistles into everything I say, go with God.

1570
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:05,880
If you want to pass my list of sins to everyone who so much as mentions me in a positive way,

1571
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:07,660
I hope it brings you peace.

1572
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:12,580
If you want to speculate on my private life, I hope it brings you much profit.

1573
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:15,360
I hope you accrue much social capital.

1574
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:18,920
I personally choose to take a page from the book of my political enemies.

1575
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:23,940
You can't shame the shameless, so I'm going to use the term cancel in its original vernacular

1576
01:33:23,940 --> 01:33:24,940
meeting.

1577
01:33:25,460 --> 01:33:29,440
I'm canceling shame, and I will fuck with shame no more forever.

1578
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:33,460
So if anything, thank you for liberating me from giving a fuck.

1579
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:39,460
Part 9.

1580
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:40,460
What Now?

1581
01:33:40,460 --> 01:33:45,860
I want to acknowledge that I got dozens if not hundreds of messages of support in private

1582
01:33:45,860 --> 01:33:48,500
through Patreon, Instagram, and email.

1583
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:54,340
And while not all of them were 100% you did nothing wrong, I would be remiss not to acknowledge

1584
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:55,340
that.

1585
01:33:55,340 --> 01:33:58,140
Some of them genuinely made me cry with how kind they were.

1586
01:33:58,140 --> 01:34:03,060
Even some of the ones who were critical of what I said were done with a sense of empathy.

1587
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:08,300
And I'm sorry I didn't respond to most of you, but just know I read all of your messages.

1588
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:11,820
And friendly reminder, I will be fine.

1589
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:12,820
Until my liver gives out.

1590
01:34:12,820 --> 01:34:16,080
This is like the 800th time something like this has happened to me.

1591
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:17,600
But am I done with Twitter?

1592
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,980
Basically, yeah.

1593
01:34:18,980 --> 01:34:23,220
I honestly intended to be forever done with Twitter, but I was then reminded that I am

1594
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:27,340
contractually obligated to promote my books through social.

1595
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:31,140
Contractually obligated pre-order link for my second book in the description.

1596
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:36,420
So I'll still use it for that sort of thing, and I will continue using it to promote smaller

1597
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:41,540
creators and authors when I find something that I think deserve attention.

1598
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:43,740
And also shameless nepotism.

1599
01:34:43,740 --> 01:34:45,260
People calling me a nepotist.

1600
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:47,260
How dare you say a thing that is true?

1601
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:52,460
But my biggest mistake was using Twitter in the way that a lot of my friends who had way

1602
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:54,420
fewer followers than me did.

1603
01:34:54,420 --> 01:34:59,180
Like yeah, I can be a little edgy, I can make jokey jokes, I can just be, you know, I can

1604
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:01,780
be like one of the boys.

1605
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:04,500
And I should have stopped doing that a long time ago.

1606
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:08,620
Worse, Twitter is just a recipe for both addiction and misery.

1607
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:11,020
They call it doomscrolling for a reason.

1608
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:15,760
Like even in the last couple weeks, I feel like my brain is having to rewire just this

1609
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:18,340
impulse to constantly be checking Twitter.

1610
01:35:18,340 --> 01:35:20,380
And it was making me a shittier person.

1611
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:24,100
I was getting in fights with people more and more, I was dunking on people more and

1612
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:27,540
more, I was clapping back at followers more and more.

1613
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:30,140
Like one other person I owe an apology to is Moviebob.

1614
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:34,780
I told him on Twitter to leave me alone because he was acting like a creep by being over-familiar

1615
01:35:34,780 --> 01:35:39,980
and continually signaling to the world that we're friends, and he was acting like a creep

1616
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:41,460
and we're not friends.

1617
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:45,260
But I would have never done that if I had known that the diet Nazis were gonna turn

1618
01:35:45,260 --> 01:35:46,260
that into a meme.

1619
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:50,200
Like I don't like a lot of what he says on Twitter either, but please stop using my face

1620
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:52,280
to torture this man, leave him alone.

1621
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:55,660
So at its core, this was a wakeup call.

1622
01:35:55,660 --> 01:35:58,800
And that is why I deleted my account.

1623
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:01,520
Part and it can happen to you.

1624
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:06,640
I want to reaffirm that the roots of this do stem from a rise in anti-Asian racism,

1625
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:09,020
and that racism is very real.

1626
01:36:09,020 --> 01:36:13,600
As I was writing this video, a friend of mine on Facebook posted a screencap of this truly

1627
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:19,280
heinous thing that Mike Huckabee said, which not only regurgitates this inane conservative

1628
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:25,040
garbage about identity politics, it completely dismisses the very real wave of hate that

1629
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:26,880
is happening in America right now.

1630
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:31,960
And he posted it with this comment, white people, please pay attention every day.

1631
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:37,360
A person of color has to look at something like this or worse every literal day.

1632
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:38,360
Try.

1633
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:41,440
Just try to imagine what that would do to your psyche.

1634
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,040
And it hurt to read.

1635
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:48,200
And honestly, it hurts for me to even read out loud right now because it's true.

1636
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:51,040
I literally only can imagine.

1637
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:56,220
Few of the people stoking anti-Asian violence right now will suffer consequences and probably

1638
01:36:56,220 --> 01:36:58,520
more racist attacks will occur.

1639
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:04,800
And this is just another chapter in our country's long, sad history of anti-Asian racism.

1640
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:09,620
And the reality is there's not a lot we as individuals can do about that.

1641
01:37:09,620 --> 01:37:12,420
We live in a fundamentally unjust world.

1642
01:37:12,420 --> 01:37:14,120
I do acknowledge that.

1643
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:18,280
And at the beginning, anyway, a lot of the frustration at the original tweet did stem

1644
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:19,280
from that.

1645
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:22,600
And I don't want to dismiss all public feedback as inevitably harassment.

1646
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:27,640
I think it's important to retain this nuance, lest we always frame the issue of harassment

1647
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:30,920
as a blanket condemnation of the public and public feedback.

1648
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:34,900
But I also cannot stress enough how quickly this whole situation went from valid criticism

1649
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:41,360
rooted in real hurt to straight up abuse and not just of me, of my friends, my colleagues,

1650
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:46,280
this disease that is Twitter enacting the same passion play again and again and again.

1651
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:50,240
Even people who were sympathetic to me, they still wanted to attribute the hate to one

1652
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:56,120
thing, you know, one slip of the tongue, one bad take, one wrong affiliation, one wrong

1653
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:57,120
tone I took.

1654
01:37:57,120 --> 01:38:03,540
I've seen so many people try to rationalize it even when they think I did nothing wrong.

1655
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:08,100
But the reality is what gets you on the radar of the mob is nothing.

1656
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:14,660
A picture, a joke, a comment, just existing as a woman, a person of color, a woman of

1657
01:38:14,660 --> 01:38:21,540
color, a queer person doing your job, one unpopular opinion, a poorly aged take, being

1658
01:38:21,540 --> 01:38:26,700
online for too long, being associated with the wrong person, saying something nice about

1659
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:28,220
the wrong person.

1660
01:38:28,220 --> 01:38:31,040
Sometimes all it takes is being successful.

1661
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:34,560
People want to rationalize your mistakes and list them and label them not because it has

1662
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:37,100
anything ultimately to do with you.

1663
01:38:37,100 --> 01:38:38,360
It doesn't.

1664
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:42,820
But because they want to reassure themselves that it will never happen to them, that it

1665
01:38:42,820 --> 01:38:45,140
will never be them on the pillory.

1666
01:38:45,140 --> 01:38:49,100
So even if you don't think I did anything wrong, if you can still pin this on a specific

1667
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:53,280
error, then you can distance yourself and sleep well that you would know better than

1668
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:55,100
to make the same mistake.

1669
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:56,720
And it would never happen to you.

1670
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:58,500
And that's just not how it works.

1671
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:03,340
Part of what makes Twitter so toxic is the sense of hopelessness it engenders.

1672
01:39:03,340 --> 01:39:08,500
You're exposed to this never-ending stream of bad news and constant examples of how fucked

1673
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:14,020
the world is and reminders that you have the power to affect very little change.

1674
01:39:14,020 --> 01:39:18,240
That compounded with the fact that platforms like Twitter rely mostly on shorthand and

1675
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:22,500
are constantly encouraging you to produce and encourage knee-jerk reactions with very

1676
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:27,540
little context means that hopelessness and powerlessness and aggression, it's got to

1677
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:28,760
go somewhere.

1678
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:32,380
And on March 26, 2021, it got funneled to me.

1679
01:39:32,380 --> 01:39:37,620
And I cannot in good faith say I have not done the same, mindlessly joined in on a dog

1680
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:42,560
pile on someone who said something stupid or insensitive because it felt good.

1681
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:45,600
And for a brief moment, it gave me a sense of power.

1682
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:49,140
But then that moment is gone and the world is still shitty.

1683
01:39:49,140 --> 01:39:54,300
And that person's life, whatever their infraction was, deserved or undeserved, is marginally

1684
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:57,180
worse for my involvement in it.

1685
01:39:57,180 --> 01:39:59,140
And that is why I'm stepping away.

1686
01:39:59,140 --> 01:40:03,860
So for all of the people who used me as their outlet for their pain and aggression on that

1687
01:40:03,860 --> 01:40:09,660
crisp spring morn, I understand that you feel hopeless and powerless in an increasingly

1688
01:40:09,660 --> 01:40:11,360
shitty world.

1689
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:16,180
And I understand that there is a reason to assume bad faith when so many other people

1690
01:40:16,180 --> 01:40:18,060
have let you down.

1691
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:25,100
And the only thing I can do for you is extend the same grace and compassion that you extended

1692
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:25,600
to me.

1693
01:40:29,140 --> 01:40:31,140
Thank you.
