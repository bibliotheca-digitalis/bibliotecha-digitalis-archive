0	8000	So, last week I was in a restaurant in North Carolina and we were sitting at the bar and
8000	11560	the owner was sitting right there because they were about to close and my mother starts
11560	15800	talking to her and somehow or other the owner just looks at me and she's like, well, what
15800	16800	do you do?
16800	22600	And, you know, I wasn't about to tell her I'm a YouTuber, so I was like, I'm a writer.
22600	24960	I mean, I am technically.
24960	25960	And she's like, well, what do you do?
25960	29920	So, I told her my name and she's like, I'm going to Google you and I was like, okay,
29920	31920	I'm super canceled right now.
31920	36220	And she like laughed and clearly thought I was kidding or maybe didn't know what that
36220	39480	meant or, you know, knew it in some like right wing way.
39480	43520	And then she like Googled me and like started laughing because the first thing and, you
43520	49000	know, like the questions people ask is, why is Lindsay Ellis canceled?
49000	51740	And I mean, why indeed?
51740	54120	But before I get into this, I need to lay some groundwork.
54120	57160	Ladies and boomers of the jury, here you go.
57200	61680	Shaming is a public shaming of a member of a community for some violation of that community
61680	64780	standards by other members of that community.
64780	69700	But the term actually originated with a 1981 song called Your Love is Canceled by the band
69700	70700	Chic.
70700	74560	The song was inspired by a bad date guitarist Niall Richards went on at the height of the
74560	80040	band's success wherein his date behaved in a way that he felt was presumptuous and unacceptable,
80040	81320	which really turned him off.
81320	88200	Your love is canceled No, your love is canceled
88200	92440	So basically, it was inspired by this idea of any potential future we might have had
92440	95540	any potential love that might have developed canceled.
95540	100020	The song was not a hit at the time, but it stuck around and over the decades, the term
100020	104760	as used in the song started appearing in other pieces of art and music, including in songs
104760	110160	by rappers like 50 Cent and Lou Wayne until eventually gaining popularity in the vernacular
110160	111180	of black Twitter.
111180	116460	In this original vernacular use, declaring someone or something canceled was not really
116460	122140	an attempt to like instigate a boycott or hold someone to account, but more of a personal
122140	127460	decision, not unlike Chic's original song, canceling them in the television of your mind.
127460	130440	So to cancel someone wasn't a call to deplatform.
130440	134940	It was more just saying, you stepped out of line, so I'm done with you.
134940	140100	Like when the city of New York canceled Mayor de Blasio for eating pizza with fork and knife,
140100	142680	which to be fair is the only reason to criticize the man.
142680	146220	The connotation of this term with call outs and deplatforming didn't happen until a few
146220	151120	years ago as Me Too began and call outs did lead to some powerful people actually losing
151120	152120	things.
152120	156800	According to Washington Post writer Clyde McGrady, as call outs led to greater consequences,
156800	160580	some people became nervous about how social media had changed power dynamics in the court
160580	162140	of public opinion.
162140	166140	Cancel culture was the diagnosis and the term became a catch all defense for those trying
166140	168820	to evade public criticism of any kind.
168820	174260	But now cancel is just another word that white people have taken and run into the ground.
174260	180620	So like woke before it, it has gone from AAV vernacular to right wing grievance buzzword,
180620	183000	which is more or less where we are today.
183000	188300	Pretty quickly and we are now seeing wokeism and diversity and inclusion.
188300	192580	This is just the cancel culture and I will tell you, the people at home should be scared
192580	196500	because their ballgame is next, their business will be next.
196500	201380	If it continues, it won't just be Republicans who get cancelled, it won't just be the president
201380	203180	of the United States.
203180	205100	The cancel culture will come for us all.
205100	208900	So I have a lot that I want to unpack here because I've had a bit of an ordeal that
208900	214060	led to me realizing that I was bad for Twitter and Twitter was bad for me.
214060	216180	And so I deleted my account.
216180	220340	And for some dumb fucking reason, the fact that I deleted my Twitter account not only
220340	224980	made like actual news, my name was trending for several days.
224980	229860	Is this another video about canceling or worse, the dreaded apology video?
229860	232780	Like do these people not realize I'm not a real celebrity?
232780	239420	I'm the number 21,000th ish most subscribed channel on YouTube and I've published all
239420	243740	of one book that only reached number seven on the New York Times list, but it did hit
243740	244900	the New York Times list.
244900	248540	So we'll get into why in a minute, but like I'm neither going to go full Andrew Cuomo,
248540	252600	pew pew, I'm being canceled by multiple credible allegations.
252600	254360	You're never going to be president, Andy.
254360	259280	Or full crying apology video, though those do seem to be good for business.
259280	266040	And I just ask that you press pause for a moment and even just for 10 seconds, just
266040	271280	cover this in prayer because there is so much healing that needs to take place.
271280	272280	Some of the time.
272280	273280	No, sir.
273280	277860	I've decided to do the one thing Americans should never do and vote third party.
277860	280180	It's been a long time since we've done a list, hasn't it?
280180	284380	So here we go.
284380	290660	List part one, Twitter is garbage in the halcyon days of the early 2010s.
290660	295940	Justine Sacco was a PR executive who traveled often for work and not having many Twitter
295940	300900	followers herself often tweeted pity little nothings, which on the morning of December
300900	307060	20th, 2013, as she was boarding a flight at Heathrow for a work trip included this tweet
307060	308060	going to Africa.
308060	309700	Hope I don't get AIDS.
310220	311220	Just kidding.
311220	312220	I'm white.
317420	321420	Okay, so on its face, this is pretty inexcusable.
321420	325740	It didn't take long for the tweet to catch the eye of Sam Biddle, then an editor at Gawker
325740	328580	Media, whose signal boosted it with a comment.
328580	332420	And now a funny holiday joke from IAC's new PR boss.
332420	336100	The flight from Heathrow to Cape Town was 11 hours.
336220	342540	And in that 11 hours, attention to this tweet spread like wildfire, incredulity, horror,
342540	346280	disgust, and also very quickly, glee, excitement.
346280	351020	Sacco had less than 200 followers and being on a plane with no internet, didn't know that
351020	356440	she was Twitter's villain of the day, nor that she was one of the top trends worldwide.
356440	361160	So there was a delicious irony to the fact that this woman had been canceled and didn't
361160	362160	even know it.
362160	367000	She had her flight number, tracked it obsessively, were just thrilled with this idea that she
367000	370840	was going to land, and realized she had been found out.
370840	374580	The hashtag has Justine landed yet also began to trend.
374580	379200	Someone even went to the Cape Town airport when she landed, took a picture of her, and
379200	381040	shared it with the rest of the world.
384880	389880	A few months later, upon being asked why it appealed to him, Sam Biddle said of the incident,
389880	393140	The fact that she was a PR chief made it delicious.
393140	398560	It's satisfying to be able to say, okay, let's make a racist tweet by a senior IAC employee
398560	399900	count this time.
399900	400900	And it did.
400900	402040	I'd do it again.
402040	406300	But while people of course gleefully obsessed over the tweet, no one seems interested in
406300	409360	why she said it or what she meant by it.
409360	411380	No matter how you cut it, it's a bad look.
411380	413760	It's a flagrant flaunting of privilege.
413760	419800	So it's funny that she got fired and I mean, I'm not gonna, she had it bad for a while.
419840	426060	And like, I don't want to speculate on exactly how ruined her life was, but it would also
426060	430480	be reasonable to assume that this is a joke about white privilege, right?
430480	434680	That it was bad and insensitive and made light of a terrible affliction that still kills
434680	439160	thousands of people every day, but that she didn't mean it literally.
439160	442420	And at the time, everyone involved seemed to think that of course she deserved to have
442420	447640	her life ruined over it, even if they understood it was a joke about white privilege.
447640	451680	Christine Sacco's family in South Africa were African National Congress supporters,
451680	453400	the party of Nelson Mandela.
453400	456360	They were long-time activists for racial equality.
456360	461600	So while I can't read her original intent, perhaps she felt worldly enough and enough
461600	466040	in the club and enough of an ally that she could comfortably make such a joke and that
466040	467680	it would be understood.
467680	471920	White people do this a lot and I cannot say I am not guilty of this too.
471920	476880	A year later, Sacco said to Jon Ronson, author of So You've Been Publicly Shamed,
476880	481920	To me it was so insane of a comment for anyone to make, I thought there was no way that anyone
481920	483800	could possibly think it was literal.
483800	487760	Living in America puts us in a bit of a bubble when it comes to what is going on in the third
487760	488760	world.
488760	490400	I was making fun of that bubble.
490400	494520	While also conceding, I had no business commenting on the epidemic in such a politically incorrect
494520	496720	manner on such a public platform.
496720	501120	Biddle got caught up in his own shitstorm when he tweeted the following in 2014.
501120	505480	And you'll never guess who was mad on the internet in 2014.
505480	509480	Ultimately, Gamergate is reaffirming what we've known to be true for decades.
509480	512600	Nerds should be constantly shamed and degraded into submission.
512600	516480	Then adding, bring back bullying.
516480	518840	I was there, man.
518840	521280	Bold of you to provoke them like that.
521280	522640	Well, you can guess what happened.
522640	527300	There was a massive campaign against him, some from obvious bad faith right wing trolls,
527300	533400	but some who seemed to think that he literally was advocating for a return to the 1950s where
533400	537040	dumping books of dorky middle schoolers was de rigueur.
537040	542100	Biddle publicly apologized to Sacco on the anniversary of her, well, it wasn't called
542100	547700	canceling yet, Twitter-wide dog pile, let's call it, writing,
547700	551560	Twitter is a fast machine that almost begs for misunderstanding and misconstrual.
551560	553660	Deliberate misreading is its lubricant.
553660	557760	The same flatness of affect that can make it such a weird and funny place also makes
557760	559780	it a tricky and dangerous one.
559780	561200	Jokes are complicated.
561200	562560	Context is hard.
562560	563560	Rage is easy.
563560	568960	By this point, they had actually become friends, and comparing their experiences, he said,
568960	571440	structurally, we had made the same sort of joke.
571440	575480	Here is what a truly horrible person, a person whose attitudes were entirely opposite from
575480	578240	mine and those of the people who know me, would say.
578240	582700	You could argue that hers was worse, conjuring a real and pernicious attitude that had resulted
582700	587240	in systemic historical oppression and mass death, but the impulse was the same, and so
587240	588600	were the reactions.
588640	592760	So even though there's a disconnect between the intended interpretation and the actual
592760	597400	interpretation, there's also a disconnect between the severity of the crime and the
597400	603300	gleeful savagery of the punishment, and this is not relegated to the early 2010s, it happens
603300	604860	now more than ever.
604860	607360	Twitter always has a villain of the day.
607360	613600	Before me, it was shrimp bean dad, I don't know, something something milkshake duck.
613600	614920	God, am I a milkshake duck?
614920	617560	I feel like I'm too old to be a milkshake duck.
617560	619680	I've been around too long to be a milkshake duck, right?
619680	623720	To a certain extent, the villain of the day almost follows a script, especially now that
623720	628080	we've all been losing our minds because we've all been inside for a year doing nothing but
628080	629780	looking at our phones.
629780	635400	Person says dumb thing, it gets some attention, person gets defensive, the defensiveness spurns
635400	642900	outrage, people start coming out with receipts, the OP deletes their account...
642940	648540	And Twitter is garbage because the user experience, UX as they call it in the industry, is designed
648540	654380	to encourage this kind of behavior, it's engagement, fast and emotional and satisfying, and easily
654380	655380	forgotten.
655380	659500	Communication through Twitter often happens through shorthand, micro-interactions that
659500	665560	fit a limited number of predetermined narratives and scripts because you're exposed to thousands
665560	670780	of these per day, which is why we have these Twitter script phrases such as, wow, this
670780	676780	blew up, friendly reminder, casual reminder, mask off, I don't know who needs to hear
676780	681800	this, but thank you for coming to my TED talk, should have stayed in the drafts, read the
681800	686900	room, I'm trying to see something, I'll just leave this here, asking for a friend,
686900	689020	send tweet, the list goes on.
689020	693220	And the way it provokes rage in dogpiles is baked into the way the very platform itself
693220	694220	is designed.
694220	700280	Twitter as a company has a really big problem where outside of its user base, its reputation
700280	705960	is quite bad, and it hasn't really seen an increase in active users in years.
705960	710280	When a site hits its peak in terms of total active accounts, there is still capitalist
710280	715980	pressure to increase value and profit, a shrinking pool of eyes plus a need to increase revenue
715980	720480	equals a service that needs to squeeze more blood from the same stones.
720480	725000	So every UX decision is geared towards increasing time spent with eyes on the screen.
725000	729540	That's why they've developed non-chronological timelines, tweets that get added to your feed
729540	735300	by virtue of other people liking them, goddamn fucking quote tweets, and so on.
735300	739220	Twitter is designed quite literally to be addictive, they aren't getting new users,
739220	742840	so they have to keep the ones who are there from logging off.
742840	746340	Twitter wants you to post, and it wants you to boost, and it wants you to engage, so it
746340	751160	will put as few barriers between the user and engagement action as possible.
751160	754540	So with all that in mind, it's no wonder that among the many pre-written shorthand
754540	759140	Twitter scripts, Twitter's villain of the day is even a thing, and that it's a common
759140	764900	truism on Twitter that the only goal is not to become the villain of the day.
764900	768420	The unspoken understanding that it can be anyone if they're not careful.
768420	770900	It'll happen to you.
770900	778300	No way man, we're gonna keep on rockin' forever, forever, forever, forever, forever.
778300	782940	Engagement is often driven by outrage, and so we have this combination of high emotionality
782940	784740	with a desire to perform.
784740	789260	Social media is designed to manipulate our desire for approval, and a part of that these
789260	792460	days is the desire to perform allyship.
792460	796680	White people in particular all want to be told they're one of the good ones.
796680	800580	Which is why people like Justine Sacco gained such attention in the first place.
800580	806500	In a fundamentally unjust world, it's satisfying to take a cosseted bigot down a peg.
806500	812060	So if we can only get one more wrong-headed bigoted head on a pike, humiliate one more
812060	818580	blackface steward, or one more appropriative food blogger, we could heal this world.
818580	823660	And inevitably, it was my turn, because I cannot shut the fuck up on Twitter.
823660	829740	On Friday, March 26th, 2021, I was Twitter's villain of the day.
829740	834300	So for those of you who haven't yet seen my offending tweet, let's have it, my Justine
834300	835300	Sacco moment.
835300	838020	Are you ready to see why mommies cancel?
838020	841620	Also watched Raya and the Last Dragon, and I think we need to come up with a name for
841620	845420	this genre that is basically Avatar The Last Airbender reduxes.
845420	850100	It's like half of all YA fantasy published in the last few years anyway.
850100	851300	That's it.
851300	856340	That's the tweet.
856340	858540	So I imagine some of you are very confused.
858540	861040	Part two, valid criticism.
861040	866420	So from what I can tell, the whole thing originated when some Southeast Asian artists and animators
866420	872060	read the tweet as being dismissive and reductive and implying all Asian inspired things are
872060	874140	the same genre.
874140	877500	And to me, it was made even more frustrating by the fact that several of the people who
877500	880900	started this hadn't even seen the movie.
880900	884160	In fact, most people who were getting involved with this conversation hadn't even seen the
884160	885160	dragon movie.
885160	887780	It looks like no one saw the dragon movie, but here's the thing.
887780	893480	I kind of had my own has Justine landed yet experience by popping off the tweet, reading
893480	899320	a few responses who understood where I was getting at going to bed and it blew up while
899320	901080	I was asleep.
901080	903160	Hashtag has Lindsay woken up yet?
903160	908120	And because by the time I woke up, I'd already gotten a few like, Oh my God, are you okay?
908120	911720	messages from friends before I even opened Twitter.
911720	916660	By the time I looked at my timeline, I saw very little that I would consider valid criticism.
916660	922020	So I feel like I need to establish that this whole thing stopped being about valid criticism
922020	924140	very, very quickly.
924140	926700	And I'll talk about that later in the video.
926700	931700	But by the time I woke up, it had already blown way past this is a careless display
931700	937660	of white privilege to this sort of thing as a contributing factor to the mass murder of
937660	943980	Asian women that just happened.
943980	948140	So this is what we call an overstatement of harm.
948140	955200	It had gone from possible insensitive microaggression from a C-list YouTuber to contributing to
955200	956620	hate crimes.
956620	960000	And that didn't feel like anything I would consider valid.
960000	964900	So it's, you know, early in the morning, I just woke up and I responded with frustration
964900	970260	because I was being ascribed an intentionality, which was not there, which, well, if anyone
970260	974260	who spent any time on Twitter can tell you, getting defensive and doubling down is about
974260	976160	the last thing anyone should do.
976160	978600	So that was an oopsie.
978600	984160	And I tried to give, you know, some credence to the valid criticism by saying, like, you
984160	986960	know, if you squint, I can kind of see what you're saying.
986960	993040	And God damn it.
993040	994280	It was like, it was early.
994280	998920	I went like it was like, you shouldn't tweet in the morning.
998920	1000320	You shouldn't tweet at all.
1000320	1001320	You shouldn't tweet.
1001320	1002320	Nobody should tweet.
1002320	1006080	So that very poorly worded frustration was met with even more outrage that I was not
1006080	1012560	taking in to be valid critique of POC when I am too busy being bowled down by mountains
1012560	1017800	of hyperbole and this word racist over and over and over, which is bound to make anyone
1017800	1019320	a little bit defensive.
1019320	1023440	So when all of these things are coming at you, it's impossible to genuinely consider
1023440	1028520	actually valid critique in a timely fashion because your defenses are at a hundred.
1028520	1032920	And when I'm being accused by hundreds of people of contributing to anti Asian American
1032920	1038980	hate crimes by saying that the Disney thing reminded me of the Nickelodeon thing, it's
1038980	1044040	honestly kind of stunning to me that any reasonable person would expect someone in my position
1044040	1050040	to take in all of these hundreds of tweets, process them reasonably, and within minutes
1050040	1056340	be like, hmm, yes, I see your point, reasonable ones, because I am able to parse you out from
1056340	1059760	the people saying I'm responsible for hate crimes.
1059760	1064340	Now before we go forward, it must be acknowledged that being any person of color in the United
1064340	1071720	States right now is just to be constantly worn down in a million tiny ways every day
1071720	1077240	all the time by a society that is low key shitty.
1077240	1078600	High key shitty.
1078600	1079600	It's shitty.
1079600	1082940	These critiques don't come from nothing and there are issues both in the film industry
1082940	1086800	and the culture at large that is making people hyper vigilant.
1086800	1088760	I'm not going to follow that with a however.
1088760	1094320	I just want to lay that groundwork and acknowledge that.
1094320	1096680	Part three, white nonsense.
1096680	1101080	I know that's not the most PC way of saying that, but I have many, many white friends,
1101080	1103120	so I'm allowed to say that.
1103120	1108840	So in the case of this tweet, I went to bed morning on the East Coast and you know, there
1108840	1115040	was some discourse by people who, you know, had some valid upset and the nations all live
1115040	1119160	together in harmony until the whites attacked.
1119160	1124920	Because a common refrain of these valid criticisms were that I was ignoring POC voices and talking
1124920	1131400	over POC voices, but the vast, vast majority of the avalanche of angry I was getting was
1131400	1132920	from white people.
1132920	1142400	Not all, but definitely, at least in terms of the extremely hyperbolic ones, the majority.
1142400	1146800	White people, come here, come here.
1146800	1147800	We need to have a chat.
1147800	1151440	I think maybe we need to admit that those of us on the progressive side of the fence,
1151440	1155160	as it were, are feeling kind of under pressure these days.
1155160	1159400	We are horrified by the racial injustice of the world, especially in the US.
1159400	1164360	We feel the need to perform action, but aren't really presented with very many opportunities
1164360	1165600	to do so.
1165600	1171080	My friend and PBS co-host Princess Weeks remarked during another stupider Twitter thing that
1171080	1177520	happened a few weeks prior about fanfiction ethics.
1177520	1180840	Actually it's about ethics and fanfiction.
1180840	1185280	It deeply amuses me when people treat shipping, pro and anti, with so much political importance
1185280	1189300	when they literally apply that to nothing else, and to remove all nuance and context,
1189300	1193840	to share fake quotes and facts, to perpetuate harm in order to own people, over the right
1193840	1195400	for two white people to kiss.
1195400	1200360	When you marginalize really queer BIPOC and marginalized people, for what?
1200360	1205640	In other words, often white progressives cite black voices when in service of your...
1205640	1210660	well, in this case, ship.
1210660	1211660	It was Hannibal.
1211660	1214720	Oh my god, this is so stupid.
1214720	1218000	You're interested in black voices when it's in the service of pwning another white person
1218000	1223200	or white creator, whomst you disagree with, but show little interest for issues or advocacy
1223200	1229000	that actually concern black voices in their community, independent of said pwnage, only
1229000	1233880	to immediately be told, you're not a real queer little girl, you privileged little twat
1233880	1237120	by a white lady about 15 minutes later.
1237120	1240960	To be clear, this discussion was about fanfiction.
1240960	1246400	This was about pretend people kissing, pretendly.
1246400	1252440	So I saw a lot of mealy-mouthed smug nothing about do better and listen to POC.
1252440	1253440	Always listen to POC.
1253440	1255680	Why aren't you listening to POC?
1255680	1258560	Elevate POC voices, always.
1259560	1260560	Okay.
1265560	1266560	Whomst.
1266560	1271760	Whomst is the valid person of color, oh allies of the jury, because I did listen to a lot
1271760	1278000	of POC, both in public and in private, and I gotta tell ya, there's a diversity of opinions,
1278000	1280560	almost like people of color aren't a monolith.
1280560	1285360	Marginalized communities are not without diversity or conflict, so treating it as such is totally
1285360	1291320	reductive and ignoring other POC voices by centering the loudest or angriest as the most
1291320	1292320	authoritative.
1292320	1299080	A problem only compounded by the way Twitter is designed, which I have already argued,
1299080	1300080	is bad.
1300080	1305080	As I was going back and forth over the timeline and everything that had happened, I found
1305080	1312560	this private message from fellow YouTuber who I have to disclose is half Vietnamese
1312560	1316840	because this is irrelevant, and he said I'm trying not to say anything I'm going to regret
1316840	1321440	here, but I have very little respect for the people dogpiling me and mine in the defense
1321440	1326120	of a typically derivative corporate product from the biggest media company in the West
1326120	1330200	because two of its seven writers and zero of its directors were Asian.
1330200	1334720	This in private, of course, because, you know, you didn't want to get harassed.
1334720	1336920	Privileged twat.
1336920	1342120	So I find the listen to POC refrain, because it's only trotted out in the service of white
1342120	1348240	people pwning other white people very revealing because what they mean is listen to the POC
1348240	1350800	we can use to pwn someone else.
1350800	1352720	But the POC we don't agree with?
1352720	1353720	Privileged twat.
1353720	1359560	But note this hilarious exchange between two white people arguing over my riot tweet.
1359560	1364960	When pressed on what exactly it is I need to admit wrongdoing for, this woman says,
1364960	1370400	again, you're just another white woman talking over actual POC concerns.
1370400	1375800	I love this exchange because this person, one of the shit billion white people mindlessly
1375800	1381480	regurgitating this listen to POC shorthand, the very same person who called Princess a
1381480	1382740	privileged twat.
1382740	1388880	You're not a real queer little girl.
1388880	1390200	Princess's law in action.
1390200	1395340	There's this incredibly childish dichotomy with the way a lot of people discuss racism,
1395340	1401020	that there are the racists and the non-racists, the two genders.
1401020	1407340	And the way to solve racism is to root out the racists and cast them onto racist island,
1407340	1412400	away from me and mine, the non-racists, one of the good ones.
1412400	1416120	They do this because they are insecure about their own internalized racism.
1416120	1418540	They cannot conceive that they have any.
1418540	1422320	That thought is terrifying to them because a racist is the worst thing you can be.
1422320	1427000	So instead of doing any introspection, they remain hypervigilant to root out the secret
1427000	1434780	bad people so everyone else will know they're one of the good ones.
1434780	1440680	Racism is a complex system upheld from all wings of our society, from laws to hiring
1440680	1446560	practices to generational wealth to community redlining to internal biases to individual
1446560	1448260	actions.
1448260	1450620	We live in a white supremacist society.
1450620	1454060	When you live in a pigpen, you're gonna get covered in shit.
1454060	1456060	And all of us have the stink on us.
1456060	1457940	And I don't just mean the whites.
1457940	1458940	All of you.
1458940	1459940	Blocked.
1459940	1460940	Blocked.
1460940	1461940	Blocked.
1461940	1463620	None of you are free from sin.
1463620	1464700	But especially the whites.
1464700	1471420	And yet people still have this like, Elby the racist dragon attitude about how racism
1471420	1472420	works.
1472420	1474420	Why are you crying so?
1474420	1479420	I'm crying because all of those horrible villagers chased me into this scary cave.
1479420	1483500	I think it's because I'm so racist.
1483500	1486300	Get your hand off my tail, you'll make it dirty.
1486300	1491740	Racism isn't a system perpetuated by many, many things, including actions, but a character
1491740	1496140	trait, a disease that people try to hide from the world because they know if they're found
1496140	1499580	out, they'll get banished to racist island.
1499580	1503900	And suddenly, he wasn't racist anymore.
1503900	1508240	While there are still, of course, racist hate crimes and the like, most general displays
1508240	1514960	of racism don't come out of grand, like cross burning style gestures, but out of ignorance,
1514960	1516840	carelessness or negligence.
1516840	1521160	And for white people, a lot of it is just the reality of benefiting from a system designed
1521160	1522340	to privilege you.
1522340	1526460	So I'm not going to waste my breath on the I'm not a racist line of defense.
1526460	1528320	I'm a white woman from Tennessee.
1528320	1531480	My family is mostly uneducated white trash.
1531480	1534560	I'm not going to be like, yeah, I didn't internalize any of that.
1534560	1535560	I'm special.
1535800	1538920	I shot out of the womb unscathed.
1538920	1541040	We all have the stink on us.
1541040	1543960	Yes, even you.
1543960	1548680	The reason I bring this up is because another thing that happened after that tweet was the
1548680	1551080	sharing of the receipts.
1551080	1555840	Thousands of people passing around screen caps of tweets and videos and blog entries
1555840	1560920	and anecdotes from my personal life, proving that this was not just a one off.
1560920	1564040	Oh, no, I have a long history.
1564040	1565040	It was high time.
1565040	1567320	I was banished to racist island.
1567320	1573120	And it's true, I do have a long history of being on the Internet longer than pretty much
1573120	1576760	all of you statistically, probably.
1576760	1582060	And there is a list of sins floating around Twitter carefully and obsessively curated
1582060	1584960	over a period of 13 years.
1584960	1585960	Amazing.
1585960	1587560	Is it because there's a pandemic?
1587560	1589900	Where do you guys get all this free time?
1589900	1594740	So I've been accused of a lot of terrible things and remanded for never owning up to
1594740	1595740	my mistakes.
1595740	1598660	Well, today is your day, receipt keepers.
1598660	1601960	You guys have worked so, so hard on this.
1601960	1605020	So I am going to give you what you asked for.
1605020	1610740	Finally, all that hard work meticulously coming through every word I've ever said is going
1610740	1612740	to pay off.
1612740	1617180	Well, that that's what you wanted, wasn't it?
1617180	1619980	Part four, my list of sins.
1625740	1629500	You weren't prepared for this to turn into a drama channel, were you?
1629500	1630500	Yeah, maybe you were.
1630500	1634020	I mean, this is just what happens when they break your spirit utterly.
1634020	1639560	So a big part of my, you know, self-preservation strategy over the years is to explain myself
1639560	1643060	as little as possible, because, you know, if you do that, it's already a losing game
1643060	1646020	and rarely, if ever, talk about my personal life.
1646020	1648460	Clearly, a big mistake on my part.
1648460	1650780	Well, today we are turning the page.
1650780	1653260	We are spilling the tea.
1653260	1654260	The whiskey.
1654780	1658060	I knew I was saving this for a special occasion.
1658060	1659060	Technically, whatever.
1659060	1660820	Got my, got my deception.
1660820	1662820	I haven't used this one in a while.
1662820	1663820	Oh, God.
1663820	1664820	Yeah, I really haven't used this in a while.
1664820	1670080	So take a shot every time Lindsay Ellis does a problematic.
1670080	1676980	So a common refrain during that weekend where I was trending was party A says Lindsay did
1676980	1680760	a racism and party B's like, well, what did she do?
1680760	1685400	Party A would show the tweet and party B would be like, I don't get it.
1685400	1686720	This doesn't seem like a big deal.
1686720	1691760	And then party A would be like, ah, no, she has a long history of problematic.
1691760	1694040	And party B is like, ah, I get it now.
1694040	1696800	And then they skip off together into the sunset.
1696800	1703440	Twitter user Dragon Lady Celeste Sparkle has conveniently collated my long storied history
1703440	1708880	of all my other sins that explain why the Raya thing was just a mask off moment.
1708880	1714820	And I deserve this, actually, a very good and normal thing to do with your finite minutes
1714820	1716820	on this earth.
1716820	1719760	Take down that YouTuber.
1719760	1720760	Take her down.
1720760	1724960	Literally, all day, people have been replying to my tweet with more and more examples of
1724960	1728980	truly harmful rhetoric that Ellie has been pushing for a while.
1728980	1733120	And all I can say is how the fuck has she not been called out on a mass scale before?
1733120	1736760	Well, Dragon Sparkle Celeste, she has.
1736800	1739600	She just never deleted her Twitter account before.
1739600	1740820	Actually, no, that's not true.
1740820	1744720	Last time I deleted my Twitter account, I didn't trend because I guess I wasn't, you
1744720	1751560	know, number 21,000 on the subscribed YouTube channel by that point.
1751560	1756680	But the last time I deleted my account, it was because of the, you know, white genocide
1756680	1757920	crowd.
1757920	1760680	So I guess that's something you have in common.
1760680	1764200	I don't get why I'm like so hated by both sides of the political fence.
1764240	1769480	I don't I don't think I'm like interesting enough to like gather this much attention
1769480	1770480	or emotion.
1770480	1773480	I drive a Honda Civic like Jesus.
1773480	1778800	So thank you for compiling it in one convenient thread.
1778800	1779800	Makes my job easier.
1779800	1784000	Now, the problem with this not at all creepy and obsessive list of every single one of
1784000	1789500	my perceived transgressions over a period of 13 years is that it does not include the
1789500	1791360	times when I have addressed them.
1791560	1796200	But, you know, I'm sure they just, you know, forgot to screen cap those tweets slash blog
1796200	1801400	posts slash streams slash videos, et cetera, you know, because this list is in such good
1801400	1805480	faith.
1805480	1810360	Nor does it incorporate any of my entire body of work, which I don't know, doesn't count
1810360	1814020	apparently because, you know, the list of sins is the real me and the other stuff I
1814020	1816680	do is for profit or something.
1816680	1820480	So there's like a jillion of these grievances and, you know, this video is already like
1820600	1821600	12 eternities long.
1821600	1826760	So believe it or not, what I am about to address is non-comprehensive because there are a lot
1826760	1832400	of people who were really, really dedicated to, you know, mask off.
1832400	1833920	And credit to where it's due.
1833920	1838680	This was spearheaded by the, you know, leftist Twitter.
1838680	1841880	But again, a lot of these receipts originated with the right wing.
1841880	1845320	I don't even want to call them alt-right, you know, because they're not that principled,
1845320	1851160	you know, like more, more like, you know, gamergate refugees, the fortune for the lulz
1851160	1854120	crowd, diet Nazis, let's call them.
1854120	1859280	So some of this is, as many of you have noted, extremely bad faith interpretations of statements,
1859280	1863600	which only makes sense if you are working backwards from a foregone conclusion.
1863600	1868040	That said, I don't want this to be taken as me saying that I have never done anything
1868040	1869040	wrong.
1869040	1870940	Unambiguously, I have.
1870940	1872620	We all make mistakes.
1872620	1877820	So where I feel like an amendment or an apology is warranted, I will do so.
1877820	1882660	But where I feel like the criticism is being made in bad faith, is unreasonable, or is
1882660	1886120	flat out untrue, I shan't bend the knee.
1886120	1891740	Because we here at Lindsay Ellis Industries are not in the business of serving bullshit.
1891740	1899780	So I got my bell of shame here, and as the Black Eyed Peas would say, let's get it started.
1902620	1908020	2020 Harriet Tubman fanfic.
1908020	1916380	This one is, like, really popular.
1916380	1922580	So the narrative here is that because of this tweet, I ship Harriet Tubman with her enslaver,
1922580	1925220	and I want there to be fanfic of it.
1925220	1928840	I'm just saying, you have to be giving this a very weird read in order to think that's
1928840	1929840	what I meant.
1929840	1935240	But I'm also going to go out on a limb and assume that most of the people mad about this
1935240	1938180	have not seen the Harriet Tubman movie.
1938180	1942580	Or if they have, are not familiar with her real history.
1942580	1946980	So the central conflict of the film revolves around Harriet's relationship to her enslaver,
1946980	1951760	a twinkie blonde guy named Gideon, played by Taylor Swift's thin boyfriend.
1951760	1956420	They are around the same age, they basically grow up together, and early in the film he's
1956420	1961040	framed somewhat sympathetically until he propositions her, demands her submission and
1961040	1965800	fealty, which of course she refuses, and then when she escapes he becomes obsessed with
1965800	1970160	recapturing her, and he is the central antagonist of the entire film.
1970160	1973720	But here's the thing about Gideon, he never existed.
1973720	1976240	He was completely made up for the film.
1976240	1982200	Harriet Tubman's IRL enslaver at the time of her escape was a woman, but instead of
1982200	1986300	having the film center more around Harriet's journey after she got away from the Brodess
1986300	1992420	family, it instead creates this character in the form of Taylor Swift's boyfriend as
1992420	1999300	the antagonist, a man who, and I cannot express this enough, did not exist in real life.
1999300	2006340	So basically the film creates an OC that is like super obsessed with recapturing her in
2006340	2011780	a movie where Harriet Tubman also has superpowers.
2011780	2013640	It just felt a little fanfic-y to me.
2013640	2018460	And so one day I was on an airplane and the person next to me was watching it, and I just
2018460	2023560	kind of started wondering why the filmmakers decided to go that route with the film creatively,
2023560	2027020	because again it just kind of felt weird to me.
2027020	2033440	Like you know, the final showdown in the film is between Harriet and Gideon in a forest
2033440	2038480	that to me was somewhat evocative of the last showdown in The Force Awakens, and this was
2038480	2043700	also kind of like at the height of this sort of thing, this tendency to fanficify historical
2043700	2046680	figures that was partially enabled by Hamilton.
2046680	2052280	So I just kind of idly have this thought like, oh man, I wonder if this movie spurned fic
2052280	2057080	of these two characters, oh god, actually I'm not going to check because I don't want
2057080	2058080	to know.
2058080	2062020	Usually I don't really check my mentions, so I didn't see any anger when I tweeted that.
2062020	2066220	Only a few days later when screen caps started circling, and then I got some white women
2066220	2071780	in my DMs demanding that I do better and apologize, specifically not to them but to
2071780	2074260	all of my black fans that I hurt.
2074260	2078500	So like an hour after I tweeted it, I was like, hmm, I better take this down because
2078500	2082900	this is the sort of thing that someone could take out of context in bad faith.
2082900	2084300	Welp.
2084300	2089560	So the reason I never addressed this is because like the read of that tweet in itself of me
2089560	2096320	being thirsty for Harriet Gideon fanfic was just so absurd, I didn't know what to say.
2096320	2099720	Now to be clear, no, I should not have tweeted that at all.
2099720	2105120	I was thinking in terms of the creative decision to create Gideon being kind of tone deaf,
2105120	2110360	but the pithy way that I tweeted it still ostensibly glosses over the reality of white
2110360	2115760	owners sexually abusing their slaves being the historical norm, and that is in itself
2115760	2117540	disrespectful.
2117540	2121680	So while I definitely did not mean what people seem to think I meant, I definitely should
2121680	2122940	not have said that.
2122940	2127460	I was, as the kids say, showing my ass.
2127460	2133500	Next, 2009 autistic temper tantrum.
2133500	2137740	Boy, I had to go way back for this one.
2137740	2141100	People wonder why I privated all of my old videos.
2141100	2147300	So I was in film school at the time, and my class was 80% male, and you know, some of
2147300	2149620	them had a Friday sense of humor.
2149620	2154740	And while I was talking about this movie, Beauty and the Beast, The Enchanted Christmas,
2154740	2159580	one of them made this remark about how the beast and I just kind of mindlessly regurgitated
2159580	2160580	it.
2160580	2161580	Beast shape.
2161580	2165820	I'm going to throw an autistic temper tantrum because I was with an edgy boy website at
2165820	2168900	the time and I wanted to demonstrate that I wasn't like the other girls.
2168900	2171460	I was a cool edgy boy.
2171460	2172940	It was insensitive and careless.
2172940	2176020	I definitely should not have said that.
2176740	2181580	Next, 2013, The Prince of Egypt anti-Semitism.
2181580	2186020	God, I just, I can't, I can't believe somebody kept this for so long.
2186020	2187020	I'm just, I'm sorry.
2187020	2189820	This is just, this took so much dedication.
2189820	2196020	So the qualm here is that I did an anti-Semitism because I don't like the way the Prince of
2196020	2201540	Egypt, you know, functionally excuses the mass slaughter of innocent children in the
2201540	2205700	narrative, you know, because the book of Exodus frames it as a necessary evil.
2206380	2208980	And yeah, I just, I don't really care for the Prince of Egypt.
2208980	2212220	And I just don't think the book of Exodus works as a kid's movie.
2212220	2216220	Because it's a kid's movie, it has to frame the protagonists as understandable and relatable
2216220	2221220	to modern family audiences and frame what happens in the book of Exodus as, you know,
2221220	2224220	all fine and good in the framework of the movie.
2224220	2228900	Even when the good guys do some light, you know, mass slaughter.
2228900	2232740	That tenth plague, man, it's a doozy.
2232780	2236980	I remember when we got to Exodus in Sunday school and, you know, when it got to the part
2236980	2241420	of the wailing and lamentations of the Egyptian women, you know, when they woke up and there
2241420	2246780	were dead children, like even at the age of five, I was like, it was pretty fucked up.
2246780	2252300	So my thought process here is that we take for granted the morality of narratives of
2252300	2257900	biblical texts because we grew up with them and they just kind of have so much informed
2257900	2262620	our cultural framework, when if a story like this existed independent of the Bible, it
2262620	2265380	would probably be considered pretty messed up.
2265380	2268600	Especially considering how the movie frames it as all Pharaoh's fault because he's such
2268600	2270580	a stubborn jerk.
2274580	2277580	Rameses, you bring this upon yourself.
2277580	2280680	Like at least in the Bible, God keeps hardening his heart.
2280680	2284940	And the other thing is like in the way that the film progresses, it's really funny to
2284940	2289940	me when you're like mass slaughter of children happens, Pharaoh Ralph Fiennes is weeping over
2289940	2296940	the corpse of his only son and then Val Kilmoses morosely peaces out and then bam, miracles.
2303940	2308380	I mean, I guess in a matter of speaking, the 10th plague is a miracle.
2308380	2311140	And this is not to say you can't make a modern movie about the Bible.
2311140	2313060	I actually really liked Noah.
2313060	2317740	It's easily my favorite Darren Aronofsky movie because it leans in hard on how fucked up
2317740	2322460	and traumatic it would be to have to sit back and, you know, watch and listen while every
2322460	2326340	other human on earth dies, you know, because God said so.
2326340	2328340	They are just people.
2328340	2330340	There is room.
2330340	2332340	There is no room for them.
2336940	2340380	But this is also an example of me using Twitter to feel out other people's opinions before
2340380	2343540	I do video content, a thing I will never do again.
2343540	2346180	A lot of people were like, yeah, but you know, this movie means a lot to me.
2346620	2349620	And, you know, a lot of that is because of like my religion or my culture.
2349620	2353620	And that was when I decided I was not ever going to touch this movie as a topic for a video.
2353620	2357500	And in the context of this thread, I shouldn't have used the word genocide, considering it's
2357500	2359380	a film about Jewish characters.
2359380	2360380	And for that, I do apologize.
2360380	2365140	Like, I don't think I'd be making the world a better place by talking about why I don't
2365140	2369900	think the Prince of Egypt works because I don't feel that strongly about it.
2369900	2371700	It's not a big deal.
2371700	2375820	I'm not really here for thing you like is bad actually content for its own sake, although
2375820	2378700	I love how every tweet in this thread has trigger warnings.
2378700	2379700	Trigger warning.
2379700	2380700	She didn't like the Prince of Egypt.
2380700	2381700	Next.
2381700	2382700	2013.
2382700	2383700	Charlie's Angels niqab.
2383700	2391380	This is another one I've addressed a few times, most recently on a live stream a few years
2391380	2395940	ago where we rewatched it and had a high old time laughing about what a comical example
2395940	2399580	of early 2010s white feminism this was.
2399580	2400580	You know what, guys?
2400580	2401580	I'm sorry.
2401580	2402580	I'm calling it.
2402580	2403580	Feminism is over.
2403580	2404580	I'm sorry.
2404580	2405580	I'm sorry.
2405580	2406580	I tried.
2406580	2407580	We did our best.
2407580	2408580	But it's our feminism, too.
2408580	2409580	We should get in it for everyone.
2409580	2414580	I'm not sick of the go make me a sandwich jokes.
2414580	2416900	Why do we even have that lever?
2416900	2420420	Yeah, so not gonna lie, this one's pretty bad.
2420420	2424180	This whole thing came about when I was on Twitter one day talking about doing a video
2424180	2427700	on Charlie's Angels and trying to think of like how visually to dress myself that was
2427700	2430140	like the opposite of Charlie's Angels.
2430140	2434020	And someone on Twitter was like, hey, you should do it in a burqa with like pigtails
2434020	2435020	poking out.
2435020	2436740	And I thought that idea was funny.
2436740	2437740	It's too confusing.
2437740	2438740	We don't know what we want.
2438740	2442700	It is apparently way too much to ask that women like either have a certain body type
2442700	2445000	or dress a certain way without being judged for it.
2445000	2450460	So two options, burqa or slut.
2450460	2451460	That's not burqa.
2451460	2452460	And that's a false dichotomy.
2452460	2456760	And even at the time, several of my Muslim followers were like, please do not do this.
2456760	2459460	This is a bad idea.
2459460	2461060	And OK, so this is not excusing it.
2461060	2462060	But here is some context.
2462100	2466940	So at the time, my next door neighbor was an Egyptian expat named Hajar.
2466940	2471960	And she was slash is a full niqabi, meaning whenever she goes outside, she dresses in
2471960	2476660	like the full, you know, well, basically what I was wearing, minus the pigtails sticking out.
2476660	2480740	And basically Hajar was like the only next door neighbor I've ever been friends with.
2480740	2485060	And it's another one of those weird problems of considering culture as a monolith, like
2485060	2489020	one would assume, or at least I assumed that like she would have zero interest in talking
2489020	2492620	to me and we would have nothing in common, considering she's like super, super religious.
2492620	2495700	And yes, some women do it voluntarily, but that's something I'm not going to get into
2495700	2496700	it.
2496700	2500180	But basically, one day we started talking when I was watching the Hunchback of Notre
2500180	2502740	Dame too loud, really.
2502740	2507620	And she was like, she caught me on the landing, like, so Hunchback of Notre Dame, huh?
2507620	2510700	So anyway, I mentioned this thing to her and she was like, yeah, whatever.
2510700	2511740	That's hilarious, lol.
2511740	2515340	And so this is not excusing it, but I kind of took that as, well, my friend I know personally
2515340	2516580	said it's fine.
2516580	2520460	So I'm going to, you know, take that opinion over these strangers.
2520460	2524900	But again, even at the time I had people on Twitter saying, do not do this thing.
2524900	2526140	And I ignored them.
2526140	2531460	And either way, I wasn't making content for Egyptian expats, which I'm pretty sure she's
2531460	2533160	never even seen one of my videos.
2533160	2536620	And either way, it was also completely unnecessary to the point of the video.
2536620	2540940	Like I could have made the exact same point with like a potato sack with pigtails sticking
2540940	2543200	out and it probably would have been funnier.
2543200	2545160	This one was bad and wrong for a lot of reasons.
2545160	2546840	And I do regret that.
2548840	2549340	Next.
2553720	2558680	So the Dear Stephanie Meyer video was about me reflecting on how carelessly I had participated
2558680	2563360	in the casual misogyny surrounding the early Twilight backlash around the time that the
2563360	2566580	first movie came out, you know, late 2000s.
2566580	2571560	And so the general objection here is that the video is racist because I neither mentioned
2571560	2575960	nor condemned Stephanie Meyer's depiction of the Quileute people.
2575960	2581240	So I'm not going to lie and say I didn't consider addressing it.
2581240	2585960	And I did have some conversations on Twitter with indigenous people that were actually
2585960	2586960	productive.
2586960	2589640	See, Twitter's not always bad, just, you know, mostly.
2589640	2592760	But there were two main reasons I decided not to discuss it in that video.
2592760	2596000	You know, besides the fact that that was back when I was trying to keep videos around like
2596000	2597320	the 20 minute mark.
2597320	2601440	One was the fact that during the backlash of the late 2010s, Twilight's appropriation
2601440	2606360	of the Quileute was not a common criticism and certainly was not weaponized against Stephanie
2606360	2607480	Meyer.
2607480	2612920	It is now, but that just was not a substantial proportion of the backlash at that time.
2612920	2616800	The second one is once again, we come to this question of the voices of a group being considered
2616800	2617880	a monolith.
2617880	2623280	I definitely talked to some indigenous people that condemned it, but I also saw some that
2623280	2627680	were like, yeah, I mean, like, I mean, no, it's not the best, but I liked it.
2627680	2628680	It was something new.
2628680	2630800	It was like a representation we hadn't seen before.
2630800	2634920	It was refreshing to have Jacob as this character who isn't like a noble savage stereotype and
2634920	2638520	isn't like magically in tune with nature and doesn't have like a sad, broken family.
2638520	2642520	He's just like a nice, normal kid who lives on the rez and vibes, you know, at least in
2642520	2643520	the first book.
2643520	2647080	Again, this video was addressing a point in time before Breaking Dawn came out.
2647080	2650200	So I just wasn't really comfortable making a value judgment on which of those was the
2650200	2654520	correct opinion, especially because it didn't really feel relevant to the central thesis.
2654520	2658600	And it's also a complicated issue that just didn't feel at home in that video.
2658640	2662920	Like, for instance, on the one hand, the way the Quileute are depicted in Twilight puts
2662920	2666560	the onus on the real Quileute to educate people that they're not werewolves.
2666560	2672040	And then the elders, they, you know, said, hey, Miss Ann, you got to get out there and
2672040	2675120	educate people that were really not werewolves.
2675120	2680640	But on the other hand, the attention Twilight has brought to the tribe has helped them tremendously,
2680640	2686320	not just through tourism, but actually helped them get land back from the feds.
2686320	2689920	It's opened the way for our tribe economically.
2689920	2692320	And then the media, it helped us a lot.
2692320	2697960	You know, our ancestors and our past council members have been fighting for over 50 years
2697960	2704160	for our northern boundary dispute to actually have that day and have the President Obama
2704160	2708880	signed a document saying that, you know, this land is yours.
2708880	2710420	It was like, wow.
2710420	2715800	But on the other other hand, Stephenie Meyer is a multimillionaire many times over.
2715800	2719980	It is kind of weird that she has given none of that wealth, as far as I know, back to
2719980	2724760	a people whose culture she appropriated, you know, for supernatural love triangles.
2724760	2728280	And while we're on this topic, Amanda the Jedi has been doing a Twilight retrospective
2728280	2731400	and she brought to my attention a fundraiser that the Quileute have been running for a
2731400	2735280	few years to help move some of their village to higher ground to, you know, protect them
2735280	2739240	from all the tsunamis and, you know, the climate change and whatnot.
2739240	2740920	So that is linked below.
2740920	2745040	If I did the video again, especially now that my videos are like eight hours long, I'd probably
2745080	2749520	add a little bit mentioning that this conversation became prominent later.
2749520	2754160	But this criticism does kind of always give me weird vibes because it usually comes with
2754160	2759400	this subtext of, and this is why Stephenie Meyer did and still does deserve the harassment
2759400	2760400	she got.
2760400	2763600	One, that is not why people were hassling her in 2008, so I could not fold that into
2763600	2765380	the valid common criticism folder.
2765380	2767880	And two, no one deserves that.
2767880	2768880	Next.
2768880	2775440	2018, transphobia via Tarzan.
2775440	2779000	I genuinely honestly really do regret this one, and I have said so a few times.
2779000	2781200	Why do they never screencap their attractions?
2781200	2782200	Weird.
2782200	2786400	When it was announced that LeFou would become the first out gay character in a Disney movie,
2786400	2791480	the Ls, the Gs, the Bs, the Ts, and of course all you filthy, filthy Qs.
2791480	2795080	I think it was like 15 minutes after this video went live that I was like, oh God, why
2795080	2796080	did I do that?
2796280	2799960	Well, that's because I was thinking about the optics so much as it wasn't a good joke.
2799960	2802640	Like I should have used Mulan, goddamn my eyes.
2802640	2807920	I thought this idea of afab turk being angry about wearing a dress was funny, but in hindsight
2807920	2811120	I really should have considered that it wasn't just any Disney character.
2811120	2816640	It was a gorilla, an animal that trans women are sometimes compared to, and it was extremely
2816640	2817640	careless.
2817640	2820760	And it's a shame because I otherwise really do like that video.
2820760	2821760	Next.
2822760	2823760	Next.
2824760	2825760	2020.
2825760	2828760	Trans men don't experience oppression, actually.
2828760	2831440	I didn't say that.
2831440	2837560	I said that anecdotally I had heard from a few trans men over my 80 odd years of existence
2837560	2841400	that they felt that they didn't experience the same level of scrutiny or harassment that
2841400	2845200	they had before they transitioned because of misogyny.
2845200	2848800	That said, this was also before Elliot Page came out, and I've seen so many people be
2848840	2852600	beastly to him, so, you know, that is a strong counterexample.
2852600	2856080	And I could say that I can't speak for all trans men's experiences, but I didn't claim
2856080	2858800	to, and I'm not sure how you could read that into my statement.
2858800	2861880	I was just repeating anecdotes I had heard.
2861880	2866200	So some of the hate mail I've been getting is calling me a TERF because of this, which
2866200	2871040	I think is really funny, because it's like, called a TERF for saying trans men are men.
2871040	2872040	Alright.
2872040	2873040	Next.
2873040	2874040	2017.
2874440	2875440	Next.
2875440	2876440	2017.
2876440	2878760	Zack Snyder hates his mother.
2878760	2882920	Once again, tweet clipped out of context, and another one the gamergate refugees were
2882920	2885120	really obsessed with.
2885120	2887120	Not that you guys have anything in common, but...
2887120	2890200	So these tweets are all long deleted, but this was a conversation between me and another
2890200	2895320	film critic, I forget who, talking about how difficult it is to meaningfully discuss Zack
2895320	2901040	Snyder's films, especially at the time, because his fans are... a little touchy.
2901040	2904800	And one Snyder fan said, you know, I don't mind when critics talk about his movies, I
2904800	2908480	just don't like it when they say stuff like Zack Snyder hates his mother.
2908480	2913920	And this was just absurd to me because I have never ever heard a real critic say that, so
2913920	2918520	I responded with what I considered obvious sarcasm, well I actually have it on good authority
2918520	2923040	that Zack Snyder hates his mother.
2923040	2927140	So this was really bad timing because I made this joke literally the night before the news
2927140	2932180	broke that Autumn Snyder had killed herself, the very night before, and so I wake up to
2932180	2938220	just this flood of outrage in my mentions and like, I am so deeply confused before I
2938220	2944240	even realize what's going on, and it was just like, oh my god.
2944240	2947880	So I don't like Zack Snyder's movies for a lot of reasons, but he does seem like the
2947880	2952660	rare decent powerful man in Hollywood, and I can't imagine how awful it was to go through
2952660	2956780	what he did, especially during such a huge production, and I'm impressed and appreciate
2956820	2962220	that the Snyders have been doing such broad advocacy for suicide prevention now, but like
2962220	2971220	harassing me in the name of like suicide prevention advocacy is like, come on.
2971220	2975020	Now this is by no means Zack Snyder's fault, and I do not mean to imply that it is.
2975020	2979500	Again, from all I've heard through my Hollywood grapevine, he seems like a decent person,
2979500	2982940	and he can't control what his fans do, and even though I wish he had done it sooner,
2982940	2985860	he has finally disavowed the really bad ones.
2985860	2990140	And I also can kind of appreciate that he probably didn't really have the emotional
2990140	2995140	bandwidth to pay attention to that sort of thing for a long time, let alone, you know,
2995140	2996140	address it.
2996140	3000420	But I'm also sure that the many, many Snyder fans who have told me to kill myself in the
3000420	3006500	last four years because of this tweet just didn't know about my own history.
3006500	3010340	Either way, I'm sure it's an issue they all care deeply, deeply about.
3010340	3012020	All over a few Martha jokes.
3012020	3013020	Jesus.
3013020	3014020	Next.
3014020	3019300	2020 did a misgender.
3019300	3020460	This was a misunderstanding.
3020460	3022980	John Mulaney did an SNL monologue that I didn't love.
3022980	3024260	I said something about it.
3024260	3025700	Curio responded to that.
3025700	3027060	I said, yeah, I know.
3027060	3028060	Thanks, John.
3028060	3029100	Addressing John.
3029100	3030820	We talked it out over Twitter.
3030820	3032100	I apologized.
3032100	3034020	Those tweets are still up.
3034020	3035700	Next.
3035700	3039540	2012 defending the yellow facing Cloud Atlas.
3040180	3043940	I'm surprised there are no screen caps for this, probably because the diet Nazis didn't
3043940	3046380	find that worthy of preservation.
3046380	3047380	But this is true.
3047380	3050380	There was a lot of criticism of Cloud Atlas at the time, and I said something to the effect
3050380	3054860	of I didn't think it mattered as much as like, you know, the conversations around blackface
3054860	3057340	because they had a different history.
3057340	3059180	And I don't I don't know why I said that.
3059180	3060340	I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
3060340	3064020	Like, for one thing, I was definitely revealing my ignorance because, like, yellow face is
3064020	3066620	just, you know, a topic I had never really studied.
3066620	3069380	I'd done plenty on blackface, nothing on yellow face.
3069380	3072300	And falling on your sword for Cloud Atlas, of all things.
3072300	3074460	My podcast partner is going to be so disappointed.
3074460	3075460	I'm sorry.
3075460	3076460	Copy.
3076460	3079140	So, yeah, I still like Cloud Atlas, but the creative decision to use yellow face in the
3079140	3081220	way that they did is pretty inexcusable.
3081220	3083860	And honestly, it does kind of make me uncomfortable to watch now.
3083860	3084860	My bad.
3084860	3085860	Next.
3085860	3094700	2015 bisexual erasure.
3094700	3099180	So again, another post clipped out of context, and it is quite literally the only time I
3099180	3100780	have ever written about my sexuality.
3100780	3104660	And stuff like this is the reason why I was like, wow, never talk about that again.
3104660	3108220	It is from my now deleted blog, but I linked the archive page below.
3108220	3113700	And in effect, it was basically me kind of working out my feelings on feeling like bisexual
3113700	3116740	erasure was almost a form of privilege.
3116740	3119060	And I still kind of think that's true.
3119060	3123060	And the thing about sexuality is it's just like such a personal thing.
3123060	3129020	And that's why this like conflation of like the political and the personal, while necessary,
3129020	3136060	often makes me really uncomfortable because it was like such a painful process for me.
3136060	3141100	And one, I never really figured out how to reconcile, so I just never did.
3141100	3146580	So I've never really had a coming out or embracing my truths, more just like slow, quiet, begrudging
3146580	3147580	acceptance.
3147580	3151180	Like I just have these laundry lists of experiences, like for being in college and going to gay
3151180	3156020	clubs and having lesbians suddenly turn cold when they find out you're bisexual to the
3156020	3162020	popular axiom at the time of buy now gay later or highway to homo or gay until May
3162020	3165940	to Dan Savage way up into the 2010s saying that bisexual men don't exist or it's all
3165940	3171740	a phase or all the way to former respected person Glenn Greenwald saying that the bisexuals
3171740	3176960	are transing the lesbians out of existence as recently as last month.
3176960	3180960	So I can't help but feel a sort of imposter syndrome every time I do anything even tangentially
3180960	3182220	pride related.
3182220	3185660	I feel tolerated, but not accepted.
3185740	3187140	Why do I want to go to that parade?
3187140	3188420	Like, oh, you're here.
3188420	3189420	Fine.
3189420	3190900	I guess we're contractually obligated to let you in.
3190900	3195060	So I think for a lot of bisexuals, especially women, we do kind of live in this liminal
3195060	3198020	space of both privilege and erasure.
3198020	3202100	It is painful to feel ostracized from the community when accepting your identity has
3202100	3207300	caused you so much pain in the first place, but at the same time, you can opt out.
3207300	3209900	You can, in effect, pass a straight.
3209900	3215020	If I had a dollar for every time someone called me a straight white woman in the last few
3215020	3219060	weeks, that would take care of my Patreon for at least a month.
3219060	3224540	And to answer very good faith actors like Glenn Greenwald, what was his mother thinking?
3224540	3228820	So to answer very good faith actors like Blerp Blerp Blerp as to why proportionally bisexual
3228820	3234180	people tend to end up in heterosexual relationships 75-25 rather than the 50-50 it logically should
3234180	3235180	be.
3235180	3236180	Hmm.
3236180	3237740	I wonder why that could be.
3237740	3240700	You know, just besides the fact that as a proportion of humanity, there are more straight
3240700	3241700	people to choose from.
3241700	3243620	Well, here I am making a thing out of it.
3243820	3245820	Am I in the club now?
3248540	3249540	Next.
3250540	3251540	2014.
3251540	3255300	Did a bisexual gatekeeping against Mara Wilson.
3255300	3261180	Ah, so we have reached the speculations on my private life portion of the game show.
3261180	3264780	Is now a good time to bring up the fact that Lindsay Ellis was super shitty and biphobic
3264780	3268820	to Mara Wilson when she came out as bi, or are we giving people of color a moment to
3268820	3271500	drag her for filth before we bring up other shit?
3271500	3272500	Be honest.
3273380	3274380	Phew.
3274380	3277460	I guess we're doing this.
3277460	3282100	You may know Mara Wilson from her work as a child star in films like Matilda and Mrs.
3282100	3283100	Doubtfire.
3283100	3287140	In the last odd decade or so, she's worked as a nonfiction author, a voice actor, a Twitter
3287140	3292300	person who makes approximately 680 retweets per day, and also occasionally a writer of
3292300	3294380	op-eds for outlets like the New York Times.
3294380	3298380	In 2016, when she gave an interview about coming out as bisexual, it included this quote.
3298380	3300060	I remember being with bisexual friends.
3300060	3302000	I said, I think I might be bisexual.
3302000	3305080	And a friend of mine who's not a friend anymore said, no you're not.
3305080	3306080	She was a gaykeeper.
3306080	3307080	Okay.
3307080	3308080	That's good.
3308080	3310920	I'm going to use that.
3310920	3315160	So I'm not sure how this random Twitter user decided that she was talking about me as the
3315160	3321520	gaykeeper in this interview from 2016, but someone decided she must have been talking
3321520	3326000	about me based on no evidence whatsoever, and the accusation stuck, mostly because Mara
3326000	3331120	liked that tweet, and then about 50 other tweets of people having a high old time with
3331160	3333000	me as Twitter's villain of the day.
3333000	3336920	And I really don't know where this random user supposition came from, because I have
3336920	3342440	been very, very careful never to say anything about her publicly, either by reference or
3342440	3348000	implication, despite the many times she has talked about this awful former friend she
3348000	3357640	used to have, either in interviews, podcasts, subtweets, in print.
3357640	3358640	It was me.
3358640	3359640	It's me!
3360160	3363160	I was the turkey all along!
3365160	3367160	I was wondering what that turkey was doing there.
3367160	3371160	And to my knowledge, she's never indicated that I was the gaykeeper until the liking
3371160	3374640	of this tweet, thereby validating these suppositions.
3374640	3375640	Cool.
3375640	3377640	Cool, cool, cool, cool.
3377640	3382160	Okay, y'all, I'm about to blow some minds, but first I need to provide some context.
3382160	3385640	Mara and I were, at a point in history, friends and literal neighbors.
3385640	3389160	You know, we were both in our mid-twenties, we lived like two blocks from each other,
3389680	3392680	we were both recent NYU grads, and we were both aspiring writers.
3392680	3396680	And many people who've been following us for a long, long time have observed, hmm,
3396680	3400680	you two used to be really good friends, and then suddenly you were not.
3400680	3401680	And that is true.
3401680	3407680	But here's the thing, the anecdote about the gatekeeping bisexual former friend is
3407680	3408680	also true.
3408680	3412680	I do remember the conversation she is talking about, and while the wording she uses isn't
3412680	3416680	how I remember it, the basic gist of the conversation is true.
3417200	3420200	She told me she thought she might be bisexual, and I kind of casually dismissed it on the
3420200	3425200	grounds of her dating style, reminding me of a former roommate who prided herself on
3425200	3426200	being straight.
3426200	3431200	It was a fairly short conversation, it happened one time, like seven years ago?
3431200	3433200	Yeah, and we never spoke of it again.
3433200	3438200	So this conversation happened at least a year before we stopped speaking, which was over
3438200	3440200	five years ago.
3440200	3442200	And the reason why was a series of compounding factors.
3442200	3445200	This was not one of them, at least to my knowledge.
3445720	3448720	And the truth is, I don't know why I said what I said, or reacted the way I did.
3448720	3452720	If that had happened now, I would not have reacted that way, but even then, I don't
3452720	3456720	know why I was so dismissive offhand about something that I know from my own experience
3456720	3458720	can cause a lot of pain and isolation.
3458720	3463720	And it only came up the one time, was immediately dropped, and we never spoke of it again, and
3463720	3465720	for that reason, I never thought much of it.
3465720	3468720	I didn't consider that she wasn't just kind of saying something off the cuff, but
3468720	3471720	was actually admitting something that she had been considering for a while to someone
3472240	3475240	that she thought would understand, and that person dismissed her.
3475240	3478240	And I didn't even begin to know that this caused any hurt until almost two years after
3478240	3482240	that conversation even happened, because she didn't come out until a few months after
3484240	3488240	Between the two of us, and I cannot express this enough, had nothing to do with this.
3488240	3492240	Like, this is something I feel like I need to press on these so-and-so-is-a-secret-bigot
3492240	3493240	crusaders.
3493240	3497240	Does it occur to you that you can dislike someone without some irreconcilable, ideological
3497240	3498240	differences?
3498760	3501760	This is a personal falling out between two people that has nothing to do with the content
3501760	3502760	we produce.
3502760	3504760	I produce.
3504760	3508760	And I just want to dispel this narrative that, like, someone has to be like the secret bigot
3508760	3513760	or, you know, mask off, or there's always the wronged one and the abuser in one of these
3513760	3517760	falling outs, when it's just like, sometimes people just don't get along, kids.
3517760	3521760	I would love to know why Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice fell out, but it is, at the end
3521760	3525760	of the day, none of my business, and they have made it known, and they have kept the
3526280	3529280	under wraps for almost 40 years, and honestly, good for them.
3529280	3530280	Life goals.
3530280	3534780	And though do trust that this bridge is well and truly forever burned, I do sincerely regret
3534780	3536400	that I reacted the way I did.
3536400	3541280	I think I was probably projecting my own experience with rejection and paying it forward, and
3541280	3542620	I am sorry for that.
3542620	3546600	And no, I shan't be airing any more dirty laundry on this topic, fascinating though
3546600	3547600	it may be.
3549600	3550600	Next.
3551440	3552440	2009.
3552440	3554440	The Rape Rap.
3554440	3556440	Someone made a rape joke.
3556440	3559440	Oh my gooooooo-
3559440	3561440	Someone call the rape joke brigade.
3561440	3564440	Officer, I have an infraction I need to report to the Ministry of Rape Jokes.
3564440	3567440	Look, honestly, I'm shocked that Lindsay Ellis has not been cancelled forever by the rape
3567440	3568440	rap.
3568440	3570440	The zoomers that are cancelling her haven't even discovered the old rape rap she made
3570440	3573440	yet, while very thoughtful that she finally released a Mandarin and Japanese version of
3573440	3575440	the original rape rap.
3577440	3579440	Well, this has been a long time coming, hasn't it?
3580280	3585200	There is this semi-infamous video I did back in 2009, which is called Rape Rap, which is
3585200	3587120	exactly what it sounds like.
3587120	3591980	The joke is that my friend Brian, playing a rapping sexual predator, says horrible things
3591980	3597020	to me online because woman, and I try to get him not to say these things.
3597020	3601080	And honestly, I kind of want to give a slow clap to the diet Nazis because this is a fetch
3601080	3604360	they have been trying to make happen for years.
3604360	3606880	And I'm honestly kind of happy for them, you know?
3607320	3613440	Like, they have used this to hurt me and humiliate me, and they sent it to like PBS affiliate,
3613440	3618560	PBS corporate, trying to get me fired, and they've uploaded like 800 mirrors to YouTube,
3618560	3622800	they've sent it to my colleagues, they've spammed me with it for over a decade, and
3622800	3626400	it just never spread beyond the diet Nazi sphere.
3626400	3631560	And it's finally, finally into the mainstream woke-school Twitter.
3631560	3633880	You know, I'm happy for them.
3633880	3635880	They worked so hard for this.
3635880	3641340	So I know the people adding this to my list of sins are very, very concerned about rape
3641340	3644400	victims, and that's why you're upset by this.
3644400	3647200	So I know you would want to know the context for this.
3647200	3651460	You aren't just thoughtlessly adding this to my ledger to help assuage people's moments
3651460	3655820	of doubt that the harassment against me was, in fact, justified.
3655820	3657320	You care about context.
3657320	3661600	And here's your content warning, so if you don't want to hear this, skip to this time
3661600	3662600	code.
3662600	3665000	We're bringing out the tequila for this one.
3665000	3673760	This isn't even fake tequila.
3673760	3679760	So when I was a sophomore in college, my very first sexual experience with another human
3679760	3682280	being was _____.
3682280	3686320	Big reason why I was vulnerable to this person was _____.
3686320	3690680	So he took me back to his studio apartment and _____.
3690680	3694600	And when I woke up and realized what had happened, I started freaking out.
3694600	3700440	And I remember there being this smell, and so basically he just pushed me out of his
3700440	3704200	apartment and he gave me a $20 bill and just slammed the door in my face.
3704200	3706040	And I mean, what are you going to do?
3706040	3712240	So the $20 bill was enough money exactly for the cab ride home.
3712240	3717760	And then I got a Nesquik, you know, the chocolate milk and a bagel.
3717760	3723480	And then I go upstairs to my dorm room and I like just hork it all up.
3723480	3728080	And then I like take off my clothes and I just like burn the evidence on our gas stove.
3728080	3730200	Like I just like, you know, it was the clothes' fault.
3730200	3733120	I just, my roommate was out of town at the time, so there was nobody.
3733120	3738400	So I just like burn the clothes and burn the evidence and I didn't tell anyone that this
3738400	3739400	happened.
3739400	3740400	So nobody knew.
3740400	3746480	So about one year later, I was at a Dresden Dolls concert, of all things.
3746480	3754280	And I think this was, yeah, this was 2005 and I was there with my roommate and we lived
3754280	3757520	in the West Village and the concert was at Webster Hall.
3757520	3762480	And Webster Hall was about a 15, 20 minute walk from our apartment in the West Village.
3762480	3767840	And we got separated on the way home, you know, because, you know, concert and partying.
3767840	3772320	And normally that's like no big deal because like it's no big deal to get separated from
3772320	3775520	your college roommate for, you know, 10 minutes.
3775520	3786440	But when I get back to our apartment, I find her on the stairwell covered in because by
3786440	3787440	our neighbors.
3787440	3790860	So like literally across the hallway neighbor.
3790860	3793100	So I just like see white.
3793100	3799360	I just like fly into this animal rage and I don't think it was like it couldn't have
3799360	3802300	been more than like five or 10 minutes before the police showed up.
3802300	3804660	And I was like still in full hoke mode.
3804660	3812480	And fortunately, the ambulance showed up before they could take us to jail, as they do.
3812480	3817980	So we went to the hospital and she got a rape kit done.
3817980	3821100	And so now I'm involved with that case.
3821100	3824420	Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
3824420	3830620	All this while, like this whole time, I had not told anybody what had happened to me.
3830820	3835900	I wouldn't actually tell anybody what happened to me for like another, I think it was like
3835900	3836900	another year or two.
3836900	3840980	I think, yeah, it was probably like, yeah, it was like two years later.
3840980	3842620	And of course I didn't do it in a healthy way.
3842620	3845500	I think it was probably, yeah, it was something like this, you know, like, is this healthy?
3845500	3848620	So here's the thing when like something like this happens, you know, and like, you know,
3848620	3852420	there's police involved and police reports and hospitalizations, you know, besides the
3852420	3857860	DA pressuring you out of pressing charges, which is what they did to my roommate.
3857900	3862540	And, you know, I didn't realize that was because, you know, they want to deflate the crime stats
3862540	3867020	in their districts until about 15 years later when Reply All did an episode on that.
3867020	3871180	But the thing is, like, there's a lot of paperwork and like, no, this is relevant.
3871180	3876640	So basically, like, she and I shared this like hanging file, like for all of our paperwork
3876640	3882340	that we had for like various things that were just like, you know, financial aid, you know,
3882340	3886460	essays, college stuff, rape.
3886460	3892940	For the first like few days, it was just this like untouchable, horrible thing that
3892940	3898140	like happened and had to be endured and was just like this pall over both of us.
3898140	3901780	And you know, and this was before the DA pressured her out of pressing charges.
3901780	3907380	And so we had this folder and so like, we just somehow like I asked her like, well,
3907380	3908380	what's in that folder?
3908380	3911460	And she's like, rape.
3911460	3916140	And we kind of like embellished the folder, like with the musical.
3916140	3922220	And it was just like, rape and like, you know, horror font, the musical.
3922220	3926260	And I'm not going to lie and say this like began the process of healing, categorically,
3926260	3927260	it didn't.
3927260	3931340	But you know, it did make the reality of the situation like accessible, you know, joking
3931340	3932820	about it brings it down to earth.
3932820	3936220	It's no longer this like unspeakable horror.
3936220	3942380	And like, you know, if Cora's life is based on mine in any way it is this, NYU's TAs were
3942380	3947500	having a strike that semester, meaning that the undergrads were allowed to drop classes
3947500	3952040	basically up until finals, without penalty or a failing grade.
3952040	3958100	And what happened was that like, that was the only semester where that was an option.
3958100	3963540	And if it weren't for that technicality, where I could drop classes up to finals, I would
3963540	3964540	have failed out of school.
3964540	3967940	I mean, the failing out part is taken from my experience, not the rape part.
3967940	3970020	I didn't I didn't give Cora that tragic backstory.
3970020	3974100	So being just like this one, two punch of horrible things, like I just like I was honestly
3974100	3975100	terrible.
3975100	3979380	Like, I like in so many ways, I went catatonic, I wasn't supportive.
3979380	3984480	And I just don't remember like big chunks of 2005 and 2006.
3984480	3988340	And that sucks because like, I really, you know, treasure a lot of my time and education
3988340	3989500	at NYU.
3989500	3993660	There are just like huge blocks of it that I don't remember.
3993660	3999020	But I do remember this, not long after I graduated a couple years later, Rape the Musical came
3999020	4001420	up in like a different context.
4001420	4006260	And my friends, Brian and Pat, both to this day are, you know, still two of my dearest
4006260	4007260	friends.
4007260	4009940	Brian even officiated my wedding.
4009940	4014060	So Brian had this jacket, which he joked made him look like a flasher.
4014060	4021020	And like, somehow or other, he was like, freestyling these wraps to me and Pat and I, at the time,
4021020	4023300	found them just like hilarious and cathartic.
4023300	4024300	And I was like, you know, keep going.
4024300	4027420	And so we like started workshopping and we're like, oh, let's make a sketch out of this.
4027420	4032620	And I just remember these like lame freestyles while Pat just sat there with this like dead
4032620	4038820	serious expression, not paying attention and just me like dying laughing and like finding
4038820	4040820	it honestly really helpful.
4040820	4043180	And I don't think, like at the time, I don't even think they knew.
4043180	4046080	I think they were just like humoring me.
4046080	4050200	So this was a way of tying in all of this like horrible nonsense that happened to me
4050200	4054860	and my roommate in college with some of the misogynist garbage I was getting as a baby
4054860	4057880	woman on the Internet in 2009.
4057880	4062060	So it was, as the kids say, a cope.
4062060	4067540	Now with regard to this jokey joke little sketch that makes such light of rape, I know
4067540	4068540	what you're thinking.
4068540	4070380	This must be so hard for you.
4070380	4071960	That's so sad for you.
4071960	4074680	That must have been super fucking hard for you.
4074680	4078820	But if this was indeed a copey cope jokey joke between friends, should it not have remained
4078820	4079820	private?
4079820	4082780	Yes, you observing good faith person you it should have.
4082780	4086300	But this was uploaded without my knowledge or permission.
4086300	4089700	Without my consent, you might say.
4089700	4093300	I even blogged about it because at the time I was, of course, getting calls for apologies
4093300	4095660	and I was like, absolutely not.
4095660	4097060	This happened without my permission.
4097060	4100820	And there's an archived link to that blog entry in the description if you vultures want
4100820	4101820	proof.
4101820	4105780	So the way that this happened at all was at the time Channel Awesome controlled all of
4105780	4110120	our individual channels and we didn't upload them ourselves.
4110120	4114160	We uploaded them to an FTP and scheduled them and then someone else uploaded it for
4114160	4115160	us.
4115160	4118960	So when I finished this video, I did still think it was funny, but I also realized that
4118960	4120840	this should never see the light of day.
4120840	4123960	This can be just like a practice run for other sketchy things that we do and should stay
4123960	4128720	a private joke between friends, all the while forgetting that my export folder automatically
4128720	4130720	uploaded directly to this FTP.
4130720	4133480	So months pass, I forgot it was even there.
4133480	4137320	And then one day the guy who ran the schedule, I guess, got annoyed that I kept blowing my
4137320	4142280	deadlines and he was like, fine, I'll just upload whatever's in that FTP folder.
4142280	4146200	But like I started getting these phone calls asking why I scheduled that and I'm like,
4146200	4152080	I didn't take it down, but it was too late.
4152080	4155220	And now here we are.
4155220	4160560	So the Diet Nazis love this video because, you know, they think I'm like this high minded
4160560	4167340	liberal who is like so holier than thou and therefore that this exposes my hypocrisy.
4167340	4172280	And so we can use this to just like torment me and humiliate me and just like constantly
4172280	4173280	like upload it.
4173280	4176840	And like I'll just see it like in my mentions and sometimes they'll send it to like my colleagues
4176840	4180680	or my publisher just to like try to get them to get a reaction.
4180680	4185640	And so now Wokeskull Twitter has discovered it and just mindlessly adds it to my ledger
4185640	4186640	of sins.
4186640	4191600	And so now here we are and I'm having to relive one of the worst times of my life just to
4191600	4194760	get you people to back the fuck off.
4194760	4218880	So like all of you, just these these people who have been trying to get to me with it
4218880	4224680	and think that like me staying silent is an admission of guilt rather than it being none
4224680	4229640	of your fucking business, even considering that this was not supposed to be made public.
4229640	4233560	And now these Wokeskulls are just adding it to like my ledger and trying to use it to
4233560	4235000	discredit me.
4235000	4238580	All of you are just loathsome, loathsome people.
4238580	4246360	And I hope you all...
4246360	4255080	And as I mentioned earlier, this list is non-comprehensive, but...
4255080	4258920	And to everyone out there who is like, you know, well, yeah, but why are you making this
4258920	4261180	all about you?
4261180	4264240	I didn't make this about me.
4264240	4268440	You did.
4268440	4271240	Part five, the tweet.
4271240	4275600	So if this tweet were a video essay that had been researched for months instead of a tweet
4275600	4279840	popped off in a minute, which I never will make, I will never talk about either of these
4279840	4284040	properties again, it would probably be structured something like this.
4284040	4286840	Avatar the Last Airbender was a game changer in a lot of ways.
4286840	4289040	Here are some of the things that influenced it.
4289040	4294360	Shonen anime, Asian folklore, there's a new generation of American writers, many of them
4294360	4297000	people of color who were influenced by it.
4297000	4301240	Anime and young adult literature have changed a lot because of this direct and indirect
4301240	4302240	influence.
4302240	4303560	And honestly, I think that's cool.
4303560	4307560	I think that shows and books are honestly much more interesting for it than that which
4307560	4310680	came before.
4310680	4315960	So with regard to the similarity between these two texts, two big things stuck out to me.
4315960	4321080	One is the element-based co-lead being woken up by Katara after hundreds of years of sleep
4321080	4325880	as the last whatever, now, you know, come on, Aang, we have to go from nation to nation,
4325880	4330360	and in each nation you will acquire a skill until we face down the ding dang dong fire
4330360	4333540	nation what started this whole mess and heal the world.
4333540	4337680	But the thing that stuck out most in my mind as a trend that I've been seeing a lot in
4337680	4343760	animation and YA literature and it's not a bad thing, Jesus, it's what I'm going to call
4343760	4346520	for lack of originality, the Zuko.
4346520	4350400	The princeling of the rival nation who has a lot to prove to their family and who serves
4350400	4355320	as the principal antagonist for a while while our heroes bop from nation to nation and he
4355320	4359040	chases them around but eventually starts to have a change of heart and a redemption
4359040	4360040	arc...
4360040	4368080	Now, the reason I cited like half of YA fantasy, again I did not mean literally half, that
4368080	4375280	was hyperbole, well basically it was because most of the YA fantasy that I had read, because
4375280	4378960	those were, you know, the big names that, you know, I had to read to be hept to the
4378960	4384600	jive that were released in the last few years have Avatar as influences, the most high profile
4384640	4388080	of which being Children of Blood and Bone by Tomi Adeyemi.
4388080	4393560	Now I did enjoy this book and like Raya it also made heavy use of the Zuko and for that
4393560	4398540	reason it was the first thing that popped into my head as being similar to Raya.
4398540	4403080	And yes, Avatar the Last Airbender makes heavy use of Asian and anime tropes but it was the
4403080	4407040	piece of media that popularized a lot of these things in the US.
4407040	4411740	You didn't really see like redemption arcs over several seasons before that and now you
4411740	4413240	see it all the time.
4413240	4419160	Steven Universe does it, the new She-Ra does it, Kipo kind of does it with the frog and
4419160	4420160	the monkey.
4420160	4422280	Okay, I never said the Zuko had to be sexy.
4422280	4424960	And now we have Raya and the Last Dragon.
4424960	4430040	Now if you did read into my tweet that I was dismissing this or saying it was a bad thing,
4430040	4434560	I guess I could understand that read because it wasn't very gracefully worded and it doesn't
4434560	4435560	say anything positive.
4435560	4441000	But it doesn't say anything negative either, it is an inherently neutral statement, it
4441000	4443320	is an observation, it's not even a critique.
4443320	4446560	And so I was like, this is not a dig, ya crazies.
4446560	4451480	And then the line is like, oh, you're calling POC crazy, which is so disingenuous when the
4451480	4455840	vast, vast majority of people losing their shit at me in my mentions were white people
4455840	4458220	projecting their own insecurities at me.
4458220	4463040	Like obviously, ya crazies was a joke, but as a writer and a media critic, it was just
4463040	4469360	so frustrating for me to see people interpreting the comparison of these two things as a dig.
4469360	4472400	Like I was insulting one by comparing it to the other.
4472400	4479440	What is this like CinemaSins brain poisoning thing being similar to other thing not bad?
4479440	4483320	One of the funnest things as a writer you get to do when discussing your book or your
4483320	4488680	media is discussing the influences because ostensibly they are something the author loves
4488680	4490540	and is excited to talk about.
4490540	4496120	So I also saw like a bunch of these like weird low digs like, oh, Axiom's End is so original.
4496120	4500440	Oh, Axiom's End is derivative, like I know that.
4500440	4505740	I have marketed the damn thing on it being inspired by alien invasion movies and TV shows
4505740	4507680	of the 90s and 2000s.
4507680	4511600	There is a reason why I made a bunch of content about those influences in the year leading
4511600	4512600	up to its release.
4512600	4515760	Do you want me to give you a list of them?
4515760	4519960	Everything has influences and Avatar The Last Airbender is one of the most successful and
4519960	4522320	beloved children's shows of all time.
4522320	4526720	As the author Tomi Adeyemi said of Children of Blood and Bone, the book Raya reminded
4526720	4542480	me a lot of, and even one of the screenwriters of Raya has said that although Avatar was
4542480	4547360	not a direct inspiration, we don't shy away from the comparison because it's a beautiful
4547360	4551240	series.
4551240	4555520	No matter how many mental back bends I do, even if you're tired of this take or feel
4555520	4560200	like it's flattening everything inspired by the largest continent on earth, I cannot begin
4560200	4565040	to understand this causing hurt or anguish unless you are reading into it something that
4565040	4571200	I did not say, especially when I'm like the 800th person to make this very milquetoast
4571200	4572420	observation.
4572420	4576440	Screen Junkies had released an Honest Trailer several days earlier making the exact same
4576440	4579640	comparison for the exact same reasons.
4579640	4594840	And look at that dislike ratio.
4594840	4600360	I don't think there is a single video on my entire channel with a dislike ratio that low.
4600360	4604160	I wonder why they didn't get any backlash.
4604160	4608000	I wonder why it could be.
4608000	4609080	Part 6.
4609080	4613240	She Deserved It If Twitter had streets, there would have been
4613240	4615520	dancing in them when I deleted my account.
4615520	4620560	Like Justine Sacco getting fired, like everyone held accountable by an online mob before me,
4620560	4623320	this was taken as a victory by many, many people.
4623320	4626440	And so the problem with making a big thing out of this tweet, which at worst could be
4626440	4631360	considered an unintentional microaggression, made the outraged reaction to it kind of hard
4631360	4632680	to justify.
4632680	4637400	Which is why we need to establish a history of my offenses to bolster their case.
4637400	4639360	And this is where the list of sins comes in.
4639360	4642120	I'm trending on Twitter for like two days.
4642120	4646040	There's all this discourse, so of course people are going to have second thoughts.
4646040	4649640	Like why are so many people talking about this?
4649640	4651160	Maybe this has gotten out of hand.
4651160	4654040	Maybe the backlash wasn't worth the original sin.
4654040	4658580	And here comes Dragon Celeste and hundreds like her like, oh no, don't worry.
4658580	4660240	This is accountability.
4660240	4664680	Here is the long list of sins proving that this is just mask off.
4664680	4666900	She has a long history.
4666940	4669340	How has she not been called out before?
4669340	4673000	I know someone who's met her and they say she's a bad person.
4673000	4677280	So you don't need to feel bad about hounding her because she deserves it.
4677280	4682160	And my God, just the joy people took in this, like seeing me taken down a peg.
4682160	4683660	Good fucking riddance, bitch.
4683660	4684660	Good riddance.
4684660	4685660	Good fucking riddance.
4685660	4686660	Terrible human being.
4686660	4687860	Dislikes Asians too.
4687860	4689860	Y'all getting Lindsay Ellis is beautiful.
4689860	4690860	Don't know shit about her.
4690860	4693300	I can just look at a white person and know they're awful.
4693300	4694500	Can't stand that human being.
4694500	4696060	Glad I won't have to see her tweets.
4696100	4698100	Her takes were so awful and embarrassing.
4698100	4700100	I wouldn't want to be anywhere near her.
4700100	4704100	Fuck Lindsay Ellis and her awful racism and for being a prominent phantom fan when it
4704100	4705100	should be me.
4710640	4711640	But mostly the racism.
4711640	4713180	I hate her and Jenny Nicholson.
4713180	4714940	Serene smiley faces.
4714940	4716300	Lindsay Ellis deleted.
4716300	4720220	People like Lindsay Ellis are finally facing consequences for being atrocious human beings.
4720220	4722380	Lindsay Ellis getting canceled is good, actually.
4722380	4724300	I will die on this fucking hill.
4725300	4728420	What have I done to you?
4728420	4731140	Are you are you rent fans?
4731140	4736520	So many times I've seen people show the damning evidence to others like, see, look at this.
4736520	4741700	Only have the people they're showing it to be like, I don't understand where you're getting
4741700	4742700	this.
4742700	4743780	Is there some context I'm missing?
4743780	4748760	Here is a woman of color doing that very thing to Kat Black, demanding that she answer for
4748760	4751860	sometimes collaborating with such a racist.
4751860	4756100	And Kat basically responded, why the fuck are you demanding that I answer for my white
4756100	4757100	colleagues?
4757100	4758700	Leave her the fuck alone.
4758700	4759980	And this is just the switches.
4759980	4763260	Oh, oh, the joy the diet Nazis took in this.
4763260	4765460	God, they love it when the left eats their own.
4765460	4766960	And why wouldn't they?
4766960	4770100	It's hilarious when your political enemies tear each other apart.
4770100	4774580	I mean, to reiterate, these people have been trying to take me down for years.
4774580	4775580	Keep trying, boys.
4775580	4779280	And part of that joy comes with this justification of what they perceive as someone with real
4779280	4783120	power and wealth and privilege being taken down a peg.
4783120	4788640	It's like this bizarre delusion that I or any of my friends have any real power or influence
4788640	4791520	outside of our very niche corner of the internet.
4791520	4793840	I am not a real celebrity.
4793840	4795920	I almost never get recognized in public.
4795920	4801320	I don't have a PR team or a manager or a stylist or a team of lawyers.
4801320	4808280	Just one very anxious literary agent and one YouTube agent who honestly, he thinks this
4808280	4809280	shit is hilarious.
4809280	4812880	I also kind of miss the diet Nazis because like they at least knew what they were.
4812880	4816480	They weren't harassing me like it was some civil rights campaign that might make the
4816480	4818660	world marginally more just.
4818660	4822240	They were just bullies, plain and simple, and they were proud of it.
4822240	4825160	And you know, honestly, in hindsight, I kind of respect that.
4825160	4831560	At least my mentions being full of like pictures of razor blades and dead animals and Clorox
4831560	4833040	saying, hey, drink this.
4833040	4834480	You know, at least that's honest.
4834480	4838080	I do appreciate that the people making good faith criticisms are not responsible for the
4838080	4843900	people making bad faith criticism or for that matter threats or rejoicing in my downfall.
4843900	4848040	But it is beyond the scope of reasonable to expect me to take all this stimulus.
4848040	4854060	Thousands of people screaming at me from reasonable to sadistic, especially considering everything
4854060	4857760	I've been through in my life and behave like the perfect victim.
4857760	4859760	If you just say the right thing, we'll leave you alone.
4859760	4862740	If you just behave in the way we're asking, we'll make it go away.
4862740	4864960	If you just apologize, we just stop.
4864960	4866440	All she had to do was like, listen.
4866480	4869440	She had a long history of problematic shit and she never listened.
4869440	4870960	She should have done the work to make amends.
4870960	4874280	Maybe next time don't call an entire marginalized group crazy.
4874280	4878480	She's a biphobic, transphobic racist mess who deleted her account rather than apologize
4878480	4879680	for being a piece of shit.
4879680	4882440	She couldn't take actual criticism for people who knew more than she did.
4882440	4886640	Motherfucker, all you had to do was apologize for her white bread take and move on.
4886640	4888560	Deleted her own account then just apologized.
4888560	4890320	Nuked her account instead of apologized.
4890320	4892580	Totally unraveled under the slightest scrutiny.
4892580	4894320	Deleted her account instead of saying I fucked up.
4894320	4895320	Sorry.
4895320	4896320	Why are you so emotional?
4896320	4897320	Why are you so upset?
4897320	4900200	I'm not with the hundreds of people saying you're responsible for hate crimes and mass
4900200	4901200	murder.
4901200	4904440	I'm not one of the people trotting out the obsessive documentation of every misstep you've
4904440	4906240	ever made over the last 15 years.
4906240	4907640	I'm the reasonable one.
4907640	4908640	And I'm calm.
4908640	4909640	Why aren't you calm?
4909640	4911200	Why aren't you addressing this?
4911200	4912200	Why hasn't she apologized?
4912200	4914200	When is she going to apologize?
4914200	4916000	When are you going to apologize?
4916000	4917000	Never Becky.
4917000	4918280	The answer is never.
4918280	4920200	At least not to you.
4920200	4924960	Someone on my subreddit wrote a really thoughtful essay on the whole situation and here is a
4924960	4925960	quote from that.
4925960	4930640	Abuse should always be a part of our analysis and we should be aware every single second
4930640	4934880	that we participate in these conversations that our actions have the potential to excuse
4934880	4936400	or perpetuate abuse.
4936400	4938220	We should take responsibility for that.
4938220	4941040	Take steps to mitigate it and hold ourselves accountable.
4941040	4943720	This is why I have such distrust for the position.
4943720	4945480	Why should I have to talk about abuse?
4945480	4947560	I'm not personally abusing anyone.
4947560	4951280	You should have distrust for that position because that is exactly what they said to
4951280	4953800	me during gamergate.
4953920	4954420	Sucks.
4954420	4955420	Same thing.
4961440	4964940	What follows in campaigns like this is the other isolation tactic.
4964940	4967440	Targeting your colleagues, friends, and loved ones.
4967440	4968800	This comes in two flavors.
4968800	4973520	Demanding that the colleagues of the accused answer for their crimes or trying to deplatform
4973520	4978400	said colleagues because you're already riding high off the previous victory, so who's
4978400	4979400	next?
4979400	4980560	Sara Zett is next.
4980560	4982200	Jenny Nicholson is next.
4982200	4983720	ContraPoints is next.
4983720	4985520	Jenny in par-fucking-ticular.
4985520	4986520	Jenny is next.
4986520	4987520	Jenny, you're next.
4987520	4988520	Jenny, next.
4988520	4989520	Jenny, next.
4989520	4990520	Jenny, next.
4990520	4995320	Both Jenny Nicholson and ContraPoints were trending at certain points during the weekend
4995320	4996320	because of me.
4996320	5001400	Faked screenshots of a racist tweet that Jenny never made spread like wildfire with the goal
5001400	5004820	of getting her driven off of Twitter because of me.
5004820	5008280	And a year and a half ago, the shoe was on the other foot because a lot of the same crowd
5008280	5009900	was attacking Natalie.
5009900	5013420	It must needs be remarked that a huge contingent of the people who have it out for me right
5013420	5019260	now hate me for sticking by Natalie during the Angel Buck incident about 18 months ago.
5019260	5022980	And if you want to know more about that, here's the thingy thingy.
5022980	5027220	And it's really only now that I can make sense of it that I got so many hate follows after
5027220	5031660	that, that people were so eager to screencap anything and everything I said on Twitter,
5031660	5036940	no matter how minor or petty, to create this narrative of me as a secret, horrible person
5036940	5038540	just because I stood up for my friend.
5038540	5039820	And I don't regret doing it.
5039820	5040820	I would do it again.
5040900	5044220	But it is insane that I am paying such a high price for that now.
5044220	5048400	And now my other colleagues are being targeted for no other reason than the crime of being
5048400	5053340	friends with me, for not publicly denouncing me, for not validating their anger.
5053340	5054340	And why?
5054340	5058700	Jenny is one of the smartest, most insightful people I know.
5058700	5062360	Sarah always floors me with how much research and nuance and sensitivity she brings to her
5062360	5063360	topics.
5063360	5065020	And she's only 22.
5065020	5068940	Natalie is, well, she's a whore, but she's my whore.
5068940	5073460	These obsessive campaigns to try to push these narratives of my friends as bad people and
5073460	5077540	secret TERFs and secret racists are just baffling to me.
5077540	5082220	Global fascism is on the rise on a level we haven't seen in more than a generation.
5082220	5087780	Are there not enough out and proud racists that you feel you need to unmask the My Little
5087780	5089100	Pony YouTuber?
5089100	5091820	Jenny next, Jenny next, Jenny next.
5091820	5095940	So do not give me this horseshit about accountability.
5095940	5098580	This is obviously just entertainment to you.
5098580	5100220	Just fucking own it.
5100220	5105700	Obsessively chronicling every perceived misstep we've ever made that could be interpreted
5105700	5110820	badly all while completely ignoring the rest of our entire bodies of work.
5110820	5113160	Why are you wasting so much energy on this?
5113160	5116540	Because you can't impact people who are actually doing your community harm.
5116540	5118060	You can't shame the shameless.
5118060	5119940	Trump will never face justice.
5119940	5122180	Brett Kavanaugh's on the Supreme Court for life.
5122180	5124440	Ben Shapiro gets off on your outrage.
5124440	5126980	So you shame those who can be shamed.
5126980	5130500	And if you call one of us bigoted enough times, people will start to believe it.
5130500	5134980	And then you can feel like you solved racism by spreading lies about a person you have
5134980	5140060	never met and never will and was doing you and your community no harm.
5140060	5141060	Well done.
5141060	5142060	Shabosh.
5142060	5143700	Good job.
5143700	5146740	Fuck every single one of you.
5146740	5149240	You do not deserve grace.
5149240	5155740	You do not deserve sympathy.
5155740	5158140	Part eight, the beast.
5158140	5162700	So obviously, in my case, the easy thing to do would be eat crow and move on.
5162700	5168140	I never would have gotten trending if I hadn't deleted my Twitter account, but I'm not here
5168140	5171480	to say a bunch of shit I don't mean because PR.
5171480	5172540	Fuck PR.
5172540	5174820	You want your precious authenticity?
5174820	5175820	Here it is.
5175820	5179100	There's a danger to normalizing the insincere apology.
5179100	5184260	And if we normalize acting like PR bots and dole out disingenuous apologies whenever they
5184260	5190980	are demanded for any reason, valid or invalid, any harm, real or imagined, then this isn't
5190980	5191980	discourse.
5191980	5193380	This is performance.
5193380	5197520	The reason campaigns like this gain traction is because they prey on communities that try
5197520	5199740	to operate in good faith.
5199740	5204380	They take advantage of people's goodwill and they condition cynicism.
5204380	5206260	So inevitably people harden over.
5206260	5208140	They default to skepticism.
5208140	5213400	Even this fucking woman of color who harangued Kat Black demanding that she answer for collaborating
5213440	5214680	with such a racist?
5214680	5215980	Well, guess what?
5215980	5220720	That person eventually fessed up to being a white man before deleting his account because,
5220720	5223040	you know, listen to POC.
5223040	5227860	People are so obsessed with identity as a rhetorical trump card, you can't even take
5227860	5231280	it on good faith that people are who they say they are anymore.
5231280	5235600	And they take that desire to do right and exploit it because it makes them feel powerful.
5235600	5237560	This is the real mask off.
5237560	5238720	You're next, Jenny.
5238720	5239900	You're next, Sarah.
5239900	5241280	You're next, Natalie.
5241280	5244280	Because running women off Twitter is fun.
5244280	5247000	I mean, accountability.
5247000	5253000	So militantly performing allyship by rooting out corruption like it's the fucking Red Scare,
5253000	5257480	sharing doctored screenshots of tweets that don't exist and willfully misinterpreting
5257480	5263400	things to prove that the My Little Pony YouTuber is a secret racist?
5263400	5266840	Deep down, you know you're just doing it for clout, right?
5266840	5271140	You should be sensitive to marginalized groups and you should be constantly advocating for
5271140	5276900	a more just world and against racism because we all have the stink on us.
5276900	5279760	But that should be the goal in itself.
5279760	5285200	Not performing on Twitter so people can reassure you you're one of the good ones.
5285200	5288420	So you can get max retweets for an awesome dunk.
5288420	5289640	I am not innocent.
5289640	5291100	I have done this.
5291100	5296500	And as content creators, our behavior online turns from due diligence into threat modeling.
5296500	5298460	And I'm not playing this game anymore.
5298500	5303460	Trying to stay 18 steps ahead of the worst possible interpretation of my words or actions
5303460	5305380	isn't taking accountability.
5305380	5307380	It's just self-defense.
5307380	5309720	It's just protecting the brand.
5309720	5314220	And I understand why there is this lingering culture of distrust, especially among communities
5314220	5315220	of color.
5315220	5319220	But it is the height of dishonesty to suggest that the kind of atmosphere where everything
5319220	5322580	is taken in bad faith leads to a more just world.
5322580	5326020	I'm not furious because I'm uniquely wronged.
5326020	5327240	I will be fine.
5327240	5329420	I didn't actually lose anything.
5329420	5335720	I could have pretended nothing happened and probably be better off because nobody cares
5335720	5337940	about the fucking Raya tweet.
5337940	5343080	I'm furious because this keeps happening and we have deluded ourselves into thinking that
5343080	5348960	savaging each other for the smallest transgression and the most minor disagreement is helping
5348960	5350800	right the wrongs of the world.
5350800	5354920	That there's this broad refusal to admit that our systems that operate on good faith are
5354920	5356800	very often abused.
5356800	5360380	I was going to include a section about other people from more marginalized groups than
5360380	5366260	me who are held to an even higher standard of purity, who have lost way more than I have
5366260	5369120	for equally minor perceived transgressions.
5369120	5373500	But you know, you probably already know some and they probably don't want me using their
5373500	5374500	names anyway.
5374500	5377960	But I feel like I need to impress that I didn't start getting noticeable harassment from the
5377960	5383300	Purity Tester Brigade until I stood up for a trans woman on Twitter over, and I cannot
5383300	5388040	express this enough, a situation that did not deserve anything approaching the level
5388040	5390180	of outrage that it fostered.
5390180	5395620	And that backlash did not come from the alt-right or even the diet Nazis, but our own community.
5395620	5398520	Our side.
5398520	5399520	This is why they win.
5399520	5401740	A friend of mine named it The Beast.
5401740	5405280	The name for this fear that we all live under but don't acknowledge.
5405280	5409820	And over the last few years, I have had so many of my colleagues, all of them women,
5409820	5414560	people of color, trans people, queer people, or some combination of the above, voice to
5414560	5419360	me the constant anxiety that they live with about maybe saying something wrong that will
5419360	5421940	get them on the bad side of their own communities.
5421940	5424000	Every thought is a hostage situation.
5424000	5426260	Is this the tweet that's going to sink me?
5426260	5427540	So what do we call it?
5427540	5431900	What is the name for this unspoken, unacknowledged culture of fear where we all know that one
5431900	5434060	misstep can ruin our lives?
5434060	5438980	This social media culture where we participate in the public shaming one day and become chained
5439020	5440340	to the pillory the next.
5440340	5443140	We can't even talk about it because The Beast does not have a name.
5443140	5446900	If we admit that this is a problem, then the right will just take it and run with it and
5446900	5449120	use it to increase their own power.
5449120	5450660	Same as they did with cancel.
5450660	5452200	Same as they did with woke.
5452200	5453620	Same as they did with fake news.
5453620	5455580	If it has a name, then it has power.
5455580	5458440	So it is a discussion that cannot be had.
5458440	5459660	And so we do not have it.
5459660	5463540	We say cancel culture doesn't exist and ignore this disease.
5463540	5465940	Pretend it isn't doing real harm.
5465940	5470120	Not just to individuals who are targeted, but to the state of discourse in general.
5470120	5474780	And especially to individuals in marginalized groups, because they are always held to the
5474780	5478860	highest standard of purity and they always have the most to lose.
5478860	5481900	It isn't even about saying something tone-deaf or insensitive.
5481900	5487340	A mere difference in opinion might get you fired from your job if enough people raise
5487340	5488660	a stink about it.
5488660	5491720	And just so we're clear, I'm not really even talking about me.
5491720	5493380	I will be fine.
5493380	5498460	But living under the shadow of the beast makes it hard to just create at all.
5498460	5504260	A big factor in why it takes us so long to do a single video is threat modeling.
5504260	5509020	Because god forbid you say something mildly positive about one of the bad ones that you
5509020	5511160	did not know were bad.
5511160	5516060	So much of the work we do is getting ahead of any potential misstep by adding like 1800
5516060	5519560	caveats and acknowledgments and it's never enough.
5519560	5523340	Angelina and I were collaborating with fellow author and essayist Jeanette Ng on a video
5523340	5527560	about the live-action Mulan that Jeanette was co-writing and was going to co-host.
5527560	5532280	And we'd been working on it for months and right after this happened I was like, we have
5532280	5533720	to scrap this video.
5533720	5536340	But then after a few days I was like, for what?
5536340	5541000	Because a bunch of Twitter teens are gonna call me a racist for criticizing a movie nobody
5541000	5542000	likes?
5542000	5543400	Y'all were gonna do that either way.
5543400	5548020	Believe me, I know that this video is not going to change any minds.
5548020	5553340	It's going to make a lot of people very angry and I hope they get lots of engagement.
5553340	5554620	I hope they see.
5554620	5557020	I wish you all of the retweets.
5557020	5558540	But I can't stay ahead of it anymore.
5558540	5563380	I'm not going to do the performance of avoiding offense, of staying 500 steps ahead of everything
5563380	5566260	that might be misread or misinterpreted.
5566260	5570020	Not because it's the right thing to do, but just to protect my brand.
5570020	5571020	Fuck my brand.
5571020	5574180	I will do the due diligence, but I'm done with threat modeling.
5574180	5575420	I just don't care anymore.
5575420	5580160	If you want to read bigoted dog whistles into everything I say, go with God.
5580160	5585880	If you want to pass my list of sins to everyone who so much as mentions me in a positive way,
5585880	5587660	I hope it brings you peace.
5587660	5592580	If you want to speculate on my private life, I hope it brings you much profit.
5592580	5595360	I hope you accrue much social capital.
5595360	5598920	I personally choose to take a page from the book of my political enemies.
5598920	5603940	You can't shame the shameless, so I'm going to use the term cancel in its original vernacular
5603940	5604940	meeting.
5605460	5609440	I'm canceling shame, and I will fuck with shame no more forever.
5609440	5613460	So if anything, thank you for liberating me from giving a fuck.
5618160	5619460	Part 9.
5619460	5620460	What Now?
5620460	5625860	I want to acknowledge that I got dozens if not hundreds of messages of support in private
5625860	5628500	through Patreon, Instagram, and email.
5628500	5634340	And while not all of them were 100% you did nothing wrong, I would be remiss not to acknowledge
5634340	5635340	that.
5635340	5638140	Some of them genuinely made me cry with how kind they were.
5638140	5643060	Even some of the ones who were critical of what I said were done with a sense of empathy.
5643060	5648300	And I'm sorry I didn't respond to most of you, but just know I read all of your messages.
5648300	5651820	And friendly reminder, I will be fine.
5651820	5652820	Until my liver gives out.
5652820	5656080	This is like the 800th time something like this has happened to me.
5656080	5657600	But am I done with Twitter?
5657600	5658980	Basically, yeah.
5658980	5663220	I honestly intended to be forever done with Twitter, but I was then reminded that I am
5663220	5667340	contractually obligated to promote my books through social.
5667340	5671140	Contractually obligated pre-order link for my second book in the description.
5671140	5676420	So I'll still use it for that sort of thing, and I will continue using it to promote smaller
5676420	5681540	creators and authors when I find something that I think deserve attention.
5681540	5683740	And also shameless nepotism.
5683740	5685260	People calling me a nepotist.
5685260	5687260	How dare you say a thing that is true?
5687260	5692460	But my biggest mistake was using Twitter in the way that a lot of my friends who had way
5692460	5694420	fewer followers than me did.
5694420	5699180	Like yeah, I can be a little edgy, I can make jokey jokes, I can just be, you know, I can
5699180	5701780	be like one of the boys.
5701780	5704500	And I should have stopped doing that a long time ago.
5704500	5708620	Worse, Twitter is just a recipe for both addiction and misery.
5708620	5711020	They call it doomscrolling for a reason.
5711020	5715760	Like even in the last couple weeks, I feel like my brain is having to rewire just this
5715760	5718340	impulse to constantly be checking Twitter.
5718340	5720380	And it was making me a shittier person.
5720380	5724100	I was getting in fights with people more and more, I was dunking on people more and
5724100	5727540	more, I was clapping back at followers more and more.
5727540	5730140	Like one other person I owe an apology to is Moviebob.
5730140	5734780	I told him on Twitter to leave me alone because he was acting like a creep by being over-familiar
5734780	5739980	and continually signaling to the world that we're friends, and he was acting like a creep
5739980	5741460	and we're not friends.
5741460	5745260	But I would have never done that if I had known that the diet Nazis were gonna turn
5745260	5746260	that into a meme.
5746260	5750200	Like I don't like a lot of what he says on Twitter either, but please stop using my face
5750200	5752280	to torture this man, leave him alone.
5752280	5755660	So at its core, this was a wakeup call.
5755660	5758800	And that is why I deleted my account.
5758800	5761520	Part and it can happen to you.
5761520	5766640	I want to reaffirm that the roots of this do stem from a rise in anti-Asian racism,
5766640	5769020	and that racism is very real.
5769020	5773600	As I was writing this video, a friend of mine on Facebook posted a screencap of this truly
5773600	5779280	heinous thing that Mike Huckabee said, which not only regurgitates this inane conservative
5779280	5785040	garbage about identity politics, it completely dismisses the very real wave of hate that
5785040	5786880	is happening in America right now.
5786880	5791960	And he posted it with this comment, white people, please pay attention every day.
5791960	5797360	A person of color has to look at something like this or worse every literal day.
5797360	5798360	Try.
5798360	5801440	Just try to imagine what that would do to your psyche.
5801440	5803040	And it hurt to read.
5803040	5808200	And honestly, it hurts for me to even read out loud right now because it's true.
5808240	5811040	I literally only can imagine.
5811040	5816220	Few of the people stoking anti-Asian violence right now will suffer consequences and probably
5816220	5818520	more racist attacks will occur.
5818520	5824800	And this is just another chapter in our country's long, sad history of anti-Asian racism.
5824800	5829620	And the reality is there's not a lot we as individuals can do about that.
5829620	5832420	We live in a fundamentally unjust world.
5832420	5834120	I do acknowledge that.
5834120	5838280	And at the beginning, anyway, a lot of the frustration at the original tweet did stem
5838280	5839280	from that.
5839280	5842600	And I don't want to dismiss all public feedback as inevitably harassment.
5842600	5847640	I think it's important to retain this nuance, lest we always frame the issue of harassment
5847640	5850920	as a blanket condemnation of the public and public feedback.
5850920	5854900	But I also cannot stress enough how quickly this whole situation went from valid criticism
5854900	5861360	rooted in real hurt to straight up abuse and not just of me, of my friends, my colleagues,
5861360	5866280	this disease that is Twitter enacting the same passion play again and again and again.
5866280	5870240	Even people who were sympathetic to me, they still wanted to attribute the hate to one
5870240	5876120	thing, you know, one slip of the tongue, one bad take, one wrong affiliation, one wrong
5876120	5877120	tone I took.
5877120	5883540	I've seen so many people try to rationalize it even when they think I did nothing wrong.
5883540	5888100	But the reality is what gets you on the radar of the mob is nothing.
5888100	5894660	A picture, a joke, a comment, just existing as a woman, a person of color, a woman of
5894660	5901540	color, a queer person doing your job, one unpopular opinion, a poorly aged take, being
5901540	5906700	online for too long, being associated with the wrong person, saying something nice about
5906700	5908220	the wrong person.
5908220	5911040	Sometimes all it takes is being successful.
5911040	5914560	People want to rationalize your mistakes and list them and label them not because it has
5914560	5917100	anything ultimately to do with you.
5917100	5918360	It doesn't.
5918360	5922820	But because they want to reassure themselves that it will never happen to them, that it
5922820	5925140	will never be them on the pillory.
5925140	5929100	So even if you don't think I did anything wrong, if you can still pin this on a specific
5929100	5933280	error, then you can distance yourself and sleep well that you would know better than
5933280	5935100	to make the same mistake.
5935100	5936720	And it would never happen to you.
5936720	5938500	And that's just not how it works.
5938500	5943340	Part of what makes Twitter so toxic is the sense of hopelessness it engenders.
5943340	5948500	You're exposed to this never-ending stream of bad news and constant examples of how fucked
5948500	5954020	the world is and reminders that you have the power to affect very little change.
5954020	5958240	That compounded with the fact that platforms like Twitter rely mostly on shorthand and
5958240	5962500	are constantly encouraging you to produce and encourage knee-jerk reactions with very
5962500	5967540	little context means that hopelessness and powerlessness and aggression, it's got to
5967540	5968760	go somewhere.
5968760	5972380	And on March 26, 2021, it got funneled to me.
5972380	5977620	And I cannot in good faith say I have not done the same, mindlessly joined in on a dog
5977620	5982560	pile on someone who said something stupid or insensitive because it felt good.
5982560	5985600	And for a brief moment, it gave me a sense of power.
5985600	5989140	But then that moment is gone and the world is still shitty.
5989140	5994300	And that person's life, whatever their infraction was, deserved or undeserved, is marginally
5994300	5997180	worse for my involvement in it.
5997180	5999140	And that is why I'm stepping away.
5999140	6003860	So for all of the people who used me as their outlet for their pain and aggression on that
6003860	6009660	crisp spring morn, I understand that you feel hopeless and powerless in an increasingly
6009660	6011360	shitty world.
6011360	6016180	And I understand that there is a reason to assume bad faith when so many other people
6016180	6018060	have let you down.
6018060	6025100	And the only thing I can do for you is extend the same grace and compassion that you extended
6025100	6025600	to me.
6029140	6031140	Thank you.
