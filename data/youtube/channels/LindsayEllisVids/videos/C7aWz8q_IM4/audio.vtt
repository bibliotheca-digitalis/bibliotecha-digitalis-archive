00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
So, last week I was in a restaurant in North Carolina and we were sitting at the bar and

00:08.000 --> 00:11.560
the owner was sitting right there because they were about to close and my mother starts

00:11.560 --> 00:15.800
talking to her and somehow or other the owner just looks at me and she's like, well, what

00:15.800 --> 00:16.800
do you do?

00:16.800 --> 00:22.600
And, you know, I wasn't about to tell her I'm a YouTuber, so I was like, I'm a writer.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.960
I mean, I am technically.

00:24.960 --> 00:25.960
And she's like, well, what do you do?

00:25.960 --> 00:29.920
So, I told her my name and she's like, I'm going to Google you and I was like, okay,

00:29.920 --> 00:31.920
I'm super canceled right now.

00:31.920 --> 00:36.220
And she like laughed and clearly thought I was kidding or maybe didn't know what that

00:36.220 --> 00:39.480
meant or, you know, knew it in some like right wing way.

00:39.480 --> 00:43.520
And then she like Googled me and like started laughing because the first thing and, you

00:43.520 --> 00:49.000
know, like the questions people ask is, why is Lindsay Ellis canceled?

00:49.000 --> 00:51.740
And I mean, why indeed?

00:51.740 --> 00:54.120
But before I get into this, I need to lay some groundwork.

00:54.120 --> 00:57.160
Ladies and boomers of the jury, here you go.

00:57.200 --> 01:01.680
Shaming is a public shaming of a member of a community for some violation of that community

01:01.680 --> 01:04.780
standards by other members of that community.

01:04.780 --> 01:09.700
But the term actually originated with a 1981 song called Your Love is Canceled by the band

01:09.700 --> 01:10.700
Chic.

01:10.700 --> 01:14.560
The song was inspired by a bad date guitarist Niall Richards went on at the height of the

01:14.560 --> 01:20.040
band's success wherein his date behaved in a way that he felt was presumptuous and unacceptable,

01:20.040 --> 01:21.320
which really turned him off.

01:21.320 --> 01:28.200
Your love is canceled No, your love is canceled

01:28.200 --> 01:32.440
So basically, it was inspired by this idea of any potential future we might have had

01:32.440 --> 01:35.540
any potential love that might have developed canceled.

01:35.540 --> 01:40.020
The song was not a hit at the time, but it stuck around and over the decades, the term

01:40.020 --> 01:44.760
as used in the song started appearing in other pieces of art and music, including in songs

01:44.760 --> 01:50.160
by rappers like 50 Cent and Lou Wayne until eventually gaining popularity in the vernacular

01:50.160 --> 01:51.180
of black Twitter.

01:51.180 --> 01:56.460
In this original vernacular use, declaring someone or something canceled was not really

01:56.460 --> 02:02.140
an attempt to like instigate a boycott or hold someone to account, but more of a personal

02:02.140 --> 02:07.460
decision, not unlike Chic's original song, canceling them in the television of your mind.

02:07.460 --> 02:10.440
So to cancel someone wasn't a call to deplatform.

02:10.440 --> 02:14.940
It was more just saying, you stepped out of line, so I'm done with you.

02:14.940 --> 02:20.100
Like when the city of New York canceled Mayor de Blasio for eating pizza with fork and knife,

02:20.100 --> 02:22.680
which to be fair is the only reason to criticize the man.

02:22.680 --> 02:26.220
The connotation of this term with call outs and deplatforming didn't happen until a few

02:26.220 --> 02:31.120
years ago as Me Too began and call outs did lead to some powerful people actually losing

02:31.120 --> 02:32.120
things.

02:32.120 --> 02:36.800
According to Washington Post writer Clyde McGrady, as call outs led to greater consequences,

02:36.800 --> 02:40.580
some people became nervous about how social media had changed power dynamics in the court

02:40.580 --> 02:42.140
of public opinion.

02:42.140 --> 02:46.140
Cancel culture was the diagnosis and the term became a catch all defense for those trying

02:46.140 --> 02:48.820
to evade public criticism of any kind.

02:48.820 --> 02:54.260
But now cancel is just another word that white people have taken and run into the ground.

02:54.260 --> 03:00.620
So like woke before it, it has gone from AAV vernacular to right wing grievance buzzword,

03:00.620 --> 03:03.000
which is more or less where we are today.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.300
Pretty quickly and we are now seeing wokeism and diversity and inclusion.

03:08.300 --> 03:12.580
This is just the cancel culture and I will tell you, the people at home should be scared

03:12.580 --> 03:16.500
because their ballgame is next, their business will be next.

03:16.500 --> 03:21.380
If it continues, it won't just be Republicans who get cancelled, it won't just be the president

03:21.380 --> 03:23.180
of the United States.

03:23.180 --> 03:25.100
The cancel culture will come for us all.

03:25.100 --> 03:28.900
So I have a lot that I want to unpack here because I've had a bit of an ordeal that

03:28.900 --> 03:34.060
led to me realizing that I was bad for Twitter and Twitter was bad for me.

03:34.060 --> 03:36.180
And so I deleted my account.

03:36.180 --> 03:40.340
And for some dumb fucking reason, the fact that I deleted my Twitter account not only

03:40.340 --> 03:44.980
made like actual news, my name was trending for several days.

03:44.980 --> 03:49.860
Is this another video about canceling or worse, the dreaded apology video?

03:49.860 --> 03:52.780
Like do these people not realize I'm not a real celebrity?

03:52.780 --> 03:59.420
I'm the number 21,000th ish most subscribed channel on YouTube and I've published all

03:59.420 --> 04:03.740
of one book that only reached number seven on the New York Times list, but it did hit

04:03.740 --> 04:04.900
the New York Times list.

04:04.900 --> 04:08.540
So we'll get into why in a minute, but like I'm neither going to go full Andrew Cuomo,

04:08.540 --> 04:12.600
pew pew, I'm being canceled by multiple credible allegations.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.360
You're never going to be president, Andy.

04:14.360 --> 04:19.280
Or full crying apology video, though those do seem to be good for business.

04:19.280 --> 04:26.040
And I just ask that you press pause for a moment and even just for 10 seconds, just

04:26.040 --> 04:31.280
cover this in prayer because there is so much healing that needs to take place.

04:31.280 --> 04:32.280
Some of the time.

04:32.280 --> 04:33.280
No, sir.

04:33.280 --> 04:37.860
I've decided to do the one thing Americans should never do and vote third party.

04:37.860 --> 04:40.180
It's been a long time since we've done a list, hasn't it?

04:40.180 --> 04:44.380
So here we go.

04:44.380 --> 04:50.660
List part one, Twitter is garbage in the halcyon days of the early 2010s.

04:50.660 --> 04:55.940
Justine Sacco was a PR executive who traveled often for work and not having many Twitter

04:55.940 --> 05:00.900
followers herself often tweeted pity little nothings, which on the morning of December

05:00.900 --> 05:07.060
20th, 2013, as she was boarding a flight at Heathrow for a work trip included this tweet

05:07.060 --> 05:08.060
going to Africa.

05:08.060 --> 05:09.700
Hope I don't get AIDS.

05:10.220 --> 05:11.220
Just kidding.

05:11.220 --> 05:12.220
I'm white.

05:17.420 --> 05:21.420
Okay, so on its face, this is pretty inexcusable.

05:21.420 --> 05:25.740
It didn't take long for the tweet to catch the eye of Sam Biddle, then an editor at Gawker

05:25.740 --> 05:28.580
Media, whose signal boosted it with a comment.

05:28.580 --> 05:32.420
And now a funny holiday joke from IAC's new PR boss.

05:32.420 --> 05:36.100
The flight from Heathrow to Cape Town was 11 hours.

05:36.220 --> 05:42.540
And in that 11 hours, attention to this tweet spread like wildfire, incredulity, horror,

05:42.540 --> 05:46.280
disgust, and also very quickly, glee, excitement.

05:46.280 --> 05:51.020
Sacco had less than 200 followers and being on a plane with no internet, didn't know that

05:51.020 --> 05:56.440
she was Twitter's villain of the day, nor that she was one of the top trends worldwide.

05:56.440 --> 06:01.160
So there was a delicious irony to the fact that this woman had been canceled and didn't

06:01.160 --> 06:02.160
even know it.

06:02.160 --> 06:07.000
She had her flight number, tracked it obsessively, were just thrilled with this idea that she

06:07.000 --> 06:10.840
was going to land, and realized she had been found out.

06:10.840 --> 06:14.580
The hashtag has Justine landed yet also began to trend.

06:14.580 --> 06:19.200
Someone even went to the Cape Town airport when she landed, took a picture of her, and

06:19.200 --> 06:21.040
shared it with the rest of the world.

06:24.880 --> 06:29.880
A few months later, upon being asked why it appealed to him, Sam Biddle said of the incident,

06:29.880 --> 06:33.140
The fact that she was a PR chief made it delicious.

06:33.140 --> 06:38.560
It's satisfying to be able to say, okay, let's make a racist tweet by a senior IAC employee

06:38.560 --> 06:39.900
count this time.

06:39.900 --> 06:40.900
And it did.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.040
I'd do it again.

06:42.040 --> 06:46.300
But while people of course gleefully obsessed over the tweet, no one seems interested in

06:46.300 --> 06:49.360
why she said it or what she meant by it.

06:49.360 --> 06:51.380
No matter how you cut it, it's a bad look.

06:51.380 --> 06:53.760
It's a flagrant flaunting of privilege.

06:53.760 --> 06:59.800
So it's funny that she got fired and I mean, I'm not gonna, she had it bad for a while.

06:59.840 --> 07:06.060
And like, I don't want to speculate on exactly how ruined her life was, but it would also

07:06.060 --> 07:10.480
be reasonable to assume that this is a joke about white privilege, right?

07:10.480 --> 07:14.680
That it was bad and insensitive and made light of a terrible affliction that still kills

07:14.680 --> 07:19.160
thousands of people every day, but that she didn't mean it literally.

07:19.160 --> 07:22.420
And at the time, everyone involved seemed to think that of course she deserved to have

07:22.420 --> 07:27.640
her life ruined over it, even if they understood it was a joke about white privilege.

07:27.640 --> 07:31.680
Christine Sacco's family in South Africa were African National Congress supporters,

07:31.680 --> 07:33.400
the party of Nelson Mandela.

07:33.400 --> 07:36.360
They were long-time activists for racial equality.

07:36.360 --> 07:41.600
So while I can't read her original intent, perhaps she felt worldly enough and enough

07:41.600 --> 07:46.040
in the club and enough of an ally that she could comfortably make such a joke and that

07:46.040 --> 07:47.680
it would be understood.

07:47.680 --> 07:51.920
White people do this a lot and I cannot say I am not guilty of this too.

07:51.920 --> 07:56.880
A year later, Sacco said to Jon Ronson, author of So You've Been Publicly Shamed,

07:56.880 --> 08:01.920
To me it was so insane of a comment for anyone to make, I thought there was no way that anyone

08:01.920 --> 08:03.800
could possibly think it was literal.

08:03.800 --> 08:07.760
Living in America puts us in a bit of a bubble when it comes to what is going on in the third

08:07.760 --> 08:08.760
world.

08:08.760 --> 08:10.400
I was making fun of that bubble.

08:10.400 --> 08:14.520
While also conceding, I had no business commenting on the epidemic in such a politically incorrect

08:14.520 --> 08:16.720
manner on such a public platform.

08:16.720 --> 08:21.120
Biddle got caught up in his own shitstorm when he tweeted the following in 2014.

08:21.120 --> 08:25.480
And you'll never guess who was mad on the internet in 2014.

08:25.480 --> 08:29.480
Ultimately, Gamergate is reaffirming what we've known to be true for decades.

08:29.480 --> 08:32.600
Nerds should be constantly shamed and degraded into submission.

08:32.600 --> 08:36.480
Then adding, bring back bullying.

08:36.480 --> 08:38.840
I was there, man.

08:38.840 --> 08:41.280
Bold of you to provoke them like that.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.640
Well, you can guess what happened.

08:42.640 --> 08:47.300
There was a massive campaign against him, some from obvious bad faith right wing trolls,

08:47.300 --> 08:53.400
but some who seemed to think that he literally was advocating for a return to the 1950s where

08:53.400 --> 08:57.040
dumping books of dorky middle schoolers was de rigueur.

08:57.040 --> 09:02.100
Biddle publicly apologized to Sacco on the anniversary of her, well, it wasn't called

09:02.100 --> 09:07.700
canceling yet, Twitter-wide dog pile, let's call it, writing,

09:07.700 --> 09:11.560
Twitter is a fast machine that almost begs for misunderstanding and misconstrual.

09:11.560 --> 09:13.660
Deliberate misreading is its lubricant.

09:13.660 --> 09:17.760
The same flatness of affect that can make it such a weird and funny place also makes

09:17.760 --> 09:19.780
it a tricky and dangerous one.

09:19.780 --> 09:21.200
Jokes are complicated.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.560
Context is hard.

09:22.560 --> 09:23.560
Rage is easy.

09:23.560 --> 09:28.960
By this point, they had actually become friends, and comparing their experiences, he said,

09:28.960 --> 09:31.440
structurally, we had made the same sort of joke.

09:31.440 --> 09:35.480
Here is what a truly horrible person, a person whose attitudes were entirely opposite from

09:35.480 --> 09:38.240
mine and those of the people who know me, would say.

09:38.240 --> 09:42.700
You could argue that hers was worse, conjuring a real and pernicious attitude that had resulted

09:42.700 --> 09:47.240
in systemic historical oppression and mass death, but the impulse was the same, and so

09:47.240 --> 09:48.600
were the reactions.

09:48.640 --> 09:52.760
So even though there's a disconnect between the intended interpretation and the actual

09:52.760 --> 09:57.400
interpretation, there's also a disconnect between the severity of the crime and the

09:57.400 --> 10:03.300
gleeful savagery of the punishment, and this is not relegated to the early 2010s, it happens

10:03.300 --> 10:04.860
now more than ever.

10:04.860 --> 10:07.360
Twitter always has a villain of the day.

10:07.360 --> 10:13.600
Before me, it was shrimp bean dad, I don't know, something something milkshake duck.

10:13.600 --> 10:14.920
God, am I a milkshake duck?

10:14.920 --> 10:17.560
I feel like I'm too old to be a milkshake duck.

10:17.560 --> 10:19.680
I've been around too long to be a milkshake duck, right?

10:19.680 --> 10:23.720
To a certain extent, the villain of the day almost follows a script, especially now that

10:23.720 --> 10:28.080
we've all been losing our minds because we've all been inside for a year doing nothing but

10:28.080 --> 10:29.780
looking at our phones.

10:29.780 --> 10:35.400
Person says dumb thing, it gets some attention, person gets defensive, the defensiveness spurns

10:35.400 --> 10:42.900
outrage, people start coming out with receipts, the OP deletes their account...

10:42.940 --> 10:48.540
And Twitter is garbage because the user experience, UX as they call it in the industry, is designed

10:48.540 --> 10:54.380
to encourage this kind of behavior, it's engagement, fast and emotional and satisfying, and easily

10:54.380 --> 10:55.380
forgotten.

10:55.380 --> 10:59.500
Communication through Twitter often happens through shorthand, micro-interactions that

10:59.500 --> 11:05.560
fit a limited number of predetermined narratives and scripts because you're exposed to thousands

11:05.560 --> 11:10.780
of these per day, which is why we have these Twitter script phrases such as, wow, this

11:10.780 --> 11:16.780
blew up, friendly reminder, casual reminder, mask off, I don't know who needs to hear

11:16.780 --> 11:21.800
this, but thank you for coming to my TED talk, should have stayed in the drafts, read the

11:21.800 --> 11:26.900
room, I'm trying to see something, I'll just leave this here, asking for a friend,

11:26.900 --> 11:29.020
send tweet, the list goes on.

11:29.020 --> 11:33.220
And the way it provokes rage in dogpiles is baked into the way the very platform itself

11:33.220 --> 11:34.220
is designed.

11:34.220 --> 11:40.280
Twitter as a company has a really big problem where outside of its user base, its reputation

11:40.280 --> 11:45.960
is quite bad, and it hasn't really seen an increase in active users in years.

11:45.960 --> 11:50.280
When a site hits its peak in terms of total active accounts, there is still capitalist

11:50.280 --> 11:55.980
pressure to increase value and profit, a shrinking pool of eyes plus a need to increase revenue

11:55.980 --> 12:00.480
equals a service that needs to squeeze more blood from the same stones.

12:00.480 --> 12:05.000
So every UX decision is geared towards increasing time spent with eyes on the screen.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.540
That's why they've developed non-chronological timelines, tweets that get added to your feed

12:09.540 --> 12:15.300
by virtue of other people liking them, goddamn fucking quote tweets, and so on.

12:15.300 --> 12:19.220
Twitter is designed quite literally to be addictive, they aren't getting new users,

12:19.220 --> 12:22.840
so they have to keep the ones who are there from logging off.

12:22.840 --> 12:26.340
Twitter wants you to post, and it wants you to boost, and it wants you to engage, so it

12:26.340 --> 12:31.160
will put as few barriers between the user and engagement action as possible.

12:31.160 --> 12:34.540
So with all that in mind, it's no wonder that among the many pre-written shorthand

12:34.540 --> 12:39.140
Twitter scripts, Twitter's villain of the day is even a thing, and that it's a common

12:39.140 --> 12:44.900
truism on Twitter that the only goal is not to become the villain of the day.

12:44.900 --> 12:48.420
The unspoken understanding that it can be anyone if they're not careful.

12:48.420 --> 12:50.900
It'll happen to you.

12:50.900 --> 12:58.300
No way man, we're gonna keep on rockin' forever, forever, forever, forever, forever.

12:58.300 --> 13:02.940
Engagement is often driven by outrage, and so we have this combination of high emotionality

13:02.940 --> 13:04.740
with a desire to perform.

13:04.740 --> 13:09.260
Social media is designed to manipulate our desire for approval, and a part of that these

13:09.260 --> 13:12.460
days is the desire to perform allyship.

13:12.460 --> 13:16.680
White people in particular all want to be told they're one of the good ones.

13:16.680 --> 13:20.580
Which is why people like Justine Sacco gained such attention in the first place.

13:20.580 --> 13:26.500
In a fundamentally unjust world, it's satisfying to take a cosseted bigot down a peg.

13:26.500 --> 13:32.060
So if we can only get one more wrong-headed bigoted head on a pike, humiliate one more

13:32.060 --> 13:38.580
blackface steward, or one more appropriative food blogger, we could heal this world.

13:38.580 --> 13:43.660
And inevitably, it was my turn, because I cannot shut the fuck up on Twitter.

13:43.660 --> 13:49.740
On Friday, March 26th, 2021, I was Twitter's villain of the day.

13:49.740 --> 13:54.300
So for those of you who haven't yet seen my offending tweet, let's have it, my Justine

13:54.300 --> 13:55.300
Sacco moment.

13:55.300 --> 13:58.020
Are you ready to see why mommies cancel?

13:58.020 --> 14:01.620
Also watched Raya and the Last Dragon, and I think we need to come up with a name for

14:01.620 --> 14:05.420
this genre that is basically Avatar The Last Airbender reduxes.

14:05.420 --> 14:10.100
It's like half of all YA fantasy published in the last few years anyway.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.300
That's it.

14:11.300 --> 14:16.340
That's the tweet.

14:16.340 --> 14:18.540
So I imagine some of you are very confused.

14:18.540 --> 14:21.040
Part two, valid criticism.

14:21.040 --> 14:26.420
So from what I can tell, the whole thing originated when some Southeast Asian artists and animators

14:26.420 --> 14:32.060
read the tweet as being dismissive and reductive and implying all Asian inspired things are

14:32.060 --> 14:34.140
the same genre.

14:34.140 --> 14:37.500
And to me, it was made even more frustrating by the fact that several of the people who

14:37.500 --> 14:40.900
started this hadn't even seen the movie.

14:40.900 --> 14:44.160
In fact, most people who were getting involved with this conversation hadn't even seen the

14:44.160 --> 14:45.160
dragon movie.

14:45.160 --> 14:47.780
It looks like no one saw the dragon movie, but here's the thing.

14:47.780 --> 14:53.480
I kind of had my own has Justine landed yet experience by popping off the tweet, reading

14:53.480 --> 14:59.320
a few responses who understood where I was getting at going to bed and it blew up while

14:59.320 --> 15:01.080
I was asleep.

15:01.080 --> 15:03.160
Hashtag has Lindsay woken up yet?

15:03.160 --> 15:08.120
And because by the time I woke up, I'd already gotten a few like, Oh my God, are you okay?

15:08.120 --> 15:11.720
messages from friends before I even opened Twitter.

15:11.720 --> 15:16.660
By the time I looked at my timeline, I saw very little that I would consider valid criticism.

15:16.660 --> 15:22.020
So I feel like I need to establish that this whole thing stopped being about valid criticism

15:22.020 --> 15:24.140
very, very quickly.

15:24.140 --> 15:26.700
And I'll talk about that later in the video.

15:26.700 --> 15:31.700
But by the time I woke up, it had already blown way past this is a careless display

15:31.700 --> 15:37.660
of white privilege to this sort of thing as a contributing factor to the mass murder of

15:37.660 --> 15:43.980
Asian women that just happened.

15:43.980 --> 15:48.140
So this is what we call an overstatement of harm.

15:48.140 --> 15:55.200
It had gone from possible insensitive microaggression from a C-list YouTuber to contributing to

15:55.200 --> 15:56.620
hate crimes.

15:56.620 --> 16:00.000
And that didn't feel like anything I would consider valid.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.900
So it's, you know, early in the morning, I just woke up and I responded with frustration

16:04.900 --> 16:10.260
because I was being ascribed an intentionality, which was not there, which, well, if anyone

16:10.260 --> 16:14.260
who spent any time on Twitter can tell you, getting defensive and doubling down is about

16:14.260 --> 16:16.160
the last thing anyone should do.

16:16.160 --> 16:18.600
So that was an oopsie.

16:18.600 --> 16:24.160
And I tried to give, you know, some credence to the valid criticism by saying, like, you

16:24.160 --> 16:26.960
know, if you squint, I can kind of see what you're saying.

16:26.960 --> 16:33.040
And God damn it.

16:33.040 --> 16:34.280
It was like, it was early.

16:34.280 --> 16:38.920
I went like it was like, you shouldn't tweet in the morning.

16:38.920 --> 16:40.320
You shouldn't tweet at all.

16:40.320 --> 16:41.320
You shouldn't tweet.

16:41.320 --> 16:42.320
Nobody should tweet.

16:42.320 --> 16:46.080
So that very poorly worded frustration was met with even more outrage that I was not

16:46.080 --> 16:52.560
taking in to be valid critique of POC when I am too busy being bowled down by mountains

16:52.560 --> 16:57.800
of hyperbole and this word racist over and over and over, which is bound to make anyone

16:57.800 --> 16:59.320
a little bit defensive.

16:59.320 --> 17:03.440
So when all of these things are coming at you, it's impossible to genuinely consider

17:03.440 --> 17:08.520
actually valid critique in a timely fashion because your defenses are at a hundred.

17:08.520 --> 17:12.920
And when I'm being accused by hundreds of people of contributing to anti Asian American

17:12.920 --> 17:18.980
hate crimes by saying that the Disney thing reminded me of the Nickelodeon thing, it's

17:18.980 --> 17:24.040
honestly kind of stunning to me that any reasonable person would expect someone in my position

17:24.040 --> 17:30.040
to take in all of these hundreds of tweets, process them reasonably, and within minutes

17:30.040 --> 17:36.340
be like, hmm, yes, I see your point, reasonable ones, because I am able to parse you out from

17:36.340 --> 17:39.760
the people saying I'm responsible for hate crimes.

17:39.760 --> 17:44.340
Now before we go forward, it must be acknowledged that being any person of color in the United

17:44.340 --> 17:51.720
States right now is just to be constantly worn down in a million tiny ways every day

17:51.720 --> 17:57.240
all the time by a society that is low key shitty.

17:57.240 --> 17:58.600
High key shitty.

17:58.600 --> 17:59.600
It's shitty.

17:59.600 --> 18:02.940
These critiques don't come from nothing and there are issues both in the film industry

18:02.940 --> 18:06.800
and the culture at large that is making people hyper vigilant.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.760
I'm not going to follow that with a however.

18:08.760 --> 18:14.320
I just want to lay that groundwork and acknowledge that.

18:14.320 --> 18:16.680
Part three, white nonsense.

18:16.680 --> 18:21.080
I know that's not the most PC way of saying that, but I have many, many white friends,

18:21.080 --> 18:23.120
so I'm allowed to say that.

18:23.120 --> 18:28.840
So in the case of this tweet, I went to bed morning on the East Coast and you know, there

18:28.840 --> 18:35.040
was some discourse by people who, you know, had some valid upset and the nations all live

18:35.040 --> 18:39.160
together in harmony until the whites attacked.

18:39.160 --> 18:44.920
Because a common refrain of these valid criticisms were that I was ignoring POC voices and talking

18:44.920 --> 18:51.400
over POC voices, but the vast, vast majority of the avalanche of angry I was getting was

18:51.400 --> 18:52.920
from white people.

18:52.920 --> 19:02.400
Not all, but definitely, at least in terms of the extremely hyperbolic ones, the majority.

19:02.400 --> 19:06.800
White people, come here, come here.

19:06.800 --> 19:07.800
We need to have a chat.

19:07.800 --> 19:11.440
I think maybe we need to admit that those of us on the progressive side of the fence,

19:11.440 --> 19:15.160
as it were, are feeling kind of under pressure these days.

19:15.160 --> 19:19.400
We are horrified by the racial injustice of the world, especially in the US.

19:19.400 --> 19:24.360
We feel the need to perform action, but aren't really presented with very many opportunities

19:24.360 --> 19:25.600
to do so.

19:25.600 --> 19:31.080
My friend and PBS co-host Princess Weeks remarked during another stupider Twitter thing that

19:31.080 --> 19:37.520
happened a few weeks prior about fanfiction ethics.

19:37.520 --> 19:40.840
Actually it's about ethics and fanfiction.

19:40.840 --> 19:45.280
It deeply amuses me when people treat shipping, pro and anti, with so much political importance

19:45.280 --> 19:49.300
when they literally apply that to nothing else, and to remove all nuance and context,

19:49.300 --> 19:53.840
to share fake quotes and facts, to perpetuate harm in order to own people, over the right

19:53.840 --> 19:55.400
for two white people to kiss.

19:55.400 --> 20:00.360
When you marginalize really queer BIPOC and marginalized people, for what?

20:00.360 --> 20:05.640
In other words, often white progressives cite black voices when in service of your...

20:05.640 --> 20:10.660
well, in this case, ship.

20:10.660 --> 20:11.660
It was Hannibal.

20:11.660 --> 20:14.720
Oh my god, this is so stupid.

20:14.720 --> 20:18.000
You're interested in black voices when it's in the service of pwning another white person

20:18.000 --> 20:23.200
or white creator, whomst you disagree with, but show little interest for issues or advocacy

20:23.200 --> 20:29.000
that actually concern black voices in their community, independent of said pwnage, only

20:29.000 --> 20:33.880
to immediately be told, you're not a real queer little girl, you privileged little twat

20:33.880 --> 20:37.120
by a white lady about 15 minutes later.

20:37.120 --> 20:40.960
To be clear, this discussion was about fanfiction.

20:40.960 --> 20:46.400
This was about pretend people kissing, pretendly.

20:46.400 --> 20:52.440
So I saw a lot of mealy-mouthed smug nothing about do better and listen to POC.

20:52.440 --> 20:53.440
Always listen to POC.

20:53.440 --> 20:55.680
Why aren't you listening to POC?

20:55.680 --> 20:58.560
Elevate POC voices, always.

20:59.560 --> 21:00.560
Okay.

21:05.560 --> 21:06.560
Whomst.

21:06.560 --> 21:11.760
Whomst is the valid person of color, oh allies of the jury, because I did listen to a lot

21:11.760 --> 21:18.000
of POC, both in public and in private, and I gotta tell ya, there's a diversity of opinions,

21:18.000 --> 21:20.560
almost like people of color aren't a monolith.

21:20.560 --> 21:25.360
Marginalized communities are not without diversity or conflict, so treating it as such is totally

21:25.360 --> 21:31.320
reductive and ignoring other POC voices by centering the loudest or angriest as the most

21:31.320 --> 21:32.320
authoritative.

21:32.320 --> 21:39.080
A problem only compounded by the way Twitter is designed, which I have already argued,

21:39.080 --> 21:40.080
is bad.

21:40.080 --> 21:45.080
As I was going back and forth over the timeline and everything that had happened, I found

21:45.080 --> 21:52.560
this private message from fellow YouTuber who I have to disclose is half Vietnamese

21:52.560 --> 21:56.840
because this is irrelevant, and he said I'm trying not to say anything I'm going to regret

21:56.840 --> 22:01.440
here, but I have very little respect for the people dogpiling me and mine in the defense

22:01.440 --> 22:06.120
of a typically derivative corporate product from the biggest media company in the West

22:06.120 --> 22:10.200
because two of its seven writers and zero of its directors were Asian.

22:10.200 --> 22:14.720
This in private, of course, because, you know, you didn't want to get harassed.

22:14.720 --> 22:16.920
Privileged twat.

22:16.920 --> 22:22.120
So I find the listen to POC refrain, because it's only trotted out in the service of white

22:22.120 --> 22:28.240
people pwning other white people very revealing because what they mean is listen to the POC

22:28.240 --> 22:30.800
we can use to pwn someone else.

22:30.800 --> 22:32.720
But the POC we don't agree with?

22:32.720 --> 22:33.720
Privileged twat.

22:33.720 --> 22:39.560
But note this hilarious exchange between two white people arguing over my riot tweet.

22:39.560 --> 22:44.960
When pressed on what exactly it is I need to admit wrongdoing for, this woman says,

22:44.960 --> 22:50.400
again, you're just another white woman talking over actual POC concerns.

22:50.400 --> 22:55.800
I love this exchange because this person, one of the shit billion white people mindlessly

22:55.800 --> 23:01.480
regurgitating this listen to POC shorthand, the very same person who called Princess a

23:01.480 --> 23:02.740
privileged twat.

23:02.740 --> 23:08.880
You're not a real queer little girl.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.200
Princess's law in action.

23:10.200 --> 23:15.340
There's this incredibly childish dichotomy with the way a lot of people discuss racism,

23:15.340 --> 23:21.020
that there are the racists and the non-racists, the two genders.

23:21.020 --> 23:27.340
And the way to solve racism is to root out the racists and cast them onto racist island,

23:27.340 --> 23:32.400
away from me and mine, the non-racists, one of the good ones.

23:32.400 --> 23:36.120
They do this because they are insecure about their own internalized racism.

23:36.120 --> 23:38.540
They cannot conceive that they have any.

23:38.540 --> 23:42.320
That thought is terrifying to them because a racist is the worst thing you can be.

23:42.320 --> 23:47.000
So instead of doing any introspection, they remain hypervigilant to root out the secret

23:47.000 --> 23:54.780
bad people so everyone else will know they're one of the good ones.

23:54.780 --> 24:00.680
Racism is a complex system upheld from all wings of our society, from laws to hiring

24:00.680 --> 24:06.560
practices to generational wealth to community redlining to internal biases to individual

24:06.560 --> 24:08.260
actions.

24:08.260 --> 24:10.620
We live in a white supremacist society.

24:10.620 --> 24:14.060
When you live in a pigpen, you're gonna get covered in shit.

24:14.060 --> 24:16.060
And all of us have the stink on us.

24:16.060 --> 24:17.940
And I don't just mean the whites.

24:17.940 --> 24:18.940
All of you.

24:18.940 --> 24:19.940
Blocked.

24:19.940 --> 24:20.940
Blocked.

24:20.940 --> 24:21.940
Blocked.

24:21.940 --> 24:23.620
None of you are free from sin.

24:23.620 --> 24:24.700
But especially the whites.

24:24.700 --> 24:31.420
And yet people still have this like, Elby the racist dragon attitude about how racism

24:31.420 --> 24:32.420
works.

24:32.420 --> 24:34.420
Why are you crying so?

24:34.420 --> 24:39.420
I'm crying because all of those horrible villagers chased me into this scary cave.

24:39.420 --> 24:43.500
I think it's because I'm so racist.

24:43.500 --> 24:46.300
Get your hand off my tail, you'll make it dirty.

24:46.300 --> 24:51.740
Racism isn't a system perpetuated by many, many things, including actions, but a character

24:51.740 --> 24:56.140
trait, a disease that people try to hide from the world because they know if they're found

24:56.140 --> 24:59.580
out, they'll get banished to racist island.

24:59.580 --> 25:03.900
And suddenly, he wasn't racist anymore.

25:03.900 --> 25:08.240
While there are still, of course, racist hate crimes and the like, most general displays

25:08.240 --> 25:14.960
of racism don't come out of grand, like cross burning style gestures, but out of ignorance,

25:14.960 --> 25:16.840
carelessness or negligence.

25:16.840 --> 25:21.160
And for white people, a lot of it is just the reality of benefiting from a system designed

25:21.160 --> 25:22.340
to privilege you.

25:22.340 --> 25:26.460
So I'm not going to waste my breath on the I'm not a racist line of defense.

25:26.460 --> 25:28.320
I'm a white woman from Tennessee.

25:28.320 --> 25:31.480
My family is mostly uneducated white trash.

25:31.480 --> 25:34.560
I'm not going to be like, yeah, I didn't internalize any of that.

25:34.560 --> 25:35.560
I'm special.

25:35.800 --> 25:38.920
I shot out of the womb unscathed.

25:38.920 --> 25:41.040
We all have the stink on us.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.960
Yes, even you.

25:43.960 --> 25:48.680
The reason I bring this up is because another thing that happened after that tweet was the

25:48.680 --> 25:51.080
sharing of the receipts.

25:51.080 --> 25:55.840
Thousands of people passing around screen caps of tweets and videos and blog entries

25:55.840 --> 26:00.920
and anecdotes from my personal life, proving that this was not just a one off.

26:00.920 --> 26:04.040
Oh, no, I have a long history.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.040
It was high time.

26:05.040 --> 26:07.320
I was banished to racist island.

26:07.320 --> 26:13.120
And it's true, I do have a long history of being on the Internet longer than pretty much

26:13.120 --> 26:16.760
all of you statistically, probably.

26:16.760 --> 26:22.060
And there is a list of sins floating around Twitter carefully and obsessively curated

26:22.060 --> 26:24.960
over a period of 13 years.

26:24.960 --> 26:25.960
Amazing.

26:25.960 --> 26:27.560
Is it because there's a pandemic?

26:27.560 --> 26:29.900
Where do you guys get all this free time?

26:29.900 --> 26:34.740
So I've been accused of a lot of terrible things and remanded for never owning up to

26:34.740 --> 26:35.740
my mistakes.

26:35.740 --> 26:38.660
Well, today is your day, receipt keepers.

26:38.660 --> 26:41.960
You guys have worked so, so hard on this.

26:41.960 --> 26:45.020
So I am going to give you what you asked for.

26:45.020 --> 26:50.740
Finally, all that hard work meticulously coming through every word I've ever said is going

26:50.740 --> 26:52.740
to pay off.

26:52.740 --> 26:57.180
Well, that that's what you wanted, wasn't it?

26:57.180 --> 26:59.980
Part four, my list of sins.

27:05.740 --> 27:09.500
You weren't prepared for this to turn into a drama channel, were you?

27:09.500 --> 27:10.500
Yeah, maybe you were.

27:10.500 --> 27:14.020
I mean, this is just what happens when they break your spirit utterly.

27:14.020 --> 27:19.560
So a big part of my, you know, self-preservation strategy over the years is to explain myself

27:19.560 --> 27:23.060
as little as possible, because, you know, if you do that, it's already a losing game

27:23.060 --> 27:26.020
and rarely, if ever, talk about my personal life.

27:26.020 --> 27:28.460
Clearly, a big mistake on my part.

27:28.460 --> 27:30.780
Well, today we are turning the page.

27:30.780 --> 27:33.260
We are spilling the tea.

27:33.260 --> 27:34.260
The whiskey.

27:34.780 --> 27:38.060
I knew I was saving this for a special occasion.

27:38.060 --> 27:39.060
Technically, whatever.

27:39.060 --> 27:40.820
Got my, got my deception.

27:40.820 --> 27:42.820
I haven't used this one in a while.

27:42.820 --> 27:43.820
Oh, God.

27:43.820 --> 27:44.820
Yeah, I really haven't used this in a while.

27:44.820 --> 27:50.080
So take a shot every time Lindsay Ellis does a problematic.

27:50.080 --> 27:56.980
So a common refrain during that weekend where I was trending was party A says Lindsay did

27:56.980 --> 28:00.760
a racism and party B's like, well, what did she do?

28:00.760 --> 28:05.400
Party A would show the tweet and party B would be like, I don't get it.

28:05.400 --> 28:06.720
This doesn't seem like a big deal.

28:06.720 --> 28:11.760
And then party A would be like, ah, no, she has a long history of problematic.

28:11.760 --> 28:14.040
And party B is like, ah, I get it now.

28:14.040 --> 28:16.800
And then they skip off together into the sunset.

28:16.800 --> 28:23.440
Twitter user Dragon Lady Celeste Sparkle has conveniently collated my long storied history

28:23.440 --> 28:28.880
of all my other sins that explain why the Raya thing was just a mask off moment.

28:28.880 --> 28:34.820
And I deserve this, actually, a very good and normal thing to do with your finite minutes

28:34.820 --> 28:36.820
on this earth.

28:36.820 --> 28:39.760
Take down that YouTuber.

28:39.760 --> 28:40.760
Take her down.

28:40.760 --> 28:44.960
Literally, all day, people have been replying to my tweet with more and more examples of

28:44.960 --> 28:48.980
truly harmful rhetoric that Ellie has been pushing for a while.

28:48.980 --> 28:53.120
And all I can say is how the fuck has she not been called out on a mass scale before?

28:53.120 --> 28:56.760
Well, Dragon Sparkle Celeste, she has.

28:56.800 --> 28:59.600
She just never deleted her Twitter account before.

28:59.600 --> 29:00.820
Actually, no, that's not true.

29:00.820 --> 29:04.720
Last time I deleted my Twitter account, I didn't trend because I guess I wasn't, you

29:04.720 --> 29:11.560
know, number 21,000 on the subscribed YouTube channel by that point.

29:11.560 --> 29:16.680
But the last time I deleted my account, it was because of the, you know, white genocide

29:16.680 --> 29:17.920
crowd.

29:17.920 --> 29:20.680
So I guess that's something you have in common.

29:20.680 --> 29:24.200
I don't get why I'm like so hated by both sides of the political fence.

29:24.240 --> 29:29.480
I don't I don't think I'm like interesting enough to like gather this much attention

29:29.480 --> 29:30.480
or emotion.

29:30.480 --> 29:33.480
I drive a Honda Civic like Jesus.

29:33.480 --> 29:38.800
So thank you for compiling it in one convenient thread.

29:38.800 --> 29:39.800
Makes my job easier.

29:39.800 --> 29:44.000
Now, the problem with this not at all creepy and obsessive list of every single one of

29:44.000 --> 29:49.500
my perceived transgressions over a period of 13 years is that it does not include the

29:49.500 --> 29:51.360
times when I have addressed them.

29:51.560 --> 29:56.200
But, you know, I'm sure they just, you know, forgot to screen cap those tweets slash blog

29:56.200 --> 30:01.400
posts slash streams slash videos, et cetera, you know, because this list is in such good

30:01.400 --> 30:05.480
faith.

30:05.480 --> 30:10.360
Nor does it incorporate any of my entire body of work, which I don't know, doesn't count

30:10.360 --> 30:14.020
apparently because, you know, the list of sins is the real me and the other stuff I

30:14.020 --> 30:16.680
do is for profit or something.

30:16.680 --> 30:20.480
So there's like a jillion of these grievances and, you know, this video is already like

30:20.600 --> 30:21.600
12 eternities long.

30:21.600 --> 30:26.760
So believe it or not, what I am about to address is non-comprehensive because there are a lot

30:26.760 --> 30:32.400
of people who were really, really dedicated to, you know, mask off.

30:32.400 --> 30:33.920
And credit to where it's due.

30:33.920 --> 30:38.680
This was spearheaded by the, you know, leftist Twitter.

30:38.680 --> 30:41.880
But again, a lot of these receipts originated with the right wing.

30:41.880 --> 30:45.320
I don't even want to call them alt-right, you know, because they're not that principled,

30:45.320 --> 30:51.160
you know, like more, more like, you know, gamergate refugees, the fortune for the lulz

30:51.160 --> 30:54.120
crowd, diet Nazis, let's call them.

30:54.120 --> 30:59.280
So some of this is, as many of you have noted, extremely bad faith interpretations of statements,

30:59.280 --> 31:03.600
which only makes sense if you are working backwards from a foregone conclusion.

31:03.600 --> 31:08.040
That said, I don't want this to be taken as me saying that I have never done anything

31:08.040 --> 31:09.040
wrong.

31:09.040 --> 31:10.940
Unambiguously, I have.

31:10.940 --> 31:12.620
We all make mistakes.

31:12.620 --> 31:17.820
So where I feel like an amendment or an apology is warranted, I will do so.

31:17.820 --> 31:22.660
But where I feel like the criticism is being made in bad faith, is unreasonable, or is

31:22.660 --> 31:26.120
flat out untrue, I shan't bend the knee.

31:26.120 --> 31:31.740
Because we here at Lindsay Ellis Industries are not in the business of serving bullshit.

31:31.740 --> 31:39.780
So I got my bell of shame here, and as the Black Eyed Peas would say, let's get it started.

31:42.620 --> 31:48.020
2020 Harriet Tubman fanfic.

31:48.020 --> 31:56.380
This one is, like, really popular.

31:56.380 --> 32:02.580
So the narrative here is that because of this tweet, I ship Harriet Tubman with her enslaver,

32:02.580 --> 32:05.220
and I want there to be fanfic of it.

32:05.220 --> 32:08.840
I'm just saying, you have to be giving this a very weird read in order to think that's

32:08.840 --> 32:09.840
what I meant.

32:09.840 --> 32:15.240
But I'm also going to go out on a limb and assume that most of the people mad about this

32:15.240 --> 32:18.180
have not seen the Harriet Tubman movie.

32:18.180 --> 32:22.580
Or if they have, are not familiar with her real history.

32:22.580 --> 32:26.980
So the central conflict of the film revolves around Harriet's relationship to her enslaver,

32:26.980 --> 32:31.760
a twinkie blonde guy named Gideon, played by Taylor Swift's thin boyfriend.

32:31.760 --> 32:36.420
They are around the same age, they basically grow up together, and early in the film he's

32:36.420 --> 32:41.040
framed somewhat sympathetically until he propositions her, demands her submission and

32:41.040 --> 32:45.800
fealty, which of course she refuses, and then when she escapes he becomes obsessed with

32:45.800 --> 32:50.160
recapturing her, and he is the central antagonist of the entire film.

32:50.160 --> 32:53.720
But here's the thing about Gideon, he never existed.

32:53.720 --> 32:56.240
He was completely made up for the film.

32:56.240 --> 33:02.200
Harriet Tubman's IRL enslaver at the time of her escape was a woman, but instead of

33:02.200 --> 33:06.300
having the film center more around Harriet's journey after she got away from the Brodess

33:06.300 --> 33:12.420
family, it instead creates this character in the form of Taylor Swift's boyfriend as

33:12.420 --> 33:19.300
the antagonist, a man who, and I cannot express this enough, did not exist in real life.

33:19.300 --> 33:26.340
So basically the film creates an OC that is like super obsessed with recapturing her in

33:26.340 --> 33:31.780
a movie where Harriet Tubman also has superpowers.

33:31.780 --> 33:33.640
It just felt a little fanfic-y to me.

33:33.640 --> 33:38.460
And so one day I was on an airplane and the person next to me was watching it, and I just

33:38.460 --> 33:43.560
kind of started wondering why the filmmakers decided to go that route with the film creatively,

33:43.560 --> 33:47.020
because again it just kind of felt weird to me.

33:47.020 --> 33:53.440
Like you know, the final showdown in the film is between Harriet and Gideon in a forest

33:53.440 --> 33:58.480
that to me was somewhat evocative of the last showdown in The Force Awakens, and this was

33:58.480 --> 34:03.700
also kind of like at the height of this sort of thing, this tendency to fanficify historical

34:03.700 --> 34:06.680
figures that was partially enabled by Hamilton.

34:06.680 --> 34:12.280
So I just kind of idly have this thought like, oh man, I wonder if this movie spurned fic

34:12.280 --> 34:17.080
of these two characters, oh god, actually I'm not going to check because I don't want

34:17.080 --> 34:18.080
to know.

34:18.080 --> 34:22.020
Usually I don't really check my mentions, so I didn't see any anger when I tweeted that.

34:22.020 --> 34:26.220
Only a few days later when screen caps started circling, and then I got some white women

34:26.220 --> 34:31.780
in my DMs demanding that I do better and apologize, specifically not to them but to

34:31.780 --> 34:34.260
all of my black fans that I hurt.

34:34.260 --> 34:38.500
So like an hour after I tweeted it, I was like, hmm, I better take this down because

34:38.500 --> 34:42.900
this is the sort of thing that someone could take out of context in bad faith.

34:42.900 --> 34:44.300
Welp.

34:44.300 --> 34:49.560
So the reason I never addressed this is because like the read of that tweet in itself of me

34:49.560 --> 34:56.320
being thirsty for Harriet Gideon fanfic was just so absurd, I didn't know what to say.

34:56.320 --> 34:59.720
Now to be clear, no, I should not have tweeted that at all.

34:59.720 --> 35:05.120
I was thinking in terms of the creative decision to create Gideon being kind of tone deaf,

35:05.120 --> 35:10.360
but the pithy way that I tweeted it still ostensibly glosses over the reality of white

35:10.360 --> 35:15.760
owners sexually abusing their slaves being the historical norm, and that is in itself

35:15.760 --> 35:17.540
disrespectful.

35:17.540 --> 35:21.680
So while I definitely did not mean what people seem to think I meant, I definitely should

35:21.680 --> 35:22.940
not have said that.

35:22.940 --> 35:27.460
I was, as the kids say, showing my ass.

35:27.460 --> 35:33.500
Next, 2009 autistic temper tantrum.

35:33.500 --> 35:37.740
Boy, I had to go way back for this one.

35:37.740 --> 35:41.100
People wonder why I privated all of my old videos.

35:41.100 --> 35:47.300
So I was in film school at the time, and my class was 80% male, and you know, some of

35:47.300 --> 35:49.620
them had a Friday sense of humor.

35:49.620 --> 35:54.740
And while I was talking about this movie, Beauty and the Beast, The Enchanted Christmas,

35:54.740 --> 35:59.580
one of them made this remark about how the beast and I just kind of mindlessly regurgitated

35:59.580 --> 36:00.580
it.

36:00.580 --> 36:01.580
Beast shape.

36:01.580 --> 36:05.820
I'm going to throw an autistic temper tantrum because I was with an edgy boy website at

36:05.820 --> 36:08.900
the time and I wanted to demonstrate that I wasn't like the other girls.

36:08.900 --> 36:11.460
I was a cool edgy boy.

36:11.460 --> 36:12.940
It was insensitive and careless.

36:12.940 --> 36:16.020
I definitely should not have said that.

36:16.740 --> 36:21.580
Next, 2013, The Prince of Egypt anti-Semitism.

36:21.580 --> 36:26.020
God, I just, I can't, I can't believe somebody kept this for so long.

36:26.020 --> 36:27.020
I'm just, I'm sorry.

36:27.020 --> 36:29.820
This is just, this took so much dedication.

36:29.820 --> 36:36.020
So the qualm here is that I did an anti-Semitism because I don't like the way the Prince of

36:36.020 --> 36:41.540
Egypt, you know, functionally excuses the mass slaughter of innocent children in the

36:41.540 --> 36:45.700
narrative, you know, because the book of Exodus frames it as a necessary evil.

36:46.380 --> 36:48.980
And yeah, I just, I don't really care for the Prince of Egypt.

36:48.980 --> 36:52.220
And I just don't think the book of Exodus works as a kid's movie.

36:52.220 --> 36:56.220
Because it's a kid's movie, it has to frame the protagonists as understandable and relatable

36:56.220 --> 37:01.220
to modern family audiences and frame what happens in the book of Exodus as, you know,

37:01.220 --> 37:04.220
all fine and good in the framework of the movie.

37:04.220 --> 37:08.900
Even when the good guys do some light, you know, mass slaughter.

37:08.900 --> 37:12.740
That tenth plague, man, it's a doozy.

37:12.780 --> 37:16.980
I remember when we got to Exodus in Sunday school and, you know, when it got to the part

37:16.980 --> 37:21.420
of the wailing and lamentations of the Egyptian women, you know, when they woke up and there

37:21.420 --> 37:26.780
were dead children, like even at the age of five, I was like, it was pretty fucked up.

37:26.780 --> 37:32.300
So my thought process here is that we take for granted the morality of narratives of

37:32.300 --> 37:37.900
biblical texts because we grew up with them and they just kind of have so much informed

37:37.900 --> 37:42.620
our cultural framework, when if a story like this existed independent of the Bible, it

37:42.620 --> 37:45.380
would probably be considered pretty messed up.

37:45.380 --> 37:48.600
Especially considering how the movie frames it as all Pharaoh's fault because he's such

37:48.600 --> 37:50.580
a stubborn jerk.

37:54.580 --> 37:57.580
Rameses, you bring this upon yourself.

37:57.580 --> 38:00.680
Like at least in the Bible, God keeps hardening his heart.

38:00.680 --> 38:04.940
And the other thing is like in the way that the film progresses, it's really funny to

38:04.940 --> 38:09.940
me when you're like mass slaughter of children happens, Pharaoh Ralph Fiennes is weeping over

38:09.940 --> 38:16.940
the corpse of his only son and then Val Kilmoses morosely peaces out and then bam, miracles.

38:23.940 --> 38:28.380
I mean, I guess in a matter of speaking, the 10th plague is a miracle.

38:28.380 --> 38:31.140
And this is not to say you can't make a modern movie about the Bible.

38:31.140 --> 38:33.060
I actually really liked Noah.

38:33.060 --> 38:37.740
It's easily my favorite Darren Aronofsky movie because it leans in hard on how fucked up

38:37.740 --> 38:42.460
and traumatic it would be to have to sit back and, you know, watch and listen while every

38:42.460 --> 38:46.340
other human on earth dies, you know, because God said so.

38:46.340 --> 38:48.340
They are just people.

38:48.340 --> 38:50.340
There is room.

38:50.340 --> 38:52.340
There is no room for them.

38:56.940 --> 39:00.380
But this is also an example of me using Twitter to feel out other people's opinions before

39:00.380 --> 39:03.540
I do video content, a thing I will never do again.

39:03.540 --> 39:06.180
A lot of people were like, yeah, but you know, this movie means a lot to me.

39:06.620 --> 39:09.620
And, you know, a lot of that is because of like my religion or my culture.

39:09.620 --> 39:13.620
And that was when I decided I was not ever going to touch this movie as a topic for a video.

39:13.620 --> 39:17.500
And in the context of this thread, I shouldn't have used the word genocide, considering it's

39:17.500 --> 39:19.380
a film about Jewish characters.

39:19.380 --> 39:20.380
And for that, I do apologize.

39:20.380 --> 39:25.140
Like, I don't think I'd be making the world a better place by talking about why I don't

39:25.140 --> 39:29.900
think the Prince of Egypt works because I don't feel that strongly about it.

39:29.900 --> 39:31.700
It's not a big deal.

39:31.700 --> 39:35.820
I'm not really here for thing you like is bad actually content for its own sake, although

39:35.820 --> 39:38.700
I love how every tweet in this thread has trigger warnings.

39:38.700 --> 39:39.700
Trigger warning.

39:39.700 --> 39:40.700
She didn't like the Prince of Egypt.

39:40.700 --> 39:41.700
Next.

39:41.700 --> 39:42.700
2013.

39:42.700 --> 39:43.700
Charlie's Angels niqab.

39:43.700 --> 39:51.380
This is another one I've addressed a few times, most recently on a live stream a few years

39:51.380 --> 39:55.940
ago where we rewatched it and had a high old time laughing about what a comical example

39:55.940 --> 39:59.580
of early 2010s white feminism this was.

39:59.580 --> 40:00.580
You know what, guys?

40:00.580 --> 40:01.580
I'm sorry.

40:01.580 --> 40:02.580
I'm calling it.

40:02.580 --> 40:03.580
Feminism is over.

40:03.580 --> 40:04.580
I'm sorry.

40:04.580 --> 40:05.580
I'm sorry.

40:05.580 --> 40:06.580
I tried.

40:06.580 --> 40:07.580
We did our best.

40:07.580 --> 40:08.580
But it's our feminism, too.

40:08.580 --> 40:09.580
We should get in it for everyone.

40:09.580 --> 40:14.580
I'm not sick of the go make me a sandwich jokes.

40:14.580 --> 40:16.900
Why do we even have that lever?

40:16.900 --> 40:20.420
Yeah, so not gonna lie, this one's pretty bad.

40:20.420 --> 40:24.180
This whole thing came about when I was on Twitter one day talking about doing a video

40:24.180 --> 40:27.700
on Charlie's Angels and trying to think of like how visually to dress myself that was

40:27.700 --> 40:30.140
like the opposite of Charlie's Angels.

40:30.140 --> 40:34.020
And someone on Twitter was like, hey, you should do it in a burqa with like pigtails

40:34.020 --> 40:35.020
poking out.

40:35.020 --> 40:36.740
And I thought that idea was funny.

40:36.740 --> 40:37.740
It's too confusing.

40:37.740 --> 40:38.740
We don't know what we want.

40:38.740 --> 40:42.700
It is apparently way too much to ask that women like either have a certain body type

40:42.700 --> 40:45.000
or dress a certain way without being judged for it.

40:45.000 --> 40:50.460
So two options, burqa or slut.

40:50.460 --> 40:51.460
That's not burqa.

40:51.460 --> 40:52.460
And that's a false dichotomy.

40:52.460 --> 40:56.760
And even at the time, several of my Muslim followers were like, please do not do this.

40:56.760 --> 40:59.460
This is a bad idea.

40:59.460 --> 41:01.060
And OK, so this is not excusing it.

41:01.060 --> 41:02.060
But here is some context.

41:02.100 --> 41:06.940
So at the time, my next door neighbor was an Egyptian expat named Hajar.

41:06.940 --> 41:11.960
And she was slash is a full niqabi, meaning whenever she goes outside, she dresses in

41:11.960 --> 41:16.660
like the full, you know, well, basically what I was wearing, minus the pigtails sticking out.

41:16.660 --> 41:20.740
And basically Hajar was like the only next door neighbor I've ever been friends with.

41:20.740 --> 41:25.060
And it's another one of those weird problems of considering culture as a monolith, like

41:25.060 --> 41:29.020
one would assume, or at least I assumed that like she would have zero interest in talking

41:29.020 --> 41:32.620
to me and we would have nothing in common, considering she's like super, super religious.

41:32.620 --> 41:35.700
And yes, some women do it voluntarily, but that's something I'm not going to get into

41:35.700 --> 41:36.700
it.

41:36.700 --> 41:40.180
But basically, one day we started talking when I was watching the Hunchback of Notre

41:40.180 --> 41:42.740
Dame too loud, really.

41:42.740 --> 41:47.620
And she was like, she caught me on the landing, like, so Hunchback of Notre Dame, huh?

41:47.620 --> 41:50.700
So anyway, I mentioned this thing to her and she was like, yeah, whatever.

41:50.700 --> 41:51.740
That's hilarious, lol.

41:51.740 --> 41:55.340
And so this is not excusing it, but I kind of took that as, well, my friend I know personally

41:55.340 --> 41:56.580
said it's fine.

41:56.580 --> 42:00.460
So I'm going to, you know, take that opinion over these strangers.

42:00.460 --> 42:04.900
But again, even at the time I had people on Twitter saying, do not do this thing.

42:04.900 --> 42:06.140
And I ignored them.

42:06.140 --> 42:11.460
And either way, I wasn't making content for Egyptian expats, which I'm pretty sure she's

42:11.460 --> 42:13.160
never even seen one of my videos.

42:13.160 --> 42:16.620
And either way, it was also completely unnecessary to the point of the video.

42:16.620 --> 42:20.940
Like I could have made the exact same point with like a potato sack with pigtails sticking

42:20.940 --> 42:23.200
out and it probably would have been funnier.

42:23.200 --> 42:25.160
This one was bad and wrong for a lot of reasons.

42:25.160 --> 42:26.840
And I do regret that.

42:28.840 --> 42:29.340
Next.

42:33.720 --> 42:38.680
So the Dear Stephanie Meyer video was about me reflecting on how carelessly I had participated

42:38.680 --> 42:43.360
in the casual misogyny surrounding the early Twilight backlash around the time that the

42:43.360 --> 42:46.580
first movie came out, you know, late 2000s.

42:46.580 --> 42:51.560
And so the general objection here is that the video is racist because I neither mentioned

42:51.560 --> 42:55.960
nor condemned Stephanie Meyer's depiction of the Quileute people.

42:55.960 --> 43:01.240
So I'm not going to lie and say I didn't consider addressing it.

43:01.240 --> 43:05.960
And I did have some conversations on Twitter with indigenous people that were actually

43:05.960 --> 43:06.960
productive.

43:06.960 --> 43:09.640
See, Twitter's not always bad, just, you know, mostly.

43:09.640 --> 43:12.760
But there were two main reasons I decided not to discuss it in that video.

43:12.760 --> 43:16.000
You know, besides the fact that that was back when I was trying to keep videos around like

43:16.000 --> 43:17.320
the 20 minute mark.

43:17.320 --> 43:21.440
One was the fact that during the backlash of the late 2010s, Twilight's appropriation

43:21.440 --> 43:26.360
of the Quileute was not a common criticism and certainly was not weaponized against Stephanie

43:26.360 --> 43:27.480
Meyer.

43:27.480 --> 43:32.920
It is now, but that just was not a substantial proportion of the backlash at that time.

43:32.920 --> 43:36.800
The second one is once again, we come to this question of the voices of a group being considered

43:36.800 --> 43:37.880
a monolith.

43:37.880 --> 43:43.280
I definitely talked to some indigenous people that condemned it, but I also saw some that

43:43.280 --> 43:47.680
were like, yeah, I mean, like, I mean, no, it's not the best, but I liked it.

43:47.680 --> 43:48.680
It was something new.

43:48.680 --> 43:50.800
It was like a representation we hadn't seen before.

43:50.800 --> 43:54.920
It was refreshing to have Jacob as this character who isn't like a noble savage stereotype and

43:54.920 --> 43:58.520
isn't like magically in tune with nature and doesn't have like a sad, broken family.

43:58.520 --> 44:02.520
He's just like a nice, normal kid who lives on the rez and vibes, you know, at least in

44:02.520 --> 44:03.520
the first book.

44:03.520 --> 44:07.080
Again, this video was addressing a point in time before Breaking Dawn came out.

44:07.080 --> 44:10.200
So I just wasn't really comfortable making a value judgment on which of those was the

44:10.200 --> 44:14.520
correct opinion, especially because it didn't really feel relevant to the central thesis.

44:14.520 --> 44:18.600
And it's also a complicated issue that just didn't feel at home in that video.

44:18.640 --> 44:22.920
Like, for instance, on the one hand, the way the Quileute are depicted in Twilight puts

44:22.920 --> 44:26.560
the onus on the real Quileute to educate people that they're not werewolves.

44:26.560 --> 44:32.040
And then the elders, they, you know, said, hey, Miss Ann, you got to get out there and

44:32.040 --> 44:35.120
educate people that were really not werewolves.

44:35.120 --> 44:40.640
But on the other hand, the attention Twilight has brought to the tribe has helped them tremendously,

44:40.640 --> 44:46.320
not just through tourism, but actually helped them get land back from the feds.

44:46.320 --> 44:49.920
It's opened the way for our tribe economically.

44:49.920 --> 44:52.320
And then the media, it helped us a lot.

44:52.320 --> 44:57.960
You know, our ancestors and our past council members have been fighting for over 50 years

44:57.960 --> 45:04.160
for our northern boundary dispute to actually have that day and have the President Obama

45:04.160 --> 45:08.880
signed a document saying that, you know, this land is yours.

45:08.880 --> 45:10.420
It was like, wow.

45:10.420 --> 45:15.800
But on the other other hand, Stephenie Meyer is a multimillionaire many times over.

45:15.800 --> 45:19.980
It is kind of weird that she has given none of that wealth, as far as I know, back to

45:19.980 --> 45:24.760
a people whose culture she appropriated, you know, for supernatural love triangles.

45:24.760 --> 45:28.280
And while we're on this topic, Amanda the Jedi has been doing a Twilight retrospective

45:28.280 --> 45:31.400
and she brought to my attention a fundraiser that the Quileute have been running for a

45:31.400 --> 45:35.280
few years to help move some of their village to higher ground to, you know, protect them

45:35.280 --> 45:39.240
from all the tsunamis and, you know, the climate change and whatnot.

45:39.240 --> 45:40.920
So that is linked below.

45:40.920 --> 45:45.040
If I did the video again, especially now that my videos are like eight hours long, I'd probably

45:45.080 --> 45:49.520
add a little bit mentioning that this conversation became prominent later.

45:49.520 --> 45:54.160
But this criticism does kind of always give me weird vibes because it usually comes with

45:54.160 --> 45:59.400
this subtext of, and this is why Stephenie Meyer did and still does deserve the harassment

45:59.400 --> 46:00.400
she got.

46:00.400 --> 46:03.600
One, that is not why people were hassling her in 2008, so I could not fold that into

46:03.600 --> 46:05.380
the valid common criticism folder.

46:05.380 --> 46:07.880
And two, no one deserves that.

46:07.880 --> 46:08.880
Next.

46:08.880 --> 46:15.440
2018, transphobia via Tarzan.

46:15.440 --> 46:19.000
I genuinely honestly really do regret this one, and I have said so a few times.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.200
Why do they never screencap their attractions?

46:21.200 --> 46:22.200
Weird.

46:22.200 --> 46:26.400
When it was announced that LeFou would become the first out gay character in a Disney movie,

46:26.400 --> 46:31.480
the Ls, the Gs, the Bs, the Ts, and of course all you filthy, filthy Qs.

46:31.480 --> 46:35.080
I think it was like 15 minutes after this video went live that I was like, oh God, why

46:35.080 --> 46:36.080
did I do that?

46:36.280 --> 46:39.960
Well, that's because I was thinking about the optics so much as it wasn't a good joke.

46:39.960 --> 46:42.640
Like I should have used Mulan, goddamn my eyes.

46:42.640 --> 46:47.920
I thought this idea of afab turk being angry about wearing a dress was funny, but in hindsight

46:47.920 --> 46:51.120
I really should have considered that it wasn't just any Disney character.

46:51.120 --> 46:56.640
It was a gorilla, an animal that trans women are sometimes compared to, and it was extremely

46:56.640 --> 46:57.640
careless.

46:57.640 --> 47:00.760
And it's a shame because I otherwise really do like that video.

47:00.760 --> 47:01.760
Next.

47:02.760 --> 47:03.760
Next.

47:04.760 --> 47:05.760
2020.

47:05.760 --> 47:08.760
Trans men don't experience oppression, actually.

47:08.760 --> 47:11.440
I didn't say that.

47:11.440 --> 47:17.560
I said that anecdotally I had heard from a few trans men over my 80 odd years of existence

47:17.560 --> 47:21.400
that they felt that they didn't experience the same level of scrutiny or harassment that

47:21.400 --> 47:25.200
they had before they transitioned because of misogyny.

47:25.200 --> 47:28.800
That said, this was also before Elliot Page came out, and I've seen so many people be

47:28.840 --> 47:32.600
beastly to him, so, you know, that is a strong counterexample.

47:32.600 --> 47:36.080
And I could say that I can't speak for all trans men's experiences, but I didn't claim

47:36.080 --> 47:38.800
to, and I'm not sure how you could read that into my statement.

47:38.800 --> 47:41.880
I was just repeating anecdotes I had heard.

47:41.880 --> 47:46.200
So some of the hate mail I've been getting is calling me a TERF because of this, which

47:46.200 --> 47:51.040
I think is really funny, because it's like, called a TERF for saying trans men are men.

47:51.040 --> 47:52.040
Alright.

47:52.040 --> 47:53.040
Next.

47:53.040 --> 47:54.040
2017.

47:54.440 --> 47:55.440
Next.

47:55.440 --> 47:56.440
2017.

47:56.440 --> 47:58.760
Zack Snyder hates his mother.

47:58.760 --> 48:02.920
Once again, tweet clipped out of context, and another one the gamergate refugees were

48:02.920 --> 48:05.120
really obsessed with.

48:05.120 --> 48:07.120
Not that you guys have anything in common, but...

48:07.120 --> 48:10.200
So these tweets are all long deleted, but this was a conversation between me and another

48:10.200 --> 48:15.320
film critic, I forget who, talking about how difficult it is to meaningfully discuss Zack

48:15.320 --> 48:21.040
Snyder's films, especially at the time, because his fans are... a little touchy.

48:21.040 --> 48:24.800
And one Snyder fan said, you know, I don't mind when critics talk about his movies, I

48:24.800 --> 48:28.480
just don't like it when they say stuff like Zack Snyder hates his mother.

48:28.480 --> 48:33.920
And this was just absurd to me because I have never ever heard a real critic say that, so

48:33.920 --> 48:38.520
I responded with what I considered obvious sarcasm, well I actually have it on good authority

48:38.520 --> 48:43.040
that Zack Snyder hates his mother.

48:43.040 --> 48:47.140
So this was really bad timing because I made this joke literally the night before the news

48:47.140 --> 48:52.180
broke that Autumn Snyder had killed herself, the very night before, and so I wake up to

48:52.180 --> 48:58.220
just this flood of outrage in my mentions and like, I am so deeply confused before I

48:58.220 --> 49:04.240
even realize what's going on, and it was just like, oh my god.

49:04.240 --> 49:07.880
So I don't like Zack Snyder's movies for a lot of reasons, but he does seem like the

49:07.880 --> 49:12.660
rare decent powerful man in Hollywood, and I can't imagine how awful it was to go through

49:12.660 --> 49:16.780
what he did, especially during such a huge production, and I'm impressed and appreciate

49:16.820 --> 49:22.220
that the Snyders have been doing such broad advocacy for suicide prevention now, but like

49:22.220 --> 49:31.220
harassing me in the name of like suicide prevention advocacy is like, come on.

49:31.220 --> 49:35.020
Now this is by no means Zack Snyder's fault, and I do not mean to imply that it is.

49:35.020 --> 49:39.500
Again, from all I've heard through my Hollywood grapevine, he seems like a decent person,

49:39.500 --> 49:42.940
and he can't control what his fans do, and even though I wish he had done it sooner,

49:42.940 --> 49:45.860
he has finally disavowed the really bad ones.

49:45.860 --> 49:50.140
And I also can kind of appreciate that he probably didn't really have the emotional

49:50.140 --> 49:55.140
bandwidth to pay attention to that sort of thing for a long time, let alone, you know,

49:55.140 --> 49:56.140
address it.

49:56.140 --> 50:00.420
But I'm also sure that the many, many Snyder fans who have told me to kill myself in the

50:00.420 --> 50:06.500
last four years because of this tweet just didn't know about my own history.

50:06.500 --> 50:10.340
Either way, I'm sure it's an issue they all care deeply, deeply about.

50:10.340 --> 50:12.020
All over a few Martha jokes.

50:12.020 --> 50:13.020
Jesus.

50:13.020 --> 50:14.020
Next.

50:14.020 --> 50:19.300
2020 did a misgender.

50:19.300 --> 50:20.460
This was a misunderstanding.

50:20.460 --> 50:22.980
John Mulaney did an SNL monologue that I didn't love.

50:22.980 --> 50:24.260
I said something about it.

50:24.260 --> 50:25.700
Curio responded to that.

50:25.700 --> 50:27.060
I said, yeah, I know.

50:27.060 --> 50:28.060
Thanks, John.

50:28.060 --> 50:29.100
Addressing John.

50:29.100 --> 50:30.820
We talked it out over Twitter.

50:30.820 --> 50:32.100
I apologized.

50:32.100 --> 50:34.020
Those tweets are still up.

50:34.020 --> 50:35.700
Next.

50:35.700 --> 50:39.540
2012 defending the yellow facing Cloud Atlas.

50:40.180 --> 50:43.940
I'm surprised there are no screen caps for this, probably because the diet Nazis didn't

50:43.940 --> 50:46.380
find that worthy of preservation.

50:46.380 --> 50:47.380
But this is true.

50:47.380 --> 50:50.380
There was a lot of criticism of Cloud Atlas at the time, and I said something to the effect

50:50.380 --> 50:54.860
of I didn't think it mattered as much as like, you know, the conversations around blackface

50:54.860 --> 50:57.340
because they had a different history.

50:57.340 --> 50:59.180
And I don't I don't know why I said that.

50:59.180 --> 51:00.340
I don't know what the hell I was thinking.

51:00.340 --> 51:04.020
Like, for one thing, I was definitely revealing my ignorance because, like, yellow face is

51:04.020 --> 51:06.620
just, you know, a topic I had never really studied.

51:06.620 --> 51:09.380
I'd done plenty on blackface, nothing on yellow face.

51:09.380 --> 51:12.300
And falling on your sword for Cloud Atlas, of all things.

51:12.300 --> 51:14.460
My podcast partner is going to be so disappointed.

51:14.460 --> 51:15.460
I'm sorry.

51:15.460 --> 51:16.460
Copy.

51:16.460 --> 51:19.140
So, yeah, I still like Cloud Atlas, but the creative decision to use yellow face in the

51:19.140 --> 51:21.220
way that they did is pretty inexcusable.

51:21.220 --> 51:23.860
And honestly, it does kind of make me uncomfortable to watch now.

51:23.860 --> 51:24.860
My bad.

51:24.860 --> 51:25.860
Next.

51:25.860 --> 51:34.700
2015 bisexual erasure.

51:34.700 --> 51:39.180
So again, another post clipped out of context, and it is quite literally the only time I

51:39.180 --> 51:40.780
have ever written about my sexuality.

51:40.780 --> 51:44.660
And stuff like this is the reason why I was like, wow, never talk about that again.

51:44.660 --> 51:48.220
It is from my now deleted blog, but I linked the archive page below.

51:48.220 --> 51:53.700
And in effect, it was basically me kind of working out my feelings on feeling like bisexual

51:53.700 --> 51:56.740
erasure was almost a form of privilege.

51:56.740 --> 51:59.060
And I still kind of think that's true.

51:59.060 --> 52:03.060
And the thing about sexuality is it's just like such a personal thing.

52:03.060 --> 52:09.020
And that's why this like conflation of like the political and the personal, while necessary,

52:09.020 --> 52:16.060
often makes me really uncomfortable because it was like such a painful process for me.

52:16.060 --> 52:21.100
And one, I never really figured out how to reconcile, so I just never did.

52:21.100 --> 52:26.580
So I've never really had a coming out or embracing my truths, more just like slow, quiet, begrudging

52:26.580 --> 52:27.580
acceptance.

52:27.580 --> 52:31.180
Like I just have these laundry lists of experiences, like for being in college and going to gay

52:31.180 --> 52:36.020
clubs and having lesbians suddenly turn cold when they find out you're bisexual to the

52:36.020 --> 52:42.020
popular axiom at the time of buy now gay later or highway to homo or gay until May

52:42.020 --> 52:45.940
to Dan Savage way up into the 2010s saying that bisexual men don't exist or it's all

52:45.940 --> 52:51.740
a phase or all the way to former respected person Glenn Greenwald saying that the bisexuals

52:51.740 --> 52:56.960
are transing the lesbians out of existence as recently as last month.

52:56.960 --> 53:00.960
So I can't help but feel a sort of imposter syndrome every time I do anything even tangentially

53:00.960 --> 53:02.220
pride related.

53:02.220 --> 53:05.660
I feel tolerated, but not accepted.

53:05.740 --> 53:07.140
Why do I want to go to that parade?

53:07.140 --> 53:08.420
Like, oh, you're here.

53:08.420 --> 53:09.420
Fine.

53:09.420 --> 53:10.900
I guess we're contractually obligated to let you in.

53:10.900 --> 53:15.060
So I think for a lot of bisexuals, especially women, we do kind of live in this liminal

53:15.060 --> 53:18.020
space of both privilege and erasure.

53:18.020 --> 53:22.100
It is painful to feel ostracized from the community when accepting your identity has

53:22.100 --> 53:27.300
caused you so much pain in the first place, but at the same time, you can opt out.

53:27.300 --> 53:29.900
You can, in effect, pass a straight.

53:29.900 --> 53:35.020
If I had a dollar for every time someone called me a straight white woman in the last few

53:35.020 --> 53:39.060
weeks, that would take care of my Patreon for at least a month.

53:39.060 --> 53:44.540
And to answer very good faith actors like Glenn Greenwald, what was his mother thinking?

53:44.540 --> 53:48.820
So to answer very good faith actors like Blerp Blerp Blerp as to why proportionally bisexual

53:48.820 --> 53:54.180
people tend to end up in heterosexual relationships 75-25 rather than the 50-50 it logically should

53:54.180 --> 53:55.180
be.

53:55.180 --> 53:56.180
Hmm.

53:56.180 --> 53:57.740
I wonder why that could be.

53:57.740 --> 54:00.700
You know, just besides the fact that as a proportion of humanity, there are more straight

54:00.700 --> 54:01.700
people to choose from.

54:01.700 --> 54:03.620
Well, here I am making a thing out of it.

54:03.820 --> 54:05.820
Am I in the club now?

54:08.540 --> 54:09.540
Next.

54:10.540 --> 54:11.540
2014.

54:11.540 --> 54:15.300
Did a bisexual gatekeeping against Mara Wilson.

54:15.300 --> 54:21.180
Ah, so we have reached the speculations on my private life portion of the game show.

54:21.180 --> 54:24.780
Is now a good time to bring up the fact that Lindsay Ellis was super shitty and biphobic

54:24.780 --> 54:28.820
to Mara Wilson when she came out as bi, or are we giving people of color a moment to

54:28.820 --> 54:31.500
drag her for filth before we bring up other shit?

54:31.500 --> 54:32.500
Be honest.

54:33.380 --> 54:34.380
Phew.

54:34.380 --> 54:37.460
I guess we're doing this.

54:37.460 --> 54:42.100
You may know Mara Wilson from her work as a child star in films like Matilda and Mrs.

54:42.100 --> 54:43.100
Doubtfire.

54:43.100 --> 54:47.140
In the last odd decade or so, she's worked as a nonfiction author, a voice actor, a Twitter

54:47.140 --> 54:52.300
person who makes approximately 680 retweets per day, and also occasionally a writer of

54:52.300 --> 54:54.380
op-eds for outlets like the New York Times.

54:54.380 --> 54:58.380
In 2016, when she gave an interview about coming out as bisexual, it included this quote.

54:58.380 --> 55:00.060
I remember being with bisexual friends.

55:00.060 --> 55:02.000
I said, I think I might be bisexual.

55:02.000 --> 55:05.080
And a friend of mine who's not a friend anymore said, no you're not.

55:05.080 --> 55:06.080
She was a gaykeeper.

55:06.080 --> 55:07.080
Okay.

55:07.080 --> 55:08.080
That's good.

55:08.080 --> 55:10.920
I'm going to use that.

55:10.920 --> 55:15.160
So I'm not sure how this random Twitter user decided that she was talking about me as the

55:15.160 --> 55:21.520
gaykeeper in this interview from 2016, but someone decided she must have been talking

55:21.520 --> 55:26.000
about me based on no evidence whatsoever, and the accusation stuck, mostly because Mara

55:26.000 --> 55:31.120
liked that tweet, and then about 50 other tweets of people having a high old time with

55:31.160 --> 55:33.000
me as Twitter's villain of the day.

55:33.000 --> 55:36.920
And I really don't know where this random user supposition came from, because I have

55:36.920 --> 55:42.440
been very, very careful never to say anything about her publicly, either by reference or

55:42.440 --> 55:48.000
implication, despite the many times she has talked about this awful former friend she

55:48.000 --> 55:57.640
used to have, either in interviews, podcasts, subtweets, in print.

55:57.640 --> 55:58.640
It was me.

55:58.640 --> 55:59.640
It's me!

56:00.160 --> 56:03.160
I was the turkey all along!

56:05.160 --> 56:07.160
I was wondering what that turkey was doing there.

56:07.160 --> 56:11.160
And to my knowledge, she's never indicated that I was the gaykeeper until the liking

56:11.160 --> 56:14.640
of this tweet, thereby validating these suppositions.

56:14.640 --> 56:15.640
Cool.

56:15.640 --> 56:17.640
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

56:17.640 --> 56:22.160
Okay, y'all, I'm about to blow some minds, but first I need to provide some context.

56:22.160 --> 56:25.640
Mara and I were, at a point in history, friends and literal neighbors.

56:25.640 --> 56:29.160
You know, we were both in our mid-twenties, we lived like two blocks from each other,

56:29.680 --> 56:32.680
we were both recent NYU grads, and we were both aspiring writers.

56:32.680 --> 56:36.680
And many people who've been following us for a long, long time have observed, hmm,

56:36.680 --> 56:40.680
you two used to be really good friends, and then suddenly you were not.

56:40.680 --> 56:41.680
And that is true.

56:41.680 --> 56:47.680
But here's the thing, the anecdote about the gatekeeping bisexual former friend is

56:47.680 --> 56:48.680
also true.

56:48.680 --> 56:52.680
I do remember the conversation she is talking about, and while the wording she uses isn't

56:52.680 --> 56:56.680
how I remember it, the basic gist of the conversation is true.

56:57.200 --> 57:00.200
She told me she thought she might be bisexual, and I kind of casually dismissed it on the

57:00.200 --> 57:05.200
grounds of her dating style, reminding me of a former roommate who prided herself on

57:05.200 --> 57:06.200
being straight.

57:06.200 --> 57:11.200
It was a fairly short conversation, it happened one time, like seven years ago?

57:11.200 --> 57:13.200
Yeah, and we never spoke of it again.

57:13.200 --> 57:18.200
So this conversation happened at least a year before we stopped speaking, which was over

57:18.200 --> 57:20.200
five years ago.

57:20.200 --> 57:22.200
And the reason why was a series of compounding factors.

57:22.200 --> 57:25.200
This was not one of them, at least to my knowledge.

57:25.720 --> 57:28.720
And the truth is, I don't know why I said what I said, or reacted the way I did.

57:28.720 --> 57:32.720
If that had happened now, I would not have reacted that way, but even then, I don't

57:32.720 --> 57:36.720
know why I was so dismissive offhand about something that I know from my own experience

57:36.720 --> 57:38.720
can cause a lot of pain and isolation.

57:38.720 --> 57:43.720
And it only came up the one time, was immediately dropped, and we never spoke of it again, and

57:43.720 --> 57:45.720
for that reason, I never thought much of it.

57:45.720 --> 57:48.720
I didn't consider that she wasn't just kind of saying something off the cuff, but

57:48.720 --> 57:51.720
was actually admitting something that she had been considering for a while to someone

57:52.240 --> 57:55.240
that she thought would understand, and that person dismissed her.

57:55.240 --> 57:58.240
And I didn't even begin to know that this caused any hurt until almost two years after

57:58.240 --> 58:02.240
that conversation even happened, because she didn't come out until a few months after

58:04.240 --> 58:08.240
Between the two of us, and I cannot express this enough, had nothing to do with this.

58:08.240 --> 58:12.240
Like, this is something I feel like I need to press on these so-and-so-is-a-secret-bigot

58:12.240 --> 58:13.240
crusaders.

58:13.240 --> 58:17.240
Does it occur to you that you can dislike someone without some irreconcilable, ideological

58:17.240 --> 58:18.240
differences?

58:18.760 --> 58:21.760
This is a personal falling out between two people that has nothing to do with the content

58:21.760 --> 58:22.760
we produce.

58:22.760 --> 58:24.760
I produce.

58:24.760 --> 58:28.760
And I just want to dispel this narrative that, like, someone has to be like the secret bigot

58:28.760 --> 58:33.760
or, you know, mask off, or there's always the wronged one and the abuser in one of these

58:33.760 --> 58:37.760
falling outs, when it's just like, sometimes people just don't get along, kids.

58:37.760 --> 58:41.760
I would love to know why Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice fell out, but it is, at the end

58:41.760 --> 58:45.760
of the day, none of my business, and they have made it known, and they have kept the

58:46.280 --> 58:49.280
under wraps for almost 40 years, and honestly, good for them.

58:49.280 --> 58:50.280
Life goals.

58:50.280 --> 58:54.780
And though do trust that this bridge is well and truly forever burned, I do sincerely regret

58:54.780 --> 58:56.400
that I reacted the way I did.

58:56.400 --> 59:01.280
I think I was probably projecting my own experience with rejection and paying it forward, and

59:01.280 --> 59:02.620
I am sorry for that.

59:02.620 --> 59:06.600
And no, I shan't be airing any more dirty laundry on this topic, fascinating though

59:06.600 --> 59:07.600
it may be.

59:09.600 --> 59:10.600
Next.

59:11.440 --> 59:12.440
2009.

59:12.440 --> 59:14.440
The Rape Rap.

59:14.440 --> 59:16.440
Someone made a rape joke.

59:16.440 --> 59:19.440
Oh my gooooooo-

59:19.440 --> 59:21.440
Someone call the rape joke brigade.

59:21.440 --> 59:24.440
Officer, I have an infraction I need to report to the Ministry of Rape Jokes.

59:24.440 --> 59:27.440
Look, honestly, I'm shocked that Lindsay Ellis has not been cancelled forever by the rape

59:27.440 --> 59:28.440
rap.

59:28.440 --> 59:30.440
The zoomers that are cancelling her haven't even discovered the old rape rap she made

59:30.440 --> 59:33.440
yet, while very thoughtful that she finally released a Mandarin and Japanese version of

59:33.440 --> 59:35.440
the original rape rap.

59:37.440 --> 59:39.440
Well, this has been a long time coming, hasn't it?

59:40.280 --> 59:45.200
There is this semi-infamous video I did back in 2009, which is called Rape Rap, which is

59:45.200 --> 59:47.120
exactly what it sounds like.

59:47.120 --> 59:51.980
The joke is that my friend Brian, playing a rapping sexual predator, says horrible things

59:51.980 --> 59:57.020
to me online because woman, and I try to get him not to say these things.

59:57.020 --> 01:00:01.080
And honestly, I kind of want to give a slow clap to the diet Nazis because this is a fetch

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:04.360
they have been trying to make happen for years.

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.880
And I'm honestly kind of happy for them, you know?

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:13.440
Like, they have used this to hurt me and humiliate me, and they sent it to like PBS affiliate,

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:18.560
PBS corporate, trying to get me fired, and they've uploaded like 800 mirrors to YouTube,

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:22.800
they've sent it to my colleagues, they've spammed me with it for over a decade, and

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:26.400
it just never spread beyond the diet Nazi sphere.

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:31.560
And it's finally, finally into the mainstream woke-school Twitter.

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.880
You know, I'm happy for them.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:35.880
They worked so hard for this.

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:41.340
So I know the people adding this to my list of sins are very, very concerned about rape

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:44.400
victims, and that's why you're upset by this.

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:47.200
So I know you would want to know the context for this.

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:51.460
You aren't just thoughtlessly adding this to my ledger to help assuage people's moments

01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:55.820
of doubt that the harassment against me was, in fact, justified.

01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:57.320
You care about context.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:01.600
And here's your content warning, so if you don't want to hear this, skip to this time

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:02.600
code.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.000
We're bringing out the tequila for this one.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:13.760
This isn't even fake tequila.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:19.760
So when I was a sophomore in college, my very first sexual experience with another human

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.280
being was _____.

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:26.320
Big reason why I was vulnerable to this person was _____.

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:30.680
So he took me back to his studio apartment and _____.

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:34.600
And when I woke up and realized what had happened, I started freaking out.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:40.440
And I remember there being this smell, and so basically he just pushed me out of his

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:44.200
apartment and he gave me a $20 bill and just slammed the door in my face.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.040
And I mean, what are you going to do?

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:52.240
So the $20 bill was enough money exactly for the cab ride home.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:57.760
And then I got a Nesquik, you know, the chocolate milk and a bagel.

01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:03.480
And then I go upstairs to my dorm room and I like just hork it all up.

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:08.080
And then I like take off my clothes and I just like burn the evidence on our gas stove.

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.200
Like I just like, you know, it was the clothes' fault.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:13.120
I just, my roommate was out of town at the time, so there was nobody.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:18.400
So I just like burn the clothes and burn the evidence and I didn't tell anyone that this

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:19.400
happened.

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:20.400
So nobody knew.

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:26.480
So about one year later, I was at a Dresden Dolls concert, of all things.

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:34.280
And I think this was, yeah, this was 2005 and I was there with my roommate and we lived

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:37.520
in the West Village and the concert was at Webster Hall.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:42.480
And Webster Hall was about a 15, 20 minute walk from our apartment in the West Village.

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:47.840
And we got separated on the way home, you know, because, you know, concert and partying.

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:52.320
And normally that's like no big deal because like it's no big deal to get separated from

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:55.520
your college roommate for, you know, 10 minutes.

01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:06.440
But when I get back to our apartment, I find her on the stairwell covered in because by

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:07.440
our neighbors.

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.860
So like literally across the hallway neighbor.

01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:13.100
So I just like see white.

01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:19.360
I just like fly into this animal rage and I don't think it was like it couldn't have

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:22.300
been more than like five or 10 minutes before the police showed up.

01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:24.660
And I was like still in full hoke mode.

01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:32.480
And fortunately, the ambulance showed up before they could take us to jail, as they do.

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:37.980
So we went to the hospital and she got a rape kit done.

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:41.100
And so now I'm involved with that case.

01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:44.420
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:50.620
All this while, like this whole time, I had not told anybody what had happened to me.

01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:55.900
I wouldn't actually tell anybody what happened to me for like another, I think it was like

01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:56.900
another year or two.

01:03:56.900 --> 01:04:00.980
I think, yeah, it was probably like, yeah, it was like two years later.

01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:02.620
And of course I didn't do it in a healthy way.

01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:05.500
I think it was probably, yeah, it was something like this, you know, like, is this healthy?

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:08.620
So here's the thing when like something like this happens, you know, and like, you know,

01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:12.420
there's police involved and police reports and hospitalizations, you know, besides the

01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:17.860
DA pressuring you out of pressing charges, which is what they did to my roommate.

01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:22.540
And, you know, I didn't realize that was because, you know, they want to deflate the crime stats

01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:27.020
in their districts until about 15 years later when Reply All did an episode on that.

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:31.180
But the thing is, like, there's a lot of paperwork and like, no, this is relevant.

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:36.640
So basically, like, she and I shared this like hanging file, like for all of our paperwork

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:42.340
that we had for like various things that were just like, you know, financial aid, you know,

01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:46.460
essays, college stuff, rape.

01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:52.940
For the first like few days, it was just this like untouchable, horrible thing that

01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:58.140
like happened and had to be endured and was just like this pall over both of us.

01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:01.780
And you know, and this was before the DA pressured her out of pressing charges.

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:07.380
And so we had this folder and so like, we just somehow like I asked her like, well,

01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:08.380
what's in that folder?

01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:11.460
And she's like, rape.

01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:16.140
And we kind of like embellished the folder, like with the musical.

01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:22.220
And it was just like, rape and like, you know, horror font, the musical.

01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:26.260
And I'm not going to lie and say this like began the process of healing, categorically,

01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:27.260
it didn't.

01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:31.340
But you know, it did make the reality of the situation like accessible, you know, joking

01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:32.820
about it brings it down to earth.

01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:36.220
It's no longer this like unspeakable horror.

01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:42.380
And like, you know, if Cora's life is based on mine in any way it is this, NYU's TAs were

01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:47.500
having a strike that semester, meaning that the undergrads were allowed to drop classes

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:52.040
basically up until finals, without penalty or a failing grade.

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:58.100
And what happened was that like, that was the only semester where that was an option.

01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:03.540
And if it weren't for that technicality, where I could drop classes up to finals, I would

01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:04.540
have failed out of school.

01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:07.940
I mean, the failing out part is taken from my experience, not the rape part.

01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:10.020
I didn't I didn't give Cora that tragic backstory.

01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:14.100
So being just like this one, two punch of horrible things, like I just like I was honestly

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:15.100
terrible.

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:19.380
Like, I like in so many ways, I went catatonic, I wasn't supportive.

01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:24.480
And I just don't remember like big chunks of 2005 and 2006.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:28.340
And that sucks because like, I really, you know, treasure a lot of my time and education

01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:29.500
at NYU.

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:33.660
There are just like huge blocks of it that I don't remember.

01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:39.020
But I do remember this, not long after I graduated a couple years later, Rape the Musical came

01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:41.420
up in like a different context.

01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:46.260
And my friends, Brian and Pat, both to this day are, you know, still two of my dearest

01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:47.260
friends.

01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:49.940
Brian even officiated my wedding.

01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:54.060
So Brian had this jacket, which he joked made him look like a flasher.

01:06:54.060 --> 01:07:01.020
And like, somehow or other, he was like, freestyling these wraps to me and Pat and I, at the time,

01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:03.300
found them just like hilarious and cathartic.

01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:04.300
And I was like, you know, keep going.

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:07.420
And so we like started workshopping and we're like, oh, let's make a sketch out of this.

01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:12.620
And I just remember these like lame freestyles while Pat just sat there with this like dead

01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:18.820
serious expression, not paying attention and just me like dying laughing and like finding

01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:20.820
it honestly really helpful.

01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:23.180
And I don't think, like at the time, I don't even think they knew.

01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:26.080
I think they were just like humoring me.

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:30.200
So this was a way of tying in all of this like horrible nonsense that happened to me

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:34.860
and my roommate in college with some of the misogynist garbage I was getting as a baby

01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:37.880
woman on the Internet in 2009.

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:42.060
So it was, as the kids say, a cope.

01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:47.540
Now with regard to this jokey joke little sketch that makes such light of rape, I know

01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:48.540
what you're thinking.

01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:50.380
This must be so hard for you.

01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:51.960
That's so sad for you.

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:54.680
That must have been super fucking hard for you.

01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:58.820
But if this was indeed a copey cope jokey joke between friends, should it not have remained

01:07:58.820 --> 01:07:59.820
private?

01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:02.780
Yes, you observing good faith person you it should have.

01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:06.300
But this was uploaded without my knowledge or permission.

01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:09.700
Without my consent, you might say.

01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:13.300
I even blogged about it because at the time I was, of course, getting calls for apologies

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:15.660
and I was like, absolutely not.

01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:17.060
This happened without my permission.

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:20.820
And there's an archived link to that blog entry in the description if you vultures want

01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:21.820
proof.

01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:25.780
So the way that this happened at all was at the time Channel Awesome controlled all of

01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:30.120
our individual channels and we didn't upload them ourselves.

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:34.160
We uploaded them to an FTP and scheduled them and then someone else uploaded it for

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:35.160
us.

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:38.960
So when I finished this video, I did still think it was funny, but I also realized that

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:40.840
this should never see the light of day.

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:43.960
This can be just like a practice run for other sketchy things that we do and should stay

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:48.720
a private joke between friends, all the while forgetting that my export folder automatically

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.720
uploaded directly to this FTP.

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:53.480
So months pass, I forgot it was even there.

01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:57.320
And then one day the guy who ran the schedule, I guess, got annoyed that I kept blowing my

01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:02.280
deadlines and he was like, fine, I'll just upload whatever's in that FTP folder.

01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:06.200
But like I started getting these phone calls asking why I scheduled that and I'm like,

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:12.080
I didn't take it down, but it was too late.

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:15.220
And now here we are.

01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:20.560
So the Diet Nazis love this video because, you know, they think I'm like this high minded

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:27.340
liberal who is like so holier than thou and therefore that this exposes my hypocrisy.

01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:32.280
And so we can use this to just like torment me and humiliate me and just like constantly

01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:33.280
like upload it.

01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:36.840
And like I'll just see it like in my mentions and sometimes they'll send it to like my colleagues

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:40.680
or my publisher just to like try to get them to get a reaction.

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:45.640
And so now Wokeskull Twitter has discovered it and just mindlessly adds it to my ledger

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:46.640
of sins.

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:51.600
And so now here we are and I'm having to relive one of the worst times of my life just to

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:54.760
get you people to back the fuck off.

01:09:54.760 --> 01:10:18.880
So like all of you, just these these people who have been trying to get to me with it

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:24.680
and think that like me staying silent is an admission of guilt rather than it being none

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:29.640
of your fucking business, even considering that this was not supposed to be made public.

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:33.560
And now these Wokeskulls are just adding it to like my ledger and trying to use it to

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:35.000
discredit me.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.580
All of you are just loathsome, loathsome people.

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:46.360
And I hope you all...

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:55.080
And as I mentioned earlier, this list is non-comprehensive, but...

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:58.920
And to everyone out there who is like, you know, well, yeah, but why are you making this

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:01.180
all about you?

01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:04.240
I didn't make this about me.

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:08.440
You did.

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:11.240
Part five, the tweet.

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:15.600
So if this tweet were a video essay that had been researched for months instead of a tweet

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:19.840
popped off in a minute, which I never will make, I will never talk about either of these

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:24.040
properties again, it would probably be structured something like this.

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:26.840
Avatar the Last Airbender was a game changer in a lot of ways.

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:29.040
Here are some of the things that influenced it.

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:34.360
Shonen anime, Asian folklore, there's a new generation of American writers, many of them

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:37.000
people of color who were influenced by it.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.240
Anime and young adult literature have changed a lot because of this direct and indirect

01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:42.240
influence.

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:43.560
And honestly, I think that's cool.

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:47.560
I think that shows and books are honestly much more interesting for it than that which

01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:50.680
came before.

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:55.960
So with regard to the similarity between these two texts, two big things stuck out to me.

01:11:55.960 --> 01:12:01.080
One is the element-based co-lead being woken up by Katara after hundreds of years of sleep

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:05.880
as the last whatever, now, you know, come on, Aang, we have to go from nation to nation,

01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:10.360
and in each nation you will acquire a skill until we face down the ding dang dong fire

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:13.540
nation what started this whole mess and heal the world.

01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:17.680
But the thing that stuck out most in my mind as a trend that I've been seeing a lot in

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:23.760
animation and YA literature and it's not a bad thing, Jesus, it's what I'm going to call

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:26.520
for lack of originality, the Zuko.

01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:30.400
The princeling of the rival nation who has a lot to prove to their family and who serves

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:35.320
as the principal antagonist for a while while our heroes bop from nation to nation and he

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:39.040
chases them around but eventually starts to have a change of heart and a redemption

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.040
arc...

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:48.080
Now, the reason I cited like half of YA fantasy, again I did not mean literally half, that

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:55.280
was hyperbole, well basically it was because most of the YA fantasy that I had read, because

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:58.960
those were, you know, the big names that, you know, I had to read to be hept to the

01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:04.600
jive that were released in the last few years have Avatar as influences, the most high profile

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:08.080
of which being Children of Blood and Bone by Tomi Adeyemi.

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:13.560
Now I did enjoy this book and like Raya it also made heavy use of the Zuko and for that

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:18.540
reason it was the first thing that popped into my head as being similar to Raya.

01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:23.080
And yes, Avatar the Last Airbender makes heavy use of Asian and anime tropes but it was the

01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:27.040
piece of media that popularized a lot of these things in the US.

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:31.740
You didn't really see like redemption arcs over several seasons before that and now you

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:33.240
see it all the time.

01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:39.160
Steven Universe does it, the new She-Ra does it, Kipo kind of does it with the frog and

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:40.160
the monkey.

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:42.280
Okay, I never said the Zuko had to be sexy.

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:44.960
And now we have Raya and the Last Dragon.

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:50.040
Now if you did read into my tweet that I was dismissing this or saying it was a bad thing,

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:54.560
I guess I could understand that read because it wasn't very gracefully worded and it doesn't

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:55.560
say anything positive.

01:13:55.560 --> 01:14:01.000
But it doesn't say anything negative either, it is an inherently neutral statement, it

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.320
is an observation, it's not even a critique.

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:06.560
And so I was like, this is not a dig, ya crazies.

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:11.480
And then the line is like, oh, you're calling POC crazy, which is so disingenuous when the

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:15.840
vast, vast majority of people losing their shit at me in my mentions were white people

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:18.220
projecting their own insecurities at me.

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:23.040
Like obviously, ya crazies was a joke, but as a writer and a media critic, it was just

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:29.360
so frustrating for me to see people interpreting the comparison of these two things as a dig.

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:32.400
Like I was insulting one by comparing it to the other.

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:39.440
What is this like CinemaSins brain poisoning thing being similar to other thing not bad?

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:43.320
One of the funnest things as a writer you get to do when discussing your book or your

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:48.680
media is discussing the influences because ostensibly they are something the author loves

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:50.540
and is excited to talk about.

01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:56.120
So I also saw like a bunch of these like weird low digs like, oh, Axiom's End is so original.

01:14:56.120 --> 01:15:00.440
Oh, Axiom's End is derivative, like I know that.

01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:05.740
I have marketed the damn thing on it being inspired by alien invasion movies and TV shows

01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:07.680
of the 90s and 2000s.

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:11.600
There is a reason why I made a bunch of content about those influences in the year leading

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:12.600
up to its release.

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:15.760
Do you want me to give you a list of them?

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:19.960
Everything has influences and Avatar The Last Airbender is one of the most successful and

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:22.320
beloved children's shows of all time.

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:26.720
As the author Tomi Adeyemi said of Children of Blood and Bone, the book Raya reminded

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:42.480
me a lot of, and even one of the screenwriters of Raya has said that although Avatar was

01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:47.360
not a direct inspiration, we don't shy away from the comparison because it's a beautiful

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:51.240
series.

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:55.520
No matter how many mental back bends I do, even if you're tired of this take or feel

01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:00.200
like it's flattening everything inspired by the largest continent on earth, I cannot begin

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:05.040
to understand this causing hurt or anguish unless you are reading into it something that

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:11.200
I did not say, especially when I'm like the 800th person to make this very milquetoast

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:12.420
observation.

01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:16.440
Screen Junkies had released an Honest Trailer several days earlier making the exact same

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:19.640
comparison for the exact same reasons.

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:34.840
And look at that dislike ratio.

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:40.360
I don't think there is a single video on my entire channel with a dislike ratio that low.

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:44.160
I wonder why they didn't get any backlash.

01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:48.000
I wonder why it could be.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.080
Part 6.

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:53.240
She Deserved It If Twitter had streets, there would have been

01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:55.520
dancing in them when I deleted my account.

01:16:55.520 --> 01:17:00.560
Like Justine Sacco getting fired, like everyone held accountable by an online mob before me,

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:03.320
this was taken as a victory by many, many people.

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:06.440
And so the problem with making a big thing out of this tweet, which at worst could be

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:11.360
considered an unintentional microaggression, made the outraged reaction to it kind of hard

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:12.680
to justify.

01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:17.400
Which is why we need to establish a history of my offenses to bolster their case.

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:19.360
And this is where the list of sins comes in.

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:22.120
I'm trending on Twitter for like two days.

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:26.040
There's all this discourse, so of course people are going to have second thoughts.

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:29.640
Like why are so many people talking about this?

01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:31.160
Maybe this has gotten out of hand.

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:34.040
Maybe the backlash wasn't worth the original sin.

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:38.580
And here comes Dragon Celeste and hundreds like her like, oh no, don't worry.

01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:40.240
This is accountability.

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:44.680
Here is the long list of sins proving that this is just mask off.

01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:46.900
She has a long history.

01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:49.340
How has she not been called out before?

01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:53.000
I know someone who's met her and they say she's a bad person.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.280
So you don't need to feel bad about hounding her because she deserves it.

01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:02.160
And my God, just the joy people took in this, like seeing me taken down a peg.

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:03.660
Good fucking riddance, bitch.

01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:04.660
Good riddance.

01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:05.660
Good fucking riddance.

01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:06.660
Terrible human being.

01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:07.860
Dislikes Asians too.

01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:09.860
Y'all getting Lindsay Ellis is beautiful.

01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:10.860
Don't know shit about her.

01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:13.300
I can just look at a white person and know they're awful.

01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:14.500
Can't stand that human being.

01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:16.060
Glad I won't have to see her tweets.

01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:18.100
Her takes were so awful and embarrassing.

01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:20.100
I wouldn't want to be anywhere near her.

01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:24.100
Fuck Lindsay Ellis and her awful racism and for being a prominent phantom fan when it

01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:25.100
should be me.

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:31.640
But mostly the racism.

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:33.180
I hate her and Jenny Nicholson.

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:34.940
Serene smiley faces.

01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:36.300
Lindsay Ellis deleted.

01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:40.220
People like Lindsay Ellis are finally facing consequences for being atrocious human beings.

01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:42.380
Lindsay Ellis getting canceled is good, actually.

01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:44.300
I will die on this fucking hill.

01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:48.420
What have I done to you?

01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:51.140
Are you are you rent fans?

01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:56.520
So many times I've seen people show the damning evidence to others like, see, look at this.

01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:01.700
Only have the people they're showing it to be like, I don't understand where you're getting

01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:02.700
this.

01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:03.780
Is there some context I'm missing?

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:08.760
Here is a woman of color doing that very thing to Kat Black, demanding that she answer for

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:11.860
sometimes collaborating with such a racist.

01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:16.100
And Kat basically responded, why the fuck are you demanding that I answer for my white

01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:17.100
colleagues?

01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:18.700
Leave her the fuck alone.

01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:19.980
And this is just the switches.

01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:23.260
Oh, oh, the joy the diet Nazis took in this.

01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:25.460
God, they love it when the left eats their own.

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:26.960
And why wouldn't they?

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:30.100
It's hilarious when your political enemies tear each other apart.

01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:34.580
I mean, to reiterate, these people have been trying to take me down for years.

01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:35.580
Keep trying, boys.

01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:39.280
And part of that joy comes with this justification of what they perceive as someone with real

01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:43.120
power and wealth and privilege being taken down a peg.

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:48.640
It's like this bizarre delusion that I or any of my friends have any real power or influence

01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:51.520
outside of our very niche corner of the internet.

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:53.840
I am not a real celebrity.

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:55.920
I almost never get recognized in public.

01:19:55.920 --> 01:20:01.320
I don't have a PR team or a manager or a stylist or a team of lawyers.

01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:08.280
Just one very anxious literary agent and one YouTube agent who honestly, he thinks this

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.280
shit is hilarious.

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:12.880
I also kind of miss the diet Nazis because like they at least knew what they were.

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:16.480
They weren't harassing me like it was some civil rights campaign that might make the

01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:18.660
world marginally more just.

01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:22.240
They were just bullies, plain and simple, and they were proud of it.

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:25.160
And you know, honestly, in hindsight, I kind of respect that.

01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:31.560
At least my mentions being full of like pictures of razor blades and dead animals and Clorox

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:33.040
saying, hey, drink this.

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.480
You know, at least that's honest.

01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:38.080
I do appreciate that the people making good faith criticisms are not responsible for the

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:43.900
people making bad faith criticism or for that matter threats or rejoicing in my downfall.

01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:48.040
But it is beyond the scope of reasonable to expect me to take all this stimulus.

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:54.060
Thousands of people screaming at me from reasonable to sadistic, especially considering everything

01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:57.760
I've been through in my life and behave like the perfect victim.

01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:59.760
If you just say the right thing, we'll leave you alone.

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:02.740
If you just behave in the way we're asking, we'll make it go away.

01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:04.960
If you just apologize, we just stop.

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.440
All she had to do was like, listen.

01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:09.440
She had a long history of problematic shit and she never listened.

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:10.960
She should have done the work to make amends.

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:14.280
Maybe next time don't call an entire marginalized group crazy.

01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:18.480
She's a biphobic, transphobic racist mess who deleted her account rather than apologize

01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:19.680
for being a piece of shit.

01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:22.440
She couldn't take actual criticism for people who knew more than she did.

01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:26.640
Motherfucker, all you had to do was apologize for her white bread take and move on.

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:28.560
Deleted her own account then just apologized.

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:30.320
Nuked her account instead of apologized.

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:32.580
Totally unraveled under the slightest scrutiny.

01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:34.320
Deleted her account instead of saying I fucked up.

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:35.320
Sorry.

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:36.320
Why are you so emotional?

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:37.320
Why are you so upset?

01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:40.200
I'm not with the hundreds of people saying you're responsible for hate crimes and mass

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:41.200
murder.

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:44.440
I'm not one of the people trotting out the obsessive documentation of every misstep you've

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:46.240
ever made over the last 15 years.

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:47.640
I'm the reasonable one.

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:48.640
And I'm calm.

01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:49.640
Why aren't you calm?

01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:51.200
Why aren't you addressing this?

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:52.200
Why hasn't she apologized?

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:54.200
When is she going to apologize?

01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:56.000
When are you going to apologize?

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Never Becky.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.280
The answer is never.

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.200
At least not to you.

01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:04.960
Someone on my subreddit wrote a really thoughtful essay on the whole situation and here is a

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:05.960
quote from that.

01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:10.640
Abuse should always be a part of our analysis and we should be aware every single second

01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:14.880
that we participate in these conversations that our actions have the potential to excuse

01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:16.400
or perpetuate abuse.

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:18.220
We should take responsibility for that.

01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:21.040
Take steps to mitigate it and hold ourselves accountable.

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:23.720
This is why I have such distrust for the position.

01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:25.480
Why should I have to talk about abuse?

01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:27.560
I'm not personally abusing anyone.

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:31.280
You should have distrust for that position because that is exactly what they said to

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:33.800
me during gamergate.

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:34.420
Sucks.

01:22:34.420 --> 01:22:35.420
Same thing.

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:44.940
What follows in campaigns like this is the other isolation tactic.

01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:47.440
Targeting your colleagues, friends, and loved ones.

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:48.800
This comes in two flavors.

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:53.520
Demanding that the colleagues of the accused answer for their crimes or trying to deplatform

01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:58.400
said colleagues because you're already riding high off the previous victory, so who's

01:22:58.400 --> 01:22:59.400
next?

01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:00.560
Sara Zett is next.

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:02.200
Jenny Nicholson is next.

01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:03.720
ContraPoints is next.

01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:05.520
Jenny in par-fucking-ticular.

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.520
Jenny is next.

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:07.520
Jenny, you're next.

01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:08.520
Jenny, next.

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.520
Jenny, next.

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:10.520
Jenny, next.

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:15.320
Both Jenny Nicholson and ContraPoints were trending at certain points during the weekend

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:16.320
because of me.

01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:21.400
Faked screenshots of a racist tweet that Jenny never made spread like wildfire with the goal

01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:24.820
of getting her driven off of Twitter because of me.

01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:28.280
And a year and a half ago, the shoe was on the other foot because a lot of the same crowd

01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:29.900
was attacking Natalie.

01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:33.420
It must needs be remarked that a huge contingent of the people who have it out for me right

01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:39.260
now hate me for sticking by Natalie during the Angel Buck incident about 18 months ago.

01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:42.980
And if you want to know more about that, here's the thingy thingy.

01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:47.220
And it's really only now that I can make sense of it that I got so many hate follows after

01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:51.660
that, that people were so eager to screencap anything and everything I said on Twitter,

01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:56.940
no matter how minor or petty, to create this narrative of me as a secret, horrible person

01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:58.540
just because I stood up for my friend.

01:23:58.540 --> 01:23:59.820
And I don't regret doing it.

01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:00.820
I would do it again.

01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:04.220
But it is insane that I am paying such a high price for that now.

01:24:04.220 --> 01:24:08.400
And now my other colleagues are being targeted for no other reason than the crime of being

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:13.340
friends with me, for not publicly denouncing me, for not validating their anger.

01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:14.340
And why?

01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:18.700
Jenny is one of the smartest, most insightful people I know.

01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:22.360
Sarah always floors me with how much research and nuance and sensitivity she brings to her

01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:23.360
topics.

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:25.020
And she's only 22.

01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:28.940
Natalie is, well, she's a whore, but she's my whore.

01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:33.460
These obsessive campaigns to try to push these narratives of my friends as bad people and

01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:37.540
secret TERFs and secret racists are just baffling to me.

01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:42.220
Global fascism is on the rise on a level we haven't seen in more than a generation.

01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:47.780
Are there not enough out and proud racists that you feel you need to unmask the My Little

01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:49.100
Pony YouTuber?

01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:51.820
Jenny next, Jenny next, Jenny next.

01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:55.940
So do not give me this horseshit about accountability.

01:24:55.940 --> 01:24:58.580
This is obviously just entertainment to you.

01:24:58.580 --> 01:25:00.220
Just fucking own it.

01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:05.700
Obsessively chronicling every perceived misstep we've ever made that could be interpreted

01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:10.820
badly all while completely ignoring the rest of our entire bodies of work.

01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:13.160
Why are you wasting so much energy on this?

01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:16.540
Because you can't impact people who are actually doing your community harm.

01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:18.060
You can't shame the shameless.

01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:19.940
Trump will never face justice.

01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:22.180
Brett Kavanaugh's on the Supreme Court for life.

01:25:22.180 --> 01:25:24.440
Ben Shapiro gets off on your outrage.

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:26.980
So you shame those who can be shamed.

01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:30.500
And if you call one of us bigoted enough times, people will start to believe it.

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:34.980
And then you can feel like you solved racism by spreading lies about a person you have

01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:40.060
never met and never will and was doing you and your community no harm.

01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:41.060
Well done.

01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:42.060
Shabosh.

01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:43.700
Good job.

01:25:43.700 --> 01:25:46.740
Fuck every single one of you.

01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:49.240
You do not deserve grace.

01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:55.740
You do not deserve sympathy.

01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:58.140
Part eight, the beast.

01:25:58.140 --> 01:26:02.700
So obviously, in my case, the easy thing to do would be eat crow and move on.

01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:08.140
I never would have gotten trending if I hadn't deleted my Twitter account, but I'm not here

01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:11.480
to say a bunch of shit I don't mean because PR.

01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:12.540
Fuck PR.

01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:14.820
You want your precious authenticity?

01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:15.820
Here it is.

01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:19.100
There's a danger to normalizing the insincere apology.

01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:24.260
And if we normalize acting like PR bots and dole out disingenuous apologies whenever they

01:26:24.260 --> 01:26:30.980
are demanded for any reason, valid or invalid, any harm, real or imagined, then this isn't

01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:31.980
discourse.

01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:33.380
This is performance.

01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:37.520
The reason campaigns like this gain traction is because they prey on communities that try

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:39.740
to operate in good faith.

01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:44.380
They take advantage of people's goodwill and they condition cynicism.

01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:46.260
So inevitably people harden over.

01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:48.140
They default to skepticism.

01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:53.400
Even this fucking woman of color who harangued Kat Black demanding that she answer for collaborating

01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:54.680
with such a racist?

01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:55.980
Well, guess what?

01:26:55.980 --> 01:27:00.720
That person eventually fessed up to being a white man before deleting his account because,

01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:03.040
you know, listen to POC.

01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:07.860
People are so obsessed with identity as a rhetorical trump card, you can't even take

01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:11.280
it on good faith that people are who they say they are anymore.

01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:15.600
And they take that desire to do right and exploit it because it makes them feel powerful.

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:17.560
This is the real mask off.

01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:18.720
You're next, Jenny.

01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:19.900
You're next, Sarah.

01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:21.280
You're next, Natalie.

01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:24.280
Because running women off Twitter is fun.

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:27.000
I mean, accountability.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:33.000
So militantly performing allyship by rooting out corruption like it's the fucking Red Scare,

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.480
sharing doctored screenshots of tweets that don't exist and willfully misinterpreting

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:43.400
things to prove that the My Little Pony YouTuber is a secret racist?

01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:46.840
Deep down, you know you're just doing it for clout, right?

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:51.140
You should be sensitive to marginalized groups and you should be constantly advocating for

01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:56.900
a more just world and against racism because we all have the stink on us.

01:27:56.900 --> 01:27:59.760
But that should be the goal in itself.

01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:05.200
Not performing on Twitter so people can reassure you you're one of the good ones.

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:08.420
So you can get max retweets for an awesome dunk.

01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:09.640
I am not innocent.

01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:11.100
I have done this.

01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:16.500
And as content creators, our behavior online turns from due diligence into threat modeling.

01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:18.460
And I'm not playing this game anymore.

01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:23.460
Trying to stay 18 steps ahead of the worst possible interpretation of my words or actions

01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:25.380
isn't taking accountability.

01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:27.380
It's just self-defense.

01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:29.720
It's just protecting the brand.

01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:34.220
And I understand why there is this lingering culture of distrust, especially among communities

01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:35.220
of color.

01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:39.220
But it is the height of dishonesty to suggest that the kind of atmosphere where everything

01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:42.580
is taken in bad faith leads to a more just world.

01:28:42.580 --> 01:28:46.020
I'm not furious because I'm uniquely wronged.

01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:47.240
I will be fine.

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:49.420
I didn't actually lose anything.

01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:55.720
I could have pretended nothing happened and probably be better off because nobody cares

01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:57.940
about the fucking Raya tweet.

01:28:57.940 --> 01:29:03.080
I'm furious because this keeps happening and we have deluded ourselves into thinking that

01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:08.960
savaging each other for the smallest transgression and the most minor disagreement is helping

01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:10.800
right the wrongs of the world.

01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:14.920
That there's this broad refusal to admit that our systems that operate on good faith are

01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:16.800
very often abused.

01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:20.380
I was going to include a section about other people from more marginalized groups than

01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:26.260
me who are held to an even higher standard of purity, who have lost way more than I have

01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:29.120
for equally minor perceived transgressions.

01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:33.500
But you know, you probably already know some and they probably don't want me using their

01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:34.500
names anyway.

01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:37.960
But I feel like I need to impress that I didn't start getting noticeable harassment from the

01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:43.300
Purity Tester Brigade until I stood up for a trans woman on Twitter over, and I cannot

01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:48.040
express this enough, a situation that did not deserve anything approaching the level

01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:50.180
of outrage that it fostered.

01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:55.620
And that backlash did not come from the alt-right or even the diet Nazis, but our own community.

01:29:55.620 --> 01:29:58.520
Our side.

01:29:58.520 --> 01:29:59.520
This is why they win.

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:01.740
A friend of mine named it The Beast.

01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:05.280
The name for this fear that we all live under but don't acknowledge.

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:09.820
And over the last few years, I have had so many of my colleagues, all of them women,

01:30:09.820 --> 01:30:14.560
people of color, trans people, queer people, or some combination of the above, voice to

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:19.360
me the constant anxiety that they live with about maybe saying something wrong that will

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:21.940
get them on the bad side of their own communities.

01:30:21.940 --> 01:30:24.000
Every thought is a hostage situation.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.260
Is this the tweet that's going to sink me?

01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:27.540
So what do we call it?

01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:31.900
What is the name for this unspoken, unacknowledged culture of fear where we all know that one

01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:34.060
misstep can ruin our lives?

01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:38.980
This social media culture where we participate in the public shaming one day and become chained

01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:40.340
to the pillory the next.

01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:43.140
We can't even talk about it because The Beast does not have a name.

01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:46.900
If we admit that this is a problem, then the right will just take it and run with it and

01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:49.120
use it to increase their own power.

01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:50.660
Same as they did with cancel.

01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:52.200
Same as they did with woke.

01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:53.620
Same as they did with fake news.

01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:55.580
If it has a name, then it has power.

01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:58.440
So it is a discussion that cannot be had.

01:30:58.440 --> 01:30:59.660
And so we do not have it.

01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:03.540
We say cancel culture doesn't exist and ignore this disease.

01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:05.940
Pretend it isn't doing real harm.

01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:10.120
Not just to individuals who are targeted, but to the state of discourse in general.

01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:14.780
And especially to individuals in marginalized groups, because they are always held to the

01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:18.860
highest standard of purity and they always have the most to lose.

01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:21.900
It isn't even about saying something tone-deaf or insensitive.

01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:27.340
A mere difference in opinion might get you fired from your job if enough people raise

01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:28.660
a stink about it.

01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:31.720
And just so we're clear, I'm not really even talking about me.

01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:33.380
I will be fine.

01:31:33.380 --> 01:31:38.460
But living under the shadow of the beast makes it hard to just create at all.

01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:44.260
A big factor in why it takes us so long to do a single video is threat modeling.

01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:49.020
Because god forbid you say something mildly positive about one of the bad ones that you

01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:51.160
did not know were bad.

01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:56.060
So much of the work we do is getting ahead of any potential misstep by adding like 1800

01:31:56.060 --> 01:31:59.560
caveats and acknowledgments and it's never enough.

01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:03.340
Angelina and I were collaborating with fellow author and essayist Jeanette Ng on a video

01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:07.560
about the live-action Mulan that Jeanette was co-writing and was going to co-host.

01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:12.280
And we'd been working on it for months and right after this happened I was like, we have

01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:13.720
to scrap this video.

01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:16.340
But then after a few days I was like, for what?

01:32:16.340 --> 01:32:21.000
Because a bunch of Twitter teens are gonna call me a racist for criticizing a movie nobody

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.000
likes?

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.400
Y'all were gonna do that either way.

01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:28.020
Believe me, I know that this video is not going to change any minds.

01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:33.340
It's going to make a lot of people very angry and I hope they get lots of engagement.

01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:34.620
I hope they see.

01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:37.020
I wish you all of the retweets.

01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:38.540
But I can't stay ahead of it anymore.

01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:43.380
I'm not going to do the performance of avoiding offense, of staying 500 steps ahead of everything

01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:46.260
that might be misread or misinterpreted.

01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:50.020
Not because it's the right thing to do, but just to protect my brand.

01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:51.020
Fuck my brand.

01:32:51.020 --> 01:32:54.180
I will do the due diligence, but I'm done with threat modeling.

01:32:54.180 --> 01:32:55.420
I just don't care anymore.

01:32:55.420 --> 01:33:00.160
If you want to read bigoted dog whistles into everything I say, go with God.

01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:05.880
If you want to pass my list of sins to everyone who so much as mentions me in a positive way,

01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:07.660
I hope it brings you peace.

01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:12.580
If you want to speculate on my private life, I hope it brings you much profit.

01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:15.360
I hope you accrue much social capital.

01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:18.920
I personally choose to take a page from the book of my political enemies.

01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:23.940
You can't shame the shameless, so I'm going to use the term cancel in its original vernacular

01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:24.940
meeting.

01:33:25.460 --> 01:33:29.440
I'm canceling shame, and I will fuck with shame no more forever.

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:33.460
So if anything, thank you for liberating me from giving a fuck.

01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:39.460
Part 9.

01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:40.460
What Now?

01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:45.860
I want to acknowledge that I got dozens if not hundreds of messages of support in private

01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:48.500
through Patreon, Instagram, and email.

01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:54.340
And while not all of them were 100% you did nothing wrong, I would be remiss not to acknowledge

01:33:54.340 --> 01:33:55.340
that.

01:33:55.340 --> 01:33:58.140
Some of them genuinely made me cry with how kind they were.

01:33:58.140 --> 01:34:03.060
Even some of the ones who were critical of what I said were done with a sense of empathy.

01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:08.300
And I'm sorry I didn't respond to most of you, but just know I read all of your messages.

01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:11.820
And friendly reminder, I will be fine.

01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:12.820
Until my liver gives out.

01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:16.080
This is like the 800th time something like this has happened to me.

01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:17.600
But am I done with Twitter?

01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:18.980
Basically, yeah.

01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:23.220
I honestly intended to be forever done with Twitter, but I was then reminded that I am

01:34:23.220 --> 01:34:27.340
contractually obligated to promote my books through social.

01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:31.140
Contractually obligated pre-order link for my second book in the description.

01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:36.420
So I'll still use it for that sort of thing, and I will continue using it to promote smaller

01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:41.540
creators and authors when I find something that I think deserve attention.

01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:43.740
And also shameless nepotism.

01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:45.260
People calling me a nepotist.

01:34:45.260 --> 01:34:47.260
How dare you say a thing that is true?

01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:52.460
But my biggest mistake was using Twitter in the way that a lot of my friends who had way

01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:54.420
fewer followers than me did.

01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:59.180
Like yeah, I can be a little edgy, I can make jokey jokes, I can just be, you know, I can

01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:01.780
be like one of the boys.

01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:04.500
And I should have stopped doing that a long time ago.

01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:08.620
Worse, Twitter is just a recipe for both addiction and misery.

01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:11.020
They call it doomscrolling for a reason.

01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:15.760
Like even in the last couple weeks, I feel like my brain is having to rewire just this

01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:18.340
impulse to constantly be checking Twitter.

01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:20.380
And it was making me a shittier person.

01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:24.100
I was getting in fights with people more and more, I was dunking on people more and

01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:27.540
more, I was clapping back at followers more and more.

01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:30.140
Like one other person I owe an apology to is Moviebob.

01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:34.780
I told him on Twitter to leave me alone because he was acting like a creep by being over-familiar

01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:39.980
and continually signaling to the world that we're friends, and he was acting like a creep

01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:41.460
and we're not friends.

01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:45.260
But I would have never done that if I had known that the diet Nazis were gonna turn

01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:46.260
that into a meme.

01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:50.200
Like I don't like a lot of what he says on Twitter either, but please stop using my face

01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:52.280
to torture this man, leave him alone.

01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:55.660
So at its core, this was a wakeup call.

01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:58.800
And that is why I deleted my account.

01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:01.520
Part and it can happen to you.

01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:06.640
I want to reaffirm that the roots of this do stem from a rise in anti-Asian racism,

01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:09.020
and that racism is very real.

01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:13.600
As I was writing this video, a friend of mine on Facebook posted a screencap of this truly

01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:19.280
heinous thing that Mike Huckabee said, which not only regurgitates this inane conservative

01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:25.040
garbage about identity politics, it completely dismisses the very real wave of hate that

01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:26.880
is happening in America right now.

01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:31.960
And he posted it with this comment, white people, please pay attention every day.

01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:37.360
A person of color has to look at something like this or worse every literal day.

01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:38.360
Try.

01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:41.440
Just try to imagine what that would do to your psyche.

01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:43.040
And it hurt to read.

01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:48.200
And honestly, it hurts for me to even read out loud right now because it's true.

01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:51.040
I literally only can imagine.

01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:56.220
Few of the people stoking anti-Asian violence right now will suffer consequences and probably

01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:58.520
more racist attacks will occur.

01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:04.800
And this is just another chapter in our country's long, sad history of anti-Asian racism.

01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:09.620
And the reality is there's not a lot we as individuals can do about that.

01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:12.420
We live in a fundamentally unjust world.

01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:14.120
I do acknowledge that.

01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:18.280
And at the beginning, anyway, a lot of the frustration at the original tweet did stem

01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:19.280
from that.

01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:22.600
And I don't want to dismiss all public feedback as inevitably harassment.

01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:27.640
I think it's important to retain this nuance, lest we always frame the issue of harassment

01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:30.920
as a blanket condemnation of the public and public feedback.

01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:34.900
But I also cannot stress enough how quickly this whole situation went from valid criticism

01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:41.360
rooted in real hurt to straight up abuse and not just of me, of my friends, my colleagues,

01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:46.280
this disease that is Twitter enacting the same passion play again and again and again.

01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:50.240
Even people who were sympathetic to me, they still wanted to attribute the hate to one

01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:56.120
thing, you know, one slip of the tongue, one bad take, one wrong affiliation, one wrong

01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:57.120
tone I took.

01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:03.540
I've seen so many people try to rationalize it even when they think I did nothing wrong.

01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:08.100
But the reality is what gets you on the radar of the mob is nothing.

01:38:08.100 --> 01:38:14.660
A picture, a joke, a comment, just existing as a woman, a person of color, a woman of

01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:21.540
color, a queer person doing your job, one unpopular opinion, a poorly aged take, being

01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:26.700
online for too long, being associated with the wrong person, saying something nice about

01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:28.220
the wrong person.

01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:31.040
Sometimes all it takes is being successful.

01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:34.560
People want to rationalize your mistakes and list them and label them not because it has

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:37.100
anything ultimately to do with you.

01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:38.360
It doesn't.

01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:42.820
But because they want to reassure themselves that it will never happen to them, that it

01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:45.140
will never be them on the pillory.

01:38:45.140 --> 01:38:49.100
So even if you don't think I did anything wrong, if you can still pin this on a specific

01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:53.280
error, then you can distance yourself and sleep well that you would know better than

01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:55.100
to make the same mistake.

01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:56.720
And it would never happen to you.

01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:58.500
And that's just not how it works.

01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:03.340
Part of what makes Twitter so toxic is the sense of hopelessness it engenders.

01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:08.500
You're exposed to this never-ending stream of bad news and constant examples of how fucked

01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:14.020
the world is and reminders that you have the power to affect very little change.

01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:18.240
That compounded with the fact that platforms like Twitter rely mostly on shorthand and

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:22.500
are constantly encouraging you to produce and encourage knee-jerk reactions with very

01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:27.540
little context means that hopelessness and powerlessness and aggression, it's got to

01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:28.760
go somewhere.

01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:32.380
And on March 26, 2021, it got funneled to me.

01:39:32.380 --> 01:39:37.620
And I cannot in good faith say I have not done the same, mindlessly joined in on a dog

01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:42.560
pile on someone who said something stupid or insensitive because it felt good.

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:45.600
And for a brief moment, it gave me a sense of power.

01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:49.140
But then that moment is gone and the world is still shitty.

01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:54.300
And that person's life, whatever their infraction was, deserved or undeserved, is marginally

01:39:54.300 --> 01:39:57.180
worse for my involvement in it.

01:39:57.180 --> 01:39:59.140
And that is why I'm stepping away.

01:39:59.140 --> 01:40:03.860
So for all of the people who used me as their outlet for their pain and aggression on that

01:40:03.860 --> 01:40:09.660
crisp spring morn, I understand that you feel hopeless and powerless in an increasingly

01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:11.360
shitty world.

01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:16.180
And I understand that there is a reason to assume bad faith when so many other people

01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:18.060
have let you down.

01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:25.100
And the only thing I can do for you is extend the same grace and compassion that you extended

01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:25.600
to me.

01:40:29.140 --> 01:40:31.140
Thank you.
