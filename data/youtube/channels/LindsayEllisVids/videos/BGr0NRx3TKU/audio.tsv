0	5200	Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Power Broker, Robert Moses, and The Fall of New
5200	9560	York, Robert A. Caro, is widely considered one of the world's foremost experts on the
9560	11400	subject of power.
11400	16960	Caro won the Pulitzer for Nonfiction in 1974 by revealing how New York City urban planner
16960	21680	Robert Moses, despite never having been elected to any public office, was able to slowly and
21680	25920	steadily accrue so much power that not only did he become the greatest shaper of New York
25920	31680	City in the 20th century, he also exerted massive influence on all American cities.
31680	36320	Widely liked and respected in his time, The Power Broker destroyed Moses' reputation,
36320	40880	painting him as a power-hungry totalitarian that destroyed communities.
40880	43280	And he died in disgrace some ten years later.
43280	47160	But according to Caro, it was not his profile of Robert Moses that truly revealed to him
47160	52200	the nature of power, but his acclaimed chronicle of the life of Lyndon B. Johnson, which currently
52200	56120	stands at four volumes and 1.5 million words.
56120	57120	According to Caro,
57120	62720	We're taught Lord Acton's axiom, all power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.
62720	66680	I believed that when I started these books, but I don't believe it's always true anymore.
66680	70680	What I believe is always true about power is that power always reveals.
70680	74480	When you have enough power to do what you always wanted to do, then you see what the
74480	76000	guy always wanted to do.
83200	87560	So, what was the point of all that?
87560	92040	And by all that, of course, I mean the thing we've spent the last eight seasons obsessing
92040	98720	over and are now months late getting to our spicy hot takes.
98720	99720	That's right, bitches.
99720	101680	The Funyuns are back.
101680	106160	And some say that stories don't need to have a point, or weren't intended to have a point.
106160	110960	But I have to assume this one was intended to have a point, since it ended with a dragon
110960	114840	burning the symbolism.
114840	118840	But for such a character-driven show, really, the main issues boil down to that.
118840	120120	The characters.
120120	122560	And we will start with the fact that by the end of the show...
122560	129880	So it seems like D&D outlined a lot of plot points without giving much thought as to how
129880	133120	characters might be motivated to reach those plot points.
133120	138040	So a huge chunk of season 8 is spent on dialogue, rationalizing plot points that don't really
138040	139040	make sense.
139040	143440	There still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day.
143440	144720	She left her no choice.
144720	147360	The moment the gates fell, the battle was over.
147360	149640	She saw her friend beheaded.
149640	151360	She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.
151360	153320	And she burned down a city for it.
153320	156960	And they kind of know they don't make sense, so they have to spend a lot of time rationalizing
156960	157960	them.
157960	162240	He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories.
162240	166040	In order for the plot to progress as outlined, everyone, especially characters who in earlier
166040	170080	seasons were defined by their cunning and intelligence, decay into total dummy-whummies
170080	172640	by season 8.
172640	177400	This was, you might say, foreshadowed in season 7 by Littlefinger's downfall, which only works
177400	183480	if every character involved in this subplot took a bunch of stupid pills.
183480	187200	Littlefinger doesn't like that Arya's back, so he tries to pit the two sisters against
187200	190960	each other, and it looks like Sansa bought it for some reason, despite knowing what an
190960	195960	untrustworthy asshat he is, but ah, no, switcheroo.
195960	201440	You stand accused of murder, you stand accused of treason.
201440	207840	How do you answer these charges, Lord Baelish?
207840	212920	And lo, everyone, knocked down many an intelligence unit, watches this worthless subplot bleed
212920	217320	out on the floor because the character of Littlefinger is redundant now, and we don't
217320	220480	know what to do with him, so goodbye.
220480	226160	So it takes Arya and Sansa an entire season to realize they're being played over… nothing,
226160	227360	basically.
227360	231360	But here, in season 7, everyone caught a case in the dumb-dumbs, which only worsens in season
231360	232360	8.
232360	234760	While Dany kind of forgot about the Iron Fleet.
234760	238360	And the idea that the sisters were onto Littlefinger, and were just playing along the whole time
238360	240840	is good headcanon in theory, but…
240840	244320	Well, here's a quote from Isaac Hempstead Wright, who plays Bran.
244320	248240	We actually did a scene that clearly got cut, a short scene with Sansa where she knocks
248240	251540	on Bran's door and says, I need your help, or something along those lines.
251540	255280	So basically, as far as I know, the story was that it suddenly occurred to Sansa that
255280	259400	she had a huge CCTV department at her discretion, and it might be a good idea to check with
259400	261640	him first before she guts her own sister.
261640	271240	So she goes to Bran, and Bran tells her everything she needs to know, and she's like, oh shi-
271400	274120	No, Sansa.
274120	275880	You have been done dirty.
275880	283480	I know that after the shitshow that was season 5, some Sansa stans are happy that at least
283480	287480	one of the women got to be in charge without having to be put down like old Yeller, but
287480	291720	if we may for a moment be honest with ourselves, her entire character has been one massive
291720	297000	trainwreck ever since season 5, when Littlefinger's like, hey, marry the son of the guy who murdered
297000	299900	your entire family, and she's like, noooooo.
299900	300900	Okay.
300920	305080	She begins the fast track to rape town, escape, and then season 7 she completes her evolution
305080	310240	into Ladyfinger, stripped of all pathos, because to D&D, female empowerment is shedding your
310240	315640	humanity until you are a stone cold badass, but you know, the kind who only does some
315640	318280	hideously inhumane executions.
318280	320640	Feminism.
320640	325000	To be clear, I am not on the Sansa hate train, I just think they popped a squat over her
325000	327800	character arc just like they did everyone else.
327800	331940	By season 8, everyone's gushing over how smart Sansa is, she's evolved into her
331940	336100	final form, but unlike in earlier seasons, where her intelligence would come out through
336100	346620	these moments of her being more quick thinking than people expected, or by her playing into
346620	367400	her enemies' arrogance, she now gets these cool-girl-badass moments that build not at
367400	371440	all on the lessons she learned in King's Landing, but instead on violence and a need
371440	373120	to humiliate her enemies.
373120	376940	One of Sansa's earlier defining attributes was her compassion, that she cared about people
376940	378880	despite the pain she was put through.
378880	382860	In the books, she never loses that sense of compassion, but gets smarter about figuring
382860	386680	out who is worthy of it, and who is playing her for their own advantage.
386680	391060	Here in the show, that warmth is totally extinguished, Sansa's compassion and appeals to goodness
391060	401740	are framed not as a strength, but as immature weakness that she needs to outgrow.
401740	405980	New Empowerment Sansa doesn't act like someone who would take pity on a drunk knight, risking
405980	409860	Joffrey's wrath, or someone who would have any ounce of empathy for someone like the
409860	412100	Hound like she did in season 2.
412100	414860	Sansa and the Crypts doesn't bother trying to calm the other women and children like
414860	418020	she did during the siege of King's Landing in season 2.
418020	426260	New Empowerment Sansa spends the whole battle trash-talking Daenerys, who, unlike Sansa,
426260	432580	is out there risking her life.
432580	439180	Season 8 keeps telling us what Sansa is, that she's smart, that she's shrewd, but nothing
439180	441220	in her actions support that.
441220	445460	Earlier Sansa would know to keep her mouth shut about someone she was suspicious of.
445460	448980	Meanwhile, New Empowerment Sansa won't shut the fuck up about how much she doesn't like
448980	451660	Daenerys.
451660	456040	During Sansa's entire King's Landing storyline, she keeps herself alive by feigning loyalty
456040	464160	to Joffrey and Cersei.
464160	468480	Even if she did plan on undermining Daenerys, I guess D&D kind of forgot that one of Sansa's
468480	474840	most important lessons is one to feign respect and fidelity.
474840	477720	Sansa's evolution mirrors the Starks as a whole.
477720	481760	The compassion and nobility that define the Starks is one of their biggest assets, but
481760	493840	in the end, they're no better than the fucking Lannisters.
493840	497960	Change their house motto from Winter is Coming to Fuck You Got Mine.
497960	500280	Because that's female empowerment to these showrunners.
500280	503200	I'm glad I got raped, actually, Mr. The Hound.
503200	513520	It made me a cool girl badass.
513520	518400	So Sansa is a northern separatist now for some fucking reason, even though now is not
518400	519400	the time.
519400	524200	Do they remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north?
524200	526260	Yeah, nothing.
526260	527260	Nothing happened.
527260	530420	When Aegon the Conqueror invaded, the north bent the knee immediately and joined the Seven
530420	533020	Kingdoms without a fight, and nobody died.
533020	535240	The countryside was not burninated.
535240	538300	The king at the time was called the King Who Knelt for a reason.
538300	539940	I guess someone kind of forgot.
539940	544140	Do they remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north?
544140	545940	One season earlier.
545940	552220	But I could have sworn I read, the last king in the north was Torrhen Stark, who bent the
552220	554500	knee to my ancestor, Aegon Targaryen.
554500	558260	There are cases to be made for an independent north doing well in the past, but this whole
558260	562740	situation in Winterfell we have written for season 8, it uh, it actually makes a pretty
562740	564660	good case for United Seven Kingdoms.
564660	566660	We needed her army.
566660	567660	Her dragons.
567660	569180	Yep, you sure did.
569180	572600	How are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen?
572600	575860	Good thing we've got the Reach, a part of the Seven Kingdoms, which also happens to
575860	577580	support Daenerys's claim.
577580	580980	And it wasn't even that they had it on lock before Daenerys showed up with all these mouths
580980	581980	to feed.
581980	585660	You're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north
585660	587780	come back to defend Winterfell.
587780	591180	How are we going to feed our own people was a problem at the beginning of the season that
591180	593900	is set up and promptly ignored.
593900	595620	What do dragons eat, anyway?
595620	597660	You know what Sansa, it doesn't matter.
597660	599740	Don't worry your empowered little head about it.
599740	603180	Enjoy those dragons and supplies from other regions, now that it's fucking winter and
603180	604900	you all have a common enemy.
604900	607420	You seem determined to dislike her.
607420	610740	Like they did Daenerys dirty, and we'll get to Daenerys, but what they did to Sansa
610740	612220	is just depressing.
612220	616500	Sansa's only purpose this season is to have an unfounded suspicion of Daenerys, which
616500	620220	only proves to be founded when Daenerys does something completely nonsensical.
620540	624580	Otherwise, Daenerys has essentially given all of her resources to defend Winterfell,
624580	627100	based on the promise of the guy in charge.
627100	630460	And Sansa is still like, hmm, I don't know.
630460	632300	I don't like the cut of her jib.
632300	634260	Why her?
634260	638460	By the end of this stupid dumb battle of Winterfell, Daenerys has proved herself worthy of being
638460	641060	a queen about as well as one can expect in this universe.
641060	647180	She's forging alliances, doing battle, keeping her promises to her followers and to her allies.
647180	650140	So Sansa's stink eye over Daenerys makes no sense.
650140	652820	She never even lived through the Targaryens hurting her family.
652820	657820	The operative word, mad king, burned her grandfather and uncle to death.
657820	663060	But she sure did Cersei, you know, their common enemy whose family wiped her own out.
663060	667580	Sansa's mistrust of Daenerys only makes sense if you're writing from the end forward,
667580	672020	telling us she is smart when her intelligence is really just writer clairvoyance.
672020	676260	Giving Sansa suspicions without giving her any reason to have them, other than the writers
676340	679180	know how the show will end and they want Sansa to look smart.
679180	681300	You're the dragon queen.
681300	682980	It's quite beautiful.
682980	685020	What does that have to do with anything?
685020	688500	Or maybe, I don't know, Sansa is jealous because Daenerys is pretty.
688500	690500	Which surely they would never.
690500	693380	Oh, come on.
693380	695780	Anyway, moving on.
695780	706180	Bronn is a fan favorite, but by season 8, no, by season 5, he has nothing to do and
706180	707580	no reason to be here.
707580	709460	But people like him, so here he is.
709460	712220	It seems like they were planning a different ending for Bronn.
712220	715300	Like one that had some character development?
715300	721060	In season 7, during the loot train attack, Bronn loses his gold in a very symbolic moment.
721060	725620	He then leaves it to risk his life in a big way to save Jaime, with no mercenary reason
725620	727100	for doing so.
727100	729020	Is this a sign of character development?
729020	730500	Is Bronn changing his ways?
730500	733580	It's good to see you again.
733580	736140	Yeah, you too.
736140	737140	Nope.
737140	738460	And guess who gets the worst subplot of all time?
738460	739980	You do, you do.
739980	742300	You boys are a pair of gold-plated cunts.
742300	745420	So Cersei asks Bronn to go murder her brothers, as you do.
745420	752660	What will she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers?
752660	756460	Bronn fast travels to Winterfell and holds them at arrow point and tells them he thinks
756460	761220	their side will win because dragons, so he blackmails Jaime and Tyrion into giving him
762220	763220	Highgarden.
763220	764700	You could be Lord of the Reach.
764700	765700	Highgarden?
765700	766700	Are you mad?
766700	767700	It's better than being dead.
767700	771380	Okay, so for those of you playing the home game, Highgarden is the capital of the Reach,
771380	775740	seat of the now-extinct House Tyrell and the breadbasket of the Seven Kingdoms, and the
775740	776740	most populous.
776740	781220	Yes, there are probably still many Tyrells next in line to claim the Reach, to say nothing
781220	785140	of the other great houses in the Reach with a much better claim to the seat.
785140	790100	But yeah, we're gonna install Ser Noname as Lord of Highgarden because of blackmail
790100	792700	under a queen that was only queen for five minutes.
792700	798180	And yeah, that's going to go over well with all these other lesser houses in the Reach.
798180	799500	Highgarden.
799500	803940	But okay, we do not see Bronn again until the finale, where not only is he now the Master
803940	804940	of Coin.
804940	806500	I've never borrowed money before.
806500	808900	I'm not clear on the rules.
808900	812740	But Tyrion has apparently made good on that whole promise made at gunpoint thing.
812740	818180	Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of
818180	821820	Coin.
821820	826140	He should have ridden off into that good night like Dario Naharis, but okay.
826140	827140	Here he is still.
827140	828140	Cool.
828140	832260	And in a season that has turned pretty much all of its characters into stupid dum-dums
832260	836860	who can't read a situation for shit because the plot needs them to be stupid, there's
836860	843700	one character whose tactical nosedive probably hurts the most.
844700	852020	If there's one character who was arguably done dirtier than Daenerys this season, it's
852020	853020	Lord Varys.
853020	858700	If you consider it, the best ruler might be someone who doesn't want to rule.
858700	864060	Varys, the master of whispers, becomes the master of loud, treasonous conversations.
864060	870020	The greater the risk, the greater the reward.
870020	871020	Go on.
871340	874980	Varys is a fan favorite, but the showrunners clearly had no idea what to do with him after
874980	879980	season 4 because his character starts wildly deviating from his path in the books.
879980	883780	You know what it's like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes?
883780	884780	No.
884780	892540	I only know what it's like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.
892540	896820	I guess in his case they'd figured they'd ride around this later, and they did so by
896820	900100	making the smartest guy in the realm a total dum-dum.
900100	904700	Varys in the books wants to instill a guy on the throne who may or may not, and probably
904700	911700	is not, be the lost son of Rhaegar Targaryen, aka Aegon Targaryen, aka the next in line
911700	914740	to the throne if we have a Targaryen restoration.
914740	916540	Fans call him Faegon.
916540	921580	In the show we don't have Faegon, but Varys needs something to do, so at the beginning
921580	927140	of season 5, he and Tyrion cross the narrow sea with the express intent to support Daenerys
927140	937980	Now, even though Varys totally tried to have her assassinated in season 1, apparently she's
937980	945260	willing to move past that.
945260	948940	You know, in a world where executions are routine, this seems like kind of a reasonable
948940	949940	threat.
949940	954940	He has tried to have her assassinated before, and whoop, here we are one season later, again
954940	965220	with the poisoning.
965220	970780	But then, in season 8, he, um, well, she makes a sad face at dinner.
970780	982260	I guess she does ignore his shitty advice, which has consistently been shitty ever since
982260	988140	they got to Westeros, and is in this case, as it turns out, wrong from a tactical perspective.
988140	991060	They do win the battle easily and with minimal casualties.
991060	994620	And no, they didn't actually need to rest, and no, food was never an issue, and resources
994620	997780	were never an issue, so why bother having those conversations?
997780	1010540	But then Varys finds out that Jon Snow is the actual Aegon Targaryen.
1010540	1032660	And you know what, tis the season for some treason.
1032660	1036660	And the best rationale they can come up with for Varys wanting to support Jon over Daenerys
1037660	1042100	the philosophy that the best person to rule is the person who specifically doesn't want
1042100	1043100	to rule.
1043100	1055940	Well, I mean, I guess Jon keeps failing upwards, so that tracks.
1055940	1059020	Imagine nominally being for the good of the realm, and then immediately reversing your
1059020	1064020	stake the moment you see a young guy whose neighborhood townies love him, and be like,
1064020	1070740	wow, yeah, that's some leadership material right there.
1070740	1071740	So here's the problem.
1071740	1075860	This only makes sense if you're the audience, and you've seen Jon Snow's temperament for
1075860	1077420	the last eight seasons.
1077420	1079860	Varys, on the other hand, has not.
1079860	1086140	Varys has no reason to like or trust Jon Snow, other than he liked and trusted Ned, I guess,
1086140	1088420	who wasn't actually his father anyway.
1088420	1093500	Varys only just met Jon Snow, and in-universe has no reason to think that he's a better,
1093500	1097780	more tempered choice than Daenerys, unless he knows what the audience knows.
1097780	1101780	We, the audience, know about Jon Snow, but from the outside looking in, the narrative
1101780	1103020	is all over the place.
1103020	1107140	Jon Snow has only been in charge of the North for, like, a week, and it's kind of been a
1107140	1115020	shitshow.
1115020	1118920	For the first three episodes of the season, she's a war hero with dragons that has sacrificed
1118920	1122140	half her troops and one of those dragons to save humanity.
1122140	1126780	The only thing she does in episode four that's mildly questionable is be impatient about
1126780	1128940	wanting to take King's Landing.
1128940	1131620	Except, she's not wrong about anything.
1131620	1134620	The men we have left are exhausted.
1134620	1137620	They'll fight better if they have time to rest and recuperate.
1137620	1139580	Well, clearly they don't.
1139580	1144380	I promised you I would look you in the eye and speak directly if I ever thought you were
1144380	1145740	making a mistake.
1145740	1149700	Well, maybe your advice shouldn't have been so uniformly bad.
1149700	1153740	Maybe he was mad that she went against his advice, but that particular advice, again,
1153740	1155020	ended up being wrong.
1155020	1159180	King's Landing was stupid easy to take, because battles are easy now, because we need to wrap
1159180	1160180	this shit up.
1160180	1162460	I defended this city last time it was attacked.
1162460	1163820	I know it better than anyone.
1163820	1164980	It will fall tomorrow.
1164980	1166500	Based on what?
1166500	1169180	Those dragons have the fortitude of hummingbirds.
1169180	1172920	Up until now, it seemed pretty evenly matched, but, you know, whatever.
1172920	1177340	So Varys, who has sacrificed all to rally a bunch of power to Daenerys, immediately switches
1177340	1181300	sides the second he discovers that there's a pouty, indecisive male alternative with
1181300	1182300	great hair.
1182300	1187140	But Daenerys has at this point done nothing to make Varys logically want to switch sides.
1187140	1191260	The one time she went against her advisor's advice before this was to save Jon Snow.
1191260	1194900	You know, that guy that Varys wants to betray Daenerys for.
1194900	1200400	And so he starts telling fucking everyone who Jon Snow is, and in doing so, makes more
1200400	1205620	or less the exact same mistake that Ned Stark did in season one, only way stupider.
1205620	1210180	This is way more reckless and way less motivated than what Ned did in season one.
1210180	1211620	Jon fucking abdicated.
1211620	1212900	That is a thing you can do.
1212900	1214620	I don't want it.
1214620	1216100	I never have.
1216100	1219100	Hell, Jon Snow knew a guy who did abdicate.
1219100	1222100	You are Aemon Targaryen.
1222100	1225300	I am a master of the Citadel.
1225300	1227300	Speaking of Jon Snow...
1227300	1234900	Oh, Jon Snow.
1235180	1239260	There's a scene in the second episode of Game of Thrones season one in which Jon Snow asks
1239260	1244180	Ned Stark about his mother, and Ned responds with this restrained, burdened emotion.
1244180	1250180	The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother.
1250180	1253180	I promise.
1253180	1257180	Like this is eventually going to come to something emotionally charged and important.
1265180	1269180	So where do we even start with this?
1269180	1271180	My mom is actually from Napa.
1271180	1272180	I didn't know that.
1272180	1275180	I never knew my mother.
1275180	1280180	In many ways, Jon Snow is emblematic of everything wrong with the way this series handled its resolution.
1280180	1282180	A big, emotional, profound setup.
1282180	1287180	His name is Aegon Targaryen.
1287180	1290180	You have to protect him.
1290180	1292180	Promise me Ned.
1292460	1295460	It's a flaccid, confusing, and meaningless payoff.
1295460	1299460	And from a plot perspective, most of the major letdowns from all of the momentous setup are
1299460	1301460	pretty much tied in with Jon Snow.
1301460	1304460	The White Walker plot, of which Jon was the key point of view character.
1304460	1309460	R plus L equals J, aka the mystery of Jon's parentage, which kind of indirectly kicked
1309460	1312460	off the plot of the whole show.
1312460	1315460	Jon Snow being brought back from the dead by the Lord of Light.
1315740	1323740	And of course, Jon's love for Daenerys, culminating with her, um, murder, done in an uncharacteristically
1323740	1325740	dishonorable way.
1325740	1329740	After Jon Snow is resurrected, they keep making this big deal about how he must have been
1329740	1331740	brought back for a reason.
1331740	1333740	The Lord let you come back for a reason.
1333740	1335740	He wants you alive.
1335740	1336740	Why?
1336740	1337740	I don't know.
1337740	1339740	What, indeed, was the point?
1339740	1343740	Well, considering the f*** all you did during the long night, I'm guessing the Lord brought
1344020	1349020	you back so you could blue ball Daenerys, making her go crazy, and ultimately instill
1349020	1352020	f***ing Bran the Broken on the throne.
1352020	1355020	Good job, Lord of Light.
1355020	1359020	The White Walker plot was this existential threat that had been built up for eight seasons,
1359020	1363020	predicated on a historical long night that lasted an actual generation and nearly wiped
1363020	1364020	out humanity.
1364020	1368020	There came a night that lasted a generation.
1368020	1372020	Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their hoods.
1372300	1376300	The Night King was Jon's principal antagonist, and his main motivation for the run of the
1376300	1377300	show.
1377300	1380620	But not only was the big boss easily stabbed away by a character who had nothing to do
1380620	1385020	with the White Walker plot, but the long night was about as long as a viewing of Titanic
1385020	1388900	with a couple of bathroom breaks thrown in, and instead of nearly wiping out humanity,
1388900	1392900	it wiped out… about one half of one army?
1392900	1396300	What they see is just the end of the Dothraki, essentially.
1396300	1397300	Question mark?
1397300	1400300	Two episodes later- Wait, Lindsay, did you steal my joke again?
1402300	1407620	And we learn that after that's done, it doesn't matter that the world of men was
1407620	1412380	too preoccupied with political squabbles to worry about an endless horde of ice zombies,
1412380	1417980	because all you needed to end the existential threat is the one special knife of no importance.
1417980	1421380	This is a recurring problem which ties in with what we were talking about in the last
1421380	1426500	episode- subverting expectations, despite the fact that it doesn't work for the story.
1426500	1431140	Arya's training as a faceless man builds not at all to this- it could have been anyone
1431260	1435220	with a strong ten-yard jump, and yeah, the fact that the Night King focuses his wrath
1435220	1439500	on Bran and Jon Snow means that Bran and Jon Snow should have been involved here.
1439500	1444260	Doesn't mean that Jon Snow needed to do the stabbing, but he needed some resolution
1444260	1449740	other than spending the battle screaming at his new archenemy, Zombie Dragon.
1449740	1456300	Tangent, I also saw one idea that it should have been Jaime who kills the Night King,
1456300	1460220	you know, bring that whole Kingslayer thing full circle, that would have been cool and
1460220	1464300	give Jaime a reason for existing, but you know, that would also have made sense.
1464300	1468660	Jon's main motivation is farted out of existence without any of his involvement, and after
1468660	1472700	it's over, the only thing that has materially changed, apart from the bloodletting of a
1472700	1477540	couple of supporting characters, is that Daenerys finds out about Jon being a Targaryen, which
1477540	1481420	not only has nothing to do with the White Walkers, or the effect they have in this world,
1481420	1484580	it probably would have happened eventually anyway.
1484580	1489740	But with regard to Jon learning the truth about who he is, he never really reacts to it.
1489940	1491300	You're the true king.
1492580	1496300	Aegon Targaryen, 6th of his name, protector of the realm, all of him.
1496300	1500700	A revelation this momentous, especially to someone like Jon Snow, whose entire identity
1500700	1503660	was wrapped around his bastardness,
1503660	1504860	You're Ned Stark's bastard.
1504860	1506380	Ned Stark's bastard.
1506380	1508140	Ned Stark's bastard.
1508140	1509580	I'm a bastard.
1509580	1512060	Okay, but you don't have to call yourself that though.
1512060	1516380	should merit more of a reaction than frowns.
1516540	1520380	There's no moment where he sits down and really parses this, discusses it with anyone.
1520380	1524140	Sansa and Arya in particular don't seem to care about the implication this has for their
1524140	1528700	family history, that the stories they heard about their aunt their whole life were a lie,
1528700	1531860	that their father lied to them, that the rift in their parents' marriage was based on
1531860	1537580	a falsehood, that Ned had remained faithful to Cat, but sacrificed his honor and basically
1537580	1539420	his marriage to protect Jon.
1539420	1544380	No, in the end, Jon reacts to this news like he's just been served jury duty, learning
1544380	1548460	that he was not only legitimate, but was loved and wanted from the moment of his birth,
1548460	1553420	has no effect on his identity or sense of self-worth, and is only addressed in the utilitarian
1553420	1557580	question of birthright and primogeniture, to which he immediately hops to
1557580	1559500	You are my queen.
1559500	1564260	and not wanting it is his sole motivation for the rest of the show.
1564260	1568380	They keep trying to force this ending to make sense vis-a-vis Jon's motivation.
1568380	1570380	Love is the death of duty.
1570380	1574700	Because if we had to have this ending, Tyrion is the one who feels responsible for the war
1574700	1575860	crimes here.
1575860	1580420	If we must put the bitch down like old Yeller, it should have been Tyrion that did it, not
1580420	1581780	Jon Snow.
1581780	1586780	Instead of Tyrion being the little finger to Jon Snow's Lysa Arryn.
1586780	1588180	I love her too.
1588180	1589180	Yuck.
1589180	1593460	By the end, Jon Snow's character has been reduced to a gelatinous mess because he doesn't
1593460	1594460	want anything.
1594460	1597500	He has no motivation after the Night King is gone.
1597500	1604980	This is a problem he has in common with Tyrion's path from the book diverges around the beginning
1604980	1606140	of season 5.
1606140	1609580	In the books, Tyrion's departure from Westeros makes it pretty obvious he's on the path
1609580	1612620	to vengeance and drinking himself into an early grave.
1612620	1616180	But around this point in the series, the showrunners decided that it's more important for Tyrion
1616180	1621100	to be an audience avatar, the voice of reason, a nice guy, and here he shall remain until
1621100	1623420	the last agonizing moments of the series.
1623420	1626600	There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story.
1626600	1630320	And characters being wrong in a story is not bad.
1630320	1633840	Character flaws are a good thing, but Tyrion over the course of these three seasons is
1633840	1639040	so consistently terrible at his job that he should have been, at minimum, fired a while
1639040	1640040	ago.
1640040	1643360	Instead, Tyrion just hatches one bad plan after another.
1643360	1645560	And Daenerys keeps him on for some reason.
1645560	1649180	Let's go invade Casterly Rock, a place with no tactical advantage.
1649180	1653040	Let's not attack King's Landing now, before they can bolster their armies.
1653040	1654040	You're too valuable.
1654040	1655040	It's too great a risk.
1655040	1656040	You're too important.
1656040	1657040	Let's trust Cersei.
1657040	1661040	She's pregnant, which means she's good and trustworthy now.
1661040	1663040	Let's not go rescue Jon Snow.
1663040	1664040	He's not worth it.
1664040	1669040	Let's go hide in the fucking crypts while an army with the power to raise the dead is
1669040	1670040	attacking us.
1670040	1675040	He's bringing all the dead people back to life, and they put women and children in a
1675040	1678040	crypt with all the dead people.
1678040	1680040	So, brah.
1680040	1683040	Tyrion is smart, but I guess not that smart.
1683040	1688040	If you rewatch season 7, it seems like they're setting up a Tyrion-betrays-Daenerys twist.
1688040	1691040	Like, actually betrays her, not this piddling squirt of nothing.
1691040	1695040	A betrayal twist would have at least explained why his powers of deduction got pushed out
1695040	1696040	of a window.
1697040	1699040	You're not a monster.
1699040	1702040	Two seasons earlier?
1702040	1705040	My expectations have been subverted.
1706040	1707040	Kill me.
1714040	1721040	I kept waiting for anything Tyrion did this season to make sense, especially with regard
1721040	1722040	to Cersei.
1722040	1726040	You crossed the narrow sea with the intent of dethroning your sister.
1726040	1729040	How else did you see this ending?
1729040	1733040	I watched the people of King's Landing rebel against their king when they were hungry,
1733040	1735040	and that was before winter began.
1735040	1739040	Give them the opportunity, and they will cast Cersei aside.
1739040	1742040	Yes, a short but violent siege is bad.
1742040	1744040	Mass starvation is much better.
1744040	1749040	And Tyrion, why are you so horrified with the prospect of killing innocent or honorable
1749040	1750040	people all of a sudden?
1751040	1753040	Those are brave men knocking at our door.
1755040	1756040	Let's go kill them!
1756040	1761040	It's only because Dragon Lady bad that Tyrion has a completely out-of-character concern
1761040	1764040	for the innocence of King's Landing.
1764040	1769040	I saved this city and all your worthless lives.
1769040	1773040	And the opposing side, and this pity party for Cersei where he keeps trying to save her
1773040	1778040	life, even though it makes no sense for Tyrion to want to see his sister anything but dead.
1778040	1783040	The reign is over, but that doesn't mean your life has to end.
1783040	1784040	Why?
1784040	1786040	Why, why, why, why, why?
1786040	1787040	Why do you care?
1787040	1790040	Tyrion, you've given her like 200 chances to surrender.
1790040	1794040	Who cares that she's pregnant, which she has been for approximately two years and has
1794040	1796040	not yet started to show.
1796040	1797040	Weird that.
1797040	1801040	Tyrion was likely originally intended to be a corrupting influence on Daenerys and or
1801040	1807040	play up both his and her vindictive tendencies, especially after coming off his wildly successful
1807040	1810040	kill everyone in King's Landing speech.
1810040	1814040	I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you.
1814040	1818040	I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.
1818040	1823040	Hence this red priestess stink eye here, foreshadowing that ultimately goes nowhere.
1823040	1826040	And I suppose this could have played nicely into the theme of vengeance as a self-destructive
1826040	1832040	force, but dang you Peter Dinklage, you're just so ding dong dang likable.
1832040	1837040	Sacrificing any gray area or moral ambivalence turns Tyrion into the worst thing he can be.
1837040	1838040	Boring.
1843040	1847040	And it begs the question, what does Tyrion even want?
1847040	1849040	Why do you want Cersei deposed?
1849040	1852040	Because it kind of seems like maybe you don't.
1852040	1854040	I don't want to destroy our family.
1854040	1855040	I never have.
1856040	1858040	Five seasons earlier?
1858040	1860040	How much of this show has there been?
1860040	1862040	I will hurt you for this.
1862040	1869040	The day will come when you think you're safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth.
1869040	1874040	Never mind the show dropping the Tysha subplot after season one or TV Shea getting murdered
1874040	1878040	or literally anything that would make you stop and have ambivalent feelings about Tyrion.
1879040	1881040	You may sit, Shafki, let's roll a joke.
1883040	1888040	Instead, Tyrion remains the ultimate centrist, the voice of reason in a crazy world, and
1888040	1892040	at long hellish last, in the end, comes up with the worst idea ever.
1892040	1897040	Who has a better story than Bran the Broken?
1897040	1901040	Yeah, so let's ignore the nonsense of A, this new system of government they've come up with.
1901040	1903040	I'm not sure I get a vote, but I.
1904040	1910040	B, the person on trial nominating the king and everyone being like, yeah, that's a good idea.
1910040	1913040	From now on, rulers will not be born.
1913040	1915040	They will be chosen.
1915040	1918040	On this spot are the lords and ladies of Westeros.
1918040	1923040	This speech is also a thesis of sorts on the nature of narrative.
1923040	1928040	I guess D&D decided that the show needed a thesis and also needed it to be self-congratulatory
1928040	1931040	instead of relevant to the story they wrote.
1931040	1933040	What unites people?
1933040	1934040	Armies?
1934040	1935040	Gold?
1935040	1937040	Flags?
1937040	1939040	Stories?
1939040	1943040	So Tyrion's thesis is about the importance of storytelling and writing and how writers
1943040	1946040	are the most important people alive and please give us an Emmy.
1946040	1952040	I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks about our bloody history.
1952040	1954040	Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with.
1954040	1956040	Me too!
1956040	1958040	Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.
1958040	1962040	So the show ends with what once was its strongest character, not making decisions that make
1962040	1966040	sense but instead being carried along by the inertia of the plot.
1966040	1969040	I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.
1969040	1974040	No revenge quest against Cersei, no quest for power of his own, just the voice of common
1974040	1979040	sense who at some point on the boat ride over adopted a pacifist ideology and a 21st century
1979040	1981040	moral code.
1981040	1985040	So since themes are for 8th grade book reports, his character arc fizzles out in a little
1985040	1990040	puff of whatever, but Tyrion is not the worst done-by descendant of Lan the Clever in terms
1990040	1992040	of his ending.
1996040	1997040	Oh, Jaime.
1997040	2001040	The heel with a heart of gold, the man who sacrificed his honor to save countless innocents
2001040	2006040	from the madness of King Aerys by killing him and forever being saddled with the nickname
2006040	2007040	Kingslayer.
2007040	2011040	You all despise me, Kingslayer.
2012040	2016040	For a principal player, a point of view character, and arguably one of the series' protagonists,
2016040	2021040	you sure didn't have a point in the end.
2021040	2025040	Jaime was instrumental in precipitating the inciting action in the beginning, nearly killed
2025040	2029040	Bran and managed to make his way into most of the major battles in Westeros.
2029040	2033040	But after the beginning, he never really made much of a choice that impacted the story.
2033040	2037040	When you break it down, he mostly spent all of his time going back and forth to Cersei
2037040	2038040	doing her bidding.
2038040	2043040	And by Season 7, with good reason, it seems like he's at long last finally over Cersei.
2043040	2048040	But one key thing that is left out of the show is part of Maggy the Frog's prophecy,
2048040	2053040	that Cersei will be killed by the Valonqar, which means, like, little sibling.
2053040	2056040	Cersei grows up thinking that it's going to be Tyrion, but it is heavily foreshadowed
2056040	2058040	that it's supposed to be Jaime.
2058040	2062040	So I thought maybe this was going to be like a bait and switch, and that's why he was
2062040	2067040	really going back to King's Landing and he was going to kill Cersei, but instead he doesn't
2067040	2071040	even do that much and they both pointlessly get a rocks fall, everyone dies, death.
2071040	2076040	So Jaime ends up being like the Nick Carraway of Game of Thrones, affecting the plot not
2076040	2080040	at all, except for being a prisoner of war slash bargaining chip in the second and third
2080040	2084040	season and just kind of watching stuff go down, not really doing anything.
2084040	2085040	But here's the thing.
2085040	2089040	Jaime not driving any action doesn't need to be a bad thing.
2089040	2092040	Not every character has to have a utilitarian plot purpose.
2092040	2097040	Some characters have internal journeys, as we saw illustrated by Jaime in season three,
2097040	2099040	and that can make for great television.
2099040	2104040	Many have bemoaned a redemption arc ruined, but I actually agree with Nicolai Costa-Waldo's
2104040	2105040	take on Jaime.
2105040	2108040	I never saw him as a guy who needed redemption as such.
2108040	2112040	The whole Kingslayer thing on the surface was about him being dishonorable, so now he
2112040	2116040	needed to redeem himself because he did this horrible thing when, in fact, killing the
2116040	2118040	king was probably his proudest moment.
2118040	2120040	Jaime didn't need a redemption arc, per se.
2120040	2124040	He displayed his bravery and selflessness when he killed the Mad King and was forever
2124040	2125040	dishonored for it.
2125040	2129040	Jaime's story was more about learning to care about people who weren't his immediate
2129040	2132040	family, to grow beyond that Lannister, fuck you, got mine attitude.
2132040	2137040	A lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of a sheep.
2137040	2141040	At some point, Jaime realized that Cersei didn't really love him, but just kind of
2141040	2145040	wanted to possess him, and that she didn't care about the type of person he was.
2145040	2148040	I told you no one walks away from me.
2150040	2152040	Are you going to order him to kill me?
2152040	2156040	If she thought about her brother slaying the Mad King at all, she saw it as a move to protect
2156040	2159040	their family, and not an act to prevent harm to the people of King's Landing.
2159040	2165040	Jaime's arc in Game of Thrones was one of self-discovery, of actualization, not redemption.
2165040	2169040	But there's no motivation behind him abandoning all and returning to Cersei.
2169040	2172040	It's not like he did something selfless and got dishonored again.
2172040	2176040	He did the right thing, showed up at Winterfell, and was more or less accepted, despite his
2176040	2177040	transgressions.
2177040	2180040	Pretty much everyone was on the path for giving him a second shot.
2180040	2181040	Brienne gets it in.
2181040	2185040	Hell, even Bran, the child he pushed out of a window, is like, you know, you had to do
2185040	2186040	you, babe.
2186040	2187040	I gotcha.
2187040	2190040	You won't be able to help us in this fight if I let them murder you first.
2195040	2200040	So all this affirmation happens, and then Jaime just kind of leaves.
2200040	2205040	She's hateful, and so am I.
2205040	2207040	A statement which is not supported by any of his actions.
2207040	2210040	Even pushing Bran out of a window was described as,
2210040	2212040	The things I do for love.
2212040	2215040	And that is why his ending is bogus.
2215040	2219040	Not because he had a redemption arc ruined, but because he kind of forgot about rediscovering
2219040	2223040	himself when there was nothing going on in the story that would actually make him go
2223040	2224040	back on that.
2224040	2226040	Jaime is not hateful.
2226040	2229040	The revelation in season 3 is a testament to how he never was.
2229040	2231040	So what the hell is this?
2231040	2233040	She's hateful.
2235040	2236040	And so am I.
2236040	2241040	And then in the penultimate episode, Jaime gets, well, not the worst line, but his worst
2241040	2242040	line.
2242040	2246040	If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that
2246040	2248040	city, innocent or otherwise.
2248040	2251040	To be honest, I never really cared much for them.
2251040	2253040	Innocent or otherwise.
2253040	2260040	Then why the fuck did you sacrifice everything, your reputation, your honor, your oath, to
2260040	2262040	stab and eat the Burn Man?
2262040	2265040	And I don't want to hear any of the ease and denial crap.
2265040	2266040	This is the end of the show.
2266040	2268040	We ain't got time for that.
2268040	2272040	Jaime's narrative being totally character driven would have been fine if it went anywhere.
2272040	2277040	But like Tyrion, like Jon Snow, Jaime's motivation is driven into fucking nonsense in the service
2277040	2281040	of keeping him sympathetic relative to Dragon Lady bad.
2281040	2284040	We know what kind of a guy Jaime is based on his actions.
2284040	2285040	So for him to say,
2285040	2287040	She's hateful.
2288040	2290040	And so am I.
2290040	2294040	Without even really giving us a why only serves as a cheap twist.
2294040	2297040	It's surprising, but not unexpected, isn't it?
2297040	2300040	After all, he's explaining his motivation with words.
2300040	2304040	And if motivations are explained with words, that means they de facto make sense.
2304040	2309040	Telling the audience the thing makes sense with your dialogue while not supporting the
2309040	2315040	thing with the character's actions is kind of a trend in the last season of Game of Thrones.
2318040	2324040	So Cersei Lannister, one of the greatest villains not just in TV history, but arguably in all
2324040	2326040	of literature.
2326040	2330040	She sure didn't have much to do by the end there, did she?
2330040	2334040	All of Tyrion's stupid mistakes and wildly out of character and unmotivated sudden trust
2334040	2339040	in his evil sister serve the purpose of keeping Cersei in the game.
2339040	2346040	Perhaps you'll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you.
2346040	2351040	Which feels even more insulting given that Cersei, close blowing up the Sept, faces no
2351040	2356040	consequences nor has a secret evil plan beyond staring on a balcony and glowering over my
2356040	2358040	domain with a glass of wine.
2358040	2359040	Which, look, I get it.
2359040	2360040	That's my usual Friday night.
2360040	2365040	But, um, that's pretty much all she does in season 8.
2365040	2368040	You know, besides, you know, the thing with Hot Topic Pirate.
2368040	2371040	You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met.
2373040	2375040	I like that.
2375040	2380040	And then the show makes Cersei sympathetic, but it's like in the most condescending way possible.
2380040	2383040	I want our baby to live.
2383040	2385040	Don't let me die, Jane.
2385040	2387040	Please don't let me die.
2387040	2392040	Cersei is one of the most horrendous characters committed to film.
2392040	2397040	Yet somehow at the end she's just a girl and she's just scared and he's there to comfort her.
2397040	2400040	What?
2405040	2410040	When the plot says so, Cersei's armies instantly crumble and she dies a weirdly sympathetic
2410040	2414040	death in Jaime's arms who is here for some reason in a Rocks Fall, Everyone Dies situation
2414040	2419040	that feels more on par with like a C-tier Disney movie and less in line with someone
2419040	2420040	who once said,
2420040	2422040	Power is power.
2423040	2426040	But more than this, it's important to look at Cersei for who she is presented as a monarch
2426040	2430040	and what the show built her up to be before Daenerys torched King's Landing.
2430040	2436040	Let the monsters kill each other, and while they battle in the north, we take back the
2436040	2437040	lands that belong to us.
2437040	2442040	The big thing here, and I mean big thing as a defining action in Cersei's rule, is her
2442040	2447040	effectively blowing up the in-universe equivalent of the Vatican as a means to wipe out her
2447040	2452040	enemies and flex on how many fucks she gives, which is… zero.
2452040	2456040	And yes, this scene was awesome, and yes, it feels like something someone as reckless
2456040	2460040	and vengeful as Cersei would do when pushed to the utter brink.
2460040	2461040	But.
2461040	2462040	But.
2462040	2467040	Prior to season 4, most of the plot of Game of Thrones is centered around the direct consequences
2467040	2472040	of one guy, Ned Stark, getting his head lopped off in what pretty much everyone who wasn't
2472040	2476040	the child who ordered it, even Cersei, felt was a massive dick move.
2476040	2481040	Meanwhile, post season 6, Cersei not only blew up one of the largest buildings in Westeros
2481040	2485040	and wiped out a decent chunk of the Faith and its leader, but also decimated one of
2485040	2490040	the most powerful, wealthy, and well-liked families in Westeros with a lot of loyal bannermen,
2490040	2494040	and apart from a few stray remarks from other characters,
2494040	2502040	But your sister has done things I wasn't capable of imagining.
2502040	2507040	this major act of mass violence, it just kinda, we just move on.
2507040	2508040	It's, nobody cares.
2508040	2510040	There are no consequences for this.
2510040	2512040	She's crowned, and life goes on.
2512040	2517040	The only person opposing her is Dragon Lady, who would have invaded no matter who was on the throne.
2517040	2519040	So let's break this down.
2519040	2523040	Why in God's name would they set up Cersei finally exacting revenge on the faceless masses
2523040	2528040	that threw literal feces on her during her walk of shame and weeding out religious extremism
2528040	2533040	with impunity, only to conveniently forget the internal logic of much smaller scale political
2533040	2537040	issues like Ned Stark's execution causing massive upheaval?
2537040	2540040	Not to mention, again, wasting someone like Lena Headey's talent.
2540040	2542040	I wanted those elephants.
2542040	2544040	Well, here's why.
2544040	2547040	It's because of how Season 8 ends.
2547040	2554040	This one act necessitates that, yes, Cersei would be considered an unparalleled, top-tier,
2554040	2556040	Megatron-grade tyrant.
2556040	2561040	She couldn't have wiped out all of the Faith Militant, or even most of them,
2561040	2565040	let alone the countless followers of the Seven in Westeros who would feel understandably
2565040	2568040	very pissed and personally attacked by this maneuver.
2568040	2572040	This is also to say nothing of all the people who saw her as 100% illegitimate or believed
2572040	2576040	that her children were inbred bastards, or who would want revenge on her for what she
2576040	2578040	did to House Tyrell.
2578040	2581040	So these dum-dums wrote a juicy situation which in theory could have led to some of
2581040	2586040	the best acting from one of their most talented players, but the problem here is that it would
2586040	2590040	have revealed her as a tyrant, leading to a situation where literally anyone with a
2590040	2595040	claim to the throne would be looked upon by the people of King's Landing as a liberator.
2595040	2599040	Which leads us to the person who, at least as far as everyone knows, has the best claim
2599040	2605040	to the throne, and wouldn't you know it, has already defined herself as a liberator.
2605040	2610040	So if Dragon Lady shows up riding some dragons like, oh hey, hi, I'm here to liberate y'all,
2610040	2615040	I'm the breaker of chains, love me please, it's fair to say that D&D created a situation
2615040	2620040	where, yeah, actually that sounds pretty great for the small folk of King's Landing,
2620040	2625040	and the vast, vast majority of the nobles who already support her, and pretty much everyone
2625040	2629040	who isn't the Iron Bank of Braavos to whom the Lannisters owe a lot of money.
2629040	2633040	You can count on the Iron Bank's support.
2633040	2636040	As soon as the gold arrives.
2638040	2642040	They wrote a situation where there's no way Cersei would be able to maintain power
2642040	2646040	after her move with the Sept without being a complete totalitarian who stomps out dissent
2646040	2648040	before it even manifests.
2648040	2652040	She created a situation where she'd have no choice, and she is the personality to relish
2652040	2653040	that sort of thing.
2653040	2657040	I killed you, High Sparrow, because it felt good.
2657040	2662040	Like, oh god yes, revenge please, I lived for this, and I remember the face of every peasant
2662040	2666040	who flung shit at me, and I will pull each of their fingernails out myself.
2666040	2670040	And on a related note, like, you really expect me to think that, like, Cersei's gonna, like,
2671040	2677040	be upset that Daenerys is murdering the innocents of King's Landing?
2677040	2680040	After what they did to her, she should be like, well, you go, girl.
2680040	2685040	So the only way to deal with the fallout of Cersei's actions while still barreling full
2685040	2690040	steam ahead to this predetermined ending is to ignore them altogether.
2690040	2694040	The show must maintain that the people of King's Landing and, hell, greater Westeros
2694040	2697040	are never affected by their monarch, and that they don't care.
2697040	2701040	That social trends do not apply to the rabble or the common folk, even though that was a
2701040	2704040	huge chunk of the King's Landing plot for seasons five and six.
2704040	2709040	That, yes, the machinations of the powerful do have effect, and that politically savvy
2709040	2712040	nobles like Margaery Tyrell have sound methods.
2712040	2716040	And this development in later seasons, especially with Cersei, kills me because what set Game
2716040	2721040	of Thrones apart for the first few seasons was how it was so conscious of how said intrigues,
2721040	2726040	be they magical or otherwise, have realistic consequences that affect not only the lives
2726040	2729040	of the major characters, but also the culture of the world itself.
2729040	2733040	Like in season seven during the loot train attack, Daenerys recklessly burns all that
2733040	2734040	food from the Reach.
2734040	2737040	That surely should have had some consequences, right?
2737040	2741040	Maybe set off a touch of the old starvation?
2741040	2746040	But like the destruction of the Sept, they wrote a situation that should have had consequences,
2746040	2748040	but didn't.
2748040	2752040	So I'm guessing that the existence of Faegon creates a situation where it makes perfect
2752040	2756040	sense not only for the people of Westeros to reject Daenerys, but for her own sense
2756040	2761040	of entitlement to make her descent into power obsession make sense not only based on the
2761040	2765040	situation, but also based on the character that we know.
2765040	2769040	Unfortunately, that is not the situation that these chuckle f***s wrote.
2769040	2771040	So let's deal with Daenerys.
2774040	2778040	Daenerys came to power effectively from nothing, not only because of an important name and
2778040	2781040	some dragons, but because people believed in her.
2781040	2786040	Just once in my life before it's over, I want to know what it's like to serve his pride.
2786040	2788040	You believe in her?
2791040	2792040	With all my heart.
2792040	2798040	A lot of people, problematic writing or no, sacrificed a lot because they believed what
2798040	2799040	she believed.
2799040	2801040	What about those who swore allegiance to you?
2801040	2804040	They'll all come to see you for what you are.
2804040	2806040	I hope I deserve it.
2807040	2809040	You do.
2810040	2814040	And then she went and did some more crimes, and you didn't even see it coming cause she's
2814040	2815040	pretty.
2815040	2817040	Don't you feel stupid?
2817040	2823040	Tyrion, Jorah, Jon Snow, all big dum-dums who fell for her not because she was a charismatic,
2823040	2827040	strong-willed leader who was constantly trying to balance her not inconsiderable power with
2827040	2831040	doing the right thing, but because they wanted to get into them panties.
2831040	2834040	I know you love her.
2834040	2836040	I love her too.
2836040	2839040	Not as successfully as you.
2840040	2846040	If your story is purporting to say something, which I assume this is because Drogon is burning
2846040	2852040	the symbolism, it needs to have a basis of knowledge of what it is saying something about.
2852040	2856040	I want to touch on the nature of power since the show is so centered around it.
2856040	2862040	In the end, the show has fuck all to say about power corrupting, one presumes because the
2862040	2866040	writers did not think too hard about what leads to power corrupting.
2866040	2867040	Here's an anecdote.
2867040	2871040	Back in the late 1930s, a man fresh out of law school was trying his first case when
2871040	2873040	the judge threatened to disbar him.
2873040	2878040	Said the judge, I have serious doubts whether you have the ethical qualifications to practice
2878040	2880040	law.
2880040	2882040	That lawyer's name?
2882040	2884040	Albert Einstein.
2884040	2886040	Just kidding, it was Richard Nixon.
2886040	2888040	And yes, that actually happened.
2888040	2892040	At the time, Nixon admitted to taking questionable actions without his client's authority.
2892040	2897040	Decades later, we would discover that power did not corrupt him, he corrupted power, being
2897040	2900040	president revealed to the outside world who he was all along.
2900040	2904040	I have always tried to do what was best for the nation.
2904040	2910040	Said author Robert Caro, reflecting on Lyndon B. Johnson, power doesn't always corrupt,
2910040	2911040	power always reveals.
2911040	2915040	When you have enough power to do what you always wanted to do, then you see what the
2915040	2917040	guy always wanted to do.
2917040	2920040	Your reign is over.
2920040	2922040	My reign has just begun.
2922040	2926040	And in both the books in the series, we have a pretty good idea of what Daenerys wanted
2926040	2928040	to do, because she did it.
2928040	2929040	Dracarys.
2931040	2933040	People point to speeches like this, which, uh...
2933040	2938040	I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of old Valyria, and I will take what is mine.
2938040	2941040	With fire and blood, I will take it.
2941040	2944040	Big speeches like this didn't match her actions.
2944040	2945040	Daenerys had power.
2945040	2947040	We saw what she did with it.
2947040	2948040	Violence?
2948040	2949040	Sure.
2949040	2950040	En masse against peasants?
2950040	2951040	N-n-no.
2953040	2957040	Daenerys' entire arc deals with the fact that small folks suffer when lords flex military
2957040	2960040	might, and her questioning when violence was worth the cost.
2960040	2964040	The main reason she was doing so badly at the invasion initially was because she was
2964040	2966040	trying to be more humane than Aegon the Conqueror.
2966040	2969040	I am not here to be queen of the ashes.
2970040	2975040	So she understandably is like, well, maybe I should just Aegon the motherfucker.
2975040	2977040	Enough with the clever plans.
2977040	2979040	I have three large dragons.
2979040	2980040	I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.
2980040	2983040	She wasn't just one of the few people with a modicum of power that was concerned with
2983040	2985040	the plights of the lower classes.
2985040	2987040	That was how she defined herself.
2987040	2989040	Breaker of chains, protector of the innocent.
2989040	2993040	I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains.
2993040	2997040	And this is why I think the whole power corrupts thing is bogus where it pertains to Daenerys.
2997040	2998040	She's had power.
2998040	3000040	She's had it for a long time.
3000040	3004040	If power hasn't revealed the real Daenerys by now, when the fuck will it?
3004040	3006040	After she wins her trillionth battle?
3006040	3008040	No, actually.
3008040	3011040	The slaughter of unarmed civilians is not a logical progression.
3011040	3014040	Varys talks about her coin still being in the air, and it's like,
3014040	3020040	They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin, and the world holds its breath.
3020040	3021040	Really, dude?
3021040	3023040	You know what kind of leader she is.
3023040	3025040	She's demonstrated it over and over.
3025040	3028040	And she's been pretty consistent about when she's been punitive,
3028040	3030040	when she's been inhumane to her enemies,
3030040	3032040	and when she's done the right thing.
3032040	3034040	Until this episode.
3034040	3036040	When she reveals that she's actually super Hitler.
3036040	3038040	The Hitler that flies.
3040040	3042040	And then she sees the Red Keep.
3042040	3047040	It's in that moment on the walls of King's Landing when she's looking at that symbol
3047040	3049040	of everything that was taken from her.
3049040	3054040	When she makes the decision to make this personal.
3055040	3056040	What?
3056040	3059040	You said it was because she wanted to rule through fear.
3059040	3061040	I didn't mean fear.
3061040	3062040	You said that.
3062040	3063040	In the text that you wrote.
3063040	3065040	You explaining it makes it worse.
3065040	3067040	Now it's a 30 Rock skit.
3067040	3069040	I'll now take questions.
3069040	3070040	Oh no.
3070040	3071040	My period.
3071040	3073040	Let's nuke England!
3073040	3077040	I think we all knew there was no way Daenerys was going to end up getting what she wanted.
3077040	3080040	The first time I read about Faegon, my visceral reaction was,
3080040	3081040	Oh.
3081040	3082040	Oh no.
3082040	3085040	This is going to make Daenerys do something stupid.
3085040	3088040	Problem is, ain't no Faegon in the show.
3088040	3091040	But with regard to the idea that power doesn't corrupt it reveals,
3091040	3095040	I think you learn what you need to know about the way Daenerys handles power in season one.
3095040	3100040	Khal Drogo is ready to do some pillaging because they need resources to go after that Iron Throne,
3100040	3103040	and Dany is okay with it until she sees the human cost.
3103040	3109040	So she pulls a white savior, saves this woman, and is betrayed by this woman because of course she is.
3109040	3111040	I spoke for you.
3111040	3113040	I saved you.
3113040	3117040	Dany doesn't put two and two together that she is the reason this woman lost everything.
3117040	3123040	So when the woman is insufficiently grateful, she burns her alive and gets three dragons out of it.
3123040	3127040	So that Daenerys turns to darkness because the people of Westeros don't fall over themselves in worship
3127040	3130040	is a perfectly logical progression on paper.
3130040	3134040	Problem is, they put her in a position where logically the people of the North should have been grateful.
3134040	3136040	To the Dragon Queen!
3137040	3140040	The people of King's Landing should have been like,
3140040	3143040	hell yes, thank God, literally anyone but Cersei.
3143040	3146040	But then they keep explaining it like it makes sense what happened.
3146040	3151040	But before she breaks, she's sad that the people of the North prefer Jon Snow, a native of the North.
3151040	3155040	And I guess Dany kind of forgot that despite losing the Reach with the Tyrells,
3155040	3159040	she still has the support of the North, the Vale, the Iron Islands, Dorne,
3159040	3162040	and presumably Storm's End now that she's legitimized Gendry.
3162040	3167040	But she decides that she'll never be loved because the people of the North prefer their hometown boy to Dragon Lady.
3167040	3171040	Far more people in Westeros love you than love me.
3171040	3173040	I don't have love here.
3173040	3174040	Sure.
3174040	3177040	What they foreshadowed is Daenerys doing awful things
3177040	3181040	when she thought she had a good reason for doing them.
3181040	3184040	Not, you know, no reason.
3184040	3187040	She was ruthless, sure, and she made some bad decisions,
3187040	3191040	but she never surrounded herself with yes-men, the main hallmark of a corrupt leader,
3191040	3195040	instead seeking out dissent from her advisors and actually listening to them,
3195040	3198040	even when they were giving her shit garbage advice.
3198040	3199040	Tyrion.
3199040	3205040	Cersei thinks the army of the dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children.
3205040	3207040	What if we prove her wrong?
3207040	3211040	But defenders of the show insist that Daenerys was meaningfully different as a ruler from anyone else
3211040	3213040	because the framing said so.
3216040	3219040	See? Tyrion, make a sad face.
3219040	3221040	Because suddenly we're concerned with the cost of war,
3221040	3225040	because fire as a battle strategy is immoral now.
3225040	3226040	I guess.
3226040	3228040	Five seasons?
3228040	3231040	How much of this show has happened while I was, like, putting it off
3231040	3233040	because I meant to read the books?
3233040	3234040	Should I read the books?
3234040	3237040	Leave a comment in the description of Lindsay's video.
3242040	3244040	No, Daenerys wasn't always compassionate,
3244040	3247040	but she made rational decisions, negative or positive.
3247040	3251040	You can't have this sort of medieval wartime code that the characters all live by,
3251040	3255040	and then in the last three episodes have everyone suddenly concerned with the cost of war,
3255040	3258040	especially when there is apparently no material cost,
3258040	3261040	no mass starvation, no uprisings, nothing.
3261040	3266040	Why is Tyrion, who blew up an entire fleet with horrible magic fire,
3266040	3270040	all of a sudden like, but your grace, what about the Geneva Conventions?
3270040	3273040	Now we're treating what Daenerys does in this scene as somehow morally worse
3273040	3278040	than Jon Snow's mass execution, which included a child in season six,
3278040	3283040	or what Ned Stark did to a scared teenager who was running from ice zombies in season one.
3283040	3287040	So that's all noble then, but in season seven it's foreshadowing some war crimes, I guess,
3287040	3290040	because she used a dragon and not a giant f***ing sword.
3290040	3292040	None of these people wanting to betray her,
3292040	3297040	except arguably Sansa, the Separatist, who is a Separatist for some f***ing reason.
3297040	3299040	What about the North?
3300040	3302040	It's just one of those-
3302040	3307040	is rooted in any motivation that is based on what has materially changed during seasons seven and eight,
3307040	3312040	only hunches that just kind of appeared one day because the plot needed it to.
3312040	3314040	But here's the thing that was never foreshadowed.
3314040	3317040	Dany being irrational, Dany denying reality.
3317040	3323040	If someone said, here is why, never once did she go, no, that is very clearly X.
3323040	3325040	You buried the lead too deeply.
3325040	3327040	This was just not the character you wrote.
3327040	3330040	In the end, it's not just cynical, it's meaningless.
3330040	3333040	It's one big reason why the ending left people feeling so hollow.
3333040	3337040	It doesn't say anything about the nature of power and the descent into corruption and cruelty,
3337040	3340040	just that some people's genes are a time bomb.
3340040	3345040	Daenerys doesn't have a character progression that ends with her tragic descent into authoritarianism.
3345040	3349040	Her Targaryen genes were dormant for a while, but wouldn't you know, them bells.
3349040	3355040	That red keep just triggered those genes and suddenly out of nowhere Daenerys is denying reality.
3355040	3361040	And then she sees the red keep when she makes the decision to make this personal.
3361040	3366040	And I've seen countless reinterpretations of this episode where people try to make it make sense,
3366040	3371040	to make her rampage a little more in character and justified and motivated.
3371040	3374040	D&D might be hacks, but they aren't stupid.
3374040	3380040	They could have easily made her rampage make sense in any dozens of ways, but that was not the point.
3380040	3384040	The point was to make her as monstrous as possible.
3384040	3390040	For one reason only, Tyrion and Jon Snow have to remain sympathetic.
3390040	3393040	Daenerys' murder has to be seen as totally morally justified.
3393040	3397040	Even though having a victim of physical and sexual abuse rise to great power,
3397040	3403040	only to be lured into a false sense of security and murdered by the man she loves in a moment of physical intimacy,
3403040	3411040	she goes on a nonsense rampage so then she can then soap opera die at the hands of a sympathetic hero by way of the worst of tropes.
3411040	3413040	Save me.
3413040	3415040	I love you.
3415040	3419040	You've gone, Dark Phoenix. You've become too powerful.
3419040	3423040	It's so sad what I have to do to the woman I love, but it has to be done.
3425040	3427040	I love you.
3427040	3431040	It's for your own good, don't you see? I had to do it.
3431040	3435040	Look what you made me do, Daenerys. I had to do it.
3435040	3437040	Look what you made me do.
3437040	3440040	Her actions have to be indescribably monstrous
3440040	3445040	because the narrative has to justify the violence Tyrion and Jon Snow do to her body
3445040	3448040	while keeping these characters sympathetic to the audience.
3448040	3450040	And that's all there is to it.
3450040	3454040	Much attention has been paid to the bad writing in the Emmy-nominated final episode,
3454040	3458040	but to me, this is the ultimate summation of what failed about the ending,
3458040	3461040	arguably the most insulting line in television history.
3461040	3467040	Everywhere she goes, evil men die, and we cheer her for it.
3467040	3469040	They're doing, like, a thing, see?
3469040	3472040	Oh, you liked Daenerys. You supported her.
3472040	3474040	When you should have seen it coming.
3474040	3477040	She's showing all the hallmarks of a fascist,
3477040	3481040	like a red-and-black color scheme and Nazi clothes.
3481040	3483040	That's what fascism is, right?
3483040	3486040	When she murdered the slavers of Astapor,
3486040	3488040	sure no one but the slavers complained.
3488040	3490040	After all, they were evil men.
3490040	3493040	When she crucified hundreds of Myrnae's nobles,
3493040	3496040	who could argue they were evil men?
3496040	3499040	The Dothraki calls she burned alive.
3499040	3502040	They would have done worse to her.
3502040	3508040	Everywhere she goes, evil men die, and we cheer her for it.
3508040	3512040	So D&D are invoking Niemöller's first-they-came poem
3512040	3514040	to equate Daenerys killing slavers and rapists
3514040	3517040	to Nazis persecuting socialists and Jews.
3517040	3520040	And you, the audience, were cheering her on,
3520040	3523040	you enablers, you lovers of blood sport.
3523040	3525040	Tyrion, and by extension the audience,
3525040	3527040	supported Daenerys' slip into fascism
3527040	3529040	because we agreed with her politics,
3529040	3531040	even if the means were kind of iffy.
3531040	3533040	She othered the bad guy, and we cheered her on
3533040	3535040	because we agreed the bad guy was bad.
3535040	3537040	But then she turned her ire on innocents,
3537040	3539040	so really the audience needs to confront
3539040	3541040	what authoritarian they support.
3543040	3546040	Now here's why that's fucking stupid.
3546040	3548040	As we see in First They Came, yes,
3548040	3551040	fascists create an enemy and use it as a rallying point.
3551040	3554040	The OG Nazis started with socialists and communists
3554040	3556040	and worked their way out from there.
3556040	3558040	And the German people were okay with it because,
3558040	3560040	hey, ends justify the means,
3560040	3562040	and hey, maybe the socialists and the communists
3562040	3564040	and the Jews and the gays and the disabled people
3564040	3566040	are actually the problem.
3566040	3568040	And then they turn around and act all surprised
3568040	3570040	when that ends in genocide some ten years later.
3570040	3574040	But Daenerys isn't scapegoating just anyone as the enemy.
3574040	3576040	How many slaves are there in Yunkai?
3576040	3580040	200,000, if not more.
3580040	3584040	Then we have 200,000 reasons to take the city.
3584040	3586040	The other she uses to justify her authoritarianism
3586040	3588040	isn't a political party or dissidents
3588040	3590040	or an ethnic group.
3590040	3592040	It's the institution of slavery itself.
3592040	3594040	So in the end, her tragic authoritarianism
3594040	3596040	is rooted in the fact that
3596040	3598040	she wants to end all forms of slavery
3598040	3600040	too much.
3600040	3606040	It's not easy to see something that's never been before.
3606040	3608040	She wants to break too many chains.
3608040	3612040	The ultimate, what if woke but too much.
3612040	3614040	When she crucified hundreds of Merenese nobles,
3614040	3618040	who could argue they were evil men?
3618040	3620040	First she came for the slavers,
3620040	3624040	and I did not speak out because I was not a slaver.
3624040	3626040	Then she came for the slave masters
3626040	3628040	that crucified a bunch of slave children,
3628040	3630040	and I did not speak out.
3630040	3632040	Then she killed a bunch of fucking innocent women and children,
3632040	3634040	so really I'm the idiot, I guess.
3634040	3636040	1-2 progression, should have seen that coming.
3636040	3638040	It really makes you think.
3638040	3640040	We live in a society.
3640040	3644040	Everywhere she goes, evil men die,
3644040	3646040	and we cheer her for it.
3646040	3648040	Like, hey assholes,
3648040	3650040	first they came as a poem about gentile complacency
3650040	3652040	during the fucking holocaust.
3652040	3654040	You can't make an argument about Daenerys' methods
3654040	3656040	being cruel or unusual when she's more or less
3656040	3658040	been on the level with every other
3658040	3660040	marginally decent leader in this universe.
3660040	3662040	Sansa feeds her enemy to his own dogs.
3662040	3664040	Jon hangs all of the insurrectionists,
3664040	3666040	including a child, heads on spikes.
3666040	3668040	Wow, it's a thing in this universe.
3668040	3672040	Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.
3672040	3674040	Arya murdering an entire house
3674040	3676040	and then baking them into pies
3676040	3678040	and then feeding them to their father, but
3678040	3680040	They weren't easy to carve.
3680040	3682040	Execution by dragon is a bridge too far.
3682040	3684040	It's effectively calling the audience hypocrites
3684040	3686040	when you hold your own damn characters
3686040	3688040	to a weird double standard.
3688040	3690040	Daenerys, who spent more or less the entire series
3690040	3692040	having discussions on her political aims
3692040	3694040	versus the ethics of her means,
3694040	3696040	is the one we really need to look into our hearts
3696040	3698040	and be like, wow.
3698040	3700040	I guess her reacting coldly
3700040	3702040	when her abusive brother does something stupid
3702040	3704040	she knows will get him killed was a warning sign.
3704040	3706040	Even when you look back to season one
3706040	3708040	when Khal Drogo gives the golden crown to Viserys
3708040	3710040	and her reaction on watching her brother's head
3710040	3712040	melted off, there is something kind of
3712040	3714040	chilling about the way that Dany has responded
3714040	3716040	to the death of her enemies.
3716040	3718040	Wow. We live in a society.
3718040	3720040	It really makes you think.
3720040	3722040	But if we're following the worst-case scenario
3722040	3724040	of fascism that ends in genocide,
3724040	3726040	then the worst-case scenario for Daenerys
3726040	3728040	is what happens in season four.
3728040	3730040	The indiscriminate crucifixion of her enemies,
3730040	3732040	the wise masters of Meereen,
3732040	3734040	some of whom were complicit in crucifying slave children,
3734040	3736040	some of whom were not.
3736040	3738040	Genocide against the randos of King's Landing
3738040	3740040	for absolutely no reason
3740040	3742040	doesn't follow any meaningful progression
3742040	3744040	of fascism or authoritarianism.
3744040	3746040	So, Tyrion, it really makes you think
3746040	3748040	in the audience
3748040	3750040	because they considered her enemies acceptable targets
3750040	3752040	only to be shocked when she slaughters innocents
3752040	3754040	isn't just insulting,
3754040	3756040	it's meaningless.
3756040	3758040	If you read the script for the final episode,
3758040	3760040	The Iron Throne,
3760040	3762040	which leaked when Emmy voting started,
3762040	3764040	the moment where Tyrion throws down
3764040	3766040	his Hand of the Queen pin
3766040	3768040	is paired with the script direction
3768040	3770040	this is liberation, he doesn't believe
3770040	3772040	in liberation theology.
3772040	3774040	Which is so
3774040	3776040	revealing with regard to
3776040	3778040	the point that these guys were going for.
3778040	3780040	Why did people
3780040	3782040	follow Daenerys? Was it just because
3782040	3784040	she was powerful?
3784040	3786040	Or because they wanted it in her panties?
3786040	3788040	Or was it because they agreed with her politics?
3788040	3790040	Everywhere she goes,
3790040	3792040	evil men die
3792040	3794040	and we cheer
3794040	3796040	her for it.
3796040	3798040	Tyrion, yes.
3798040	3800040	You cheered her on, not just because she had dragons,
3800040	3802040	but because you agreed with her politics.
3802040	3804040	Raping and pillaging
3804040	3806040	bad. Unjust hierarchy
3806040	3808040	bad. Slavery bad.
3808040	3810040	And she grows more powerful
3810040	3812040	and more sure that she is good
3812040	3814040	and right.
3814040	3816040	The argument Tyrion is making is that
3816040	3818040	if someone has the power, with enough
3818040	3820040	encouragement and enough self-reassurance,
3820040	3822040	and if they believe in their cause enough,
3822040	3824040	this sort of thing is inevitable,
3824040	3826040	isn't it? The righteousness of
3826040	3828040	your beliefs don't really matter.
3828040	3830040	What matters is the strength of those beliefs.
3830040	3832040	And that's what's dangerous.
3832040	3834040	And that's what you have to watch out for.
3834040	3836040	And that is why good king Bran is
3836040	3838040	good. That is why the best ruler is someone
3838040	3840040	who doesn't really want it. Bran has
3840040	3842040	no politics. Bran believes in nothing.
3842040	3844040	Impartiality and emotionlessness
3844040	3846040	are the qualities of a fine leader
3846040	3848040	because Dragon Lady believed in herself
3848040	3850040	and building a better world too much.
3850040	3852040	And women are just too emotional to lead,
3852040	3854040	which is why the only good woman leader
3854040	3856040	is the one who's been sapped of her humanity.
3856040	3858040	Believing in a righteous cause
3858040	3860040	turns dangerous if you believe in it too
3860040	3862040	hard. And really,
3862040	3864040	in the year of our lord, 2019,
3864040	3866040	does that add anything
3866040	3868040	of value?
3872040	3874040	See how she leans her cheek upon her hand?
3876040	3878040	Oh, that I were a glove upon
3878040	3880040	that hand that I might touch that cheek.
3880040	3882040	The cultural endurance
3882040	3884040	of any story has much to do with the
3884040	3886040	desire to retell it, despite
3886040	3888040	knowing how it ends.
3888040	3890040	They'll rust
3890040	3892040	and let me die.
3892040	3894040	Breaking Bad is
3894040	3896040	not devalued by knowing the ending.
3896040	3898040	The Sopranos is not devalued by
3898040	3900040	knowing the ending. Romeo and Juliet
3900040	3902040	tells you the ending at the beginning of the
3902040	3904040	play. From forth the fatal
3904040	3906040	loins of these two foes,
3906040	3908040	a pair of star-crossed
3908040	3910040	lovers take their life.
3910040	3912040	Making case not just for
3912040	3914040	this tragedy, but for the endurance of
3914040	3916040	tragic stories in general, Romeo
3916040	3918040	and Juliet, Orpheus and Eurydice,
3918040	3920040	we tell and retell these stories
3920040	3922040	despite knowing how they're going
3922040	3924040	to end. I bring this up
3924040	3926040	because knowing how the show
3926040	3928040	ends, are you going to
3928040	3930040	begin to watch it again? What is
3930040	3932040	the legacy of Game of Thrones going to be?
3932040	3934040	Because there are endings that ruin
3934040	3936040	a story in hindsight. I used
3936040	3938040	to watch and rewatch the earlier seasons
3938040	3940040	of this show, but now, knowing how it ends,
3940040	3942040	knowing what they're building towards,
3942040	3944040	knowing how nihilistic and stupid
3944040	3946040	and mean it ends up being, there's
3946040	3948040	just no enjoyment in the journey
3948040	3950040	anymore. Even in the very
3950040	3952040	long process of making these two
3952040	3954040	episodes, rewatching old
3954040	3956040	Game of Thrones was just an exercise
3956040	3958040	in frustration, because
3958040	3960040	you know now that the build-up
3960040	3962040	that they're going towards has little
3962040	3964040	or no payoff. The enjoyment of
3964040	3966040	experiencing a story should not be ruined
3966040	3968040	by knowing how it ends.
3968040	3970040	I think that after the dust settles and all
3970040	3972040	the hot takes are taken, and I
3972040	3974040	recognize I'm probably at the end of this train,
3974040	3976040	the answer is going to be no.
3976040	3978040	It's not going to be remembered for the
3978040	3980040	journey we all undertook, it's going
3980040	3982040	to be remembered as a
3982040	3984040	thing that was ruined by its ending.
3984040	3986040	One of the greatest examples of that.
3986040	3988040	Maybe ever.
3988040	3990040	Hmm.
3990040	3992040	This is kind of a downer ending.
3992040	3994040	I'll take off the cinnamon totes. Crunch.
3994040	3996040	So there is one thing that I feel
3996040	3998040	has kind of gone under-reported,
3998040	4000040	and that is the nature of the backlash.
4000040	4002040	And I feel like there's kind of a
4002040	4004040	false equivalency comparing it to
4004040	4006040	other backlashes in recent memory like,
4006040	4008040	well, Star Wars.
4008040	4010040	Because in this case, most of the
4010040	4012040	ire kind of remained where it
4012040	4014040	was deserved. And I feel like
4014040	4016040	there's a false equivalency
4016040	4018040	where it remained where it was deserved.
4018040	4020040	In this case, the showrunners
4020040	4022040	who wielded absolute power
4022040	4024040	against the wishes of the author they
4024040	4026040	were adapting, and even the network that was
4026040	4028040	funding them. The nature of the backlash
4028040	4030040	mostly stuck to what was relevant. The writing.
4030040	4032040	The characters. And it didn't
4032040	4034040	spill over into, like, misogyny
4034040	4036040	and toxicity as it usually
4036040	4038040	does. You didn't see any
4038040	4040040	actors being bullied off of social media.
4040040	4042040	But I point this out because the backlash
4042040	4044040	wasn't completely negative.
4044040	4046040	A lot of people who were disappointed with the way
4046040	4048040	the show ended wanted to make it clear
4048040	4050040	that they really did care
4050040	4052040	about the show, and they didn't blame the cast or
4052040	4054040	crew, or especially the actors,
4054040	4056040	who tend to be the people that bear the brunt
4056040	4058040	of backlash. So there was a Reddit user
4058040	4060040	named Ellalaria who decided to
4060040	4062040	start a fundraiser for Amelia
4062040	4064040	Clark's charity. Since earlier this year,
4064040	4066040	Amelia Clark came out about having two brain
4066040	4068040	aneurysms and nearly dying during
4068040	4070040	the earlier seasons of Game of Thrones.
4070040	4072040	And a bunch of Reddit users, most
4072040	4074040	of whom were in the crowd that was
4074040	4076040	really disappointed with the way the show ended,
4076040	4078040	came together and had a big
4078040	4080040	fundraiser for Amelia Clark's
4080040	4082040	charity, Same You. You're raising money
4082040	4084040	for Same You? I can't
4084040	4086040	believe it. I'm so incredibly,
4086040	4088040	like, moved
4088040	4090040	and blown away and grateful
4090040	4092040	and thank you and thank you and thank you.
4092040	4094040	Because through all of this, people like
4094040	4096040	Amelia Clark and Kit Harington
4096040	4098040	have an unbelievable pressure on them
4098040	4100040	for a thing
4100040	4102040	they really can't even control.
4102040	4104040	I think it's pretty obvious
4104040	4106040	that Amelia Clark was not thrilled with the
4106040	4108040	way things ended.
4108040	4110040	Best season ever!
4110040	4112040	So I have a link for the fundraiser
4112040	4114040	in the comments that's still ongoing. And I hope
4114040	4116040	that if we take a lesson from this, it's that
4116040	4118040	if there is negativity
4118040	4120040	and it does become organized
4120040	4122040	in the way that it has,
4122040	4124040	take inspiration from the fact that sometimes
4124040	4126040	that organized
4126040	4128040	anger can be turned to
4128040	4130040	a good thing. Because at the end of the day,
4130040	4132040	you have to love something
4132040	4134040	a lot to be this disappointed.
4136040	4138040	Who let the dogs out?
4138040	4140040	Who let the dogs out?
4140040	4142040	Who let the dogs out?
4142040	4144040	Who? Who? Who? Who?
4144040	4146040	I'm not a knight.
4146040	4148040	Who let the dogs out?
4148040	4150040	You're a talker.
4150040	4152040	This means
4152040	4154040	talkers.
4154040	4156040	Makes me thirsty.
4156040	4158040	Thirsty. Thirsty. Thirsty.
4164040	4166040	Thirsty. Thirsty.
4170040	4172040	You're a talker.
4172040	4174040	You're a talker.
4184040	4186040	Why does there have to be a king on the Iron Throne?
4186040	4188040	Why can't we be an autonomous collective?
4188040	4190040	You're fooling yourself. We're living in a dictatorship.
4190040	4192040	A self-perpetuating autocracy
4192040	4194040	in which the control of the dragons-
4194040	4196040	Oh there you go, bringing dragons into it again.
4196040	4198040	Well that's what it's all about!
4198040	4200040	Why have stories at all? What purpose do they serve?
4200040	4202040	They bring people together, I guess.
4202040	4204040	And Bran's story is
4204040	4206040	better than everyone else's which
4206040	4208040	would make him a good ruler.
4208040	4210040	I'm your king.
4210040	4212040	Well I didn't vote for you.
4212040	4214040	You don't vote for kings?
4214040	4216040	Well I do become king then.
4216040	4218040	And who has a better story
4218040	4220040	than Bran the Broken?
4220040	4222040	That is why I'm your king.
4222040	4224040	Listen, strange dwarves
4224040	4226040	sitting in councils telling good stories
4226040	4228040	is no basis for a system of government.
4228040	4230040	Be quiet!
4230040	4232040	You can't expect to wield supreme executive power
4232040	4234040	just because some rhapsodic dwarf strung a narrative together.
4234040	4236040	Shut up!
4236040	4238040	I mean if I went round saying I was an emperor
4238040	4240040	just because I could recount the entire plot of Anna Karenina
4240040	4242040	they'd put me away.
4242040	4244040	Shut up, will you? Shut up!
4244040	4246040	Now we see the violence inherent in the system.
