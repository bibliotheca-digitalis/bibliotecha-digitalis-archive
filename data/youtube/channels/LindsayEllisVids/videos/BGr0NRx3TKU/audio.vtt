00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Power Broker, Robert Moses, and The Fall of New

00:05.200 --> 00:09.560
York, Robert A. Caro, is widely considered one of the world's foremost experts on the

00:09.560 --> 00:11.400
subject of power.

00:11.400 --> 00:16.960
Caro won the Pulitzer for Nonfiction in 1974 by revealing how New York City urban planner

00:16.960 --> 00:21.680
Robert Moses, despite never having been elected to any public office, was able to slowly and

00:21.680 --> 00:25.920
steadily accrue so much power that not only did he become the greatest shaper of New York

00:25.920 --> 00:31.680
City in the 20th century, he also exerted massive influence on all American cities.

00:31.680 --> 00:36.320
Widely liked and respected in his time, The Power Broker destroyed Moses' reputation,

00:36.320 --> 00:40.880
painting him as a power-hungry totalitarian that destroyed communities.

00:40.880 --> 00:43.280
And he died in disgrace some ten years later.

00:43.280 --> 00:47.160
But according to Caro, it was not his profile of Robert Moses that truly revealed to him

00:47.160 --> 00:52.200
the nature of power, but his acclaimed chronicle of the life of Lyndon B. Johnson, which currently

00:52.200 --> 00:56.120
stands at four volumes and 1.5 million words.

00:56.120 --> 00:57.120
According to Caro,

00:57.120 --> 01:02.720
We're taught Lord Acton's axiom, all power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.

01:02.720 --> 01:06.680
I believed that when I started these books, but I don't believe it's always true anymore.

01:06.680 --> 01:10.680
What I believe is always true about power is that power always reveals.

01:10.680 --> 01:14.480
When you have enough power to do what you always wanted to do, then you see what the

01:14.480 --> 01:16.000
guy always wanted to do.

01:23.200 --> 01:27.560
So, what was the point of all that?

01:27.560 --> 01:32.040
And by all that, of course, I mean the thing we've spent the last eight seasons obsessing

01:32.040 --> 01:38.720
over and are now months late getting to our spicy hot takes.

01:38.720 --> 01:39.720
That's right, bitches.

01:39.720 --> 01:41.680
The Funyuns are back.

01:41.680 --> 01:46.160
And some say that stories don't need to have a point, or weren't intended to have a point.

01:46.160 --> 01:50.960
But I have to assume this one was intended to have a point, since it ended with a dragon

01:50.960 --> 01:54.840
burning the symbolism.

01:54.840 --> 01:58.840
But for such a character-driven show, really, the main issues boil down to that.

01:58.840 --> 02:00.120
The characters.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.560
And we will start with the fact that by the end of the show...

02:02.560 --> 02:09.880
So it seems like D&D outlined a lot of plot points without giving much thought as to how

02:09.880 --> 02:13.120
characters might be motivated to reach those plot points.

02:13.120 --> 02:18.040
So a huge chunk of season 8 is spent on dialogue, rationalizing plot points that don't really

02:18.040 --> 02:19.040
make sense.

02:19.040 --> 02:23.440
There still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day.

02:23.440 --> 02:24.720
She left her no choice.

02:24.720 --> 02:27.360
The moment the gates fell, the battle was over.

02:27.360 --> 02:29.640
She saw her friend beheaded.

02:29.640 --> 02:31.360
She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.320
And she burned down a city for it.

02:33.320 --> 02:36.960
And they kind of know they don't make sense, so they have to spend a lot of time rationalizing

02:36.960 --> 02:37.960
them.

02:37.960 --> 02:42.240
He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories.

02:42.240 --> 02:46.040
In order for the plot to progress as outlined, everyone, especially characters who in earlier

02:46.040 --> 02:50.080
seasons were defined by their cunning and intelligence, decay into total dummy-whummies

02:50.080 --> 02:52.640
by season 8.

02:52.640 --> 02:57.400
This was, you might say, foreshadowed in season 7 by Littlefinger's downfall, which only works

02:57.400 --> 03:03.480
if every character involved in this subplot took a bunch of stupid pills.

03:03.480 --> 03:07.200
Littlefinger doesn't like that Arya's back, so he tries to pit the two sisters against

03:07.200 --> 03:10.960
each other, and it looks like Sansa bought it for some reason, despite knowing what an

03:10.960 --> 03:15.960
untrustworthy asshat he is, but ah, no, switcheroo.

03:15.960 --> 03:21.440
You stand accused of murder, you stand accused of treason.

03:21.440 --> 03:27.840
How do you answer these charges, Lord Baelish?

03:27.840 --> 03:32.920
And lo, everyone, knocked down many an intelligence unit, watches this worthless subplot bleed

03:32.920 --> 03:37.320
out on the floor because the character of Littlefinger is redundant now, and we don't

03:37.320 --> 03:40.480
know what to do with him, so goodbye.

03:40.480 --> 03:46.160
So it takes Arya and Sansa an entire season to realize they're being played over… nothing,

03:46.160 --> 03:47.360
basically.

03:47.360 --> 03:51.360
But here, in season 7, everyone caught a case in the dumb-dumbs, which only worsens in season

03:51.360 --> 03:52.360
8.

03:52.360 --> 03:54.760
While Dany kind of forgot about the Iron Fleet.

03:54.760 --> 03:58.360
And the idea that the sisters were onto Littlefinger, and were just playing along the whole time

03:58.360 --> 04:00.840
is good headcanon in theory, but…

04:00.840 --> 04:04.320
Well, here's a quote from Isaac Hempstead Wright, who plays Bran.

04:04.320 --> 04:08.240
We actually did a scene that clearly got cut, a short scene with Sansa where she knocks

04:08.240 --> 04:11.540
on Bran's door and says, I need your help, or something along those lines.

04:11.540 --> 04:15.280
So basically, as far as I know, the story was that it suddenly occurred to Sansa that

04:15.280 --> 04:19.400
she had a huge CCTV department at her discretion, and it might be a good idea to check with

04:19.400 --> 04:21.640
him first before she guts her own sister.

04:21.640 --> 04:31.240
So she goes to Bran, and Bran tells her everything she needs to know, and she's like, oh shi-

04:31.400 --> 04:34.120
No, Sansa.

04:34.120 --> 04:35.880
You have been done dirty.

04:35.880 --> 04:43.480
I know that after the shitshow that was season 5, some Sansa stans are happy that at least

04:43.480 --> 04:47.480
one of the women got to be in charge without having to be put down like old Yeller, but

04:47.480 --> 04:51.720
if we may for a moment be honest with ourselves, her entire character has been one massive

04:51.720 --> 04:57.000
trainwreck ever since season 5, when Littlefinger's like, hey, marry the son of the guy who murdered

04:57.000 --> 04:59.900
your entire family, and she's like, noooooo.

04:59.900 --> 05:00.900
Okay.

05:00.920 --> 05:05.080
She begins the fast track to rape town, escape, and then season 7 she completes her evolution

05:05.080 --> 05:10.240
into Ladyfinger, stripped of all pathos, because to D&D, female empowerment is shedding your

05:10.240 --> 05:15.640
humanity until you are a stone cold badass, but you know, the kind who only does some

05:15.640 --> 05:18.280
hideously inhumane executions.

05:18.280 --> 05:20.640
Feminism.

05:20.640 --> 05:25.000
To be clear, I am not on the Sansa hate train, I just think they popped a squat over her

05:25.000 --> 05:27.800
character arc just like they did everyone else.

05:27.800 --> 05:31.940
By season 8, everyone's gushing over how smart Sansa is, she's evolved into her

05:31.940 --> 05:36.100
final form, but unlike in earlier seasons, where her intelligence would come out through

05:36.100 --> 05:46.620
these moments of her being more quick thinking than people expected, or by her playing into

05:46.620 --> 06:07.400
her enemies' arrogance, she now gets these cool-girl-badass moments that build not at

06:07.400 --> 06:11.440
all on the lessons she learned in King's Landing, but instead on violence and a need

06:11.440 --> 06:13.120
to humiliate her enemies.

06:13.120 --> 06:16.940
One of Sansa's earlier defining attributes was her compassion, that she cared about people

06:16.940 --> 06:18.880
despite the pain she was put through.

06:18.880 --> 06:22.860
In the books, she never loses that sense of compassion, but gets smarter about figuring

06:22.860 --> 06:26.680
out who is worthy of it, and who is playing her for their own advantage.

06:26.680 --> 06:31.060
Here in the show, that warmth is totally extinguished, Sansa's compassion and appeals to goodness

06:31.060 --> 06:41.740
are framed not as a strength, but as immature weakness that she needs to outgrow.

06:41.740 --> 06:45.980
New Empowerment Sansa doesn't act like someone who would take pity on a drunk knight, risking

06:45.980 --> 06:49.860
Joffrey's wrath, or someone who would have any ounce of empathy for someone like the

06:49.860 --> 06:52.100
Hound like she did in season 2.

06:52.100 --> 06:54.860
Sansa and the Crypts doesn't bother trying to calm the other women and children like

06:54.860 --> 06:58.020
she did during the siege of King's Landing in season 2.

06:58.020 --> 07:06.260
New Empowerment Sansa spends the whole battle trash-talking Daenerys, who, unlike Sansa,

07:06.260 --> 07:12.580
is out there risking her life.

07:12.580 --> 07:19.180
Season 8 keeps telling us what Sansa is, that she's smart, that she's shrewd, but nothing

07:19.180 --> 07:21.220
in her actions support that.

07:21.220 --> 07:25.460
Earlier Sansa would know to keep her mouth shut about someone she was suspicious of.

07:25.460 --> 07:28.980
Meanwhile, New Empowerment Sansa won't shut the fuck up about how much she doesn't like

07:28.980 --> 07:31.660
Daenerys.

07:31.660 --> 07:36.040
During Sansa's entire King's Landing storyline, she keeps herself alive by feigning loyalty

07:36.040 --> 07:44.160
to Joffrey and Cersei.

07:44.160 --> 07:48.480
Even if she did plan on undermining Daenerys, I guess D&D kind of forgot that one of Sansa's

07:48.480 --> 07:54.840
most important lessons is one to feign respect and fidelity.

07:54.840 --> 07:57.720
Sansa's evolution mirrors the Starks as a whole.

07:57.720 --> 08:01.760
The compassion and nobility that define the Starks is one of their biggest assets, but

08:01.760 --> 08:13.840
in the end, they're no better than the fucking Lannisters.

08:13.840 --> 08:17.960
Change their house motto from Winter is Coming to Fuck You Got Mine.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.280
Because that's female empowerment to these showrunners.

08:20.280 --> 08:23.200
I'm glad I got raped, actually, Mr. The Hound.

08:23.200 --> 08:33.520
It made me a cool girl badass.

08:33.520 --> 08:38.400
So Sansa is a northern separatist now for some fucking reason, even though now is not

08:38.400 --> 08:39.400
the time.

08:39.400 --> 08:44.200
Do they remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north?

08:44.200 --> 08:46.260
Yeah, nothing.

08:46.260 --> 08:47.260
Nothing happened.

08:47.260 --> 08:50.420
When Aegon the Conqueror invaded, the north bent the knee immediately and joined the Seven

08:50.420 --> 08:53.020
Kingdoms without a fight, and nobody died.

08:53.020 --> 08:55.240
The countryside was not burninated.

08:55.240 --> 08:58.300
The king at the time was called the King Who Knelt for a reason.

08:58.300 --> 08:59.940
I guess someone kind of forgot.

08:59.940 --> 09:04.140
Do they remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north?

09:04.140 --> 09:05.940
One season earlier.

09:05.940 --> 09:12.220
But I could have sworn I read, the last king in the north was Torrhen Stark, who bent the

09:12.220 --> 09:14.500
knee to my ancestor, Aegon Targaryen.

09:14.500 --> 09:18.260
There are cases to be made for an independent north doing well in the past, but this whole

09:18.260 --> 09:22.740
situation in Winterfell we have written for season 8, it uh, it actually makes a pretty

09:22.740 --> 09:24.660
good case for United Seven Kingdoms.

09:24.660 --> 09:26.660
We needed her army.

09:26.660 --> 09:27.660
Her dragons.

09:27.660 --> 09:29.180
Yep, you sure did.

09:29.180 --> 09:32.600
How are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen?

09:32.600 --> 09:35.860
Good thing we've got the Reach, a part of the Seven Kingdoms, which also happens to

09:35.860 --> 09:37.580
support Daenerys's claim.

09:37.580 --> 09:40.980
And it wasn't even that they had it on lock before Daenerys showed up with all these mouths

09:40.980 --> 09:41.980
to feed.

09:41.980 --> 09:45.660
You're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north

09:45.660 --> 09:47.780
come back to defend Winterfell.

09:47.780 --> 09:51.180
How are we going to feed our own people was a problem at the beginning of the season that

09:51.180 --> 09:53.900
is set up and promptly ignored.

09:53.900 --> 09:55.620
What do dragons eat, anyway?

09:55.620 --> 09:57.660
You know what Sansa, it doesn't matter.

09:57.660 --> 09:59.740
Don't worry your empowered little head about it.

09:59.740 --> 10:03.180
Enjoy those dragons and supplies from other regions, now that it's fucking winter and

10:03.180 --> 10:04.900
you all have a common enemy.

10:04.900 --> 10:07.420
You seem determined to dislike her.

10:07.420 --> 10:10.740
Like they did Daenerys dirty, and we'll get to Daenerys, but what they did to Sansa

10:10.740 --> 10:12.220
is just depressing.

10:12.220 --> 10:16.500
Sansa's only purpose this season is to have an unfounded suspicion of Daenerys, which

10:16.500 --> 10:20.220
only proves to be founded when Daenerys does something completely nonsensical.

10:20.540 --> 10:24.580
Otherwise, Daenerys has essentially given all of her resources to defend Winterfell,

10:24.580 --> 10:27.100
based on the promise of the guy in charge.

10:27.100 --> 10:30.460
And Sansa is still like, hmm, I don't know.

10:30.460 --> 10:32.300
I don't like the cut of her jib.

10:32.300 --> 10:34.260
Why her?

10:34.260 --> 10:38.460
By the end of this stupid dumb battle of Winterfell, Daenerys has proved herself worthy of being

10:38.460 --> 10:41.060
a queen about as well as one can expect in this universe.

10:41.060 --> 10:47.180
She's forging alliances, doing battle, keeping her promises to her followers and to her allies.

10:47.180 --> 10:50.140
So Sansa's stink eye over Daenerys makes no sense.

10:50.140 --> 10:52.820
She never even lived through the Targaryens hurting her family.

10:52.820 --> 10:57.820
The operative word, mad king, burned her grandfather and uncle to death.

10:57.820 --> 11:03.060
But she sure did Cersei, you know, their common enemy whose family wiped her own out.

11:03.060 --> 11:07.580
Sansa's mistrust of Daenerys only makes sense if you're writing from the end forward,

11:07.580 --> 11:12.020
telling us she is smart when her intelligence is really just writer clairvoyance.

11:12.020 --> 11:16.260
Giving Sansa suspicions without giving her any reason to have them, other than the writers

11:16.340 --> 11:19.180
know how the show will end and they want Sansa to look smart.

11:19.180 --> 11:21.300
You're the dragon queen.

11:21.300 --> 11:22.980
It's quite beautiful.

11:22.980 --> 11:25.020
What does that have to do with anything?

11:25.020 --> 11:28.500
Or maybe, I don't know, Sansa is jealous because Daenerys is pretty.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.500
Which surely they would never.

11:30.500 --> 11:33.380
Oh, come on.

11:33.380 --> 11:35.780
Anyway, moving on.

11:35.780 --> 11:46.180
Bronn is a fan favorite, but by season 8, no, by season 5, he has nothing to do and

11:46.180 --> 11:47.580
no reason to be here.

11:47.580 --> 11:49.460
But people like him, so here he is.

11:49.460 --> 11:52.220
It seems like they were planning a different ending for Bronn.

11:52.220 --> 11:55.300
Like one that had some character development?

11:55.300 --> 12:01.060
In season 7, during the loot train attack, Bronn loses his gold in a very symbolic moment.

12:01.060 --> 12:05.620
He then leaves it to risk his life in a big way to save Jaime, with no mercenary reason

12:05.620 --> 12:07.100
for doing so.

12:07.100 --> 12:09.020
Is this a sign of character development?

12:09.020 --> 12:10.500
Is Bronn changing his ways?

12:10.500 --> 12:13.580
It's good to see you again.

12:13.580 --> 12:16.140
Yeah, you too.

12:16.140 --> 12:17.140
Nope.

12:17.140 --> 12:18.460
And guess who gets the worst subplot of all time?

12:18.460 --> 12:19.980
You do, you do.

12:19.980 --> 12:22.300
You boys are a pair of gold-plated cunts.

12:22.300 --> 12:25.420
So Cersei asks Bronn to go murder her brothers, as you do.

12:25.420 --> 12:32.660
What will she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers?

12:32.660 --> 12:36.460
Bronn fast travels to Winterfell and holds them at arrow point and tells them he thinks

12:36.460 --> 12:41.220
their side will win because dragons, so he blackmails Jaime and Tyrion into giving him

12:42.220 --> 12:43.220
Highgarden.

12:43.220 --> 12:44.700
You could be Lord of the Reach.

12:44.700 --> 12:45.700
Highgarden?

12:45.700 --> 12:46.700
Are you mad?

12:46.700 --> 12:47.700
It's better than being dead.

12:47.700 --> 12:51.380
Okay, so for those of you playing the home game, Highgarden is the capital of the Reach,

12:51.380 --> 12:55.740
seat of the now-extinct House Tyrell and the breadbasket of the Seven Kingdoms, and the

12:55.740 --> 12:56.740
most populous.

12:56.740 --> 13:01.220
Yes, there are probably still many Tyrells next in line to claim the Reach, to say nothing

13:01.220 --> 13:05.140
of the other great houses in the Reach with a much better claim to the seat.

13:05.140 --> 13:10.100
But yeah, we're gonna install Ser Noname as Lord of Highgarden because of blackmail

13:10.100 --> 13:12.700
under a queen that was only queen for five minutes.

13:12.700 --> 13:18.180
And yeah, that's going to go over well with all these other lesser houses in the Reach.

13:18.180 --> 13:19.500
Highgarden.

13:19.500 --> 13:23.940
But okay, we do not see Bronn again until the finale, where not only is he now the Master

13:23.940 --> 13:24.940
of Coin.

13:24.940 --> 13:26.500
I've never borrowed money before.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.900
I'm not clear on the rules.

13:28.900 --> 13:32.740
But Tyrion has apparently made good on that whole promise made at gunpoint thing.

13:32.740 --> 13:38.180
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of

13:38.180 --> 13:41.820
Coin.

13:41.820 --> 13:46.140
He should have ridden off into that good night like Dario Naharis, but okay.

13:46.140 --> 13:47.140
Here he is still.

13:47.140 --> 13:48.140
Cool.

13:48.140 --> 13:52.260
And in a season that has turned pretty much all of its characters into stupid dum-dums

13:52.260 --> 13:56.860
who can't read a situation for shit because the plot needs them to be stupid, there's

13:56.860 --> 14:03.700
one character whose tactical nosedive probably hurts the most.

14:04.700 --> 14:12.020
If there's one character who was arguably done dirtier than Daenerys this season, it's

14:12.020 --> 14:13.020
Lord Varys.

14:13.020 --> 14:18.700
If you consider it, the best ruler might be someone who doesn't want to rule.

14:18.700 --> 14:24.060
Varys, the master of whispers, becomes the master of loud, treasonous conversations.

14:24.060 --> 14:30.020
The greater the risk, the greater the reward.

14:30.020 --> 14:31.020
Go on.

14:31.340 --> 14:34.980
Varys is a fan favorite, but the showrunners clearly had no idea what to do with him after

14:34.980 --> 14:39.980
season 4 because his character starts wildly deviating from his path in the books.

14:39.980 --> 14:43.780
You know what it's like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes?

14:43.780 --> 14:44.780
No.

14:44.780 --> 14:52.540
I only know what it's like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.

14:52.540 --> 14:56.820
I guess in his case they'd figured they'd ride around this later, and they did so by

14:56.820 --> 15:00.100
making the smartest guy in the realm a total dum-dum.

15:00.100 --> 15:04.700
Varys in the books wants to instill a guy on the throne who may or may not, and probably

15:04.700 --> 15:11.700
is not, be the lost son of Rhaegar Targaryen, aka Aegon Targaryen, aka the next in line

15:11.700 --> 15:14.740
to the throne if we have a Targaryen restoration.

15:14.740 --> 15:16.540
Fans call him Faegon.

15:16.540 --> 15:21.580
In the show we don't have Faegon, but Varys needs something to do, so at the beginning

15:21.580 --> 15:27.140
of season 5, he and Tyrion cross the narrow sea with the express intent to support Daenerys

15:27.140 --> 15:37.980
Now, even though Varys totally tried to have her assassinated in season 1, apparently she's

15:37.980 --> 15:45.260
willing to move past that.

15:45.260 --> 15:48.940
You know, in a world where executions are routine, this seems like kind of a reasonable

15:48.940 --> 15:49.940
threat.

15:49.940 --> 15:54.940
He has tried to have her assassinated before, and whoop, here we are one season later, again

15:54.940 --> 16:05.220
with the poisoning.

16:05.220 --> 16:10.780
But then, in season 8, he, um, well, she makes a sad face at dinner.

16:10.780 --> 16:22.260
I guess she does ignore his shitty advice, which has consistently been shitty ever since

16:22.260 --> 16:28.140
they got to Westeros, and is in this case, as it turns out, wrong from a tactical perspective.

16:28.140 --> 16:31.060
They do win the battle easily and with minimal casualties.

16:31.060 --> 16:34.620
And no, they didn't actually need to rest, and no, food was never an issue, and resources

16:34.620 --> 16:37.780
were never an issue, so why bother having those conversations?

16:37.780 --> 16:50.540
But then Varys finds out that Jon Snow is the actual Aegon Targaryen.

16:50.540 --> 17:12.660
And you know what, tis the season for some treason.

17:12.660 --> 17:16.660
And the best rationale they can come up with for Varys wanting to support Jon over Daenerys

17:17.660 --> 17:22.100
the philosophy that the best person to rule is the person who specifically doesn't want

17:22.100 --> 17:23.100
to rule.

17:23.100 --> 17:35.940
Well, I mean, I guess Jon keeps failing upwards, so that tracks.

17:35.940 --> 17:39.020
Imagine nominally being for the good of the realm, and then immediately reversing your

17:39.020 --> 17:44.020
stake the moment you see a young guy whose neighborhood townies love him, and be like,

17:44.020 --> 17:50.740
wow, yeah, that's some leadership material right there.

17:50.740 --> 17:51.740
So here's the problem.

17:51.740 --> 17:55.860
This only makes sense if you're the audience, and you've seen Jon Snow's temperament for

17:55.860 --> 17:57.420
the last eight seasons.

17:57.420 --> 17:59.860
Varys, on the other hand, has not.

17:59.860 --> 18:06.140
Varys has no reason to like or trust Jon Snow, other than he liked and trusted Ned, I guess,

18:06.140 --> 18:08.420
who wasn't actually his father anyway.

18:08.420 --> 18:13.500
Varys only just met Jon Snow, and in-universe has no reason to think that he's a better,

18:13.500 --> 18:17.780
more tempered choice than Daenerys, unless he knows what the audience knows.

18:17.780 --> 18:21.780
We, the audience, know about Jon Snow, but from the outside looking in, the narrative

18:21.780 --> 18:23.020
is all over the place.

18:23.020 --> 18:27.140
Jon Snow has only been in charge of the North for, like, a week, and it's kind of been a

18:27.140 --> 18:35.020
shitshow.

18:35.020 --> 18:38.920
For the first three episodes of the season, she's a war hero with dragons that has sacrificed

18:38.920 --> 18:42.140
half her troops and one of those dragons to save humanity.

18:42.140 --> 18:46.780
The only thing she does in episode four that's mildly questionable is be impatient about

18:46.780 --> 18:48.940
wanting to take King's Landing.

18:48.940 --> 18:51.620
Except, she's not wrong about anything.

18:51.620 --> 18:54.620
The men we have left are exhausted.

18:54.620 --> 18:57.620
They'll fight better if they have time to rest and recuperate.

18:57.620 --> 18:59.580
Well, clearly they don't.

18:59.580 --> 19:04.380
I promised you I would look you in the eye and speak directly if I ever thought you were

19:04.380 --> 19:05.740
making a mistake.

19:05.740 --> 19:09.700
Well, maybe your advice shouldn't have been so uniformly bad.

19:09.700 --> 19:13.740
Maybe he was mad that she went against his advice, but that particular advice, again,

19:13.740 --> 19:15.020
ended up being wrong.

19:15.020 --> 19:19.180
King's Landing was stupid easy to take, because battles are easy now, because we need to wrap

19:19.180 --> 19:20.180
this shit up.

19:20.180 --> 19:22.460
I defended this city last time it was attacked.

19:22.460 --> 19:23.820
I know it better than anyone.

19:23.820 --> 19:24.980
It will fall tomorrow.

19:24.980 --> 19:26.500
Based on what?

19:26.500 --> 19:29.180
Those dragons have the fortitude of hummingbirds.

19:29.180 --> 19:32.920
Up until now, it seemed pretty evenly matched, but, you know, whatever.

19:32.920 --> 19:37.340
So Varys, who has sacrificed all to rally a bunch of power to Daenerys, immediately switches

19:37.340 --> 19:41.300
sides the second he discovers that there's a pouty, indecisive male alternative with

19:41.300 --> 19:42.300
great hair.

19:42.300 --> 19:47.140
But Daenerys has at this point done nothing to make Varys logically want to switch sides.

19:47.140 --> 19:51.260
The one time she went against her advisor's advice before this was to save Jon Snow.

19:51.260 --> 19:54.900
You know, that guy that Varys wants to betray Daenerys for.

19:54.900 --> 20:00.400
And so he starts telling fucking everyone who Jon Snow is, and in doing so, makes more

20:00.400 --> 20:05.620
or less the exact same mistake that Ned Stark did in season one, only way stupider.

20:05.620 --> 20:10.180
This is way more reckless and way less motivated than what Ned did in season one.

20:10.180 --> 20:11.620
Jon fucking abdicated.

20:11.620 --> 20:12.900
That is a thing you can do.

20:12.900 --> 20:14.620
I don't want it.

20:14.620 --> 20:16.100
I never have.

20:16.100 --> 20:19.100
Hell, Jon Snow knew a guy who did abdicate.

20:19.100 --> 20:22.100
You are Aemon Targaryen.

20:22.100 --> 20:25.300
I am a master of the Citadel.

20:25.300 --> 20:27.300
Speaking of Jon Snow...

20:27.300 --> 20:34.900
Oh, Jon Snow.

20:35.180 --> 20:39.260
There's a scene in the second episode of Game of Thrones season one in which Jon Snow asks

20:39.260 --> 20:44.180
Ned Stark about his mother, and Ned responds with this restrained, burdened emotion.

20:44.180 --> 20:50.180
The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother.

20:50.180 --> 20:53.180
I promise.

20:53.180 --> 20:57.180
Like this is eventually going to come to something emotionally charged and important.

21:05.180 --> 21:09.180
So where do we even start with this?

21:09.180 --> 21:11.180
My mom is actually from Napa.

21:11.180 --> 21:12.180
I didn't know that.

21:12.180 --> 21:15.180
I never knew my mother.

21:15.180 --> 21:20.180
In many ways, Jon Snow is emblematic of everything wrong with the way this series handled its resolution.

21:20.180 --> 21:22.180
A big, emotional, profound setup.

21:22.180 --> 21:27.180
His name is Aegon Targaryen.

21:27.180 --> 21:30.180
You have to protect him.

21:30.180 --> 21:32.180
Promise me Ned.

21:32.460 --> 21:35.460
It's a flaccid, confusing, and meaningless payoff.

21:35.460 --> 21:39.460
And from a plot perspective, most of the major letdowns from all of the momentous setup are

21:39.460 --> 21:41.460
pretty much tied in with Jon Snow.

21:41.460 --> 21:44.460
The White Walker plot, of which Jon was the key point of view character.

21:44.460 --> 21:49.460
R plus L equals J, aka the mystery of Jon's parentage, which kind of indirectly kicked

21:49.460 --> 21:52.460
off the plot of the whole show.

21:52.460 --> 21:55.460
Jon Snow being brought back from the dead by the Lord of Light.

21:55.740 --> 22:03.740
And of course, Jon's love for Daenerys, culminating with her, um, murder, done in an uncharacteristically

22:03.740 --> 22:05.740
dishonorable way.

22:05.740 --> 22:09.740
After Jon Snow is resurrected, they keep making this big deal about how he must have been

22:09.740 --> 22:11.740
brought back for a reason.

22:11.740 --> 22:13.740
The Lord let you come back for a reason.

22:13.740 --> 22:15.740
He wants you alive.

22:15.740 --> 22:16.740
Why?

22:16.740 --> 22:17.740
I don't know.

22:17.740 --> 22:19.740
What, indeed, was the point?

22:19.740 --> 22:23.740
Well, considering the f*** all you did during the long night, I'm guessing the Lord brought

22:24.020 --> 22:29.020
you back so you could blue ball Daenerys, making her go crazy, and ultimately instill

22:29.020 --> 22:32.020
f***ing Bran the Broken on the throne.

22:32.020 --> 22:35.020
Good job, Lord of Light.

22:35.020 --> 22:39.020
The White Walker plot was this existential threat that had been built up for eight seasons,

22:39.020 --> 22:43.020
predicated on a historical long night that lasted an actual generation and nearly wiped

22:43.020 --> 22:44.020
out humanity.

22:44.020 --> 22:48.020
There came a night that lasted a generation.

22:48.020 --> 22:52.020
Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their hoods.

22:52.300 --> 22:56.300
The Night King was Jon's principal antagonist, and his main motivation for the run of the

22:56.300 --> 22:57.300
show.

22:57.300 --> 23:00.620
But not only was the big boss easily stabbed away by a character who had nothing to do

23:00.620 --> 23:05.020
with the White Walker plot, but the long night was about as long as a viewing of Titanic

23:05.020 --> 23:08.900
with a couple of bathroom breaks thrown in, and instead of nearly wiping out humanity,

23:08.900 --> 23:12.900
it wiped out… about one half of one army?

23:12.900 --> 23:16.300
What they see is just the end of the Dothraki, essentially.

23:16.300 --> 23:17.300
Question mark?

23:17.300 --> 23:20.300
Two episodes later- Wait, Lindsay, did you steal my joke again?

23:22.300 --> 23:27.620
And we learn that after that's done, it doesn't matter that the world of men was

23:27.620 --> 23:32.380
too preoccupied with political squabbles to worry about an endless horde of ice zombies,

23:32.380 --> 23:37.980
because all you needed to end the existential threat is the one special knife of no importance.

23:37.980 --> 23:41.380
This is a recurring problem which ties in with what we were talking about in the last

23:41.380 --> 23:46.500
episode- subverting expectations, despite the fact that it doesn't work for the story.

23:46.500 --> 23:51.140
Arya's training as a faceless man builds not at all to this- it could have been anyone

23:51.260 --> 23:55.220
with a strong ten-yard jump, and yeah, the fact that the Night King focuses his wrath

23:55.220 --> 23:59.500
on Bran and Jon Snow means that Bran and Jon Snow should have been involved here.

23:59.500 --> 24:04.260
Doesn't mean that Jon Snow needed to do the stabbing, but he needed some resolution

24:04.260 --> 24:09.740
other than spending the battle screaming at his new archenemy, Zombie Dragon.

24:09.740 --> 24:16.300
Tangent, I also saw one idea that it should have been Jaime who kills the Night King,

24:16.300 --> 24:20.220
you know, bring that whole Kingslayer thing full circle, that would have been cool and

24:20.220 --> 24:24.300
give Jaime a reason for existing, but you know, that would also have made sense.

24:24.300 --> 24:28.660
Jon's main motivation is farted out of existence without any of his involvement, and after

24:28.660 --> 24:32.700
it's over, the only thing that has materially changed, apart from the bloodletting of a

24:32.700 --> 24:37.540
couple of supporting characters, is that Daenerys finds out about Jon being a Targaryen, which

24:37.540 --> 24:41.420
not only has nothing to do with the White Walkers, or the effect they have in this world,

24:41.420 --> 24:44.580
it probably would have happened eventually anyway.

24:44.580 --> 24:49.740
But with regard to Jon learning the truth about who he is, he never really reacts to it.

24:49.940 --> 24:51.300
You're the true king.

24:52.580 --> 24:56.300
Aegon Targaryen, 6th of his name, protector of the realm, all of him.

24:56.300 --> 25:00.700
A revelation this momentous, especially to someone like Jon Snow, whose entire identity

25:00.700 --> 25:03.660
was wrapped around his bastardness,

25:03.660 --> 25:04.860
You're Ned Stark's bastard.

25:04.860 --> 25:06.380
Ned Stark's bastard.

25:06.380 --> 25:08.140
Ned Stark's bastard.

25:08.140 --> 25:09.580
I'm a bastard.

25:09.580 --> 25:12.060
Okay, but you don't have to call yourself that though.

25:12.060 --> 25:16.380
should merit more of a reaction than frowns.

25:16.540 --> 25:20.380
There's no moment where he sits down and really parses this, discusses it with anyone.

25:20.380 --> 25:24.140
Sansa and Arya in particular don't seem to care about the implication this has for their

25:24.140 --> 25:28.700
family history, that the stories they heard about their aunt their whole life were a lie,

25:28.700 --> 25:31.860
that their father lied to them, that the rift in their parents' marriage was based on

25:31.860 --> 25:37.580
a falsehood, that Ned had remained faithful to Cat, but sacrificed his honor and basically

25:37.580 --> 25:39.420
his marriage to protect Jon.

25:39.420 --> 25:44.380
No, in the end, Jon reacts to this news like he's just been served jury duty, learning

25:44.380 --> 25:48.460
that he was not only legitimate, but was loved and wanted from the moment of his birth,

25:48.460 --> 25:53.420
has no effect on his identity or sense of self-worth, and is only addressed in the utilitarian

25:53.420 --> 25:57.580
question of birthright and primogeniture, to which he immediately hops to

25:57.580 --> 25:59.500
You are my queen.

25:59.500 --> 26:04.260
and not wanting it is his sole motivation for the rest of the show.

26:04.260 --> 26:08.380
They keep trying to force this ending to make sense vis-a-vis Jon's motivation.

26:08.380 --> 26:10.380
Love is the death of duty.

26:10.380 --> 26:14.700
Because if we had to have this ending, Tyrion is the one who feels responsible for the war

26:14.700 --> 26:15.860
crimes here.

26:15.860 --> 26:20.420
If we must put the bitch down like old Yeller, it should have been Tyrion that did it, not

26:20.420 --> 26:21.780
Jon Snow.

26:21.780 --> 26:26.780
Instead of Tyrion being the little finger to Jon Snow's Lysa Arryn.

26:26.780 --> 26:28.180
I love her too.

26:28.180 --> 26:29.180
Yuck.

26:29.180 --> 26:33.460
By the end, Jon Snow's character has been reduced to a gelatinous mess because he doesn't

26:33.460 --> 26:34.460
want anything.

26:34.460 --> 26:37.500
He has no motivation after the Night King is gone.

26:37.500 --> 26:44.980
This is a problem he has in common with Tyrion's path from the book diverges around the beginning

26:44.980 --> 26:46.140
of season 5.

26:46.140 --> 26:49.580
In the books, Tyrion's departure from Westeros makes it pretty obvious he's on the path

26:49.580 --> 26:52.620
to vengeance and drinking himself into an early grave.

26:52.620 --> 26:56.180
But around this point in the series, the showrunners decided that it's more important for Tyrion

26:56.180 --> 27:01.100
to be an audience avatar, the voice of reason, a nice guy, and here he shall remain until

27:01.100 --> 27:03.420
the last agonizing moments of the series.

27:03.420 --> 27:06.600
There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story.

27:06.600 --> 27:10.320
And characters being wrong in a story is not bad.

27:10.320 --> 27:13.840
Character flaws are a good thing, but Tyrion over the course of these three seasons is

27:13.840 --> 27:19.040
so consistently terrible at his job that he should have been, at minimum, fired a while

27:19.040 --> 27:20.040
ago.

27:20.040 --> 27:23.360
Instead, Tyrion just hatches one bad plan after another.

27:23.360 --> 27:25.560
And Daenerys keeps him on for some reason.

27:25.560 --> 27:29.180
Let's go invade Casterly Rock, a place with no tactical advantage.

27:29.180 --> 27:33.040
Let's not attack King's Landing now, before they can bolster their armies.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.040
You're too valuable.

27:34.040 --> 27:35.040
It's too great a risk.

27:35.040 --> 27:36.040
You're too important.

27:36.040 --> 27:37.040
Let's trust Cersei.

27:37.040 --> 27:41.040
She's pregnant, which means she's good and trustworthy now.

27:41.040 --> 27:43.040
Let's not go rescue Jon Snow.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.040
He's not worth it.

27:44.040 --> 27:49.040
Let's go hide in the fucking crypts while an army with the power to raise the dead is

27:49.040 --> 27:50.040
attacking us.

27:50.040 --> 27:55.040
He's bringing all the dead people back to life, and they put women and children in a

27:55.040 --> 27:58.040
crypt with all the dead people.

27:58.040 --> 28:00.040
So, brah.

28:00.040 --> 28:03.040
Tyrion is smart, but I guess not that smart.

28:03.040 --> 28:08.040
If you rewatch season 7, it seems like they're setting up a Tyrion-betrays-Daenerys twist.

28:08.040 --> 28:11.040
Like, actually betrays her, not this piddling squirt of nothing.

28:11.040 --> 28:15.040
A betrayal twist would have at least explained why his powers of deduction got pushed out

28:15.040 --> 28:16.040
of a window.

28:17.040 --> 28:19.040
You're not a monster.

28:19.040 --> 28:22.040
Two seasons earlier?

28:22.040 --> 28:25.040
My expectations have been subverted.

28:26.040 --> 28:27.040
Kill me.

28:34.040 --> 28:41.040
I kept waiting for anything Tyrion did this season to make sense, especially with regard

28:41.040 --> 28:42.040
to Cersei.

28:42.040 --> 28:46.040
You crossed the narrow sea with the intent of dethroning your sister.

28:46.040 --> 28:49.040
How else did you see this ending?

28:49.040 --> 28:53.040
I watched the people of King's Landing rebel against their king when they were hungry,

28:53.040 --> 28:55.040
and that was before winter began.

28:55.040 --> 28:59.040
Give them the opportunity, and they will cast Cersei aside.

28:59.040 --> 29:02.040
Yes, a short but violent siege is bad.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.040
Mass starvation is much better.

29:04.040 --> 29:09.040
And Tyrion, why are you so horrified with the prospect of killing innocent or honorable

29:09.040 --> 29:10.040
people all of a sudden?

29:11.040 --> 29:13.040
Those are brave men knocking at our door.

29:15.040 --> 29:16.040
Let's go kill them!

29:16.040 --> 29:21.040
It's only because Dragon Lady bad that Tyrion has a completely out-of-character concern

29:21.040 --> 29:24.040
for the innocence of King's Landing.

29:24.040 --> 29:29.040
I saved this city and all your worthless lives.

29:29.040 --> 29:33.040
And the opposing side, and this pity party for Cersei where he keeps trying to save her

29:33.040 --> 29:38.040
life, even though it makes no sense for Tyrion to want to see his sister anything but dead.

29:38.040 --> 29:43.040
The reign is over, but that doesn't mean your life has to end.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.040
Why?

29:44.040 --> 29:46.040
Why, why, why, why, why?

29:46.040 --> 29:47.040
Why do you care?

29:47.040 --> 29:50.040
Tyrion, you've given her like 200 chances to surrender.

29:50.040 --> 29:54.040
Who cares that she's pregnant, which she has been for approximately two years and has

29:54.040 --> 29:56.040
not yet started to show.

29:56.040 --> 29:57.040
Weird that.

29:57.040 --> 30:01.040
Tyrion was likely originally intended to be a corrupting influence on Daenerys and or

30:01.040 --> 30:07.040
play up both his and her vindictive tendencies, especially after coming off his wildly successful

30:07.040 --> 30:10.040
kill everyone in King's Landing speech.

30:10.040 --> 30:14.040
I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you.

30:14.040 --> 30:18.040
I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.

30:18.040 --> 30:23.040
Hence this red priestess stink eye here, foreshadowing that ultimately goes nowhere.

30:23.040 --> 30:26.040
And I suppose this could have played nicely into the theme of vengeance as a self-destructive

30:26.040 --> 30:32.040
force, but dang you Peter Dinklage, you're just so ding dong dang likable.

30:32.040 --> 30:37.040
Sacrificing any gray area or moral ambivalence turns Tyrion into the worst thing he can be.

30:37.040 --> 30:38.040
Boring.

30:43.040 --> 30:47.040
And it begs the question, what does Tyrion even want?

30:47.040 --> 30:49.040
Why do you want Cersei deposed?

30:49.040 --> 30:52.040
Because it kind of seems like maybe you don't.

30:52.040 --> 30:54.040
I don't want to destroy our family.

30:54.040 --> 30:55.040
I never have.

30:56.040 --> 30:58.040
Five seasons earlier?

30:58.040 --> 31:00.040
How much of this show has there been?

31:00.040 --> 31:02.040
I will hurt you for this.

31:02.040 --> 31:09.040
The day will come when you think you're safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth.

31:09.040 --> 31:14.040
Never mind the show dropping the Tysha subplot after season one or TV Shea getting murdered

31:14.040 --> 31:18.040
or literally anything that would make you stop and have ambivalent feelings about Tyrion.

31:19.040 --> 31:21.040
You may sit, Shafki, let's roll a joke.

31:23.040 --> 31:28.040
Instead, Tyrion remains the ultimate centrist, the voice of reason in a crazy world, and

31:28.040 --> 31:32.040
at long hellish last, in the end, comes up with the worst idea ever.

31:32.040 --> 31:37.040
Who has a better story than Bran the Broken?

31:37.040 --> 31:41.040
Yeah, so let's ignore the nonsense of A, this new system of government they've come up with.

31:41.040 --> 31:43.040
I'm not sure I get a vote, but I.

31:44.040 --> 31:50.040
B, the person on trial nominating the king and everyone being like, yeah, that's a good idea.

31:50.040 --> 31:53.040
From now on, rulers will not be born.

31:53.040 --> 31:55.040
They will be chosen.

31:55.040 --> 31:58.040
On this spot are the lords and ladies of Westeros.

31:58.040 --> 32:03.040
This speech is also a thesis of sorts on the nature of narrative.

32:03.040 --> 32:08.040
I guess D&D decided that the show needed a thesis and also needed it to be self-congratulatory

32:08.040 --> 32:11.040
instead of relevant to the story they wrote.

32:11.040 --> 32:13.040
What unites people?

32:13.040 --> 32:14.040
Armies?

32:14.040 --> 32:15.040
Gold?

32:15.040 --> 32:17.040
Flags?

32:17.040 --> 32:19.040
Stories?

32:19.040 --> 32:23.040
So Tyrion's thesis is about the importance of storytelling and writing and how writers

32:23.040 --> 32:26.040
are the most important people alive and please give us an Emmy.

32:26.040 --> 32:32.040
I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks about our bloody history.

32:32.040 --> 32:34.040
Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with.

32:34.040 --> 32:36.040
Me too!

32:36.040 --> 32:38.040
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.

32:38.040 --> 32:42.040
So the show ends with what once was its strongest character, not making decisions that make

32:42.040 --> 32:46.040
sense but instead being carried along by the inertia of the plot.

32:46.040 --> 32:49.040
I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.

32:49.040 --> 32:54.040
No revenge quest against Cersei, no quest for power of his own, just the voice of common

32:54.040 --> 32:59.040
sense who at some point on the boat ride over adopted a pacifist ideology and a 21st century

32:59.040 --> 33:01.040
moral code.

33:01.040 --> 33:05.040
So since themes are for 8th grade book reports, his character arc fizzles out in a little

33:05.040 --> 33:10.040
puff of whatever, but Tyrion is not the worst done-by descendant of Lan the Clever in terms

33:10.040 --> 33:12.040
of his ending.

33:16.040 --> 33:17.040
Oh, Jaime.

33:17.040 --> 33:21.040
The heel with a heart of gold, the man who sacrificed his honor to save countless innocents

33:21.040 --> 33:26.040
from the madness of King Aerys by killing him and forever being saddled with the nickname

33:26.040 --> 33:27.040
Kingslayer.

33:27.040 --> 33:31.040
You all despise me, Kingslayer.

33:32.040 --> 33:36.040
For a principal player, a point of view character, and arguably one of the series' protagonists,

33:36.040 --> 33:41.040
you sure didn't have a point in the end.

33:41.040 --> 33:45.040
Jaime was instrumental in precipitating the inciting action in the beginning, nearly killed

33:45.040 --> 33:49.040
Bran and managed to make his way into most of the major battles in Westeros.

33:49.040 --> 33:53.040
But after the beginning, he never really made much of a choice that impacted the story.

33:53.040 --> 33:57.040
When you break it down, he mostly spent all of his time going back and forth to Cersei

33:57.040 --> 33:58.040
doing her bidding.

33:58.040 --> 34:03.040
And by Season 7, with good reason, it seems like he's at long last finally over Cersei.

34:03.040 --> 34:08.040
But one key thing that is left out of the show is part of Maggy the Frog's prophecy,

34:08.040 --> 34:13.040
that Cersei will be killed by the Valonqar, which means, like, little sibling.

34:13.040 --> 34:16.040
Cersei grows up thinking that it's going to be Tyrion, but it is heavily foreshadowed

34:16.040 --> 34:18.040
that it's supposed to be Jaime.

34:18.040 --> 34:22.040
So I thought maybe this was going to be like a bait and switch, and that's why he was

34:22.040 --> 34:27.040
really going back to King's Landing and he was going to kill Cersei, but instead he doesn't

34:27.040 --> 34:31.040
even do that much and they both pointlessly get a rocks fall, everyone dies, death.

34:31.040 --> 34:36.040
So Jaime ends up being like the Nick Carraway of Game of Thrones, affecting the plot not

34:36.040 --> 34:40.040
at all, except for being a prisoner of war slash bargaining chip in the second and third

34:40.040 --> 34:44.040
season and just kind of watching stuff go down, not really doing anything.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.040
But here's the thing.

34:45.040 --> 34:49.040
Jaime not driving any action doesn't need to be a bad thing.

34:49.040 --> 34:52.040
Not every character has to have a utilitarian plot purpose.

34:52.040 --> 34:57.040
Some characters have internal journeys, as we saw illustrated by Jaime in season three,

34:57.040 --> 34:59.040
and that can make for great television.

34:59.040 --> 35:04.040
Many have bemoaned a redemption arc ruined, but I actually agree with Nicolai Costa-Waldo's

35:04.040 --> 35:05.040
take on Jaime.

35:05.040 --> 35:08.040
I never saw him as a guy who needed redemption as such.

35:08.040 --> 35:12.040
The whole Kingslayer thing on the surface was about him being dishonorable, so now he

35:12.040 --> 35:16.040
needed to redeem himself because he did this horrible thing when, in fact, killing the

35:16.040 --> 35:18.040
king was probably his proudest moment.

35:18.040 --> 35:20.040
Jaime didn't need a redemption arc, per se.

35:20.040 --> 35:24.040
He displayed his bravery and selflessness when he killed the Mad King and was forever

35:24.040 --> 35:25.040
dishonored for it.

35:25.040 --> 35:29.040
Jaime's story was more about learning to care about people who weren't his immediate

35:29.040 --> 35:32.040
family, to grow beyond that Lannister, fuck you, got mine attitude.

35:32.040 --> 35:37.040
A lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of a sheep.

35:37.040 --> 35:41.040
At some point, Jaime realized that Cersei didn't really love him, but just kind of

35:41.040 --> 35:45.040
wanted to possess him, and that she didn't care about the type of person he was.

35:45.040 --> 35:48.040
I told you no one walks away from me.

35:50.040 --> 35:52.040
Are you going to order him to kill me?

35:52.040 --> 35:56.040
If she thought about her brother slaying the Mad King at all, she saw it as a move to protect

35:56.040 --> 35:59.040
their family, and not an act to prevent harm to the people of King's Landing.

35:59.040 --> 36:05.040
Jaime's arc in Game of Thrones was one of self-discovery, of actualization, not redemption.

36:05.040 --> 36:09.040
But there's no motivation behind him abandoning all and returning to Cersei.

36:09.040 --> 36:12.040
It's not like he did something selfless and got dishonored again.

36:12.040 --> 36:16.040
He did the right thing, showed up at Winterfell, and was more or less accepted, despite his

36:16.040 --> 36:17.040
transgressions.

36:17.040 --> 36:20.040
Pretty much everyone was on the path for giving him a second shot.

36:20.040 --> 36:21.040
Brienne gets it in.

36:21.040 --> 36:25.040
Hell, even Bran, the child he pushed out of a window, is like, you know, you had to do

36:25.040 --> 36:26.040
you, babe.

36:26.040 --> 36:27.040
I gotcha.

36:27.040 --> 36:30.040
You won't be able to help us in this fight if I let them murder you first.

36:35.040 --> 36:40.040
So all this affirmation happens, and then Jaime just kind of leaves.

36:40.040 --> 36:45.040
She's hateful, and so am I.

36:45.040 --> 36:47.040
A statement which is not supported by any of his actions.

36:47.040 --> 36:50.040
Even pushing Bran out of a window was described as,

36:50.040 --> 36:52.040
The things I do for love.

36:52.040 --> 36:55.040
And that is why his ending is bogus.

36:55.040 --> 36:59.040
Not because he had a redemption arc ruined, but because he kind of forgot about rediscovering

36:59.040 --> 37:03.040
himself when there was nothing going on in the story that would actually make him go

37:03.040 --> 37:04.040
back on that.

37:04.040 --> 37:06.040
Jaime is not hateful.

37:06.040 --> 37:09.040
The revelation in season 3 is a testament to how he never was.

37:09.040 --> 37:11.040
So what the hell is this?

37:11.040 --> 37:13.040
She's hateful.

37:15.040 --> 37:16.040
And so am I.

37:16.040 --> 37:21.040
And then in the penultimate episode, Jaime gets, well, not the worst line, but his worst

37:21.040 --> 37:22.040
line.

37:22.040 --> 37:26.040
If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that

37:26.040 --> 37:28.040
city, innocent or otherwise.

37:28.040 --> 37:31.040
To be honest, I never really cared much for them.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.040
Innocent or otherwise.

37:33.040 --> 37:40.040
Then why the fuck did you sacrifice everything, your reputation, your honor, your oath, to

37:40.040 --> 37:42.040
stab and eat the Burn Man?

37:42.040 --> 37:45.040
And I don't want to hear any of the ease and denial crap.

37:45.040 --> 37:46.040
This is the end of the show.

37:46.040 --> 37:48.040
We ain't got time for that.

37:48.040 --> 37:52.040
Jaime's narrative being totally character driven would have been fine if it went anywhere.

37:52.040 --> 37:57.040
But like Tyrion, like Jon Snow, Jaime's motivation is driven into fucking nonsense in the service

37:57.040 --> 38:01.040
of keeping him sympathetic relative to Dragon Lady bad.

38:01.040 --> 38:04.040
We know what kind of a guy Jaime is based on his actions.

38:04.040 --> 38:05.040
So for him to say,

38:05.040 --> 38:07.040
She's hateful.

38:08.040 --> 38:10.040
And so am I.

38:10.040 --> 38:14.040
Without even really giving us a why only serves as a cheap twist.

38:14.040 --> 38:17.040
It's surprising, but not unexpected, isn't it?

38:17.040 --> 38:20.040
After all, he's explaining his motivation with words.

38:20.040 --> 38:24.040
And if motivations are explained with words, that means they de facto make sense.

38:24.040 --> 38:29.040
Telling the audience the thing makes sense with your dialogue while not supporting the

38:29.040 --> 38:35.040
thing with the character's actions is kind of a trend in the last season of Game of Thrones.

38:38.040 --> 38:44.040
So Cersei Lannister, one of the greatest villains not just in TV history, but arguably in all

38:44.040 --> 38:46.040
of literature.

38:46.040 --> 38:50.040
She sure didn't have much to do by the end there, did she?

38:50.040 --> 38:54.040
All of Tyrion's stupid mistakes and wildly out of character and unmotivated sudden trust

38:54.040 --> 38:59.040
in his evil sister serve the purpose of keeping Cersei in the game.

38:59.040 --> 39:06.040
Perhaps you'll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you.

39:06.040 --> 39:11.040
Which feels even more insulting given that Cersei, close blowing up the Sept, faces no

39:11.040 --> 39:16.040
consequences nor has a secret evil plan beyond staring on a balcony and glowering over my

39:16.040 --> 39:18.040
domain with a glass of wine.

39:18.040 --> 39:19.040
Which, look, I get it.

39:19.040 --> 39:20.040
That's my usual Friday night.

39:20.040 --> 39:25.040
But, um, that's pretty much all she does in season 8.

39:25.040 --> 39:28.040
You know, besides, you know, the thing with Hot Topic Pirate.

39:28.040 --> 39:31.040
You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met.

39:33.040 --> 39:35.040
I like that.

39:35.040 --> 39:40.040
And then the show makes Cersei sympathetic, but it's like in the most condescending way possible.

39:40.040 --> 39:43.040
I want our baby to live.

39:43.040 --> 39:45.040
Don't let me die, Jane.

39:45.040 --> 39:47.040
Please don't let me die.

39:47.040 --> 39:52.040
Cersei is one of the most horrendous characters committed to film.

39:52.040 --> 39:57.040
Yet somehow at the end she's just a girl and she's just scared and he's there to comfort her.

39:57.040 --> 40:00.040
What?

40:05.040 --> 40:10.040
When the plot says so, Cersei's armies instantly crumble and she dies a weirdly sympathetic

40:10.040 --> 40:14.040
death in Jaime's arms who is here for some reason in a Rocks Fall, Everyone Dies situation

40:14.040 --> 40:19.040
that feels more on par with like a C-tier Disney movie and less in line with someone

40:19.040 --> 40:20.040
who once said,

40:20.040 --> 40:22.040
Power is power.

40:23.040 --> 40:26.040
But more than this, it's important to look at Cersei for who she is presented as a monarch

40:26.040 --> 40:30.040
and what the show built her up to be before Daenerys torched King's Landing.

40:30.040 --> 40:36.040
Let the monsters kill each other, and while they battle in the north, we take back the

40:36.040 --> 40:37.040
lands that belong to us.

40:37.040 --> 40:42.040
The big thing here, and I mean big thing as a defining action in Cersei's rule, is her

40:42.040 --> 40:47.040
effectively blowing up the in-universe equivalent of the Vatican as a means to wipe out her

40:47.040 --> 40:52.040
enemies and flex on how many fucks she gives, which is… zero.

40:52.040 --> 40:56.040
And yes, this scene was awesome, and yes, it feels like something someone as reckless

40:56.040 --> 41:00.040
and vengeful as Cersei would do when pushed to the utter brink.

41:00.040 --> 41:01.040
But.

41:01.040 --> 41:02.040
But.

41:02.040 --> 41:07.040
Prior to season 4, most of the plot of Game of Thrones is centered around the direct consequences

41:07.040 --> 41:12.040
of one guy, Ned Stark, getting his head lopped off in what pretty much everyone who wasn't

41:12.040 --> 41:16.040
the child who ordered it, even Cersei, felt was a massive dick move.

41:16.040 --> 41:21.040
Meanwhile, post season 6, Cersei not only blew up one of the largest buildings in Westeros

41:21.040 --> 41:25.040
and wiped out a decent chunk of the Faith and its leader, but also decimated one of

41:25.040 --> 41:30.040
the most powerful, wealthy, and well-liked families in Westeros with a lot of loyal bannermen,

41:30.040 --> 41:34.040
and apart from a few stray remarks from other characters,

41:34.040 --> 41:42.040
But your sister has done things I wasn't capable of imagining.

41:42.040 --> 41:47.040
this major act of mass violence, it just kinda, we just move on.

41:47.040 --> 41:48.040
It's, nobody cares.

41:48.040 --> 41:50.040
There are no consequences for this.

41:50.040 --> 41:52.040
She's crowned, and life goes on.

41:52.040 --> 41:57.040
The only person opposing her is Dragon Lady, who would have invaded no matter who was on the throne.

41:57.040 --> 41:59.040
So let's break this down.

41:59.040 --> 42:03.040
Why in God's name would they set up Cersei finally exacting revenge on the faceless masses

42:03.040 --> 42:08.040
that threw literal feces on her during her walk of shame and weeding out religious extremism

42:08.040 --> 42:13.040
with impunity, only to conveniently forget the internal logic of much smaller scale political

42:13.040 --> 42:17.040
issues like Ned Stark's execution causing massive upheaval?

42:17.040 --> 42:20.040
Not to mention, again, wasting someone like Lena Headey's talent.

42:20.040 --> 42:22.040
I wanted those elephants.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.040
Well, here's why.

42:24.040 --> 42:27.040
It's because of how Season 8 ends.

42:27.040 --> 42:34.040
This one act necessitates that, yes, Cersei would be considered an unparalleled, top-tier,

42:34.040 --> 42:36.040
Megatron-grade tyrant.

42:36.040 --> 42:41.040
She couldn't have wiped out all of the Faith Militant, or even most of them,

42:41.040 --> 42:45.040
let alone the countless followers of the Seven in Westeros who would feel understandably

42:45.040 --> 42:48.040
very pissed and personally attacked by this maneuver.

42:48.040 --> 42:52.040
This is also to say nothing of all the people who saw her as 100% illegitimate or believed

42:52.040 --> 42:56.040
that her children were inbred bastards, or who would want revenge on her for what she

42:56.040 --> 42:58.040
did to House Tyrell.

42:58.040 --> 43:01.040
So these dum-dums wrote a juicy situation which in theory could have led to some of

43:01.040 --> 43:06.040
the best acting from one of their most talented players, but the problem here is that it would

43:06.040 --> 43:10.040
have revealed her as a tyrant, leading to a situation where literally anyone with a

43:10.040 --> 43:15.040
claim to the throne would be looked upon by the people of King's Landing as a liberator.

43:15.040 --> 43:19.040
Which leads us to the person who, at least as far as everyone knows, has the best claim

43:19.040 --> 43:25.040
to the throne, and wouldn't you know it, has already defined herself as a liberator.

43:25.040 --> 43:30.040
So if Dragon Lady shows up riding some dragons like, oh hey, hi, I'm here to liberate y'all,

43:30.040 --> 43:35.040
I'm the breaker of chains, love me please, it's fair to say that D&D created a situation

43:35.040 --> 43:40.040
where, yeah, actually that sounds pretty great for the small folk of King's Landing,

43:40.040 --> 43:45.040
and the vast, vast majority of the nobles who already support her, and pretty much everyone

43:45.040 --> 43:49.040
who isn't the Iron Bank of Braavos to whom the Lannisters owe a lot of money.

43:49.040 --> 43:53.040
You can count on the Iron Bank's support.

43:53.040 --> 43:56.040
As soon as the gold arrives.

43:58.040 --> 44:02.040
They wrote a situation where there's no way Cersei would be able to maintain power

44:02.040 --> 44:06.040
after her move with the Sept without being a complete totalitarian who stomps out dissent

44:06.040 --> 44:08.040
before it even manifests.

44:08.040 --> 44:12.040
She created a situation where she'd have no choice, and she is the personality to relish

44:12.040 --> 44:13.040
that sort of thing.

44:13.040 --> 44:17.040
I killed you, High Sparrow, because it felt good.

44:17.040 --> 44:22.040
Like, oh god yes, revenge please, I lived for this, and I remember the face of every peasant

44:22.040 --> 44:26.040
who flung shit at me, and I will pull each of their fingernails out myself.

44:26.040 --> 44:30.040
And on a related note, like, you really expect me to think that, like, Cersei's gonna, like,

44:31.040 --> 44:37.040
be upset that Daenerys is murdering the innocents of King's Landing?

44:37.040 --> 44:40.040
After what they did to her, she should be like, well, you go, girl.

44:40.040 --> 44:45.040
So the only way to deal with the fallout of Cersei's actions while still barreling full

44:45.040 --> 44:50.040
steam ahead to this predetermined ending is to ignore them altogether.

44:50.040 --> 44:54.040
The show must maintain that the people of King's Landing and, hell, greater Westeros

44:54.040 --> 44:57.040
are never affected by their monarch, and that they don't care.

44:57.040 --> 45:01.040
That social trends do not apply to the rabble or the common folk, even though that was a

45:01.040 --> 45:04.040
huge chunk of the King's Landing plot for seasons five and six.

45:04.040 --> 45:09.040
That, yes, the machinations of the powerful do have effect, and that politically savvy

45:09.040 --> 45:12.040
nobles like Margaery Tyrell have sound methods.

45:12.040 --> 45:16.040
And this development in later seasons, especially with Cersei, kills me because what set Game

45:16.040 --> 45:21.040
of Thrones apart for the first few seasons was how it was so conscious of how said intrigues,

45:21.040 --> 45:26.040
be they magical or otherwise, have realistic consequences that affect not only the lives

45:26.040 --> 45:29.040
of the major characters, but also the culture of the world itself.

45:29.040 --> 45:33.040
Like in season seven during the loot train attack, Daenerys recklessly burns all that

45:33.040 --> 45:34.040
food from the Reach.

45:34.040 --> 45:37.040
That surely should have had some consequences, right?

45:37.040 --> 45:41.040
Maybe set off a touch of the old starvation?

45:41.040 --> 45:46.040
But like the destruction of the Sept, they wrote a situation that should have had consequences,

45:46.040 --> 45:48.040
but didn't.

45:48.040 --> 45:52.040
So I'm guessing that the existence of Faegon creates a situation where it makes perfect

45:52.040 --> 45:56.040
sense not only for the people of Westeros to reject Daenerys, but for her own sense

45:56.040 --> 46:01.040
of entitlement to make her descent into power obsession make sense not only based on the

46:01.040 --> 46:05.040
situation, but also based on the character that we know.

46:05.040 --> 46:09.040
Unfortunately, that is not the situation that these chuckle f***s wrote.

46:09.040 --> 46:11.040
So let's deal with Daenerys.

46:14.040 --> 46:18.040
Daenerys came to power effectively from nothing, not only because of an important name and

46:18.040 --> 46:21.040
some dragons, but because people believed in her.

46:21.040 --> 46:26.040
Just once in my life before it's over, I want to know what it's like to serve his pride.

46:26.040 --> 46:28.040
You believe in her?

46:31.040 --> 46:32.040
With all my heart.

46:32.040 --> 46:38.040
A lot of people, problematic writing or no, sacrificed a lot because they believed what

46:38.040 --> 46:39.040
she believed.

46:39.040 --> 46:41.040
What about those who swore allegiance to you?

46:41.040 --> 46:44.040
They'll all come to see you for what you are.

46:44.040 --> 46:46.040
I hope I deserve it.

46:47.040 --> 46:49.040
You do.

46:50.040 --> 46:54.040
And then she went and did some more crimes, and you didn't even see it coming cause she's

46:54.040 --> 46:55.040
pretty.

46:55.040 --> 46:57.040
Don't you feel stupid?

46:57.040 --> 47:03.040
Tyrion, Jorah, Jon Snow, all big dum-dums who fell for her not because she was a charismatic,

47:03.040 --> 47:07.040
strong-willed leader who was constantly trying to balance her not inconsiderable power with

47:07.040 --> 47:11.040
doing the right thing, but because they wanted to get into them panties.

47:11.040 --> 47:14.040
I know you love her.

47:14.040 --> 47:16.040
I love her too.

47:16.040 --> 47:19.040
Not as successfully as you.

47:20.040 --> 47:26.040
If your story is purporting to say something, which I assume this is because Drogon is burning

47:26.040 --> 47:32.040
the symbolism, it needs to have a basis of knowledge of what it is saying something about.

47:32.040 --> 47:36.040
I want to touch on the nature of power since the show is so centered around it.

47:36.040 --> 47:42.040
In the end, the show has fuck all to say about power corrupting, one presumes because the

47:42.040 --> 47:46.040
writers did not think too hard about what leads to power corrupting.

47:46.040 --> 47:47.040
Here's an anecdote.

47:47.040 --> 47:51.040
Back in the late 1930s, a man fresh out of law school was trying his first case when

47:51.040 --> 47:53.040
the judge threatened to disbar him.

47:53.040 --> 47:58.040
Said the judge, I have serious doubts whether you have the ethical qualifications to practice

47:58.040 --> 48:00.040
law.

48:00.040 --> 48:02.040
That lawyer's name?

48:02.040 --> 48:04.040
Albert Einstein.

48:04.040 --> 48:06.040
Just kidding, it was Richard Nixon.

48:06.040 --> 48:08.040
And yes, that actually happened.

48:08.040 --> 48:12.040
At the time, Nixon admitted to taking questionable actions without his client's authority.

48:12.040 --> 48:17.040
Decades later, we would discover that power did not corrupt him, he corrupted power, being

48:17.040 --> 48:20.040
president revealed to the outside world who he was all along.

48:20.040 --> 48:24.040
I have always tried to do what was best for the nation.

48:24.040 --> 48:30.040
Said author Robert Caro, reflecting on Lyndon B. Johnson, power doesn't always corrupt,

48:30.040 --> 48:31.040
power always reveals.

48:31.040 --> 48:35.040
When you have enough power to do what you always wanted to do, then you see what the

48:35.040 --> 48:37.040
guy always wanted to do.

48:37.040 --> 48:40.040
Your reign is over.

48:40.040 --> 48:42.040
My reign has just begun.

48:42.040 --> 48:46.040
And in both the books in the series, we have a pretty good idea of what Daenerys wanted

48:46.040 --> 48:48.040
to do, because she did it.

48:48.040 --> 48:49.040
Dracarys.

48:51.040 --> 48:53.040
People point to speeches like this, which, uh...

48:53.040 --> 48:58.040
I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of old Valyria, and I will take what is mine.

48:58.040 --> 49:01.040
With fire and blood, I will take it.

49:01.040 --> 49:04.040
Big speeches like this didn't match her actions.

49:04.040 --> 49:05.040
Daenerys had power.

49:05.040 --> 49:07.040
We saw what she did with it.

49:07.040 --> 49:08.040
Violence?

49:08.040 --> 49:09.040
Sure.

49:09.040 --> 49:10.040
En masse against peasants?

49:10.040 --> 49:11.040
N-n-no.

49:13.040 --> 49:17.040
Daenerys' entire arc deals with the fact that small folks suffer when lords flex military

49:17.040 --> 49:20.040
might, and her questioning when violence was worth the cost.

49:20.040 --> 49:24.040
The main reason she was doing so badly at the invasion initially was because she was

49:24.040 --> 49:26.040
trying to be more humane than Aegon the Conqueror.

49:26.040 --> 49:29.040
I am not here to be queen of the ashes.

49:30.040 --> 49:35.040
So she understandably is like, well, maybe I should just Aegon the motherfucker.

49:35.040 --> 49:37.040
Enough with the clever plans.

49:37.040 --> 49:39.040
I have three large dragons.

49:39.040 --> 49:40.040
I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.

49:40.040 --> 49:43.040
She wasn't just one of the few people with a modicum of power that was concerned with

49:43.040 --> 49:45.040
the plights of the lower classes.

49:45.040 --> 49:47.040
That was how she defined herself.

49:47.040 --> 49:49.040
Breaker of chains, protector of the innocent.

49:49.040 --> 49:53.040
I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains.

49:53.040 --> 49:57.040
And this is why I think the whole power corrupts thing is bogus where it pertains to Daenerys.

49:57.040 --> 49:58.040
She's had power.

49:58.040 --> 50:00.040
She's had it for a long time.

50:00.040 --> 50:04.040
If power hasn't revealed the real Daenerys by now, when the fuck will it?

50:04.040 --> 50:06.040
After she wins her trillionth battle?

50:06.040 --> 50:08.040
No, actually.

50:08.040 --> 50:11.040
The slaughter of unarmed civilians is not a logical progression.

50:11.040 --> 50:14.040
Varys talks about her coin still being in the air, and it's like,

50:14.040 --> 50:20.040
They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin, and the world holds its breath.

50:20.040 --> 50:21.040
Really, dude?

50:21.040 --> 50:23.040
You know what kind of leader she is.

50:23.040 --> 50:25.040
She's demonstrated it over and over.

50:25.040 --> 50:28.040
And she's been pretty consistent about when she's been punitive,

50:28.040 --> 50:30.040
when she's been inhumane to her enemies,

50:30.040 --> 50:32.040
and when she's done the right thing.

50:32.040 --> 50:34.040
Until this episode.

50:34.040 --> 50:36.040
When she reveals that she's actually super Hitler.

50:36.040 --> 50:38.040
The Hitler that flies.

50:40.040 --> 50:42.040
And then she sees the Red Keep.

50:42.040 --> 50:47.040
It's in that moment on the walls of King's Landing when she's looking at that symbol

50:47.040 --> 50:49.040
of everything that was taken from her.

50:49.040 --> 50:54.040
When she makes the decision to make this personal.

50:55.040 --> 50:56.040
What?

50:56.040 --> 50:59.040
You said it was because she wanted to rule through fear.

50:59.040 --> 51:01.040
I didn't mean fear.

51:01.040 --> 51:02.040
You said that.

51:02.040 --> 51:03.040
In the text that you wrote.

51:03.040 --> 51:05.040
You explaining it makes it worse.

51:05.040 --> 51:07.040
Now it's a 30 Rock skit.

51:07.040 --> 51:09.040
I'll now take questions.

51:09.040 --> 51:10.040
Oh no.

51:10.040 --> 51:11.040
My period.

51:11.040 --> 51:13.040
Let's nuke England!

51:13.040 --> 51:17.040
I think we all knew there was no way Daenerys was going to end up getting what she wanted.

51:17.040 --> 51:20.040
The first time I read about Faegon, my visceral reaction was,

51:20.040 --> 51:21.040
Oh.

51:21.040 --> 51:22.040
Oh no.

51:22.040 --> 51:25.040
This is going to make Daenerys do something stupid.

51:25.040 --> 51:28.040
Problem is, ain't no Faegon in the show.

51:28.040 --> 51:31.040
But with regard to the idea that power doesn't corrupt it reveals,

51:31.040 --> 51:35.040
I think you learn what you need to know about the way Daenerys handles power in season one.

51:35.040 --> 51:40.040
Khal Drogo is ready to do some pillaging because they need resources to go after that Iron Throne,

51:40.040 --> 51:43.040
and Dany is okay with it until she sees the human cost.

51:43.040 --> 51:49.040
So she pulls a white savior, saves this woman, and is betrayed by this woman because of course she is.

51:49.040 --> 51:51.040
I spoke for you.

51:51.040 --> 51:53.040
I saved you.

51:53.040 --> 51:57.040
Dany doesn't put two and two together that she is the reason this woman lost everything.

51:57.040 --> 52:03.040
So when the woman is insufficiently grateful, she burns her alive and gets three dragons out of it.

52:03.040 --> 52:07.040
So that Daenerys turns to darkness because the people of Westeros don't fall over themselves in worship

52:07.040 --> 52:10.040
is a perfectly logical progression on paper.

52:10.040 --> 52:14.040
Problem is, they put her in a position where logically the people of the North should have been grateful.

52:14.040 --> 52:16.040
To the Dragon Queen!

52:17.040 --> 52:20.040
The people of King's Landing should have been like,

52:20.040 --> 52:23.040
hell yes, thank God, literally anyone but Cersei.

52:23.040 --> 52:26.040
But then they keep explaining it like it makes sense what happened.

52:26.040 --> 52:31.040
But before she breaks, she's sad that the people of the North prefer Jon Snow, a native of the North.

52:31.040 --> 52:35.040
And I guess Dany kind of forgot that despite losing the Reach with the Tyrells,

52:35.040 --> 52:39.040
she still has the support of the North, the Vale, the Iron Islands, Dorne,

52:39.040 --> 52:42.040
and presumably Storm's End now that she's legitimized Gendry.

52:42.040 --> 52:47.040
But she decides that she'll never be loved because the people of the North prefer their hometown boy to Dragon Lady.

52:47.040 --> 52:51.040
Far more people in Westeros love you than love me.

52:51.040 --> 52:53.040
I don't have love here.

52:53.040 --> 52:54.040
Sure.

52:54.040 --> 52:57.040
What they foreshadowed is Daenerys doing awful things

52:57.040 --> 53:01.040
when she thought she had a good reason for doing them.

53:01.040 --> 53:04.040
Not, you know, no reason.

53:04.040 --> 53:07.040
She was ruthless, sure, and she made some bad decisions,

53:07.040 --> 53:11.040
but she never surrounded herself with yes-men, the main hallmark of a corrupt leader,

53:11.040 --> 53:15.040
instead seeking out dissent from her advisors and actually listening to them,

53:15.040 --> 53:18.040
even when they were giving her shit garbage advice.

53:18.040 --> 53:19.040
Tyrion.

53:19.040 --> 53:25.040
Cersei thinks the army of the dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children.

53:25.040 --> 53:27.040
What if we prove her wrong?

53:27.040 --> 53:31.040
But defenders of the show insist that Daenerys was meaningfully different as a ruler from anyone else

53:31.040 --> 53:33.040
because the framing said so.

53:36.040 --> 53:39.040
See? Tyrion, make a sad face.

53:39.040 --> 53:41.040
Because suddenly we're concerned with the cost of war,

53:41.040 --> 53:45.040
because fire as a battle strategy is immoral now.

53:45.040 --> 53:46.040
I guess.

53:46.040 --> 53:48.040
Five seasons?

53:48.040 --> 53:51.040
How much of this show has happened while I was, like, putting it off

53:51.040 --> 53:53.040
because I meant to read the books?

53:53.040 --> 53:54.040
Should I read the books?

53:54.040 --> 53:57.040
Leave a comment in the description of Lindsay's video.

54:02.040 --> 54:04.040
No, Daenerys wasn't always compassionate,

54:04.040 --> 54:07.040
but she made rational decisions, negative or positive.

54:07.040 --> 54:11.040
You can't have this sort of medieval wartime code that the characters all live by,

54:11.040 --> 54:15.040
and then in the last three episodes have everyone suddenly concerned with the cost of war,

54:15.040 --> 54:18.040
especially when there is apparently no material cost,

54:18.040 --> 54:21.040
no mass starvation, no uprisings, nothing.

54:21.040 --> 54:26.040
Why is Tyrion, who blew up an entire fleet with horrible magic fire,

54:26.040 --> 54:30.040
all of a sudden like, but your grace, what about the Geneva Conventions?

54:30.040 --> 54:33.040
Now we're treating what Daenerys does in this scene as somehow morally worse

54:33.040 --> 54:38.040
than Jon Snow's mass execution, which included a child in season six,

54:38.040 --> 54:43.040
or what Ned Stark did to a scared teenager who was running from ice zombies in season one.

54:43.040 --> 54:47.040
So that's all noble then, but in season seven it's foreshadowing some war crimes, I guess,

54:47.040 --> 54:50.040
because she used a dragon and not a giant f***ing sword.

54:50.040 --> 54:52.040
None of these people wanting to betray her,

54:52.040 --> 54:57.040
except arguably Sansa, the Separatist, who is a Separatist for some f***ing reason.

54:57.040 --> 54:59.040
What about the North?

55:00.040 --> 55:02.040
It's just one of those-

55:02.040 --> 55:07.040
is rooted in any motivation that is based on what has materially changed during seasons seven and eight,

55:07.040 --> 55:12.040
only hunches that just kind of appeared one day because the plot needed it to.

55:12.040 --> 55:14.040
But here's the thing that was never foreshadowed.

55:14.040 --> 55:17.040
Dany being irrational, Dany denying reality.

55:17.040 --> 55:23.040
If someone said, here is why, never once did she go, no, that is very clearly X.

55:23.040 --> 55:25.040
You buried the lead too deeply.

55:25.040 --> 55:27.040
This was just not the character you wrote.

55:27.040 --> 55:30.040
In the end, it's not just cynical, it's meaningless.

55:30.040 --> 55:33.040
It's one big reason why the ending left people feeling so hollow.

55:33.040 --> 55:37.040
It doesn't say anything about the nature of power and the descent into corruption and cruelty,

55:37.040 --> 55:40.040
just that some people's genes are a time bomb.

55:40.040 --> 55:45.040
Daenerys doesn't have a character progression that ends with her tragic descent into authoritarianism.

55:45.040 --> 55:49.040
Her Targaryen genes were dormant for a while, but wouldn't you know, them bells.

55:49.040 --> 55:55.040
That red keep just triggered those genes and suddenly out of nowhere Daenerys is denying reality.

55:55.040 --> 56:01.040
And then she sees the red keep when she makes the decision to make this personal.

56:01.040 --> 56:06.040
And I've seen countless reinterpretations of this episode where people try to make it make sense,

56:06.040 --> 56:11.040
to make her rampage a little more in character and justified and motivated.

56:11.040 --> 56:14.040
D&D might be hacks, but they aren't stupid.

56:14.040 --> 56:20.040
They could have easily made her rampage make sense in any dozens of ways, but that was not the point.

56:20.040 --> 56:24.040
The point was to make her as monstrous as possible.

56:24.040 --> 56:30.040
For one reason only, Tyrion and Jon Snow have to remain sympathetic.

56:30.040 --> 56:33.040
Daenerys' murder has to be seen as totally morally justified.

56:33.040 --> 56:37.040
Even though having a victim of physical and sexual abuse rise to great power,

56:37.040 --> 56:43.040
only to be lured into a false sense of security and murdered by the man she loves in a moment of physical intimacy,

56:43.040 --> 56:51.040
she goes on a nonsense rampage so then she can then soap opera die at the hands of a sympathetic hero by way of the worst of tropes.

56:51.040 --> 56:53.040
Save me.

56:53.040 --> 56:55.040
I love you.

56:55.040 --> 56:59.040
You've gone, Dark Phoenix. You've become too powerful.

56:59.040 --> 57:03.040
It's so sad what I have to do to the woman I love, but it has to be done.

57:05.040 --> 57:07.040
I love you.

57:07.040 --> 57:11.040
It's for your own good, don't you see? I had to do it.

57:11.040 --> 57:15.040
Look what you made me do, Daenerys. I had to do it.

57:15.040 --> 57:17.040
Look what you made me do.

57:17.040 --> 57:20.040
Her actions have to be indescribably monstrous

57:20.040 --> 57:25.040
because the narrative has to justify the violence Tyrion and Jon Snow do to her body

57:25.040 --> 57:28.040
while keeping these characters sympathetic to the audience.

57:28.040 --> 57:30.040
And that's all there is to it.

57:30.040 --> 57:34.040
Much attention has been paid to the bad writing in the Emmy-nominated final episode,

57:34.040 --> 57:38.040
but to me, this is the ultimate summation of what failed about the ending,

57:38.040 --> 57:41.040
arguably the most insulting line in television history.

57:41.040 --> 57:47.040
Everywhere she goes, evil men die, and we cheer her for it.

57:47.040 --> 57:49.040
They're doing, like, a thing, see?

57:49.040 --> 57:52.040
Oh, you liked Daenerys. You supported her.

57:52.040 --> 57:54.040
When you should have seen it coming.

57:54.040 --> 57:57.040
She's showing all the hallmarks of a fascist,

57:57.040 --> 58:01.040
like a red-and-black color scheme and Nazi clothes.

58:01.040 --> 58:03.040
That's what fascism is, right?

58:03.040 --> 58:06.040
When she murdered the slavers of Astapor,

58:06.040 --> 58:08.040
sure no one but the slavers complained.

58:08.040 --> 58:10.040
After all, they were evil men.

58:10.040 --> 58:13.040
When she crucified hundreds of Myrnae's nobles,

58:13.040 --> 58:16.040
who could argue they were evil men?

58:16.040 --> 58:19.040
The Dothraki calls she burned alive.

58:19.040 --> 58:22.040
They would have done worse to her.

58:22.040 --> 58:28.040
Everywhere she goes, evil men die, and we cheer her for it.

58:28.040 --> 58:32.040
So D&D are invoking Niemöller's first-they-came poem

58:32.040 --> 58:34.040
to equate Daenerys killing slavers and rapists

58:34.040 --> 58:37.040
to Nazis persecuting socialists and Jews.

58:37.040 --> 58:40.040
And you, the audience, were cheering her on,

58:40.040 --> 58:43.040
you enablers, you lovers of blood sport.

58:43.040 --> 58:45.040
Tyrion, and by extension the audience,

58:45.040 --> 58:47.040
supported Daenerys' slip into fascism

58:47.040 --> 58:49.040
because we agreed with her politics,

58:49.040 --> 58:51.040
even if the means were kind of iffy.

58:51.040 --> 58:53.040
She othered the bad guy, and we cheered her on

58:53.040 --> 58:55.040
because we agreed the bad guy was bad.

58:55.040 --> 58:57.040
But then she turned her ire on innocents,

58:57.040 --> 58:59.040
so really the audience needs to confront

58:59.040 --> 59:01.040
what authoritarian they support.

59:03.040 --> 59:06.040
Now here's why that's fucking stupid.

59:06.040 --> 59:08.040
As we see in First They Came, yes,

59:08.040 --> 59:11.040
fascists create an enemy and use it as a rallying point.

59:11.040 --> 59:14.040
The OG Nazis started with socialists and communists

59:14.040 --> 59:16.040
and worked their way out from there.

59:16.040 --> 59:18.040
And the German people were okay with it because,

59:18.040 --> 59:20.040
hey, ends justify the means,

59:20.040 --> 59:22.040
and hey, maybe the socialists and the communists

59:22.040 --> 59:24.040
and the Jews and the gays and the disabled people

59:24.040 --> 59:26.040
are actually the problem.

59:26.040 --> 59:28.040
And then they turn around and act all surprised

59:28.040 --> 59:30.040
when that ends in genocide some ten years later.

59:30.040 --> 59:34.040
But Daenerys isn't scapegoating just anyone as the enemy.

59:34.040 --> 59:36.040
How many slaves are there in Yunkai?

59:36.040 --> 59:40.040
200,000, if not more.

59:40.040 --> 59:44.040
Then we have 200,000 reasons to take the city.

59:44.040 --> 59:46.040
The other she uses to justify her authoritarianism

59:46.040 --> 59:48.040
isn't a political party or dissidents

59:48.040 --> 59:50.040
or an ethnic group.

59:50.040 --> 59:52.040
It's the institution of slavery itself.

59:52.040 --> 59:54.040
So in the end, her tragic authoritarianism

59:54.040 --> 59:56.040
is rooted in the fact that

59:56.040 --> 59:58.040
she wants to end all forms of slavery

59:58.040 --> 01:00:00.040
too much.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:06.040
It's not easy to see something that's never been before.

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:08.040
She wants to break too many chains.

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:12.040
The ultimate, what if woke but too much.

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.040
When she crucified hundreds of Merenese nobles,

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:18.040
who could argue they were evil men?

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.040
First she came for the slavers,

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:24.040
and I did not speak out because I was not a slaver.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.040
Then she came for the slave masters

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.040
that crucified a bunch of slave children,

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:30.040
and I did not speak out.

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.040
Then she killed a bunch of fucking innocent women and children,

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:34.040
so really I'm the idiot, I guess.

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:36.040
1-2 progression, should have seen that coming.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:38.040
It really makes you think.

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:40.040
We live in a society.

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:44.040
Everywhere she goes, evil men die,

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:46.040
and we cheer her for it.

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:48.040
Like, hey assholes,

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:50.040
first they came as a poem about gentile complacency

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:52.040
during the fucking holocaust.

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:54.040
You can't make an argument about Daenerys' methods

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:56.040
being cruel or unusual when she's more or less

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:58.040
been on the level with every other

01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:00.040
marginally decent leader in this universe.

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.040
Sansa feeds her enemy to his own dogs.

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:04.040
Jon hangs all of the insurrectionists,

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:06.040
including a child, heads on spikes.

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:08.040
Wow, it's a thing in this universe.

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:12.040
Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:14.040
Arya murdering an entire house

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:16.040
and then baking them into pies

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.040
and then feeding them to their father, but

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.040
They weren't easy to carve.

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:22.040
Execution by dragon is a bridge too far.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:24.040
It's effectively calling the audience hypocrites

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:26.040
when you hold your own damn characters

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:28.040
to a weird double standard.

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:30.040
Daenerys, who spent more or less the entire series

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:32.040
having discussions on her political aims

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.040
versus the ethics of her means,

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:36.040
is the one we really need to look into our hearts

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:38.040
and be like, wow.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:40.040
I guess her reacting coldly

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.040
when her abusive brother does something stupid

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.040
she knows will get him killed was a warning sign.

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:46.040
Even when you look back to season one

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:48.040
when Khal Drogo gives the golden crown to Viserys

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:50.040
and her reaction on watching her brother's head

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.040
melted off, there is something kind of

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:54.040
chilling about the way that Dany has responded

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:56.040
to the death of her enemies.

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:58.040
Wow. We live in a society.

01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:00.040
It really makes you think.

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:02.040
But if we're following the worst-case scenario

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:04.040
of fascism that ends in genocide,

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.040
then the worst-case scenario for Daenerys

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:08.040
is what happens in season four.

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:10.040
The indiscriminate crucifixion of her enemies,

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:12.040
the wise masters of Meereen,

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:14.040
some of whom were complicit in crucifying slave children,

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.040
some of whom were not.

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.040
Genocide against the randos of King's Landing

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:20.040
for absolutely no reason

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.040
doesn't follow any meaningful progression

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:24.040
of fascism or authoritarianism.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:26.040
So, Tyrion, it really makes you think

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:28.040
in the audience

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:30.040
because they considered her enemies acceptable targets

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.040
only to be shocked when she slaughters innocents

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:34.040
isn't just insulting,

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:36.040
it's meaningless.

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:38.040
If you read the script for the final episode,

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:40.040
The Iron Throne,

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.040
which leaked when Emmy voting started,

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:44.040
the moment where Tyrion throws down

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:46.040
his Hand of the Queen pin

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:48.040
is paired with the script direction

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.040
this is liberation, he doesn't believe

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.040
in liberation theology.

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:54.040
Which is so

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:56.040
revealing with regard to

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:58.040
the point that these guys were going for.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:00.040
Why did people

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:02.040
follow Daenerys? Was it just because

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:04.040
she was powerful?

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:06.040
Or because they wanted it in her panties?

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:08.040
Or was it because they agreed with her politics?

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:10.040
Everywhere she goes,

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:12.040
evil men die

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:14.040
and we cheer

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.040
her for it.

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:18.040
Tyrion, yes.

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:20.040
You cheered her on, not just because she had dragons,

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.040
but because you agreed with her politics.

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.040
Raping and pillaging

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:26.040
bad. Unjust hierarchy

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.040
bad. Slavery bad.

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:30.040
And she grows more powerful

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:32.040
and more sure that she is good

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:34.040
and right.

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:36.040
The argument Tyrion is making is that

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.040
if someone has the power, with enough

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.040
encouragement and enough self-reassurance,

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.040
and if they believe in their cause enough,

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.040
this sort of thing is inevitable,

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.040
isn't it? The righteousness of

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:48.040
your beliefs don't really matter.

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:50.040
What matters is the strength of those beliefs.

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.040
And that's what's dangerous.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.040
And that's what you have to watch out for.

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.040
And that is why good king Bran is

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.040
good. That is why the best ruler is someone

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.040
who doesn't really want it. Bran has

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:02.040
no politics. Bran believes in nothing.

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:04.040
Impartiality and emotionlessness

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.040
are the qualities of a fine leader

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:08.040
because Dragon Lady believed in herself

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:10.040
and building a better world too much.

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:12.040
And women are just too emotional to lead,

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:14.040
which is why the only good woman leader

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:16.040
is the one who's been sapped of her humanity.

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.040
Believing in a righteous cause

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:20.040
turns dangerous if you believe in it too

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:22.040
hard. And really,

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.040
in the year of our lord, 2019,

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:26.040
does that add anything

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:28.040
of value?

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:34.040
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand?

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:38.040
Oh, that I were a glove upon

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.040
that hand that I might touch that cheek.

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:42.040
The cultural endurance

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:44.040
of any story has much to do with the

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:46.040
desire to retell it, despite

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:48.040
knowing how it ends.

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.040
They'll rust

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:52.040
and let me die.

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:54.040
Breaking Bad is

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:56.040
not devalued by knowing the ending.

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:58.040
The Sopranos is not devalued by

01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:00.040
knowing the ending. Romeo and Juliet

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:02.040
tells you the ending at the beginning of the

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:04.040
play. From forth the fatal

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:06.040
loins of these two foes,

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:08.040
a pair of star-crossed

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:10.040
lovers take their life.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.040
Making case not just for

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:14.040
this tragedy, but for the endurance of

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:16.040
tragic stories in general, Romeo

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:18.040
and Juliet, Orpheus and Eurydice,

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.040
we tell and retell these stories

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:22.040
despite knowing how they're going

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:24.040
to end. I bring this up

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:26.040
because knowing how the show

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:28.040
ends, are you going to

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:30.040
begin to watch it again? What is

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:32.040
the legacy of Game of Thrones going to be?

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:34.040
Because there are endings that ruin

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:36.040
a story in hindsight. I used

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:38.040
to watch and rewatch the earlier seasons

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:40.040
of this show, but now, knowing how it ends,

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:42.040
knowing what they're building towards,

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:44.040
knowing how nihilistic and stupid

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.040
and mean it ends up being, there's

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:48.040
just no enjoyment in the journey

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:50.040
anymore. Even in the very

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.040
long process of making these two

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:54.040
episodes, rewatching old

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.040
Game of Thrones was just an exercise

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:58.040
in frustration, because

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:00.040
you know now that the build-up

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:02.040
that they're going towards has little

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:04.040
or no payoff. The enjoyment of

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:06.040
experiencing a story should not be ruined

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:08.040
by knowing how it ends.

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:10.040
I think that after the dust settles and all

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:12.040
the hot takes are taken, and I

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:14.040
recognize I'm probably at the end of this train,

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:16.040
the answer is going to be no.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:18.040
It's not going to be remembered for the

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:20.040
journey we all undertook, it's going

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:22.040
to be remembered as a

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:24.040
thing that was ruined by its ending.

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:26.040
One of the greatest examples of that.

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:28.040
Maybe ever.

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:30.040
Hmm.

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:32.040
This is kind of a downer ending.

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:34.040
I'll take off the cinnamon totes. Crunch.

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:36.040
So there is one thing that I feel

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:38.040
has kind of gone under-reported,

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:40.040
and that is the nature of the backlash.

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:42.040
And I feel like there's kind of a

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.040
false equivalency comparing it to

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:46.040
other backlashes in recent memory like,

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:48.040
well, Star Wars.

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:50.040
Because in this case, most of the

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.040
ire kind of remained where it

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:54.040
was deserved. And I feel like

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:56.040
there's a false equivalency

01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:58.040
where it remained where it was deserved.

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:00.040
In this case, the showrunners

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.040
who wielded absolute power

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:04.040
against the wishes of the author they

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:06.040
were adapting, and even the network that was

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:08.040
funding them. The nature of the backlash

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:10.040
mostly stuck to what was relevant. The writing.

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:12.040
The characters. And it didn't

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:14.040
spill over into, like, misogyny

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:16.040
and toxicity as it usually

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:18.040
does. You didn't see any

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:20.040
actors being bullied off of social media.

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:22.040
But I point this out because the backlash

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:24.040
wasn't completely negative.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.040
A lot of people who were disappointed with the way

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:28.040
the show ended wanted to make it clear

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:30.040
that they really did care

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:32.040
about the show, and they didn't blame the cast or

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.040
crew, or especially the actors,

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.040
who tend to be the people that bear the brunt

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:38.040
of backlash. So there was a Reddit user

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:40.040
named Ellalaria who decided to

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:42.040
start a fundraiser for Amelia

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:44.040
Clark's charity. Since earlier this year,

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:46.040
Amelia Clark came out about having two brain

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:48.040
aneurysms and nearly dying during

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:50.040
the earlier seasons of Game of Thrones.

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:52.040
And a bunch of Reddit users, most

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:54.040
of whom were in the crowd that was

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:56.040
really disappointed with the way the show ended,

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:58.040
came together and had a big

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.040
fundraiser for Amelia Clark's

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:02.040
charity, Same You. You're raising money

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:04.040
for Same You? I can't

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:06.040
believe it. I'm so incredibly,

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.040
like, moved

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:10.040
and blown away and grateful

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:12.040
and thank you and thank you and thank you.

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:14.040
Because through all of this, people like

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:16.040
Amelia Clark and Kit Harington

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.040
have an unbelievable pressure on them

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.040
for a thing

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:22.040
they really can't even control.

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:24.040
I think it's pretty obvious

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.040
that Amelia Clark was not thrilled with the

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:28.040
way things ended.

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:30.040
Best season ever!

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:32.040
So I have a link for the fundraiser

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:34.040
in the comments that's still ongoing. And I hope

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.040
that if we take a lesson from this, it's that

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:38.040
if there is negativity

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:40.040
and it does become organized

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.040
in the way that it has,

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:44.040
take inspiration from the fact that sometimes

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.040
that organized

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:48.040
anger can be turned to

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:50.040
a good thing. Because at the end of the day,

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:52.040
you have to love something

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:54.040
a lot to be this disappointed.

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:58.040
Who let the dogs out?

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:00.040
Who let the dogs out?

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:02.040
Who let the dogs out?

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.040
Who? Who? Who? Who?

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:06.040
I'm not a knight.

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:08.040
Who let the dogs out?

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:10.040
You're a talker.

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:12.040
This means

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:14.040
talkers.

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:16.040
Makes me thirsty.

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:18.040
Thirsty. Thirsty. Thirsty.

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:26.040
Thirsty. Thirsty.

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:32.040
You're a talker.

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:34.040
You're a talker.

01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:46.040
Why does there have to be a king on the Iron Throne?

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:48.040
Why can't we be an autonomous collective?

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:50.040
You're fooling yourself. We're living in a dictatorship.

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:52.040
A self-perpetuating autocracy

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:54.040
in which the control of the dragons-

01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:56.040
Oh there you go, bringing dragons into it again.

01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:58.040
Well that's what it's all about!

01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:00.040
Why have stories at all? What purpose do they serve?

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:02.040
They bring people together, I guess.

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:04.040
And Bran's story is

01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:06.040
better than everyone else's which

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:08.040
would make him a good ruler.

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:10.040
I'm your king.

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:12.040
Well I didn't vote for you.

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:14.040
You don't vote for kings?

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.040
Well I do become king then.

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:18.040
And who has a better story

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:20.040
than Bran the Broken?

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:22.040
That is why I'm your king.

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:24.040
Listen, strange dwarves

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:26.040
sitting in councils telling good stories

01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:28.040
is no basis for a system of government.

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:30.040
Be quiet!

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:32.040
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:34.040
just because some rhapsodic dwarf strung a narrative together.

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:36.040
Shut up!

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:38.040
I mean if I went round saying I was an emperor

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:40.040
just because I could recount the entire plot of Anna Karenina

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:42.040
they'd put me away.

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:44.040
Shut up, will you? Shut up!

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.040
Now we see the violence inherent in the system.
