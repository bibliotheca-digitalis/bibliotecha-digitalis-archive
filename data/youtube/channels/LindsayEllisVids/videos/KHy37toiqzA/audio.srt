00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,400
So, as I was doing the research for the King Kong episode, I stumbled across this article which I won't link here for, you know, reasons.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:15,400
Not the least of which, it's like 10 years old, but it was like this pearl-clutching thing in light of the then-newly-released King Kong movie,

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:22,000
and it was about Adrien Brody's character and how we used to have manly men, but now we have this,

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,600
and he's like this effete-sensitive intellectual writer, and he's not manly at all.

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,400
Where did all the real men go?

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:38,600
And while that's, you know, shitty, it did make me start to think about how these movies present masculinity,

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:46,200
and not the Kong version of masculinity, but that of his rivals, because it varies a lot.

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:56,200
So, 1933, 1976, and 2005, we have three very different characters who exist in contrast to King Kong as and Darrow's real love interest.

9
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:02,200
Kong changes, really not all that much between these three versions, and Anne doesn't change a whole lot either.

10
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:10,800
The Anne's get more depth as incarnations progress, become more sympathetic to Kong, and occasionally really turned on by Kong,

11
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:17,200
but, you know, she's always an aspiring actress, always a bit of a demure pleaser, always...

12
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:24,200
But the Jacks change a lot. His personality changes, his job changes,

13
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,200
the reason he's even on the boat in the first place is completely different between each movie,

14
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,200
and that's interesting because, A, this story does not have a lot of variation between incarnations,

15
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:43,200
and B, King Kong, the story, is effectively a love triangle, meaning that our human love interest, our Jacks,

16
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,200
he's, um, he's the PETA, yeah.

17
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,200
30-ish years between huge remakes, and this is if we ignore the non-exclusively American productions,

18
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:00,200
which are interesting in their own right, but for the sake of this video, I'm focusing only on the variations of the original Jack Driscoll,

19
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:07,200
as we take a look at the civilized masculine that contrasts our beast, this is the Jacks of King Kong.

20
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,200
Beauty and the Beast

21
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,200
So in the 1933 version, our chief players are our aspiring actress-slash-damsel,

22
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,200
the uncivilized beast what kidnaps her, the Hollywood hotshot, and Jack Driscoll.

23
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,200
He is the first mate, and he hates women. No, no, no really, they actually say that.

24
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,200
Why, Jack, you hate women.

25
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,200
He doesn't like them on the ship, see, he doesn't like them on the ship.

26
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,200
You hate women.

27
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,200
He doesn't like them on the ship, see, he thinks they're a nuisance, all getting in the way with their lady bits.

28
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,200
Uh, you're alright, but, but, but women, women just can't help being a bother.

29
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:52,200
But this was all just a front, really. Like all toddlers, Jack was really just protesting too much because he actually kind of liked her.

30
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,200
I'm scared for you.

31
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
I'm scared of you, too.

32
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,200
Say, I guess I love you.

33
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,200
That is such a tremendous f***ing jump to, actually, actually no, I take that back.

34
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,200
That might be the realest statement anyone has ever made about love in a movie. I take it back.

35
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:17,200
While Carl Denham drives the plot, and Jack is Anne's love interest, neither have anything really to do with each other.

36
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,200
So Jack, having nothing to do with the actual plot, his sole function in this movie,

37
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:29,200
is to act in contrast to Kong as Anne's love interest, the obviously desirable male alternative.

38
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,200
Oh, this is no place for a girl.

39
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:38,200
And while this trope of a character never really went away, we still see this guy today in some forms.

40
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,200
He is a huge contrast to Brody's Jack, so much so that he needed to be parodized in the remake.

41
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,200
I guess you don't think much of women on ships, do you?

42
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
No, they're a nuisance.

43
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,200
That was the only way to contextualize the way he treated Anne, to look back at the 30s and go,

44
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,200
Oh, you. Oh, backwards you.

45
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,200
Thank God the 70s came along.

46
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,200
Speaking of which...

47
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,200
I'm Jack Prescott. I'm from Princeton, Department of Primate Paleontology.

48
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,200
Department of Prima- You lying hippie!

49
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,200
Jeff Bridges plays Jack Prescott, winner of the Worst Beard Ever award,

50
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,200
and he's an environmentalist, and that, you know, is not easy to do well.

51
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,200
I'm not sure it has ever actually been done well in a movie.

52
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,200
He has a much more concrete reason to even be here.

53
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,200
He stows away because he's a primate paleontologist,

54
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,200
so in that way he has an actual connection to Kong and the plot.

55
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:38,200
That never really goes anywhere, except in the form of him talking down to every f***ing person.

56
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,200
He's probably telling us we've contaminated their magic.

57
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,200
Wow, buddy, you're just an expert in everything, huh?

58
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,200
He doesn't speak the language of the tribe, for instance,

59
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,200
but he can just intuit what they say with astonishing accuracy,

60
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
because he gets it, man.

61
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,200
He wants to make a deal. Six of them for Dwan.

62
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,200
You know, he's not, like, the man. He gets it.

63
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,200
When we took Kong, we kidnapped their god.

64
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,200
A year from now, that'll be an island full of burnt-out drunks.

65
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,200
Wow. F*** you.

66
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,200
See, the movie frames him like he's this Cassandra.

67
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,200
He's the one that's always right, because he gets it, man.

68
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
But nobody ever listens to him,

69
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,200
even though he is often a font of the worst ideas imaginable

70
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,200
and the rare instance that somebody does listen to him.

71
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,200
Let him climb to the top of the World Trade Center.

72
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
What?

73
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,200
See, because 70s, this movie has a confused relationship to the brand of feminism

74
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,200
that was big in pop culture at the time,

75
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,200
and therefore Dwan has a confused relationship to this chuckle f***.

76
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,200
But I think he's meant less to be appealing to Dwan,

77
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,200
or any woman in the audience, presumably,

78
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,200
and more to be a reflection on how some righteous dudes saw themselves.

79
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,200
You took an advance.

80
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,200
I just donated that in your name to the SPCA fund for sending Kong home.

81
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Because they get it, man. They get it.

82
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Even an environmental rapist like you, even you.

83
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Oh, man, you were the very worst.

84
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,200
It's no wonder the 80s were the way they were if you were the act we had to follow.

85
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,200
Moving on.

86
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,200
How'd you think this would end, Kong?

87
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,200
In a pre-Lord of the Rings version of this movie,

88
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,200
Jack was going to be one of the fighter pilots that shot Kong down.

89
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,200
How's that for symbolism?

90
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Instead, Jack Driscoll is a writer instead of a sailor or an environmentalist.

91
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,200
And I don't think you can really pin that on the fact that it was 2005

92
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
and men have to be sensitive now.

93
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Jack Driscoll could have been a variety of characters depending on the filmmaker.

94
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,200
Like, imagine if it had been Michael Bay that remade King Kong,

95
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,200
and Jack could have been like this insecure, objectifying,

96
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,200
possessive, entitled little asshat manchild.

97
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Or McG could have made this movie and he could have been played by

98
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,200
any one of these guys that nobody can tell apart.

99
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,200
It could have been anything.

100
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,200
And so, Peter Jackson being the guy that made it,

101
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,200
sensitive writer is what we got.

102
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,200
The character of Jack has really been split in two.

103
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,200
Adrian Brody plays Jack Driscoll,

104
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,200
and then there's an actor in the movie within the movie

105
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,200
that plays a Jack-like character

106
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,200
who is basically a pastiche of OG Jack Driscoll.

107
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
Now they're a nuisance.

108
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,200
Jack is the movie within a movie's screenwriter.

109
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,200
Unlike the previous two films, Anne knows Jack's work

110
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,200
and knows who he is before she meets him.

111
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,200
And she also admires him greatly beforehand.

112
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Some guy, Driscoll.

113
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Driscoll.

114
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
But that's kind of it.

115
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,200
She admires his work,

116
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,200
but she doesn't really have that much in common with him as a person.

117
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,200
None of the Annes really have anything in common with any of the Jacks.

118
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,200
So there's this sort of dichotomy between

119
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,200
what I can offer you versus what Kong can offer you.

120
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,200
In effect, Kong is indeed the id.

121
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,200
He is emotion, and sometimes in a sexual way,

122
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,200
and Jack is intellectual stimulation.

123
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
Some of the time.

124
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,200
That deep connection that O5 Anne develops with Kong

125
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,200
is because they're just both so damn lonely,

126
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
which Jack, he isn't. Not really.

127
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,200
Jack already has a love in his life, and that's his work.

128
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,200
I've been in love with you.

129
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
He does take inspiration from Anne for his work,

130
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,200
and she admires his work, but it doesn't really go deeper than that.

131
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
I'm writing it for you.

132
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
Why would you do that?

133
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,200
So when Jack rescues her from Kong,

134
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,200
she's almost disappointed.

135
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,200
I mean, sure, civilization's nice and all,

136
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
but the real emotional connection she develops in the film

137
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
is with Kong, not with Jack.

138
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,200
This is a complete 180 from the original,

139
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
where it's totally one-sided.

140
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,200
But on the other hand, in that one, she's with Jack because, hey, why not?

141
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
But in the end, do they even end up together?

142
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
You know, we don't really know.

143
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,200
The Jacks are always playing a sort of contrast

144
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
to whatever Anne is feeling about Kong,

145
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,200
be that emotion fear, or arousal, or friendship.

146
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,200
Given that the 76 version is by far the shakiest of the three,

147
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,200
I'm not sure what Jeff Bridges being a smug, obnoxious hippie

148
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
brings to the table as a contrast to

149
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Dwan's confused, sexy-times feelings about Kong.

150
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,200
Maybe it's because this pretentious beardo

151
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,200
would cause any vag to calcify into dust,

152
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,200
so of course Kong looks like a sexy alternative.

153
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Lady God preserve thee.

154
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
Fuck you!

155
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
But I don't think any of these movies are trying to present

156
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,200
some form of idealized masculinity,

157
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
because none of the Jacks really get the girl.

158
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,200
OG Jack kinda does, maybe.

159
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,200
He loves Anne because the movie said so.

160
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
Jack Prescott isn't with Anne at the end because,

161
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,200
I don't know, celebrity or something.

162
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,200
And Brody Driscoll Jack, it ends with a platonic hug.

163
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,200
He cares, sure, but they kinda seem to be over each other

164
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
before the whole New York rampage even takes place.

165
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Like, they weren't even talking.

166
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,200
So what I take from this is that

167
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,200
we aren't changing this character for changing the character's sake.

168
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,200
But where the Anne-slash-Kong-Beauty-and-the-Beast dynamic

169
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,200
is a lot more timeless,

170
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,200
the more normalized I'm-a-man-and-you're-a-woman dynamic

171
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,200
has shifted a lot in the last 80 years.

172
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,200
And so who knows what we will be seeing

173
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,200
in remakes of The Hunger Games

174
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,200
30 or 40 years from now.

175
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
What will PETA look like then?

176
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,200
Hmm.
