0	7400	So, as I was doing the research for the King Kong episode, I stumbled across this article which I won't link here for, you know, reasons.
7400	15400	Not the least of which, it's like 10 years old, but it was like this pearl-clutching thing in light of the then-newly-released King Kong movie,
15400	22000	and it was about Adrien Brody's character and how we used to have manly men, but now we have this,
22000	27600	and he's like this effete-sensitive intellectual writer, and he's not manly at all.
28400	30400	Where did all the real men go?
30400	38600	And while that's, you know, shitty, it did make me start to think about how these movies present masculinity,
38600	46200	and not the Kong version of masculinity, but that of his rivals, because it varies a lot.
46200	56200	So, 1933, 1976, and 2005, we have three very different characters who exist in contrast to King Kong as and Darrow's real love interest.
56200	62200	Kong changes, really not all that much between these three versions, and Anne doesn't change a whole lot either.
62200	70800	The Anne's get more depth as incarnations progress, become more sympathetic to Kong, and occasionally really turned on by Kong,
70800	77200	but, you know, she's always an aspiring actress, always a bit of a demure pleaser, always...
78200	84200	But the Jacks change a lot. His personality changes, his job changes,
84200	89200	the reason he's even on the boat in the first place is completely different between each movie,
89200	95200	and that's interesting because, A, this story does not have a lot of variation between incarnations,
95200	103200	and B, King Kong, the story, is effectively a love triangle, meaning that our human love interest, our Jacks,
103200	107200	he's, um, he's the PETA, yeah.
107200	113200	30-ish years between huge remakes, and this is if we ignore the non-exclusively American productions,
113200	120200	which are interesting in their own right, but for the sake of this video, I'm focusing only on the variations of the original Jack Driscoll,
120200	127200	as we take a look at the civilized masculine that contrasts our beast, this is the Jacks of King Kong.
128200	130200	Beauty and the Beast
130200	135200	So in the 1933 version, our chief players are our aspiring actress-slash-damsel,
135200	141200	the uncivilized beast what kidnaps her, the Hollywood hotshot, and Jack Driscoll.
141200	146200	He is the first mate, and he hates women. No, no, no really, they actually say that.
146200	149200	Why, Jack, you hate women.
149200	153200	He doesn't like them on the ship, see, he doesn't like them on the ship.
153200	155200	You hate women.
155200	161200	He doesn't like them on the ship, see, he thinks they're a nuisance, all getting in the way with their lady bits.
161200	166200	Uh, you're alright, but, but, but women, women just can't help being a bother.
166200	172200	But this was all just a front, really. Like all toddlers, Jack was really just protesting too much because he actually kind of liked her.
172200	174200	I'm scared for you.
174200	176200	I'm scared of you, too.
176200	180200	Say, I guess I love you.
180200	185200	That is such a tremendous f***ing jump to, actually, actually no, I take that back.
185200	190200	That might be the realest statement anyone has ever made about love in a movie. I take it back.
190200	197200	While Carl Denham drives the plot, and Jack is Anne's love interest, neither have anything really to do with each other.
197200	202200	So Jack, having nothing to do with the actual plot, his sole function in this movie,
202200	209200	is to act in contrast to Kong as Anne's love interest, the obviously desirable male alternative.
209200	212200	Oh, this is no place for a girl.
212200	218200	And while this trope of a character never really went away, we still see this guy today in some forms.
218200	223200	He is a huge contrast to Brody's Jack, so much so that he needed to be parodized in the remake.
223200	227200	I guess you don't think much of women on ships, do you?
227200	229200	No, they're a nuisance.
229200	234200	That was the only way to contextualize the way he treated Anne, to look back at the 30s and go,
234200	237200	Oh, you. Oh, backwards you.
237200	239200	Thank God the 70s came along.
239200	241200	Speaking of which...
241200	244200	I'm Jack Prescott. I'm from Princeton, Department of Primate Paleontology.
244200	246200	Department of Prima- You lying hippie!
246200	251200	Jeff Bridges plays Jack Prescott, winner of the Worst Beard Ever award,
251200	257200	and he's an environmentalist, and that, you know, is not easy to do well.
257200	261200	I'm not sure it has ever actually been done well in a movie.
261200	264200	He has a much more concrete reason to even be here.
264200	267200	He stows away because he's a primate paleontologist,
267200	271200	so in that way he has an actual connection to Kong and the plot.
271200	278200	That never really goes anywhere, except in the form of him talking down to every f***ing person.
278200	280200	He's probably telling us we've contaminated their magic.
280200	283200	Wow, buddy, you're just an expert in everything, huh?
283200	286200	He doesn't speak the language of the tribe, for instance,
286200	289200	but he can just intuit what they say with astonishing accuracy,
289200	291200	because he gets it, man.
291200	294200	He wants to make a deal. Six of them for Dwan.
294200	297200	You know, he's not, like, the man. He gets it.
297200	300200	When we took Kong, we kidnapped their god.
300200	303200	A year from now, that'll be an island full of burnt-out drunks.
305200	308200	Wow. F*** you.
308200	311200	See, the movie frames him like he's this Cassandra.
311200	314200	He's the one that's always right, because he gets it, man.
314200	315200	But nobody ever listens to him,
315200	318200	even though he is often a font of the worst ideas imaginable
318200	321200	and the rare instance that somebody does listen to him.
321200	324200	Let him climb to the top of the World Trade Center.
324200	325200	What?
325200	329200	See, because 70s, this movie has a confused relationship to the brand of feminism
329200	331200	that was big in pop culture at the time,
331200	335200	and therefore Dwan has a confused relationship to this chuckle f***.
335200	339200	But I think he's meant less to be appealing to Dwan,
339200	342200	or any woman in the audience, presumably,
342200	347200	and more to be a reflection on how some righteous dudes saw themselves.
347200	348200	You took an advance.
348200	353200	I just donated that in your name to the SPCA fund for sending Kong home.
353200	356200	Because they get it, man. They get it.
356200	359200	Even an environmental rapist like you, even you.
359200	361200	Oh, man, you were the very worst.
361200	364200	It's no wonder the 80s were the way they were if you were the act we had to follow.
364200	365200	Moving on.
365200	367200	How'd you think this would end, Kong?
367200	370200	In a pre-Lord of the Rings version of this movie,
370200	374200	Jack was going to be one of the fighter pilots that shot Kong down.
374200	376200	How's that for symbolism?
376200	380200	Instead, Jack Driscoll is a writer instead of a sailor or an environmentalist.
380200	384200	And I don't think you can really pin that on the fact that it was 2005
384200	385200	and men have to be sensitive now.
385200	389200	Jack Driscoll could have been a variety of characters depending on the filmmaker.
389200	393200	Like, imagine if it had been Michael Bay that remade King Kong,
393200	396200	and Jack could have been like this insecure, objectifying,
396200	399200	possessive, entitled little asshat manchild.
399200	403200	Or McG could have made this movie and he could have been played by
403200	407200	any one of these guys that nobody can tell apart.
407200	409200	It could have been anything.
409200	411200	And so, Peter Jackson being the guy that made it,
411200	413200	sensitive writer is what we got.
413200	416200	The character of Jack has really been split in two.
416200	418200	Adrian Brody plays Jack Driscoll,
418200	421200	and then there's an actor in the movie within the movie
421200	424200	that plays a Jack-like character
424200	427200	who is basically a pastiche of OG Jack Driscoll.
427200	428200	Now they're a nuisance.
429200	431200	Jack is the movie within a movie's screenwriter.
431200	435200	Unlike the previous two films, Anne knows Jack's work
435200	437200	and knows who he is before she meets him.
437200	440200	And she also admires him greatly beforehand.
440200	442200	Some guy, Driscoll.
442200	443200	Driscoll.
443200	444200	But that's kind of it.
444200	446200	She admires his work,
446200	449200	but she doesn't really have that much in common with him as a person.
449200	453200	None of the Annes really have anything in common with any of the Jacks.
453200	456200	So there's this sort of dichotomy between
456200	460200	what I can offer you versus what Kong can offer you.
460200	462200	In effect, Kong is indeed the id.
462200	466200	He is emotion, and sometimes in a sexual way,
466200	469200	and Jack is intellectual stimulation.
470200	472200	Some of the time.
472200	475200	That deep connection that O5 Anne develops with Kong
475200	478200	is because they're just both so damn lonely,
478200	480200	which Jack, he isn't. Not really.
480200	484200	Jack already has a love in his life, and that's his work.
484200	486200	I've been in love with you.
486200	488200	He does take inspiration from Anne for his work,
488200	491200	and she admires his work, but it doesn't really go deeper than that.
491200	493200	I'm writing it for you.
493200	495200	Why would you do that?
495200	498200	So when Jack rescues her from Kong,
498200	500200	she's almost disappointed.
500200	502200	I mean, sure, civilization's nice and all,
502200	504200	but the real emotional connection she develops in the film
504200	506200	is with Kong, not with Jack.
506200	508200	This is a complete 180 from the original,
508200	510200	where it's totally one-sided.
510200	513200	But on the other hand, in that one, she's with Jack because, hey, why not?
513200	515200	But in the end, do they even end up together?
515200	517200	You know, we don't really know.
517200	520200	The Jacks are always playing a sort of contrast
520200	522200	to whatever Anne is feeling about Kong,
522200	527200	be that emotion fear, or arousal, or friendship.
527200	531200	Given that the 76 version is by far the shakiest of the three,
531200	534200	I'm not sure what Jeff Bridges being a smug, obnoxious hippie
534200	536200	brings to the table as a contrast to
536200	540200	Dwan's confused, sexy-times feelings about Kong.
541200	543200	Maybe it's because this pretentious beardo
543200	546200	would cause any vag to calcify into dust,
546200	549200	so of course Kong looks like a sexy alternative.
549200	552200	Lady God preserve thee.
552200	554200	Fuck you!
554200	556200	But I don't think any of these movies are trying to present
556200	559200	some form of idealized masculinity,
559200	561200	because none of the Jacks really get the girl.
561200	564200	OG Jack kinda does, maybe.
564200	566200	He loves Anne because the movie said so.
566200	568200	Jack Prescott isn't with Anne at the end because,
568200	570200	I don't know, celebrity or something.
570200	573200	And Brody Driscoll Jack, it ends with a platonic hug.
573200	576200	He cares, sure, but they kinda seem to be over each other
576200	578200	before the whole New York rampage even takes place.
578200	580200	Like, they weren't even talking.
580200	582200	So what I take from this is that
582200	586200	we aren't changing this character for changing the character's sake.
586200	590200	But where the Anne-slash-Kong-Beauty-and-the-Beast dynamic
590200	592200	is a lot more timeless,
592200	595200	the more normalized I'm-a-man-and-you're-a-woman dynamic
595200	598200	has shifted a lot in the last 80 years.
598200	600200	And so who knows what we will be seeing
600200	602200	in remakes of The Hunger Games
602200	605200	30 or 40 years from now.
605200	607200	What will PETA look like then?
607200	609200	Hmm.
