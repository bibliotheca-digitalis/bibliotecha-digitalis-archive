1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
So, uh, what are you doing with your life?

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,500
Ha ha ha ha!

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:12,000
♪♪♪

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,500
I actually just finished a, uh, finished working as the Dit on a feature, feature-length film.

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,500
And what is that?

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,500
Oh, so Dit is the digital information technologist.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,500
It's basically the person who takes all of the footage that the camera shoots

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,500
and backs it up, creates redundancy, and gets it off to editing.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,500
And where did you learn to do these things, Dano?

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,500
So, by and large, I learned how to do these things at film school.

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,500
Really?

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,500
Yeah, sort of.

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,500
Film school?

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,500
A question that I get asked all the time on Twitter...

15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,500
Me too, yes.

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,500
...is, should I go to film school?

17
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,500
Maybe.

18
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,500
I like saying, should I take this job?

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,500
Or should I go out with this guy?

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,500
Like, I don't know, it depends on...

21
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,500
It depends.

22
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,500
I would say one of the big things that really should factor into whether or not you want to go to film school

23
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,500
is you've got to look at what film school actually means.

24
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,500
So, in my case, so we both went to film school, but we...

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,500
I went to two.

26
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,500
But we had vastly different experiences in regard to that,

27
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:25,500
because there's university-level film school, and then there's also technical colleges.

28
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,500
Like a vocational school.

29
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,500
Yeah.

30
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,500
So, I went to a technical college for film school.

31
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:38,500
So, it was a two-year diploma program, very tech and how-to-get-a-job focused.

32
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,500
So, Selden, Alberta Institute of Technology was where I went.

33
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:50,500
And they were very much focused on, like, okay, getting a job in film in Alberta or Vancouver or Saskatchewan.

34
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,500
What was the cost for your education?

35
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,500
About $2,000 to $2,500 per semester.

36
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,500
So, four semesters.

37
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,500
So, a little under $10,000 for tuition.

38
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,500
USC does not offer aid for their grad students, at least in the first year.

39
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,500
Or at least they didn't in 2009. Maybe that's changed.

40
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,500
It was about $1,400 per credit hour.

41
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,500
There was six to ten credit hours per semester.

42
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,500
I completed 40 credit hours.

43
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
Then there was, like, the fees and the insurance.

44
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,500
Yeah, and you're going to have all of the other stuff.

45
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,500
So, that's just your cost for the course registrations.

46
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Then there was the cost of the films itself, which, of course, you have to pay for.

47
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:52,500
I had finished two and a half years of the coursework, and I had $60,000 in debt.

48
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,500
And I had paid in another $45,000-ish.

49
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,500
I was one of the lucky ones.

50
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,500
I knew people who left with $200,000-plus in debt.

51
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,500
I mean, and on top of that, particularly with the way that debt accumulates,

52
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,500
that you're going to be paying off interest before you're even touching the principal.

53
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Yes, I left with $60,000.

54
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:20,500
I have paid into it about $19,000.

55
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,500
I now have $69,000.

56
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Yeah.

57
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
My undergrad was at NYU.

58
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,500
I don't know if I would call that a film school because it was film studies,

59
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,500
which is the way I described it back then was it's like an English degree,

60
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,500
only instead of studying books, you study movies.

61
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,500
It's much more about film history, criticism, academia, theory.

62
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,500
I decided to go into production, which is completely different.

63
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:54,500
The only time when I was an undergrad, the production people and the studies people's paths crossed

64
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
was in this intro course.

65
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
The production people were like,

66
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,500
why do we need to know interpretive stuff?

67
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,500
This is stupid.

68
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Let's just go out and run around with a camera.

69
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
It's just sort of like, ugh.

70
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
Oh, the things I could tell them.

71
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,500
The problems when tech people don't understand the interpretive

72
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,500
and just create stuff and you're like,

73
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,500
why did people get that meaning from it?

74
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,500
I also feel like for that reason,

75
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,500
there's a massive disparity between grad and undergrad,

76
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,500
and we can talk about that.

77
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,500
I decided very snootily.

78
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,500
I was like, well, I'm not going to go to film school if I can't go to the very best one.

79
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
There's three very best ones.

80
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,500
NYU, AFI, and USC.

81
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,500
UCLA would say they're in there.

82
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,500
They're not.

83
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,500
I applied to two.

84
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
I got into one, and that was USC.

85
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
I went to AFI and UCLA.

86
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,500
I didn't bother applying to those.

87
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,500
It was also very focused on industry stuff and getting a job,

88
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,500
but I think the only way to describe it is like a conservatory.

89
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,500
It was like a three-year boot camp, and there is nothing else.

90
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,500
There are no other classes that you take except for the business classes.

91
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,500
It's completely intensive and also really intense.

92
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,500
I think the main difference between USC and other film schools

93
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,500
is no one really had a film background or not a very substantive one.

94
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,500
They didn't want people that did film in undergrad.

95
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,500
SAIT was just kind of general.

96
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,500
A lot of people were coming into it straight out of high school.

97
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
Some people were switching careers.

98
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,500
Of course, it's a lot more local because it is smaller,

99
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,500
especially in terms of total industry output.

100
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Calgary is a film city, but we're like a fifth-tier film city,

101
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
if we're honest about it.

102
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,500
A big consideration in whether or not to go to film school

103
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,500
is what school you're going to and how much is it going to cost you

104
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,500
and what do you intend to get out of it.

105
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
Whenever people say, should I go to film school,

106
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,500
I feel like there is a massive, massive divide

107
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
between do you want to go to a top film school

108
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,500
and do you want to go to a vocational school.

109
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:11,500
While, for instance, the debt is insane,

110
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,500
I went to school with a lot of people

111
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,500
who are already working in the industry

112
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,500
in a way that I don't think you see in other film schools.

113
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,500
I went to school with a guy who directed Creed

114
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
and is directing Black Panther.

115
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
I worked on his student films.

116
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,500
The editor for Black Panther was the editor for my thesis.

117
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:39,500
I also went to school with Mira Minon, who did Equity recently.

118
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,500
These are just directors and big-name people.

119
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,500
I knew people who worked on the Mindy Project.

120
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,500
The thing about USC is if you want to work on big-name things

121
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,500
and really be a star.

122
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Yeah, if you want to work on big-name things above the line.

123
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,500
I've got tons of friends who have worked on big-name things.

124
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,500
I've got tons of friends who have worked on big-name things,

125
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,500
tons of friends who worked on The Revenant,

126
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,500
who worked on Intergalactic.

127
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Someone's got to go door-to-door with checks being like,

128
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,500
hey, business, we're going to be shooting here.

129
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
Here's your money for the day in case your business

130
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
ends up in the background of our movie.

131
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,500
Whenever you have your eye to a top film school,

132
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,500
it's basically just a huge leg up.

133
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
It's not a guarantee for anything.

134
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,500
There are people that didn't go to film school

135
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,500
that are also huge stars.

136
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Tarantino didn't, right?

137
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,500
No.

138
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,500
Then there are all the other ones.

139
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Bryan Singer went to USC.

140
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,500
Robert Zemeckis, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg didn't,

141
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
but he's got an office there.

142
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
I don't know.

143
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,500
I think the other thing is, at least in my experience,

144
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,500
I know this feels like an apologia for horrible student debt

145
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,500
and yeah, let's all go to the University of Spoiled Children.

146
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:58,500
I honestly do feel like for the level of immersion I got

147
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,500
in the amount of time that I did,

148
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,500
I feel like their approach where you're not allowed

149
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,500
to take a specialized anything until you do a year

150
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
where you specialize in everything,

151
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,500
their rationale being you can't be a good editor

152
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
unless you know what it is to be a director or a cinematographer,

153
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,500
so even if you don't like it, you have to do it.

154
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,500
However, I feel like my experience is limited to the grad program

155
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,500
and also all the successful people came out of the grad program.

156
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,500
I don't know how I feel about undergrad liberal arts

157
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,500
film production programs.

158
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Film production programs.

159
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,500
Yeah.

160
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Film studies, I'm a huge fan.

161
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:45,500
I believe in media literacy quite strongly,

162
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,500
so I think any kind of literary course,

163
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,500
whether it's film studies or literature classics, whatnot,

164
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,500
I think those are very flexible in teaching you

165
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,500
how to navigate information.

166
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,500
Yeah, and I feel like people who call shit like that useless degrees

167
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,500
don't know how degrees work or what degrees do,

168
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:15,500
so I can point to myself as someone who does directly use their degree

169
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,500
in their chosen field of study,

170
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,500
but I don't think that necessarily has anything to do with anything.

171
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,500
That also said, like I said, everyone in my master's program

172
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,500
came out of some form of liberal art,

173
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,500
or maybe they were in their 30s and they'd worked for a while,

174
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,500
or they came out of journalism.

175
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,500
They came out of all walks of life, and that was sort of the intent,

176
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,500
and no one had gone for undergrad.

177
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,500
I was a TA for the undergrads for a couple semesters,

178
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,500
and the disparity in quality that came out of the grad program

179
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,500
and the undergrad program was so vast,

180
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,500
and the grads weren't that much older than the undergrads.

181
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,500
I think just from what I've seen around,

182
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:03,500
I think undergrad film production programs are...

183
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500
I don't want to say they're the worst value

184
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,500
because the worst value would be the for-profit mills.

185
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,500
Yes, the full sales in the University of Phoenix.

186
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,500
Yeah, you do need some discretion.

187
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,500
There are a lot of mills out there

188
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,500
that won't actually improve your ability to get in.

189
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,500
You do need to look at the school's reputation.

190
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:31,500
So university film production is probably the second worst deal.

191
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,500
If you're looking at grad level,

192
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,500
you're probably better off doing another undergrad in another topic

193
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,500
and then taking that into grad level production.

194
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Or if you don't want to go on to grad level, look at a vocational school

195
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,500
because it'll cost you a fraction and you'll be done in half the time.

196
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,500
I think whenever people ask, should I go to film school,

197
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,500
if they wanted to go to a vocational school, they would.

198
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
I think there is a sort of prestige that's attached to it.

199
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,500
That said, even schools like NYU and USC,

200
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,500
again, even for undergrad, the top ones,

201
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,500
you're not even allowed to touch a camera until you're a junior.

202
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,500
Yeah, and that's...

203
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,500
And people get so pissy about you have to go read Dostoyevsky

204
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,500
and you have to take your math class and your physics requirement.

205
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
But that's a liberal arts degree.

206
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,500
That's part of it.

207
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,500
And the problem with film production is it doesn't really mesh with that

208
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,500
in a way that, say, an English or any kind of writing,

209
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,500
creative writing, film studies, would.

210
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,500
And I think the undergrads do kind of get the short end of the stick

211
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,500
in terms of actual experience.

212
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,500
That is the important question.

213
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
Would you say that you're able to make a living

214
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,500
purely off of what you went to school for?

215
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,500
With the skills I went to school for, yes.

216
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,500
There are some caveats in that

217
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,500
that would come down to the nitty-gritty of the coursework

218
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,500
of, like, I don't think they did quite enough

219
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,500
to cover things like the reality of corporate video or freelancing.

220
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
God, no.

221
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,500
Hey, guys, if you're watching this,

222
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,500
just a reminder, you need to put in

223
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,500
how to charge people as a freelancer into that course material.

224
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,500
It's a bit of feedback that I know they get every single year.

225
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,500
When you go into any film school, it could be the one you went to

226
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,500
or SVA or USC, NYU,

227
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:34,500
there is a certain level of expectation that people have.

228
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,500
Not all of it is realistic.

229
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,500
And I think that is also the difference between

230
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,500
going into film production when you're older,

231
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
have a little more life experience,

232
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
because in my grad school experience,

233
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:52,500
the younger ones tended to be a little more big-headed and unrealistic.

234
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
And they learned their lesson eventually.

235
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,500
A little more pie in the sky.

236
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
Yeah, they learned their lesson eventually.

237
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,500
There was definitely, like, I think you would see this more

238
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,500
at a school like USC where everyone expects to end up like George Lucas

239
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
and have, like, this huge name.

240
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,500
If you're going to school in Calgary,

241
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,500
if you're going to film school in Calgary

242
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,500
and you're not looking to move immediately afterwards,

243
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,500
then you're probably going to have a little bit more grounded expectation

244
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
that it's like, hey, if I'm going into production,

245
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,500
I'm probably going to start off as a grip or a lamp-bob.

246
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,500
If I'm coming out of the editing stream,

247
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,500
it's like, I'm going to be an assistant editor or a compiler

248
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,500
or something like that.

249
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,500
I'm going to be a dit.

250
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,500
I'm not going to be, you know, I'm not going to be a DP on a feature.

251
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,500
Because that's another thing is people getting big-headed at the top schools.

252
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,500
It's like, again, people be like,

253
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,500
well, I'm going to be a director the second I graduate.

254
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
Ryan Coogler did.

255
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,500
He directed Fruitvale Station.

256
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
I think he hadn't even graduated yet.

257
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,500
And then he directed Creed two years later.

258
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
So, yeah, it does happen.

259
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,500
You know, so I think tempering kind of that expectation

260
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,500
both in terms of like, what are you going to get out of it?

261
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,500
Like, are you aiming to be technical?

262
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,500
Do you just want to work in movies?

263
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Or do you want to be a YouTuber?

264
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,500
And so if you've got, you know, both good aspirational

265
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,500
and realistic expectations that vary wildly

266
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
depending on like where you are

267
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,500
and where you're willing to physically move.

268
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,500
And that's a huge thing

269
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,500
because like Ryan Coogler's example

270
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,500
couldn't have happened outside of California.

271
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,500
No.

272
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,500
No.

273
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,500
And also like with the right connections,

274
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
which I believe in his case was Forrest Whitaker.

275
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,500
Yeah.

276
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,500
You know, he crossed paths with Forrest Whitaker at the right time,

277
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:47,500
which he would not have done if he had not gone to the school he went to when he did.

278
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Like, I mean, there's a lot you can do to stack the odds,

279
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,500
but there's also still kind of a lot of luck that comes into it.

280
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,500
Yeah.

281
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,500
And, you know, right place, right time.

282
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,500
And if you're kind of, if you can't be in that right place,

283
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:07,500
like if you do want to stay in a fifth tier like place,

284
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,500
like if you want to stay in Georgia, if you want to stay in Kansas,

285
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,500
if you want to stay in Montana or Utah or Alberta.

286
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,500
I don't know if I'd call Georgia a fifth tier though.

287
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,500
I think Georgia's up to, yeah, I think Georgia's solidly two.

288
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Georgia's solidly at two at this point.

289
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
They've got CNN, they've got like all the Marvel movies.

290
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,500
Yeah, Georgia's doing alright.

291
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,500
Georgia's doing good.

292
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,500
If you're in kind of one of the smaller markets, you know,

293
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,500
and depending on kind of how small that market is, like, you know,

294
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,500
temper your expectations to it.

295
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Do you want to work your way up to bigger and bigger markets?

296
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:41,500
Like, you know, if you're in Canada, it's like if you're in Calgary,

297
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,500
are you willing to stick it out long term and keep working on the government grants,

298
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,500
keep working on the stuff until you can get, you know,

299
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:53,500
basically break into that small circle of Canadian filmmakers who get money,

300
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,500
or are you going to sort of work your way like, all right, I'm in Calgary,

301
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,500
I'm going to move on over to Vancouver, and then I'm going to move to Toronto,

302
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
and then I'm going to move to New York, and then I'm going to move to California?

303
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,500
Yeah.

304
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:10,500
Expecting to know what you want right out of the gate before you make that kind of decision,

305
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,500
it's not going to happen.

306
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,500
I think some people do,

307
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,500
but probably because they've already got a taste of it, like they got a taste of it in high school.

308
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
Yeah, not the people who are thinking, should I go to film school?

309
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Yeah.

310
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,500
And that is another thing to talk about.

311
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
Like, whenever you want to talk about, like, what's the big five,

312
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:35,500
it's USC, NYU, AFI, the one that doesn't matter, and I think Florida State.

313
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
Is that right?

314
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,500
That's the three, like, who cares?

315
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,500
It's true.

316
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,500
Well, pass the four, I guess, because you're going to want to include UC.

317
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,500
No, it doesn't matter.

318
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
It doesn't matter, but, I mean...

319
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
We don't say the name of our archenemy.

320
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
Yeah.

321
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
They're not my archenemy.

322
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:00,500
Okay, so, like, AFI recently took the crown from USC as the top film school,

323
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:06,500
and the reason I didn't even bother applying to AFI is AFI does assume some,

324
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:13,500
actually not insubstantial amount of experience in your field of choice.

325
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:19,500
You have to apply to a track, like directing, cinematography, editing, writing,

326
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,500
and you cannot stray out of that track.

327
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,500
AFI's program is a lot shorter for that reason.

328
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,500
I think it's only a year, year and a half,

329
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:36,500
and it doesn't really offer you much outside of whatever your specialized vocation is.

330
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,500
A lot of the more artistic sorts come from AFI.

331
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,500
You're David Lynch, you're Darren Aronofsky,

332
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,500
and they want to cultivate your auteurness.

333
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:54,500
Yeah, AFI's kind of an up-your-game sort of destination.

334
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Yeah.

335
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,500
So, and that obviously only applies to grad.

336
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,500
Columbia's grad program, also, Columbia doesn't bother having an undergrad program,

337
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,500
but their grad program's definitely on the ups and has some, you know, big-name alumni,

338
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,500
like Katherine Bigelow.

339
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
For that reason, I assume they're more commercial.

340
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
I don't know, I didn't go there.

341
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,500
NYU is a lot more indie and artistic.

342
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:23,500
You have, from there, alumni like Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Spike Lee,

343
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,500
Brett Ratner,

344
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,500
Michael, oh, Wesleyan, Michael Bay, Joss Whedon,

345
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,500
and one of my NYU professors actually all went to Wesleyan at the same time,

346
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,500
for undergrad, no less.

347
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,500
See, undergrad can do you good.

348
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:46,500
Canada would be University of Toronto, McGill, and SAIT.

349
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,500
There's a lot of other, like, decent programs and specialized programs

350
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,500
scattered around the post-production industries,

351
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:00,500
but those would be the three big that are either producing working directors,

352
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,500
which would be McGill and U of T,

353
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:08,500
or technicians, which would be SAIT and U of T.

354
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Strangely, most of the people in Vancouver just sort of learn on the job.

355
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
I think that's what most people do.

356
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,500
Because whenever people tell you that you don't need a degree

357
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,500
or you don't need to go to school in order to work in film,

358
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,500
they're right. They're absolutely right.

359
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,500
But here's the thing, it's so much harder.

360
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:34,500
It's like just, I mean, I can't, I guess the same could apply for engineering

361
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,500
or any other thing that requires actual skills and knowledge.

362
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,500
It is really difficult to just dive into something

363
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,500
and just work your way up from, like, a PA.

364
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,500
It's really easy to flame out.

365
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,500
Yes.

366
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,500
So one of the great things that film school gives you,

367
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:57,500
like even if you go to a vocational school or a technical college for it,

368
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,500
is that it gives you a better sense of the whole,

369
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,500
so that rather than like, hey, I want to work in movies,

370
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,500
and it's like, okay, so you took your set etiquette and protocol course

371
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,500
and now you're a PA blocking off roads,

372
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,500
and you're going to be doing that for the next two, three years.

373
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
Because you don't have a better sense of the whole,

374
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,500
you're not going to be able to think strategically about your job,

375
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,500
which is like, okay, I'm a PA, I'm doing roads,

376
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,500
I want to get to know the people over in locations,

377
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,500
I want to get to know the people over in set,

378
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,500
and I either want to become a specialized PA

379
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,500
or I want to get into the office.

380
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Because even though an office PA is still just a PA,

381
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,500
they're working with the director, they're working with the first AD,

382
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500
they're working with the production coordinator,

383
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,500
they're working with the production manager,

384
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,500
they're seeing the producer, they're getting to know names and faces.

385
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,500
If you can't think strategically about it,

386
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,500
then you're going to be a locations PA forever,

387
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,500
and you're just going to be locking off roads for three years

388
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,500
until you're like, screw this, I'm going to go get a normal job

389
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,500
that actually pays the same and doesn't require me

390
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,500
to work 16-hour days for three weeks in a row.

391
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,500
The way you think film sets work,

392
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,500
if you've never worked on one or never been taught how they work,

393
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,500
you're wrong.

394
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
Holy God, are you wrong.

395
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,500
I'm not going to name any names here,

396
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,500
but I've been on some sets

397
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,500
by people who have never been on a real set

398
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,500
that are just a total shit show,

399
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,500
and you need to know basic things.

400
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,500
How were craft services on those sets?

401
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,500
I think it's also really dangerous

402
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,500
for the entry-level person to just fall in

403
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,500
with a bunch of asshats that are going to exploit you

404
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,500
and teach you nothing.

405
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,500
Oh, there's another dimension to it,

406
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,500
is that there are a ton,

407
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,500
even still to this day,

408
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,500
a metric ton of exploitative assholes out there

409
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,500
who are looking for people who want to be in movies

410
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,500
and they will overwork them, underpay them,

411
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,500
or not pay them at all, and put them at risk.

412
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,500
If you're looking to work on a film set, do not work for free.

413
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Don't do it. Even if they're your friends.

414
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,500
If they're your best friend, then maybe, but don't work for free.

415
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,500
You don't have to work for free.

416
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,500
You should be making at least $100 a day as an entry-level person, probably more.

417
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,500
Here's one of the biggest things that you're going to get from film school

418
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,500
that you're not necessarily going to have enough of,

419
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,500
because you can never have enough of,

420
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,500
but that you're really not going to have enough of

421
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,500
if you just dive right into it, and that's safety training.

422
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,500
Because film sets are frickin' dangerous.

423
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,500
You have a lot of people moving around,

424
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,500
you have a lot of heavy equipment, you have a lot of specialized equipment.

425
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,500
If it's anything approaching a big set,

426
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,500
then you're talking about really, really high voltages.

427
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,500
There are a ton of safety concerns,

428
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,500
and when you run into these non-union shoots

429
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,500
where it's just some fly-by-night company...

430
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,500
Someone literally, yeah, that girl in Georgia...

431
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,500
Yeah, which is exactly where it's going.

432
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,500
Literally died.

433
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,500
This fly-by-night production company's like,

434
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,500
hey, we're going to make this movie,

435
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,500
and so they got a whole bunch of teenagers and 20-somethings

436
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,500
who wanted to be in movies, and they had a couple trained people,

437
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,500
and Sarah was one of them, and she was first camera assistant,

438
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,500
and they had this setup where they were doing this dream sequence

439
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,500
out on the train tracks,

440
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,500
and the production coordinator had called the rail office

441
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,500
to try and book the track,

442
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,500
and they had been rejected

443
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,500
because there was a train going through,

444
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,500
like there was a shipment going through at that time,

445
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,500
and the producer, who was also the director,

446
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,500
was like, well, screw it.

447
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,500
We're going to be maverick filmmakers.

448
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,500
We're just going to go rogue

449
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,500
and do it anyway,

450
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,500
and a woman lost her life.

451
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,500
There are other issues to consider,

452
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,500
like race and gender issues and discriminations,

453
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,500
which we're not going to get into now.

454
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,500
That's, I think, maybe a topic for another day.

455
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,500
It's difficult to say is it worth it,

456
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,500
because it depends on what you want,

457
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,500
and it's such a wide spectrum of questions to ask,

458
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,500
whether you want to get into a vocational school

459
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,500
so you can learn a trade and then just make a living,

460
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,500
or if you want to be a big-name film person

461
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,500
and go to all the fun film festivals every year

462
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,500
or be a professor or something.

463
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,500
I think a lot of it really does come down to cost,

464
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,500
because whenever I get asked the question,

465
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,500
is it worth it?

466
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,500
In my case, I kind of go back and forth

467
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,500
because it all comes down to that debt,

468
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,500
because if I didn't go into debt,

469
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,500
or if I'd even gone into less debt,

470
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,500
like even half the debt I'm in now,

471
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,500
I would say, yeah, it was totally worth it,

472
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,500
but to be $10,000 more in debt now

473
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,500
except for the fact that the school

474
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,500
doesn't really offer aid to grad students

475
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,500
because it's the top film school,

476
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,500
and if you don't want to pay it,

477
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,500
there's 200 people in line behind you

478
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,500
that will kill to be in your place.

479
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,500
That's part of the real challenge with the big ones,

480
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,500
is it's almost like gambling.

481
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,500
Yeah, you are kind of getting potential access

482
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,500
to a spotlight career really quickly,

483
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,500
but if you're not the lucky one...

484
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,500
I mean, even if you are the lucky one,

485
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,500
it's a thing.

486
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,500
The only exception I know is Ryan Coogler.

487
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,500
Even the other people I know that are super doing really well

488
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,500
are still in a lot of debt.

489
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,500
If you are the one lucky one,

490
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,500
then it's still going to take a while to pay that down.

491
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,500
It's true of all grad schools.

492
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,500
If you're $60,000, $200,000 in debt,

493
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,500
that will just follow you around

494
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,500
and it will affect your life decisions.

495
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,500
One important thing, if you pay your minimum payments

496
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,500
every year for 25 years, if you have federal loans,

497
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,500
they will get forgiven at the end of that period.

498
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,500
That is true.

499
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,500
On the flip side, I can think of very few downsides

500
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,500
to taking the vocational route.

501
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,500
Yes, it's not going to...

502
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,500
You have a much lower chance of being a star,

503
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,500
but you can make a living

504
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,500
working in movies or working in related fields.

505
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,500
It's not the easiest life,

506
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,500
it's not the easiest living,

507
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,500
there is a lot of uncertainty.

508
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,500
But at the same time,

509
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,500
it's doable.

510
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,500
It's totally doable.

511
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,500
The pay-in, particularly for a vocational school,

512
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,500
if it's a state school or a federally funded school...

513
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,500
Or even if you get financial aid,

514
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,500
which I hear happens at the school that shall not be named.

515
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,500
If it's two years

516
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,500
and it's only going to cost you $10,000 in tuition,

517
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,500
then...

518
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,500
Totally worth it.

519
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,500
If you're young and you don't have any debt,

520
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,500
$10,000 might seem like a lot.

521
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,500
It's amazing the difference between $10,000 and $60,000.

522
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,500
I had paid for most of it,

523
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,500
so by the time I was done,

524
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,500
I was in debt and I got a film-related job

525
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,500
right out of school,

526
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,500
and I was debt-free by Christmas.

527
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,500
I feel like I could be debt-free

528
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,500
solely based on my freelance income,

529
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,500
YouTube income, and Patreon income.

530
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,500
I could be debt-free...

531
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,500
2030.

532
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,500
14 years?

533
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,500
What is the amount of student debt interest

534
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,500
you can write off every year?

535
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,500
It is $2,500.

536
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,500
I accrue about $4,000.

537
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,500
America!

538
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,500
I think that's a good place to end,

539
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,500
and then I'm going to jump on a plane

540
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,500
and go back to the land of socialized medicine

541
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,500
and mitigated student debt.

542
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,500
I'm very wealthy.
