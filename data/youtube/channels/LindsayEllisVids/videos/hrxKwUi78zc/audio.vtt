00:00.000 --> 00:03.500
So, uh, what are you doing with your life?

00:03.500 --> 00:05.500
Ha ha ha ha!

00:05.500 --> 00:12.000
♪♪♪

00:12.000 --> 00:18.500
I actually just finished a, uh, finished working as the Dit on a feature, feature-length film.

00:18.500 --> 00:19.500
And what is that?

00:19.500 --> 00:23.500
Oh, so Dit is the digital information technologist.

00:23.500 --> 00:28.500
It's basically the person who takes all of the footage that the camera shoots

00:28.500 --> 00:33.500
and backs it up, creates redundancy, and gets it off to editing.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.500
And where did you learn to do these things, Dano?

00:36.500 --> 00:40.500
So, by and large, I learned how to do these things at film school.

00:40.500 --> 00:41.500
Really?

00:41.500 --> 00:42.500
Yeah, sort of.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.500
Film school?

00:43.500 --> 00:45.500
A question that I get asked all the time on Twitter...

00:45.500 --> 00:46.500
Me too, yes.

00:46.500 --> 00:49.500
...is, should I go to film school?

00:51.500 --> 00:53.500
Maybe.

00:53.500 --> 00:56.500
I like saying, should I take this job?

00:56.500 --> 00:58.500
Or should I go out with this guy?

00:58.500 --> 01:00.500
Like, I don't know, it depends on...

01:00.500 --> 01:01.500
It depends.

01:01.500 --> 01:05.500
I would say one of the big things that really should factor into whether or not you want to go to film school

01:05.500 --> 01:08.500
is you've got to look at what film school actually means.

01:08.500 --> 01:13.500
So, in my case, so we both went to film school, but we...

01:13.500 --> 01:14.500
I went to two.

01:14.500 --> 01:18.500
But we had vastly different experiences in regard to that,

01:18.500 --> 01:25.500
because there's university-level film school, and then there's also technical colleges.

01:25.500 --> 01:26.500
Like a vocational school.

01:26.500 --> 01:27.500
Yeah.

01:27.500 --> 01:30.500
So, I went to a technical college for film school.

01:30.500 --> 01:38.500
So, it was a two-year diploma program, very tech and how-to-get-a-job focused.

01:38.500 --> 01:42.500
So, Selden, Alberta Institute of Technology was where I went.

01:42.500 --> 01:50.500
And they were very much focused on, like, okay, getting a job in film in Alberta or Vancouver or Saskatchewan.

01:50.500 --> 01:53.500
What was the cost for your education?

01:53.500 --> 01:58.500
About $2,000 to $2,500 per semester.

01:58.500 --> 01:59.500
So, four semesters.

01:59.500 --> 02:02.500
So, a little under $10,000 for tuition.

02:05.500 --> 02:11.500
USC does not offer aid for their grad students, at least in the first year.

02:12.500 --> 02:15.500
Or at least they didn't in 2009. Maybe that's changed.

02:15.500 --> 02:20.500
It was about $1,400 per credit hour.

02:22.500 --> 02:28.500
There was six to ten credit hours per semester.

02:28.500 --> 02:31.500
I completed 40 credit hours.

02:31.500 --> 02:33.500
Then there was, like, the fees and the insurance.

02:33.500 --> 02:36.500
Yeah, and you're going to have all of the other stuff.

02:36.500 --> 02:39.500
So, that's just your cost for the course registrations.

02:39.500 --> 02:44.500
Then there was the cost of the films itself, which, of course, you have to pay for.

02:44.500 --> 02:52.500
I had finished two and a half years of the coursework, and I had $60,000 in debt.

02:52.500 --> 02:57.500
And I had paid in another $45,000-ish.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.500
I was one of the lucky ones.

02:59.500 --> 03:03.500
I knew people who left with $200,000-plus in debt.

03:03.500 --> 03:08.500
I mean, and on top of that, particularly with the way that debt accumulates,

03:08.500 --> 03:12.500
that you're going to be paying off interest before you're even touching the principal.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.500
Yes, I left with $60,000.

03:14.500 --> 03:20.500
I have paid into it about $19,000.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.500
I now have $69,000.

03:26.500 --> 03:27.500
Yeah.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.500
My undergrad was at NYU.

03:30.500 --> 03:33.500
I don't know if I would call that a film school because it was film studies,

03:33.500 --> 03:37.500
which is the way I described it back then was it's like an English degree,

03:37.500 --> 03:39.500
only instead of studying books, you study movies.

03:39.500 --> 03:43.500
It's much more about film history, criticism, academia, theory.

03:43.500 --> 03:48.500
I decided to go into production, which is completely different.

03:48.500 --> 03:54.500
The only time when I was an undergrad, the production people and the studies people's paths crossed

03:54.500 --> 03:56.500
was in this intro course.

03:57.500 --> 03:59.500
The production people were like,

03:59.500 --> 04:03.500
why do we need to know interpretive stuff?

04:03.500 --> 04:04.500
This is stupid.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.500
Let's just go out and run around with a camera.

04:06.500 --> 04:08.500
It's just sort of like, ugh.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.500
Oh, the things I could tell them.

04:10.500 --> 04:14.500
The problems when tech people don't understand the interpretive

04:14.500 --> 04:16.500
and just create stuff and you're like,

04:16.500 --> 04:19.500
why did people get that meaning from it?

04:19.500 --> 04:20.500
I also feel like for that reason,

04:20.500 --> 04:23.500
there's a massive disparity between grad and undergrad,

04:23.500 --> 04:24.500
and we can talk about that.

04:24.500 --> 04:26.500
I decided very snootily.

04:26.500 --> 04:30.500
I was like, well, I'm not going to go to film school if I can't go to the very best one.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.500
There's three very best ones.

04:33.500 --> 04:36.500
NYU, AFI, and USC.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.500
UCLA would say they're in there.

04:38.500 --> 04:39.500
They're not.

04:41.500 --> 04:42.500
I applied to two.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.500
I got into one, and that was USC.

04:45.500 --> 04:47.500
I went to AFI and UCLA.

04:47.500 --> 04:48.500
I didn't bother applying to those.

04:48.500 --> 04:52.500
It was also very focused on industry stuff and getting a job,

04:52.500 --> 04:56.500
but I think the only way to describe it is like a conservatory.

04:56.500 --> 05:01.500
It was like a three-year boot camp, and there is nothing else.

05:01.500 --> 05:05.500
There are no other classes that you take except for the business classes.

05:05.500 --> 05:09.500
It's completely intensive and also really intense.

05:09.500 --> 05:12.500
I think the main difference between USC and other film schools

05:12.500 --> 05:17.500
is no one really had a film background or not a very substantive one.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.500
They didn't want people that did film in undergrad.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.500
SAIT was just kind of general.

05:21.500 --> 05:25.500
A lot of people were coming into it straight out of high school.

05:25.500 --> 05:27.500
Some people were switching careers.

05:27.500 --> 05:31.500
Of course, it's a lot more local because it is smaller,

05:31.500 --> 05:35.500
especially in terms of total industry output.

05:35.500 --> 05:41.500
Calgary is a film city, but we're like a fifth-tier film city,

05:41.500 --> 05:43.500
if we're honest about it.

05:43.500 --> 05:47.500
A big consideration in whether or not to go to film school

05:47.500 --> 05:52.500
is what school you're going to and how much is it going to cost you

05:52.500 --> 05:55.500
and what do you intend to get out of it.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.500
Whenever people say, should I go to film school,

05:57.500 --> 06:00.500
I feel like there is a massive, massive divide

06:00.500 --> 06:02.500
between do you want to go to a top film school

06:02.500 --> 06:05.500
and do you want to go to a vocational school.

06:05.500 --> 06:11.500
While, for instance, the debt is insane,

06:11.500 --> 06:14.500
I went to school with a lot of people

06:14.500 --> 06:17.500
who are already working in the industry

06:17.500 --> 06:20.500
in a way that I don't think you see in other film schools.

06:20.500 --> 06:24.500
I went to school with a guy who directed Creed

06:24.500 --> 06:26.500
and is directing Black Panther.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.500
I worked on his student films.

06:28.500 --> 06:33.500
The editor for Black Panther was the editor for my thesis.

06:33.500 --> 06:39.500
I also went to school with Mira Minon, who did Equity recently.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.500
These are just directors and big-name people.

06:42.500 --> 06:45.500
I knew people who worked on the Mindy Project.

06:45.500 --> 06:50.500
The thing about USC is if you want to work on big-name things

06:50.500 --> 06:53.500
and really be a star.

06:53.500 --> 06:57.500
Yeah, if you want to work on big-name things above the line.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.500
I've got tons of friends who have worked on big-name things.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.500
I've got tons of friends who have worked on big-name things,

07:02.500 --> 07:05.500
tons of friends who worked on The Revenant,

07:05.500 --> 07:07.500
who worked on Intergalactic.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.500
Someone's got to go door-to-door with checks being like,

07:09.500 --> 07:12.500
hey, business, we're going to be shooting here.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.500
Here's your money for the day in case your business

07:14.500 --> 07:16.500
ends up in the background of our movie.

07:16.500 --> 07:19.500
Whenever you have your eye to a top film school,

07:19.500 --> 07:22.500
it's basically just a huge leg up.

07:22.500 --> 07:24.500
It's not a guarantee for anything.

07:24.500 --> 07:27.500
There are people that didn't go to film school

07:27.500 --> 07:29.500
that are also huge stars.

07:29.500 --> 07:30.500
Tarantino didn't, right?

07:30.500 --> 07:31.500
No.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.500
Then there are all the other ones.

07:33.500 --> 07:35.500
Bryan Singer went to USC.

07:35.500 --> 07:38.500
Robert Zemeckis, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg didn't,

07:38.500 --> 07:40.500
but he's got an office there.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.500
I don't know.

07:42.500 --> 07:45.500
I think the other thing is, at least in my experience,

07:45.500 --> 07:49.500
I know this feels like an apologia for horrible student debt

07:49.500 --> 07:52.500
and yeah, let's all go to the University of Spoiled Children.

07:52.500 --> 07:58.500
I honestly do feel like for the level of immersion I got

07:58.500 --> 08:00.500
in the amount of time that I did,

08:00.500 --> 08:03.500
I feel like their approach where you're not allowed

08:03.500 --> 08:06.500
to take a specialized anything until you do a year

08:06.500 --> 08:08.500
where you specialize in everything,

08:08.500 --> 08:11.500
their rationale being you can't be a good editor

08:11.500 --> 08:13.500
unless you know what it is to be a director or a cinematographer,

08:13.500 --> 08:16.500
so even if you don't like it, you have to do it.

08:16.500 --> 08:21.500
However, I feel like my experience is limited to the grad program

08:21.500 --> 08:25.500
and also all the successful people came out of the grad program.

08:25.500 --> 08:29.500
I don't know how I feel about undergrad liberal arts

08:29.500 --> 08:32.500
film production programs.

08:32.500 --> 08:33.500
Film production programs.

08:33.500 --> 08:34.500
Yeah.

08:34.500 --> 08:39.500
Film studies, I'm a huge fan.

08:39.500 --> 08:45.500
I believe in media literacy quite strongly,

08:45.500 --> 08:48.500
so I think any kind of literary course,

08:48.500 --> 08:52.500
whether it's film studies or literature classics, whatnot,

08:52.500 --> 08:56.500
I think those are very flexible in teaching you

08:56.500 --> 08:59.500
how to navigate information.

08:59.500 --> 09:04.500
Yeah, and I feel like people who call shit like that useless degrees

09:04.500 --> 09:09.500
don't know how degrees work or what degrees do,

09:09.500 --> 09:15.500
so I can point to myself as someone who does directly use their degree

09:15.500 --> 09:18.500
in their chosen field of study,

09:18.500 --> 09:22.500
but I don't think that necessarily has anything to do with anything.

09:22.500 --> 09:26.500
That also said, like I said, everyone in my master's program

09:26.500 --> 09:29.500
came out of some form of liberal art,

09:29.500 --> 09:32.500
or maybe they were in their 30s and they'd worked for a while,

09:32.500 --> 09:34.500
or they came out of journalism.

09:34.500 --> 09:38.500
They came out of all walks of life, and that was sort of the intent,

09:38.500 --> 09:41.500
and no one had gone for undergrad.

09:41.500 --> 09:44.500
I was a TA for the undergrads for a couple semesters,

09:44.500 --> 09:48.500
and the disparity in quality that came out of the grad program

09:48.500 --> 09:50.500
and the undergrad program was so vast,

09:50.500 --> 09:53.500
and the grads weren't that much older than the undergrads.

09:53.500 --> 09:56.500
I think just from what I've seen around,

09:56.500 --> 10:03.500
I think undergrad film production programs are...

10:03.500 --> 10:05.500
I don't want to say they're the worst value

10:05.500 --> 10:09.500
because the worst value would be the for-profit mills.

10:09.500 --> 10:12.500
Yes, the full sales in the University of Phoenix.

10:12.500 --> 10:16.500
Yeah, you do need some discretion.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.500
There are a lot of mills out there

10:18.500 --> 10:21.500
that won't actually improve your ability to get in.

10:21.500 --> 10:24.500
You do need to look at the school's reputation.

10:24.500 --> 10:31.500
So university film production is probably the second worst deal.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.500
If you're looking at grad level,

10:33.500 --> 10:38.500
you're probably better off doing another undergrad in another topic

10:38.500 --> 10:42.500
and then taking that into grad level production.

10:42.500 --> 10:46.500
Or if you don't want to go on to grad level, look at a vocational school

10:46.500 --> 10:49.500
because it'll cost you a fraction and you'll be done in half the time.

10:49.500 --> 10:52.500
I think whenever people ask, should I go to film school,

10:52.500 --> 10:55.500
if they wanted to go to a vocational school, they would.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.500
I think there is a sort of prestige that's attached to it.

10:57.500 --> 11:00.500
That said, even schools like NYU and USC,

11:00.500 --> 11:03.500
again, even for undergrad, the top ones,

11:03.500 --> 11:06.500
you're not even allowed to touch a camera until you're a junior.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.500
Yeah, and that's...

11:08.500 --> 11:12.500
And people get so pissy about you have to go read Dostoyevsky

11:12.500 --> 11:16.500
and you have to take your math class and your physics requirement.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.500
But that's a liberal arts degree.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.500
That's part of it.

11:20.500 --> 11:24.500
And the problem with film production is it doesn't really mesh with that

11:24.500 --> 11:28.500
in a way that, say, an English or any kind of writing,

11:28.500 --> 11:32.500
creative writing, film studies, would.

11:32.500 --> 11:36.500
And I think the undergrads do kind of get the short end of the stick

11:36.500 --> 11:38.500
in terms of actual experience.

11:38.500 --> 11:40.500
That is the important question.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.500
Would you say that you're able to make a living

11:42.500 --> 11:45.500
purely off of what you went to school for?

11:45.500 --> 11:49.500
With the skills I went to school for, yes.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.500
There are some caveats in that

11:52.500 --> 11:56.500
that would come down to the nitty-gritty of the coursework

11:56.500 --> 12:00.500
of, like, I don't think they did quite enough

12:00.500 --> 12:05.500
to cover things like the reality of corporate video or freelancing.

12:05.500 --> 12:06.500
God, no.

12:06.500 --> 12:10.500
Hey, guys, if you're watching this,

12:10.500 --> 12:13.500
just a reminder, you need to put in

12:13.500 --> 12:17.500
how to charge people as a freelancer into that course material.

12:17.500 --> 12:21.500
It's a bit of feedback that I know they get every single year.

12:21.500 --> 12:24.500
When you go into any film school, it could be the one you went to

12:24.500 --> 12:28.500
or SVA or USC, NYU,

12:28.500 --> 12:34.500
there is a certain level of expectation that people have.

12:34.500 --> 12:36.500
Not all of it is realistic.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.500
And I think that is also the difference between

12:38.500 --> 12:40.500
going into film production when you're older,

12:40.500 --> 12:42.500
have a little more life experience,

12:42.500 --> 12:44.500
because in my grad school experience,

12:44.500 --> 12:52.500
the younger ones tended to be a little more big-headed and unrealistic.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.500
And they learned their lesson eventually.

12:54.500 --> 12:55.500
A little more pie in the sky.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.500
Yeah, they learned their lesson eventually.

12:57.500 --> 13:00.500
There was definitely, like, I think you would see this more

13:00.500 --> 13:04.500
at a school like USC where everyone expects to end up like George Lucas

13:04.500 --> 13:06.500
and have, like, this huge name.

13:06.500 --> 13:09.500
If you're going to school in Calgary,

13:09.500 --> 13:11.500
if you're going to film school in Calgary

13:11.500 --> 13:15.500
and you're not looking to move immediately afterwards,

13:15.500 --> 13:19.500
then you're probably going to have a little bit more grounded expectation

13:19.500 --> 13:21.500
that it's like, hey, if I'm going into production,

13:21.500 --> 13:25.500
I'm probably going to start off as a grip or a lamp-bob.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.500
If I'm coming out of the editing stream,

13:27.500 --> 13:30.500
it's like, I'm going to be an assistant editor or a compiler

13:30.500 --> 13:31.500
or something like that.

13:31.500 --> 13:32.500
I'm going to be a dit.

13:32.500 --> 13:37.500
I'm not going to be, you know, I'm not going to be a DP on a feature.

13:37.500 --> 13:40.500
Because that's another thing is people getting big-headed at the top schools.

13:40.500 --> 13:43.500
It's like, again, people be like,

13:43.500 --> 13:46.500
well, I'm going to be a director the second I graduate.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.500
Ryan Coogler did.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.500
He directed Fruitvale Station.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.500
I think he hadn't even graduated yet.

13:52.500 --> 13:55.500
And then he directed Creed two years later.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.500
So, yeah, it does happen.

13:57.500 --> 14:00.500
You know, so I think tempering kind of that expectation

14:00.500 --> 14:02.500
both in terms of like, what are you going to get out of it?

14:02.500 --> 14:05.500
Like, are you aiming to be technical?

14:05.500 --> 14:08.500
Do you just want to work in movies?

14:08.500 --> 14:10.500
Or do you want to be a YouTuber?

14:10.500 --> 14:15.500
And so if you've got, you know, both good aspirational

14:15.500 --> 14:19.500
and realistic expectations that vary wildly

14:19.500 --> 14:21.500
depending on like where you are

14:21.500 --> 14:25.500
and where you're willing to physically move.

14:25.500 --> 14:26.500
And that's a huge thing

14:26.500 --> 14:30.500
because like Ryan Coogler's example

14:30.500 --> 14:32.500
couldn't have happened outside of California.

14:32.500 --> 14:33.500
No.

14:33.500 --> 14:34.500
No.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.500
And also like with the right connections,

14:36.500 --> 14:38.500
which I believe in his case was Forrest Whitaker.

14:38.500 --> 14:39.500
Yeah.

14:39.500 --> 14:42.500
You know, he crossed paths with Forrest Whitaker at the right time,

14:42.500 --> 14:47.500
which he would not have done if he had not gone to the school he went to when he did.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.500
Like, I mean, there's a lot you can do to stack the odds,

14:50.500 --> 14:54.500
but there's also still kind of a lot of luck that comes into it.

14:54.500 --> 14:55.500
Yeah.

14:55.500 --> 14:57.500
And, you know, right place, right time.

14:57.500 --> 15:01.500
And if you're kind of, if you can't be in that right place,

15:01.500 --> 15:07.500
like if you do want to stay in a fifth tier like place,

15:07.500 --> 15:10.500
like if you want to stay in Georgia, if you want to stay in Kansas,

15:10.500 --> 15:13.500
if you want to stay in Montana or Utah or Alberta.

15:13.500 --> 15:14.500
I don't know if I'd call Georgia a fifth tier though.

15:14.500 --> 15:18.500
I think Georgia's up to, yeah, I think Georgia's solidly two.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.500
Georgia's solidly at two at this point.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.500
They've got CNN, they've got like all the Marvel movies.

15:22.500 --> 15:23.500
Yeah, Georgia's doing alright.

15:23.500 --> 15:24.500
Georgia's doing good.

15:24.500 --> 15:28.500
If you're in kind of one of the smaller markets, you know,

15:28.500 --> 15:31.500
and depending on kind of how small that market is, like, you know,

15:31.500 --> 15:33.500
temper your expectations to it.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.500
Do you want to work your way up to bigger and bigger markets?

15:36.500 --> 15:41.500
Like, you know, if you're in Canada, it's like if you're in Calgary,

15:41.500 --> 15:44.500
are you willing to stick it out long term and keep working on the government grants,

15:44.500 --> 15:47.500
keep working on the stuff until you can get, you know,

15:47.500 --> 15:53.500
basically break into that small circle of Canadian filmmakers who get money,

15:53.500 --> 15:57.500
or are you going to sort of work your way like, all right, I'm in Calgary,

15:57.500 --> 16:01.500
I'm going to move on over to Vancouver, and then I'm going to move to Toronto,

16:01.500 --> 16:03.500
and then I'm going to move to New York, and then I'm going to move to California?

16:03.500 --> 16:04.500
Yeah.

16:04.500 --> 16:10.500
Expecting to know what you want right out of the gate before you make that kind of decision,

16:10.500 --> 16:11.500
it's not going to happen.

16:11.500 --> 16:14.500
I think some people do,

16:14.500 --> 16:18.500
but probably because they've already got a taste of it, like they got a taste of it in high school.

16:18.500 --> 16:20.500
Yeah, not the people who are thinking, should I go to film school?

16:20.500 --> 16:21.500
Yeah.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.500
And that is another thing to talk about.

16:23.500 --> 16:25.500
Like, whenever you want to talk about, like, what's the big five,

16:25.500 --> 16:35.500
it's USC, NYU, AFI, the one that doesn't matter, and I think Florida State.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.500
Is that right?

16:37.500 --> 16:40.500
That's the three, like, who cares?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.500
It's true.

16:43.500 --> 16:46.500
Well, pass the four, I guess, because you're going to want to include UC.

16:46.500 --> 16:47.500
No, it doesn't matter.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.500
It doesn't matter, but, I mean...

16:49.500 --> 16:51.500
We don't say the name of our archenemy.

16:51.500 --> 16:52.500
Yeah.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.500
They're not my archenemy.

16:54.500 --> 17:00.500
Okay, so, like, AFI recently took the crown from USC as the top film school,

17:00.500 --> 17:06.500
and the reason I didn't even bother applying to AFI is AFI does assume some,

17:06.500 --> 17:13.500
actually not insubstantial amount of experience in your field of choice.

17:13.500 --> 17:19.500
You have to apply to a track, like directing, cinematography, editing, writing,

17:19.500 --> 17:22.500
and you cannot stray out of that track.

17:22.500 --> 17:26.500
AFI's program is a lot shorter for that reason.

17:26.500 --> 17:29.500
I think it's only a year, year and a half,

17:29.500 --> 17:36.500
and it doesn't really offer you much outside of whatever your specialized vocation is.

17:36.500 --> 17:40.500
A lot of the more artistic sorts come from AFI.

17:40.500 --> 17:44.500
You're David Lynch, you're Darren Aronofsky,

17:44.500 --> 17:48.500
and they want to cultivate your auteurness.

17:48.500 --> 17:54.500
Yeah, AFI's kind of an up-your-game sort of destination.

17:54.500 --> 17:55.500
Yeah.

17:55.500 --> 17:59.500
So, and that obviously only applies to grad.

17:59.500 --> 18:03.500
Columbia's grad program, also, Columbia doesn't bother having an undergrad program,

18:03.500 --> 18:07.500
but their grad program's definitely on the ups and has some, you know, big-name alumni,

18:07.500 --> 18:08.500
like Katherine Bigelow.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.500
For that reason, I assume they're more commercial.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.500
I don't know, I didn't go there.

18:12.500 --> 18:17.500
NYU is a lot more indie and artistic.

18:17.500 --> 18:23.500
You have, from there, alumni like Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Spike Lee,

18:23.500 --> 18:27.500
Brett Ratner,

18:27.500 --> 18:30.500
Michael, oh, Wesleyan, Michael Bay, Joss Whedon,

18:30.500 --> 18:34.500
and one of my NYU professors actually all went to Wesleyan at the same time,

18:34.500 --> 18:36.500
for undergrad, no less.

18:36.500 --> 18:39.500
See, undergrad can do you good.

18:39.500 --> 18:46.500
Canada would be University of Toronto, McGill, and SAIT.

18:46.500 --> 18:51.500
There's a lot of other, like, decent programs and specialized programs

18:51.500 --> 18:54.500
scattered around the post-production industries,

18:54.500 --> 19:00.500
but those would be the three big that are either producing working directors,

19:00.500 --> 19:02.500
which would be McGill and U of T,

19:02.500 --> 19:08.500
or technicians, which would be SAIT and U of T.

19:08.500 --> 19:14.500
Strangely, most of the people in Vancouver just sort of learn on the job.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.500
I think that's what most people do.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.500
Because whenever people tell you that you don't need a degree

19:18.500 --> 19:22.500
or you don't need to go to school in order to work in film,

19:22.500 --> 19:25.500
they're right. They're absolutely right.

19:25.500 --> 19:28.500
But here's the thing, it's so much harder.

19:28.500 --> 19:34.500
It's like just, I mean, I can't, I guess the same could apply for engineering

19:34.500 --> 19:38.500
or any other thing that requires actual skills and knowledge.

19:38.500 --> 19:42.500
It is really difficult to just dive into something

19:42.500 --> 19:45.500
and just work your way up from, like, a PA.

19:45.500 --> 19:48.500
It's really easy to flame out.

19:48.500 --> 19:49.500
Yes.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.500
So one of the great things that film school gives you,

19:51.500 --> 19:57.500
like even if you go to a vocational school or a technical college for it,

19:57.500 --> 20:01.500
is that it gives you a better sense of the whole,

20:01.500 --> 20:04.500
so that rather than like, hey, I want to work in movies,

20:04.500 --> 20:07.500
and it's like, okay, so you took your set etiquette and protocol course

20:07.500 --> 20:10.500
and now you're a PA blocking off roads,

20:10.500 --> 20:14.500
and you're going to be doing that for the next two, three years.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.500
Because you don't have a better sense of the whole,

20:16.500 --> 20:19.500
you're not going to be able to think strategically about your job,

20:19.500 --> 20:23.500
which is like, okay, I'm a PA, I'm doing roads,

20:23.500 --> 20:26.500
I want to get to know the people over in locations,

20:26.500 --> 20:29.500
I want to get to know the people over in set,

20:29.500 --> 20:31.500
and I either want to become a specialized PA

20:31.500 --> 20:34.500
or I want to get into the office.

20:34.500 --> 20:38.500
Because even though an office PA is still just a PA,

20:38.500 --> 20:41.500
they're working with the director, they're working with the first AD,

20:41.500 --> 20:43.500
they're working with the production coordinator,

20:43.500 --> 20:44.500
they're working with the production manager,

20:44.500 --> 20:47.500
they're seeing the producer, they're getting to know names and faces.

20:47.500 --> 20:50.500
If you can't think strategically about it,

20:50.500 --> 20:54.500
then you're going to be a locations PA forever,

20:54.500 --> 20:57.500
and you're just going to be locking off roads for three years

20:57.500 --> 21:00.500
until you're like, screw this, I'm going to go get a normal job

21:00.500 --> 21:03.500
that actually pays the same and doesn't require me

21:03.500 --> 21:06.500
to work 16-hour days for three weeks in a row.

21:06.500 --> 21:09.500
The way you think film sets work,

21:09.500 --> 21:12.500
if you've never worked on one or never been taught how they work,

21:12.500 --> 21:14.500
you're wrong.

21:14.500 --> 21:16.500
Holy God, are you wrong.

21:16.500 --> 21:19.500
I'm not going to name any names here,

21:19.500 --> 21:22.500
but I've been on some sets

21:22.500 --> 21:25.500
by people who have never been on a real set

21:25.500 --> 21:28.500
that are just a total shit show,

21:28.500 --> 21:32.500
and you need to know basic things.

21:32.500 --> 21:35.500
How were craft services on those sets?

21:36.500 --> 21:39.500
I think it's also really dangerous

21:39.500 --> 21:42.500
for the entry-level person to just fall in

21:42.500 --> 21:45.500
with a bunch of asshats that are going to exploit you

21:45.500 --> 21:47.500
and teach you nothing.

21:47.500 --> 21:50.500
Oh, there's another dimension to it,

21:50.500 --> 21:53.500
is that there are a ton,

21:53.500 --> 21:56.500
even still to this day,

21:56.500 --> 22:01.500
a metric ton of exploitative assholes out there

22:01.500 --> 22:04.500
who are looking for people who want to be in movies

22:04.500 --> 22:07.500
and they will overwork them, underpay them,

22:07.500 --> 22:10.500
or not pay them at all, and put them at risk.

22:10.500 --> 22:13.500
If you're looking to work on a film set, do not work for free.

22:13.500 --> 22:16.500
Don't do it. Even if they're your friends.

22:16.500 --> 22:19.500
If they're your best friend, then maybe, but don't work for free.

22:19.500 --> 22:22.500
You don't have to work for free.

22:22.500 --> 22:25.500
You should be making at least $100 a day as an entry-level person, probably more.

22:25.500 --> 22:28.500
Here's one of the biggest things that you're going to get from film school

22:28.500 --> 22:32.500
that you're not necessarily going to have enough of,

22:32.500 --> 22:35.500
because you can never have enough of,

22:35.500 --> 22:38.500
but that you're really not going to have enough of

22:38.500 --> 22:41.500
if you just dive right into it, and that's safety training.

22:41.500 --> 22:44.500
Because film sets are frickin' dangerous.

22:44.500 --> 22:47.500
You have a lot of people moving around,

22:47.500 --> 22:50.500
you have a lot of heavy equipment, you have a lot of specialized equipment.

22:50.500 --> 22:53.500
If it's anything approaching a big set,

22:53.500 --> 22:56.500
then you're talking about really, really high voltages.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.500
There are a ton of safety concerns,

22:59.500 --> 23:02.500
and when you run into these non-union shoots

23:02.500 --> 23:05.500
where it's just some fly-by-night company...

23:05.500 --> 23:08.500
Someone literally, yeah, that girl in Georgia...

23:08.500 --> 23:11.500
Yeah, which is exactly where it's going.

23:11.500 --> 23:14.500
Literally died.

23:14.500 --> 23:17.500
This fly-by-night production company's like,

23:17.500 --> 23:20.500
hey, we're going to make this movie,

23:20.500 --> 23:23.500
and so they got a whole bunch of teenagers and 20-somethings

23:23.500 --> 23:26.500
who wanted to be in movies, and they had a couple trained people,

23:26.500 --> 23:29.500
and Sarah was one of them, and she was first camera assistant,

23:29.500 --> 23:32.500
and they had this setup where they were doing this dream sequence

23:32.500 --> 23:35.500
out on the train tracks,

23:35.500 --> 23:38.500
and the production coordinator had called the rail office

23:38.500 --> 23:41.500
to try and book the track,

23:41.500 --> 23:44.500
and they had been rejected

23:44.500 --> 23:47.500
because there was a train going through,

23:47.500 --> 23:50.500
like there was a shipment going through at that time,

23:50.500 --> 23:53.500
and the producer, who was also the director,

23:53.500 --> 23:56.500
was like, well, screw it.

23:56.500 --> 23:59.500
We're going to be maverick filmmakers.

23:59.500 --> 24:02.500
We're just going to go rogue

24:02.500 --> 24:05.500
and do it anyway,

24:05.500 --> 24:08.500
and a woman lost her life.

24:08.500 --> 24:11.500
There are other issues to consider,

24:11.500 --> 24:14.500
like race and gender issues and discriminations,

24:14.500 --> 24:17.500
which we're not going to get into now.

24:17.500 --> 24:20.500
That's, I think, maybe a topic for another day.

24:21.500 --> 24:24.500
It's difficult to say is it worth it,

24:24.500 --> 24:27.500
because it depends on what you want,

24:27.500 --> 24:30.500
and it's such a wide spectrum of questions to ask,

24:30.500 --> 24:33.500
whether you want to get into a vocational school

24:33.500 --> 24:36.500
so you can learn a trade and then just make a living,

24:36.500 --> 24:39.500
or if you want to be a big-name film person

24:39.500 --> 24:42.500
and go to all the fun film festivals every year

24:42.500 --> 24:45.500
or be a professor or something.

24:45.500 --> 24:48.500
I think a lot of it really does come down to cost,

24:49.500 --> 24:52.500
because whenever I get asked the question,

24:52.500 --> 24:55.500
is it worth it?

24:55.500 --> 24:58.500
In my case, I kind of go back and forth

24:58.500 --> 25:01.500
because it all comes down to that debt,

25:01.500 --> 25:04.500
because if I didn't go into debt,

25:04.500 --> 25:07.500
or if I'd even gone into less debt,

25:07.500 --> 25:10.500
like even half the debt I'm in now,

25:10.500 --> 25:13.500
I would say, yeah, it was totally worth it,

25:13.500 --> 25:16.500
but to be $10,000 more in debt now

25:16.500 --> 25:19.500
except for the fact that the school

25:19.500 --> 25:22.500
doesn't really offer aid to grad students

25:22.500 --> 25:25.500
because it's the top film school,

25:25.500 --> 25:28.500
and if you don't want to pay it,

25:28.500 --> 25:31.500
there's 200 people in line behind you

25:31.500 --> 25:34.500
that will kill to be in your place.

25:34.500 --> 25:37.500
That's part of the real challenge with the big ones,

25:37.500 --> 25:40.500
is it's almost like gambling.

25:40.500 --> 25:43.500
Yeah, you are kind of getting potential access

25:43.500 --> 25:46.500
to a spotlight career really quickly,

25:49.500 --> 25:52.500
but if you're not the lucky one...

25:55.500 --> 25:58.500
I mean, even if you are the lucky one,

25:58.500 --> 26:01.500
it's a thing.

26:01.500 --> 26:04.500
The only exception I know is Ryan Coogler.

26:04.500 --> 26:07.500
Even the other people I know that are super doing really well

26:07.500 --> 26:10.500
are still in a lot of debt.

26:10.500 --> 26:13.500
If you are the one lucky one,

26:13.500 --> 26:16.500
then it's still going to take a while to pay that down.

26:16.500 --> 26:19.500
It's true of all grad schools.

26:19.500 --> 26:22.500
If you're $60,000, $200,000 in debt,

26:22.500 --> 26:25.500
that will just follow you around

26:25.500 --> 26:28.500
and it will affect your life decisions.

26:28.500 --> 26:31.500
One important thing, if you pay your minimum payments

26:31.500 --> 26:34.500
every year for 25 years, if you have federal loans,

26:34.500 --> 26:37.500
they will get forgiven at the end of that period.

26:37.500 --> 26:40.500
That is true.

26:40.500 --> 26:43.500
On the flip side, I can think of very few downsides

26:43.500 --> 26:46.500
to taking the vocational route.

26:46.500 --> 26:49.500
Yes, it's not going to...

26:49.500 --> 26:52.500
You have a much lower chance of being a star,

26:52.500 --> 26:55.500
but you can make a living

26:55.500 --> 26:58.500
working in movies or working in related fields.

27:01.500 --> 27:04.500
It's not the easiest life,

27:04.500 --> 27:07.500
it's not the easiest living,

27:07.500 --> 27:10.500
there is a lot of uncertainty.

27:10.500 --> 27:13.500
But at the same time,

27:13.500 --> 27:16.500
it's doable.

27:16.500 --> 27:19.500
It's totally doable.

27:19.500 --> 27:22.500
The pay-in, particularly for a vocational school,

27:22.500 --> 27:25.500
if it's a state school or a federally funded school...

27:25.500 --> 27:28.500
Or even if you get financial aid,

27:28.500 --> 27:31.500
which I hear happens at the school that shall not be named.

27:31.500 --> 27:34.500
If it's two years

27:34.500 --> 27:37.500
and it's only going to cost you $10,000 in tuition,

27:37.500 --> 27:40.500
then...

27:40.500 --> 27:43.500
Totally worth it.

27:43.500 --> 27:46.500
If you're young and you don't have any debt,

27:46.500 --> 27:49.500
$10,000 might seem like a lot.

27:49.500 --> 27:52.500
It's amazing the difference between $10,000 and $60,000.

27:52.500 --> 27:55.500
I had paid for most of it,

27:55.500 --> 27:58.500
so by the time I was done,

27:58.500 --> 28:01.500
I was in debt and I got a film-related job

28:01.500 --> 28:04.500
right out of school,

28:04.500 --> 28:07.500
and I was debt-free by Christmas.

28:07.500 --> 28:10.500
I feel like I could be debt-free

28:10.500 --> 28:13.500
solely based on my freelance income,

28:13.500 --> 28:16.500
YouTube income, and Patreon income.

28:16.500 --> 28:19.500
I could be debt-free...

28:19.500 --> 28:22.500
2030.

28:22.500 --> 28:25.500
14 years?

28:25.500 --> 28:28.500
What is the amount of student debt interest

28:28.500 --> 28:31.500
you can write off every year?

28:31.500 --> 28:34.500
It is $2,500.

28:34.500 --> 28:37.500
I accrue about $4,000.

28:37.500 --> 28:40.500
America!

28:40.500 --> 28:43.500
I think that's a good place to end,

28:43.500 --> 28:46.500
and then I'm going to jump on a plane

28:46.500 --> 28:49.500
and go back to the land of socialized medicine

28:49.500 --> 28:52.500
and mitigated student debt.

28:52.500 --> 28:55.500
I'm very wealthy.
