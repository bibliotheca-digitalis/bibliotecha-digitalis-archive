0	3500	So, uh, what are you doing with your life?
3500	5500	Ha ha ha ha!
5500	12000	♪♪♪
12000	18500	I actually just finished a, uh, finished working as the Dit on a feature, feature-length film.
18500	19500	And what is that?
19500	23500	Oh, so Dit is the digital information technologist.
23500	28500	It's basically the person who takes all of the footage that the camera shoots
28500	33500	and backs it up, creates redundancy, and gets it off to editing.
33500	36500	And where did you learn to do these things, Dano?
36500	40500	So, by and large, I learned how to do these things at film school.
40500	41500	Really?
41500	42500	Yeah, sort of.
42500	43500	Film school?
43500	45500	A question that I get asked all the time on Twitter...
45500	46500	Me too, yes.
46500	49500	...is, should I go to film school?
51500	53500	Maybe.
53500	56500	I like saying, should I take this job?
56500	58500	Or should I go out with this guy?
58500	60500	Like, I don't know, it depends on...
60500	61500	It depends.
61500	65500	I would say one of the big things that really should factor into whether or not you want to go to film school
65500	68500	is you've got to look at what film school actually means.
68500	73500	So, in my case, so we both went to film school, but we...
73500	74500	I went to two.
74500	78500	But we had vastly different experiences in regard to that,
78500	85500	because there's university-level film school, and then there's also technical colleges.
85500	86500	Like a vocational school.
86500	87500	Yeah.
87500	90500	So, I went to a technical college for film school.
90500	98500	So, it was a two-year diploma program, very tech and how-to-get-a-job focused.
98500	102500	So, Selden, Alberta Institute of Technology was where I went.
102500	110500	And they were very much focused on, like, okay, getting a job in film in Alberta or Vancouver or Saskatchewan.
110500	113500	What was the cost for your education?
113500	118500	About $2,000 to $2,500 per semester.
118500	119500	So, four semesters.
119500	122500	So, a little under $10,000 for tuition.
125500	131500	USC does not offer aid for their grad students, at least in the first year.
132500	135500	Or at least they didn't in 2009. Maybe that's changed.
135500	140500	It was about $1,400 per credit hour.
142500	148500	There was six to ten credit hours per semester.
148500	151500	I completed 40 credit hours.
151500	153500	Then there was, like, the fees and the insurance.
153500	156500	Yeah, and you're going to have all of the other stuff.
156500	159500	So, that's just your cost for the course registrations.
159500	164500	Then there was the cost of the films itself, which, of course, you have to pay for.
164500	172500	I had finished two and a half years of the coursework, and I had $60,000 in debt.
172500	177500	And I had paid in another $45,000-ish.
177500	179500	I was one of the lucky ones.
179500	183500	I knew people who left with $200,000-plus in debt.
183500	188500	I mean, and on top of that, particularly with the way that debt accumulates,
188500	192500	that you're going to be paying off interest before you're even touching the principal.
192500	194500	Yes, I left with $60,000.
194500	200500	I have paid into it about $19,000.
200500	203500	I now have $69,000.
206500	207500	Yeah.
207500	209500	My undergrad was at NYU.
210500	213500	I don't know if I would call that a film school because it was film studies,
213500	217500	which is the way I described it back then was it's like an English degree,
217500	219500	only instead of studying books, you study movies.
219500	223500	It's much more about film history, criticism, academia, theory.
223500	228500	I decided to go into production, which is completely different.
228500	234500	The only time when I was an undergrad, the production people and the studies people's paths crossed
234500	236500	was in this intro course.
237500	239500	The production people were like,
239500	243500	why do we need to know interpretive stuff?
243500	244500	This is stupid.
244500	246500	Let's just go out and run around with a camera.
246500	248500	It's just sort of like, ugh.
248500	250500	Oh, the things I could tell them.
250500	254500	The problems when tech people don't understand the interpretive
254500	256500	and just create stuff and you're like,
256500	259500	why did people get that meaning from it?
259500	260500	I also feel like for that reason,
260500	263500	there's a massive disparity between grad and undergrad,
263500	264500	and we can talk about that.
264500	266500	I decided very snootily.
266500	270500	I was like, well, I'm not going to go to film school if I can't go to the very best one.
270500	272500	There's three very best ones.
273500	276500	NYU, AFI, and USC.
276500	278500	UCLA would say they're in there.
278500	279500	They're not.
281500	282500	I applied to two.
282500	284500	I got into one, and that was USC.
285500	287500	I went to AFI and UCLA.
287500	288500	I didn't bother applying to those.
288500	292500	It was also very focused on industry stuff and getting a job,
292500	296500	but I think the only way to describe it is like a conservatory.
296500	301500	It was like a three-year boot camp, and there is nothing else.
301500	305500	There are no other classes that you take except for the business classes.
305500	309500	It's completely intensive and also really intense.
309500	312500	I think the main difference between USC and other film schools
312500	317500	is no one really had a film background or not a very substantive one.
317500	319500	They didn't want people that did film in undergrad.
319500	321500	SAIT was just kind of general.
321500	325500	A lot of people were coming into it straight out of high school.
325500	327500	Some people were switching careers.
327500	331500	Of course, it's a lot more local because it is smaller,
331500	335500	especially in terms of total industry output.
335500	341500	Calgary is a film city, but we're like a fifth-tier film city,
341500	343500	if we're honest about it.
343500	347500	A big consideration in whether or not to go to film school
347500	352500	is what school you're going to and how much is it going to cost you
352500	355500	and what do you intend to get out of it.
355500	357500	Whenever people say, should I go to film school,
357500	360500	I feel like there is a massive, massive divide
360500	362500	between do you want to go to a top film school
362500	365500	and do you want to go to a vocational school.
365500	371500	While, for instance, the debt is insane,
371500	374500	I went to school with a lot of people
374500	377500	who are already working in the industry
377500	380500	in a way that I don't think you see in other film schools.
380500	384500	I went to school with a guy who directed Creed
384500	386500	and is directing Black Panther.
386500	388500	I worked on his student films.
388500	393500	The editor for Black Panther was the editor for my thesis.
393500	399500	I also went to school with Mira Minon, who did Equity recently.
399500	402500	These are just directors and big-name people.
402500	405500	I knew people who worked on the Mindy Project.
405500	410500	The thing about USC is if you want to work on big-name things
410500	413500	and really be a star.
413500	417500	Yeah, if you want to work on big-name things above the line.
417500	420500	I've got tons of friends who have worked on big-name things.
420500	422500	I've got tons of friends who have worked on big-name things,
422500	425500	tons of friends who worked on The Revenant,
425500	427500	who worked on Intergalactic.
427500	429500	Someone's got to go door-to-door with checks being like,
429500	432500	hey, business, we're going to be shooting here.
432500	434500	Here's your money for the day in case your business
434500	436500	ends up in the background of our movie.
436500	439500	Whenever you have your eye to a top film school,
439500	442500	it's basically just a huge leg up.
442500	444500	It's not a guarantee for anything.
444500	447500	There are people that didn't go to film school
447500	449500	that are also huge stars.
449500	450500	Tarantino didn't, right?
450500	451500	No.
451500	453500	Then there are all the other ones.
453500	455500	Bryan Singer went to USC.
455500	458500	Robert Zemeckis, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg didn't,
458500	460500	but he's got an office there.
460500	462500	I don't know.
462500	465500	I think the other thing is, at least in my experience,
465500	469500	I know this feels like an apologia for horrible student debt
469500	472500	and yeah, let's all go to the University of Spoiled Children.
472500	478500	I honestly do feel like for the level of immersion I got
478500	480500	in the amount of time that I did,
480500	483500	I feel like their approach where you're not allowed
483500	486500	to take a specialized anything until you do a year
486500	488500	where you specialize in everything,
488500	491500	their rationale being you can't be a good editor
491500	493500	unless you know what it is to be a director or a cinematographer,
493500	496500	so even if you don't like it, you have to do it.
496500	501500	However, I feel like my experience is limited to the grad program
501500	505500	and also all the successful people came out of the grad program.
505500	509500	I don't know how I feel about undergrad liberal arts
509500	512500	film production programs.
512500	513500	Film production programs.
513500	514500	Yeah.
514500	519500	Film studies, I'm a huge fan.
519500	525500	I believe in media literacy quite strongly,
525500	528500	so I think any kind of literary course,
528500	532500	whether it's film studies or literature classics, whatnot,
532500	536500	I think those are very flexible in teaching you
536500	539500	how to navigate information.
539500	544500	Yeah, and I feel like people who call shit like that useless degrees
544500	549500	don't know how degrees work or what degrees do,
549500	555500	so I can point to myself as someone who does directly use their degree
555500	558500	in their chosen field of study,
558500	562500	but I don't think that necessarily has anything to do with anything.
562500	566500	That also said, like I said, everyone in my master's program
566500	569500	came out of some form of liberal art,
569500	572500	or maybe they were in their 30s and they'd worked for a while,
572500	574500	or they came out of journalism.
574500	578500	They came out of all walks of life, and that was sort of the intent,
578500	581500	and no one had gone for undergrad.
581500	584500	I was a TA for the undergrads for a couple semesters,
584500	588500	and the disparity in quality that came out of the grad program
588500	590500	and the undergrad program was so vast,
590500	593500	and the grads weren't that much older than the undergrads.
593500	596500	I think just from what I've seen around,
596500	603500	I think undergrad film production programs are...
603500	605500	I don't want to say they're the worst value
605500	609500	because the worst value would be the for-profit mills.
609500	612500	Yes, the full sales in the University of Phoenix.
612500	616500	Yeah, you do need some discretion.
616500	618500	There are a lot of mills out there
618500	621500	that won't actually improve your ability to get in.
621500	624500	You do need to look at the school's reputation.
624500	631500	So university film production is probably the second worst deal.
631500	633500	If you're looking at grad level,
633500	638500	you're probably better off doing another undergrad in another topic
638500	642500	and then taking that into grad level production.
642500	646500	Or if you don't want to go on to grad level, look at a vocational school
646500	649500	because it'll cost you a fraction and you'll be done in half the time.
649500	652500	I think whenever people ask, should I go to film school,
652500	655500	if they wanted to go to a vocational school, they would.
655500	657500	I think there is a sort of prestige that's attached to it.
657500	660500	That said, even schools like NYU and USC,
660500	663500	again, even for undergrad, the top ones,
663500	666500	you're not even allowed to touch a camera until you're a junior.
666500	668500	Yeah, and that's...
668500	672500	And people get so pissy about you have to go read Dostoyevsky
672500	676500	and you have to take your math class and your physics requirement.
676500	678500	But that's a liberal arts degree.
678500	680500	That's part of it.
680500	684500	And the problem with film production is it doesn't really mesh with that
684500	688500	in a way that, say, an English or any kind of writing,
688500	692500	creative writing, film studies, would.
692500	696500	And I think the undergrads do kind of get the short end of the stick
696500	698500	in terms of actual experience.
698500	700500	That is the important question.
700500	702500	Would you say that you're able to make a living
702500	705500	purely off of what you went to school for?
705500	709500	With the skills I went to school for, yes.
709500	712500	There are some caveats in that
712500	716500	that would come down to the nitty-gritty of the coursework
716500	720500	of, like, I don't think they did quite enough
720500	725500	to cover things like the reality of corporate video or freelancing.
725500	726500	God, no.
726500	730500	Hey, guys, if you're watching this,
730500	733500	just a reminder, you need to put in
733500	737500	how to charge people as a freelancer into that course material.
737500	741500	It's a bit of feedback that I know they get every single year.
741500	744500	When you go into any film school, it could be the one you went to
744500	748500	or SVA or USC, NYU,
748500	754500	there is a certain level of expectation that people have.
754500	756500	Not all of it is realistic.
756500	758500	And I think that is also the difference between
758500	760500	going into film production when you're older,
760500	762500	have a little more life experience,
762500	764500	because in my grad school experience,
764500	772500	the younger ones tended to be a little more big-headed and unrealistic.
772500	774500	And they learned their lesson eventually.
774500	775500	A little more pie in the sky.
775500	777500	Yeah, they learned their lesson eventually.
777500	780500	There was definitely, like, I think you would see this more
780500	784500	at a school like USC where everyone expects to end up like George Lucas
784500	786500	and have, like, this huge name.
786500	789500	If you're going to school in Calgary,
789500	791500	if you're going to film school in Calgary
791500	795500	and you're not looking to move immediately afterwards,
795500	799500	then you're probably going to have a little bit more grounded expectation
799500	801500	that it's like, hey, if I'm going into production,
801500	805500	I'm probably going to start off as a grip or a lamp-bob.
805500	807500	If I'm coming out of the editing stream,
807500	810500	it's like, I'm going to be an assistant editor or a compiler
810500	811500	or something like that.
811500	812500	I'm going to be a dit.
812500	817500	I'm not going to be, you know, I'm not going to be a DP on a feature.
817500	820500	Because that's another thing is people getting big-headed at the top schools.
820500	823500	It's like, again, people be like,
823500	826500	well, I'm going to be a director the second I graduate.
826500	828500	Ryan Coogler did.
828500	830500	He directed Fruitvale Station.
830500	832500	I think he hadn't even graduated yet.
832500	835500	And then he directed Creed two years later.
835500	837500	So, yeah, it does happen.
837500	840500	You know, so I think tempering kind of that expectation
840500	842500	both in terms of like, what are you going to get out of it?
842500	845500	Like, are you aiming to be technical?
845500	848500	Do you just want to work in movies?
848500	850500	Or do you want to be a YouTuber?
850500	855500	And so if you've got, you know, both good aspirational
855500	859500	and realistic expectations that vary wildly
859500	861500	depending on like where you are
861500	865500	and where you're willing to physically move.
865500	866500	And that's a huge thing
866500	870500	because like Ryan Coogler's example
870500	872500	couldn't have happened outside of California.
872500	873500	No.
873500	874500	No.
874500	876500	And also like with the right connections,
876500	878500	which I believe in his case was Forrest Whitaker.
878500	879500	Yeah.
879500	882500	You know, he crossed paths with Forrest Whitaker at the right time,
882500	887500	which he would not have done if he had not gone to the school he went to when he did.
887500	890500	Like, I mean, there's a lot you can do to stack the odds,
890500	894500	but there's also still kind of a lot of luck that comes into it.
894500	895500	Yeah.
895500	897500	And, you know, right place, right time.
897500	901500	And if you're kind of, if you can't be in that right place,
901500	907500	like if you do want to stay in a fifth tier like place,
907500	910500	like if you want to stay in Georgia, if you want to stay in Kansas,
910500	913500	if you want to stay in Montana or Utah or Alberta.
913500	914500	I don't know if I'd call Georgia a fifth tier though.
914500	918500	I think Georgia's up to, yeah, I think Georgia's solidly two.
918500	920500	Georgia's solidly at two at this point.
920500	922500	They've got CNN, they've got like all the Marvel movies.
922500	923500	Yeah, Georgia's doing alright.
923500	924500	Georgia's doing good.
924500	928500	If you're in kind of one of the smaller markets, you know,
928500	931500	and depending on kind of how small that market is, like, you know,
931500	933500	temper your expectations to it.
933500	936500	Do you want to work your way up to bigger and bigger markets?
936500	941500	Like, you know, if you're in Canada, it's like if you're in Calgary,
941500	944500	are you willing to stick it out long term and keep working on the government grants,
944500	947500	keep working on the stuff until you can get, you know,
947500	953500	basically break into that small circle of Canadian filmmakers who get money,
953500	957500	or are you going to sort of work your way like, all right, I'm in Calgary,
957500	961500	I'm going to move on over to Vancouver, and then I'm going to move to Toronto,
961500	963500	and then I'm going to move to New York, and then I'm going to move to California?
963500	964500	Yeah.
964500	970500	Expecting to know what you want right out of the gate before you make that kind of decision,
970500	971500	it's not going to happen.
971500	974500	I think some people do,
974500	978500	but probably because they've already got a taste of it, like they got a taste of it in high school.
978500	980500	Yeah, not the people who are thinking, should I go to film school?
980500	981500	Yeah.
981500	983500	And that is another thing to talk about.
983500	985500	Like, whenever you want to talk about, like, what's the big five,
985500	995500	it's USC, NYU, AFI, the one that doesn't matter, and I think Florida State.
995500	997500	Is that right?
997500	1000500	That's the three, like, who cares?
1000500	1002500	It's true.
1003500	1006500	Well, pass the four, I guess, because you're going to want to include UC.
1006500	1007500	No, it doesn't matter.
1007500	1009500	It doesn't matter, but, I mean...
1009500	1011500	We don't say the name of our archenemy.
1011500	1012500	Yeah.
1012500	1014500	They're not my archenemy.
1014500	1020500	Okay, so, like, AFI recently took the crown from USC as the top film school,
1020500	1026500	and the reason I didn't even bother applying to AFI is AFI does assume some,
1026500	1033500	actually not insubstantial amount of experience in your field of choice.
1033500	1039500	You have to apply to a track, like directing, cinematography, editing, writing,
1039500	1042500	and you cannot stray out of that track.
1042500	1046500	AFI's program is a lot shorter for that reason.
1046500	1049500	I think it's only a year, year and a half,
1049500	1056500	and it doesn't really offer you much outside of whatever your specialized vocation is.
1056500	1060500	A lot of the more artistic sorts come from AFI.
1060500	1064500	You're David Lynch, you're Darren Aronofsky,
1064500	1068500	and they want to cultivate your auteurness.
1068500	1074500	Yeah, AFI's kind of an up-your-game sort of destination.
1074500	1075500	Yeah.
1075500	1079500	So, and that obviously only applies to grad.
1079500	1083500	Columbia's grad program, also, Columbia doesn't bother having an undergrad program,
1083500	1087500	but their grad program's definitely on the ups and has some, you know, big-name alumni,
1087500	1088500	like Katherine Bigelow.
1088500	1090500	For that reason, I assume they're more commercial.
1090500	1092500	I don't know, I didn't go there.
1092500	1097500	NYU is a lot more indie and artistic.
1097500	1103500	You have, from there, alumni like Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Spike Lee,
1103500	1107500	Brett Ratner,
1107500	1110500	Michael, oh, Wesleyan, Michael Bay, Joss Whedon,
1110500	1114500	and one of my NYU professors actually all went to Wesleyan at the same time,
1114500	1116500	for undergrad, no less.
1116500	1119500	See, undergrad can do you good.
1119500	1126500	Canada would be University of Toronto, McGill, and SAIT.
1126500	1131500	There's a lot of other, like, decent programs and specialized programs
1131500	1134500	scattered around the post-production industries,
1134500	1140500	but those would be the three big that are either producing working directors,
1140500	1142500	which would be McGill and U of T,
1142500	1148500	or technicians, which would be SAIT and U of T.
1148500	1154500	Strangely, most of the people in Vancouver just sort of learn on the job.
1154500	1156500	I think that's what most people do.
1156500	1158500	Because whenever people tell you that you don't need a degree
1158500	1162500	or you don't need to go to school in order to work in film,
1162500	1165500	they're right. They're absolutely right.
1165500	1168500	But here's the thing, it's so much harder.
1168500	1174500	It's like just, I mean, I can't, I guess the same could apply for engineering
1174500	1178500	or any other thing that requires actual skills and knowledge.
1178500	1182500	It is really difficult to just dive into something
1182500	1185500	and just work your way up from, like, a PA.
1185500	1188500	It's really easy to flame out.
1188500	1189500	Yes.
1189500	1191500	So one of the great things that film school gives you,
1191500	1197500	like even if you go to a vocational school or a technical college for it,
1197500	1201500	is that it gives you a better sense of the whole,
1201500	1204500	so that rather than like, hey, I want to work in movies,
1204500	1207500	and it's like, okay, so you took your set etiquette and protocol course
1207500	1210500	and now you're a PA blocking off roads,
1210500	1214500	and you're going to be doing that for the next two, three years.
1214500	1216500	Because you don't have a better sense of the whole,
1216500	1219500	you're not going to be able to think strategically about your job,
1219500	1223500	which is like, okay, I'm a PA, I'm doing roads,
1223500	1226500	I want to get to know the people over in locations,
1226500	1229500	I want to get to know the people over in set,
1229500	1231500	and I either want to become a specialized PA
1231500	1234500	or I want to get into the office.
1234500	1238500	Because even though an office PA is still just a PA,
1238500	1241500	they're working with the director, they're working with the first AD,
1241500	1243500	they're working with the production coordinator,
1243500	1244500	they're working with the production manager,
1244500	1247500	they're seeing the producer, they're getting to know names and faces.
1247500	1250500	If you can't think strategically about it,
1250500	1254500	then you're going to be a locations PA forever,
1254500	1257500	and you're just going to be locking off roads for three years
1257500	1260500	until you're like, screw this, I'm going to go get a normal job
1260500	1263500	that actually pays the same and doesn't require me
1263500	1266500	to work 16-hour days for three weeks in a row.
1266500	1269500	The way you think film sets work,
1269500	1272500	if you've never worked on one or never been taught how they work,
1272500	1274500	you're wrong.
1274500	1276500	Holy God, are you wrong.
1276500	1279500	I'm not going to name any names here,
1279500	1282500	but I've been on some sets
1282500	1285500	by people who have never been on a real set
1285500	1288500	that are just a total shit show,
1288500	1292500	and you need to know basic things.
1292500	1295500	How were craft services on those sets?
1296500	1299500	I think it's also really dangerous
1299500	1302500	for the entry-level person to just fall in
1302500	1305500	with a bunch of asshats that are going to exploit you
1305500	1307500	and teach you nothing.
1307500	1310500	Oh, there's another dimension to it,
1310500	1313500	is that there are a ton,
1313500	1316500	even still to this day,
1316500	1321500	a metric ton of exploitative assholes out there
1321500	1324500	who are looking for people who want to be in movies
1324500	1327500	and they will overwork them, underpay them,
1327500	1330500	or not pay them at all, and put them at risk.
1330500	1333500	If you're looking to work on a film set, do not work for free.
1333500	1336500	Don't do it. Even if they're your friends.
1336500	1339500	If they're your best friend, then maybe, but don't work for free.
1339500	1342500	You don't have to work for free.
1342500	1345500	You should be making at least $100 a day as an entry-level person, probably more.
1345500	1348500	Here's one of the biggest things that you're going to get from film school
1348500	1352500	that you're not necessarily going to have enough of,
1352500	1355500	because you can never have enough of,
1355500	1358500	but that you're really not going to have enough of
1358500	1361500	if you just dive right into it, and that's safety training.
1361500	1364500	Because film sets are frickin' dangerous.
1364500	1367500	You have a lot of people moving around,
1367500	1370500	you have a lot of heavy equipment, you have a lot of specialized equipment.
1370500	1373500	If it's anything approaching a big set,
1373500	1376500	then you're talking about really, really high voltages.
1376500	1379500	There are a ton of safety concerns,
1379500	1382500	and when you run into these non-union shoots
1382500	1385500	where it's just some fly-by-night company...
1385500	1388500	Someone literally, yeah, that girl in Georgia...
1388500	1391500	Yeah, which is exactly where it's going.
1391500	1394500	Literally died.
1394500	1397500	This fly-by-night production company's like,
1397500	1400500	hey, we're going to make this movie,
1400500	1403500	and so they got a whole bunch of teenagers and 20-somethings
1403500	1406500	who wanted to be in movies, and they had a couple trained people,
1406500	1409500	and Sarah was one of them, and she was first camera assistant,
1409500	1412500	and they had this setup where they were doing this dream sequence
1412500	1415500	out on the train tracks,
1415500	1418500	and the production coordinator had called the rail office
1418500	1421500	to try and book the track,
1421500	1424500	and they had been rejected
1424500	1427500	because there was a train going through,
1427500	1430500	like there was a shipment going through at that time,
1430500	1433500	and the producer, who was also the director,
1433500	1436500	was like, well, screw it.
1436500	1439500	We're going to be maverick filmmakers.
1439500	1442500	We're just going to go rogue
1442500	1445500	and do it anyway,
1445500	1448500	and a woman lost her life.
1448500	1451500	There are other issues to consider,
1451500	1454500	like race and gender issues and discriminations,
1454500	1457500	which we're not going to get into now.
1457500	1460500	That's, I think, maybe a topic for another day.
1461500	1464500	It's difficult to say is it worth it,
1464500	1467500	because it depends on what you want,
1467500	1470500	and it's such a wide spectrum of questions to ask,
1470500	1473500	whether you want to get into a vocational school
1473500	1476500	so you can learn a trade and then just make a living,
1476500	1479500	or if you want to be a big-name film person
1479500	1482500	and go to all the fun film festivals every year
1482500	1485500	or be a professor or something.
1485500	1488500	I think a lot of it really does come down to cost,
1489500	1492500	because whenever I get asked the question,
1492500	1495500	is it worth it?
1495500	1498500	In my case, I kind of go back and forth
1498500	1501500	because it all comes down to that debt,
1501500	1504500	because if I didn't go into debt,
1504500	1507500	or if I'd even gone into less debt,
1507500	1510500	like even half the debt I'm in now,
1510500	1513500	I would say, yeah, it was totally worth it,
1513500	1516500	but to be $10,000 more in debt now
1516500	1519500	except for the fact that the school
1519500	1522500	doesn't really offer aid to grad students
1522500	1525500	because it's the top film school,
1525500	1528500	and if you don't want to pay it,
1528500	1531500	there's 200 people in line behind you
1531500	1534500	that will kill to be in your place.
1534500	1537500	That's part of the real challenge with the big ones,
1537500	1540500	is it's almost like gambling.
1540500	1543500	Yeah, you are kind of getting potential access
1543500	1546500	to a spotlight career really quickly,
1549500	1552500	but if you're not the lucky one...
1555500	1558500	I mean, even if you are the lucky one,
1558500	1561500	it's a thing.
1561500	1564500	The only exception I know is Ryan Coogler.
1564500	1567500	Even the other people I know that are super doing really well
1567500	1570500	are still in a lot of debt.
1570500	1573500	If you are the one lucky one,
1573500	1576500	then it's still going to take a while to pay that down.
1576500	1579500	It's true of all grad schools.
1579500	1582500	If you're $60,000, $200,000 in debt,
1582500	1585500	that will just follow you around
1585500	1588500	and it will affect your life decisions.
1588500	1591500	One important thing, if you pay your minimum payments
1591500	1594500	every year for 25 years, if you have federal loans,
1594500	1597500	they will get forgiven at the end of that period.
1597500	1600500	That is true.
1600500	1603500	On the flip side, I can think of very few downsides
1603500	1606500	to taking the vocational route.
1606500	1609500	Yes, it's not going to...
1609500	1612500	You have a much lower chance of being a star,
1612500	1615500	but you can make a living
1615500	1618500	working in movies or working in related fields.
1621500	1624500	It's not the easiest life,
1624500	1627500	it's not the easiest living,
1627500	1630500	there is a lot of uncertainty.
1630500	1633500	But at the same time,
1633500	1636500	it's doable.
1636500	1639500	It's totally doable.
1639500	1642500	The pay-in, particularly for a vocational school,
1642500	1645500	if it's a state school or a federally funded school...
1645500	1648500	Or even if you get financial aid,
1648500	1651500	which I hear happens at the school that shall not be named.
1651500	1654500	If it's two years
1654500	1657500	and it's only going to cost you $10,000 in tuition,
1657500	1660500	then...
1660500	1663500	Totally worth it.
1663500	1666500	If you're young and you don't have any debt,
1666500	1669500	$10,000 might seem like a lot.
1669500	1672500	It's amazing the difference between $10,000 and $60,000.
1672500	1675500	I had paid for most of it,
1675500	1678500	so by the time I was done,
1678500	1681500	I was in debt and I got a film-related job
1681500	1684500	right out of school,
1684500	1687500	and I was debt-free by Christmas.
1687500	1690500	I feel like I could be debt-free
1690500	1693500	solely based on my freelance income,
1693500	1696500	YouTube income, and Patreon income.
1696500	1699500	I could be debt-free...
1699500	1702500	2030.
1702500	1705500	14 years?
1705500	1708500	What is the amount of student debt interest
1708500	1711500	you can write off every year?
1711500	1714500	It is $2,500.
1714500	1717500	I accrue about $4,000.
1717500	1720500	America!
1720500	1723500	I think that's a good place to end,
1723500	1726500	and then I'm going to jump on a plane
1726500	1729500	and go back to the land of socialized medicine
1729500	1732500	and mitigated student debt.
1732500	1735500	I'm very wealthy.
