0	3640	It's a beautiful day at Disney World's Hollywood Studios.
3640	8960	The rockin' rollercoaster is rockin', a sea of Mickey ears flows through the park,
8960	13640	and that Beauty and the Beast live show is mysteriously still running.
13640	16160	And it is here at Disney World's Hollywood Studios.
16160	23200	Every hour on the hour, a cavalcade of stormtroopers begins its march down the centrally located Hollywood Boulevard.
23200	26200	Led by Captain Phasma to the First Order march theme,
26200	31800	while hundreds of onlookers take pictures and admire what the Walt Disney World website describes as
31800	37000	a daunting demonstration of the First Order's obedience and strength.
37000	38800	Yikes.
38800	44400	But for realsies, the march of the First Order is quite literally framed as a recruitment seminar.
44400	46400	You know, for kids.
46400	51600	And it's moments like these when you stop and notice the countless pieces of stormtrooper merchandise,
51600	55400	both for sale and being worn around the park by adults and kids alike,
55400	57200	and one has to wonder,
57200	61200	how is it that we've arrived at a point where one of the largest multimedia conglomerates in the world
61200	65200	can create a show at one of the world's most popular theme parks that is, in effect,
65200	68200	cosplay fascism?
68200	70200	Because they are fascists, right?
70200	73200	I mean, they look like fascists, they talk like fascists.
73200	77200	As the last day of the Republic!
77200	79200	They have a fascist ideol-
79200	81200	Wait, actually, on second thought, do they?
81200	85200	Does the First Order have any ideology?
86000	88000	That's right.
88000	93000	We're here to try to figure out the driving ideology of the First Order.
93000	95000	I mean, what did you expect?
105000	110000	I'm not saying putting space fascists on Rice Krispie treats is, like, bad or immoral.
110000	113000	I'm just saying it's interesting how Disney has pushed their marketing of
113800	116800	to be as evocative of real-world fascist movements as possible,
116800	124800	while not so evocative that people start casting a side-eye at putting stormtroopers on cuddly throws.
124800	127800	But despite being fiction, the First Order is based, more than anything,
127800	130800	on history's most famous group of fascists.
130800	132800	And that kind of begs the question,
132800	137800	can you import the aesthetics of fascism while kind of tabling fascist ideology
137800	140800	so that you can sell Captain Phasma Christmas ornaments?
141600	143600	I mean, the answer is obviously yes,
143600	145600	but we're gonna go ahead and make a thing out of it anyway.
147600	149600	It's common knowledge that the Star Wars universe
149600	152600	was based heavily on drawing from a 30-year cycle of nostalgia
152600	156600	and had two heavily aesthetic influences pulled from that particular past.
156600	159600	Spacey fantasy serials like Flash Gordon,
159600	163600	which George Lucas originally wanted to adapt for film but couldn't obtain the rights for,
163600	165600	and World War II imagery.
165600	169600	But there is a tendency in nerd critical spaces
169600	173400	for people to get kind of defensive when you start talking about the fact that
173400	178400	Star Wars was a little extremely inspired by World War II
178400	181400	and this is known and has been known since it was incepted.
181400	185400	But I look forward to an interesting and robust conversation in the comments below.
185400	189400	Ring that bell so it'll do whatever it is that it's supposed to do.
189400	190400	Like, share, and subscribe.
190400	195400	Leave me a comment if you think that Kylo Ren is the sexiest space Nazi in the galaxy.
195400	197400	Just kidding, I don't read the comments.
198200	200200	If there is one aesthetic influence on the Empire
200200	202200	and, by extension, their descendants, the First Order,
202200	204200	it was the Third Reich.
204200	207200	This is a convenient visual shorthand, especially for audiences in the 70s
207200	211200	for whom the horrors of Nazi Germany were close enough that this was simple and effective
211200	214200	but not so recent that it's, you know, too real.
214200	218200	To quote the recently passed costume designer for the original Star Wars trilogy,
218200	219200	John Mollo,
219200	221200	Lucas wanted the imperial people to look efficient,
221200	223200	totalitarian, fascist,
223200	227200	and the rebels, the goodies, to look something out of a Western or a U.S. Marines.
227200	228200	He said,
228200	231200	You've got a very difficult job here because I don't want anyone to notice the costumes.
231200	234200	They've got to look familiar, but not familiar at the same time.
234200	236200	But in general, the Nazi aesthetic,
236200	239200	from the uniform tailoring to the color schemes to the headgear,
239200	242200	seems pretty obvious as a source of inspiration.
242200	246200	It's even there in the way the actors playing the Empire characters approached their roles.
246200	250200	To quote actor Kenneth Colley, who played Admiral Peet in the original trilogy,
250200	253200	Obviously they were going on some sort of design for Darth Vader's men.
253200	256200	There were echoes of the Gestapo, or at least fascism in there,
256200	258200	and that was how I approached the role.
258200	262200	And this doesn't even begin to dive into George Lucas' thoughts when it comes to the prequels,
262200	265200	where he describes the rise of the emperor in Revenge of the Sith as,
265200	269200	How do you turn over democracy to a tyrant with applause?
269200	271200	Not with a coup, but with applause.
271200	274200	That is the story of Caesar, Napoleon, and Hitler.
274200	278200	So, deliberate reference to fascist iconography is there in all Star Wars movies.
278200	282200	But if we're talking about the prevalence of Nazi imagery in popular culture,
282200	284200	guess we need to talk about our girl.
284200	286200	Turn down for what?
286200	288200	Wait, wait, no, no, no, no, no, you're a f***ing fascist.
288200	290200	You don't deserve turn down for what?
290200	293200	Look at this photograph
293200	295200	Okay, that's better.
295200	298200	It's hard to talk about the history of film, let alone the Star Wars franchise,
298200	301200	without eventually discussing the work of director Leni Riefenstahl,
301200	306200	whose most notable works were her propaganda films made in celebration of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party,
306200	309200	Triumph of the Will, and Olympia.
309200	311200	Writer and activist Susan Sontag once wrote that
311200	315200	Riefenstahl is the only major artist who was completely identified with the Nazi era
315200	319200	and whose work, not only during the Third Reich, but 30 years after its fall,
319200	322200	has consistently illustrated some of the themes of fascist aesthetics.
322200	325200	And while the topic of Leni Riefenstahl and the impact of her work
325200	327200	could easily fill a much longer video than this,
327200	331200	we are keeping it simple for more on Riefenstahl's influence on Triumph of the Will,
331200	333200	see Dan Olson's video on the same subject.
333200	336200	Suffice to say that, aside from the whole Nazi propaganda thing,
336200	338200	Leni Riefenstahl is notable for,
338200	339200	DEBATABLY,
339200	343200	pioneering filming techniques, editing, and striking sweeping shots,
343200	345200	in particular, for documentary film.
345200	349200	But more relevant here is the iconography she developed to show the power of the Reich
349200	352200	that influences depictions of Nazis and fascists to this day.
352200	356200	The iconography that we associate with Nazis isn't from historical documents
356200	359200	or from, you know, non-Nazi historians.
359200	361200	It's from Nazi propaganda.
361200	364200	Specifically, this Nazi propaganda.
364200	367200	And that is Leni Riefenstahl's legacy.
367200	370200	So when we see the aesthetics of the Empire and the First Order,
370200	372200	they aren't inspired by the Third Reich,
372200	375200	but by Nazi propaganda about the Third Reich.
375200	377200	So, it's the Cold War,
377200	380200	Leni Riefenstahl's been acquitted of any war crimes,
380200	382200	despite her films Valley to the Nazi Party
382200	384200	and propaganda and her friendship with Hitler and Goebbels.
384200	388200	This narrative of Leni Riefenstahl as an auteur who just, you know,
388200	391200	happened to make films for a monstrous regime emerges,
391200	394200	and a renewed international interest in her work accompanies it
394200	398200	and reaches a whole new generation of film directors.
398200	399200	Ahem.
399200	402200	So you see these shots of marching soldiers,
402200	404200	the way villains are filmed from slightly below,
404200	407200	and this very direct call to a shot in Triumph of the Will,
407200	410200	and the influence is surprisingly overt.
410200	412200	So this isn't oops, accidental Nazis.
412200	416200	The call to fascist iconography is deliberate in all three trilogies.
416200	418200	But here's the thing about fascism.
418200	420200	It usually rises for a reason.
420200	422200	You know, never a good reason,
422200	425200	but there's always a call to arms, if you will.
425200	427200	An ideology.
434200	436200	If we're gonna try to discern the ideology of the First Order,
436200	438200	it's only fair that we do the same for the Empire.
438200	443200	So what did the Empire actually stand for in the original trilogy, if anything?
443200	446200	Well, the original trilogy never dives too deeply into it,
446200	448200	and both the good guys and the bad guys play into larger,
448200	451200	non-specific tropes in demonstrating their moral alignment,
451200	454200	i.e. the flippant genocide of all of Alderaan by the Death Star.
454200	459200	The Empire had no real conclusive ideology behind their regime in the original trilogy.
459200	464200	Now you see that evil will always triumph because good is dumb.
464200	467200	And part of this is because they don't need to.
467200	469200	It has to do with where we enter the story,
469200	471200	and this is one strength the original trilogy has.
471200	473200	And yes, actually, even the prequels.
473200	476200	I'm a person and my name is Anakin.
476200	477200	Bear with me.
477200	479200	When we first meet Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia,
479200	482200	we are entering a universe where the Empire is not only in power,
482200	484200	it is the only power.
484200	486200	They've been in power since before Luke was born,
486200	489200	and this is the only power structure young Luke has ever known,
489200	492200	and therefore the only one we, the audience, know.
492200	494200	Moreover, the story starts on Tatooine,
494200	496200	a shithole of a planet that nobody cares about.
496200	498200	I have no need for a protocol droid.
498200	501200	Of course you haven't, sir. Not in an environment such as this.
501200	503200	Day-to-day life is kind of impacted,
503200	505200	Luke understands that the Empire is unjust,
505200	507200	but it's not the worst ever.
507200	509200	You know, the Empire more or less leaves people alone
509200	511200	unless they rabble-rouse, you know,
511200	513200	like most totalitarian states in peacetime.
513200	515200	Luke isn't really even keen on joining the rebellion
515200	517200	until his family gets torched.
517200	519200	Meanwhile, with the prequels, again hot mess though they are,
519200	522200	the power structure in place does make sense, kind of.
522200	525200	And though it requires an absurd level of 13-dimensional chess
525200	527200	on the part of Palpatine,
527200	529200	it's clear what the power structure is,
529200	532200	what it stands for, and how the Senate is duped by fear
532200	534200	into giving themselves over to fascism
534200	537200	as evidenced by the one good line in all three movies.
537200	540200	So this is how liberty dies,
540200	542200	with thunderous applause.
542200	544200	Palpatine manufactured a crisis,
544200	545200	exploited fear,
545200	547200	somebody burned down the Reichstag,
547200	548200	and wouldn't you know it,
548200	551200	told me I was Führer.
551200	555200	But in the new trilogy, we have the First Order fighting against the Resistance,
555200	558200	who is being backed by the semi-neutral New Republic,
558200	560200	a confusing mess of a power structure
560200	563200	that itself gets blown up halfway through The Force Awakens...
563200	566200	before we even meet them or know who they are anyway.
566200	569200	A similar plot point to the destruction of the New Republic
569200	571200	happens in A New Hope.
571200	573200	Grand Moff Tarkin orders the destruction of a planet
573200	575200	that we've never seen or been to,
575200	578200	but it works more effectively in A New Hope for one simple reason.
578200	581200	It's Leia's home planet, and she make a sad face.
581200	584200	Secondly, it's clear why the Empire destroys Alderaan.
584200	587200	Leia is becoming a figurehead in this nascent rebellion,
587200	588200	and it's her home planet.
588200	591200	Moreover, this is a common tactic in totalitarian states.
591200	594200	Big displays of force to keep the folk in line.
594200	596200	The Republic in The Force Awakens,
596200	598200	yes, there was a deleted scene where they sent a character,
598200	599200	we know there, but it was deleted,
599200	601200	and either way, none of the main characters
601200	603200	have any connection to the Hosnian system.
603200	604200	Point is, from a narrative standpoint,
604200	606200	the ideology of the First Order
606200	609200	and why they do what they do matters more in The Force Awakens
609200	612200	because the First Order isn't really in power yet.
612200	614200	They're more of a rogue state,
614200	617200	and therefore their task is to rally people to their side with rhetoric,
617200	618200	or invade Poland.
618200	619200	But they don't.
619200	622200	Apparently they just steal babies and raise them under totalitarianism,
622200	626200	but don't worry, these kidnapped babies shake their conditioning pretty quickly.
626200	627200	F.N., huh?
627200	629200	Finn, I'm gonna call you Finn, is that alright?
629200	630200	Finn.
630200	632200	Yeah, Finn, I like that!
632200	635200	My point is the new trilogy incorporates a lot of stuff
635200	638200	that is evocative of real-world atrocities...
638200	642200	without really thinking through the implications of these inclusions,
642200	644200	or the real-world connotations.
644200	647200	They don't destroy the New Republic as a means of maintaining control,
647200	650200	it's more of a we-demand-to-be-taken-seriously.
650200	653200	One that creates a power vacuum that they have ostensibly
653200	656200	exploited and filmed by the time of The Last Jedi,
656200	659200	I guess... it's not really clear.
659200	661200	Who is driving? Bear is driving.
661200	664200	And the destruction of the Hosnian system works from a dramatic standpoint,
664200	666200	but it doesn't really work from a narrative standpoint.
666200	669200	It doesn't really make a whole lot of sense in The Force Awakens,
669200	672200	which itself has a bad habit of aping plot points from A New Hope
672200	675200	without importing that all-important context.
675200	679200	The Empire was in total control, and keeping the rabble-rousers in line,
679200	682200	the First Order is a rogue state who demands to be taken seriously.
682200	684200	But let's take for granted that this is all deliberate.
684200	687200	There are two things that The Last Jedi introduced which kind of begs
687200	690200	one to consider the mechanics of the universe.
690200	692200	A. War profiteering.
692200	696200	There's only one business in the galaxy that'll get you this rich.
696200	697200	War?
697200	700200	Selling weapons to the First Order.
700200	703200	B. An implied caste system with exploited labor,
703200	705200	and child labor at the bottom.
705200	707200	So it's clear what our heroes are fighting for,
707200	710200	but if the light rises, so too must the dark.
710200	713200	In other words, what is the First Order fighting for?
713200	715200	You know, besides...
725200	727200	Fascism has always been difficult to define as an ideology
727200	731200	compared to, say, Nazism, itself a form of fascism.
731200	733200	Ask the average person to define fascism,
733200	736200	and they probably will not do it accurately,
736200	738200	yet we still love using fascist as an insult.
738200	740200	People don't really know what fascism is,
740200	742200	but they know what it looks like,
742200	746200	or is imagined to look like, thanks in part to movies like Star Wars.
746200	749200	Umberto Eco's 1995 essay, Ur-Fascism,
749200	751200	which you should go read right now,
751200	754200	perhaps captures the elusive nature of fascism the most succinctly.
754200	757200	According to Eco, the fascist game can be played in many forms,
757200	759200	and the name of the game does not change.
759200	761200	Fascism does not belong to one nationality,
761200	763200	nor religion, nor period of time.
763200	767200	However, Eco does outline 14 bullet points in defining fascism.
767200	768200	I'm not going to list all of them,
768200	771200	but stick to the ones which are relevant with regard to the First Order.
771200	774200	An emphasis on, read, cult of tradition.
774200	777200	Exploiting a natural fear of difference.
777200	781200	Disagreement is a sign of diversity, and diversity bad.
781200	785200	There is no struggle for life, but rather, life is lived for struggle.
785200	788200	And in such a perspective, everyone is educated to become a hero.
788200	791200	In every mythology, the hero is an exceptional being,
791200	794200	but in Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm.
794200	797200	This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.
797200	801200	So, on second thought, maybe this indefinable fluid ideology
801200	803200	of the First Order speaks to it being fascist,
803200	805200	in spite of the fact that we literally know nothing
805200	807200	about what it is the First Order actually wants.
807200	809200	You know, besides...
818200	821200	Oh, Kylo Ren, you quilt of rage.
821200	823200	You amalgam of every bad boy cliche,
823200	827200	all wrapped in a selfish ideology and scaffolded by space fascists.
827200	830200	Save him, Rey. You know you want to.
830200	832200	It isn't too late.
832200	833200	Save him.
833200	835200	So, Kylo Ren is the epitome of everything that is fascist,
835200	837200	but fanfic-y about the First Order.
837200	840200	Kylo does not have an ideology outside of the ideology of the self,
840200	843200	which puts him somewhat at odds with real world fascists.
843200	847200	You can't have a cult of heroism if you don't particularly care about being a hero.
847200	850200	If you've ever run into any identitarians,
850200	854200	you may note that when they do tend to fall to the dark side,
854200	857200	they also tend to adhere to a certain set of ideologies,
857200	859200	usually having to do with race, nationality,
859200	862200	protecting the people from some amorphous foreign threat,
862200	864200	and white women being obedient broodmares.
864200	868200	But all it really does is give a sense of purpose to this sort of amorphous rage
868200	872200	felt by the Ur-fascist, which the fascist power structure can now exploit.
872200	876200	The relationship between Snoke and Kylo Ren actually illustrates this really well.
876200	880200	This is also why Kylo Ren disposes of Snoke so easily.
880200	882200	His ideology doesn't matter.
882200	886200	So obviously the First Order doesn't need to mirror real world fascists
886200	889200	in order to have their own brand of fictional fascism.
889200	895200	Maybe instead of the cultural Marxists masterminding multiculturalism,
895200	898200	they're scapegoating aliens or something.
898200	900200	Those goddamn wookies are taking our jobs!
900200	903200	A scapegoat for some social problem, real or imagined,
903200	906200	is integral for the rise of fascist power structures.
906200	909200	That undercurrent is there in some of the extended universe books,
909200	911200	particularly the original Thrawn trilogy.
911200	913200	But those books are no longer considered canon,
913200	917200	and that still doesn't shed any light on what the First Order wants or believes.
917200	921200	The closest in this new canon we've seen to actually exploring the ideology of the First Order
921200	923200	was the book Bloodline by Claudia Gray,
923200	927200	wherein the divide in the new liberal republic is between the populists and the centrists.
927200	931200	And in the Star Wars universe, those words do not mean at all what they mean in our universe.
931200	933200	So this gets really confusing.
933200	936200	The pre-First Order political divide in the Star Wars universe
936200	941200	is more akin to the political divide between Alexander Hamilton's Federalists
941200	944200	and Thomas Jefferson's Democratic Republicans,
944200	948200	with Princess Leia on the Jeffersonian side as a populist.
948200	951200	Again, this term does not mean what it means in our political discourse,
951200	952200	and it's really confusing.
952200	955200	And with her on-again, off-again rival Ranson Kvsterfo
955200	959200	on the Hamiltonian side as a centrist.
959200	961200	He wants a stronger central government.
961200	963200	I wish they had chosen different names.
963200	965200	The populists are more like a states' rights crowd.
965200	967200	They want the planets to be more autonomous,
967200	970200	and the centrists favor a stronger central government.
970200	975200	And no one realizes that a fair chunk of the Hamiltonian centrists are actually closet fascists.
975200	978200	And like with the prequels, there is some mundane conflict
978200	981200	that the fascists can exploit in order to consolidate power.
981200	984200	The point I'm making here is that it is actually kind of difficult
984200	988200	to demonstrate how fascist ideologies gain traction in society and fiction.
988200	991200	But with all that said, we don't learn a whole lot about their ideology
991200	994200	other than the typical Star Wars powers for powers' sake
994200	997200	and, you know, hate and dark side and all that.
997200	1000200	In part because said ideology could be hashtag too real
1000200	1003200	and read as flippant or offensive,
1003200	1006200	but also because the underlying ideology is never logical.
1006200	1009200	Revenge of the Sith actually demonstrates that really well.
1009200	1012200	So if you're going to try and make, like, pajamas and plush toys
1012200	1014200	out of your space fascists,
1014200	1018200	it does make sense that you'd probably just want to skip all that
1018200	1021200	and just get right to the totalitarianism part.
1021200	1023200	So let's go back to Kylo Ren.
1023200	1027200	What was it about the ideology of the First Order that appeals to him?
1027200	1029200	Was he worried about alien multiculturalism
1029200	1032200	leading to the eventual demise of the human race?
1032200	1034200	No, he's disappointed in his father.
1034200	1036200	And his father figure.
1036200	1039200	I guess Luke made a boo-boo and thought about killing him for a second,
1039200	1044200	but Kylo Ren didn't join the fascists because he was seduced by fascist ideology.
1044200	1048200	Kylo Ren is a fascist figurehead out of spite.
1048200	1051200	The Supreme Leader is dead.
1053200	1056200	Long live the Supreme Leader.
1056200	1060200	The Last Jedi shows that Kylo Ren doesn't really care about enriching any side
1060200	1062200	other than whatever side will best empower him,
1062200	1066200	which goes to show that he has no ideology to defend because he doesn't care
1066200	1069200	and possibly because there is no ideology to defend.
1069200	1072200	I think this also speaks to some of the disappointment with Snoke.
1072200	1075200	The Emperor was good at stoking fear and exploiting it,
1075200	1078200	a common authoritarian tactic, but Snoke?
1078200	1080200	What does he even want?
1080200	1082200	The Supreme Leader is wise.
1082200	1084200	Snoke is using you for your power.
1084200	1089200	The seed of the Jedi Order lives.
1089200	1092200	As long as it does, hope lives.
1092200	1095200	In the end, Kylo Ren is willing to dispatch with his old master.
1095200	1097200	Basically on a whim.
1097200	1100200	Because Snoke's ideology is not worth fighting for.
1100200	1102200	Because it doesn't exist.
1102200	1103200	Routing around back to Umberto Eco,
1103200	1107200	one concept of fascism is that it idealizes this concept of some savior,
1107200	1110200	or what Eco refers to as the Ur-Fascist hero.
1110200	1111200	Says Eco,
1111200	1115200	In non-fascist societies, the lay public is told that death is unpleasant,
1115200	1117200	must be faced with dignity,
1117200	1120200	believers are told that it is the painful way to reach a supernatural happiness.
1120200	1123200	By contrast, the Ur-Fascist hero craves heroic death,
1123200	1126200	advertised as the best reward for a heroic life.
1126200	1128200	The Ur-Fascist hero is impatient to die.
1128200	1132200	In his impatience, he more frequently sends other people to death.
1132200	1135200	Since permanent war and heroism are difficult games to play,
1135200	1138200	the Ur-Fascist transfer his will to power to sexual matters.
1138200	1140200	This is the origin of machismo,
1140200	1142200	which implies both disdain for women
1142200	1145200	and intolerance and condemnation of non-standard sexual habits,
1145200	1147200	from chastity to homosexuality.
1147200	1149200	Since even sex is a difficult game to play,
1149200	1152200	the Ur-Fascist hero tends to play with weapons,
1152200	1155200	doing so becomes an ersatzphalic exercise.
1162200	1164200	So, before Luke's oopsie daisy,
1164200	1166200	Kylo Ren is essentially the proto-fascist Klay,
1166200	1169200	the raw anger and resentment before it has been given a target.
1169200	1172200	This is all part and parcel with the actual narrative trajectory of the trilogy,
1172200	1175200	where Ben is savable in part because he lacks ideology.
1175200	1179200	However, even in that, he still embodies Eco's description of Ur-Fascism
1179200	1182200	as a non-ideology of action for action's sake.
1182200	1184200	So, what does the First Order want?
1184200	1186200	It could be that the movies go out of their way not to say
1186200	1188200	because then it would be hashtag too real
1188200	1191200	and we can't put Captain Phasma on t-shirts.
1191200	1193200	Or, and I'm about to give Disney way too much credit,
1193200	1196200	there could be a deeper understanding at play
1196200	1199200	that the ideology doesn't actually matter,
1199200	1201200	and that's kind of the point.
1201200	1206200	Perhaps the error is in trying to apply logic to an inherently non-logical ideology.
1206200	1207200	Again, according to Eco,
1207200	1210200	Nazism had a really clear-cut ideology,
1210200	1213200	but concurrent Italian fascism under Mussolini did not,
1213200	1216200	and the First Order also borrows heavily from those aesthetics.
1216200	1217200	In Eco's words,
1217200	1220200	Contrary to common opinion, fascism in Italy had no special philosophy.
1220200	1222200	Mussolini did not have any philosophy.
1222200	1224200	He only had rhetoric.
1224200	1227200	In his early anti-clerical years, according to a likely legend,
1227200	1230200	he once asked God in order to prove his existence to strike him down on the spot.
1230200	1233200	Later, Mussolini always cited the name of God in his speeches
1233200	1236200	and did not mind being called the Man of Providence.
1236200	1239200	So on the one hand, it's not unfair to point out that with fascism,
1239200	1241200	ideology is only a means to an end,
1241200	1244200	and the end is the quashing of dissent, stamping out diversity,
1244200	1247200	heroes in heroic death, and strict totalitarianism.
1247200	1249200	Star Wars has always understood that much.
1249200	1252200	Bad guys employing horrible acts we see mirrored in the real world,
1252200	1255200	but shifting them just far enough from real-world atrocities
1255200	1259200	that we can merchandise the villains almost as much as we merchandise the heroes.
1259200	1261200	We see this in the likes of Thanos as well.
1261200	1263200	He's a genocidal monster, sure,
1263200	1267200	but, you know, at least he goes by random coin toss for who he kills.
1267200	1269200	Some of the time.
1269200	1274200	See, he doesn't target specific ethnic groups like real genociders do.
1274200	1276200	He's an egalitarian genocidal monster.
1276200	1278200	He's complex.
1278200	1280200	To quote Eco again,
1294200	1297200	all the elements of any later form of totalitarianism.
1297200	1300200	On the contrary, fascism had no quintessence.
1300200	1302200	Fascism was a fuzzy totalitarianism,
1302200	1305200	a collage of different philosophical and political ideas,
1305200	1307200	a beehive of contradictions.
1307200	1309200	So it could be that they're being lazy and playing it safe
1309200	1311200	so they can sell more stuff, but who knows?
1311200	1314200	Maybe deep down, Disney understands this.
1314200	1317200	And that's what makes this family-friendly type of fascism
1317200	1320200	so easy to brand and to sell.
1321200	1324200	So... who cares?
1324200	1329200	Part of the problem with applying even a very modest set of academic theory
1329200	1335200	to a pop culture thing is then we get some hand wringing over the inevitable moralizing
1335200	1337200	and it also begs the question,
1337200	1339200	well, what do you want me to do about it?
1339200	1342200	Not own Darth Vader pajamas?
1342200	1347200	When that is not the point, the point is to examine the context of the thing,
1347200	1350200	and demand that Disney make their villains less fashy.
1350200	1355200	Fictional villains always draw inspiration from real-world bad things,
1355200	1357200	and that's fine.
1357200	1362200	That said, I do think it's worth examining how the portrayal of the dark side has changed
1362200	1364200	since Disney got a hold of it,
1364200	1368200	that the filmmakers decided to lean into the fashy imagery rather than away from it.
1368200	1375200	And yes, Star Wars merchandising has always, always heavily relied on marketing bad characters
1375200	1379200	like Darth Vader and Boba Fett in order to help earn that sweet green.
1379200	1383200	But the significance of iconography can shift over time,
1383200	1389200	and I do think it's worth examining the difference of selling cute, fashy bad guy characters in 1977
1389200	1392200	and selling the same in 2018.
1405200	1413200	Thanks for watching!
