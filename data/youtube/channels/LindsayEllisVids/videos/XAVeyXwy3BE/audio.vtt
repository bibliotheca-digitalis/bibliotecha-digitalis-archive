00:00.000 --> 00:03.640
It's a beautiful day at Disney World's Hollywood Studios.

00:03.640 --> 00:08.960
The rockin' rollercoaster is rockin', a sea of Mickey ears flows through the park,

00:08.960 --> 00:13.640
and that Beauty and the Beast live show is mysteriously still running.

00:13.640 --> 00:16.160
And it is here at Disney World's Hollywood Studios.

00:16.160 --> 00:23.200
Every hour on the hour, a cavalcade of stormtroopers begins its march down the centrally located Hollywood Boulevard.

00:23.200 --> 00:26.200
Led by Captain Phasma to the First Order march theme,

00:26.200 --> 00:31.800
while hundreds of onlookers take pictures and admire what the Walt Disney World website describes as

00:31.800 --> 00:37.000
a daunting demonstration of the First Order's obedience and strength.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.800
Yikes.

00:38.800 --> 00:44.400
But for realsies, the march of the First Order is quite literally framed as a recruitment seminar.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.400
You know, for kids.

00:46.400 --> 00:51.600
And it's moments like these when you stop and notice the countless pieces of stormtrooper merchandise,

00:51.600 --> 00:55.400
both for sale and being worn around the park by adults and kids alike,

00:55.400 --> 00:57.200
and one has to wonder,

00:57.200 --> 01:01.200
how is it that we've arrived at a point where one of the largest multimedia conglomerates in the world

01:01.200 --> 01:05.200
can create a show at one of the world's most popular theme parks that is, in effect,

01:05.200 --> 01:08.200
cosplay fascism?

01:08.200 --> 01:10.200
Because they are fascists, right?

01:10.200 --> 01:13.200
I mean, they look like fascists, they talk like fascists.

01:13.200 --> 01:17.200
As the last day of the Republic!

01:17.200 --> 01:19.200
They have a fascist ideol-

01:19.200 --> 01:21.200
Wait, actually, on second thought, do they?

01:21.200 --> 01:25.200
Does the First Order have any ideology?

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
That's right.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
We're here to try to figure out the driving ideology of the First Order.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
I mean, what did you expect?

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
I'm not saying putting space fascists on Rice Krispie treats is, like, bad or immoral.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
I'm just saying it's interesting how Disney has pushed their marketing of

01:53.800 --> 01:56.800
to be as evocative of real-world fascist movements as possible,

01:56.800 --> 02:04.800
while not so evocative that people start casting a side-eye at putting stormtroopers on cuddly throws.

02:04.800 --> 02:07.800
But despite being fiction, the First Order is based, more than anything,

02:07.800 --> 02:10.800
on history's most famous group of fascists.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.800
And that kind of begs the question,

02:12.800 --> 02:17.800
can you import the aesthetics of fascism while kind of tabling fascist ideology

02:17.800 --> 02:20.800
so that you can sell Captain Phasma Christmas ornaments?

02:21.600 --> 02:23.600
I mean, the answer is obviously yes,

02:23.600 --> 02:25.600
but we're gonna go ahead and make a thing out of it anyway.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.600
It's common knowledge that the Star Wars universe

02:29.600 --> 02:32.600
was based heavily on drawing from a 30-year cycle of nostalgia

02:32.600 --> 02:36.600
and had two heavily aesthetic influences pulled from that particular past.

02:36.600 --> 02:39.600
Spacey fantasy serials like Flash Gordon,

02:39.600 --> 02:43.600
which George Lucas originally wanted to adapt for film but couldn't obtain the rights for,

02:43.600 --> 02:45.600
and World War II imagery.

02:45.600 --> 02:49.600
But there is a tendency in nerd critical spaces

02:49.600 --> 02:53.400
for people to get kind of defensive when you start talking about the fact that

02:53.400 --> 02:58.400
Star Wars was a little extremely inspired by World War II

02:58.400 --> 03:01.400
and this is known and has been known since it was incepted.

03:01.400 --> 03:05.400
But I look forward to an interesting and robust conversation in the comments below.

03:05.400 --> 03:09.400
Ring that bell so it'll do whatever it is that it's supposed to do.

03:09.400 --> 03:10.400
Like, share, and subscribe.

03:10.400 --> 03:15.400
Leave me a comment if you think that Kylo Ren is the sexiest space Nazi in the galaxy.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.400
Just kidding, I don't read the comments.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.200
If there is one aesthetic influence on the Empire

03:20.200 --> 03:22.200
and, by extension, their descendants, the First Order,

03:22.200 --> 03:24.200
it was the Third Reich.

03:24.200 --> 03:27.200
This is a convenient visual shorthand, especially for audiences in the 70s

03:27.200 --> 03:31.200
for whom the horrors of Nazi Germany were close enough that this was simple and effective

03:31.200 --> 03:34.200
but not so recent that it's, you know, too real.

03:34.200 --> 03:38.200
To quote the recently passed costume designer for the original Star Wars trilogy,

03:38.200 --> 03:39.200
John Mollo,

03:39.200 --> 03:41.200
Lucas wanted the imperial people to look efficient,

03:41.200 --> 03:43.200
totalitarian, fascist,

03:43.200 --> 03:47.200
and the rebels, the goodies, to look something out of a Western or a U.S. Marines.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.200
He said,

03:48.200 --> 03:51.200
You've got a very difficult job here because I don't want anyone to notice the costumes.

03:51.200 --> 03:54.200
They've got to look familiar, but not familiar at the same time.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.200
But in general, the Nazi aesthetic,

03:56.200 --> 03:59.200
from the uniform tailoring to the color schemes to the headgear,

03:59.200 --> 04:02.200
seems pretty obvious as a source of inspiration.

04:02.200 --> 04:06.200
It's even there in the way the actors playing the Empire characters approached their roles.

04:06.200 --> 04:10.200
To quote actor Kenneth Colley, who played Admiral Peet in the original trilogy,

04:10.200 --> 04:13.200
Obviously they were going on some sort of design for Darth Vader's men.

04:13.200 --> 04:16.200
There were echoes of the Gestapo, or at least fascism in there,

04:16.200 --> 04:18.200
and that was how I approached the role.

04:18.200 --> 04:22.200
And this doesn't even begin to dive into George Lucas' thoughts when it comes to the prequels,

04:22.200 --> 04:25.200
where he describes the rise of the emperor in Revenge of the Sith as,

04:25.200 --> 04:29.200
How do you turn over democracy to a tyrant with applause?

04:29.200 --> 04:31.200
Not with a coup, but with applause.

04:31.200 --> 04:34.200
That is the story of Caesar, Napoleon, and Hitler.

04:34.200 --> 04:38.200
So, deliberate reference to fascist iconography is there in all Star Wars movies.

04:38.200 --> 04:42.200
But if we're talking about the prevalence of Nazi imagery in popular culture,

04:42.200 --> 04:44.200
guess we need to talk about our girl.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.200
Turn down for what?

04:46.200 --> 04:48.200
Wait, wait, no, no, no, no, no, you're a f***ing fascist.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.200
You don't deserve turn down for what?

04:50.200 --> 04:53.200
Look at this photograph

04:53.200 --> 04:55.200
Okay, that's better.

04:55.200 --> 04:58.200
It's hard to talk about the history of film, let alone the Star Wars franchise,

04:58.200 --> 05:01.200
without eventually discussing the work of director Leni Riefenstahl,

05:01.200 --> 05:06.200
whose most notable works were her propaganda films made in celebration of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party,

05:06.200 --> 05:09.200
Triumph of the Will, and Olympia.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.200
Writer and activist Susan Sontag once wrote that

05:11.200 --> 05:15.200
Riefenstahl is the only major artist who was completely identified with the Nazi era

05:15.200 --> 05:19.200
and whose work, not only during the Third Reich, but 30 years after its fall,

05:19.200 --> 05:22.200
has consistently illustrated some of the themes of fascist aesthetics.

05:22.200 --> 05:25.200
And while the topic of Leni Riefenstahl and the impact of her work

05:25.200 --> 05:27.200
could easily fill a much longer video than this,

05:27.200 --> 05:31.200
we are keeping it simple for more on Riefenstahl's influence on Triumph of the Will,

05:31.200 --> 05:33.200
see Dan Olson's video on the same subject.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.200
Suffice to say that, aside from the whole Nazi propaganda thing,

05:36.200 --> 05:38.200
Leni Riefenstahl is notable for,

05:38.200 --> 05:39.200
DEBATABLY,

05:39.200 --> 05:43.200
pioneering filming techniques, editing, and striking sweeping shots,

05:43.200 --> 05:45.200
in particular, for documentary film.

05:45.200 --> 05:49.200
But more relevant here is the iconography she developed to show the power of the Reich

05:49.200 --> 05:52.200
that influences depictions of Nazis and fascists to this day.

05:52.200 --> 05:56.200
The iconography that we associate with Nazis isn't from historical documents

05:56.200 --> 05:59.200
or from, you know, non-Nazi historians.

05:59.200 --> 06:01.200
It's from Nazi propaganda.

06:01.200 --> 06:04.200
Specifically, this Nazi propaganda.

06:04.200 --> 06:07.200
And that is Leni Riefenstahl's legacy.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.200
So when we see the aesthetics of the Empire and the First Order,

06:10.200 --> 06:12.200
they aren't inspired by the Third Reich,

06:12.200 --> 06:15.200
but by Nazi propaganda about the Third Reich.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.200
So, it's the Cold War,

06:17.200 --> 06:20.200
Leni Riefenstahl's been acquitted of any war crimes,

06:20.200 --> 06:22.200
despite her films Valley to the Nazi Party

06:22.200 --> 06:24.200
and propaganda and her friendship with Hitler and Goebbels.

06:24.200 --> 06:28.200
This narrative of Leni Riefenstahl as an auteur who just, you know,

06:28.200 --> 06:31.200
happened to make films for a monstrous regime emerges,

06:31.200 --> 06:34.200
and a renewed international interest in her work accompanies it

06:34.200 --> 06:38.200
and reaches a whole new generation of film directors.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.200
Ahem.

06:39.200 --> 06:42.200
So you see these shots of marching soldiers,

06:42.200 --> 06:44.200
the way villains are filmed from slightly below,

06:44.200 --> 06:47.200
and this very direct call to a shot in Triumph of the Will,

06:47.200 --> 06:50.200
and the influence is surprisingly overt.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.200
So this isn't oops, accidental Nazis.

06:52.200 --> 06:56.200
The call to fascist iconography is deliberate in all three trilogies.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.200
But here's the thing about fascism.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.200
It usually rises for a reason.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.200
You know, never a good reason,

07:02.200 --> 07:05.200
but there's always a call to arms, if you will.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.200
An ideology.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.200
If we're gonna try to discern the ideology of the First Order,

07:16.200 --> 07:18.200
it's only fair that we do the same for the Empire.

07:18.200 --> 07:23.200
So what did the Empire actually stand for in the original trilogy, if anything?

07:23.200 --> 07:26.200
Well, the original trilogy never dives too deeply into it,

07:26.200 --> 07:28.200
and both the good guys and the bad guys play into larger,

07:28.200 --> 07:31.200
non-specific tropes in demonstrating their moral alignment,

07:31.200 --> 07:34.200
i.e. the flippant genocide of all of Alderaan by the Death Star.

07:34.200 --> 07:39.200
The Empire had no real conclusive ideology behind their regime in the original trilogy.

07:39.200 --> 07:44.200
Now you see that evil will always triumph because good is dumb.

07:44.200 --> 07:47.200
And part of this is because they don't need to.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.200
It has to do with where we enter the story,

07:49.200 --> 07:51.200
and this is one strength the original trilogy has.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.200
And yes, actually, even the prequels.

07:53.200 --> 07:56.200
I'm a person and my name is Anakin.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.200
Bear with me.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.200
When we first meet Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia,

07:59.200 --> 08:02.200
we are entering a universe where the Empire is not only in power,

08:02.200 --> 08:04.200
it is the only power.

08:04.200 --> 08:06.200
They've been in power since before Luke was born,

08:06.200 --> 08:09.200
and this is the only power structure young Luke has ever known,

08:09.200 --> 08:12.200
and therefore the only one we, the audience, know.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.200
Moreover, the story starts on Tatooine,

08:14.200 --> 08:16.200
a shithole of a planet that nobody cares about.

08:16.200 --> 08:18.200
I have no need for a protocol droid.

08:18.200 --> 08:21.200
Of course you haven't, sir. Not in an environment such as this.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.200
Day-to-day life is kind of impacted,

08:23.200 --> 08:25.200
Luke understands that the Empire is unjust,

08:25.200 --> 08:27.200
but it's not the worst ever.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.200
You know, the Empire more or less leaves people alone

08:29.200 --> 08:31.200
unless they rabble-rouse, you know,

08:31.200 --> 08:33.200
like most totalitarian states in peacetime.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.200
Luke isn't really even keen on joining the rebellion

08:35.200 --> 08:37.200
until his family gets torched.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.200
Meanwhile, with the prequels, again hot mess though they are,

08:39.200 --> 08:42.200
the power structure in place does make sense, kind of.

08:42.200 --> 08:45.200
And though it requires an absurd level of 13-dimensional chess

08:45.200 --> 08:47.200
on the part of Palpatine,

08:47.200 --> 08:49.200
it's clear what the power structure is,

08:49.200 --> 08:52.200
what it stands for, and how the Senate is duped by fear

08:52.200 --> 08:54.200
into giving themselves over to fascism

08:54.200 --> 08:57.200
as evidenced by the one good line in all three movies.

08:57.200 --> 09:00.200
So this is how liberty dies,

09:00.200 --> 09:02.200
with thunderous applause.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.200
Palpatine manufactured a crisis,

09:04.200 --> 09:05.200
exploited fear,

09:05.200 --> 09:07.200
somebody burned down the Reichstag,

09:07.200 --> 09:08.200
and wouldn't you know it,

09:08.200 --> 09:11.200
told me I was Führer.

09:11.200 --> 09:15.200
But in the new trilogy, we have the First Order fighting against the Resistance,

09:15.200 --> 09:18.200
who is being backed by the semi-neutral New Republic,

09:18.200 --> 09:20.200
a confusing mess of a power structure

09:20.200 --> 09:23.200
that itself gets blown up halfway through The Force Awakens...

09:23.200 --> 09:26.200
before we even meet them or know who they are anyway.

09:26.200 --> 09:29.200
A similar plot point to the destruction of the New Republic

09:29.200 --> 09:31.200
happens in A New Hope.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.200
Grand Moff Tarkin orders the destruction of a planet

09:33.200 --> 09:35.200
that we've never seen or been to,

09:35.200 --> 09:38.200
but it works more effectively in A New Hope for one simple reason.

09:38.200 --> 09:41.200
It's Leia's home planet, and she make a sad face.

09:41.200 --> 09:44.200
Secondly, it's clear why the Empire destroys Alderaan.

09:44.200 --> 09:47.200
Leia is becoming a figurehead in this nascent rebellion,

09:47.200 --> 09:48.200
and it's her home planet.

09:48.200 --> 09:51.200
Moreover, this is a common tactic in totalitarian states.

09:51.200 --> 09:54.200
Big displays of force to keep the folk in line.

09:54.200 --> 09:56.200
The Republic in The Force Awakens,

09:56.200 --> 09:58.200
yes, there was a deleted scene where they sent a character,

09:58.200 --> 09:59.200
we know there, but it was deleted,

09:59.200 --> 10:01.200
and either way, none of the main characters

10:01.200 --> 10:03.200
have any connection to the Hosnian system.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.200
Point is, from a narrative standpoint,

10:04.200 --> 10:06.200
the ideology of the First Order

10:06.200 --> 10:09.200
and why they do what they do matters more in The Force Awakens

10:09.200 --> 10:12.200
because the First Order isn't really in power yet.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.200
They're more of a rogue state,

10:14.200 --> 10:17.200
and therefore their task is to rally people to their side with rhetoric,

10:17.200 --> 10:18.200
or invade Poland.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.200
But they don't.

10:19.200 --> 10:22.200
Apparently they just steal babies and raise them under totalitarianism,

10:22.200 --> 10:26.200
but don't worry, these kidnapped babies shake their conditioning pretty quickly.

10:26.200 --> 10:27.200
F.N., huh?

10:27.200 --> 10:29.200
Finn, I'm gonna call you Finn, is that alright?

10:29.200 --> 10:30.200
Finn.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.200
Yeah, Finn, I like that!

10:32.200 --> 10:35.200
My point is the new trilogy incorporates a lot of stuff

10:35.200 --> 10:38.200
that is evocative of real-world atrocities...

10:38.200 --> 10:42.200
without really thinking through the implications of these inclusions,

10:42.200 --> 10:44.200
or the real-world connotations.

10:44.200 --> 10:47.200
They don't destroy the New Republic as a means of maintaining control,

10:47.200 --> 10:50.200
it's more of a we-demand-to-be-taken-seriously.

10:50.200 --> 10:53.200
One that creates a power vacuum that they have ostensibly

10:53.200 --> 10:56.200
exploited and filmed by the time of The Last Jedi,

10:56.200 --> 10:59.200
I guess... it's not really clear.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.200
Who is driving? Bear is driving.

11:01.200 --> 11:04.200
And the destruction of the Hosnian system works from a dramatic standpoint,

11:04.200 --> 11:06.200
but it doesn't really work from a narrative standpoint.

11:06.200 --> 11:09.200
It doesn't really make a whole lot of sense in The Force Awakens,

11:09.200 --> 11:12.200
which itself has a bad habit of aping plot points from A New Hope

11:12.200 --> 11:15.200
without importing that all-important context.

11:15.200 --> 11:19.200
The Empire was in total control, and keeping the rabble-rousers in line,

11:19.200 --> 11:22.200
the First Order is a rogue state who demands to be taken seriously.

11:22.200 --> 11:24.200
But let's take for granted that this is all deliberate.

11:24.200 --> 11:27.200
There are two things that The Last Jedi introduced which kind of begs

11:27.200 --> 11:30.200
one to consider the mechanics of the universe.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.200
A. War profiteering.

11:32.200 --> 11:36.200
There's only one business in the galaxy that'll get you this rich.

11:36.200 --> 11:37.200
War?

11:37.200 --> 11:40.200
Selling weapons to the First Order.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.200
B. An implied caste system with exploited labor,

11:43.200 --> 11:45.200
and child labor at the bottom.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.200
So it's clear what our heroes are fighting for,

11:47.200 --> 11:50.200
but if the light rises, so too must the dark.

11:50.200 --> 11:53.200
In other words, what is the First Order fighting for?

11:53.200 --> 11:55.200
You know, besides...

12:05.200 --> 12:07.200
Fascism has always been difficult to define as an ideology

12:07.200 --> 12:11.200
compared to, say, Nazism, itself a form of fascism.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.200
Ask the average person to define fascism,

12:13.200 --> 12:16.200
and they probably will not do it accurately,

12:16.200 --> 12:18.200
yet we still love using fascist as an insult.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.200
People don't really know what fascism is,

12:20.200 --> 12:22.200
but they know what it looks like,

12:22.200 --> 12:26.200
or is imagined to look like, thanks in part to movies like Star Wars.

12:26.200 --> 12:29.200
Umberto Eco's 1995 essay, Ur-Fascism,

12:29.200 --> 12:31.200
which you should go read right now,

12:31.200 --> 12:34.200
perhaps captures the elusive nature of fascism the most succinctly.

12:34.200 --> 12:37.200
According to Eco, the fascist game can be played in many forms,

12:37.200 --> 12:39.200
and the name of the game does not change.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.200
Fascism does not belong to one nationality,

12:41.200 --> 12:43.200
nor religion, nor period of time.

12:43.200 --> 12:47.200
However, Eco does outline 14 bullet points in defining fascism.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.200
I'm not going to list all of them,

12:48.200 --> 12:51.200
but stick to the ones which are relevant with regard to the First Order.

12:51.200 --> 12:54.200
An emphasis on, read, cult of tradition.

12:54.200 --> 12:57.200
Exploiting a natural fear of difference.

12:57.200 --> 13:01.200
Disagreement is a sign of diversity, and diversity bad.

13:01.200 --> 13:05.200
There is no struggle for life, but rather, life is lived for struggle.

13:05.200 --> 13:08.200
And in such a perspective, everyone is educated to become a hero.

13:08.200 --> 13:11.200
In every mythology, the hero is an exceptional being,

13:11.200 --> 13:14.200
but in Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm.

13:14.200 --> 13:17.200
This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.

13:17.200 --> 13:21.200
So, on second thought, maybe this indefinable fluid ideology

13:21.200 --> 13:23.200
of the First Order speaks to it being fascist,

13:23.200 --> 13:25.200
in spite of the fact that we literally know nothing

13:25.200 --> 13:27.200
about what it is the First Order actually wants.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.200
You know, besides...

13:38.200 --> 13:41.200
Oh, Kylo Ren, you quilt of rage.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.200
You amalgam of every bad boy cliche,

13:43.200 --> 13:47.200
all wrapped in a selfish ideology and scaffolded by space fascists.

13:47.200 --> 13:50.200
Save him, Rey. You know you want to.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.200
It isn't too late.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.200
Save him.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.200
So, Kylo Ren is the epitome of everything that is fascist,

13:55.200 --> 13:57.200
but fanfic-y about the First Order.

13:57.200 --> 14:00.200
Kylo does not have an ideology outside of the ideology of the self,

14:00.200 --> 14:03.200
which puts him somewhat at odds with real world fascists.

14:03.200 --> 14:07.200
You can't have a cult of heroism if you don't particularly care about being a hero.

14:07.200 --> 14:10.200
If you've ever run into any identitarians,

14:10.200 --> 14:14.200
you may note that when they do tend to fall to the dark side,

14:14.200 --> 14:17.200
they also tend to adhere to a certain set of ideologies,

14:17.200 --> 14:19.200
usually having to do with race, nationality,

14:19.200 --> 14:22.200
protecting the people from some amorphous foreign threat,

14:22.200 --> 14:24.200
and white women being obedient broodmares.

14:24.200 --> 14:28.200
But all it really does is give a sense of purpose to this sort of amorphous rage

14:28.200 --> 14:32.200
felt by the Ur-fascist, which the fascist power structure can now exploit.

14:32.200 --> 14:36.200
The relationship between Snoke and Kylo Ren actually illustrates this really well.

14:36.200 --> 14:40.200
This is also why Kylo Ren disposes of Snoke so easily.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.200
His ideology doesn't matter.

14:42.200 --> 14:46.200
So obviously the First Order doesn't need to mirror real world fascists

14:46.200 --> 14:49.200
in order to have their own brand of fictional fascism.

14:49.200 --> 14:55.200
Maybe instead of the cultural Marxists masterminding multiculturalism,

14:55.200 --> 14:58.200
they're scapegoating aliens or something.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.200
Those goddamn wookies are taking our jobs!

15:00.200 --> 15:03.200
A scapegoat for some social problem, real or imagined,

15:03.200 --> 15:06.200
is integral for the rise of fascist power structures.

15:06.200 --> 15:09.200
That undercurrent is there in some of the extended universe books,

15:09.200 --> 15:11.200
particularly the original Thrawn trilogy.

15:11.200 --> 15:13.200
But those books are no longer considered canon,

15:13.200 --> 15:17.200
and that still doesn't shed any light on what the First Order wants or believes.

15:17.200 --> 15:21.200
The closest in this new canon we've seen to actually exploring the ideology of the First Order

15:21.200 --> 15:23.200
was the book Bloodline by Claudia Gray,

15:23.200 --> 15:27.200
wherein the divide in the new liberal republic is between the populists and the centrists.

15:27.200 --> 15:31.200
And in the Star Wars universe, those words do not mean at all what they mean in our universe.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.200
So this gets really confusing.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.200
The pre-First Order political divide in the Star Wars universe

15:36.200 --> 15:41.200
is more akin to the political divide between Alexander Hamilton's Federalists

15:41.200 --> 15:44.200
and Thomas Jefferson's Democratic Republicans,

15:44.200 --> 15:48.200
with Princess Leia on the Jeffersonian side as a populist.

15:48.200 --> 15:51.200
Again, this term does not mean what it means in our political discourse,

15:51.200 --> 15:52.200
and it's really confusing.

15:52.200 --> 15:55.200
And with her on-again, off-again rival Ranson Kvsterfo

15:55.200 --> 15:59.200
on the Hamiltonian side as a centrist.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.200
He wants a stronger central government.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.200
I wish they had chosen different names.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.200
The populists are more like a states' rights crowd.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.200
They want the planets to be more autonomous,

16:07.200 --> 16:10.200
and the centrists favor a stronger central government.

16:10.200 --> 16:15.200
And no one realizes that a fair chunk of the Hamiltonian centrists are actually closet fascists.

16:15.200 --> 16:18.200
And like with the prequels, there is some mundane conflict

16:18.200 --> 16:21.200
that the fascists can exploit in order to consolidate power.

16:21.200 --> 16:24.200
The point I'm making here is that it is actually kind of difficult

16:24.200 --> 16:28.200
to demonstrate how fascist ideologies gain traction in society and fiction.

16:28.200 --> 16:31.200
But with all that said, we don't learn a whole lot about their ideology

16:31.200 --> 16:34.200
other than the typical Star Wars powers for powers' sake

16:34.200 --> 16:37.200
and, you know, hate and dark side and all that.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.200
In part because said ideology could be hashtag too real

16:40.200 --> 16:43.200
and read as flippant or offensive,

16:43.200 --> 16:46.200
but also because the underlying ideology is never logical.

16:46.200 --> 16:49.200
Revenge of the Sith actually demonstrates that really well.

16:49.200 --> 16:52.200
So if you're going to try and make, like, pajamas and plush toys

16:52.200 --> 16:54.200
out of your space fascists,

16:54.200 --> 16:58.200
it does make sense that you'd probably just want to skip all that

16:58.200 --> 17:01.200
and just get right to the totalitarianism part.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.200
So let's go back to Kylo Ren.

17:03.200 --> 17:07.200
What was it about the ideology of the First Order that appeals to him?

17:07.200 --> 17:09.200
Was he worried about alien multiculturalism

17:09.200 --> 17:12.200
leading to the eventual demise of the human race?

17:12.200 --> 17:14.200
No, he's disappointed in his father.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.200
And his father figure.

17:16.200 --> 17:19.200
I guess Luke made a boo-boo and thought about killing him for a second,

17:19.200 --> 17:24.200
but Kylo Ren didn't join the fascists because he was seduced by fascist ideology.

17:24.200 --> 17:28.200
Kylo Ren is a fascist figurehead out of spite.

17:28.200 --> 17:31.200
The Supreme Leader is dead.

17:33.200 --> 17:36.200
Long live the Supreme Leader.

17:36.200 --> 17:40.200
The Last Jedi shows that Kylo Ren doesn't really care about enriching any side

17:40.200 --> 17:42.200
other than whatever side will best empower him,

17:42.200 --> 17:46.200
which goes to show that he has no ideology to defend because he doesn't care

17:46.200 --> 17:49.200
and possibly because there is no ideology to defend.

17:49.200 --> 17:52.200
I think this also speaks to some of the disappointment with Snoke.

17:52.200 --> 17:55.200
The Emperor was good at stoking fear and exploiting it,

17:55.200 --> 17:58.200
a common authoritarian tactic, but Snoke?

17:58.200 --> 18:00.200
What does he even want?

18:00.200 --> 18:02.200
The Supreme Leader is wise.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.200
Snoke is using you for your power.

18:04.200 --> 18:09.200
The seed of the Jedi Order lives.

18:09.200 --> 18:12.200
As long as it does, hope lives.

18:12.200 --> 18:15.200
In the end, Kylo Ren is willing to dispatch with his old master.

18:15.200 --> 18:17.200
Basically on a whim.

18:17.200 --> 18:20.200
Because Snoke's ideology is not worth fighting for.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.200
Because it doesn't exist.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.200
Routing around back to Umberto Eco,

18:23.200 --> 18:27.200
one concept of fascism is that it idealizes this concept of some savior,

18:27.200 --> 18:30.200
or what Eco refers to as the Ur-Fascist hero.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.200
Says Eco,

18:31.200 --> 18:35.200
In non-fascist societies, the lay public is told that death is unpleasant,

18:35.200 --> 18:37.200
must be faced with dignity,

18:37.200 --> 18:40.200
believers are told that it is the painful way to reach a supernatural happiness.

18:40.200 --> 18:43.200
By contrast, the Ur-Fascist hero craves heroic death,

18:43.200 --> 18:46.200
advertised as the best reward for a heroic life.

18:46.200 --> 18:48.200
The Ur-Fascist hero is impatient to die.

18:48.200 --> 18:52.200
In his impatience, he more frequently sends other people to death.

18:52.200 --> 18:55.200
Since permanent war and heroism are difficult games to play,

18:55.200 --> 18:58.200
the Ur-Fascist transfer his will to power to sexual matters.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.200
This is the origin of machismo,

19:00.200 --> 19:02.200
which implies both disdain for women

19:02.200 --> 19:05.200
and intolerance and condemnation of non-standard sexual habits,

19:05.200 --> 19:07.200
from chastity to homosexuality.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.200
Since even sex is a difficult game to play,

19:09.200 --> 19:12.200
the Ur-Fascist hero tends to play with weapons,

19:12.200 --> 19:15.200
doing so becomes an ersatzphalic exercise.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.200
So, before Luke's oopsie daisy,

19:24.200 --> 19:26.200
Kylo Ren is essentially the proto-fascist Klay,

19:26.200 --> 19:29.200
the raw anger and resentment before it has been given a target.

19:29.200 --> 19:32.200
This is all part and parcel with the actual narrative trajectory of the trilogy,

19:32.200 --> 19:35.200
where Ben is savable in part because he lacks ideology.

19:35.200 --> 19:39.200
However, even in that, he still embodies Eco's description of Ur-Fascism

19:39.200 --> 19:42.200
as a non-ideology of action for action's sake.

19:42.200 --> 19:44.200
So, what does the First Order want?

19:44.200 --> 19:46.200
It could be that the movies go out of their way not to say

19:46.200 --> 19:48.200
because then it would be hashtag too real

19:48.200 --> 19:51.200
and we can't put Captain Phasma on t-shirts.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.200
Or, and I'm about to give Disney way too much credit,

19:53.200 --> 19:56.200
there could be a deeper understanding at play

19:56.200 --> 19:59.200
that the ideology doesn't actually matter,

19:59.200 --> 20:01.200
and that's kind of the point.

20:01.200 --> 20:06.200
Perhaps the error is in trying to apply logic to an inherently non-logical ideology.

20:06.200 --> 20:07.200
Again, according to Eco,

20:07.200 --> 20:10.200
Nazism had a really clear-cut ideology,

20:10.200 --> 20:13.200
but concurrent Italian fascism under Mussolini did not,

20:13.200 --> 20:16.200
and the First Order also borrows heavily from those aesthetics.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.200
In Eco's words,

20:17.200 --> 20:20.200
Contrary to common opinion, fascism in Italy had no special philosophy.

20:20.200 --> 20:22.200
Mussolini did not have any philosophy.

20:22.200 --> 20:24.200
He only had rhetoric.

20:24.200 --> 20:27.200
In his early anti-clerical years, according to a likely legend,

20:27.200 --> 20:30.200
he once asked God in order to prove his existence to strike him down on the spot.

20:30.200 --> 20:33.200
Later, Mussolini always cited the name of God in his speeches

20:33.200 --> 20:36.200
and did not mind being called the Man of Providence.

20:36.200 --> 20:39.200
So on the one hand, it's not unfair to point out that with fascism,

20:39.200 --> 20:41.200
ideology is only a means to an end,

20:41.200 --> 20:44.200
and the end is the quashing of dissent, stamping out diversity,

20:44.200 --> 20:47.200
heroes in heroic death, and strict totalitarianism.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.200
Star Wars has always understood that much.

20:49.200 --> 20:52.200
Bad guys employing horrible acts we see mirrored in the real world,

20:52.200 --> 20:55.200
but shifting them just far enough from real-world atrocities

20:55.200 --> 20:59.200
that we can merchandise the villains almost as much as we merchandise the heroes.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.200
We see this in the likes of Thanos as well.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.200
He's a genocidal monster, sure,

21:03.200 --> 21:07.200
but, you know, at least he goes by random coin toss for who he kills.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.200
Some of the time.

21:09.200 --> 21:14.200
See, he doesn't target specific ethnic groups like real genociders do.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.200
He's an egalitarian genocidal monster.

21:16.200 --> 21:18.200
He's complex.

21:18.200 --> 21:20.200
To quote Eco again,

21:34.200 --> 21:37.200
all the elements of any later form of totalitarianism.

21:37.200 --> 21:40.200
On the contrary, fascism had no quintessence.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.200
Fascism was a fuzzy totalitarianism,

21:42.200 --> 21:45.200
a collage of different philosophical and political ideas,

21:45.200 --> 21:47.200
a beehive of contradictions.

21:47.200 --> 21:49.200
So it could be that they're being lazy and playing it safe

21:49.200 --> 21:51.200
so they can sell more stuff, but who knows?

21:51.200 --> 21:54.200
Maybe deep down, Disney understands this.

21:54.200 --> 21:57.200
And that's what makes this family-friendly type of fascism

21:57.200 --> 22:00.200
so easy to brand and to sell.

22:01.200 --> 22:04.200
So... who cares?

22:04.200 --> 22:09.200
Part of the problem with applying even a very modest set of academic theory

22:09.200 --> 22:15.200
to a pop culture thing is then we get some hand wringing over the inevitable moralizing

22:15.200 --> 22:17.200
and it also begs the question,

22:17.200 --> 22:19.200
well, what do you want me to do about it?

22:19.200 --> 22:22.200
Not own Darth Vader pajamas?

22:22.200 --> 22:27.200
When that is not the point, the point is to examine the context of the thing,

22:27.200 --> 22:30.200
and demand that Disney make their villains less fashy.

22:30.200 --> 22:35.200
Fictional villains always draw inspiration from real-world bad things,

22:35.200 --> 22:37.200
and that's fine.

22:37.200 --> 22:42.200
That said, I do think it's worth examining how the portrayal of the dark side has changed

22:42.200 --> 22:44.200
since Disney got a hold of it,

22:44.200 --> 22:48.200
that the filmmakers decided to lean into the fashy imagery rather than away from it.

22:48.200 --> 22:55.200
And yes, Star Wars merchandising has always, always heavily relied on marketing bad characters

22:55.200 --> 22:59.200
like Darth Vader and Boba Fett in order to help earn that sweet green.

22:59.200 --> 23:03.200
But the significance of iconography can shift over time,

23:03.200 --> 23:09.200
and I do think it's worth examining the difference of selling cute, fashy bad guy characters in 1977

23:09.200 --> 23:12.200
and selling the same in 2018.

23:25.200 --> 23:33.200
Thanks for watching!
