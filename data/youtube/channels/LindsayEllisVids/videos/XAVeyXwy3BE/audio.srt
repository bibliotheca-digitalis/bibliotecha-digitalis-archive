1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
It's a beautiful day at Disney World's Hollywood Studios.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:08,960
The rockin' rollercoaster is rockin', a sea of Mickey ears flows through the park,

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,640
and that Beauty and the Beast live show is mysteriously still running.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,160
And it is here at Disney World's Hollywood Studios.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:23,200
Every hour on the hour, a cavalcade of stormtroopers begins its march down the centrally located Hollywood Boulevard.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,200
Led by Captain Phasma to the First Order march theme,

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,800
while hundreds of onlookers take pictures and admire what the Walt Disney World website describes as

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,000
a daunting demonstration of the First Order's obedience and strength.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,800
Yikes.

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,400
But for realsies, the march of the First Order is quite literally framed as a recruitment seminar.

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,400
You know, for kids.

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,600
And it's moments like these when you stop and notice the countless pieces of stormtrooper merchandise,

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,400
both for sale and being worn around the park by adults and kids alike,

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,200
and one has to wonder,

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,200
how is it that we've arrived at a point where one of the largest multimedia conglomerates in the world

16
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,200
can create a show at one of the world's most popular theme parks that is, in effect,

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,200
cosplay fascism?

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,200
Because they are fascists, right?

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,200
I mean, they look like fascists, they talk like fascists.

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,200
As the last day of the Republic!

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,200
They have a fascist ideol-

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,200
Wait, actually, on second thought, do they?

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Does the First Order have any ideology?

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's right.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We're here to try to figure out the driving ideology of the First Order.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I mean, what did you expect?

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm not saying putting space fascists on Rice Krispie treats is, like, bad or immoral.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm just saying it's interesting how Disney has pushed their marketing of

29
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,800
to be as evocative of real-world fascist movements as possible,

30
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:04,800
while not so evocative that people start casting a side-eye at putting stormtroopers on cuddly throws.

31
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,800
But despite being fiction, the First Order is based, more than anything,

32
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,800
on history's most famous group of fascists.

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
And that kind of begs the question,

34
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,800
can you import the aesthetics of fascism while kind of tabling fascist ideology

35
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,800
so that you can sell Captain Phasma Christmas ornaments?

36
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,600
I mean, the answer is obviously yes,

37
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,600
but we're gonna go ahead and make a thing out of it anyway.

38
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
It's common knowledge that the Star Wars universe

39
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,600
was based heavily on drawing from a 30-year cycle of nostalgia

40
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,600
and had two heavily aesthetic influences pulled from that particular past.

41
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Spacey fantasy serials like Flash Gordon,

42
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,600
which George Lucas originally wanted to adapt for film but couldn't obtain the rights for,

43
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
and World War II imagery.

44
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,600
But there is a tendency in nerd critical spaces

45
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,400
for people to get kind of defensive when you start talking about the fact that

46
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,400
Star Wars was a little extremely inspired by World War II

47
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,400
and this is known and has been known since it was incepted.

48
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,400
But I look forward to an interesting and robust conversation in the comments below.

49
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Ring that bell so it'll do whatever it is that it's supposed to do.

50
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
Like, share, and subscribe.

51
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,400
Leave me a comment if you think that Kylo Ren is the sexiest space Nazi in the galaxy.

52
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,400
Just kidding, I don't read the comments.

53
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,200
If there is one aesthetic influence on the Empire

54
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
and, by extension, their descendants, the First Order,

55
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,200
it was the Third Reich.

56
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,200
This is a convenient visual shorthand, especially for audiences in the 70s

57
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,200
for whom the horrors of Nazi Germany were close enough that this was simple and effective

58
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,200
but not so recent that it's, you know, too real.

59
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,200
To quote the recently passed costume designer for the original Star Wars trilogy,

60
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,200
John Mollo,

61
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,200
Lucas wanted the imperial people to look efficient,

62
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,200
totalitarian, fascist,

63
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,200
and the rebels, the goodies, to look something out of a Western or a U.S. Marines.

64
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
He said,

65
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,200
You've got a very difficult job here because I don't want anyone to notice the costumes.

66
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,200
They've got to look familiar, but not familiar at the same time.

67
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,200
But in general, the Nazi aesthetic,

68
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,200
from the uniform tailoring to the color schemes to the headgear,

69
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,200
seems pretty obvious as a source of inspiration.

70
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,200
It's even there in the way the actors playing the Empire characters approached their roles.

71
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,200
To quote actor Kenneth Colley, who played Admiral Peet in the original trilogy,

72
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Obviously they were going on some sort of design for Darth Vader's men.

73
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,200
There were echoes of the Gestapo, or at least fascism in there,

74
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,200
and that was how I approached the role.

75
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,200
And this doesn't even begin to dive into George Lucas' thoughts when it comes to the prequels,

76
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,200
where he describes the rise of the emperor in Revenge of the Sith as,

77
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,200
How do you turn over democracy to a tyrant with applause?

78
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,200
Not with a coup, but with applause.

79
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,200
That is the story of Caesar, Napoleon, and Hitler.

80
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,200
So, deliberate reference to fascist iconography is there in all Star Wars movies.

81
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,200
But if we're talking about the prevalence of Nazi imagery in popular culture,

82
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,200
guess we need to talk about our girl.

83
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Turn down for what?

84
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,200
Wait, wait, no, no, no, no, no, you're a f***ing fascist.

85
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,200
You don't deserve turn down for what?

86
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,200
Look at this photograph

87
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,200
Okay, that's better.

88
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,200
It's hard to talk about the history of film, let alone the Star Wars franchise,

89
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,200
without eventually discussing the work of director Leni Riefenstahl,

90
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,200
whose most notable works were her propaganda films made in celebration of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party,

91
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,200
Triumph of the Will, and Olympia.

92
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,200
Writer and activist Susan Sontag once wrote that

93
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,200
Riefenstahl is the only major artist who was completely identified with the Nazi era

94
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,200
and whose work, not only during the Third Reich, but 30 years after its fall,

95
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,200
has consistently illustrated some of the themes of fascist aesthetics.

96
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,200
And while the topic of Leni Riefenstahl and the impact of her work

97
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,200
could easily fill a much longer video than this,

98
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,200
we are keeping it simple for more on Riefenstahl's influence on Triumph of the Will,

99
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,200
see Dan Olson's video on the same subject.

100
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,200
Suffice to say that, aside from the whole Nazi propaganda thing,

101
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,200
Leni Riefenstahl is notable for,

102
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
DEBATABLY,

103
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,200
pioneering filming techniques, editing, and striking sweeping shots,

104
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,200
in particular, for documentary film.

105
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,200
But more relevant here is the iconography she developed to show the power of the Reich

106
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,200
that influences depictions of Nazis and fascists to this day.

107
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,200
The iconography that we associate with Nazis isn't from historical documents

108
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,200
or from, you know, non-Nazi historians.

109
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,200
It's from Nazi propaganda.

110
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Specifically, this Nazi propaganda.

111
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,200
And that is Leni Riefenstahl's legacy.

112
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,200
So when we see the aesthetics of the Empire and the First Order,

113
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
they aren't inspired by the Third Reich,

114
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,200
but by Nazi propaganda about the Third Reich.

115
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,200
So, it's the Cold War,

116
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Leni Riefenstahl's been acquitted of any war crimes,

117
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
despite her films Valley to the Nazi Party

118
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
and propaganda and her friendship with Hitler and Goebbels.

119
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,200
This narrative of Leni Riefenstahl as an auteur who just, you know,

120
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,200
happened to make films for a monstrous regime emerges,

121
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,200
and a renewed international interest in her work accompanies it

122
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,200
and reaches a whole new generation of film directors.

123
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,200
Ahem.

124
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,200
So you see these shots of marching soldiers,

125
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,200
the way villains are filmed from slightly below,

126
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,200
and this very direct call to a shot in Triumph of the Will,

127
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,200
and the influence is surprisingly overt.

128
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,200
So this isn't oops, accidental Nazis.

129
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,200
The call to fascist iconography is deliberate in all three trilogies.

130
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,200
But here's the thing about fascism.

131
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,200
It usually rises for a reason.

132
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
You know, never a good reason,

133
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,200
but there's always a call to arms, if you will.

134
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,200
An ideology.

135
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
If we're gonna try to discern the ideology of the First Order,

136
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
it's only fair that we do the same for the Empire.

137
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,200
So what did the Empire actually stand for in the original trilogy, if anything?

138
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Well, the original trilogy never dives too deeply into it,

139
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,200
and both the good guys and the bad guys play into larger,

140
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,200
non-specific tropes in demonstrating their moral alignment,

141
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,200
i.e. the flippant genocide of all of Alderaan by the Death Star.

142
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,200
The Empire had no real conclusive ideology behind their regime in the original trilogy.

143
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,200
Now you see that evil will always triumph because good is dumb.

144
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,200
And part of this is because they don't need to.

145
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,200
It has to do with where we enter the story,

146
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,200
and this is one strength the original trilogy has.

147
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,200
And yes, actually, even the prequels.

148
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,200
I'm a person and my name is Anakin.

149
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
Bear with me.

150
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
When we first meet Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia,

151
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,200
we are entering a universe where the Empire is not only in power,

152
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,200
it is the only power.

153
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,200
They've been in power since before Luke was born,

154
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,200
and this is the only power structure young Luke has ever known,

155
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,200
and therefore the only one we, the audience, know.

156
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,200
Moreover, the story starts on Tatooine,

157
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,200
a shithole of a planet that nobody cares about.

158
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
I have no need for a protocol droid.

159
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Of course you haven't, sir. Not in an environment such as this.

160
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Day-to-day life is kind of impacted,

161
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Luke understands that the Empire is unjust,

162
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,200
but it's not the worst ever.

163
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,200
You know, the Empire more or less leaves people alone

164
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,200
unless they rabble-rouse, you know,

165
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
like most totalitarian states in peacetime.

166
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Luke isn't really even keen on joining the rebellion

167
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
until his family gets torched.

168
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Meanwhile, with the prequels, again hot mess though they are,

169
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,200
the power structure in place does make sense, kind of.

170
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,200
And though it requires an absurd level of 13-dimensional chess

171
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
on the part of Palpatine,

172
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
it's clear what the power structure is,

173
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,200
what it stands for, and how the Senate is duped by fear

174
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,200
into giving themselves over to fascism

175
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,200
as evidenced by the one good line in all three movies.

176
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,200
So this is how liberty dies,

177
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
with thunderous applause.

178
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
Palpatine manufactured a crisis,

179
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
exploited fear,

180
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
somebody burned down the Reichstag,

181
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
and wouldn't you know it,

182
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,200
told me I was Führer.

183
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,200
But in the new trilogy, we have the First Order fighting against the Resistance,

184
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,200
who is being backed by the semi-neutral New Republic,

185
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
a confusing mess of a power structure

186
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,200
that itself gets blown up halfway through The Force Awakens...

187
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,200
before we even meet them or know who they are anyway.

188
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,200
A similar plot point to the destruction of the New Republic

189
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
happens in A New Hope.

190
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
Grand Moff Tarkin orders the destruction of a planet

191
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
that we've never seen or been to,

192
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,200
but it works more effectively in A New Hope for one simple reason.

193
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,200
It's Leia's home planet, and she make a sad face.

194
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Secondly, it's clear why the Empire destroys Alderaan.

195
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Leia is becoming a figurehead in this nascent rebellion,

196
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
and it's her home planet.

197
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Moreover, this is a common tactic in totalitarian states.

198
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Big displays of force to keep the folk in line.

199
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,200
The Republic in The Force Awakens,

200
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,200
yes, there was a deleted scene where they sent a character,

201
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
we know there, but it was deleted,

202
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
and either way, none of the main characters

203
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
have any connection to the Hosnian system.

204
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
Point is, from a narrative standpoint,

205
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
the ideology of the First Order

206
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,200
and why they do what they do matters more in The Force Awakens

207
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,200
because the First Order isn't really in power yet.

208
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,200
They're more of a rogue state,

209
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,200
and therefore their task is to rally people to their side with rhetoric,

210
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
or invade Poland.

211
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
But they don't.

212
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,200
Apparently they just steal babies and raise them under totalitarianism,

213
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,200
but don't worry, these kidnapped babies shake their conditioning pretty quickly.

214
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
F.N., huh?

215
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Finn, I'm gonna call you Finn, is that alright?

216
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
Finn.

217
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Yeah, Finn, I like that!

218
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,200
My point is the new trilogy incorporates a lot of stuff

219
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,200
that is evocative of real-world atrocities...

220
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,200
without really thinking through the implications of these inclusions,

221
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,200
or the real-world connotations.

222
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,200
They don't destroy the New Republic as a means of maintaining control,

223
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,200
it's more of a we-demand-to-be-taken-seriously.

224
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,200
One that creates a power vacuum that they have ostensibly

225
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,200
exploited and filmed by the time of The Last Jedi,

226
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,200
I guess... it's not really clear.

227
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Who is driving? Bear is driving.

228
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,200
And the destruction of the Hosnian system works from a dramatic standpoint,

229
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
but it doesn't really work from a narrative standpoint.

230
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,200
It doesn't really make a whole lot of sense in The Force Awakens,

231
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,200
which itself has a bad habit of aping plot points from A New Hope

232
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,200
without importing that all-important context.

233
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,200
The Empire was in total control, and keeping the rabble-rousers in line,

234
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,200
the First Order is a rogue state who demands to be taken seriously.

235
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
But let's take for granted that this is all deliberate.

236
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,200
There are two things that The Last Jedi introduced which kind of begs

237
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,200
one to consider the mechanics of the universe.

238
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,200
A. War profiteering.

239
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,200
There's only one business in the galaxy that'll get you this rich.

240
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,200
War?

241
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Selling weapons to the First Order.

242
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,200
B. An implied caste system with exploited labor,

243
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
and child labor at the bottom.

244
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
So it's clear what our heroes are fighting for,

245
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,200
but if the light rises, so too must the dark.

246
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,200
In other words, what is the First Order fighting for?

247
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,200
You know, besides...

248
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
Fascism has always been difficult to define as an ideology

249
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,200
compared to, say, Nazism, itself a form of fascism.

250
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Ask the average person to define fascism,

251
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,200
and they probably will not do it accurately,

252
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
yet we still love using fascist as an insult.

253
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,200
People don't really know what fascism is,

254
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,200
but they know what it looks like,

255
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,200
or is imagined to look like, thanks in part to movies like Star Wars.

256
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Umberto Eco's 1995 essay, Ur-Fascism,

257
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
which you should go read right now,

258
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,200
perhaps captures the elusive nature of fascism the most succinctly.

259
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,200
According to Eco, the fascist game can be played in many forms,

260
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
and the name of the game does not change.

261
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
Fascism does not belong to one nationality,

262
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
nor religion, nor period of time.

263
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,200
However, Eco does outline 14 bullet points in defining fascism.

264
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
I'm not going to list all of them,

265
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,200
but stick to the ones which are relevant with regard to the First Order.

266
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,200
An emphasis on, read, cult of tradition.

267
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,200
Exploiting a natural fear of difference.

268
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Disagreement is a sign of diversity, and diversity bad.

269
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,200
There is no struggle for life, but rather, life is lived for struggle.

270
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,200
And in such a perspective, everyone is educated to become a hero.

271
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,200
In every mythology, the hero is an exceptional being,

272
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,200
but in Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm.

273
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,200
This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.

274
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,200
So, on second thought, maybe this indefinable fluid ideology

275
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
of the First Order speaks to it being fascist,

276
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
in spite of the fact that we literally know nothing

277
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
about what it is the First Order actually wants.

278
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
You know, besides...

279
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Oh, Kylo Ren, you quilt of rage.

280
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
You amalgam of every bad boy cliche,

281
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,200
all wrapped in a selfish ideology and scaffolded by space fascists.

282
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,200
Save him, Rey. You know you want to.

283
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
It isn't too late.

284
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
Save him.

285
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,200
So, Kylo Ren is the epitome of everything that is fascist,

286
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,200
but fanfic-y about the First Order.

287
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,200
Kylo does not have an ideology outside of the ideology of the self,

288
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,200
which puts him somewhat at odds with real world fascists.

289
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,200
You can't have a cult of heroism if you don't particularly care about being a hero.

290
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,200
If you've ever run into any identitarians,

291
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,200
you may note that when they do tend to fall to the dark side,

292
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,200
they also tend to adhere to a certain set of ideologies,

293
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,200
usually having to do with race, nationality,

294
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,200
protecting the people from some amorphous foreign threat,

295
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,200
and white women being obedient broodmares.

296
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,200
But all it really does is give a sense of purpose to this sort of amorphous rage

297
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,200
felt by the Ur-fascist, which the fascist power structure can now exploit.

298
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,200
The relationship between Snoke and Kylo Ren actually illustrates this really well.

299
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,200
This is also why Kylo Ren disposes of Snoke so easily.

300
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,200
His ideology doesn't matter.

301
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,200
So obviously the First Order doesn't need to mirror real world fascists

302
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,200
in order to have their own brand of fictional fascism.

303
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:55,200
Maybe instead of the cultural Marxists masterminding multiculturalism,

304
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,200
they're scapegoating aliens or something.

305
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,200
Those goddamn wookies are taking our jobs!

306
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,200
A scapegoat for some social problem, real or imagined,

307
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,200
is integral for the rise of fascist power structures.

308
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,200
That undercurrent is there in some of the extended universe books,

309
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
particularly the original Thrawn trilogy.

310
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,200
But those books are no longer considered canon,

311
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,200
and that still doesn't shed any light on what the First Order wants or believes.

312
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,200
The closest in this new canon we've seen to actually exploring the ideology of the First Order

313
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,200
was the book Bloodline by Claudia Gray,

314
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,200
wherein the divide in the new liberal republic is between the populists and the centrists.

315
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,200
And in the Star Wars universe, those words do not mean at all what they mean in our universe.

316
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,200
So this gets really confusing.

317
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,200
The pre-First Order political divide in the Star Wars universe

318
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,200
is more akin to the political divide between Alexander Hamilton's Federalists

319
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,200
and Thomas Jefferson's Democratic Republicans,

320
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,200
with Princess Leia on the Jeffersonian side as a populist.

321
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,200
Again, this term does not mean what it means in our political discourse,

322
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
and it's really confusing.

323
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,200
And with her on-again, off-again rival Ranson Kvsterfo

324
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,200
on the Hamiltonian side as a centrist.

325
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,200
He wants a stronger central government.

326
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
I wish they had chosen different names.

327
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,200
The populists are more like a states' rights crowd.

328
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,200
They want the planets to be more autonomous,

329
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,200
and the centrists favor a stronger central government.

330
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:15,200
And no one realizes that a fair chunk of the Hamiltonian centrists are actually closet fascists.

331
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,200
And like with the prequels, there is some mundane conflict

332
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,200
that the fascists can exploit in order to consolidate power.

333
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,200
The point I'm making here is that it is actually kind of difficult

334
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,200
to demonstrate how fascist ideologies gain traction in society and fiction.

335
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,200
But with all that said, we don't learn a whole lot about their ideology

336
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,200
other than the typical Star Wars powers for powers' sake

337
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,200
and, you know, hate and dark side and all that.

338
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,200
In part because said ideology could be hashtag too real

339
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,200
and read as flippant or offensive,

340
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,200
but also because the underlying ideology is never logical.

341
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Revenge of the Sith actually demonstrates that really well.

342
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,200
So if you're going to try and make, like, pajamas and plush toys

343
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200
out of your space fascists,

344
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,200
it does make sense that you'd probably just want to skip all that

345
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,200
and just get right to the totalitarianism part.

346
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,200
So let's go back to Kylo Ren.

347
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,200
What was it about the ideology of the First Order that appeals to him?

348
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,200
Was he worried about alien multiculturalism

349
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,200
leading to the eventual demise of the human race?

350
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,200
No, he's disappointed in his father.

351
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,200
And his father figure.

352
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,200
I guess Luke made a boo-boo and thought about killing him for a second,

353
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:24,200
but Kylo Ren didn't join the fascists because he was seduced by fascist ideology.

354
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Kylo Ren is a fascist figurehead out of spite.

355
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,200
The Supreme Leader is dead.

356
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,200
Long live the Supreme Leader.

357
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,200
The Last Jedi shows that Kylo Ren doesn't really care about enriching any side

358
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,200
other than whatever side will best empower him,

359
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,200
which goes to show that he has no ideology to defend because he doesn't care

360
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,200
and possibly because there is no ideology to defend.

361
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,200
I think this also speaks to some of the disappointment with Snoke.

362
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,200
The Emperor was good at stoking fear and exploiting it,

363
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,200
a common authoritarian tactic, but Snoke?

364
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,200
What does he even want?

365
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,200
The Supreme Leader is wise.

366
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Snoke is using you for your power.

367
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,200
The seed of the Jedi Order lives.

368
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,200
As long as it does, hope lives.

369
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,200
In the end, Kylo Ren is willing to dispatch with his old master.

370
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,200
Basically on a whim.

371
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,200
Because Snoke's ideology is not worth fighting for.

372
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,200
Because it doesn't exist.

373
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Routing around back to Umberto Eco,

374
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,200
one concept of fascism is that it idealizes this concept of some savior,

375
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,200
or what Eco refers to as the Ur-Fascist hero.

376
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,200
Says Eco,

377
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,200
In non-fascist societies, the lay public is told that death is unpleasant,

378
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
must be faced with dignity,

379
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,200
believers are told that it is the painful way to reach a supernatural happiness.

380
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,200
By contrast, the Ur-Fascist hero craves heroic death,

381
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,200
advertised as the best reward for a heroic life.

382
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
The Ur-Fascist hero is impatient to die.

383
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,200
In his impatience, he more frequently sends other people to death.

384
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,200
Since permanent war and heroism are difficult games to play,

385
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,200
the Ur-Fascist transfer his will to power to sexual matters.

386
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,200
This is the origin of machismo,

387
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,200
which implies both disdain for women

388
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,200
and intolerance and condemnation of non-standard sexual habits,

389
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
from chastity to homosexuality.

390
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Since even sex is a difficult game to play,

391
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,200
the Ur-Fascist hero tends to play with weapons,

392
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,200
doing so becomes an ersatzphalic exercise.

393
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,200
So, before Luke's oopsie daisy,

394
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,200
Kylo Ren is essentially the proto-fascist Klay,

395
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,200
the raw anger and resentment before it has been given a target.

396
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,200
This is all part and parcel with the actual narrative trajectory of the trilogy,

397
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,200
where Ben is savable in part because he lacks ideology.

398
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,200
However, even in that, he still embodies Eco's description of Ur-Fascism

399
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,200
as a non-ideology of action for action's sake.

400
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,200
So, what does the First Order want?

401
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
It could be that the movies go out of their way not to say

402
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
because then it would be hashtag too real

403
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,200
and we can't put Captain Phasma on t-shirts.

404
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
Or, and I'm about to give Disney way too much credit,

405
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,200
there could be a deeper understanding at play

406
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,200
that the ideology doesn't actually matter,

407
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
and that's kind of the point.

408
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,200
Perhaps the error is in trying to apply logic to an inherently non-logical ideology.

409
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,200
Again, according to Eco,

410
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,200
Nazism had a really clear-cut ideology,

411
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,200
but concurrent Italian fascism under Mussolini did not,

412
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,200
and the First Order also borrows heavily from those aesthetics.

413
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,200
In Eco's words,

414
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,200
Contrary to common opinion, fascism in Italy had no special philosophy.

415
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
Mussolini did not have any philosophy.

416
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,200
He only had rhetoric.

417
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,200
In his early anti-clerical years, according to a likely legend,

418
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,200
he once asked God in order to prove his existence to strike him down on the spot.

419
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,200
Later, Mussolini always cited the name of God in his speeches

420
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,200
and did not mind being called the Man of Providence.

421
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,200
So on the one hand, it's not unfair to point out that with fascism,

422
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
ideology is only a means to an end,

423
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,200
and the end is the quashing of dissent, stamping out diversity,

424
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,200
heroes in heroic death, and strict totalitarianism.

425
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
Star Wars has always understood that much.

426
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,200
Bad guys employing horrible acts we see mirrored in the real world,

427
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,200
but shifting them just far enough from real-world atrocities

428
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,200
that we can merchandise the villains almost as much as we merchandise the heroes.

429
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
We see this in the likes of Thanos as well.

430
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
He's a genocidal monster, sure,

431
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,200
but, you know, at least he goes by random coin toss for who he kills.

432
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,200
Some of the time.

433
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,200
See, he doesn't target specific ethnic groups like real genociders do.

434
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,200
He's an egalitarian genocidal monster.

435
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,200
He's complex.

436
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,200
To quote Eco again,

437
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,200
all the elements of any later form of totalitarianism.

438
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,200
On the contrary, fascism had no quintessence.

439
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,200
Fascism was a fuzzy totalitarianism,

440
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,200
a collage of different philosophical and political ideas,

441
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
a beehive of contradictions.

442
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,200
So it could be that they're being lazy and playing it safe

443
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
so they can sell more stuff, but who knows?

444
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,200
Maybe deep down, Disney understands this.

445
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,200
And that's what makes this family-friendly type of fascism

446
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,200
so easy to brand and to sell.

447
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,200
So... who cares?

448
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,200
Part of the problem with applying even a very modest set of academic theory

449
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:15,200
to a pop culture thing is then we get some hand wringing over the inevitable moralizing

450
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
and it also begs the question,

451
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,200
well, what do you want me to do about it?

452
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,200
Not own Darth Vader pajamas?

453
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,200
When that is not the point, the point is to examine the context of the thing,

454
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,200
and demand that Disney make their villains less fashy.

455
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Fictional villains always draw inspiration from real-world bad things,

456
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
and that's fine.

457
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,200
That said, I do think it's worth examining how the portrayal of the dark side has changed

458
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
since Disney got a hold of it,

459
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,200
that the filmmakers decided to lean into the fashy imagery rather than away from it.

460
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:55,200
And yes, Star Wars merchandising has always, always heavily relied on marketing bad characters

461
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,200
like Darth Vader and Boba Fett in order to help earn that sweet green.

462
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,200
But the significance of iconography can shift over time,

463
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,200
and I do think it's worth examining the difference of selling cute, fashy bad guy characters in 1977

464
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,200
and selling the same in 2018.

465
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:33,200
Thanks for watching!
