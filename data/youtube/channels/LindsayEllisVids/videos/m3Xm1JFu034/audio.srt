1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,160
English Mojito.

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,160
Look it's green.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,920
It'll make this whole experience better, just like in the book.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:21,440
So today's concoction is an English Mojito, because the author of this week's book is

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,440
British.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,440
Really, really British.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:34,240
And it's green, which in the book that we read, is like the happy color, the happy calming

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,240
color.

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,640
It's the one that you get high off of.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,480
So I don't know if we mentioned this, I think we did.

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,280
The way we do this is we don't discuss this ahead of time.

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:52,280
So it's kind of like a fairy tale curse, that if we mention the thing, we can't mention

13
00:00:52,280 --> 00:01:00,320
the thing, just so our discussion of the thing is a lot more authentic.

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,800
And this week we definitely haven't discussed the thing.

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:10,920
We also have a policy here on Booze Your Own Adventure that we don't say anything in our

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,840
reviews that we would not say to the author's face.

17
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,960
Because we are writers of a sort, we know how hard it is, and we know how shitty it

18
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:26,280
is when like some two-bit nobody just shows up all like, I'm gonna talk about your thing

19
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,280
person.

20
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:35,560
So today we're discussing Shades of Grey, of an indeterminate number of shades of grey,

21
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,720
by Jasper Ford.

22
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,440
It is a dystopian thing written for an adult audience.

23
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,920
Nella, what did you think of Shades of Grey?

24
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,920
I liked it.

25
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,680
Wait, hear me out!

26
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,560
I don't like the movie Brazil that much.

27
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,760
This felt like Brazil.

28
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,200
I liked it better than Brazil.

29
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,240
I would recommend it to people who liked Brazil.

30
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:19,720
I'd read the sequels, but it was definitely a book that meandered a lot throughout its

31
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,560
world building.

32
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,080
And the last quarter of the book decided, oh right, we've built up this world, let's

33
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,880
get to what's actually wrong with it and why our character should care.

34
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:37,600
Also, I'm sure we're gonna talk about female character.

35
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,360
This made me never want to read another book again.

36
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:49,200
The thing I hated about it was the process of reading the words.

37
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:56,440
On a concept level, if someone had described it to me, I'd be like, okay, that's a book.

38
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,920
But as I was reading it, I derived no enjoyment from it.

39
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,280
It felt like I couldn't remember why I enjoyed reading.

40
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
Period.

41
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,280
Wow.

42
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,280
Wow.

43
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,920
I'm sure Mr. Ford is a lovely person.

44
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,400
Let's start with the schtick, which is in this dystopian world, which takes place about

45
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,880
500 years after what would be our civilization.

46
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,280
We never find out the something that happened, right?

47
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,880
Or we haven't found out yet because this is what I hated.

48
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,280
It's a trilogy.

49
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,080
I just wanted a book that ended and it's about the halfway point I was like, there's no way

50
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,120
we can resolve this all in one book.

51
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,120
Surely, surely.

52
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,120
Oh no, is it?

53
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,120
Is it?

54
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,720
And then the last 20 pages, as it rushed to the end, I was like, oh God, here it comes.

55
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,320
Here it comes.

56
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,440
Sequel.

57
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,400
Be sure to read more in the next book.

58
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,600
But talking about the schtick of the book, that in this dystopian future, society is

59
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,040
based on people's perceptions of color.

60
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,160
So you are a color.

61
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:12,880
You can only see one natural color and then synthetic color is used to great extent.

62
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,160
When I was in high school, I read Brave New World and I liked it.

63
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,280
This was like if Brave New World didn't have a point or it did have a point, but the point

64
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:28,400
was like less sophisticated than we get in young adult dystopias.

65
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,640
Well, cause it's a point that's been done.

66
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,640
Well, yeah.

67
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,760
And I was like, every time it would like, I mean, it has a very glib sense of humor

68
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,960
so we can kind of sidestep that criticism, I guess, sort of, but it still had that underlying

69
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,960
tone of like conformity bad.

70
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:48,960
And it's like, this came out in 2009.

71
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,320
This is a little old, you guys.

72
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,480
And I was like waiting for it to add to that because it was so boring.

73
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,880
And the thing is, usually like Divergent, I gave Divergent a lot of shit.

74
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,320
I like Divergent better than this.

75
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,640
This is how much I hated this book.

76
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,640
Wow.

77
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,480
Divergent, the dystopia of Divergent was really kind of not about anything.

78
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:21,760
Like you could really stretch it and say it's about like high school cliques, but it wasn't,

79
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,400
it was a story first, you know, and I guess any kind of like social commentary was like,

80
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,120
they like wafted it over the book and said like, here's some commentary, sort of, not

81
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
really.

82
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
It wasn't meant to be a commentary.

83
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,120
Yeah.

84
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,920
So, I mean, like, I still maintain that Divergent's not good, but it had a story with tension

85
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,720
and characters.

86
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,600
And this, and this reminds me of like an io9 review I read of The Bone Season where it

87
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,000
was like world building for the sake of world building.

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And I kept imagining like Frank Underwood turning to the camera as the narrator repeatedly

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,200
explained the world to us, like a thing would happen.

90
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,360
And then he'd be like, oh, well, you know, this swatch is like the duh-duh-duh, and then

91
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,200
we have to do this thing over here in order to get our swatches.

92
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,200
And it was just like the most clunky, unnatural world building I can remember.

93
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,340
Usually world building is done with action.

94
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,840
Usually world building is done with a thing that happens, not the narrator constantly

95
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,200
over and over to the point of like, is this a parody?

96
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,880
It felt so British.

97
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,480
It did feel really British.

98
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:32,120
And like the, the elements of the dystopia, like it felt like a sort of like a BuzzFeed

99
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,840
article, you know, you're British if, you know, like all of the elements of the dystopia

100
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,680
where people, you know, there'd be like an uncomfortable thing in the room and we got

101
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,160
to pretend like it's not there because Britain, you know, like stuff like that.

102
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,160
And I was like...

103
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,160
The hyper-politeness.

104
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,160
Yeah.

105
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,160
So it felt very British in that way.

106
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,400
But that's not a bad thing.

107
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,560
The world building and the way it was done, I thought was a bad thing because it was not,

108
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,080
I mean, it's sort of like show, don't tell.

109
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,240
It was so telly.

110
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,500
It was maddeningly telly.

111
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,120
And it's like he could construct a sentence okay, and like sometimes slip a joke in there.

112
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,120
I liked the risk joke.

113
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,120
It was a good one.

114
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,440
It was a good one.

115
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,840
Good as a stretch.

116
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,600
And the second the main love interest shows up, I was like uh-oh, we got a strong female

117
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,080
character on our hands.

118
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,400
She threatened to punch me.

119
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,800
I dig that.

120
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,000
With that nose she has.

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Dat nose.

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
She hits people.

123
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yeah.

124
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
She's not a nice person.

125
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Filter.

126
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,360
She hits him constantly.

127
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,960
And he's charmed by this.

128
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,400
As men are wont to do.

129
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,160
I mean I just, every fucking sentence of this god forsaken character, I kept envisioning

130
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,760
like the Kate Beaton strong female character.

131
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,360
I don't need no man.

132
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,040
There's just something about this incredibly weak male lead.

133
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,040
Oh my god.

134
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,160
He was such an incredibly weak male lead.

135
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,440
I mean this is like why I hated American Gods.

136
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,760
There was no driving tension.

137
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,840
He doesn't want anything.

138
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,400
And I mean you're just like, you're reading a book with no driving tension.

139
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,320
No, it's all about, he just wants to actually win the other girl back at home.

140
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,320
But there's not a driving tension.

141
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,760
That's like a subplot.

142
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,320
That's barely a subplot.

143
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,320
So there's driving tension not really in the subplot, where he kind of nonchalantly, indifferently

144
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,840
kind of likes a girl back home, but he doesn't seem to care about anything.

145
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,520
And I cannot stand when your protagonist doesn't care about anything, and if your protagonist

146
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,000
does not care about anything, your world building had better goddamn well be the most fucking

147
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,640
interesting thing imaginable.

148
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,000
Like I was just sort of thinking like, if this was written as a YA, she would have been

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,160
the lead and it would have been from the Grey's perspective, I feel.

150
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:50,120
If you like Brazil and British long-dragging politeness.

151
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,320
Frank Underwood turning to the camera and explaining everything to you rather than showing

152
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,320
it.

153
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,280
No, at least Frank Underwood is actually like really super enjoyable when he does that.

154
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,040
He's Richard III.

155
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,040
That's why it's worth.

156
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,040
How does this have such a high rating on Goodreads?

157
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,320
Seriously, if you like Brazil, you'll like this.

158
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:21,240
I can see liking this if you like the tone, and tone is like why you read things.

159
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,960
And because as I was reading it, I was just like, my problem was I was just so bored by

160
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,440
the world building.

161
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,000
I was just like, there's no point to this dystopia.

162
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,280
And that would be fine if there was a story or a driving tension, technically, I mean

163
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,120
I wouldn't even call it a story, it's just like one guy putters around for a few days

164
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,120
and then discovers a thing.

165
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,840
He shoves it all in the last fourth of the book.

166
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,840
Yeah.

167
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,200
On the whole, I think I really do enjoy YA more than this whole adult shit.

168
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Well in terms of dystopia?

169
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
Yeah.

170
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,720
Because that was my point, it's kind of really hard to make a grand sweeping gesture by way

171
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,760
of allegory about society anymore.

172
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,120
I mean the Hunger Games did it really well because it kind of hit on something new, being

173
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,720
reality shows, which didn't exist in Aldous Huxley's time.

174
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,160
But even you look at something like Brave New World, which still feels like it has relevance

175
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,200
because it has so much to do with the society numbing you.

176
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,520
And also the Munsell.

177
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,040
Oh, Munsell is a color chart, I used it in Archeology.

178
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,360
It has a whole, it just pretty much has a shit ton of color swatches.

179
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,360
Well see, that's clever.

180
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,360
Well yeah, that's what I, like the whole-

181
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,400
Okay, I'm trying to think of something nice to say about this guy.

182
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
And also the test-

183
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,360
I was just like, I gotta find something nice to say about this, he clearly thought a lot

184
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
about this.

185
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,360
No!

186
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,360
I was just so unhappy.

187
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,000
And the test that they take to determine what their color percentage in vision is, is the

188
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,280
name of the guy who came up with the color blind test and shit.

189
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,280
Oh, the Ishihara.

190
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,280
Yeah.

191
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,280
So you knew this?

192
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,280
Yeah.

193
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
Or you looked it up?

194
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
No, I knew it.

195
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,280
So you knew this, and I didn't.

196
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,280
And I didn't really think about that.

197
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,280
But that is clever, now that I know that.

198
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,280
See, I said a nice thing.

199
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,320
I said a nice thing about this book I hated.

200
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,880
I think that's what kept me going, is that I did enjoy how much obvious thought he put

201
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,920
into this world and forcing it to work in this shtick.

202
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:18,720
Well, I mean, I thought the world in itself was not the problem, the problem was the way

203
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,040
it was presented.

204
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,560
I really wish Jane had not been the way she was.

205
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,120
I mean, I wish everything about the story.

206
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,760
I mean, I hated the main character, it was so fucking hackneyed, their way, this strong

207
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,560
female character, I'm a huge bitch, I need to be tamed, I'm sick of that.

208
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,560
You know?

209
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,560
Yeah.

210
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,800
And it was just like, from the second she's on screen and the first thing she does is

211
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,160
threaten to harm him, it's like, really?

212
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,160
Really?

213
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,360
We've written how many books, and we're going here?

214
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,240
How fucking hackneyed is that?

215
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,480
And it's sexist as shit, you know?

216
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,960
We're taming the shrew again.

217
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,520
We should be past this.

218
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:57,400
I mean, that would be fine if she was an interesting and well-rounded character, but she's not.

219
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:02,120
And obviously, some people will disagree, and that's fine, but a compelling narrative

220
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:07,960
is generally, and you look at Dexter in Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad, and it's like,

221
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,760
a compelling character is not someone who is good.

222
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,760
A compelling character is a driven character.

223
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,720
And I hold to this.

224
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,240
That's why I like Game of Thrones.

225
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,920
Everybody is very driven, you know?

226
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,200
And they're all differently driven, and that's what makes it interesting.

227
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,520
Like, in this book, there was no single character that was driven, and in YA, you tend to be

228
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,240
very driven because it's like, teenagers, and they want, you know, they want to find

229
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,000
their place in society, they want to do the thing, they want to be the king, you know,

230
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
whatever.

231
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,040
But Jane was driven.

232
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:43,280
Like, hackneyed though she was, and like, one-dimensional, but she was driven, but also

233
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,320
there was a sense that she didn't appreciate the danger she was in, because she's the lowest

234
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:55,840
class of, she's a Grey, they're pretty much the slave class, like, she's constantly pissing

235
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
everyone off.

236
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,360
But she is the Kate Beatonian strong female character.

237
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,200
Everyone's always talking about how they can't wait till, like, they can throw her out to

238
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,600
like, to be rebooted, like, which is a thing in this world, which, you know, ends up being

239
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
something else.

240
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:16,480
But, but she has no concept of, because she's got it all figured out, so she has no fear

241
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,160
of what they can throw at her.

242
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,360
So there's no tension for her.

243
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,360
So for her, there's no tension.

244
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,160
So it's like, even though she's driven, there's no stakes.

245
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,120
I, like I said, I, I liked it.

246
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,040
I didn't want to gorge my eyes out afterwards.

247
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,040
I went, hmm, that was alright.

248
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,360
I can't, like, it's like, sort of like one of those things where I kept thinking, like,

249
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:44,560
I guess he's not bad at writing, but I, everything I like about stories is absent.

250
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,760
I mean, I'm interested in checking out his other series, which is like a new war fairy

251
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,600
tale thing going on, or nursery rhyme thing.

252
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,360
But I'll do that on my own.

253
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,800
So next episode, I'm going to stop saying next week, because obviously we can't keep

254
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,560
Hey, you know, bro.

255
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,560
We busy.

256
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,560
What are you going to do?

257
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,560
Them full-time jobs.

258
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,560
Yeah.

259
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:11,200
So next episode, we're going to be discussing the outline for Viridian Saga Book 2, but

260
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:17,920
the next book thing, so, so we're going to be doing something special episode after next.

261
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,240
We're actually going to have a guest author who was, for realsies, published author.

262
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,360
Not that you self-published her, not really.

263
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,280
She went through the agony of, you know, the industry.

264
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:35,920
Her name is also Lindsay, and she wrote a book called The Art of Wishing, which is YA,

265
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,680
thank Christ, paranormal romance type thing.

266
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,000
And it is, I'm told it's about genies.

267
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,320
So I'm going to do that one with Lisa.

268
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,080
Lisa's going to be filling in for Nella.

269
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:58,200
And after that, yes, we will read the goddamn Kardashian sister YA novel.

270
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,080
And that is how I will punish you.

271
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:09,280
And also down the pipe, I have an ARC of John Scalzi's new book.

272
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:15,080
So we will probably go ahead and, yeah, he signed it for me, see?

273
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,080
Aw, yay.

274
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:22,040
I got a signature from that thing that you didn't get to go to.

275
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,560
Ooh, it has to do with highly contagious viruses.

276
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,880
This is right up my alley.

277
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:32,360
But we're going to try something new after we do The Art of Wishing, which will be the

278
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:38,240
next review, and of course the Kendall and Kylie Jenner book.

279
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,240
What was it?

280
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:45,880
Rebels, colon, City of Indra, colon, the story of, like, it has two colons.

281
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,800
And then we're going to actually review a thing that has not come out yet.

282
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,760
So we're going to review a thing before it comes out.

283
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,720
Like the real, like actual book reviewers.

284
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
Like actual critics.

285
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,720
It's exciting.

286
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720
So yeah.

287
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:05,720
So I hope you enjoyed my suffering, because I'm going to enjoy yours.

288
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,480
Till the next time.
