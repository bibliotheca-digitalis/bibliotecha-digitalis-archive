WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.160
English Mojito.

00:07.160 --> 00:08.160
Look it's green.

00:08.160 --> 00:13.920
It'll make this whole experience better, just like in the book.

00:13.920 --> 00:21.440
So today's concoction is an English Mojito, because the author of this week's book is

00:21.440 --> 00:22.440
British.

00:22.440 --> 00:25.440
Really, really British.

00:25.440 --> 00:34.240
And it's green, which in the book that we read, is like the happy color, the happy calming

00:34.240 --> 00:35.240
color.

00:35.240 --> 00:37.640
It's the one that you get high off of.

00:37.640 --> 00:40.480
So I don't know if we mentioned this, I think we did.

00:40.480 --> 00:45.280
The way we do this is we don't discuss this ahead of time.

00:45.280 --> 00:52.280
So it's kind of like a fairy tale curse, that if we mention the thing, we can't mention

00:52.280 --> 01:00.320
the thing, just so our discussion of the thing is a lot more authentic.

01:00.320 --> 01:03.800
And this week we definitely haven't discussed the thing.

01:03.800 --> 01:10.920
We also have a policy here on Booze Your Own Adventure that we don't say anything in our

01:10.920 --> 01:15.840
reviews that we would not say to the author's face.

01:15.840 --> 01:19.960
Because we are writers of a sort, we know how hard it is, and we know how shitty it

01:19.960 --> 01:26.280
is when like some two-bit nobody just shows up all like, I'm gonna talk about your thing

01:26.280 --> 01:27.280
person.

01:27.280 --> 01:35.560
So today we're discussing Shades of Grey, of an indeterminate number of shades of grey,

01:35.560 --> 01:38.720
by Jasper Ford.

01:38.720 --> 01:44.440
It is a dystopian thing written for an adult audience.

01:44.440 --> 01:49.920
Nella, what did you think of Shades of Grey?

01:50.920 --> 01:55.920
I liked it.

01:55.920 --> 01:58.680
Wait, hear me out!

01:58.680 --> 02:02.560
I don't like the movie Brazil that much.

02:02.560 --> 02:04.760
This felt like Brazil.

02:04.760 --> 02:07.200
I liked it better than Brazil.

02:07.200 --> 02:12.240
I would recommend it to people who liked Brazil.

02:12.240 --> 02:19.720
I'd read the sequels, but it was definitely a book that meandered a lot throughout its

02:19.720 --> 02:21.560
world building.

02:21.560 --> 02:26.080
And the last quarter of the book decided, oh right, we've built up this world, let's

02:26.080 --> 02:29.880
get to what's actually wrong with it and why our character should care.

02:29.880 --> 02:37.600
Also, I'm sure we're gonna talk about female character.

02:37.600 --> 02:42.360
This made me never want to read another book again.

02:42.360 --> 02:49.200
The thing I hated about it was the process of reading the words.

02:49.200 --> 02:56.440
On a concept level, if someone had described it to me, I'd be like, okay, that's a book.

02:56.440 --> 03:00.920
But as I was reading it, I derived no enjoyment from it.

03:00.920 --> 03:06.280
It felt like I couldn't remember why I enjoyed reading.

03:06.280 --> 03:07.280
Period.

03:07.280 --> 03:08.280
Wow.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.280
Wow.

03:09.280 --> 03:12.920
I'm sure Mr. Ford is a lovely person.

03:12.920 --> 03:18.400
Let's start with the schtick, which is in this dystopian world, which takes place about

03:18.400 --> 03:24.880
500 years after what would be our civilization.

03:24.880 --> 03:26.280
We never find out the something that happened, right?

03:26.280 --> 03:29.880
Or we haven't found out yet because this is what I hated.

03:29.880 --> 03:31.280
It's a trilogy.

03:31.280 --> 03:36.080
I just wanted a book that ended and it's about the halfway point I was like, there's no way

03:36.080 --> 03:38.120
we can resolve this all in one book.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.120
Surely, surely.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.120
Oh no, is it?

03:40.120 --> 03:41.120
Is it?

03:41.120 --> 03:44.720
And then the last 20 pages, as it rushed to the end, I was like, oh God, here it comes.

03:44.720 --> 03:46.320
Here it comes.

03:46.320 --> 03:47.440
Sequel.

03:47.440 --> 03:50.400
Be sure to read more in the next book.

03:50.400 --> 03:57.600
But talking about the schtick of the book, that in this dystopian future, society is

03:57.600 --> 04:01.040
based on people's perceptions of color.

04:01.040 --> 04:04.160
So you are a color.

04:04.160 --> 04:12.880
You can only see one natural color and then synthetic color is used to great extent.

04:12.880 --> 04:17.160
When I was in high school, I read Brave New World and I liked it.

04:17.160 --> 04:22.280
This was like if Brave New World didn't have a point or it did have a point, but the point

04:22.280 --> 04:28.400
was like less sophisticated than we get in young adult dystopias.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.640
Well, cause it's a point that's been done.

04:30.640 --> 04:31.640
Well, yeah.

04:31.640 --> 04:34.760
And I was like, every time it would like, I mean, it has a very glib sense of humor

04:34.760 --> 04:39.960
so we can kind of sidestep that criticism, I guess, sort of, but it still had that underlying

04:39.960 --> 04:41.960
tone of like conformity bad.

04:41.960 --> 04:48.960
And it's like, this came out in 2009.

04:48.960 --> 04:54.320
This is a little old, you guys.

04:54.320 --> 05:00.480
And I was like waiting for it to add to that because it was so boring.

05:00.480 --> 05:04.880
And the thing is, usually like Divergent, I gave Divergent a lot of shit.

05:04.880 --> 05:06.320
I like Divergent better than this.

05:06.320 --> 05:08.640
This is how much I hated this book.

05:08.640 --> 05:09.640
Wow.

05:09.640 --> 05:14.480
Divergent, the dystopia of Divergent was really kind of not about anything.

05:14.840 --> 05:21.760
Like you could really stretch it and say it's about like high school cliques, but it wasn't,

05:21.760 --> 05:26.400
it was a story first, you know, and I guess any kind of like social commentary was like,

05:26.400 --> 05:31.120
they like wafted it over the book and said like, here's some commentary, sort of, not

05:31.120 --> 05:32.120
really.

05:32.120 --> 05:33.120
It wasn't meant to be a commentary.

05:33.120 --> 05:34.120
Yeah.

05:34.120 --> 05:39.920
So, I mean, like, I still maintain that Divergent's not good, but it had a story with tension

05:39.920 --> 05:41.720
and characters.

05:41.720 --> 05:45.600
And this, and this reminds me of like an io9 review I read of The Bone Season where it

05:45.600 --> 05:50.000
was like world building for the sake of world building.

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
And I kept imagining like Frank Underwood turning to the camera as the narrator repeatedly

05:56.000 --> 05:59.200
explained the world to us, like a thing would happen.

05:59.200 --> 06:02.360
And then he'd be like, oh, well, you know, this swatch is like the duh-duh-duh, and then

06:02.360 --> 06:05.200
we have to do this thing over here in order to get our swatches.

06:05.200 --> 06:10.200
And it was just like the most clunky, unnatural world building I can remember.

06:10.200 --> 06:14.340
Usually world building is done with action.

06:14.340 --> 06:19.840
Usually world building is done with a thing that happens, not the narrator constantly

06:19.840 --> 06:23.200
over and over to the point of like, is this a parody?

06:23.200 --> 06:24.880
It felt so British.

06:24.880 --> 06:26.480
It did feel really British.

06:26.480 --> 06:32.120
And like the, the elements of the dystopia, like it felt like a sort of like a BuzzFeed

06:32.120 --> 06:36.840
article, you know, you're British if, you know, like all of the elements of the dystopia

06:36.840 --> 06:40.680
where people, you know, there'd be like an uncomfortable thing in the room and we got

06:40.680 --> 06:44.160
to pretend like it's not there because Britain, you know, like stuff like that.

06:44.160 --> 06:45.160
And I was like...

06:45.160 --> 06:46.160
The hyper-politeness.

06:46.160 --> 06:47.160
Yeah.

06:47.160 --> 06:48.160
So it felt very British in that way.

06:48.160 --> 06:49.400
But that's not a bad thing.

06:49.400 --> 06:52.560
The world building and the way it was done, I thought was a bad thing because it was not,

06:52.560 --> 06:55.080
I mean, it's sort of like show, don't tell.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.240
It was so telly.

06:56.240 --> 06:58.500
It was maddeningly telly.

06:58.500 --> 07:03.120
And it's like he could construct a sentence okay, and like sometimes slip a joke in there.

07:03.120 --> 07:04.120
I liked the risk joke.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.120
It was a good one.

07:05.440 --> 07:07.440
It was a good one.

07:07.440 --> 07:09.840
Good as a stretch.

07:09.840 --> 07:16.600
And the second the main love interest shows up, I was like uh-oh, we got a strong female

07:16.600 --> 07:20.080
character on our hands.

07:20.080 --> 07:22.400
She threatened to punch me.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.800
I dig that.

07:24.800 --> 07:29.000
With that nose she has.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Dat nose.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
She hits people.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Yeah.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
She's not a nice person.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Filter.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.360
She hits him constantly.

07:35.360 --> 07:36.960
And he's charmed by this.

07:36.960 --> 07:38.400
As men are wont to do.

07:38.400 --> 07:44.160
I mean I just, every fucking sentence of this god forsaken character, I kept envisioning

07:44.160 --> 07:46.760
like the Kate Beaton strong female character.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.360
I don't need no man.

07:48.360 --> 07:51.040
There's just something about this incredibly weak male lead.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.040
Oh my god.

07:52.040 --> 07:54.160
He was such an incredibly weak male lead.

07:54.160 --> 07:56.440
I mean this is like why I hated American Gods.

07:56.440 --> 07:57.760
There was no driving tension.

07:57.760 --> 07:59.840
He doesn't want anything.

07:59.840 --> 08:03.400
And I mean you're just like, you're reading a book with no driving tension.

08:03.800 --> 08:08.320
No, it's all about, he just wants to actually win the other girl back at home.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.320
But there's not a driving tension.

08:10.320 --> 08:11.760
That's like a subplot.

08:11.760 --> 08:15.320
That's barely a subplot.

08:15.320 --> 08:19.320
So there's driving tension not really in the subplot, where he kind of nonchalantly, indifferently

08:19.320 --> 08:23.840
kind of likes a girl back home, but he doesn't seem to care about anything.

08:23.840 --> 08:28.520
And I cannot stand when your protagonist doesn't care about anything, and if your protagonist

08:28.520 --> 08:33.000
does not care about anything, your world building had better goddamn well be the most fucking

08:33.000 --> 08:35.640
interesting thing imaginable.

08:35.640 --> 08:39.000
Like I was just sort of thinking like, if this was written as a YA, she would have been

08:39.000 --> 08:43.160
the lead and it would have been from the Grey's perspective, I feel.

08:43.160 --> 08:50.120
If you like Brazil and British long-dragging politeness.

08:50.120 --> 08:55.320
Frank Underwood turning to the camera and explaining everything to you rather than showing

08:55.320 --> 08:56.320
it.

08:56.320 --> 09:02.280
No, at least Frank Underwood is actually like really super enjoyable when he does that.

09:03.040 --> 09:04.040
He's Richard III.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.040
That's why it's worth.

09:05.040 --> 09:10.040
How does this have such a high rating on Goodreads?

09:10.040 --> 09:12.320
Seriously, if you like Brazil, you'll like this.

09:12.320 --> 09:21.240
I can see liking this if you like the tone, and tone is like why you read things.

09:21.240 --> 09:26.960
And because as I was reading it, I was just like, my problem was I was just so bored by

09:26.960 --> 09:28.440
the world building.

09:28.480 --> 09:33.000
I was just like, there's no point to this dystopia.

09:33.000 --> 09:39.280
And that would be fine if there was a story or a driving tension, technically, I mean

09:39.280 --> 09:44.120
I wouldn't even call it a story, it's just like one guy putters around for a few days

09:44.120 --> 09:45.120
and then discovers a thing.

09:45.120 --> 09:46.840
He shoves it all in the last fourth of the book.

09:46.840 --> 09:47.840
Yeah.

09:47.840 --> 09:52.200
On the whole, I think I really do enjoy YA more than this whole adult shit.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.200
Well in terms of dystopia?

09:53.960 --> 09:54.960
Yeah.

09:54.960 --> 09:59.720
Because that was my point, it's kind of really hard to make a grand sweeping gesture by way

09:59.720 --> 10:02.760
of allegory about society anymore.

10:02.760 --> 10:07.120
I mean the Hunger Games did it really well because it kind of hit on something new, being

10:07.120 --> 10:11.720
reality shows, which didn't exist in Aldous Huxley's time.

10:11.720 --> 10:15.160
But even you look at something like Brave New World, which still feels like it has relevance

10:15.160 --> 10:19.200
because it has so much to do with the society numbing you.

10:19.520 --> 10:21.520
And also the Munsell.

10:21.520 --> 10:26.040
Oh, Munsell is a color chart, I used it in Archeology.

10:26.040 --> 10:29.360
It has a whole, it just pretty much has a shit ton of color swatches.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.360
Well see, that's clever.

10:30.360 --> 10:31.360
Well yeah, that's what I, like the whole-

10:31.360 --> 10:34.400
Okay, I'm trying to think of something nice to say about this guy.

10:34.400 --> 10:35.400
And also the test-

10:35.400 --> 10:38.360
I was just like, I gotta find something nice to say about this, he clearly thought a lot

10:38.360 --> 10:39.360
about this.

10:39.360 --> 10:40.360
No!

10:40.360 --> 10:41.360
I was just so unhappy.

10:41.360 --> 10:47.000
And the test that they take to determine what their color percentage in vision is, is the

10:47.000 --> 10:50.280
name of the guy who came up with the color blind test and shit.

10:50.280 --> 10:51.280
Oh, the Ishihara.

10:51.280 --> 10:52.280
Yeah.

10:52.280 --> 10:53.280
So you knew this?

10:53.280 --> 10:54.280
Yeah.

10:54.280 --> 10:55.280
Or you looked it up?

10:55.280 --> 10:56.280
No, I knew it.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.280
So you knew this, and I didn't.

10:57.280 --> 10:58.280
And I didn't really think about that.

10:58.280 --> 10:59.280
But that is clever, now that I know that.

10:59.280 --> 11:00.280
See, I said a nice thing.

11:00.280 --> 11:03.320
I said a nice thing about this book I hated.

11:03.320 --> 11:07.880
I think that's what kept me going, is that I did enjoy how much obvious thought he put

11:07.880 --> 11:12.920
into this world and forcing it to work in this shtick.

11:13.080 --> 11:18.720
Well, I mean, I thought the world in itself was not the problem, the problem was the way

11:18.720 --> 11:20.040
it was presented.

11:20.040 --> 11:22.560
I really wish Jane had not been the way she was.

11:22.560 --> 11:24.120
I mean, I wish everything about the story.

11:24.120 --> 11:28.760
I mean, I hated the main character, it was so fucking hackneyed, their way, this strong

11:28.760 --> 11:33.560
female character, I'm a huge bitch, I need to be tamed, I'm sick of that.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.560
You know?

11:34.560 --> 11:35.560
Yeah.

11:35.560 --> 11:38.800
And it was just like, from the second she's on screen and the first thing she does is

11:38.800 --> 11:41.160
threaten to harm him, it's like, really?

11:41.160 --> 11:42.160
Really?

11:42.400 --> 11:45.360
We've written how many books, and we're going here?

11:45.360 --> 11:47.240
How fucking hackneyed is that?

11:47.240 --> 11:49.480
And it's sexist as shit, you know?

11:49.480 --> 11:50.960
We're taming the shrew again.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.520
We should be past this.

11:52.520 --> 11:57.400
I mean, that would be fine if she was an interesting and well-rounded character, but she's not.

11:57.400 --> 12:02.120
And obviously, some people will disagree, and that's fine, but a compelling narrative

12:02.120 --> 12:07.960
is generally, and you look at Dexter in Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad, and it's like,

12:07.960 --> 12:11.760
a compelling character is not someone who is good.

12:11.760 --> 12:14.760
A compelling character is a driven character.

12:14.760 --> 12:17.720
And I hold to this.

12:17.720 --> 12:19.240
That's why I like Game of Thrones.

12:19.240 --> 12:21.920
Everybody is very driven, you know?

12:21.920 --> 12:24.200
And they're all differently driven, and that's what makes it interesting.

12:24.200 --> 12:28.520
Like, in this book, there was no single character that was driven, and in YA, you tend to be

12:28.520 --> 12:32.240
very driven because it's like, teenagers, and they want, you know, they want to find

12:32.240 --> 12:36.000
their place in society, they want to do the thing, they want to be the king, you know,

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
whatever.

12:37.040 --> 12:38.040
But Jane was driven.

12:38.040 --> 12:43.280
Like, hackneyed though she was, and like, one-dimensional, but she was driven, but also

12:43.280 --> 12:48.320
there was a sense that she didn't appreciate the danger she was in, because she's the lowest

12:48.320 --> 12:55.840
class of, she's a Grey, they're pretty much the slave class, like, she's constantly pissing

12:55.840 --> 12:56.840
everyone off.

12:56.840 --> 12:59.360
But she is the Kate Beatonian strong female character.

12:59.360 --> 13:03.200
Everyone's always talking about how they can't wait till, like, they can throw her out to

13:03.200 --> 13:08.600
like, to be rebooted, like, which is a thing in this world, which, you know, ends up being

13:08.600 --> 13:09.600
something else.

13:09.600 --> 13:16.480
But, but she has no concept of, because she's got it all figured out, so she has no fear

13:16.480 --> 13:18.160
of what they can throw at her.

13:18.160 --> 13:19.360
So there's no tension for her.

13:19.360 --> 13:20.360
So for her, there's no tension.

13:20.360 --> 13:23.160
So it's like, even though she's driven, there's no stakes.

13:23.160 --> 13:26.120
I, like I said, I, I liked it.

13:26.120 --> 13:29.040
I didn't want to gorge my eyes out afterwards.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.040
I went, hmm, that was alright.

13:30.360 --> 13:34.360
I can't, like, it's like, sort of like one of those things where I kept thinking, like,

13:34.360 --> 13:44.560
I guess he's not bad at writing, but I, everything I like about stories is absent.

13:44.560 --> 13:48.760
I mean, I'm interested in checking out his other series, which is like a new war fairy

13:48.760 --> 13:52.600
tale thing going on, or nursery rhyme thing.

13:52.600 --> 13:56.360
But I'll do that on my own.

13:56.360 --> 13:59.800
So next episode, I'm going to stop saying next week, because obviously we can't keep

14:00.560 --> 14:01.560
Hey, you know, bro.

14:01.560 --> 14:02.560
We busy.

14:02.560 --> 14:03.560
What are you going to do?

14:03.560 --> 14:04.560
Them full-time jobs.

14:04.560 --> 14:05.560
Yeah.

14:05.560 --> 14:11.200
So next episode, we're going to be discussing the outline for Viridian Saga Book 2, but

14:11.200 --> 14:17.920
the next book thing, so, so we're going to be doing something special episode after next.

14:17.920 --> 14:23.240
We're actually going to have a guest author who was, for realsies, published author.

14:23.240 --> 14:26.360
Not that you self-published her, not really.

14:26.360 --> 14:29.280
She went through the agony of, you know, the industry.

14:30.280 --> 14:35.920
Her name is also Lindsay, and she wrote a book called The Art of Wishing, which is YA,

14:35.920 --> 14:41.680
thank Christ, paranormal romance type thing.

14:41.680 --> 14:45.000
And it is, I'm told it's about genies.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.320
So I'm going to do that one with Lisa.

14:46.320 --> 14:49.080
Lisa's going to be filling in for Nella.

14:49.080 --> 14:58.200
And after that, yes, we will read the goddamn Kardashian sister YA novel.

14:58.200 --> 15:02.080
And that is how I will punish you.

15:02.080 --> 15:09.280
And also down the pipe, I have an ARC of John Scalzi's new book.

15:09.280 --> 15:15.080
So we will probably go ahead and, yeah, he signed it for me, see?

15:15.080 --> 15:16.080
Aw, yay.

15:16.080 --> 15:22.040
I got a signature from that thing that you didn't get to go to.

15:22.040 --> 15:24.560
Ooh, it has to do with highly contagious viruses.

15:24.560 --> 15:25.880
This is right up my alley.

15:26.080 --> 15:32.360
But we're going to try something new after we do The Art of Wishing, which will be the

15:32.360 --> 15:38.240
next review, and of course the Kendall and Kylie Jenner book.

15:38.240 --> 15:39.240
What was it?

15:39.240 --> 15:45.880
Rebels, colon, City of Indra, colon, the story of, like, it has two colons.

15:45.880 --> 15:50.800
And then we're going to actually review a thing that has not come out yet.

15:50.800 --> 15:53.760
So we're going to review a thing before it comes out.

15:53.760 --> 15:56.720
Like the real, like actual book reviewers.

15:56.720 --> 15:57.720
Like actual critics.

15:57.720 --> 15:58.720
It's exciting.

15:58.720 --> 15:59.720
So yeah.

15:59.720 --> 16:05.720
So I hope you enjoyed my suffering, because I'm going to enjoy yours.

16:05.720 --> 16:07.480
Till the next time.
