0	7160	English Mojito.
7160	8160	Look it's green.
8160	13920	It'll make this whole experience better, just like in the book.
13920	21440	So today's concoction is an English Mojito, because the author of this week's book is
21440	22440	British.
22440	25440	Really, really British.
25440	34240	And it's green, which in the book that we read, is like the happy color, the happy calming
34240	35240	color.
35240	37640	It's the one that you get high off of.
37640	40480	So I don't know if we mentioned this, I think we did.
40480	45280	The way we do this is we don't discuss this ahead of time.
45280	52280	So it's kind of like a fairy tale curse, that if we mention the thing, we can't mention
52280	60320	the thing, just so our discussion of the thing is a lot more authentic.
60320	63800	And this week we definitely haven't discussed the thing.
63800	70920	We also have a policy here on Booze Your Own Adventure that we don't say anything in our
70920	75840	reviews that we would not say to the author's face.
75840	79960	Because we are writers of a sort, we know how hard it is, and we know how shitty it
79960	86280	is when like some two-bit nobody just shows up all like, I'm gonna talk about your thing
86280	87280	person.
87280	95560	So today we're discussing Shades of Grey, of an indeterminate number of shades of grey,
95560	98720	by Jasper Ford.
98720	104440	It is a dystopian thing written for an adult audience.
104440	109920	Nella, what did you think of Shades of Grey?
110920	115920	I liked it.
115920	118680	Wait, hear me out!
118680	122560	I don't like the movie Brazil that much.
122560	124760	This felt like Brazil.
124760	127200	I liked it better than Brazil.
127200	132240	I would recommend it to people who liked Brazil.
132240	139720	I'd read the sequels, but it was definitely a book that meandered a lot throughout its
139720	141560	world building.
141560	146080	And the last quarter of the book decided, oh right, we've built up this world, let's
146080	149880	get to what's actually wrong with it and why our character should care.
149880	157600	Also, I'm sure we're gonna talk about female character.
157600	162360	This made me never want to read another book again.
162360	169200	The thing I hated about it was the process of reading the words.
169200	176440	On a concept level, if someone had described it to me, I'd be like, okay, that's a book.
176440	180920	But as I was reading it, I derived no enjoyment from it.
180920	186280	It felt like I couldn't remember why I enjoyed reading.
186280	187280	Period.
187280	188280	Wow.
188280	189280	Wow.
189280	192920	I'm sure Mr. Ford is a lovely person.
192920	198400	Let's start with the schtick, which is in this dystopian world, which takes place about
198400	204880	500 years after what would be our civilization.
204880	206280	We never find out the something that happened, right?
206280	209880	Or we haven't found out yet because this is what I hated.
209880	211280	It's a trilogy.
211280	216080	I just wanted a book that ended and it's about the halfway point I was like, there's no way
216080	218120	we can resolve this all in one book.
218120	219120	Surely, surely.
219120	220120	Oh no, is it?
220120	221120	Is it?
221120	224720	And then the last 20 pages, as it rushed to the end, I was like, oh God, here it comes.
224720	226320	Here it comes.
226320	227440	Sequel.
227440	230400	Be sure to read more in the next book.
230400	237600	But talking about the schtick of the book, that in this dystopian future, society is
237600	241040	based on people's perceptions of color.
241040	244160	So you are a color.
244160	252880	You can only see one natural color and then synthetic color is used to great extent.
252880	257160	When I was in high school, I read Brave New World and I liked it.
257160	262280	This was like if Brave New World didn't have a point or it did have a point, but the point
262280	268400	was like less sophisticated than we get in young adult dystopias.
268400	270640	Well, cause it's a point that's been done.
270640	271640	Well, yeah.
271640	274760	And I was like, every time it would like, I mean, it has a very glib sense of humor
274760	279960	so we can kind of sidestep that criticism, I guess, sort of, but it still had that underlying
279960	281960	tone of like conformity bad.
281960	288960	And it's like, this came out in 2009.
288960	294320	This is a little old, you guys.
294320	300480	And I was like waiting for it to add to that because it was so boring.
300480	304880	And the thing is, usually like Divergent, I gave Divergent a lot of shit.
304880	306320	I like Divergent better than this.
306320	308640	This is how much I hated this book.
308640	309640	Wow.
309640	314480	Divergent, the dystopia of Divergent was really kind of not about anything.
314840	321760	Like you could really stretch it and say it's about like high school cliques, but it wasn't,
321760	326400	it was a story first, you know, and I guess any kind of like social commentary was like,
326400	331120	they like wafted it over the book and said like, here's some commentary, sort of, not
331120	332120	really.
332120	333120	It wasn't meant to be a commentary.
333120	334120	Yeah.
334120	339920	So, I mean, like, I still maintain that Divergent's not good, but it had a story with tension
339920	341720	and characters.
341720	345600	And this, and this reminds me of like an io9 review I read of The Bone Season where it
345600	350000	was like world building for the sake of world building.
350000	356000	And I kept imagining like Frank Underwood turning to the camera as the narrator repeatedly
356000	359200	explained the world to us, like a thing would happen.
359200	362360	And then he'd be like, oh, well, you know, this swatch is like the duh-duh-duh, and then
362360	365200	we have to do this thing over here in order to get our swatches.
365200	370200	And it was just like the most clunky, unnatural world building I can remember.
370200	374340	Usually world building is done with action.
374340	379840	Usually world building is done with a thing that happens, not the narrator constantly
379840	383200	over and over to the point of like, is this a parody?
383200	384880	It felt so British.
384880	386480	It did feel really British.
386480	392120	And like the, the elements of the dystopia, like it felt like a sort of like a BuzzFeed
392120	396840	article, you know, you're British if, you know, like all of the elements of the dystopia
396840	400680	where people, you know, there'd be like an uncomfortable thing in the room and we got
400680	404160	to pretend like it's not there because Britain, you know, like stuff like that.
404160	405160	And I was like...
405160	406160	The hyper-politeness.
406160	407160	Yeah.
407160	408160	So it felt very British in that way.
408160	409400	But that's not a bad thing.
409400	412560	The world building and the way it was done, I thought was a bad thing because it was not,
412560	415080	I mean, it's sort of like show, don't tell.
415080	416240	It was so telly.
416240	418500	It was maddeningly telly.
418500	423120	And it's like he could construct a sentence okay, and like sometimes slip a joke in there.
423120	424120	I liked the risk joke.
424120	425120	It was a good one.
425440	427440	It was a good one.
427440	429840	Good as a stretch.
429840	436600	And the second the main love interest shows up, I was like uh-oh, we got a strong female
436600	440080	character on our hands.
440080	442400	She threatened to punch me.
442400	444800	I dig that.
444800	449000	With that nose she has.
449000	450000	Dat nose.
450000	451000	She hits people.
451000	452000	Yeah.
452000	453000	She's not a nice person.
453000	454000	Filter.
454000	455360	She hits him constantly.
455360	456960	And he's charmed by this.
456960	458400	As men are wont to do.
458400	464160	I mean I just, every fucking sentence of this god forsaken character, I kept envisioning
464160	466760	like the Kate Beaton strong female character.
466760	468360	I don't need no man.
468360	471040	There's just something about this incredibly weak male lead.
471040	472040	Oh my god.
472040	474160	He was such an incredibly weak male lead.
474160	476440	I mean this is like why I hated American Gods.
476440	477760	There was no driving tension.
477760	479840	He doesn't want anything.
479840	483400	And I mean you're just like, you're reading a book with no driving tension.
483800	488320	No, it's all about, he just wants to actually win the other girl back at home.
488320	490320	But there's not a driving tension.
490320	491760	That's like a subplot.
491760	495320	That's barely a subplot.
495320	499320	So there's driving tension not really in the subplot, where he kind of nonchalantly, indifferently
499320	503840	kind of likes a girl back home, but he doesn't seem to care about anything.
503840	508520	And I cannot stand when your protagonist doesn't care about anything, and if your protagonist
508520	513000	does not care about anything, your world building had better goddamn well be the most fucking
513000	515640	interesting thing imaginable.
515640	519000	Like I was just sort of thinking like, if this was written as a YA, she would have been
519000	523160	the lead and it would have been from the Grey's perspective, I feel.
523160	530120	If you like Brazil and British long-dragging politeness.
530120	535320	Frank Underwood turning to the camera and explaining everything to you rather than showing
535320	536320	it.
536320	542280	No, at least Frank Underwood is actually like really super enjoyable when he does that.
543040	544040	He's Richard III.
544040	545040	That's why it's worth.
545040	550040	How does this have such a high rating on Goodreads?
550040	552320	Seriously, if you like Brazil, you'll like this.
552320	561240	I can see liking this if you like the tone, and tone is like why you read things.
561240	566960	And because as I was reading it, I was just like, my problem was I was just so bored by
566960	568440	the world building.
568480	573000	I was just like, there's no point to this dystopia.
573000	579280	And that would be fine if there was a story or a driving tension, technically, I mean
579280	584120	I wouldn't even call it a story, it's just like one guy putters around for a few days
584120	585120	and then discovers a thing.
585120	586840	He shoves it all in the last fourth of the book.
586840	587840	Yeah.
587840	592200	On the whole, I think I really do enjoy YA more than this whole adult shit.
592200	593200	Well in terms of dystopia?
593960	594960	Yeah.
594960	599720	Because that was my point, it's kind of really hard to make a grand sweeping gesture by way
599720	602760	of allegory about society anymore.
602760	607120	I mean the Hunger Games did it really well because it kind of hit on something new, being
607120	611720	reality shows, which didn't exist in Aldous Huxley's time.
611720	615160	But even you look at something like Brave New World, which still feels like it has relevance
615160	619200	because it has so much to do with the society numbing you.
619520	621520	And also the Munsell.
621520	626040	Oh, Munsell is a color chart, I used it in Archeology.
626040	629360	It has a whole, it just pretty much has a shit ton of color swatches.
629360	630360	Well see, that's clever.
630360	631360	Well yeah, that's what I, like the whole-
631360	634400	Okay, I'm trying to think of something nice to say about this guy.
634400	635400	And also the test-
635400	638360	I was just like, I gotta find something nice to say about this, he clearly thought a lot
638360	639360	about this.
639360	640360	No!
640360	641360	I was just so unhappy.
641360	647000	And the test that they take to determine what their color percentage in vision is, is the
647000	650280	name of the guy who came up with the color blind test and shit.
650280	651280	Oh, the Ishihara.
651280	652280	Yeah.
652280	653280	So you knew this?
653280	654280	Yeah.
654280	655280	Or you looked it up?
655280	656280	No, I knew it.
656280	657280	So you knew this, and I didn't.
657280	658280	And I didn't really think about that.
658280	659280	But that is clever, now that I know that.
659280	660280	See, I said a nice thing.
660280	663320	I said a nice thing about this book I hated.
663320	667880	I think that's what kept me going, is that I did enjoy how much obvious thought he put
667880	672920	into this world and forcing it to work in this shtick.
673080	678720	Well, I mean, I thought the world in itself was not the problem, the problem was the way
678720	680040	it was presented.
680040	682560	I really wish Jane had not been the way she was.
682560	684120	I mean, I wish everything about the story.
684120	688760	I mean, I hated the main character, it was so fucking hackneyed, their way, this strong
688760	693560	female character, I'm a huge bitch, I need to be tamed, I'm sick of that.
693560	694560	You know?
694560	695560	Yeah.
695560	698800	And it was just like, from the second she's on screen and the first thing she does is
698800	701160	threaten to harm him, it's like, really?
701160	702160	Really?
702400	705360	We've written how many books, and we're going here?
705360	707240	How fucking hackneyed is that?
707240	709480	And it's sexist as shit, you know?
709480	710960	We're taming the shrew again.
710960	712520	We should be past this.
712520	717400	I mean, that would be fine if she was an interesting and well-rounded character, but she's not.
717400	722120	And obviously, some people will disagree, and that's fine, but a compelling narrative
722120	727960	is generally, and you look at Dexter in Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad, and it's like,
727960	731760	a compelling character is not someone who is good.
731760	734760	A compelling character is a driven character.
734760	737720	And I hold to this.
737720	739240	That's why I like Game of Thrones.
739240	741920	Everybody is very driven, you know?
741920	744200	And they're all differently driven, and that's what makes it interesting.
744200	748520	Like, in this book, there was no single character that was driven, and in YA, you tend to be
748520	752240	very driven because it's like, teenagers, and they want, you know, they want to find
752240	756000	their place in society, they want to do the thing, they want to be the king, you know,
756000	757000	whatever.
757040	758040	But Jane was driven.
758040	763280	Like, hackneyed though she was, and like, one-dimensional, but she was driven, but also
763280	768320	there was a sense that she didn't appreciate the danger she was in, because she's the lowest
768320	775840	class of, she's a Grey, they're pretty much the slave class, like, she's constantly pissing
775840	776840	everyone off.
776840	779360	But she is the Kate Beatonian strong female character.
779360	783200	Everyone's always talking about how they can't wait till, like, they can throw her out to
783200	788600	like, to be rebooted, like, which is a thing in this world, which, you know, ends up being
788600	789600	something else.
789600	796480	But, but she has no concept of, because she's got it all figured out, so she has no fear
796480	798160	of what they can throw at her.
798160	799360	So there's no tension for her.
799360	800360	So for her, there's no tension.
800360	803160	So it's like, even though she's driven, there's no stakes.
803160	806120	I, like I said, I, I liked it.
806120	809040	I didn't want to gorge my eyes out afterwards.
809040	810040	I went, hmm, that was alright.
810360	814360	I can't, like, it's like, sort of like one of those things where I kept thinking, like,
814360	824560	I guess he's not bad at writing, but I, everything I like about stories is absent.
824560	828760	I mean, I'm interested in checking out his other series, which is like a new war fairy
828760	832600	tale thing going on, or nursery rhyme thing.
832600	836360	But I'll do that on my own.
836360	839800	So next episode, I'm going to stop saying next week, because obviously we can't keep
840560	841560	Hey, you know, bro.
841560	842560	We busy.
842560	843560	What are you going to do?
843560	844560	Them full-time jobs.
844560	845560	Yeah.
845560	851200	So next episode, we're going to be discussing the outline for Viridian Saga Book 2, but
851200	857920	the next book thing, so, so we're going to be doing something special episode after next.
857920	863240	We're actually going to have a guest author who was, for realsies, published author.
863240	866360	Not that you self-published her, not really.
866360	869280	She went through the agony of, you know, the industry.
870280	875920	Her name is also Lindsay, and she wrote a book called The Art of Wishing, which is YA,
875920	881680	thank Christ, paranormal romance type thing.
881680	885000	And it is, I'm told it's about genies.
885000	886320	So I'm going to do that one with Lisa.
886320	889080	Lisa's going to be filling in for Nella.
889080	898200	And after that, yes, we will read the goddamn Kardashian sister YA novel.
898200	902080	And that is how I will punish you.
902080	909280	And also down the pipe, I have an ARC of John Scalzi's new book.
909280	915080	So we will probably go ahead and, yeah, he signed it for me, see?
915080	916080	Aw, yay.
916080	922040	I got a signature from that thing that you didn't get to go to.
922040	924560	Ooh, it has to do with highly contagious viruses.
924560	925880	This is right up my alley.
926080	932360	But we're going to try something new after we do The Art of Wishing, which will be the
932360	938240	next review, and of course the Kendall and Kylie Jenner book.
938240	939240	What was it?
