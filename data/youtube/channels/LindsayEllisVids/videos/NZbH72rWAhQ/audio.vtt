WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.760
It's 852 here in New York, I'm Bryant Gumbel.

00:10.760 --> 00:14.800
We understand that there has been a plane crash on the southern tip of Manhattan.

00:14.800 --> 00:16.900
You're looking at the World Trade Center.

00:16.900 --> 00:20.800
We understand that a plane has crashed into the World Trade Center.

00:20.800 --> 00:22.240
We don't know anything more than that.

00:22.240 --> 00:23.240
We don't know if it was a-

00:23.240 --> 00:28.080
So when this episode won the last poll for Pick A Historical Event, I was honestly kind

00:28.080 --> 00:33.840
of hoping 9-11 would win because I hadn't really seen a retrospective on how 9-11 has

00:33.840 --> 00:37.320
been depicted in the media over the last 15 years.

00:37.320 --> 00:40.860
And yes, it has been 15 years.

00:40.860 --> 00:46.080
And I wasn't really taking into account one very important element that is a part of this

00:46.080 --> 00:52.080
show, that being the cultural elements that go into what shapes the media in question.

00:52.080 --> 00:59.200
And if you give it more than a passing thought, it's like thousands of people died and it

00:59.200 --> 01:03.120
led to the longest war in American history that we're still in.

01:03.120 --> 01:06.360
It's kind of a bummer.

01:06.360 --> 01:11.360
So this ended up being a lot more difficult than I thought it would be, you know, trying

01:11.360 --> 01:18.120
to connect the dots of the media depictions of this incident that defies words.

01:18.120 --> 01:22.240
It was difficult, but I'm going to try.

01:22.240 --> 01:23.400
Keyword try.

01:23.400 --> 01:29.080
So before we get into it, know that there will be lots of images depicting the destruction

01:29.080 --> 01:32.040
of the World Trade Center and its periphery.

01:32.040 --> 01:36.440
And also acknowledgement, especially as a New Yorker, that this was a real thing that

01:36.440 --> 01:38.640
happened recently.

01:38.640 --> 01:43.080
It is, as of this taping, the most destructive act of terrorism and one of the most devastating

01:43.080 --> 01:46.320
losses of life to have ever taken place on American soil.

01:46.320 --> 01:51.480
So let me start by saying I don't know what your reaction is when the topic or image of

01:51.480 --> 01:52.480
9-11 is mentioned.

01:52.480 --> 01:58.400
It could be grief, it could be indifference, it could be a conviction that jet fuel can't

01:58.400 --> 02:04.880
melt steel beams, and if you're anything like me, blinding white hot rage that that phrase

02:04.880 --> 02:11.120
is even still a thing that people take seriously.

02:11.120 --> 02:16.280
We all come into this with different perspectives, different degrees of intimacy to the tragedy.

02:16.280 --> 02:21.800
From actual loss of a family member in the attacks to no reaction at all.

02:21.800 --> 02:25.960
So while there is some goofy stuff in these two episodes, because there have been some

02:25.960 --> 02:30.440
goofy depictions of 9-11, this will be more on the serious business end.

02:30.440 --> 02:35.080
Ground Zero is literally five miles away from where I am sitting right now.

02:35.080 --> 02:39.400
Any world event can influence media trends, but few influence mainstream media in quite

02:39.400 --> 02:41.400
the way that 9-11 did.

02:41.400 --> 02:45.400
Not only did it change the topics we were willing to tackle, but also the aesthetic.

02:45.480 --> 02:50.440
There's a particular awkwardness watching Armageddon now, not just because of how it

02:50.440 --> 02:52.840
visually mirrors what happened, but how it doesn't.

02:53.640 --> 02:57.320
We all know now that that's not what skyscrapers look like when they fall.

02:58.120 --> 03:02.440
It basically killed the public's appetite to see images of wholesale destruction for

03:02.440 --> 03:03.320
several years.

03:03.320 --> 03:06.840
So before we actually get into the media part, I want to talk a little bit about collective

03:06.840 --> 03:09.880
trauma, which is exactly what it sounds like.

03:09.880 --> 03:14.600
It is trauma that affects groups, often by proxy.

03:14.680 --> 03:18.840
For instance, the Holocaust to the Jewish people, or the Armenian genocide to the Armenian

03:18.840 --> 03:24.280
diaspora, and 9-11 to Americans, which is the most pronounced instance of collective

03:24.280 --> 03:25.400
trauma since Pearl Harbor.

03:26.040 --> 03:31.080
There was a study released in 2008 concluding that in the days following the attacks, nearly

03:31.080 --> 03:36.360
half of Americans reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress, and many of these symptoms remained

03:36.360 --> 03:38.600
elevated in the following weeks and months.

03:38.600 --> 03:44.520
But there was no one uniform way that these post-traumatic symptoms actually manifested.

03:44.520 --> 03:50.280
The study identified reactions of anger and political intolerance, gratitude and spirituality,

03:50.280 --> 03:55.240
and even changes in patterns of normal language use, social behavior, cognitive processing.

03:55.240 --> 04:01.240
So you can't say that 9-11 made us all of a sudden more xenophobic, or more inclusive,

04:01.240 --> 04:05.640
or united, or uniformly more anything, because it's not that simple.

04:05.640 --> 04:09.960
The trauma is collective, yes, but the coping mechanisms are all over the place.

04:09.960 --> 04:15.560
But you can say that the events did trigger a search for attributional meaning.

04:15.560 --> 04:20.120
And that's where media depictions come in, because that is the point of art and media.

04:20.120 --> 04:24.280
It is the one thing we have to help us make sense of our existence.

04:24.280 --> 04:28.760
According to another study, the sense that one has actually found meaning in the event

04:28.760 --> 04:33.240
is correlated with lower post-traumatic stress, and the media that we as a culture create

04:33.320 --> 04:35.960
and consume is an integral part of that process.

04:36.760 --> 04:38.440
So it is time to go back in time.

04:39.160 --> 04:43.320
All the way back, back, back, back to September 11th, 2001.

04:43.320 --> 04:46.520
The most devastating terrorist attack in modern history.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.880
What happens next?

04:47.880 --> 04:51.720
Well, of course, first we have to hastily re-edit things that were already done

04:51.720 --> 04:54.360
to fit this radically changed new world.

04:54.360 --> 04:58.600
After all, a ton of movies and TV shows take place in New York and are filmed in New York,

04:58.600 --> 05:02.200
and we are now in a world where there are no Twin Towers anymore.

05:02.840 --> 05:03.480
That's awkward.

05:04.200 --> 05:08.360
There was a scene in the original Spider-Man trailer showing a helicopter caught in a web

05:08.360 --> 05:12.280
between the Twin Towers, and well, that got deleted.

05:12.280 --> 05:15.080
The World Trade Center was digitally removed from films like

05:15.080 --> 05:17.960
Zoolander, Serendipity, and Kissing Jessica Stein.

05:17.960 --> 05:21.720
And scenes from Spy Game, The Time Machine, and The Bourne Identity were edited

05:21.720 --> 05:24.600
because of their visual resemblance to the wreckage of the towers.

05:24.600 --> 05:28.600
The latter extensively so due to terrorism as a major part of the storyline.

05:28.600 --> 05:32.280
Men in Black 2 originally featured a climax that included the World Trade Center,

05:32.280 --> 05:34.760
and the final version has changed to the Statue of Liberty.

05:34.760 --> 05:36.920
The original ending of Lilo and Stitch featured...

05:38.200 --> 05:38.920
this.

05:38.920 --> 05:40.920
Hold on!

05:46.840 --> 05:49.880
And this ending, which was already mostly animated by 9-11,

05:49.880 --> 05:52.760
was reanimated to change the city's skyline to mountains,

05:52.760 --> 05:55.640
and 747 to something more alien-y.

05:56.200 --> 05:59.720
Stitch did 9-11.

05:59.720 --> 06:03.560
Meanwhile, on television, the opening credits of shows like The Sopranos and

06:03.560 --> 06:06.760
Law & Order SVU were edited to remove the Twin Towers.

06:06.760 --> 06:10.600
There was also an episode of Friends where Chandler and Monica could not get on their

06:10.600 --> 06:14.040
flight for their honeymoon because Chandler joked about a bomb in the airport.

06:14.040 --> 06:17.960
Look at that. Federal law prohibits any joking regarding aircraft hijacking or bombing.

06:17.960 --> 06:21.960
You don't have to worry about me, ma'am. I take my bombs very seriously.

06:21.960 --> 06:23.800
Sir, you want to come with us?

06:23.800 --> 06:25.960
And that scene got rewritten and reshot.

06:25.960 --> 06:30.280
Even shows like Power Rangers, Pokemon, Transformers, Robots in Disguise,

06:30.280 --> 06:32.920
and Invader Zim had episodes taken off the air.

06:32.920 --> 06:35.880
Invader Zim had other series edits too, like, well...

06:36.920 --> 06:37.960
changing this scene.

06:39.080 --> 06:41.800
All that you know and love lies in ruins.

06:45.800 --> 06:50.200
And also changing the colors of explosions in other episodes to make them more cartoony-looking.

06:50.200 --> 06:54.200
And during this period of hasty edits came also a period of...

06:55.720 --> 06:56.220
this.

07:01.720 --> 07:06.200
We'd be here all day if we ran through even a decent sampling of the Heartfelt Tribute songs.

07:06.200 --> 07:10.520
Here is what the Wikipedia page on the subject of songs about 9-11 looks like.

07:10.520 --> 07:15.640
But there was a certain genre in particular that was fond of the Heartfelt Tribute.

07:20.680 --> 07:29.720
Yes, before the days of Florida Georgia Line, when we sang about trucks and girls in America,

07:29.720 --> 07:31.560
it was a different, more sincere time,

07:31.560 --> 07:35.320
where we sang about trucks and girls in America, but, you know, more angry.

07:40.200 --> 07:43.400
As far as mainstream music that happened in that first couple of years,

07:43.400 --> 07:46.360
it tended to fall into three categories.

07:46.360 --> 07:47.640
Jingoistic bro country.

07:50.200 --> 07:56.520
And it's gonna be hell when you hear mother freedom start a-ragging her bell.

07:57.160 --> 07:58.600
Sad bro country.

07:58.600 --> 08:01.480
Where were you when the world stopped turning?

08:02.760 --> 08:05.160
That September day.

08:05.160 --> 08:07.480
And a sprinkling of dipshit trutherism.

08:07.480 --> 08:09.640
Why do people push pounds and powder?

08:09.640 --> 08:11.640
Why did Bush knock down the towers?

08:13.640 --> 08:14.140
Yeah.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.240
Why did Bush knock down the towers?

08:17.240 --> 08:19.640
Because the Illuminati told him to.

08:20.840 --> 08:21.340
Duh.

08:23.240 --> 08:27.960
And if you're wondering why the comments on this are disabled, that crowd is why.

08:28.760 --> 08:30.120
But after the initial reaction,

08:30.120 --> 08:33.480
we had enough time to start incorporating it into fictionalized narratives,

08:33.480 --> 08:36.680
and that's where it starts to get really interesting.

08:36.680 --> 08:39.560
One of the first to address it, of course, was South Park in the episode

08:39.560 --> 08:42.120
Osama Bin Laden Has Farty Pants.

08:42.120 --> 08:43.880
Remember when life used to be simple and cool?

08:45.400 --> 08:46.440
Not really.

08:46.440 --> 08:48.440
Which aired about eight weeks after the attacks,

08:48.440 --> 08:51.720
and it hasn't gone down as a classic in no small part

08:51.720 --> 08:54.200
because it feels like it was written in about an hour.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.720
Skipping addressing the event itself,

08:55.720 --> 08:59.080
the plot deals almost entirely with the invasion of Afghanistan,

08:59.080 --> 09:02.200
as well as paradising the fear the media was pushing at the time.

09:02.200 --> 09:05.960
Hey Sharon, maybe you should stop watching the news for a little bit.

09:08.680 --> 09:12.920
Sharon, you've been watching CNN for about eight weeks now.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.280
Don't you want to watch something else?

09:14.280 --> 09:16.040
It's totally different from today.

09:16.520 --> 09:17.240
Ramadan!

09:17.240 --> 09:18.520
Hey look, an infidel!

09:18.520 --> 09:21.400
Yet it devotes almost the entire second half of the episode

09:21.400 --> 09:26.520
to Cartman and Bin Laden in a sort of Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd tete-a-tete.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.000
They're still digging through the rubble,

09:37.000 --> 09:40.440
but yeah, tiny penis if that makes you feel better.

09:40.440 --> 09:41.320
Okay.

09:41.320 --> 09:45.320
And yet it ends with such a sincere, actually patriotic affirmation.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.960
America may have some problems, but it's our home.

09:47.960 --> 09:48.760
Our team.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.360
And if you don't want to root for your team,

09:50.360 --> 09:51.880
then you should get the hell out of the stadium.

09:51.880 --> 09:56.760
See, even Matt Stone and Trey Parker were kind of going for some sort of catharsis.

09:56.760 --> 10:01.960
In this case, by A, making Bin Laden look like a harmless buffoon with a tiny penis.

10:02.840 --> 10:03.880
That'll show him.

10:03.880 --> 10:08.040
But B, despite ragging on America, reavowing loyalty to it.

10:08.760 --> 10:09.960
Go America.

10:09.960 --> 10:11.080
Go America.

10:11.080 --> 10:13.240
9-11 was a recurring South Park topic.

10:13.240 --> 10:17.320
The aforementioned country songs were parodied in A Ladder to Heaven the following year.

10:17.320 --> 10:20.360
Now he's here once again to capitalize on people's emotions.

10:20.360 --> 10:22.360
See, when country stars sing about the thing,

10:22.360 --> 10:24.520
it's shamelessly capitalizing on the thing,

10:24.520 --> 10:26.280
which is totally different from when comedians do it.

10:26.280 --> 10:27.960
Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:29.400 --> 10:30.600
9-11.

10:32.280 --> 10:35.640
In season 10, the episode Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,

10:35.640 --> 10:37.960
they take on 9-11 conspiracy theories.

10:37.960 --> 10:40.040
And this one is easily the strongest of the group,

10:40.040 --> 10:42.360
probably because it wasn't written in an hour.

10:42.360 --> 10:46.360
All I had to do was have explosives planted in the base of the towers.

10:46.360 --> 10:49.560
Then on 9-11, we pretended like four planes were being hijacked,

10:49.560 --> 10:51.640
and really, we just re-rided them to Pennsylvania,

10:51.640 --> 10:55.000
then flew two military jets in the World Trade Center filled with more explosives,

10:55.000 --> 10:57.720
and shot down all the witnesses in Flight 93 with an F-15

10:57.720 --> 10:59.560
after blowing up the Pentagon with a cruise missile.

11:00.200 --> 11:05.320
It was only the world's most intricate, flawlessly executed plan ever, ever.

11:08.440 --> 11:08.940
Really?

11:09.580 --> 11:11.260
On the complete other end of the spectrum,

11:11.260 --> 11:14.220
you have the West Wing episode Isaac and Ishmael.

11:14.220 --> 11:17.500
It was also one of the first scripted TV series to respond to the attacks,

11:17.500 --> 11:20.540
featuring the aftermath of a nondescript similar attack

11:20.540 --> 11:26.220
that takes place in this universe, albeit a non-canon attack, apparently.

11:26.220 --> 11:29.500
It was written and filmed within two weeks of 9-11.

11:29.500 --> 11:30.860
Sorkin himself wrote this one,

11:30.860 --> 11:33.420
and it has a lot of Sorkin-esque rhetorical devices.

11:33.420 --> 11:34.540
I don't know about Irving Berlin,

11:34.540 --> 11:36.540
but your ridiculous search for rational reasons

11:36.540 --> 11:39.100
why somebody straps a bomb to their chest is ridiculous.

11:39.100 --> 11:41.340
You just called me ridiculous twice in one sentence.

11:41.340 --> 11:42.380
Hardly a record for me.

11:42.380 --> 11:43.580
People really liked it at the time

11:43.580 --> 11:46.700
because of the characters speaking in this authoritative, hopeful way,

11:46.700 --> 11:49.660
but it has not really aged well.

11:49.660 --> 11:51.500
So why is everybody trying to kill us?

11:51.500 --> 11:52.540
Not everybody.

11:52.540 --> 11:53.900
It seems like everybody.

11:53.900 --> 11:55.100
It's just the Arabs.

11:55.100 --> 11:56.620
Saying the Arabs is too general.

11:56.620 --> 11:58.780
Not only do terrorists always fail at what they're after,

11:58.780 --> 12:01.580
they pretty much always succeed in strengthening whatever it is they're against.

12:02.540 --> 12:03.040
Uh...

12:05.740 --> 12:06.240
No.

12:06.780 --> 12:10.460
And this is also the problem with spitting something out like this so fast.

12:10.460 --> 12:14.380
In the end, it has a very quick, you know, say-something-ness to it.

12:14.380 --> 12:18.140
Don't you consider this something noble about being a martyr?

12:18.140 --> 12:19.580
Bartlett's over here like,

12:19.580 --> 12:22.300
is this kid devil's advocating 9-11?

12:23.100 --> 12:24.700
We don't need martyrs right now.

12:25.420 --> 12:26.620
We need heroes.

12:26.620 --> 12:27.660
In December of that year,

12:27.660 --> 12:30.940
Marvel decided to put their take in an issue of The Amazing Spider-Man

12:30.940 --> 12:32.700
called The Black Issue,

12:32.700 --> 12:33.740
and it starts...

12:37.660 --> 12:39.500
I agree, Spider-Man.

12:39.500 --> 12:40.460
Must we?

12:40.460 --> 12:44.620
It's all about coming together against the greater adversity of terrorism.

12:44.620 --> 12:47.260
Even the supervillains put aside their differences.

12:47.260 --> 12:47.760
Really?

12:48.220 --> 12:48.720
Really?

12:49.260 --> 12:49.760
Really?

12:50.380 --> 12:51.180
Yeah, it, uh...

12:52.220 --> 12:53.660
It was a different time.

12:53.660 --> 12:54.780
So a couple years pass,

12:54.780 --> 12:57.660
and by now we've had enough time to write 9-11 into some movies.

12:58.460 --> 13:03.180
One of the first and easily the strongest film in this entire list is Spike Lee's 25th Hour.

13:03.180 --> 13:07.820
And part of what makes it so strong is the fact that 9-11 is a prominent backdrop in the story,

13:07.820 --> 13:10.460
but the film isn't really about 9-11.

13:10.460 --> 13:17.580
Fuck Osama Bin Laden, Al Qaeda, and backward-ass cave-dwelling fundamentalist assholes everywhere.

13:17.580 --> 13:19.980
On the names of innocent thousands murdered,

13:19.980 --> 13:26.700
I pray you spend the rest of eternity with your 72 cores roasting in a jet-fueled fire in hell.

13:27.660 --> 13:29.340
It was in production in 2001,

13:29.340 --> 13:33.900
and you do get the impression that it was hastily rewritten to include this backdrop.

13:33.900 --> 13:38.300
But in the end, that sort of cognitive dissonance fits in really well with the narrative proper,

13:38.300 --> 13:40.700
especially the scene where Monty goes on his tirade

13:40.700 --> 13:43.580
about how much he hates every aspect of New York.

13:43.580 --> 13:45.820
Fuck this whole city and everyone in it.

13:45.820 --> 13:49.500
From the row houses of Astoria to the penthouses on Park Avenue.

13:49.500 --> 13:52.780
From the projects in the Bronx to the lofts in Soho.

13:52.780 --> 13:55.580
But the way it's shot captures such conflicting emotions,

13:55.660 --> 13:58.380
which is a common response after any kind of trauma.

13:59.260 --> 14:01.180
Let an earthquake crumble it.

14:01.180 --> 14:02.460
Let the fires rage.

14:02.460 --> 14:04.380
Let it burn to fucking ash,

14:04.380 --> 14:09.340
and then let the waters rise and submerge this whole rat-infested place.

14:09.340 --> 14:11.100
Barry Pepper, who plays his friend,

14:11.100 --> 14:14.700
actually lives in this apartment downtown which overlooks Ground Zero.

14:14.700 --> 14:17.100
The New York Times says the air's bad down here.

14:17.100 --> 14:17.600
Oh yeah?

14:18.540 --> 14:19.900
Well, fuck the Times.

14:19.900 --> 14:20.700
I read the Post.

14:21.340 --> 14:25.340
And he brushes this fact off like it's no big deal,

14:25.340 --> 14:27.580
meanwhile Philip Seymour Hoffman's characters like,

14:28.700 --> 14:30.300
maybe this isn't a good idea.

14:30.300 --> 14:34.220
All three characters reflecting different emotional responses to trauma,

14:34.220 --> 14:35.020
running the gamut.

14:35.020 --> 14:37.260
Denial, worry, and anger.

14:37.260 --> 14:40.700
Fuck the corrupt cops with their anus-violating plungers

14:40.700 --> 14:44.940
and their 41 shots standing behind a blue wall of silence.

14:44.940 --> 14:46.700
You betray our trust!

14:46.700 --> 14:50.860
So 25th Hour is great, but it goes downhill pretty quickly from there.

14:50.860 --> 14:53.260
One of the more bizarre relics from this era

14:53.260 --> 14:58.140
is a made-for-television Showtime drama called DC 9-11, Time of Crisis.

14:58.140 --> 15:00.860
Made in that brief period of time before Bush and Cheney

15:00.860 --> 15:03.500
were generally regarded as two of history's greatest monsters.

15:04.380 --> 15:05.580
You wanted the job.

15:07.900 --> 15:08.860
Maybe this is why.

15:09.580 --> 15:13.580
This one reenacts the events of 9-11 from the point of George W. Bush

15:13.580 --> 15:16.860
and how hard it was for him, present-intenting.

15:16.860 --> 15:21.340
And it is staggeringly boring when it doesn't feel like a parody wrapped in a dream.

15:21.980 --> 15:24.700
Some passengers on cell phones figured out what was happening

15:25.820 --> 15:27.660
and they took matters into their own hands.

15:29.660 --> 15:31.100
God bless their souls.

15:31.100 --> 15:34.380
Take, for instance, this sensitive scene between Bush and Cheney.

15:38.860 --> 15:41.180
I'm gonna need you at my side at all times.

15:42.540 --> 15:43.340
Go and see the urn.

15:46.700 --> 15:49.100
Main thrust, Dick, is to protect the line of succession.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.820
It was a different time.

15:52.860 --> 15:56.860
A similar made-for-TV movie starring James Woods was made about Rudy Giuliani

15:56.860 --> 15:58.940
for USA Network around the same time.

15:58.940 --> 16:01.580
It was called Rudy, The Rudy Giuliani Story.

16:01.580 --> 16:06.060
And, well, it's more watchable than DC 9-11, Time of Crisis.

16:06.060 --> 16:08.140
This is New York City.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.580
I love this city.

16:11.580 --> 16:14.540
Despite mostly having nothing to do with 9-11,

16:14.540 --> 16:17.420
except for, hey, look, he was mayor when it happened.

16:17.420 --> 16:22.220
Yes, before James Woods was suing lazy Twitter users who called him a cocaine addict,

16:22.220 --> 16:25.820
he was doing feature-length campaign ads for Rudy 2008.

16:25.820 --> 16:27.340
Okay, got it. All New Yorkers together.

16:28.940 --> 16:32.540
And ne'er a more starry-eyed campaign ad could Rudy have wished for.

16:33.180 --> 16:34.940
What have these bastards done to my city?

16:35.660 --> 16:37.020
God, how I love this city.

16:37.580 --> 16:40.300
Most of it's actually about Rudy's life building up to 9-11

16:40.300 --> 16:43.180
and spends a weird amount of time on his infidelities

16:43.180 --> 16:46.140
and most of it ends up being about Giuliani's women's.

16:46.140 --> 16:49.020
In a weird way, it accidentally cops to the fact that 9-11

16:49.020 --> 16:51.740
was the greatest career boost Giuliani could have ever hoped for.

16:52.380 --> 16:54.540
And then there's jingoism for kids.

16:55.180 --> 17:00.300
Tiger Cruise was a Disney Channel original movie starring Hayden Panettiere and Bill Pullman,

17:00.300 --> 17:03.260
which intertwines a fictional storyline about a Navy admiral

17:03.260 --> 17:06.460
who gets to take his daughter on a family-based tiger cruise

17:06.460 --> 17:09.580
where his kids get to see what this Navy business is all about.

17:09.580 --> 17:11.740
How many elementary schools did I go to?

17:11.740 --> 17:14.060
Oh, Maddie, come on.

17:14.060 --> 17:16.140
Hayden is tired of being a Navy brat, see,

17:16.140 --> 17:18.380
and wants to talk her dad out of military life

17:18.380 --> 17:20.300
and eventually he's like, okay, honey.

17:21.260 --> 17:24.460
I decided I'm not gonna re-up.

17:25.020 --> 17:26.780
But then 9-11 happens.

17:26.780 --> 17:29.180
Until we know the full extent and nature of these attacks,

17:29.180 --> 17:31.740
we're gonna assume the worst and stay on full alert.

17:31.740 --> 17:35.820
Then when the serious thing happens, it's not a huge deal.

17:35.820 --> 17:38.620
Nothing waving a big ol' American flag won't fix.

17:38.620 --> 17:42.300
There are even two characters who lose a family member at the Pentagon,

17:42.300 --> 17:45.180
but, you know, they handle it pretty well.

17:45.980 --> 17:48.060
Listen, I'm sorry about your uncle.

17:48.860 --> 17:51.740
Thanks, it helps to keep busy, you know?

17:51.740 --> 17:53.820
In fairness to this thing, it is the rare

17:53.820 --> 17:57.100
dad-you-need-to-work-less-and-spend-more-time-with-your-family movie

17:57.100 --> 18:00.220
that ends with, actually, never mind, you do your damn job, dad.

18:01.260 --> 18:03.020
I think you should keep doing what you're doing.

18:05.420 --> 18:06.700
Five years out from 9-11,

18:06.700 --> 18:09.900
we started to see higher profile and higher budget feature films

18:09.900 --> 18:12.380
that were true stories not about political figures,

18:12.940 --> 18:14.940
but about people who were actually there,

18:14.940 --> 18:18.380
and the most well known came out pretty close to each other.

18:19.100 --> 18:21.580
The first was Oliver Stone's World Trade Center.

18:21.580 --> 18:29.020
See, you gotta talk to me, because ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

18:29.020 --> 18:31.100
And there were concerns before it came out,

18:31.100 --> 18:33.500
with Oliver Stone directing it and

18:33.500 --> 18:36.540
Oliver Stone having been prone to truthiness in the past.

18:37.660 --> 18:38.160
Ahem.

18:39.040 --> 18:43.200
And by 2006, 9-11 truthiness was really catching on,

18:43.200 --> 18:45.520
especially in light of the 9-11 commission report.

18:45.520 --> 18:49.760
But Stone held back on his truthiness and mostly it's just boring.

18:53.760 --> 18:55.680
Although the intro does remind me of Armageddon.

18:55.680 --> 18:59.920
I want to go shopping.

18:59.920 --> 19:00.420
Me too!

19:01.040 --> 19:02.720
It's mostly a trapped in a hole movie,

19:02.720 --> 19:04.960
with the towers falling about 20 minutes in,

19:04.960 --> 19:08.000
and Nicolas Cage and Michael Peña being trapped under the rubble

19:08.080 --> 19:10.000
for two hours with Nott,

19:10.000 --> 19:11.280
but Nicolas Cage is...

19:11.920 --> 19:14.320
I think that's supposed to be a New York accent?

19:14.320 --> 19:17.200
Every wife, I feel the pain less,

19:18.800 --> 19:20.000
but I'm more numb.

19:20.880 --> 19:22.480
And eventually they get dug out.

19:22.480 --> 19:24.080
I'd call it dull and inoffensive,

19:24.080 --> 19:27.600
but while some of the families of the men portrayed in the movie signed off,

19:27.600 --> 19:31.040
others, namely family members of the dead portrayed in the film,

19:31.040 --> 19:32.480
weren't too thrilled.

19:32.480 --> 19:35.600
And you could call this the apex of capitalizing on tragedy,

19:35.600 --> 19:38.240
but we're nowhere near done yet.

19:38.800 --> 19:41.280
Paul Greengrass took a more Paul Greengrass approach

19:41.280 --> 19:44.720
to his take on the passengers of United 93

19:44.720 --> 19:48.560
retaliating against the hijackers in United 93.

19:49.520 --> 19:50.960
This is a suicide mission.

19:51.680 --> 19:52.960
We have to do something.

19:52.960 --> 19:56.320
At the time, Greengrass was best known for the Irish film Bloody Sunday

19:56.320 --> 19:57.760
and The Bourne Supremacy,

19:57.760 --> 20:00.080
so the Greengrass approach was shaky cameras,

20:00.080 --> 20:02.320
lots and lots of natural looking lighting,

20:02.320 --> 20:03.520
and minimal score.

20:04.160 --> 20:05.360
Unlike World Trade Center,

20:05.360 --> 20:07.680
United 93 had no-name actors,

20:07.680 --> 20:09.200
lending to its legitimacy,

20:09.200 --> 20:13.280
and since it wasn't trying to be an overlong sincere snooze fest,

20:13.280 --> 20:15.200
it was the stronger of the two,

20:15.200 --> 20:17.520
but, you know, it wasn't that great.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.200
The further away we get from 9-11,

20:19.200 --> 20:21.920
the less people quite know what to do with it.

20:22.480 --> 20:25.920
Hollywood had gotten the serious topical movies out of its system,

20:25.920 --> 20:27.760
and that didn't really work.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.280
Nobody really wanted it,

20:29.280 --> 20:31.360
and yet it was inevitable.

20:31.360 --> 20:35.680
And after neither of those two movies were award-season darlings,

20:35.680 --> 20:39.040
Hollywood kind of backed off from movies about 9-11 for a while.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.840
Although that was hardly the end of it.

20:41.840 --> 20:44.960
See, Americans in general are really turned off

20:44.960 --> 20:48.080
by the idea of capitalizing on this tragedy anyway.

20:54.080 --> 20:57.440
Even though it's kind of impossible not to capitalize on it.

20:57.440 --> 20:59.920
Like, I'm capitalizing on it right now.

20:59.920 --> 21:03.520
No matter how solemn or respectful or irreverent or disrespectful,

21:03.520 --> 21:06.000
that's all a form of capitalizing on it,

21:06.000 --> 21:07.680
because it's an inescapable thing.

21:07.680 --> 21:09.440
Our world is shaped by it.

21:09.440 --> 21:11.040
Everything from the Patriot Act,

21:11.040 --> 21:12.000
to the Snowden leaks,

21:12.000 --> 21:13.440
to the Syrian refugee crisis,

21:13.440 --> 21:14.640
and even Brexit.

21:14.640 --> 21:18.320
All of these things came at least as a partial fallout

21:18.320 --> 21:20.480
of the way 9-11 affected the world.

21:20.480 --> 21:25.040
So, while you might think I've hit all of the obvious ones,

21:25.760 --> 21:27.200
this topic runs pretty deep,

21:27.200 --> 21:29.200
and we've got a long way to go.
