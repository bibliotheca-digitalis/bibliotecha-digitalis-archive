0	10760	It's 852 here in New York, I'm Bryant Gumbel.
10760	14800	We understand that there has been a plane crash on the southern tip of Manhattan.
14800	16900	You're looking at the World Trade Center.
16900	20800	We understand that a plane has crashed into the World Trade Center.
20800	22240	We don't know anything more than that.
22240	23240	We don't know if it was a-
23240	28080	So when this episode won the last poll for Pick A Historical Event, I was honestly kind
28080	33840	of hoping 9-11 would win because I hadn't really seen a retrospective on how 9-11 has
33840	37320	been depicted in the media over the last 15 years.
37320	40860	And yes, it has been 15 years.
40860	46080	And I wasn't really taking into account one very important element that is a part of this
46080	52080	show, that being the cultural elements that go into what shapes the media in question.
52080	59200	And if you give it more than a passing thought, it's like thousands of people died and it
59200	63120	led to the longest war in American history that we're still in.
63120	66360	It's kind of a bummer.
66360	71360	So this ended up being a lot more difficult than I thought it would be, you know, trying
71360	78120	to connect the dots of the media depictions of this incident that defies words.
78120	82240	It was difficult, but I'm going to try.
82240	83400	Keyword try.
83400	89080	So before we get into it, know that there will be lots of images depicting the destruction
89080	92040	of the World Trade Center and its periphery.
92040	96440	And also acknowledgement, especially as a New Yorker, that this was a real thing that
96440	98640	happened recently.
98640	103080	It is, as of this taping, the most destructive act of terrorism and one of the most devastating
103080	106320	losses of life to have ever taken place on American soil.
106320	111480	So let me start by saying I don't know what your reaction is when the topic or image of
111480	112480	9-11 is mentioned.
112480	118400	It could be grief, it could be indifference, it could be a conviction that jet fuel can't
118400	124880	melt steel beams, and if you're anything like me, blinding white hot rage that that phrase
124880	131120	is even still a thing that people take seriously.
131120	136280	We all come into this with different perspectives, different degrees of intimacy to the tragedy.
136280	141800	From actual loss of a family member in the attacks to no reaction at all.
141800	145960	So while there is some goofy stuff in these two episodes, because there have been some
145960	150440	goofy depictions of 9-11, this will be more on the serious business end.
150440	155080	Ground Zero is literally five miles away from where I am sitting right now.
155080	159400	Any world event can influence media trends, but few influence mainstream media in quite
159400	161400	the way that 9-11 did.
161400	165400	Not only did it change the topics we were willing to tackle, but also the aesthetic.
165480	170440	There's a particular awkwardness watching Armageddon now, not just because of how it
170440	172840	visually mirrors what happened, but how it doesn't.
173640	177320	We all know now that that's not what skyscrapers look like when they fall.
178120	182440	It basically killed the public's appetite to see images of wholesale destruction for
182440	183320	several years.
183320	186840	So before we actually get into the media part, I want to talk a little bit about collective
186840	189880	trauma, which is exactly what it sounds like.
189880	194600	It is trauma that affects groups, often by proxy.
194680	198840	For instance, the Holocaust to the Jewish people, or the Armenian genocide to the Armenian
198840	204280	diaspora, and 9-11 to Americans, which is the most pronounced instance of collective
204280	205400	trauma since Pearl Harbor.
206040	211080	There was a study released in 2008 concluding that in the days following the attacks, nearly
211080	216360	half of Americans reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress, and many of these symptoms remained
216360	218600	elevated in the following weeks and months.
218600	224520	But there was no one uniform way that these post-traumatic symptoms actually manifested.
224520	230280	The study identified reactions of anger and political intolerance, gratitude and spirituality,
230280	235240	and even changes in patterns of normal language use, social behavior, cognitive processing.
235240	241240	So you can't say that 9-11 made us all of a sudden more xenophobic, or more inclusive,
241240	245640	or united, or uniformly more anything, because it's not that simple.
245640	249960	The trauma is collective, yes, but the coping mechanisms are all over the place.
249960	255560	But you can say that the events did trigger a search for attributional meaning.
255560	260120	And that's where media depictions come in, because that is the point of art and media.
260120	264280	It is the one thing we have to help us make sense of our existence.
264280	268760	According to another study, the sense that one has actually found meaning in the event
268760	273240	is correlated with lower post-traumatic stress, and the media that we as a culture create
273320	275960	and consume is an integral part of that process.
276760	278440	So it is time to go back in time.
279160	283320	All the way back, back, back, back to September 11th, 2001.
283320	286520	The most devastating terrorist attack in modern history.
286520	287880	What happens next?
287880	291720	Well, of course, first we have to hastily re-edit things that were already done
291720	294360	to fit this radically changed new world.
294360	298600	After all, a ton of movies and TV shows take place in New York and are filmed in New York,
298600	302200	and we are now in a world where there are no Twin Towers anymore.
302840	303480	That's awkward.
304200	308360	There was a scene in the original Spider-Man trailer showing a helicopter caught in a web
308360	312280	between the Twin Towers, and well, that got deleted.
312280	315080	The World Trade Center was digitally removed from films like
315080	317960	Zoolander, Serendipity, and Kissing Jessica Stein.
317960	321720	And scenes from Spy Game, The Time Machine, and The Bourne Identity were edited
321720	324600	because of their visual resemblance to the wreckage of the towers.
324600	328600	The latter extensively so due to terrorism as a major part of the storyline.
328600	332280	Men in Black 2 originally featured a climax that included the World Trade Center,
332280	334760	and the final version has changed to the Statue of Liberty.
334760	336920	The original ending of Lilo and Stitch featured...
338200	338920	this.
338920	340920	Hold on!
346840	349880	And this ending, which was already mostly animated by 9-11,
349880	352760	was reanimated to change the city's skyline to mountains,
352760	355640	and 747 to something more alien-y.
356200	359720	Stitch did 9-11.
359720	363560	Meanwhile, on television, the opening credits of shows like The Sopranos and
363560	366760	Law & Order SVU were edited to remove the Twin Towers.
366760	370600	There was also an episode of Friends where Chandler and Monica could not get on their
370600	374040	flight for their honeymoon because Chandler joked about a bomb in the airport.
374040	377960	Look at that. Federal law prohibits any joking regarding aircraft hijacking or bombing.
377960	381960	You don't have to worry about me, ma'am. I take my bombs very seriously.
381960	383800	Sir, you want to come with us?
383800	385960	And that scene got rewritten and reshot.
385960	390280	Even shows like Power Rangers, Pokemon, Transformers, Robots in Disguise,
390280	392920	and Invader Zim had episodes taken off the air.
392920	395880	Invader Zim had other series edits too, like, well...
396920	397960	changing this scene.
399080	401800	All that you know and love lies in ruins.
405800	410200	And also changing the colors of explosions in other episodes to make them more cartoony-looking.
410200	414200	And during this period of hasty edits came also a period of...
415720	416220	this.
421720	426200	We'd be here all day if we ran through even a decent sampling of the Heartfelt Tribute songs.
426200	430520	Here is what the Wikipedia page on the subject of songs about 9-11 looks like.
430520	435640	But there was a certain genre in particular that was fond of the Heartfelt Tribute.
440680	449720	Yes, before the days of Florida Georgia Line, when we sang about trucks and girls in America,
449720	451560	it was a different, more sincere time,
451560	455320	where we sang about trucks and girls in America, but, you know, more angry.
460200	463400	As far as mainstream music that happened in that first couple of years,
463400	466360	it tended to fall into three categories.
466360	467640	Jingoistic bro country.
470200	476520	And it's gonna be hell when you hear mother freedom start a-ragging her bell.
477160	478600	Sad bro country.
478600	481480	Where were you when the world stopped turning?
482760	485160	That September day.
485160	487480	And a sprinkling of dipshit trutherism.
487480	489640	Why do people push pounds and powder?
489640	491640	Why did Bush knock down the towers?
493640	494140	Yeah.
494760	497240	Why did Bush knock down the towers?
497240	499640	Because the Illuminati told him to.
500840	501340	Duh.
503240	507960	And if you're wondering why the comments on this are disabled, that crowd is why.
508760	510120	But after the initial reaction,
510120	513480	we had enough time to start incorporating it into fictionalized narratives,
513480	516680	and that's where it starts to get really interesting.
516680	519560	One of the first to address it, of course, was South Park in the episode
519560	522120	Osama Bin Laden Has Farty Pants.
522120	523880	Remember when life used to be simple and cool?
525400	526440	Not really.
526440	528440	Which aired about eight weeks after the attacks,
528440	531720	and it hasn't gone down as a classic in no small part
531720	534200	because it feels like it was written in about an hour.
534200	535720	Skipping addressing the event itself,
535720	539080	the plot deals almost entirely with the invasion of Afghanistan,
539080	542200	as well as paradising the fear the media was pushing at the time.
542200	545960	Hey Sharon, maybe you should stop watching the news for a little bit.
548680	552920	Sharon, you've been watching CNN for about eight weeks now.
552920	554280	Don't you want to watch something else?
554280	556040	It's totally different from today.
556520	557240	Ramadan!
557240	558520	Hey look, an infidel!
558520	561400	Yet it devotes almost the entire second half of the episode
561400	566520	to Cartman and Bin Laden in a sort of Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd tete-a-tete.
575080	577000	They're still digging through the rubble,
577000	580440	but yeah, tiny penis if that makes you feel better.
580440	581320	Okay.
581320	585320	And yet it ends with such a sincere, actually patriotic affirmation.
585400	587960	America may have some problems, but it's our home.
587960	588760	Our team.
588760	590360	And if you don't want to root for your team,
590360	591880	then you should get the hell out of the stadium.
591880	596760	See, even Matt Stone and Trey Parker were kind of going for some sort of catharsis.
596760	601960	In this case, by A, making Bin Laden look like a harmless buffoon with a tiny penis.
602840	603880	That'll show him.
603880	608040	But B, despite ragging on America, reavowing loyalty to it.
608760	609960	Go America.
609960	611080	Go America.
611080	613240	9-11 was a recurring South Park topic.
613240	617320	The aforementioned country songs were parodied in A Ladder to Heaven the following year.
617320	620360	Now he's here once again to capitalize on people's emotions.
620360	622360	See, when country stars sing about the thing,
622360	624520	it's shamelessly capitalizing on the thing,
624520	626280	which is totally different from when comedians do it.
626280	627960	Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah.
629400	630600	9-11.
632280	635640	In season 10, the episode Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,
635640	637960	they take on 9-11 conspiracy theories.
637960	640040	And this one is easily the strongest of the group,
640040	642360	probably because it wasn't written in an hour.
642360	646360	All I had to do was have explosives planted in the base of the towers.
646360	649560	Then on 9-11, we pretended like four planes were being hijacked,
649560	651640	and really, we just re-rided them to Pennsylvania,
651640	655000	then flew two military jets in the World Trade Center filled with more explosives,
655000	657720	and shot down all the witnesses in Flight 93 with an F-15
657720	659560	after blowing up the Pentagon with a cruise missile.
660200	665320	It was only the world's most intricate, flawlessly executed plan ever, ever.
668440	668940	Really?
669580	671260	On the complete other end of the spectrum,
671260	674220	you have the West Wing episode Isaac and Ishmael.
674220	677500	It was also one of the first scripted TV series to respond to the attacks,
677500	680540	featuring the aftermath of a nondescript similar attack
680540	686220	that takes place in this universe, albeit a non-canon attack, apparently.
686220	689500	It was written and filmed within two weeks of 9-11.
689500	690860	Sorkin himself wrote this one,
690860	693420	and it has a lot of Sorkin-esque rhetorical devices.
693420	694540	I don't know about Irving Berlin,
694540	696540	but your ridiculous search for rational reasons
696540	699100	why somebody straps a bomb to their chest is ridiculous.
699100	701340	You just called me ridiculous twice in one sentence.
701340	702380	Hardly a record for me.
702380	703580	People really liked it at the time
703580	706700	because of the characters speaking in this authoritative, hopeful way,
706700	709660	but it has not really aged well.
709660	711500	So why is everybody trying to kill us?
711500	712540	Not everybody.
712540	713900	It seems like everybody.
713900	715100	It's just the Arabs.
715100	716620	Saying the Arabs is too general.
716620	718780	Not only do terrorists always fail at what they're after,
718780	721580	they pretty much always succeed in strengthening whatever it is they're against.
722540	723040	Uh...
725740	726240	No.
726780	730460	And this is also the problem with spitting something out like this so fast.
730460	734380	In the end, it has a very quick, you know, say-something-ness to it.
734380	738140	Don't you consider this something noble about being a martyr?
738140	739580	Bartlett's over here like,
739580	742300	is this kid devil's advocating 9-11?
743100	744700	We don't need martyrs right now.
745420	746620	We need heroes.
746620	747660	In December of that year,
747660	750940	Marvel decided to put their take in an issue of The Amazing Spider-Man
750940	752700	called The Black Issue,
752700	753740	and it starts...
757660	759500	I agree, Spider-Man.
759500	760460	Must we?
760460	764620	It's all about coming together against the greater adversity of terrorism.
764620	767260	Even the supervillains put aside their differences.
767260	767760	Really?
768220	768720	Really?
769260	769760	Really?
770380	771180	Yeah, it, uh...
772220	773660	It was a different time.
773660	774780	So a couple years pass,
774780	777660	and by now we've had enough time to write 9-11 into some movies.
778460	783180	One of the first and easily the strongest film in this entire list is Spike Lee's 25th Hour.
783180	787820	And part of what makes it so strong is the fact that 9-11 is a prominent backdrop in the story,
787820	790460	but the film isn't really about 9-11.
790460	797580	Fuck Osama Bin Laden, Al Qaeda, and backward-ass cave-dwelling fundamentalist assholes everywhere.
797580	799980	On the names of innocent thousands murdered,
799980	806700	I pray you spend the rest of eternity with your 72 cores roasting in a jet-fueled fire in hell.
807660	809340	It was in production in 2001,
809340	813900	and you do get the impression that it was hastily rewritten to include this backdrop.
813900	818300	But in the end, that sort of cognitive dissonance fits in really well with the narrative proper,
818300	820700	especially the scene where Monty goes on his tirade
820700	823580	about how much he hates every aspect of New York.
823580	825820	Fuck this whole city and everyone in it.
825820	829500	From the row houses of Astoria to the penthouses on Park Avenue.
829500	832780	From the projects in the Bronx to the lofts in Soho.
832780	835580	But the way it's shot captures such conflicting emotions,
835660	838380	which is a common response after any kind of trauma.
839260	841180	Let an earthquake crumble it.
841180	842460	Let the fires rage.
842460	844380	Let it burn to fucking ash,
844380	849340	and then let the waters rise and submerge this whole rat-infested place.
849340	851100	Barry Pepper, who plays his friend,
851100	854700	actually lives in this apartment downtown which overlooks Ground Zero.
854700	857100	The New York Times says the air's bad down here.
857100	857600	Oh yeah?
858540	859900	Well, fuck the Times.
859900	860700	I read the Post.
861340	865340	And he brushes this fact off like it's no big deal,
865340	867580	meanwhile Philip Seymour Hoffman's characters like,
868700	870300	maybe this isn't a good idea.
870300	874220	All three characters reflecting different emotional responses to trauma,
874220	875020	running the gamut.
875020	877260	Denial, worry, and anger.
877260	880700	Fuck the corrupt cops with their anus-violating plungers
880700	884940	and their 41 shots standing behind a blue wall of silence.
884940	886700	You betray our trust!
886700	890860	So 25th Hour is great, but it goes downhill pretty quickly from there.
890860	893260	One of the more bizarre relics from this era
893260	898140	is a made-for-television Showtime drama called DC 9-11, Time of Crisis.
898140	900860	Made in that brief period of time before Bush and Cheney
900860	903500	were generally regarded as two of history's greatest monsters.
904380	905580	You wanted the job.
907900	908860	Maybe this is why.
909580	913580	This one reenacts the events of 9-11 from the point of George W. Bush
913580	916860	and how hard it was for him, present-intenting.
916860	921340	And it is staggeringly boring when it doesn't feel like a parody wrapped in a dream.
921980	924700	Some passengers on cell phones figured out what was happening
925820	927660	and they took matters into their own hands.
929660	931100	God bless their souls.
931100	934380	Take, for instance, this sensitive scene between Bush and Cheney.
938860	941180	I'm gonna need you at my side at all times.
942540	943340	Go and see the urn.
946700	949100	Main thrust, Dick, is to protect the line of succession.
949740	951820	It was a different time.
952860	956860	A similar made-for-TV movie starring James Woods was made about Rudy Giuliani
956860	958940	for USA Network around the same time.
958940	961580	It was called Rudy, The Rudy Giuliani Story.
961580	966060	And, well, it's more watchable than DC 9-11, Time of Crisis.
966060	968140	This is New York City.
969500	971580	I love this city.
971580	974540	Despite mostly having nothing to do with 9-11,
974540	977420	except for, hey, look, he was mayor when it happened.
977420	982220	Yes, before James Woods was suing lazy Twitter users who called him a cocaine addict,
982220	985820	he was doing feature-length campaign ads for Rudy 2008.
985820	987340	Okay, got it. All New Yorkers together.
988940	992540	And ne'er a more starry-eyed campaign ad could Rudy have wished for.
993180	994940	What have these bastards done to my city?
995660	997020	God, how I love this city.
997580	1000300	Most of it's actually about Rudy's life building up to 9-11
1000300	1003180	and spends a weird amount of time on his infidelities
1003180	1006140	and most of it ends up being about Giuliani's women's.
1006140	1009020	In a weird way, it accidentally cops to the fact that 9-11
1009020	1011740	was the greatest career boost Giuliani could have ever hoped for.
1012380	1014540	And then there's jingoism for kids.
1015180	1020300	Tiger Cruise was a Disney Channel original movie starring Hayden Panettiere and Bill Pullman,
1020300	1023260	which intertwines a fictional storyline about a Navy admiral
1023260	1026460	who gets to take his daughter on a family-based tiger cruise
1026460	1029580	where his kids get to see what this Navy business is all about.
1029580	1031740	How many elementary schools did I go to?
1031740	1034060	Oh, Maddie, come on.
1034060	1036140	Hayden is tired of being a Navy brat, see,
1036140	1038380	and wants to talk her dad out of military life
1038380	1040300	and eventually he's like, okay, honey.
1041260	1044460	I decided I'm not gonna re-up.
1045020	1046780	But then 9-11 happens.
1046780	1049180	Until we know the full extent and nature of these attacks,
1049180	1051740	we're gonna assume the worst and stay on full alert.
1051740	1055820	Then when the serious thing happens, it's not a huge deal.
1055820	1058620	Nothing waving a big ol' American flag won't fix.
1058620	1062300	There are even two characters who lose a family member at the Pentagon,
1062300	1065180	but, you know, they handle it pretty well.
1065980	1068060	Listen, I'm sorry about your uncle.
1068860	1071740	Thanks, it helps to keep busy, you know?
1071740	1073820	In fairness to this thing, it is the rare
1073820	1077100	dad-you-need-to-work-less-and-spend-more-time-with-your-family movie
1077100	1080220	that ends with, actually, never mind, you do your damn job, dad.
1081260	1083020	I think you should keep doing what you're doing.
1085420	1086700	Five years out from 9-11,
1086700	1089900	we started to see higher profile and higher budget feature films
1089900	1092380	that were true stories not about political figures,
1092940	1094940	but about people who were actually there,
1094940	1098380	and the most well known came out pretty close to each other.
1099100	1101580	The first was Oliver Stone's World Trade Center.
1101580	1109020	See, you gotta talk to me, because ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
1109020	1111100	And there were concerns before it came out,
1111100	1113500	with Oliver Stone directing it and
1113500	1116540	Oliver Stone having been prone to truthiness in the past.
1117660	1118160	Ahem.
1119040	1123200	And by 2006, 9-11 truthiness was really catching on,
1123200	1125520	especially in light of the 9-11 commission report.
1125520	1129760	But Stone held back on his truthiness and mostly it's just boring.
1133760	1135680	Although the intro does remind me of Armageddon.
1135680	1139920	I want to go shopping.
1139920	1140420	Me too!
1141040	1142720	It's mostly a trapped in a hole movie,
1142720	1144960	with the towers falling about 20 minutes in,
1144960	1148000	and Nicolas Cage and Michael Peña being trapped under the rubble
1148080	1150000	for two hours with Nott,
1150000	1151280	but Nicolas Cage is...
1151920	1154320	I think that's supposed to be a New York accent?
1154320	1157200	Every wife, I feel the pain less,
1158800	1160000	but I'm more numb.
1160880	1162480	And eventually they get dug out.
1162480	1164080	I'd call it dull and inoffensive,
1164080	1167600	but while some of the families of the men portrayed in the movie signed off,
1167600	1171040	others, namely family members of the dead portrayed in the film,
1171040	1172480	weren't too thrilled.
1172480	1175600	And you could call this the apex of capitalizing on tragedy,
1175600	1178240	but we're nowhere near done yet.
1178800	1181280	Paul Greengrass took a more Paul Greengrass approach
1181280	1184720	to his take on the passengers of United 93
1184720	1188560	retaliating against the hijackers in United 93.
1189520	1190960	This is a suicide mission.
1191680	1192960	We have to do something.
1192960	1196320	At the time, Greengrass was best known for the Irish film Bloody Sunday
1196320	1197760	and The Bourne Supremacy,
1197760	1200080	so the Greengrass approach was shaky cameras,
1200080	1202320	lots and lots of natural looking lighting,
1202320	1203520	and minimal score.
1204160	1205360	Unlike World Trade Center,
1205360	1207680	United 93 had no-name actors,
1207680	1209200	lending to its legitimacy,
1209200	1213280	and since it wasn't trying to be an overlong sincere snooze fest,
1213280	1215200	it was the stronger of the two,
1215200	1217520	but, you know, it wasn't that great.
1217520	1219200	The further away we get from 9-11,
1219200	1221920	the less people quite know what to do with it.
1222480	1225920	Hollywood had gotten the serious topical movies out of its system,
1225920	1227760	and that didn't really work.
1227760	1229280	Nobody really wanted it,
1229280	1231360	and yet it was inevitable.
1231360	1235680	And after neither of those two movies were award-season darlings,
1235680	1239040	Hollywood kind of backed off from movies about 9-11 for a while.
1239760	1241840	Although that was hardly the end of it.
1241840	1244960	See, Americans in general are really turned off
1244960	1248080	by the idea of capitalizing on this tragedy anyway.
1254080	1257440	Even though it's kind of impossible not to capitalize on it.
1257440	1259920	Like, I'm capitalizing on it right now.
1259920	1263520	No matter how solemn or respectful or irreverent or disrespectful,
1263520	1266000	that's all a form of capitalizing on it,
1266000	1267680	because it's an inescapable thing.
1267680	1269440	Our world is shaped by it.
1269440	1271040	Everything from the Patriot Act,
1271040	1272000	to the Snowden leaks,
1272000	1273440	to the Syrian refugee crisis,
1273440	1274640	and even Brexit.
1274640	1278320	All of these things came at least as a partial fallout
1278320	1280480	of the way 9-11 affected the world.
1280480	1285040	So, while you might think I've hit all of the obvious ones,
1285760	1287200	this topic runs pretty deep,
1287200	1289200	and we've got a long way to go.
