1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,760
It's 852 here in New York, I'm Bryant Gumbel.

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,800
We understand that there has been a plane crash on the southern tip of Manhattan.

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,900
You're looking at the World Trade Center.

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,800
We understand that a plane has crashed into the World Trade Center.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,240
We don't know anything more than that.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,240
We don't know if it was a-

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,080
So when this episode won the last poll for Pick A Historical Event, I was honestly kind

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,840
of hoping 9-11 would win because I hadn't really seen a retrospective on how 9-11 has

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,320
been depicted in the media over the last 15 years.

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,860
And yes, it has been 15 years.

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,080
And I wasn't really taking into account one very important element that is a part of this

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:52,080
show, that being the cultural elements that go into what shapes the media in question.

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:59,200
And if you give it more than a passing thought, it's like thousands of people died and it

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,120
led to the longest war in American history that we're still in.

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,360
It's kind of a bummer.

16
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,360
So this ended up being a lot more difficult than I thought it would be, you know, trying

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:18,120
to connect the dots of the media depictions of this incident that defies words.

18
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,240
It was difficult, but I'm going to try.

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,400
Keyword try.

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,080
So before we get into it, know that there will be lots of images depicting the destruction

21
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,040
of the World Trade Center and its periphery.

22
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,440
And also acknowledgement, especially as a New Yorker, that this was a real thing that

23
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,640
happened recently.

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,080
It is, as of this taping, the most destructive act of terrorism and one of the most devastating

25
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,320
losses of life to have ever taken place on American soil.

26
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,480
So let me start by saying I don't know what your reaction is when the topic or image of

27
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,480
9-11 is mentioned.

28
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:58,400
It could be grief, it could be indifference, it could be a conviction that jet fuel can't

29
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:04,880
melt steel beams, and if you're anything like me, blinding white hot rage that that phrase

30
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,120
is even still a thing that people take seriously.

31
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,280
We all come into this with different perspectives, different degrees of intimacy to the tragedy.

32
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,800
From actual loss of a family member in the attacks to no reaction at all.

33
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,960
So while there is some goofy stuff in these two episodes, because there have been some

34
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,440
goofy depictions of 9-11, this will be more on the serious business end.

35
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,080
Ground Zero is literally five miles away from where I am sitting right now.

36
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,400
Any world event can influence media trends, but few influence mainstream media in quite

37
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
the way that 9-11 did.

38
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,400
Not only did it change the topics we were willing to tackle, but also the aesthetic.

39
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,440
There's a particular awkwardness watching Armageddon now, not just because of how it

40
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,840
visually mirrors what happened, but how it doesn't.

41
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,320
We all know now that that's not what skyscrapers look like when they fall.

42
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,440
It basically killed the public's appetite to see images of wholesale destruction for

43
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,320
several years.

44
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,840
So before we actually get into the media part, I want to talk a little bit about collective

45
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,880
trauma, which is exactly what it sounds like.

46
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,600
It is trauma that affects groups, often by proxy.

47
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,840
For instance, the Holocaust to the Jewish people, or the Armenian genocide to the Armenian

48
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,280
diaspora, and 9-11 to Americans, which is the most pronounced instance of collective

49
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,400
trauma since Pearl Harbor.

50
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,080
There was a study released in 2008 concluding that in the days following the attacks, nearly

51
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,360
half of Americans reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress, and many of these symptoms remained

52
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,600
elevated in the following weeks and months.

53
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:44,520
But there was no one uniform way that these post-traumatic symptoms actually manifested.

54
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:50,280
The study identified reactions of anger and political intolerance, gratitude and spirituality,

55
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,240
and even changes in patterns of normal language use, social behavior, cognitive processing.

56
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:01,240
So you can't say that 9-11 made us all of a sudden more xenophobic, or more inclusive,

57
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,640
or united, or uniformly more anything, because it's not that simple.

58
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,960
The trauma is collective, yes, but the coping mechanisms are all over the place.

59
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:15,560
But you can say that the events did trigger a search for attributional meaning.

60
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,120
And that's where media depictions come in, because that is the point of art and media.

61
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,280
It is the one thing we have to help us make sense of our existence.

62
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,760
According to another study, the sense that one has actually found meaning in the event

63
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,240
is correlated with lower post-traumatic stress, and the media that we as a culture create

64
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,960
and consume is an integral part of that process.

65
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,440
So it is time to go back in time.

66
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,320
All the way back, back, back, back to September 11th, 2001.

67
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,520
The most devastating terrorist attack in modern history.

68
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,880
What happens next?

69
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,720
Well, of course, first we have to hastily re-edit things that were already done

70
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,360
to fit this radically changed new world.

71
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,600
After all, a ton of movies and TV shows take place in New York and are filmed in New York,

72
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,200
and we are now in a world where there are no Twin Towers anymore.

73
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,480
That's awkward.

74
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,360
There was a scene in the original Spider-Man trailer showing a helicopter caught in a web

75
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,280
between the Twin Towers, and well, that got deleted.

76
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,080
The World Trade Center was digitally removed from films like

77
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,960
Zoolander, Serendipity, and Kissing Jessica Stein.

78
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,720
And scenes from Spy Game, The Time Machine, and The Bourne Identity were edited

79
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,600
because of their visual resemblance to the wreckage of the towers.

80
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,600
The latter extensively so due to terrorism as a major part of the storyline.

81
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,280
Men in Black 2 originally featured a climax that included the World Trade Center,

82
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,760
and the final version has changed to the Statue of Liberty.

83
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,920
The original ending of Lilo and Stitch featured...

84
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,920
this.

85
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,920
Hold on!

86
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,880
And this ending, which was already mostly animated by 9-11,

87
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,760
was reanimated to change the city's skyline to mountains,

88
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,640
and 747 to something more alien-y.

89
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,720
Stitch did 9-11.

90
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,560
Meanwhile, on television, the opening credits of shows like The Sopranos and

91
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,760
Law & Order SVU were edited to remove the Twin Towers.

92
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,600
There was also an episode of Friends where Chandler and Monica could not get on their

93
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,040
flight for their honeymoon because Chandler joked about a bomb in the airport.

94
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,960
Look at that. Federal law prohibits any joking regarding aircraft hijacking or bombing.

95
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,960
You don't have to worry about me, ma'am. I take my bombs very seriously.

96
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,800
Sir, you want to come with us?

97
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,960
And that scene got rewritten and reshot.

98
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,280
Even shows like Power Rangers, Pokemon, Transformers, Robots in Disguise,

99
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,920
and Invader Zim had episodes taken off the air.

100
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,880
Invader Zim had other series edits too, like, well...

101
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,960
changing this scene.

102
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,800
All that you know and love lies in ruins.

103
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,200
And also changing the colors of explosions in other episodes to make them more cartoony-looking.

104
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,200
And during this period of hasty edits came also a period of...

105
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,220
this.

106
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,200
We'd be here all day if we ran through even a decent sampling of the Heartfelt Tribute songs.

107
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,520
Here is what the Wikipedia page on the subject of songs about 9-11 looks like.

108
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,640
But there was a certain genre in particular that was fond of the Heartfelt Tribute.

109
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:29,720
Yes, before the days of Florida Georgia Line, when we sang about trucks and girls in America,

110
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,560
it was a different, more sincere time,

111
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,320
where we sang about trucks and girls in America, but, you know, more angry.

112
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,400
As far as mainstream music that happened in that first couple of years,

113
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,360
it tended to fall into three categories.

114
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,640
Jingoistic bro country.

115
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:56,520
And it's gonna be hell when you hear mother freedom start a-ragging her bell.

116
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,600
Sad bro country.

117
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,480
Where were you when the world stopped turning?

118
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,160
That September day.

119
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,480
And a sprinkling of dipshit trutherism.

120
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,640
Why do people push pounds and powder?

121
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,640
Why did Bush knock down the towers?

122
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,140
Yeah.

123
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,240
Why did Bush knock down the towers?

124
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,640
Because the Illuminati told him to.

125
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,340
Duh.

126
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,960
And if you're wondering why the comments on this are disabled, that crowd is why.

127
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,120
But after the initial reaction,

128
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,480
we had enough time to start incorporating it into fictionalized narratives,

129
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,680
and that's where it starts to get really interesting.

130
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,560
One of the first to address it, of course, was South Park in the episode

131
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,120
Osama Bin Laden Has Farty Pants.

132
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,880
Remember when life used to be simple and cool?

133
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,440
Not really.

134
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,440
Which aired about eight weeks after the attacks,

135
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,720
and it hasn't gone down as a classic in no small part

136
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,200
because it feels like it was written in about an hour.

137
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,720
Skipping addressing the event itself,

138
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,080
the plot deals almost entirely with the invasion of Afghanistan,

139
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,200
as well as paradising the fear the media was pushing at the time.

140
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,960
Hey Sharon, maybe you should stop watching the news for a little bit.

141
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,920
Sharon, you've been watching CNN for about eight weeks now.

142
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,280
Don't you want to watch something else?

143
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,040
It's totally different from today.

144
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,240
Ramadan!

145
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,520
Hey look, an infidel!

146
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,400
Yet it devotes almost the entire second half of the episode

147
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,520
to Cartman and Bin Laden in a sort of Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd tete-a-tete.

148
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,000
They're still digging through the rubble,

149
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,440
but yeah, tiny penis if that makes you feel better.

150
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,320
Okay.

151
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,320
And yet it ends with such a sincere, actually patriotic affirmation.

152
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,960
America may have some problems, but it's our home.

153
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,760
Our team.

154
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,360
And if you don't want to root for your team,

155
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,880
then you should get the hell out of the stadium.

156
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,760
See, even Matt Stone and Trey Parker were kind of going for some sort of catharsis.

157
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,960
In this case, by A, making Bin Laden look like a harmless buffoon with a tiny penis.

158
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,880
That'll show him.

159
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,040
But B, despite ragging on America, reavowing loyalty to it.

160
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,960
Go America.

161
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,080
Go America.

162
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,240
9-11 was a recurring South Park topic.

163
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,320
The aforementioned country songs were parodied in A Ladder to Heaven the following year.

164
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,360
Now he's here once again to capitalize on people's emotions.

165
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,360
See, when country stars sing about the thing,

166
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,520
it's shamelessly capitalizing on the thing,

167
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,280
which is totally different from when comedians do it.

168
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,960
Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah.

169
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,600
9-11.

170
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,640
In season 10, the episode Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,

171
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,960
they take on 9-11 conspiracy theories.

172
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,040
And this one is easily the strongest of the group,

173
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,360
probably because it wasn't written in an hour.

174
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,360
All I had to do was have explosives planted in the base of the towers.

175
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,560
Then on 9-11, we pretended like four planes were being hijacked,

176
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,640
and really, we just re-rided them to Pennsylvania,

177
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,000
then flew two military jets in the World Trade Center filled with more explosives,

178
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,720
and shot down all the witnesses in Flight 93 with an F-15

179
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,560
after blowing up the Pentagon with a cruise missile.

180
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,320
It was only the world's most intricate, flawlessly executed plan ever, ever.

181
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:08,940
Really?

182
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,260
On the complete other end of the spectrum,

183
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,220
you have the West Wing episode Isaac and Ishmael.

184
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,500
It was also one of the first scripted TV series to respond to the attacks,

185
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,540
featuring the aftermath of a nondescript similar attack

186
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:26,220
that takes place in this universe, albeit a non-canon attack, apparently.

187
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,500
It was written and filmed within two weeks of 9-11.

188
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,860
Sorkin himself wrote this one,

189
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,420
and it has a lot of Sorkin-esque rhetorical devices.

190
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,540
I don't know about Irving Berlin,

191
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,540
but your ridiculous search for rational reasons

192
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,100
why somebody straps a bomb to their chest is ridiculous.

193
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,340
You just called me ridiculous twice in one sentence.

194
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,380
Hardly a record for me.

195
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,580
People really liked it at the time

196
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,700
because of the characters speaking in this authoritative, hopeful way,

197
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,660
but it has not really aged well.

198
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,500
So why is everybody trying to kill us?

199
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,540
Not everybody.

200
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,900
It seems like everybody.

201
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,100
It's just the Arabs.

202
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,620
Saying the Arabs is too general.

203
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,780
Not only do terrorists always fail at what they're after,

204
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,580
they pretty much always succeed in strengthening whatever it is they're against.

205
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,040
Uh...

206
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,240
No.

207
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,460
And this is also the problem with spitting something out like this so fast.

208
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:14,380
In the end, it has a very quick, you know, say-something-ness to it.

209
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,140
Don't you consider this something noble about being a martyr?

210
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,580
Bartlett's over here like,

211
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,300
is this kid devil's advocating 9-11?

212
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,700
We don't need martyrs right now.

213
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,620
We need heroes.

214
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,660
In December of that year,

215
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,940
Marvel decided to put their take in an issue of The Amazing Spider-Man

216
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,700
called The Black Issue,

217
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,740
and it starts...

218
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,500
I agree, Spider-Man.

219
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,460
Must we?

220
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,620
It's all about coming together against the greater adversity of terrorism.

221
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,260
Even the supervillains put aside their differences.

222
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:47,760
Really?

223
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:48,720
Really?

224
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:49,760
Really?

225
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,180
Yeah, it, uh...

226
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,660
It was a different time.

227
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,780
So a couple years pass,

228
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,660
and by now we've had enough time to write 9-11 into some movies.

229
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:03,180
One of the first and easily the strongest film in this entire list is Spike Lee's 25th Hour.

230
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,820
And part of what makes it so strong is the fact that 9-11 is a prominent backdrop in the story,

231
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,460
but the film isn't really about 9-11.

232
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:17,580
Fuck Osama Bin Laden, Al Qaeda, and backward-ass cave-dwelling fundamentalist assholes everywhere.

233
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,980
On the names of innocent thousands murdered,

234
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:26,700
I pray you spend the rest of eternity with your 72 cores roasting in a jet-fueled fire in hell.

235
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,340
It was in production in 2001,

236
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:33,900
and you do get the impression that it was hastily rewritten to include this backdrop.

237
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,300
But in the end, that sort of cognitive dissonance fits in really well with the narrative proper,

238
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,700
especially the scene where Monty goes on his tirade

239
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,580
about how much he hates every aspect of New York.

240
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,820
Fuck this whole city and everyone in it.

241
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,500
From the row houses of Astoria to the penthouses on Park Avenue.

242
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,780
From the projects in the Bronx to the lofts in Soho.

243
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,580
But the way it's shot captures such conflicting emotions,

244
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,380
which is a common response after any kind of trauma.

245
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,180
Let an earthquake crumble it.

246
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,460
Let the fires rage.

247
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,380
Let it burn to fucking ash,

248
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:09,340
and then let the waters rise and submerge this whole rat-infested place.

249
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,100
Barry Pepper, who plays his friend,

250
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,700
actually lives in this apartment downtown which overlooks Ground Zero.

251
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,100
The New York Times says the air's bad down here.

252
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:17,600
Oh yeah?

253
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,900
Well, fuck the Times.

254
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,700
I read the Post.

255
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:25,340
And he brushes this fact off like it's no big deal,

256
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,580
meanwhile Philip Seymour Hoffman's characters like,

257
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,300
maybe this isn't a good idea.

258
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,220
All three characters reflecting different emotional responses to trauma,

259
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,020
running the gamut.

260
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,260
Denial, worry, and anger.

261
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,700
Fuck the corrupt cops with their anus-violating plungers

262
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,940
and their 41 shots standing behind a blue wall of silence.

263
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,700
You betray our trust!

264
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,860
So 25th Hour is great, but it goes downhill pretty quickly from there.

265
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,260
One of the more bizarre relics from this era

266
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:58,140
is a made-for-television Showtime drama called DC 9-11, Time of Crisis.

267
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,860
Made in that brief period of time before Bush and Cheney

268
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,500
were generally regarded as two of history's greatest monsters.

269
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,580
You wanted the job.

270
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,860
Maybe this is why.

271
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,580
This one reenacts the events of 9-11 from the point of George W. Bush

272
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,860
and how hard it was for him, present-intenting.

273
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,340
And it is staggeringly boring when it doesn't feel like a parody wrapped in a dream.

274
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,700
Some passengers on cell phones figured out what was happening

275
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,660
and they took matters into their own hands.

276
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,100
God bless their souls.

277
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,380
Take, for instance, this sensitive scene between Bush and Cheney.

278
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,180
I'm gonna need you at my side at all times.

279
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,340
Go and see the urn.

280
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,100
Main thrust, Dick, is to protect the line of succession.

281
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,820
It was a different time.

282
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,860
A similar made-for-TV movie starring James Woods was made about Rudy Giuliani

283
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,940
for USA Network around the same time.

284
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,580
It was called Rudy, The Rudy Giuliani Story.

285
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:06,060
And, well, it's more watchable than DC 9-11, Time of Crisis.

286
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,140
This is New York City.

287
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,580
I love this city.

288
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,540
Despite mostly having nothing to do with 9-11,

289
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,420
except for, hey, look, he was mayor when it happened.

290
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:22,220
Yes, before James Woods was suing lazy Twitter users who called him a cocaine addict,

291
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,820
he was doing feature-length campaign ads for Rudy 2008.

292
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,340
Okay, got it. All New Yorkers together.

293
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,540
And ne'er a more starry-eyed campaign ad could Rudy have wished for.

294
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,940
What have these bastards done to my city?

295
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,020
God, how I love this city.

296
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,300
Most of it's actually about Rudy's life building up to 9-11

297
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,180
and spends a weird amount of time on his infidelities

298
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,140
and most of it ends up being about Giuliani's women's.

299
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,020
In a weird way, it accidentally cops to the fact that 9-11

300
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,740
was the greatest career boost Giuliani could have ever hoped for.

301
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,540
And then there's jingoism for kids.

302
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:00,300
Tiger Cruise was a Disney Channel original movie starring Hayden Panettiere and Bill Pullman,

303
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,260
which intertwines a fictional storyline about a Navy admiral

304
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:06,460
who gets to take his daughter on a family-based tiger cruise

305
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,580
where his kids get to see what this Navy business is all about.

306
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,740
How many elementary schools did I go to?

307
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,060
Oh, Maddie, come on.

308
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,140
Hayden is tired of being a Navy brat, see,

309
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,380
and wants to talk her dad out of military life

310
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,300
and eventually he's like, okay, honey.

311
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,460
I decided I'm not gonna re-up.

312
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,780
But then 9-11 happens.

313
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,180
Until we know the full extent and nature of these attacks,

314
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,740
we're gonna assume the worst and stay on full alert.

315
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,820
Then when the serious thing happens, it's not a huge deal.

316
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,620
Nothing waving a big ol' American flag won't fix.

317
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,300
There are even two characters who lose a family member at the Pentagon,

318
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,180
but, you know, they handle it pretty well.

319
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,060
Listen, I'm sorry about your uncle.

320
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,740
Thanks, it helps to keep busy, you know?

321
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,820
In fairness to this thing, it is the rare

322
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,100
dad-you-need-to-work-less-and-spend-more-time-with-your-family movie

323
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,220
that ends with, actually, never mind, you do your damn job, dad.

324
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,020
I think you should keep doing what you're doing.

325
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,700
Five years out from 9-11,

326
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,900
we started to see higher profile and higher budget feature films

327
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,380
that were true stories not about political figures,

328
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,940
but about people who were actually there,

329
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,380
and the most well known came out pretty close to each other.

330
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,580
The first was Oliver Stone's World Trade Center.

331
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:29,020
See, you gotta talk to me, because ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

332
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,100
And there were concerns before it came out,

333
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,500
with Oliver Stone directing it and

334
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,540
Oliver Stone having been prone to truthiness in the past.

335
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,160
Ahem.

336
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,200
And by 2006, 9-11 truthiness was really catching on,

337
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,520
especially in light of the 9-11 commission report.

338
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,760
But Stone held back on his truthiness and mostly it's just boring.

339
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,680
Although the intro does remind me of Armageddon.

340
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,920
I want to go shopping.

341
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,420
Me too!

342
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,720
It's mostly a trapped in a hole movie,

343
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,960
with the towers falling about 20 minutes in,

344
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,000
and Nicolas Cage and Michael Peña being trapped under the rubble

345
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,000
for two hours with Nott,

346
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,280
but Nicolas Cage is...

347
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,320
I think that's supposed to be a New York accent?

348
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,200
Every wife, I feel the pain less,

349
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,000
but I'm more numb.

350
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,480
And eventually they get dug out.

351
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,080
I'd call it dull and inoffensive,

352
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,600
but while some of the families of the men portrayed in the movie signed off,

353
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,040
others, namely family members of the dead portrayed in the film,

354
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,480
weren't too thrilled.

355
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,600
And you could call this the apex of capitalizing on tragedy,

356
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,240
but we're nowhere near done yet.

357
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,280
Paul Greengrass took a more Paul Greengrass approach

358
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,720
to his take on the passengers of United 93

359
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,560
retaliating against the hijackers in United 93.

360
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,960
This is a suicide mission.

361
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,960
We have to do something.

362
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,320
At the time, Greengrass was best known for the Irish film Bloody Sunday

363
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,760
and The Bourne Supremacy,

364
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,080
so the Greengrass approach was shaky cameras,

365
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,320
lots and lots of natural looking lighting,

366
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,520
and minimal score.

367
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,360
Unlike World Trade Center,

368
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,680
United 93 had no-name actors,

369
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,200
lending to its legitimacy,

370
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,280
and since it wasn't trying to be an overlong sincere snooze fest,

371
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,200
it was the stronger of the two,

372
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,520
but, you know, it wasn't that great.

373
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,200
The further away we get from 9-11,

374
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,920
the less people quite know what to do with it.

375
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,920
Hollywood had gotten the serious topical movies out of its system,

376
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,760
and that didn't really work.

377
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,280
Nobody really wanted it,

378
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,360
and yet it was inevitable.

379
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,680
And after neither of those two movies were award-season darlings,

380
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,040
Hollywood kind of backed off from movies about 9-11 for a while.

381
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,840
Although that was hardly the end of it.

382
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,960
See, Americans in general are really turned off

383
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,080
by the idea of capitalizing on this tragedy anyway.

384
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,440
Even though it's kind of impossible not to capitalize on it.

385
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,920
Like, I'm capitalizing on it right now.

386
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,520
No matter how solemn or respectful or irreverent or disrespectful,

387
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,000
that's all a form of capitalizing on it,

388
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,680
because it's an inescapable thing.

389
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,440
Our world is shaped by it.

390
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,040
Everything from the Patriot Act,

391
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,000
to the Snowden leaks,

392
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,440
to the Syrian refugee crisis,

393
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,640
and even Brexit.

394
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,320
All of these things came at least as a partial fallout

395
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,480
of the way 9-11 affected the world.

396
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,040
So, while you might think I've hit all of the obvious ones,

397
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,200
this topic runs pretty deep,

398
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,200
and we've got a long way to go.
