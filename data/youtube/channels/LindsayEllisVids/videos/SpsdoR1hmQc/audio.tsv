0	3780	2002, The Two Towers.
3780	7160	Now this one had a special challenge, being the middle chapter.
7160	10620	It had neither a beginning nor an end.
10620	12500	It was the middle.
12500	19940	And as such, it needed to have its own little arcs, like fellowship, its own plot within
19940	24380	the greater plot that felt complete, yet part of a bigger whole.
24380	26980	Did it succeed?
26980	29580	Mostly?
29580	34520	Bear in mind that this trilogy is still the best studio trilogy we've seen in our lifetimes.
34520	37060	And yes, I will fight you on that.
37060	42180	But there is bound to be a weakest chapter, and I think this is it.
42180	47580	Yet at the same time, it's kind of my favorite of the three.
47580	50260	I consider fellowship to be the most consistent.
50260	53140	Return of the King has some of the highest highs.
53140	55140	No!
55140	57140	No!
58980	62700	But also some of the lowest lows.
62700	67100	So while The Two Towers did some things amazingly right, there were still some things they couldn't
67100	72040	quite figure out how to cram in properly with that three hour runtime looming.
72040	75780	So today we will take a look at The Two Towers.
75780	79900	Because you can like a thing, while still examining its cultural impact and exploring
79900	80900	its flaws.
81300	83300	This can be done.
83300	86300	Let me show you.
86300	93020	Let us first start with some issues in the adaptation of characters.
93020	97020	For our first example, let's look at the introduction, if you can call it that, of a bunch of new
97020	99580	characters of the Rohirrim.
99580	104220	Now in the book, the people of Rohan effectively get no introduction.
104220	107500	We, the reader, meet them when the characters do.
107500	112340	We meet them when Gandalf shows up at Meduseld and Prince Theodred is already dead and there's
112340	114660	apparently this worm tongue clown.
114660	119500	So in the movie we back it up a bit and give them the slightest of introductions with dying
119500	124300	guy we don't know and royal vizier who might be just a touch evil.
124300	129660	I can't tell, it's very subtle and some guy we don't know gets exiled or something.
129660	133820	In the extended cut we get even more of an introduction, like 30 seconds more.
133820	138700	At least then we know who dying guy is and who Eomer is in relation to the king and who
138700	142780	this lady is and oh Jesus, God, there are a lot of characters here.
142780	146500	And that's the thing when you're trying to adapt a book that has so many characters in
146500	150140	it and most of the audience won't have read the book.
150140	155340	You don't have a lot of time for each character to get across to the audience who they are,
155340	159560	what their personality is, why we should care about them.
159560	165560	So most if not all of the characters get distilled into a very few key character traits.
165560	167800	So you remember the two hobbits that no one can tell apart?
167800	169480	Mary, it's Frodo Baggins!
169480	170480	Hello Frodo!
170480	174600	The movie plays them up as hapless dumbasses who happen to be at the right place at the
174600	175960	right time.
175960	180200	In the book they know all about Frodo's plan, hell, Mary even knew about the ring.
180200	184240	In the movie they just tag along because why not?
184240	188360	And some differentiation between the two is there, Mary is the clever resourceful one
188360	192060	and Pippin the happy dumb one.
192060	196960	But in movie language these traits are kind of subtle, especially with so much stimulus
196960	199000	being thrown at you from other directions.
199000	203540	So by the general casual movie going public the two get conflated anyway.
203540	213720	The lowest common denominator or the casual movie going public, i.e. most people.
213720	218320	So where in the book Pippin is young, impulsive, and naive, it translates in the movie to him
218320	223040	just being kind of dumb.
223040	236800	So if Pippin's key trait is that he's kind of dumb, Treebeard seems to be that he's boring.
236800	240920	I think I might be one of the only people in the world that really loved the hell out
240920	246160	of the int chapter in the book, and I get the impression the filmmakers weren't too
246160	247640	wild about it either.
247640	251900	Where in the book the two hobbits spend a lot of their time being in awe of Treebeard
251900	257400	and learning about the ints and getting to know their new buddy Quickbeam, who is so
257400	261640	hasty he once interrupted another int in the middle of a sentence.
261640	262640	Snap.
262640	267760	In the movie they spend most of their scenes with Treebeard being bored and then frustrated
267760	269820	that he's not moving fast enough.
269820	273240	Hell by the end of it they have to trick Treebeard into doing what they want him to.
273240	275960	The closer we are to danger, the further we are from harm.
275960	277860	It's the last thing he'll expect.
277860	282040	But what's frustrating for the audience avatars, in this case the two hobbits, is bound to
282040	285000	translate into frustration for the audience.
285000	289880	So it's not too surprising that audiences weren't crazy about the int scenes.
289880	291360	Except for the payoff at the end.
291360	293160	That was pretty awesome.
293160	294160	Trees!
294160	295160	Trees!
295160	299460	Trees killing things!
299460	302780	You could argue, really, that it's Pippin, not Frodo, who has the biggest arc of the
302780	303780	four hobbits.
303780	305860	Hell, the entire fellowship, really.
305860	310620	His journey as a character makes him grow and change the most, where Frodo, well I mean,
310620	311620	you could argue that one.
311620	314980	He gets more and more worn down and Sam just gets devoted-er.
314980	323260	You'll get to Sam next week.
323260	327740	But I would argue that for a movie that has so many characters and this much stimulus
327740	333420	being thrown at you and information that you're expected to remember, it does get across
333420	338780	its intentions admirably for what it does in the time that it has.
338780	341340	But not everybody can have an arc.
341340	344020	We haven't looked at Gimli yet, so let's look at him.
344020	346020	We dwarves are natural sprinters!
346020	349260	Very dangerous over short distances!
349260	351580	In movie one, he's more dynamic.
351580	354300	He has comic relief moments, yes, but he also plots.
354860	359900	If anyone was to ask for my opinion, which I know they're not, I'd say we were taking
359900	361900	the long way round.
361900	367020	He grieves, and then he seeks revenge.
367020	369700	Let them come.
369700	372380	He only has a couple of comic moments.
372380	374840	Nobody tosses a dwarf!
374840	379260	People must have really liked that line, because in movie two, it's dwarf jokes all around.
379260	380260	Breathe!
380260	385060	Oh, your time might get disadjusted!
385060	389580	It's a little tight across the chest.
389580	394180	He doesn't do much but tag along on the adventure, so he's pretty much relegated to comic relief,
394180	395980	while Legolas gets to be the cool badass.
395980	397620	The plane's hit by this line!
397620	401380	Legolas got to be the badass in movie one, and everybody loved it.
401380	403340	And I like the framing of it more in movie one.
403340	406820	It was cool because it wasn't so overt.
406820	409700	He's just, wow, this guy's an amazing shot.
409700	414420	In movie two, not enough to be an amazing shot, oh no, we gotta do it while shield surfing
414420	416140	down some stairs.
416140	418260	Which is to say nothing about movie three.
418260	419260	33!
419260	420260	34!
420260	421260	Biggerrrrr.
421260	429920	We didn't need an army, we just needed a couple of these guys.
429920	434420	That's not to say, really, that there was much they could do with Legolas and Gimli.
434420	437060	There just wasn't that much to work with from the book.
437060	443520	Thanks for establishing some tension, Vegolas.
443520	451500	In the book, Out of the Nine, Legolas is probably the least defined, so in Fellowship, he kind
451500	462780	of winds up being expository man.
462780	466620	The only real moment of personality we get from Legolas is in the extended cut, where
466620	477820	we find out that he, like Gimli, is a touch on the racist side.
477820	480740	So most of the character arc for these two, like in the book, is about how they learn
480740	484300	to be buddies and get along and have an epic interracial bromance.
484300	490740	I think Orlando Bloom gets a bit of a bad rep.
490740	498420	He's not a deplorable actor, he's just kind of, well, surrounded by, come on, outclassed
498420	503180	you might say.
503180	505940	He does have a couple of good acting moments.
505940	510660	And there, right there, that look says, I am an elf and have never encountered mortality
510660	513040	and I don't know how to deal with this.
513040	514980	That's a good subtle acting moment.
514980	518860	You don't see much emotion from these two in movies two and three, just the development
518860	519980	of their friendship.
520220	524580	But I like what little we do get in movie one.
524580	527700	It is there, just not very often.
527700	529700	Right, Gimli?
529700	533060	Oh, he fell down.
533060	538180	The Two Towers features the two plot threads, and there is a cornerstone for both of them,
538180	539780	a centerpiece, if you will.
539780	546380	The first being probably my least favorite giant chunk of the movies and the books, for
546380	548420	that matter, except for Tom Bombadil.
548420	551940	And that, of course, is the Battle of Helm's Deep.
551940	557580	Not because it's bad, but it just goes on and on, and it starts to feel like padding
557580	559300	after a while.
559300	561380	Also, what the hell is this?
561380	564660	An alliance once existed between elves and men.
564660	566980	We come to honor that allegiance.
566980	570740	So, the second to last alliance.
570740	574860	Arwen was originally in these scenes, no, really, so I have to assume that the elves
574860	581020	were like, she snuck in with them, and they cut her part but kept the elves, and also,
581020	584140	this guy goes down.
584140	590560	Do you remember this guy's name, casual moviegoer that saw Fellowship once or twice a year ago?
590560	593100	Or that he was even in the first movie?
593100	598860	Hey, guy, with no emotional bond to any of the characters, did you just show up for the
598860	603900	sole purpose of dying a beautifully tragic death?
603900	608540	So I feel like this little chunk was trying to capture a little bit of that magic that
608540	617300	was Boromir's death in the first movie.
617300	621140	But it works when Boromir dies because, A, it's the end of the movie, and B, we just
621140	625060	spent hours with him, getting to know him, learning his struggles.
625060	631820	I know who you are, guy who was in the first movie and was kind of a dick for like 20 seconds,
631820	633580	but what about Joanne and Cletus?
633580	638420	I guess they'll think this is sad because the music tells them it's sad, but really,
638420	644580	for the casual viewer, no one knows who you are, guy who was getting tragic death scene.
644580	648460	Helm's Deep in the book is really not that long, or dramatic.
648460	652260	Yes, there are 10,000 orcs that show up to fight, but they're quickly driven back by
652260	656220	the awesome might of Helm's Deep and then Gandalf shows up and they get eaten by the
656220	657220	trees.
657220	662660	But the build up to the battle in the movie goes on and on and is longer than the battle
662660	663660	itself.
663660	665940	This is no rabble of mindless orcs.
665940	668580	Okay, so you're saying it's hopeless.
668580	670740	Not that I could fire.
670740	672580	Okay, so you're saying it's hopeless?
672580	674860	They say that it is hopeless.
674860	677260	Yes, we know it's hopeless.
677260	680140	Although if it wasn't for Helm's Deep, we also wouldn't have the best worst shot in
680140	680980	all three films.
692660	700540	Admittedly, it is pretty hard to pick and choose what will end up in the theatrical
700540	704460	cut, bearing in mind that the theatrical cut is the version that most people will ever
704460	705820	see.
705820	710460	But all of this build up for Helm's Deep comes at the expense of some really good stuff
710460	712940	that you only see in the extended version.
712940	717220	Like this scene with Boromir and Faramir from the extended cut that sets up Faramir's relationship
717220	720940	with his father, and the love that the two brothers have for each other, and the preferential
720940	727700	way that Denethor treats Boromir, and how Boromir's not cool with that.
727700	733420	And moreover, we really need a scene to get to know that humanizes Faramir, because he
733420	736340	is an asshole.
736340	745660	The ring will go to Gondor.
745660	748260	In the book, Faramir's a pretty nice guy.
748460	753140	Maybe a little too nice, because not a whole lot happens after he captures Frodo and Sam.
753140	756620	As soon as he finds out Frodo has the ring, he pretty much immediately decides that he
756620	757620	doesn't want to touch it.
757620	759220	He's just that nice.
759220	764460	He's not a dick to the hobbits, and doesn't drag their asses to Ask Gilead for yet another
764460	765460	battle.
765460	769140	And then as if to compensate for the good scene they added in the extended version,
769140	771660	they also added this.
771660	776420	Oh, you're not looking at the cruelty you ordered your men to inflict?
776420	779260	That must mean you have a sensitive soul.
779260	785540	Yes, I understand, in order for it to be a movie it needs more conflict, but in this
785540	790020	case it comes at the expense of the likeability of a character that the audience needs to
790020	791540	sympathize with.
791540	796240	To be fair, at least he does eventually revert to his book character by movie three.
796240	799040	By spending most of it unconscious.
799040	803100	But I said that there were two set pieces in this movie, the first being the big battle
803100	819100	scene, the other one being so bright, so beautiful, ah, precious.
819100	821140	I did not just squeak.
821140	823620	Gollum is the best character in all three books, period.
823620	828660	Yes, I may be a touch partial, had an odd collection of Gollum posters back in college.
828660	829660	Nella loved it, really.
830440	834400	Might have stood in line all night once to meet Andy Serkis, got a picture and everything.
834400	835400	He smelled nice.
835400	836400	What?
836400	839920	Don't follow the lights.
839920	842960	How easy would it have been to screw this up?
842960	846700	We've seen Gollum done a couple times before in other adaptations, and if you're being
846700	852040	charitable, you might say, at least he works within the tone of those films.
852040	857280	Nice master, nice master.
857280	859800	But Gollum is out there, man.
859800	864880	A hair in either direction and we'd have another Jar Jar Binks on our hands.
864880	867960	What's details, Brussels?
867960	869440	What's details, oh?
869440	873440	He's like Gandalf's dialogue.
873440	878920	In the wrong hands, this could have gone terribly, and the decision to make him totally CGI,
878920	882880	to integrate him the way they did, he was a really huge gamble.
882880	886780	They changed quite a bit from the book scenes-wise, added a bunch, but it really distills the
886780	889240	tragedy of the character for a new audience.
889240	891460	The schizophrenia thing is played up a lot.
891460	893460	Master's my friend.
893460	896940	You don't have any friends.
896940	900020	And this scene right here turns on a dime several times.
900020	903940	The audience is laughing, and then they go to sympathizing with him, and then they cheer
903940	904940	for him.
904940	908580	This scene uses its time very effectively.
908580	910860	Also this.
910860	913900	Assholes.
913900	918980	But while we're talking about Lord of the Rings and its influence, I would be remiss
918980	923100	to neglect its main peer.
930140	934540	The very first Harry Potter movie came out about a month before Lord of the Rings and
934540	938620	probably influenced the success of Fellowship very greatly.
938620	942860	It really is kind of a coincidence that the two projects coincided the way that they did,
942860	946640	that the viewing public was interested in high fantasy epics in a way that they never
946640	947820	were before.
947820	951460	Harry Potter may not have been directly responsible for the success of Lord of the Rings, but
951460	953700	it certainly didn't hurt.
953700	958300	Harry Potter is fantasy, but modern fantasy, therefore more accessible.
958300	962060	It's also based on a book series that everyone was reading at the time, and therefore was
962060	966240	bound to be a huge success even with Hollywood's brightest hack making a mediocre movie like
966240	968460	Sorcerer's Stone ended up being.
968460	972740	So in whetting an appetite for high fantasy, the Harry Potter books and movies certainly
972740	976900	didn't hurt Fellowship's grosses, especially considering that Fellowship wasn't aiming
976900	978380	at the exact same demographic.
978380	981780	The Lord of the Rings movies were for an older audience.
981780	986520	Most of the, well we won't call them knockoffs, but projects that were influenced by the success
986520	992580	of Lord of the Rings were clearly trying to suckle that demographic teat from both franchises.
992580	999180	The Chronicles of Narnia, Stardust, the Spiderwick Chronicles, the Golden Compass especially,
999180	1001740	Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events.
1001740	1006500	You look at Narnia especially, which was trying so hard to be the next Lord of the Rings.
1006500	1010460	It was based off a book by one of Tolkien's contemporaries and everybody already knew
1010460	1014440	it, got epic other worlds and fawns.
1014440	1020460	They wanted so bad for it to be Lord of the Rings that they really tried a little incredibly
1020460	1021460	way too hard.
1021460	1029460	DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN IS THIS EPIC ENOUGH FOR YOU?
1029460	1032580	FANTASY WARS AND SHIT YEAH DUN DUN DUN
1032580	1037140	Things can get a little awkward when you try to movie epic-ify a short little children's
1037140	1039340	book into something it's not.
1039340	1040340	Ahem.
1040340	1043220	Also, those movies weren't very good.
1043220	1047660	But these are the more obvious influences and the resurgence of high fantasy as a viable
1047660	1048900	money maker.
