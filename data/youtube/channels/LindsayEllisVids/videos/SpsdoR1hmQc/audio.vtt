00:00.000 --> 00:03.780
2002, The Two Towers.

00:03.780 --> 00:07.160
Now this one had a special challenge, being the middle chapter.

00:07.160 --> 00:10.620
It had neither a beginning nor an end.

00:10.620 --> 00:12.500
It was the middle.

00:12.500 --> 00:19.940
And as such, it needed to have its own little arcs, like fellowship, its own plot within

00:19.940 --> 00:24.380
the greater plot that felt complete, yet part of a bigger whole.

00:24.380 --> 00:26.980
Did it succeed?

00:26.980 --> 00:29.580
Mostly?

00:29.580 --> 00:34.520
Bear in mind that this trilogy is still the best studio trilogy we've seen in our lifetimes.

00:34.520 --> 00:37.060
And yes, I will fight you on that.

00:37.060 --> 00:42.180
But there is bound to be a weakest chapter, and I think this is it.

00:42.180 --> 00:47.580
Yet at the same time, it's kind of my favorite of the three.

00:47.580 --> 00:50.260
I consider fellowship to be the most consistent.

00:50.260 --> 00:53.140
Return of the King has some of the highest highs.

00:53.140 --> 00:55.140
No!

00:55.140 --> 00:57.140
No!

00:58.980 --> 01:02.700
But also some of the lowest lows.

01:02.700 --> 01:07.100
So while The Two Towers did some things amazingly right, there were still some things they couldn't

01:07.100 --> 01:12.040
quite figure out how to cram in properly with that three hour runtime looming.

01:12.040 --> 01:15.780
So today we will take a look at The Two Towers.

01:15.780 --> 01:19.900
Because you can like a thing, while still examining its cultural impact and exploring

01:19.900 --> 01:20.900
its flaws.

01:21.300 --> 01:23.300
This can be done.

01:23.300 --> 01:26.300
Let me show you.

01:26.300 --> 01:33.020
Let us first start with some issues in the adaptation of characters.

01:33.020 --> 01:37.020
For our first example, let's look at the introduction, if you can call it that, of a bunch of new

01:37.020 --> 01:39.580
characters of the Rohirrim.

01:39.580 --> 01:44.220
Now in the book, the people of Rohan effectively get no introduction.

01:44.220 --> 01:47.500
We, the reader, meet them when the characters do.

01:47.500 --> 01:52.340
We meet them when Gandalf shows up at Meduseld and Prince Theodred is already dead and there's

01:52.340 --> 01:54.660
apparently this worm tongue clown.

01:54.660 --> 01:59.500
So in the movie we back it up a bit and give them the slightest of introductions with dying

01:59.500 --> 02:04.300
guy we don't know and royal vizier who might be just a touch evil.

02:04.300 --> 02:09.660
I can't tell, it's very subtle and some guy we don't know gets exiled or something.

02:09.660 --> 02:13.820
In the extended cut we get even more of an introduction, like 30 seconds more.

02:13.820 --> 02:18.700
At least then we know who dying guy is and who Eomer is in relation to the king and who

02:18.700 --> 02:22.780
this lady is and oh Jesus, God, there are a lot of characters here.

02:22.780 --> 02:26.500
And that's the thing when you're trying to adapt a book that has so many characters in

02:26.500 --> 02:30.140
it and most of the audience won't have read the book.

02:30.140 --> 02:35.340
You don't have a lot of time for each character to get across to the audience who they are,

02:35.340 --> 02:39.560
what their personality is, why we should care about them.

02:39.560 --> 02:45.560
So most if not all of the characters get distilled into a very few key character traits.

02:45.560 --> 02:47.800
So you remember the two hobbits that no one can tell apart?

02:47.800 --> 02:49.480
Mary, it's Frodo Baggins!

02:49.480 --> 02:50.480
Hello Frodo!

02:50.480 --> 02:54.600
The movie plays them up as hapless dumbasses who happen to be at the right place at the

02:54.600 --> 02:55.960
right time.

02:55.960 --> 03:00.200
In the book they know all about Frodo's plan, hell, Mary even knew about the ring.

03:00.200 --> 03:04.240
In the movie they just tag along because why not?

03:04.240 --> 03:08.360
And some differentiation between the two is there, Mary is the clever resourceful one

03:08.360 --> 03:12.060
and Pippin the happy dumb one.

03:12.060 --> 03:16.960
But in movie language these traits are kind of subtle, especially with so much stimulus

03:16.960 --> 03:19.000
being thrown at you from other directions.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.540
So by the general casual movie going public the two get conflated anyway.

03:23.540 --> 03:33.720
The lowest common denominator or the casual movie going public, i.e. most people.

03:33.720 --> 03:38.320
So where in the book Pippin is young, impulsive, and naive, it translates in the movie to him

03:38.320 --> 03:43.040
just being kind of dumb.

03:43.040 --> 03:56.800
So if Pippin's key trait is that he's kind of dumb, Treebeard seems to be that he's boring.

03:56.800 --> 04:00.920
I think I might be one of the only people in the world that really loved the hell out

04:00.920 --> 04:06.160
of the int chapter in the book, and I get the impression the filmmakers weren't too

04:06.160 --> 04:07.640
wild about it either.

04:07.640 --> 04:11.900
Where in the book the two hobbits spend a lot of their time being in awe of Treebeard

04:11.900 --> 04:17.400
and learning about the ints and getting to know their new buddy Quickbeam, who is so

04:17.400 --> 04:21.640
hasty he once interrupted another int in the middle of a sentence.

04:21.640 --> 04:22.640
Snap.

04:22.640 --> 04:27.760
In the movie they spend most of their scenes with Treebeard being bored and then frustrated

04:27.760 --> 04:29.820
that he's not moving fast enough.

04:29.820 --> 04:33.240
Hell by the end of it they have to trick Treebeard into doing what they want him to.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.960
The closer we are to danger, the further we are from harm.

04:35.960 --> 04:37.860
It's the last thing he'll expect.

04:37.860 --> 04:42.040
But what's frustrating for the audience avatars, in this case the two hobbits, is bound to

04:42.040 --> 04:45.000
translate into frustration for the audience.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.880
So it's not too surprising that audiences weren't crazy about the int scenes.

04:49.880 --> 04:51.360
Except for the payoff at the end.

04:51.360 --> 04:53.160
That was pretty awesome.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.160
Trees!

04:54.160 --> 04:55.160
Trees!

04:55.160 --> 04:59.460
Trees killing things!

04:59.460 --> 05:02.780
You could argue, really, that it's Pippin, not Frodo, who has the biggest arc of the

05:02.780 --> 05:03.780
four hobbits.

05:03.780 --> 05:05.860
Hell, the entire fellowship, really.

05:05.860 --> 05:10.620
His journey as a character makes him grow and change the most, where Frodo, well I mean,

05:10.620 --> 05:11.620
you could argue that one.

05:11.620 --> 05:14.980
He gets more and more worn down and Sam just gets devoted-er.

05:14.980 --> 05:23.260
You'll get to Sam next week.

05:23.260 --> 05:27.740
But I would argue that for a movie that has so many characters and this much stimulus

05:27.740 --> 05:33.420
being thrown at you and information that you're expected to remember, it does get across

05:33.420 --> 05:38.780
its intentions admirably for what it does in the time that it has.

05:38.780 --> 05:41.340
But not everybody can have an arc.

05:41.340 --> 05:44.020
We haven't looked at Gimli yet, so let's look at him.

05:44.020 --> 05:46.020
We dwarves are natural sprinters!

05:46.020 --> 05:49.260
Very dangerous over short distances!

05:49.260 --> 05:51.580
In movie one, he's more dynamic.

05:51.580 --> 05:54.300
He has comic relief moments, yes, but he also plots.

05:54.860 --> 05:59.900
If anyone was to ask for my opinion, which I know they're not, I'd say we were taking

05:59.900 --> 06:01.900
the long way round.

06:01.900 --> 06:07.020
He grieves, and then he seeks revenge.

06:07.020 --> 06:09.700
Let them come.

06:09.700 --> 06:12.380
He only has a couple of comic moments.

06:12.380 --> 06:14.840
Nobody tosses a dwarf!

06:14.840 --> 06:19.260
People must have really liked that line, because in movie two, it's dwarf jokes all around.

06:19.260 --> 06:20.260
Breathe!

06:20.260 --> 06:25.060
Oh, your time might get disadjusted!

06:25.060 --> 06:29.580
It's a little tight across the chest.

06:29.580 --> 06:34.180
He doesn't do much but tag along on the adventure, so he's pretty much relegated to comic relief,

06:34.180 --> 06:35.980
while Legolas gets to be the cool badass.

06:35.980 --> 06:37.620
The plane's hit by this line!

06:37.620 --> 06:41.380
Legolas got to be the badass in movie one, and everybody loved it.

06:41.380 --> 06:43.340
And I like the framing of it more in movie one.

06:43.340 --> 06:46.820
It was cool because it wasn't so overt.

06:46.820 --> 06:49.700
He's just, wow, this guy's an amazing shot.

06:49.700 --> 06:54.420
In movie two, not enough to be an amazing shot, oh no, we gotta do it while shield surfing

06:54.420 --> 06:56.140
down some stairs.

06:56.140 --> 06:58.260
Which is to say nothing about movie three.

06:58.260 --> 06:59.260
33!

06:59.260 --> 07:00.260
34!

07:00.260 --> 07:01.260
Biggerrrrr.

07:01.260 --> 07:09.920
We didn't need an army, we just needed a couple of these guys.

07:09.920 --> 07:14.420
That's not to say, really, that there was much they could do with Legolas and Gimli.

07:14.420 --> 07:17.060
There just wasn't that much to work with from the book.

07:17.060 --> 07:23.520
Thanks for establishing some tension, Vegolas.

07:23.520 --> 07:31.500
In the book, Out of the Nine, Legolas is probably the least defined, so in Fellowship, he kind

07:31.500 --> 07:42.780
of winds up being expository man.

07:42.780 --> 07:46.620
The only real moment of personality we get from Legolas is in the extended cut, where

07:46.620 --> 07:57.820
we find out that he, like Gimli, is a touch on the racist side.

07:57.820 --> 08:00.740
So most of the character arc for these two, like in the book, is about how they learn

08:00.740 --> 08:04.300
to be buddies and get along and have an epic interracial bromance.

08:04.300 --> 08:10.740
I think Orlando Bloom gets a bit of a bad rep.

08:10.740 --> 08:18.420
He's not a deplorable actor, he's just kind of, well, surrounded by, come on, outclassed

08:18.420 --> 08:23.180
you might say.

08:23.180 --> 08:25.940
He does have a couple of good acting moments.

08:25.940 --> 08:30.660
And there, right there, that look says, I am an elf and have never encountered mortality

08:30.660 --> 08:33.040
and I don't know how to deal with this.

08:33.040 --> 08:34.980
That's a good subtle acting moment.

08:34.980 --> 08:38.860
You don't see much emotion from these two in movies two and three, just the development

08:38.860 --> 08:39.980
of their friendship.

08:40.220 --> 08:44.580
But I like what little we do get in movie one.

08:44.580 --> 08:47.700
It is there, just not very often.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.700
Right, Gimli?

08:49.700 --> 08:53.060
Oh, he fell down.

08:53.060 --> 08:58.180
The Two Towers features the two plot threads, and there is a cornerstone for both of them,

08:58.180 --> 08:59.780
a centerpiece, if you will.

08:59.780 --> 09:06.380
The first being probably my least favorite giant chunk of the movies and the books, for

09:06.380 --> 09:08.420
that matter, except for Tom Bombadil.

09:08.420 --> 09:11.940
And that, of course, is the Battle of Helm's Deep.

09:11.940 --> 09:17.580
Not because it's bad, but it just goes on and on, and it starts to feel like padding

09:17.580 --> 09:19.300
after a while.

09:19.300 --> 09:21.380
Also, what the hell is this?

09:21.380 --> 09:24.660
An alliance once existed between elves and men.

09:24.660 --> 09:26.980
We come to honor that allegiance.

09:26.980 --> 09:30.740
So, the second to last alliance.

09:30.740 --> 09:34.860
Arwen was originally in these scenes, no, really, so I have to assume that the elves

09:34.860 --> 09:41.020
were like, she snuck in with them, and they cut her part but kept the elves, and also,

09:41.020 --> 09:44.140
this guy goes down.

09:44.140 --> 09:50.560
Do you remember this guy's name, casual moviegoer that saw Fellowship once or twice a year ago?

09:50.560 --> 09:53.100
Or that he was even in the first movie?

09:53.100 --> 09:58.860
Hey, guy, with no emotional bond to any of the characters, did you just show up for the

09:58.860 --> 10:03.900
sole purpose of dying a beautifully tragic death?

10:03.900 --> 10:08.540
So I feel like this little chunk was trying to capture a little bit of that magic that

10:08.540 --> 10:17.300
was Boromir's death in the first movie.

10:17.300 --> 10:21.140
But it works when Boromir dies because, A, it's the end of the movie, and B, we just

10:21.140 --> 10:25.060
spent hours with him, getting to know him, learning his struggles.

10:25.060 --> 10:31.820
I know who you are, guy who was in the first movie and was kind of a dick for like 20 seconds,

10:31.820 --> 10:33.580
but what about Joanne and Cletus?

10:33.580 --> 10:38.420
I guess they'll think this is sad because the music tells them it's sad, but really,

10:38.420 --> 10:44.580
for the casual viewer, no one knows who you are, guy who was getting tragic death scene.

10:44.580 --> 10:48.460
Helm's Deep in the book is really not that long, or dramatic.

10:48.460 --> 10:52.260
Yes, there are 10,000 orcs that show up to fight, but they're quickly driven back by

10:52.260 --> 10:56.220
the awesome might of Helm's Deep and then Gandalf shows up and they get eaten by the

10:56.220 --> 10:57.220
trees.

10:57.220 --> 11:02.660
But the build up to the battle in the movie goes on and on and is longer than the battle

11:02.660 --> 11:03.660
itself.

11:03.660 --> 11:05.940
This is no rabble of mindless orcs.

11:05.940 --> 11:08.580
Okay, so you're saying it's hopeless.

11:08.580 --> 11:10.740
Not that I could fire.

11:10.740 --> 11:12.580
Okay, so you're saying it's hopeless?

11:12.580 --> 11:14.860
They say that it is hopeless.

11:14.860 --> 11:17.260
Yes, we know it's hopeless.

11:17.260 --> 11:20.140
Although if it wasn't for Helm's Deep, we also wouldn't have the best worst shot in

11:20.140 --> 11:20.980
all three films.

11:32.660 --> 11:40.540
Admittedly, it is pretty hard to pick and choose what will end up in the theatrical

11:40.540 --> 11:44.460
cut, bearing in mind that the theatrical cut is the version that most people will ever

11:44.460 --> 11:45.820
see.

11:45.820 --> 11:50.460
But all of this build up for Helm's Deep comes at the expense of some really good stuff

11:50.460 --> 11:52.940
that you only see in the extended version.

11:52.940 --> 11:57.220
Like this scene with Boromir and Faramir from the extended cut that sets up Faramir's relationship

11:57.220 --> 12:00.940
with his father, and the love that the two brothers have for each other, and the preferential

12:00.940 --> 12:07.700
way that Denethor treats Boromir, and how Boromir's not cool with that.

12:07.700 --> 12:13.420
And moreover, we really need a scene to get to know that humanizes Faramir, because he

12:13.420 --> 12:16.340
is an asshole.

12:16.340 --> 12:25.660
The ring will go to Gondor.

12:25.660 --> 12:28.260
In the book, Faramir's a pretty nice guy.

12:28.460 --> 12:33.140
Maybe a little too nice, because not a whole lot happens after he captures Frodo and Sam.

12:33.140 --> 12:36.620
As soon as he finds out Frodo has the ring, he pretty much immediately decides that he

12:36.620 --> 12:37.620
doesn't want to touch it.

12:37.620 --> 12:39.220
He's just that nice.

12:39.220 --> 12:44.460
He's not a dick to the hobbits, and doesn't drag their asses to Ask Gilead for yet another

12:44.460 --> 12:45.460
battle.

12:45.460 --> 12:49.140
And then as if to compensate for the good scene they added in the extended version,

12:49.140 --> 12:51.660
they also added this.

12:51.660 --> 12:56.420
Oh, you're not looking at the cruelty you ordered your men to inflict?

12:56.420 --> 12:59.260
That must mean you have a sensitive soul.

12:59.260 --> 13:05.540
Yes, I understand, in order for it to be a movie it needs more conflict, but in this

13:05.540 --> 13:10.020
case it comes at the expense of the likeability of a character that the audience needs to

13:10.020 --> 13:11.540
sympathize with.

13:11.540 --> 13:16.240
To be fair, at least he does eventually revert to his book character by movie three.

13:16.240 --> 13:19.040
By spending most of it unconscious.

13:19.040 --> 13:23.100
But I said that there were two set pieces in this movie, the first being the big battle

13:23.100 --> 13:39.100
scene, the other one being so bright, so beautiful, ah, precious.

13:39.100 --> 13:41.140
I did not just squeak.

13:41.140 --> 13:43.620
Gollum is the best character in all three books, period.

13:43.620 --> 13:48.660
Yes, I may be a touch partial, had an odd collection of Gollum posters back in college.

13:48.660 --> 13:49.660
Nella loved it, really.

13:50.440 --> 13:54.400
Might have stood in line all night once to meet Andy Serkis, got a picture and everything.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.400
He smelled nice.

13:55.400 --> 13:56.400
What?

13:56.400 --> 13:59.920
Don't follow the lights.

13:59.920 --> 14:02.960
How easy would it have been to screw this up?

14:02.960 --> 14:06.700
We've seen Gollum done a couple times before in other adaptations, and if you're being

14:06.700 --> 14:12.040
charitable, you might say, at least he works within the tone of those films.

14:12.040 --> 14:17.280
Nice master, nice master.

14:17.280 --> 14:19.800
But Gollum is out there, man.

14:19.800 --> 14:24.880
A hair in either direction and we'd have another Jar Jar Binks on our hands.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.960
What's details, Brussels?

14:27.960 --> 14:29.440
What's details, oh?

14:29.440 --> 14:33.440
He's like Gandalf's dialogue.

14:33.440 --> 14:38.920
In the wrong hands, this could have gone terribly, and the decision to make him totally CGI,

14:38.920 --> 14:42.880
to integrate him the way they did, he was a really huge gamble.

14:42.880 --> 14:46.780
They changed quite a bit from the book scenes-wise, added a bunch, but it really distills the

14:46.780 --> 14:49.240
tragedy of the character for a new audience.

14:49.240 --> 14:51.460
The schizophrenia thing is played up a lot.

14:51.460 --> 14:53.460
Master's my friend.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.940
You don't have any friends.

14:56.940 --> 15:00.020
And this scene right here turns on a dime several times.

15:00.020 --> 15:03.940
The audience is laughing, and then they go to sympathizing with him, and then they cheer

15:03.940 --> 15:04.940
for him.

15:04.940 --> 15:08.580
This scene uses its time very effectively.

15:08.580 --> 15:10.860
Also this.

15:10.860 --> 15:13.900
Assholes.

15:13.900 --> 15:18.980
But while we're talking about Lord of the Rings and its influence, I would be remiss

15:18.980 --> 15:23.100
to neglect its main peer.

15:30.140 --> 15:34.540
The very first Harry Potter movie came out about a month before Lord of the Rings and

15:34.540 --> 15:38.620
probably influenced the success of Fellowship very greatly.

15:38.620 --> 15:42.860
It really is kind of a coincidence that the two projects coincided the way that they did,

15:42.860 --> 15:46.640
that the viewing public was interested in high fantasy epics in a way that they never

15:46.640 --> 15:47.820
were before.

15:47.820 --> 15:51.460
Harry Potter may not have been directly responsible for the success of Lord of the Rings, but

15:51.460 --> 15:53.700
it certainly didn't hurt.

15:53.700 --> 15:58.300
Harry Potter is fantasy, but modern fantasy, therefore more accessible.

15:58.300 --> 16:02.060
It's also based on a book series that everyone was reading at the time, and therefore was

16:02.060 --> 16:06.240
bound to be a huge success even with Hollywood's brightest hack making a mediocre movie like

16:06.240 --> 16:08.460
Sorcerer's Stone ended up being.

16:08.460 --> 16:12.740
So in whetting an appetite for high fantasy, the Harry Potter books and movies certainly

16:12.740 --> 16:16.900
didn't hurt Fellowship's grosses, especially considering that Fellowship wasn't aiming

16:16.900 --> 16:18.380
at the exact same demographic.

16:18.380 --> 16:21.780
The Lord of the Rings movies were for an older audience.

16:21.780 --> 16:26.520
Most of the, well we won't call them knockoffs, but projects that were influenced by the success

16:26.520 --> 16:32.580
of Lord of the Rings were clearly trying to suckle that demographic teat from both franchises.

16:32.580 --> 16:39.180
The Chronicles of Narnia, Stardust, the Spiderwick Chronicles, the Golden Compass especially,

16:39.180 --> 16:41.740
Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events.

16:41.740 --> 16:46.500
You look at Narnia especially, which was trying so hard to be the next Lord of the Rings.

16:46.500 --> 16:50.460
It was based off a book by one of Tolkien's contemporaries and everybody already knew

16:50.460 --> 16:54.440
it, got epic other worlds and fawns.

16:54.440 --> 17:00.460
They wanted so bad for it to be Lord of the Rings that they really tried a little incredibly

17:00.460 --> 17:01.460
way too hard.

17:01.460 --> 17:09.460
DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN IS THIS EPIC ENOUGH FOR YOU?

17:09.460 --> 17:12.580
FANTASY WARS AND SHIT YEAH DUN DUN DUN

17:12.580 --> 17:17.140
Things can get a little awkward when you try to movie epic-ify a short little children's

17:17.140 --> 17:19.340
book into something it's not.

17:19.340 --> 17:20.340
Ahem.

17:20.340 --> 17:23.220
Also, those movies weren't very good.

17:23.220 --> 17:27.660
But these are the more obvious influences and the resurgence of high fantasy as a viable

17:27.660 --> 17:28.900
money maker.

17:28.900 --> 17:34.260
There are other, perhaps less obvious influences, but we'll get into those next week.

17:34.260 --> 17:38.740
For now, hmm, I feel like I'm forgetting something.

17:38.740 --> 17:40.740
Oh, right!

17:58.900 --> 18:05.140
DUN DUN DUN DUN
