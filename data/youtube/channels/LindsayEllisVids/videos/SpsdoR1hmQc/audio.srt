1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,780
2002, The Two Towers.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,160
Now this one had a special challenge, being the middle chapter.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,620
It had neither a beginning nor an end.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,500
It was the middle.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:19,940
And as such, it needed to have its own little arcs, like fellowship, its own plot within

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:24,380
the greater plot that felt complete, yet part of a bigger whole.

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,980
Did it succeed?

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,580
Mostly?

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,520
Bear in mind that this trilogy is still the best studio trilogy we've seen in our lifetimes.

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,060
And yes, I will fight you on that.

11
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:42,180
But there is bound to be a weakest chapter, and I think this is it.

12
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,580
Yet at the same time, it's kind of my favorite of the three.

13
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,260
I consider fellowship to be the most consistent.

14
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,140
Return of the King has some of the highest highs.

15
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,140
No!

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,140
No!

17
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,700
But also some of the lowest lows.

18
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,100
So while The Two Towers did some things amazingly right, there were still some things they couldn't

19
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,040
quite figure out how to cram in properly with that three hour runtime looming.

20
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,780
So today we will take a look at The Two Towers.

21
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,900
Because you can like a thing, while still examining its cultural impact and exploring

22
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,900
its flaws.

23
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,300
This can be done.

24
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,300
Let me show you.

25
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:33,020
Let us first start with some issues in the adaptation of characters.

26
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,020
For our first example, let's look at the introduction, if you can call it that, of a bunch of new

27
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,580
characters of the Rohirrim.

28
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:44,220
Now in the book, the people of Rohan effectively get no introduction.

29
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,500
We, the reader, meet them when the characters do.

30
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,340
We meet them when Gandalf shows up at Meduseld and Prince Theodred is already dead and there's

31
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,660
apparently this worm tongue clown.

32
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,500
So in the movie we back it up a bit and give them the slightest of introductions with dying

33
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,300
guy we don't know and royal vizier who might be just a touch evil.

34
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:09,660
I can't tell, it's very subtle and some guy we don't know gets exiled or something.

35
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,820
In the extended cut we get even more of an introduction, like 30 seconds more.

36
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:18,700
At least then we know who dying guy is and who Eomer is in relation to the king and who

37
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,780
this lady is and oh Jesus, God, there are a lot of characters here.

38
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,500
And that's the thing when you're trying to adapt a book that has so many characters in

39
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,140
it and most of the audience won't have read the book.

40
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:35,340
You don't have a lot of time for each character to get across to the audience who they are,

41
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,560
what their personality is, why we should care about them.

42
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:45,560
So most if not all of the characters get distilled into a very few key character traits.

43
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,800
So you remember the two hobbits that no one can tell apart?

44
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,480
Mary, it's Frodo Baggins!

45
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,480
Hello Frodo!

46
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,600
The movie plays them up as hapless dumbasses who happen to be at the right place at the

47
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,960
right time.

48
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,200
In the book they know all about Frodo's plan, hell, Mary even knew about the ring.

49
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,240
In the movie they just tag along because why not?

50
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,360
And some differentiation between the two is there, Mary is the clever resourceful one

51
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,060
and Pippin the happy dumb one.

52
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,960
But in movie language these traits are kind of subtle, especially with so much stimulus

53
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,000
being thrown at you from other directions.

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,540
So by the general casual movie going public the two get conflated anyway.

55
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:33,720
The lowest common denominator or the casual movie going public, i.e. most people.

56
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,320
So where in the book Pippin is young, impulsive, and naive, it translates in the movie to him

57
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,040
just being kind of dumb.

58
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:56,800
So if Pippin's key trait is that he's kind of dumb, Treebeard seems to be that he's boring.

59
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,920
I think I might be one of the only people in the world that really loved the hell out

60
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:06,160
of the int chapter in the book, and I get the impression the filmmakers weren't too

61
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,640
wild about it either.

62
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,900
Where in the book the two hobbits spend a lot of their time being in awe of Treebeard

63
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:17,400
and learning about the ints and getting to know their new buddy Quickbeam, who is so

64
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,640
hasty he once interrupted another int in the middle of a sentence.

65
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,640
Snap.

66
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,760
In the movie they spend most of their scenes with Treebeard being bored and then frustrated

67
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,820
that he's not moving fast enough.

68
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,240
Hell by the end of it they have to trick Treebeard into doing what they want him to.

69
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,960
The closer we are to danger, the further we are from harm.

70
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,860
It's the last thing he'll expect.

71
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,040
But what's frustrating for the audience avatars, in this case the two hobbits, is bound to

72
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,000
translate into frustration for the audience.

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,880
So it's not too surprising that audiences weren't crazy about the int scenes.

74
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,360
Except for the payoff at the end.

75
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,160
That was pretty awesome.

76
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,160
Trees!

77
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,160
Trees!

78
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,460
Trees killing things!

79
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,780
You could argue, really, that it's Pippin, not Frodo, who has the biggest arc of the

80
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,780
four hobbits.

81
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,860
Hell, the entire fellowship, really.

82
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,620
His journey as a character makes him grow and change the most, where Frodo, well I mean,

83
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,620
you could argue that one.

84
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,980
He gets more and more worn down and Sam just gets devoted-er.

85
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:23,260
You'll get to Sam next week.

86
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,740
But I would argue that for a movie that has so many characters and this much stimulus

87
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,420
being thrown at you and information that you're expected to remember, it does get across

88
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:38,780
its intentions admirably for what it does in the time that it has.

89
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,340
But not everybody can have an arc.

90
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,020
We haven't looked at Gimli yet, so let's look at him.

91
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,020
We dwarves are natural sprinters!

92
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,260
Very dangerous over short distances!

93
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,580
In movie one, he's more dynamic.

94
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,300
He has comic relief moments, yes, but he also plots.

95
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,900
If anyone was to ask for my opinion, which I know they're not, I'd say we were taking

96
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,900
the long way round.

97
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:07,020
He grieves, and then he seeks revenge.

98
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,700
Let them come.

99
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,380
He only has a couple of comic moments.

100
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,840
Nobody tosses a dwarf!

101
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,260
People must have really liked that line, because in movie two, it's dwarf jokes all around.

102
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,260
Breathe!

103
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:25,060
Oh, your time might get disadjusted!

104
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,580
It's a little tight across the chest.

105
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:34,180
He doesn't do much but tag along on the adventure, so he's pretty much relegated to comic relief,

106
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,980
while Legolas gets to be the cool badass.

107
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,620
The plane's hit by this line!

108
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,380
Legolas got to be the badass in movie one, and everybody loved it.

109
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,340
And I like the framing of it more in movie one.

110
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,820
It was cool because it wasn't so overt.

111
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,700
He's just, wow, this guy's an amazing shot.

112
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:54,420
In movie two, not enough to be an amazing shot, oh no, we gotta do it while shield surfing

113
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,140
down some stairs.

114
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,260
Which is to say nothing about movie three.

115
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,260
33!

116
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,260
34!

117
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,260
Biggerrrrr.

118
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:09,920
We didn't need an army, we just needed a couple of these guys.

119
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,420
That's not to say, really, that there was much they could do with Legolas and Gimli.

120
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,060
There just wasn't that much to work with from the book.

121
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:23,520
Thanks for establishing some tension, Vegolas.

122
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:31,500
In the book, Out of the Nine, Legolas is probably the least defined, so in Fellowship, he kind

123
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:42,780
of winds up being expository man.

124
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,620
The only real moment of personality we get from Legolas is in the extended cut, where

125
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:57,820
we find out that he, like Gimli, is a touch on the racist side.

126
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,740
So most of the character arc for these two, like in the book, is about how they learn

127
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,300
to be buddies and get along and have an epic interracial bromance.

128
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:10,740
I think Orlando Bloom gets a bit of a bad rep.

129
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:18,420
He's not a deplorable actor, he's just kind of, well, surrounded by, come on, outclassed

130
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:23,180
you might say.

131
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,940
He does have a couple of good acting moments.

132
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,660
And there, right there, that look says, I am an elf and have never encountered mortality

133
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,040
and I don't know how to deal with this.

134
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,980
That's a good subtle acting moment.

135
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,860
You don't see much emotion from these two in movies two and three, just the development

136
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,980
of their friendship.

137
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:44,580
But I like what little we do get in movie one.

138
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,700
It is there, just not very often.

139
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,700
Right, Gimli?

140
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,060
Oh, he fell down.

141
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:58,180
The Two Towers features the two plot threads, and there is a cornerstone for both of them,

142
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,780
a centerpiece, if you will.

143
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:06,380
The first being probably my least favorite giant chunk of the movies and the books, for

144
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,420
that matter, except for Tom Bombadil.

145
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,940
And that, of course, is the Battle of Helm's Deep.

146
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:17,580
Not because it's bad, but it just goes on and on, and it starts to feel like padding

147
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,300
after a while.

148
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,380
Also, what the hell is this?

149
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,660
An alliance once existed between elves and men.

150
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,980
We come to honor that allegiance.

151
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,740
So, the second to last alliance.

152
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,860
Arwen was originally in these scenes, no, really, so I have to assume that the elves

153
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:41,020
were like, she snuck in with them, and they cut her part but kept the elves, and also,

154
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,140
this guy goes down.

155
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:50,560
Do you remember this guy's name, casual moviegoer that saw Fellowship once or twice a year ago?

156
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,100
Or that he was even in the first movie?

157
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:58,860
Hey, guy, with no emotional bond to any of the characters, did you just show up for the

158
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,900
sole purpose of dying a beautifully tragic death?

159
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,540
So I feel like this little chunk was trying to capture a little bit of that magic that

160
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:17,300
was Boromir's death in the first movie.

161
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,140
But it works when Boromir dies because, A, it's the end of the movie, and B, we just

162
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:25,060
spent hours with him, getting to know him, learning his struggles.

163
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:31,820
I know who you are, guy who was in the first movie and was kind of a dick for like 20 seconds,

164
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,580
but what about Joanne and Cletus?

165
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:38,420
I guess they'll think this is sad because the music tells them it's sad, but really,

166
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:44,580
for the casual viewer, no one knows who you are, guy who was getting tragic death scene.

167
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,460
Helm's Deep in the book is really not that long, or dramatic.

168
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:52,260
Yes, there are 10,000 orcs that show up to fight, but they're quickly driven back by

169
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,220
the awesome might of Helm's Deep and then Gandalf shows up and they get eaten by the

170
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,220
trees.

171
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:02,660
But the build up to the battle in the movie goes on and on and is longer than the battle

172
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,660
itself.

173
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,940
This is no rabble of mindless orcs.

174
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,580
Okay, so you're saying it's hopeless.

175
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,740
Not that I could fire.

176
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,580
Okay, so you're saying it's hopeless?

177
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,860
They say that it is hopeless.

178
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,260
Yes, we know it's hopeless.

179
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,140
Although if it wasn't for Helm's Deep, we also wouldn't have the best worst shot in

180
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:20,980
all three films.

181
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:40,540
Admittedly, it is pretty hard to pick and choose what will end up in the theatrical

182
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,460
cut, bearing in mind that the theatrical cut is the version that most people will ever

183
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,820
see.

184
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:50,460
But all of this build up for Helm's Deep comes at the expense of some really good stuff

185
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,940
that you only see in the extended version.

186
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,220
Like this scene with Boromir and Faramir from the extended cut that sets up Faramir's relationship

187
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,940
with his father, and the love that the two brothers have for each other, and the preferential

188
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:07,700
way that Denethor treats Boromir, and how Boromir's not cool with that.

189
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:13,420
And moreover, we really need a scene to get to know that humanizes Faramir, because he

190
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,340
is an asshole.

191
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:25,660
The ring will go to Gondor.

192
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,260
In the book, Faramir's a pretty nice guy.

193
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:33,140
Maybe a little too nice, because not a whole lot happens after he captures Frodo and Sam.

194
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,620
As soon as he finds out Frodo has the ring, he pretty much immediately decides that he

195
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,620
doesn't want to touch it.

196
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,220
He's just that nice.

197
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:44,460
He's not a dick to the hobbits, and doesn't drag their asses to Ask Gilead for yet another

198
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,460
battle.

199
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:49,140
And then as if to compensate for the good scene they added in the extended version,

200
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,660
they also added this.

201
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:56,420
Oh, you're not looking at the cruelty you ordered your men to inflict?

202
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,260
That must mean you have a sensitive soul.

203
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:05,540
Yes, I understand, in order for it to be a movie it needs more conflict, but in this

204
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:10,020
case it comes at the expense of the likeability of a character that the audience needs to

205
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,540
sympathize with.

206
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:16,240
To be fair, at least he does eventually revert to his book character by movie three.

207
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,040
By spending most of it unconscious.

208
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,100
But I said that there were two set pieces in this movie, the first being the big battle

209
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:39,100
scene, the other one being so bright, so beautiful, ah, precious.

210
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,140
I did not just squeak.

211
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,620
Gollum is the best character in all three books, period.

212
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,660
Yes, I may be a touch partial, had an odd collection of Gollum posters back in college.

213
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,660
Nella loved it, really.

214
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,400
Might have stood in line all night once to meet Andy Serkis, got a picture and everything.

215
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,400
He smelled nice.

216
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,400
What?

217
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,920
Don't follow the lights.

218
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,960
How easy would it have been to screw this up?

219
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,700
We've seen Gollum done a couple times before in other adaptations, and if you're being

220
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:12,040
charitable, you might say, at least he works within the tone of those films.

221
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:17,280
Nice master, nice master.

222
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,800
But Gollum is out there, man.

223
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,880
A hair in either direction and we'd have another Jar Jar Binks on our hands.

224
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,960
What's details, Brussels?

225
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,440
What's details, oh?

226
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,440
He's like Gandalf's dialogue.

227
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,920
In the wrong hands, this could have gone terribly, and the decision to make him totally CGI,

228
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,880
to integrate him the way they did, he was a really huge gamble.

229
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,780
They changed quite a bit from the book scenes-wise, added a bunch, but it really distills the

230
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,240
tragedy of the character for a new audience.

231
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,460
The schizophrenia thing is played up a lot.

232
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,460
Master's my friend.

233
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,940
You don't have any friends.

234
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,020
And this scene right here turns on a dime several times.

235
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,940
The audience is laughing, and then they go to sympathizing with him, and then they cheer

236
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,940
for him.

237
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,580
This scene uses its time very effectively.

238
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,860
Also this.

239
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,900
Assholes.

240
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,980
But while we're talking about Lord of the Rings and its influence, I would be remiss

241
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,100
to neglect its main peer.

242
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:34,540
The very first Harry Potter movie came out about a month before Lord of the Rings and

243
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:38,620
probably influenced the success of Fellowship very greatly.

244
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,860
It really is kind of a coincidence that the two projects coincided the way that they did,

245
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,640
that the viewing public was interested in high fantasy epics in a way that they never

246
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,820
were before.

247
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,460
Harry Potter may not have been directly responsible for the success of Lord of the Rings, but

248
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,700
it certainly didn't hurt.

249
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:58,300
Harry Potter is fantasy, but modern fantasy, therefore more accessible.

250
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,060
It's also based on a book series that everyone was reading at the time, and therefore was

251
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:06,240
bound to be a huge success even with Hollywood's brightest hack making a mediocre movie like

252
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,460
Sorcerer's Stone ended up being.

253
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,740
So in whetting an appetite for high fantasy, the Harry Potter books and movies certainly

254
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:16,900
didn't hurt Fellowship's grosses, especially considering that Fellowship wasn't aiming

255
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,380
at the exact same demographic.

256
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,780
The Lord of the Rings movies were for an older audience.

257
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:26,520
Most of the, well we won't call them knockoffs, but projects that were influenced by the success

258
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:32,580
of Lord of the Rings were clearly trying to suckle that demographic teat from both franchises.

259
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:39,180
The Chronicles of Narnia, Stardust, the Spiderwick Chronicles, the Golden Compass especially,

260
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,740
Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events.

261
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:46,500
You look at Narnia especially, which was trying so hard to be the next Lord of the Rings.

262
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,460
It was based off a book by one of Tolkien's contemporaries and everybody already knew

263
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:54,440
it, got epic other worlds and fawns.

264
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:00,460
They wanted so bad for it to be Lord of the Rings that they really tried a little incredibly

265
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,460
way too hard.

266
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:09,460
DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN IS THIS EPIC ENOUGH FOR YOU?

267
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,580
FANTASY WARS AND SHIT YEAH DUN DUN DUN

268
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:17,140
Things can get a little awkward when you try to movie epic-ify a short little children's

269
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,340
book into something it's not.

270
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,340
Ahem.

271
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,220
Also, those movies weren't very good.

272
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,660
But these are the more obvious influences and the resurgence of high fantasy as a viable

273
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,900
money maker.

274
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:34,260
There are other, perhaps less obvious influences, but we'll get into those next week.

275
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:38,740
For now, hmm, I feel like I'm forgetting something.

276
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,740
Oh, right!

277
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:05,140
DUN DUN DUN DUN
