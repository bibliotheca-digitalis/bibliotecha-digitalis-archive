0	6420	So I've been kind of sad and bitter and full of rage lately for some reason
10000	13120	And so since Disney is the source of all my ills
13120	16560	I of course spent a lot of time on Disney Plus in the last few months
17220	22600	After watching Moana for roughly the 400th time, I started watching the Little Mermaid a lot
22800	24800	So we're gonna talk about the Little Mermaid
25600	27960	Well, this is this is the brand now
30000	37380	And all of the effort it it deserves you get nothing
38120	39640	So why the Little Mermaid?
39640	43560	Well, I kind of wanted to reevaluate how my feelings on the movie had changed
43760	48840	Because I was mildly like a detractor at some point in history. I think I don't know
48840	53840	I don't remember the 2000s very well, but my opinion is now that the Little Mermaid is good
54520	55640	Actually
55640	58280	Not the greatest ever, but you know pretty good
58280	62680	And so around my 10th Little Mermaid rewatch in the month of April
62680	70000	I found myself revisiting all of the mermaid discourse of the time along with the Disney Princess discourse in general
70000	72240	You know in the 2000s early 2010s
72240	77240	I am ambitious, brave, strong, romantic, imaginative
77240	79240	You're totally repressed
79240	82240	Cause not the Disney dudes, we're just some damsels in distress
82440	85400	And in this state of brain decay, I now find myself
86280	87840	wondering like
87840	89680	Was all that necessary?
89680	93600	What are you gonna do about it? I guess I could stand up for myself. Yes. Yes
93600	96400	No, I'm trying to not wait for a man to save me
96600	101360	Like am I the only one who remembers the lazy Disney pop feminisms of the 2000s?
101640	107440	Because I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that those hot takes that called out Disney movies as not being girl boss enough
107440	111760	I'm not under the sea, but standing on dry land
112360	116400	The moral of my story's changing for a man
116920	122120	These criticisms that have been incorporated into like 10 Disney movies ever since
122120	124120	Lions! Attack!
126320	127600	Let's go girls
127600	130200	Have aged more poorly than the movies themselves
131200	138360	Especially the Little Mermaid. So we're making a thing out of it. I guess I'll make it into a list
138880	143840	I mean lists used to do well in the algorithm. I don't I don't know if they still do
144800	145600	Pathetic
145600	147600	And we're gonna do it in two sections
147960	154720	First we're gonna talk about the bad feminism of the 2000s and 2010s because that's something I haven't really seen much
155080	160480	Re-evaluated and then the gay shit because it's pride month. It's time to talk about some gay shit
160800	163520	Let's go lesbians. Let's go lesbians
164040	166920	Excuse me, lesbians coming through. So this is like the top
168920	170920	Something number
172120	174120	About the Little Mermaid
174640	177200	Somebody should find that poor animal and put it out of its misery
177600	179800	Part two something something feminism
179800	185800	so one thing I feel like we kind of need to I don't know metaphorically smash is the lens of the lazy pop feminism of
185800	190800	The late 2000s through which we have all for some reason agreed to view Disney Princess through
190800	197800	Did I have to assume you made a deal with an underwater sea witch where she took your voice in exchange for a pair of human legs?
197800	199800	No, good lord, how would you do that?
199800	203200	Wait, you got engaged to someone you just met that day?
203200	205200	Yeah, anyway, I'm a lesbian
206080	210320	Yeah, anyway like for a while in the late 2000s these memes are all over the place
210840	214280	Save a prince's life with her only asset her sexuality
214920	217200	Did did we even watch the same movie?
217840	219240	stupid
219240	223200	So in addition to this really lazy one-dimensional bad faith reads of all these movies
223240	231040	We also had the princesses are bad role models for my daughter's movement a 2007 article by Barbara Ehrenreich reads
231880	235280	Disney likes to think of the princesses. This is how I assume she talks
235840	240840	Disney likes to think of the princesses as role models, but what a sorry bunch of wusses they are
241360	247840	Typically, they spend much of their time in captivity or a coma waking up only when a prince comes along and kisses them
248920	252800	So the thing about Disney Princess is it's not a trope. It's a brand
252800	257760	It's a literal trademark the Disney Princess brand reached its peak in the late
258000	263160	2000s and was the undisputed leader in princess merchandising today is a perfect day to get married
267840	274360	With its major move in the year 2000 being when it decided to package princesses Snow White Sleeping Beauty Ariel Bell Cinderella
274360	277520	Jasmine Mulan and Pocahontas under the same marketing umbrella
277840	281800	This move spawned a sales juggernaut Disney and 300 licensees sell
282440	288120	25,000 princess themed products by the year 2007. The franchise was worth 4.6 billion dollars
288120	291800	I feel like what people are grasping for is a critique of a sort of capitalist
292080	298440	Indoctrination that Disney is so effective at with children and it is valid to question the way that it follows people through their entire lives
298640	300640	Hell I am living that right now
300680	308080	But how to quantify the way that that affects people in such a complex system is really difficult and arguably impossible
308120	315000	So the way they went about this was to try to make a coherent narrative a through line if you will if
315600	321240	Girl like Disney Princess then later girl can't be CEO and girl boss
321520	326080	Take for instance this the dumbest critique from the Women and Work Commission
326240	331440	Reporting on gender and opportunities gaps found that while girls are outperforming boys at school and at university
331440	334660	They still earn less than men and the pay gap may be widening
334740	340580	One of the main reasons for this says the Commission is that little girls spend too much time in the Wendy house
340820	342540	playing with dolls or
342540	348060	Pretending to be nurses while their little brothers want to be Bob the Builder from an early age girls are being socialized
348060	355300	It seems for the caring soft feminine jobs that perpetuate gender stereotypes job segregation and lower pay rates
355940	362820	Yeah, so it's totally valid that like childcare and caretaker roles pay less girls shouldn't want to do those
363420	368420	They should want to be Bob the Builder you've had a busy day that not really
370580	375500	Okay, so let's ignore how fucking shitty it is that with these people just accept that extremely labor-intensive
375860	381860	Caretaker jobs just deserve to be paid less because feminine the consequence of Disney princesses
381860	384900	Isn't that little Riley here isn't going to lean in and be a CEO
385100	387980	The consequence is that she's going to grow up with nostalgic feelings
388100	392300	Towards the Disney Company and go to Disney World once a year once she has little Riley's of her own
392500	397860	Where do you find a Mickey pretzel at Magic Kingdom? And is it a snack on the dining plan? Well
398900	401860	Come see us at Disney parks mom's panel.com
402540	408260	and that is worth interrogating but to frame Disney princesses is inherently harmful because they might
408660	414860	Widen the pay gap or something is just so inherently dishonest and kind of revealing Lee
415060	420780	Misogynistic in its own right the question of how the Disney brand indoctrinates children is a question with no clear answers
420780	424100	And it's not really compelling enough to get people mad to click on the clickbait
424140	427180	So they have to frame it as Disney princesses are harmful. Actually
427860	430340	McKaylee might end up as a nurse instead of a CEO
431140	433420	Ariel is the reason for the wage cap
439140	445300	So while I think these discussions are worth having it turned real stupid real fast like we went from
445620	450340	Hmm how might Disney princess influence girls self-perception and reinforce heteronormativity
451020	458860	To pretending like they had any concrete answers to these questions. Ah, yes the wage gap. It's all Ariel's fault
459820	464460	Anyway, it's a really shallow use of your pop feminism and I vote that we retire it now, please
469700	473140	Part feminism something 0.5 Ariel's voice
473860	477300	What I want from you is your voice
478860	480180	My voice
480180	484260	The bad feminism of that era also had this focus on Ariel's literal voice
484420	490660	Which is just such a hyper literal reading of the movie that it's a wonder the Thermians didn't come up with this
490700	498380	No, not not historical documents. They're not all historical documents. I mean, surely you don't think that Gilligan's Island is a
499300	505340	Those poor people Eric doesn't like her because she's silent if anything
505340	510740	It's despite that see Ariel's voice is the first thing that Eric knows about her
510740	514860	If anything, that is the thing that makes her hot not just to Eric, but to everybody
514860	517260	It's the first thing that is said about her in the movie
517820	524620	She has the most beautiful voice in effect. Eric doesn't know her when he falls in love with her voice
524660	527580	He falls in love with an idea. You can't speak
528500	531940	And you couldn't be who I thought but in the three days that they hang out
531940	534700	He actually gets to know Ariel who he thinks is, you know
539420	543060	Eric that's the first time I've seen you smile in weeks
543380	545380	And eventually he kind of likes her for who she is
545540	549700	Even though she doesn't have the one thing he was so hung up on that hot-ass voice
550140	557140	Ariel is basically a space alien and Eric is cool with that. And honestly, I relate to that Grimsby here kind of nails it
557500	560980	Far better than any dream girl is one of flesh and blood
561500	562940	Eric is in love with an idea
562940	567940	But Ariel is a person in the flesh that he actually kind of has to you know do stuff with anyway
567940	571660	I'm not saying this is like the most textured and nuanced romance in the history of cinema
571660	576860	But to frame it like Ariel is silencing herself to make herself hot is just like it's just bad
577300	581900	Media criticism like that's just not what happens in the movie memes
587540	589540	Please
589700	592140	Part feminism point something something
592740	593940	Ariel's character arc
593940	598900	This was another one that I remember kind of like putting forth that Ariel doesn't grow much in the narrative because she knows what she
598900	603980	Wants at the beginning and then she goes for it and then she gets it and another kind of dishonest framing
603980	610360	Is that she again gives up everything for a guy the moral of my story's changing
611200	616640	When really the guy was just the inciting incident like look at her look at this nerd
616720	618640	Look at her like man cave
618640	623120	Like if she was a dude in the suburb, that would be just like nothing but Simpsons pinball machines
623240	626880	so really her desire for access to the human world is a desire for
627280	631920	Mobility and for knowledge and she wants all of these things way before she lays eyes on Prince Eric
631920	636080	This is a departure from the original Hans Christian Andersen story in this one
636080	642200	The mermaid dies but gets the opportunity to earn an immortal soul through 300 years of indentured servitude
642480	648520	Some feminists have argued that Anderson's version allows the mermaid to self-actualize outside of an attachment to someone else
648600	651800	Which makes the original more feminist actually
652360	654880	Why does everything have to be a competition cheese?
655680	660240	But that's not what happens in the Anderson story instead of being in service to a mortal guy
660240	664900	She enters the service of the ultimate patriarch for 300 years. No less either way
664900	668740	It's not her choice to do this thing and it certainly isn't an empowering tale of autonomy
668740	675660	It is which patriarchy do I subsume myself to in order to get that immortal soul to a god or to a husband?
675660	681540	And I certainly don't think that Hans Christian Andersen was trying to make an empowering tale for young feminists
681940	687120	So yeah, just let Ariel have the guy lady. Let her have her sparkly 80s dress. It's fine
687120	693840	Part 4 true love
702520	706120	So Disney films of the 2000s and the 2010s
706320	713520	They wanted to demonstrate growth within the brand and much of this was characterized by a metatextual criticism of earlier Disney canon
713680	719160	Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and even the Little Mermaid which at the time was barely 20 years old
723360	727600	I know it's not that fairytale book you wanted, but this is better. We got Enchanted
730840	734200	Don't see it's okay, you know, let's just walk we got Tangled
734200	741800	Did Rapunzel and I ever get married but after years and years of asking and asking and asking I finally said yes
741800	747220	We got it in Frozen. You can't marry a man. You just met you can if it's true love
747240	750240	Wow, did we get it in Frozen? I could kiss you
752240	757560	Could I mean I'd like to I may I Ralph breaks the internet. Do you have daddy issues?
760120	764880	Thanks, I hate it so the function of these motifs in these narratives is to feel like criticism
764880	769240	But really it's just reassuring the audience that the fairy tale formula is fine
769360	776840	Actually, the main difference here between metatextual Disney and earlier Disney is that the couple gets married after like a year or two
777520	779520	instead of like a week or two and
779880	781280	You are
781280	783280	Giselle Oh
783640	784840	Giselle
784840	786960	We shall be married in the morning
786960	791680	So even within these newer films, there's this reassurance that the heteronormative fairy tale formula is fine
791960	796000	Actually, and it does jive with your modern feminist cynicism see
796560	798880	Rapunzel and Eugene waited a while to get married
799840	805480	Feminism you mean to tell me you got engaged to someone you just met that day
805640	809880	Frozen hinging so much of its plot on that is part of why I can't really get on the frozen train
810000	812520	If only there was someone out there who loved you
817480	821560	That and whatever terrifying evil genius engineering made it crack for toddlers
821880	827440	Another thing about Disney repeatedly lampshading that we got married too quickly thing is it doesn't actually
828000	835000	Happen in any Disney movie like pick one. Maybe they fall in love fast quote, you know fall in love
835000	838840	But there there's never any definite time with regard to the marriage thing
839520	843240	Tangled Wow, you waited 18 to 24 months
843640	846440	well, we don't know that didn't happen in Cinderella or
847000	853480	Sleeping Beauty or 101 Dalmatians or even a Little Mermaid like we don't know how much time elapsed
854200	855240	between
855240	861040	True love's kiss and marriage so you're not even subverting anything Disney. Come on. So this meta textual
861040	866040	Oh, we took a minute to make sure our feelings are real BS doesn't actually contradict any of the old movies
866080	871400	Yes, even Cinderella and Snow White the thing about true love is it's a narrative utility thing
871400	873400	It doesn't have to be super super literal
873680	878080	Especially in movies with literal magic in it where love is hinted to be this magic power
878080	883120	I will make you a potion that will turn you into a human for three days
883800	890000	Got that three days in the Little Mermaid it functions as a ticking clock three days feels urgent
890000	894880	Okay, chop chop ticking clock. So that's why I'm super sick of this form of Disney meta textual criticism
894880	899920	It feels like growth but it isn't because it doesn't actually contradict anything because if it did
900440	902440	That would be bad
907880	909880	Part something character arcs
909880	914860	So in screenwriting terms a character arc is often defined by a want versus a need
915360	919680	The character has a want which is usually an external motivation
921680	924720	And a need which is like sort of an internal motivation
925680	927680	I
927920	935120	Know me wants to be a Las Vegas showgirl, but she needs to I like nice tits
936840	941600	Always have how about you? I like having nice tits. Okay, maybe that's a bad example
943480	946140	Must be weird not having anybody on you
947140	949140	Okay
949940	953260	Aladdin wants to you know be rich and get the girl
953260	957500	But what he needs to do is like learn to be honest about who he is there is a simple one
957500	959180	But Disney does this all the time?
959180	963540	So in the Little Mermaid Ariel does have a concrete want ie an external motivation
963540	970100	I want to be where the people are but not really a need. She doesn't really need to learn anything
970100	974900	She doesn't really grow during the narrative. She has a goal. She strives for it the end. She gets it
974900	979540	So I guess the question is does the character need to have growth in order for there to be a satisfying arc?
979780	983420	Usually in early Disney movies. They don't with the exception of movies like Pinocchio
983860	989900	Generally, the arc for princesses is wants to get married and does and if there's any character growth
989900	996300	it's probably some like side character like, you know, like grumpy learns who not hate women anymore or
997100	999100	The good fairies. I don't know
1000100	1002100	I
1003900	1005380	Can't maybe that's a bad example
1005380	1012460	But anyway by the 90s a Campbell style hero's journey character arc was pretty dereguer for every Disney protagonist
1012460	1017260	But Ariel's conflict is almost entirely external which is kind of unusual for Renaissance Disney
1017420	1022660	Even in the Joseph Campbell rejecting the call to action phase of the character arc, which is exactly what it sounds like
1022660	1026600	It is an external beat in the form of Sebastian singing under the sea
1026600	1033360	Are you listen to me the human world? It's a mess Ariel doesn't have any internal conflict about her journey
1033360	1039240	It has to come from Sebastian, but here's my point about all this. This isn't a bad choice. It's just a choice
1039480	1047120	There's a storytelling truism being that the protagonist is more compelling if they have some hesitance before embarking on their adventure and Ariel really doesn't
1047120	1049120	You know, she was just looking for an excuse to get them legs
1049400	1054240	But would the narrative really have been stronger for it if she had I don't think so
1054280	1054640	I mean
1054640	1055800	I guess there could have been a version where
1055800	1060840	Ariel's the one who refuses the call to action for some reason and then change her mind when Triton's a jerk
1060840	1066860	But I'm not sure how that would have added anything, but then there's also the screenwriting question of whose story is it?
1066860	1072760	It's not always the protagonist a popular example of this is from Mad Max Fury Road. Who is the protagonist?
1073280	1078680	Unambiguously, it's Max. He's the point-of-view character his growth defines the narrative, but whose story is it?
1079080	1085440	Well, it's Furiosa's story. She is the one who chooses to liberate their wives. It's her actions that spur the plot
1085440	1087160	She is the one who's pursuing her lost home
1087160	1089800	She's the one who realizes that her home is now long gone
1089800	1094600	And she's the one who ultimately learns that maybe the real green place is the friends we made along the way
1094600	1101360	So the Little Mermaid as a movie is not Ariel's story. It's King Triton's story. Ariel is the point-of-view character
1101360	1106360	She is the protagonist but the character whose growth actually drives and defines the story is
1106800	1112660	Triton's. Then I guess there's just one problem left. And what's that your majesty?
1113440	1120480	How much I'm going to miss her. And the conflict that drives the plot is this power struggle between
1120800	1124600	Triton and Ursula. Why King Triton?
1127280	1132200	King Triton begins a story as an overprotective father who doesn't support his daughter's interests or pursuits
1132280	1135640	He takes it way too far when he finds out she's been hoarding human stuff
1136040	1140400	immediately regrets it after he goes overboard and Ariel also very justifiably fucks off.
1140720	1146520	And Ariel being pretty passive in the third act in large part because the twist in the third act is Triton giving up his power
1146680	1152140	Well, it kind of works because again, it's not Ariel's struggle. It was the power struggle between Ursula and Triton
1152140	1158220	That was the main conflict where Ursula figured out how to make this horny hot dummy into a pawn in their proxy war
1158560	1160040	That said I'm not saying it's perfect
1160040	1165360	I do kind of feel like act three of the Little Mermaid is the weakest link. The elements at play here during
1165920	1168840	Ursula's gigantism episode are a little random
1168920	1175120	None of it's really set up except for the idea that there are ships on the bottom of the ocean. There's no Chekhov's
1176000	1182680	Ursula getting big. There's no Chekhov's ships bow. Eric isn't established as an accomplished helmsman
1182880	1188380	You know, it's not bad. It's just not as strong as later Musker and Clement movies like Aladdin or Moana
1189140	1194420	Aladdin has a really solid ending because Aladdin is set up as kind of being a little manipulative jerk
1195340	1199920	No, I never actually wished to get out of the cave. You did that on your own
1201820	1203700	It's one of his chief characteristics
1203700	1210020	He tricks the genie earlier and then he tricks Jafar at the end and the idea of genies as prisoners is well established
1210020	1212020	You wanted to be a genie? You got it!
1216140	1220300	So, yeah, I guess what I'm saying is the lack of an internal conflict is not necessarily bad
1220300	1223340	Especially when there's a compelling external conflict
1223460	1229280	But I feel like Ariel's passivity is not really indicative of like feminist fails so much as you know
1229280	1231280	The third act just kind of being kind of random
1231900	1233900	We need to wrap this movie up
1234180	1236180	So long, lovey boy
1237260	1239800	All right, so now it's time to talk about the gay shit
1241060	1242300	What the fuck?
1242300	1244720	number six adaptation and the gays
1245420	1252100	Another thing you always see with critiques of Disney movies with regard to adaptation is you know something something they change the ending or you
1252100	1256900	Know that you remove the dark shit or whatever. Oh, it doesn't look good. It's hopeless
1256940	1258940	Absolutely hopeless
1261740	1262900	Probably the biggest
1262900	1269060	Adaptational change in the Little Mermaid aside from the ending is the original stories focus on the mermaid not just wanting the prince
1269060	1273900	But wanting an immortal soul see mermaids like the Danish themselves don't have souls
1274020	1279860	They just live a long time. But when they die, they turn into seafoam unlike humans who get heaven everlasting
1280420	1281740	It's a pretty short story
1281740	1287260	But honestly getting to the end of it is kind of heart-wrenching the mermaid gives up everything for this guy only for him to
1287500	1291740	Patronizingly go on about how he's her little foundling if he falls in love with her
1291740	1293060	She gets a soul, but you know
1293060	1298300	he doesn't he spends the whole story just kind of being really patronizing to her and treating her like a child and
1298540	1303740	Like wow, if only I could find a wife like you Wow too bad. You can't talk
1304420	1306940	Dogs are idiots. Think about it Smithers
1306940	1312980	If I came into your house and started sniffing at your crotch and slobbering all over your face, what would you say?
1313780	1314940	If you did it sir
1314940	1316540	but then he marries someone else and
1316540	1322220	The mermaid sisters go to the sea witch who gives them this dagger and they tell the mermaid if she kills the prince she gets
1322220	1323220	To turn back into a mermaid
1323220	1327820	But of course at the last second she just can't do it and the Sun rises and she turns into seafoam
1327820	1331900	But a bunch of I don't know other magical angel adjacent beings
1331900	1336700	well, they show up and basically they tell her she can come with them and be put into purgatory and
1336980	1343020	A sort of indentured servitude to get an immortal soul work for us for 300 years and you get your immortal soul
1343020	1347340	So bittersweet ending no prince, but she gets her soul on layaway
1347340	1353820	I guess in a weird way the original story has more of a want versus need character arc the mermaid wants that prince
1353820	1358460	But she needs the spiritual awakening. She needs that immortal soul
1358540	1361020	But anyway, the book is gay AF because like
1362020	1366780	Come on, the mermaid wants this guy and he's like, oh you're such a good friend man
1366780	1371660	If only I was into you we could totally get married if only I was you know
1371940	1377500	Into people like you like even just reading this you're like Hans Christian Andersen wrote this about a guy, right?
1378660	1382340	Maybe Hans Christian Andersen was possibly asexual
1382340	1389060	But you know definitely a romantic and he had a lot of love letters many of them unsent to this one guy
1389380	1392140	Who never ended up returning his affections?
1392460	1398900	so you can tell this is a story about a longing for a person you can't be with and how that person doesn't really want
1398900	1404260	You and how that causes you pain every time you were near them. So you want this dude you can't have
1404780	1406940	But at least there's God
1407580	1413500	Another thing about the queer theory reading of the Little Mermaid is any version of the Little Mermaid is about passing
1413900	1419420	Andersen's version can be read a few ways the most obvious being the crush he had on this dude that he could never express because
1419420	1421420	You know, it was a different time
1421580	1426140	Two bros chillin in the hot tub five feet apart cuz they're not gay
1426140	1429900	But it also expresses his discomfort for passing in high society
1429980	1435700	Which he was not born into and this high society was not kind to the nouveau riche like Hans Christian Andersen
1435700	1439220	This is another reason why the lazy feminist hyper literal
1439620	1441620	mutilates her body for a man
1441740	1446580	Criticism bugs me because it totally dismisses any reading of the text that is anything but strictly
1446980	1451140	Heteronormative and the current discourse the most obvious metaphor is the transgender one
1451140	1455260	Hell one of the highest profile trans nonprofits in the UK is called mermaids
1455260	1460900	But there are lots of ways one can change oneself in order to pass in mainstream society
1461100	1465620	Ariel knows from basically when she's old enough to know stuff that she doesn't really feel at home in the body
1465620	1468500	She's in both in the Disney movie and in the original story
1468500	1471660	And so she goes to incredible lengths to change it
1471660	1476460	So these cheap like Jezebel feminists of 2009 who are like me me me
1476460	1481900	She gave up her voice and mutilated her body for a man like no like I mean, that's not what happens
1481900	1487300	But she's got legs you idiot. She traded her vice to the sea witch and got legs
1488300	1493060	Ariel's whole thing is breaking away from exactly what her society is asking her to do
1493180	1496740	So I'm not saying that the heteronormative read is completely illegitimate
1496940	1502220	But for people to treat it like that's the only read is lazy and basic and I'm just kind of tired of it
1502340	1506580	So anyway, so the OG short story is gay AF moving on part something
1506580	1509460	The Disney version is gay if to just you know, not in the same way
1509620	1515660	They weren't kidding when they called me. Well a witch in the early days of queer theory. This was like, hmm
1515820	1520340	Why are all the villains queer coded? Oh, I shall practice my curtsy
1529940	1533620	But now we've more or less come around to the correct opinion which is yes, yes they are
1533620	1537460	They are extremely queer coded and also they are awesome and we stan
1537460	1542020	You know, my last captain of the guard was a bit of a disappointment to me
1542700	1545540	Ursula is more than queer coded
1545540	1551940	It is well known that her design was heavily inspired by the drag queen divine who was most famous for starring in John Waters films
1551940	1553940	like hairspray I
1554060	1559660	Watch that tramp and I'm embarrassed to be white and pink fling goes this blood turn you on
1559660	1564840	It doesn't more than turn me on. Mr. Vader. It makes me come and female troubles
1564840	1566840	I hate you
1569920	1578040	Voice actress Pat Carroll conceived Ursula as like an aging Shakespearean actress which explains so much of the performance
1578400	1580360	Look at me
1580360	1582360	Wasted away to practically nothing
1583800	1592040	My poor little poopsies and don't underestimate the importance of a body language
1594840	1596840	Thirsty bitch
1598240	1600400	I'm taking this one. Give me the shoe bitch
1601240	1606360	And she ends up as sort of a composite of drag and camp icons Joan Collins
1606520	1609520	No, you know where to find the boys and the booze
1610040	1618120	Tallulah Bankhead my good woman. Would you kindly leave the premises before I grab your pink hair and put it out by black roots
1618560	1624680	Three days Norman Desmond. All right, mr. DeMille. I'm ready for my close-up and of course divine
1624840	1626840	You're a pain too
1629800	1634360	Like in a lot of ways this goes beyond coding this is clearly deliberate
1634680	1640200	Especially considering how much poor unfortunate souls resembles a traditional drag show
1640680	1643960	But you'll find that nowadays I've mended all my ways
1644640	1646640	She uses her eels as a boa
1646760	1650120	This is also the first Disney movie to use Alan Menken and Howard Ashman
1650440	1655960	Who were at the time best known for the Broadway camp hit Little Shop of Horrors quick note on Howard Ashman
1655960	1660760	It's not a coincidence that the most iconic songs of the Disney Renaissance came out of those first three movies
1660760	1661960	but then kind of
1661960	1663960	out after that
1666200	1673720	And that's not nostalgia that's Howard Ashman who died from complications from AIDS in 1991 and while it's not like making never wrote any
1673720	1678280	Good music again. I feel like he was at his strongest writing with Ashman
1678520	1683400	Ashman was deathly ill during the production of Beauty and the Beast and if you really want some heartstrings tug
1683560	1687720	Listen to the people who worked with him described the way he kept on trucking until the very end
1688040	1694200	Howard was physically there. He had lost a lot of weight. He was, you know, he was wearing his shirt with suspenders, you know
1694280	1700200	And trying to be as casual as possible and certainly didn't want to project any sense of of illness
1700920	1702920	um at that point
1702920	1706280	Nobody else professionally knew that he was he was sick
1706680	1712360	Another thing that tends to get lost in analysis of this movie Menken and Ashman had a huge influence not just on the music
1712440	1715560	But also the story itself. Not only did they help shape the story
1715640	1718520	They had the songs and score written before animation even began
1719160	1725960	And in that way also helped shape the characters particularly Ursula who is defined by her big musical number
1726360	1728360	The boss is on a roll
1728360	1730200	Oh
1730200	1737080	That's Menken and Ashman Ursula's drag show basically explaining gender performativity theory by way of Judith Butler
1737400	1739960	But far more entertaining you'll have your looks
1740600	1742600	your pretty face
1742680	1744680	body language
1745800	1751480	Menken and Ashman so the read of poor unfortunate souls his drag performance was deliberate Menken and Ashman
1751560	1756360	Especially would have been steeped in New York drag culture. So I don't read this as Disney being appropriative to me
1756360	1758680	This is Ashman writing what he knows
1759160	1762360	So in my old age Ursula is far and away my favorite thing in this movie
1762440	1765880	Possibly because i'm only about three years away from morphing into her completely
1765960	1770520	But I love Ursula the older I get as a brand Disney villains have always been my favorite
1770680	1774440	And of course most recent Disney movies don't do villains in the traditional sense anymore
1774680	1779560	Like they'll do the bait and switch or the misunderstood or sympathetic motivations or whatever this is
1780040	1785880	But after Shadow Man and Mother Gothel, they kind of petered off on pure fun evil. Come on boys
1786360	1789880	Won't you shake a poor sinner's hand?
1791080	1795880	And I don't know what it is about evil without nuance that I find so appealing in the case of Disney villains
1796040	1798540	But I think it's really just the fact that they're having fun
1807400	1812680	That everyone in a Disney movie is having fun including the bad guy this is why of classic Disney
1812680	1817480	I think Maleficent is the most beloved she out of all of them is having a high old time
1817880	1822440	People don't remember the dalmatians. They remember Cruella. Look at how much fun she's having
1822760	1828140	This is part of why of the renaissance Disney movies the most beloved ones tend to have the most memorable villains
1832520	1834520	Why do we even have that level
1835720	1839800	And that's part of why the black cauldron is widely considered the worst one. I'm, sorry guys
1839800	1843740	I know you love John Hurt, but he sucks in this. Oh my soldiers
1845560	1850040	How long I have thirsted to be a god
1851320	1857560	In fact the black cauldron nearly ended the animation studio until the great mouse detective the best Sherlock Holmes movie of all time
1857560	1861240	Don't at me quite literally saved the studio. Smile everyone
1862360	1865900	Disney now owns the world. Thank you the great mouse detective
1866840	1868840	I have the power
1869160	1873960	Of course you do I feel like it's not one of those situations like the Hunchback of Notre Dame where
1874200	1878280	we all kind of reevaluate whether it got a fair shake upon its first release because
1878840	1884120	I'm losing to a bird. Everybody likes the little mermaid and you know, it's not bad. It's not the best one
1884280	1885080	It's fine
1885080	1891080	But you know there was that backlash that was kind of lazy and targeting the popular thing because that was what the click bait was
1891240	1892760	for a while
1892760	1896200	But thank god we've moved on and now our click bait is like
1896840	1898100	I don't know
1898100	1899940	UFOs
1899940	1901940	Wow, what a good segue
1902740	1910500	Hi, i'm alan smithy the director of this film. Are you tired of science fiction books with lyrical poetic prose?
1910980	1917780	Do you like weird space aliens? Are you a fan of the comical misuse of everyday household?
1917860	1923780	I I guess I didn't really do that today. That was a missed opportunity. I should have done that but you didn't
1924180	1929140	Well, you should pre-order my book truth of the divine it is the second book meaning it's the
1929620	1931940	sequel to the first book which is
1932480	1939860	Axioms end. Oh boy. See this is what y'all tuned in for. This is um, the requisite self promo portion
1940180	1942180	I'm gonna do better this time
1942260	1946500	Because it is a better book. It's got everything the cheesecake factory
1947200	1949200	president dick cheney
1949440	1951440	congressional hearings
1951520	1953520	persians
1953580	1959200	Sadness and the reason I promote these now is that pre-orders are extremely helpful not just for me
1959200	1964800	But for any author you want to uh help so if you have a favorite author you want to support and they have a book
1964880	1968080	That's coming out pre-order their book and then like six months from now
1968080	1971280	You'll get like a magic package in the mail and then you'll be like, oh
1971840	1973040	Right
1973040	1978800	I guess I did order that and the best thing about pre-orders is you do not get charged until the book ships
1979280	1982720	So if I get canceled again, you can just cancel your order
1983440	1986240	So another question I get a lot will there be signed copies
1987040	1989920	Yes, do I know how that's gonna work? No
1990560	1995680	They haven't told me yet. I'll put that in the next video. But if it's anything like last time
1995760	2002400	It's uh putting your receipt for the thing you already bought into like a online portal. I don't know. I'll let you know later
2002480	2006820	It's it's gonna be great. So the pre-order link for truth of the divine is in the description
2007440	2009440	Unless you are in the uk
2009600	2010940	in which case
2010940	2017600	Pre-order the book through your favorite uk-based online retailer because the uk edition has a different publisher
2018300	2024380	And that has caused some confusion. This this also applies to australia new zealand, but not canada
2024700	2028960	And for those of you in the rest of the world, um, I don't know use a vpn
2029420	2034380	I have no control over how to ship to what country or foreign language rights so far
2034460	2037900	the only country that has bought foreign language rights is
2038440	2040140	turkey
2040140	2043500	No, i'm not kidding. I know brazilians. I know
2044780	2051100	Consider petitioning your publishers. Also, I will come to brazil. I promise we were gonna go in 2020
2051100	2052140	but there was
2052140	2054140	You know, there was a thing
2057020	2061260	Hand to your very very large christ we were gonna come in 2020. We'll come eventually
2061420	2066620	so anyway pre-order truth of the divine about which the new york times has said nothing because
2067020	2072860	Uh, they haven't gotten a review copy yet, but in the meantime, thank you for watching and I hope you spend the rest of your
2072940	2074940	pride month stanning
2075560	2077560	ursula
2080780	2082780	Don't be scared. It's only me
2086300	2091180	And you can all come everyone can come every creature in the sea can come
2097580	2100080	Hi father, sorry i'm late
2102940	2106940	Well, i'm not leaving you up there alone this time you mean you'll go with me
2107500	2109500	It doesn't look like I have a choice
2109660	2112780	Oh, it'll be so much fun. You'll see come on. Let's go
2113500	2119420	Hardly, wait. I'm not a fish. I'm a dolphin. That's not very nice to say
2119660	2125900	I'm your official royal pet. Don't you like me? Did you hear that? Cecil the prince is gonna marry her
2126620	2128620	Well, I hope so claudia
2128620	2130620	I hope so
2130700	2136080	Stop the storm stop the storm away sky creatures
2139580	2142880	Oh, you mean they're getting married
