1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,420
So I've been kind of sad and bitter and full of rage lately for some reason

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,120
And so since Disney is the source of all my ills

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,560
I of course spent a lot of time on Disney Plus in the last few months

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,600
After watching Moana for roughly the 400th time, I started watching the Little Mermaid a lot

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,800
So we're gonna talk about the Little Mermaid

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,960
Well, this is this is the brand now

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,380
And all of the effort it it deserves you get nothing

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,640
So why the Little Mermaid?

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,560
Well, I kind of wanted to reevaluate how my feelings on the movie had changed

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,840
Because I was mildly like a detractor at some point in history. I think I don't know

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,840
I don't remember the 2000s very well, but my opinion is now that the Little Mermaid is good

12
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,640
Actually

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,280
Not the greatest ever, but you know pretty good

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,680
And so around my 10th Little Mermaid rewatch in the month of April

15
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:10,000
I found myself revisiting all of the mermaid discourse of the time along with the Disney Princess discourse in general

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,240
You know in the 2000s early 2010s

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,240
I am ambitious, brave, strong, romantic, imaginative

18
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,240
You're totally repressed

19
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,240
Cause not the Disney dudes, we're just some damsels in distress

20
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,400
And in this state of brain decay, I now find myself

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,840
wondering like

22
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,680
Was all that necessary?

23
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,600
What are you gonna do about it? I guess I could stand up for myself. Yes. Yes

24
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,400
No, I'm trying to not wait for a man to save me

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,360
Like am I the only one who remembers the lazy Disney pop feminisms of the 2000s?

26
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,440
Because I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that those hot takes that called out Disney movies as not being girl boss enough

27
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,760
I'm not under the sea, but standing on dry land

28
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,400
The moral of my story's changing for a man

29
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,120
These criticisms that have been incorporated into like 10 Disney movies ever since

30
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,120
Lions! Attack!

31
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,600
Let's go girls

32
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,200
Have aged more poorly than the movies themselves

33
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:18,360
Especially the Little Mermaid. So we're making a thing out of it. I guess I'll make it into a list

34
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,840
I mean lists used to do well in the algorithm. I don't I don't know if they still do

35
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,600
Pathetic

36
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
And we're gonna do it in two sections

37
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:34,720
First we're gonna talk about the bad feminism of the 2000s and 2010s because that's something I haven't really seen much

38
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,480
Re-evaluated and then the gay shit because it's pride month. It's time to talk about some gay shit

39
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,520
Let's go lesbians. Let's go lesbians

40
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,920
Excuse me, lesbians coming through. So this is like the top

41
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,920
Something number

42
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,120
About the Little Mermaid

43
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,200
Somebody should find that poor animal and put it out of its misery

44
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,800
Part two something something feminism

45
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,800
so one thing I feel like we kind of need to I don't know metaphorically smash is the lens of the lazy pop feminism of

46
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,800
The late 2000s through which we have all for some reason agreed to view Disney Princess through

47
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,800
Did I have to assume you made a deal with an underwater sea witch where she took your voice in exchange for a pair of human legs?

48
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,800
No, good lord, how would you do that?

49
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,200
Wait, you got engaged to someone you just met that day?

50
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
Yeah, anyway, I'm a lesbian

51
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,320
Yeah, anyway like for a while in the late 2000s these memes are all over the place

52
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,280
Save a prince's life with her only asset her sexuality

53
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,200
Did did we even watch the same movie?

54
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,240
stupid

55
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,200
So in addition to this really lazy one-dimensional bad faith reads of all these movies

56
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:51,040
We also had the princesses are bad role models for my daughter's movement a 2007 article by Barbara Ehrenreich reads

57
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,280
Disney likes to think of the princesses. This is how I assume she talks

58
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,840
Disney likes to think of the princesses as role models, but what a sorry bunch of wusses they are

59
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,840
Typically, they spend much of their time in captivity or a coma waking up only when a prince comes along and kisses them

60
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,800
So the thing about Disney Princess is it's not a trope. It's a brand

61
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,760
It's a literal trademark the Disney Princess brand reached its peak in the late

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,160
2000s and was the undisputed leader in princess merchandising today is a perfect day to get married

63
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,360
With its major move in the year 2000 being when it decided to package princesses Snow White Sleeping Beauty Ariel Bell Cinderella

64
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,520
Jasmine Mulan and Pocahontas under the same marketing umbrella

65
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,800
This move spawned a sales juggernaut Disney and 300 licensees sell

66
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:48,120
25,000 princess themed products by the year 2007. The franchise was worth 4.6 billion dollars

67
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,800
I feel like what people are grasping for is a critique of a sort of capitalist

68
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,440
Indoctrination that Disney is so effective at with children and it is valid to question the way that it follows people through their entire lives

69
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,640
Hell I am living that right now

70
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:08,080
But how to quantify the way that that affects people in such a complex system is really difficult and arguably impossible

71
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:15,000
So the way they went about this was to try to make a coherent narrative a through line if you will if

72
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,240
Girl like Disney Princess then later girl can't be CEO and girl boss

73
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,080
Take for instance this the dumbest critique from the Women and Work Commission

74
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,440
Reporting on gender and opportunities gaps found that while girls are outperforming boys at school and at university

75
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,660
They still earn less than men and the pay gap may be widening

76
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:40,580
One of the main reasons for this says the Commission is that little girls spend too much time in the Wendy house

77
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,540
playing with dolls or

78
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:48,060
Pretending to be nurses while their little brothers want to be Bob the Builder from an early age girls are being socialized

79
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:55,300
It seems for the caring soft feminine jobs that perpetuate gender stereotypes job segregation and lower pay rates

80
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:02,820
Yeah, so it's totally valid that like childcare and caretaker roles pay less girls shouldn't want to do those

81
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:08,420
They should want to be Bob the Builder you've had a busy day that not really

82
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,500
Okay, so let's ignore how fucking shitty it is that with these people just accept that extremely labor-intensive

83
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:21,860
Caretaker jobs just deserve to be paid less because feminine the consequence of Disney princesses

84
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,900
Isn't that little Riley here isn't going to lean in and be a CEO

85
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,980
The consequence is that she's going to grow up with nostalgic feelings

86
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,300
Towards the Disney Company and go to Disney World once a year once she has little Riley's of her own

87
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,860
Where do you find a Mickey pretzel at Magic Kingdom? And is it a snack on the dining plan? Well

88
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,860
Come see us at Disney parks mom's panel.com

89
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:48,260
and that is worth interrogating but to frame Disney princesses is inherently harmful because they might

90
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:54,860
Widen the pay gap or something is just so inherently dishonest and kind of revealing Lee

91
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:00,780
Misogynistic in its own right the question of how the Disney brand indoctrinates children is a question with no clear answers

92
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,100
And it's not really compelling enough to get people mad to click on the clickbait

93
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,180
So they have to frame it as Disney princesses are harmful. Actually

94
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,340
McKaylee might end up as a nurse instead of a CEO

95
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,420
Ariel is the reason for the wage cap

96
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:25,300
So while I think these discussions are worth having it turned real stupid real fast like we went from

97
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,340
Hmm how might Disney princess influence girls self-perception and reinforce heteronormativity

98
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:38,860
To pretending like they had any concrete answers to these questions. Ah, yes the wage gap. It's all Ariel's fault

99
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:44,460
Anyway, it's a really shallow use of your pop feminism and I vote that we retire it now, please

100
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,140
Part feminism something 0.5 Ariel's voice

101
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,300
What I want from you is your voice

102
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,180
My voice

103
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,260
The bad feminism of that era also had this focus on Ariel's literal voice

104
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:10,660
Which is just such a hyper literal reading of the movie that it's a wonder the Thermians didn't come up with this

105
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:18,380
No, not not historical documents. They're not all historical documents. I mean, surely you don't think that Gilligan's Island is a

106
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:25,340
Those poor people Eric doesn't like her because she's silent if anything

107
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:30,740
It's despite that see Ariel's voice is the first thing that Eric knows about her

108
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,860
If anything, that is the thing that makes her hot not just to Eric, but to everybody

109
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,260
It's the first thing that is said about her in the movie

110
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:44,620
She has the most beautiful voice in effect. Eric doesn't know her when he falls in love with her voice

111
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,580
He falls in love with an idea. You can't speak

112
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,940
And you couldn't be who I thought but in the three days that they hang out

113
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,700
He actually gets to know Ariel who he thinks is, you know

114
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,060
Eric that's the first time I've seen you smile in weeks

115
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,380
And eventually he kind of likes her for who she is

116
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,700
Even though she doesn't have the one thing he was so hung up on that hot-ass voice

117
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:17,140
Ariel is basically a space alien and Eric is cool with that. And honestly, I relate to that Grimsby here kind of nails it

118
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,980
Far better than any dream girl is one of flesh and blood

119
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,940
Eric is in love with an idea

120
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:27,940
But Ariel is a person in the flesh that he actually kind of has to you know do stuff with anyway

121
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,660
I'm not saying this is like the most textured and nuanced romance in the history of cinema

122
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,860
But to frame it like Ariel is silencing herself to make herself hot is just like it's just bad

123
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,900
Media criticism like that's just not what happens in the movie memes

124
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,540
Please

125
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,140
Part feminism point something something

126
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,940
Ariel's character arc

127
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,900
This was another one that I remember kind of like putting forth that Ariel doesn't grow much in the narrative because she knows what she

128
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,980
Wants at the beginning and then she goes for it and then she gets it and another kind of dishonest framing

129
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:10,360
Is that she again gives up everything for a guy the moral of my story's changing

130
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,640
When really the guy was just the inciting incident like look at her look at this nerd

131
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,640
Look at her like man cave

132
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,120
Like if she was a dude in the suburb, that would be just like nothing but Simpsons pinball machines

133
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,880
so really her desire for access to the human world is a desire for

134
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,920
Mobility and for knowledge and she wants all of these things way before she lays eyes on Prince Eric

135
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,080
This is a departure from the original Hans Christian Andersen story in this one

136
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:42,200
The mermaid dies but gets the opportunity to earn an immortal soul through 300 years of indentured servitude

137
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,520
Some feminists have argued that Anderson's version allows the mermaid to self-actualize outside of an attachment to someone else

138
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,800
Which makes the original more feminist actually

139
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,880
Why does everything have to be a competition cheese?

140
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,240
But that's not what happens in the Anderson story instead of being in service to a mortal guy

141
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,900
She enters the service of the ultimate patriarch for 300 years. No less either way

142
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,740
It's not her choice to do this thing and it certainly isn't an empowering tale of autonomy

143
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:15,660
It is which patriarchy do I subsume myself to in order to get that immortal soul to a god or to a husband?

144
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:21,540
And I certainly don't think that Hans Christian Andersen was trying to make an empowering tale for young feminists

145
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:27,120
So yeah, just let Ariel have the guy lady. Let her have her sparkly 80s dress. It's fine

146
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,840
Part 4 true love

147
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,120
So Disney films of the 2000s and the 2010s

148
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:53,520
They wanted to demonstrate growth within the brand and much of this was characterized by a metatextual criticism of earlier Disney canon

149
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,160
Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and even the Little Mermaid which at the time was barely 20 years old

150
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,600
I know it's not that fairytale book you wanted, but this is better. We got Enchanted

151
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,200
Don't see it's okay, you know, let's just walk we got Tangled

152
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:21,800
Did Rapunzel and I ever get married but after years and years of asking and asking and asking I finally said yes

153
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:27,220
We got it in Frozen. You can't marry a man. You just met you can if it's true love

154
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,240
Wow, did we get it in Frozen? I could kiss you

155
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,560
Could I mean I'd like to I may I Ralph breaks the internet. Do you have daddy issues?

156
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,880
Thanks, I hate it so the function of these motifs in these narratives is to feel like criticism

157
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,240
But really it's just reassuring the audience that the fairy tale formula is fine

158
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:56,840
Actually, the main difference here between metatextual Disney and earlier Disney is that the couple gets married after like a year or two

159
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,520
instead of like a week or two and

160
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,280
You are

161
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,280
Giselle Oh

162
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,840
Giselle

163
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,960
We shall be married in the morning

164
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,680
So even within these newer films, there's this reassurance that the heteronormative fairy tale formula is fine

165
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,000
Actually, and it does jive with your modern feminist cynicism see

166
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,880
Rapunzel and Eugene waited a while to get married

167
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:25,480
Feminism you mean to tell me you got engaged to someone you just met that day

168
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,880
Frozen hinging so much of its plot on that is part of why I can't really get on the frozen train

169
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,520
If only there was someone out there who loved you

170
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,560
That and whatever terrifying evil genius engineering made it crack for toddlers

171
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:47,440
Another thing about Disney repeatedly lampshading that we got married too quickly thing is it doesn't actually

172
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Happen in any Disney movie like pick one. Maybe they fall in love fast quote, you know fall in love

173
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,840
But there there's never any definite time with regard to the marriage thing

174
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,240
Tangled Wow, you waited 18 to 24 months

175
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,440
well, we don't know that didn't happen in Cinderella or

176
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,480
Sleeping Beauty or 101 Dalmatians or even a Little Mermaid like we don't know how much time elapsed

177
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,240
between

178
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:21,040
True love's kiss and marriage so you're not even subverting anything Disney. Come on. So this meta textual

179
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,040
Oh, we took a minute to make sure our feelings are real BS doesn't actually contradict any of the old movies

180
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,400
Yes, even Cinderella and Snow White the thing about true love is it's a narrative utility thing

181
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,400
It doesn't have to be super super literal

182
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,080
Especially in movies with literal magic in it where love is hinted to be this magic power

183
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,120
I will make you a potion that will turn you into a human for three days

184
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:50,000
Got that three days in the Little Mermaid it functions as a ticking clock three days feels urgent

185
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,880
Okay, chop chop ticking clock. So that's why I'm super sick of this form of Disney meta textual criticism

186
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,920
It feels like growth but it isn't because it doesn't actually contradict anything because if it did

187
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,440
That would be bad

188
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,880
Part something character arcs

189
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,860
So in screenwriting terms a character arc is often defined by a want versus a need

190
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,680
The character has a want which is usually an external motivation

191
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,720
And a need which is like sort of an internal motivation

192
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,680
I

193
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:35,120
Know me wants to be a Las Vegas showgirl, but she needs to I like nice tits

194
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:41,600
Always have how about you? I like having nice tits. Okay, maybe that's a bad example

195
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,140
Must be weird not having anybody on you

196
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,140
Okay

197
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,260
Aladdin wants to you know be rich and get the girl

198
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,500
But what he needs to do is like learn to be honest about who he is there is a simple one

199
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,180
But Disney does this all the time?

200
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,540
So in the Little Mermaid Ariel does have a concrete want ie an external motivation

201
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:10,100
I want to be where the people are but not really a need. She doesn't really need to learn anything

202
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,900
She doesn't really grow during the narrative. She has a goal. She strives for it the end. She gets it

203
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,540
So I guess the question is does the character need to have growth in order for there to be a satisfying arc?

204
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:23,420
Usually in early Disney movies. They don't with the exception of movies like Pinocchio

205
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:29,900
Generally, the arc for princesses is wants to get married and does and if there's any character growth

206
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:36,300
it's probably some like side character like, you know, like grumpy learns who not hate women anymore or

207
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,100
The good fairies. I don't know

208
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,100
I

209
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,380
Can't maybe that's a bad example

210
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:52,460
But anyway by the 90s a Campbell style hero's journey character arc was pretty dereguer for every Disney protagonist

211
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:57,260
But Ariel's conflict is almost entirely external which is kind of unusual for Renaissance Disney

212
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:02,660
Even in the Joseph Campbell rejecting the call to action phase of the character arc, which is exactly what it sounds like

213
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,600
It is an external beat in the form of Sebastian singing under the sea

214
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:13,360
Are you listen to me the human world? It's a mess Ariel doesn't have any internal conflict about her journey

215
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:19,240
It has to come from Sebastian, but here's my point about all this. This isn't a bad choice. It's just a choice

216
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:27,120
There's a storytelling truism being that the protagonist is more compelling if they have some hesitance before embarking on their adventure and Ariel really doesn't

217
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,120
You know, she was just looking for an excuse to get them legs

218
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,240
But would the narrative really have been stronger for it if she had I don't think so

219
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:34,640
I mean

220
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,800
I guess there could have been a version where

221
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,840
Ariel's the one who refuses the call to action for some reason and then change her mind when Triton's a jerk

222
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:46,860
But I'm not sure how that would have added anything, but then there's also the screenwriting question of whose story is it?

223
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:52,760
It's not always the protagonist a popular example of this is from Mad Max Fury Road. Who is the protagonist?

224
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,680
Unambiguously, it's Max. He's the point-of-view character his growth defines the narrative, but whose story is it?

225
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:05,440
Well, it's Furiosa's story. She is the one who chooses to liberate their wives. It's her actions that spur the plot

226
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,160
She is the one who's pursuing her lost home

227
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,800
She's the one who realizes that her home is now long gone

228
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,600
And she's the one who ultimately learns that maybe the real green place is the friends we made along the way

229
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:21,360
So the Little Mermaid as a movie is not Ariel's story. It's King Triton's story. Ariel is the point-of-view character

230
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,360
She is the protagonist but the character whose growth actually drives and defines the story is

231
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:32,660
Triton's. Then I guess there's just one problem left. And what's that your majesty?

232
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:40,480
How much I'm going to miss her. And the conflict that drives the plot is this power struggle between

233
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,600
Triton and Ursula. Why King Triton?

234
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,200
King Triton begins a story as an overprotective father who doesn't support his daughter's interests or pursuits

235
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,640
He takes it way too far when he finds out she's been hoarding human stuff

236
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,400
immediately regrets it after he goes overboard and Ariel also very justifiably fucks off.

237
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,520
And Ariel being pretty passive in the third act in large part because the twist in the third act is Triton giving up his power

238
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:12,140
Well, it kind of works because again, it's not Ariel's struggle. It was the power struggle between Ursula and Triton

239
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:18,220
That was the main conflict where Ursula figured out how to make this horny hot dummy into a pawn in their proxy war

240
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,040
That said I'm not saying it's perfect

241
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:25,360
I do kind of feel like act three of the Little Mermaid is the weakest link. The elements at play here during

242
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,840
Ursula's gigantism episode are a little random

243
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:35,120
None of it's really set up except for the idea that there are ships on the bottom of the ocean. There's no Chekhov's

244
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,680
Ursula getting big. There's no Chekhov's ships bow. Eric isn't established as an accomplished helmsman

245
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,380
You know, it's not bad. It's just not as strong as later Musker and Clement movies like Aladdin or Moana

246
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:54,420
Aladdin has a really solid ending because Aladdin is set up as kind of being a little manipulative jerk

247
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:59,920
No, I never actually wished to get out of the cave. You did that on your own

248
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,700
It's one of his chief characteristics

249
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:10,020
He tricks the genie earlier and then he tricks Jafar at the end and the idea of genies as prisoners is well established

250
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,020
You wanted to be a genie? You got it!

251
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,300
So, yeah, I guess what I'm saying is the lack of an internal conflict is not necessarily bad

252
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,340
Especially when there's a compelling external conflict

253
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:29,280
But I feel like Ariel's passivity is not really indicative of like feminist fails so much as you know

254
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,280
The third act just kind of being kind of random

255
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,900
We need to wrap this movie up

256
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,180
So long, lovey boy

257
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,800
All right, so now it's time to talk about the gay shit

258
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,300
What the fuck?

259
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,720
number six adaptation and the gays

260
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:52,100
Another thing you always see with critiques of Disney movies with regard to adaptation is you know something something they change the ending or you

261
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:56,900
Know that you remove the dark shit or whatever. Oh, it doesn't look good. It's hopeless

262
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,940
Absolutely hopeless

263
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,900
Probably the biggest

264
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:09,060
Adaptational change in the Little Mermaid aside from the ending is the original stories focus on the mermaid not just wanting the prince

265
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:13,900
But wanting an immortal soul see mermaids like the Danish themselves don't have souls

266
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:19,860
They just live a long time. But when they die, they turn into seafoam unlike humans who get heaven everlasting

267
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,740
It's a pretty short story

268
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:27,260
But honestly getting to the end of it is kind of heart-wrenching the mermaid gives up everything for this guy only for him to

269
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,740
Patronizingly go on about how he's her little foundling if he falls in love with her

270
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,060
She gets a soul, but you know

271
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:38,300
he doesn't he spends the whole story just kind of being really patronizing to her and treating her like a child and

272
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:43,740
Like wow, if only I could find a wife like you Wow too bad. You can't talk

273
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,940
Dogs are idiots. Think about it Smithers

274
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:52,980
If I came into your house and started sniffing at your crotch and slobbering all over your face, what would you say?

275
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,940
If you did it sir

276
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,540
but then he marries someone else and

277
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:02,220
The mermaid sisters go to the sea witch who gives them this dagger and they tell the mermaid if she kills the prince she gets

278
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,220
To turn back into a mermaid

279
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:07,820
But of course at the last second she just can't do it and the Sun rises and she turns into seafoam

280
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:11,900
But a bunch of I don't know other magical angel adjacent beings

281
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:16,700
well, they show up and basically they tell her she can come with them and be put into purgatory and

282
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:23,020
A sort of indentured servitude to get an immortal soul work for us for 300 years and you get your immortal soul

283
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,340
So bittersweet ending no prince, but she gets her soul on layaway

284
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:33,820
I guess in a weird way the original story has more of a want versus need character arc the mermaid wants that prince

285
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:38,460
But she needs the spiritual awakening. She needs that immortal soul

286
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,020
But anyway, the book is gay AF because like

287
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:46,780
Come on, the mermaid wants this guy and he's like, oh you're such a good friend man

288
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:51,660
If only I was into you we could totally get married if only I was you know

289
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:57,500
Into people like you like even just reading this you're like Hans Christian Andersen wrote this about a guy, right?

290
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,340
Maybe Hans Christian Andersen was possibly asexual

291
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:09,060
But you know definitely a romantic and he had a lot of love letters many of them unsent to this one guy

292
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,140
Who never ended up returning his affections?

293
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:18,900
so you can tell this is a story about a longing for a person you can't be with and how that person doesn't really want

294
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:24,260
You and how that causes you pain every time you were near them. So you want this dude you can't have

295
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,940
But at least there's God

296
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:33,500
Another thing about the queer theory reading of the Little Mermaid is any version of the Little Mermaid is about passing

297
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:39,420
Andersen's version can be read a few ways the most obvious being the crush he had on this dude that he could never express because

298
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,420
You know, it was a different time

299
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:46,140
Two bros chillin in the hot tub five feet apart cuz they're not gay

300
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,900
But it also expresses his discomfort for passing in high society

301
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:55,700
Which he was not born into and this high society was not kind to the nouveau riche like Hans Christian Andersen

302
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,220
This is another reason why the lazy feminist hyper literal

303
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,620
mutilates her body for a man

304
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:06,580
Criticism bugs me because it totally dismisses any reading of the text that is anything but strictly

305
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:11,140
Heteronormative and the current discourse the most obvious metaphor is the transgender one

306
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,260
Hell one of the highest profile trans nonprofits in the UK is called mermaids

307
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:20,900
But there are lots of ways one can change oneself in order to pass in mainstream society

308
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:25,620
Ariel knows from basically when she's old enough to know stuff that she doesn't really feel at home in the body

309
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,500
She's in both in the Disney movie and in the original story

310
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,660
And so she goes to incredible lengths to change it

311
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:36,460
So these cheap like Jezebel feminists of 2009 who are like me me me

312
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:41,900
She gave up her voice and mutilated her body for a man like no like I mean, that's not what happens

313
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:47,300
But she's got legs you idiot. She traded her vice to the sea witch and got legs

314
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:53,060
Ariel's whole thing is breaking away from exactly what her society is asking her to do

315
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,740
So I'm not saying that the heteronormative read is completely illegitimate

316
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:02,220
But for people to treat it like that's the only read is lazy and basic and I'm just kind of tired of it

317
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,580
So anyway, so the OG short story is gay AF moving on part something

318
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,460
The Disney version is gay if to just you know, not in the same way

319
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:15,660
They weren't kidding when they called me. Well a witch in the early days of queer theory. This was like, hmm

320
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:20,340
Why are all the villains queer coded? Oh, I shall practice my curtsy

321
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,620
But now we've more or less come around to the correct opinion which is yes, yes they are

322
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:37,460
They are extremely queer coded and also they are awesome and we stan

323
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:42,020
You know, my last captain of the guard was a bit of a disappointment to me

324
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,540
Ursula is more than queer coded

325
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:51,940
It is well known that her design was heavily inspired by the drag queen divine who was most famous for starring in John Waters films

326
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,940
like hairspray I

327
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:59,660
Watch that tramp and I'm embarrassed to be white and pink fling goes this blood turn you on

328
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:04,840
It doesn't more than turn me on. Mr. Vader. It makes me come and female troubles

329
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,840
I hate you

330
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:18,040
Voice actress Pat Carroll conceived Ursula as like an aging Shakespearean actress which explains so much of the performance

331
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,360
Look at me

332
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,360
Wasted away to practically nothing

333
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:32,040
My poor little poopsies and don't underestimate the importance of a body language

334
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,840
Thirsty bitch

335
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,400
I'm taking this one. Give me the shoe bitch

336
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:46,360
And she ends up as sort of a composite of drag and camp icons Joan Collins

337
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,520
No, you know where to find the boys and the booze

338
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:58,120
Tallulah Bankhead my good woman. Would you kindly leave the premises before I grab your pink hair and put it out by black roots

339
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:04,680
Three days Norman Desmond. All right, mr. DeMille. I'm ready for my close-up and of course divine

340
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,840
You're a pain too

341
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,360
Like in a lot of ways this goes beyond coding this is clearly deliberate

342
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:20,200
Especially considering how much poor unfortunate souls resembles a traditional drag show

343
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,960
But you'll find that nowadays I've mended all my ways

344
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,640
She uses her eels as a boa

345
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,120
This is also the first Disney movie to use Alan Menken and Howard Ashman

346
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:35,960
Who were at the time best known for the Broadway camp hit Little Shop of Horrors quick note on Howard Ashman

347
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,760
It's not a coincidence that the most iconic songs of the Disney Renaissance came out of those first three movies

348
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,960
but then kind of

349
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,960
out after that

350
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:53,720
And that's not nostalgia that's Howard Ashman who died from complications from AIDS in 1991 and while it's not like making never wrote any

351
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,280
Good music again. I feel like he was at his strongest writing with Ashman

352
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:03,400
Ashman was deathly ill during the production of Beauty and the Beast and if you really want some heartstrings tug

353
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,720
Listen to the people who worked with him described the way he kept on trucking until the very end

354
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:14,200
Howard was physically there. He had lost a lot of weight. He was, you know, he was wearing his shirt with suspenders, you know

355
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:20,200
And trying to be as casual as possible and certainly didn't want to project any sense of of illness

356
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,920
um at that point

357
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,280
Nobody else professionally knew that he was he was sick

358
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:32,360
Another thing that tends to get lost in analysis of this movie Menken and Ashman had a huge influence not just on the music

359
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,560
But also the story itself. Not only did they help shape the story

360
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,520
They had the songs and score written before animation even began

361
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:45,960
And in that way also helped shape the characters particularly Ursula who is defined by her big musical number

362
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,360
The boss is on a roll

363
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,200
Oh

364
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:57,080
That's Menken and Ashman Ursula's drag show basically explaining gender performativity theory by way of Judith Butler

365
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,960
But far more entertaining you'll have your looks

366
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,600
your pretty face

367
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,680
body language

368
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:11,480
Menken and Ashman so the read of poor unfortunate souls his drag performance was deliberate Menken and Ashman

369
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:16,360
Especially would have been steeped in New York drag culture. So I don't read this as Disney being appropriative to me

370
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,680
This is Ashman writing what he knows

371
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,360
So in my old age Ursula is far and away my favorite thing in this movie

372
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,880
Possibly because i'm only about three years away from morphing into her completely

373
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,520
But I love Ursula the older I get as a brand Disney villains have always been my favorite

374
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,440
And of course most recent Disney movies don't do villains in the traditional sense anymore

375
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:39,560
Like they'll do the bait and switch or the misunderstood or sympathetic motivations or whatever this is

376
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:45,880
But after Shadow Man and Mother Gothel, they kind of petered off on pure fun evil. Come on boys

377
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,880
Won't you shake a poor sinner's hand?

378
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:55,880
And I don't know what it is about evil without nuance that I find so appealing in the case of Disney villains

379
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,540
But I think it's really just the fact that they're having fun

380
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:12,680
That everyone in a Disney movie is having fun including the bad guy this is why of classic Disney

381
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:17,480
I think Maleficent is the most beloved she out of all of them is having a high old time

382
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,440
People don't remember the dalmatians. They remember Cruella. Look at how much fun she's having

383
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:28,140
This is part of why of the renaissance Disney movies the most beloved ones tend to have the most memorable villains

384
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,520
Why do we even have that level

385
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,800
And that's part of why the black cauldron is widely considered the worst one. I'm, sorry guys

386
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,740
I know you love John Hurt, but he sucks in this. Oh my soldiers

387
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:50,040
How long I have thirsted to be a god

388
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:57,560
In fact the black cauldron nearly ended the animation studio until the great mouse detective the best Sherlock Holmes movie of all time

389
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,240
Don't at me quite literally saved the studio. Smile everyone

390
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,900
Disney now owns the world. Thank you the great mouse detective

391
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,840
I have the power

392
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,960
Of course you do I feel like it's not one of those situations like the Hunchback of Notre Dame where

393
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,280
we all kind of reevaluate whether it got a fair shake upon its first release because

394
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:24,120
I'm losing to a bird. Everybody likes the little mermaid and you know, it's not bad. It's not the best one

395
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,080
It's fine

396
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:31,080
But you know there was that backlash that was kind of lazy and targeting the popular thing because that was what the click bait was

397
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,760
for a while

398
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,200
But thank god we've moved on and now our click bait is like

399
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,100
I don't know

400
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,940
UFOs

401
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,940
Wow, what a good segue

402
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:50,500
Hi, i'm alan smithy the director of this film. Are you tired of science fiction books with lyrical poetic prose?

403
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:57,780
Do you like weird space aliens? Are you a fan of the comical misuse of everyday household?

404
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:03,780
I I guess I didn't really do that today. That was a missed opportunity. I should have done that but you didn't

405
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:09,140
Well, you should pre-order my book truth of the divine it is the second book meaning it's the

406
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,940
sequel to the first book which is

407
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:19,860
Axioms end. Oh boy. See this is what y'all tuned in for. This is um, the requisite self promo portion

408
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,180
I'm gonna do better this time

409
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:26,500
Because it is a better book. It's got everything the cheesecake factory

410
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,200
president dick cheney

411
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,440
congressional hearings

412
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,520
persians

413
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:39,200
Sadness and the reason I promote these now is that pre-orders are extremely helpful not just for me

414
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,800
But for any author you want to uh help so if you have a favorite author you want to support and they have a book

415
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,080
That's coming out pre-order their book and then like six months from now

416
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,280
You'll get like a magic package in the mail and then you'll be like, oh

417
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,040
Right

418
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:58,800
I guess I did order that and the best thing about pre-orders is you do not get charged until the book ships

419
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,720
So if I get canceled again, you can just cancel your order

420
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,240
So another question I get a lot will there be signed copies

421
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,920
Yes, do I know how that's gonna work? No

422
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:15,680
They haven't told me yet. I'll put that in the next video. But if it's anything like last time

423
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:22,400
It's uh putting your receipt for the thing you already bought into like a online portal. I don't know. I'll let you know later

424
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,820
It's it's gonna be great. So the pre-order link for truth of the divine is in the description

425
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,440
Unless you are in the uk

426
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,940
in which case

427
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:37,600
Pre-order the book through your favorite uk-based online retailer because the uk edition has a different publisher

428
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:44,380
And that has caused some confusion. This this also applies to australia new zealand, but not canada

429
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:48,960
And for those of you in the rest of the world, um, I don't know use a vpn

430
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:54,380
I have no control over how to ship to what country or foreign language rights so far

431
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,900
the only country that has bought foreign language rights is

432
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,140
turkey

433
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,500
No, i'm not kidding. I know brazilians. I know

434
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:11,100
Consider petitioning your publishers. Also, I will come to brazil. I promise we were gonna go in 2020

435
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,140
but there was

436
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,140
You know, there was a thing

437
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:21,260
Hand to your very very large christ we were gonna come in 2020. We'll come eventually

438
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:26,620
so anyway pre-order truth of the divine about which the new york times has said nothing because

439
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:32,860
Uh, they haven't gotten a review copy yet, but in the meantime, thank you for watching and I hope you spend the rest of your

440
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,940
pride month stanning

441
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,560
ursula

442
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,780
Don't be scared. It's only me

443
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:51,180
And you can all come everyone can come every creature in the sea can come

444
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:00,080
Hi father, sorry i'm late

445
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,940
Well, i'm not leaving you up there alone this time you mean you'll go with me

446
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,500
It doesn't look like I have a choice

447
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,780
Oh, it'll be so much fun. You'll see come on. Let's go

448
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:19,420
Hardly, wait. I'm not a fish. I'm a dolphin. That's not very nice to say

449
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:25,900
I'm your official royal pet. Don't you like me? Did you hear that? Cecil the prince is gonna marry her

450
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,620
Well, I hope so claudia

451
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,620
I hope so

452
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:36,080
Stop the storm stop the storm away sky creatures

453
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,880
Oh, you mean they're getting married
