WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.420
So I've been kind of sad and bitter and full of rage lately for some reason

00:10.000 --> 00:13.120
And so since Disney is the source of all my ills

00:13.120 --> 00:16.560
I of course spent a lot of time on Disney Plus in the last few months

00:17.220 --> 00:22.600
After watching Moana for roughly the 400th time, I started watching the Little Mermaid a lot

00:22.800 --> 00:24.800
So we're gonna talk about the Little Mermaid

00:25.600 --> 00:27.960
Well, this is this is the brand now

00:30.000 --> 00:37.380
And all of the effort it it deserves you get nothing

00:38.120 --> 00:39.640
So why the Little Mermaid?

00:39.640 --> 00:43.560
Well, I kind of wanted to reevaluate how my feelings on the movie had changed

00:43.760 --> 00:48.840
Because I was mildly like a detractor at some point in history. I think I don't know

00:48.840 --> 00:53.840
I don't remember the 2000s very well, but my opinion is now that the Little Mermaid is good

00:54.520 --> 00:55.640
Actually

00:55.640 --> 00:58.280
Not the greatest ever, but you know pretty good

00:58.280 --> 01:02.680
And so around my 10th Little Mermaid rewatch in the month of April

01:02.680 --> 01:10.000
I found myself revisiting all of the mermaid discourse of the time along with the Disney Princess discourse in general

01:10.000 --> 01:12.240
You know in the 2000s early 2010s

01:12.240 --> 01:17.240
I am ambitious, brave, strong, romantic, imaginative

01:17.240 --> 01:19.240
You're totally repressed

01:19.240 --> 01:22.240
Cause not the Disney dudes, we're just some damsels in distress

01:22.440 --> 01:25.400
And in this state of brain decay, I now find myself

01:26.280 --> 01:27.840
wondering like

01:27.840 --> 01:29.680
Was all that necessary?

01:29.680 --> 01:33.600
What are you gonna do about it? I guess I could stand up for myself. Yes. Yes

01:33.600 --> 01:36.400
No, I'm trying to not wait for a man to save me

01:36.600 --> 01:41.360
Like am I the only one who remembers the lazy Disney pop feminisms of the 2000s?

01:41.640 --> 01:47.440
Because I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that those hot takes that called out Disney movies as not being girl boss enough

01:47.440 --> 01:51.760
I'm not under the sea, but standing on dry land

01:52.360 --> 01:56.400
The moral of my story's changing for a man

01:56.920 --> 02:02.120
These criticisms that have been incorporated into like 10 Disney movies ever since

02:02.120 --> 02:04.120
Lions! Attack!

02:06.320 --> 02:07.600
Let's go girls

02:07.600 --> 02:10.200
Have aged more poorly than the movies themselves

02:11.200 --> 02:18.360
Especially the Little Mermaid. So we're making a thing out of it. I guess I'll make it into a list

02:18.880 --> 02:23.840
I mean lists used to do well in the algorithm. I don't I don't know if they still do

02:24.800 --> 02:25.600
Pathetic

02:25.600 --> 02:27.600
And we're gonna do it in two sections

02:27.960 --> 02:34.720
First we're gonna talk about the bad feminism of the 2000s and 2010s because that's something I haven't really seen much

02:35.080 --> 02:40.480
Re-evaluated and then the gay shit because it's pride month. It's time to talk about some gay shit

02:40.800 --> 02:43.520
Let's go lesbians. Let's go lesbians

02:44.040 --> 02:46.920
Excuse me, lesbians coming through. So this is like the top

02:48.920 --> 02:50.920
Something number

02:52.120 --> 02:54.120
About the Little Mermaid

02:54.640 --> 02:57.200
Somebody should find that poor animal and put it out of its misery

02:57.600 --> 02:59.800
Part two something something feminism

02:59.800 --> 03:05.800
so one thing I feel like we kind of need to I don't know metaphorically smash is the lens of the lazy pop feminism of

03:05.800 --> 03:10.800
The late 2000s through which we have all for some reason agreed to view Disney Princess through

03:10.800 --> 03:17.800
Did I have to assume you made a deal with an underwater sea witch where she took your voice in exchange for a pair of human legs?

03:17.800 --> 03:19.800
No, good lord, how would you do that?

03:19.800 --> 03:23.200
Wait, you got engaged to someone you just met that day?

03:23.200 --> 03:25.200
Yeah, anyway, I'm a lesbian

03:26.080 --> 03:30.320
Yeah, anyway like for a while in the late 2000s these memes are all over the place

03:30.840 --> 03:34.280
Save a prince's life with her only asset her sexuality

03:34.920 --> 03:37.200
Did did we even watch the same movie?

03:37.840 --> 03:39.240
stupid

03:39.240 --> 03:43.200
So in addition to this really lazy one-dimensional bad faith reads of all these movies

03:43.240 --> 03:51.040
We also had the princesses are bad role models for my daughter's movement a 2007 article by Barbara Ehrenreich reads

03:51.880 --> 03:55.280
Disney likes to think of the princesses. This is how I assume she talks

03:55.840 --> 04:00.840
Disney likes to think of the princesses as role models, but what a sorry bunch of wusses they are

04:01.360 --> 04:07.840
Typically, they spend much of their time in captivity or a coma waking up only when a prince comes along and kisses them

04:08.920 --> 04:12.800
So the thing about Disney Princess is it's not a trope. It's a brand

04:12.800 --> 04:17.760
It's a literal trademark the Disney Princess brand reached its peak in the late

04:18.000 --> 04:23.160
2000s and was the undisputed leader in princess merchandising today is a perfect day to get married

04:27.840 --> 04:34.360
With its major move in the year 2000 being when it decided to package princesses Snow White Sleeping Beauty Ariel Bell Cinderella

04:34.360 --> 04:37.520
Jasmine Mulan and Pocahontas under the same marketing umbrella

04:37.840 --> 04:41.800
This move spawned a sales juggernaut Disney and 300 licensees sell

04:42.440 --> 04:48.120
25,000 princess themed products by the year 2007. The franchise was worth 4.6 billion dollars

04:48.120 --> 04:51.800
I feel like what people are grasping for is a critique of a sort of capitalist

04:52.080 --> 04:58.440
Indoctrination that Disney is so effective at with children and it is valid to question the way that it follows people through their entire lives

04:58.640 --> 05:00.640
Hell I am living that right now

05:00.680 --> 05:08.080
But how to quantify the way that that affects people in such a complex system is really difficult and arguably impossible

05:08.120 --> 05:15.000
So the way they went about this was to try to make a coherent narrative a through line if you will if

05:15.600 --> 05:21.240
Girl like Disney Princess then later girl can't be CEO and girl boss

05:21.520 --> 05:26.080
Take for instance this the dumbest critique from the Women and Work Commission

05:26.240 --> 05:31.440
Reporting on gender and opportunities gaps found that while girls are outperforming boys at school and at university

05:31.440 --> 05:34.660
They still earn less than men and the pay gap may be widening

05:34.740 --> 05:40.580
One of the main reasons for this says the Commission is that little girls spend too much time in the Wendy house

05:40.820 --> 05:42.540
playing with dolls or

05:42.540 --> 05:48.060
Pretending to be nurses while their little brothers want to be Bob the Builder from an early age girls are being socialized

05:48.060 --> 05:55.300
It seems for the caring soft feminine jobs that perpetuate gender stereotypes job segregation and lower pay rates

05:55.940 --> 06:02.820
Yeah, so it's totally valid that like childcare and caretaker roles pay less girls shouldn't want to do those

06:03.420 --> 06:08.420
They should want to be Bob the Builder you've had a busy day that not really

06:10.580 --> 06:15.500
Okay, so let's ignore how fucking shitty it is that with these people just accept that extremely labor-intensive

06:15.860 --> 06:21.860
Caretaker jobs just deserve to be paid less because feminine the consequence of Disney princesses

06:21.860 --> 06:24.900
Isn't that little Riley here isn't going to lean in and be a CEO

06:25.100 --> 06:27.980
The consequence is that she's going to grow up with nostalgic feelings

06:28.100 --> 06:32.300
Towards the Disney Company and go to Disney World once a year once she has little Riley's of her own

06:32.500 --> 06:37.860
Where do you find a Mickey pretzel at Magic Kingdom? And is it a snack on the dining plan? Well

06:38.900 --> 06:41.860
Come see us at Disney parks mom's panel.com

06:42.540 --> 06:48.260
and that is worth interrogating but to frame Disney princesses is inherently harmful because they might

06:48.660 --> 06:54.860
Widen the pay gap or something is just so inherently dishonest and kind of revealing Lee

06:55.060 --> 07:00.780
Misogynistic in its own right the question of how the Disney brand indoctrinates children is a question with no clear answers

07:00.780 --> 07:04.100
And it's not really compelling enough to get people mad to click on the clickbait

07:04.140 --> 07:07.180
So they have to frame it as Disney princesses are harmful. Actually

07:07.860 --> 07:10.340
McKaylee might end up as a nurse instead of a CEO

07:11.140 --> 07:13.420
Ariel is the reason for the wage cap

07:19.140 --> 07:25.300
So while I think these discussions are worth having it turned real stupid real fast like we went from

07:25.620 --> 07:30.340
Hmm how might Disney princess influence girls self-perception and reinforce heteronormativity

07:31.020 --> 07:38.860
To pretending like they had any concrete answers to these questions. Ah, yes the wage gap. It's all Ariel's fault

07:39.820 --> 07:44.460
Anyway, it's a really shallow use of your pop feminism and I vote that we retire it now, please

07:49.700 --> 07:53.140
Part feminism something 0.5 Ariel's voice

07:53.860 --> 07:57.300
What I want from you is your voice

07:58.860 --> 08:00.180
My voice

08:00.180 --> 08:04.260
The bad feminism of that era also had this focus on Ariel's literal voice

08:04.420 --> 08:10.660
Which is just such a hyper literal reading of the movie that it's a wonder the Thermians didn't come up with this

08:10.700 --> 08:18.380
No, not not historical documents. They're not all historical documents. I mean, surely you don't think that Gilligan's Island is a

08:19.300 --> 08:25.340
Those poor people Eric doesn't like her because she's silent if anything

08:25.340 --> 08:30.740
It's despite that see Ariel's voice is the first thing that Eric knows about her

08:30.740 --> 08:34.860
If anything, that is the thing that makes her hot not just to Eric, but to everybody

08:34.860 --> 08:37.260
It's the first thing that is said about her in the movie

08:37.820 --> 08:44.620
She has the most beautiful voice in effect. Eric doesn't know her when he falls in love with her voice

08:44.660 --> 08:47.580
He falls in love with an idea. You can't speak

08:48.500 --> 08:51.940
And you couldn't be who I thought but in the three days that they hang out

08:51.940 --> 08:54.700
He actually gets to know Ariel who he thinks is, you know

08:59.420 --> 09:03.060
Eric that's the first time I've seen you smile in weeks

09:03.380 --> 09:05.380
And eventually he kind of likes her for who she is

09:05.540 --> 09:09.700
Even though she doesn't have the one thing he was so hung up on that hot-ass voice

09:10.140 --> 09:17.140
Ariel is basically a space alien and Eric is cool with that. And honestly, I relate to that Grimsby here kind of nails it

09:17.500 --> 09:20.980
Far better than any dream girl is one of flesh and blood

09:21.500 --> 09:22.940
Eric is in love with an idea

09:22.940 --> 09:27.940
But Ariel is a person in the flesh that he actually kind of has to you know do stuff with anyway

09:27.940 --> 09:31.660
I'm not saying this is like the most textured and nuanced romance in the history of cinema

09:31.660 --> 09:36.860
But to frame it like Ariel is silencing herself to make herself hot is just like it's just bad

09:37.300 --> 09:41.900
Media criticism like that's just not what happens in the movie memes

09:47.540 --> 09:49.540
Please

09:49.700 --> 09:52.140
Part feminism point something something

09:52.740 --> 09:53.940
Ariel's character arc

09:53.940 --> 09:58.900
This was another one that I remember kind of like putting forth that Ariel doesn't grow much in the narrative because she knows what she

09:58.900 --> 10:03.980
Wants at the beginning and then she goes for it and then she gets it and another kind of dishonest framing

10:03.980 --> 10:10.360
Is that she again gives up everything for a guy the moral of my story's changing

10:11.200 --> 10:16.640
When really the guy was just the inciting incident like look at her look at this nerd

10:16.720 --> 10:18.640
Look at her like man cave

10:18.640 --> 10:23.120
Like if she was a dude in the suburb, that would be just like nothing but Simpsons pinball machines

10:23.240 --> 10:26.880
so really her desire for access to the human world is a desire for

10:27.280 --> 10:31.920
Mobility and for knowledge and she wants all of these things way before she lays eyes on Prince Eric

10:31.920 --> 10:36.080
This is a departure from the original Hans Christian Andersen story in this one

10:36.080 --> 10:42.200
The mermaid dies but gets the opportunity to earn an immortal soul through 300 years of indentured servitude

10:42.480 --> 10:48.520
Some feminists have argued that Anderson's version allows the mermaid to self-actualize outside of an attachment to someone else

10:48.600 --> 10:51.800
Which makes the original more feminist actually

10:52.360 --> 10:54.880
Why does everything have to be a competition cheese?

10:55.680 --> 11:00.240
But that's not what happens in the Anderson story instead of being in service to a mortal guy

11:00.240 --> 11:04.900
She enters the service of the ultimate patriarch for 300 years. No less either way

11:04.900 --> 11:08.740
It's not her choice to do this thing and it certainly isn't an empowering tale of autonomy

11:08.740 --> 11:15.660
It is which patriarchy do I subsume myself to in order to get that immortal soul to a god or to a husband?

11:15.660 --> 11:21.540
And I certainly don't think that Hans Christian Andersen was trying to make an empowering tale for young feminists

11:21.940 --> 11:27.120
So yeah, just let Ariel have the guy lady. Let her have her sparkly 80s dress. It's fine

11:27.120 --> 11:33.840
Part 4 true love

11:42.520 --> 11:46.120
So Disney films of the 2000s and the 2010s

11:46.320 --> 11:53.520
They wanted to demonstrate growth within the brand and much of this was characterized by a metatextual criticism of earlier Disney canon

11:53.680 --> 11:59.160
Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and even the Little Mermaid which at the time was barely 20 years old

12:03.360 --> 12:07.600
I know it's not that fairytale book you wanted, but this is better. We got Enchanted

12:10.840 --> 12:14.200
Don't see it's okay, you know, let's just walk we got Tangled

12:14.200 --> 12:21.800
Did Rapunzel and I ever get married but after years and years of asking and asking and asking I finally said yes

12:21.800 --> 12:27.220
We got it in Frozen. You can't marry a man. You just met you can if it's true love

12:27.240 --> 12:30.240
Wow, did we get it in Frozen? I could kiss you

12:32.240 --> 12:37.560
Could I mean I'd like to I may I Ralph breaks the internet. Do you have daddy issues?

12:40.120 --> 12:44.880
Thanks, I hate it so the function of these motifs in these narratives is to feel like criticism

12:44.880 --> 12:49.240
But really it's just reassuring the audience that the fairy tale formula is fine

12:49.360 --> 12:56.840
Actually, the main difference here between metatextual Disney and earlier Disney is that the couple gets married after like a year or two

12:57.520 --> 12:59.520
instead of like a week or two and

12:59.880 --> 13:01.280
You are

13:01.280 --> 13:03.280
Giselle Oh

13:03.640 --> 13:04.840
Giselle

13:04.840 --> 13:06.960
We shall be married in the morning

13:06.960 --> 13:11.680
So even within these newer films, there's this reassurance that the heteronormative fairy tale formula is fine

13:11.960 --> 13:16.000
Actually, and it does jive with your modern feminist cynicism see

13:16.560 --> 13:18.880
Rapunzel and Eugene waited a while to get married

13:19.840 --> 13:25.480
Feminism you mean to tell me you got engaged to someone you just met that day

13:25.640 --> 13:29.880
Frozen hinging so much of its plot on that is part of why I can't really get on the frozen train

13:30.000 --> 13:32.520
If only there was someone out there who loved you

13:37.480 --> 13:41.560
That and whatever terrifying evil genius engineering made it crack for toddlers

13:41.880 --> 13:47.440
Another thing about Disney repeatedly lampshading that we got married too quickly thing is it doesn't actually

13:48.000 --> 13:55.000
Happen in any Disney movie like pick one. Maybe they fall in love fast quote, you know fall in love

13:55.000 --> 13:58.840
But there there's never any definite time with regard to the marriage thing

13:59.520 --> 14:03.240
Tangled Wow, you waited 18 to 24 months

14:03.640 --> 14:06.440
well, we don't know that didn't happen in Cinderella or

14:07.000 --> 14:13.480
Sleeping Beauty or 101 Dalmatians or even a Little Mermaid like we don't know how much time elapsed

14:14.200 --> 14:15.240
between

14:15.240 --> 14:21.040
True love's kiss and marriage so you're not even subverting anything Disney. Come on. So this meta textual

14:21.040 --> 14:26.040
Oh, we took a minute to make sure our feelings are real BS doesn't actually contradict any of the old movies

14:26.080 --> 14:31.400
Yes, even Cinderella and Snow White the thing about true love is it's a narrative utility thing

14:31.400 --> 14:33.400
It doesn't have to be super super literal

14:33.680 --> 14:38.080
Especially in movies with literal magic in it where love is hinted to be this magic power

14:38.080 --> 14:43.120
I will make you a potion that will turn you into a human for three days

14:43.800 --> 14:50.000
Got that three days in the Little Mermaid it functions as a ticking clock three days feels urgent

14:50.000 --> 14:54.880
Okay, chop chop ticking clock. So that's why I'm super sick of this form of Disney meta textual criticism

14:54.880 --> 14:59.920
It feels like growth but it isn't because it doesn't actually contradict anything because if it did

15:00.440 --> 15:02.440
That would be bad

15:07.880 --> 15:09.880
Part something character arcs

15:09.880 --> 15:14.860
So in screenwriting terms a character arc is often defined by a want versus a need

15:15.360 --> 15:19.680
The character has a want which is usually an external motivation

15:21.680 --> 15:24.720
And a need which is like sort of an internal motivation

15:25.680 --> 15:27.680
I

15:27.920 --> 15:35.120
Know me wants to be a Las Vegas showgirl, but she needs to I like nice tits

15:36.840 --> 15:41.600
Always have how about you? I like having nice tits. Okay, maybe that's a bad example

15:43.480 --> 15:46.140
Must be weird not having anybody on you

15:47.140 --> 15:49.140
Okay

15:49.940 --> 15:53.260
Aladdin wants to you know be rich and get the girl

15:53.260 --> 15:57.500
But what he needs to do is like learn to be honest about who he is there is a simple one

15:57.500 --> 15:59.180
But Disney does this all the time?

15:59.180 --> 16:03.540
So in the Little Mermaid Ariel does have a concrete want ie an external motivation

16:03.540 --> 16:10.100
I want to be where the people are but not really a need. She doesn't really need to learn anything

16:10.100 --> 16:14.900
She doesn't really grow during the narrative. She has a goal. She strives for it the end. She gets it

16:14.900 --> 16:19.540
So I guess the question is does the character need to have growth in order for there to be a satisfying arc?

16:19.780 --> 16:23.420
Usually in early Disney movies. They don't with the exception of movies like Pinocchio

16:23.860 --> 16:29.900
Generally, the arc for princesses is wants to get married and does and if there's any character growth

16:29.900 --> 16:36.300
it's probably some like side character like, you know, like grumpy learns who not hate women anymore or

16:37.100 --> 16:39.100
The good fairies. I don't know

16:40.100 --> 16:42.100
I

16:43.900 --> 16:45.380
Can't maybe that's a bad example

16:45.380 --> 16:52.460
But anyway by the 90s a Campbell style hero's journey character arc was pretty dereguer for every Disney protagonist

16:52.460 --> 16:57.260
But Ariel's conflict is almost entirely external which is kind of unusual for Renaissance Disney

16:57.420 --> 17:02.660
Even in the Joseph Campbell rejecting the call to action phase of the character arc, which is exactly what it sounds like

17:02.660 --> 17:06.600
It is an external beat in the form of Sebastian singing under the sea

17:06.600 --> 17:13.360
Are you listen to me the human world? It's a mess Ariel doesn't have any internal conflict about her journey

17:13.360 --> 17:19.240
It has to come from Sebastian, but here's my point about all this. This isn't a bad choice. It's just a choice

17:19.480 --> 17:27.120
There's a storytelling truism being that the protagonist is more compelling if they have some hesitance before embarking on their adventure and Ariel really doesn't

17:27.120 --> 17:29.120
You know, she was just looking for an excuse to get them legs

17:29.400 --> 17:34.240
But would the narrative really have been stronger for it if she had I don't think so

17:34.280 --> 17:34.640
I mean

17:34.640 --> 17:35.800
I guess there could have been a version where

17:35.800 --> 17:40.840
Ariel's the one who refuses the call to action for some reason and then change her mind when Triton's a jerk

17:40.840 --> 17:46.860
But I'm not sure how that would have added anything, but then there's also the screenwriting question of whose story is it?

17:46.860 --> 17:52.760
It's not always the protagonist a popular example of this is from Mad Max Fury Road. Who is the protagonist?

17:53.280 --> 17:58.680
Unambiguously, it's Max. He's the point-of-view character his growth defines the narrative, but whose story is it?

17:59.080 --> 18:05.440
Well, it's Furiosa's story. She is the one who chooses to liberate their wives. It's her actions that spur the plot

18:05.440 --> 18:07.160
She is the one who's pursuing her lost home

18:07.160 --> 18:09.800
She's the one who realizes that her home is now long gone

18:09.800 --> 18:14.600
And she's the one who ultimately learns that maybe the real green place is the friends we made along the way

18:14.600 --> 18:21.360
So the Little Mermaid as a movie is not Ariel's story. It's King Triton's story. Ariel is the point-of-view character

18:21.360 --> 18:26.360
She is the protagonist but the character whose growth actually drives and defines the story is

18:26.800 --> 18:32.660
Triton's. Then I guess there's just one problem left. And what's that your majesty?

18:33.440 --> 18:40.480
How much I'm going to miss her. And the conflict that drives the plot is this power struggle between

18:40.800 --> 18:44.600
Triton and Ursula. Why King Triton?

18:47.280 --> 18:52.200
King Triton begins a story as an overprotective father who doesn't support his daughter's interests or pursuits

18:52.280 --> 18:55.640
He takes it way too far when he finds out she's been hoarding human stuff

18:56.040 --> 19:00.400
immediately regrets it after he goes overboard and Ariel also very justifiably fucks off.

19:00.720 --> 19:06.520
And Ariel being pretty passive in the third act in large part because the twist in the third act is Triton giving up his power

19:06.680 --> 19:12.140
Well, it kind of works because again, it's not Ariel's struggle. It was the power struggle between Ursula and Triton

19:12.140 --> 19:18.220
That was the main conflict where Ursula figured out how to make this horny hot dummy into a pawn in their proxy war

19:18.560 --> 19:20.040
That said I'm not saying it's perfect

19:20.040 --> 19:25.360
I do kind of feel like act three of the Little Mermaid is the weakest link. The elements at play here during

19:25.920 --> 19:28.840
Ursula's gigantism episode are a little random

19:28.920 --> 19:35.120
None of it's really set up except for the idea that there are ships on the bottom of the ocean. There's no Chekhov's

19:36.000 --> 19:42.680
Ursula getting big. There's no Chekhov's ships bow. Eric isn't established as an accomplished helmsman

19:42.880 --> 19:48.380
You know, it's not bad. It's just not as strong as later Musker and Clement movies like Aladdin or Moana

19:49.140 --> 19:54.420
Aladdin has a really solid ending because Aladdin is set up as kind of being a little manipulative jerk

19:55.340 --> 19:59.920
No, I never actually wished to get out of the cave. You did that on your own

20:01.820 --> 20:03.700
It's one of his chief characteristics

20:03.700 --> 20:10.020
He tricks the genie earlier and then he tricks Jafar at the end and the idea of genies as prisoners is well established

20:10.020 --> 20:12.020
You wanted to be a genie? You got it!

20:16.140 --> 20:20.300
So, yeah, I guess what I'm saying is the lack of an internal conflict is not necessarily bad

20:20.300 --> 20:23.340
Especially when there's a compelling external conflict

20:23.460 --> 20:29.280
But I feel like Ariel's passivity is not really indicative of like feminist fails so much as you know

20:29.280 --> 20:31.280
The third act just kind of being kind of random

20:31.900 --> 20:33.900
We need to wrap this movie up

20:34.180 --> 20:36.180
So long, lovey boy

20:37.260 --> 20:39.800
All right, so now it's time to talk about the gay shit

20:41.060 --> 20:42.300
What the fuck?

20:42.300 --> 20:44.720
number six adaptation and the gays

20:45.420 --> 20:52.100
Another thing you always see with critiques of Disney movies with regard to adaptation is you know something something they change the ending or you

20:52.100 --> 20:56.900
Know that you remove the dark shit or whatever. Oh, it doesn't look good. It's hopeless

20:56.940 --> 20:58.940
Absolutely hopeless

21:01.740 --> 21:02.900
Probably the biggest

21:02.900 --> 21:09.060
Adaptational change in the Little Mermaid aside from the ending is the original stories focus on the mermaid not just wanting the prince

21:09.060 --> 21:13.900
But wanting an immortal soul see mermaids like the Danish themselves don't have souls

21:14.020 --> 21:19.860
They just live a long time. But when they die, they turn into seafoam unlike humans who get heaven everlasting

21:20.420 --> 21:21.740
It's a pretty short story

21:21.740 --> 21:27.260
But honestly getting to the end of it is kind of heart-wrenching the mermaid gives up everything for this guy only for him to

21:27.500 --> 21:31.740
Patronizingly go on about how he's her little foundling if he falls in love with her

21:31.740 --> 21:33.060
She gets a soul, but you know

21:33.060 --> 21:38.300
he doesn't he spends the whole story just kind of being really patronizing to her and treating her like a child and

21:38.540 --> 21:43.740
Like wow, if only I could find a wife like you Wow too bad. You can't talk

21:44.420 --> 21:46.940
Dogs are idiots. Think about it Smithers

21:46.940 --> 21:52.980
If I came into your house and started sniffing at your crotch and slobbering all over your face, what would you say?

21:53.780 --> 21:54.940
If you did it sir

21:54.940 --> 21:56.540
but then he marries someone else and

21:56.540 --> 22:02.220
The mermaid sisters go to the sea witch who gives them this dagger and they tell the mermaid if she kills the prince she gets

22:02.220 --> 22:03.220
To turn back into a mermaid

22:03.220 --> 22:07.820
But of course at the last second she just can't do it and the Sun rises and she turns into seafoam

22:07.820 --> 22:11.900
But a bunch of I don't know other magical angel adjacent beings

22:11.900 --> 22:16.700
well, they show up and basically they tell her she can come with them and be put into purgatory and

22:16.980 --> 22:23.020
A sort of indentured servitude to get an immortal soul work for us for 300 years and you get your immortal soul

22:23.020 --> 22:27.340
So bittersweet ending no prince, but she gets her soul on layaway

22:27.340 --> 22:33.820
I guess in a weird way the original story has more of a want versus need character arc the mermaid wants that prince

22:33.820 --> 22:38.460
But she needs the spiritual awakening. She needs that immortal soul

22:38.540 --> 22:41.020
But anyway, the book is gay AF because like

22:42.020 --> 22:46.780
Come on, the mermaid wants this guy and he's like, oh you're such a good friend man

22:46.780 --> 22:51.660
If only I was into you we could totally get married if only I was you know

22:51.940 --> 22:57.500
Into people like you like even just reading this you're like Hans Christian Andersen wrote this about a guy, right?

22:58.660 --> 23:02.340
Maybe Hans Christian Andersen was possibly asexual

23:02.340 --> 23:09.060
But you know definitely a romantic and he had a lot of love letters many of them unsent to this one guy

23:09.380 --> 23:12.140
Who never ended up returning his affections?

23:12.460 --> 23:18.900
so you can tell this is a story about a longing for a person you can't be with and how that person doesn't really want

23:18.900 --> 23:24.260
You and how that causes you pain every time you were near them. So you want this dude you can't have

23:24.780 --> 23:26.940
But at least there's God

23:27.580 --> 23:33.500
Another thing about the queer theory reading of the Little Mermaid is any version of the Little Mermaid is about passing

23:33.900 --> 23:39.420
Andersen's version can be read a few ways the most obvious being the crush he had on this dude that he could never express because

23:39.420 --> 23:41.420
You know, it was a different time

23:41.580 --> 23:46.140
Two bros chillin in the hot tub five feet apart cuz they're not gay

23:46.140 --> 23:49.900
But it also expresses his discomfort for passing in high society

23:49.980 --> 23:55.700
Which he was not born into and this high society was not kind to the nouveau riche like Hans Christian Andersen

23:55.700 --> 23:59.220
This is another reason why the lazy feminist hyper literal

23:59.620 --> 24:01.620
mutilates her body for a man

24:01.740 --> 24:06.580
Criticism bugs me because it totally dismisses any reading of the text that is anything but strictly

24:06.980 --> 24:11.140
Heteronormative and the current discourse the most obvious metaphor is the transgender one

24:11.140 --> 24:15.260
Hell one of the highest profile trans nonprofits in the UK is called mermaids

24:15.260 --> 24:20.900
But there are lots of ways one can change oneself in order to pass in mainstream society

24:21.100 --> 24:25.620
Ariel knows from basically when she's old enough to know stuff that she doesn't really feel at home in the body

24:25.620 --> 24:28.500
She's in both in the Disney movie and in the original story

24:28.500 --> 24:31.660
And so she goes to incredible lengths to change it

24:31.660 --> 24:36.460
So these cheap like Jezebel feminists of 2009 who are like me me me

24:36.460 --> 24:41.900
She gave up her voice and mutilated her body for a man like no like I mean, that's not what happens

24:41.900 --> 24:47.300
But she's got legs you idiot. She traded her vice to the sea witch and got legs

24:48.300 --> 24:53.060
Ariel's whole thing is breaking away from exactly what her society is asking her to do

24:53.180 --> 24:56.740
So I'm not saying that the heteronormative read is completely illegitimate

24:56.940 --> 25:02.220
But for people to treat it like that's the only read is lazy and basic and I'm just kind of tired of it

25:02.340 --> 25:06.580
So anyway, so the OG short story is gay AF moving on part something

25:06.580 --> 25:09.460
The Disney version is gay if to just you know, not in the same way

25:09.620 --> 25:15.660
They weren't kidding when they called me. Well a witch in the early days of queer theory. This was like, hmm

25:15.820 --> 25:20.340
Why are all the villains queer coded? Oh, I shall practice my curtsy

25:29.940 --> 25:33.620
But now we've more or less come around to the correct opinion which is yes, yes they are

25:33.620 --> 25:37.460
They are extremely queer coded and also they are awesome and we stan

25:37.460 --> 25:42.020
You know, my last captain of the guard was a bit of a disappointment to me

25:42.700 --> 25:45.540
Ursula is more than queer coded

25:45.540 --> 25:51.940
It is well known that her design was heavily inspired by the drag queen divine who was most famous for starring in John Waters films

25:51.940 --> 25:53.940
like hairspray I

25:54.060 --> 25:59.660
Watch that tramp and I'm embarrassed to be white and pink fling goes this blood turn you on

25:59.660 --> 26:04.840
It doesn't more than turn me on. Mr. Vader. It makes me come and female troubles

26:04.840 --> 26:06.840
I hate you

26:09.920 --> 26:18.040
Voice actress Pat Carroll conceived Ursula as like an aging Shakespearean actress which explains so much of the performance

26:18.400 --> 26:20.360
Look at me

26:20.360 --> 26:22.360
Wasted away to practically nothing

26:23.800 --> 26:32.040
My poor little poopsies and don't underestimate the importance of a body language

26:34.840 --> 26:36.840
Thirsty bitch

26:38.240 --> 26:40.400
I'm taking this one. Give me the shoe bitch

26:41.240 --> 26:46.360
And she ends up as sort of a composite of drag and camp icons Joan Collins

26:46.520 --> 26:49.520
No, you know where to find the boys and the booze

26:50.040 --> 26:58.120
Tallulah Bankhead my good woman. Would you kindly leave the premises before I grab your pink hair and put it out by black roots

26:58.560 --> 27:04.680
Three days Norman Desmond. All right, mr. DeMille. I'm ready for my close-up and of course divine

27:04.840 --> 27:06.840
You're a pain too

27:09.800 --> 27:14.360
Like in a lot of ways this goes beyond coding this is clearly deliberate

27:14.680 --> 27:20.200
Especially considering how much poor unfortunate souls resembles a traditional drag show

27:20.680 --> 27:23.960
But you'll find that nowadays I've mended all my ways

27:24.640 --> 27:26.640
She uses her eels as a boa

27:26.760 --> 27:30.120
This is also the first Disney movie to use Alan Menken and Howard Ashman

27:30.440 --> 27:35.960
Who were at the time best known for the Broadway camp hit Little Shop of Horrors quick note on Howard Ashman

27:35.960 --> 27:40.760
It's not a coincidence that the most iconic songs of the Disney Renaissance came out of those first three movies

27:40.760 --> 27:41.960
but then kind of

27:41.960 --> 27:43.960
out after that

27:46.200 --> 27:53.720
And that's not nostalgia that's Howard Ashman who died from complications from AIDS in 1991 and while it's not like making never wrote any

27:53.720 --> 27:58.280
Good music again. I feel like he was at his strongest writing with Ashman

27:58.520 --> 28:03.400
Ashman was deathly ill during the production of Beauty and the Beast and if you really want some heartstrings tug

28:03.560 --> 28:07.720
Listen to the people who worked with him described the way he kept on trucking until the very end

28:08.040 --> 28:14.200
Howard was physically there. He had lost a lot of weight. He was, you know, he was wearing his shirt with suspenders, you know

28:14.280 --> 28:20.200
And trying to be as casual as possible and certainly didn't want to project any sense of of illness

28:20.920 --> 28:22.920
um at that point

28:22.920 --> 28:26.280
Nobody else professionally knew that he was he was sick

28:26.680 --> 28:32.360
Another thing that tends to get lost in analysis of this movie Menken and Ashman had a huge influence not just on the music

28:32.440 --> 28:35.560
But also the story itself. Not only did they help shape the story

28:35.640 --> 28:38.520
They had the songs and score written before animation even began

28:39.160 --> 28:45.960
And in that way also helped shape the characters particularly Ursula who is defined by her big musical number

28:46.360 --> 28:48.360
The boss is on a roll

28:48.360 --> 28:50.200
Oh

28:50.200 --> 28:57.080
That's Menken and Ashman Ursula's drag show basically explaining gender performativity theory by way of Judith Butler

28:57.400 --> 28:59.960
But far more entertaining you'll have your looks

29:00.600 --> 29:02.600
your pretty face

29:02.680 --> 29:04.680
body language

29:05.800 --> 29:11.480
Menken and Ashman so the read of poor unfortunate souls his drag performance was deliberate Menken and Ashman

29:11.560 --> 29:16.360
Especially would have been steeped in New York drag culture. So I don't read this as Disney being appropriative to me

29:16.360 --> 29:18.680
This is Ashman writing what he knows

29:19.160 --> 29:22.360
So in my old age Ursula is far and away my favorite thing in this movie

29:22.440 --> 29:25.880
Possibly because i'm only about three years away from morphing into her completely

29:25.960 --> 29:30.520
But I love Ursula the older I get as a brand Disney villains have always been my favorite

29:30.680 --> 29:34.440
And of course most recent Disney movies don't do villains in the traditional sense anymore

29:34.680 --> 29:39.560
Like they'll do the bait and switch or the misunderstood or sympathetic motivations or whatever this is

29:40.040 --> 29:45.880
But after Shadow Man and Mother Gothel, they kind of petered off on pure fun evil. Come on boys

29:46.360 --> 29:49.880
Won't you shake a poor sinner's hand?

29:51.080 --> 29:55.880
And I don't know what it is about evil without nuance that I find so appealing in the case of Disney villains

29:56.040 --> 29:58.540
But I think it's really just the fact that they're having fun

30:07.400 --> 30:12.680
That everyone in a Disney movie is having fun including the bad guy this is why of classic Disney

30:12.680 --> 30:17.480
I think Maleficent is the most beloved she out of all of them is having a high old time

30:17.880 --> 30:22.440
People don't remember the dalmatians. They remember Cruella. Look at how much fun she's having

30:22.760 --> 30:28.140
This is part of why of the renaissance Disney movies the most beloved ones tend to have the most memorable villains

30:32.520 --> 30:34.520
Why do we even have that level

30:35.720 --> 30:39.800
And that's part of why the black cauldron is widely considered the worst one. I'm, sorry guys

30:39.800 --> 30:43.740
I know you love John Hurt, but he sucks in this. Oh my soldiers

30:45.560 --> 30:50.040
How long I have thirsted to be a god

30:51.320 --> 30:57.560
In fact the black cauldron nearly ended the animation studio until the great mouse detective the best Sherlock Holmes movie of all time

30:57.560 --> 31:01.240
Don't at me quite literally saved the studio. Smile everyone

31:02.360 --> 31:05.900
Disney now owns the world. Thank you the great mouse detective

31:06.840 --> 31:08.840
I have the power

31:09.160 --> 31:13.960
Of course you do I feel like it's not one of those situations like the Hunchback of Notre Dame where

31:14.200 --> 31:18.280
we all kind of reevaluate whether it got a fair shake upon its first release because

31:18.840 --> 31:24.120
I'm losing to a bird. Everybody likes the little mermaid and you know, it's not bad. It's not the best one

31:24.280 --> 31:25.080
It's fine

31:25.080 --> 31:31.080
But you know there was that backlash that was kind of lazy and targeting the popular thing because that was what the click bait was

31:31.240 --> 31:32.760
for a while

31:32.760 --> 31:36.200
But thank god we've moved on and now our click bait is like

31:36.840 --> 31:38.100
I don't know

31:38.100 --> 31:39.940
UFOs

31:39.940 --> 31:41.940
Wow, what a good segue

31:42.740 --> 31:50.500
Hi, i'm alan smithy the director of this film. Are you tired of science fiction books with lyrical poetic prose?

31:50.980 --> 31:57.780
Do you like weird space aliens? Are you a fan of the comical misuse of everyday household?

31:57.860 --> 32:03.780
I I guess I didn't really do that today. That was a missed opportunity. I should have done that but you didn't

32:04.180 --> 32:09.140
Well, you should pre-order my book truth of the divine it is the second book meaning it's the

32:09.620 --> 32:11.940
sequel to the first book which is

32:12.480 --> 32:19.860
Axioms end. Oh boy. See this is what y'all tuned in for. This is um, the requisite self promo portion

32:20.180 --> 32:22.180
I'm gonna do better this time

32:22.260 --> 32:26.500
Because it is a better book. It's got everything the cheesecake factory

32:27.200 --> 32:29.200
president dick cheney

32:29.440 --> 32:31.440
congressional hearings

32:31.520 --> 32:33.520
persians

32:33.580 --> 32:39.200
Sadness and the reason I promote these now is that pre-orders are extremely helpful not just for me

32:39.200 --> 32:44.800
But for any author you want to uh help so if you have a favorite author you want to support and they have a book

32:44.880 --> 32:48.080
That's coming out pre-order their book and then like six months from now

32:48.080 --> 32:51.280
You'll get like a magic package in the mail and then you'll be like, oh

32:51.840 --> 32:53.040
Right

32:53.040 --> 32:58.800
I guess I did order that and the best thing about pre-orders is you do not get charged until the book ships

32:59.280 --> 33:02.720
So if I get canceled again, you can just cancel your order

33:03.440 --> 33:06.240
So another question I get a lot will there be signed copies

33:07.040 --> 33:09.920
Yes, do I know how that's gonna work? No

33:10.560 --> 33:15.680
They haven't told me yet. I'll put that in the next video. But if it's anything like last time

33:15.760 --> 33:22.400
It's uh putting your receipt for the thing you already bought into like a online portal. I don't know. I'll let you know later

33:22.480 --> 33:26.820
It's it's gonna be great. So the pre-order link for truth of the divine is in the description

33:27.440 --> 33:29.440
Unless you are in the uk

33:29.600 --> 33:30.940
in which case

33:30.940 --> 33:37.600
Pre-order the book through your favorite uk-based online retailer because the uk edition has a different publisher

33:38.300 --> 33:44.380
And that has caused some confusion. This this also applies to australia new zealand, but not canada

33:44.700 --> 33:48.960
And for those of you in the rest of the world, um, I don't know use a vpn

33:49.420 --> 33:54.380
I have no control over how to ship to what country or foreign language rights so far

33:54.460 --> 33:57.900
the only country that has bought foreign language rights is

33:58.440 --> 34:00.140
turkey

34:00.140 --> 34:03.500
No, i'm not kidding. I know brazilians. I know

34:04.780 --> 34:11.100
Consider petitioning your publishers. Also, I will come to brazil. I promise we were gonna go in 2020

34:11.100 --> 34:12.140
but there was

34:12.140 --> 34:14.140
You know, there was a thing

34:17.020 --> 34:21.260
Hand to your very very large christ we were gonna come in 2020. We'll come eventually

34:21.420 --> 34:26.620
so anyway pre-order truth of the divine about which the new york times has said nothing because

34:27.020 --> 34:32.860
Uh, they haven't gotten a review copy yet, but in the meantime, thank you for watching and I hope you spend the rest of your

34:32.940 --> 34:34.940
pride month stanning

34:35.560 --> 34:37.560
ursula

34:40.780 --> 34:42.780
Don't be scared. It's only me

34:46.300 --> 34:51.180
And you can all come everyone can come every creature in the sea can come

34:57.580 --> 35:00.080
Hi father, sorry i'm late

35:02.940 --> 35:06.940
Well, i'm not leaving you up there alone this time you mean you'll go with me

35:07.500 --> 35:09.500
It doesn't look like I have a choice

35:09.660 --> 35:12.780
Oh, it'll be so much fun. You'll see come on. Let's go

35:13.500 --> 35:19.420
Hardly, wait. I'm not a fish. I'm a dolphin. That's not very nice to say

35:19.660 --> 35:25.900
I'm your official royal pet. Don't you like me? Did you hear that? Cecil the prince is gonna marry her

35:26.620 --> 35:28.620
Well, I hope so claudia

35:28.620 --> 35:30.620
I hope so

35:30.700 --> 35:36.080
Stop the storm stop the storm away sky creatures

35:39.580 --> 35:42.880
Oh, you mean they're getting married
