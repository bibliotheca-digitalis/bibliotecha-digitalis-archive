1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,820
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:12,360
Coming at you live from over an hour of technical difficulty to at least one round of our Lemon

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,680
Drop Martini.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:26,000
So we shook this up before we started filming, and then the battery died, so we had to drink

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
it.

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,160
So we're already around in.

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:37,760
So these are Lemon Drop Martinis, inspired by Fifty Shades Darker, because today we're

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,800
talking about sequels, while we are trying so desperately to get away from the Fifty

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,800
Shades thing.

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,760
You know, we can only do so much.

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,840
So, about those show names.

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,240
Yeah, names are hard.

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,240
Titling things are hard, and I don't quite know if maybe it wasn't clear last week.

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,800
It just also moved away, because we initially thought it was going to be more along the

15
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,880
lines of a Fifty Shades parody, and it did not turn out to be that, yeah.

16
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,840
So yeah, I think we need to move away.

17
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,160
We're trying to move away from being Fifty Shades of Grey, knockoff number nine billion-y-seventy-something.

18
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,000
So Fifty Shades of Anything is no.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
No shades.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
No, none.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
None.

22
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,760
No more shades.

23
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,760
No more throwing it.

24
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,760
No more having it.

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,760
No fifty-fifty-nothing.

26
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
No more lowering them.

27
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,000
While we had hoped that we would have our new name, and you know, champion hero of the

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,360
people, he praises upon, we did not find Nate that we particularly liked enough to commit

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,440
to, but there were some people that were going in a direction that we liked.

30
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:52,920
My personal favorite of all the suggestions was Pulp Affliction by LJMysticOwl.

31
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,200
That had the catchiness I think we would really like to have, while also having a pun.

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Yeah.

33
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,800
Greg McDaniel also suggested Drink Read Photogon, which we thought was funny, but it was a failure

34
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
on both counts.

35
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,520
A, we don't want to refer to a popular thing.

36
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,880
B, we don't want to refer to Lovecraft, because we do more than these things.

37
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:17,040
Someone suggested something on the vein of Libations, Litbations, which sounds a little

38
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,040
too much like clit master-shit.

39
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:26,360
But yeah, some of these were going in the right direction, but nothing we liked enough

40
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,520
to commit to, so.

41
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,120
We do like puns, but I find in my experience that we're good at spontaneous puns, and terrible

42
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,760
at actually coming up with them when we want them.

43
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,440
And terrible at titles, in all regards.

44
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,120
And the person who ends up giving us our title will be heaped with prize.

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,120
Oh yes.

46
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,840
Of some sort.

47
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,160
That is, it's a surprise prize, whoever gives us our name.

48
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,080
So give us our name, and if we like it, and we pick it, you'll get a prize that is a surprise.

49
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,120
Prize, of course, entirely dependent on how much we like it.

50
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,120
Yeah, like if it's the best thing ever, then we'll give you the dog.

51
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,120
So.

52
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,120
Alright.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,560
So before we start- Motherfucker.

54
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,720
So while the name suggestions came up a little bit short, the book suggestions were fantastic.

55
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,720
So many choices.

56
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,200
So we had a lot of choices.

57
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,800
Of the ones that we had not read, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children was a popular one.

58
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Yeah, that was a popular one.

59
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,160
And one I've been wanting to read for a while, so I was very much gunning for that one.

60
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,320
We also got a lot of the more popular YA's, the Matched series, the Gone series, which

61
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,480
hmm.

62
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,720
We decided based on popularity and frequency of being mentioned to go with Cinder by Marissa

63
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,720
Meyer.

64
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,760
So we have not read it yet, but we will have read it within two weeks.

65
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,800
So let's give a quick rundown from the blurb in the back.

66
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:55,680
This is a library copy, as you can tell by how loved and worn it is, so support your

67
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,760
local library.

68
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,920
Even in the future, the story begins with once upon a time.

69
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,360
Humans and androids, Crow-Creen's library, jing.

70
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,360
A deadly plague ravages the puh- barcode, ner people watch.

71
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:18,360
Waiting to make the 0-2-2-8-5-6-5-9-2-8-7-9-0, it's fate hinges on one girl, the 16 year

72
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,360
old Cinder.

73
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,360
So like we said.

74
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,360
The gifting mechanic is a cyborg.

75
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,360
She's a cyborg.

76
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,840
Support your local library.

77
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:29,040
I kind of avoided this one for a while because it's another goddamn Cinderella retelling,

78
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,840
but I feel like I know enough people that really liked it, and also it's got like cyborgs

79
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,320
and aliens and shit, which I really like.

80
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,880
So who doesn't love cyborgs and aliens?

81
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,520
Yeah, so we'll read this and see if the originality of the premise overcomes the hackneyedness

82
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,560
of another goddamn Cinderella retelling.

83
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,400
We will be reading this in a two weeks time.

84
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,880
And in two weeks, when we do our next episode, because Nella's out of town this weekend,

85
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,160
you are welcome to read it with us, and then you can share your opinions in the comments

86
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,160
of next week's episode.

87
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,960
But this week's episode, like I said, we're celebrating sequels with our, you know, Fifty

88
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,000
Shades of Grey drink, number two, because of technical difficulties.

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,800
Let's talk about book two of the Awoken saga, Arisen.

90
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:24,640
The only one that came close to being good enough to supplant Arisen, to me, was Forsaken.

91
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,320
But I mean, I'm kind of on the fence on that one, I still kind of like the alliteration

92
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,320
idea.

93
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,320
I know.

94
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,120
Although I have to say, like, I really did enjoy the suggestion of Token.

95
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,120
Token!

96
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,800
The third one should be alliteration.

97
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:48,160
So Awoken, Arisen, Alliteration.

98
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,120
If we do end up going with the Eat, Pray, Love, which I'm still, you know, I think we're

99
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,320
probably going to have to read Eat, Pray, Love at some point, which neither of us have,

100
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,240
so it kind of falls into our, we probably should.

101
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,640
As we got a lot of comments about the nature of parody, especially as our first one is

102
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:09,880
focused mainly on paranormal romance and the YA tradition, so we got a lot of people saying

103
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,800
that we should do dystopia, since that is more the thing now, which it absolutely is,

104
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,800
at least in terms of things that are being turned into movies.

105
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,520
In publishing world, dystopia is way dead, but in Hollywood world, it's just getting

106
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,520
started.

107
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,480
I don't know, Nella, how do you feel about involving dystopic elements in our series

108
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,200
that we've already started?

109
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:41,800
There is definitely an element we can play with about the ending of one world and the

110
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,880
horrors of the new.

111
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:49,920
Maybe Cthulhu's home dimension is dystopic.

112
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
Or something.

113
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,920
Or something.

114
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,180
While we did start with the intent of being, you know, just a parody, I'm not terribly

115
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,520
interested in making this the hungover games.

116
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,240
Here's a question, Lindsay.

117
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,040
What is it about YA dystopia that makes you hesitant about parodying it?

118
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,320
Well, let me tell you my feelings on YA dystopia, Nella.

119
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,080
What are some seminal modern dystopias?

120
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:24,480
The two most remembered dystopias of the modern era since, you know, the beginning of the

121
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,240
1900s, 1984 and Brave New World.

122
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,240
Were these those?

123
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,240
Cheers.

124
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,880
Let's have a deep discussion about literary history.

125
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,920
The thing about Brave New World in 1984 is, before anything, like Animal Farm, for instance,

126
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,760
they are social critiques.

127
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,000
1984 is a more obvious anxiety.

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It expresses a fear of totalitarian government being watched.

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:02,200
Brave New World is more about a society being controlled by comforts and drugs and being

130
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,720
basically desensitized, which effectively robs them of their humanity.

131
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,600
And also, yeah, robbing people of their desire to change their circumstances, like with the

132
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,720
conditioning at the beginning of a child's life.

133
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,440
When we compare that to the modern young adult dystopia, the thing about young adult is it

134
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:27,040
tends to be very focused on the individual, which makes sense because young adult is ultimately

135
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
about coming of age.

136
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:34,160
When you look at The Hunger Games, which I like a lot, I really like The Hunger Games,

137
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:41,520
there are absolutely elements of the social anxiety there, particularly in regard to reality

138
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,400
shows and people's lives as entertainment for the masses.

139
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,200
But there's a lot of other things there too.

140
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,720
There's income inequality, and it absolutely has that element of the personal, which I

141
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,560
think is why it's so blockbuster successful.

142
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:04,000
Then you have the billion-y-jillion other fucking YA dystopias, which are effectively

143
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,600
totalitarian government as a metaphor for, don't tell me what to do, mom.

144
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:16,080
I actually just read Earthseed, the series, by Octavia Butler, and reading it, the thing

145
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,560
that really struck me is I am a person who really does love a dystopian.

146
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:28,040
I do like exploring how societies we know it might have collapsed, how we're dealing

147
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,320
with it, how we're being oppressed, how we overcome it.

148
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:37,920
Realizing, and not so much The Hunger Games, but other series and other books, is that

149
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:44,880
Earthseed is complete, it explores the collapse in a way that the others fail to do, and the

150
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:51,840
stakes are real in a way that a lot of YA dystopian just doesn't quite grasp.

151
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,920
Well, the thing about YA dystopia, the thing that's kind of driving me mad about it is

152
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:03,440
not only the fact that there is a figurehead, it's a figurehead that if you conquer it,

153
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,080
then everything's okay.

154
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:11,840
It's not, it has nothing to do with the fabric of society, which Earthseed explores a lot.

155
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,160
But I think the really interesting thing about Earthseed within the context of this discussion,

156
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,600
there is no difference between that and a young adult novel, because the protagonist,

157
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,560
especially in the first book, Parable of the Sower.

158
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,560
Read it.

159
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,560
Read it now.

160
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,560
Today.

161
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,560
Before you read this.

162
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
I promise.

163
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,560
No, seriously.

164
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,560
I don't care how good this is.

165
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,560
Parable of the Sower is better.

166
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:40,360
It features basically a protagonist from, I think she's 15 through 19 throughout the

167
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,360
novel.

168
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:48,480
It's a young adult novel, but it's, Earthseed is a great modern dystopia, but it's not playing

169
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:56,520
to what publishers or writers, as it were, think are the anxieties and concerns of teenagers,

170
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,920
which is totalitarian government is a metaphor for you can't tell me what to do, mom.

171
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,920
I'm an adult.

172
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,480
Also, it's decidedly non-sexy, because there's no, you know, triangle.

173
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,480
Yeah.

174
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,120
Well, there's no triangle, and the only love interest is, like, 50.

175
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,120
Yeah.

176
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,000
It's a little creepy, but hey, you know, end of the world.

177
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What ifs.

178
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What ifs.

179
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,400
Dystopia is an interesting conversation, and by all means, please, converse in the comments,

180
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:24,200
and we may discuss dystopia in another episode, because that is absolutely relevant, not only

181
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,080
to young adult, but to science fiction in general.

182
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,080
I don't know.

183
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,280
I feel like it's been a shift in science fiction.

184
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:35,240
In the past, it's been more about what we've built towards, and now it's about how we have

185
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,520
destroyed ourselves, and what can we do to reclaim what we have lost?

186
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,360
Which totally makes sense, considering the...

187
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,800
The North Atlantic Current.

188
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:54,960
After our lengthy dystopian conversation, if Arisen is not a dystopia, what is it?

189
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:01,920
As we mentioned in last week's episode, we have an idea as to what it is, but we, before

190
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,400
we start actually talking mechanics of plot and setting and characters and all that fun

191
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:13,960
stuff, we want to hear what you have to say without it being a Hunger Games parody.

192
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
Please no.

193
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,960
Close it.

194
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:23,160
So now as we are coming to the close of our second martini and second episode of the new

195
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,800
season, please goddammit give us better names that don't have anything to do with Fifty

196
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,960
Shades of Grey.

197
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
As we...

198
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,960
We like puns.

199
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,240
Puns and things that have to do with drinking and reading.

200
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,360
Proofreading, you might say, except for that's the name of a tumbler.

201
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,480
And it's a wonderful tumbler.

202
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,480
You should follow it.

203
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,160
Yeah, proofreading books, it's cute, but we don't want to plagiarize.

204
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,160
So about that Goodreads.

205
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,360
Oh yeah, it is set up.

206
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,600
We now have a Goodreads account under Shay Apocalypse.

207
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,200
First name Shay, last name Apocalypse.

208
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,480
That's how it made me do it.

209
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,480
So you friend us on Goodreads, we'll friend you back and we'll start building our reading

210
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,480
wall.

211
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,480
Yeah.

212
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,600
Our reading wall will be young adults and adult science fiction and fantasy.

213
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,720
And maybe some e-prelubs and cloud atlases and other things that we find relevant and

214
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,720
interesting.

215
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
I still need to read that.

216
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,720
Yeah, you do, but you won't have time.

217
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:19,280
Please leave your comments on our website, ShayApocalypse.com, tweet at us, at ShayApocalypse,

218
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,800
and talk to us in the normal Twitter places.

219
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,400
And also give us drink recipes, because this one, I had to find, it was too strong.

220
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:34,040
Here's to books and fewer technical difficulties.

221
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,640
And that way we might be a little more coherent.

222
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,160
To feener...
