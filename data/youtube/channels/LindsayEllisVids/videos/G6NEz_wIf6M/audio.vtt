WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.820
Hello, everyone.

00:06.820 --> 00:12.360
Coming at you live from over an hour of technical difficulty to at least one round of our Lemon

00:12.360 --> 00:13.680
Drop Martini.

00:13.680 --> 00:26.000
So we shook this up before we started filming, and then the battery died, so we had to drink

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
it.

00:27.200 --> 00:30.160
So we're already around in.

00:30.160 --> 00:37.760
So these are Lemon Drop Martinis, inspired by Fifty Shades Darker, because today we're

00:37.760 --> 00:43.800
talking about sequels, while we are trying so desperately to get away from the Fifty

00:43.800 --> 00:44.800
Shades thing.

00:44.800 --> 00:47.760
You know, we can only do so much.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.840
So, about those show names.

00:49.840 --> 00:52.240
Yeah, names are hard.

00:52.240 --> 00:58.240
Titling things are hard, and I don't quite know if maybe it wasn't clear last week.

00:58.240 --> 01:01.800
It just also moved away, because we initially thought it was going to be more along the

01:01.800 --> 01:05.880
lines of a Fifty Shades parody, and it did not turn out to be that, yeah.

01:05.880 --> 01:08.840
So yeah, I think we need to move away.

01:08.840 --> 01:16.160
We're trying to move away from being Fifty Shades of Grey, knockoff number nine billion-y-seventy-something.

01:16.160 --> 01:19.000
So Fifty Shades of Anything is no.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
No shades.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
No, none.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
None.

01:22.760 --> 01:23.760
No more shades.

01:23.760 --> 01:24.760
No more throwing it.

01:24.760 --> 01:25.760
No more having it.

01:25.760 --> 01:26.760
No fifty-fifty-nothing.

01:26.760 --> 01:27.760
No more lowering them.

01:27.760 --> 01:32.000
While we had hoped that we would have our new name, and you know, champion hero of the

01:32.000 --> 01:39.360
people, he praises upon, we did not find Nate that we particularly liked enough to commit

01:39.360 --> 01:45.440
to, but there were some people that were going in a direction that we liked.

01:45.440 --> 01:52.920
My personal favorite of all the suggestions was Pulp Affliction by LJMysticOwl.

01:52.920 --> 01:58.200
That had the catchiness I think we would really like to have, while also having a pun.

01:58.200 --> 01:59.200
Yeah.

01:59.200 --> 02:04.800
Greg McDaniel also suggested Drink Read Photogon, which we thought was funny, but it was a failure

02:04.800 --> 02:05.800
on both counts.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.520
A, we don't want to refer to a popular thing.

02:07.520 --> 02:10.880
B, we don't want to refer to Lovecraft, because we do more than these things.

02:10.880 --> 02:17.040
Someone suggested something on the vein of Libations, Litbations, which sounds a little

02:17.040 --> 02:18.040
too much like clit master-shit.

02:18.040 --> 02:26.360
But yeah, some of these were going in the right direction, but nothing we liked enough

02:26.360 --> 02:27.520
to commit to, so.

02:27.520 --> 02:33.120
We do like puns, but I find in my experience that we're good at spontaneous puns, and terrible

02:33.120 --> 02:35.760
at actually coming up with them when we want them.

02:35.760 --> 02:38.440
And terrible at titles, in all regards.

02:38.640 --> 02:45.120
And the person who ends up giving us our title will be heaped with prize.

02:45.120 --> 02:46.120
Oh yes.

02:46.120 --> 02:47.840
Of some sort.

02:47.840 --> 02:51.160
That is, it's a surprise prize, whoever gives us our name.

02:51.160 --> 02:56.080
So give us our name, and if we like it, and we pick it, you'll get a prize that is a surprise.

02:56.080 --> 02:59.120
Prize, of course, entirely dependent on how much we like it.

02:59.120 --> 03:03.120
Yeah, like if it's the best thing ever, then we'll give you the dog.

03:03.120 --> 03:04.120
So.

03:04.120 --> 03:05.120
Alright.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.560
So before we start- Motherfucker.

03:10.560 --> 03:15.720
So while the name suggestions came up a little bit short, the book suggestions were fantastic.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.720
So many choices.

03:17.720 --> 03:20.200
So we had a lot of choices.

03:20.200 --> 03:24.800
Of the ones that we had not read, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children was a popular one.

03:24.800 --> 03:25.800
Yeah, that was a popular one.

03:25.800 --> 03:30.160
And one I've been wanting to read for a while, so I was very much gunning for that one.

03:30.160 --> 03:35.320
We also got a lot of the more popular YA's, the Matched series, the Gone series, which

03:35.320 --> 03:37.480
hmm.

03:37.480 --> 03:42.720
We decided based on popularity and frequency of being mentioned to go with Cinder by Marissa

03:42.720 --> 03:43.720
Meyer.

03:43.720 --> 03:47.760
So we have not read it yet, but we will have read it within two weeks.

03:47.760 --> 03:49.800
So let's give a quick rundown from the blurb in the back.

03:49.800 --> 03:55.680
This is a library copy, as you can tell by how loved and worn it is, so support your

03:55.680 --> 03:56.760
local library.

03:56.760 --> 04:00.920
Even in the future, the story begins with once upon a time.

04:00.920 --> 04:04.360
Humans and androids, Crow-Creen's library, jing.

04:04.360 --> 04:09.360
A deadly plague ravages the puh- barcode, ner people watch.

04:09.360 --> 04:18.360
Waiting to make the 0-2-2-8-5-6-5-9-2-8-7-9-0, it's fate hinges on one girl, the 16 year

04:18.360 --> 04:19.360
old Cinder.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.360
So like we said.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.360
The gifting mechanic is a cyborg.

04:21.360 --> 04:22.360
She's a cyborg.

04:22.360 --> 04:23.840
Support your local library.

04:23.920 --> 04:29.040
I kind of avoided this one for a while because it's another goddamn Cinderella retelling,

04:29.040 --> 04:33.840
but I feel like I know enough people that really liked it, and also it's got like cyborgs

04:33.840 --> 04:35.320
and aliens and shit, which I really like.

04:35.320 --> 04:36.880
So who doesn't love cyborgs and aliens?

04:36.880 --> 04:43.520
Yeah, so we'll read this and see if the originality of the premise overcomes the hackneyedness

04:43.520 --> 04:45.560
of another goddamn Cinderella retelling.

04:45.560 --> 04:48.400
We will be reading this in a two weeks time.

04:48.400 --> 04:51.880
And in two weeks, when we do our next episode, because Nella's out of town this weekend,

04:51.920 --> 04:56.160
you are welcome to read it with us, and then you can share your opinions in the comments

04:56.160 --> 04:57.160
of next week's episode.

04:57.160 --> 05:01.960
But this week's episode, like I said, we're celebrating sequels with our, you know, Fifty

05:01.960 --> 05:07.000
Shades of Grey drink, number two, because of technical difficulties.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.800
Let's talk about book two of the Awoken saga, Arisen.

05:12.800 --> 05:24.640
The only one that came close to being good enough to supplant Arisen, to me, was Forsaken.

05:24.640 --> 05:29.320
But I mean, I'm kind of on the fence on that one, I still kind of like the alliteration

05:29.320 --> 05:30.320
idea.

05:30.320 --> 05:31.320
I know.

05:31.320 --> 05:34.120
Although I have to say, like, I really did enjoy the suggestion of Token.

05:34.120 --> 05:35.120
Token!

05:35.120 --> 05:41.800
The third one should be alliteration.

05:41.800 --> 05:48.160
So Awoken, Arisen, Alliteration.

05:48.160 --> 05:51.120
If we do end up going with the Eat, Pray, Love, which I'm still, you know, I think we're

05:51.120 --> 05:54.320
probably going to have to read Eat, Pray, Love at some point, which neither of us have,

05:54.320 --> 05:58.240
so it kind of falls into our, we probably should.

05:58.240 --> 06:02.640
As we got a lot of comments about the nature of parody, especially as our first one is

06:02.640 --> 06:09.880
focused mainly on paranormal romance and the YA tradition, so we got a lot of people saying

06:09.960 --> 06:15.800
that we should do dystopia, since that is more the thing now, which it absolutely is,

06:15.800 --> 06:18.800
at least in terms of things that are being turned into movies.

06:18.800 --> 06:25.520
In publishing world, dystopia is way dead, but in Hollywood world, it's just getting

06:25.520 --> 06:26.520
started.

06:26.520 --> 06:30.480
I don't know, Nella, how do you feel about involving dystopic elements in our series

06:30.480 --> 06:33.200
that we've already started?

06:34.200 --> 06:41.800
There is definitely an element we can play with about the ending of one world and the

06:41.800 --> 06:43.880
horrors of the new.

06:43.880 --> 06:49.920
Maybe Cthulhu's home dimension is dystopic.

06:49.920 --> 06:50.920
Or something.

06:50.920 --> 06:51.920
Or something.

06:51.920 --> 06:56.180
While we did start with the intent of being, you know, just a parody, I'm not terribly

06:56.180 --> 06:58.520
interested in making this the hungover games.

06:59.240 --> 07:00.240
Here's a question, Lindsay.

07:00.240 --> 07:05.040
What is it about YA dystopia that makes you hesitant about parodying it?

07:05.040 --> 07:08.320
Well, let me tell you my feelings on YA dystopia, Nella.

07:14.960 --> 07:18.080
What are some seminal modern dystopias?

07:18.080 --> 07:24.480
The two most remembered dystopias of the modern era since, you know, the beginning of the

07:24.480 --> 07:28.240
1900s, 1984 and Brave New World.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.240
Were these those?

07:29.240 --> 07:30.240
Cheers.

07:30.240 --> 07:36.880
Let's have a deep discussion about literary history.

07:36.880 --> 07:42.920
The thing about Brave New World in 1984 is, before anything, like Animal Farm, for instance,

07:42.920 --> 07:44.760
they are social critiques.

07:44.760 --> 07:48.000
1984 is a more obvious anxiety.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
It expresses a fear of totalitarian government being watched.

07:53.000 --> 08:02.200
Brave New World is more about a society being controlled by comforts and drugs and being

08:02.200 --> 08:06.720
basically desensitized, which effectively robs them of their humanity.

08:06.720 --> 08:13.600
And also, yeah, robbing people of their desire to change their circumstances, like with the

08:13.600 --> 08:16.720
conditioning at the beginning of a child's life.

08:16.720 --> 08:21.440
When we compare that to the modern young adult dystopia, the thing about young adult is it

08:21.480 --> 08:27.040
tends to be very focused on the individual, which makes sense because young adult is ultimately

08:27.040 --> 08:28.040
about coming of age.

08:28.040 --> 08:34.160
When you look at The Hunger Games, which I like a lot, I really like The Hunger Games,

08:34.160 --> 08:41.520
there are absolutely elements of the social anxiety there, particularly in regard to reality

08:41.520 --> 08:46.400
shows and people's lives as entertainment for the masses.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.200
But there's a lot of other things there too.

08:48.200 --> 08:52.720
There's income inequality, and it absolutely has that element of the personal, which I

08:52.720 --> 08:57.560
think is why it's so blockbuster successful.

08:57.560 --> 09:04.000
Then you have the billion-y-jillion other fucking YA dystopias, which are effectively

09:04.000 --> 09:08.600
totalitarian government as a metaphor for, don't tell me what to do, mom.

09:08.600 --> 09:16.080
I actually just read Earthseed, the series, by Octavia Butler, and reading it, the thing

09:16.080 --> 09:21.560
that really struck me is I am a person who really does love a dystopian.

09:21.560 --> 09:28.040
I do like exploring how societies we know it might have collapsed, how we're dealing

09:28.040 --> 09:31.320
with it, how we're being oppressed, how we overcome it.

09:31.320 --> 09:37.920
Realizing, and not so much The Hunger Games, but other series and other books, is that

09:37.920 --> 09:44.880
Earthseed is complete, it explores the collapse in a way that the others fail to do, and the

09:44.880 --> 09:51.840
stakes are real in a way that a lot of YA dystopian just doesn't quite grasp.

09:51.840 --> 09:56.920
Well, the thing about YA dystopia, the thing that's kind of driving me mad about it is

09:56.920 --> 10:03.440
not only the fact that there is a figurehead, it's a figurehead that if you conquer it,

10:03.440 --> 10:05.080
then everything's okay.

10:05.080 --> 10:11.840
It's not, it has nothing to do with the fabric of society, which Earthseed explores a lot.

10:11.880 --> 10:16.160
But I think the really interesting thing about Earthseed within the context of this discussion,

10:16.160 --> 10:21.600
there is no difference between that and a young adult novel, because the protagonist,

10:21.600 --> 10:25.560
especially in the first book, Parable of the Sower.

10:25.560 --> 10:26.560
Read it.

10:26.560 --> 10:27.560
Read it now.

10:27.560 --> 10:28.560
Today.

10:28.560 --> 10:29.560
Before you read this.

10:29.560 --> 10:30.560
I promise.

10:30.560 --> 10:31.560
No, seriously.

10:31.560 --> 10:32.560
I don't care how good this is.

10:32.560 --> 10:33.560
Parable of the Sower is better.

10:33.560 --> 10:40.360
It features basically a protagonist from, I think she's 15 through 19 throughout the

10:40.360 --> 10:41.360
novel.

10:41.880 --> 10:48.480
It's a young adult novel, but it's, Earthseed is a great modern dystopia, but it's not playing

10:48.480 --> 10:56.520
to what publishers or writers, as it were, think are the anxieties and concerns of teenagers,

10:56.520 --> 11:00.920
which is totalitarian government is a metaphor for you can't tell me what to do, mom.

11:00.920 --> 11:01.920
I'm an adult.

11:01.920 --> 11:05.480
Also, it's decidedly non-sexy, because there's no, you know, triangle.

11:05.480 --> 11:06.480
Yeah.

11:06.480 --> 11:09.120
Well, there's no triangle, and the only love interest is, like, 50.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.120
Yeah.

11:10.640 --> 11:14.000
It's a little creepy, but hey, you know, end of the world.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
What ifs.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
What ifs.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.400
Dystopia is an interesting conversation, and by all means, please, converse in the comments,

11:19.400 --> 11:24.200
and we may discuss dystopia in another episode, because that is absolutely relevant, not only

11:24.200 --> 11:26.080
to young adult, but to science fiction in general.

11:26.080 --> 11:27.080
I don't know.

11:27.080 --> 11:29.280
I feel like it's been a shift in science fiction.

11:29.280 --> 11:35.240
In the past, it's been more about what we've built towards, and now it's about how we have

11:35.240 --> 11:39.520
destroyed ourselves, and what can we do to reclaim what we have lost?

11:39.520 --> 11:43.360
Which totally makes sense, considering the...

11:43.360 --> 11:47.800
The North Atlantic Current.

11:47.800 --> 11:54.960
After our lengthy dystopian conversation, if Arisen is not a dystopia, what is it?

11:54.960 --> 12:01.920
As we mentioned in last week's episode, we have an idea as to what it is, but we, before

12:01.920 --> 12:07.400
we start actually talking mechanics of plot and setting and characters and all that fun

12:07.400 --> 12:13.960
stuff, we want to hear what you have to say without it being a Hunger Games parody.

12:13.960 --> 12:14.960
Please no.

12:14.960 --> 12:15.960
Close it.

12:15.960 --> 12:23.160
So now as we are coming to the close of our second martini and second episode of the new

12:23.160 --> 12:27.800
season, please goddammit give us better names that don't have anything to do with Fifty

12:27.800 --> 12:28.960
Shades of Grey.

12:28.960 --> 12:29.960
As we...

12:29.960 --> 12:30.960
We like puns.

12:30.960 --> 12:34.240
Puns and things that have to do with drinking and reading.

12:34.240 --> 12:37.360
Proofreading, you might say, except for that's the name of a tumbler.

12:37.360 --> 12:38.480
And it's a wonderful tumbler.

12:38.480 --> 12:39.480
You should follow it.

12:39.480 --> 12:43.160
Yeah, proofreading books, it's cute, but we don't want to plagiarize.

12:43.160 --> 12:44.160
So about that Goodreads.

12:44.160 --> 12:46.360
Oh yeah, it is set up.

12:46.360 --> 12:49.600
We now have a Goodreads account under Shay Apocalypse.

12:49.600 --> 12:52.200
First name Shay, last name Apocalypse.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.480
That's how it made me do it.

12:53.480 --> 12:58.480
So you friend us on Goodreads, we'll friend you back and we'll start building our reading

12:58.480 --> 12:59.480
wall.

12:59.480 --> 13:00.480
Yeah.

13:00.480 --> 13:06.600
Our reading wall will be young adults and adult science fiction and fantasy.

13:06.600 --> 13:10.720
And maybe some e-prelubs and cloud atlases and other things that we find relevant and

13:10.720 --> 13:11.720
interesting.

13:11.720 --> 13:12.720
I still need to read that.

13:12.720 --> 13:13.720
