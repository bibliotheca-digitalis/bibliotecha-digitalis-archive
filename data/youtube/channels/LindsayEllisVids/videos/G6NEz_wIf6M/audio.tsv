0	6820	Hello, everyone.
6820	12360	Coming at you live from over an hour of technical difficulty to at least one round of our Lemon
12360	13680	Drop Martini.
13680	26000	So we shook this up before we started filming, and then the battery died, so we had to drink
26000	27000	it.
27200	30160	So we're already around in.
30160	37760	So these are Lemon Drop Martinis, inspired by Fifty Shades Darker, because today we're
37760	43800	talking about sequels, while we are trying so desperately to get away from the Fifty
43800	44800	Shades thing.
44800	47760	You know, we can only do so much.
47760	49840	So, about those show names.
49840	52240	Yeah, names are hard.
52240	58240	Titling things are hard, and I don't quite know if maybe it wasn't clear last week.
58240	61800	It just also moved away, because we initially thought it was going to be more along the
61800	65880	lines of a Fifty Shades parody, and it did not turn out to be that, yeah.
65880	68840	So yeah, I think we need to move away.
68840	76160	We're trying to move away from being Fifty Shades of Grey, knockoff number nine billion-y-seventy-something.
76160	79000	So Fifty Shades of Anything is no.
79000	80000	No shades.
80000	81000	No, none.
81000	82000	None.
82760	83760	No more shades.
83760	84760	No more throwing it.
84760	85760	No more having it.
85760	86760	No fifty-fifty-nothing.
86760	87760	No more lowering them.
87760	92000	While we had hoped that we would have our new name, and you know, champion hero of the
92000	99360	people, he praises upon, we did not find Nate that we particularly liked enough to commit
99360	105440	to, but there were some people that were going in a direction that we liked.
105440	112920	My personal favorite of all the suggestions was Pulp Affliction by LJMysticOwl.
112920	118200	That had the catchiness I think we would really like to have, while also having a pun.
118200	119200	Yeah.
119200	124800	Greg McDaniel also suggested Drink Read Photogon, which we thought was funny, but it was a failure
124800	125800	on both counts.
125800	127520	A, we don't want to refer to a popular thing.
127520	130880	B, we don't want to refer to Lovecraft, because we do more than these things.
130880	137040	Someone suggested something on the vein of Libations, Litbations, which sounds a little
137040	138040	too much like clit master-shit.
138040	146360	But yeah, some of these were going in the right direction, but nothing we liked enough
146360	147520	to commit to, so.
147520	153120	We do like puns, but I find in my experience that we're good at spontaneous puns, and terrible
153120	155760	at actually coming up with them when we want them.
155760	158440	And terrible at titles, in all regards.
158640	165120	And the person who ends up giving us our title will be heaped with prize.
165120	166120	Oh yes.
166120	167840	Of some sort.
167840	171160	That is, it's a surprise prize, whoever gives us our name.
171160	176080	So give us our name, and if we like it, and we pick it, you'll get a prize that is a surprise.
176080	179120	Prize, of course, entirely dependent on how much we like it.
179120	183120	Yeah, like if it's the best thing ever, then we'll give you the dog.
183120	184120	So.
184120	185120	Alright.
186000	190560	So before we start- Motherfucker.
190560	195720	So while the name suggestions came up a little bit short, the book suggestions were fantastic.
195720	197720	So many choices.
197720	200200	So we had a lot of choices.
200200	204800	Of the ones that we had not read, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children was a popular one.
204800	205800	Yeah, that was a popular one.
205800	210160	And one I've been wanting to read for a while, so I was very much gunning for that one.
210160	215320	We also got a lot of the more popular YA's, the Matched series, the Gone series, which
215320	217480	hmm.
217480	222720	We decided based on popularity and frequency of being mentioned to go with Cinder by Marissa
222720	223720	Meyer.
223720	227760	So we have not read it yet, but we will have read it within two weeks.
227760	229800	So let's give a quick rundown from the blurb in the back.
229800	235680	This is a library copy, as you can tell by how loved and worn it is, so support your
235680	236760	local library.
236760	240920	Even in the future, the story begins with once upon a time.
240920	244360	Humans and androids, Crow-Creen's library, jing.
244360	249360	A deadly plague ravages the puh- barcode, ner people watch.
249360	258360	Waiting to make the 0-2-2-8-5-6-5-9-2-8-7-9-0, it's fate hinges on one girl, the 16 year
258360	259360	old Cinder.
259360	260360	So like we said.
260360	261360	The gifting mechanic is a cyborg.
261360	262360	She's a cyborg.
262360	263840	Support your local library.
263920	269040	I kind of avoided this one for a while because it's another goddamn Cinderella retelling,
269040	273840	but I feel like I know enough people that really liked it, and also it's got like cyborgs
273840	275320	and aliens and shit, which I really like.
275320	276880	So who doesn't love cyborgs and aliens?
276880	283520	Yeah, so we'll read this and see if the originality of the premise overcomes the hackneyedness
283520	285560	of another goddamn Cinderella retelling.
285560	288400	We will be reading this in a two weeks time.
288400	291880	And in two weeks, when we do our next episode, because Nella's out of town this weekend,
291920	296160	you are welcome to read it with us, and then you can share your opinions in the comments
296160	297160	of next week's episode.
297160	301960	But this week's episode, like I said, we're celebrating sequels with our, you know, Fifty
301960	307000	Shades of Grey drink, number two, because of technical difficulties.
307000	312800	Let's talk about book two of the Awoken saga, Arisen.
312800	324640	The only one that came close to being good enough to supplant Arisen, to me, was Forsaken.
324640	329320	But I mean, I'm kind of on the fence on that one, I still kind of like the alliteration
329320	330320	idea.
330320	331320	I know.
331320	334120	Although I have to say, like, I really did enjoy the suggestion of Token.
334120	335120	Token!
335120	341800	The third one should be alliteration.
341800	348160	So Awoken, Arisen, Alliteration.
348160	351120	If we do end up going with the Eat, Pray, Love, which I'm still, you know, I think we're
351120	354320	probably going to have to read Eat, Pray, Love at some point, which neither of us have,
354320	358240	so it kind of falls into our, we probably should.
358240	362640	As we got a lot of comments about the nature of parody, especially as our first one is
362640	369880	focused mainly on paranormal romance and the YA tradition, so we got a lot of people saying
369960	375800	that we should do dystopia, since that is more the thing now, which it absolutely is,
375800	378800	at least in terms of things that are being turned into movies.
378800	385520	In publishing world, dystopia is way dead, but in Hollywood world, it's just getting
385520	386520	started.
386520	390480	I don't know, Nella, how do you feel about involving dystopic elements in our series
390480	393200	that we've already started?
394200	401800	There is definitely an element we can play with about the ending of one world and the
401800	403880	horrors of the new.
403880	409920	Maybe Cthulhu's home dimension is dystopic.
409920	410920	Or something.
410920	411920	Or something.
411920	416180	While we did start with the intent of being, you know, just a parody, I'm not terribly
416180	418520	interested in making this the hungover games.
419240	420240	Here's a question, Lindsay.
420240	425040	What is it about YA dystopia that makes you hesitant about parodying it?
425040	428320	Well, let me tell you my feelings on YA dystopia, Nella.
434960	438080	What are some seminal modern dystopias?
438080	444480	The two most remembered dystopias of the modern era since, you know, the beginning of the
444480	448240	1900s, 1984 and Brave New World.
448240	449240	Were these those?
449240	450240	Cheers.
450240	456880	Let's have a deep discussion about literary history.
456880	462920	The thing about Brave New World in 1984 is, before anything, like Animal Farm, for instance,
462920	464760	they are social critiques.
464760	468000	1984 is a more obvious anxiety.
468000	473000	It expresses a fear of totalitarian government being watched.
473000	482200	Brave New World is more about a society being controlled by comforts and drugs and being
482200	486720	basically desensitized, which effectively robs them of their humanity.
486720	493600	And also, yeah, robbing people of their desire to change their circumstances, like with the
493600	496720	conditioning at the beginning of a child's life.
496720	501440	When we compare that to the modern young adult dystopia, the thing about young adult is it
501480	507040	tends to be very focused on the individual, which makes sense because young adult is ultimately
507040	508040	about coming of age.
508040	514160	When you look at The Hunger Games, which I like a lot, I really like The Hunger Games,
514160	521520	there are absolutely elements of the social anxiety there, particularly in regard to reality
521520	526400	shows and people's lives as entertainment for the masses.
526400	528200	But there's a lot of other things there too.
528200	532720	There's income inequality, and it absolutely has that element of the personal, which I
532720	537560	think is why it's so blockbuster successful.
537560	544000	Then you have the billion-y-jillion other fucking YA dystopias, which are effectively
544000	548600	totalitarian government as a metaphor for, don't tell me what to do, mom.
548600	556080	I actually just read Earthseed, the series, by Octavia Butler, and reading it, the thing
556080	561560	that really struck me is I am a person who really does love a dystopian.
561560	568040	I do like exploring how societies we know it might have collapsed, how we're dealing
568040	571320	with it, how we're being oppressed, how we overcome it.
571320	577920	Realizing, and not so much The Hunger Games, but other series and other books, is that
577920	584880	Earthseed is complete, it explores the collapse in a way that the others fail to do, and the
584880	591840	stakes are real in a way that a lot of YA dystopian just doesn't quite grasp.
591840	596920	Well, the thing about YA dystopia, the thing that's kind of driving me mad about it is
596920	603440	not only the fact that there is a figurehead, it's a figurehead that if you conquer it,
603440	605080	then everything's okay.
605080	611840	It's not, it has nothing to do with the fabric of society, which Earthseed explores a lot.
611880	616160	But I think the really interesting thing about Earthseed within the context of this discussion,
616160	621600	there is no difference between that and a young adult novel, because the protagonist,
621600	625560	especially in the first book, Parable of the Sower.
625560	626560	Read it.
626560	627560	Read it now.
627560	628560	Today.
628560	629560	Before you read this.
629560	630560	I promise.
630560	631560	No, seriously.
631560	632560	I don't care how good this is.
632560	633560	Parable of the Sower is better.
633560	640360	It features basically a protagonist from, I think she's 15 through 19 throughout the
640360	641360	novel.
641880	648480	It's a young adult novel, but it's, Earthseed is a great modern dystopia, but it's not playing
648480	656520	to what publishers or writers, as it were, think are the anxieties and concerns of teenagers,
656520	660920	which is totalitarian government is a metaphor for you can't tell me what to do, mom.
660920	661920	I'm an adult.
661920	665480	Also, it's decidedly non-sexy, because there's no, you know, triangle.
665480	666480	Yeah.
666480	669120	Well, there's no triangle, and the only love interest is, like, 50.
669120	670120	Yeah.
670640	674000	It's a little creepy, but hey, you know, end of the world.
674000	675000	What ifs.
675000	676000	What ifs.
676000	679400	Dystopia is an interesting conversation, and by all means, please, converse in the comments,
679400	684200	and we may discuss dystopia in another episode, because that is absolutely relevant, not only
684200	686080	to young adult, but to science fiction in general.
686080	687080	I don't know.
687080	689280	I feel like it's been a shift in science fiction.
689280	695240	In the past, it's been more about what we've built towards, and now it's about how we have
695240	699520	destroyed ourselves, and what can we do to reclaim what we have lost?
699520	703360	Which totally makes sense, considering the...
703360	707800	The North Atlantic Current.
707800	714960	After our lengthy dystopian conversation, if Arisen is not a dystopia, what is it?
714960	721920	As we mentioned in last week's episode, we have an idea as to what it is, but we, before
721920	727400	we start actually talking mechanics of plot and setting and characters and all that fun
727400	733960	stuff, we want to hear what you have to say without it being a Hunger Games parody.
733960	734960	Please no.
734960	735960	Close it.
735960	743160	So now as we are coming to the close of our second martini and second episode of the new
743160	747800	season, please goddammit give us better names that don't have anything to do with Fifty
747800	748960	Shades of Grey.
748960	749960	As we...
749960	750960	We like puns.
750960	754240	Puns and things that have to do with drinking and reading.
754240	757360	Proofreading, you might say, except for that's the name of a tumbler.
757360	758480	And it's a wonderful tumbler.
758480	759480	You should follow it.
759480	763160	Yeah, proofreading books, it's cute, but we don't want to plagiarize.
763160	764160	So about that Goodreads.
764160	766360	Oh yeah, it is set up.
766360	769600	We now have a Goodreads account under Shay Apocalypse.
769600	772200	First name Shay, last name Apocalypse.
772200	773480	That's how it made me do it.
773480	778480	So you friend us on Goodreads, we'll friend you back and we'll start building our reading
778480	779480	wall.
779480	780480	Yeah.
780480	786600	Our reading wall will be young adults and adult science fiction and fantasy.
786600	790720	And maybe some e-prelubs and cloud atlases and other things that we find relevant and
790720	791720	interesting.
791720	792720	I still need to read that.
792720	793720	Yeah, you do, but you won't have time.
793720	799280	Please leave your comments on our website, ShayApocalypse.com, tweet at us, at ShayApocalypse,
799280	802800	and talk to us in the normal Twitter places.
802800	808400	And also give us drink recipes, because this one, I had to find, it was too strong.
808400	814040	Here's to books and fewer technical difficulties.
814040	819640	And that way we might be a little more coherent.
819640	820160	To feener...
