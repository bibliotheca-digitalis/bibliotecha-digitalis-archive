WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.520
So, after the likes of World Trade Center, United 93, and a slew of made-for-TV movies that are kind of funny to look at now...

00:11.720 --> 00:13.800
I'm gonna need you at my side at all times.

00:15.920 --> 00:17.920
Consuliary.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.680
There were those that decided, hey, maybe it's time to lighten up.

00:22.800 --> 00:27.720
I wanted to say I'm sorry. I was in my mid-20s and I was going through a lot of stuff.

00:27.720 --> 00:30.300
I think I never really processed 9-11.

00:31.120 --> 00:32.800
Lindsay and I have

00:32.800 --> 00:34.800
hit a bit of a rough patch.

00:35.360 --> 00:36.960
Really? When did that start?

00:36.960 --> 00:42.120
Well, I don't want to blame it all on 9-11, but it certainly didn't help.

00:42.120 --> 00:47.080
Team America World Police, high again Matt, Stone, and Trey Parker, is basically one extended 9-11 joke.

00:47.440 --> 00:51.560
From what intelligence has gathered, it would be 9-11 times a hundred.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.560
9-11 times a hundred?

00:55.560 --> 00:56.880
Jesus, that's...

00:56.880 --> 01:00.320
Yes, ninety-one thousand one hundred.

01:00.320 --> 01:06.440
Once again, like in South Park, they're more preoccupied with America's world police-y-ness than the event in its fallout.

01:06.880 --> 01:11.200
Don't worry. Everything is bold. We stopped the terrorists.

01:13.600 --> 01:16.560
9-11 is a favorite joke topic for Seth MacFarlane.

01:16.560 --> 01:19.560
Mrs. Griffin, what are your plans for cleaning up our environment?

01:20.160 --> 01:22.160
9-11.

01:22.680 --> 01:26.360
This may, in part, have to do with the fact that, according to MacFarlane,

01:26.360 --> 01:31.160
he nearly became a victim of the attack since he was originally scheduled to board one of the planes,

01:31.480 --> 01:34.960
but then he had a hangover and he overslept.

01:34.960 --> 01:36.360
Your favorite holiday?

01:36.360 --> 01:36.960
Christmas.

01:36.960 --> 01:37.560
9-11.

01:37.560 --> 01:41.960
So MacFarlane, more than most people, has a bit of a fixation on 9-11.

01:41.960 --> 01:43.560
Ground zero.

01:43.660 --> 01:46.360
So this is where the first guy got AIDS.

01:46.360 --> 01:49.360
This is nowhere more evident than in the 2011 episode,

01:49.560 --> 01:52.560
Back to the Pilot, in which Stewie and Brian go back in time,

01:52.560 --> 01:57.560
and MacFarlane self-insert in dog form Brian informs his past self about 9-11,

01:57.560 --> 01:59.560
thereby preventing it.

01:59.560 --> 02:01.560
Time to terrorize the terrorists.

02:01.560 --> 02:06.560
But preventing 9-11 causes a Terminator-style dystopia, because of course it does,

02:06.560 --> 02:11.560
so they have to go back and, in effect, make sure 9-11 happens.

02:11.560 --> 02:18.560
I have a really hard time believing that a present with no 9-11 could possibly be worse than the one we're currently in,

02:18.760 --> 02:19.760
but...

02:20.760 --> 02:21.760
Okay.

02:21.760 --> 02:26.760
We see it referenced again in Ted, in the scene where the titular character is racist at Norah Jones.

02:26.760 --> 02:31.760
Oh, you know, I'm not a hot half-Muslim chick who sold 37 million records, but I'm hanging in there.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.760
Oh, half-Indian, but thanks.

02:33.760 --> 02:34.760
Yeah, whatever, thanks for 9-11.

02:34.760 --> 02:38.760
And here to make everyone else on this list look good, Uwe Boll.

02:38.760 --> 02:40.760
We are at the doorstep of our martyrdom.

02:40.760 --> 02:41.760
Praise Allah.

02:41.760 --> 02:42.760
Praise him.

02:42.960 --> 02:43.960
Nobody likes Uwe Boll.

02:43.960 --> 02:48.960
Even people who decry political correctness ruining everything don't like Uwe Boll,

02:48.960 --> 02:50.960
because he sucks, and he isn't funny.

02:50.960 --> 02:56.960
Postal opens with the 9-11 attacks and a comedy scene between the two hijackers.

02:56.960 --> 03:00.960
It has some of the worst-sounding ADR I've ever heard in any movie,

03:00.960 --> 03:04.960
and it's so distractically terrible I couldn't even pay attention to what they were talking about.

03:04.960 --> 03:07.960
Then you'll have five more virgins than you have right now.

03:07.960 --> 03:08.960
Right.

03:08.960 --> 03:09.960
We're talking about eternity here.

03:10.160 --> 03:13.160
Something about the number of virgins, they were promised being a deal-breaker,

03:13.160 --> 03:15.160
and then they call off the attacks,

03:15.160 --> 03:19.160
but then the well-meaning passengers try to take control of the plane,

03:19.160 --> 03:21.160
and oops, they plow into the towers.

03:23.160 --> 03:26.160
In Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay,

03:26.160 --> 03:30.160
Harold and Kumar, well, go to Guantanamo Bay and then escape,

03:30.160 --> 03:35.160
because Kumar looks a touch terrorist-y for this lady's taste.

03:40.160 --> 03:42.160
Ahh!

03:44.160 --> 03:45.160
And also this.

03:45.160 --> 03:47.160
This is just a bomb.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.160
You say you got a bomb!

03:48.160 --> 03:49.160
See, here's the thing.

03:49.160 --> 03:54.160
I feel like taking drugs on a plane is still gonna get you in pretty big trouble.

03:54.160 --> 03:58.160
Like, not Guantanamo Bay trouble, but never mind.

03:58.160 --> 04:01.160
They spend about five minutes in Gitmo before going on a road trip

04:01.160 --> 04:03.160
and eventually getting high with George W. Bush.

04:03.160 --> 04:06.160
And the problem with this one, unlike the first Harold and Kumar,

04:06.360 --> 04:08.360
is it's not very clever.

04:08.360 --> 04:11.360
Like, it doesn't really say much about the post-9-11 atmosphere

04:11.360 --> 04:13.360
other than poking fun at the paranoia.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.360
And the scenes in Guantanamo are like...

04:22.360 --> 04:24.360
You know what's funny?

04:24.360 --> 04:25.360
Prison rape.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.360
It's hilarious.

04:42.360 --> 04:45.360
I hope this scene never ends.

04:45.360 --> 04:49.360
But we would see the white lady mistakes brown guy for terrorist template

04:49.360 --> 04:51.360
time and again.

05:00.360 --> 05:04.360
The Sacha Baron Cohen not very good comedy The Dictator borrows from it.

05:06.160 --> 05:07.360
My 9-11...

05:12.360 --> 05:15.360
And it's also one of the only good jokes in the movie.

05:15.360 --> 05:18.360
We see it again in the Bollywood comedy Terry Bin Laden

05:18.360 --> 05:20.360
which steals it pretty much beat for beat.

05:26.360 --> 05:31.360
Side note, this movie also features one of the more hilarious American accents in all of moviedom.

05:31.360 --> 05:35.360
Gentlemen, I present to you Operation Kick-Ass.

05:35.560 --> 05:38.560
So that's what other countries must feel like when we do it to them.

05:38.560 --> 05:44.560
A 2008 episode of the Sarah Silverman program has Sarah do like a 9-11 tribute

05:44.560 --> 05:48.560
after repeatedly mistaking bearded men for Osama Bin Laden and

05:48.560 --> 05:50.560
running them over with her car.

05:50.560 --> 05:52.560
Osama Bin Laden!

05:54.560 --> 05:58.560
I'm not sure what this one adds to the conversation...

05:59.560 --> 06:01.560
I'm an airplane!

06:01.560 --> 06:04.560
I'm just flying around, living my day!

06:04.760 --> 06:09.760
But meanwhile, in other parts of the world, there are actually a surprising number of Bollywood movies

06:09.760 --> 06:10.760
on the subject.

06:10.760 --> 06:14.760
One of the early ones is called Madhoshi and came out in 2004.

06:14.760 --> 06:18.760
And it begins with a family who's got one sister at a wedding

06:18.760 --> 06:22.760
and another sister who works in New York and she calls home

06:22.760 --> 06:25.760
and they're talking and...

06:25.760 --> 06:26.760
Umm...

06:26.760 --> 06:27.760
Oh no.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.760
We are fine, papa.

06:29.960 --> 06:30.960
Oh no.

06:30.960 --> 06:31.960
Oh no.

06:31.960 --> 06:32.960
This...

06:32.960 --> 06:34.960
This isn't going where I...

06:45.960 --> 06:47.960
What the fuck, India?!

06:47.960 --> 06:51.960
Oh, and then the reaction from the film is like...

06:59.760 --> 07:02.760
Okay, okay.

07:02.760 --> 07:03.760
Sorry.

07:03.760 --> 07:04.760
Oof.

07:04.760 --> 07:05.760
That CG...

07:05.760 --> 07:06.760
I mean, does it...

07:06.760 --> 07:07.760
It looks like postal.

07:07.760 --> 07:08.760
Come on.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.760
Maybe that's where Uwe Boll got the idea.

07:10.760 --> 07:14.760
But anyway, most of the movies using 9-11 or 9-11-ish plot points

07:14.760 --> 07:17.760
in India don't come out until after 2008.

07:17.760 --> 07:21.760
There was a dark-by-Bollywood-standards thriller simply titled

07:21.760 --> 07:25.760
New York about a group of college friends at the fictional

07:25.760 --> 07:28.760
New York State University, which appears to be in New Jersey.

07:28.760 --> 07:31.760
Well, they're good friends until, one day, 9-11.

07:31.760 --> 07:33.760
It was chaos.

07:33.760 --> 07:37.760
Well, years later, Omar is tasked by the FBI to spy on his old buddy Samir,

07:37.760 --> 07:39.760
who is a suspected terrorist.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.760
Omar's like, no, not my old buddy Samir.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.760
He can't be a terrorist.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.760
And then, yeah, actually, he can.

07:45.760 --> 07:48.760
And while this film is flawed,

07:48.760 --> 07:52.760
the different perspective is interesting and honestly kind of necessary.

07:52.760 --> 07:55.760
For one thing, it actually calls out the Patriot Act.

07:59.760 --> 08:03.760
Interesting that a movie made by and for Indians remembered that

08:03.760 --> 08:05.760
the Patriot Act existed.

08:05.760 --> 08:08.760
Sam gets arrested right after 9-11 over a goofy misunderstanding,

08:08.760 --> 08:11.760
and then, after eventually being released,

08:11.760 --> 08:13.760
he turns to terrorism because revenge.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.760
But he's still a good guy deep down.

08:15.760 --> 08:18.760
Something you get here that you don't get in other media

08:18.760 --> 08:20.760
is that no one's born in India.

08:20.760 --> 08:23.760
And you end up with sympathetic portrayals of terrorists,

08:23.760 --> 08:26.760
which I kind of have mixed feelings about,

08:26.760 --> 08:30.760
but this video is long enough and we're not going there.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.760
Point is, these guys turn to terrorism,

08:32.760 --> 08:36.760
but it has fuck all to do with what they perceive as a religious righteousness.

08:36.760 --> 08:38.760
They're just mad at the American government

08:38.760 --> 08:41.760
for having wrongly assumed that they were terrorists,

08:41.760 --> 08:44.760
so they became terrorists,

08:44.760 --> 08:47.760
which kind of undermines the message a little bit, but whatever.

08:47.760 --> 08:52.760
Mostly, terrorists hate the FBI, not any other aspect of the U.S.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.760
I'm spending a lot of time on this one because I think

08:54.760 --> 08:57.760
seeing the issue dealt with from a non-American perspective

08:57.760 --> 08:59.760
isn't just interesting, it's vital.

08:59.760 --> 09:03.760
It is both critical and sympathetic to the U.S.,

09:03.760 --> 09:07.760
even though it ends with the worst child actor in America and India combined

09:07.760 --> 09:09.760
to represent hope for the future.

09:09.760 --> 09:10.760
He's an old friend.

09:10.760 --> 09:13.760
Who, your friend or Papa's friend?

09:13.760 --> 09:15.760
Was this the producer's kid?

09:15.760 --> 09:17.760
In an even more interesting discussion,

09:17.760 --> 09:20.760
I'm H.O., the most high-profile of the Bollywood group

09:20.760 --> 09:22.760
is the Shah Rukh Khan-starring vehicle,

09:22.760 --> 09:24.760
My Name Is Khan. Khan.

09:24.760 --> 09:26.760
Islam? Khan. Khan.

09:26.760 --> 09:29.760
This one is a double-issue movie,

09:29.760 --> 09:33.760
as the innocent, virtuous, naive protagonist, Rizvan,

09:33.760 --> 09:36.760
is a Muslim with Asperger's syndrome.

09:36.760 --> 09:41.760
And, you know, let's just leave the discussion to the end.

09:41.760 --> 09:45.760
Let's just leave the discussion of that depiction for another day.

09:49.760 --> 09:51.760
The movie begins with an uncomfortable scene of Rizvan

09:51.760 --> 09:54.760
getting detained by the TSA for acting weird,

09:54.760 --> 09:57.760
only the reason he's acting weird is because he's autistic.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.760
And it is a pretty powerful start to the film,

09:59.760 --> 10:02.760
and it's based on Shah Rukh Khan's personal experiences.

10:02.760 --> 10:06.760
He's gotten detained many times, but...

10:07.760 --> 10:08.760
this movie.

10:08.760 --> 10:10.760
So, flashback to before 9-11,

10:10.760 --> 10:12.760
the land of hearts and flowers and sunshine.

10:12.760 --> 10:14.760
He moves to San Francisco,

10:14.760 --> 10:16.760
falls in love with and marries a Hindu woman,

10:16.760 --> 10:20.760
but then 9-11, and suddenly they are persona non grata

10:20.760 --> 10:22.760
because Allah.

10:22.760 --> 10:24.760
This movie is just fascinating,

10:24.760 --> 10:27.760
and it could be a really long video on its own, right?

10:27.760 --> 10:28.760
But, um...

10:28.760 --> 10:32.760
Like, yeah, things weren't great right after 9-11,

10:32.760 --> 10:36.760
but, you know, it wasn't like every night was Kristallnacht.

10:36.760 --> 10:40.760
So, the discrimination experienced by Rizvan, his wife, and stepson

10:40.760 --> 10:45.760
mostly comes from the apparently overtly Muslim sounding surname Khan.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.760
My last name is Khan.

10:47.760 --> 10:48.760
My husband is Muslim.

10:48.760 --> 10:50.760
Which...

10:52.760 --> 10:53.760
Okay, here's the thing.

10:53.760 --> 10:56.760
When Americans hear the word Khan,

10:56.760 --> 10:58.760
the connotations in order go

10:58.760 --> 11:00.760
Khan!

11:00.760 --> 11:02.760
and Genghis and

11:02.760 --> 11:04.760
Shah Rukh Khan, Shah Rukh Khan

11:04.760 --> 11:06.760
But...

11:06.760 --> 11:07.760
Okay.

11:07.760 --> 11:12.760
I'm not trying to make it seem like things didn't get worse for Muslims in America right after 9-11,

11:12.760 --> 11:14.760
but my name is Khan...

11:14.760 --> 11:16.760
It lacks a certain nuance.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.760
Of all the world's religions,

11:18.760 --> 11:20.760
Islam is the most violent and aggressive.

11:20.760 --> 11:22.760
It encourages killing,

11:22.760 --> 11:24.760
or jihad as they call it,

11:24.760 --> 11:26.760
in the name of God.

11:26.760 --> 11:28.760
Um...

11:28.760 --> 11:30.760
Einamunutibitta...

11:30.760 --> 11:31.760
Um...

11:31.760 --> 11:32.760
Oh god, we could spend all day on this.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.760
And not to be even more Debbie Downer over here,

11:34.760 --> 11:36.760
but like...

11:36.760 --> 11:39.760
Let's just say shit's way worse now than it was back in 2001.

11:39.760 --> 11:43.760
Like to compare, this is George W. Bush in 2001.

11:43.760 --> 11:46.760
I also want to speak tonight directly to Muslims throughout the world.

11:46.760 --> 11:48.760
We respect your faith.

11:48.760 --> 11:51.760
The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends.

11:51.760 --> 11:54.760
And here is the Republican nominee today.

11:54.760 --> 11:56.760
I think Islam...

11:56.760 --> 11:57.760
hates us.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.760
Total and complete shutdown

11:59.760 --> 12:02.760
of Muslims entering the United States.

12:02.760 --> 12:04.760
It was a different time!

12:04.760 --> 12:07.760
While this film did get a limited American release,

12:07.760 --> 12:10.760
this was not meant for an American audience.

12:10.760 --> 12:14.760
It was using an American setting to tell a story

12:14.760 --> 12:17.760
by Indians for an Indian audience.

12:17.760 --> 12:21.760
But it certainly has some interesting ideas on what Americans are like,

12:21.760 --> 12:24.760
from children doing a murder hate crime

12:24.760 --> 12:28.760
to impoverished black community living in dilapidated shacks

12:28.760 --> 12:31.760
and then singing We Shall Overcome.

12:31.760 --> 12:38.760
We shall overcome someday

12:38.760 --> 12:42.760
And the sing-along is led by a character who is named, I shit you not,

12:42.760 --> 12:44.760
Funny Hair Joel.

12:44.760 --> 12:45.760
Yeah.

12:45.760 --> 12:48.760
Although, there is some poetic irony in the fact that

12:48.760 --> 12:51.760
here you have a movie about a guy whose name is Khan

12:51.760 --> 12:55.760
and his goal is to track down the president and tell him that his name is Khan

12:55.760 --> 12:57.760
and that he is not a terrorist.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.760
My name is Khan

12:59.760 --> 13:01.760
and I'm not a terrorist.

13:02.760 --> 13:04.760
And yet, here we are in 2016.

13:04.760 --> 13:08.760
We actually have a Muslim-American family whose name is Khan

13:08.760 --> 13:14.760
and on a national stage tells a presidential nominee that they are not terrorists.

13:14.760 --> 13:20.760
Donald Trump consistently smears the character of Muslims.

13:20.760 --> 13:23.760
Maybe this movie isn't so far-fetched after all.

13:23.760 --> 13:27.760
There are a bunch more Bollywood movies that, if not directly dealing with 9-11,

13:27.760 --> 13:29.760
then a 9-11-like event.

13:29.760 --> 13:33.760
But most of them didn't come out until after November 26, 2008

13:33.760 --> 13:36.760
or 26-11, as it's known over there.

13:36.760 --> 13:41.760
The November attacks in Mumbai that were among the most deadly terror attacks in India

13:41.760 --> 13:42.760
up to that point.

13:42.760 --> 13:44.760
And this was not a one-off thing.

13:44.760 --> 13:48.760
India has had a big terrorism problem for a really long time.

13:48.760 --> 13:54.760
So a lot of Indian films deal with terrorism, and in these few cases use the Indian diaspora to do so.

13:54.760 --> 14:00.760
And I think that plays into the idea that societies have a need to deal with the thing that happened,

14:00.760 --> 14:03.760
but indirectly is more palatable than directly.

14:03.760 --> 14:07.760
So one way of doing that was to make movies about terrorism that don't take place in India,

14:07.760 --> 14:12.760
therefore 9-11, which is not as intimate or painful to Indians as 26-11,

14:12.760 --> 14:16.760
but still addresses that need to, you know, deal with the thing.

14:16.760 --> 14:19.760
It is, in the end, an appeal to hope.

14:29.760 --> 14:34.760
And to address that need to find meaning in shitty world events.

14:34.760 --> 14:37.760
Feels pretty relevant now.

14:37.760 --> 14:43.760
Meanwhile, back in the US, the trend shifted from films about the event itself to films about the aftermath.

14:43.760 --> 14:50.760
2007's Rain Over Me stars Don Cheadle and a trying-to-be-dramatic but still acting like Adam Sandler, Adam Sandler.

14:57.760 --> 15:00.760
He's a former doctor who lost his whole family in the attacks,

15:00.760 --> 15:04.760
so now he's a guy who's just so deluded and in denial about his loss

15:04.760 --> 15:09.760
that he's basically drained of all basic human empathy, I guess.

15:13.760 --> 15:16.760
So here is a movie that is literally about coping with trauma,

15:16.760 --> 15:21.760
although another weird aspect is that everyone's so vague about what the tragedy actually was.

15:25.760 --> 15:30.760
Why are we being coy about this movie? Like, it's New York. Just say 9-11.

15:30.760 --> 15:34.760
Sandler's method of imparting pain by drama is screaming.

15:43.760 --> 15:50.760
Yeah, this feels like maybe your issues run a little deeper than just grief.

15:50.760 --> 15:55.760
Then there's the infamous Remember Me, which was the not-Twilight that starred Robert Pattinson.

15:55.760 --> 15:58.760
Although, Christ, it even looks like Twilight.

15:58.760 --> 16:02.760
Well, this movie is infamous because after two hours of unremarkable drama,

16:02.760 --> 16:06.760
I honestly cannot remember what the love story even was,

16:06.760 --> 16:12.760
our pets goes to meet his dad at work, and you guessed it, the World Trade Center.

16:12.760 --> 16:17.760
And then the movie ends. It's like getting Rick-rolled by 9-11.

16:20.760 --> 16:25.760
And it's mostly out of nowhere. Like, there are some shots that kind of telegraph where this is going,

16:25.760 --> 16:30.760
but for the most part, the film has fuck all to do with themes of, I don't know,

16:30.760 --> 16:35.760
innocence, loss, terrorism, something to do with 9-11.

16:35.760 --> 16:38.760
In Julie and Julia, the Julie half plays a

16:38.760 --> 16:41.760
mid-level bureaucrat attempting to deal with the after effects of 9-11.

16:41.760 --> 16:44.760
Good summation. Thank you.

16:54.760 --> 16:56.760
Yeah, I know it's based on this woman's real life,

16:56.760 --> 17:02.760
but it was the movie's decision to frame the families and victims of 9-11 as like entitled customers.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.760
Please don't yell at me.

17:14.760 --> 17:17.760
And then trying to make her seem like the beleaguered one,

17:17.760 --> 17:21.760
and the people who are calling are the things she needs escaping from.

17:21.760 --> 17:25.760
Another in the 9-11 as the backdrop for young love genre is Dear John,

17:25.760 --> 17:28.760
adapted from the Nicholas Sparks book of the same name,

17:28.760 --> 17:32.760
and starring Channing Tatum...zabs.

17:32.760 --> 17:36.760
And Amanda Seyfried. Yeah, I don't remember it either. It's...

17:36.760 --> 17:37.760
Boring, mostly.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.760
Well put, Tatum's.

17:39.760 --> 17:42.760
You don't drink? Nope. You don't smoke? Nope.

17:42.760 --> 17:45.760
Well, they probably don't sleep around. Absolutely not.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.760
See, white bread is on leave from the army,

17:47.760 --> 17:49.760
and mayonnaise is the girl next door,

17:49.760 --> 17:53.760
and they have a cute little summer romance before she goes back to college,

17:53.760 --> 17:56.760
and then he goes back to the army, and then 9-11.

17:58.760 --> 18:02.760
And here's the difference between something you might have seen like earlier on this list,

18:02.760 --> 18:06.760
is that this one is a lot more feelingsy than jingoistic.

18:06.760 --> 18:09.760
But I think that in and of itself is interesting,

18:09.760 --> 18:13.760
because in 2010, it's like we'd already forgotten that intense jingoism

18:13.760 --> 18:15.760
that immediately followed 9-11,

18:15.760 --> 18:17.760
how people just lost their goddamn minds,

18:17.760 --> 18:20.760
such to the point that invading Iraq sounded like a good idea.

18:20.760 --> 18:25.760
See, John reenlists less out of a sense of duty or desire for retribution

18:25.760 --> 18:27.760
than out of peer pressure,

18:27.760 --> 18:29.760
and then again because his girlfriend dumped him.

18:29.760 --> 18:34.760
It barely touches on patriotism. It's all about feelings.

18:34.760 --> 18:37.760
And then there's the coup de grace, the twee-est of the lot,

18:37.760 --> 18:40.760
extremely loud and incredibly close.

18:40.760 --> 18:43.760
It is the film that wanted to be the definitive 9-11 movie,

18:43.760 --> 18:45.760
and it is so twee.

18:45.760 --> 18:51.760
It's like a feature-length Decemberist song about 9-11.

18:52.760 --> 18:57.760
If the sun were to explode, you wouldn't even know about it for eight minutes.

18:57.760 --> 19:02.760
It's basically a fanfic of the famous photograph called The Falling Man.

19:02.760 --> 19:07.760
This kid named Oscar believes that guy is his dad, and he's played by Tom Hanks,

19:07.760 --> 19:13.760
and the film features a CGI recreation of Tom Hanks falling into the camera

19:13.760 --> 19:17.760
with the World Trade Center falling on top of him.

19:18.760 --> 19:21.760
Yeah, so Tom Hanks used to create, like, puzzles for this kid

19:21.760 --> 19:24.760
to get him to go outside and engage with the world,

19:24.760 --> 19:27.760
you know, like a proto-Pokemon Go, but then 9-11.

19:27.760 --> 19:30.760
So post-tragedy, this kid comes to the conclusion

19:30.760 --> 19:33.760
that his dad left him a mystery to solve for a reason,

19:33.760 --> 19:36.760
and it turns out, no, no, he didn't.

19:36.760 --> 19:40.760
It was just a random key he found, and it belonged to B.T. over here.

19:40.760 --> 19:43.760
This film was based on the Jonathan Safran Foer book of the same name,

19:43.760 --> 19:49.760
and his premise was based on his supposition that 9-11 turned us into a nation of children,

19:49.760 --> 19:52.760
and yeah, there is something to that.

19:52.760 --> 19:55.760
Again, we were all lost and traumatized and searching for meaning,

19:55.760 --> 20:00.760
but if we were a nation of children, it's not the innocent naivets

20:00.760 --> 20:05.760
who cannot understand how such evil exists in the world like Oscar or Rizvan.

20:05.760 --> 20:07.760
It'd be more like this.

20:07.760 --> 20:08.760
Yalla!

20:08.760 --> 20:09.760
Stop it!

20:09.760 --> 20:10.760
Take me home!

20:10.760 --> 20:11.760
No, I am the mother!

20:11.760 --> 20:13.760
No, no, no!

20:13.760 --> 20:15.760
The thing about Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close

20:15.760 --> 20:17.760
is there was a good movie buried in here.

20:17.760 --> 20:21.760
Like, it's the story of this kid who lost his dad in 9-11

20:21.760 --> 20:24.760
and is trying to make sense of it, and there is no sense to be made,

20:24.760 --> 20:28.760
and I really do like this scene where Sandra Bullock puts that into words.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.760
I don't know why a man flew a plane to a building.

20:31.760 --> 20:34.760
I don't know why my husband is dead.

20:34.760 --> 20:39.760
But no matter how you try, Oscar, it's never gonna make sense because it doesn't.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.760
It doesn't make sense.

20:42.760 --> 20:45.760
I think there is a great story in the idea in this kid's search for meaning.

20:45.760 --> 20:50.760
He learns that there isn't any, that 9-11 didn't happen for a reason,

20:50.760 --> 20:53.760
and he learns to come to terms with that.

20:53.760 --> 20:54.760
But, eh.

20:54.760 --> 20:57.760
As New York-y as this wants to be, it's no 25th hour.

20:57.760 --> 21:01.760
It feels kind of outsider's perspective.

21:01.760 --> 21:06.760
Like My Name Is Khan, they're going for a sensitive portrayal of someone on the autism spectrum,

21:06.760 --> 21:09.760
but it's so hollow and twee.

21:09.760 --> 21:13.760
But the worst day made the list of things a lot longer.

21:13.760 --> 21:17.760
What we see aren't characteristics, but a series of quirks.

21:17.760 --> 21:18.760
Crying.

21:18.760 --> 21:19.760
People with bad teeth.

21:19.760 --> 21:20.760
Bags without owners.

21:20.760 --> 21:21.760
Chews without owners.

21:21.760 --> 21:22.760
Children without parents.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.760
And extremely loud and incredibly close seem to mark

21:25.760 --> 21:30.760
Hollywood's last-ditch attempt to mine 9-11 for Oscar Gold.

21:30.760 --> 21:32.760
It's just not gonna happen anytime soon,

21:32.760 --> 21:38.760
but I'm certain we will see a Titanic-style, sweeping, epic 9-11 romance in 70 years or so.

21:38.760 --> 21:45.760
It's still hashtag too soon, but as soon as most of the people who remember it die off, it won't be.

21:45.760 --> 21:46.760
Yay.

21:46.760 --> 21:51.760
Media in recent years has drifted from the actual attack of 9-11 to the periphery,

21:51.760 --> 21:54.760
namely the assassination of Osama bin Laden.

21:54.760 --> 21:56.760
Zero Dark Thirty barely alludes to 9-11.

21:56.760 --> 22:03.760
It's all about the hunt for bin Laden, which we seem to be more comfortable with now that he's, you know, dead.

22:03.760 --> 22:06.760
Okay, so how do you know it's bin Laden?

22:06.760 --> 22:08.760
Because the truth is we've been on this op before.

22:08.760 --> 22:11.760
It was 07, and it wasn't bin Laden, and we lost a couple of guys.

22:11.760 --> 22:14.760
This is Burt Macklin's greatest assignment yet.

22:14.760 --> 22:16.760
And more recently, this thing of beauty.

22:16.760 --> 22:24.760
She demanded that I fuck her like we fucked bin Laden. Fucked bin Laden. Fucked bin Laden.

22:24.760 --> 22:29.760
She wanted to fuck me harder than the U.S. government. Fucked bin Laden.

22:29.760 --> 22:33.760
I don't understand why this isn't the next I'm on a boat.

22:33.760 --> 22:34.760
Hashtag too soon?

22:34.760 --> 22:38.760
She said invade my cave with your special unit. I said he wasn't in a cave, but-

22:38.760 --> 22:44.760
Although one of the weirder things I came across is that there's a 9-11 virtual reality game.

22:44.760 --> 22:46.760
By the way, we have this mini-

22:56.760 --> 22:57.760
Yikes.

22:57.760 --> 23:01.760
As with most historical events, the further you get from it, the more it feels like fiction.

23:01.760 --> 23:05.760
Like with Titanic, more than 1200 people died tragically,

23:05.760 --> 23:10.760
but it wasn't weird making a sweeping fictionalized soap opera romance in 1997.

23:11.760 --> 23:15.760
But we're still not there with 9-11. Thank god.

23:15.760 --> 23:18.760
I don't know where we are, honestly.

23:18.760 --> 23:22.760
I went to the 9-11 museum on Ground Zero in researching this episode.

23:22.760 --> 23:30.760
I'd read from families of the victims that they didn't really like that the worst day of their lives was now a tourist attraction.

23:30.760 --> 23:37.760
I'd heard also from personal friends that there was a trend of foreign tourists and teenagers too young to remember it

23:37.760 --> 23:41.760
being loud inside the museum and using selfie sticks.

23:41.760 --> 23:44.760
But I did not find that to be the case on the day that I went.

23:44.760 --> 23:51.760
The truth is, I had kind of buried what those days and months after 9-11 were like.

23:51.760 --> 24:00.760
I went to the museum to research for an episode and ended up reliving 15 years of emotions that I didn't realize I had buried.

24:00.760 --> 24:08.760
And that we as a culture haven't really processed, which I think in part might be why we are lashing out the way we are.

24:08.760 --> 24:16.760
We may never fully process that collective trauma, so we just kind of bury it, and despite all evidence to the contrary, we act like we've moved on.

24:16.760 --> 24:22.760
Negative and unexpected events are the most likely to trigger spontaneous attributional searches for meaning,

24:22.760 --> 24:25.760
and I think we need to understand that about our culture.

24:25.760 --> 24:31.760
And it's an important element in understanding why our media is the way it is when it is made.

24:31.760 --> 24:37.760
That's why Spielberg made what was, in my opinion, the most successful 9-11 movie with War of the Worlds.

24:37.760 --> 24:42.760
It was a pretty overt reference, but that was what it was going for.

24:42.760 --> 24:48.760
Spielberg was intentionally trying to capture that terror, that confusion, that desire for retribution

24:48.760 --> 24:51.760
We get back at them! We get back at them!

24:51.760 --> 25:00.760
That encapsulated that post-9-11 atmosphere, and that's why Man of Steel ended up being somewhat controversial for its similar use of 9-11 imagery.

25:00.760 --> 25:06.760
And then in response to that controversy, ham-fistedly doubling down on his 9-11 parable and its sequel.

25:06.760 --> 25:12.760
Some people responded to it positively, some thought it was disgusting and exploitative.

25:12.760 --> 25:14.760
Hashtag too soon.

25:14.760 --> 25:19.760
If you're going to appropriate collectively traumatic imagery, it had goddamn better well say something.

25:19.760 --> 25:24.760
And that's another reason why the Marvel Cinematic Universe is overall less controversial.

25:24.760 --> 25:29.760
Because its imagery isn't so overtly 9-11y as the DC Universe.

25:29.760 --> 25:32.760
But all the same, it draws on real-world conflicts.

25:32.760 --> 25:35.760
Lots of battles that are meant to echo real-world sentiment,

25:35.760 --> 25:41.760
but Captain America has never, for instance, gone up against Islamic extremists, or even Nazis for that matter.

25:41.760 --> 25:43.760
Just fake Nazis.

25:44.760 --> 25:48.760
No one in the Marvel Universe ever claims a real-world religion as their motivation.

25:48.760 --> 25:53.760
It mirrors our world, but not too much. Not uncomfortably so.

25:53.760 --> 25:57.760
There's a catharsis for a thing without actually talking about the thing.

25:57.760 --> 26:03.760
Even in Iron Man, while the trouble starts in Afghanistan and Tony spends plenty of time terror-assing over there,

26:03.760 --> 26:07.760
none of the terrorists' motives seem to be based in some perceived holy war.

26:07.760 --> 26:13.760
They speak Arabic, Urdu, Dari, Pashto, Mongolian, Farsi, Russian.

26:13.760 --> 26:17.760
See? Hey, these guys are from all over the place and totally not Saudi Arabia.

26:17.760 --> 26:21.760
It's more palatable to an audience to deal with this indirectly than directly.

26:21.760 --> 26:29.760
That's why Bollywood prefers 9-11 to 26-11, and why Hollywood uses evocative imagery rather than the direct subject of 9-11.

26:29.760 --> 26:32.760
Because when they do, it tends to suck.

26:34.760 --> 26:40.760
And from a personal recommendation standpoint, I recommend that everybody reads The Looming Tower by Lawrence Wright.

26:40.760 --> 26:45.760
It won the Pulitzer in 2006. It goes into great depth about why Al-Qaeda is the way it is.

26:45.760 --> 26:50.760
There is one connective theme here, and that is the desire to make sense of what happened.

26:50.760 --> 26:54.760
It's why some people have decided that it was actually a part of a vast conspiracy,

26:54.760 --> 27:02.760
rather than the fact that, yes, 11 guys armed with box cutters were really able to hijack these planes and change the course of world history.

27:02.760 --> 27:08.760
And there is no one answer for that, nor really any satisfying conclusion to come to,

27:08.760 --> 27:13.760
because the subject is in itself so complex and all-encompassing.

27:13.760 --> 27:16.760
We all have our own conclusions.
