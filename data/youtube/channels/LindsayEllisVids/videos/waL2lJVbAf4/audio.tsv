0	7520	So, after the likes of World Trade Center, United 93, and a slew of made-for-TV movies that are kind of funny to look at now...
11720	13800	I'm gonna need you at my side at all times.
15920	17920	Consuliary.
18000	21680	There were those that decided, hey, maybe it's time to lighten up.
22800	27720	I wanted to say I'm sorry. I was in my mid-20s and I was going through a lot of stuff.
27720	30300	I think I never really processed 9-11.
31120	32800	Lindsay and I have
32800	34800	hit a bit of a rough patch.
35360	36960	Really? When did that start?
36960	42120	Well, I don't want to blame it all on 9-11, but it certainly didn't help.
42120	47080	Team America World Police, high again Matt, Stone, and Trey Parker, is basically one extended 9-11 joke.
47440	51560	From what intelligence has gathered, it would be 9-11 times a hundred.
53720	55560	9-11 times a hundred?
55560	56880	Jesus, that's...
56880	60320	Yes, ninety-one thousand one hundred.
60320	66440	Once again, like in South Park, they're more preoccupied with America's world police-y-ness than the event in its fallout.
66880	71200	Don't worry. Everything is bold. We stopped the terrorists.
73600	76560	9-11 is a favorite joke topic for Seth MacFarlane.
76560	79560	Mrs. Griffin, what are your plans for cleaning up our environment?
80160	82160	9-11.
82680	86360	This may, in part, have to do with the fact that, according to MacFarlane,
86360	91160	he nearly became a victim of the attack since he was originally scheduled to board one of the planes,
91480	94960	but then he had a hangover and he overslept.
94960	96360	Your favorite holiday?
96360	96960	Christmas.
96960	97560	9-11.
97560	101960	So MacFarlane, more than most people, has a bit of a fixation on 9-11.
101960	103560	Ground zero.
103660	106360	So this is where the first guy got AIDS.
106360	109360	This is nowhere more evident than in the 2011 episode,
109560	112560	Back to the Pilot, in which Stewie and Brian go back in time,
112560	117560	and MacFarlane self-insert in dog form Brian informs his past self about 9-11,
117560	119560	thereby preventing it.
119560	121560	Time to terrorize the terrorists.
121560	126560	But preventing 9-11 causes a Terminator-style dystopia, because of course it does,
126560	131560	so they have to go back and, in effect, make sure 9-11 happens.
131560	138560	I have a really hard time believing that a present with no 9-11 could possibly be worse than the one we're currently in,
138760	139760	but...
140760	141760	Okay.
141760	146760	We see it referenced again in Ted, in the scene where the titular character is racist at Norah Jones.
146760	151760	Oh, you know, I'm not a hot half-Muslim chick who sold 37 million records, but I'm hanging in there.
151760	153760	Oh, half-Indian, but thanks.
153760	154760	Yeah, whatever, thanks for 9-11.
154760	158760	And here to make everyone else on this list look good, Uwe Boll.
158760	160760	We are at the doorstep of our martyrdom.
160760	161760	Praise Allah.
161760	162760	Praise him.
162960	163960	Nobody likes Uwe Boll.
163960	168960	Even people who decry political correctness ruining everything don't like Uwe Boll,
168960	170960	because he sucks, and he isn't funny.
170960	176960	Postal opens with the 9-11 attacks and a comedy scene between the two hijackers.
176960	180960	It has some of the worst-sounding ADR I've ever heard in any movie,
180960	184960	and it's so distractically terrible I couldn't even pay attention to what they were talking about.
184960	187960	Then you'll have five more virgins than you have right now.
187960	188960	Right.
188960	189960	We're talking about eternity here.
190160	193160	Something about the number of virgins, they were promised being a deal-breaker,
193160	195160	and then they call off the attacks,
195160	199160	but then the well-meaning passengers try to take control of the plane,
199160	201160	and oops, they plow into the towers.
203160	206160	In Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay,
206160	210160	Harold and Kumar, well, go to Guantanamo Bay and then escape,
210160	215160	because Kumar looks a touch terrorist-y for this lady's taste.
220160	222160	Ahh!
224160	225160	And also this.
225160	227160	This is just a bomb.
227160	228160	You say you got a bomb!
228160	229160	See, here's the thing.
229160	234160	I feel like taking drugs on a plane is still gonna get you in pretty big trouble.
234160	238160	Like, not Guantanamo Bay trouble, but never mind.
238160	241160	They spend about five minutes in Gitmo before going on a road trip
241160	243160	and eventually getting high with George W. Bush.
243160	246160	And the problem with this one, unlike the first Harold and Kumar,
246360	248360	is it's not very clever.
248360	251360	Like, it doesn't really say much about the post-9-11 atmosphere
251360	253360	other than poking fun at the paranoia.
256360	258360	And the scenes in Guantanamo are like...
262360	264360	You know what's funny?
264360	265360	Prison rape.
276360	277360	It's hilarious.
282360	285360	I hope this scene never ends.
285360	289360	But we would see the white lady mistakes brown guy for terrorist template
289360	291360	time and again.
300360	304360	The Sacha Baron Cohen not very good comedy The Dictator borrows from it.
306160	307360	My 9-11...
312360	315360	And it's also one of the only good jokes in the movie.
315360	318360	We see it again in the Bollywood comedy Terry Bin Laden
318360	320360	which steals it pretty much beat for beat.
326360	331360	Side note, this movie also features one of the more hilarious American accents in all of moviedom.
331360	335360	Gentlemen, I present to you Operation Kick-Ass.
335560	338560	So that's what other countries must feel like when we do it to them.
338560	344560	A 2008 episode of the Sarah Silverman program has Sarah do like a 9-11 tribute
344560	348560	after repeatedly mistaking bearded men for Osama Bin Laden and
348560	350560	running them over with her car.
350560	352560	Osama Bin Laden!
354560	358560	I'm not sure what this one adds to the conversation...
359560	361560	I'm an airplane!
361560	364560	I'm just flying around, living my day!
364760	369760	But meanwhile, in other parts of the world, there are actually a surprising number of Bollywood movies
369760	370760	on the subject.
370760	374760	One of the early ones is called Madhoshi and came out in 2004.
374760	378760	And it begins with a family who's got one sister at a wedding
378760	382760	and another sister who works in New York and she calls home
382760	385760	and they're talking and...
385760	386760	Umm...
386760	387760	Oh no.
387760	389760	We are fine, papa.
389960	390960	Oh no.
390960	391960	Oh no.
391960	392960	This...
392960	394960	This isn't going where I...
405960	407960	What the fuck, India?!
407960	411960	Oh, and then the reaction from the film is like...
419760	422760	Okay, okay.
422760	423760	Sorry.
423760	424760	Oof.
424760	425760	That CG...
425760	426760	I mean, does it...
426760	427760	It looks like postal.
427760	428760	Come on.
428760	430760	Maybe that's where Uwe Boll got the idea.
430760	434760	But anyway, most of the movies using 9-11 or 9-11-ish plot points
434760	437760	in India don't come out until after 2008.
437760	441760	There was a dark-by-Bollywood-standards thriller simply titled
441760	445760	New York about a group of college friends at the fictional
445760	448760	New York State University, which appears to be in New Jersey.
448760	451760	Well, they're good friends until, one day, 9-11.
451760	453760	It was chaos.
453760	457760	Well, years later, Omar is tasked by the FBI to spy on his old buddy Samir,
457760	459760	who is a suspected terrorist.
459760	461760	Omar's like, no, not my old buddy Samir.
461760	463760	He can't be a terrorist.
463760	465760	And then, yeah, actually, he can.
465760	468760	And while this film is flawed,
468760	472760	the different perspective is interesting and honestly kind of necessary.
472760	475760	For one thing, it actually calls out the Patriot Act.
479760	483760	Interesting that a movie made by and for Indians remembered that
483760	485760	the Patriot Act existed.
485760	488760	Sam gets arrested right after 9-11 over a goofy misunderstanding,
488760	491760	and then, after eventually being released,
491760	493760	he turns to terrorism because revenge.
493760	495760	But he's still a good guy deep down.
495760	498760	Something you get here that you don't get in other media
498760	500760	is that no one's born in India.
500760	503760	And you end up with sympathetic portrayals of terrorists,
503760	506760	which I kind of have mixed feelings about,
506760	510760	but this video is long enough and we're not going there.
510760	512760	Point is, these guys turn to terrorism,
512760	516760	but it has fuck all to do with what they perceive as a religious righteousness.
516760	518760	They're just mad at the American government
518760	521760	for having wrongly assumed that they were terrorists,
521760	524760	so they became terrorists,
524760	527760	which kind of undermines the message a little bit, but whatever.
527760	532760	Mostly, terrorists hate the FBI, not any other aspect of the U.S.
532760	534760	I'm spending a lot of time on this one because I think
534760	537760	seeing the issue dealt with from a non-American perspective
537760	539760	isn't just interesting, it's vital.
539760	543760	It is both critical and sympathetic to the U.S.,
543760	547760	even though it ends with the worst child actor in America and India combined
547760	549760	to represent hope for the future.
549760	550760	He's an old friend.
550760	553760	Who, your friend or Papa's friend?
553760	555760	Was this the producer's kid?
555760	557760	In an even more interesting discussion,
557760	560760	I'm H.O., the most high-profile of the Bollywood group
560760	562760	is the Shah Rukh Khan-starring vehicle,
562760	564760	My Name Is Khan. Khan.
564760	566760	Islam? Khan. Khan.
566760	569760	This one is a double-issue movie,
569760	573760	as the innocent, virtuous, naive protagonist, Rizvan,
573760	576760	is a Muslim with Asperger's syndrome.
576760	581760	And, you know, let's just leave the discussion to the end.
581760	585760	Let's just leave the discussion of that depiction for another day.
589760	591760	The movie begins with an uncomfortable scene of Rizvan
591760	594760	getting detained by the TSA for acting weird,
594760	597760	only the reason he's acting weird is because he's autistic.
597760	599760	And it is a pretty powerful start to the film,
599760	602760	and it's based on Shah Rukh Khan's personal experiences.
602760	606760	He's gotten detained many times, but...
607760	608760	this movie.
608760	610760	So, flashback to before 9-11,
610760	612760	the land of hearts and flowers and sunshine.
612760	614760	He moves to San Francisco,
614760	616760	falls in love with and marries a Hindu woman,
616760	620760	but then 9-11, and suddenly they are persona non grata
620760	622760	because Allah.
622760	624760	This movie is just fascinating,
624760	627760	and it could be a really long video on its own, right?
627760	628760	But, um...
628760	632760	Like, yeah, things weren't great right after 9-11,
632760	636760	but, you know, it wasn't like every night was Kristallnacht.
636760	640760	So, the discrimination experienced by Rizvan, his wife, and stepson
640760	645760	mostly comes from the apparently overtly Muslim sounding surname Khan.
645760	647760	My last name is Khan.
647760	648760	My husband is Muslim.
648760	650760	Which...
652760	653760	Okay, here's the thing.
653760	656760	When Americans hear the word Khan,
656760	658760	the connotations in order go
658760	660760	Khan!
660760	662760	and Genghis and
662760	664760	Shah Rukh Khan, Shah Rukh Khan
664760	666760	But...
666760	667760	Okay.
667760	672760	I'm not trying to make it seem like things didn't get worse for Muslims in America right after 9-11,
672760	674760	but my name is Khan...
674760	676760	It lacks a certain nuance.
676760	678760	Of all the world's religions,
678760	680760	Islam is the most violent and aggressive.
680760	682760	It encourages killing,
682760	684760	or jihad as they call it,
684760	686760	in the name of God.
686760	688760	Um...
688760	690760	Einamunutibitta...
690760	691760	Um...
691760	692760	Oh god, we could spend all day on this.
692760	694760	And not to be even more Debbie Downer over here,
694760	696760	but like...
696760	699760	Let's just say shit's way worse now than it was back in 2001.
699760	703760	Like to compare, this is George W. Bush in 2001.
703760	706760	I also want to speak tonight directly to Muslims throughout the world.
706760	708760	We respect your faith.
708760	711760	The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends.
711760	714760	And here is the Republican nominee today.
714760	716760	I think Islam...
716760	717760	hates us.
717760	719760	Total and complete shutdown
719760	722760	of Muslims entering the United States.
722760	724760	It was a different time!
724760	727760	While this film did get a limited American release,
727760	730760	this was not meant for an American audience.
730760	734760	It was using an American setting to tell a story
734760	737760	by Indians for an Indian audience.
737760	741760	But it certainly has some interesting ideas on what Americans are like,
741760	744760	from children doing a murder hate crime
744760	748760	to impoverished black community living in dilapidated shacks
748760	751760	and then singing We Shall Overcome.
751760	758760	We shall overcome someday
758760	762760	And the sing-along is led by a character who is named, I shit you not,
762760	764760	Funny Hair Joel.
764760	765760	Yeah.
765760	768760	Although, there is some poetic irony in the fact that
768760	771760	here you have a movie about a guy whose name is Khan
771760	775760	and his goal is to track down the president and tell him that his name is Khan
775760	777760	and that he is not a terrorist.
777760	779760	My name is Khan
779760	781760	and I'm not a terrorist.
782760	784760	And yet, here we are in 2016.
784760	788760	We actually have a Muslim-American family whose name is Khan
788760	794760	and on a national stage tells a presidential nominee that they are not terrorists.
794760	800760	Donald Trump consistently smears the character of Muslims.
800760	803760	Maybe this movie isn't so far-fetched after all.
803760	807760	There are a bunch more Bollywood movies that, if not directly dealing with 9-11,
807760	809760	then a 9-11-like event.
809760	813760	But most of them didn't come out until after November 26, 2008
813760	816760	or 26-11, as it's known over there.
816760	821760	The November attacks in Mumbai that were among the most deadly terror attacks in India
821760	822760	up to that point.
822760	824760	And this was not a one-off thing.
824760	828760	India has had a big terrorism problem for a really long time.
828760	834760	So a lot of Indian films deal with terrorism, and in these few cases use the Indian diaspora to do so.
834760	840760	And I think that plays into the idea that societies have a need to deal with the thing that happened,
840760	843760	but indirectly is more palatable than directly.
843760	847760	So one way of doing that was to make movies about terrorism that don't take place in India,
847760	852760	therefore 9-11, which is not as intimate or painful to Indians as 26-11,
852760	856760	but still addresses that need to, you know, deal with the thing.
856760	859760	It is, in the end, an appeal to hope.
869760	874760	And to address that need to find meaning in shitty world events.
874760	877760	Feels pretty relevant now.
877760	883760	Meanwhile, back in the US, the trend shifted from films about the event itself to films about the aftermath.
883760	890760	2007's Rain Over Me stars Don Cheadle and a trying-to-be-dramatic but still acting like Adam Sandler, Adam Sandler.
897760	900760	He's a former doctor who lost his whole family in the attacks,
900760	904760	so now he's a guy who's just so deluded and in denial about his loss
904760	909760	that he's basically drained of all basic human empathy, I guess.
913760	916760	So here is a movie that is literally about coping with trauma,
916760	921760	although another weird aspect is that everyone's so vague about what the tragedy actually was.
925760	930760	Why are we being coy about this movie? Like, it's New York. Just say 9-11.
930760	934760	Sandler's method of imparting pain by drama is screaming.
943760	950760	Yeah, this feels like maybe your issues run a little deeper than just grief.
950760	955760	Then there's the infamous Remember Me, which was the not-Twilight that starred Robert Pattinson.
955760	958760	Although, Christ, it even looks like Twilight.
958760	962760	Well, this movie is infamous because after two hours of unremarkable drama,
962760	966760	I honestly cannot remember what the love story even was,
966760	972760	our pets goes to meet his dad at work, and you guessed it, the World Trade Center.
972760	977760	And then the movie ends. It's like getting Rick-rolled by 9-11.
980760	985760	And it's mostly out of nowhere. Like, there are some shots that kind of telegraph where this is going,
985760	990760	but for the most part, the film has fuck all to do with themes of, I don't know,
990760	995760	innocence, loss, terrorism, something to do with 9-11.
995760	998760	In Julie and Julia, the Julie half plays a
998760	1001760	mid-level bureaucrat attempting to deal with the after effects of 9-11.
1001760	1004760	Good summation. Thank you.
1014760	1016760	Yeah, I know it's based on this woman's real life,
1016760	1022760	but it was the movie's decision to frame the families and victims of 9-11 as like entitled customers.
1032760	1034760	Please don't yell at me.
1034760	1037760	And then trying to make her seem like the beleaguered one,
1037760	1041760	and the people who are calling are the things she needs escaping from.
1041760	1045760	Another in the 9-11 as the backdrop for young love genre is Dear John,
1045760	1048760	adapted from the Nicholas Sparks book of the same name,
1048760	1052760	and starring Channing Tatum...zabs.
1052760	1056760	And Amanda Seyfried. Yeah, I don't remember it either. It's...
1056760	1057760	Boring, mostly.
1057760	1059760	Well put, Tatum's.
1059760	1062760	You don't drink? Nope. You don't smoke? Nope.
1062760	1065760	Well, they probably don't sleep around. Absolutely not.
1065760	1067760	See, white bread is on leave from the army,
1067760	1069760	and mayonnaise is the girl next door,
1069760	1073760	and they have a cute little summer romance before she goes back to college,
1073760	1076760	and then he goes back to the army, and then 9-11.
1078760	1082760	And here's the difference between something you might have seen like earlier on this list,
1082760	1086760	is that this one is a lot more feelingsy than jingoistic.
1086760	1089760	But I think that in and of itself is interesting,
1089760	1093760	because in 2010, it's like we'd already forgotten that intense jingoism
1093760	1095760	that immediately followed 9-11,
1095760	1097760	how people just lost their goddamn minds,
1097760	1100760	such to the point that invading Iraq sounded like a good idea.
1100760	1105760	See, John reenlists less out of a sense of duty or desire for retribution
1105760	1107760	than out of peer pressure,
1107760	1109760	and then again because his girlfriend dumped him.
1109760	1114760	It barely touches on patriotism. It's all about feelings.
1114760	1117760	And then there's the coup de grace, the twee-est of the lot,
1117760	1120760	extremely loud and incredibly close.
1120760	1123760	It is the film that wanted to be the definitive 9-11 movie,
1123760	1125760	and it is so twee.
1125760	1131760	It's like a feature-length Decemberist song about 9-11.
1132760	1137760	If the sun were to explode, you wouldn't even know about it for eight minutes.
1137760	1142760	It's basically a fanfic of the famous photograph called The Falling Man.
1142760	1147760	This kid named Oscar believes that guy is his dad, and he's played by Tom Hanks,
1147760	1153760	and the film features a CGI recreation of Tom Hanks falling into the camera
1153760	1157760	with the World Trade Center falling on top of him.
1158760	1161760	Yeah, so Tom Hanks used to create, like, puzzles for this kid
1161760	1164760	to get him to go outside and engage with the world,
1164760	1167760	you know, like a proto-Pokemon Go, but then 9-11.
1167760	1170760	So post-tragedy, this kid comes to the conclusion
1170760	1173760	that his dad left him a mystery to solve for a reason,
1173760	1176760	and it turns out, no, no, he didn't.
1176760	1180760	It was just a random key he found, and it belonged to B.T. over here.
1180760	1183760	This film was based on the Jonathan Safran Foer book of the same name,
1183760	1189760	and his premise was based on his supposition that 9-11 turned us into a nation of children,
1189760	1192760	and yeah, there is something to that.
1192760	1195760	Again, we were all lost and traumatized and searching for meaning,
1195760	1200760	but if we were a nation of children, it's not the innocent naivets
1200760	1205760	who cannot understand how such evil exists in the world like Oscar or Rizvan.
1205760	1207760	It'd be more like this.
1207760	1208760	Yalla!
1208760	1209760	Stop it!
1209760	1210760	Take me home!
1210760	1211760	No, I am the mother!
1211760	1213760	No, no, no!
1213760	1215760	The thing about Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close
1215760	1217760	is there was a good movie buried in here.
1217760	1221760	Like, it's the story of this kid who lost his dad in 9-11
1221760	1224760	and is trying to make sense of it, and there is no sense to be made,
1224760	1228760	and I really do like this scene where Sandra Bullock puts that into words.
1228760	1231760	I don't know why a man flew a plane to a building.
1231760	1234760	I don't know why my husband is dead.
1234760	1239760	But no matter how you try, Oscar, it's never gonna make sense because it doesn't.
1239760	1242760	It doesn't make sense.
1242760	1245760	I think there is a great story in the idea in this kid's search for meaning.
1245760	1250760	He learns that there isn't any, that 9-11 didn't happen for a reason,
1250760	1253760	and he learns to come to terms with that.
1253760	1254760	But, eh.
1254760	1257760	As New York-y as this wants to be, it's no 25th hour.
1257760	1261760	It feels kind of outsider's perspective.
1261760	1266760	Like My Name Is Khan, they're going for a sensitive portrayal of someone on the autism spectrum,
1266760	1269760	but it's so hollow and twee.
1269760	1273760	But the worst day made the list of things a lot longer.
1273760	1277760	What we see aren't characteristics, but a series of quirks.
1277760	1278760	Crying.
1278760	1279760	People with bad teeth.
1279760	1280760	Bags without owners.
1280760	1281760	Chews without owners.
1281760	1282760	Children without parents.
1283760	1285760	And extremely loud and incredibly close seem to mark
1285760	1290760	Hollywood's last-ditch attempt to mine 9-11 for Oscar Gold.
1290760	1292760	It's just not gonna happen anytime soon,
1292760	1298760	but I'm certain we will see a Titanic-style, sweeping, epic 9-11 romance in 70 years or so.
1298760	1305760	It's still hashtag too soon, but as soon as most of the people who remember it die off, it won't be.
1305760	1306760	Yay.
1306760	1311760	Media in recent years has drifted from the actual attack of 9-11 to the periphery,
1311760	1314760	namely the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
1314760	1316760	Zero Dark Thirty barely alludes to 9-11.
1316760	1323760	It's all about the hunt for bin Laden, which we seem to be more comfortable with now that he's, you know, dead.
1323760	1326760	Okay, so how do you know it's bin Laden?
1326760	1328760	Because the truth is we've been on this op before.
1328760	1331760	It was 07, and it wasn't bin Laden, and we lost a couple of guys.
1331760	1334760	This is Burt Macklin's greatest assignment yet.
1334760	1336760	And more recently, this thing of beauty.
1336760	1344760	She demanded that I fuck her like we fucked bin Laden. Fucked bin Laden. Fucked bin Laden.
1344760	1349760	She wanted to fuck me harder than the U.S. government. Fucked bin Laden.
1349760	1353760	I don't understand why this isn't the next I'm on a boat.
1353760	1354760	Hashtag too soon?
1354760	1358760	She said invade my cave with your special unit. I said he wasn't in a cave, but-
1358760	1364760	Although one of the weirder things I came across is that there's a 9-11 virtual reality game.
1364760	1366760	By the way, we have this mini-
1376760	1377760	Yikes.
1377760	1381760	As with most historical events, the further you get from it, the more it feels like fiction.
1381760	1385760	Like with Titanic, more than 1200 people died tragically,
1385760	1390760	but it wasn't weird making a sweeping fictionalized soap opera romance in 1997.
1391760	1395760	But we're still not there with 9-11. Thank god.
1395760	1398760	I don't know where we are, honestly.
1398760	1402760	I went to the 9-11 museum on Ground Zero in researching this episode.
1402760	1410760	I'd read from families of the victims that they didn't really like that the worst day of their lives was now a tourist attraction.
1410760	1417760	I'd heard also from personal friends that there was a trend of foreign tourists and teenagers too young to remember it
1417760	1421760	being loud inside the museum and using selfie sticks.
1421760	1424760	But I did not find that to be the case on the day that I went.
1424760	1431760	The truth is, I had kind of buried what those days and months after 9-11 were like.
1431760	1440760	I went to the museum to research for an episode and ended up reliving 15 years of emotions that I didn't realize I had buried.
1440760	1448760	And that we as a culture haven't really processed, which I think in part might be why we are lashing out the way we are.
1448760	1456760	We may never fully process that collective trauma, so we just kind of bury it, and despite all evidence to the contrary, we act like we've moved on.
1456760	1462760	Negative and unexpected events are the most likely to trigger spontaneous attributional searches for meaning,
1462760	1465760	and I think we need to understand that about our culture.
1465760	1471760	And it's an important element in understanding why our media is the way it is when it is made.
1471760	1477760	That's why Spielberg made what was, in my opinion, the most successful 9-11 movie with War of the Worlds.
1477760	1482760	It was a pretty overt reference, but that was what it was going for.
1482760	1488760	Spielberg was intentionally trying to capture that terror, that confusion, that desire for retribution
1488760	1491760	We get back at them! We get back at them!
1491760	1500760	That encapsulated that post-9-11 atmosphere, and that's why Man of Steel ended up being somewhat controversial for its similar use of 9-11 imagery.
1500760	1506760	And then in response to that controversy, ham-fistedly doubling down on his 9-11 parable and its sequel.
1506760	1512760	Some people responded to it positively, some thought it was disgusting and exploitative.
1512760	1514760	Hashtag too soon.
1514760	1519760	If you're going to appropriate collectively traumatic imagery, it had goddamn better well say something.
1519760	1524760	And that's another reason why the Marvel Cinematic Universe is overall less controversial.
1524760	1529760	Because its imagery isn't so overtly 9-11y as the DC Universe.
1529760	1532760	But all the same, it draws on real-world conflicts.
1532760	1535760	Lots of battles that are meant to echo real-world sentiment,
1535760	1541760	but Captain America has never, for instance, gone up against Islamic extremists, or even Nazis for that matter.
1541760	1543760	Just fake Nazis.
1544760	1548760	No one in the Marvel Universe ever claims a real-world religion as their motivation.
1548760	1553760	It mirrors our world, but not too much. Not uncomfortably so.
1553760	1557760	There's a catharsis for a thing without actually talking about the thing.
1557760	1563760	Even in Iron Man, while the trouble starts in Afghanistan and Tony spends plenty of time terror-assing over there,
1563760	1567760	none of the terrorists' motives seem to be based in some perceived holy war.
1567760	1573760	They speak Arabic, Urdu, Dari, Pashto, Mongolian, Farsi, Russian.
1573760	1577760	See? Hey, these guys are from all over the place and totally not Saudi Arabia.
1577760	1581760	It's more palatable to an audience to deal with this indirectly than directly.
1581760	1589760	That's why Bollywood prefers 9-11 to 26-11, and why Hollywood uses evocative imagery rather than the direct subject of 9-11.
1589760	1592760	Because when they do, it tends to suck.
1594760	1600760	And from a personal recommendation standpoint, I recommend that everybody reads The Looming Tower by Lawrence Wright.
1600760	1605760	It won the Pulitzer in 2006. It goes into great depth about why Al-Qaeda is the way it is.
1605760	1610760	There is one connective theme here, and that is the desire to make sense of what happened.
1610760	1614760	It's why some people have decided that it was actually a part of a vast conspiracy,
1614760	1622760	rather than the fact that, yes, 11 guys armed with box cutters were really able to hijack these planes and change the course of world history.
1622760	1628760	And there is no one answer for that, nor really any satisfying conclusion to come to,
1628760	1633760	because the subject is in itself so complex and all-encompassing.
1633760	1636760	We all have our own conclusions.
