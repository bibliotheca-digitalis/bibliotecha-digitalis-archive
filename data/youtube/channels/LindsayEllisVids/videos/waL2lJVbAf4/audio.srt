1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,520
So, after the likes of World Trade Center, United 93, and a slew of made-for-TV movies that are kind of funny to look at now...

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,800
I'm gonna need you at my side at all times.

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,920
Consuliary.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,680
There were those that decided, hey, maybe it's time to lighten up.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,720
I wanted to say I'm sorry. I was in my mid-20s and I was going through a lot of stuff.

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,300
I think I never really processed 9-11.

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,800
Lindsay and I have

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,800
hit a bit of a rough patch.

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,960
Really? When did that start?

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,120
Well, I don't want to blame it all on 9-11, but it certainly didn't help.

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,080
Team America World Police, high again Matt, Stone, and Trey Parker, is basically one extended 9-11 joke.

12
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,560
From what intelligence has gathered, it would be 9-11 times a hundred.

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,560
9-11 times a hundred?

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,880
Jesus, that's...

15
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,320
Yes, ninety-one thousand one hundred.

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,440
Once again, like in South Park, they're more preoccupied with America's world police-y-ness than the event in its fallout.

17
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,200
Don't worry. Everything is bold. We stopped the terrorists.

18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,560
9-11 is a favorite joke topic for Seth MacFarlane.

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,560
Mrs. Griffin, what are your plans for cleaning up our environment?

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,160
9-11.

21
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,360
This may, in part, have to do with the fact that, according to MacFarlane,

22
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,160
he nearly became a victim of the attack since he was originally scheduled to board one of the planes,

23
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,960
but then he had a hangover and he overslept.

24
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,360
Your favorite holiday?

25
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:36,960
Christmas.

26
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,560
9-11.

27
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,960
So MacFarlane, more than most people, has a bit of a fixation on 9-11.

28
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,560
Ground zero.

29
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,360
So this is where the first guy got AIDS.

30
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,360
This is nowhere more evident than in the 2011 episode,

31
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,560
Back to the Pilot, in which Stewie and Brian go back in time,

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,560
and MacFarlane self-insert in dog form Brian informs his past self about 9-11,

33
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,560
thereby preventing it.

34
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,560
Time to terrorize the terrorists.

35
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,560
But preventing 9-11 causes a Terminator-style dystopia, because of course it does,

36
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,560
so they have to go back and, in effect, make sure 9-11 happens.

37
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:18,560
I have a really hard time believing that a present with no 9-11 could possibly be worse than the one we're currently in,

38
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,760
but...

39
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,760
Okay.

40
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,760
We see it referenced again in Ted, in the scene where the titular character is racist at Norah Jones.

41
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,760
Oh, you know, I'm not a hot half-Muslim chick who sold 37 million records, but I'm hanging in there.

42
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,760
Oh, half-Indian, but thanks.

43
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,760
Yeah, whatever, thanks for 9-11.

44
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,760
And here to make everyone else on this list look good, Uwe Boll.

45
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,760
We are at the doorstep of our martyrdom.

46
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,760
Praise Allah.

47
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,760
Praise him.

48
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
Nobody likes Uwe Boll.

49
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,960
Even people who decry political correctness ruining everything don't like Uwe Boll,

50
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,960
because he sucks, and he isn't funny.

51
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,960
Postal opens with the 9-11 attacks and a comedy scene between the two hijackers.

52
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,960
It has some of the worst-sounding ADR I've ever heard in any movie,

53
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,960
and it's so distractically terrible I couldn't even pay attention to what they were talking about.

54
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,960
Then you'll have five more virgins than you have right now.

55
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,960
Right.

56
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,960
We're talking about eternity here.

57
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,160
Something about the number of virgins, they were promised being a deal-breaker,

58
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,160
and then they call off the attacks,

59
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,160
but then the well-meaning passengers try to take control of the plane,

60
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,160
and oops, they plow into the towers.

61
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,160
In Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay,

62
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,160
Harold and Kumar, well, go to Guantanamo Bay and then escape,

63
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,160
because Kumar looks a touch terrorist-y for this lady's taste.

64
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,160
Ahh!

65
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,160
And also this.

66
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,160
This is just a bomb.

67
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,160
You say you got a bomb!

68
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,160
See, here's the thing.

69
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,160
I feel like taking drugs on a plane is still gonna get you in pretty big trouble.

70
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,160
Like, not Guantanamo Bay trouble, but never mind.

71
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,160
They spend about five minutes in Gitmo before going on a road trip

72
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,160
and eventually getting high with George W. Bush.

73
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,160
And the problem with this one, unlike the first Harold and Kumar,

74
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,360
is it's not very clever.

75
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,360
Like, it doesn't really say much about the post-9-11 atmosphere

76
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,360
other than poking fun at the paranoia.

77
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,360
And the scenes in Guantanamo are like...

78
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,360
You know what's funny?

79
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,360
Prison rape.

80
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,360
It's hilarious.

81
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,360
I hope this scene never ends.

82
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,360
But we would see the white lady mistakes brown guy for terrorist template

83
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,360
time and again.

84
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,360
The Sacha Baron Cohen not very good comedy The Dictator borrows from it.

85
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,360
My 9-11...

86
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,360
And it's also one of the only good jokes in the movie.

87
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,360
We see it again in the Bollywood comedy Terry Bin Laden

88
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,360
which steals it pretty much beat for beat.

89
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,360
Side note, this movie also features one of the more hilarious American accents in all of moviedom.

90
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,360
Gentlemen, I present to you Operation Kick-Ass.

91
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,560
So that's what other countries must feel like when we do it to them.

92
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,560
A 2008 episode of the Sarah Silverman program has Sarah do like a 9-11 tribute

93
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,560
after repeatedly mistaking bearded men for Osama Bin Laden and

94
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,560
running them over with her car.

95
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,560
Osama Bin Laden!

96
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,560
I'm not sure what this one adds to the conversation...

97
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,560
I'm an airplane!

98
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,560
I'm just flying around, living my day!

99
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,760
But meanwhile, in other parts of the world, there are actually a surprising number of Bollywood movies

100
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
on the subject.

101
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,760
One of the early ones is called Madhoshi and came out in 2004.

102
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,760
And it begins with a family who's got one sister at a wedding

103
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,760
and another sister who works in New York and she calls home

104
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,760
and they're talking and...

105
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,760
Umm...

106
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,760
Oh no.

107
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,760
We are fine, papa.

108
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Oh no.

109
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
Oh no.

110
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
This...

111
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
This isn't going where I...

112
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,960
What the fuck, India?!

113
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,960
Oh, and then the reaction from the film is like...

114
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,760
Okay, okay.

115
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,760
Sorry.

116
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,760
Oof.

117
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
That CG...

118
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,760
I mean, does it...

119
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,760
It looks like postal.

120
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
Come on.

121
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,760
Maybe that's where Uwe Boll got the idea.

122
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,760
But anyway, most of the movies using 9-11 or 9-11-ish plot points

123
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,760
in India don't come out until after 2008.

124
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,760
There was a dark-by-Bollywood-standards thriller simply titled

125
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,760
New York about a group of college friends at the fictional

126
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,760
New York State University, which appears to be in New Jersey.

127
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,760
Well, they're good friends until, one day, 9-11.

128
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,760
It was chaos.

129
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,760
Well, years later, Omar is tasked by the FBI to spy on his old buddy Samir,

130
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,760
who is a suspected terrorist.

131
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,760
Omar's like, no, not my old buddy Samir.

132
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,760
He can't be a terrorist.

133
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,760
And then, yeah, actually, he can.

134
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,760
And while this film is flawed,

135
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,760
the different perspective is interesting and honestly kind of necessary.

136
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,760
For one thing, it actually calls out the Patriot Act.

137
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,760
Interesting that a movie made by and for Indians remembered that

138
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,760
the Patriot Act existed.

139
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,760
Sam gets arrested right after 9-11 over a goofy misunderstanding,

140
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,760
and then, after eventually being released,

141
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,760
he turns to terrorism because revenge.

142
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,760
But he's still a good guy deep down.

143
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,760
Something you get here that you don't get in other media

144
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,760
is that no one's born in India.

145
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,760
And you end up with sympathetic portrayals of terrorists,

146
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,760
which I kind of have mixed feelings about,

147
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,760
but this video is long enough and we're not going there.

148
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,760
Point is, these guys turn to terrorism,

149
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,760
but it has fuck all to do with what they perceive as a religious righteousness.

150
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,760
They're just mad at the American government

151
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,760
for having wrongly assumed that they were terrorists,

152
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,760
so they became terrorists,

153
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,760
which kind of undermines the message a little bit, but whatever.

154
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,760
Mostly, terrorists hate the FBI, not any other aspect of the U.S.

155
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,760
I'm spending a lot of time on this one because I think

156
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,760
seeing the issue dealt with from a non-American perspective

157
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,760
isn't just interesting, it's vital.

158
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,760
It is both critical and sympathetic to the U.S.,

159
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,760
even though it ends with the worst child actor in America and India combined

160
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,760
to represent hope for the future.

161
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
He's an old friend.

162
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,760
Who, your friend or Papa's friend?

163
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
Was this the producer's kid?

164
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,760
In an even more interesting discussion,

165
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,760
I'm H.O., the most high-profile of the Bollywood group

166
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,760
is the Shah Rukh Khan-starring vehicle,

167
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,760
My Name Is Khan. Khan.

168
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,760
Islam? Khan. Khan.

169
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,760
This one is a double-issue movie,

170
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,760
as the innocent, virtuous, naive protagonist, Rizvan,

171
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,760
is a Muslim with Asperger's syndrome.

172
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,760
And, you know, let's just leave the discussion to the end.

173
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,760
Let's just leave the discussion of that depiction for another day.

174
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,760
The movie begins with an uncomfortable scene of Rizvan

175
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,760
getting detained by the TSA for acting weird,

176
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,760
only the reason he's acting weird is because he's autistic.

177
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,760
And it is a pretty powerful start to the film,

178
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,760
and it's based on Shah Rukh Khan's personal experiences.

179
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,760
He's gotten detained many times, but...

180
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
this movie.

181
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,760
So, flashback to before 9-11,

182
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,760
the land of hearts and flowers and sunshine.

183
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,760
He moves to San Francisco,

184
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,760
falls in love with and marries a Hindu woman,

185
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,760
but then 9-11, and suddenly they are persona non grata

186
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,760
because Allah.

187
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,760
This movie is just fascinating,

188
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,760
and it could be a really long video on its own, right?

189
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,760
But, um...

190
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,760
Like, yeah, things weren't great right after 9-11,

191
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,760
but, you know, it wasn't like every night was Kristallnacht.

192
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,760
So, the discrimination experienced by Rizvan, his wife, and stepson

193
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,760
mostly comes from the apparently overtly Muslim sounding surname Khan.

194
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,760
My last name is Khan.

195
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,760
My husband is Muslim.

196
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,760
Which...

197
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,760
Okay, here's the thing.

198
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,760
When Americans hear the word Khan,

199
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,760
the connotations in order go

200
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,760
Khan!

201
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,760
and Genghis and

202
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,760
Shah Rukh Khan, Shah Rukh Khan

203
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,760
But...

204
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,760
Okay.

205
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,760
I'm not trying to make it seem like things didn't get worse for Muslims in America right after 9-11,

206
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,760
but my name is Khan...

207
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,760
It lacks a certain nuance.

208
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,760
Of all the world's religions,

209
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,760
Islam is the most violent and aggressive.

210
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,760
It encourages killing,

211
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,760
or jihad as they call it,

212
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,760
in the name of God.

213
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,760
Um...

214
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
Einamunutibitta...

215
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Um...

216
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,760
Oh god, we could spend all day on this.

217
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,760
And not to be even more Debbie Downer over here,

218
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,760
but like...

219
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,760
Let's just say shit's way worse now than it was back in 2001.

220
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,760
Like to compare, this is George W. Bush in 2001.

221
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,760
I also want to speak tonight directly to Muslims throughout the world.

222
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,760
We respect your faith.

223
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,760
The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends.

224
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,760
And here is the Republican nominee today.

225
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,760
I think Islam...

226
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
hates us.

227
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
Total and complete shutdown

228
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,760
of Muslims entering the United States.

229
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,760
It was a different time!

230
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,760
While this film did get a limited American release,

231
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,760
this was not meant for an American audience.

232
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,760
It was using an American setting to tell a story

233
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,760
by Indians for an Indian audience.

234
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,760
But it certainly has some interesting ideas on what Americans are like,

235
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,760
from children doing a murder hate crime

236
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,760
to impoverished black community living in dilapidated shacks

237
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,760
and then singing We Shall Overcome.

238
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:38,760
We shall overcome someday

239
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,760
And the sing-along is led by a character who is named, I shit you not,

240
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,760
Funny Hair Joel.

241
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
Yeah.

242
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,760
Although, there is some poetic irony in the fact that

243
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,760
here you have a movie about a guy whose name is Khan

244
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,760
and his goal is to track down the president and tell him that his name is Khan

245
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,760
and that he is not a terrorist.

246
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,760
My name is Khan

247
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,760
and I'm not a terrorist.

248
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,760
And yet, here we are in 2016.

249
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,760
We actually have a Muslim-American family whose name is Khan

250
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:14,760
and on a national stage tells a presidential nominee that they are not terrorists.

251
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:20,760
Donald Trump consistently smears the character of Muslims.

252
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,760
Maybe this movie isn't so far-fetched after all.

253
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,760
There are a bunch more Bollywood movies that, if not directly dealing with 9-11,

254
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,760
then a 9-11-like event.

255
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,760
But most of them didn't come out until after November 26, 2008

256
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,760
or 26-11, as it's known over there.

257
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,760
The November attacks in Mumbai that were among the most deadly terror attacks in India

258
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,760
up to that point.

259
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,760
And this was not a one-off thing.

260
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,760
India has had a big terrorism problem for a really long time.

261
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:54,760
So a lot of Indian films deal with terrorism, and in these few cases use the Indian diaspora to do so.

262
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:00,760
And I think that plays into the idea that societies have a need to deal with the thing that happened,

263
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,760
but indirectly is more palatable than directly.

264
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,760
So one way of doing that was to make movies about terrorism that don't take place in India,

265
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,760
therefore 9-11, which is not as intimate or painful to Indians as 26-11,

266
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,760
but still addresses that need to, you know, deal with the thing.

267
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,760
It is, in the end, an appeal to hope.

268
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,760
And to address that need to find meaning in shitty world events.

269
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,760
Feels pretty relevant now.

270
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,760
Meanwhile, back in the US, the trend shifted from films about the event itself to films about the aftermath.

271
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:50,760
2007's Rain Over Me stars Don Cheadle and a trying-to-be-dramatic but still acting like Adam Sandler, Adam Sandler.

272
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,760
He's a former doctor who lost his whole family in the attacks,

273
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,760
so now he's a guy who's just so deluded and in denial about his loss

274
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,760
that he's basically drained of all basic human empathy, I guess.

275
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,760
So here is a movie that is literally about coping with trauma,

276
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,760
although another weird aspect is that everyone's so vague about what the tragedy actually was.

277
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,760
Why are we being coy about this movie? Like, it's New York. Just say 9-11.

278
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,760
Sandler's method of imparting pain by drama is screaming.

279
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:50,760
Yeah, this feels like maybe your issues run a little deeper than just grief.

280
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:55,760
Then there's the infamous Remember Me, which was the not-Twilight that starred Robert Pattinson.

281
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,760
Although, Christ, it even looks like Twilight.

282
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,760
Well, this movie is infamous because after two hours of unremarkable drama,

283
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,760
I honestly cannot remember what the love story even was,

284
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:12,760
our pets goes to meet his dad at work, and you guessed it, the World Trade Center.

285
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:17,760
And then the movie ends. It's like getting Rick-rolled by 9-11.

286
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,760
And it's mostly out of nowhere. Like, there are some shots that kind of telegraph where this is going,

287
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:30,760
but for the most part, the film has fuck all to do with themes of, I don't know,

288
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:35,760
innocence, loss, terrorism, something to do with 9-11.

289
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,760
In Julie and Julia, the Julie half plays a

290
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,760
mid-level bureaucrat attempting to deal with the after effects of 9-11.

291
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,760
Good summation. Thank you.

292
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,760
Yeah, I know it's based on this woman's real life,

293
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:02,760
but it was the movie's decision to frame the families and victims of 9-11 as like entitled customers.

294
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,760
Please don't yell at me.

295
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,760
And then trying to make her seem like the beleaguered one,

296
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,760
and the people who are calling are the things she needs escaping from.

297
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,760
Another in the 9-11 as the backdrop for young love genre is Dear John,

298
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,760
adapted from the Nicholas Sparks book of the same name,

299
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,760
and starring Channing Tatum...zabs.

300
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,760
And Amanda Seyfried. Yeah, I don't remember it either. It's...

301
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,760
Boring, mostly.

302
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,760
Well put, Tatum's.

303
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,760
You don't drink? Nope. You don't smoke? Nope.

304
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,760
Well, they probably don't sleep around. Absolutely not.

305
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,760
See, white bread is on leave from the army,

306
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,760
and mayonnaise is the girl next door,

307
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,760
and they have a cute little summer romance before she goes back to college,

308
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,760
and then he goes back to the army, and then 9-11.

309
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,760
And here's the difference between something you might have seen like earlier on this list,

310
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,760
is that this one is a lot more feelingsy than jingoistic.

311
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,760
But I think that in and of itself is interesting,

312
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,760
because in 2010, it's like we'd already forgotten that intense jingoism

313
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,760
that immediately followed 9-11,

314
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,760
how people just lost their goddamn minds,

315
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,760
such to the point that invading Iraq sounded like a good idea.

316
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,760
See, John reenlists less out of a sense of duty or desire for retribution

317
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,760
than out of peer pressure,

318
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,760
and then again because his girlfriend dumped him.

319
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,760
It barely touches on patriotism. It's all about feelings.

320
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,760
And then there's the coup de grace, the twee-est of the lot,

321
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,760
extremely loud and incredibly close.

322
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,760
It is the film that wanted to be the definitive 9-11 movie,

323
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,760
and it is so twee.

324
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:51,760
It's like a feature-length Decemberist song about 9-11.

325
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,760
If the sun were to explode, you wouldn't even know about it for eight minutes.

326
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,760
It's basically a fanfic of the famous photograph called The Falling Man.

327
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,760
This kid named Oscar believes that guy is his dad, and he's played by Tom Hanks,

328
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,760
and the film features a CGI recreation of Tom Hanks falling into the camera

329
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,760
with the World Trade Center falling on top of him.

330
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,760
Yeah, so Tom Hanks used to create, like, puzzles for this kid

331
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,760
to get him to go outside and engage with the world,

332
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,760
you know, like a proto-Pokemon Go, but then 9-11.

333
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,760
So post-tragedy, this kid comes to the conclusion

334
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,760
that his dad left him a mystery to solve for a reason,

335
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,760
and it turns out, no, no, he didn't.

336
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,760
It was just a random key he found, and it belonged to B.T. over here.

337
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,760
This film was based on the Jonathan Safran Foer book of the same name,

338
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:49,760
and his premise was based on his supposition that 9-11 turned us into a nation of children,

339
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,760
and yeah, there is something to that.

340
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,760
Again, we were all lost and traumatized and searching for meaning,

341
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,760
but if we were a nation of children, it's not the innocent naivets

342
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,760
who cannot understand how such evil exists in the world like Oscar or Rizvan.

343
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,760
It'd be more like this.

344
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,760
Yalla!

345
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,760
Stop it!

346
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,760
Take me home!

347
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
No, I am the mother!

348
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,760
No, no, no!

349
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,760
The thing about Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close

350
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,760
is there was a good movie buried in here.

351
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,760
Like, it's the story of this kid who lost his dad in 9-11

352
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,760
and is trying to make sense of it, and there is no sense to be made,

353
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,760
and I really do like this scene where Sandra Bullock puts that into words.

354
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,760
I don't know why a man flew a plane to a building.

355
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,760
I don't know why my husband is dead.

356
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:39,760
But no matter how you try, Oscar, it's never gonna make sense because it doesn't.

357
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,760
It doesn't make sense.

358
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,760
I think there is a great story in the idea in this kid's search for meaning.

359
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,760
He learns that there isn't any, that 9-11 didn't happen for a reason,

360
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,760
and he learns to come to terms with that.

361
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,760
But, eh.

362
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,760
As New York-y as this wants to be, it's no 25th hour.

363
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,760
It feels kind of outsider's perspective.

364
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,760
Like My Name Is Khan, they're going for a sensitive portrayal of someone on the autism spectrum,

365
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,760
but it's so hollow and twee.

366
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,760
But the worst day made the list of things a lot longer.

367
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,760
What we see aren't characteristics, but a series of quirks.

368
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,760
Crying.

369
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,760
People with bad teeth.

370
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,760
Bags without owners.

371
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,760
Chews without owners.

372
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,760
Children without parents.

373
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,760
And extremely loud and incredibly close seem to mark

374
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,760
Hollywood's last-ditch attempt to mine 9-11 for Oscar Gold.

375
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,760
It's just not gonna happen anytime soon,

376
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:38,760
but I'm certain we will see a Titanic-style, sweeping, epic 9-11 romance in 70 years or so.

377
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:45,760
It's still hashtag too soon, but as soon as most of the people who remember it die off, it won't be.

378
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,760
Yay.

379
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,760
Media in recent years has drifted from the actual attack of 9-11 to the periphery,

380
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,760
namely the assassination of Osama bin Laden.

381
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,760
Zero Dark Thirty barely alludes to 9-11.

382
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:03,760
It's all about the hunt for bin Laden, which we seem to be more comfortable with now that he's, you know, dead.

383
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,760
Okay, so how do you know it's bin Laden?

384
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,760
Because the truth is we've been on this op before.

385
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,760
It was 07, and it wasn't bin Laden, and we lost a couple of guys.

386
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,760
This is Burt Macklin's greatest assignment yet.

387
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,760
And more recently, this thing of beauty.

388
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:24,760
She demanded that I fuck her like we fucked bin Laden. Fucked bin Laden. Fucked bin Laden.

389
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,760
She wanted to fuck me harder than the U.S. government. Fucked bin Laden.

390
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,760
I don't understand why this isn't the next I'm on a boat.

391
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
Hashtag too soon?

392
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,760
She said invade my cave with your special unit. I said he wasn't in a cave, but-

393
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:44,760
Although one of the weirder things I came across is that there's a 9-11 virtual reality game.

394
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,760
By the way, we have this mini-

395
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,760
Yikes.

396
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,760
As with most historical events, the further you get from it, the more it feels like fiction.

397
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,760
Like with Titanic, more than 1200 people died tragically,

398
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,760
but it wasn't weird making a sweeping fictionalized soap opera romance in 1997.

399
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,760
But we're still not there with 9-11. Thank god.

400
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,760
I don't know where we are, honestly.

401
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,760
I went to the 9-11 museum on Ground Zero in researching this episode.

402
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:30,760
I'd read from families of the victims that they didn't really like that the worst day of their lives was now a tourist attraction.

403
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:37,760
I'd heard also from personal friends that there was a trend of foreign tourists and teenagers too young to remember it

404
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,760
being loud inside the museum and using selfie sticks.

405
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,760
But I did not find that to be the case on the day that I went.

406
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:51,760
The truth is, I had kind of buried what those days and months after 9-11 were like.

407
00:23:51,760 --> 00:24:00,760
I went to the museum to research for an episode and ended up reliving 15 years of emotions that I didn't realize I had buried.

408
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:08,760
And that we as a culture haven't really processed, which I think in part might be why we are lashing out the way we are.

409
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:16,760
We may never fully process that collective trauma, so we just kind of bury it, and despite all evidence to the contrary, we act like we've moved on.

410
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:22,760
Negative and unexpected events are the most likely to trigger spontaneous attributional searches for meaning,

411
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,760
and I think we need to understand that about our culture.

412
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:31,760
And it's an important element in understanding why our media is the way it is when it is made.

413
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:37,760
That's why Spielberg made what was, in my opinion, the most successful 9-11 movie with War of the Worlds.

414
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,760
It was a pretty overt reference, but that was what it was going for.

415
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:48,760
Spielberg was intentionally trying to capture that terror, that confusion, that desire for retribution

416
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,760
We get back at them! We get back at them!

417
00:24:51,760 --> 00:25:00,760
That encapsulated that post-9-11 atmosphere, and that's why Man of Steel ended up being somewhat controversial for its similar use of 9-11 imagery.

418
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:06,760
And then in response to that controversy, ham-fistedly doubling down on his 9-11 parable and its sequel.

419
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:12,760
Some people responded to it positively, some thought it was disgusting and exploitative.

420
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,760
Hashtag too soon.

421
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,760
If you're going to appropriate collectively traumatic imagery, it had goddamn better well say something.

422
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,760
And that's another reason why the Marvel Cinematic Universe is overall less controversial.

423
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,760
Because its imagery isn't so overtly 9-11y as the DC Universe.

424
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,760
But all the same, it draws on real-world conflicts.

425
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,760
Lots of battles that are meant to echo real-world sentiment,

426
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:41,760
but Captain America has never, for instance, gone up against Islamic extremists, or even Nazis for that matter.

427
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,760
Just fake Nazis.

428
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,760
No one in the Marvel Universe ever claims a real-world religion as their motivation.

429
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:53,760
It mirrors our world, but not too much. Not uncomfortably so.

430
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,760
There's a catharsis for a thing without actually talking about the thing.

431
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,760
Even in Iron Man, while the trouble starts in Afghanistan and Tony spends plenty of time terror-assing over there,

432
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,760
none of the terrorists' motives seem to be based in some perceived holy war.

433
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,760
They speak Arabic, Urdu, Dari, Pashto, Mongolian, Farsi, Russian.

434
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,760
See? Hey, these guys are from all over the place and totally not Saudi Arabia.

435
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,760
It's more palatable to an audience to deal with this indirectly than directly.

436
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:29,760
That's why Bollywood prefers 9-11 to 26-11, and why Hollywood uses evocative imagery rather than the direct subject of 9-11.

437
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,760
Because when they do, it tends to suck.

438
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:40,760
And from a personal recommendation standpoint, I recommend that everybody reads The Looming Tower by Lawrence Wright.

439
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:45,760
It won the Pulitzer in 2006. It goes into great depth about why Al-Qaeda is the way it is.

440
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,760
There is one connective theme here, and that is the desire to make sense of what happened.

441
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,760
It's why some people have decided that it was actually a part of a vast conspiracy,

442
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:02,760
rather than the fact that, yes, 11 guys armed with box cutters were really able to hijack these planes and change the course of world history.

443
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:08,760
And there is no one answer for that, nor really any satisfying conclusion to come to,

444
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,760
because the subject is in itself so complex and all-encompassing.

445
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,760
We all have our own conclusions.
