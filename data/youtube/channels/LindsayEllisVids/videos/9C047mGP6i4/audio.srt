00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
Okay, so this week we are going to do a mini-canon for characters who don't have very many iterations

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:13,720
But have been revamped nonetheless. I was originally going to launch these mini-sodes later this year for certain, you know, movie event

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,520
Corporate, you know, interest vertical integration type things

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,940
But I think like most people in the last few weeks who saw Mad Max Fury Road

5
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:31,720
Loved Mad Max Fury Road more than I or probably anyone expected to so we're going to talk about the many

6
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,220
portrayals of

7
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,220
Mad Max all two of them

8
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:43,060
Mad Max is one of those franchises that most of us absorbed through cultural osmosis or late-night cable reruns

9
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:48,060
But they were highly influential not on the ubiquitous level of say an Indiana Jones movie

10
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,100
But the Mad Max movies were big precursors to high testosterone

11
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:58,780
Late 80s and early 90s actioneers like Die Hard though Max himself is more of a subdued antihero type

12
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,580
Neither muscly nor obtrusive Max

13
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:09,300
Rokitansky is a much more withdrawn sort getting forced into communities and stories that are not his own but shit needs to get done

14
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:17,180
So hey Mad Max is in town four movies and two different versions the original that made Mel Gibson famous and the 2015

15
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,980
Revisitation starring

16
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,420
Masculificent grunt machine Tom Hardy for Mad Max the canon is a lot more

17
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,380
You know loose than we're used to seeing in other franchises continuity kind of being an afterthought

18
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,200
Are the Mad Max movies officially in the same continuity? Well?

19
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,700
Mad Max is basically a feature-length act one

20
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,320
Civilization in Australia is not doing so hot though. It hasn't exactly crumbled either

21
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,280
We still have infrastructure and a police force and biker gangs are flourishing, but you know

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,640
Civilization still stands Max and his partner goose are cops trying to get to the police station

23
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,320
While the name Max Rokitansky has a sort of John McUnconvincing name vibe to it

24
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:15,320
He's actually named after Baron Karl von Rokitansky a bohemian pathologist and likely nod to the director George Miller's time as an ER doctor

25
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,800
Max is one of those archetypal best at what he does type

26
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
You're a winner Max

27
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
You're on the top shelf

28
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,600
He's good at shooting and better at driving and in the wake of the deteriorating

29
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,920
state of things here in almost post-apocalyptic Australia

30
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,120
He's beginning to fear his darker side, especially after his partner goose gets killed

31
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,920
Look any longer out on that road, and I'm one of them, you know a terminal crazy

32
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,920
Only I got a bronze badge to say I'm one of the good guys

33
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,920
So does Max get mad?

34
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,920
Nope, he goes on vacation

35
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,920
Seriously, he is on vacay for a

36
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,920
Shockingly huge chunk of this movie

37
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,240
If you've seen Fury Road or any of the other two

38
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,240
You know what's about to happen to the wifey and the baby

39
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,240
And the preamble to a wifey getting fridged

40
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,240
Which in turn is the catalyst for Max getting mad

41
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,240
Is most of the movie

42
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,240
Max doesn't really get mad until the last 20 minutes

43
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,240
When the baby gets killed and the wife gets

44
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,240
Maybe killed

45
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,240
We actually never find out if she lives or not

46
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,240
Max goes on his vengeful rampage

47
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,240
And then the movie ends

48
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,240
And then the movie ends

49
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,240
And then the movie ends

50
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,240
And then the movie ends

51
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,560
Budget being what it was

52
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,560
Max is nowhere near as effective

53
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,560
At exacting revenge as he would be

54
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,560
In later entries

55
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,560
He gets shot in the leg almost immediately during his rampage

56
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,560
And as a result has to wear a brace

57
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,560
That we see in all three of the other movies

58
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,560
Even the exceptionally

59
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,560
Continually wonky Fury Road

60
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,560
But given that Max is now mad

61
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,560
And exacting revenge on these biker gangs

62
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,560
Is he supposed to be the hero?

63
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,560
Or even an anti-hero?

64
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,560
George Miller was not a very experienced filmmaker in 1979

65
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,880
Which comes across with issues of pacing

66
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,880
And structure

67
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,880
And the simple cliche interactions of the characters

68
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,880
Especially between Max and his wife

69
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,880
Plus the budget was basically non-existent

70
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,880
But he already had a good grasp

71
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,880
On theme and character

72
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,880
You're mad, bitch

73
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,880
You think I look silly, don't you?

74
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,880
Max's turn to the dark side

75
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,880
Such as it were was a sort of unsympathetic turn

76
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,880
You could get away with in the 70s

77
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,880
Especially for an independent Australian film

78
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,880
That accidentally made a lot of money here in the States

79
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
The audience not knowing whether or not Max's wife survives

80
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,200
Is in a boo-boo on the part of the filmmaker

81
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,200
But it doesn't really matter

82
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,200
Max has by the end of the movie

83
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Basically given up on humanity

84
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,200
And his own humanity

85
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,200
Finishing the movie by roasting one of his enemies

86
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,200
Who is, by the way, helpless

87
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,200
And begging for mercy

88
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,200
And this is also like

89
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,200
A young kid who's a toady

90
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,200
Of the bad guy

91
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,200
And that's his arc

92
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Max isn't just mad, he's gone

93
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,520
But after that first movie

94
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,520
Max more hits his stride in becoming a player

95
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,520
In other people's stories

96
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,520
So for the people who complained about that aspect

97
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,520
Of Fury Road

98
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,520
I have to assume they aren't terribly familiar with this franchise

99
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,520
Mad Max The Road Warrior

100
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,520
Or Mad Max Hooray A Budget

101
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,520
Is where Max

102
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,520
The post-apocalyptic wandering loner

103
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,520
Gets set as his archetype

104
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,840
Max gets caught up with this peaceful-ish

105
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,840
Little community that has some gas

106
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,840
And then the bad guy, Lord Humongous

107
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,840
Yeah

108
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,840
He wants to kill them to get the gas

109
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,840
Max keeps doing these people favors

110
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,840
In exchange for stuff

111
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,840
People keep begging him to stick around

112
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,840
He keeps wanting to leave

113
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,840
And is forced to stay

114
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,840
He just wants his stuff

115
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,840
Stuff is a big theme in these movies

116
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,840
No wifey to get Fridge this time

117
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,840
But he does have a cute

118
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,160
Well-trained dog

119
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,160
And you can guess how that ends

120
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,160
Max defines himself

121
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,160
More in his relationship to his stuff

122
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,160
Than to other people

123
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,160
In Road Warrior he's all about gas

124
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,160
And then he's all about his car

125
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,160
Once he finally lets go of the stuff

126
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,160
He finds out that he'd been duped

127
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,160
By the very people he'd risked his life to help

128
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,160
Turns out that maybe Max was right

129
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,160
To want to go it alone

130
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,160
That was the last we ever saw of him

131
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,160
Stupid, disappointing other human beings

132
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,480
Thunderdome, how do I get in there?

133
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,480
That's easy, pick a fight

134
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,480
And now we get to the infamously bizarre

135
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,480
Beyond Thunderdome

136
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,480
Where once again, Max's primary motivation is

137
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,480
Stuff

138
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,480
It's a few more decades on after what appears to be

139
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,480
A worldwide nuclear war

140
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,480
Where in the last one it was his macho car driving

141
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,480
In this one it's his macho face punching

142
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,480
And not dying in the face of probably dying

143
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,480
Congratulations

144
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,480
You're the first to survive the audition

145
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,480
In looking for his stuff

146
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,480
Max falls in with the evil Tina Turner

147
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,480
And goes along with what she wants

148
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,480
Until he's basically punished for not being

149
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,480
A total monster and refusing to kill

150
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,480
A mentally disabled man

151
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,480
Before long he escapes, barely survives

152
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,480
And then gets thrust into

153
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,480
This lost boy's nightmare

154
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,480
Fly Walker, fly!

155
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,480
Fly Walker, fly!

156
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,480
Fly Walker, fly!

157
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,480
Fly Walker, fly!

158
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,480
And he's not thrilled to be here

159
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,480
But you know, whatever, they're kids

160
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,480
So while always with a mind

161
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,480
To get his stuff back, once again

162
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,480
He's reluctantly drawn into a sort of

163
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,480
Eh, I probably shouldn't let these children

164
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,480
Get killed situation

165
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,480
In the end, Max brings some misfits together

166
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,480
Sacrifices his own well-being for some of those kids

167
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,480
And while Thunderdome

168
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,480
Is the goofiest, it's also got the most

169
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,480
Complete arc for Max as a character

170
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,480
Of those first three movies

171
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,480
In that he actually does something somewhat selfless

172
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,480
And then doesn't regret it

173
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,480
But at the same time he ends up being alone

174
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,480
Now for a while this was

175
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,480
Supposed to be the last entry in the series

176
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,480
In part for that reason

177
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,480
But then 30 years later

178
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,480
Mad Max Fury Road

179
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,480
Is the hardest to pin down in terms of

180
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,480
Continuity. Max alludes to

181
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,480
Having been a cop at the very beginning

182
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,480
But it's pretty obvious that it's been at least

183
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,480
A couple generations since civilization fell

184
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,480
Max is now portrayed

185
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,480
By Pitbull-Elf hybrid Tom Hardy

186
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,480
And when we're first introduced to Max

187
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,480
He's haunted by memories and even

188
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,480
Hallucinations of people he could not save

189
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,480
And no, this doesn't

190
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,480
Appear to be a clear reference to any of the

191
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,480
Previous three movies. The most frequent

192
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Of these accusing dead is a little girl

193
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,480
And she's definitely not in the previous three

194
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,480
So is this his daughter?

195
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,480
Some kid? I don't know. There's several

196
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,480
Other characters who weren't really there in the previous three

197
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,480
Again, in terms of continuity

198
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,480
The thread seems to be

199
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,480
Don't worry about it

200
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,480
So is this the same Max?

201
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,480
Max in Fury Road is the lowest we've yet seen him

202
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,480
At the beginning of the film he's been alone

203
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,480
For so long he's almost forgotten how to speak

204
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,480
Horribly traumatized and suffering from

205
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,480
Intense post-traumatic stress

206
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,480
Where Gibson's Max was controlled

207
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,480
Calculating Hardy's Max can

208
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,480
Barely keep it together

209
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,480
Part of what makes Fury Road so compelling

210
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,480
Compared to the other three is the thing that's being

211
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,480
Fought over is not stuff

212
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,480
Like gas and cars

213
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,480
But personhood. For the first half hour

214
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,480
Not only is Max stripped of all of his stuff

215
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,480
But also of all agency

216
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,480
Strapped to the front of a car as a blood bank

217
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,480
For the war boy Nux under the belief

218
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
That this will make his blood more

219
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,480
Adrenaline-y

220
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,480
I mean

221
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,480
He is pissed about the whole ordeal but

222
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,480
Mostly he's mad that they took his stuff

223
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,480
Namely his car and his blood

224
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,480
But as far as the plot proper

225
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,480
Max is not motivated by stuff ever

226
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,480
As in the previous two

227
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,480
But like Furiosa and the wives, by survival

228
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,480
And the movie wastes very little time

229
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,480
Getting our heroes to get over themselves

230
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,480
And work together because it's just the logical thing to do

231
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,480
Because the world is harsh and awful

232
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,480
And really hard to survive in

233
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,480
But when they work together, dammit, they don't waste any time

234
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,480
Being surprised at the abilities of the other

235
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,480
It's just like, oh, you can do the thing

236
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,480
Good, do the thing

237
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,480
That is surprisingly rare with

238
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,480
Male and female co-leads

239
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,480
Almost immediately after Max escapes

240
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,480
Captivity he gets the shit kicked out of him by a one-armed woman

241
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,480
But there's never any

242
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,480
Egotistical butthurt about it

243
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,480
And that does set him apart from most action movie heroes

244
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,480
He doesn't need to reassert his masculinity

245
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,480
There's just no time for that

246
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,480
But the real brilliance of Fury Road

247
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,480
Is the way it thematically examines

248
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,480
Its own predecessors

249
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,480
Especially in regards to characters

250
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,480
Being motivated by stuff

251
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,480
In Fury Road, the stuff is people

252
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,480
That's my child!

253
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,480
I want them back!

254
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,480
They're my property!

255
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,480
Human objectification is a huge theme

256
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,480
The wives are Joe's property

257
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,480
The war boys are Joe's disposable war fodder

258
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,480
Their unborn children are Joe's property

259
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,480
And Max himself, basically an organ and blood donor

260
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,480
Is also property

261
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,480
So while Fury Road is awesome and fun as hell to watch

262
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,480
It's also a fascinating re-examination

263
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,480
On the themes of the previous three

264
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,480
Max was never an ideal

265
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,480
More of a fall-from-grace sort

266
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,480
Than an honest-to-god anti-hero

267
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,480
Maybe in the third one, but yeah

268
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,480
But the first three films are more thematically complex

269
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,480
Than idealizing Max's either running away

270
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,480
Or violence-is-the-solution-to-everything

271
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,480
Approach to masculinity

272
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,480
I don't think it's any coincidence

273
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,480
That Nux bears a strong narrative resemblance

274
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,480
To the young brainwashed Johnny

275
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,480
Who Max killed in Cold Blood in the first movie

276
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,480
Modern Max has zero interest in vengeance

277
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,480
Or even comeuppance

278
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,480
Just survival

279
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,480
And as a result, we have the highest stakes

280
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,480
We've ever seen in a Mad Max movie

281
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,480
And of course we're talking about sequels

282
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,480
And honestly, I

283
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,480
I don't

284
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,480
I don't know how they're going to follow this one

285
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,480
As it was very complete

286
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,480
But hey

287
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,480
If we can go from here

288
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,480
Here to here

289
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,480
In thirty years, who knows

290
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,480
We will be back next week

291
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,480
With a real full episode of The Loose Cannon

292
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,480
Which is death

293
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,480
And it's coming, I promise

294
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,480
Hang in there, thanks for watching

295
