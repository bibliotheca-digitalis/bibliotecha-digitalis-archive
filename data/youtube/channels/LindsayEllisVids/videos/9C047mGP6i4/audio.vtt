WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.440
Okay, so this week we are going to do a mini-canon for characters who don't have very many iterations

00:06.440 --> 00:13.720
But have been revamped nonetheless. I was originally going to launch these mini-sodes later this year for certain, you know, movie event

00:14.360 --> 00:17.520
Corporate, you know, interest vertical integration type things

00:17.960 --> 00:23.940
But I think like most people in the last few weeks who saw Mad Max Fury Road

00:24.340 --> 00:31.720
Loved Mad Max Fury Road more than I or probably anyone expected to so we're going to talk about the many

00:31.940 --> 00:33.220
portrayals of

00:33.220 --> 00:36.220
Mad Max all two of them

00:37.420 --> 00:43.060
Mad Max is one of those franchises that most of us absorbed through cultural osmosis or late-night cable reruns

00:43.060 --> 00:48.060
But they were highly influential not on the ubiquitous level of say an Indiana Jones movie

00:48.060 --> 00:51.100
But the Mad Max movies were big precursors to high testosterone

00:51.540 --> 00:58.780
Late 80s and early 90s actioneers like Die Hard though Max himself is more of a subdued antihero type

00:59.140 --> 01:01.580
Neither muscly nor obtrusive Max

01:02.340 --> 01:09.300
Rokitansky is a much more withdrawn sort getting forced into communities and stories that are not his own but shit needs to get done

01:09.300 --> 01:17.180
So hey Mad Max is in town four movies and two different versions the original that made Mel Gibson famous and the 2015

01:18.180 --> 01:19.980
Revisitation starring

01:19.980 --> 01:24.420
Masculificent grunt machine Tom Hardy for Mad Max the canon is a lot more

01:24.420 --> 01:28.380
You know loose than we're used to seeing in other franchises continuity kind of being an afterthought

01:28.500 --> 01:32.200
Are the Mad Max movies officially in the same continuity? Well?

01:32.200 --> 01:35.700
Mad Max is basically a feature-length act one

01:44.760 --> 01:49.320
Civilization in Australia is not doing so hot though. It hasn't exactly crumbled either

01:49.320 --> 01:54.280
We still have infrastructure and a police force and biker gangs are flourishing, but you know

01:55.000 --> 01:59.640
Civilization still stands Max and his partner goose are cops trying to get to the police station

02:00.200 --> 02:06.320
While the name Max Rokitansky has a sort of John McUnconvincing name vibe to it

02:06.320 --> 02:15.320
He's actually named after Baron Karl von Rokitansky a bohemian pathologist and likely nod to the director George Miller's time as an ER doctor

02:15.320 --> 02:18.800
Max is one of those archetypal best at what he does type

02:18.800 --> 02:20.800
You're a winner Max

02:20.800 --> 02:22.800
You're on the top shelf

02:22.800 --> 02:26.600
He's good at shooting and better at driving and in the wake of the deteriorating

02:26.600 --> 02:29.920
state of things here in almost post-apocalyptic Australia

02:29.920 --> 02:34.120
He's beginning to fear his darker side, especially after his partner goose gets killed

02:34.120 --> 02:38.920
Look any longer out on that road, and I'm one of them, you know a terminal crazy

02:38.920 --> 02:42.920
Only I got a bronze badge to say I'm one of the good guys

02:42.920 --> 02:44.920
So does Max get mad?

02:44.920 --> 02:46.920
Nope, he goes on vacation

02:47.920 --> 02:49.920
Seriously, he is on vacay for a

02:50.920 --> 02:52.920
Shockingly huge chunk of this movie

02:53.240 --> 02:55.240
If you've seen Fury Road or any of the other two

02:55.240 --> 02:57.240
You know what's about to happen to the wifey and the baby

02:57.240 --> 02:59.240
And the preamble to a wifey getting fridged

02:59.240 --> 03:01.240
Which in turn is the catalyst for Max getting mad

03:01.240 --> 03:03.240
Is most of the movie

03:03.240 --> 03:05.240
Max doesn't really get mad until the last 20 minutes

03:05.240 --> 03:07.240
When the baby gets killed and the wife gets

03:07.240 --> 03:09.240
Maybe killed

03:09.240 --> 03:11.240
We actually never find out if she lives or not

03:11.240 --> 03:13.240
Max goes on his vengeful rampage

03:13.240 --> 03:15.240
And then the movie ends

03:15.240 --> 03:17.240
And then the movie ends

03:17.240 --> 03:19.240
And then the movie ends

03:19.240 --> 03:21.240
And then the movie ends

03:21.560 --> 03:23.560
Budget being what it was

03:23.560 --> 03:25.560
Max is nowhere near as effective

03:25.560 --> 03:27.560
At exacting revenge as he would be

03:27.560 --> 03:29.560
In later entries

03:29.560 --> 03:31.560
He gets shot in the leg almost immediately during his rampage

03:31.560 --> 03:33.560
And as a result has to wear a brace

03:33.560 --> 03:35.560
That we see in all three of the other movies

03:35.560 --> 03:37.560
Even the exceptionally

03:37.560 --> 03:39.560
Continually wonky Fury Road

03:39.560 --> 03:41.560
But given that Max is now mad

03:41.560 --> 03:43.560
And exacting revenge on these biker gangs

03:43.560 --> 03:45.560
Is he supposed to be the hero?

03:45.560 --> 03:47.560
Or even an anti-hero?

03:47.560 --> 03:49.560
George Miller was not a very experienced filmmaker in 1979

03:49.880 --> 03:51.880
Which comes across with issues of pacing

03:51.880 --> 03:53.880
And structure

03:53.880 --> 03:55.880
And the simple cliche interactions of the characters

03:55.880 --> 03:57.880
Especially between Max and his wife

03:57.880 --> 03:59.880
Plus the budget was basically non-existent

03:59.880 --> 04:01.880
But he already had a good grasp

04:01.880 --> 04:03.880
On theme and character

04:03.880 --> 04:05.880
You're mad, bitch

04:05.880 --> 04:07.880
You think I look silly, don't you?

04:07.880 --> 04:09.880
Max's turn to the dark side

04:09.880 --> 04:11.880
Such as it were was a sort of unsympathetic turn

04:11.880 --> 04:13.880
You could get away with in the 70s

04:13.880 --> 04:15.880
Especially for an independent Australian film

04:15.880 --> 04:17.880
That accidentally made a lot of money here in the States

04:18.200 --> 04:20.200
The audience not knowing whether or not Max's wife survives

04:20.200 --> 04:22.200
Is in a boo-boo on the part of the filmmaker

04:22.200 --> 04:24.200
But it doesn't really matter

04:24.200 --> 04:26.200
Max has by the end of the movie

04:26.200 --> 04:28.200
Basically given up on humanity

04:28.200 --> 04:30.200
And his own humanity

04:30.200 --> 04:32.200
Finishing the movie by roasting one of his enemies

04:32.200 --> 04:34.200
Who is, by the way, helpless

04:34.200 --> 04:36.200
And begging for mercy

04:36.200 --> 04:38.200
And this is also like

04:38.200 --> 04:40.200
A young kid who's a toady

04:40.200 --> 04:42.200
Of the bad guy

04:42.200 --> 04:44.200
And that's his arc

04:44.200 --> 04:46.200
Max isn't just mad, he's gone

04:46.520 --> 04:48.520
But after that first movie

04:48.520 --> 04:50.520
Max more hits his stride in becoming a player

04:50.520 --> 04:52.520
In other people's stories

04:52.520 --> 04:54.520
So for the people who complained about that aspect

04:54.520 --> 04:56.520
Of Fury Road

04:56.520 --> 04:58.520
I have to assume they aren't terribly familiar with this franchise

05:04.520 --> 05:06.520
Mad Max The Road Warrior

05:06.520 --> 05:08.520
Or Mad Max Hooray A Budget

05:08.520 --> 05:10.520
Is where Max

05:10.520 --> 05:12.520
The post-apocalyptic wandering loner

05:12.520 --> 05:14.520
Gets set as his archetype

05:14.840 --> 05:16.840
Max gets caught up with this peaceful-ish

05:16.840 --> 05:18.840
Little community that has some gas

05:18.840 --> 05:20.840
And then the bad guy, Lord Humongous

05:20.840 --> 05:22.840
Yeah

05:22.840 --> 05:24.840
He wants to kill them to get the gas

05:24.840 --> 05:26.840
Max keeps doing these people favors

05:26.840 --> 05:28.840
In exchange for stuff

05:28.840 --> 05:30.840
People keep begging him to stick around

05:30.840 --> 05:32.840
He keeps wanting to leave

05:32.840 --> 05:34.840
And is forced to stay

05:34.840 --> 05:36.840
He just wants his stuff

05:36.840 --> 05:38.840
Stuff is a big theme in these movies

05:38.840 --> 05:40.840
No wifey to get Fridge this time

05:40.840 --> 05:42.840
But he does have a cute

05:43.160 --> 05:45.160
Well-trained dog

05:45.160 --> 05:47.160
And you can guess how that ends

05:47.160 --> 05:49.160
Max defines himself

05:49.160 --> 05:51.160
More in his relationship to his stuff

05:51.160 --> 05:53.160
Than to other people

05:53.160 --> 05:55.160
In Road Warrior he's all about gas

05:55.160 --> 05:57.160
And then he's all about his car

05:57.160 --> 05:59.160
Once he finally lets go of the stuff

05:59.160 --> 06:01.160
He finds out that he'd been duped

06:01.160 --> 06:03.160
By the very people he'd risked his life to help

06:03.160 --> 06:05.160
Turns out that maybe Max was right

06:05.160 --> 06:07.160
To want to go it alone

06:07.160 --> 06:09.160
That was the last we ever saw of him

06:09.160 --> 06:11.160
Stupid, disappointing other human beings

06:11.480 --> 06:13.480
Thunderdome, how do I get in there?

06:13.480 --> 06:15.480
That's easy, pick a fight

06:15.480 --> 06:17.480
And now we get to the infamously bizarre

06:17.480 --> 06:19.480
Beyond Thunderdome

06:19.480 --> 06:21.480
Where once again, Max's primary motivation is

06:21.480 --> 06:23.480
Stuff

06:23.480 --> 06:25.480
It's a few more decades on after what appears to be

06:25.480 --> 06:27.480
A worldwide nuclear war

06:27.480 --> 06:29.480
Where in the last one it was his macho car driving

06:29.480 --> 06:31.480
In this one it's his macho face punching

06:31.480 --> 06:33.480
And not dying in the face of probably dying

06:33.480 --> 06:35.480
Congratulations

06:35.480 --> 06:37.480
You're the first to survive the audition

06:37.480 --> 06:39.480
In looking for his stuff

06:39.480 --> 06:41.480
Max falls in with the evil Tina Turner

06:41.480 --> 06:43.480
And goes along with what she wants

06:43.480 --> 06:45.480
Until he's basically punished for not being

06:45.480 --> 06:47.480
A total monster and refusing to kill

06:47.480 --> 06:49.480
A mentally disabled man

06:49.480 --> 06:51.480
Before long he escapes, barely survives

06:51.480 --> 06:53.480
And then gets thrust into

06:53.480 --> 06:55.480
This lost boy's nightmare

06:55.480 --> 06:57.480
Fly Walker, fly!

06:57.480 --> 06:59.480
Fly Walker, fly!

06:59.480 --> 07:01.480
Fly Walker, fly!

07:01.480 --> 07:03.480
Fly Walker, fly!

07:03.480 --> 07:05.480
And he's not thrilled to be here

07:05.480 --> 07:07.480
But you know, whatever, they're kids

07:07.480 --> 07:09.480
So while always with a mind

07:09.480 --> 07:11.480
To get his stuff back, once again

07:11.480 --> 07:13.480
He's reluctantly drawn into a sort of

07:13.480 --> 07:15.480
Eh, I probably shouldn't let these children

07:15.480 --> 07:17.480
Get killed situation

07:17.480 --> 07:19.480
In the end, Max brings some misfits together

07:19.480 --> 07:21.480
Sacrifices his own well-being for some of those kids

07:21.480 --> 07:23.480
And while Thunderdome

07:23.480 --> 07:25.480
Is the goofiest, it's also got the most

07:25.480 --> 07:27.480
Complete arc for Max as a character

07:27.480 --> 07:29.480
Of those first three movies

07:29.480 --> 07:31.480
In that he actually does something somewhat selfless

07:31.480 --> 07:33.480
And then doesn't regret it

07:33.480 --> 07:35.480
But at the same time he ends up being alone

07:35.480 --> 07:37.480
Now for a while this was

07:37.480 --> 07:39.480
Supposed to be the last entry in the series

07:39.480 --> 07:41.480
In part for that reason

07:41.480 --> 07:43.480
But then 30 years later

07:51.480 --> 07:53.480
Mad Max Fury Road

07:53.480 --> 07:55.480
Is the hardest to pin down in terms of

07:55.480 --> 07:57.480
Continuity. Max alludes to

07:57.480 --> 07:59.480
Having been a cop at the very beginning

07:59.480 --> 08:01.480
But it's pretty obvious that it's been at least

08:01.480 --> 08:03.480
A couple generations since civilization fell

08:03.480 --> 08:05.480
Max is now portrayed

08:05.480 --> 08:07.480
By Pitbull-Elf hybrid Tom Hardy

08:07.480 --> 08:09.480
And when we're first introduced to Max

08:09.480 --> 08:11.480
He's haunted by memories and even

08:11.480 --> 08:13.480
Hallucinations of people he could not save

08:13.480 --> 08:15.480
And no, this doesn't

08:15.480 --> 08:17.480
Appear to be a clear reference to any of the

08:17.480 --> 08:19.480
Previous three movies. The most frequent

08:19.480 --> 08:21.480
Of these accusing dead is a little girl

08:21.480 --> 08:23.480
And she's definitely not in the previous three

08:23.480 --> 08:25.480
So is this his daughter?

08:25.480 --> 08:27.480
Some kid? I don't know. There's several

08:27.480 --> 08:29.480
Other characters who weren't really there in the previous three

08:29.480 --> 08:31.480
Again, in terms of continuity

08:31.480 --> 08:33.480
The thread seems to be

08:35.480 --> 08:37.480
Don't worry about it

08:37.480 --> 08:39.480
So is this the same Max?

08:49.480 --> 08:51.480
Max in Fury Road is the lowest we've yet seen him

08:51.480 --> 08:53.480
At the beginning of the film he's been alone

08:53.480 --> 08:55.480
For so long he's almost forgotten how to speak

08:55.480 --> 08:57.480
Horribly traumatized and suffering from

08:57.480 --> 08:59.480
Intense post-traumatic stress

08:59.480 --> 09:01.480
Where Gibson's Max was controlled

09:01.480 --> 09:03.480
Calculating Hardy's Max can

09:03.480 --> 09:05.480
Barely keep it together

09:05.480 --> 09:07.480
Part of what makes Fury Road so compelling

09:07.480 --> 09:09.480
Compared to the other three is the thing that's being

09:09.480 --> 09:11.480
Fought over is not stuff

09:11.480 --> 09:13.480
Like gas and cars

09:13.480 --> 09:15.480
But personhood. For the first half hour

09:15.480 --> 09:17.480
Not only is Max stripped of all of his stuff

09:17.480 --> 09:19.480
But also of all agency

09:19.480 --> 09:21.480
Strapped to the front of a car as a blood bank

09:21.480 --> 09:23.480
For the war boy Nux under the belief

09:23.480 --> 09:25.480
That this will make his blood more

09:25.480 --> 09:27.480
Adrenaline-y

09:27.480 --> 09:29.480
I mean

09:29.480 --> 09:31.480
He is pissed about the whole ordeal but

09:33.480 --> 09:35.480
Mostly he's mad that they took his stuff

09:35.480 --> 09:37.480
Namely his car and his blood

09:37.480 --> 09:39.480
But as far as the plot proper

09:39.480 --> 09:41.480
Max is not motivated by stuff ever

09:41.480 --> 09:43.480
As in the previous two

09:43.480 --> 09:45.480
But like Furiosa and the wives, by survival

09:45.480 --> 09:47.480
And the movie wastes very little time

09:47.480 --> 09:49.480
Getting our heroes to get over themselves

09:49.480 --> 09:51.480
And work together because it's just the logical thing to do

09:51.480 --> 09:53.480
Because the world is harsh and awful

09:53.480 --> 09:55.480
And really hard to survive in

09:55.480 --> 09:57.480
But when they work together, dammit, they don't waste any time

09:57.480 --> 09:59.480
Being surprised at the abilities of the other

09:59.480 --> 10:01.480
It's just like, oh, you can do the thing

10:01.480 --> 10:03.480
Good, do the thing

10:03.480 --> 10:05.480
That is surprisingly rare with

10:05.480 --> 10:07.480
Male and female co-leads

10:07.480 --> 10:09.480
Almost immediately after Max escapes

10:09.480 --> 10:11.480
Captivity he gets the shit kicked out of him by a one-armed woman

10:11.480 --> 10:13.480
But there's never any

10:13.480 --> 10:15.480
Egotistical butthurt about it

10:15.480 --> 10:17.480
And that does set him apart from most action movie heroes

10:17.480 --> 10:19.480
He doesn't need to reassert his masculinity

10:19.480 --> 10:21.480
There's just no time for that

10:21.480 --> 10:23.480
But the real brilliance of Fury Road

10:23.480 --> 10:25.480
Is the way it thematically examines

10:25.480 --> 10:27.480
Its own predecessors

10:27.480 --> 10:29.480
Especially in regards to characters

10:29.480 --> 10:31.480
Being motivated by stuff

10:31.480 --> 10:33.480
In Fury Road, the stuff is people

10:33.480 --> 10:35.480
That's my child!

10:35.480 --> 10:37.480
I want them back!

10:37.480 --> 10:39.480
They're my property!

10:39.480 --> 10:41.480
Human objectification is a huge theme

10:41.480 --> 10:43.480
The wives are Joe's property

10:43.480 --> 10:45.480
The war boys are Joe's disposable war fodder

10:45.480 --> 10:47.480
Their unborn children are Joe's property

10:47.480 --> 10:49.480
And Max himself, basically an organ and blood donor

10:49.480 --> 10:51.480
Is also property

10:51.480 --> 10:53.480
So while Fury Road is awesome and fun as hell to watch

10:53.480 --> 10:55.480
It's also a fascinating re-examination

10:55.480 --> 10:57.480
On the themes of the previous three

10:57.480 --> 10:59.480
Max was never an ideal

10:59.480 --> 11:01.480
More of a fall-from-grace sort

11:01.480 --> 11:03.480
Than an honest-to-god anti-hero

11:03.480 --> 11:05.480
Maybe in the third one, but yeah

11:05.480 --> 11:07.480
But the first three films are more thematically complex

11:07.480 --> 11:09.480
Than idealizing Max's either running away

11:09.480 --> 11:11.480
Or violence-is-the-solution-to-everything

11:11.480 --> 11:13.480
Approach to masculinity

11:13.480 --> 11:15.480
I don't think it's any coincidence

11:15.480 --> 11:17.480
That Nux bears a strong narrative resemblance

11:17.480 --> 11:19.480
To the young brainwashed Johnny

11:19.480 --> 11:21.480
Who Max killed in Cold Blood in the first movie

11:21.480 --> 11:23.480
Modern Max has zero interest in vengeance

11:23.480 --> 11:25.480
Or even comeuppance

11:25.480 --> 11:27.480
Just survival

11:27.480 --> 11:29.480
And as a result, we have the highest stakes

11:29.480 --> 11:31.480
We've ever seen in a Mad Max movie

11:31.480 --> 11:33.480
And of course we're talking about sequels

11:33.480 --> 11:35.480
And honestly, I

11:35.480 --> 11:37.480
I don't

11:37.480 --> 11:39.480
I don't know how they're going to follow this one

11:39.480 --> 11:41.480
As it was very complete

11:41.480 --> 11:43.480
But hey

11:43.480 --> 11:45.480
If we can go from here

11:45.480 --> 11:47.480
Here to here

11:47.480 --> 11:49.480
In thirty years, who knows

11:49.480 --> 11:51.480
We will be back next week

11:51.480 --> 11:53.480
With a real full episode of The Loose Cannon

11:53.480 --> 11:55.480
Which is death

11:55.480 --> 11:57.480
And it's coming, I promise

11:57.480 --> 11:59.480
Hang in there, thanks for watching

11:59.480 --> 12:01.480
Patreon, Twitter

12:01.480 --> 12:03.480
Go see Mad Max Fury Road, you'll love it

12:03.480 --> 12:05.480
And if you don't
