0	6440	Okay, so this week we are going to do a mini-canon for characters who don't have very many iterations
6440	13720	But have been revamped nonetheless. I was originally going to launch these mini-sodes later this year for certain, you know, movie event
14360	17520	Corporate, you know, interest vertical integration type things
17960	23940	But I think like most people in the last few weeks who saw Mad Max Fury Road
24340	31720	Loved Mad Max Fury Road more than I or probably anyone expected to so we're going to talk about the many
31940	33220	portrayals of
33220	36220	Mad Max all two of them
37420	43060	Mad Max is one of those franchises that most of us absorbed through cultural osmosis or late-night cable reruns
43060	48060	But they were highly influential not on the ubiquitous level of say an Indiana Jones movie
48060	51100	But the Mad Max movies were big precursors to high testosterone
51540	58780	Late 80s and early 90s actioneers like Die Hard though Max himself is more of a subdued antihero type
59140	61580	Neither muscly nor obtrusive Max
62340	69300	Rokitansky is a much more withdrawn sort getting forced into communities and stories that are not his own but shit needs to get done
69300	77180	So hey Mad Max is in town four movies and two different versions the original that made Mel Gibson famous and the 2015
78180	79980	Revisitation starring
79980	84420	Masculificent grunt machine Tom Hardy for Mad Max the canon is a lot more
84420	88380	You know loose than we're used to seeing in other franchises continuity kind of being an afterthought
88500	92200	Are the Mad Max movies officially in the same continuity? Well?
92200	95700	Mad Max is basically a feature-length act one
104760	109320	Civilization in Australia is not doing so hot though. It hasn't exactly crumbled either
109320	114280	We still have infrastructure and a police force and biker gangs are flourishing, but you know
115000	119640	Civilization still stands Max and his partner goose are cops trying to get to the police station
120200	126320	While the name Max Rokitansky has a sort of John McUnconvincing name vibe to it
126320	135320	He's actually named after Baron Karl von Rokitansky a bohemian pathologist and likely nod to the director George Miller's time as an ER doctor
135320	138800	Max is one of those archetypal best at what he does type
138800	140800	You're a winner Max
140800	142800	You're on the top shelf
142800	146600	He's good at shooting and better at driving and in the wake of the deteriorating
146600	149920	state of things here in almost post-apocalyptic Australia
149920	154120	He's beginning to fear his darker side, especially after his partner goose gets killed
154120	158920	Look any longer out on that road, and I'm one of them, you know a terminal crazy
158920	162920	Only I got a bronze badge to say I'm one of the good guys
162920	164920	So does Max get mad?
164920	166920	Nope, he goes on vacation
167920	169920	Seriously, he is on vacay for a
170920	172920	Shockingly huge chunk of this movie
173240	175240	If you've seen Fury Road or any of the other two
175240	177240	You know what's about to happen to the wifey and the baby
177240	179240	And the preamble to a wifey getting fridged
179240	181240	Which in turn is the catalyst for Max getting mad
181240	183240	Is most of the movie
183240	185240	Max doesn't really get mad until the last 20 minutes
185240	187240	When the baby gets killed and the wife gets
187240	189240	Maybe killed
189240	191240	We actually never find out if she lives or not
191240	193240	Max goes on his vengeful rampage
193240	195240	And then the movie ends
195240	197240	And then the movie ends
197240	199240	And then the movie ends
199240	201240	And then the movie ends
201560	203560	Budget being what it was
203560	205560	Max is nowhere near as effective
205560	207560	At exacting revenge as he would be
207560	209560	In later entries
209560	211560	He gets shot in the leg almost immediately during his rampage
211560	213560	And as a result has to wear a brace
213560	215560	That we see in all three of the other movies
215560	217560	Even the exceptionally
217560	219560	Continually wonky Fury Road
219560	221560	But given that Max is now mad
221560	223560	And exacting revenge on these biker gangs
223560	225560	Is he supposed to be the hero?
225560	227560	Or even an anti-hero?
227560	229560	George Miller was not a very experienced filmmaker in 1979
229880	231880	Which comes across with issues of pacing
231880	233880	And structure
233880	235880	And the simple cliche interactions of the characters
235880	237880	Especially between Max and his wife
237880	239880	Plus the budget was basically non-existent
239880	241880	But he already had a good grasp
241880	243880	On theme and character
243880	245880	You're mad, bitch
245880	247880	You think I look silly, don't you?
247880	249880	Max's turn to the dark side
249880	251880	Such as it were was a sort of unsympathetic turn
251880	253880	You could get away with in the 70s
253880	255880	Especially for an independent Australian film
255880	257880	That accidentally made a lot of money here in the States
258200	260200	The audience not knowing whether or not Max's wife survives
260200	262200	Is in a boo-boo on the part of the filmmaker
262200	264200	But it doesn't really matter
264200	266200	Max has by the end of the movie
266200	268200	Basically given up on humanity
268200	270200	And his own humanity
270200	272200	Finishing the movie by roasting one of his enemies
272200	274200	Who is, by the way, helpless
274200	276200	And begging for mercy
276200	278200	And this is also like
278200	280200	A young kid who's a toady
280200	282200	Of the bad guy
282200	284200	And that's his arc
284200	286200	Max isn't just mad, he's gone
286520	288520	But after that first movie
288520	290520	Max more hits his stride in becoming a player
290520	292520	In other people's stories
292520	294520	So for the people who complained about that aspect
294520	296520	Of Fury Road
296520	298520	I have to assume they aren't terribly familiar with this franchise
304520	306520	Mad Max The Road Warrior
306520	308520	Or Mad Max Hooray A Budget
308520	310520	Is where Max
310520	312520	The post-apocalyptic wandering loner
312520	314520	Gets set as his archetype
314840	316840	Max gets caught up with this peaceful-ish
316840	318840	Little community that has some gas
318840	320840	And then the bad guy, Lord Humongous
320840	322840	Yeah
322840	324840	He wants to kill them to get the gas
324840	326840	Max keeps doing these people favors
326840	328840	In exchange for stuff
328840	330840	People keep begging him to stick around
330840	332840	He keeps wanting to leave
332840	334840	And is forced to stay
334840	336840	He just wants his stuff
336840	338840	Stuff is a big theme in these movies
338840	340840	No wifey to get Fridge this time
340840	342840	But he does have a cute
343160	345160	Well-trained dog
345160	347160	And you can guess how that ends
347160	349160	Max defines himself
349160	351160	More in his relationship to his stuff
351160	353160	Than to other people
353160	355160	In Road Warrior he's all about gas
355160	357160	And then he's all about his car
357160	359160	Once he finally lets go of the stuff
359160	361160	He finds out that he'd been duped
361160	363160	By the very people he'd risked his life to help
363160	365160	Turns out that maybe Max was right
365160	367160	To want to go it alone
367160	369160	That was the last we ever saw of him
369160	371160	Stupid, disappointing other human beings
371480	373480	Thunderdome, how do I get in there?
373480	375480	That's easy, pick a fight
375480	377480	And now we get to the infamously bizarre
377480	379480	Beyond Thunderdome
379480	381480	Where once again, Max's primary motivation is
381480	383480	Stuff
383480	385480	It's a few more decades on after what appears to be
385480	387480	A worldwide nuclear war
387480	389480	Where in the last one it was his macho car driving
389480	391480	In this one it's his macho face punching
391480	393480	And not dying in the face of probably dying
393480	395480	Congratulations
395480	397480	You're the first to survive the audition
397480	399480	In looking for his stuff
399480	401480	Max falls in with the evil Tina Turner
401480	403480	And goes along with what she wants
403480	405480	Until he's basically punished for not being
405480	407480	A total monster and refusing to kill
407480	409480	A mentally disabled man
409480	411480	Before long he escapes, barely survives
411480	413480	And then gets thrust into
413480	415480	This lost boy's nightmare
415480	417480	Fly Walker, fly!
417480	419480	Fly Walker, fly!
419480	421480	Fly Walker, fly!
421480	423480	Fly Walker, fly!
423480	425480	And he's not thrilled to be here
425480	427480	But you know, whatever, they're kids
427480	429480	So while always with a mind
429480	431480	To get his stuff back, once again
431480	433480	He's reluctantly drawn into a sort of
433480	435480	Eh, I probably shouldn't let these children
435480	437480	Get killed situation
437480	439480	In the end, Max brings some misfits together
439480	441480	Sacrifices his own well-being for some of those kids
441480	443480	And while Thunderdome
443480	445480	Is the goofiest, it's also got the most
445480	447480	Complete arc for Max as a character
447480	449480	Of those first three movies
449480	451480	In that he actually does something somewhat selfless
451480	453480	And then doesn't regret it
453480	455480	But at the same time he ends up being alone
455480	457480	Now for a while this was
457480	459480	Supposed to be the last entry in the series
459480	461480	In part for that reason
461480	463480	But then 30 years later
471480	473480	Mad Max Fury Road
473480	475480	Is the hardest to pin down in terms of
475480	477480	Continuity. Max alludes to
477480	479480	Having been a cop at the very beginning
479480	481480	But it's pretty obvious that it's been at least
481480	483480	A couple generations since civilization fell
483480	485480	Max is now portrayed
485480	487480	By Pitbull-Elf hybrid Tom Hardy
487480	489480	And when we're first introduced to Max
489480	491480	He's haunted by memories and even
491480	493480	Hallucinations of people he could not save
493480	495480	And no, this doesn't
495480	497480	Appear to be a clear reference to any of the
497480	499480	Previous three movies. The most frequent
499480	501480	Of these accusing dead is a little girl
501480	503480	And she's definitely not in the previous three
503480	505480	So is this his daughter?
505480	507480	Some kid? I don't know. There's several
507480	509480	Other characters who weren't really there in the previous three
509480	511480	Again, in terms of continuity
511480	513480	The thread seems to be
515480	517480	Don't worry about it
517480	519480	So is this the same Max?
529480	531480	Max in Fury Road is the lowest we've yet seen him
531480	533480	At the beginning of the film he's been alone
533480	535480	For so long he's almost forgotten how to speak
535480	537480	Horribly traumatized and suffering from
537480	539480	Intense post-traumatic stress
539480	541480	Where Gibson's Max was controlled
541480	543480	Calculating Hardy's Max can
543480	545480	Barely keep it together
545480	547480	Part of what makes Fury Road so compelling
547480	549480	Compared to the other three is the thing that's being
549480	551480	Fought over is not stuff
551480	553480	Like gas and cars
553480	555480	But personhood. For the first half hour
555480	557480	Not only is Max stripped of all of his stuff
557480	559480	But also of all agency
559480	561480	Strapped to the front of a car as a blood bank
561480	563480	For the war boy Nux under the belief
563480	565480	That this will make his blood more
565480	567480	Adrenaline-y
567480	569480	I mean
569480	571480	He is pissed about the whole ordeal but
573480	575480	Mostly he's mad that they took his stuff
575480	577480	Namely his car and his blood
577480	579480	But as far as the plot proper
579480	581480	Max is not motivated by stuff ever
581480	583480	As in the previous two
583480	585480	But like Furiosa and the wives, by survival
585480	587480	And the movie wastes very little time
587480	589480	Getting our heroes to get over themselves
589480	591480	And work together because it's just the logical thing to do
591480	593480	Because the world is harsh and awful
593480	595480	And really hard to survive in
595480	597480	But when they work together, dammit, they don't waste any time
597480	599480	Being surprised at the abilities of the other
599480	601480	It's just like, oh, you can do the thing
601480	603480	Good, do the thing
603480	605480	That is surprisingly rare with
605480	607480	Male and female co-leads
607480	609480	Almost immediately after Max escapes
609480	611480	Captivity he gets the shit kicked out of him by a one-armed woman
611480	613480	But there's never any
613480	615480	Egotistical butthurt about it
615480	617480	And that does set him apart from most action movie heroes
617480	619480	He doesn't need to reassert his masculinity
619480	621480	There's just no time for that
621480	623480	But the real brilliance of Fury Road
623480	625480	Is the way it thematically examines
625480	627480	Its own predecessors
627480	629480	Especially in regards to characters
629480	631480	Being motivated by stuff
631480	633480	In Fury Road, the stuff is people
633480	635480	That's my child!
635480	637480	I want them back!
637480	639480	They're my property!
639480	641480	Human objectification is a huge theme
641480	643480	The wives are Joe's property
643480	645480	The war boys are Joe's disposable war fodder
645480	647480	Their unborn children are Joe's property
647480	649480	And Max himself, basically an organ and blood donor
649480	651480	Is also property
651480	653480	So while Fury Road is awesome and fun as hell to watch
653480	655480	It's also a fascinating re-examination
655480	657480	On the themes of the previous three
657480	659480	Max was never an ideal
659480	661480	More of a fall-from-grace sort
661480	663480	Than an honest-to-god anti-hero
663480	665480	Maybe in the third one, but yeah
665480	667480	But the first three films are more thematically complex
667480	669480	Than idealizing Max's either running away
669480	671480	Or violence-is-the-solution-to-everything
671480	673480	Approach to masculinity
673480	675480	I don't think it's any coincidence
675480	677480	That Nux bears a strong narrative resemblance
677480	679480	To the young brainwashed Johnny
679480	681480	Who Max killed in Cold Blood in the first movie
681480	683480	Modern Max has zero interest in vengeance
683480	685480	Or even comeuppance
685480	687480	Just survival
687480	689480	And as a result, we have the highest stakes
689480	691480	We've ever seen in a Mad Max movie
691480	693480	And of course we're talking about sequels
693480	695480	And honestly, I
695480	697480	I don't
697480	699480	I don't know how they're going to follow this one
699480	701480	As it was very complete
701480	703480	But hey
703480	705480	If we can go from here
705480	707480	Here to here
707480	709480	In thirty years, who knows
709480	711480	We will be back next week
711480	713480	With a real full episode of The Loose Cannon
713480	715480	Which is death
715480	717480	And it's coming, I promise
717480	719480	Hang in there, thanks for watching
719480	721480	Patreon, Twitter
721480	723480	Go see Mad Max Fury Road, you'll love it
723480	725480	And if you don't
