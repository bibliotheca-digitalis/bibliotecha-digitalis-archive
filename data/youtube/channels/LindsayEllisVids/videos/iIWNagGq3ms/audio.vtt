00:00.000 --> 00:08.720
Hey, remember, like, six months ago when we were like, hey everyone, you should read The

00:08.720 --> 00:11.120
Girl with All the Gifts for our next review?

00:11.120 --> 00:12.120
Uh-huh.

00:12.120 --> 00:16.360
It's so much time since, but happy Galentine's Day.

00:16.360 --> 00:17.360
Galentine's Day!

00:17.360 --> 00:18.360
Yes!

00:18.360 --> 00:19.360
Yay!

00:19.360 --> 00:20.360
Yay!

00:20.360 --> 00:24.360
For this book that features a lot of dynamic female characters.

00:24.360 --> 00:25.520
And how.

00:25.520 --> 00:26.520
And how.

00:26.520 --> 00:29.280
So, let's see, what are we drinking today?

00:29.280 --> 00:35.120
Well, in the spirit of Galentine's, um, we've gotten a very red, bloody-like drink.

00:35.120 --> 00:38.120
See, I was going for the spirit of, like, Greek-themed.

00:38.120 --> 00:40.200
Oh, well, that too.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.200
Greek-themed things.

00:41.200 --> 00:42.200
Oh, pomegranates.

00:42.200 --> 00:43.200
I get it.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.480
Well, maybe six months ago.

00:45.480 --> 00:51.400
We've invited our friend Lindsay Rebar, who many of you may remember from when Lindsay

00:51.400 --> 00:53.840
and Lisa reviewed her book.

00:53.840 --> 00:56.640
It's called The Art of Wishing, and the second one is The Fourth Wish.

00:56.640 --> 00:57.640
Go buy them.

00:57.640 --> 00:58.640
I don't know.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Am I supposed to say that?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Yeah, you should.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Go buy them.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Pimp your wares.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.080
We've invited her to join us because, um, this is one of those books where we all liked

01:08.080 --> 01:13.200
it so much, this is going to be an otherwise really boring review, unless we focus on something

01:13.200 --> 01:14.200
else.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.200
Yeah.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.120
The thing is, while I was reading it, I didn't think about structure at all because I just

01:18.120 --> 01:19.360
wanted to know what happened next.

01:19.360 --> 01:24.640
This is my contribution to the squeeing about this book, is there's nothing wrong with it.

01:24.640 --> 01:25.640
I loved it.

01:25.640 --> 01:26.640
I don't know anything about it.

01:27.640 --> 01:28.640
It was perfect, yeah.

01:28.640 --> 01:29.640
It was awesome.

01:29.640 --> 01:30.640
Oh my god.

01:30.640 --> 01:33.640
So, um, should we explain the base of it?

01:33.640 --> 01:34.640
Yeah, we should probably.

01:34.640 --> 01:35.640
What's the book about?

01:35.640 --> 01:36.640
It's a zombie book.

01:36.640 --> 01:37.640
Surprise.

01:37.640 --> 01:45.640
Yeah, which is a little weird in and of itself for me because I am not a fan of zombie literature

01:45.640 --> 01:46.640
or zombie anything really.

01:46.640 --> 01:52.720
I think I've said this before in previous videos, but zombie stories are pretty much

01:52.720 --> 01:57.720
the guilt-free story because you can have the bad guy that you don't have to think about

01:57.720 --> 01:59.720
their motive or anything.

01:59.720 --> 02:04.720
It's about survival, so you instantly have, well, there is your drama right there.

02:04.720 --> 02:06.720
You don't have to think about it.

02:06.720 --> 02:09.720
Even though in a lot of zombie things they try to make it, well, it's not about the zombies,

02:09.720 --> 02:12.720
it's about the humans and how humanity falls apart.

02:12.720 --> 02:15.720
It takes place on this sort of like science bunker.

02:15.720 --> 02:20.720
So, while there are the mindless zombies, we also have these, you know, kids and they're

02:20.720 --> 02:25.720
all children who for some reason have like mental capacity, sometimes genius level, as

02:25.720 --> 02:27.720
in the case with our protagonist, Melanie.

02:27.720 --> 02:32.720
And so basically it's like on this science camp trying to, you know, figure out why they

02:32.720 --> 02:34.720
be the way they be.

02:34.720 --> 02:40.720
And on the one hand we have the teacher character who is, you know, a woman.

02:40.720 --> 02:43.720
She's awesome, I love her.

02:43.720 --> 02:47.720
And she kind of sees them as little, you know, people, which they are.

02:47.720 --> 02:50.720
And, you know, she's the teacher and they all really like her and they like learning

02:50.720 --> 02:51.720
because they're kids.

02:51.720 --> 02:54.720
But then there are like other characters, like the sergeant.

02:54.720 --> 02:57.720
He's a huge racist against zombies and he doesn't see them as people.

02:57.720 --> 03:03.720
And then there, of course, is like the Dr. Caldwell who is just like this sort of...

03:03.720 --> 03:08.720
She's the mad scientist who is going to save humanity by not having any more children.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.720
She's going to science the shit out of this.

03:10.720 --> 03:12.720
And she's also a she.

03:12.720 --> 03:15.720
It's like, so like our three main characters, like we were shocked to find out that this

03:15.720 --> 03:18.720
wasn't written by a woman because like the three main characters are women.

03:18.720 --> 03:22.720
It's like, you know, the moral center, Justino.

03:22.720 --> 03:23.720
The mad scientist.

03:23.720 --> 03:25.720
You never see female mad scientists.

03:25.720 --> 03:27.720
Heartless female mad scientist.

03:27.720 --> 03:30.720
Yeah, the girl with all the gifts, Melanie.

03:30.720 --> 03:31.720
And she's what, ten years old?

03:31.720 --> 03:32.720
Yeah, she's like ten-ish.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.720
This is a ten-year-old zombie as the main character.

03:34.720 --> 03:35.720
Yeah.

03:35.720 --> 03:38.720
And I identified with her a little more than I should have.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.720
And it's an adult book too.

03:40.720 --> 03:41.720
Yeah.

03:41.720 --> 03:45.720
Yeah, but what I also enjoyed is, you know, these characters start as you think characters

03:45.720 --> 03:47.720
you've seen all before.

03:47.720 --> 03:51.720
And then they all get those little twists that make them human.

03:51.720 --> 03:54.720
And not just, well, here's the racist surgeon.

03:54.720 --> 03:57.720
And here's the mad scientist lady who's...

03:57.720 --> 04:01.720
And then our other guy who was obviously just brought in to die.

04:01.720 --> 04:02.720
Well, yeah.

04:02.720 --> 04:05.720
It's like the first day on the force.

04:05.720 --> 04:09.720
It was his first day.

04:09.720 --> 04:11.720
Yeah, there's other five main characters.

04:11.720 --> 04:12.720
One of them is a red shirt.

04:12.720 --> 04:13.720
See, that was something I could see coming.

04:13.720 --> 04:16.720
It was like, the author clearly does not care about this story.

04:16.720 --> 04:19.720
My favorite part of that was the character thought coming too.

04:19.720 --> 04:22.720
He was like, I was kind of brought into this book to die.

04:22.720 --> 04:23.720
And then he died.

04:23.720 --> 04:26.720
And he's like, I knew it.

04:26.720 --> 04:27.720
Hey, spoilers.

04:27.720 --> 04:28.720
But then even with...

04:28.720 --> 04:29.720
A lot of character death.

04:29.720 --> 04:30.720
Justine.

04:30.720 --> 04:31.720
Or Miss Justine.

04:31.720 --> 04:32.720
Justine, I don't know.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.720
Just, you know.

04:34.720 --> 04:38.720
What I love is that it sets it, like, you think, oh, well here's the woman who can't

04:38.720 --> 04:42.720
help but empathize with the scary bad thing.

04:42.720 --> 04:45.720
And then it's like, but then her foil is also a woman.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.720
Oh, my gosh.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.720
And they do all start as archetypes.

04:49.720 --> 04:53.720
And I found it a little Joss Whedon-y in that way, where everybody's a little

04:53.720 --> 04:58.720
deeper than you thought they were in ways that you wouldn't necessarily expect.

04:58.720 --> 05:02.720
But also, like, the fact that their gender-ness never comes into play as a

05:02.720 --> 05:03.720
function in the story.

05:03.720 --> 05:04.720
Yeah.

05:04.720 --> 05:05.720
You know?

05:05.720 --> 05:07.720
It's like the gender of, like, their gender is completely irrelevant.

05:07.720 --> 05:10.720
And that's what we say when we just don't want cliché female characters.

05:10.720 --> 05:14.720
It's like, especially in a story like this, it's just like so-and-so happens to

05:14.720 --> 05:21.720
be a woman and, you know, is not acting in a stereotypical way vis-a-vis what

05:21.720 --> 05:26.720
type of roles women are normally allowed to play in stories like these.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.720
And I don't, like, I don't know how much we should talk about it because it's,

05:28.720 --> 05:33.720
like, part of what made this book so, like, as close to flawless as a book is

05:33.720 --> 05:40.720
going to get is that the payoff at the end was so perfectly built up and yet so

05:40.720 --> 05:42.720
not predictable.

05:42.720 --> 05:43.720
You know?

05:43.720 --> 05:47.720
There's this point, and I think I can say this in a spoiler-free way, but there

05:47.720 --> 05:51.720
is this point in the book about two or three pages from the end where you

05:51.720 --> 05:54.720
realize that you're two or three pages from the end.

05:54.720 --> 05:58.720
There is no satisfying way that this story could wrap up.

05:58.720 --> 06:03.720
And, like, then it does in a way that I didn't see coming.

06:03.720 --> 06:06.720
I'm sure there's somebody out there saying, oh, yeah, I totally saw that

06:06.720 --> 06:07.720
coming.

06:07.720 --> 06:08.720
Whatever.

06:08.720 --> 06:09.720
No, you didn't.

06:09.720 --> 06:12.720
Not only is it the perfect ending, but it also turns the entire rest of the

06:12.720 --> 06:16.720
story retroactively into a completely different story than the one you thought

06:16.720 --> 06:19.720
you were reading without making you feel cheated in the process.

06:19.720 --> 06:20.720
Yes.

06:20.720 --> 06:23.720
That kind of, like, perfectly sums up, like, why this went from just, like, good

06:23.720 --> 06:24.720
adventure story.

06:24.720 --> 06:26.720
I want to know what happens next to holy shit, you know?

06:26.720 --> 06:28.720
It wasn't even a twist ending, because it wasn't.

06:28.720 --> 06:29.720
No, it wasn't at all.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.720
It was, like, damn.

06:31.720 --> 06:32.720
You know?

06:32.720 --> 06:36.720
And it really does invert that whole idea of in a zombie story where it's, like,

06:36.720 --> 06:39.720
well, obviously the humans are the good, and this should survive.

06:39.720 --> 06:43.720
Reading it, I ended up comparing a lot of it to The Last of Us, which is a

06:43.720 --> 06:45.720
video game super popular.

06:45.720 --> 06:46.720
You might not have heard of it.

06:46.720 --> 06:47.720
I've heard of it.

06:47.720 --> 06:48.720
I'm hip to the jazz.

06:48.720 --> 06:52.720
The things that in my mind were comparing between the two was that they're very

06:52.720 --> 06:57.720
intimate, small stories in a way, as much as there's a lot of travel and there

06:57.720 --> 07:01.720
are big implications going on in the background.

07:01.720 --> 07:07.720
I found myself comparing the ending choice between our main male character in

07:07.720 --> 07:12.720
the video game versus our young female character in the book, and the book does

07:12.720 --> 07:14.720
it so much better.

07:14.720 --> 07:16.720
Do they do similar things?

07:16.720 --> 07:21.720
They do, where there's a choice, not to get into spoilers, but there is a huge

07:21.720 --> 07:28.720
choice to make, and the implication is the doom or, say, salvation of humanity.

07:28.720 --> 07:32.720
And in the video game, I saw his choice coming.

07:32.720 --> 07:33.720
In the book, I didn't.

07:33.720 --> 07:37.720
And they're called Hungries in this book, which that's something I'm not a huge

07:37.720 --> 07:38.720
fan of.

07:38.720 --> 07:39.720
I don't know.

07:39.720 --> 07:44.720
Well, I kind of was because I didn't go into this knowing that it was a zombie

07:44.720 --> 07:45.720
book.

07:45.720 --> 07:50.720
I was sent it by a friend, the same friend that introduced me and this other

07:50.720 --> 07:53.720
Lindsay, and she was like, oh, you'll love this book.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.720
I'm not telling you anything about it.

07:55.720 --> 07:59.720
And so I was just like, meh, sure, and picked it up eight months later or

07:59.720 --> 08:00.720
whatever it was.

08:00.720 --> 08:01.720
I did the same thing.

08:01.720 --> 08:02.720
Hey!

08:02.720 --> 08:03.720
Because it was a zombie book.

08:03.720 --> 08:08.720
And the camera, as it were, opens the story in such tight focus that you don't

08:08.720 --> 08:09.720
actually see what's going on.

08:09.720 --> 08:14.720
You actually think that you're reading a story about this girl who's an abused

08:14.720 --> 08:17.720
captive or something like that, but it turns out they're just restraining her

08:17.720 --> 08:20.720
because they're afraid she'll eat everyone, which is a legitimate fear.

08:20.720 --> 08:21.720
Yeah.

08:21.720 --> 08:25.720
And it slowly expands until you see what the base is and how it functions.

08:25.720 --> 08:30.720
I'm not a huge, it just feels kind of unnatural to me when we must rename

08:30.720 --> 08:33.720
things that are like, you know.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.720
Where if it actually happened everyone would be like, yeah, they're zombies.

08:36.720 --> 08:37.720
And then they were the zombies.

08:37.720 --> 08:39.720
You know, it's like that was one thing that really kind of.

08:39.720 --> 08:40.720
This one.

08:40.720 --> 08:41.720
Oh.

08:41.720 --> 08:46.720
This one that I really was not wild about was the fact that the aliens were

08:46.720 --> 08:47.720
called the others.

08:47.720 --> 08:49.720
And it's just like, no, they'd be called the fucking aliens.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.720
It's like, come the fuck on, you know?

08:51.720 --> 08:52.720
I haven't actually read that.

08:52.720 --> 08:53.720
I didn't know.

08:53.720 --> 08:55.720
Yeah, they're just like, oh no, it's an other.

08:55.720 --> 08:56.720
It's like, it's an alien.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.720
You would not say an other.

08:58.720 --> 08:59.720
Yeah.

08:59.720 --> 09:02.720
It's like, you would either name the species or you would call it a fucking

09:02.720 --> 09:03.720
alien.

09:03.720 --> 09:04.720
You know.

09:04.720 --> 09:06.720
That's kind of how I felt about The Hungries.

09:06.720 --> 09:09.720
I'm like, you would either give it a species name or you would call it a

09:09.720 --> 09:11.720
fucking zombie because that's what it is.

09:11.720 --> 09:12.720
I did actually.

09:12.720 --> 09:16.720
I thought of Feed by Mira Grant, which is my all-time.

09:16.720 --> 09:17.720
It's up there.

09:17.720 --> 09:18.720
It's up there.

09:18.720 --> 09:19.720
Hey, there it is.

09:19.720 --> 09:22.720
My all-time favorite zombie horror series.

09:22.720 --> 09:25.720
If you want zombie comedy, My Life is a White Trash Zombie by Diana

09:25.720 --> 09:26.720
Rowland.

09:26.720 --> 09:27.720
Go read it.

09:27.720 --> 09:32.720
But zombie horror series, that one, they have all of the references.

09:32.720 --> 09:34.720
All the references that we do.

09:34.720 --> 09:39.720
Everybody cites Dawn of the Dead as the quintessential zombie movie because

09:39.720 --> 09:42.720
that's the mythology that's closest to what actually happened.

09:42.720 --> 09:46.720
As a result, everybody in the next generation of kids is suddenly named

09:46.720 --> 09:49.720
George after George Romero, the savior of humanity, who taught us how to

09:49.720 --> 09:50.720
fight zombies.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.720
But we don't really get that in The Girl with All the Gifts.

09:52.720 --> 09:55.720
They're Hungries and they're totally new for some reason.

09:55.720 --> 10:00.720
I mean, for me it would work if we were just referring to the children that

10:00.720 --> 10:07.720
way because not wanting to say the zombie word in front of them in case

10:07.720 --> 10:08.720
they pick up on it.

10:08.720 --> 10:09.720
Yeah.

10:09.720 --> 10:12.720
I could see it being a code within the book.

10:12.720 --> 10:16.720
Or to differentiate them from the adults who are the needless zombies.

10:16.720 --> 10:17.720
But that's not the case.

10:17.720 --> 10:18.720
Yeah.

10:18.720 --> 10:21.720
Part of the reason we're being so vague about it is we know there are people

10:21.720 --> 10:23.720
who haven't read it.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.720
Normally we'll talk spoilers, but I don't want to with this book.

10:26.720 --> 10:27.720
Yeah.

10:27.720 --> 10:30.720
So definitely if you haven't read it yet, go out and read it.

10:30.720 --> 10:31.720
Go.

10:31.720 --> 10:32.720
Go forth.

10:32.720 --> 10:33.720
Enjoy it.

10:33.720 --> 10:34.720
Come back to the comments.

10:34.720 --> 10:35.720
Tell us what you think.

10:35.720 --> 10:36.720
If you haven't read it, come to the comments.

10:36.720 --> 10:37.720
What did you think?

10:37.720 --> 10:38.720
If you haven't read it, beware the comments.

10:38.720 --> 10:41.720
But gush with us once you come back and read it.

10:41.720 --> 10:45.720
That was my main takeaway with this book.

10:45.720 --> 10:50.720
I'd never seen such a perfectly set up ending that was not predictable.

10:50.720 --> 10:55.720
And I feel like even in saying that, it's kind of spoilery, but it is what it is.

10:55.720 --> 10:56.720
Don't worry.

10:56.720 --> 10:57.720
Just go for the ride.

10:57.720 --> 10:58.720
You're going to love it and then you're going to cry.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.720
And then if you're like us, you're going to be like,

11:00.720 --> 11:02.720
I'll never write anything as good as this.

11:02.720 --> 11:03.720
Yeah.

11:03.720 --> 11:08.720
Well, and then you go to your computer and you delete everything you've ever written

11:08.720 --> 11:10.720
and you start burning manuscripts.

11:10.720 --> 11:11.720
Nope.

11:11.720 --> 11:12.720
Nope.

11:12.720 --> 11:13.720
I literally did that.

11:13.720 --> 11:14.720
How did you know?

11:14.720 --> 11:16.720
Kawhi bought it.

11:16.720 --> 11:19.720
It's like I'm canceling my contract.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.720
I'm not doing this anymore.

11:21.720 --> 11:23.720
I'm back.

11:23.720 --> 11:28.720
Well, speaking of other books, would you like to recommend next week's book?

11:28.720 --> 11:29.720
I would.

11:29.720 --> 11:30.720
I would.

11:30.720 --> 11:31.720
Where is it?

11:31.720 --> 11:32.720
Behind the iPad.

11:33.720 --> 11:37.720
The next book that I don't think I'm reviewing, but I would if you guys would have me back.

11:37.720 --> 11:38.720
Oh, yeah.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.720
It would be like another gush fest.

11:40.720 --> 11:46.720
Oh, yeah, totally, is my favorite book of 2014 that wasn't written by a friend of mine.

11:46.720 --> 11:51.720
Although if you're A.S. King and you're watching this and you want to be my friend,

11:51.720 --> 11:55.720
let's totally make that happen because holy shit.

11:55.720 --> 11:58.720
This is called Glory O'Brien's History of the Future,

11:58.720 --> 12:05.720
and it is amazing and feminist and literary without being pretentious, which I love.

12:05.720 --> 12:08.720
Yeah, it's a gorgeous, gorgeous book.

12:08.720 --> 12:12.720
Okay, so for the one after that, we're going to put it up to a vote.

12:12.720 --> 12:15.720
Based on your suggestions on Twitter, we were going to do some graphic novels.

12:15.720 --> 12:18.720
Believe it or not, there is no Transformers in here.

12:18.720 --> 12:20.720
Next time.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.720
Maybe one day.

12:22.720 --> 12:26.720
Yeah, we wanted mainly either female-centric or female protagonists.

12:26.720 --> 12:29.720
We only asked for ones that had trade paperbacks out just so it could be more book-like.

12:29.720 --> 12:31.720
So here are your three options.

12:31.720 --> 12:35.720
Go into the comments and vote for one, and then we will announce it when we review this book,

12:35.720 --> 12:38.720
Glory O'Brien's History of the Future.

12:38.720 --> 12:42.720
So your three options are Rat Queens, volume one through something.

12:42.720 --> 12:46.720
Ms. Marvel, volume—I think there's only one.

12:46.720 --> 12:51.720
Or, of course, Saga, which is up to volume five or six or something.

12:51.720 --> 12:53.720
We're going to read the three Sagas.

12:53.720 --> 12:55.720
We're going to read the three, and then we'll talk about it.

12:55.720 --> 12:57.720
Basically, we'll just say whatever's on trade.

12:57.720 --> 12:58.720
That's what we're going to talk about.

12:58.720 --> 13:02.720
Although I'm going to go ahead and catch up on Ms. Marvel because number 12 is coming out tomorrow,

13:02.720 --> 13:08.720
and Loki's the special guest, so we've got to see that.

13:08.720 --> 13:14.720
So vote for which of the three, Ms. Marvel, Saga, or Rat Queens you want us to talk about,

13:14.720 --> 13:17.720
and then we will announce it when we review this sucker.

13:17.720 --> 13:20.720
Depending on how well the voting goes, we might do that from now on.

13:20.720 --> 13:25.720
Hey. Hey, Lindsay. I'm really mad for you.

13:25.720 --> 13:31.720
Oh, I've lost my mind over you.

13:31.720 --> 13:33.720
We'll talk about—oh, yeah, and also—

13:33.720 --> 13:37.720
I think this is a reference to another book we read one time.

13:37.720 --> 13:38.720
Deja vu?

13:38.720 --> 13:39.720
Yeah.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.720
You should talk about our book one day.

13:41.720 --> 13:42.720
Oh my god, yes.

13:42.720 --> 13:45.720
This is from me to you.

13:45.720 --> 13:48.720
Which also, by the way, of course, keep sending us your comments about what you want to see

13:48.720 --> 13:53.720
in a live-in book two of the Viridian Saga,

13:53.720 --> 13:56.720
as we are now fleshing out the outline for Realsies.

13:56.720 --> 13:58.720
Yes, we are for Realsies. We're working on it, I promise.

13:58.720 --> 14:01.720
All right, well, thank you so much for joining us, Other Lindsay.

14:01.720 --> 14:03.720
Thank you for having me, and for the drinks.

14:03.720 --> 14:05.720
I'm going to take this faster.

14:05.720 --> 14:08.720
I'm savoring it.

14:08.720 --> 14:12.720
And so we look forward to your comments, and we will see you next time.

14:15.720 --> 14:20.720
We'll see you next time.
