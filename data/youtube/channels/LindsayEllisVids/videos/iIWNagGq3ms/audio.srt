1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,720
Hey, remember, like, six months ago when we were like, hey everyone, you should read The

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,120
Girl with All the Gifts for our next review?

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,120
Uh-huh.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,360
It's so much time since, but happy Galentine's Day.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,360
Galentine's Day!

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,360
Yes!

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,360
Yay!

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,360
Yay!

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,360
For this book that features a lot of dynamic female characters.

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,520
And how.

11
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,520
And how.

12
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,280
So, let's see, what are we drinking today?

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:35,120
Well, in the spirit of Galentine's, um, we've gotten a very red, bloody-like drink.

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,120
See, I was going for the spirit of, like, Greek-themed.

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,200
Oh, well, that too.

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,200
Greek-themed things.

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,200
Oh, pomegranates.

18
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,200
I get it.

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,480
Well, maybe six months ago.

20
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,400
We've invited our friend Lindsay Rebar, who many of you may remember from when Lindsay

21
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,840
and Lisa reviewed her book.

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,640
It's called The Art of Wishing, and the second one is The Fourth Wish.

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,640
Go buy them.

24
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,640
I don't know.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Am I supposed to say that?

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yeah, you should.

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Go buy them.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Pimp your wares.

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,080
We've invited her to join us because, um, this is one of those books where we all liked

30
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,200
it so much, this is going to be an otherwise really boring review, unless we focus on something

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,200
else.

32
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,200
Yeah.

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,120
The thing is, while I was reading it, I didn't think about structure at all because I just

34
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,360
wanted to know what happened next.

35
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,640
This is my contribution to the squeeing about this book, is there's nothing wrong with it.

36
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,640
I loved it.

37
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,640
I don't know anything about it.

38
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,640
It was perfect, yeah.

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,640
It was awesome.

40
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,640
Oh my god.

41
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,640
So, um, should we explain the base of it?

42
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,640
Yeah, we should probably.

43
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,640
What's the book about?

44
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,640
It's a zombie book.

45
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,640
Surprise.

46
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:45,640
Yeah, which is a little weird in and of itself for me because I am not a fan of zombie literature

47
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,640
or zombie anything really.

48
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,720
I think I've said this before in previous videos, but zombie stories are pretty much

49
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,720
the guilt-free story because you can have the bad guy that you don't have to think about

50
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,720
their motive or anything.

51
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,720
It's about survival, so you instantly have, well, there is your drama right there.

52
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,720
You don't have to think about it.

53
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,720
Even though in a lot of zombie things they try to make it, well, it's not about the zombies,

54
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,720
it's about the humans and how humanity falls apart.

55
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,720
It takes place on this sort of like science bunker.

56
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,720
So, while there are the mindless zombies, we also have these, you know, kids and they're

57
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,720
all children who for some reason have like mental capacity, sometimes genius level, as

58
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,720
in the case with our protagonist, Melanie.

59
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,720
And so basically it's like on this science camp trying to, you know, figure out why they

60
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,720
be the way they be.

61
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,720
And on the one hand we have the teacher character who is, you know, a woman.

62
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,720
She's awesome, I love her.

63
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,720
And she kind of sees them as little, you know, people, which they are.

64
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,720
And, you know, she's the teacher and they all really like her and they like learning

65
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,720
because they're kids.

66
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,720
But then there are like other characters, like the sergeant.

67
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,720
He's a huge racist against zombies and he doesn't see them as people.

68
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,720
And then there, of course, is like the Dr. Caldwell who is just like this sort of...

69
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,720
She's the mad scientist who is going to save humanity by not having any more children.

70
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,720
She's going to science the shit out of this.

71
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,720
And she's also a she.

72
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,720
It's like, so like our three main characters, like we were shocked to find out that this

73
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,720
wasn't written by a woman because like the three main characters are women.

74
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,720
It's like, you know, the moral center, Justino.

75
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,720
The mad scientist.

76
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,720
You never see female mad scientists.

77
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,720
Heartless female mad scientist.

78
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,720
Yeah, the girl with all the gifts, Melanie.

79
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
And she's what, ten years old?

80
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
Yeah, she's like ten-ish.

81
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,720
This is a ten-year-old zombie as the main character.

82
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
Yeah.

83
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,720
And I identified with her a little more than I should have.

84
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,720
And it's an adult book too.

85
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,720
Yeah.

86
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,720
Yeah, but what I also enjoyed is, you know, these characters start as you think characters

87
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,720
you've seen all before.

88
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,720
And then they all get those little twists that make them human.

89
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,720
And not just, well, here's the racist surgeon.

90
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,720
And here's the mad scientist lady who's...

91
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,720
And then our other guy who was obviously just brought in to die.

92
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,720
Well, yeah.

93
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,720
It's like the first day on the force.

94
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,720
It was his first day.

95
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,720
Yeah, there's other five main characters.

96
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
One of them is a red shirt.

97
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,720
See, that was something I could see coming.

98
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,720
It was like, the author clearly does not care about this story.

99
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,720
My favorite part of that was the character thought coming too.

100
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,720
He was like, I was kind of brought into this book to die.

101
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
And then he died.

102
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,720
And he's like, I knew it.

103
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,720
Hey, spoilers.

104
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,720
But then even with...

105
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
A lot of character death.

106
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
Justine.

107
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
Or Miss Justine.

108
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
Justine, I don't know.

109
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
Just, you know.

110
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,720
What I love is that it sets it, like, you think, oh, well here's the woman who can't

111
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,720
help but empathize with the scary bad thing.

112
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,720
And then it's like, but then her foil is also a woman.

113
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,720
Oh, my gosh.

114
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,720
And they do all start as archetypes.

115
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,720
And I found it a little Joss Whedon-y in that way, where everybody's a little

116
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,720
deeper than you thought they were in ways that you wouldn't necessarily expect.

117
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,720
But also, like, the fact that their gender-ness never comes into play as a

118
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,720
function in the story.

119
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
Yeah.

120
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,720
You know?

121
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,720
It's like the gender of, like, their gender is completely irrelevant.

122
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,720
And that's what we say when we just don't want cliché female characters.

123
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,720
It's like, especially in a story like this, it's just like so-and-so happens to

124
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,720
be a woman and, you know, is not acting in a stereotypical way vis-a-vis what

125
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,720
type of roles women are normally allowed to play in stories like these.

126
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,720
And I don't, like, I don't know how much we should talk about it because it's,

127
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,720
like, part of what made this book so, like, as close to flawless as a book is

128
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:40,720
going to get is that the payoff at the end was so perfectly built up and yet so

129
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,720
not predictable.

130
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
You know?

131
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,720
There's this point, and I think I can say this in a spoiler-free way, but there

132
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,720
is this point in the book about two or three pages from the end where you

133
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,720
realize that you're two or three pages from the end.

134
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,720
There is no satisfying way that this story could wrap up.

135
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,720
And, like, then it does in a way that I didn't see coming.

136
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,720
I'm sure there's somebody out there saying, oh, yeah, I totally saw that

137
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,720
coming.

138
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
Whatever.

139
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
No, you didn't.

140
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,720
Not only is it the perfect ending, but it also turns the entire rest of the

141
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,720
story retroactively into a completely different story than the one you thought

142
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,720
you were reading without making you feel cheated in the process.

143
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,720
Yes.

144
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,720
That kind of, like, perfectly sums up, like, why this went from just, like, good

145
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
adventure story.

146
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
I want to know what happens next to holy shit, you know?

147
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
It wasn't even a twist ending, because it wasn't.

148
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,720
No, it wasn't at all.

149
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,720
It was, like, damn.

150
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,720
You know?

151
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,720
And it really does invert that whole idea of in a zombie story where it's, like,

152
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,720
well, obviously the humans are the good, and this should survive.

153
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,720
Reading it, I ended up comparing a lot of it to The Last of Us, which is a

154
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,720
video game super popular.

155
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
You might not have heard of it.

156
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
I've heard of it.

157
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,720
I'm hip to the jazz.

158
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,720
The things that in my mind were comparing between the two was that they're very

159
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,720
intimate, small stories in a way, as much as there's a lot of travel and there

160
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,720
are big implications going on in the background.

161
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:07,720
I found myself comparing the ending choice between our main male character in

162
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,720
the video game versus our young female character in the book, and the book does

163
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,720
it so much better.

164
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
Do they do similar things?

165
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,720
They do, where there's a choice, not to get into spoilers, but there is a huge

166
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:28,720
choice to make, and the implication is the doom or, say, salvation of humanity.

167
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,720
And in the video game, I saw his choice coming.

168
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,720
In the book, I didn't.

169
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,720
And they're called Hungries in this book, which that's something I'm not a huge

170
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,720
fan of.

171
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,720
I don't know.

172
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,720
Well, I kind of was because I didn't go into this knowing that it was a zombie

173
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
book.

174
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,720
I was sent it by a friend, the same friend that introduced me and this other

175
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,720
Lindsay, and she was like, oh, you'll love this book.

176
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,720
I'm not telling you anything about it.

177
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,720
And so I was just like, meh, sure, and picked it up eight months later or

178
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,720
whatever it was.

179
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
I did the same thing.

180
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,720
Hey!

181
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,720
Because it was a zombie book.

182
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,720
And the camera, as it were, opens the story in such tight focus that you don't

183
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,720
actually see what's going on.

184
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,720
You actually think that you're reading a story about this girl who's an abused

185
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,720
captive or something like that, but it turns out they're just restraining her

186
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,720
because they're afraid she'll eat everyone, which is a legitimate fear.

187
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,720
Yeah.

188
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,720
And it slowly expands until you see what the base is and how it functions.

189
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,720
I'm not a huge, it just feels kind of unnatural to me when we must rename

190
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,720
things that are like, you know.

191
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,720
Where if it actually happened everyone would be like, yeah, they're zombies.

192
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
And then they were the zombies.

193
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,720
You know, it's like that was one thing that really kind of.

194
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
This one.

195
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
Oh.

196
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,720
This one that I really was not wild about was the fact that the aliens were

197
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
called the others.

198
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,720
And it's just like, no, they'd be called the fucking aliens.

199
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,720
It's like, come the fuck on, you know?

200
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
I haven't actually read that.

201
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
I didn't know.

202
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,720
Yeah, they're just like, oh no, it's an other.

203
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
It's like, it's an alien.

204
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
You would not say an other.

205
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
Yeah.

206
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,720
It's like, you would either name the species or you would call it a fucking

207
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,720
alien.

208
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,720
You know.

209
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
That's kind of how I felt about The Hungries.

210
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,720
I'm like, you would either give it a species name or you would call it a

211
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,720
fucking zombie because that's what it is.

212
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
I did actually.

213
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,720
I thought of Feed by Mira Grant, which is my all-time.

214
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,720
It's up there.

215
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
It's up there.

216
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,720
Hey, there it is.

217
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,720
My all-time favorite zombie horror series.

218
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,720
If you want zombie comedy, My Life is a White Trash Zombie by Diana

219
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
Rowland.

220
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,720
Go read it.

221
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,720
But zombie horror series, that one, they have all of the references.

222
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
All the references that we do.

223
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,720
Everybody cites Dawn of the Dead as the quintessential zombie movie because

224
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,720
that's the mythology that's closest to what actually happened.

225
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,720
As a result, everybody in the next generation of kids is suddenly named

226
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,720
George after George Romero, the savior of humanity, who taught us how to

227
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
fight zombies.

228
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
But we don't really get that in The Girl with All the Gifts.

229
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,720
They're Hungries and they're totally new for some reason.

230
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,720
I mean, for me it would work if we were just referring to the children that

231
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,720
way because not wanting to say the zombie word in front of them in case

232
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,720
they pick up on it.

233
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,720
Yeah.

234
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,720
I could see it being a code within the book.

235
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,720
Or to differentiate them from the adults who are the needless zombies.

236
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,720
But that's not the case.

237
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,720
Yeah.

238
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,720
Part of the reason we're being so vague about it is we know there are people

239
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,720
who haven't read it.

240
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,720
Normally we'll talk spoilers, but I don't want to with this book.

241
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,720
Yeah.

242
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,720
So definitely if you haven't read it yet, go out and read it.

243
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,720
Go.

244
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,720
Go forth.

245
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,720
Enjoy it.

246
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,720
Come back to the comments.

247
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,720
Tell us what you think.

248
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,720
If you haven't read it, come to the comments.

249
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,720
What did you think?

250
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,720
If you haven't read it, beware the comments.

251
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,720
But gush with us once you come back and read it.

252
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,720
That was my main takeaway with this book.

253
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,720
I'd never seen such a perfectly set up ending that was not predictable.

254
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,720
And I feel like even in saying that, it's kind of spoilery, but it is what it is.

255
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,720
Don't worry.

256
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
Just go for the ride.

257
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,720
You're going to love it and then you're going to cry.

258
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,720
And then if you're like us, you're going to be like,

259
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
I'll never write anything as good as this.

260
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,720
Yeah.

261
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,720
Well, and then you go to your computer and you delete everything you've ever written

262
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,720
and you start burning manuscripts.

263
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,720
Nope.

264
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,720
Nope.

265
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,720
I literally did that.

266
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,720
How did you know?

267
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,720
Kawhi bought it.

268
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,720
It's like I'm canceling my contract.

269
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,720
I'm not doing this anymore.

270
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,720
I'm back.

271
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,720
Well, speaking of other books, would you like to recommend next week's book?

272
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,720
I would.

273
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,720
I would.

274
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,720
Where is it?

275
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
Behind the iPad.

276
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,720
The next book that I don't think I'm reviewing, but I would if you guys would have me back.

277
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,720
Oh, yeah.

278
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,720
It would be like another gush fest.

279
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,720
Oh, yeah, totally, is my favorite book of 2014 that wasn't written by a friend of mine.

280
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,720
Although if you're A.S. King and you're watching this and you want to be my friend,

281
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,720
let's totally make that happen because holy shit.

282
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,720
This is called Glory O'Brien's History of the Future,

283
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:05,720
and it is amazing and feminist and literary without being pretentious, which I love.

284
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,720
Yeah, it's a gorgeous, gorgeous book.

285
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,720
Okay, so for the one after that, we're going to put it up to a vote.

286
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,720
Based on your suggestions on Twitter, we were going to do some graphic novels.

287
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,720
Believe it or not, there is no Transformers in here.

288
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,720
Next time.

289
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,720
Maybe one day.

290
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,720
Yeah, we wanted mainly either female-centric or female protagonists.

291
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,720
We only asked for ones that had trade paperbacks out just so it could be more book-like.

292
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,720
So here are your three options.

293
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,720
Go into the comments and vote for one, and then we will announce it when we review this book,

294
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,720
Glory O'Brien's History of the Future.

295
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,720
So your three options are Rat Queens, volume one through something.

296
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,720
Ms. Marvel, volume—I think there's only one.

297
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,720
Or, of course, Saga, which is up to volume five or six or something.

298
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,720
We're going to read the three Sagas.

299
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,720
We're going to read the three, and then we'll talk about it.

300
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,720
Basically, we'll just say whatever's on trade.

301
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,720
That's what we're going to talk about.

302
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,720
Although I'm going to go ahead and catch up on Ms. Marvel because number 12 is coming out tomorrow,

303
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,720
and Loki's the special guest, so we've got to see that.

304
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,720
So vote for which of the three, Ms. Marvel, Saga, or Rat Queens you want us to talk about,

305
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,720
and then we will announce it when we review this sucker.

306
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,720
Depending on how well the voting goes, we might do that from now on.

307
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,720
Hey. Hey, Lindsay. I'm really mad for you.

308
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,720
Oh, I've lost my mind over you.

309
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,720
We'll talk about—oh, yeah, and also—

310
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,720
I think this is a reference to another book we read one time.

311
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
Deja vu?

312
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
Yeah.

313
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,720
You should talk about our book one day.

314
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,720
Oh my god, yes.

315
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,720
This is from me to you.

316
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,720
Which also, by the way, of course, keep sending us your comments about what you want to see

317
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,720
in a live-in book two of the Viridian Saga,

318
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,720
as we are now fleshing out the outline for Realsies.

319
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
Yes, we are for Realsies. We're working on it, I promise.

320
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,720
All right, well, thank you so much for joining us, Other Lindsay.

321
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,720
Thank you for having me, and for the drinks.

322
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,720
I'm going to take this faster.

323
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,720
I'm savoring it.

324
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,720
And so we look forward to your comments, and we will see you next time.

325
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,720
We'll see you next time.
