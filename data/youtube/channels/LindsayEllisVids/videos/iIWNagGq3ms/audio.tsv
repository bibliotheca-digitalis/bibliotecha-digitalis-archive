0	8720	Hey, remember, like, six months ago when we were like, hey everyone, you should read The
8720	11120	Girl with All the Gifts for our next review?
11120	12120	Uh-huh.
12120	16360	It's so much time since, but happy Galentine's Day.
16360	17360	Galentine's Day!
17360	18360	Yes!
18360	19360	Yay!
19360	20360	Yay!
20360	24360	For this book that features a lot of dynamic female characters.
24360	25520	And how.
25520	26520	And how.
26520	29280	So, let's see, what are we drinking today?
29280	35120	Well, in the spirit of Galentine's, um, we've gotten a very red, bloody-like drink.
35120	38120	See, I was going for the spirit of, like, Greek-themed.
38120	40200	Oh, well, that too.
40200	41200	Greek-themed things.
41200	42200	Oh, pomegranates.
42200	43200	I get it.
43200	45480	Well, maybe six months ago.
45480	51400	We've invited our friend Lindsay Rebar, who many of you may remember from when Lindsay
51400	53840	and Lisa reviewed her book.
53840	56640	It's called The Art of Wishing, and the second one is The Fourth Wish.
56640	57640	Go buy them.
57640	58640	I don't know.
59000	60000	Am I supposed to say that?
60000	61000	Yeah, you should.
61000	62000	Go buy them.
62000	63000	Pimp your wares.
63000	68080	We've invited her to join us because, um, this is one of those books where we all liked
68080	73200	it so much, this is going to be an otherwise really boring review, unless we focus on something
73200	74200	else.
74200	75200	Yeah.
75200	78120	The thing is, while I was reading it, I didn't think about structure at all because I just
78120	79360	wanted to know what happened next.
79360	84640	This is my contribution to the squeeing about this book, is there's nothing wrong with it.
84640	85640	I loved it.
85640	86640	I don't know anything about it.
87640	88640	It was perfect, yeah.
88640	89640	It was awesome.
89640	90640	Oh my god.
90640	93640	So, um, should we explain the base of it?
93640	94640	Yeah, we should probably.
94640	95640	What's the book about?
95640	96640	It's a zombie book.
96640	97640	Surprise.
97640	105640	Yeah, which is a little weird in and of itself for me because I am not a fan of zombie literature
105640	106640	or zombie anything really.
106640	112720	I think I've said this before in previous videos, but zombie stories are pretty much
112720	117720	the guilt-free story because you can have the bad guy that you don't have to think about
117720	119720	their motive or anything.
119720	124720	It's about survival, so you instantly have, well, there is your drama right there.
124720	126720	You don't have to think about it.
126720	129720	Even though in a lot of zombie things they try to make it, well, it's not about the zombies,
129720	132720	it's about the humans and how humanity falls apart.
132720	135720	It takes place on this sort of like science bunker.
135720	140720	So, while there are the mindless zombies, we also have these, you know, kids and they're
140720	145720	all children who for some reason have like mental capacity, sometimes genius level, as
145720	147720	in the case with our protagonist, Melanie.
147720	152720	And so basically it's like on this science camp trying to, you know, figure out why they
152720	154720	be the way they be.
154720	160720	And on the one hand we have the teacher character who is, you know, a woman.
160720	163720	She's awesome, I love her.
163720	167720	And she kind of sees them as little, you know, people, which they are.
167720	170720	And, you know, she's the teacher and they all really like her and they like learning
170720	171720	because they're kids.
171720	174720	But then there are like other characters, like the sergeant.
174720	177720	He's a huge racist against zombies and he doesn't see them as people.
177720	183720	And then there, of course, is like the Dr. Caldwell who is just like this sort of...
183720	188720	She's the mad scientist who is going to save humanity by not having any more children.
188720	190720	She's going to science the shit out of this.
190720	192720	And she's also a she.
192720	195720	It's like, so like our three main characters, like we were shocked to find out that this
195720	198720	wasn't written by a woman because like the three main characters are women.
198720	202720	It's like, you know, the moral center, Justino.
202720	203720	The mad scientist.
203720	205720	You never see female mad scientists.
205720	207720	Heartless female mad scientist.
207720	210720	Yeah, the girl with all the gifts, Melanie.
210720	211720	And she's what, ten years old?
211720	212720	Yeah, she's like ten-ish.
212720	214720	This is a ten-year-old zombie as the main character.
214720	215720	Yeah.
215720	218720	And I identified with her a little more than I should have.
218720	220720	And it's an adult book too.
220720	221720	Yeah.
221720	225720	Yeah, but what I also enjoyed is, you know, these characters start as you think characters
225720	227720	you've seen all before.
227720	231720	And then they all get those little twists that make them human.
231720	234720	And not just, well, here's the racist surgeon.
234720	237720	And here's the mad scientist lady who's...
237720	241720	And then our other guy who was obviously just brought in to die.
241720	242720	Well, yeah.
242720	245720	It's like the first day on the force.
245720	249720	It was his first day.
249720	251720	Yeah, there's other five main characters.
251720	252720	One of them is a red shirt.
252720	253720	See, that was something I could see coming.
253720	256720	It was like, the author clearly does not care about this story.
256720	259720	My favorite part of that was the character thought coming too.
259720	262720	He was like, I was kind of brought into this book to die.
262720	263720	And then he died.
263720	266720	And he's like, I knew it.
266720	267720	Hey, spoilers.
267720	268720	But then even with...
268720	269720	A lot of character death.
269720	270720	Justine.
270720	271720	Or Miss Justine.
271720	272720	Justine, I don't know.
272720	274720	Just, you know.
274720	278720	What I love is that it sets it, like, you think, oh, well here's the woman who can't
278720	282720	help but empathize with the scary bad thing.
282720	285720	And then it's like, but then her foil is also a woman.
285720	287720	Oh, my gosh.
287720	289720	And they do all start as archetypes.
289720	293720	And I found it a little Joss Whedon-y in that way, where everybody's a little
293720	298720	deeper than you thought they were in ways that you wouldn't necessarily expect.
298720	302720	But also, like, the fact that their gender-ness never comes into play as a
302720	303720	function in the story.
303720	304720	Yeah.
304720	305720	You know?
305720	307720	It's like the gender of, like, their gender is completely irrelevant.
307720	310720	And that's what we say when we just don't want cliché female characters.
310720	314720	It's like, especially in a story like this, it's just like so-and-so happens to
314720	321720	be a woman and, you know, is not acting in a stereotypical way vis-a-vis what
321720	326720	type of roles women are normally allowed to play in stories like these.
326720	328720	And I don't, like, I don't know how much we should talk about it because it's,
328720	333720	like, part of what made this book so, like, as close to flawless as a book is
333720	340720	going to get is that the payoff at the end was so perfectly built up and yet so
340720	342720	not predictable.
342720	343720	You know?
343720	347720	There's this point, and I think I can say this in a spoiler-free way, but there
347720	351720	is this point in the book about two or three pages from the end where you
351720	354720	realize that you're two or three pages from the end.
354720	358720	There is no satisfying way that this story could wrap up.
358720	363720	And, like, then it does in a way that I didn't see coming.
363720	366720	I'm sure there's somebody out there saying, oh, yeah, I totally saw that
366720	367720	coming.
367720	368720	Whatever.
368720	369720	No, you didn't.
369720	372720	Not only is it the perfect ending, but it also turns the entire rest of the
372720	376720	story retroactively into a completely different story than the one you thought
376720	379720	you were reading without making you feel cheated in the process.
379720	380720	Yes.
380720	383720	That kind of, like, perfectly sums up, like, why this went from just, like, good
383720	384720	adventure story.
384720	386720	I want to know what happens next to holy shit, you know?
386720	388720	It wasn't even a twist ending, because it wasn't.
388720	389720	No, it wasn't at all.
389720	391720	It was, like, damn.
391720	392720	You know?
392720	396720	And it really does invert that whole idea of in a zombie story where it's, like,
396720	399720	well, obviously the humans are the good, and this should survive.
399720	403720	Reading it, I ended up comparing a lot of it to The Last of Us, which is a
403720	405720	video game super popular.
405720	406720	You might not have heard of it.
406720	407720	I've heard of it.
407720	408720	I'm hip to the jazz.
408720	412720	The things that in my mind were comparing between the two was that they're very
412720	417720	intimate, small stories in a way, as much as there's a lot of travel and there
417720	421720	are big implications going on in the background.
421720	427720	I found myself comparing the ending choice between our main male character in
427720	432720	the video game versus our young female character in the book, and the book does
432720	434720	it so much better.
434720	436720	Do they do similar things?
436720	441720	They do, where there's a choice, not to get into spoilers, but there is a huge
441720	448720	choice to make, and the implication is the doom or, say, salvation of humanity.
448720	452720	And in the video game, I saw his choice coming.
452720	453720	In the book, I didn't.
453720	457720	And they're called Hungries in this book, which that's something I'm not a huge
457720	458720	fan of.
458720	459720	I don't know.
459720	464720	Well, I kind of was because I didn't go into this knowing that it was a zombie
464720	465720	book.
465720	470720	I was sent it by a friend, the same friend that introduced me and this other
470720	473720	Lindsay, and she was like, oh, you'll love this book.
473720	475720	I'm not telling you anything about it.
475720	479720	And so I was just like, meh, sure, and picked it up eight months later or
479720	480720	whatever it was.
480720	481720	I did the same thing.
481720	482720	Hey!
482720	483720	Because it was a zombie book.
483720	488720	And the camera, as it were, opens the story in such tight focus that you don't
488720	489720	actually see what's going on.
489720	494720	You actually think that you're reading a story about this girl who's an abused
494720	497720	captive or something like that, but it turns out they're just restraining her
497720	500720	because they're afraid she'll eat everyone, which is a legitimate fear.
500720	501720	Yeah.
501720	505720	And it slowly expands until you see what the base is and how it functions.
505720	510720	I'm not a huge, it just feels kind of unnatural to me when we must rename
510720	513720	things that are like, you know.
513720	516720	Where if it actually happened everyone would be like, yeah, they're zombies.
516720	517720	And then they were the zombies.
517720	519720	You know, it's like that was one thing that really kind of.
519720	520720	This one.
520720	521720	Oh.
521720	526720	This one that I really was not wild about was the fact that the aliens were
526720	527720	called the others.
527720	529720	And it's just like, no, they'd be called the fucking aliens.
529720	531720	It's like, come the fuck on, you know?
531720	532720	I haven't actually read that.
532720	533720	I didn't know.
533720	535720	Yeah, they're just like, oh no, it's an other.
535720	536720	It's like, it's an alien.
536720	538720	You would not say an other.
538720	539720	Yeah.
539720	542720	It's like, you would either name the species or you would call it a fucking
542720	543720	alien.
543720	544720	You know.
544720	546720	That's kind of how I felt about The Hungries.
546720	549720	I'm like, you would either give it a species name or you would call it a
549720	551720	fucking zombie because that's what it is.
551720	552720	I did actually.
552720	556720	I thought of Feed by Mira Grant, which is my all-time.
556720	557720	It's up there.
557720	558720	It's up there.
558720	559720	Hey, there it is.
559720	562720	My all-time favorite zombie horror series.
562720	565720	If you want zombie comedy, My Life is a White Trash Zombie by Diana
565720	566720	Rowland.
566720	567720	Go read it.
567720	572720	But zombie horror series, that one, they have all of the references.
572720	574720	All the references that we do.
574720	579720	Everybody cites Dawn of the Dead as the quintessential zombie movie because
579720	582720	that's the mythology that's closest to what actually happened.
582720	586720	As a result, everybody in the next generation of kids is suddenly named
586720	589720	George after George Romero, the savior of humanity, who taught us how to
589720	590720	fight zombies.
590720	592720	But we don't really get that in The Girl with All the Gifts.
592720	595720	They're Hungries and they're totally new for some reason.
595720	600720	I mean, for me it would work if we were just referring to the children that
600720	607720	way because not wanting to say the zombie word in front of them in case
607720	608720	they pick up on it.
608720	609720	Yeah.
609720	612720	I could see it being a code within the book.
612720	616720	Or to differentiate them from the adults who are the needless zombies.
616720	617720	But that's not the case.
617720	618720	Yeah.
618720	621720	Part of the reason we're being so vague about it is we know there are people
621720	623720	who haven't read it.
623720	626720	Normally we'll talk spoilers, but I don't want to with this book.
626720	627720	Yeah.
627720	630720	So definitely if you haven't read it yet, go out and read it.
630720	631720	Go.
631720	632720	Go forth.
632720	633720	Enjoy it.
633720	634720	Come back to the comments.
634720	635720	Tell us what you think.
635720	636720	If you haven't read it, come to the comments.
636720	637720	What did you think?
637720	638720	If you haven't read it, beware the comments.
638720	641720	But gush with us once you come back and read it.
641720	645720	That was my main takeaway with this book.
645720	650720	I'd never seen such a perfectly set up ending that was not predictable.
650720	655720	And I feel like even in saying that, it's kind of spoilery, but it is what it is.
655720	656720	Don't worry.
656720	657720	Just go for the ride.
657720	658720	You're going to love it and then you're going to cry.
658720	660720	And then if you're like us, you're going to be like,
660720	662720	I'll never write anything as good as this.
662720	663720	Yeah.
663720	668720	Well, and then you go to your computer and you delete everything you've ever written
668720	670720	and you start burning manuscripts.
670720	671720	Nope.
671720	672720	Nope.
672720	673720	I literally did that.
673720	674720	How did you know?
674720	676720	Kawhi bought it.
676720	679720	It's like I'm canceling my contract.
679720	681720	I'm not doing this anymore.
681720	683720	I'm back.
683720	688720	Well, speaking of other books, would you like to recommend next week's book?
688720	689720	I would.
689720	690720	I would.
690720	691720	Where is it?
691720	692720	Behind the iPad.
693720	697720	The next book that I don't think I'm reviewing, but I would if you guys would have me back.
697720	698720	Oh, yeah.
698720	700720	It would be like another gush fest.
700720	706720	Oh, yeah, totally, is my favorite book of 2014 that wasn't written by a friend of mine.
706720	711720	Although if you're A.S. King and you're watching this and you want to be my friend,
711720	715720	let's totally make that happen because holy shit.
715720	718720	This is called Glory O'Brien's History of the Future,
718720	725720	and it is amazing and feminist and literary without being pretentious, which I love.
725720	728720	Yeah, it's a gorgeous, gorgeous book.
728720	732720	Okay, so for the one after that, we're going to put it up to a vote.
732720	735720	Based on your suggestions on Twitter, we were going to do some graphic novels.
735720	738720	Believe it or not, there is no Transformers in here.
738720	740720	Next time.
740720	742720	Maybe one day.
742720	746720	Yeah, we wanted mainly either female-centric or female protagonists.
746720	749720	We only asked for ones that had trade paperbacks out just so it could be more book-like.
749720	751720	So here are your three options.
751720	755720	Go into the comments and vote for one, and then we will announce it when we review this book,
755720	758720	Glory O'Brien's History of the Future.
758720	762720	So your three options are Rat Queens, volume one through something.
762720	766720	Ms. Marvel, volume—I think there's only one.
766720	771720	Or, of course, Saga, which is up to volume five or six or something.
771720	773720	We're going to read the three Sagas.
773720	775720	We're going to read the three, and then we'll talk about it.
775720	777720	Basically, we'll just say whatever's on trade.
777720	778720	That's what we're going to talk about.
778720	782720	Although I'm going to go ahead and catch up on Ms. Marvel because number 12 is coming out tomorrow,
782720	788720	and Loki's the special guest, so we've got to see that.
788720	794720	So vote for which of the three, Ms. Marvel, Saga, or Rat Queens you want us to talk about,
794720	797720	and then we will announce it when we review this sucker.
797720	800720	Depending on how well the voting goes, we might do that from now on.
800720	805720	Hey. Hey, Lindsay. I'm really mad for you.
805720	811720	Oh, I've lost my mind over you.
811720	813720	We'll talk about—oh, yeah, and also—
813720	817720	I think this is a reference to another book we read one time.
817720	818720	Deja vu?
818720	819720	Yeah.
819720	821720	You should talk about our book one day.
821720	822720	Oh my god, yes.
822720	825720	This is from me to you.
825720	828720	Which also, by the way, of course, keep sending us your comments about what you want to see
828720	833720	in a live-in book two of the Viridian Saga,
833720	836720	as we are now fleshing out the outline for Realsies.
836720	838720	Yes, we are for Realsies. We're working on it, I promise.
838720	841720	All right, well, thank you so much for joining us, Other Lindsay.
841720	843720	Thank you for having me, and for the drinks.
843720	845720	I'm going to take this faster.
845720	848720	I'm savoring it.
848720	852720	And so we look forward to your comments, and we will see you next time.
855720	860720	We'll see you next time.
