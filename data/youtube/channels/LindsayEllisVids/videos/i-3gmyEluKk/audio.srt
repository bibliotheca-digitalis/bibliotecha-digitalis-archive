1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Well, the winner for the last poll was Jack the Ripper, which, of course, is an interesting choice.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,500
So, I hope you like ominous shots of feet in the dark and lots of women getting brutalized.

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,000
And, you know, I don't mean that in the fun way. Of course, it's always kind of a sexualized brutalization.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Most of it's from the 70s and 80s and looks like garbage, but, you know, fewer discretion advised.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,000
The Ripper case was a huge press sensation at the time,

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
especially given early speculation that he was an educated surgeon,

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
owing to his apparent knowledge of human anatomy,

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
which gave rise to the image of the upper-class fellow stalking the streets in a top hat and a cloak.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,500
Why did this guy stick in the public imagination in the way that other serial killers,

10
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,000
even more recent and infamous ones, haven't?

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's not like he was the only serial killer in Victorian England.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,500
But the biggie is the fact that this mega sensation, A, never got caught,

13
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,000
and B, his victims were all sex workers, which doubled the scandalous.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And so it entered the public consciousness as, like, the perfect scandalous thing.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You know, we've got women being brutalized, an unsolved mystery, a presumed upper-class villain,

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,500
and we don't even know who he is. It could be anybody.

17
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,000
So here's what we have to work off of.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,500
The five victims generally agreed to have been the work of a single killer known as Jack the Ripper were

19
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,000
Marianne Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes, and Mary Jane Kelly.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
These murders occurred between August and November of 1888,

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
all within a few streets of each other, and are collectively called the Canonical Five.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,500
There were actually six more murders between then and 1891, all women,

23
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,000
and may or may not be connected to the Ripper or might be copycats.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
There's actually a BBC show about the direct aftermath,

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
but I'm not really going to get into that one because it's about the direct aftermath.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,500
In a lot of these movies, they also include victim Elizabeth Smith as canonical.

27
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,500
And then there are six murders instead of five because Freemasons.

28
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,000
Chief Inspector Fred Epperlein and his contemporaries had a lot of suspects at the time.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
None of these went anywhere.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
In later years, we'd see suspects like Lewis Carroll, Winston Churchill's father, Lord Randolph Churchill.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
He was a Freemason, see?

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And Sir Arthur Conan Doyle because doctor.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,500
The Freemasons come up a lot.

34
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,000
Apparently, they're the precursors to the modern Illuminati,

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
except for the part where they actually exist.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Because, say it with me, the Illuminati isn't real.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Prince Albert Victor became a favorite theory after the 1970s

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,500
when British physician Thomas Stonewell published an article implying that he'd been driven mad by syphilis.

39
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,500
The idea that the Freemasons were involved with the royal family also became really popular in the 70s,

40
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,000
and we'll get to that.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Although, I swear to God, we could have had this thing happen like a hundred years later,

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,500
and there'd be all these like YouTube channels about how the Ripper killings were like a false flag operation for,

43
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't know, like, Brexit or, you know, they're trying to take away our guns, our England guns, somehow.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Anyway, I don't know.

45
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,500
One of the first fictive incarnations came in the form of Marie Belloc-Loundez's serial book,

46
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
The Lodger, published in serialized form between 1911 and 1913.

47
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,500
This wasn't a straight Jack the Ripper story per se.

48
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,500
It had only been about 20 years at the time.

49
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Hashtag too soon.

50
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,500
But the killer herein, called the Avenger, was clearly based on the Ripper.

51
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,500
This became the basis for one of Alfred Hitchcock's first films, also called The Lodger.

52
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,500
The eponymous Lodger is a house guest staying with a London couple

53
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,000
who eventually come to suspect him of doing the killings.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,500
In the original, he leaves and it's left ambivalent as to whether he was the killer or not.

55
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,500
In Hitchcock's version, turns out the Lodger is not the killer,

56
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,000
but was acting weird because he's a vigilante and he's actually trying to catch the killer.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
This story would go on to get remade four more times.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
By the 1950s, the Ripper was becoming a popular horror element.

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,500
A 1959 Hollywood movie simply titled Jack the Ripper is a standard whodunit

60
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,500
based on Leonard Matters' theory that he was an avenging doctor.

61
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Not just any doctor, avenging.

62
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,000
But where Matters' theory had it that the Ripper was mad about his son catching a venereal disease,

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,500
this being rooted in the fact that Catherine Edo's nose had been cut off,

64
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,000
which implies not only that she had syphilis, but that the Ripper wanted to postmortemly shame her for it.

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Because your nose rotting off is the syphilis thing.

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Was. We have penicillin now.

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
In this movie, he's mad because his son committed suicide after learning his lover was a prostitute.

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
By the 1960s, the Ripper was established in media as less as a man

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and more of a universal force of evil who could be adapted to suit any villainous niche.

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Here he is in a Western.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Cimarron's Strip was a Western that only lasted one season,

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
and in one episode, interestingly written by Harlan Ellison,

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
women start getting murdered.

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And, of course, they blame the native guy.

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Until a British dude comes along like, hey, this seems familiar.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He calls himself Jack the Ripper.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So maybe the Ripper skipped London and has been terrorizing his way across the American West.

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Things were getting too warm for him in London, so he came to America.

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I followed him.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You know who Jack the Ripper is.

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Who is he?

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm afraid I must keep that from you a little longer, Watson.

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Another trend that popped up around this time was Ripper vs. Sherlock Holmes.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The first movie version was 1965's A Study in Terror,

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
which starred John Neville as Sherlock and Donald Houston as Dr. Watson.

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
This one plays again off a presumed aristocratic villain.

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Any trade must be dishonorable.

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
A trade, sir?

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Oh, you do not throw shade at Watson like that.

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Of course, Sherlock figures out who did it,

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
but I find it more remarkable that he appears to be invulnerable.

92
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But how on earth did you get out of it, Holmes?

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You know my methods, Watson. I'm well known to be indestructible.

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What, are they really just gonna wave that off?

95
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Does Sherlock have Luke Cage powers?

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
There have been video games based on Sherlock vs. Ripper.

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
They even go head-to-head on our old friend...

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Celebrity Deathmatch.

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Super sleuth Sherlock Holmes takes on the poster boy for Prostitute Killers,

100
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Jack the Ripper!

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Boy, I love me some Celebrity Deathmatch.

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
A 1979 film called Murder by Decree once again pitted Sherlock,

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
this time played by Christopher Plummer, against the Ripper.

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But this one's a double crossover.

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
See, in 1978, this guy named Stephen Knight published a book called Jack the Ripper,

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The Final Solution, which pushed the so-called Royal Conspiracy.

107
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Though the culprit isn't poor syphilitic Prince Albert Victor.

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
While this theory is one of the more, you know, out there,

109
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
it's also one of the most popular.

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You know, presumably because it included everybody.

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The Freemasons, the Royals, a prostitute conspiracy, and a doctor.

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Proof that a woman was cynically taken in marriage.

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I have proof of the husband's name, that a child was born.

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I have proof that the woman was committed to an asylum by order of that same spivey.

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That, incidentally, is who did it in this theory.

116
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Sir William Gull, the Royal Physician.

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
See, there's a legitimate prince baby no one's supposed to know about,

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and also Albert has syphilis.

119
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And Sir Gull wants to hide this shame, so there's our motive, I guess.

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Would these injuries imply medical knowledge?

121
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This one, a two-part made-for-TV movie simply called Jack the Ripper,

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
stars Michael Caine as an alcoholic Inspector Eberlein

123
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
and coincided with the hundred-year anniversary of the murders.

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
This one is the most extensive adaptation based on the Night Conspiracy.

125
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Our story is based on extensive research.

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Including the official files by special permission of the Home Office.

127
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Wow. Okay.

128
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And like the Night Conspiracy, the killer is ultimately the Queen's personal surgeon, Sir William Gull.

129
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Who also does Darth Vader breath?

130
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Darth Vader breath.

131
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Our story is based on extensive research.

132
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The most well-known derived from the Stephen Knight theory is 2001's From Hell,

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
based on the comic book of the same name.

134
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
This time Eberlein, played by Johnny Depp, is an opium addict instead of an alcoholic,

135
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and apparently has psychic powers.

136
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
A repetitive code saturated with blood.

137
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You know, they used to burn men like you alive.

138
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah, this doesn't go anywhere.

139
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And Heather Graham plays Mary Kelly, the last of Jack's victims.

140
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Honestly, the thing I find the most remarkable about this version

141
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
is that Jack's victims are actual characters and not objects that exist solely to scream and then die.

142
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
In fact, Mary Kelly actually lives.

143
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Some hapless other lady is the one who gets killed and then they just kind of hide it.

144
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Also, John Merrick is here for some reason.

145
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yeah, that also goes nowhere.

146
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Anyway, as with the 88 version, the culprit turns out to be the Queen's surgeon, Sir William Gull.

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Something something masons, something something conspiracy,

148
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and who's Gull but Bilbo the Ripper.

149
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Nothing says menace like weird CGI evil eye black.

150
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
These symbols, the mitre, the pentacle star.

151
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So Mary Kelly lives the rest of her life out in secret with the secret royal conspiracy baby,

152
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and Eberlein dies in this version.

153
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Good night, sweet prince.

154
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I mean, the idea that these women all knew each other,

155
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
and they also knew some horrible secret,

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and someone killed them trying to protect the secret,

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
you know, it makes sense from a narrative standpoint.

158
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's just bullshit history.

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
One day, men will look back

160
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and say I gave birth to the 20th century.

161
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So for our next section, I'm going to make this the start of a new segment,

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
which I'm going to call, hey, 1970s, are you okay?

163
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
No, really, are you okay?

164
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And this will be the content warning-iest part.

165
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So again, viewer discretion advised.

166
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Ah, the 70s, when women being sexually brutalized on film was the new hotness.

167
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So Jack the Ripper movies were all the rage.

168
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
In Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde, Dr. Jekyll is played by a sort of proto-Crispin Glover

169
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
in a Jack the Ripper themed hammer horror.

170
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Female hormones are the key to the elixir of life, hypothesizes Jekyll.

171
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Hormones. Female hormones.

172
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And that's why we've got all these 200-year-old women running around.

173
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So in this version, Dr. Jekyll's syrup turns him into a woman.

174
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Beautiful, but evil.

175
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It is I who exists, Dr. Jekyll, not you.

176
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And in order to maintain the change, he needs a constant supply of female hormones from cadavers.

177
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Female cadavers.

178
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And, you know, he doesn't like killing, but Mrs. Hyde relishes killing.

179
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So basically, the Whitechapel murders were done by an evil trans woman.

180
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yeah.

181
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
In Hands of the Ripper, another hammer horror, hey, Jack had a daughter.

182
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And this daughter grows up to be a murderess after witnessing her father kill her mother as a child.

183
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Even when the killer is a woman, the women in these movies just can't catch a break.

184
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So Jack's daughter goes into like this Pavlovian feud triggered by shinies and kisses.

185
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And her hands turn into Ripper hands, and she murders her mother figures.

186
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
All of them.

187
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Poor child.

188
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Stop putting her in the same room as sympathetic mother figures.

189
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
She somehow even manages to kill a prostitute.

190
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Like, she just wanders down the road and finds one.

191
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yeah.

192
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Did you say anything, dear?

193
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
She said with her totally real and not-at-all-dubbed voice.

194
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
This one is an Italian-Spanish co-production,

195
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and rather than being a period piece, is a modern retelling.

196
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Okay.

197
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And this is what passed for erotic in the 70s.

198
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yep.

199
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Man, the erotic passion.

200
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Nothing hotter than a bored woman undressing.

201
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Ah!

202
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Okay.

203
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I hope all the murders in this movie end with that bass riff.

204
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Also because a serial killer targeting sex workers wasn't scandalous enough,

205
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
apparently this one's also a cannibal.

206
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But surely Jack the Ripper's dead, isn't he?

207
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Undoubtedly, or extremely old.

208
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Ah, the greatest detective Mayans of their day.

209
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
This one, also simply titled Jack the Ripper, is in German and dubbed into English.

210
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It takes a Fifty Shades of Grey approach,

211
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
with the I'm-mad-at-my-prostitute-mother-and-that's-why-I-rape-and-kill prostitutes.

212
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I am exactly like your mother.

213
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
A whore.

214
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Most of the movie's about Jack himself and his motivations and his tragic backstory

215
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
and how he's actually a nice doctor some of the time.

216
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Boy, do I not care.

217
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Of course, being German, this movie can and wants to get away with a lot more

218
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
than we see in, like, the Hammer horrors or the Italian-Spanish co-productions.

219
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Oh, yeah, this one also adds a lot of rape.

220
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
A lot of rape. I'm not gonna show it.

221
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Oh, but we didn't forget about you, 80s.

222
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If you want some 80s crack, we got your 80s crack.

223
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
So, it's the 100th anniversary of the Whitechapel murders,

224
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
and some copycat is killing ladies.

225
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And who's our prime suspect?

226
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's Baby James Spader.

227
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
They think he's the Ripper because he's a med student.

228
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And, as we all know, Jack the Ripper was a doctor.

229
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
But, uh-oh, how could it be him when he gets murdered?

230
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Well, fortunately, he has, like, a twin brother who is also played by James Spader.

231
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And so now twin Baby James Spader has to clear his brother's name,

232
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
save the girl, and find the real killer.

233
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
James Spader!

234
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Getting even more squirrely, then there's the subgenre of Jack the Supernatural Being.

235
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Now, here we have another soul in torment.

236
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Jack the Ripper.

237
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
When a wax museum features an exhibit about famous serial killers closes,

238
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
one curator begs to take the wax figures home.

239
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And he sympathizes a little too much with the wax figures.

240
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And we can only guess what devils pushed them to their bloody fate.

241
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So, he takes them home and keeps them all nice and air-conditioned.

242
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But his wife doesn't like it, and then she gets stabbed by the Jack the Ripper wax figure

243
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
when she tries to turn off the A.C.

244
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Who would believe me if I told them that you were killed by Jack the Ripper?

245
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
The war must have been pretty bad, huh?

246
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yeah, weird that it's shaped like a coffin.

247
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
The twist is a bit ripped from Psycho.

248
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The guy puts his action off on another entity, but...

249
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
No, Martin Sinistro, it was you.

250
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You murdered your wife.

251
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It was him the whole time.

252
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Only this time it's from the point of view of Norman Bates.

253
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It was you.

254
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
A more recent one comes from Grimm, which is a supernatural-based procedural,

255
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
kind of like Sleepy Hollow.

256
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
At the end of the fourth season, one of the protagonists is possessed by an entity

257
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
that turns out to be Jack the Ripper.

258
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And yeah, he kills prostitutes, which are...

259
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Just what I had in mind.

260
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Wow.

261
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Okay, I guess some people are into that.

262
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
They get him out by shooting the captain with rubber bullets

263
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
and tricking the entity into thinking its host was dead.

264
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Squirrely-er still,

265
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Jack the literal alien.

266
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
In a 1997 episode of The Outer Limits,

267
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Jack was a crusader for good, see?

268
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
These prostitutes are actually inhabited by an evil alien entity.

269
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Who are you?

270
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm a nightmare, Jack.

271
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You're not even of this world.

272
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Cary Elwes plays Dr. Jack York,

273
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
who, after figuring out there's an evil entity about,

274
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
takes it upon himself to kill it.

275
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And sometimes that means killing its hosts.

276
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Also, hi David Warner.

277
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Don't worry.

278
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You'll hardly feel a thing.

279
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
But he fails and basically gets framed for the murders

280
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
by a spiteful, bored alien.

281
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Nickname for mass murderer of women.

282
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Other Earth synonym,

283
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Jack the Ripper.

284
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
He pops up again in an episode of the original Star Trek.

285
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So apparently Scotty was involved in an explosion

286
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
caused by a woman in a previous episode,

287
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
resulting in his...

288
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Total resentment toward women.

289
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You know, I'm glad at least

290
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
someone is bringing that up.

291
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So basically, Jack the Ripper was a literal alien.

292
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It feeds on horror and fear.

293
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And I suspect preys on women

294
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
because women are more easily

295
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
and more deeply terrified.

296
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Wow. That's like some biotruth

297
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
or misogynist YouTuber logic there, Spock.

298
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Hatred of all that lives.

299
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Hatred of women.

300
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Oh, and then Jack the Ripper

301
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
takes over the Enterprise, but

302
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
since fear is the issue, they basically

303
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
save the day with Valium.

304
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
In a 1995 episode of Babylon 5,

305
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Jack isn't so much an alien as

306
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
was abducted by aliens

307
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and then made their inquisitor.

308
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
So basically, the Vorgons unfreeze him

309
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
whenever they need someone inquisited.

310
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And he's good at this torture thing, but

311
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
ultimately he just kind of really wants to teach a lesson.

312
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Aww, did we just get the seal of approval

313
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
from Jack the Ripper?

314
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Anyway, this is the only one where

315
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Jack apparently learned his lesson.

316
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Not sure how I feel about that.

317
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Well, piggybacking off of that,

318
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
we have Jack the Time Traveler.

319
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
In Time After Time, a less schlocky

320
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
addition to the 70s canon,

321
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Jack is played by, well hello again, David Warner,

322
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
who escapes to the modern, well

323
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
1979 modern, day in a time machine.

324
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And he is pursued by H.G. Wells,

325
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
played by Malcolm McDowell.

326
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And see, Jack likes it here in the 70s

327
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
because it's so much more violent

328
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
than 1888.

329
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Look at these looney tunes beating each other.

330
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Look at how violent.

331
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Ah, the time travel variation

332
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
on Modern Man is the real monster.

333
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Wow.

334
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That's deep, man.

335
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Fantasy Island is like this magical

336
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
realism show where people come to

337
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Mr. Rourke's Island to live out their fantasies.

338
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And Mr. Rourke is kind of like a

339
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
philanthropic, less creepy Hugh Hefner

340
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
with magic powers and also wants to teach you a lesson.

341
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And usually the fantasies are kind of goofy.

342
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Like, the other one in this episode is just

343
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
a guy who wants to be sexy and learns a lesson

344
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
about respecting women or something.

345
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
But this lady's fantasy is solving the Whitechapel murders.

346
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And Rourke's like, I don't know,

347
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
seems kind of dangerous.

348
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You sure you don't want, like, a makeover or something?

349
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
For your own sake, I must

350
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
urge you to reconsider.

351
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
No, at great personal risk, she figures out who Jack the Ripper is.

352
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And yeah, he's a doctor.

353
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
But oh no, he's found her time portal.

354
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It shows that Albert Fell

355
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
was abandoned by his mother.

356
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
She became a prostitute.

357
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
There it is. Oh, but don't worry,

358
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Ricardo Montalban to the rescue.

359
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I guess Montalban's steely gaze

360
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
was just too much for him.

361
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You just killed Jack the Ripper.

362
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
No, Catherine.

363
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I just became him.

364
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
A slight inversion of the regular time traveler,

365
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
this time the time cop goes back in time

366
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
to catch, well, not Jack the Ripper,

367
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
but a guy who killed and replaced

368
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Jack the Ripper.

369
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
He also killed people. So you have to go back in time

370
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
and make sure the replacement Jack doesn't screw up history

371
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
too much without altering history.

372
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And save Mary Kelly.

373
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Hey, you could always pull a From Hell and have a Mary Kelly

374
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
body double. Nope.

375
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Sorry, Mary Kelly. Then we have the

376
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
oddly specific yet strangely

377
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
common trope of Jack being

378
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
transported through time through some magical

379
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
artifact. A 1985

380
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
made-for-TV movie starring David

381
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Hasselhoff has him originally dying on

382
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
London Bridge, only to be transported to

383
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
modern day, well,

384
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
1985 modern day Arizona.

385
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Anyway, London Bridge was apparently

386
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
in real life relocated to Arizona.

387
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I assumed this was like a weird

388
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
plot contrivance made because Arizona is

389
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
cheaper to shoot your TV movie in than LA,

390
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
but nope. This is a thing that really

391
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
happened. An oil baron bought the

392
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
bridge, they deconstructed it brick by brick,

393
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
and reconstructed it in Lake Havasu

394
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
City, Arizona.

395
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Anyway, they missed the final stone until 1985

396
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
and it just happened to contain

397
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
the spirit of Jack the Ripper, wouldn't

398
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
you know. In 1985's The

399
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Ripper, Jack's spirit resides in an old

400
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
antique ring, and his spirit possesses

401
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
whomsoever is wearing it. In this case,

402
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
a college professor who happens to be teaching a

403
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
film studies course on famous crimes as

404
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
depicted on film. And finally, during

405
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
season 3 of Sleepy Hollow, the Ripper's spirit

406
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
is carried through...

407
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
We're not searching for a monster.

408
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
We're searching for a weapon.

409
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So there was a guy called

410
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
simply The Ripper running around in Ichabod's

411
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
time, which was about 100 years

412
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
before the historical Jack the Ripper.

413
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
He has gone by many names over the centuries.

414
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You might know him

415
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
as Jack the Ripper.

416
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Well, turns out The Ripper is like

417
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
an evil knife, and whoever

418
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
wields the knife, the knife builds on their

419
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
worst attributes. And the knife is also like

420
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
a vampire knife, absorbing the blood of

421
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
its victims. The method of defeat here

422
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
is that it stabs Ichabod, who

423
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
infects himself with malaria.

424
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Which is a weird resolution, because we know

425
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
OG Ripper stabbed some late-stage syphilitics,

426
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
so this is an interesting, uh,

427
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
way to go about it, all things considered.

428
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Eh, maybe that's what brought the original knife down too.

429
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
So, there we have it.

430
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
A lot of piggybacking off of common conspiracy

431
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
theories, but mostly

432
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
just weird shit.

433
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'll kill

434
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
all of you. And it

435
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
is kind of human nature to want to

436
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
ascribe some meaning to something so

437
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
horrible, but really,

438
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
it's just grasping at straws

439
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
for something that is ultimately meaningless.

440
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You know, there is no

441
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
grand conspiracy, the Freemasons

442
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
are just, you know, some dude's

443
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
social club, and the Illuminati

444
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
isn't real.

445
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Thank you for watching, and

446
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
please remember to like and subscribe,

447
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
because as you know, all YouTubers are contractually

448
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
obligated to remind you to do this thing

449
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
every single video.

450
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Thank you very much to my patrons

451
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
who helped make this entire series and

452
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
video making thing possible.

453
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I've been getting a lot of requests

454
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
to do more video essay type things,

455
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
so I'll work on that, but remember, those

456
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
take a lot longer than

457
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
your straight up loose cannon.

458
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And as for the people who keep asking me about the rent video,

459
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm working on it.

460
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Patience.
