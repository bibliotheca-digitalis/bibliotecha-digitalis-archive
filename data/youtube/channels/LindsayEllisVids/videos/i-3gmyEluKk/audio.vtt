00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Well, the winner for the last poll was Jack the Ripper, which, of course, is an interesting choice.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.500
So, I hope you like ominous shots of feet in the dark and lots of women getting brutalized.

00:21.500 --> 00:26.000
And, you know, I don't mean that in the fun way. Of course, it's always kind of a sexualized brutalization.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
Most of it's from the 70s and 80s and looks like garbage, but, you know, fewer discretion advised.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.000
The Ripper case was a huge press sensation at the time,

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
especially given early speculation that he was an educated surgeon,

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
owing to his apparent knowledge of human anatomy,

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
which gave rise to the image of the upper-class fellow stalking the streets in a top hat and a cloak.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.500
Why did this guy stick in the public imagination in the way that other serial killers,

00:50.500 --> 00:53.000
even more recent and infamous ones, haven't?

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
It's not like he was the only serial killer in Victorian England.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.500
But the biggie is the fact that this mega sensation, A, never got caught,

00:59.500 --> 01:03.000
and B, his victims were all sex workers, which doubled the scandalous.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
And so it entered the public consciousness as, like, the perfect scandalous thing.

01:08.000 --> 01:15.000
You know, we've got women being brutalized, an unsolved mystery, a presumed upper-class villain,

01:15.000 --> 01:18.500
and we don't even know who he is. It could be anybody.

01:18.500 --> 01:20.000
So here's what we have to work off of.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.500
The five victims generally agreed to have been the work of a single killer known as Jack the Ripper were

01:24.500 --> 01:29.000
Marianne Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes, and Mary Jane Kelly.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
These murders occurred between August and November of 1888,

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
all within a few streets of each other, and are collectively called the Canonical Five.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.500
There were actually six more murders between then and 1891, all women,

01:39.500 --> 01:43.000
and may or may not be connected to the Ripper or might be copycats.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
There's actually a BBC show about the direct aftermath,

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
but I'm not really going to get into that one because it's about the direct aftermath.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.500
In a lot of these movies, they also include victim Elizabeth Smith as canonical.

01:51.500 --> 01:55.500
And then there are six murders instead of five because Freemasons.

01:55.500 --> 02:00.000
Chief Inspector Fred Epperlein and his contemporaries had a lot of suspects at the time.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
None of these went anywhere.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
In later years, we'd see suspects like Lewis Carroll, Winston Churchill's father, Lord Randolph Churchill.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
He was a Freemason, see?

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
And Sir Arthur Conan Doyle because doctor.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.500
The Freemasons come up a lot.

02:16.500 --> 02:19.000
Apparently, they're the precursors to the modern Illuminati,

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
except for the part where they actually exist.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Because, say it with me, the Illuminati isn't real.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Prince Albert Victor became a favorite theory after the 1970s

02:29.000 --> 02:34.500
when British physician Thomas Stonewell published an article implying that he'd been driven mad by syphilis.

02:34.500 --> 02:39.500
The idea that the Freemasons were involved with the royal family also became really popular in the 70s,

02:39.500 --> 02:41.000
and we'll get to that.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
Although, I swear to God, we could have had this thing happen like a hundred years later,

02:45.000 --> 02:50.500
and there'd be all these like YouTube channels about how the Ripper killings were like a false flag operation for,

02:50.500 --> 02:58.000
I don't know, like, Brexit or, you know, they're trying to take away our guns, our England guns, somehow.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Anyway, I don't know.

02:59.500 --> 03:04.500
One of the first fictive incarnations came in the form of Marie Belloc-Loundez's serial book,

03:04.500 --> 03:08.500
The Lodger, published in serialized form between 1911 and 1913.

03:08.500 --> 03:11.500
This wasn't a straight Jack the Ripper story per se.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.500
It had only been about 20 years at the time.

03:13.500 --> 03:14.500
Hashtag too soon.

03:14.500 --> 03:18.500
But the killer herein, called the Avenger, was clearly based on the Ripper.

03:18.500 --> 03:22.500
This became the basis for one of Alfred Hitchcock's first films, also called The Lodger.

03:22.500 --> 03:25.500
The eponymous Lodger is a house guest staying with a London couple

03:25.500 --> 03:28.000
who eventually come to suspect him of doing the killings.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.500
In the original, he leaves and it's left ambivalent as to whether he was the killer or not.

03:31.500 --> 03:34.500
In Hitchcock's version, turns out the Lodger is not the killer,

03:34.500 --> 03:38.000
but was acting weird because he's a vigilante and he's actually trying to catch the killer.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
This story would go on to get remade four more times.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
By the 1950s, the Ripper was becoming a popular horror element.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.500
A 1959 Hollywood movie simply titled Jack the Ripper is a standard whodunit

03:48.500 --> 03:51.500
based on Leonard Matters' theory that he was an avenging doctor.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.500
Not just any doctor, avenging.

03:53.500 --> 03:58.000
But where Matters' theory had it that the Ripper was mad about his son catching a venereal disease,

03:58.000 --> 04:01.500
this being rooted in the fact that Catherine Edo's nose had been cut off,

04:01.500 --> 04:06.000
which implies not only that she had syphilis, but that the Ripper wanted to postmortemly shame her for it.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
Because your nose rotting off is the syphilis thing.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Was. We have penicillin now.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
In this movie, he's mad because his son committed suicide after learning his lover was a prostitute.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
By the 1960s, the Ripper was established in media as less as a man

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
and more of a universal force of evil who could be adapted to suit any villainous niche.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Here he is in a Western.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Cimarron's Strip was a Western that only lasted one season,

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
and in one episode, interestingly written by Harlan Ellison,

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
women start getting murdered.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
And, of course, they blame the native guy.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
Until a British dude comes along like, hey, this seems familiar.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
He calls himself Jack the Ripper.

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
So maybe the Ripper skipped London and has been terrorizing his way across the American West.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
Things were getting too warm for him in London, so he came to America.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
I followed him.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
You know who Jack the Ripper is.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Who is he?

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
I'm afraid I must keep that from you a little longer, Watson.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
Another trend that popped up around this time was Ripper vs. Sherlock Holmes.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
The first movie version was 1965's A Study in Terror,

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
which starred John Neville as Sherlock and Donald Houston as Dr. Watson.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
This one plays again off a presumed aristocratic villain.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Any trade must be dishonorable.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
A trade, sir?

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Oh, you do not throw shade at Watson like that.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Of course, Sherlock figures out who did it,

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
but I find it more remarkable that he appears to be invulnerable.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
But how on earth did you get out of it, Holmes?

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
You know my methods, Watson. I'm well known to be indestructible.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
What, are they really just gonna wave that off?

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Does Sherlock have Luke Cage powers?

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
There have been video games based on Sherlock vs. Ripper.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
They even go head-to-head on our old friend...

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Celebrity Deathmatch.

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
Super sleuth Sherlock Holmes takes on the poster boy for Prostitute Killers,

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Jack the Ripper!

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Boy, I love me some Celebrity Deathmatch.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
A 1979 film called Murder by Decree once again pitted Sherlock,

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
this time played by Christopher Plummer, against the Ripper.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
But this one's a double crossover.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
See, in 1978, this guy named Stephen Knight published a book called Jack the Ripper,

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
The Final Solution, which pushed the so-called Royal Conspiracy.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
Though the culprit isn't poor syphilitic Prince Albert Victor.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
While this theory is one of the more, you know, out there,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
it's also one of the most popular.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
You know, presumably because it included everybody.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
The Freemasons, the Royals, a prostitute conspiracy, and a doctor.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
Proof that a woman was cynically taken in marriage.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
I have proof of the husband's name, that a child was born.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
I have proof that the woman was committed to an asylum by order of that same spivey.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
That, incidentally, is who did it in this theory.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Sir William Gull, the Royal Physician.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
See, there's a legitimate prince baby no one's supposed to know about,

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
and also Albert has syphilis.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
And Sir Gull wants to hide this shame, so there's our motive, I guess.

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
Would these injuries imply medical knowledge?

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
This one, a two-part made-for-TV movie simply called Jack the Ripper,

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
stars Michael Caine as an alcoholic Inspector Eberlein

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
and coincided with the hundred-year anniversary of the murders.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
This one is the most extensive adaptation based on the Night Conspiracy.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Our story is based on extensive research.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
Including the official files by special permission of the Home Office.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Wow. Okay.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
And like the Night Conspiracy, the killer is ultimately the Queen's personal surgeon, Sir William Gull.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
Who also does Darth Vader breath?

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
Darth Vader breath.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Our story is based on extensive research.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
The most well-known derived from the Stephen Knight theory is 2001's From Hell,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
based on the comic book of the same name.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
This time Eberlein, played by Johnny Depp, is an opium addict instead of an alcoholic,

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
and apparently has psychic powers.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
A repetitive code saturated with blood.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
You know, they used to burn men like you alive.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Yeah, this doesn't go anywhere.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
And Heather Graham plays Mary Kelly, the last of Jack's victims.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
Honestly, the thing I find the most remarkable about this version

07:57.000 --> 08:04.000
is that Jack's victims are actual characters and not objects that exist solely to scream and then die.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
In fact, Mary Kelly actually lives.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
Some hapless other lady is the one who gets killed and then they just kind of hide it.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
Also, John Merrick is here for some reason.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Yeah, that also goes nowhere.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
Anyway, as with the 88 version, the culprit turns out to be the Queen's surgeon, Sir William Gull.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Something something masons, something something conspiracy,

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
and who's Gull but Bilbo the Ripper.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
Nothing says menace like weird CGI evil eye black.

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
These symbols, the mitre, the pentacle star.

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
So Mary Kelly lives the rest of her life out in secret with the secret royal conspiracy baby,

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
and Eberlein dies in this version.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Good night, sweet prince.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
I mean, the idea that these women all knew each other,

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
and they also knew some horrible secret,

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
and someone killed them trying to protect the secret,

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
you know, it makes sense from a narrative standpoint.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
It's just bullshit history.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
One day, men will look back

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
and say I gave birth to the 20th century.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
So for our next section, I'm going to make this the start of a new segment,

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
which I'm going to call, hey, 1970s, are you okay?

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
No, really, are you okay?

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
And this will be the content warning-iest part.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
So again, viewer discretion advised.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
Ah, the 70s, when women being sexually brutalized on film was the new hotness.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
So Jack the Ripper movies were all the rage.

09:35.000 --> 09:41.000
In Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde, Dr. Jekyll is played by a sort of proto-Crispin Glover

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
in a Jack the Ripper themed hammer horror.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
Female hormones are the key to the elixir of life, hypothesizes Jekyll.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Hormones. Female hormones.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
And that's why we've got all these 200-year-old women running around.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
So in this version, Dr. Jekyll's syrup turns him into a woman.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Beautiful, but evil.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
It is I who exists, Dr. Jekyll, not you.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
And in order to maintain the change, he needs a constant supply of female hormones from cadavers.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Female cadavers.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
And, you know, he doesn't like killing, but Mrs. Hyde relishes killing.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
So basically, the Whitechapel murders were done by an evil trans woman.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Yeah.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
In Hands of the Ripper, another hammer horror, hey, Jack had a daughter.

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
And this daughter grows up to be a murderess after witnessing her father kill her mother as a child.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
Even when the killer is a woman, the women in these movies just can't catch a break.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
So Jack's daughter goes into like this Pavlovian feud triggered by shinies and kisses.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
And her hands turn into Ripper hands, and she murders her mother figures.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
All of them.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Poor child.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
Stop putting her in the same room as sympathetic mother figures.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
She somehow even manages to kill a prostitute.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Like, she just wanders down the road and finds one.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Yeah.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Did you say anything, dear?

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
She said with her totally real and not-at-all-dubbed voice.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
This one is an Italian-Spanish co-production,

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
and rather than being a period piece, is a modern retelling.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Okay.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
And this is what passed for erotic in the 70s.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Yep.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
Man, the erotic passion.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
Nothing hotter than a bored woman undressing.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Ah!

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Okay.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
I hope all the murders in this movie end with that bass riff.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
Also because a serial killer targeting sex workers wasn't scandalous enough,

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
apparently this one's also a cannibal.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
But surely Jack the Ripper's dead, isn't he?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Undoubtedly, or extremely old.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
Ah, the greatest detective Mayans of their day.

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
This one, also simply titled Jack the Ripper, is in German and dubbed into English.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
It takes a Fifty Shades of Grey approach,

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
with the I'm-mad-at-my-prostitute-mother-and-that's-why-I-rape-and-kill prostitutes.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
I am exactly like your mother.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
A whore.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
Most of the movie's about Jack himself and his motivations and his tragic backstory

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
and how he's actually a nice doctor some of the time.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Boy, do I not care.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
Of course, being German, this movie can and wants to get away with a lot more

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
than we see in, like, the Hammer horrors or the Italian-Spanish co-productions.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Oh, yeah, this one also adds a lot of rape.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
A lot of rape. I'm not gonna show it.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Oh, but we didn't forget about you, 80s.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
If you want some 80s crack, we got your 80s crack.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
So, it's the 100th anniversary of the Whitechapel murders,

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
and some copycat is killing ladies.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
And who's our prime suspect?

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
It's Baby James Spader.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
They think he's the Ripper because he's a med student.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
And, as we all know, Jack the Ripper was a doctor.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
But, uh-oh, how could it be him when he gets murdered?

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
Well, fortunately, he has, like, a twin brother who is also played by James Spader.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
And so now twin Baby James Spader has to clear his brother's name,

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
save the girl, and find the real killer.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
James Spader!

13:22.000 --> 13:27.000
Getting even more squirrely, then there's the subgenre of Jack the Supernatural Being.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
Now, here we have another soul in torment.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Jack the Ripper.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
When a wax museum features an exhibit about famous serial killers closes,

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
one curator begs to take the wax figures home.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
And he sympathizes a little too much with the wax figures.

13:41.000 --> 13:47.000
And we can only guess what devils pushed them to their bloody fate.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
So, he takes them home and keeps them all nice and air-conditioned.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
But his wife doesn't like it, and then she gets stabbed by the Jack the Ripper wax figure

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
when she tries to turn off the A.C.

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
Who would believe me if I told them that you were killed by Jack the Ripper?

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
The war must have been pretty bad, huh?

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Yeah, weird that it's shaped like a coffin.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
The twist is a bit ripped from Psycho.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
The guy puts his action off on another entity, but...

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
No, Martin Sinistro, it was you.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
You murdered your wife.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
It was him the whole time.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Only this time it's from the point of view of Norman Bates.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
It was you.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
A more recent one comes from Grimm, which is a supernatural-based procedural,

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
kind of like Sleepy Hollow.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
At the end of the fourth season, one of the protagonists is possessed by an entity

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
that turns out to be Jack the Ripper.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
And yeah, he kills prostitutes, which are...

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Just what I had in mind.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Wow.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
Okay, I guess some people are into that.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
They get him out by shooting the captain with rubber bullets

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
and tricking the entity into thinking its host was dead.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Squirrely-er still,

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Jack the literal alien.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
In a 1997 episode of The Outer Limits,

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Jack was a crusader for good, see?

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
These prostitutes are actually inhabited by an evil alien entity.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Who are you?

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
I'm a nightmare, Jack.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
You're not even of this world.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Cary Elwes plays Dr. Jack York,

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
who, after figuring out there's an evil entity about,

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
takes it upon himself to kill it.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
And sometimes that means killing its hosts.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Also, hi David Warner.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Don't worry.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
You'll hardly feel a thing.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
But he fails and basically gets framed for the murders

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
by a spiteful, bored alien.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
Nickname for mass murderer of women.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Other Earth synonym,

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Jack the Ripper.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
He pops up again in an episode of the original Star Trek.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
So apparently Scotty was involved in an explosion

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
caused by a woman in a previous episode,

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
resulting in his...

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Total resentment toward women.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
You know, I'm glad at least

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
someone is bringing that up.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
So basically, Jack the Ripper was a literal alien.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
It feeds on horror and fear.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
And I suspect preys on women

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
because women are more easily

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
and more deeply terrified.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Wow. That's like some biotruth

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
or misogynist YouTuber logic there, Spock.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Hatred of all that lives.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Hatred of women.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Oh, and then Jack the Ripper

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
takes over the Enterprise, but

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
since fear is the issue, they basically

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
save the day with Valium.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
In a 1995 episode of Babylon 5,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Jack isn't so much an alien as

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
was abducted by aliens

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
and then made their inquisitor.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
So basically, the Vorgons unfreeze him

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
whenever they need someone inquisited.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
And he's good at this torture thing, but

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
ultimately he just kind of really wants to teach a lesson.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Aww, did we just get the seal of approval

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
from Jack the Ripper?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Anyway, this is the only one where

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Jack apparently learned his lesson.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Not sure how I feel about that.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Well, piggybacking off of that,

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
we have Jack the Time Traveler.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
In Time After Time, a less schlocky

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
addition to the 70s canon,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Jack is played by, well hello again, David Warner,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
who escapes to the modern, well

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
1979 modern, day in a time machine.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
And he is pursued by H.G. Wells,

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
played by Malcolm McDowell.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
And see, Jack likes it here in the 70s

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
because it's so much more violent

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
than 1888.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Look at these looney tunes beating each other.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Look at how violent.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Ah, the time travel variation

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
on Modern Man is the real monster.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
Wow.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
That's deep, man.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Fantasy Island is like this magical

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
realism show where people come to

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Mr. Rourke's Island to live out their fantasies.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
And Mr. Rourke is kind of like a

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
philanthropic, less creepy Hugh Hefner

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
with magic powers and also wants to teach you a lesson.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
And usually the fantasies are kind of goofy.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Like, the other one in this episode is just

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
a guy who wants to be sexy and learns a lesson

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
about respecting women or something.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
But this lady's fantasy is solving the Whitechapel murders.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
And Rourke's like, I don't know,

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
seems kind of dangerous.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
You sure you don't want, like, a makeover or something?

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
For your own sake, I must

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
urge you to reconsider.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
No, at great personal risk, she figures out who Jack the Ripper is.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
And yeah, he's a doctor.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
But oh no, he's found her time portal.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
It shows that Albert Fell

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
was abandoned by his mother.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
She became a prostitute.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
There it is. Oh, but don't worry,

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Ricardo Montalban to the rescue.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
I guess Montalban's steely gaze

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
was just too much for him.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
You just killed Jack the Ripper.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
No, Catherine.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
I just became him.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
A slight inversion of the regular time traveler,

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
this time the time cop goes back in time

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
to catch, well, not Jack the Ripper,

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
but a guy who killed and replaced

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Jack the Ripper.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
He also killed people. So you have to go back in time

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
and make sure the replacement Jack doesn't screw up history

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
too much without altering history.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
And save Mary Kelly.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Hey, you could always pull a From Hell and have a Mary Kelly

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
body double. Nope.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Sorry, Mary Kelly. Then we have the

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
oddly specific yet strangely

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
common trope of Jack being

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
transported through time through some magical

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
artifact. A 1985

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
made-for-TV movie starring David

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Hasselhoff has him originally dying on

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
London Bridge, only to be transported to

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
modern day, well,

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
1985 modern day Arizona.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Anyway, London Bridge was apparently

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
in real life relocated to Arizona.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I assumed this was like a weird

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
plot contrivance made because Arizona is

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
cheaper to shoot your TV movie in than LA,

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
but nope. This is a thing that really

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
happened. An oil baron bought the

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
bridge, they deconstructed it brick by brick,

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
and reconstructed it in Lake Havasu

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
City, Arizona.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Anyway, they missed the final stone until 1985

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
and it just happened to contain

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
the spirit of Jack the Ripper, wouldn't

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
you know. In 1985's The

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Ripper, Jack's spirit resides in an old

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
antique ring, and his spirit possesses

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
whomsoever is wearing it. In this case,

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
a college professor who happens to be teaching a

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
film studies course on famous crimes as

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
depicted on film. And finally, during

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
season 3 of Sleepy Hollow, the Ripper's spirit

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
is carried through...

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
We're not searching for a monster.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
We're searching for a weapon.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
So there was a guy called

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
simply The Ripper running around in Ichabod's

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
time, which was about 100 years

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
before the historical Jack the Ripper.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
He has gone by many names over the centuries.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
You might know him

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
as Jack the Ripper.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Well, turns out The Ripper is like

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
an evil knife, and whoever

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
wields the knife, the knife builds on their

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
worst attributes. And the knife is also like

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
a vampire knife, absorbing the blood of

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
its victims. The method of defeat here

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
is that it stabs Ichabod, who

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
infects himself with malaria.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Which is a weird resolution, because we know

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
OG Ripper stabbed some late-stage syphilitics,

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
so this is an interesting, uh,

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
way to go about it, all things considered.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Eh, maybe that's what brought the original knife down too.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
So, there we have it.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
A lot of piggybacking off of common conspiracy

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
theories, but mostly

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
just weird shit.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
I'll kill

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
all of you. And it

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
is kind of human nature to want to

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
ascribe some meaning to something so

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
horrible, but really,

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
it's just grasping at straws

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
for something that is ultimately meaningless.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
You know, there is no

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
grand conspiracy, the Freemasons

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
are just, you know, some dude's

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
social club, and the Illuminati

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
isn't real.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Thank you for watching, and

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
please remember to like and subscribe,

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000

obligated to remind you to do this thing

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Thank you very much to my patrons

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
who helped make this entire series and

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
video making thing possible.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
I've been getting a lot of requests

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
to do more video essay type things,

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
so I'll work on that, but remember, those

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
take a lot longer than

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
your straight up loose cannon.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
And as for the people who keep asking me about the rent video,

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
I'm working on it.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Patience.
