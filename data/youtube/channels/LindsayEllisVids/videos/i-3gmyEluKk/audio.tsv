0	6000	Well, the winner for the last poll was Jack the Ripper, which, of course, is an interesting choice.
6000	12500	So, I hope you like ominous shots of feet in the dark and lots of women getting brutalized.
21500	26000	And, you know, I don't mean that in the fun way. Of course, it's always kind of a sexualized brutalization.
26000	32000	Most of it's from the 70s and 80s and looks like garbage, but, you know, fewer discretion advised.
33500	36000	The Ripper case was a huge press sensation at the time,
36000	39000	especially given early speculation that he was an educated surgeon,
39000	41000	owing to his apparent knowledge of human anatomy,
41000	46000	which gave rise to the image of the upper-class fellow stalking the streets in a top hat and a cloak.
46000	50500	Why did this guy stick in the public imagination in the way that other serial killers,
50500	53000	even more recent and infamous ones, haven't?
53000	56000	It's not like he was the only serial killer in Victorian England.
56000	59500	But the biggie is the fact that this mega sensation, A, never got caught,
59500	63000	and B, his victims were all sex workers, which doubled the scandalous.
63000	68000	And so it entered the public consciousness as, like, the perfect scandalous thing.
68000	75000	You know, we've got women being brutalized, an unsolved mystery, a presumed upper-class villain,
75000	78500	and we don't even know who he is. It could be anybody.
78500	80000	So here's what we have to work off of.
80000	84500	The five victims generally agreed to have been the work of a single killer known as Jack the Ripper were
84500	89000	Marianne Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes, and Mary Jane Kelly.
89000	92000	These murders occurred between August and November of 1888,
92000	96000	all within a few streets of each other, and are collectively called the Canonical Five.
96000	99500	There were actually six more murders between then and 1891, all women,
99500	103000	and may or may not be connected to the Ripper or might be copycats.
103000	105000	There's actually a BBC show about the direct aftermath,
105000	108000	but I'm not really going to get into that one because it's about the direct aftermath.
108000	111500	In a lot of these movies, they also include victim Elizabeth Smith as canonical.
111500	115500	And then there are six murders instead of five because Freemasons.
115500	120000	Chief Inspector Fred Epperlein and his contemporaries had a lot of suspects at the time.
120000	122000	None of these went anywhere.
122000	128000	In later years, we'd see suspects like Lewis Carroll, Winston Churchill's father, Lord Randolph Churchill.
128000	130000	He was a Freemason, see?
130000	135000	And Sir Arthur Conan Doyle because doctor.
135000	136500	The Freemasons come up a lot.
136500	139000	Apparently, they're the precursors to the modern Illuminati,
139000	141000	except for the part where they actually exist.
141000	145000	Because, say it with me, the Illuminati isn't real.
146000	149000	Prince Albert Victor became a favorite theory after the 1970s
149000	154500	when British physician Thomas Stonewell published an article implying that he'd been driven mad by syphilis.
154500	159500	The idea that the Freemasons were involved with the royal family also became really popular in the 70s,
159500	161000	and we'll get to that.
161000	165000	Although, I swear to God, we could have had this thing happen like a hundred years later,
165000	170500	and there'd be all these like YouTube channels about how the Ripper killings were like a false flag operation for,
170500	178000	I don't know, like, Brexit or, you know, they're trying to take away our guns, our England guns, somehow.
178000	179000	Anyway, I don't know.
179500	184500	One of the first fictive incarnations came in the form of Marie Belloc-Loundez's serial book,
184500	188500	The Lodger, published in serialized form between 1911 and 1913.
188500	191500	This wasn't a straight Jack the Ripper story per se.
191500	193500	It had only been about 20 years at the time.
193500	194500	Hashtag too soon.
194500	198500	But the killer herein, called the Avenger, was clearly based on the Ripper.
198500	202500	This became the basis for one of Alfred Hitchcock's first films, also called The Lodger.
202500	205500	The eponymous Lodger is a house guest staying with a London couple
205500	208000	who eventually come to suspect him of doing the killings.
208000	211500	In the original, he leaves and it's left ambivalent as to whether he was the killer or not.
211500	214500	In Hitchcock's version, turns out the Lodger is not the killer,
214500	218000	but was acting weird because he's a vigilante and he's actually trying to catch the killer.
218000	221000	This story would go on to get remade four more times.
221000	224000	By the 1950s, the Ripper was becoming a popular horror element.
224000	228500	A 1959 Hollywood movie simply titled Jack the Ripper is a standard whodunit
228500	231500	based on Leonard Matters' theory that he was an avenging doctor.
231500	233500	Not just any doctor, avenging.
233500	238000	But where Matters' theory had it that the Ripper was mad about his son catching a venereal disease,
238000	241500	this being rooted in the fact that Catherine Edo's nose had been cut off,
241500	246000	which implies not only that she had syphilis, but that the Ripper wanted to postmortemly shame her for it.
246000	250000	Because your nose rotting off is the syphilis thing.
250000	252000	Was. We have penicillin now.
252000	257000	In this movie, he's mad because his son committed suicide after learning his lover was a prostitute.
257000	261000	By the 1960s, the Ripper was established in media as less as a man
261000	266000	and more of a universal force of evil who could be adapted to suit any villainous niche.
266000	267000	Here he is in a Western.
267000	270000	Cimarron's Strip was a Western that only lasted one season,
270000	273000	and in one episode, interestingly written by Harlan Ellison,
273000	275000	women start getting murdered.
275000	278000	And, of course, they blame the native guy.
278000	282000	Until a British dude comes along like, hey, this seems familiar.
282000	284000	He calls himself Jack the Ripper.
284000	289000	So maybe the Ripper skipped London and has been terrorizing his way across the American West.
289000	293000	Things were getting too warm for him in London, so he came to America.
293000	294000	I followed him.
294000	297000	You know who Jack the Ripper is.
297000	299000	Who is he?
299000	302000	I'm afraid I must keep that from you a little longer, Watson.
302000	306000	Another trend that popped up around this time was Ripper vs. Sherlock Holmes.
306000	310000	The first movie version was 1965's A Study in Terror,
310000	314000	which starred John Neville as Sherlock and Donald Houston as Dr. Watson.
314000	317000	This one plays again off a presumed aristocratic villain.
317000	319000	Any trade must be dishonorable.
319000	321000	A trade, sir?
321000	323000	Oh, you do not throw shade at Watson like that.
323000	325000	Of course, Sherlock figures out who did it,
325000	328000	but I find it more remarkable that he appears to be invulnerable.
328000	330000	But how on earth did you get out of it, Holmes?
330000	333000	You know my methods, Watson. I'm well known to be indestructible.
333000	335000	What, are they really just gonna wave that off?
335000	337000	Does Sherlock have Luke Cage powers?
337000	340000	There have been video games based on Sherlock vs. Ripper.
340000	343000	They even go head-to-head on our old friend...
343000	345000	Celebrity Deathmatch.
345000	350000	Super sleuth Sherlock Holmes takes on the poster boy for Prostitute Killers,
350000	351000	Jack the Ripper!
351000	353000	Boy, I love me some Celebrity Deathmatch.
353000	357000	A 1979 film called Murder by Decree once again pitted Sherlock,
357000	360000	this time played by Christopher Plummer, against the Ripper.
360000	362000	But this one's a double crossover.
362000	366000	See, in 1978, this guy named Stephen Knight published a book called Jack the Ripper,
366000	370000	The Final Solution, which pushed the so-called Royal Conspiracy.
370000	373000	Though the culprit isn't poor syphilitic Prince Albert Victor.
373000	376000	While this theory is one of the more, you know, out there,
376000	378000	it's also one of the most popular.
378000	382000	You know, presumably because it included everybody.
382000	386000	The Freemasons, the Royals, a prostitute conspiracy, and a doctor.
386000	389000	Proof that a woman was cynically taken in marriage.
389000	392000	I have proof of the husband's name, that a child was born.
392000	396000	I have proof that the woman was committed to an asylum by order of that same spivey.
396000	398000	That, incidentally, is who did it in this theory.
398000	400000	Sir William Gull, the Royal Physician.
400000	403000	See, there's a legitimate prince baby no one's supposed to know about,
403000	405000	and also Albert has syphilis.
405000	408000	And Sir Gull wants to hide this shame, so there's our motive, I guess.
408000	413000	Would these injuries imply medical knowledge?
413000	416000	This one, a two-part made-for-TV movie simply called Jack the Ripper,
416000	419000	stars Michael Caine as an alcoholic Inspector Eberlein
419000	422000	and coincided with the hundred-year anniversary of the murders.
422000	425000	This one is the most extensive adaptation based on the Night Conspiracy.
425000	428000	Our story is based on extensive research.
428000	432000	Including the official files by special permission of the Home Office.
432000	434000	Wow. Okay.
434000	439000	And like the Night Conspiracy, the killer is ultimately the Queen's personal surgeon, Sir William Gull.
439000	442000	Who also does Darth Vader breath?
442000	447000	Darth Vader breath.
447000	449000	Our story is based on extensive research.
449000	453000	The most well-known derived from the Stephen Knight theory is 2001's From Hell,
453000	455000	based on the comic book of the same name.
455000	459000	This time Eberlein, played by Johnny Depp, is an opium addict instead of an alcoholic,
459000	463000	and apparently has psychic powers.
463000	467000	A repetitive code saturated with blood.
467000	470000	You know, they used to burn men like you alive.
470000	471000	Yeah, this doesn't go anywhere.
471000	474000	And Heather Graham plays Mary Kelly, the last of Jack's victims.
474000	477000	Honestly, the thing I find the most remarkable about this version
477000	484000	is that Jack's victims are actual characters and not objects that exist solely to scream and then die.
484000	486000	In fact, Mary Kelly actually lives.
486000	490000	Some hapless other lady is the one who gets killed and then they just kind of hide it.
490000	493000	Also, John Merrick is here for some reason.
493000	495000	Yeah, that also goes nowhere.
495000	500000	Anyway, as with the 88 version, the culprit turns out to be the Queen's surgeon, Sir William Gull.
500000	503000	Something something masons, something something conspiracy,
503000	507000	and who's Gull but Bilbo the Ripper.
508000	513000	Nothing says menace like weird CGI evil eye black.
513000	518000	These symbols, the mitre, the pentacle star.
518000	523000	So Mary Kelly lives the rest of her life out in secret with the secret royal conspiracy baby,
523000	526000	and Eberlein dies in this version.
526000	528000	Good night, sweet prince.
528000	532000	I mean, the idea that these women all knew each other,
532000	535000	and they also knew some horrible secret,
535000	537000	and someone killed them trying to protect the secret,
537000	540000	you know, it makes sense from a narrative standpoint.
541000	543000	It's just bullshit history.
543000	546000	One day, men will look back
548000	552000	and say I gave birth to the 20th century.
552000	556000	So for our next section, I'm going to make this the start of a new segment,
556000	562000	which I'm going to call, hey, 1970s, are you okay?
562000	564000	No, really, are you okay?
564000	566000	And this will be the content warning-iest part.
566000	568000	So again, viewer discretion advised.
568000	573000	Ah, the 70s, when women being sexually brutalized on film was the new hotness.
573000	575000	So Jack the Ripper movies were all the rage.
575000	581000	In Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde, Dr. Jekyll is played by a sort of proto-Crispin Glover
581000	583000	in a Jack the Ripper themed hammer horror.
583000	587000	Female hormones are the key to the elixir of life, hypothesizes Jekyll.
587000	590000	Hormones. Female hormones.
590000	593000	And that's why we've got all these 200-year-old women running around.
593000	596000	So in this version, Dr. Jekyll's syrup turns him into a woman.
596000	598000	Beautiful, but evil.
598000	602000	It is I who exists, Dr. Jekyll, not you.
602000	606000	And in order to maintain the change, he needs a constant supply of female hormones from cadavers.
606000	608000	Female cadavers.
608000	612000	And, you know, he doesn't like killing, but Mrs. Hyde relishes killing.
612000	617000	So basically, the Whitechapel murders were done by an evil trans woman.
617000	618000	Yeah.
618000	622000	In Hands of the Ripper, another hammer horror, hey, Jack had a daughter.
622000	627000	And this daughter grows up to be a murderess after witnessing her father kill her mother as a child.
630000	634000	Even when the killer is a woman, the women in these movies just can't catch a break.
634000	639000	So Jack's daughter goes into like this Pavlovian feud triggered by shinies and kisses.
640000	644000	And her hands turn into Ripper hands, and she murders her mother figures.
644000	645000	All of them.
646000	648000	Poor child.
648000	652000	Stop putting her in the same room as sympathetic mother figures.
652000	655000	She somehow even manages to kill a prostitute.
655000	658000	Like, she just wanders down the road and finds one.
658000	659000	Yeah.
659000	661000	Did you say anything, dear?
661000	664000	She said with her totally real and not-at-all-dubbed voice.
664000	666000	This one is an Italian-Spanish co-production,
666000	669000	and rather than being a period piece, is a modern retelling.
671000	673000	Okay.
675000	678000	And this is what passed for erotic in the 70s.
680000	682000	Yep.
682000	686000	Man, the erotic passion.
686000	689000	Nothing hotter than a bored woman undressing.
689000	691000	Ah!
695000	697000	Okay.
697000	700000	I hope all the murders in this movie end with that bass riff.
710000	714000	Also because a serial killer targeting sex workers wasn't scandalous enough,
714000	716000	apparently this one's also a cannibal.
716000	718000	But surely Jack the Ripper's dead, isn't he?
718000	720000	Undoubtedly, or extremely old.
720000	723000	Ah, the greatest detective Mayans of their day.
723000	728000	This one, also simply titled Jack the Ripper, is in German and dubbed into English.
728000	730000	It takes a Fifty Shades of Grey approach,
730000	735000	with the I'm-mad-at-my-prostitute-mother-and-that's-why-I-rape-and-kill prostitutes.
735000	738000	I am exactly like your mother.
738000	740000	A whore.
740000	744000	Most of the movie's about Jack himself and his motivations and his tragic backstory
744000	746000	and how he's actually a nice doctor some of the time.
746000	748000	Boy, do I not care.
748000	752000	Of course, being German, this movie can and wants to get away with a lot more
752000	757000	than we see in, like, the Hammer horrors or the Italian-Spanish co-productions.
757000	759000	Oh, yeah, this one also adds a lot of rape.
759000	762000	A lot of rape. I'm not gonna show it.
764000	766000	Oh, but we didn't forget about you, 80s.
771000	773000	If you want some 80s crack, we got your 80s crack.
773000	775000	So, it's the 100th anniversary of the Whitechapel murders,
775000	778000	and some copycat is killing ladies.
778000	780000	And who's our prime suspect?
780000	783000	It's Baby James Spader.
783000	785000	They think he's the Ripper because he's a med student.
785000	788000	And, as we all know, Jack the Ripper was a doctor.
788000	790000	But, uh-oh, how could it be him when he gets murdered?
790000	794000	Well, fortunately, he has, like, a twin brother who is also played by James Spader.
794000	798000	And so now twin Baby James Spader has to clear his brother's name,
798000	800000	save the girl, and find the real killer.
801000	802000	James Spader!
802000	807000	Getting even more squirrely, then there's the subgenre of Jack the Supernatural Being.
807000	810000	Now, here we have another soul in torment.
810000	812000	Jack the Ripper.
812000	816000	When a wax museum features an exhibit about famous serial killers closes,
816000	819000	one curator begs to take the wax figures home.
819000	821000	And he sympathizes a little too much with the wax figures.
821000	827000	And we can only guess what devils pushed them to their bloody fate.
827000	830000	So, he takes them home and keeps them all nice and air-conditioned.
830000	835000	But his wife doesn't like it, and then she gets stabbed by the Jack the Ripper wax figure
835000	837000	when she tries to turn off the A.C.
837000	841000	Who would believe me if I told them that you were killed by Jack the Ripper?
841000	843000	The war must have been pretty bad, huh?
843000	845000	Yeah, weird that it's shaped like a coffin.
845000	847000	The twist is a bit ripped from Psycho.
847000	850000	The guy puts his action off on another entity, but...
850000	852000	No, Martin Sinistro, it was you.
852000	854000	You murdered your wife.
854000	856000	It was him the whole time.
856000	858000	Only this time it's from the point of view of Norman Bates.
858000	860000	It was you.
860000	864000	A more recent one comes from Grimm, which is a supernatural-based procedural,
864000	866000	kind of like Sleepy Hollow.
866000	869000	At the end of the fourth season, one of the protagonists is possessed by an entity
869000	871000	that turns out to be Jack the Ripper.
871000	873000	And yeah, he kills prostitutes, which are...
875000	877000	Just what I had in mind.
877000	879000	Wow.
879000	882000	Okay, I guess some people are into that.
882000	884000	They get him out by shooting the captain with rubber bullets
884000	887000	and tricking the entity into thinking its host was dead.
887000	889000	Squirrely-er still,
889000	891000	Jack the literal alien.
891000	894000	In a 1997 episode of The Outer Limits,
894000	896000	Jack was a crusader for good, see?
896000	899000	These prostitutes are actually inhabited by an evil alien entity.
899000	901000	Who are you?
901000	903000	I'm a nightmare, Jack.
903000	905000	You're not even of this world.
905000	907000	Cary Elwes plays Dr. Jack York,
907000	909000	who, after figuring out there's an evil entity about,
909000	911000	takes it upon himself to kill it.
911000	913000	And sometimes that means killing its hosts.
913000	915000	Also, hi David Warner.
915000	917000	Don't worry.
917000	919000	You'll hardly feel a thing.
919000	922000	But he fails and basically gets framed for the murders
922000	924000	by a spiteful, bored alien.
924000	927000	Nickname for mass murderer of women.
927000	929000	Other Earth synonym,
929000	931000	Jack the Ripper.
931000	934000	He pops up again in an episode of the original Star Trek.
934000	936000	So apparently Scotty was involved in an explosion
936000	938000	caused by a woman in a previous episode,
938000	940000	resulting in his...
940000	942000	Total resentment toward women.
942000	944000	You know, I'm glad at least
944000	946000	someone is bringing that up.
946000	949000	So basically, Jack the Ripper was a literal alien.
949000	952000	It feeds on horror and fear.
952000	954000	And I suspect preys on women
954000	956000	because women are more easily
956000	958000	and more deeply terrified.
958000	960000	Wow. That's like some biotruth
960000	962000	or misogynist YouTuber logic there, Spock.
962000	964000	Hatred of all that lives.
964000	966000	Hatred of women.
966000	968000	Oh, and then Jack the Ripper
968000	970000	takes over the Enterprise, but
970000	972000	since fear is the issue, they basically
972000	974000	save the day with Valium.
980000	983000	In a 1995 episode of Babylon 5,
983000	985000	Jack isn't so much an alien as
985000	987000	was abducted by aliens
987000	989000	and then made their inquisitor.
989000	991000	So basically, the Vorgons unfreeze him
991000	993000	whenever they need someone inquisited.
993000	995000	And he's good at this torture thing, but
995000	997000	ultimately he just kind of really wants to teach a lesson.
1001000	1004000	Aww, did we just get the seal of approval
1004000	1005000	from Jack the Ripper?
1005000	1007000	Anyway, this is the only one where
1007000	1009000	Jack apparently learned his lesson.
1020000	1022000	Not sure how I feel about that.
1022000	1024000	Well, piggybacking off of that,
1024000	1026000	we have Jack the Time Traveler.
1026000	1028000	In Time After Time, a less schlocky
1028000	1030000	addition to the 70s canon,
1030000	1032000	Jack is played by, well hello again, David Warner,
1032000	1034000	who escapes to the modern, well
1034000	1036000	1979 modern, day in a time machine.
1036000	1038000	And he is pursued by H.G. Wells,
1038000	1039000	played by Malcolm McDowell.
1039000	1041000	And see, Jack likes it here in the 70s
1041000	1043000	because it's so much more violent
1043000	1045000	than 1888.
1047000	1049000	Look at these looney tunes beating each other.
1049000	1051000	Look at how violent.
1053000	1055000	Ah, the time travel variation
1055000	1057000	on Modern Man is the real monster.
1059000	1062000	Wow.
1062000	1064000	That's deep, man.
1072000	1074000	Fantasy Island is like this magical
1074000	1076000	realism show where people come to
1076000	1078000	Mr. Rourke's Island to live out their fantasies.
1078000	1080000	And Mr. Rourke is kind of like a
1080000	1082000	philanthropic, less creepy Hugh Hefner
1082000	1084000	with magic powers and also wants to teach you a lesson.
1084000	1086000	And usually the fantasies are kind of goofy.
1086000	1088000	Like, the other one in this episode is just
1088000	1090000	a guy who wants to be sexy and learns a lesson
1090000	1092000	about respecting women or something.
1092000	1094000	But this lady's fantasy is solving the Whitechapel murders.
1094000	1096000	And Rourke's like, I don't know,
1096000	1098000	seems kind of dangerous.
1098000	1100000	You sure you don't want, like, a makeover or something?
1100000	1102000	For your own sake, I must
1102000	1104000	urge you to reconsider.
1104000	1106000	No, at great personal risk, she figures out who Jack the Ripper is.
1106000	1108000	And yeah, he's a doctor.
1108000	1110000	But oh no, he's found her time portal.
1110000	1112000	It shows that Albert Fell
1112000	1114000	was abandoned by his mother.
1114000	1116000	She became a prostitute.
1116000	1118000	There it is. Oh, but don't worry,
1118000	1120000	Ricardo Montalban to the rescue.
1122000	1124000	I guess Montalban's steely gaze
1124000	1126000	was just too much for him.
1126000	1128000	You just killed Jack the Ripper.
1128000	1130000	No, Catherine.
1130000	1132000	I just became him.
1132000	1134000	A slight inversion of the regular time traveler,
1134000	1136000	this time the time cop goes back in time
1136000	1138000	to catch, well, not Jack the Ripper,
1138000	1140000	but a guy who killed and replaced
1140000	1142000	Jack the Ripper.
1142000	1144000	He also killed people. So you have to go back in time
1144000	1146000	and make sure the replacement Jack doesn't screw up history
1146000	1148000	too much without altering history.
1148000	1150000	And save Mary Kelly.
1150000	1152000	Hey, you could always pull a From Hell and have a Mary Kelly
1152000	1154000	body double. Nope.
1154000	1156000	Sorry, Mary Kelly. Then we have the
1156000	1158000	oddly specific yet strangely
1158000	1160000	common trope of Jack being
1160000	1162000	transported through time through some magical
1162000	1164000	artifact. A 1985
1164000	1166000	made-for-TV movie starring David
1166000	1168000	Hasselhoff has him originally dying on
1168000	1170000	London Bridge, only to be transported to
1170000	1172000	modern day, well,
1172000	1174000	1985 modern day Arizona.
1174000	1176000	Anyway, London Bridge was apparently
1176000	1178000	in real life relocated to Arizona.
1178000	1180000	I assumed this was like a weird
1180000	1182000	plot contrivance made because Arizona is
1182000	1184000	cheaper to shoot your TV movie in than LA,
1184000	1186000	but nope. This is a thing that really
1186000	1188000	happened. An oil baron bought the
1188000	1190000	bridge, they deconstructed it brick by brick,
1190000	1192000	and reconstructed it in Lake Havasu
1192000	1194000	City, Arizona.
1194000	1196000	Anyway, they missed the final stone until 1985
1196000	1198000	and it just happened to contain
1198000	1200000	the spirit of Jack the Ripper, wouldn't
1200000	1202000	you know. In 1985's The
1202000	1204000	Ripper, Jack's spirit resides in an old
1204000	1206000	antique ring, and his spirit possesses
1206000	1208000	whomsoever is wearing it. In this case,
1208000	1210000	a college professor who happens to be teaching a
1210000	1212000	film studies course on famous crimes as
1212000	1214000	depicted on film. And finally, during
1214000	1216000	season 3 of Sleepy Hollow, the Ripper's spirit
1216000	1218000	is carried through...
1218000	1220000	We're not searching for a monster.
1220000	1222000	We're searching for a weapon.
1222000	1224000	So there was a guy called
1224000	1226000	simply The Ripper running around in Ichabod's
1226000	1228000	time, which was about 100 years
1228000	1230000	before the historical Jack the Ripper.
1230000	1232000	He has gone by many names over the centuries.
1234000	1236000	You might know him
1236000	1238000	as Jack the Ripper.
1238000	1240000	Well, turns out The Ripper is like
1240000	1242000	an evil knife, and whoever
1242000	1244000	wields the knife, the knife builds on their
1244000	1246000	worst attributes. And the knife is also like
1246000	1248000	a vampire knife, absorbing the blood of
1248000	1250000	its victims. The method of defeat here
1250000	1252000	is that it stabs Ichabod, who
1252000	1254000	infects himself with malaria.
1254000	1256000	Which is a weird resolution, because we know
1256000	1258000	OG Ripper stabbed some late-stage syphilitics,
1258000	1260000	so this is an interesting, uh,
1260000	1262000	way to go about it, all things considered.
1262000	1264000	Eh, maybe that's what brought the original knife down too.
1264000	1266000	So, there we have it.
1266000	1268000	A lot of piggybacking off of common conspiracy
1268000	1270000	theories, but mostly
1270000	1272000	just weird shit.
1272000	1274000	I'll kill
1274000	1276000	all of you. And it
1276000	1278000	is kind of human nature to want to
1278000	1280000	ascribe some meaning to something so
1280000	1282000	horrible, but really,
1282000	1284000	it's just grasping at straws
1284000	1286000	for something that is ultimately meaningless.
1286000	1288000	You know, there is no
1288000	1290000	grand conspiracy, the Freemasons
1290000	1292000	are just, you know, some dude's
1292000	1294000	social club, and the Illuminati
1294000	1296000	isn't real.
1300000	1302000	Thank you for watching, and
1302000	1304000	please remember to like and subscribe,
1304000	1306000	because as you know, all YouTubers are contractually

1310000	1312000	Thank you very much to my patrons
1312000	1314000	who helped make this entire series and
1314000	1316000	video making thing possible.
1316000	1318000	I've been getting a lot of requests
1318000	1320000	to do more video essay type things,
1320000	1322000	so I'll work on that, but remember, those
1322000	1324000	take a lot longer than
1324000	1326000	your straight up loose cannon.
1326000	1328000	And as for the people who keep asking me about the rent video,
1328000	1330000	I'm working on it.
1330000	1332000	Patience.
