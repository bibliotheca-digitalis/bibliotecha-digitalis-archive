0	2000	Okay, happy spring!
2000	4000	Hi!
4000	6000	Let's review, like, a very Halloween-y thing.
6000	8000	Because that makes sense.
8000	10000	Yeah.
10000	12000	A peculiar lemon...
12000	14000	I don't think it's peculiar, that's just sad.
14000	16000	Yeah, I tried.
16000	18000	Need to take a class on, like, the garnishing of drinks.
18000	20000	So yeah, we looked for a peculiar cocktail
20000	22000	to go with
22000	24000	our book that we are discussing
24000	26000	this week, Mrs. Peregrine's Home
26000	28000	for Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs.
28000	30000	And, uh...
30000	32000	Nella went and found one with vinegar.
32000	34000	Yeah. A vinegar gin martini.
34000	36000	Yeah, so it includes
36000	38000	Earl Grey tea, honey,
38000	40000	um...
40000	42000	balsamic vinegar, your really fancy stuff
42000	44000	that's quite expensive.
44000	46000	I got that for Christmas, like, two years ago.
46000	48000	So I think that might, you know, turn the tide towards us.
48000	50000	A little splash of lemon, and...
50000	52000	Yeah, this could be, like, those pickleback things.
52000	54000	Maybe this could work.
54000	56000	I think it could.
58000	60000	Okay, it works.
60000	62000	Hey, it works!
62000	64000	I think this would not work without the ancient balsamic.
64000	66000	Yeah, this is...
66000	68000	A whole new world of possibilities just opened up before my eye.
68000	70000	Yeah, this is like...
70000	72000	Just like in the book!
72000	74000	Yeah, no, this is like the book.
74000	76000	It's peculiar, but it works.
76000	78000	So we're trying to, from here on out,
78000	80000	Siskel and Ebert this thing to, uh...
80000	82000	We don't discuss it before.
82000	84000	Um...
84000	86000	So whatever our guns are,
86000	88000	we're gonna stick to them, and then maybe
88000	90000	hugging and crying will happen, maybe screaming and fighting.
90000	92000	Who knows?
92000	94000	But before we get started on Peregrine,
94000	96000	we're going to announce our next one
96000	98000	based on your suggestions.
98000	100000	We asked for an adult one
100000	102000	with minimal to no romance,
102000	104000	so we went with, uh...
104000	106000	This is not library copy.
106000	108000	Shades of Grey by
108000	110000	Jasper Faford.
110000	112000	I'm pretty sure that's just Ford.
112000	114000	This one seems to be an adult dystopian novel,
114000	116000	so I think that'll be quite interesting
116000	118000	to contrast with the wide, wide world
118000	120000	of YA dystopia, so thanks for that.
120000	122000	Um...
122000	124000	You poor bastard. You published right before
124000	126000	Shades of Grey.
126000	128000	I know, this came out in 2009.
128000	130000	You poor bastard.
130000	132000	Thank you for your suggestions.
132000	134000	Keep on making them.
134000	136000	As for next week, I guess, you know,
136000	138000	whatever. Preferably female protagonist.
138000	140000	Yeah.
140000	142000	Like, let's see if we can do
142000	144000	female protagonist, no love interest,
144000	146000	or minimal if we must.
146000	148000	We shall see.
148000	150000	Can you show me a unicorn?
152000	154000	I'd like a fairy in a jar that can grant wishes.
156000	158000	Peregrine's Home for
158000	160000	Peculiar Children, which came out a couple years ago
160000	162000	by Ransom Riggs.
162000	164000	As far as I can tell, that is
164000	166000	his real name.
166000	168000	He was just meant to be a writer.
168000	170000	And also,
170000	172000	an alma mater of the University of Southern California
172000	174000	School of Film and Television Graduate School.
174000	176000	So, gotta represent.
176000	178000	One of yours. Yeah, he's one of ours.
178000	180000	He's one of ours, only he actually graduated.
180000	182000	Um, I will say this.
182000	184000	This book is a perfect example
184000	186000	of why, if you write a prologue,
186000	188000	you should really get rid of it.
188000	190000	Yeah. Like, write it for your own
190000	192000	pleasure, but when you actually go to publish it,
192000	194000	you can just really get rid of it.
194000	196000	No book really needs a prologue.
196000	198000	I think for both of us, it kind of, like, put up the, uh,
198000	200000	uh-oh.
200000	202000	But luckily,
202000	204000	it improved vastly after the prologue.
204000	206000	Okay.
206000	208000	So, Nella, what did you think of
208000	210000	Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar
210000	212000	Children? Well, on the whole,
212000	214000	I did enjoy it.
214000	216000	I...
216000	218000	I enjoyed the, uh,
218000	220000	the gimmick of the
220000	222000	pictures included.
222000	224000	Sometimes I definitely did feel a little forced.
224000	226000	But, like, someone's like,
226000	228000	we have to go, like,
228000	230000	hold on, I have a picture for that.
230000	232000	And they, like, go get it, like, in the middle of, like,
232000	234000	an action scene. Like, it happened
234000	236000	several times. Yeah.
236000	238000	So, like, in case you haven't read it, and we
238000	240000	won't spoil it too much,
240000	242000	the big gimmick of this book is
242000	244000	that there are pictures in it.
244000	246000	And the pictures are
246000	248000	pictures that he found from actual collections.
248000	250000	Like, he cites them at the end here.
250000	252000	And, uh, so these pictures
252000	254000	are, like, um,
254000	256000	basically what the book is
256000	258000	written around.
258000	260000	Yeah, on the whole, I liked it. Uh, it definitely
260000	262000	Oh, boy, the sequel fodder.
262000	264000	I'm really getting surprised by these books where they have such
264000	266000	obvious, and then the sequel
266000	268000	ending. Um...
268000	270000	And then we went off for more
270000	272000	adventures. Yeah. It took me a little bit to
272000	274000	get really into it and start
274000	276000	liking where it was going, because
276000	278000	the main character, when I was taking notes as I was
278000	280000	going, in the first four percent
280000	282000	of the book, all my notes consisted
282000	284000	of, oh my god, I hate this protagonist.
284000	286000	Eat a dick.
286000	288000	Do you even understand what Realtale is?
288000	290000	Like, he's very
290000	292000	sheltered,
292000	294000	and he's a privileged white boy.
294000	296000	But I think that works, like,
296000	298000	because he's a privileged white boy. It ends up working, yeah.
298000	300000	But in the very beginning, I just really
300000	302000	wanted to put it down, because he was just
302000	304000	so...
304000	306000	so, like... Teenage boy.
306000	308000	Teenage boy.
308000	310000	I thought this was great.
310000	312000	Like, I really... I
312000	314000	thought it was great, except for the gimmick.
314000	316000	I...
316000	318000	I mean, I thought this was, like, a great, like,
318000	320000	you know,
320000	322000	writing prompt.
322000	324000	Like, you could... Like, this was what
324000	326000	inspired me, but, like,
326000	328000	it really kind of got distracting.
328000	330000	But whenever it was just, like, we'd be
330000	332000	having a scene, putting along, and all of a sudden...
332000	334000	Someone has to go get a picture to refer to.
334000	336000	A picture has to be described.
336000	338000	I remembered the picture, or, you know,
338000	340000	and then someone else, like,
340000	342000	hold on! I got a picture for that!
342000	344000	But honestly, like,
344000	346000	I thought this book was
346000	348000	I think way more messed up
348000	350000	than it was intended to be.
350000	352000	But in a good way.
352000	354000	Well, it definitely had that
354000	356000	Neverland is a terrible place.
356000	358000	Yeah, it had unfortunate implications, but it didn't shy away
358000	360000	from them. Like, the fact that
360000	362000	basically, like, whenever he does find
362000	364000	the peculiar children about halfway through the book,
364000	366000	they are existing in this
366000	368000	arrested development type.
368000	370000	Like, they are
370000	372000	in their 90s, but they're still mentally
372000	374000	children.
374000	376000	Very much a fairy
376000	378000	world entrapment going
378000	380000	on, where they can't escape
380000	382000	it at this point.
382000	384000	So that's really
384000	386000	fascinating to me, because
386000	388000	you can never leave. It's paradise,
388000	390000	but you can never leave, sort of thing.
390000	392000	Here's our basic setup. This kid,
392000	394000	our main character, Jacob,
394000	396000	witnesses a terrible thing. He witnesses
396000	398000	the murder slash
398000	400000	accidental death, maybe, of his
400000	402000	grandfather. And this
402000	404000	sends him on a search for truth,
404000	406000	which eventually leads him to this place his grandfather
406000	408000	grew up, the home for peculiar children.
408000	410000	And basically,
410000	412000	the first few chapters are this character
412000	414000	dealing with literal PTSD.
414000	416000	Like, he's
416000	418000	in therapy. He's going through
418000	420000	all these motions of trying to cope with what
420000	422000	he saw, or what he thinks he saw.
422000	424000	And eventually, because
424000	426000	he's super rich, he can whimsically
426000	428000	go on this trip to Wales to find
428000	430000	this place that his grandfather
430000	432000	always talked about.
432000	434000	I think what I really liked about it,
434000	436000	because I basically decided
436000	438000	about halfway through the book, that this was all in his head.
438000	440000	Which is completely
440000	442000	up to, because it kind of had this
442000	444000	Pan's Labyrinth-y feeling of
444000	446000	this is a coping mechanism.
446000	448000	This story he is concocting
448000	450000	is a coping mechanism for this real life
450000	452000	horrible thing, because of
452000	454000	the things that his father
454000	456000	eventually revealed to him about his grandfather.
456000	458000	Maybe his grandfather wasn't such a perfect guy.
458000	460000	Maybe he did things to the family
460000	462000	that weren't so great.
462000	464000	And maybe you put him on a pedestal.
464000	466000	And I really related to that, because I think
466000	468000	that is part of growing up, is realizing
468000	470000	that your parents and grandparents aren't
470000	472000	like these perfect, infallible
472000	474000	beings. They are,
474000	476000	you know...
476000	478000	Personally, my grandfather,
478000	480000	like, getting into
480000	482000	sad, frowny time territory.
482000	484000	When my grandmother died,
484000	486000	there was all this bitterness in the
486000	488000	family, and I basically found out
488000	490000	that my grandfather, you know,
490000	492000	before I was born, was not a stand-up
492000	494000	person. He was actually kind of a bad guy.
494000	496000	And I basically decided to
496000	498000	unperson him. And for the last seven years of his
498000	500000	life, I didn't speak to him. I was
500000	502000	just like, gone.
502000	504000	And I think that's interesting.
504000	506000	Whenever he finds out these things about his
506000	508000	grandfather, and you can
508000	510000	read it either as, his grandfather
510000	512000	was totally innocent, or
512000	514000	he comes up with this really elaborate
514000	516000	story to frame the innocence
516000	518000	of his grandfather. And I feel
518000	520000	like you could read it to where it really goes either way,
520000	522000	because of the way he sort of
522000	524000	demonizes, like, his parents
524000	526000	not believing him, and like,
526000	528000	the mental health system doesn't believe him,
528000	530000	and nobody believes me, and I'm,
530000	532000	you know, I'm special.
532000	534000	Well, to me, it's also... I mean, that theory to me
534000	536000	works just because he's
536000	538000	so
538000	540000	quick to feel
540000	542000	like he has nothing left for him back in
542000	544000	the real world. Yeah.
544000	546000	As teenagers are wont to do.
546000	548000	Like, no, I can't possibly
548000	550000	go back. There's nothing for me.
550000	552000	Yeah! Like, oh,
552000	554000	16!
554000	556000	No, I want to run away and live in Neverland forever.
556000	558000	Mm-hmm.
558000	560000	Maybe.
560000	562000	Maybe that makes it illusional. It's all in his
562000	564000	head. It makes that thing work even better, because he is older,
564000	566000	and it is, like... Yeah.
566000	568000	It's not just, like, kid's imagination, like, no, you are mentally
568000	570000	unbalanced. Yeah, like, you know, he cray.
570000	572000	Or maybe not. Maybe it's all real.
572000	574000	But I feel like it's just based
574000	576000	purely on, like, the way that
576000	578000	the things
578000	580000	that are answered, like these
580000	582000	uncomfortable truths about reality that we
582000	584000	as adults all have to come to terms with sooner
584000	586000	or later. Yeah. This protagonist
586000	588000	kind of looks at them and goes, nope!
588000	590000	Kill your children. I'm
590000	592000	special. I don't know. I read it as that the world
592000	594000	he uncovers is real.
594000	596000	Mm-hmm. I took it for face value,
596000	598000	which still ended up
598000	600000	metaphor for real
600000	602000	life. Like, holo-gast.
602000	604000	God, the holo-gast. The holo-gast.
604000	606000	The holo-gast is terrible.
606000	608000	Not the holo-gast. Why did you use that word?
608000	610000	Don't make puns about the holocaust.
610000	612000	Yeah, it's like, if holocaust is actually in your
612000	614000	book, maybe lay off the holocaust
614000	616000	puns. Just a little bit.
616000	618000	I don't even know if you were realizing you were
618000	620000	making a pun about a holocaust,
620000	622000	but it's really important. I think we probably did.
622000	624000	At least it's a play on words.
624000	626000	Whatever. No.
626000	628000	Someone had to bring it! No, I'm sure it was
628000	630000	intentional.
630000	632000	Okay. The only real, because
632000	634000	I really like the characters. I like the way that the
634000	636000	you know, I like the quirky
636000	638000	children. They were all really interesting. They
638000	640000	weren't like typical boring child characters.
640000	642000	Yeah. They had a purpose.
642000	644000	The only thing that really bugged me was like
644000	646000	the end kind of went way too
646000	648000	fast, and it was kind of
648000	650000	honestly dragged.
650000	652000	And also, the main
652000	654000	the villain
654000	656000	and his, like, it's really hard.
656000	658000	I speak from experience. When you have a point of view
658000	660000	character, and your
660000	662000	audience needs to know the villain's motivation,
662000	664000	it is really hard
664000	666000	to not go into, you got
666000	668000	me monologuing, you sly
668000	670000	dog. But, oh my
670000	672000	god.
672000	674000	Again?
674000	676000	God damn it.
676000	678000	He got him monologuing quick.
678000	680000	Let's pull the caper
680000	682000	while he's monologuing.
682000	684000	I was actually going through it like
684000	686000	there's a very slow
686000	688000	burn to the sudden
688000	690000	ending explosion.
690000	692000	Well, it is very like nothing, nothing, nothing,
692000	694000	nothing, nothing, nothing. Whee!
694000	696000	Yeah. And then everything
696000	698000	falls apart really quick.
698000	700000	But I think that lends a lot
700000	702000	of credence to my theory. Like, when you
702000	704000	find out the bad guy and what his
704000	706000	motivations are, you know,
706000	708000	it's like, yeah, I was totally right.
708000	710000	I was totally right about this all being
710000	712000	in his head. And he's insane.
712000	714000	And then the end is like, he's dead.
714000	716000	Or something.
716000	718000	Or he's like, or it's gonna
718000	720000	like, but anyway, yeah.
720000	722000	I think, you know, this would make a great, like,
722000	724000	this could, if Tim Burton
724000	726000	does end up making this, this could be like a
726000	728000	return to form for him because it's so perfect.
728000	730000	You know, it would make a great
730000	732000	stop motion. Like, I could see something
732000	734000	in the vein of ParaNorman, you know,
734000	736000	or Coraline. Like, that was my
736000	738000	two points. That was my biggest comparison
738000	740000	reading it. It felt very Coraline.
740000	742000	And I know some people had problems
742000	744000	with that, this idea that like, sort of
744000	746000	monsters is a metaphor for Nazis,
746000	748000	but then there are Nazis, and
748000	750000	it takes place basically during World War II, sort of.
750000	752000	Yeah. So, you're
752000	754000	getting it on both ends, pretty much.
754000	756000	Yeah. But I thought
756000	758000	that worked. I really liked that.
758000	760000	Especially when you take into
760000	762000	consideration that this might completely
762000	764000	be all in his head angle.
764000	766000	You know, when the Nazis
766000	768000	come in, or the
768000	770000	monster Nazis. And then Dumbledore fought Grindelwald.
770000	772000	And I like that Dumbledore was like
772000	774000	a chick, too. I thought that was
774000	776000	great. I was like, our awesome
776000	778000	Dumbledore character is a woman. You never
778000	780000	see that. I know. Yeah, like, I
780000	782000	like Miss Peregrine. I thought she was a little
782000	784000	too, like, I'm
784000	786000	keeping secrets for your own good.
786000	788000	I thought Dumbledore was McGonagall.
788000	790000	Yeah, it's like Dumbledore. Which everyone can get behind.
790000	792000	Yeah, yeah. And I thought it worked.
792000	794000	And I actually,
794000	796000	except for the main love interest, which of course
796000	798000	there is one.
798000	800000	Guesses why! But at least it's like
800000	802000	super background noise.
802000	804000	I liked all the girl characters. It's super awkward, though.
804000	806000	Read it. You'll see what I'm talking about. Yeah, like,
806000	808000	their love is awkward love.
808000	810000	I mean, I dug it, because I liked that
810000	812000	at least it brings up the awkward,
812000	814000	and I was like,
814000	816000	you know, like, that's a really
816000	818000	awkward boner you got there.
818000	820000	I don't know how I feel about this.
820000	822000	This is a frown boner.
822000	824000	I liked Bronwyn, too.
824000	826000	She was so great.
826000	828000	Okay, so anyway,
828000	830000	I wholeheartedly recommend this. I thought it was
830000	832000	great. This is one of my favorite YA books I've read.
832000	834000	I mean, I wasn't wild about
834000	836000	the gimmick or the, like, really hurried
836000	838000	ending, but for the most part, I really liked the
838000	840000	characters. I like how unafraid it was
840000	842000	of its own implications, and
842000	844000	how messed up it was if you consider that it's all
844000	846000	in his head. As reading it,
846000	848000	well, I read it without the
848000	850000	um, it's all in his
850000	852000	head theory. I saw
852000	854000	it as this was really happening, this really is a magical
854000	856000	instance that is
856000	858000	occurring. I also liked that it didn't shy
858000	860000	away from the implications of this world.
860000	862000	Um, they are slightly
862000	864000	horrifying, but they're
864000	866000	explained, which is what I
866000	868000	really liked about it. Um,
868000	870000	so, hey, you know. Except for some of the naming
870000	872000	conventions. Well...Hologast.
872000	874000	I don't...you know me, I'm not really
874000	876000	as big on like...well, aside
876000	878000	from the Hologast.
880000	882000	That didn't bother me until you brought it up now
882000	884000	is all I can think about. Right.
884000	886000	I don't know, I saw it right away.
886000	888000	Takes one of my all-caps down for my all-caps
888000	890000	recommended. But anyway,
890000	892000	for all you folks who recommended this, thank you,
892000	894000	and of course, give us something else
894000	896000	We have some ideas
896000	898000	from our previous
898000	900000	week's comments.
900000	902000	Two weeks from now,
902000	904000	Shades of Grey by Jasper
904000	906000	Ford, and
906000	908000	after that, we will
908000	910000	announce our next one. Again, YA
910000	912000	fairy in a
912000	914000	bottle that grants wishes.
914000	916000	No romance. Let's see if
916000	918000	you can do it.
918000	920000	Unicorn.
920000	922000	Unicorn.
