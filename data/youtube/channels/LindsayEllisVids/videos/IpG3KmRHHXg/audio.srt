1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, happy spring!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's review, like, a very Halloween-y thing.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Because that makes sense.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yeah.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
A peculiar lemon...

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I don't think it's peculiar, that's just sad.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yeah, I tried.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Need to take a class on, like, the garnishing of drinks.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So yeah, we looked for a peculiar cocktail

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
to go with

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
our book that we are discussing

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
this week, Mrs. Peregrine's Home

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
for Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And, uh...

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Nella went and found one with vinegar.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yeah. A vinegar gin martini.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yeah, so it includes

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Earl Grey tea, honey,

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
um...

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
balsamic vinegar, your really fancy stuff

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
that's quite expensive.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I got that for Christmas, like, two years ago.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So I think that might, you know, turn the tide towards us.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
A little splash of lemon, and...

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah, this could be, like, those pickleback things.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Maybe this could work.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I think it could.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Okay, it works.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hey, it works!

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I think this would not work without the ancient balsamic.

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah, this is...

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
A whole new world of possibilities just opened up before my eye.

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah, this is like...

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Just like in the book!

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeah, no, this is like the book.

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's peculiar, but it works.

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So we're trying to, from here on out,

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Siskel and Ebert this thing to, uh...

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We don't discuss it before.

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Um...

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So whatever our guns are,

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
we're gonna stick to them, and then maybe

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
hugging and crying will happen, maybe screaming and fighting.

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Who knows?

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But before we get started on Peregrine,

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
we're going to announce our next one

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
based on your suggestions.

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We asked for an adult one

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
with minimal to no romance,

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
so we went with, uh...

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This is not library copy.

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Shades of Grey by

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Jasper Faford.

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm pretty sure that's just Ford.

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This one seems to be an adult dystopian novel,

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
so I think that'll be quite interesting

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
to contrast with the wide, wide world

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
of YA dystopia, so thanks for that.

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Um...

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You poor bastard. You published right before

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Shades of Grey.

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I know, this came out in 2009.

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You poor bastard.

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Thank you for your suggestions.

66
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Keep on making them.

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
As for next week, I guess, you know,

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
whatever. Preferably female protagonist.

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah.

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Like, let's see if we can do

71
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
female protagonist, no love interest,

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
or minimal if we must.

73
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We shall see.

74
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Can you show me a unicorn?

75
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'd like a fairy in a jar that can grant wishes.

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Peregrine's Home for

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Peculiar Children, which came out a couple years ago

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
by Ransom Riggs.

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
As far as I can tell, that is

80
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
his real name.

81
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
He was just meant to be a writer.

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And also,

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
an alma mater of the University of Southern California

84
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
School of Film and Television Graduate School.

85
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So, gotta represent.

86
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
One of yours. Yeah, he's one of ours.

87
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He's one of ours, only he actually graduated.

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Um, I will say this.

89
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This book is a perfect example

90
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
of why, if you write a prologue,

91
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
you should really get rid of it.

92
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yeah. Like, write it for your own

93
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
pleasure, but when you actually go to publish it,

94
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
you can just really get rid of it.

95
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
No book really needs a prologue.

96
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I think for both of us, it kind of, like, put up the, uh,

97
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
uh-oh.

98
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But luckily,

99
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
it improved vastly after the prologue.

100
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay.

101
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So, Nella, what did you think of

102
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar

103
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Children? Well, on the whole,

104
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I did enjoy it.

105
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I...

106
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I enjoyed the, uh,

107
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
the gimmick of the

108
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
pictures included.

109
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Sometimes I definitely did feel a little forced.

110
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But, like, someone's like,

111
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
we have to go, like,

112
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
hold on, I have a picture for that.

113
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And they, like, go get it, like, in the middle of, like,

114
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
an action scene. Like, it happened

115
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
several times. Yeah.

116
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So, like, in case you haven't read it, and we

117
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
won't spoil it too much,

118
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
the big gimmick of this book is

119
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
that there are pictures in it.

120
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And the pictures are

121
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
pictures that he found from actual collections.

122
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Like, he cites them at the end here.

123
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And, uh, so these pictures

124
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
are, like, um,

125
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
basically what the book is

126
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
written around.

127
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah, on the whole, I liked it. Uh, it definitely

128
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Oh, boy, the sequel fodder.

129
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm really getting surprised by these books where they have such

130
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
obvious, and then the sequel

131
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
ending. Um...

132
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And then we went off for more

133
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
adventures. Yeah. It took me a little bit to

134
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
get really into it and start

135
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
liking where it was going, because

136
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
the main character, when I was taking notes as I was

137
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
going, in the first four percent

138
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
of the book, all my notes consisted

139
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
of, oh my god, I hate this protagonist.

140
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Eat a dick.

141
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Do you even understand what Realtale is?

142
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Like, he's very

143
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
sheltered,

144
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and he's a privileged white boy.

145
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But I think that works, like,

146
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
because he's a privileged white boy. It ends up working, yeah.

147
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But in the very beginning, I just really

148
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
wanted to put it down, because he was just

149
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
so...

150
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
so, like... Teenage boy.

151
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Teenage boy.

152
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I thought this was great.

153
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Like, I really... I

154
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
thought it was great, except for the gimmick.

155
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I...

156
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I mean, I thought this was, like, a great, like,

157
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
you know,

158
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
writing prompt.

159
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Like, you could... Like, this was what

160
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
inspired me, but, like,

161
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
it really kind of got distracting.

162
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But whenever it was just, like, we'd be

163
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
having a scene, putting along, and all of a sudden...

164
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Someone has to go get a picture to refer to.

165
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
A picture has to be described.

166
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I remembered the picture, or, you know,

167
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and then someone else, like,

168
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
hold on! I got a picture for that!

169
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But honestly, like,

170
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I thought this book was

171
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I think way more messed up

172
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
than it was intended to be.

173
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But in a good way.

174
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Well, it definitely had that

175
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Neverland is a terrible place.

176
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yeah, it had unfortunate implications, but it didn't shy away

177
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
from them. Like, the fact that

178
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
basically, like, whenever he does find

179
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
the peculiar children about halfway through the book,

180
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
they are existing in this

181
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
arrested development type.

182
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Like, they are

183
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
in their 90s, but they're still mentally

184
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
children.

185
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Very much a fairy

186
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
world entrapment going

187
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
on, where they can't escape

188
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
it at this point.

189
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So that's really

190
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
fascinating to me, because

191
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
you can never leave. It's paradise,

192
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
but you can never leave, sort of thing.

193
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Here's our basic setup. This kid,

194
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
our main character, Jacob,

195
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
witnesses a terrible thing. He witnesses

196
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
the murder slash

197
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
accidental death, maybe, of his

198
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
grandfather. And this

199
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
sends him on a search for truth,

200
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
which eventually leads him to this place his grandfather

201
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
grew up, the home for peculiar children.

202
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And basically,

203
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
the first few chapters are this character

204
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
dealing with literal PTSD.

205
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Like, he's

206
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
in therapy. He's going through

207
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
all these motions of trying to cope with what

208
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
he saw, or what he thinks he saw.

209
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And eventually, because

210
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
he's super rich, he can whimsically

211
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
go on this trip to Wales to find

212
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
this place that his grandfather

213
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
always talked about.

214
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I think what I really liked about it,

215
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
because I basically decided

216
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
about halfway through the book, that this was all in his head.

217
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Which is completely

218
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
up to, because it kind of had this

219
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Pan's Labyrinth-y feeling of

220
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
this is a coping mechanism.

221
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
This story he is concocting

222
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
is a coping mechanism for this real life

223
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
horrible thing, because of

224
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
the things that his father

225
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
eventually revealed to him about his grandfather.

226
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Maybe his grandfather wasn't such a perfect guy.

227
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Maybe he did things to the family

228
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
that weren't so great.

229
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And maybe you put him on a pedestal.

230
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And I really related to that, because I think

231
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
that is part of growing up, is realizing

232
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
that your parents and grandparents aren't

233
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
like these perfect, infallible

234
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
beings. They are,

235
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
you know...

236
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Personally, my grandfather,

237
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
like, getting into

238
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
sad, frowny time territory.

239
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
When my grandmother died,

240
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
there was all this bitterness in the

241
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
family, and I basically found out

242
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
that my grandfather, you know,

243
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
before I was born, was not a stand-up

244
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
person. He was actually kind of a bad guy.

245
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And I basically decided to

246
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
unperson him. And for the last seven years of his

247
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
life, I didn't speak to him. I was

248
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
just like, gone.

249
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And I think that's interesting.

250
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Whenever he finds out these things about his

251
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
grandfather, and you can

252
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
read it either as, his grandfather

253
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
was totally innocent, or

254
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
he comes up with this really elaborate

255
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
story to frame the innocence

256
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
of his grandfather. And I feel

257
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
like you could read it to where it really goes either way,

258
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
because of the way he sort of

259
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
demonizes, like, his parents

260
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
not believing him, and like,

261
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
the mental health system doesn't believe him,

262
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and nobody believes me, and I'm,

263
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
you know, I'm special.

264
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Well, to me, it's also... I mean, that theory to me

265
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
works just because he's

266
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
so

267
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
quick to feel

268
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
like he has nothing left for him back in

269
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
the real world. Yeah.

270
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
As teenagers are wont to do.

271
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Like, no, I can't possibly

272
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
go back. There's nothing for me.

273
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Yeah! Like, oh,

274
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
16!

275
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
No, I want to run away and live in Neverland forever.

276
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Mm-hmm.

277
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Maybe.

278
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Maybe that makes it illusional. It's all in his

279
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
head. It makes that thing work even better, because he is older,

280
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
and it is, like... Yeah.

281
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's not just, like, kid's imagination, like, no, you are mentally

282
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
unbalanced. Yeah, like, you know, he cray.

283
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Or maybe not. Maybe it's all real.

284
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But I feel like it's just based

285
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
purely on, like, the way that

286
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
the things

287
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
that are answered, like these

288
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
uncomfortable truths about reality that we

289
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
as adults all have to come to terms with sooner

290
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
or later. Yeah. This protagonist

291
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
kind of looks at them and goes, nope!

292
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Kill your children. I'm

293
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
special. I don't know. I read it as that the world

294
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
he uncovers is real.

295
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Mm-hmm. I took it for face value,

296
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
which still ended up

297
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
metaphor for real

298
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
life. Like, holo-gast.

299
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
God, the holo-gast. The holo-gast.

300
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The holo-gast is terrible.

301
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Not the holo-gast. Why did you use that word?

302
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Don't make puns about the holocaust.

303
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah, it's like, if holocaust is actually in your

304
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
book, maybe lay off the holocaust

305
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
puns. Just a little bit.

306
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't even know if you were realizing you were

307
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
making a pun about a holocaust,

308
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
but it's really important. I think we probably did.

309
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
At least it's a play on words.

310
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Whatever. No.

311
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Someone had to bring it! No, I'm sure it was

312
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
intentional.

313
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Okay. The only real, because

314
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I really like the characters. I like the way that the

315
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
you know, I like the quirky

316
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
children. They were all really interesting. They

317
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
weren't like typical boring child characters.

318
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah. They had a purpose.

319
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The only thing that really bugged me was like

320
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
the end kind of went way too

321
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
fast, and it was kind of

322
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
honestly dragged.

323
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And also, the main

324
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
the villain

325
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and his, like, it's really hard.

326
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I speak from experience. When you have a point of view

327
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
character, and your

328
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
audience needs to know the villain's motivation,

329
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
it is really hard

330
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
to not go into, you got

331
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
me monologuing, you sly

332
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
dog. But, oh my

333
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
god.

334
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Again?

335
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
God damn it.

336
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
He got him monologuing quick.

337
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Let's pull the caper

338
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
while he's monologuing.

339
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I was actually going through it like

340
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
there's a very slow

341
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
burn to the sudden

342
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
ending explosion.

343
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Well, it is very like nothing, nothing, nothing,

344
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
nothing, nothing, nothing. Whee!

345
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yeah. And then everything

346
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
falls apart really quick.

347
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But I think that lends a lot

348
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
of credence to my theory. Like, when you

349
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
find out the bad guy and what his

350
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
motivations are, you know,

351
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
it's like, yeah, I was totally right.

352
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I was totally right about this all being

353
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
in his head. And he's insane.

354
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And then the end is like, he's dead.

355
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Or something.

356
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Or he's like, or it's gonna

357
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
like, but anyway, yeah.

358
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I think, you know, this would make a great, like,

359
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
this could, if Tim Burton

360
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
does end up making this, this could be like a

361
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
return to form for him because it's so perfect.

362
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You know, it would make a great

363
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
stop motion. Like, I could see something

364
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
in the vein of ParaNorman, you know,

365
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
or Coraline. Like, that was my

366
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
two points. That was my biggest comparison

367
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
reading it. It felt very Coraline.

368
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And I know some people had problems

369
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
with that, this idea that like, sort of

370
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
monsters is a metaphor for Nazis,

371
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
but then there are Nazis, and

372
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
it takes place basically during World War II, sort of.

373
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yeah. So, you're

374
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
getting it on both ends, pretty much.

375
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yeah. But I thought

376
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
that worked. I really liked that.

377
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Especially when you take into

378
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
consideration that this might completely

379
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
be all in his head angle.

380
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You know, when the Nazis

381
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
come in, or the

382
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
monster Nazis. And then Dumbledore fought Grindelwald.

383
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And I like that Dumbledore was like

384
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
a chick, too. I thought that was

385
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
great. I was like, our awesome

386
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Dumbledore character is a woman. You never

387
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
see that. I know. Yeah, like, I

388
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
like Miss Peregrine. I thought she was a little

389
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
too, like, I'm

390
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
keeping secrets for your own good.

391
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I thought Dumbledore was McGonagall.

392
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah, it's like Dumbledore. Which everyone can get behind.

393
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yeah, yeah. And I thought it worked.

394
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And I actually,

395
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
except for the main love interest, which of course

396
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
there is one.

397
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Guesses why! But at least it's like

398
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
super background noise.

399
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I liked all the girl characters. It's super awkward, though.

400
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Read it. You'll see what I'm talking about. Yeah, like,

401
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
their love is awkward love.

402
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I mean, I dug it, because I liked that

403
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
at least it brings up the awkward,

404
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
and I was like,

405
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
you know, like, that's a really

406
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
awkward boner you got there.

407
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't know how I feel about this.

408
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
This is a frown boner.

409
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I liked Bronwyn, too.

410
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
She was so great.

411
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Okay, so anyway,

412
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I wholeheartedly recommend this. I thought it was

413
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
great. This is one of my favorite YA books I've read.

414
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I mean, I wasn't wild about

415
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
the gimmick or the, like, really hurried

416
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
ending, but for the most part, I really liked the

417
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
characters. I like how unafraid it was

418
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
of its own implications, and

419
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
how messed up it was if you consider that it's all

420
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
in his head. As reading it,

421
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
well, I read it without the

422
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
um, it's all in his

423
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
head theory. I saw

424
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
it as this was really happening, this really is a magical

425
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
instance that is

426
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
occurring. I also liked that it didn't shy

427
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
away from the implications of this world.

428
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Um, they are slightly

429
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
horrifying, but they're

430
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
explained, which is what I

431
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
really liked about it. Um,

432
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
so, hey, you know. Except for some of the naming

433
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
conventions. Well...Hologast.

434
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I don't...you know me, I'm not really

435
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
as big on like...well, aside

436
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
from the Hologast.

437
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That didn't bother me until you brought it up now

438
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
is all I can think about. Right.

439
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I don't know, I saw it right away.

440
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Takes one of my all-caps down for my all-caps

441
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
recommended. But anyway,

442
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
for all you folks who recommended this, thank you,

443
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
and of course, give us something else

444
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
We have some ideas

445
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
from our previous

446
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
week's comments.

447
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Two weeks from now,

448
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Shades of Grey by Jasper

449
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Ford, and

450
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
after that, we will

451
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
announce our next one. Again, YA

452
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
fairy in a

453
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
bottle that grants wishes.

454
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
No romance. Let's see if

455
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
you can do it.

456
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Unicorn.

457
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Unicorn.
