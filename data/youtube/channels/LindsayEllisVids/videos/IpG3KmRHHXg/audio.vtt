WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Okay, happy spring!

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Hi!

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
Let's review, like, a very Halloween-y thing.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Because that makes sense.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Yeah.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
A peculiar lemon...

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
I don't think it's peculiar, that's just sad.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Yeah, I tried.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Need to take a class on, like, the garnishing of drinks.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
So yeah, we looked for a peculiar cocktail

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
to go with

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
our book that we are discussing

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
this week, Mrs. Peregrine's Home

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
for Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
And, uh...

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Nella went and found one with vinegar.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Yeah. A vinegar gin martini.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Yeah, so it includes

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Earl Grey tea, honey,

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
um...

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
balsamic vinegar, your really fancy stuff

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
that's quite expensive.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
I got that for Christmas, like, two years ago.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
So I think that might, you know, turn the tide towards us.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
A little splash of lemon, and...

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Yeah, this could be, like, those pickleback things.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Maybe this could work.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
I think it could.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Okay, it works.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Hey, it works!

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I think this would not work without the ancient balsamic.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Yeah, this is...

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
A whole new world of possibilities just opened up before my eye.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Yeah, this is like...

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Just like in the book!

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Yeah, no, this is like the book.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
It's peculiar, but it works.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
So we're trying to, from here on out,

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Siskel and Ebert this thing to, uh...

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
We don't discuss it before.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Um...

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
So whatever our guns are,

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
we're gonna stick to them, and then maybe

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
hugging and crying will happen, maybe screaming and fighting.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Who knows?

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
But before we get started on Peregrine,

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
we're going to announce our next one

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
based on your suggestions.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
We asked for an adult one

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
with minimal to no romance,

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
so we went with, uh...

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
This is not library copy.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Shades of Grey by

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Jasper Faford.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
I'm pretty sure that's just Ford.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
This one seems to be an adult dystopian novel,

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
so I think that'll be quite interesting

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
to contrast with the wide, wide world

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
of YA dystopia, so thanks for that.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Um...

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
You poor bastard. You published right before

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Shades of Grey.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
I know, this came out in 2009.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
You poor bastard.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Thank you for your suggestions.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Keep on making them.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
As for next week, I guess, you know,

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
whatever. Preferably female protagonist.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Yeah.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Like, let's see if we can do

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
female protagonist, no love interest,

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
or minimal if we must.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
We shall see.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Can you show me a unicorn?

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
I'd like a fairy in a jar that can grant wishes.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Peregrine's Home for

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Peculiar Children, which came out a couple years ago

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
by Ransom Riggs.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
As far as I can tell, that is

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
his real name.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
He was just meant to be a writer.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
And also,

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
an alma mater of the University of Southern California

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
School of Film and Television Graduate School.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
So, gotta represent.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
One of yours. Yeah, he's one of ours.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
He's one of ours, only he actually graduated.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Um, I will say this.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
This book is a perfect example

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
of why, if you write a prologue,

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
you should really get rid of it.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Yeah. Like, write it for your own

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
pleasure, but when you actually go to publish it,

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
you can just really get rid of it.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
No book really needs a prologue.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
I think for both of us, it kind of, like, put up the, uh,

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
uh-oh.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
But luckily,

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
it improved vastly after the prologue.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Okay.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
So, Nella, what did you think of

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Children? Well, on the whole,

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
I did enjoy it.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
I...

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
I enjoyed the, uh,

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
the gimmick of the

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
pictures included.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Sometimes I definitely did feel a little forced.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
But, like, someone's like,

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
we have to go, like,

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
hold on, I have a picture for that.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
And they, like, go get it, like, in the middle of, like,

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
an action scene. Like, it happened

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
several times. Yeah.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
So, like, in case you haven't read it, and we

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
won't spoil it too much,

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
the big gimmick of this book is

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
that there are pictures in it.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
And the pictures are

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
pictures that he found from actual collections.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Like, he cites them at the end here.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
And, uh, so these pictures

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
are, like, um,

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
basically what the book is

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
written around.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Yeah, on the whole, I liked it. Uh, it definitely

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Oh, boy, the sequel fodder.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
I'm really getting surprised by these books where they have such

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
obvious, and then the sequel

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
ending. Um...

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
And then we went off for more

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
adventures. Yeah. It took me a little bit to

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
get really into it and start

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
liking where it was going, because

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
the main character, when I was taking notes as I was

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
going, in the first four percent

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
of the book, all my notes consisted

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
of, oh my god, I hate this protagonist.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Eat a dick.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Do you even understand what Realtale is?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Like, he's very

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
sheltered,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
and he's a privileged white boy.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
But I think that works, like,

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
because he's a privileged white boy. It ends up working, yeah.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
But in the very beginning, I just really

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
wanted to put it down, because he was just

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
so...

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
so, like... Teenage boy.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Teenage boy.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
I thought this was great.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Like, I really... I

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
thought it was great, except for the gimmick.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
I...

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
I mean, I thought this was, like, a great, like,

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
you know,

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
writing prompt.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Like, you could... Like, this was what

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
inspired me, but, like,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
it really kind of got distracting.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
But whenever it was just, like, we'd be

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
having a scene, putting along, and all of a sudden...

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Someone has to go get a picture to refer to.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
A picture has to be described.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I remembered the picture, or, you know,

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
and then someone else, like,

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
hold on! I got a picture for that!

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
But honestly, like,

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
I thought this book was

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
I think way more messed up

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
than it was intended to be.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
But in a good way.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Well, it definitely had that

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Neverland is a terrible place.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Yeah, it had unfortunate implications, but it didn't shy away

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
from them. Like, the fact that

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
basically, like, whenever he does find

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
the peculiar children about halfway through the book,

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
they are existing in this

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
arrested development type.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Like, they are

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
in their 90s, but they're still mentally

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
children.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Very much a fairy

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
world entrapment going

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
on, where they can't escape

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
it at this point.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
So that's really

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
fascinating to me, because

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
you can never leave. It's paradise,

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
but you can never leave, sort of thing.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Here's our basic setup. This kid,

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
our main character, Jacob,

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
witnesses a terrible thing. He witnesses

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
the murder slash

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
accidental death, maybe, of his

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
grandfather. And this

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
sends him on a search for truth,

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
which eventually leads him to this place his grandfather

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
grew up, the home for peculiar children.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
And basically,

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
the first few chapters are this character

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
dealing with literal PTSD.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Like, he's

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
in therapy. He's going through

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
all these motions of trying to cope with what

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
he saw, or what he thinks he saw.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
And eventually, because

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
he's super rich, he can whimsically

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
go on this trip to Wales to find

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
this place that his grandfather

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
always talked about.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
I think what I really liked about it,

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
because I basically decided

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
about halfway through the book, that this was all in his head.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Which is completely

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
up to, because it kind of had this

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Pan's Labyrinth-y feeling of

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
this is a coping mechanism.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
This story he is concocting

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
is a coping mechanism for this real life

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
horrible thing, because of

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
the things that his father

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
eventually revealed to him about his grandfather.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Maybe his grandfather wasn't such a perfect guy.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Maybe he did things to the family

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
that weren't so great.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
And maybe you put him on a pedestal.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
And I really related to that, because I think

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
that is part of growing up, is realizing

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
that your parents and grandparents aren't

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
like these perfect, infallible

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
beings. They are,

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
you know...

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Personally, my grandfather,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
like, getting into

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
sad, frowny time territory.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
When my grandmother died,

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
there was all this bitterness in the

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
family, and I basically found out

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
that my grandfather, you know,

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
before I was born, was not a stand-up

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
person. He was actually kind of a bad guy.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
And I basically decided to

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
unperson him. And for the last seven years of his

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
life, I didn't speak to him. I was

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
just like, gone.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
And I think that's interesting.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Whenever he finds out these things about his

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
grandfather, and you can

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
read it either as, his grandfather

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
was totally innocent, or

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
he comes up with this really elaborate

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
story to frame the innocence

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
of his grandfather. And I feel

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
like you could read it to where it really goes either way,

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
because of the way he sort of

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
demonizes, like, his parents

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
not believing him, and like,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
the mental health system doesn't believe him,

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
and nobody believes me, and I'm,

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
you know, I'm special.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Well, to me, it's also... I mean, that theory to me

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
works just because he's

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
so

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
quick to feel

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
like he has nothing left for him back in

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
the real world. Yeah.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
As teenagers are wont to do.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Like, no, I can't possibly

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
go back. There's nothing for me.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Yeah! Like, oh,

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
16!

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
No, I want to run away and live in Neverland forever.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Mm-hmm.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Maybe.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Maybe that makes it illusional. It's all in his

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
head. It makes that thing work even better, because he is older,

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
and it is, like... Yeah.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
It's not just, like, kid's imagination, like, no, you are mentally

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
unbalanced. Yeah, like, you know, he cray.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Or maybe not. Maybe it's all real.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
But I feel like it's just based

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
purely on, like, the way that

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
the things

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
that are answered, like these

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
uncomfortable truths about reality that we

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
as adults all have to come to terms with sooner

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
or later. Yeah. This protagonist

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
kind of looks at them and goes, nope!

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Kill your children. I'm

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
special. I don't know. I read it as that the world

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
he uncovers is real.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Mm-hmm. I took it for face value,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
which still ended up

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
metaphor for real

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
life. Like, holo-gast.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
God, the holo-gast. The holo-gast.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
The holo-gast is terrible.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Not the holo-gast. Why did you use that word?

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Don't make puns about the holocaust.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Yeah, it's like, if holocaust is actually in your

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
book, maybe lay off the holocaust

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
puns. Just a little bit.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
I don't even know if you were realizing you were

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
making a pun about a holocaust,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
but it's really important. I think we probably did.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
At least it's a play on words.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Whatever. No.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Someone had to bring it! No, I'm sure it was

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
intentional.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Okay. The only real, because

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I really like the characters. I like the way that the

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
you know, I like the quirky

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
children. They were all really interesting. They

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
weren't like typical boring child characters.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Yeah. They had a purpose.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
The only thing that really bugged me was like

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
the end kind of went way too

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
fast, and it was kind of

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
honestly dragged.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
And also, the main

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
the villain

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
and his, like, it's really hard.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
I speak from experience. When you have a point of view

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
character, and your

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
audience needs to know the villain's motivation,

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
it is really hard

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
to not go into, you got

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
me monologuing, you sly

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
dog. But, oh my

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
god.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Again?

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
God damn it.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
He got him monologuing quick.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Let's pull the caper

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
while he's monologuing.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
I was actually going through it like

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
there's a very slow

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
burn to the sudden

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
ending explosion.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Well, it is very like nothing, nothing, nothing,

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
nothing, nothing, nothing. Whee!

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Yeah. And then everything

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
falls apart really quick.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
But I think that lends a lot

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
of credence to my theory. Like, when you

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
find out the bad guy and what his

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
motivations are, you know,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
it's like, yeah, I was totally right.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
I was totally right about this all being

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
in his head. And he's insane.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
And then the end is like, he's dead.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Or something.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Or he's like, or it's gonna

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
like, but anyway, yeah.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I think, you know, this would make a great, like,

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
this could, if Tim Burton

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
does end up making this, this could be like a

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
return to form for him because it's so perfect.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
You know, it would make a great

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
stop motion. Like, I could see something

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
in the vein of ParaNorman, you know,

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
or Coraline. Like, that was my

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
two points. That was my biggest comparison

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
reading it. It felt very Coraline.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
And I know some people had problems

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
with that, this idea that like, sort of

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
monsters is a metaphor for Nazis,

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
but then there are Nazis, and

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
it takes place basically during World War II, sort of.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Yeah. So, you're

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
getting it on both ends, pretty much.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Yeah. But I thought

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
that worked. I really liked that.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Especially when you take into

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
consideration that this might completely

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
be all in his head angle.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
You know, when the Nazis

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
come in, or the

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
monster Nazis. And then Dumbledore fought Grindelwald.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
And I like that Dumbledore was like

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
a chick, too. I thought that was

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
great. I was like, our awesome

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Dumbledore character is a woman. You never

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
see that. I know. Yeah, like, I

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
like Miss Peregrine. I thought she was a little

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
too, like, I'm

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
keeping secrets for your own good.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
I thought Dumbledore was McGonagall.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Yeah, it's like Dumbledore. Which everyone can get behind.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Yeah, yeah. And I thought it worked.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
And I actually,

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
except for the main love interest, which of course

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
there is one.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Guesses why! But at least it's like

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
super background noise.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
I liked all the girl characters. It's super awkward, though.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Read it. You'll see what I'm talking about. Yeah, like,

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
their love is awkward love.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
I mean, I dug it, because I liked that

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
at least it brings up the awkward,

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
and I was like,

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
you know, like, that's a really

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
awkward boner you got there.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
I don't know how I feel about this.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
This is a frown boner.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
I liked Bronwyn, too.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
She was so great.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Okay, so anyway,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
I wholeheartedly recommend this. I thought it was

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
great. This is one of my favorite YA books I've read.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
I mean, I wasn't wild about

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
the gimmick or the, like, really hurried

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
ending, but for the most part, I really liked the

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
characters. I like how unafraid it was

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
of its own implications, and

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
how messed up it was if you consider that it's all

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
in his head. As reading it,

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
well, I read it without the

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
um, it's all in his

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
head theory. I saw

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
it as this was really happening, this really is a magical

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
instance that is

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
occurring. I also liked that it didn't shy

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
away from the implications of this world.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Um, they are slightly

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
horrifying, but they're

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
explained, which is what I

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
really liked about it. Um,

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
so, hey, you know. Except for some of the naming

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
conventions. Well...Hologast.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
I don't...you know me, I'm not really

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
as big on like...well, aside

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
from the Hologast.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
That didn't bother me until you brought it up now

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
is all I can think about. Right.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
I don't know, I saw it right away.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Takes one of my all-caps down for my all-caps

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
recommended. But anyway,

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
for all you folks who recommended this, thank you,

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
and of course, give us something else

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
We have some ideas

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
from our previous

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
week's comments.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Two weeks from now,

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Shades of Grey by Jasper

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Ford, and

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
after that, we will

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
announce our next one. Again, YA

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
fairy in a

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
bottle that grants wishes.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
No romance. Let's see if

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
you can do it.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Unicorn.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Unicorn.
