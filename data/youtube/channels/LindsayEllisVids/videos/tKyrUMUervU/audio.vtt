WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.760
And now, at long last, in our not-very-deep trek into feminist film theory,

00:04.760 --> 00:10.580
it is time to talk about Michaela Banes, the most well-rounded and worthwhile character in the Transformers movies.

00:12.500 --> 00:14.500
What?

00:20.340 --> 00:25.400
When people think about women in the Transformers movies, the first thing that comes to mind after that

00:25.620 --> 00:32.440
Romeo and Juliet lost scene from the Age of Extinction is Megan Fox, but Megan Fox's character, Michaela Banes

00:32.720 --> 00:34.720
Get it? Michaela

00:35.360 --> 00:36.760
Banes

00:36.760 --> 00:40.360
is just the beginning of discussion where women in these movies are concerned.

00:40.620 --> 00:44.980
Because the first movie, easily the most cohesive of any of them from a screenplay perspective,

00:45.220 --> 00:51.620
actually has some comment on the way women are treated by men who underestimate them by being overqualified for a thankless job,

00:52.020 --> 00:56.940
by being dismissed by one's superiors in the workplace because they don't take you seriously because you're a girl.

00:57.340 --> 01:03.440
Given that over the last decade these movies have become an emblem of all that is backward and misogynist in the world,

01:03.620 --> 01:08.340
people have forgotten that the first movie is weirdly sympathetic to its female characters.

01:09.580 --> 01:10.340
On paper.

01:10.340 --> 01:16.380
But this sympathy to the female characters in the screenplay is undermined by the way the women are framed by the camera,

01:16.380 --> 01:20.380
and the framing gives the audience a different takeaway than what we see on the page.

01:20.580 --> 01:23.380
It squirts the fuel in so you can go faster.

01:25.540 --> 01:26.860
I like to go faster.

01:26.860 --> 01:29.660
Let's recap the plot of Transformers 1.

01:29.700 --> 01:38.380
A down-on-her-luck working-class girl with a gift at hot-wiring and fixing cars gets swept up into a godlike clash of space car robots by a hapless idiot.

01:38.380 --> 01:40.380
I just put in that light there.

01:40.620 --> 01:42.540
And that disco ball.

01:42.540 --> 01:44.540
So the light reflects off the disco ball.

01:45.540 --> 01:46.540
Aw.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.540
She is obviously skeptical at first.

01:48.540 --> 01:51.540
Why would the alien space robots have any use for such a worthless dummy?

01:51.540 --> 01:55.540
He seems incapable of even looking after himself, and she even has to save him a couple times.

01:56.540 --> 01:57.540
He's gonna kill me!

02:02.540 --> 02:04.540
But this girl has problems of her own.

02:04.540 --> 02:06.540
Not only do the men in her life not respect her.

02:06.540 --> 02:07.540
Hey, how about you let me drive?

02:07.540 --> 02:08.540
Oh, no. No, no, no.

02:08.540 --> 02:09.540
This is not a toy.

02:09.540 --> 02:10.540
These 22s?

02:10.540 --> 02:11.540
Romantic friends do this.

02:11.540 --> 02:13.540
I mean, I'm not that friend.

02:13.540 --> 02:14.540
I mean, I could be.

02:14.540 --> 02:15.540
You in the training bra.

02:15.540 --> 02:16.540
Do not test me.

02:16.540 --> 02:20.540
Her dad is in jail and she herself has a juvie record for aiding and abetting.

02:20.540 --> 02:22.540
You know those cars my dad used to teach me to fix?

02:22.540 --> 02:24.540
Well, they weren't always his.

02:24.540 --> 02:25.540
They're still cars.

02:25.540 --> 02:31.540
But eventually she learns to see her involvement with the alien robots as a chance to use her bravery and her automotive skill set,

02:31.540 --> 02:35.540
which everyone has always underestimated and not appreciated because she is a girl.

02:35.540 --> 02:39.540
To not only get her juvenile record expunged, and to redeem her car thief dad,

02:40.540 --> 02:45.540
but to help the alien space robots save the world from the other alien space robots.

02:45.540 --> 02:48.540
You think I'm shallow, huh?

02:48.540 --> 02:54.540
I think there's a lot more than meets the eye with you.

02:54.540 --> 02:58.540
Michaela, the only human character with an interest in cars.

02:58.540 --> 03:02.540
You've got a high-rise double pump carburetor. That's pretty impressive, Sam.

03:02.540 --> 03:05.540
The only character with even some approximation of a backstory.

03:05.540 --> 03:08.540
I have a record because I wouldn't turn my dad in.

03:08.540 --> 03:14.540
The only character who self-actualizes, not because others tell her to, not because she is given instruction,

03:14.540 --> 03:18.540
but because she realizes her self-worth on her own.

03:18.540 --> 03:23.540
Oh, God, I can't even tell you how much I'm not your little bunny.

03:23.540 --> 03:26.540
A few years ago, back when we were first kicking around the idea of this project,

03:26.540 --> 03:33.540
I asked Twitter to describe Michaela's character and the results were telling.

03:34.540 --> 03:41.540
Audiences thought it was a given that Michaela was worse written or acted than any of the other characters in the movie

03:41.540 --> 03:46.540
when she very clearly wasn't, but people didn't notice that there was indeed more than meets the eye

03:46.540 --> 03:50.540
because the camera was sending a different message than the script was,

03:50.540 --> 03:54.540
namely that Michaela is not here as a character who grows and changes over the course of a narrative,

03:54.540 --> 03:57.540
but as gratuitous eye candy.

03:57.540 --> 04:00.540
If the theme of the movie is no sacrifice, no victory...

04:00.540 --> 04:04.540
No sacrifice, no victory!

04:04.540 --> 04:08.540
Sam has never sacrificed anything, which Michaela actually points out.

04:08.540 --> 04:11.540
I have a record because I wouldn't turn my dad in.

04:11.540 --> 04:15.540
One of you had to sacrifice anything in your perfect little life.

04:15.540 --> 04:20.540
But Michaela has. Michaela's skill set, backstory, and character arc fit much more neatly with the theme

04:20.540 --> 04:24.540
that the movie is at least going for than the main character himself.

04:24.540 --> 04:29.540
So Transformers 1 isn't so much Sam's coming-of-age story as it is Michaela's.

04:29.540 --> 04:34.540
So given this character, whom everyone underestimates, but is also the only character with any interest or history with cars,

04:34.540 --> 04:39.540
something that might have even led her to, I don't know, discover something about Bumblebee,

04:39.540 --> 04:44.540
like look under his hood and go, hmm, there's something different about this engine.

04:44.540 --> 04:47.540
I think your car might be an alien robot.

04:47.540 --> 04:51.540
Maybe have her established skill set pay off in some narrative way, but it doesn't.

04:51.540 --> 04:53.540
Just pop the hood.

04:53.540 --> 04:58.540
And that image of Michaela leaning over the car, talking about how men don't like that she has skills as a mechanic

04:58.540 --> 05:00.540
because of her gender and the way she looks.

05:00.540 --> 05:03.540
That's weird. I just wouldn't peg you for mechanical.

05:03.540 --> 05:05.540
Well, you know, I don't really broadcast it.

05:05.540 --> 05:08.540
Guys don't like it when you know more about cars than they do.

05:08.540 --> 05:12.540
All while Sam leers at her and listens to not one word she is saying.

05:12.540 --> 05:15.540
This is what we might call dissonance of framing.

05:15.540 --> 05:19.540
The text is saying one thing, the framing is saying something else.

05:19.540 --> 05:21.540
What do people remember from this scene?

05:21.540 --> 05:23.540
Do they remember what Michaela says?

05:23.540 --> 05:26.540
Guys don't like it when you know more about cars than they do.

05:27.540 --> 05:28.540
He hates it.

05:28.540 --> 05:31.540
Or do they remember the way Megan Fox's body was shot?

05:31.540 --> 05:34.540
Michaela is emblematic of the problem with these movies.

05:34.540 --> 05:38.540
Long movies that move so fast that the story is almost impossible to follow,

05:38.540 --> 05:43.540
so aesthetic impressions get weighted much more heavily than thematic or narrative ones.

05:43.540 --> 05:47.540
And when you have a director who is much more interested in frame-for-frame sake

05:47.540 --> 05:50.540
rather than using the camera to emphasize the storytelling,

05:50.540 --> 05:53.540
the narrative, the character, and theme are at war with the aesthetics.

05:53.540 --> 05:56.540
The text says one thing, the camera says another,

05:56.540 --> 05:58.540
and because this is a visual medium,

05:58.540 --> 06:01.540
what the audience remembers is what the camera tells them.

06:01.540 --> 06:05.540
Michaela is talking about how people don't see her as anything but a pair of T&A,

06:05.540 --> 06:09.540
but all the while the camera is conveying to the audience that this is her value.

06:09.540 --> 06:13.540
And unless you're a pedant like me who's obsessed with fixing the flaws of the screenplay

06:13.540 --> 06:15.540
because it had potential, dammit!

06:15.540 --> 06:17.540
That's all the audience takes from it.

06:17.540 --> 06:21.540
On the other end of the spectrum are the women that are not frames of objective desire,

06:21.540 --> 06:23.540
namely Sam's mother, played by Julie White.

06:23.540 --> 06:26.540
Were you... masturbating?

06:28.540 --> 06:29.540
Judy.

06:29.540 --> 06:33.540
And director of national intelligence, Charlotte Meaning, played by Frances McDormand.

06:33.540 --> 06:36.540
I don't care who you are if you breathe a word of what you've seen here.

06:36.540 --> 06:39.540
You will do time for treason. Do you understand me?

06:39.540 --> 06:42.540
White's character is almost entirely played for comedy.

06:42.540 --> 06:44.540
Hey, professor, I'd do anything for an A.

06:44.540 --> 06:46.540
All right, Grace Slick, we got some Slick.

06:46.540 --> 06:49.540
You don't have to call it that word. If that makes you uncomfortable,

06:49.540 --> 06:52.540
you can call it Sam's Happy Time.

06:52.540 --> 06:54.540
March, young lady.

06:54.540 --> 06:57.540
I love it when you call me young lady, you dirty old man.

06:57.540 --> 07:00.540
It's just been a weird night. I've had a little bit to drink.

07:00.540 --> 07:03.540
But McDormand's character seems to resent the fact that she is a woman at all.

07:03.540 --> 07:06.540
See her reaction when she is called ma'am or madam.

07:06.540 --> 07:07.540
Are you not?

07:07.540 --> 07:08.540
Yes, ma'am, I am.

07:08.540 --> 07:11.540
Stop with the ma'am. Enough with the ma'am. Do I look like a ma'am?

07:11.540 --> 07:13.540
No, ma'am. Yes, ma'am, yes.

07:13.540 --> 07:15.540
Feminism.jpg, am I right?

07:15.540 --> 07:20.540
But don't worry, here comes John Turturro to put her, and all women, in their place.

07:20.540 --> 07:22.540
Moving up in the world, huh?

07:22.540 --> 07:25.540
Your booty looks excellent.

07:25.540 --> 07:27.540
Women in these films are on two extremes.

07:27.540 --> 07:30.540
Props of beauty shot in the same manner as Victoria's Secret models,

07:30.540 --> 07:33.540
and one actual Victoria's Secret model.

07:33.540 --> 07:35.540
This is your new lucky bunny.

07:35.540 --> 07:38.540
Hey, it's almost like our director had directed Victoria's Secret commercials before.

07:38.540 --> 07:41.540
And sexless butts of jokes.

07:41.540 --> 07:44.540
The only noteworthy exception to this is NSA contractor Maggie Madsen

07:44.540 --> 07:46.540
played by Rachel Taylor in the first movie,

07:46.540 --> 07:51.540
who is the person who discovers that the Decepticons are trying to hack into national security networks.

07:51.540 --> 07:53.540
There is nothing on Earth that complex.

07:53.540 --> 07:58.540
What about an organism? A living organism. Maybe some kind of DNA-based computer.

07:58.540 --> 08:02.540
No one believes her, so she breaks all of the laws and seeks out her friend Glenn,

08:02.540 --> 08:04.540
played by Anthony Anderson,

08:04.540 --> 08:06.540
Grandmama, drink your prune juice!

08:06.540 --> 08:08.540
to help her figure out what is going on.

08:08.540 --> 08:11.540
This doesn't really go anywhere and ultimately leads the two to discover nothing of consequence

08:11.540 --> 08:16.540
and lands them in jail, where there is this nothing scene in which Anthony Anderson eats...

08:16.540 --> 08:18.540
the whole plate.

08:18.540 --> 08:20.540
I ate the whole plate.

08:22.540 --> 08:25.540
Now for the sake of argument, we're going to ignore the fact that on the surface,

08:25.540 --> 08:28.540
given that this is the first movie and no one knows about the robot aliens yet,

08:28.540 --> 08:30.540
her proposal is absurd.

08:30.540 --> 08:32.540
What about an organism?

08:32.540 --> 08:34.540
What if it was a witch?

08:34.540 --> 08:36.540
What if this is all a projection?

08:36.540 --> 08:38.540
What if we're in the Matrix?

08:38.540 --> 08:40.540
If the moon was made of ribs, would you eat it?

08:40.540 --> 08:42.540
I know that that sounds crazy.

08:42.540 --> 08:43.540
That's enough.

08:43.540 --> 08:44.540
Ignoring that!

08:44.540 --> 08:49.540
It is pretty clear that there is some gender-motivated bias in the way Voight's character talks to her.

08:49.540 --> 08:52.540
If you don't get a filter on that brain-mouth thing, you're going to be off the team.

08:52.540 --> 08:53.540
You understand?

08:53.540 --> 08:57.540
But the dismissive way that her superiors treat Maggie isn't the only comment on women in the workplace

08:57.540 --> 08:58.540
buried in this movie.

08:58.540 --> 08:59.540
Yes, Mr. President.

08:59.540 --> 09:02.540
Yeah, can you wrangle me up some ding-dongs, darling?

09:02.540 --> 09:05.540
During the scene while the Decepticons are trying to break into Air Force One,

09:05.540 --> 09:09.540
an Air Force One Secret Service woman complains about having to be overqualified

09:09.540 --> 09:11.540
to effectively be a glorified stewardess.

09:11.540 --> 09:13.540
Trying the Air Force to reinvent ding-dongs.

09:14.540 --> 09:15.540
I'll be in storage.

09:15.540 --> 09:17.540
Maggie is exceptionally beautiful, sure,

09:17.540 --> 09:20.540
but she's not framed as a commodity like Michaela is,

09:20.540 --> 09:22.540
nor do her male colleagues treat her as anything but an equal.

09:22.540 --> 09:25.540
Only her superior, the Secretary of Defense played by John Voight,

09:25.540 --> 09:28.540
does the go-away little girl-the-big-men-are-talking thing.

09:28.540 --> 09:32.540
This mirrors Michaela being dismissed for her skill set in a male-dominated field,

09:32.540 --> 09:35.540
cars, yet framing her like she is in a car commercial.

09:35.540 --> 09:37.540
This is even more overt in the third movie,

09:37.540 --> 09:41.540
when Bay combines the camera work with some dialogue to compare Carly to a literal car.

09:41.540 --> 09:45.540
Look at the curves. Elegant, isn't it? Beautiful.

09:45.540 --> 09:47.540
Built to evoke the body of the ideal woman.

09:47.540 --> 09:50.540
The first movie constantly subverts the gender status quo

09:50.540 --> 09:52.540
but then reinforces it by way of framing,

09:52.540 --> 09:55.540
which objectifies or undermines the female characters.

09:55.540 --> 09:57.540
That's what I find interesting about the first movie.

09:57.540 --> 09:59.540
It acknowledges that in a sphere like this,

09:59.540 --> 10:03.540
the sphere of technology, the military, and automotive mechanics,

10:03.540 --> 10:07.540
a woman is presumed to be lesser, a secretary, or likely way out of her league.

10:07.540 --> 10:12.540
This is, in part, due to the tendency for people to see young, beautiful, or feminine women as empty shells.

10:12.540 --> 10:14.540
Props, you might say.

10:14.540 --> 10:17.540
And nowhere is this more clear than in the chimera that is Carly.

10:17.540 --> 10:19.540
What is that?

10:19.540 --> 10:21.540
This is your new lucky bunny.

10:21.540 --> 10:24.540
The screenplay for Dark of the Moon was mostly complete before Megan Fox was fired,

10:24.540 --> 10:28.540
so Carly hits all of the beats that Michaela's character had built up to,

10:28.540 --> 10:32.540
ignoring the weird, was a White House intern introduction that is just kind of slapped on,

10:32.540 --> 10:36.540
the fact that Carly is a curator of automobiles for a rich guy makes sense for Michaela.

10:36.540 --> 10:39.540
Michaela's skill set is paying off in the new economy,

10:39.540 --> 10:41.540
and Sam's is not, because it's mostly non-existent.

10:41.540 --> 10:43.540
He has built up no professional contacts,

10:43.540 --> 10:46.540
he is a nervous wreck, and also a total douche.

10:47.540 --> 10:49.540
And then the film ends with this,

10:57.540 --> 11:01.540
which does not make sense for these two characters after only one movie of buildup.

11:01.540 --> 11:04.540
This was supposed to be the same character from movies one and two.

11:04.540 --> 11:08.540
If you look at it in the sense that it was a deliberate story choice to replace Michaela with Carly,

11:08.540 --> 11:10.540
which, you know, it wasn't, but let's pretend that it was,

11:10.540 --> 11:13.540
in a narrative sense, it's even more depressing.

11:13.540 --> 11:16.540
Because the main arc between Sam and Michaela in Transformers 2,

11:16.540 --> 11:19.540
really Michaela's only arc in 2 because this one was mostly written by Bay himself

11:19.540 --> 11:22.540
because it was in pre-production during the writer's strike of 2008,

11:22.540 --> 11:24.540
Tangent!

11:24.540 --> 11:27.540
is that Michaela wants Sam to tell her that he loves her.

11:27.540 --> 11:29.540
I adore you.

11:30.540 --> 11:32.540
That's not the word that I want to hear right now.

11:32.540 --> 11:34.540
What are you talking about? It's the same word as the other word.

11:34.540 --> 11:35.540
It's not the same word.

11:35.540 --> 11:37.540
And neither is willing to say it first.

11:37.540 --> 11:39.540
And eventually, Sam wins.

11:40.540 --> 11:42.540
With my voice, I love you.

11:42.540 --> 11:44.540
You know, maybe by dying.

11:44.540 --> 11:46.540
There are some begrudging proclamations of love.

11:46.540 --> 11:49.540
Look what it is for you to tell me that you love me.

11:51.540 --> 11:52.540
You said it first.

11:52.540 --> 11:53.540
But the real kicker?

11:53.540 --> 11:56.540
It's not that he can't admit it because men and commitment.

11:56.540 --> 11:58.540
It's because he doesn't love her.

11:58.540 --> 12:01.540
But she is the trophy, she is the ward, and therefore disposable.

12:01.540 --> 12:05.540
And therefore in movie 3, he has another disposable beautiful girlfriend.

12:05.540 --> 12:07.540
Get in the car, please.

12:07.540 --> 12:09.540
Another hood ornament, another decoration.

12:09.540 --> 12:13.540
Who she is does not matter because she is not a person to Sam.

12:13.540 --> 12:14.540
Nothing is real to Sam.

12:14.540 --> 12:17.540
Everything is an object because he is so navel-gazing, self-obsessed,

12:17.540 --> 12:20.540
lacking in empathy, and detached from reality.

12:22.540 --> 12:25.540
Everything and everyone, the Autobots, his girlfriend,

12:25.540 --> 12:27.540
is an object to be used and disposed.

12:27.540 --> 12:29.540
She'll always be my first car.

12:29.540 --> 12:32.540
And if we take Michaela and Carly as two separate characters,

12:32.540 --> 12:35.540
which, for the sake of narrative argument, let's...

12:35.540 --> 12:37.540
What if she dumps us like the last girl?

12:37.540 --> 12:39.540
Excuse me. I like her.

12:39.540 --> 12:42.540
Michaela is a far more rounded and realized character than Carly,

12:42.540 --> 12:45.540
even up to the fact that she dumps her boyfriend because,

12:45.540 --> 12:47.540
after putting up with him for so long,

12:47.540 --> 12:51.540
she realizes that he, like everyone else in her life, does not love her.

12:51.540 --> 12:52.540
You said it first.

12:53.540 --> 12:56.540
To him, as to everyone, she is not a person, but an object,

12:56.540 --> 12:58.540
a trophy, a hood ornament, a reward.

12:58.540 --> 13:01.540
So she leaves him off-screen.

13:01.540 --> 13:04.540
We see this mirrored in the real-life adventures of Megan Fox as well.

13:04.540 --> 13:08.540
In a meta-textual sense, by booting Michaela and shoving in a replacement

13:08.540 --> 13:10.540
who is not set up nor even works from a story standpoint,

13:10.540 --> 13:13.540
this is the message that Bay was sending Fox.

13:13.540 --> 13:17.540
You are an object. You are disposable. You can be replaced.

13:17.540 --> 13:19.540
What if she dumps us like the last girl?

13:19.540 --> 13:21.540
Excuse me. I like her.

13:21.540 --> 13:23.540
The first film brings up issues of gender iniquity

13:23.540 --> 13:25.540
and how men often don't take women seriously

13:25.540 --> 13:27.540
because they are objects to them.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.540
Why doesn't my little bunny just hop in the backseat?

13:29.540 --> 13:31.540
But at the same time, objectifies Michaela to the point that,

13:31.540 --> 13:33.540
for most viewers, she is impossible to take seriously

13:33.540 --> 13:35.540
because she is so impossibly beautiful,

13:35.540 --> 13:39.540
so impossibly dressed, so objectifyingly framed.

13:39.540 --> 13:43.540
Her impossibility is not in the text, but in the framing.

13:43.540 --> 13:47.540
Michaela Baines is the embodiment of what remains with the audience

13:47.540 --> 13:49.540
through cinematic language.

13:49.540 --> 13:53.540
Her painting and aesthetics supersede the rest of the text.

13:53.540 --> 13:57.540
Always, always, always.

14:19.540 --> 14:22.540
you
