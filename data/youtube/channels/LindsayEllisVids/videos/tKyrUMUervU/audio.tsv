0	4760	And now, at long last, in our not-very-deep trek into feminist film theory,
4760	10580	it is time to talk about Michaela Banes, the most well-rounded and worthwhile character in the Transformers movies.
12500	14500	What?
20340	25400	When people think about women in the Transformers movies, the first thing that comes to mind after that
25620	32440	Romeo and Juliet lost scene from the Age of Extinction is Megan Fox, but Megan Fox's character, Michaela Banes
32720	34720	Get it? Michaela
35360	36760	Banes
36760	40360	is just the beginning of discussion where women in these movies are concerned.
40620	44980	Because the first movie, easily the most cohesive of any of them from a screenplay perspective,
45220	51620	actually has some comment on the way women are treated by men who underestimate them by being overqualified for a thankless job,
52020	56940	by being dismissed by one's superiors in the workplace because they don't take you seriously because you're a girl.
57340	63440	Given that over the last decade these movies have become an emblem of all that is backward and misogynist in the world,
63620	68340	people have forgotten that the first movie is weirdly sympathetic to its female characters.
69580	70340	On paper.
70340	76380	But this sympathy to the female characters in the screenplay is undermined by the way the women are framed by the camera,
76380	80380	and the framing gives the audience a different takeaway than what we see on the page.
80580	83380	It squirts the fuel in so you can go faster.
85540	86860	I like to go faster.
86860	89660	Let's recap the plot of Transformers 1.
89700	98380	A down-on-her-luck working-class girl with a gift at hot-wiring and fixing cars gets swept up into a godlike clash of space car robots by a hapless idiot.
98380	100380	I just put in that light there.
100620	102540	And that disco ball.
102540	104540	So the light reflects off the disco ball.
105540	106540	Aw.
106540	108540	She is obviously skeptical at first.
108540	111540	Why would the alien space robots have any use for such a worthless dummy?
111540	115540	He seems incapable of even looking after himself, and she even has to save him a couple times.
116540	117540	He's gonna kill me!
122540	124540	But this girl has problems of her own.
124540	126540	Not only do the men in her life not respect her.
126540	127540	Hey, how about you let me drive?
127540	128540	Oh, no. No, no, no.
128540	129540	This is not a toy.
129540	130540	These 22s?
130540	131540	Romantic friends do this.
131540	133540	I mean, I'm not that friend.
133540	134540	I mean, I could be.
134540	135540	You in the training bra.
135540	136540	Do not test me.
136540	140540	Her dad is in jail and she herself has a juvie record for aiding and abetting.
140540	142540	You know those cars my dad used to teach me to fix?
142540	144540	Well, they weren't always his.
144540	145540	They're still cars.
145540	151540	But eventually she learns to see her involvement with the alien robots as a chance to use her bravery and her automotive skill set,
151540	155540	which everyone has always underestimated and not appreciated because she is a girl.
155540	159540	To not only get her juvenile record expunged, and to redeem her car thief dad,
160540	165540	but to help the alien space robots save the world from the other alien space robots.
165540	168540	You think I'm shallow, huh?
168540	174540	I think there's a lot more than meets the eye with you.
174540	178540	Michaela, the only human character with an interest in cars.
178540	182540	You've got a high-rise double pump carburetor. That's pretty impressive, Sam.
182540	185540	The only character with even some approximation of a backstory.
185540	188540	I have a record because I wouldn't turn my dad in.
188540	194540	The only character who self-actualizes, not because others tell her to, not because she is given instruction,
194540	198540	but because she realizes her self-worth on her own.
198540	203540	Oh, God, I can't even tell you how much I'm not your little bunny.
203540	206540	A few years ago, back when we were first kicking around the idea of this project,
206540	213540	I asked Twitter to describe Michaela's character and the results were telling.
214540	221540	Audiences thought it was a given that Michaela was worse written or acted than any of the other characters in the movie
221540	226540	when she very clearly wasn't, but people didn't notice that there was indeed more than meets the eye
226540	230540	because the camera was sending a different message than the script was,
230540	234540	namely that Michaela is not here as a character who grows and changes over the course of a narrative,
234540	237540	but as gratuitous eye candy.
237540	240540	If the theme of the movie is no sacrifice, no victory...
240540	244540	No sacrifice, no victory!
244540	248540	Sam has never sacrificed anything, which Michaela actually points out.
248540	251540	I have a record because I wouldn't turn my dad in.
251540	255540	One of you had to sacrifice anything in your perfect little life.
255540	260540	But Michaela has. Michaela's skill set, backstory, and character arc fit much more neatly with the theme
260540	264540	that the movie is at least going for than the main character himself.
264540	269540	So Transformers 1 isn't so much Sam's coming-of-age story as it is Michaela's.
269540	274540	So given this character, whom everyone underestimates, but is also the only character with any interest or history with cars,
274540	279540	something that might have even led her to, I don't know, discover something about Bumblebee,
279540	284540	like look under his hood and go, hmm, there's something different about this engine.
284540	287540	I think your car might be an alien robot.
287540	291540	Maybe have her established skill set pay off in some narrative way, but it doesn't.
291540	293540	Just pop the hood.
293540	298540	And that image of Michaela leaning over the car, talking about how men don't like that she has skills as a mechanic
298540	300540	because of her gender and the way she looks.
300540	303540	That's weird. I just wouldn't peg you for mechanical.
303540	305540	Well, you know, I don't really broadcast it.
305540	308540	Guys don't like it when you know more about cars than they do.
308540	312540	All while Sam leers at her and listens to not one word she is saying.
312540	315540	This is what we might call dissonance of framing.
315540	319540	The text is saying one thing, the framing is saying something else.
319540	321540	What do people remember from this scene?
321540	323540	Do they remember what Michaela says?
323540	326540	Guys don't like it when you know more about cars than they do.
327540	328540	He hates it.
328540	331540	Or do they remember the way Megan Fox's body was shot?
331540	334540	Michaela is emblematic of the problem with these movies.
334540	338540	Long movies that move so fast that the story is almost impossible to follow,
338540	343540	so aesthetic impressions get weighted much more heavily than thematic or narrative ones.
343540	347540	And when you have a director who is much more interested in frame-for-frame sake
347540	350540	rather than using the camera to emphasize the storytelling,
350540	353540	the narrative, the character, and theme are at war with the aesthetics.
353540	356540	The text says one thing, the camera says another,
356540	358540	and because this is a visual medium,
358540	361540	what the audience remembers is what the camera tells them.
361540	365540	Michaela is talking about how people don't see her as anything but a pair of T&A,
365540	369540	but all the while the camera is conveying to the audience that this is her value.
369540	373540	And unless you're a pedant like me who's obsessed with fixing the flaws of the screenplay
373540	375540	because it had potential, dammit!
375540	377540	That's all the audience takes from it.
377540	381540	On the other end of the spectrum are the women that are not frames of objective desire,
381540	383540	namely Sam's mother, played by Julie White.
383540	386540	Were you... masturbating?
388540	389540	Judy.
389540	393540	And director of national intelligence, Charlotte Meaning, played by Frances McDormand.
393540	396540	I don't care who you are if you breathe a word of what you've seen here.
396540	399540	You will do time for treason. Do you understand me?
399540	402540	White's character is almost entirely played for comedy.
402540	404540	Hey, professor, I'd do anything for an A.
404540	406540	All right, Grace Slick, we got some Slick.
406540	409540	You don't have to call it that word. If that makes you uncomfortable,
409540	412540	you can call it Sam's Happy Time.
412540	414540	March, young lady.
414540	417540	I love it when you call me young lady, you dirty old man.
417540	420540	It's just been a weird night. I've had a little bit to drink.
420540	423540	But McDormand's character seems to resent the fact that she is a woman at all.
423540	426540	See her reaction when she is called ma'am or madam.
426540	427540	Are you not?
427540	428540	Yes, ma'am, I am.
428540	431540	Stop with the ma'am. Enough with the ma'am. Do I look like a ma'am?
431540	433540	No, ma'am. Yes, ma'am, yes.
433540	435540	Feminism.jpg, am I right?
435540	440540	But don't worry, here comes John Turturro to put her, and all women, in their place.
440540	442540	Moving up in the world, huh?
442540	445540	Your booty looks excellent.
445540	447540	Women in these films are on two extremes.
447540	450540	Props of beauty shot in the same manner as Victoria's Secret models,
450540	453540	and one actual Victoria's Secret model.
453540	455540	This is your new lucky bunny.
455540	458540	Hey, it's almost like our director had directed Victoria's Secret commercials before.
458540	461540	And sexless butts of jokes.
461540	464540	The only noteworthy exception to this is NSA contractor Maggie Madsen
464540	466540	played by Rachel Taylor in the first movie,
466540	471540	who is the person who discovers that the Decepticons are trying to hack into national security networks.
471540	473540	There is nothing on Earth that complex.
473540	478540	What about an organism? A living organism. Maybe some kind of DNA-based computer.
478540	482540	No one believes her, so she breaks all of the laws and seeks out her friend Glenn,
482540	484540	played by Anthony Anderson,
484540	486540	Grandmama, drink your prune juice!
486540	488540	to help her figure out what is going on.
488540	491540	This doesn't really go anywhere and ultimately leads the two to discover nothing of consequence
491540	496540	and lands them in jail, where there is this nothing scene in which Anthony Anderson eats...
496540	498540	the whole plate.
498540	500540	I ate the whole plate.
502540	505540	Now for the sake of argument, we're going to ignore the fact that on the surface,
505540	508540	given that this is the first movie and no one knows about the robot aliens yet,
508540	510540	her proposal is absurd.
510540	512540	What about an organism?
512540	514540	What if it was a witch?
514540	516540	What if this is all a projection?
516540	518540	What if we're in the Matrix?
518540	520540	If the moon was made of ribs, would you eat it?
520540	522540	I know that that sounds crazy.
522540	523540	That's enough.
523540	524540	Ignoring that!
524540	529540	It is pretty clear that there is some gender-motivated bias in the way Voight's character talks to her.
529540	532540	If you don't get a filter on that brain-mouth thing, you're going to be off the team.
532540	533540	You understand?
533540	537540	But the dismissive way that her superiors treat Maggie isn't the only comment on women in the workplace
537540	538540	buried in this movie.
538540	539540	Yes, Mr. President.
539540	542540	Yeah, can you wrangle me up some ding-dongs, darling?
542540	545540	During the scene while the Decepticons are trying to break into Air Force One,
545540	549540	an Air Force One Secret Service woman complains about having to be overqualified
549540	551540	to effectively be a glorified stewardess.
551540	553540	Trying the Air Force to reinvent ding-dongs.
554540	555540	I'll be in storage.
555540	557540	Maggie is exceptionally beautiful, sure,
557540	560540	but she's not framed as a commodity like Michaela is,
560540	562540	nor do her male colleagues treat her as anything but an equal.
562540	565540	Only her superior, the Secretary of Defense played by John Voight,
565540	568540	does the go-away little girl-the-big-men-are-talking thing.
568540	572540	This mirrors Michaela being dismissed for her skill set in a male-dominated field,
572540	575540	cars, yet framing her like she is in a car commercial.
575540	577540	This is even more overt in the third movie,
577540	581540	when Bay combines the camera work with some dialogue to compare Carly to a literal car.
581540	585540	Look at the curves. Elegant, isn't it? Beautiful.
585540	587540	Built to evoke the body of the ideal woman.
587540	590540	The first movie constantly subverts the gender status quo
590540	592540	but then reinforces it by way of framing,
592540	595540	which objectifies or undermines the female characters.
595540	597540	That's what I find interesting about the first movie.
597540	599540	It acknowledges that in a sphere like this,
599540	603540	the sphere of technology, the military, and automotive mechanics,
603540	607540	a woman is presumed to be lesser, a secretary, or likely way out of her league.
607540	612540	This is, in part, due to the tendency for people to see young, beautiful, or feminine women as empty shells.
612540	614540	Props, you might say.
614540	617540	And nowhere is this more clear than in the chimera that is Carly.
617540	619540	What is that?
619540	621540	This is your new lucky bunny.
621540	624540	The screenplay for Dark of the Moon was mostly complete before Megan Fox was fired,
624540	628540	so Carly hits all of the beats that Michaela's character had built up to,
628540	632540	ignoring the weird, was a White House intern introduction that is just kind of slapped on,
632540	636540	the fact that Carly is a curator of automobiles for a rich guy makes sense for Michaela.
636540	639540	Michaela's skill set is paying off in the new economy,
639540	641540	and Sam's is not, because it's mostly non-existent.
641540	643540	He has built up no professional contacts,
643540	646540	he is a nervous wreck, and also a total douche.
647540	649540	And then the film ends with this,
657540	661540	which does not make sense for these two characters after only one movie of buildup.
661540	664540	This was supposed to be the same character from movies one and two.
664540	668540	If you look at it in the sense that it was a deliberate story choice to replace Michaela with Carly,
668540	670540	which, you know, it wasn't, but let's pretend that it was,
670540	673540	in a narrative sense, it's even more depressing.
673540	676540	Because the main arc between Sam and Michaela in Transformers 2,
676540	679540	really Michaela's only arc in 2 because this one was mostly written by Bay himself
679540	682540	because it was in pre-production during the writer's strike of 2008,
682540	684540	Tangent!
684540	687540	is that Michaela wants Sam to tell her that he loves her.
687540	689540	I adore you.
690540	692540	That's not the word that I want to hear right now.
692540	694540	What are you talking about? It's the same word as the other word.
694540	695540	It's not the same word.
695540	697540	And neither is willing to say it first.
697540	699540	And eventually, Sam wins.
700540	702540	With my voice, I love you.
702540	704540	You know, maybe by dying.
704540	706540	There are some begrudging proclamations of love.
706540	709540	Look what it is for you to tell me that you love me.
711540	712540	You said it first.
712540	713540	But the real kicker?
713540	716540	It's not that he can't admit it because men and commitment.
716540	718540	It's because he doesn't love her.
718540	721540	But she is the trophy, she is the ward, and therefore disposable.
721540	725540	And therefore in movie 3, he has another disposable beautiful girlfriend.
725540	727540	Get in the car, please.
727540	729540	Another hood ornament, another decoration.
729540	733540	Who she is does not matter because she is not a person to Sam.
733540	734540	Nothing is real to Sam.
734540	737540	Everything is an object because he is so navel-gazing, self-obsessed,
737540	740540	lacking in empathy, and detached from reality.
742540	745540	Everything and everyone, the Autobots, his girlfriend,
745540	747540	is an object to be used and disposed.
747540	749540	She'll always be my first car.
749540	752540	And if we take Michaela and Carly as two separate characters,
752540	755540	which, for the sake of narrative argument, let's...
755540	757540	What if she dumps us like the last girl?
757540	759540	Excuse me. I like her.
759540	762540	Michaela is a far more rounded and realized character than Carly,
762540	765540	even up to the fact that she dumps her boyfriend because,
765540	767540	after putting up with him for so long,
767540	771540	she realizes that he, like everyone else in her life, does not love her.
771540	772540	You said it first.
773540	776540	To him, as to everyone, she is not a person, but an object,
776540	778540	a trophy, a hood ornament, a reward.
778540	781540	So she leaves him off-screen.
781540	784540	We see this mirrored in the real-life adventures of Megan Fox as well.
784540	788540	In a meta-textual sense, by booting Michaela and shoving in a replacement
788540	790540	who is not set up nor even works from a story standpoint,
790540	793540	this is the message that Bay was sending Fox.
793540	797540	You are an object. You are disposable. You can be replaced.
797540	799540	What if she dumps us like the last girl?
799540	801540	Excuse me. I like her.
801540	803540	The first film brings up issues of gender iniquity
803540	805540	and how men often don't take women seriously
805540	807540	because they are objects to them.
807540	809540	Why doesn't my little bunny just hop in the backseat?
809540	811540	But at the same time, objectifies Michaela to the point that,
811540	813540	for most viewers, she is impossible to take seriously
813540	815540	because she is so impossibly beautiful,
815540	819540	so impossibly dressed, so objectifyingly framed.
819540	823540	Her impossibility is not in the text, but in the framing.
823540	827540	Michaela Baines is the embodiment of what remains with the audience
827540	829540	through cinematic language.
829540	833540	Her painting and aesthetics supersede the rest of the text.
833540	837540	Always, always, always.
859540	862540	you
