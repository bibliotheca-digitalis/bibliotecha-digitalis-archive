1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
And now, at long last, in our not-very-deep trek into feminist film theory,

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:10,580
it is time to talk about Michaela Banes, the most well-rounded and worthwhile character in the Transformers movies.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,500
What?

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,400
When people think about women in the Transformers movies, the first thing that comes to mind after that

5
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:32,440
Romeo and Juliet lost scene from the Age of Extinction is Megan Fox, but Megan Fox's character, Michaela Banes

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,720
Get it? Michaela

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,760
Banes

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,360
is just the beginning of discussion where women in these movies are concerned.

9
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,980
Because the first movie, easily the most cohesive of any of them from a screenplay perspective,

10
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:51,620
actually has some comment on the way women are treated by men who underestimate them by being overqualified for a thankless job,

11
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,940
by being dismissed by one's superiors in the workplace because they don't take you seriously because you're a girl.

12
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:03,440
Given that over the last decade these movies have become an emblem of all that is backward and misogynist in the world,

13
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,340
people have forgotten that the first movie is weirdly sympathetic to its female characters.

14
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,340
On paper.

15
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:16,380
But this sympathy to the female characters in the screenplay is undermined by the way the women are framed by the camera,

16
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,380
and the framing gives the audience a different takeaway than what we see on the page.

17
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,380
It squirts the fuel in so you can go faster.

18
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,860
I like to go faster.

19
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,660
Let's recap the plot of Transformers 1.

20
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:38,380
A down-on-her-luck working-class girl with a gift at hot-wiring and fixing cars gets swept up into a godlike clash of space car robots by a hapless idiot.

21
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,380
I just put in that light there.

22
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,540
And that disco ball.

23
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,540
So the light reflects off the disco ball.

24
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,540
Aw.

25
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,540
She is obviously skeptical at first.

26
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,540
Why would the alien space robots have any use for such a worthless dummy?

27
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,540
He seems incapable of even looking after himself, and she even has to save him a couple times.

28
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,540
He's gonna kill me!

29
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,540
But this girl has problems of her own.

30
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,540
Not only do the men in her life not respect her.

31
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,540
Hey, how about you let me drive?

32
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,540
Oh, no. No, no, no.

33
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,540
This is not a toy.

34
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,540
These 22s?

35
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,540
Romantic friends do this.

36
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,540
I mean, I'm not that friend.

37
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,540
I mean, I could be.

38
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,540
You in the training bra.

39
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,540
Do not test me.

40
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,540
Her dad is in jail and she herself has a juvie record for aiding and abetting.

41
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,540
You know those cars my dad used to teach me to fix?

42
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,540
Well, they weren't always his.

43
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,540
They're still cars.

44
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:31,540
But eventually she learns to see her involvement with the alien robots as a chance to use her bravery and her automotive skill set,

45
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,540
which everyone has always underestimated and not appreciated because she is a girl.

46
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,540
To not only get her juvenile record expunged, and to redeem her car thief dad,

47
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:45,540
but to help the alien space robots save the world from the other alien space robots.

48
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,540
You think I'm shallow, huh?

49
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:54,540
I think there's a lot more than meets the eye with you.

50
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,540
Michaela, the only human character with an interest in cars.

51
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,540
You've got a high-rise double pump carburetor. That's pretty impressive, Sam.

52
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,540
The only character with even some approximation of a backstory.

53
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,540
I have a record because I wouldn't turn my dad in.

54
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:14,540
The only character who self-actualizes, not because others tell her to, not because she is given instruction,

55
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,540
but because she realizes her self-worth on her own.

56
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,540
Oh, God, I can't even tell you how much I'm not your little bunny.

57
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,540
A few years ago, back when we were first kicking around the idea of this project,

58
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:33,540
I asked Twitter to describe Michaela's character and the results were telling.

59
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:41,540
Audiences thought it was a given that Michaela was worse written or acted than any of the other characters in the movie

60
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,540
when she very clearly wasn't, but people didn't notice that there was indeed more than meets the eye

61
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,540
because the camera was sending a different message than the script was,

62
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,540
namely that Michaela is not here as a character who grows and changes over the course of a narrative,

63
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,540
but as gratuitous eye candy.

64
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,540
If the theme of the movie is no sacrifice, no victory...

65
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,540
No sacrifice, no victory!

66
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,540
Sam has never sacrificed anything, which Michaela actually points out.

67
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,540
I have a record because I wouldn't turn my dad in.

68
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,540
One of you had to sacrifice anything in your perfect little life.

69
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:20,540
But Michaela has. Michaela's skill set, backstory, and character arc fit much more neatly with the theme

70
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,540
that the movie is at least going for than the main character himself.

71
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,540
So Transformers 1 isn't so much Sam's coming-of-age story as it is Michaela's.

72
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,540
So given this character, whom everyone underestimates, but is also the only character with any interest or history with cars,

73
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,540
something that might have even led her to, I don't know, discover something about Bumblebee,

74
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,540
like look under his hood and go, hmm, there's something different about this engine.

75
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,540
I think your car might be an alien robot.

76
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,540
Maybe have her established skill set pay off in some narrative way, but it doesn't.

77
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,540
Just pop the hood.

78
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:58,540
And that image of Michaela leaning over the car, talking about how men don't like that she has skills as a mechanic

79
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,540
because of her gender and the way she looks.

80
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,540
That's weird. I just wouldn't peg you for mechanical.

81
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,540
Well, you know, I don't really broadcast it.

82
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,540
Guys don't like it when you know more about cars than they do.

83
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,540
All while Sam leers at her and listens to not one word she is saying.

84
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,540
This is what we might call dissonance of framing.

85
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,540
The text is saying one thing, the framing is saying something else.

86
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,540
What do people remember from this scene?

87
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,540
Do they remember what Michaela says?

88
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,540
Guys don't like it when you know more about cars than they do.

89
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,540
He hates it.

90
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,540
Or do they remember the way Megan Fox's body was shot?

91
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,540
Michaela is emblematic of the problem with these movies.

92
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,540
Long movies that move so fast that the story is almost impossible to follow,

93
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,540
so aesthetic impressions get weighted much more heavily than thematic or narrative ones.

94
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,540
And when you have a director who is much more interested in frame-for-frame sake

95
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,540
rather than using the camera to emphasize the storytelling,

96
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,540
the narrative, the character, and theme are at war with the aesthetics.

97
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,540
The text says one thing, the camera says another,

98
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,540
and because this is a visual medium,

99
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,540
what the audience remembers is what the camera tells them.

100
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,540
Michaela is talking about how people don't see her as anything but a pair of T&A,

101
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,540
but all the while the camera is conveying to the audience that this is her value.

102
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,540
And unless you're a pedant like me who's obsessed with fixing the flaws of the screenplay

103
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,540
because it had potential, dammit!

104
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,540
That's all the audience takes from it.

105
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,540
On the other end of the spectrum are the women that are not frames of objective desire,

106
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,540
namely Sam's mother, played by Julie White.

107
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,540
Were you... masturbating?

108
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,540
Judy.

109
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,540
And director of national intelligence, Charlotte Meaning, played by Frances McDormand.

110
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,540
I don't care who you are if you breathe a word of what you've seen here.

111
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,540
You will do time for treason. Do you understand me?

112
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,540
White's character is almost entirely played for comedy.

113
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,540
Hey, professor, I'd do anything for an A.

114
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,540
All right, Grace Slick, we got some Slick.

115
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,540
You don't have to call it that word. If that makes you uncomfortable,

116
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,540
you can call it Sam's Happy Time.

117
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,540
March, young lady.

118
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,540
I love it when you call me young lady, you dirty old man.

119
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,540
It's just been a weird night. I've had a little bit to drink.

120
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,540
But McDormand's character seems to resent the fact that she is a woman at all.

121
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,540
See her reaction when she is called ma'am or madam.

122
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,540
Are you not?

123
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,540
Yes, ma'am, I am.

124
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,540
Stop with the ma'am. Enough with the ma'am. Do I look like a ma'am?

125
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,540
No, ma'am. Yes, ma'am, yes.

126
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,540
Feminism.jpg, am I right?

127
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:20,540
But don't worry, here comes John Turturro to put her, and all women, in their place.

128
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,540
Moving up in the world, huh?

129
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,540
Your booty looks excellent.

130
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,540
Women in these films are on two extremes.

131
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,540
Props of beauty shot in the same manner as Victoria's Secret models,

132
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,540
and one actual Victoria's Secret model.

133
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,540
This is your new lucky bunny.

134
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,540
Hey, it's almost like our director had directed Victoria's Secret commercials before.

135
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,540
And sexless butts of jokes.

136
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,540
The only noteworthy exception to this is NSA contractor Maggie Madsen

137
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,540
played by Rachel Taylor in the first movie,

138
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:51,540
who is the person who discovers that the Decepticons are trying to hack into national security networks.

139
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,540
There is nothing on Earth that complex.

140
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:58,540
What about an organism? A living organism. Maybe some kind of DNA-based computer.

141
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,540
No one believes her, so she breaks all of the laws and seeks out her friend Glenn,

142
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,540
played by Anthony Anderson,

143
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,540
Grandmama, drink your prune juice!

144
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,540
to help her figure out what is going on.

145
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,540
This doesn't really go anywhere and ultimately leads the two to discover nothing of consequence

146
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,540
and lands them in jail, where there is this nothing scene in which Anthony Anderson eats...

147
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,540
the whole plate.

148
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,540
I ate the whole plate.

149
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,540
Now for the sake of argument, we're going to ignore the fact that on the surface,

150
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,540
given that this is the first movie and no one knows about the robot aliens yet,

151
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,540
her proposal is absurd.

152
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,540
What about an organism?

153
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,540
What if it was a witch?

154
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,540
What if this is all a projection?

155
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,540
What if we're in the Matrix?

156
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,540
If the moon was made of ribs, would you eat it?

157
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,540
I know that that sounds crazy.

158
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,540
That's enough.

159
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,540
Ignoring that!

160
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:49,540
It is pretty clear that there is some gender-motivated bias in the way Voight's character talks to her.

161
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,540
If you don't get a filter on that brain-mouth thing, you're going to be off the team.

162
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,540
You understand?

163
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,540
But the dismissive way that her superiors treat Maggie isn't the only comment on women in the workplace

164
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,540
buried in this movie.

165
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,540
Yes, Mr. President.

166
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,540
Yeah, can you wrangle me up some ding-dongs, darling?

167
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,540
During the scene while the Decepticons are trying to break into Air Force One,

168
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,540
an Air Force One Secret Service woman complains about having to be overqualified

169
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,540
to effectively be a glorified stewardess.

170
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,540
Trying the Air Force to reinvent ding-dongs.

171
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,540
I'll be in storage.

172
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,540
Maggie is exceptionally beautiful, sure,

173
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,540
but she's not framed as a commodity like Michaela is,

174
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,540
nor do her male colleagues treat her as anything but an equal.

175
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,540
Only her superior, the Secretary of Defense played by John Voight,

176
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,540
does the go-away little girl-the-big-men-are-talking thing.

177
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,540
This mirrors Michaela being dismissed for her skill set in a male-dominated field,

178
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,540
cars, yet framing her like she is in a car commercial.

179
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,540
This is even more overt in the third movie,

180
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,540
when Bay combines the camera work with some dialogue to compare Carly to a literal car.

181
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,540
Look at the curves. Elegant, isn't it? Beautiful.

182
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,540
Built to evoke the body of the ideal woman.

183
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,540
The first movie constantly subverts the gender status quo

184
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,540
but then reinforces it by way of framing,

185
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,540
which objectifies or undermines the female characters.

186
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,540
That's what I find interesting about the first movie.

187
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,540
It acknowledges that in a sphere like this,

188
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,540
the sphere of technology, the military, and automotive mechanics,

189
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,540
a woman is presumed to be lesser, a secretary, or likely way out of her league.

190
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:12,540
This is, in part, due to the tendency for people to see young, beautiful, or feminine women as empty shells.

191
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,540
Props, you might say.

192
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,540
And nowhere is this more clear than in the chimera that is Carly.

193
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,540
What is that?

194
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,540
This is your new lucky bunny.

195
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,540
The screenplay for Dark of the Moon was mostly complete before Megan Fox was fired,

196
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,540
so Carly hits all of the beats that Michaela's character had built up to,

197
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,540
ignoring the weird, was a White House intern introduction that is just kind of slapped on,

198
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,540
the fact that Carly is a curator of automobiles for a rich guy makes sense for Michaela.

199
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,540
Michaela's skill set is paying off in the new economy,

200
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,540
and Sam's is not, because it's mostly non-existent.

201
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,540
He has built up no professional contacts,

202
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,540
he is a nervous wreck, and also a total douche.

203
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,540
And then the film ends with this,

204
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,540
which does not make sense for these two characters after only one movie of buildup.

205
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,540
This was supposed to be the same character from movies one and two.

206
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,540
If you look at it in the sense that it was a deliberate story choice to replace Michaela with Carly,

207
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,540
which, you know, it wasn't, but let's pretend that it was,

208
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,540
in a narrative sense, it's even more depressing.

209
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,540
Because the main arc between Sam and Michaela in Transformers 2,

210
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,540
really Michaela's only arc in 2 because this one was mostly written by Bay himself

211
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,540
because it was in pre-production during the writer's strike of 2008,

212
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,540
Tangent!

213
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,540
is that Michaela wants Sam to tell her that he loves her.

214
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,540
I adore you.

215
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,540
That's not the word that I want to hear right now.

216
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,540
What are you talking about? It's the same word as the other word.

217
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,540
It's not the same word.

218
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,540
And neither is willing to say it first.

219
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,540
And eventually, Sam wins.

220
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,540
With my voice, I love you.

221
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,540
You know, maybe by dying.

222
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,540
There are some begrudging proclamations of love.

223
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,540
Look what it is for you to tell me that you love me.

224
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,540
You said it first.

225
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,540
But the real kicker?

226
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,540
It's not that he can't admit it because men and commitment.

227
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,540
It's because he doesn't love her.

228
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,540
But she is the trophy, she is the ward, and therefore disposable.

229
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,540
And therefore in movie 3, he has another disposable beautiful girlfriend.

230
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,540
Get in the car, please.

231
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,540
Another hood ornament, another decoration.

232
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,540
Who she is does not matter because she is not a person to Sam.

233
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,540
Nothing is real to Sam.

234
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,540
Everything is an object because he is so navel-gazing, self-obsessed,

235
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,540
lacking in empathy, and detached from reality.

236
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,540
Everything and everyone, the Autobots, his girlfriend,

237
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,540
is an object to be used and disposed.

238
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,540
She'll always be my first car.

239
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,540
And if we take Michaela and Carly as two separate characters,

240
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,540
which, for the sake of narrative argument, let's...

241
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,540
What if she dumps us like the last girl?

242
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,540
Excuse me. I like her.

243
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,540
Michaela is a far more rounded and realized character than Carly,

244
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,540
even up to the fact that she dumps her boyfriend because,

245
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,540
after putting up with him for so long,

246
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,540
she realizes that he, like everyone else in her life, does not love her.

247
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,540
You said it first.

248
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,540
To him, as to everyone, she is not a person, but an object,

249
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,540
a trophy, a hood ornament, a reward.

250
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,540
So she leaves him off-screen.

251
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,540
We see this mirrored in the real-life adventures of Megan Fox as well.

252
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,540
In a meta-textual sense, by booting Michaela and shoving in a replacement

253
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,540
who is not set up nor even works from a story standpoint,

254
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,540
this is the message that Bay was sending Fox.

255
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,540
You are an object. You are disposable. You can be replaced.

256
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,540
What if she dumps us like the last girl?

257
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,540
Excuse me. I like her.

258
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,540
The first film brings up issues of gender iniquity

259
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,540
and how men often don't take women seriously

260
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,540
because they are objects to them.

261
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,540
Why doesn't my little bunny just hop in the backseat?

262
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,540
But at the same time, objectifies Michaela to the point that,

263
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,540
for most viewers, she is impossible to take seriously

264
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,540
because she is so impossibly beautiful,

265
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,540
so impossibly dressed, so objectifyingly framed.

266
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,540
Her impossibility is not in the text, but in the framing.

267
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,540
Michaela Baines is the embodiment of what remains with the audience

268
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,540
through cinematic language.

269
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,540
Her painting and aesthetics supersede the rest of the text.

270
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,540
Always, always, always.

271
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,540
you
