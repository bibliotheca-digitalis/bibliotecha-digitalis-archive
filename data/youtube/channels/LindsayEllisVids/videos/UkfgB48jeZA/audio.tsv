0	4200	So I'm sitting in front of every book I own, so I can trick people into thinking that I read,
4200	12100	and I guess as a thank you, slash in honor of, I'm not actually sure, am I congratulating myself or am I, like, thanking you, the viewer?
12100	15700	Well anyway, it's a Q&A for reaching 400,000 subscribers.
15700	20000	And no, the eyeliner isn't really on brand, but I just felt like it.
20000	20700	Die mad.
20700	29800	And thank you for smashing that like button, smashing that subscribe boy, it's your dick tarantula button.
29800	35800	By the way, before we get started, if you didn't catch it, I actually have a new series on PBS Digital Studios' channel.
35800	37800	It's called It's Lit.
37800	42300	It's a YouTube video essay companion piece series to PBS's The Great American Read.
42300	48300	Okay, so I asked people on Twitter.com to ask me questions for a 400k Q&A.
48300	52800	I haven't done it before because I am really lazy and forgetful.
52800	58300	But I'm doing it this time, and the way I'm actually remembering to do it is I'm actually reading these questions for the first time.
58300	60300	I'm sure they're very nice and respectful.
64800	69300	Honestly, I didn't really care about the Dark Universe until they announced before The Mummy came out
69300	73300	that they were also going to do Phantom of the Opera and Hunchback of Notre Dame.
73300	82800	And the idea of a grim dark Hunchback of Notre Dame in the style of, like, Zack Snyder was the most amazing thing in the world to me.
82800	88800	And I just wanted it, like, burning, and I was honestly heartbroken that The Mummy tanked
88800	93800	because I wanted Ansel Elgort as Quasimodo in grim dark Hunchback.
93800	98300	And don't even get me started on the Dark Universe Phantom of the Opera.
98300	100300	You know, it would have to be modern.
100300	105800	He's probably going to be, like, Stuart Townsend in Queen of the Damned levels of camp.
105800	106800	Uh...
106800	112300	So I think my hypothetical Dark Universe is probably better than it would have actually ended up being.
112300	115800	Or at least more interesting, but since it only lives in my mind, there you go.
129800	134300	I have a really easy answer for that, and that is the first two X-Men movies,
134300	138800	which are directed by Bryan Singer and are kind of a source of consternation
138800	144300	because he was the one who really made the subtext of the coming out narrative basically text.
144300	146300	But he's also a gross creep.
146300	149800	But the thing is, this has been known for a really long time.
149800	155300	Like, when I went back to finish my degree at USC, in the time since I dropped out and came back,
155300	161300	they changed the Critical Studies department to the Bryan Singer Department of Critical Studies.
161300	167800	They have since undone this, but the fact is that Bryan Singer has been a known creep for a really, really long time in Hollywood.
168300	169300	What the fuck, USC?
173800	175300	For that one, I have to go with The Jungle Book.
175300	179800	I think that the new movie kind of actually explored, like, why fire is bad and dangerous
179800	184300	and why Mowgli is kind of uniquely able to wield it and why Shere Khan actually has a point.
184300	191800	So that one I thought kind of had a raison d'etre more than just, I don't know, progressivizing the original.
191800	194300	I thought it actually did something interesting with it.
198800	200300	No, not really.
200300	205800	Because I think at the end of the day, like, your feelings are your feelings and I wish people would kind of own that.
205800	207300	Feelings are not rational.
207300	211300	You can rationalize them by having supporting evidence.
211300	215800	But at the end of the day, like, if you have a criticism, it's probably because you had an emotional reaction.
215800	223300	Finding words and supporting evidence and being able to articulate why you felt that emotional reaction is kind of the best you can do.
223800	227800	And I think the worst people can do is have an emotional reaction and not really explore it
227800	232300	and not really put words to it, not really articulate why they feel the way they feel.
232300	235800	Either that or just delude themselves, which is also a really popular thing to do these days.
238800	241300	I don't know. I think she'd honestly have a lot of fun.
241300	245300	I think it would be really disquieting to be in The Purge with her because she'd be, like,
245300	247800	going around to, like, all the rival games and being like,
247800	250800	Ooh! The Purge!
253800	255300	Someone asked me about this earlier today.
255300	259300	Shrek would be one because I don't like Shrek, but it is beloved by a generation.
259300	264800	So that would be kind of tantamount to, like, a Gen-Xer explaining to 90s kids why Aladdin sucks.
264800	269300	The Prince of Egypt would be another because I really hate that movie for a lot of reasons.
269300	275800	But then I would have to be, like, getting into my problems with organized religion being adapted for pop culture
275800	279800	and everybody would lose. No one would win. I'm not touching that.
279800	285300	See, I just released a video about Disney, so that's all anyone's asking me about.
285300	287300	Which of the Autobots is the sexiest?
287300	291300	Well, that depends on what you're into. If you're into a bottom, there's Beachcomber.
291300	295800	If you're into the arrogant prick type, there's Rodimus, but then I guess I'm going into the comics for that.
295800	299300	A lot of people like Drift because he's, like, spiritual but athletic.
299300	301800	Personally, I still gotta go with Wheeljack.
301800	305300	Sorry, Starscream. You're not an Autobot.
305300	308800	This is my masterpiece, Wheeljack. He's actually my favorite.
308800	310800	He used to be transformed. He's getting dusty.
310800	313300	What was the hardest video to put together and why?
313300	315800	You know, at any given time, it's always the one I just released.
315800	321300	Recently would have to be the Marxism episode of the whole plate.
321300	326300	But the thing about, like, Marxism and film theory is that Marxism influences a lot of academics,
326300	330800	but there are not that many film theorists that are like, I'm the Marxist one.
330800	334300	So it was actually really hard.
334300	338800	And that's why we ended up just going, yeah, just go with Adorno because it was just, it was so much.
338800	342800	Like, just applying the Frankfurt School alone was just so much,
342800	345800	but then you get into, like, the 60s and the 70s and then the feminists show up.
345800	351800	It's just a really, really, really convoluted topic and I wasn't really prepared for how convoluted it was.
351800	357800	In my education, they didn't really teach Marxism as, like, this week we're learning about Marxism,
357800	361800	the way they did for, like, feminism and critical race theory, auteur theory.
361800	369300	Those were a lot easier to distill in a simple way because I had been taught them in my intro class back in 2003.
369300	374300	So, like, having to distill that into an intro class type video was really, really hard.
374300	379300	And I don't, I don't think I succeeded as well as I would have liked to, but eh.
379300	382800	As a YouTuber, do you follow other channels as a viewer slash fan?
382800	385800	Are there any that are your favorite or you'd recommend to us?
385800	391800	Well, actually, I probably right now watch YouTube more than anything except for RuPaul's Drag Race.
391800	396800	But on that note, like, there are obviously a lot of people that do similar videos to what I do,
396800	400800	like Movies with Mikey, of course, ContraPoints.
400800	406300	I binge her videos all the time still and that's why I steal her jokes so often, sometimes with permission.
406300	410800	Folding Ideas, obviously, Patrick Williams, CGP Grey.
410800	414800	My honest, true go-to is CakeTube.
414800	417800	Like, cake decorating YouTube.
417800	424300	Like, the two, the two I kind of obsess with the most are How to Cake It and Man About Cake.
424300	429300	And, of course, everything that has ever spun off from RuPaul's Drag Race.
429300	437800	The thing I keep watching over and over again lately is Ugh, starring Trixie Mattel and Katja.
437800	443300	It ended, like, well over a year ago, but I only just discovered it, so it's new to me.
443300	444800	Oh, and Jenny Nicholson, too, I guess.
444800	445800	Here's an easy one.
445800	449800	Is it truly possible for sexual violence to be depicted well on film?
451300	454300	That's the easy questions for a YouTube Q&A.
454300	457300	Well, here's the thing, Chris.
457300	460800	Um, a lot of this is gonna be, at the end of the day, subjective.
460800	466800	And I think the problem with a lot of film criticism is that people kind of expect there to be, like, a moral barometer.
466800	468800	When, at the end of the day, it's like, there are things like context.
468800	473800	Who is writing the thing? What is it on HBO?
473800	478800	Personally, I think, in isolation, there can be arguments to be made,
478800	485800	but overall, the broader trend is, tends to dramatize pain in a way that I think is cliched.
485800	491800	So, I think it's really hard to separate isolated depictions of sexual violence with, like, the broader trend.
491800	493800	And the other thing is, like, that's changing constantly.
493800	496800	So, what's, like, maybe this year, be like, hmm, that was tasteful.
496800	498800	Ten years from now will be, like, unacceptable.
498800	502800	So, that's honestly, basically, kind of an impossible question to answer.
502800	510800	Personally, I think it's overdone and not done well enough often to really justify it as a common enough dramatic device,
510800	515800	as it is, especially in the golden age of television, which we are apparently living through.
515800	517800	Have you copyrighted Thanks I Hate It yet?
517800	521800	No! That's, like, a phrase.
521800	525800	There's even a really big Facebook group called Thanks I Hate It.
525800	527800	Which Starscream is best? Ooh.
527800	529800	Well, we've already been through this.
529800	534800	While I am, of course, always deeply partial to the original Chris Latta,
534800	540800	I think my personal favorite Starscream is Transformers Prime, Alliance continuity.
540800	544800	And, oh, what's his name? Oh, God. I've met him.
544800	549800	I can't remember his name. The guy who, okay, Transformers Prime Starscream.
549800	552800	His name escapes me. I think it's Steve.
552800	556800	Are there any essays you'd like to redo slash update? All of them?
556800	558800	When people come up to me and say, like,
558800	562800	Oh, my God, you said this thing, like, about half the time I have no idea what they're talking about,
562800	566800	because the second I'm done with a thing, I very rarely, rarely watch it again.
566800	570800	Every time I watch something, I'm like, Oh, God, I should have done this. I should have praised this better.
570800	574800	Oh, I'm repeating words. I hate this edit. There's a dropped frame. There's a dropped clip.
574800	577800	My makeup's terrible. Oh, my God, that lighting. I look like a glowworm.
577800	582800	Really, basically anything I did before I departed the channel that shall not be named.
582800	585800	Except for the Freddie Got Fingered review. That one I'm still pretty proud of.
585800	587800	It's my legacy.
587800	591800	If you can go back to your 18-year-old you, what would your advice be?
591800	593800	Don't ever mix Xanax and alcohol.
593800	597800	I noticed you seem to go to Disney parks a lot. Super cool. What's your favorite attraction and why?
597800	602800	Honestly, it's the goddamn Guardians of the Galaxy, Mission Breakout, Fight Me.
602800	607800	But now I might not be because it's always going to make me sad because of this dumb James Gunn thing.
607800	609800	Hashtag Rehire James Gunn.
609800	611800	What are all those books behind you?
611800	614800	I went after Disney War after you cited it in an earlier video and loved it.
614800	617800	So if you have other book recommendations, it would really make me happy.
617800	622800	Since I shot this not that long ago, I haven't moved the books since I shot the Beauty and the Beast video.
622800	626800	This is, of course, Disney War. As you can see, it's really, really long.
627800	632800	It is the truth that with Audible I actually did listen to this one on Audible
632800	635800	because I have a really hard time with nonfiction that's this long.
635800	638800	So it's better if I just listen to it over the course of like three months.
638800	642800	An Absolutely Remarkable Things by Hank Green.
642800	644800	It's out September 5th.
644800	648800	And I just got this in the mail like two days ago, so I haven't read it yet. Sorry, Hank.
648800	650800	It's funny that I'm shilling for Audible.
650800	654800	This is not a sponsored video, but this was another Audible.
654800	659800	One of my favorite nonfiction books of all time, The Power Broker by Robert A. Caro.
659800	661800	Robert Moses and the Rise and Fall of New York.
661800	667800	I have the hard copy because I need it because the hard copy has like all these cool maps and stuff in it.
667800	672800	If I really like a book on Audible, I'll buy the hard copy just so I can have it for research purposes.
672800	674800	And that's why I have a hard copy of Disney War.
674800	678800	Here was a formative book. Deconstructing Disney.
678800	683800	This one's actually from college. I mean, it's basic, but there's some of it that's also dumb as hell.
683800	688800	There's like an entire chapter about how Hercules is a parable of the Clinton administration.
688800	693800	Hercules, as an inscription of Clinton, is the victim of a massive right-wing conspiracy.
693800	697800	Hades, god of the underworld, is planning a hostile takeover bid, and is told by the Fates that,
697800	699800	should Hercules fight, you will fail.
699800	703800	The conspiracy narrative favored by the more distraught Democrats during Clinton's impeachment process
703800	708800	was that Kenneth Starr's politically motivated prosecution was also underpinned by the tobacco industry.
708800	710800	See, Hades smokes a cigar.
710800	717800	See, this book was honestly where I realized that academics could be utterly full of shit.
717800	721800	This is my favorite book by Octavia Butler, Parable of the Sower.
721800	725800	Here of course is Awoken by Sarah Ellenson, the most important book ever written.
725800	730800	The Girl with All the Gifts. I didn't actually see the movie, but I really loved this book.
730800	733800	Stephen King's On Writing, also very good.
733800	738800	I'm just going by what's convenient over here. I have other books on other bookshelves, but that would mean I'd have to get up.
738800	744800	Is there a movie that genuinely surprised you, be it an expectations twist or what you believe it would be before you actually watched it?
744800	749800	The first movie that genuinely surprised me was Barry Sonnenfeld's Men in Black, 1997.
749800	754800	I thought it was gonna suck, but it changed my life because I loved it so much.
754800	759800	But another recent one would be Mad Max Fury Road, but I think that one just surprised everybody.
759800	763800	Where does your sharp fascination with exploring Disney come from?
763800	769800	Honestly, it probably comes from the fact that the very first film studies class I ever took was about Disney,
769800	776800	and therefore it's just kind of hardwired into my brain that Disney equals a thing to be constructed,
776800	779800	which is funny because I was just throwing shade at deconstructing Disney over here.
779800	787800	But also honestly just because Disney was really important to me growing up, and the older I get, the more still emotionally involved I am.
787800	792800	And also, living in California now, I just spend a lot of goddamn time at the parks,
792800	796800	and going to Disney World is like the thing I look forward to every year.
796800	799800	Why do all of your Elon Musk memes make me feel cursed?
799800	803800	Probably because they are, Jessie.
803800	806800	The worst Disney sequel in your opinion?
806800	812800	Well, I've actually done a video on that, but since I don't watch my old stuff I can't remember what I said.
812800	820800	I'm pretty sure it was either Beauty and the Beast, Belle's Enchanted Christmas, or Beauty and the Beast, Belle's Magical World.
820800	822800	I know that all the comments are going to be telling me what I said.
822800	827800	What are your feelings on the slew of 80s, 90s, 2000s nostalgia reboots in recent years?
827800	835800	I mean, it sucks because it's like kind of gone from it being a trend to it being like all there is, especially with Disney.
836800	843800	But at the same time, it's nothing new and at least it's... sometimes there's like a quality thing that comes of it, so I don't know.
843800	847800	What are some of your cancelled video projects, assuming you have some, and why haven't they seen the light of day?
847800	857800	Most of the ones that I started but gave up on would be dated, like, or there's already way too much of this hot take.
857800	866800	I think really early on I was going to do something about why girls love Twilight, not realizing that there were a million of those already by 2009.
866800	871800	There was another one about Fifty Shades of Grey and the male gaze and does the female gaze exist?
871800	875800	And I ceased that one because I was so sick of hearing about Fifty Shades of Grey.
875800	882800	I got a lot of comments for like, do something about gender in Game of Thrones, so I started that and then I hated it and killed it.
882800	888800	So it's mostly stuff that's just like not interesting enough to warrant existing, at least in my mind.
888800	890800	Will you hire me? No, sorry.
890800	895800	What do you think of Hank's book? Well, I think this thing is pretty cool that they did with it.
895800	900800	I don't know what it means because I haven't read it yet. I just got it in the mail like yesterday.
900800	908800	Who is sexier, Starscream or Daddy? Well, which Daddy? There are like eight of those now.
908800	910800	Starscream.
910800	913800	Starscream. Thickest animated daddy and why is it Radigan?
913800	918800	See, I wouldn't categorize Radigan as daddy. See, I know it's like once you have to explain the joke, it's not funny.
918800	925800	But this was obviously the daddy thing was something coined by ContraPoints in her video about Jordan Peterson.
925800	930800	Sometimes boys just need a daddy and sometimes girls do too.
930800	937800	Honestly, Elon Musk talking about the authorial intent of sci-fi authors on Twitter is just like, daddy.
937800	941800	So Jordan. Sorry, Dr. Peterson. Professor. Daddy.
941800	949800	So really it's a very specific thing for an unearned facade of arrogance and I think Radigan is deservedly arrogant.
949800	954800	When is a plot hole worth pointing out and when should it be ignored in favor of suspending disbelief?
954800	958800	Well, I think I hate the term plot hole now because the Internet's killed it.
958800	963800	But in general, to me, it's a question of is this bad writing? Is it lazy writing? Is it contrived?
963800	968800	Which is why I don't, I try not to use the word plot hole. To me, I'm just like, well, it's contrived.
968800	975800	They obviously needed to get to an end point and just kind of wrote in something late lazily to get us there.
975800	982800	Over the course of your career, career, what's been the biggest change in how you perceive frame and critique media?
982800	991800	When I first started, we didn't really have the meta text of how the Internet was going to populize the discourse.
991800	999800	And I know this sounds snobbish, but like back in the day, the people who had a platform to talk in a film critique way were people who, you know, like journalists, people who are educated.
999800	1004800	And now just anyone can do it. The problem with that is, of course, capitalism.
1004800	1013800	People fall into ruts and you have these clickbait channels like movie nitpicks dot com that just kind of do the same thing over and over.
1013800	1021800	And because they have to rush out content, they end up having these really shallow observations that huge audiences just kind of see and regurgitate.
1021800	1025800	And that's kind of where film literacy begins and ends with a lot of people.
1025800	1036800	And I think in some part I contributed to that, if in a very, very, very small way, by being a part of these like nitpicky channels that we shall not name here.
1036800	1045800	I think now it's more about like being careful about shaping trends, because I know I'm by no means anywhere near the biggest voice on film YouTube,
1045800	1050800	but being expected to say and do the same thing over and over leads to shallow bad film criticism.
1050800	1055800	You mentioned being a fan of ContraPoints before befriending her. How did you stumble upon her videos and which was the first you saw?
1055800	1063800	The first I saw, and she will tell you not to watch it, was her video about the golden one.
1064800	1070800	It was called What is an Alpha? Or something about being alphas, and I think I just recommendations filtered that one to me.
1070800	1078800	If they, god forbid, gave The Great Mouse Detective a live action remake- No! No. I'm gonna stop you right there. No. No. Mm-mm.
1078800	1084800	Will video essays ever reserve the same standard as printed essays? Um, probably not anytime soon.
1084800	1095800	Having spent some time in the hallowed halls of academia in the last couple years, most academics don't actually know what a video essay is.
1095800	1103800	I think we have to get to a stage where like your average film professor knows what a video essay is before we even start talking about how to get them peer reviewed.
1103800	1105800	How do you feel about Reylo?
1110800	1111800	It's fine.
1111800	1115800	How do you approach your research? Basically the way you research any essay.
1115800	1121800	Although for me it helps to have a knowledge base in the topic at hand just because then I'm more interested in it and more confident.
1121800	1123800	Outside of Phantom, which musicals do you like best?
1126800	1129800	How do you think would last longer in The Hunger Games? You or Shadow Todd?
1129800	1135800	And how long would that person last or would they win? He'd be the first to go because he'd be looking at his phone the whole time.
1135800	1141800	Why are you putting Elon Musk erotica in my feed? I don't know, Jason. Why are you reading it?
1141800	1143800	What's your favorite lipstick?
1143800	1145800	Well, Sarah, I'm actually wearing it.
1145800	1147800	Uh, it's called Man Eater by Smashbox.
1147800	1149800	Wheel of Fortune or Jeopardy?
1149800	1150800	Jeopardy.
1150800	1153800	Culture and media changes, how do you think we should view media from the past?
1153800	1160800	How do you think our society can reconcile past media, especially as it relates to marginalized groups, with our present selves? Do we analyze or do we ignore?
1160800	1167800	I honestly think that Disney had the best idea and the rightest idea whenever they did their release of wartime cartoons
1167800	1177800	because basically they released them as they are in their entirety, stuff like Der Führer's Face and Education for Death, propaganda films that Disney produced during the war,
1177800	1182800	and all of these had nice little introductions by Leonard Maltin contextualizing them.
1182800	1187800	And obviously they were very corporate and on brand, but I think that this is the right idea.
1187800	1198800	And I think that moralizing these things, like it's some racist guy who lives down the street in 2018, is just, uh, it's not very helpful.
1198800	1204800	Because obviously erasing your past is not going to help us learn anything or grow from it.
1204800	1206800	So even putting things in a context like that is important.
1206800	1210800	But honestly, I would just like to see more people compartmentalizing.
1210800	1219800	Because it's not the same thing as if you have something, someone like a celebrity, let's, I don't know, let's say someone like James Woods who says really evil things on the regular,
1219800	1226800	who is still alive and still has a platform and still has a position of power and uses his position of power to do awful things.
1226800	1231800	Or compare that to like a movie like Song of the South, which was made in the 1940s.
1231800	1240800	I really think Disney is wasting an opportunity not releasing that and, like, contextualizing it and talking about how, like, why it was the way it was, how cultures changed over the year,
1240800	1243800	why they thought that this was progressive, which they did.
1243800	1247800	Maybe donate a portion of profits to the NAACP or something.
1247800	1259800	I think there is too much shame around media history and I think contextualizing it is what's much more beneficial than saying, like, oh, it's evil and it needs to go away and be brushed under the rug forever.
1259800	1263800	How did the Transformers video come about? Like, what made the idea pop?
1263800	1271800	This was actually something Dan Olson and I developed as a concept, like, back in 2013, 2014.
1271800	1280800	We made a really, really long Google doc about Michaela and from there it just sprung like, well, this would be a great way to talk about feminist theory.
1280800	1284800	This would be a great way to talk about all sorts of film theory.
1284800	1289800	But Dan is kind of hard to get ahold of, so I just decided to do it myself.
1289800	1295800	If you could wave a magic wand and make one trope slash stock character slash plot device disappear forever, what would it be?
1295800	1308800	I think my least favorite trope of all time is, like, the one where, like, the while you were sleeping I'm lying about my identity trope because it always ends at the end of Act Two with, you know, the Fern Gully.
1308800	1312800	You lied to me! I hate that. I hate it.
1312800	1316800	What's a topic you're dying to make a video about but probably never will?
1316800	1317800	SpaceX.
1317800	1320800	Will we ever get a full tour of the Daddy Wall?
1320800	1325800	Well, I am nowhere near close to tired of that joke, so probably.
1325800	1329800	How did you originally imagine you'd use your degrees? Like, what area of film did you want to do?
1329800	1331800	Also, what's your favorite city that you've lived in?
1331800	1339800	New York, but the New York of a few years ago, like, the proliferation of Uber and the degradation of the trains have made the city basically fucking unlivable.
1339800	1346800	To the question of how I originally imagined using my degrees, I don't know. I mean, do people in college actually think that far ahead?
1346800	1355800	You're just like, look, I got it, I have a degree, so now I'm gonna work minimum wage until I die while I write a lot of fanfiction. I was not ambitious.
1355800	1358800	Favorite line slash song Howard Ashman ever wrote?
1358800	1362800	I'm especially good at expectorating.
1362800	1368800	What are the risks and advantages of being an individual figurehead for your videos when they are often, pretty much always, except for this one,
1368800	1374800	the production of a talented group of people? And are there particular benefits to that kind of setup on YouTube as a platform?
1374800	1377800	Yeah, and honestly, I don't know what to do with it.
1377800	1386800	A very small sect of people kind of understand, like, my editor, Angelina, like, her style and how it is distinct from my editing style,
1386800	1392800	so I definitely get comments that are like, ooh, that's a really good edit by Angelina, and like, yes, correct, that was her.
1392800	1396800	But most people still have this idea that it's all me, and it's not.
1396800	1405800	I will get credit for things like I didn't write or didn't do, but on the other hand, I get to take all the heat, so I don't know.
1405800	1413800	I think the people who work for me right now are more comfortable with me having the bigger profile because then they don't have to deal with all the bullshit I do.
1413800	1415800	What do you think about the Disney acquisition hunger?
1415800	1420800	I think it's bad. There's nothing good about it.
1420800	1424800	Is there anyone you would like to collab with who you haven't yet, and if so, who?
1424800	1433800	Again, like, I tend to restrict myself to people I've actually met just because I think it's kind of creepy to be like, oh, I'd love to collab with Poppy.
1433800	1438800	Maybe CGP Grey. I don't know what we would do.
1438800	1444800	I think also I'd like to just do more stuff with non-YouTubers, like, people who aren't strictly on this platform,
1445800	1451800	or maybe some of my former classmates at USC who are, like, actually in the industry.
1451800	1456800	Like, the video I did last year with David McCracken talking about filmmaking was fun, and I'd like to do more stuff like that.
1456800	1462800	Like, I think John Scalzi would be fun to do something, some video with. Like, he's a good sport, and he has, like, a good presence.
1462800	1463800	Okay, one more.
1463800	1468800	If James Gunn is not rehired for Guardians 3, would you support and promote a total boycott of the movie?
1468800	1473800	No. Like, here's the thing. Boycotts don't work. Like, there are actual studies on this.
1473800	1478800	Or rather, specifically, boycotts alone won't work. Like, let's look at the recent Amazon Prime Day.
1478800	1482800	People were promoting a boycott of Amazon, and it was their biggest day ever.
1482800	1489800	Like, the truth is most people don't care about disrupting their normal cycles, and if they're gonna see Guardians 3, they're gonna see Guardians 3, including me.
1489800	1494800	What does work is making a big stink and making it clear why you're making a big stink,
1494800	1500800	which is why I support the cast of Guardians of the Galaxy, and I think the whole James Gunn getting fired thing is bullshit,
1500800	1507800	but I think boycotting a movie that's not gonna come out for another three years, A, that's gonna make such a non-existent dent that no one will notice,
1507800	1513800	and B, kind of ignores the problem, which is not the movie itself. It's what's going on now.
1513800	1517800	So no, I wouldn't support that, but I will make a big stink in the meantime.
1517800	1522800	Thanks for sitting all the way through this, and thanks to everyone who stuck with me up to 400,000. We did it.
1522800	1525800	Oh, and I have one more announcement. If you're wondering,
1525800	1531800	Oh, wow, your Nostalgia Chick videos have mostly disappeared. Yeah, about that.
1531800	1542800	Basically, I want to consider this channel a new era, and anything that is affiliated with certain former affiliates, uh, I don't really want on this channel.
1542800	1547800	That said, I know if I just delete it, people are just gonna upload it and monetize my content, and, you know, we can't have that.
1547800	1553800	I started a new channel, and we're going to be uploading a new video every day, and I won't have the comments turned off.
1553800	1555800	Go wild. I don't care.
1555800	1561800	Of course, I'm not thrilled about this, because I'm basically hideously ashamed of pretty much everything I did before 2015.
1561800	1563800	But it's the internet. Nothing dies.
1563800	1567800	So go watch my horrible old content, and feel free to tell me how problematic I am.
1567800	1572800	You're not wrong. I wish I could end this on a more positive note. Enjoy!
