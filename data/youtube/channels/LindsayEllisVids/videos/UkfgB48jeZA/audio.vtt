WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.200
So I'm sitting in front of every book I own, so I can trick people into thinking that I read,

00:04.200 --> 00:12.100
and I guess as a thank you, slash in honor of, I'm not actually sure, am I congratulating myself or am I, like, thanking you, the viewer?

00:12.100 --> 00:15.700
Well anyway, it's a Q&A for reaching 400,000 subscribers.

00:15.700 --> 00:20.000
And no, the eyeliner isn't really on brand, but I just felt like it.

00:20.000 --> 00:20.700
Die mad.

00:20.700 --> 00:29.800
And thank you for smashing that like button, smashing that subscribe boy, it's your dick tarantula button.

00:29.800 --> 00:35.800
By the way, before we get started, if you didn't catch it, I actually have a new series on PBS Digital Studios' channel.

00:35.800 --> 00:37.800
It's called It's Lit.

00:37.800 --> 00:42.300
It's a YouTube video essay companion piece series to PBS's The Great American Read.

00:42.300 --> 00:48.300
Okay, so I asked people on Twitter.com to ask me questions for a 400k Q&A.

00:48.300 --> 00:52.800
I haven't done it before because I am really lazy and forgetful.

00:52.800 --> 00:58.300
But I'm doing it this time, and the way I'm actually remembering to do it is I'm actually reading these questions for the first time.

00:58.300 --> 01:00.300
I'm sure they're very nice and respectful.

01:04.800 --> 01:09.300
Honestly, I didn't really care about the Dark Universe until they announced before The Mummy came out

01:09.300 --> 01:13.300
that they were also going to do Phantom of the Opera and Hunchback of Notre Dame.

01:13.300 --> 01:22.800
And the idea of a grim dark Hunchback of Notre Dame in the style of, like, Zack Snyder was the most amazing thing in the world to me.

01:22.800 --> 01:28.800
And I just wanted it, like, burning, and I was honestly heartbroken that The Mummy tanked

01:28.800 --> 01:33.800
because I wanted Ansel Elgort as Quasimodo in grim dark Hunchback.

01:33.800 --> 01:38.300
And don't even get me started on the Dark Universe Phantom of the Opera.

01:38.300 --> 01:40.300
You know, it would have to be modern.

01:40.300 --> 01:45.800
He's probably going to be, like, Stuart Townsend in Queen of the Damned levels of camp.

01:45.800 --> 01:46.800
Uh...

01:46.800 --> 01:52.300
So I think my hypothetical Dark Universe is probably better than it would have actually ended up being.

01:52.300 --> 01:55.800
Or at least more interesting, but since it only lives in my mind, there you go.

02:09.800 --> 02:14.300
I have a really easy answer for that, and that is the first two X-Men movies,

02:14.300 --> 02:18.800
which are directed by Bryan Singer and are kind of a source of consternation

02:18.800 --> 02:24.300
because he was the one who really made the subtext of the coming out narrative basically text.

02:24.300 --> 02:26.300
But he's also a gross creep.

02:26.300 --> 02:29.800
But the thing is, this has been known for a really long time.

02:29.800 --> 02:35.300
Like, when I went back to finish my degree at USC, in the time since I dropped out and came back,

02:35.300 --> 02:41.300
they changed the Critical Studies department to the Bryan Singer Department of Critical Studies.

02:41.300 --> 02:47.800
They have since undone this, but the fact is that Bryan Singer has been a known creep for a really, really long time in Hollywood.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.300
What the fuck, USC?

02:53.800 --> 02:55.300
For that one, I have to go with The Jungle Book.

02:55.300 --> 02:59.800
I think that the new movie kind of actually explored, like, why fire is bad and dangerous

02:59.800 --> 03:04.300
and why Mowgli is kind of uniquely able to wield it and why Shere Khan actually has a point.

03:04.300 --> 03:11.800
So that one I thought kind of had a raison d'etre more than just, I don't know, progressivizing the original.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.300
I thought it actually did something interesting with it.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.300
No, not really.

03:20.300 --> 03:25.800
Because I think at the end of the day, like, your feelings are your feelings and I wish people would kind of own that.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.300
Feelings are not rational.

03:27.300 --> 03:31.300
You can rationalize them by having supporting evidence.

03:31.300 --> 03:35.800
But at the end of the day, like, if you have a criticism, it's probably because you had an emotional reaction.

03:35.800 --> 03:43.300
Finding words and supporting evidence and being able to articulate why you felt that emotional reaction is kind of the best you can do.

03:43.800 --> 03:47.800
And I think the worst people can do is have an emotional reaction and not really explore it

03:47.800 --> 03:52.300
and not really put words to it, not really articulate why they feel the way they feel.

03:52.300 --> 03:55.800
Either that or just delude themselves, which is also a really popular thing to do these days.

03:58.800 --> 04:01.300
I don't know. I think she'd honestly have a lot of fun.

04:01.300 --> 04:05.300
I think it would be really disquieting to be in The Purge with her because she'd be, like,

04:05.300 --> 04:07.800
going around to, like, all the rival games and being like,

04:07.800 --> 04:10.800
Ooh! The Purge!

04:13.800 --> 04:15.300
Someone asked me about this earlier today.

04:15.300 --> 04:19.300
Shrek would be one because I don't like Shrek, but it is beloved by a generation.

04:19.300 --> 04:24.800
So that would be kind of tantamount to, like, a Gen-Xer explaining to 90s kids why Aladdin sucks.

04:24.800 --> 04:29.300
The Prince of Egypt would be another because I really hate that movie for a lot of reasons.

04:29.300 --> 04:35.800
But then I would have to be, like, getting into my problems with organized religion being adapted for pop culture

04:35.800 --> 04:39.800
and everybody would lose. No one would win. I'm not touching that.

04:39.800 --> 04:45.300
See, I just released a video about Disney, so that's all anyone's asking me about.

04:45.300 --> 04:47.300
Which of the Autobots is the sexiest?

04:47.300 --> 04:51.300
Well, that depends on what you're into. If you're into a bottom, there's Beachcomber.

04:51.300 --> 04:55.800
If you're into the arrogant prick type, there's Rodimus, but then I guess I'm going into the comics for that.

04:55.800 --> 04:59.300
A lot of people like Drift because he's, like, spiritual but athletic.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.800
Personally, I still gotta go with Wheeljack.

05:01.800 --> 05:05.300
Sorry, Starscream. You're not an Autobot.

05:05.300 --> 05:08.800
This is my masterpiece, Wheeljack. He's actually my favorite.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.800
He used to be transformed. He's getting dusty.

05:10.800 --> 05:13.300
What was the hardest video to put together and why?

05:13.300 --> 05:15.800
You know, at any given time, it's always the one I just released.

05:15.800 --> 05:21.300
Recently would have to be the Marxism episode of the whole plate.

05:21.300 --> 05:26.300
But the thing about, like, Marxism and film theory is that Marxism influences a lot of academics,

05:26.300 --> 05:30.800
but there are not that many film theorists that are like, I'm the Marxist one.

05:30.800 --> 05:34.300
So it was actually really hard.

05:34.300 --> 05:38.800
And that's why we ended up just going, yeah, just go with Adorno because it was just, it was so much.

05:38.800 --> 05:42.800
Like, just applying the Frankfurt School alone was just so much,

05:42.800 --> 05:45.800
but then you get into, like, the 60s and the 70s and then the feminists show up.

05:45.800 --> 05:51.800
It's just a really, really, really convoluted topic and I wasn't really prepared for how convoluted it was.

05:51.800 --> 05:57.800
In my education, they didn't really teach Marxism as, like, this week we're learning about Marxism,

05:57.800 --> 06:01.800
the way they did for, like, feminism and critical race theory, auteur theory.

06:01.800 --> 06:09.300
Those were a lot easier to distill in a simple way because I had been taught them in my intro class back in 2003.

06:09.300 --> 06:14.300
So, like, having to distill that into an intro class type video was really, really hard.

06:14.300 --> 06:19.300
And I don't, I don't think I succeeded as well as I would have liked to, but eh.

06:19.300 --> 06:22.800
As a YouTuber, do you follow other channels as a viewer slash fan?

06:22.800 --> 06:25.800
Are there any that are your favorite or you'd recommend to us?

06:25.800 --> 06:31.800
Well, actually, I probably right now watch YouTube more than anything except for RuPaul's Drag Race.

06:31.800 --> 06:36.800
But on that note, like, there are obviously a lot of people that do similar videos to what I do,

06:36.800 --> 06:40.800
like Movies with Mikey, of course, ContraPoints.

06:40.800 --> 06:46.300
I binge her videos all the time still and that's why I steal her jokes so often, sometimes with permission.

06:46.300 --> 06:50.800
Folding Ideas, obviously, Patrick Williams, CGP Grey.

06:50.800 --> 06:54.800
My honest, true go-to is CakeTube.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.800
Like, cake decorating YouTube.

06:57.800 --> 07:04.300
Like, the two, the two I kind of obsess with the most are How to Cake It and Man About Cake.

07:04.300 --> 07:09.300
And, of course, everything that has ever spun off from RuPaul's Drag Race.

07:09.300 --> 07:17.800
The thing I keep watching over and over again lately is Ugh, starring Trixie Mattel and Katja.

07:17.800 --> 07:23.300
It ended, like, well over a year ago, but I only just discovered it, so it's new to me.

07:23.300 --> 07:24.800
Oh, and Jenny Nicholson, too, I guess.

07:24.800 --> 07:25.800
Here's an easy one.

07:25.800 --> 07:29.800
Is it truly possible for sexual violence to be depicted well on film?

07:31.300 --> 07:34.300
That's the easy questions for a YouTube Q&A.

07:34.300 --> 07:37.300
Well, here's the thing, Chris.

07:37.300 --> 07:40.800
Um, a lot of this is gonna be, at the end of the day, subjective.

07:40.800 --> 07:46.800
And I think the problem with a lot of film criticism is that people kind of expect there to be, like, a moral barometer.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.800
When, at the end of the day, it's like, there are things like context.

07:48.800 --> 07:53.800
Who is writing the thing? What is it on HBO?

07:53.800 --> 07:58.800
Personally, I think, in isolation, there can be arguments to be made,

07:58.800 --> 08:05.800
but overall, the broader trend is, tends to dramatize pain in a way that I think is cliched.

08:05.800 --> 08:11.800
So, I think it's really hard to separate isolated depictions of sexual violence with, like, the broader trend.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.800
And the other thing is, like, that's changing constantly.

08:13.800 --> 08:16.800
So, what's, like, maybe this year, be like, hmm, that was tasteful.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.800
Ten years from now will be, like, unacceptable.

08:18.800 --> 08:22.800
So, that's honestly, basically, kind of an impossible question to answer.

08:22.800 --> 08:30.800
Personally, I think it's overdone and not done well enough often to really justify it as a common enough dramatic device,

08:30.800 --> 08:35.800
as it is, especially in the golden age of television, which we are apparently living through.

08:35.800 --> 08:37.800
Have you copyrighted Thanks I Hate It yet?

08:37.800 --> 08:41.800
No! That's, like, a phrase.

08:41.800 --> 08:45.800
There's even a really big Facebook group called Thanks I Hate It.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.800
Which Starscream is best? Ooh.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.800
Well, we've already been through this.

08:49.800 --> 08:54.800
While I am, of course, always deeply partial to the original Chris Latta,

08:54.800 --> 09:00.800
I think my personal favorite Starscream is Transformers Prime, Alliance continuity.

09:00.800 --> 09:04.800
And, oh, what's his name? Oh, God. I've met him.

09:04.800 --> 09:09.800
I can't remember his name. The guy who, okay, Transformers Prime Starscream.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.800
His name escapes me. I think it's Steve.

09:12.800 --> 09:16.800
Are there any essays you'd like to redo slash update? All of them?

09:16.800 --> 09:18.800
When people come up to me and say, like,

09:18.800 --> 09:22.800
Oh, my God, you said this thing, like, about half the time I have no idea what they're talking about,

09:22.800 --> 09:26.800
because the second I'm done with a thing, I very rarely, rarely watch it again.

09:26.800 --> 09:30.800
Every time I watch something, I'm like, Oh, God, I should have done this. I should have praised this better.

09:30.800 --> 09:34.800
Oh, I'm repeating words. I hate this edit. There's a dropped frame. There's a dropped clip.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.800
My makeup's terrible. Oh, my God, that lighting. I look like a glowworm.

09:37.800 --> 09:42.800
Really, basically anything I did before I departed the channel that shall not be named.

09:42.800 --> 09:45.800
Except for the Freddie Got Fingered review. That one I'm still pretty proud of.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.800
It's my legacy.

09:47.800 --> 09:51.800
If you can go back to your 18-year-old you, what would your advice be?

09:51.800 --> 09:53.800
Don't ever mix Xanax and alcohol.

09:53.800 --> 09:57.800
I noticed you seem to go to Disney parks a lot. Super cool. What's your favorite attraction and why?

09:57.800 --> 10:02.800
Honestly, it's the goddamn Guardians of the Galaxy, Mission Breakout, Fight Me.

10:02.800 --> 10:07.800
But now I might not be because it's always going to make me sad because of this dumb James Gunn thing.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.800
Hashtag Rehire James Gunn.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.800
What are all those books behind you?

10:11.800 --> 10:14.800
I went after Disney War after you cited it in an earlier video and loved it.

10:14.800 --> 10:17.800
So if you have other book recommendations, it would really make me happy.

10:17.800 --> 10:22.800
Since I shot this not that long ago, I haven't moved the books since I shot the Beauty and the Beast video.

10:22.800 --> 10:26.800
This is, of course, Disney War. As you can see, it's really, really long.

10:27.800 --> 10:32.800
It is the truth that with Audible I actually did listen to this one on Audible

10:32.800 --> 10:35.800
because I have a really hard time with nonfiction that's this long.

10:35.800 --> 10:38.800
So it's better if I just listen to it over the course of like three months.

10:38.800 --> 10:42.800
An Absolutely Remarkable Things by Hank Green.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.800
It's out September 5th.

10:44.800 --> 10:48.800
And I just got this in the mail like two days ago, so I haven't read it yet. Sorry, Hank.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.800
It's funny that I'm shilling for Audible.

10:50.800 --> 10:54.800
This is not a sponsored video, but this was another Audible.

10:54.800 --> 10:59.800
One of my favorite nonfiction books of all time, The Power Broker by Robert A. Caro.

10:59.800 --> 11:01.800
Robert Moses and the Rise and Fall of New York.

11:01.800 --> 11:07.800
I have the hard copy because I need it because the hard copy has like all these cool maps and stuff in it.

11:07.800 --> 11:12.800
If I really like a book on Audible, I'll buy the hard copy just so I can have it for research purposes.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.800
And that's why I have a hard copy of Disney War.

11:14.800 --> 11:18.800
Here was a formative book. Deconstructing Disney.

11:18.800 --> 11:23.800
This one's actually from college. I mean, it's basic, but there's some of it that's also dumb as hell.

11:23.800 --> 11:28.800
There's like an entire chapter about how Hercules is a parable of the Clinton administration.

11:28.800 --> 11:33.800
Hercules, as an inscription of Clinton, is the victim of a massive right-wing conspiracy.

11:33.800 --> 11:37.800
Hades, god of the underworld, is planning a hostile takeover bid, and is told by the Fates that,

11:37.800 --> 11:39.800
should Hercules fight, you will fail.

11:39.800 --> 11:43.800
The conspiracy narrative favored by the more distraught Democrats during Clinton's impeachment process

11:43.800 --> 11:48.800
was that Kenneth Starr's politically motivated prosecution was also underpinned by the tobacco industry.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.800
See, Hades smokes a cigar.

11:50.800 --> 11:57.800
See, this book was honestly where I realized that academics could be utterly full of shit.

11:57.800 --> 12:01.800
This is my favorite book by Octavia Butler, Parable of the Sower.

12:01.800 --> 12:05.800
Here of course is Awoken by Sarah Ellenson, the most important book ever written.

12:05.800 --> 12:10.800
The Girl with All the Gifts. I didn't actually see the movie, but I really loved this book.

12:10.800 --> 12:13.800
Stephen King's On Writing, also very good.

12:13.800 --> 12:18.800
I'm just going by what's convenient over here. I have other books on other bookshelves, but that would mean I'd have to get up.

12:18.800 --> 12:24.800
Is there a movie that genuinely surprised you, be it an expectations twist or what you believe it would be before you actually watched it?

12:24.800 --> 12:29.800
The first movie that genuinely surprised me was Barry Sonnenfeld's Men in Black, 1997.

12:29.800 --> 12:34.800
I thought it was gonna suck, but it changed my life because I loved it so much.

12:34.800 --> 12:39.800
But another recent one would be Mad Max Fury Road, but I think that one just surprised everybody.

12:39.800 --> 12:43.800
Where does your sharp fascination with exploring Disney come from?

12:43.800 --> 12:49.800
Honestly, it probably comes from the fact that the very first film studies class I ever took was about Disney,

12:49.800 --> 12:56.800
and therefore it's just kind of hardwired into my brain that Disney equals a thing to be constructed,

12:56.800 --> 12:59.800
which is funny because I was just throwing shade at deconstructing Disney over here.

12:59.800 --> 13:07.800
But also honestly just because Disney was really important to me growing up, and the older I get, the more still emotionally involved I am.

13:07.800 --> 13:12.800
And also, living in California now, I just spend a lot of goddamn time at the parks,

13:12.800 --> 13:16.800
and going to Disney World is like the thing I look forward to every year.

13:16.800 --> 13:19.800
Why do all of your Elon Musk memes make me feel cursed?

13:19.800 --> 13:23.800
Probably because they are, Jessie.

13:23.800 --> 13:26.800
The worst Disney sequel in your opinion?

13:26.800 --> 13:32.800
Well, I've actually done a video on that, but since I don't watch my old stuff I can't remember what I said.

13:32.800 --> 13:40.800
I'm pretty sure it was either Beauty and the Beast, Belle's Enchanted Christmas, or Beauty and the Beast, Belle's Magical World.

13:40.800 --> 13:42.800
I know that all the comments are going to be telling me what I said.

13:42.800 --> 13:47.800
What are your feelings on the slew of 80s, 90s, 2000s nostalgia reboots in recent years?

13:47.800 --> 13:55.800
I mean, it sucks because it's like kind of gone from it being a trend to it being like all there is, especially with Disney.

13:56.800 --> 14:03.800
But at the same time, it's nothing new and at least it's... sometimes there's like a quality thing that comes of it, so I don't know.

14:03.800 --> 14:07.800
What are some of your cancelled video projects, assuming you have some, and why haven't they seen the light of day?

14:07.800 --> 14:17.800
Most of the ones that I started but gave up on would be dated, like, or there's already way too much of this hot take.

14:17.800 --> 14:26.800
I think really early on I was going to do something about why girls love Twilight, not realizing that there were a million of those already by 2009.

14:26.800 --> 14:31.800
There was another one about Fifty Shades of Grey and the male gaze and does the female gaze exist?

14:31.800 --> 14:35.800
And I ceased that one because I was so sick of hearing about Fifty Shades of Grey.

14:35.800 --> 14:42.800
I got a lot of comments for like, do something about gender in Game of Thrones, so I started that and then I hated it and killed it.

14:42.800 --> 14:48.800
So it's mostly stuff that's just like not interesting enough to warrant existing, at least in my mind.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.800
Will you hire me? No, sorry.

14:50.800 --> 14:55.800
What do you think of Hank's book? Well, I think this thing is pretty cool that they did with it.

14:55.800 --> 15:00.800
I don't know what it means because I haven't read it yet. I just got it in the mail like yesterday.

15:00.800 --> 15:08.800
Who is sexier, Starscream or Daddy? Well, which Daddy? There are like eight of those now.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.800
Starscream.

15:10.800 --> 15:13.800
Starscream. Thickest animated daddy and why is it Radigan?

15:13.800 --> 15:18.800
See, I wouldn't categorize Radigan as daddy. See, I know it's like once you have to explain the joke, it's not funny.

15:18.800 --> 15:25.800
But this was obviously the daddy thing was something coined by ContraPoints in her video about Jordan Peterson.

15:25.800 --> 15:30.800
Sometimes boys just need a daddy and sometimes girls do too.

15:30.800 --> 15:37.800
Honestly, Elon Musk talking about the authorial intent of sci-fi authors on Twitter is just like, daddy.

15:37.800 --> 15:41.800
So Jordan. Sorry, Dr. Peterson. Professor. Daddy.

15:41.800 --> 15:49.800
So really it's a very specific thing for an unearned facade of arrogance and I think Radigan is deservedly arrogant.

15:49.800 --> 15:54.800
When is a plot hole worth pointing out and when should it be ignored in favor of suspending disbelief?

15:54.800 --> 15:58.800
Well, I think I hate the term plot hole now because the Internet's killed it.

15:58.800 --> 16:03.800
But in general, to me, it's a question of is this bad writing? Is it lazy writing? Is it contrived?

16:03.800 --> 16:08.800
Which is why I don't, I try not to use the word plot hole. To me, I'm just like, well, it's contrived.

16:08.800 --> 16:15.800
They obviously needed to get to an end point and just kind of wrote in something late lazily to get us there.

16:15.800 --> 16:22.800
Over the course of your career, career, what's been the biggest change in how you perceive frame and critique media?

16:22.800 --> 16:31.800
When I first started, we didn't really have the meta text of how the Internet was going to populize the discourse.

16:31.800 --> 16:39.800
And I know this sounds snobbish, but like back in the day, the people who had a platform to talk in a film critique way were people who, you know, like journalists, people who are educated.

16:39.800 --> 16:44.800
And now just anyone can do it. The problem with that is, of course, capitalism.

16:44.800 --> 16:53.800
People fall into ruts and you have these clickbait channels like movie nitpicks dot com that just kind of do the same thing over and over.

16:53.800 --> 17:01.800
And because they have to rush out content, they end up having these really shallow observations that huge audiences just kind of see and regurgitate.

17:01.800 --> 17:05.800
And that's kind of where film literacy begins and ends with a lot of people.

17:05.800 --> 17:16.800
And I think in some part I contributed to that, if in a very, very, very small way, by being a part of these like nitpicky channels that we shall not name here.

17:16.800 --> 17:25.800
I think now it's more about like being careful about shaping trends, because I know I'm by no means anywhere near the biggest voice on film YouTube,

17:25.800 --> 17:30.800
but being expected to say and do the same thing over and over leads to shallow bad film criticism.

17:30.800 --> 17:35.800
You mentioned being a fan of ContraPoints before befriending her. How did you stumble upon her videos and which was the first you saw?

17:35.800 --> 17:43.800
The first I saw, and she will tell you not to watch it, was her video about the golden one.

17:44.800 --> 17:50.800
It was called What is an Alpha? Or something about being alphas, and I think I just recommendations filtered that one to me.

17:50.800 --> 17:58.800
If they, god forbid, gave The Great Mouse Detective a live action remake- No! No. I'm gonna stop you right there. No. No. Mm-mm.

17:58.800 --> 18:04.800
Will video essays ever reserve the same standard as printed essays? Um, probably not anytime soon.

18:04.800 --> 18:15.800
Having spent some time in the hallowed halls of academia in the last couple years, most academics don't actually know what a video essay is.

18:15.800 --> 18:23.800
I think we have to get to a stage where like your average film professor knows what a video essay is before we even start talking about how to get them peer reviewed.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.800
How do you feel about Reylo?

18:30.800 --> 18:31.800
It's fine.

18:31.800 --> 18:35.800
How do you approach your research? Basically the way you research any essay.

18:35.800 --> 18:41.800
Although for me it helps to have a knowledge base in the topic at hand just because then I'm more interested in it and more confident.

18:41.800 --> 18:43.800
Outside of Phantom, which musicals do you like best?

18:46.800 --> 18:49.800
How do you think would last longer in The Hunger Games? You or Shadow Todd?

18:49.800 --> 18:55.800
And how long would that person last or would they win? He'd be the first to go because he'd be looking at his phone the whole time.

18:55.800 --> 19:01.800
Why are you putting Elon Musk erotica in my feed? I don't know, Jason. Why are you reading it?

19:01.800 --> 19:03.800
What's your favorite lipstick?

19:03.800 --> 19:05.800
Well, Sarah, I'm actually wearing it.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.800
Uh, it's called Man Eater by Smashbox.

19:07.800 --> 19:09.800
Wheel of Fortune or Jeopardy?

19:09.800 --> 19:10.800
Jeopardy.

19:10.800 --> 19:13.800
Culture and media changes, how do you think we should view media from the past?

19:13.800 --> 19:20.800
How do you think our society can reconcile past media, especially as it relates to marginalized groups, with our present selves? Do we analyze or do we ignore?

19:20.800 --> 19:27.800
I honestly think that Disney had the best idea and the rightest idea whenever they did their release of wartime cartoons

19:27.800 --> 19:37.800
because basically they released them as they are in their entirety, stuff like Der Führer's Face and Education for Death, propaganda films that Disney produced during the war,

19:37.800 --> 19:42.800
and all of these had nice little introductions by Leonard Maltin contextualizing them.

19:42.800 --> 19:47.800
And obviously they were very corporate and on brand, but I think that this is the right idea.

19:47.800 --> 19:58.800
And I think that moralizing these things, like it's some racist guy who lives down the street in 2018, is just, uh, it's not very helpful.

19:58.800 --> 20:04.800
Because obviously erasing your past is not going to help us learn anything or grow from it.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.800
So even putting things in a context like that is important.

20:06.800 --> 20:10.800
But honestly, I would just like to see more people compartmentalizing.

20:10.800 --> 20:19.800
Because it's not the same thing as if you have something, someone like a celebrity, let's, I don't know, let's say someone like James Woods who says really evil things on the regular,

20:19.800 --> 20:26.800
who is still alive and still has a platform and still has a position of power and uses his position of power to do awful things.

20:26.800 --> 20:31.800
Or compare that to like a movie like Song of the South, which was made in the 1940s.

20:31.800 --> 20:40.800
I really think Disney is wasting an opportunity not releasing that and, like, contextualizing it and talking about how, like, why it was the way it was, how cultures changed over the year,

20:40.800 --> 20:43.800
why they thought that this was progressive, which they did.

20:43.800 --> 20:47.800
Maybe donate a portion of profits to the NAACP or something.

20:47.800 --> 20:59.800
I think there is too much shame around media history and I think contextualizing it is what's much more beneficial than saying, like, oh, it's evil and it needs to go away and be brushed under the rug forever.

20:59.800 --> 21:03.800
How did the Transformers video come about? Like, what made the idea pop?

21:03.800 --> 21:11.800
This was actually something Dan Olson and I developed as a concept, like, back in 2013, 2014.

21:11.800 --> 21:20.800
We made a really, really long Google doc about Michaela and from there it just sprung like, well, this would be a great way to talk about feminist theory.

21:20.800 --> 21:24.800
This would be a great way to talk about all sorts of film theory.

21:24.800 --> 21:29.800
But Dan is kind of hard to get ahold of, so I just decided to do it myself.

21:29.800 --> 21:35.800
If you could wave a magic wand and make one trope slash stock character slash plot device disappear forever, what would it be?

21:35.800 --> 21:48.800
I think my least favorite trope of all time is, like, the one where, like, the while you were sleeping I'm lying about my identity trope because it always ends at the end of Act Two with, you know, the Fern Gully.

21:48.800 --> 21:52.800
You lied to me! I hate that. I hate it.

21:52.800 --> 21:56.800
What's a topic you're dying to make a video about but probably never will?

21:56.800 --> 21:57.800
SpaceX.

21:57.800 --> 22:00.800
Will we ever get a full tour of the Daddy Wall?

22:00.800 --> 22:05.800
Well, I am nowhere near close to tired of that joke, so probably.

22:05.800 --> 22:09.800
How did you originally imagine you'd use your degrees? Like, what area of film did you want to do?

22:09.800 --> 22:11.800
Also, what's your favorite city that you've lived in?

22:11.800 --> 22:19.800
New York, but the New York of a few years ago, like, the proliferation of Uber and the degradation of the trains have made the city basically fucking unlivable.

22:19.800 --> 22:26.800
To the question of how I originally imagined using my degrees, I don't know. I mean, do people in college actually think that far ahead?

22:26.800 --> 22:35.800
You're just like, look, I got it, I have a degree, so now I'm gonna work minimum wage until I die while I write a lot of fanfiction. I was not ambitious.

22:35.800 --> 22:38.800
Favorite line slash song Howard Ashman ever wrote?

22:38.800 --> 22:42.800
I'm especially good at expectorating.

22:42.800 --> 22:48.800
What are the risks and advantages of being an individual figurehead for your videos when they are often, pretty much always, except for this one,

22:48.800 --> 22:54.800
the production of a talented group of people? And are there particular benefits to that kind of setup on YouTube as a platform?

22:54.800 --> 22:57.800
Yeah, and honestly, I don't know what to do with it.

22:57.800 --> 23:06.800
A very small sect of people kind of understand, like, my editor, Angelina, like, her style and how it is distinct from my editing style,

23:06.800 --> 23:12.800
so I definitely get comments that are like, ooh, that's a really good edit by Angelina, and like, yes, correct, that was her.

23:12.800 --> 23:16.800
But most people still have this idea that it's all me, and it's not.

23:16.800 --> 23:25.800
I will get credit for things like I didn't write or didn't do, but on the other hand, I get to take all the heat, so I don't know.

23:25.800 --> 23:33.800
I think the people who work for me right now are more comfortable with me having the bigger profile because then they don't have to deal with all the bullshit I do.

23:33.800 --> 23:35.800
What do you think about the Disney acquisition hunger?

23:35.800 --> 23:40.800
I think it's bad. There's nothing good about it.

23:40.800 --> 23:44.800
Is there anyone you would like to collab with who you haven't yet, and if so, who?

23:44.800 --> 23:53.800
Again, like, I tend to restrict myself to people I've actually met just because I think it's kind of creepy to be like, oh, I'd love to collab with Poppy.

23:53.800 --> 23:58.800
Maybe CGP Grey. I don't know what we would do.

23:58.800 --> 24:04.800
I think also I'd like to just do more stuff with non-YouTubers, like, people who aren't strictly on this platform,

24:05.800 --> 24:11.800
or maybe some of my former classmates at USC who are, like, actually in the industry.

24:11.800 --> 24:16.800
Like, the video I did last year with David McCracken talking about filmmaking was fun, and I'd like to do more stuff like that.

24:16.800 --> 24:22.800
Like, I think John Scalzi would be fun to do something, some video with. Like, he's a good sport, and he has, like, a good presence.

24:22.800 --> 24:23.800
Okay, one more.

24:23.800 --> 24:28.800
If James Gunn is not rehired for Guardians 3, would you support and promote a total boycott of the movie?

24:28.800 --> 24:33.800
No. Like, here's the thing. Boycotts don't work. Like, there are actual studies on this.

24:33.800 --> 24:38.800
Or rather, specifically, boycotts alone won't work. Like, let's look at the recent Amazon Prime Day.

24:38.800 --> 24:42.800
People were promoting a boycott of Amazon, and it was their biggest day ever.

24:42.800 --> 24:49.800
Like, the truth is most people don't care about disrupting their normal cycles, and if they're gonna see Guardians 3, they're gonna see Guardians 3, including me.

24:49.800 --> 24:54.800
What does work is making a big stink and making it clear why you're making a big stink,

24:54.800 --> 25:00.800
which is why I support the cast of Guardians of the Galaxy, and I think the whole James Gunn getting fired thing is bullshit,

25:00.800 --> 25:07.800
but I think boycotting a movie that's not gonna come out for another three years, A, that's gonna make such a non-existent dent that no one will notice,

25:07.800 --> 25:13.800
and B, kind of ignores the problem, which is not the movie itself. It's what's going on now.

25:13.800 --> 25:17.800
So no, I wouldn't support that, but I will make a big stink in the meantime.

25:17.800 --> 25:22.800
Thanks for sitting all the way through this, and thanks to everyone who stuck with me up to 400,000. We did it.

25:22.800 --> 25:25.800
Oh, and I have one more announcement. If you're wondering,

25:25.800 --> 25:31.800
Oh, wow, your Nostalgia Chick videos have mostly disappeared. Yeah, about that.

25:31.800 --> 25:42.800
Basically, I want to consider this channel a new era, and anything that is affiliated with certain former affiliates, uh, I don't really want on this channel.

25:42.800 --> 25:47.800
That said, I know if I just delete it, people are just gonna upload it and monetize my content, and, you know, we can't have that.

25:47.800 --> 25:53.800
I started a new channel, and we're going to be uploading a new video every day, and I won't have the comments turned off.

25:53.800 --> 25:55.800
Go wild. I don't care.

25:55.800 --> 26:01.800
Of course, I'm not thrilled about this, because I'm basically hideously ashamed of pretty much everything I did before 2015.

26:01.800 --> 26:03.800
But it's the internet. Nothing dies.

26:03.800 --> 26:07.800
So go watch my horrible old content, and feel free to tell me how problematic I am.

26:07.800 --> 26:12.800
You're not wrong. I wish I could end this on a more positive note. Enjoy!
