1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,280
So we got a full house today, we had to make room for you and everything.

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,280
I'm blocking the cool side.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,280
I feel so bad.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,280
I had to give up my comfy chair.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,160
You had to give up the comfy chairs for you.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,160
Sorry.

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:25,480
The three of us have been, for the last couple weeks, living in the mind of a person that

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,480
doesn't exist.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,480
Yes, but we've named her.

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,960
Her name is Sarah Ellison, thanks to a random Facebook person who came up with that.

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,960
We thought it was funny.

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,960
Yeah.

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,180
They said Sarah Ellison, we added the N. Yeah, so slightly modified, but we decided that

14
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,160
she was a Midwestern housewife and mom who had never left her hometown of possibly Dayton,

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,160
Ohio.

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,040
We made up a Christian denomination for her.

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,480
She has a religion.

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,480
She's a Reform Anabaptist.

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,480
No, and a Protestant.

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,480
Yeah, she's a Reform Anaprotestant.

21
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,480
Huh.

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,480
No, I wasn't there for this comic.

23
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,480
No, I wasn't.

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,480
This is new information for me.

25
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,480
Too busy writing.

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:10,600
I think the most interesting thing about writing from this author's point of view is what does

27
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,400
she think is romantic?

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,400
Yeah.

29
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,920
And writing these awful characters being awful people to each other.

30
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:24,800
The romantic leads are Lego brick and are sexy Cthulhu, so he's domineering and overprotective

31
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,520
and to her that's sexy because that means he loves her and she is wildly insecure and

32
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,480
embarrassed of everything she does.

33
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,040
It's been painfully awkward writing.

34
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,040
Yeah.

35
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,760
Just to have her be feeling these awful feelings like fear and pain and insecurity and shame.

36
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,760
Embarrassment.

37
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,760
Shame.

38
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,760
Shame's boring.

39
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,000
And romanticize and finding it to be sexy.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,760
Just like Fifty Shades.

41
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,760
Not bad, but just awkward is like your, it's the Lovecraft element.

42
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:59,760
It's like I'd be writing like, I am the great one and that is why I cannot go out with you.

43
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,760
That's my favorite line in the whole thing so far.

44
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,760
I cannot be your boyfriend.

45
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,960
I've just been wondering how many more times I can have Lego brick think, oh god, we're

46
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,440
just ants to you, aren't we?

47
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,440
I'm not worthy.

48
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,440
Oh god.

49
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,400
Are you even paying any attention to me?

50
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,000
We are just ants to you.

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,240
I think at the end of the day, it's still a better book than most YA, kind of unintentionally

52
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240
so.

53
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,800
It's turned out really good and our ghostwriters are five children.

54
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,440
Yeah, Sarah Ellenson's five children.

55
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,440
Yes, Sarah Ellenson has five children.

56
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,440
Allison Ellenson.

57
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,720
Allison Ellenson, Marianne Ellenson, Matt A and Matt B. Why does she have two children

58
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,720
named Matt?

59
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,720
Who knows?

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's an Anaprotestant thing.

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Josh Ellenson.

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes, these are Sarah Ellenson's five children.

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's an Anaprotestant tradition to have two children named the same name.

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Matt A and Matt B.

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So let's talk a little bit about the process of writing a YA romance novel with eight people.

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Eight people.

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,800
First we divided it up amongst ourselves and we gave each of our ghostwriters two or three

68
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,680
smaller sections to write and then sort of split the rest amongst ourselves and we had

69
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,680
our outline in Google Docs, color coded it.

70
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,560
Oh yeah, which kind of turned out to be a mistake because it's really hard to track

71
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,560
changes.

72
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,080
It was a rainbow cornucopia.

73
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,680
So basically the way we did it in a sort of efficient manner was with technology, with

74
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:34,840
the wonder and the glory that is Google, basically we had one master document which was where

75
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,320
the outline is and where everyone could share ideas and keep everything straight, what is

76
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,560
the class schedule for Lego Brick and all her friends, who are the teachers, what does

77
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,960
her house look like, what are the settings for happening, character outlines.

78
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,080
And then everybody had their each individual doc which only they could edit but everyone

79
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,640
else could read and leave comments on.

80
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,200
So we wrote the first draft of a book in two weeks, we were not done by any means.

81
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,720
It's pretty solid though and some really good stuff.

82
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,800
Still a better love story than Twilight, as the cliche goes.

83
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:11,240
So in regards to writing this, I gotta say, writing this romance between Lego Brick and

84
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,880
Sexy Cthulhu was painful in a way.

85
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,320
Sometimes the ridiculousness of it would sort of keep it going because it was like, this

86
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,480
is so ridiculous, I have to keep writing it, and then other times it was just so painful

87
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,080
because it's such a painfully bad relationship.

88
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,840
It's embarrassing to be part of, I mean I was writing like this for half the time that

89
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,840
I wrote.

90
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,160
I think one thing that was really fun about actually outlining it was when we were talking

91
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,080
about how our author was writing about all these locations she'd never been to, like

92
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,040
our location of Portsmouth, Rhode Island, and we have a little-

93
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,040
Which is where it takes place.

94
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,360
Yeah, like we have a little plot cul-de-sac where they go to New York City.

95
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,520
We decided our author would get all her information about New York City from Home Alone 2.

96
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,520
Yeah, it's all like, her entire perception of New York City is from Home Alone 2.

97
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,400
And so there's- She gets everything wrong.

98
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,840
There's prostitutes everywhere, the plaza is still a hotel.

99
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,160
They can walk everywhere even if it's like 13 miles apart.

100
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,960
They take a carriage ride, like the World Trade Center's still there.

101
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,720
We didn't go that far, but- Portsmouth, Rhode Island, where our story

102
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
takes place.

103
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
None of us have ever been there.

104
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,920
We purposefully did not do any research because we wanted to get it wrong.

105
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,920
So we're just making up stuff that's there, and then there's this beach over here.

106
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,880
That really hurt me to do, like to not be- They have a bonfire on the beach, which I

107
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,240
I know, like I've never been there, and I know that's like a no bueno.

108
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,240
Yeah, yeah.

109
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,440
It hurts my soul thinking about how much I have not looked up with Portsmouth.

110
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,440
I thought it was fun.

111
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,280
I was like, this is great, all the not research I get.

112
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
This is lazy writing.

113
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,680
The other funnest part was going through it and having him do awful things to her.

114
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,400
Like be controlling, or mean, or yell at her, or scare her, and have her be like, he's so

115
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
sexy.

116
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Yeah.

117
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
And he yells at me like that.

118
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
It means he cares.

119
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,960
Yeah, because he just wants to protect me.

120
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,200
One of the things I was noticing myself trying to figure out how to do is, what I've noticed

121
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,120
in these books is the info dumps, where the author has actually done research.

122
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,760
It's like, here's a list of all my research.

123
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,920
Or here's a list of things I know about, that the characters are just going to be discussing

124
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:21,560
for no other reason besides, I need to up my word count, or something, or I want them

125
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,760
to appear intelligent in some manner.

126
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,640
Oh yes, like her favorite book.

127
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,640
Yeah.

128
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,840
Of course we made the favorite book, Phantom, because he's a monster, and I really like

129
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,240
it because there's always this classic literature thing.

130
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,840
On the road trip, he makes her sing Angel, and he thinks it's beautiful.

131
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,840
And we made it so this woman's never actually read the book, she's just seen the musical.

132
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:50,440
So she keeps quoting the book, and she's just quoting the musical, as if it's so deep and

133
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,840
so romantic.

134
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,840
One girl, I forget her name, she suggested The Great Gatsby, and we were originally going

135
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,840
to go with that, especially in light of this new movie coming out.

136
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,800
But we decided to go with Phantom because, well A, it's got the, he's a monster but I

137
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:13,720
love him thing, and we can play with the musical, but also because it's really not great literature.

138
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,440
The book is not that good, it was like a pulp novel when it was written that's kind of so

139
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,440
old now that people think it's a classic.

140
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,440
Yeah, well it's a classic because it's old, and it's like, no, it was kind of a pulp novel

141
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,440
that just got really popular.

142
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,440
And the prose is so beautiful.

143
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
So poetic.

144
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
Now what do we do?

145
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,440
We got a first draft, almost, pretty much.

146
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,440
Well now we have to homogenize it, because one of the problems with writing with eight

147
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,440
people is, you know, they all have their own voice.

148
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,440
And while the voices on many of them are very similar, some people are a little wordier

149
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,440
than others.

150
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,440
Oh yeah.

151
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,440
Some people are so funny.

152
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,440
Yeah.

153
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:00,440
And I feel like if one of our goals was to make Uncle Neil like the greatest character

154
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,440
in modern literature, I feel like we succeeded.

155
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
Mission accomplished.

156
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,440
And when we say we, we mean the person who wrote it.

157
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,440
Yeah, we gotta thank Allison for that one, she had most of the Uncle Neil chat.

158
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,440
Oh, you guys are gonna love it.

159
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,440
Uncle Neil is the bomb.

160
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,440
I wish he was in it more.

161
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,440
Well, mission accomplished.

162
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,440
He was our Carlisle, and we succeeded.

163
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,440
Yeah, and you're gonna wish this book was about him.

164
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,440
Yeah, and our good friend Kate is awesome and lovable.

165
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,440
And our ethnic third wheel, Vic.

166
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,440
Yeah, I think we kinda, I guess we kinda failed with him.

167
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,440
He's our Jacob, so it's okay.

168
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,440
I mean, let's face it, Jacob doesn't get interesting until the second book anyway, so.

169
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,440
Yeah, where we find out Vic is actually the final reincarnation of Vishnu.

170
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,440
And it's gonna be Vishnu versus Cthulhu.

171
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,440
Team Vishnu, team Cthulhu.

172
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,440
We're all going to hell.

173
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,440
So we're gonna homogenize.

174
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,440
We're gonna take everyone's chapters and do a sweep through.

175
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,440
And then we're gonna get it edited.

176
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:02,440
And then the worst, the absolute worst, worst, worst, worst, worst, worst aspect of any remotely

177
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,440
sort of kind of professional author.

178
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,440
The query process.

179
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,440
The worst thing ever.

180
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
Writing a query letter.

181
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,440
Making a plot summary.

182
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,440
Making submissions.

183
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,440
Yeah, so that will be fun.

184
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:24,440
So we'll get to, we will get help on that and your suggestions and everything.

185
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,440
Trying to make the query.

186
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,440
But we're not there yet.

187
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,440
Right now we're editing.

188
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,440
Oh yes, our chapter titles.

189
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,440
We decided we're all gonna start with C.

190
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,440
One word titles that mean nothing.

191
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,440
So throw us your patience.

192
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
Constellations.

193
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,440
Constellation.

194
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,440
Constellations.

195
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,440
Careening.

196
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
Car.

197
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,440
Choices.

198
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,440
Since we're not done, we're still as always open to little details.

199
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,440
You know, loops.

200
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,440
You know, character details.

201
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
We can still fit it in.

202
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,440
There's still time.

203
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,440
And as always, follow us on Twitter.

204
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
Badum.

205
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,440
And of course the funny, silly Twitter dedicated specifically to this project.

206
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,440
At sexyalienbook.

207
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,440
I won't ever change it.

208
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,440
He's technically an alien.

209
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,440
He's an alien, not from another planet, from another dimension.

210
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,440
Just between the spaces.

211
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,440
It's weird.

212
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
That was another thing about writing this.

213
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
I was just like, you know what?

214
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,440
We should just be deliberately inconsistent with the rules of this universe.

215
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,440
Because the author didn't think too hard.

216
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,440
So next week we're gonna talk about location a bit.

217
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,440
And in the meantime, we're just gonna edit this sucker.

218
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,440
And yeah.

219
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,440
Love never tugging.

220
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:45,440
.
