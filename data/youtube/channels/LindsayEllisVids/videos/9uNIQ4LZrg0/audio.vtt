WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.280
So we got a full house today, we had to make room for you and everything.

00:08.280 --> 00:09.280
I'm blocking the cool side.

00:09.280 --> 00:10.280
I feel so bad.

00:10.280 --> 00:11.280
I had to give up my comfy chair.

00:11.280 --> 00:14.160
You had to give up the comfy chairs for you.

00:14.160 --> 00:15.160
Sorry.

00:15.160 --> 00:25.480
The three of us have been, for the last couple weeks, living in the mind of a person that

00:25.480 --> 00:26.480
doesn't exist.

00:26.480 --> 00:27.480
Yes, but we've named her.

00:27.480 --> 00:34.960
Her name is Sarah Ellison, thanks to a random Facebook person who came up with that.

00:34.960 --> 00:35.960
We thought it was funny.

00:35.960 --> 00:36.960
Yeah.

00:36.960 --> 00:42.180
They said Sarah Ellison, we added the N. Yeah, so slightly modified, but we decided that

00:42.180 --> 00:47.160
she was a Midwestern housewife and mom who had never left her hometown of possibly Dayton,

00:47.160 --> 00:48.160
Ohio.

00:48.160 --> 00:51.040
We made up a Christian denomination for her.

00:51.040 --> 00:52.480
She has a religion.

00:52.480 --> 00:53.480
She's a Reform Anabaptist.

00:53.480 --> 00:54.480
No, and a Protestant.

00:54.480 --> 00:55.480
Yeah, she's a Reform Anaprotestant.

00:55.480 --> 00:56.480
Huh.

00:56.480 --> 00:57.480
No, I wasn't there for this comic.

00:57.480 --> 00:58.480
No, I wasn't.

00:58.480 --> 00:59.480
This is new information for me.

00:59.480 --> 01:00.480
Too busy writing.

01:00.480 --> 01:10.600
I think the most interesting thing about writing from this author's point of view is what does

01:10.600 --> 01:12.400
she think is romantic?

01:12.400 --> 01:13.400
Yeah.

01:13.400 --> 01:16.920
And writing these awful characters being awful people to each other.

01:16.920 --> 01:24.800
The romantic leads are Lego brick and are sexy Cthulhu, so he's domineering and overprotective

01:24.800 --> 01:30.520
and to her that's sexy because that means he loves her and she is wildly insecure and

01:30.520 --> 01:32.480
embarrassed of everything she does.

01:32.480 --> 01:34.040
It's been painfully awkward writing.

01:34.040 --> 01:35.040
Yeah.

01:35.040 --> 01:41.760
Just to have her be feeling these awful feelings like fear and pain and insecurity and shame.

01:41.760 --> 01:42.760
Embarrassment.

01:42.760 --> 01:43.760
Shame.

01:43.760 --> 01:44.760
Shame's boring.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.000
And romanticize and finding it to be sexy.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.760
Just like Fifty Shades.

01:48.760 --> 01:52.760
Not bad, but just awkward is like your, it's the Lovecraft element.

01:52.760 --> 01:59.760
It's like I'd be writing like, I am the great one and that is why I cannot go out with you.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.760
That's my favorite line in the whole thing so far.

02:02.760 --> 02:05.760
I cannot be your boyfriend.

02:05.760 --> 02:10.960
I've just been wondering how many more times I can have Lego brick think, oh god, we're

02:10.960 --> 02:12.440
just ants to you, aren't we?

02:12.440 --> 02:13.440
I'm not worthy.

02:13.440 --> 02:14.440
Oh god.

02:15.120 --> 02:16.400
Are you even paying any attention to me?

02:16.400 --> 02:18.000
We are just ants to you.

02:18.000 --> 02:26.240
I think at the end of the day, it's still a better book than most YA, kind of unintentionally

02:26.240 --> 02:27.240
so.

02:27.240 --> 02:30.800
It's turned out really good and our ghostwriters are five children.

02:30.800 --> 02:33.440
Yeah, Sarah Ellenson's five children.

02:33.440 --> 02:35.440
Yes, Sarah Ellenson has five children.

02:35.440 --> 02:36.440
Allison Ellenson.

02:36.440 --> 02:41.720
Allison Ellenson, Marianne Ellenson, Matt A and Matt B. Why does she have two children

02:41.720 --> 02:42.720
named Matt?

02:42.720 --> 02:43.720
Who knows?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
It's an Anaprotestant thing.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Josh Ellenson.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Yes, these are Sarah Ellenson's five children.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
It's an Anaprotestant tradition to have two children named the same name.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Matt A and Matt B.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
So let's talk a little bit about the process of writing a YA romance novel with eight people.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Eight people.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.800
First we divided it up amongst ourselves and we gave each of our ghostwriters two or three

03:06.800 --> 03:12.680
smaller sections to write and then sort of split the rest amongst ourselves and we had

03:12.680 --> 03:15.680
our outline in Google Docs, color coded it.

03:15.680 --> 03:19.560
Oh yeah, which kind of turned out to be a mistake because it's really hard to track

03:19.560 --> 03:20.560
changes.

03:20.560 --> 03:22.080
It was a rainbow cornucopia.

03:22.080 --> 03:26.680
So basically the way we did it in a sort of efficient manner was with technology, with

03:26.680 --> 03:34.840
the wonder and the glory that is Google, basically we had one master document which was where

03:34.840 --> 03:39.320
the outline is and where everyone could share ideas and keep everything straight, what is

03:39.320 --> 03:43.560
the class schedule for Lego Brick and all her friends, who are the teachers, what does

03:43.560 --> 03:48.960
her house look like, what are the settings for happening, character outlines.

03:48.960 --> 03:53.080
And then everybody had their each individual doc which only they could edit but everyone

03:53.080 --> 03:54.640
else could read and leave comments on.

03:54.640 --> 03:58.200
So we wrote the first draft of a book in two weeks, we were not done by any means.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.720
It's pretty solid though and some really good stuff.

04:00.720 --> 04:04.800
Still a better love story than Twilight, as the cliche goes.

04:04.800 --> 04:11.240
So in regards to writing this, I gotta say, writing this romance between Lego Brick and

04:11.240 --> 04:15.880
Sexy Cthulhu was painful in a way.

04:15.880 --> 04:19.320
Sometimes the ridiculousness of it would sort of keep it going because it was like, this

04:19.320 --> 04:23.480
is so ridiculous, I have to keep writing it, and then other times it was just so painful

04:23.480 --> 04:28.080
because it's such a painfully bad relationship.

04:28.080 --> 04:33.840
It's embarrassing to be part of, I mean I was writing like this for half the time that

04:33.840 --> 04:34.840
I wrote.

04:34.840 --> 04:39.160
I think one thing that was really fun about actually outlining it was when we were talking

04:39.160 --> 04:44.080
about how our author was writing about all these locations she'd never been to, like

04:44.080 --> 04:47.040
our location of Portsmouth, Rhode Island, and we have a little-

04:47.040 --> 04:48.040
Which is where it takes place.

04:48.040 --> 04:51.360
Yeah, like we have a little plot cul-de-sac where they go to New York City.

04:51.360 --> 04:55.520
We decided our author would get all her information about New York City from Home Alone 2.

04:55.520 --> 05:00.520
Yeah, it's all like, her entire perception of New York City is from Home Alone 2.

05:00.520 --> 05:02.400
And so there's- She gets everything wrong.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.840
There's prostitutes everywhere, the plaza is still a hotel.

05:04.840 --> 05:08.160
They can walk everywhere even if it's like 13 miles apart.

05:08.160 --> 05:12.960
They take a carriage ride, like the World Trade Center's still there.

05:12.960 --> 05:17.720
We didn't go that far, but- Portsmouth, Rhode Island, where our story

05:17.720 --> 05:18.720
takes place.

05:18.720 --> 05:19.720
None of us have ever been there.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.920
We purposefully did not do any research because we wanted to get it wrong.

05:22.920 --> 05:25.920
So we're just making up stuff that's there, and then there's this beach over here.

05:25.920 --> 05:30.880
That really hurt me to do, like to not be- They have a bonfire on the beach, which I

05:30.920 --> 05:34.240
I know, like I've never been there, and I know that's like a no bueno.

05:34.240 --> 05:35.240
Yeah, yeah.

05:35.240 --> 05:38.440
It hurts my soul thinking about how much I have not looked up with Portsmouth.

05:38.440 --> 05:39.440
I thought it was fun.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.280
I was like, this is great, all the not research I get.

05:42.280 --> 05:43.280
This is lazy writing.

05:43.280 --> 05:48.680
The other funnest part was going through it and having him do awful things to her.

05:48.680 --> 05:53.400
Like be controlling, or mean, or yell at her, or scare her, and have her be like, he's so

05:53.400 --> 05:54.400
sexy.

05:54.400 --> 05:55.400
Yeah.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.400
And he yells at me like that.

05:56.400 --> 05:57.400
It means he cares.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.960
Yeah, because he just wants to protect me.

06:00.040 --> 06:03.200
One of the things I was noticing myself trying to figure out how to do is, what I've noticed

06:03.200 --> 06:08.120
in these books is the info dumps, where the author has actually done research.

06:08.120 --> 06:10.760
It's like, here's a list of all my research.

06:10.760 --> 06:15.920
Or here's a list of things I know about, that the characters are just going to be discussing

06:15.920 --> 06:21.560
for no other reason besides, I need to up my word count, or something, or I want them

06:21.560 --> 06:23.760
to appear intelligent in some manner.

06:23.760 --> 06:25.640
Oh yes, like her favorite book.

06:25.640 --> 06:26.640
Yeah.

06:27.320 --> 06:32.840
Of course we made the favorite book, Phantom, because he's a monster, and I really like

06:32.840 --> 06:36.240
it because there's always this classic literature thing.

06:36.240 --> 06:40.840
On the road trip, he makes her sing Angel, and he thinks it's beautiful.

06:40.840 --> 06:44.840
And we made it so this woman's never actually read the book, she's just seen the musical.

06:44.840 --> 06:50.440
So she keeps quoting the book, and she's just quoting the musical, as if it's so deep and

06:50.440 --> 06:51.840
so romantic.

06:52.640 --> 06:56.840
One girl, I forget her name, she suggested The Great Gatsby, and we were originally going

06:56.840 --> 07:01.840
to go with that, especially in light of this new movie coming out.

07:01.840 --> 07:06.800
But we decided to go with Phantom because, well A, it's got the, he's a monster but I

07:06.800 --> 07:13.720
love him thing, and we can play with the musical, but also because it's really not great literature.

07:13.720 --> 07:19.440
The book is not that good, it was like a pulp novel when it was written that's kind of so

07:19.440 --> 07:22.440
old now that people think it's a classic.

07:22.440 --> 07:26.440
Yeah, well it's a classic because it's old, and it's like, no, it was kind of a pulp novel

07:26.440 --> 07:28.440
that just got really popular.

07:28.440 --> 07:30.440
And the prose is so beautiful.

07:30.440 --> 07:31.440
So poetic.

07:33.440 --> 07:34.440
Now what do we do?

07:34.440 --> 07:37.440
We got a first draft, almost, pretty much.

07:37.440 --> 07:41.440
Well now we have to homogenize it, because one of the problems with writing with eight

07:41.440 --> 07:45.440
people is, you know, they all have their own voice.

07:46.440 --> 07:50.440
And while the voices on many of them are very similar, some people are a little wordier

07:50.440 --> 07:51.440
than others.

07:51.440 --> 07:52.440
Oh yeah.

07:52.440 --> 07:53.440
Some people are so funny.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.440
Yeah.

07:54.440 --> 08:00.440
And I feel like if one of our goals was to make Uncle Neil like the greatest character

08:00.440 --> 08:03.440
in modern literature, I feel like we succeeded.

08:03.440 --> 08:04.440
Mission accomplished.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.440
And when we say we, we mean the person who wrote it.

08:06.440 --> 08:09.440
Yeah, we gotta thank Allison for that one, she had most of the Uncle Neil chat.

08:09.440 --> 08:11.440
Oh, you guys are gonna love it.

08:11.440 --> 08:13.440
Uncle Neil is the bomb.

08:13.440 --> 08:14.440
I wish he was in it more.

08:15.440 --> 08:17.440
Well, mission accomplished.

08:17.440 --> 08:20.440
He was our Carlisle, and we succeeded.

08:20.440 --> 08:22.440
Yeah, and you're gonna wish this book was about him.

08:22.440 --> 08:26.440
Yeah, and our good friend Kate is awesome and lovable.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.440
And our ethnic third wheel, Vic.

08:28.440 --> 08:32.440
Yeah, I think we kinda, I guess we kinda failed with him.

08:32.440 --> 08:34.440
He's our Jacob, so it's okay.

08:34.440 --> 08:37.440
I mean, let's face it, Jacob doesn't get interesting until the second book anyway, so.

08:37.440 --> 08:42.440
Yeah, where we find out Vic is actually the final reincarnation of Vishnu.

08:42.440 --> 08:44.440
And it's gonna be Vishnu versus Cthulhu.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.440
Team Vishnu, team Cthulhu.

08:46.440 --> 08:48.440
We're all going to hell.

08:48.440 --> 08:49.440
So we're gonna homogenize.

08:49.440 --> 08:53.440
We're gonna take everyone's chapters and do a sweep through.

08:53.440 --> 08:56.440
And then we're gonna get it edited.

08:56.440 --> 09:02.440
And then the worst, the absolute worst, worst, worst, worst, worst, worst aspect of any remotely

09:02.440 --> 09:05.440
sort of kind of professional author.

09:05.440 --> 09:08.440
The query process.

09:09.440 --> 09:11.440
The worst thing ever.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.440
Writing a query letter.

09:13.440 --> 09:15.440
Making a plot summary.

09:15.440 --> 09:16.440
Making submissions.

09:16.440 --> 09:18.440
Yeah, so that will be fun.

09:18.440 --> 09:24.440
So we'll get to, we will get help on that and your suggestions and everything.

09:24.440 --> 09:26.440
Trying to make the query.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.440
But we're not there yet.

09:28.440 --> 09:29.440
Right now we're editing.

09:29.440 --> 09:30.440
Oh yes, our chapter titles.

09:30.440 --> 09:32.440
We decided we're all gonna start with C.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.440
One word titles that mean nothing.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.440
So throw us your patience.

09:36.440 --> 09:37.440
Constellations.

09:37.440 --> 09:38.440
Constellation.

09:38.440 --> 09:40.440
Constellations.

09:41.440 --> 09:42.440
Careening.

09:43.440 --> 09:44.440
Car.

09:46.440 --> 09:47.440
Choices.

09:48.440 --> 09:51.440
Since we're not done, we're still as always open to little details.

09:51.440 --> 09:53.440
You know, loops.

09:53.440 --> 09:55.440
You know, character details.

09:55.440 --> 09:56.440
We can still fit it in.

09:56.440 --> 09:57.440
There's still time.

09:57.440 --> 09:59.440
And as always, follow us on Twitter.

09:59.440 --> 10:00.440
Badum.

10:00.440 --> 10:05.440
And of course the funny, silly Twitter dedicated specifically to this project.

10:05.440 --> 10:07.440
At sexyalienbook.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.440
I won't ever change it.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.440
He's technically an alien.

10:11.440 --> 10:14.440
He's an alien, not from another planet, from another dimension.

10:14.440 --> 10:16.440
Just between the spaces.

10:16.440 --> 10:17.440
It's weird.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.440
That was another thing about writing this.

10:19.440 --> 10:20.440
I was just like, you know what?

10:20.440 --> 10:24.440
We should just be deliberately inconsistent with the rules of this universe.

10:24.440 --> 10:26.440
Because the author didn't think too hard.

10:26.440 --> 10:29.440
So next week we're gonna talk about location a bit.

10:29.440 --> 10:31.440
And in the meantime, we're just gonna edit this sucker.

10:31.440 --> 10:34.440
And yeah.

10:34.440 --> 10:36.440
Love never tugging.

10:38.440 --> 10:45.440
.
