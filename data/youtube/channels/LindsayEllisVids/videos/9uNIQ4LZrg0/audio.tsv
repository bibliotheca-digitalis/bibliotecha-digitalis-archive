0	8280	So we got a full house today, we had to make room for you and everything.
8280	9280	I'm blocking the cool side.
9280	10280	I feel so bad.
10280	11280	I had to give up my comfy chair.
11280	14160	You had to give up the comfy chairs for you.
14160	15160	Sorry.
15160	25480	The three of us have been, for the last couple weeks, living in the mind of a person that
25480	26480	doesn't exist.
26480	27480	Yes, but we've named her.
27480	34960	Her name is Sarah Ellison, thanks to a random Facebook person who came up with that.
34960	35960	We thought it was funny.
35960	36960	Yeah.
36960	42180	They said Sarah Ellison, we added the N. Yeah, so slightly modified, but we decided that
42180	47160	she was a Midwestern housewife and mom who had never left her hometown of possibly Dayton,
47160	48160	Ohio.
48160	51040	We made up a Christian denomination for her.
51040	52480	She has a religion.
52480	53480	She's a Reform Anabaptist.
53480	54480	No, and a Protestant.
54480	55480	Yeah, she's a Reform Anaprotestant.
55480	56480	Huh.
56480	57480	No, I wasn't there for this comic.
57480	58480	No, I wasn't.
58480	59480	This is new information for me.
59480	60480	Too busy writing.
60480	70600	I think the most interesting thing about writing from this author's point of view is what does
70600	72400	she think is romantic?
72400	73400	Yeah.
73400	76920	And writing these awful characters being awful people to each other.
76920	84800	The romantic leads are Lego brick and are sexy Cthulhu, so he's domineering and overprotective
84800	90520	and to her that's sexy because that means he loves her and she is wildly insecure and
90520	92480	embarrassed of everything she does.
92480	94040	It's been painfully awkward writing.
94040	95040	Yeah.
95040	101760	Just to have her be feeling these awful feelings like fear and pain and insecurity and shame.
101760	102760	Embarrassment.
102760	103760	Shame.
103760	104760	Shame's boring.
104800	107000	And romanticize and finding it to be sexy.
107000	108760	Just like Fifty Shades.
108760	112760	Not bad, but just awkward is like your, it's the Lovecraft element.
112760	119760	It's like I'd be writing like, I am the great one and that is why I cannot go out with you.
119760	122760	That's my favorite line in the whole thing so far.
122760	125760	I cannot be your boyfriend.
125760	130960	I've just been wondering how many more times I can have Lego brick think, oh god, we're
130960	132440	just ants to you, aren't we?
132440	133440	I'm not worthy.
133440	134440	Oh god.
135120	136400	Are you even paying any attention to me?
136400	138000	We are just ants to you.
138000	146240	I think at the end of the day, it's still a better book than most YA, kind of unintentionally
146240	147240	so.
147240	150800	It's turned out really good and our ghostwriters are five children.
150800	153440	Yeah, Sarah Ellenson's five children.
153440	155440	Yes, Sarah Ellenson has five children.
155440	156440	Allison Ellenson.
156440	161720	Allison Ellenson, Marianne Ellenson, Matt A and Matt B. Why does she have two children
161720	162720	named Matt?
162720	163720	Who knows?
164000	165000	It's an Anaprotestant thing.
165000	166000	Josh Ellenson.
166000	168000	Yes, these are Sarah Ellenson's five children.
168000	171000	It's an Anaprotestant tradition to have two children named the same name.
171000	173000	Matt A and Matt B.
174000	180000	So let's talk a little bit about the process of writing a YA romance novel with eight people.
180000	181000	Eight people.
181000	186800	First we divided it up amongst ourselves and we gave each of our ghostwriters two or three
186800	192680	smaller sections to write and then sort of split the rest amongst ourselves and we had
192680	195680	our outline in Google Docs, color coded it.
195680	199560	Oh yeah, which kind of turned out to be a mistake because it's really hard to track
199560	200560	changes.
200560	202080	It was a rainbow cornucopia.
202080	206680	So basically the way we did it in a sort of efficient manner was with technology, with
206680	214840	the wonder and the glory that is Google, basically we had one master document which was where
214840	219320	the outline is and where everyone could share ideas and keep everything straight, what is
219320	223560	the class schedule for Lego Brick and all her friends, who are the teachers, what does
223560	228960	her house look like, what are the settings for happening, character outlines.
228960	233080	And then everybody had their each individual doc which only they could edit but everyone
233080	234640	else could read and leave comments on.
234640	238200	So we wrote the first draft of a book in two weeks, we were not done by any means.
238200	240720	It's pretty solid though and some really good stuff.
240720	244800	Still a better love story than Twilight, as the cliche goes.
244800	251240	So in regards to writing this, I gotta say, writing this romance between Lego Brick and
251240	255880	Sexy Cthulhu was painful in a way.
255880	259320	Sometimes the ridiculousness of it would sort of keep it going because it was like, this
259320	263480	is so ridiculous, I have to keep writing it, and then other times it was just so painful
263480	268080	because it's such a painfully bad relationship.
268080	273840	It's embarrassing to be part of, I mean I was writing like this for half the time that
273840	274840	I wrote.
274840	279160	I think one thing that was really fun about actually outlining it was when we were talking
279160	284080	about how our author was writing about all these locations she'd never been to, like
284080	287040	our location of Portsmouth, Rhode Island, and we have a little-
287040	288040	Which is where it takes place.
288040	291360	Yeah, like we have a little plot cul-de-sac where they go to New York City.
291360	295520	We decided our author would get all her information about New York City from Home Alone 2.
295520	300520	Yeah, it's all like, her entire perception of New York City is from Home Alone 2.
300520	302400	And so there's- She gets everything wrong.
302400	304840	There's prostitutes everywhere, the plaza is still a hotel.
304840	308160	They can walk everywhere even if it's like 13 miles apart.
308160	312960	They take a carriage ride, like the World Trade Center's still there.
312960	317720	We didn't go that far, but- Portsmouth, Rhode Island, where our story
317720	318720	takes place.
318720	319720	None of us have ever been there.
319720	322920	We purposefully did not do any research because we wanted to get it wrong.
322920	325920	So we're just making up stuff that's there, and then there's this beach over here.
325920	330880	That really hurt me to do, like to not be- They have a bonfire on the beach, which I
330920	334240	I know, like I've never been there, and I know that's like a no bueno.
334240	335240	Yeah, yeah.
335240	338440	It hurts my soul thinking about how much I have not looked up with Portsmouth.
338440	339440	I thought it was fun.
339440	342280	I was like, this is great, all the not research I get.
342280	343280	This is lazy writing.
343280	348680	The other funnest part was going through it and having him do awful things to her.
348680	353400	Like be controlling, or mean, or yell at her, or scare her, and have her be like, he's so
353400	354400	sexy.
354400	355400	Yeah.
355400	356400	And he yells at me like that.
356400	357400	It means he cares.
357400	359960	Yeah, because he just wants to protect me.
360040	363200	One of the things I was noticing myself trying to figure out how to do is, what I've noticed
363200	368120	in these books is the info dumps, where the author has actually done research.
368120	370760	It's like, here's a list of all my research.
370760	375920	Or here's a list of things I know about, that the characters are just going to be discussing
375920	381560	for no other reason besides, I need to up my word count, or something, or I want them
381560	383760	to appear intelligent in some manner.
383760	385640	Oh yes, like her favorite book.
385640	386640	Yeah.
387320	392840	Of course we made the favorite book, Phantom, because he's a monster, and I really like
392840	396240	it because there's always this classic literature thing.
396240	400840	On the road trip, he makes her sing Angel, and he thinks it's beautiful.
400840	404840	And we made it so this woman's never actually read the book, she's just seen the musical.
404840	410440	So she keeps quoting the book, and she's just quoting the musical, as if it's so deep and
410440	411840	so romantic.
412640	416840	One girl, I forget her name, she suggested The Great Gatsby, and we were originally going
416840	421840	to go with that, especially in light of this new movie coming out.
421840	426800	But we decided to go with Phantom because, well A, it's got the, he's a monster but I
426800	433720	love him thing, and we can play with the musical, but also because it's really not great literature.
433720	439440	The book is not that good, it was like a pulp novel when it was written that's kind of so
439440	442440	old now that people think it's a classic.
442440	446440	Yeah, well it's a classic because it's old, and it's like, no, it was kind of a pulp novel
446440	448440	that just got really popular.
448440	450440	And the prose is so beautiful.
450440	451440	So poetic.
453440	454440	Now what do we do?
454440	457440	We got a first draft, almost, pretty much.
457440	461440	Well now we have to homogenize it, because one of the problems with writing with eight
461440	465440	people is, you know, they all have their own voice.
466440	470440	And while the voices on many of them are very similar, some people are a little wordier
470440	471440	than others.
471440	472440	Oh yeah.
472440	473440	Some people are so funny.
473440	474440	Yeah.
474440	480440	And I feel like if one of our goals was to make Uncle Neil like the greatest character
480440	483440	in modern literature, I feel like we succeeded.
483440	484440	Mission accomplished.
484440	486440	And when we say we, we mean the person who wrote it.
486440	489440	Yeah, we gotta thank Allison for that one, she had most of the Uncle Neil chat.
489440	491440	Oh, you guys are gonna love it.
491440	493440	Uncle Neil is the bomb.
493440	494440	I wish he was in it more.
495440	497440	Well, mission accomplished.
497440	500440	He was our Carlisle, and we succeeded.
500440	502440	Yeah, and you're gonna wish this book was about him.
502440	506440	Yeah, and our good friend Kate is awesome and lovable.
506440	508440	And our ethnic third wheel, Vic.
508440	512440	Yeah, I think we kinda, I guess we kinda failed with him.
512440	514440	He's our Jacob, so it's okay.
514440	517440	I mean, let's face it, Jacob doesn't get interesting until the second book anyway, so.
517440	522440	Yeah, where we find out Vic is actually the final reincarnation of Vishnu.
522440	524440	And it's gonna be Vishnu versus Cthulhu.
524440	526440	Team Vishnu, team Cthulhu.
526440	528440	We're all going to hell.
528440	529440	So we're gonna homogenize.
529440	533440	We're gonna take everyone's chapters and do a sweep through.
533440	536440	And then we're gonna get it edited.
536440	542440	And then the worst, the absolute worst, worst, worst, worst, worst, worst aspect of any remotely
542440	545440	sort of kind of professional author.
545440	548440	The query process.
549440	551440	The worst thing ever.
551440	553440	Writing a query letter.
553440	555440	Making a plot summary.
555440	556440	Making submissions.
556440	558440	Yeah, so that will be fun.
558440	564440	So we'll get to, we will get help on that and your suggestions and everything.
564440	566440	Trying to make the query.
566440	568440	But we're not there yet.
568440	569440	Right now we're editing.
569440	570440	Oh yes, our chapter titles.
570440	572440	We decided we're all gonna start with C.
572440	574440	One word titles that mean nothing.
574440	576440	So throw us your patience.
576440	577440	Constellations.
577440	578440	Constellation.
578440	580440	Constellations.
581440	582440	Careening.
583440	584440	Car.
586440	587440	Choices.
588440	591440	Since we're not done, we're still as always open to little details.
591440	593440	You know, loops.
593440	595440	You know, character details.
595440	596440	We can still fit it in.
596440	597440	There's still time.
597440	599440	And as always, follow us on Twitter.
599440	600440	Badum.
600440	605440	And of course the funny, silly Twitter dedicated specifically to this project.
605440	607440	At sexyalienbook.
607440	608440	I won't ever change it.
609440	611440	He's technically an alien.
611440	614440	He's an alien, not from another planet, from another dimension.
614440	616440	Just between the spaces.
616440	617440	It's weird.
617440	619440	That was another thing about writing this.
619440	620440	I was just like, you know what?
620440	624440	We should just be deliberately inconsistent with the rules of this universe.
624440	626440	Because the author didn't think too hard.
626440	629440	So next week we're gonna talk about location a bit.
629440	631440	And in the meantime, we're just gonna edit this sucker.
631440	634440	And yeah.
634440	636440	Love never tugging.
638440	645440	.
