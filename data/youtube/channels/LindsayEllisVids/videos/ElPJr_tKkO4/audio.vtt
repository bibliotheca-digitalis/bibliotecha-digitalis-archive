WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Oh my god.

00:30.000 --> 00:57.800
So here we are. In Hobbiton. Well, the movie set fictionally known as Hobbiton. In New

00:57.800 --> 01:05.840
Zealand, trying to recapture the lost magic of our childhoods. It comes easier to some

01:05.840 --> 01:14.160
of us. I'm going on an adventure! Nella, you were 28 when that movie came out. Anyway.

01:14.160 --> 01:21.920
This isn't so bad. I mean, it's a little exploitative, but you know, this is actually

01:21.920 --> 01:28.040
kind of fun. This is pretty fun. This is actually a lot of fun. I don't think I've

01:28.040 --> 01:33.920
reclaimed any lost innocence, but I am having fun. Still, I do have a bigger purpose in

01:33.920 --> 01:39.480
coming here. Sure, yeah, we want to recapture that childhood magic. But first, before we

01:39.480 --> 01:44.560
allow ourselves to really go down that road, since this is a movie set made by a production,

01:44.560 --> 01:54.400
we need to talk about the production. We really need to figure out. Okay, let's go

01:54.400 --> 01:58.520
back. Lord of the Rings movies come out, Jackson wins all of the Oscars, the movies make all

01:58.520 --> 02:02.000
the money. Then the good times come to an end when Jackson and company decide that New

02:02.000 --> 02:05.440
Line Cinema, the studio that bankrolled and distributed their Lord of the Rings films,

02:05.440 --> 02:09.100
is holding out on them. So factor number one is Jackson's original lawsuit against New

02:09.100 --> 02:13.820
Line Cinema in 2005. To keep this short, this results in Jackson being booted from all things

02:13.860 --> 02:18.020
related to The Hobbit eventually turning into a feature film or several. A couple of years

02:18.020 --> 02:23.100
pass and then in late 2007, Jackson and company settle out of court and he agrees to executive

02:23.100 --> 02:27.020
produce The Hobbit movies. But Jackson does not want to direct The Hobbit films owing to his

02:27.020 --> 02:31.060
commitments to Tintin and The Lovely Bones, although he does want to be involved along

02:31.060 --> 02:34.860
with Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens in a producorial context. In Jackson's words,

02:34.860 --> 02:38.980
he's already spent three three-hour movies in Middle-earth and that was enough for him. The

02:38.980 --> 02:43.580
guy he wants to direct is Guillermo del Toro, who is fresh off the triumph of his Hellboy movies and

02:44.060 --> 02:49.260
a critical darling, Pan's Labyrinth. Also around this time, New Line Cinema merges with Warner

02:49.260 --> 02:54.500
Brothers in 2008. So in the grand tango of rights, this is how Warner Brothers acquired the rights to

02:54.500 --> 02:59.620
all things The Lord of the Rings, but not the rights to The Hobbit. See, MGM has those. And

02:59.620 --> 03:05.300
MGM has a problem. 3.7 billion of them in fact, which was around the amount of crippling debt

03:05.300 --> 03:09.580
the studio had amassed around the time of the Warner Brothers New Line merger. Given this debt,

03:09.580 --> 03:14.340
MGM could not finance or even co-finance a blockbuster project. So given that New Line

03:14.340 --> 03:17.820
and Warner Brothers were very anxious to create what would inevitably be lucrative movies based

03:17.820 --> 03:22.980
on The Hobbit, MGM and New Line brokered a right-sharing deal for two movies, both directed

03:22.980 --> 03:28.980
by Guillermo del Toro. The year is 2009, pre-production is a go for del Toro's The Hobbit.

03:28.980 --> 03:37.460
I am exploding with the desire of just showing everything. Del Toro was much more keen on The

03:37.460 --> 03:41.500
Hobbit than he was for The Lord of the Rings. His vision was to make the films both visually and

03:41.500 --> 03:46.300
tonally distinct from The Lord of the Rings, and to give them a more operatic, fairytale-like feel

03:46.300 --> 03:50.860
in contrast to the more grounded tone and aesthetic of The Lord of the Rings. Del Toro seemed to want

03:50.860 --> 03:54.980
to capture the whimsical spirit of the book. You don't have a committee. You don't have a group of

03:54.980 --> 04:01.060
studio people telling you there should be a happy ending here and they should never go to see the

04:01.060 --> 04:07.860
Spiders. Bjorn is not rating with this age group. But as we would find out later, that wasn't what

04:07.860 --> 04:13.020
Jackson or the studio wanted. Del Toro lived in Wellington for 18 months working on pre-production

04:13.020 --> 04:18.860
for The Hobbit before leaving the project in late 2009. And here, okay, here's where it starts to

04:18.860 --> 04:23.580
get a little bit tinfoil hattie, but bear with me. After del Toro left, all parties involved cited

04:23.580 --> 04:28.180
scheduling conflicts and claimed that it was all taking too long, and del Toro got impatient and

04:28.180 --> 04:33.100
wanted to work on other things, so he left. But given how quickly The Hobbit went into production

04:33.100 --> 04:41.380
after he left, to me that reads either as a partial truth or a mistruth. In 2012, Philip

04:41.380 --> 04:45.100
O'Boyan stated that Peter Jackson had to step up and direct for it to start making sense in terms

04:45.100 --> 04:50.660
of those financial models. But for del Toro, the issue feels emotionally fraught.

04:50.660 --> 04:59.380
I have incredible heartache. I feel terrible about it. It's very hard, it's getting a little

04:59.380 --> 05:04.700
easier to talk about it, but essentially it's like you've been recently widowed and everybody

05:04.700 --> 05:10.980
asking you exactly how your wife died. Again, there may be partial truths to the idea that this was all

05:10.980 --> 05:15.860
just taking too long, but this does not read to me of a guy who voluntarily left a project he'd

05:15.860 --> 05:21.260
spent almost two years on because he was feeling impatient and wanted to fly free, little bird. Yeah,

05:21.260 --> 05:26.540
it was taking a while, but if you've worked in film, you know that 18 months of pre-production

05:26.540 --> 05:32.540
for a project this huge, it's not that much. There was none of this taking wonderful photographs in

05:32.540 --> 05:38.340
front of racks of armour, completed a year before production as we did on Lord of the Rings. If you

05:38.340 --> 05:43.300
think about that time, there was incredible planning. There were three and a half years

05:43.460 --> 05:47.860
of pre-production before we rolled the cameras. And then there's the fact that when Jackson took

05:47.860 --> 05:52.260
over, those 18 months of pre-production got completely scrapped. Jackson threw out everything

05:52.260 --> 05:55.820
that del Toro had done, which speaks to me that there was something about del Toro's vision that

05:55.820 --> 06:00.100
was fundamentally at odds with the movies that Jackson and the studio wanted to make. But here's

06:00.100 --> 06:05.820
the thing, I don't think that the studio really knew what movies they wanted, just that they wanted

06:05.820 --> 06:09.740
it to look and feel like the Lord of the Rings, because they aren't shy about the fact that no

06:09.740 --> 06:13.100
department was given adequate time and there was effectively no pre-production.

06:13.100 --> 06:15.380
Penny never got a chance to prep these movies.

06:15.380 --> 06:18.300
You can't, I can't say that, but he didn't.

06:18.300 --> 06:24.380
You now have to plan on the go. You're laying the tracks directly in front of the train,

06:24.380 --> 06:27.860
and that chased us all the way to the end.

06:27.860 --> 06:32.940
Question to me is why, if they've already wasted so much time and money on del Toro's

06:32.940 --> 06:37.620
pre-production, why not give Jackson at least a few months? The best answer I've been able to

06:37.620 --> 06:42.420
find is those financial models. Pre-production costs money, and Warner Brothers felt like they'd

06:42.420 --> 06:47.700
wasted enough, so the decree was to get it done, do it now, or we will find someone who will.

06:47.700 --> 06:53.420
At least that's what it seems like to me. New Zealand is a small country. Surely if I poke

06:53.420 --> 06:57.940
around I can find someone who can tell me what happened on the set. Or better yet,

06:57.940 --> 06:59.580
find someone who was actually there.

07:00.580 --> 07:08.580
This was the day, the last day, that we were all, the core cast, were all together.

07:08.580 --> 07:17.580
The Hobbit and the wizard with all the dwarves. And each one of us got one of these.

07:17.580 --> 07:28.580
Yes, my name is John Callan, and I've worked in theatre, television, radio, film, since the early 70s.

07:28.580 --> 07:34.580
In The Hobbit, I play one of the dwarves, and I played a character called Oin.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.580
He said he's an expert!

07:36.580 --> 07:45.580
As I say, we kicked off with tremendous enthusiasm, a real sense of brotherhood, camaraderie,

07:45.580 --> 07:53.580
and everybody working together. There wasn't one toss-pot person in the core cast. We really

07:53.580 --> 08:03.580
had a tremendous sense of brotherhood, of multiple different characters coming together

08:03.580 --> 08:09.580
for a single and very important purpose. And there was a determination within the cast

08:09.580 --> 08:14.580
that we would be a band of brothers, basically.

08:14.580 --> 08:21.580
There is, I don't know whether all your viewers would know this, but it's a very common expression

08:21.580 --> 08:26.580
that the film industry is run on the motto, hurry up and wait.

08:26.580 --> 08:33.580
And there was more of that in this production than any other production I have worked on.

08:33.580 --> 08:40.580
We'd go through make-up and costume, prosthetics, that kind of thing, get ready, and then wait,

08:40.580 --> 08:47.580
and wait, and wait. And it so happened that for a number of people, and it wasn't just the

08:47.580 --> 08:52.580
cast that also rans among us, they wouldn't be used.

08:52.580 --> 08:56.580
And so at the end of the day, we'd been waiting all day, and nothing would have happened,

08:56.580 --> 09:00.580
and we just went, oh, well, fine, at least I'm being paid, and the next day there'd be

09:00.580 --> 09:05.580
a nice bottle of wine saying, oh, thank you for being so decent about this kind of thing.

09:05.580 --> 09:08.580
And we were very happy to get those bottles of wine.

09:08.580 --> 09:16.580
As it went on, the bottles of wine ceased, and the waiting got even longer.

09:16.580 --> 09:20.580
There would be the schedule on the wall, and we would just put a little number up of

09:20.580 --> 09:25.580
how many changes to this schedule there would be within this week or this month.

09:25.580 --> 09:32.580
Then somebody would win a bottle of martini or something, that kind of nonsense.

09:32.580 --> 09:36.580
The changes were incredible. Now, I'm not saying they weren't necessary,

09:36.580 --> 09:43.580
but they may well have come out of the fact that there had initially been the intention

09:43.580 --> 09:50.580
of using a director who had spent time prepping all this thing, and then Peter Jackson thought,

09:50.580 --> 09:56.580
well, if Guillermo del Toro has moved on to do the other work that he needs to do,

09:56.580 --> 10:03.580
I'll pick up the mantle. Other influences may have come from the studios.

10:07.580 --> 10:11.580
It's hard not to feel for Jackson and company. With the original director gone,

10:11.580 --> 10:14.580
Peter Jackson was put into this position where he had to do what the studio wanted.

10:14.580 --> 10:17.580
He couldn't pass the job off to someone who was really hungry for it.

10:17.580 --> 10:22.580
If he passed on directing, there was no reason for Warner Brothers to keep the production in New Zealand.

10:22.580 --> 10:26.580
So, with no other director and no time, Jackson had to do it.

10:26.580 --> 10:29.580
And he had to do it according to the time frame laid down by Warner Brothers.

10:29.580 --> 10:32.580
And he was also forced to defend their decisions.

10:32.580 --> 10:35.580
It meant that we had a second movie, like the middle movie, The Desolation of Shemelle,

10:35.580 --> 10:38.580
where we could actually have a little bit more fun with it too.

10:38.580 --> 10:44.580
Uh-huh. We may never know, but effectively the cost of making three movies instead of two was not a huge jump.

10:44.580 --> 10:49.580
And there were more parties at play here than just New Line, Warner Brothers and MGM with their billions of debt.

10:49.580 --> 10:53.580
There was producer Saul Santz, who also had a hand in the rights deal.

10:53.580 --> 10:56.580
And guess who else came to the feast?

10:56.580 --> 10:59.580
Yep, Harvey Weinstein is here too.

10:59.580 --> 11:02.580
So where the Lord of the Rings had one studio bankrolling the films,

11:02.580 --> 11:07.580
The Hobbit had five, either bankrolling or taking a cut.

11:07.580 --> 11:11.580
Warner Brothers, parent company of New Line, MGM, which owned the rights to The Hobbit,

11:11.580 --> 11:15.580
producer Saul Santz, who having nothing to do with the production, didn't take his cut,

11:15.580 --> 11:18.580
and Harvey Weinstein, who reaped millions from The Hobbit movies.

11:18.580 --> 11:23.580
But according to the deal he struck with Warner Brothers, only the first Hobbit movie.

11:23.580 --> 11:25.580
No, he was not actively involved with the production,

11:25.580 --> 11:31.580
but he did take a sizable cut from the first film due to a deal that he had struck with MGM in the long, long ago time.

11:31.580 --> 11:35.580
So when you take into consideration all of these outside interests that had nothing to do with the actual production,

11:35.580 --> 11:40.580
but who were owed cuts of the first film, but only the first film,

11:41.580 --> 11:46.580
having three films instead of two doesn't seem like such a bad idea.

11:46.580 --> 11:49.580
And that was only one influence the studio might have had.

11:49.580 --> 11:57.580
They may, for instance, have wanted less of the story of the dwarves with The Hobbit,

11:57.580 --> 12:04.580
and more the story of the punch-ups, the fights, you know, the battles per se.

12:06.580 --> 12:12.580
The idea of having a love story in there, which wasn't in the book,

12:12.580 --> 12:16.580
whether one thinks that was well thought out or not.

12:16.580 --> 12:18.580
Aren't you going to search me?

12:20.580 --> 12:21.580
I could have anything down my trousers.

12:23.580 --> 12:24.580
Or nothing.

12:24.580 --> 12:30.580
So as we set off making the first of what we thought was going to be two films,

12:30.580 --> 12:37.580
there was a really strong bond with very different aspects to each of these characters.

12:37.580 --> 12:43.580
As it went on, we kind of had the feeling that, in fact,

12:43.580 --> 12:47.580
there were one or two people whose parts were going to grow,

12:47.580 --> 12:51.580
because they were young and good-looking and feisty and all that kind of thing.

12:51.580 --> 12:54.580
We got left behind a bit.

12:54.580 --> 13:02.580
How much that was based on what was originally intended, I'm not sure,

13:02.580 --> 13:07.580
because we didn't initially have complete scripts for three films,

13:07.580 --> 13:11.580
because initially there were going to be only two films.

13:11.580 --> 13:17.580
All I can tell you is that there was a definite feeling within the core cast

13:18.580 --> 13:26.580
that Peter was, if you like, he wasn't the final arbiter.

13:26.580 --> 13:28.580
One certainly gets that impression.

13:28.580 --> 13:31.580
Just look at this thousand-yard stare.

13:36.580 --> 13:39.580
Changes to increased marketability in movies are inevitable,

13:39.580 --> 13:41.580
and no, of course they're not always evil,

13:41.580 --> 13:44.580
but in the case of The Hobbit, they kind of build up.

13:44.580 --> 13:46.580
Let's run through just a few.

13:47.580 --> 13:51.580
The Hobbit

13:51.580 --> 13:55.580
With The Hobbit, it seemed like Peej started to fall down the same technology hole

13:55.580 --> 13:58.580
that swallowed the likes of James Cameron and George Lucas.

13:58.580 --> 14:03.580
A big gimmick that the film was sold on was being shot in 48 frames per second 3D.

14:03.580 --> 14:06.580
One consequence is that the models and matte paintings they used in The Lord of the Rings

14:06.580 --> 14:10.580
looked like models and matte paintings in 48 frames per second 3D,

14:10.580 --> 14:13.580
so there was a much heavier reliance on CGI.

14:13.580 --> 14:17.580
They also couldn't use the forced perspective that worked so well in The Lord of the Rings.

14:17.580 --> 14:20.580
The mileage of 48 frames per second varies by viewer.

14:20.580 --> 14:22.580
Some people are more sensitive to it than others.

14:22.580 --> 14:25.580
Some people like it, for some people it gives them a headache.

14:25.580 --> 14:30.580
But where CGI is concerned, more frames means more render time and more computer power needed.

14:30.580 --> 14:35.580
Part of the problem with the visual effects was the lack of time the CGI artists had for a lot of these shots.

14:35.580 --> 14:37.580
Contrast how amazing Gollum looks,

14:38.580 --> 14:43.580
and the melting gold on a dragon.

14:43.580 --> 14:45.580
Yikes.

14:45.580 --> 14:49.580
One of these scenes got the time and care it needed to look photorealistic, the other did not.

14:49.580 --> 14:54.580
The real irony is that 3D 48 frames per second version only now exists in prints.

14:54.580 --> 14:55.580
You can't see it anywhere.

14:55.580 --> 15:00.580
If you watch The Hobbit on Blu-ray, you're watching it in 2398 frames per second, not 48.

15:00.580 --> 15:06.580
I suspect this is also why we got uncanny valley Dian instead of Billy Connolly in makeup.

15:06.580 --> 15:10.580
Dian even gets his own chapter in the appendices, and they pronounce it Dane for some reason.

15:10.580 --> 15:11.580
Dane.

15:11.580 --> 15:12.580
Dane.

15:12.580 --> 15:14.580
This is Dane, Lord of the Iron Hills.

15:14.580 --> 15:20.580
They never explain or even acknowledge the decision to put Dian CGI instead of a guy in makeup like the rest of the dwarves are.

15:20.580 --> 15:23.580
Another marketability change, as we mentioned in the last video,

15:23.580 --> 15:28.580
is the inclusion of a bunch of characters from The Lord of the Rings that have nothing to do with the plot as written in The Hobbit.

15:28.580 --> 15:32.580
Galadriel, Saruman, Frodo, Legolas.

15:32.580 --> 15:39.580
The arc they seem to be going for with Galadriel was that confronting Sauron and doing magic battle with him drained her,

15:39.580 --> 15:41.580
and that's why she has to go to Lothlorien.

15:41.580 --> 15:45.580
Her strength is failing. Take her to Lothlorien.

15:45.580 --> 15:50.580
Which, I mean, okay. It's better than what they do with poor Legolas.

15:55.580 --> 16:00.580
Legolas should have been a cameo, which was, like, the one thing Pirates of the Caribbean 5 did right.

16:00.580 --> 16:03.580
Because it makes sense that Bilbo and the dwarves would have run into him in Mirkwood.

16:03.580 --> 16:07.580
But because he was such a popular Rings character, they'd go ahead and bump him up to the main cast.

16:07.580 --> 16:11.580
And it continues with another Legolas problem we saw throughout the Rings trilogy.

16:11.580 --> 16:14.580
In Fellowship, he's just kind of, you know, cool and an archer.

16:14.580 --> 16:18.580
And by the end of Return of the King, he's basically, like, Spider-Man.

16:22.580 --> 16:23.580
In The Hobbit...

16:23.580 --> 16:24.580
In The Hobbit...

16:29.580 --> 16:30.580
Woof.

16:30.580 --> 16:34.580
So let's ignore Super Legolas. Let's talk about his character arcs.

16:34.580 --> 16:36.580
First, there is the mom.

16:36.580 --> 16:40.580
About halfway through the Battle of Five Armies, the movie drops this bomb on the audience.

16:45.580 --> 16:47.580
Okay.

16:47.580 --> 16:50.580
And during Legolas' last scene in the movie, we get this.

16:54.580 --> 16:55.580
More than anyone.

16:55.580 --> 16:57.580
Was that in dispute?

16:57.580 --> 17:01.580
So at a point in history, Legolas' mom died fighting.

17:01.580 --> 17:02.580
There is no grave.

17:04.580 --> 17:05.580
No memory.

17:05.580 --> 17:09.580
This somehow led to something of a falling out between Legolas and his father.

17:09.580 --> 17:11.580
My father does not speak of it.

17:11.580 --> 17:14.580
So what we get in the theatrical cut is a motivation with no consequence.

17:14.580 --> 17:18.580
We get a cliche mom-dead, dad-mad, kid-sad situation,

17:18.580 --> 17:21.580
in which the dead parent drives a separation between them,

17:21.580 --> 17:23.580
so now they never have to really talk,

17:23.580 --> 17:26.580
and the writers can focus on that sizzling hot love triangle.

17:30.580 --> 17:32.580
Legolas also says this at the end.

17:32.580 --> 17:35.580
I cannot go back.

17:35.580 --> 17:40.580
Like, this Five-Army battle, or Angstrom, the dead mom, it's not clear,

17:40.580 --> 17:44.580
has tainted the mere idea of Mirkwood for him for some reason.

17:44.580 --> 17:46.580
And then Thranduil tells him to go find Aragorn.

17:46.580 --> 17:48.580
Find the Dúnedain.

17:49.580 --> 17:51.580
There's a young ranger amongst them.

17:51.580 --> 17:53.580
You should meet him.

17:53.580 --> 17:55.580
He's known in the wild as Strider.

17:56.580 --> 18:00.580
His true name, you must discover for yourself.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.580
Like, Aragorn's true name is a password for a clubhouse.

18:03.580 --> 18:07.580
Also, Aragorn is like, what, ten during the Battle of Five Armies?

18:07.580 --> 18:09.580
I don't know, maybe Arathorn needs a babysitter.

18:09.580 --> 18:12.580
But much more prominent than this is the love triangle arc.

18:12.580 --> 18:16.580
From a character arc standpoint, this does nothing for either Legolas or for the narrative.

18:16.580 --> 18:20.580
This could have been better set up for his distaste for dwarves,

18:20.580 --> 18:22.580
as we saw in The Fellowship of the Ring.

18:22.580 --> 18:24.580
And my axe.

18:25.580 --> 18:32.580
Thranduil, I guess, empathically confirmed that Tauriel's love for Kili was real.

18:32.580 --> 18:34.580
Why does it hurt so much?

18:35.580 --> 18:37.580
Because it was real.

18:37.580 --> 18:40.580
And wow, the greatest love of all time is now legitimized,

18:40.580 --> 18:43.580
and Legolas looks on sadly, but sympathetically.

18:43.580 --> 18:46.580
Instead, the focus at the end is dead mom.

18:46.580 --> 18:50.580
He doesn't seem to care about Tauriel or the dwarves at all.

18:50.580 --> 18:54.580
Certainly doesn't play up that prejudice that he's going to have to work on in Lord of the Rings.

18:54.580 --> 18:57.580
Just this amorphous, mom-shaped angst.

18:57.580 --> 19:00.580
Legolas' arc in The Lord of the Rings is mostly tied to his friendship with Gimli.

19:00.580 --> 19:04.580
It isn't just about learning to undo their prejudices against each other,

19:04.580 --> 19:08.580
but also serves as a microcosm of everyone coming together to defeat Sauron.

19:08.580 --> 19:11.580
And they sail into the west together.

19:11.580 --> 19:14.580
I thought I'd die fighting side by side with the elf.

19:15.580 --> 19:17.580
What about side by side with a friend?

19:17.580 --> 19:19.580
This is real.

19:19.580 --> 19:22.580
But Legolas doesn't get it worst in terms of clumsy addition,

19:22.580 --> 19:24.580
made presumably at the behest of the studios.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.580
That honor goes to poor Tauriel.

19:27.580 --> 19:30.580
She's torn between an elf and a dwarf,

19:30.580 --> 19:34.580
so I suppose for Tauriel, size doesn't matter?

19:35.580 --> 19:38.580
Oh, Evangeline Lilly, I am so sorry.

19:45.580 --> 19:47.580
Uh-oh, we have a problem.

19:47.580 --> 19:50.580
Belladonna Took is the only named female character in The Hobbit,

19:50.580 --> 19:52.580
and she dead before the book even starts.

19:52.580 --> 19:54.580
So, what do?

19:54.580 --> 19:56.580
Hollywood doesn't like women because writing them is hard.

20:01.580 --> 20:03.580
But they like women because they have money.

20:03.580 --> 20:05.580
And there's this idea in some studios

20:05.580 --> 20:08.580
that women won't see your movie if there's no women.

20:08.580 --> 20:11.580
But women in movies need a justification for being women.

20:11.580 --> 20:13.580
Or they may as well be men, am I right?

20:13.580 --> 20:16.580
So, better give her a love interest or several.

20:16.580 --> 20:19.580
On the one hand, it's a bit unfair to compare this to The Lord of the Rings,

20:19.580 --> 20:22.580
where they didn't need to fabricate female characters out of whole cloth

20:22.580 --> 20:25.580
and instead just beefed up the parts that were already there.

20:25.580 --> 20:27.580
I am no math.

20:28.580 --> 20:31.580
But on the other hand, creating a character out of whole cloth

20:31.580 --> 20:34.580
does nothing, nothing, nothing to this narrative.

20:34.580 --> 20:37.580
Like, she doesn't help the dwarves escape.

20:37.580 --> 20:41.580
She saves Kili, I guess, from a problem that wasn't in the book,

20:41.580 --> 20:43.580
but he dies unceremoniously anyway,

20:43.580 --> 20:46.580
and she's sad, and it hurts so much.

20:46.580 --> 20:48.580
Why does it hurt so much?

20:48.580 --> 20:52.580
So, this brings up the question of what is worse,

20:52.580 --> 20:55.580
bad representation or no representation.

20:55.580 --> 20:57.580
We're gonna answer that question today.

20:57.580 --> 20:59.580
Just kidding, no we're not.

20:59.580 --> 21:02.580
According to popular belief, this is not why these things get changed.

21:02.580 --> 21:04.580
It's not to make it more politically correct.

21:04.580 --> 21:07.580
It's a cynical move on the part of the studio to increase mass market appeal,

21:07.580 --> 21:10.580
one that I don't think was necessary to get lady butts in seats.

21:10.580 --> 21:14.580
Nor do I think it fixes the underlying issue of the way that Tolkien wrote women,

21:14.580 --> 21:16.580
or in the case of Hobbit, didn't.

21:16.580 --> 21:18.580
Fantasy in general has a women problem,

21:18.580 --> 21:20.580
because history is patriarchal,

21:20.580 --> 21:22.580
and since most fantasy is based on history,

21:22.580 --> 21:24.580
authors want to write patriarchal societies,

21:24.580 --> 21:29.580
but they don't really want to think or go into how or why these structures came to exist.

21:29.580 --> 21:32.580
You think your life is worth more than hers?

21:32.580 --> 21:34.580
On the one end, you have something like Skyrim,

21:34.580 --> 21:37.580
which is about as egalitarian as a fantasy world is going to get.

21:37.580 --> 21:40.580
There are, of course, the likes of Terry Goodkind and Piers Anthony,

21:40.580 --> 21:42.580
which I'm not gonna go into here.

21:42.580 --> 21:44.580
And then you have works like A Song of Ice and Fire,

21:44.580 --> 21:46.580
where the patriarchal aspects of the society

21:46.580 --> 21:49.580
are both acknowledged and integrated into the narrative consciously.

21:49.580 --> 21:52.580
And then, of course, the benign sexism of Tolkien,

21:52.580 --> 21:54.580
where women are fair maidens.

21:54.580 --> 21:56.580
Sometimes powerful maidens, like in the case of Galadriel,

21:56.580 --> 21:58.580
but we don't really get to see it,

21:58.580 --> 22:00.580
because, you know, she's gotta restrain that.

22:00.580 --> 22:02.580
Eowyn gets her badass moment of awesome,

22:02.580 --> 22:04.580
but when Faramir reads her a poem,

22:04.580 --> 22:06.580
she decides she's done with being a shield maiden

22:06.580 --> 22:07.580
and becomes a good waifu.

22:07.580 --> 22:09.580
But more common in recent fantasy,

22:09.580 --> 22:11.580
at least fantasy written by men,

22:11.580 --> 22:13.580
is the version where there's an implied patriarchal structure

22:13.580 --> 22:16.580
given the utter dearth of women in positions of power,

22:16.580 --> 22:18.580
but no one really talks about it.

22:19.580 --> 22:21.580
And that angle, the one where there's kind of like

22:21.580 --> 22:23.580
a Tolkien badass lady,

22:23.580 --> 22:25.580
that's kind of how I feel they went with

22:25.580 --> 22:27.580
Tariel's inclusion in these movies.

22:27.580 --> 22:29.580
And it's not just that she's there,

22:29.580 --> 22:31.580
it's that she feels so out of place.

22:31.580 --> 22:33.580
No one in universe ever points it out,

22:33.580 --> 22:35.580
because Tolkien didn't really care,

22:35.580 --> 22:37.580
but women have pretty strict gender roles in Middle-earth.

22:37.580 --> 22:39.580
Women don't do battle.

22:39.580 --> 22:41.580
That's why Eowyn stepping out of her lane

22:41.580 --> 22:42.580
was worth remarking upon.

22:42.580 --> 22:44.580
Arwen's redesign in the movies already makes her character

22:44.580 --> 22:46.580
a little bit schizophrenic.

22:46.580 --> 22:48.580
As far as she goes is taking Glorfindel's role,

22:48.580 --> 22:50.580
which again, in my opinion, was a good decision,

22:50.580 --> 22:53.580
but it also sets her up as kind of like a battle maiden.

22:56.580 --> 22:58.580
And they did originally shoot Arwen warrior princess

22:58.580 --> 23:00.580
at Helm's Deep, but then they cut that.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.580
Also a good choice in my opinion.

23:02.580 --> 23:04.580
Because that was what made Eowyn remarkable.

23:04.580 --> 23:06.580
She disguised herself as a man because she had to,

23:06.580 --> 23:09.580
because women don't do battle in Tolkien's universe.

23:16.580 --> 23:19.580
And the screams and the horror of battle take hold.

23:20.580 --> 23:23.580
Do you think he would stand and fight?

23:24.580 --> 23:27.580
So not only is shoehorning in this unnecessary character

23:27.580 --> 23:29.580
doing a disservice to the story,

23:29.580 --> 23:31.580
she does not mesh with the fabric of the universe.

23:31.580 --> 23:33.580
I do not think you would allow your son

23:33.580 --> 23:35.580
to pledge himself to a lowly sylvan elf.

23:35.580 --> 23:37.580
I don't know, maybe lowly sylvan elves

23:37.580 --> 23:39.580
train their women in the art of war or something.

23:39.580 --> 23:41.580
To be clear, my issue with all things Tauriel

23:41.580 --> 23:43.580
isn't because it's unfaithful to Tolkien,

23:43.580 --> 23:45.580
or because representation is bad.

23:45.580 --> 23:47.580
It's because it's a transparent and cynical move

23:47.580 --> 23:49.580
on the part of the studio.

23:49.580 --> 23:51.580
You create a female character that is completely

23:51.580 --> 23:53.580
out of place in her own universe for her to be

23:53.580 --> 23:55.580
the center of a love triangle that serves no purpose

23:55.580 --> 23:56.580
in this narrative.

23:56.580 --> 23:58.580
Not plot-wise, not thematically, nothing.

23:58.580 --> 24:00.580
Hell, the only female character that escapes

24:00.580 --> 24:03.580
the great love triangle in Ing is Galadriel.

24:03.580 --> 24:04.580
And even then...

24:04.580 --> 24:06.580
Come with me, my lady.

24:06.580 --> 24:08.580
Gandalf, I swear to Christ.

24:08.580 --> 24:11.580
In order to take this job, you have to promise me

24:11.580 --> 24:13.580
I will not be in a love triangle.

24:13.580 --> 24:15.580
I swear to God, this is what I said to them.

24:15.580 --> 24:17.580
And they said, we promise you, you won't be

24:17.580 --> 24:18.580
in a love triangle.

24:18.580 --> 24:21.580
Came back in 2012 for reshoots, and they were like,

24:21.580 --> 24:24.580
ah, the studio would really like to see,

24:24.580 --> 24:26.580
and I was like, here we go.

24:26.580 --> 24:29.580
Yep, the great love triangulation of Tauriel

24:29.580 --> 24:33.580
was a reshoot edition, requested by Warner Brothers.

24:33.580 --> 24:35.580
And all of this mess was added in reshoots,

24:35.580 --> 24:38.580
a year after principal photography had ended.

24:38.580 --> 24:40.580
So if this romance feels tacked on,

24:40.580 --> 24:42.580
it's because it is.

24:42.580 --> 24:45.580
And sure enough, I'm in another love triangle.

24:45.580 --> 24:48.580
Tauriel's relationship with Legolas doesn't make sense.

24:48.580 --> 24:50.580
Thranduil expects them to get married.

24:50.580 --> 24:52.580
He has grown very fond of you.

24:52.580 --> 24:54.580
But also kind of hates her.

24:54.580 --> 24:56.580
He would allow your son to pledge himself

24:56.580 --> 24:58.580
to a lowly sylvan elf.

24:58.580 --> 24:59.580
No.

24:59.580 --> 25:00.580
She has no reason to fall in love with Kili.

25:00.580 --> 25:02.580
There is no reason for these two to care about each other.

25:02.580 --> 25:04.580
Like, they couldn't even write in a bit

25:04.580 --> 25:06.580
about how he saves her from a spider

25:06.580 --> 25:07.580
at the beginning or something,

25:07.580 --> 25:09.580
or she saves him from a, I don't know,

25:09.580 --> 25:10.580
they had spiders.

25:10.580 --> 25:12.580
Studios say we need wombs.

25:12.580 --> 25:14.580
But what do you do with women in movie?

25:14.580 --> 25:15.580
I don't know.

25:15.580 --> 25:16.580
Love triangle when none of the characters

25:16.580 --> 25:18.580
even have a reason to like each other, I guess.

25:18.580 --> 25:20.580
Aren't you going to search me?

25:21.580 --> 25:23.580
I could have anything down my trousers.

25:24.580 --> 25:25.580
Or nothing.

25:25.580 --> 25:27.580
Oh, the burning passion.

25:32.580 --> 25:34.580
So we will probably never know exactly

25:34.580 --> 25:36.580
where filmmaker intent ended

25:36.580 --> 25:37.580
and studio mandate began.

25:37.580 --> 25:39.580
But a lot of the weakest aspects of the films,

25:39.580 --> 25:41.580
if not directly demanded by the studio,

25:41.580 --> 25:44.580
were at the very least encouraged.

25:44.580 --> 25:46.580
But the important lesson here is that

25:46.580 --> 25:48.580
all of these additions come at a price.

25:48.580 --> 25:49.580
And the price is what should have been

25:49.580 --> 25:51.580
the emotional core of these films.

25:51.580 --> 25:52.580
Bilbo, his journey,

25:52.580 --> 25:54.580
and his growing friendship with the dwarves,

25:54.580 --> 25:56.580
particularly Thorin.

25:56.580 --> 25:58.580
So speaking of callbacks to Lord of the Rings,

25:58.580 --> 26:00.580
Thorin, you notice that he doesn't really

26:00.580 --> 26:01.580
look like a dwarf?

26:01.580 --> 26:02.580
Gandalf.

26:02.580 --> 26:04.580
Thorin looks more like, well,

26:04.580 --> 26:06.580
Aragorn than he does Gimli.

26:06.580 --> 26:08.580
So both aesthetically and thematically

26:08.580 --> 26:11.580
Thorin is something of a callback to Aragorn

26:11.580 --> 26:13.580
since Thorin is the king what needs to

26:13.580 --> 26:15.580
reclaim his crown in this trilogy.

26:15.580 --> 26:16.580
In the pre-production phase,

26:16.580 --> 26:17.580
Jackson stated that he wanted the dwarves

26:17.580 --> 26:19.580
to be iconically dwarvish.

26:19.580 --> 26:20.580
Pete said to us,

26:20.580 --> 26:22.580
I want to be more bold.

26:22.580 --> 26:24.580
I want the dwarves to look like

26:24.580 --> 26:27.580
a race of dwarves from Middle-earth.

26:27.580 --> 26:28.580
But...

26:28.580 --> 26:30.580
Well, again, I'm not saying he was forced to do it.

26:30.580 --> 26:32.580
I'm just saying beards got shorn,

26:32.580 --> 26:33.580
Thorin looks like Aragorn,

26:33.580 --> 26:36.580
and Gimli, well, he looks like your anime boyfriend.

26:36.580 --> 26:37.580
The ones with the most screen time

26:37.580 --> 26:39.580
are less cartoonish and dwarvish

26:39.580 --> 26:42.580
and more Game of Thrones-y and mainstream.

26:42.580 --> 26:43.580
That said,

26:43.580 --> 26:46.580
there are elements of Thorin's Aragornification

26:46.580 --> 26:47.580
that do work.

26:47.580 --> 26:49.580
Thorin's narrative in the book is that

26:49.580 --> 26:50.580
he's a very important dwarf

26:50.580 --> 26:52.580
who suffers indignity after indignity,

26:52.580 --> 26:53.580
and that's funny.

26:53.580 --> 26:54.580
This

26:56.580 --> 26:57.580
is where he's introduced in the book.

26:57.580 --> 26:59.580
And the book even mentions how annoyed he is

26:59.580 --> 27:01.580
that very important dwarves such as himself

27:01.580 --> 27:03.580
gets relegated to the pile.

27:03.580 --> 27:05.580
So I think the filmmakers found a good way

27:05.580 --> 27:06.580
to bridge this.

27:06.580 --> 27:07.580
Don't put him in the dwarf pile,

27:07.580 --> 27:10.580
have the other dwarves hella respect his prowess in battle,

27:22.580 --> 27:24.580
and rather than making it a joke

27:24.580 --> 27:25.580
that this very important dwarf

27:25.580 --> 27:27.580
has to suffer indignity after indignity,

27:27.580 --> 27:29.580
have it be more about him regaining his honor

27:29.580 --> 27:31.580
by way of reclaiming his heritage.

27:31.580 --> 27:33.580
This is a good foundation for a character arc,

27:33.580 --> 27:35.580
but his arrogance is also a good basis

27:35.580 --> 27:37.580
for building a relationship with Bilbo.

27:52.580 --> 27:54.580
And I really like the dynamic they built

27:54.580 --> 27:55.580
between Thorin and Bilbo.

27:55.580 --> 27:57.580
And so does Ao3, by the way.

28:01.580 --> 28:03.580
The problem, as with most problems in this movie,

28:03.580 --> 28:05.580
is when the restructuring does a disservice to the story,

28:05.580 --> 28:07.580
or when they go so far with a good thing

28:07.580 --> 28:09.580
that they don't know when to stop,

28:09.580 --> 28:11.580
jumping that shark from compelling

28:11.580 --> 28:13.580
to confusing and or boring.

28:13.580 --> 28:14.580
As I mentioned in the last video,

28:14.580 --> 28:16.580
moving Thorin's change of heart moment with Bilbo

28:16.580 --> 28:18.580
to so early in the narrative was a mistake

28:19.580 --> 28:22.580
I've never been so wrong in all my life.

28:24.580 --> 28:26.580
Because there's no growth between Thorin and Bilbo

28:26.580 --> 28:27.580
in movie two.

28:27.580 --> 28:29.580
Thorin and Bilbo's relationship and its falling out

28:29.580 --> 28:31.580
is the emotional core of movie three.

28:31.580 --> 28:33.580
Diluting the movie with all the crap

28:33.580 --> 28:35.580
that we don't need and doesn't matter

28:35.580 --> 28:37.580
dilutes the emotional core.

28:37.580 --> 28:39.580
Another casualty of this is Thorin's death.

28:39.580 --> 28:43.580
Hell, Thorin dies before Tauriel's...

28:43.580 --> 28:45.580
Why does it hurt so much?

28:45.580 --> 28:47.580
...scene, and both scenes are given

28:47.580 --> 28:49.580
the same emotional weight with both the cinematography

28:49.580 --> 28:50.580
and the editing.

28:50.580 --> 28:52.580
One of these scenes features a relationship

28:52.580 --> 28:54.580
that has been built organically.

28:54.580 --> 28:56.580
The other features a woman crying over a man

28:56.580 --> 28:57.580
she has no reason to care about

28:57.580 --> 28:59.580
in a studio-mandated love triangle.

28:59.580 --> 29:01.580
And the latter is given the greater focus

29:01.580 --> 29:02.580
because it comes last.

29:02.580 --> 29:04.580
I'm not saying Keeley and his wingman, Feeley,

29:04.580 --> 29:06.580
don't deserve some sort of death scene,

29:06.580 --> 29:08.580
because yeah, we've spent a lot of time with them too.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.580
But that this happens...

29:10.580 --> 29:12.580
Why does it hurt so much?

29:13.580 --> 29:15.580
Because it was real.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.580
Immediately after this...

29:23.580 --> 29:25.580
...robs Thorin's death of its gravitas

29:25.580 --> 29:27.580
and pulls the rug out from under what was naturally

29:27.580 --> 29:29.580
a cathartic and good farewell

29:29.580 --> 29:31.580
that had actual bones in the story.

29:41.580 --> 29:43.580
And I hate to bring out the tinfoil hat again,

29:43.580 --> 29:45.580
but I cannot help but wonder if Warner Bros.

29:45.580 --> 29:47.580
looked at all the gay jokes that followed

29:47.580 --> 29:49.580
the Lord of the Rings trilogy...

29:49.580 --> 29:51.580
I'm glad you're with me.

29:53.580 --> 29:54.580
...and thought,

29:54.580 --> 29:56.580
we don't want that.

29:56.580 --> 29:57.580
No homo.

29:57.580 --> 29:59.580
It isn't difficult to tease out the stuff that worked,

29:59.580 --> 30:01.580
like Thorin and Bilbo,

30:01.580 --> 30:02.580
from the stuff that didn't,

30:02.580 --> 30:04.580
like Tauriel and Keeley, Gandalf and Galadriel.

30:04.580 --> 30:06.580
On the one side are things that were there

30:06.580 --> 30:08.580
in the source material and just needed to be fleshed out.

30:08.580 --> 30:10.580
The other is made up out of whole cloth

30:10.580 --> 30:12.580
tacked on because the studio wanted it

30:12.580 --> 30:14.580
or because the focus group said it tested well

30:14.580 --> 30:15.580
and it's less gay.

30:15.580 --> 30:16.580
So the emotional core,

30:16.580 --> 30:18.580
especially between Bilbo and the dwarves,

30:18.580 --> 30:20.580
the most important aspect of the films,

30:20.580 --> 30:21.580
suffers.

30:21.580 --> 30:23.580
In this movie, this is our fellowship.

30:23.580 --> 30:25.580
And they start out great.

30:25.580 --> 30:27.580
The strongest point in all three movies

30:27.580 --> 30:29.580
is at the beginning when the dwarves show up.

30:38.580 --> 30:40.580
But as the movies progress,

30:41.580 --> 30:43.580
until movie three ends with Bilbo just...

30:43.580 --> 30:45.580
sneaking out.

30:45.580 --> 30:47.580
And the implication here is that

30:47.580 --> 30:49.580
the emotional core of the story

30:49.580 --> 30:51.580
doesn't really matter.

30:52.580 --> 30:54.580
Even though we were in the core cast,

30:54.580 --> 30:57.580
we really did feel at some point

30:57.580 --> 30:59.580
that we were actually becoming

30:59.580 --> 31:01.580
the world's highest paid extras.

31:01.580 --> 31:03.580
Whether it had to do with the fact that

31:03.580 --> 31:05.580
the studios had said,

31:05.580 --> 31:07.580
actually, they're all right,

31:07.580 --> 31:09.580
these dwarves, yes,

31:09.580 --> 31:11.580
but the real stories are the battle

31:11.580 --> 31:16.580
between Thorin and the evil orcs.

31:16.580 --> 31:19.580
It's the story of the relationship

31:19.580 --> 31:21.580
between Radagast and Gandalf

31:21.580 --> 31:23.580
and finding Galadriel again

31:23.580 --> 31:25.580
and getting her help.

31:25.580 --> 31:28.580
If that is what the studios were pushing for,

31:28.580 --> 31:30.580
then they certainly got what they wanted.

31:30.580 --> 31:32.580
What I think they missed out on was

31:32.580 --> 31:35.580
the heart that we started with.

31:36.580 --> 31:40.580
And we had that as a group of dwarves

31:40.580 --> 31:44.580
going with Gandalf and with our Hobbit

31:44.580 --> 31:48.580
to find our treasure.

31:48.580 --> 31:51.580
The treasure, like in the Maori language,

31:51.580 --> 31:54.580
taonga, has to do with the treasure

31:54.580 --> 31:56.580
of people, of history,

31:56.580 --> 31:59.580
and really of heritage.

31:59.580 --> 32:01.580
That's what we were after.

32:01.580 --> 32:03.580
That's what we as actors

32:03.580 --> 32:05.580
were driving towards.

32:05.580 --> 32:09.580
And that, I felt, gradually dissipated

32:09.580 --> 32:11.580
until at the end we just had

32:11.580 --> 32:15.580
a big punch-up with five massive armies

32:15.580 --> 32:18.580
driven by technology.

32:25.580 --> 32:26.580
There is a lot more to it,

32:26.580 --> 32:28.580
but in the case of The Hobbit,

32:28.580 --> 32:29.580
bad studio mandates seem to be

32:29.580 --> 32:31.580
the cornerstone of the discussion.

32:31.580 --> 32:33.580
No, I don't necessarily feel better

32:33.580 --> 32:35.580
about The Hobbit,

32:35.580 --> 32:37.580
but that doesn't mean that the legacy

32:37.580 --> 32:39.580
of The Hobbit has to be all or nothing.

32:39.580 --> 32:40.580
I mean, just look at what it's done

32:40.580 --> 32:42.580
for the people of New Zealand.

32:42.580 --> 32:44.580
Clearly, they're proud of their ties

32:44.580 --> 32:45.580
to Middle-earth.

32:45.580 --> 32:47.580
There are giant stone dwarves

32:47.580 --> 32:48.580
at the airport,

32:48.580 --> 32:50.580
and this well-kept-up movie set

32:50.580 --> 32:52.580
staffed with enthusiastic people

32:52.580 --> 32:54.580
happy to show you around.

32:54.580 --> 32:56.580
Maybe these films were deeply flawed

32:56.580 --> 32:58.580
and often disappointing,

32:58.580 --> 32:59.580
but they were important to the people

32:59.580 --> 33:00.580
of New Zealand.

33:00.580 --> 33:02.580
These are a simple folk

33:02.580 --> 33:03.580
just trying to get by

33:03.580 --> 33:05.580
in the global economy.

33:05.580 --> 33:08.580
So, even if I can't appreciate the films,

33:08.580 --> 33:11.580
I can appreciate their legacy.

33:14.580 --> 33:15.580
This was so much fun.

33:15.580 --> 33:16.580
Yeah.

33:16.580 --> 33:18.580
I think I can finally see

33:18.580 --> 33:19.580
that The Hobbit movies have done

33:19.580 --> 33:22.580
a great service to the country of New Zealand.

33:23.580 --> 33:25.580
In terms of legacy,

33:25.580 --> 33:27.580
what The Hobbit left behind

33:27.580 --> 33:29.580
is a little bit more complicated than that.

33:31.580 --> 33:33.580
I'm sorry, who are you?

33:33.580 --> 33:34.580
Hi, I'm Tom.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.580
I'm a writer for birth, movies, death,

33:36.580 --> 33:37.580
and a filmmaker.

33:37.580 --> 33:39.580
Just so you know,

33:39.580 --> 33:41.580
what The Hobbit actually did

33:41.580 --> 33:43.580
for New Zealand was...

33:43.580 --> 33:45.580
Well, it kind of fucked us.

33:55.580 --> 33:56.580
Oh.

33:56.580 --> 33:57.580
Oh.

33:57.580 --> 33:58.580
Thank you.

34:01.580 --> 34:02.580
Um...

34:02.580 --> 34:04.580
We've just been informed by the studio

34:04.580 --> 34:05.580
that this is actually going to be

34:05.580 --> 34:06.580
three videos now.
