0	7000	Oh my god.
30000	57800	So here we are. In Hobbiton. Well, the movie set fictionally known as Hobbiton. In New
57800	65840	Zealand, trying to recapture the lost magic of our childhoods. It comes easier to some
65840	74160	of us. I'm going on an adventure! Nella, you were 28 when that movie came out. Anyway.
74160	81920	This isn't so bad. I mean, it's a little exploitative, but you know, this is actually
81920	88040	kind of fun. This is pretty fun. This is actually a lot of fun. I don't think I've
88040	93920	reclaimed any lost innocence, but I am having fun. Still, I do have a bigger purpose in
93920	99480	coming here. Sure, yeah, we want to recapture that childhood magic. But first, before we
99480	104560	allow ourselves to really go down that road, since this is a movie set made by a production,
104560	114400	we need to talk about the production. We really need to figure out. Okay, let's go
114400	118520	back. Lord of the Rings movies come out, Jackson wins all of the Oscars, the movies make all
118520	122000	the money. Then the good times come to an end when Jackson and company decide that New
122000	125440	Line Cinema, the studio that bankrolled and distributed their Lord of the Rings films,
125440	129100	is holding out on them. So factor number one is Jackson's original lawsuit against New
129100	133820	Line Cinema in 2005. To keep this short, this results in Jackson being booted from all things
133860	138020	related to The Hobbit eventually turning into a feature film or several. A couple of years
138020	143100	pass and then in late 2007, Jackson and company settle out of court and he agrees to executive
143100	147020	produce The Hobbit movies. But Jackson does not want to direct The Hobbit films owing to his
147020	151060	commitments to Tintin and The Lovely Bones, although he does want to be involved along
151060	154860	with Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens in a producorial context. In Jackson's words,
154860	158980	he's already spent three three-hour movies in Middle-earth and that was enough for him. The
158980	163580	guy he wants to direct is Guillermo del Toro, who is fresh off the triumph of his Hellboy movies and
164060	169260	a critical darling, Pan's Labyrinth. Also around this time, New Line Cinema merges with Warner
169260	174500	Brothers in 2008. So in the grand tango of rights, this is how Warner Brothers acquired the rights to
174500	179620	all things The Lord of the Rings, but not the rights to The Hobbit. See, MGM has those. And
179620	185300	MGM has a problem. 3.7 billion of them in fact, which was around the amount of crippling debt
185300	189580	the studio had amassed around the time of the Warner Brothers New Line merger. Given this debt,
189580	194340	MGM could not finance or even co-finance a blockbuster project. So given that New Line
194340	197820	and Warner Brothers were very anxious to create what would inevitably be lucrative movies based
197820	202980	on The Hobbit, MGM and New Line brokered a right-sharing deal for two movies, both directed
202980	208980	by Guillermo del Toro. The year is 2009, pre-production is a go for del Toro's The Hobbit.
208980	217460	I am exploding with the desire of just showing everything. Del Toro was much more keen on The
217460	221500	Hobbit than he was for The Lord of the Rings. His vision was to make the films both visually and
221500	226300	tonally distinct from The Lord of the Rings, and to give them a more operatic, fairytale-like feel
226300	230860	in contrast to the more grounded tone and aesthetic of The Lord of the Rings. Del Toro seemed to want
230860	234980	to capture the whimsical spirit of the book. You don't have a committee. You don't have a group of
234980	241060	studio people telling you there should be a happy ending here and they should never go to see the
241060	247860	Spiders. Bjorn is not rating with this age group. But as we would find out later, that wasn't what
247860	253020	Jackson or the studio wanted. Del Toro lived in Wellington for 18 months working on pre-production
253020	258860	for The Hobbit before leaving the project in late 2009. And here, okay, here's where it starts to
258860	263580	get a little bit tinfoil hattie, but bear with me. After del Toro left, all parties involved cited
263580	268180	scheduling conflicts and claimed that it was all taking too long, and del Toro got impatient and
268180	273100	wanted to work on other things, so he left. But given how quickly The Hobbit went into production
273100	281380	after he left, to me that reads either as a partial truth or a mistruth. In 2012, Philip
281380	285100	O'Boyan stated that Peter Jackson had to step up and direct for it to start making sense in terms
285100	290660	of those financial models. But for del Toro, the issue feels emotionally fraught.
290660	299380	I have incredible heartache. I feel terrible about it. It's very hard, it's getting a little
299380	304700	easier to talk about it, but essentially it's like you've been recently widowed and everybody
304700	310980	asking you exactly how your wife died. Again, there may be partial truths to the idea that this was all
310980	315860	just taking too long, but this does not read to me of a guy who voluntarily left a project he'd
315860	321260	spent almost two years on because he was feeling impatient and wanted to fly free, little bird. Yeah,
321260	326540	it was taking a while, but if you've worked in film, you know that 18 months of pre-production
326540	332540	for a project this huge, it's not that much. There was none of this taking wonderful photographs in
332540	338340	front of racks of armour, completed a year before production as we did on Lord of the Rings. If you
338340	343300	think about that time, there was incredible planning. There were three and a half years
343460	347860	of pre-production before we rolled the cameras. And then there's the fact that when Jackson took
347860	352260	over, those 18 months of pre-production got completely scrapped. Jackson threw out everything
352260	355820	that del Toro had done, which speaks to me that there was something about del Toro's vision that
355820	360100	was fundamentally at odds with the movies that Jackson and the studio wanted to make. But here's
360100	365820	the thing, I don't think that the studio really knew what movies they wanted, just that they wanted
365820	369740	it to look and feel like the Lord of the Rings, because they aren't shy about the fact that no
369740	373100	department was given adequate time and there was effectively no pre-production.
373100	375380	Penny never got a chance to prep these movies.
375380	378300	You can't, I can't say that, but he didn't.
378300	384380	You now have to plan on the go. You're laying the tracks directly in front of the train,
384380	387860	and that chased us all the way to the end.
387860	392940	Question to me is why, if they've already wasted so much time and money on del Toro's
392940	397620	pre-production, why not give Jackson at least a few months? The best answer I've been able to
397620	402420	find is those financial models. Pre-production costs money, and Warner Brothers felt like they'd
402420	407700	wasted enough, so the decree was to get it done, do it now, or we will find someone who will.
407700	413420	At least that's what it seems like to me. New Zealand is a small country. Surely if I poke
413420	417940	around I can find someone who can tell me what happened on the set. Or better yet,
417940	419580	find someone who was actually there.
420580	428580	This was the day, the last day, that we were all, the core cast, were all together.
428580	437580	The Hobbit and the wizard with all the dwarves. And each one of us got one of these.
437580	448580	Yes, my name is John Callan, and I've worked in theatre, television, radio, film, since the early 70s.
448580	454580	In The Hobbit, I play one of the dwarves, and I played a character called Oin.
454580	456580	He said he's an expert!
456580	465580	As I say, we kicked off with tremendous enthusiasm, a real sense of brotherhood, camaraderie,
465580	473580	and everybody working together. There wasn't one toss-pot person in the core cast. We really
473580	483580	had a tremendous sense of brotherhood, of multiple different characters coming together
483580	489580	for a single and very important purpose. And there was a determination within the cast
489580	494580	that we would be a band of brothers, basically.
494580	501580	There is, I don't know whether all your viewers would know this, but it's a very common expression
501580	506580	that the film industry is run on the motto, hurry up and wait.
506580	513580	And there was more of that in this production than any other production I have worked on.
513580	520580	We'd go through make-up and costume, prosthetics, that kind of thing, get ready, and then wait,
520580	527580	and wait, and wait. And it so happened that for a number of people, and it wasn't just the
527580	532580	cast that also rans among us, they wouldn't be used.
532580	536580	And so at the end of the day, we'd been waiting all day, and nothing would have happened,
536580	540580	and we just went, oh, well, fine, at least I'm being paid, and the next day there'd be
540580	545580	a nice bottle of wine saying, oh, thank you for being so decent about this kind of thing.
545580	548580	And we were very happy to get those bottles of wine.
548580	556580	As it went on, the bottles of wine ceased, and the waiting got even longer.
556580	560580	There would be the schedule on the wall, and we would just put a little number up of
560580	565580	how many changes to this schedule there would be within this week or this month.
565580	572580	Then somebody would win a bottle of martini or something, that kind of nonsense.
572580	576580	The changes were incredible. Now, I'm not saying they weren't necessary,
576580	583580	but they may well have come out of the fact that there had initially been the intention
583580	590580	of using a director who had spent time prepping all this thing, and then Peter Jackson thought,
590580	596580	well, if Guillermo del Toro has moved on to do the other work that he needs to do,
596580	603580	I'll pick up the mantle. Other influences may have come from the studios.
607580	611580	It's hard not to feel for Jackson and company. With the original director gone,
611580	614580	Peter Jackson was put into this position where he had to do what the studio wanted.
614580	617580	He couldn't pass the job off to someone who was really hungry for it.
617580	622580	If he passed on directing, there was no reason for Warner Brothers to keep the production in New Zealand.
622580	626580	So, with no other director and no time, Jackson had to do it.
626580	629580	And he had to do it according to the time frame laid down by Warner Brothers.
629580	632580	And he was also forced to defend their decisions.
632580	635580	It meant that we had a second movie, like the middle movie, The Desolation of Shemelle,
635580	638580	where we could actually have a little bit more fun with it too.
638580	644580	Uh-huh. We may never know, but effectively the cost of making three movies instead of two was not a huge jump.
644580	649580	And there were more parties at play here than just New Line, Warner Brothers and MGM with their billions of debt.
649580	653580	There was producer Saul Santz, who also had a hand in the rights deal.
653580	656580	And guess who else came to the feast?
656580	659580	Yep, Harvey Weinstein is here too.
659580	662580	So where the Lord of the Rings had one studio bankrolling the films,
662580	667580	The Hobbit had five, either bankrolling or taking a cut.
667580	671580	Warner Brothers, parent company of New Line, MGM, which owned the rights to The Hobbit,
671580	675580	producer Saul Santz, who having nothing to do with the production, didn't take his cut,
675580	678580	and Harvey Weinstein, who reaped millions from The Hobbit movies.
678580	683580	But according to the deal he struck with Warner Brothers, only the first Hobbit movie.
683580	685580	No, he was not actively involved with the production,
685580	691580	but he did take a sizable cut from the first film due to a deal that he had struck with MGM in the long, long ago time.
691580	695580	So when you take into consideration all of these outside interests that had nothing to do with the actual production,
695580	700580	but who were owed cuts of the first film, but only the first film,
701580	706580	having three films instead of two doesn't seem like such a bad idea.
706580	709580	And that was only one influence the studio might have had.
709580	717580	They may, for instance, have wanted less of the story of the dwarves with The Hobbit,
717580	724580	and more the story of the punch-ups, the fights, you know, the battles per se.
726580	732580	The idea of having a love story in there, which wasn't in the book,
732580	736580	whether one thinks that was well thought out or not.
736580	738580	Aren't you going to search me?
740580	741580	I could have anything down my trousers.
743580	744580	Or nothing.
744580	750580	So as we set off making the first of what we thought was going to be two films,
750580	757580	there was a really strong bond with very different aspects to each of these characters.
757580	763580	As it went on, we kind of had the feeling that, in fact,
763580	767580	there were one or two people whose parts were going to grow,
767580	771580	because they were young and good-looking and feisty and all that kind of thing.
771580	774580	We got left behind a bit.
774580	782580	How much that was based on what was originally intended, I'm not sure,
782580	787580	because we didn't initially have complete scripts for three films,
787580	791580	because initially there were going to be only two films.
791580	797580	All I can tell you is that there was a definite feeling within the core cast
798580	806580	that Peter was, if you like, he wasn't the final arbiter.
806580	808580	One certainly gets that impression.
808580	811580	Just look at this thousand-yard stare.
816580	819580	Changes to increased marketability in movies are inevitable,
819580	821580	and no, of course they're not always evil,
821580	824580	but in the case of The Hobbit, they kind of build up.
824580	826580	Let's run through just a few.
827580	831580	The Hobbit
831580	835580	With The Hobbit, it seemed like Peej started to fall down the same technology hole
835580	838580	that swallowed the likes of James Cameron and George Lucas.
838580	843580	A big gimmick that the film was sold on was being shot in 48 frames per second 3D.
843580	846580	One consequence is that the models and matte paintings they used in The Lord of the Rings
846580	850580	looked like models and matte paintings in 48 frames per second 3D,
850580	853580	so there was a much heavier reliance on CGI.
853580	857580	They also couldn't use the forced perspective that worked so well in The Lord of the Rings.
857580	860580	The mileage of 48 frames per second varies by viewer.
860580	862580	Some people are more sensitive to it than others.
862580	865580	Some people like it, for some people it gives them a headache.
865580	870580	But where CGI is concerned, more frames means more render time and more computer power needed.
870580	875580	Part of the problem with the visual effects was the lack of time the CGI artists had for a lot of these shots.
875580	877580	Contrast how amazing Gollum looks,
878580	883580	and the melting gold on a dragon.
883580	885580	Yikes.
885580	889580	One of these scenes got the time and care it needed to look photorealistic, the other did not.
889580	894580	The real irony is that 3D 48 frames per second version only now exists in prints.
894580	895580	You can't see it anywhere.
895580	900580	If you watch The Hobbit on Blu-ray, you're watching it in 2398 frames per second, not 48.
900580	906580	I suspect this is also why we got uncanny valley Dian instead of Billy Connolly in makeup.
906580	910580	Dian even gets his own chapter in the appendices, and they pronounce it Dane for some reason.
910580	911580	Dane.
911580	912580	Dane.
912580	914580	This is Dane, Lord of the Iron Hills.
914580	920580	They never explain or even acknowledge the decision to put Dian CGI instead of a guy in makeup like the rest of the dwarves are.
920580	923580	Another marketability change, as we mentioned in the last video,
923580	928580	is the inclusion of a bunch of characters from The Lord of the Rings that have nothing to do with the plot as written in The Hobbit.
928580	932580	Galadriel, Saruman, Frodo, Legolas.
932580	939580	The arc they seem to be going for with Galadriel was that confronting Sauron and doing magic battle with him drained her,
939580	941580	and that's why she has to go to Lothlorien.
941580	945580	Her strength is failing. Take her to Lothlorien.
945580	950580	Which, I mean, okay. It's better than what they do with poor Legolas.
955580	960580	Legolas should have been a cameo, which was, like, the one thing Pirates of the Caribbean 5 did right.
960580	963580	Because it makes sense that Bilbo and the dwarves would have run into him in Mirkwood.
963580	967580	But because he was such a popular Rings character, they'd go ahead and bump him up to the main cast.
967580	971580	And it continues with another Legolas problem we saw throughout the Rings trilogy.
971580	974580	In Fellowship, he's just kind of, you know, cool and an archer.
974580	978580	And by the end of Return of the King, he's basically, like, Spider-Man.
982580	983580	In The Hobbit...
983580	984580	In The Hobbit...
989580	990580	Woof.
990580	994580	So let's ignore Super Legolas. Let's talk about his character arcs.
994580	996580	First, there is the mom.
996580	1000580	About halfway through the Battle of Five Armies, the movie drops this bomb on the audience.
1005580	1007580	Okay.
1007580	1010580	And during Legolas' last scene in the movie, we get this.
1014580	1015580	More than anyone.
1015580	1017580	Was that in dispute?
1017580	1021580	So at a point in history, Legolas' mom died fighting.
1021580	1022580	There is no grave.
1024580	1025580	No memory.
1025580	1029580	This somehow led to something of a falling out between Legolas and his father.
1029580	1031580	My father does not speak of it.
1031580	1034580	So what we get in the theatrical cut is a motivation with no consequence.
1034580	1038580	We get a cliche mom-dead, dad-mad, kid-sad situation,
1038580	1041580	in which the dead parent drives a separation between them,
1041580	1043580	so now they never have to really talk,
1043580	1046580	and the writers can focus on that sizzling hot love triangle.
1050580	1052580	Legolas also says this at the end.
1052580	1055580	I cannot go back.
1055580	1060580	Like, this Five-Army battle, or Angstrom, the dead mom, it's not clear,
1060580	1064580	has tainted the mere idea of Mirkwood for him for some reason.
1064580	1066580	And then Thranduil tells him to go find Aragorn.
1066580	1068580	Find the Dúnedain.
1069580	1071580	There's a young ranger amongst them.
1071580	1073580	You should meet him.
1073580	1075580	He's known in the wild as Strider.
1076580	1080580	His true name, you must discover for yourself.
1080580	1083580	Like, Aragorn's true name is a password for a clubhouse.
1083580	1087580	Also, Aragorn is like, what, ten during the Battle of Five Armies?
1087580	1089580	I don't know, maybe Arathorn needs a babysitter.
1089580	1092580	But much more prominent than this is the love triangle arc.
1092580	1096580	From a character arc standpoint, this does nothing for either Legolas or for the narrative.
1096580	1100580	This could have been better set up for his distaste for dwarves,
1100580	1102580	as we saw in The Fellowship of the Ring.
1102580	1104580	And my axe.
1105580	1112580	Thranduil, I guess, empathically confirmed that Tauriel's love for Kili was real.
1112580	1114580	Why does it hurt so much?
1115580	1117580	Because it was real.
1117580	1120580	And wow, the greatest love of all time is now legitimized,
1120580	1123580	and Legolas looks on sadly, but sympathetically.
1123580	1126580	Instead, the focus at the end is dead mom.
1126580	1130580	He doesn't seem to care about Tauriel or the dwarves at all.
1130580	1134580	Certainly doesn't play up that prejudice that he's going to have to work on in Lord of the Rings.
1134580	1137580	Just this amorphous, mom-shaped angst.
1137580	1140580	Legolas' arc in The Lord of the Rings is mostly tied to his friendship with Gimli.
1140580	1144580	It isn't just about learning to undo their prejudices against each other,
1144580	1148580	but also serves as a microcosm of everyone coming together to defeat Sauron.
1148580	1151580	And they sail into the west together.
1151580	1154580	I thought I'd die fighting side by side with the elf.
1155580	1157580	What about side by side with a friend?
1157580	1159580	This is real.
1159580	1162580	But Legolas doesn't get it worst in terms of clumsy addition,
1162580	1164580	made presumably at the behest of the studios.
1164580	1167580	That honor goes to poor Tauriel.
1167580	1170580	She's torn between an elf and a dwarf,
1170580	1174580	so I suppose for Tauriel, size doesn't matter?
1175580	1178580	Oh, Evangeline Lilly, I am so sorry.
1185580	1187580	Uh-oh, we have a problem.
1187580	1190580	Belladonna Took is the only named female character in The Hobbit,
1190580	1192580	and she dead before the book even starts.
1192580	1194580	So, what do?
1194580	1196580	Hollywood doesn't like women because writing them is hard.
1201580	1203580	But they like women because they have money.
1203580	1205580	And there's this idea in some studios
1205580	1208580	that women won't see your movie if there's no women.
1208580	1211580	But women in movies need a justification for being women.
1211580	1213580	Or they may as well be men, am I right?
1213580	1216580	So, better give her a love interest or several.
1216580	1219580	On the one hand, it's a bit unfair to compare this to The Lord of the Rings,
1219580	1222580	where they didn't need to fabricate female characters out of whole cloth
1222580	1225580	and instead just beefed up the parts that were already there.
1225580	1227580	I am no math.
1228580	1231580	But on the other hand, creating a character out of whole cloth
1231580	1234580	does nothing, nothing, nothing to this narrative.
1234580	1237580	Like, she doesn't help the dwarves escape.
1237580	1241580	She saves Kili, I guess, from a problem that wasn't in the book,
1241580	1243580	but he dies unceremoniously anyway,
1243580	1246580	and she's sad, and it hurts so much.
1246580	1248580	Why does it hurt so much?
1248580	1252580	So, this brings up the question of what is worse,
1252580	1255580	bad representation or no representation.
1255580	1257580	We're gonna answer that question today.
1257580	1259580	Just kidding, no we're not.
1259580	1262580	According to popular belief, this is not why these things get changed.
1262580	1264580	It's not to make it more politically correct.
1264580	1267580	It's a cynical move on the part of the studio to increase mass market appeal,
1267580	1270580	one that I don't think was necessary to get lady butts in seats.
1270580	1274580	Nor do I think it fixes the underlying issue of the way that Tolkien wrote women,
1274580	1276580	or in the case of Hobbit, didn't.
1276580	1278580	Fantasy in general has a women problem,
1278580	1280580	because history is patriarchal,
1280580	1282580	and since most fantasy is based on history,
1282580	1284580	authors want to write patriarchal societies,
1284580	1289580	but they don't really want to think or go into how or why these structures came to exist.
1289580	1292580	You think your life is worth more than hers?
1292580	1294580	On the one end, you have something like Skyrim,
1294580	1297580	which is about as egalitarian as a fantasy world is going to get.
1297580	1300580	There are, of course, the likes of Terry Goodkind and Piers Anthony,
1300580	1302580	which I'm not gonna go into here.
1302580	1304580	And then you have works like A Song of Ice and Fire,
1304580	1306580	where the patriarchal aspects of the society
1306580	1309580	are both acknowledged and integrated into the narrative consciously.
1309580	1312580	And then, of course, the benign sexism of Tolkien,
1312580	1314580	where women are fair maidens.
1314580	1316580	Sometimes powerful maidens, like in the case of Galadriel,
1316580	1318580	but we don't really get to see it,
1318580	1320580	because, you know, she's gotta restrain that.
1320580	1322580	Eowyn gets her badass moment of awesome,
1322580	1324580	but when Faramir reads her a poem,
1324580	1326580	she decides she's done with being a shield maiden
1326580	1327580	and becomes a good waifu.
1327580	1329580	But more common in recent fantasy,
1329580	1331580	at least fantasy written by men,
1331580	1333580	is the version where there's an implied patriarchal structure
1333580	1336580	given the utter dearth of women in positions of power,
1336580	1338580	but no one really talks about it.
1339580	1341580	And that angle, the one where there's kind of like
1341580	1343580	a Tolkien badass lady,
1343580	1345580	that's kind of how I feel they went with
1345580	1347580	Tariel's inclusion in these movies.
1347580	1349580	And it's not just that she's there,
1349580	1351580	it's that she feels so out of place.
1351580	1353580	No one in universe ever points it out,
1353580	1355580	because Tolkien didn't really care,
1355580	1357580	but women have pretty strict gender roles in Middle-earth.
1357580	1359580	Women don't do battle.
1359580	1361580	That's why Eowyn stepping out of her lane
1361580	1362580	was worth remarking upon.
1362580	1364580	Arwen's redesign in the movies already makes her character
1364580	1366580	a little bit schizophrenic.
1366580	1368580	As far as she goes is taking Glorfindel's role,
1368580	1370580	which again, in my opinion, was a good decision,
1370580	1373580	but it also sets her up as kind of like a battle maiden.
1376580	1378580	And they did originally shoot Arwen warrior princess
1378580	1380580	at Helm's Deep, but then they cut that.
1380580	1382580	Also a good choice in my opinion.
1382580	1384580	Because that was what made Eowyn remarkable.
1384580	1386580	She disguised herself as a man because she had to,
1386580	1389580	because women don't do battle in Tolkien's universe.
1396580	1399580	And the screams and the horror of battle take hold.
1400580	1403580	Do you think he would stand and fight?
1404580	1407580	So not only is shoehorning in this unnecessary character
1407580	1409580	doing a disservice to the story,
1409580	1411580	she does not mesh with the fabric of the universe.
1411580	1413580	I do not think you would allow your son
1413580	1415580	to pledge himself to a lowly sylvan elf.
1415580	1417580	I don't know, maybe lowly sylvan elves
1417580	1419580	train their women in the art of war or something.
1419580	1421580	To be clear, my issue with all things Tauriel
1421580	1423580	isn't because it's unfaithful to Tolkien,
1423580	1425580	or because representation is bad.
1425580	1427580	It's because it's a transparent and cynical move
1427580	1429580	on the part of the studio.
1429580	1431580	You create a female character that is completely
1431580	1433580	out of place in her own universe for her to be
1433580	1435580	the center of a love triangle that serves no purpose
1435580	1436580	in this narrative.
1436580	1438580	Not plot-wise, not thematically, nothing.
1438580	1440580	Hell, the only female character that escapes
1440580	1443580	the great love triangle in Ing is Galadriel.
1443580	1444580	And even then...
1444580	1446580	Come with me, my lady.
1446580	1448580	Gandalf, I swear to Christ.
1448580	1451580	In order to take this job, you have to promise me
1451580	1453580	I will not be in a love triangle.
1453580	1455580	I swear to God, this is what I said to them.
1455580	1457580	And they said, we promise you, you won't be
1457580	1458580	in a love triangle.
1458580	1461580	Came back in 2012 for reshoots, and they were like,
1461580	1464580	ah, the studio would really like to see,
1464580	1466580	and I was like, here we go.
1466580	1469580	Yep, the great love triangulation of Tauriel
1469580	1473580	was a reshoot edition, requested by Warner Brothers.
1473580	1475580	And all of this mess was added in reshoots,
1475580	1478580	a year after principal photography had ended.
1478580	1480580	So if this romance feels tacked on,
1480580	1482580	it's because it is.
1482580	1485580	And sure enough, I'm in another love triangle.
1485580	1488580	Tauriel's relationship with Legolas doesn't make sense.
1488580	1490580	Thranduil expects them to get married.
1490580	1492580	He has grown very fond of you.
1492580	1494580	But also kind of hates her.
1494580	1496580	He would allow your son to pledge himself
1496580	1498580	to a lowly sylvan elf.
1498580	1499580	No.
1499580	1500580	She has no reason to fall in love with Kili.
1500580	1502580	There is no reason for these two to care about each other.
1502580	1504580	Like, they couldn't even write in a bit
1504580	1506580	about how he saves her from a spider
1506580	1507580	at the beginning or something,
1507580	1509580	or she saves him from a, I don't know,
1509580	1510580	they had spiders.
1510580	1512580	Studios say we need wombs.
1512580	1514580	But what do you do with women in movie?
1514580	1515580	I don't know.
1515580	1516580	Love triangle when none of the characters
1516580	1518580	even have a reason to like each other, I guess.
1518580	1520580	Aren't you going to search me?
1521580	1523580	I could have anything down my trousers.
1524580	1525580	Or nothing.
1525580	1527580	Oh, the burning passion.
1532580	1534580	So we will probably never know exactly
1534580	1536580	where filmmaker intent ended
1536580	1537580	and studio mandate began.
1537580	1539580	But a lot of the weakest aspects of the films,
1539580	1541580	if not directly demanded by the studio,
1541580	1544580	were at the very least encouraged.
1544580	1546580	But the important lesson here is that
1546580	1548580	all of these additions come at a price.
1548580	1549580	And the price is what should have been
1549580	1551580	the emotional core of these films.
1551580	1552580	Bilbo, his journey,
1552580	1554580	and his growing friendship with the dwarves,
1554580	1556580	particularly Thorin.
1556580	1558580	So speaking of callbacks to Lord of the Rings,
1558580	1560580	Thorin, you notice that he doesn't really
1560580	1561580	look like a dwarf?
1561580	1562580	Gandalf.
1562580	1564580	Thorin looks more like, well,
1564580	1566580	Aragorn than he does Gimli.
1566580	1568580	So both aesthetically and thematically
1568580	1571580	Thorin is something of a callback to Aragorn
1571580	1573580	since Thorin is the king what needs to
1573580	1575580	reclaim his crown in this trilogy.
1575580	1576580	In the pre-production phase,
1576580	1577580	Jackson stated that he wanted the dwarves
1577580	1579580	to be iconically dwarvish.
1579580	1580580	Pete said to us,
1580580	1582580	I want to be more bold.
1582580	1584580	I want the dwarves to look like
1584580	1587580	a race of dwarves from Middle-earth.
1587580	1588580	But...
1588580	1590580	Well, again, I'm not saying he was forced to do it.
1590580	1592580	I'm just saying beards got shorn,
1592580	1593580	Thorin looks like Aragorn,
1593580	1596580	and Gimli, well, he looks like your anime boyfriend.
1596580	1597580	The ones with the most screen time
1597580	1599580	are less cartoonish and dwarvish
1599580	1602580	and more Game of Thrones-y and mainstream.
1602580	1603580	That said,
1603580	1606580	there are elements of Thorin's Aragornification
1606580	1607580	that do work.
1607580	1609580	Thorin's narrative in the book is that
1609580	1610580	he's a very important dwarf
1610580	1612580	who suffers indignity after indignity,
1612580	1613580	and that's funny.
1613580	1614580	This
1616580	1617580	is where he's introduced in the book.
1617580	1619580	And the book even mentions how annoyed he is
1619580	1621580	that very important dwarves such as himself
1621580	1623580	gets relegated to the pile.
1623580	1625580	So I think the filmmakers found a good way
1625580	1626580	to bridge this.
1626580	1627580	Don't put him in the dwarf pile,
1627580	1630580	have the other dwarves hella respect his prowess in battle,
1642580	1644580	and rather than making it a joke
1644580	1645580	that this very important dwarf
1645580	1647580	has to suffer indignity after indignity,
1647580	1649580	have it be more about him regaining his honor
1649580	1651580	by way of reclaiming his heritage.
1651580	1653580	This is a good foundation for a character arc,
1653580	1655580	but his arrogance is also a good basis
1655580	1657580	for building a relationship with Bilbo.
1672580	1674580	And I really like the dynamic they built
1674580	1675580	between Thorin and Bilbo.
1675580	1677580	And so does Ao3, by the way.
1681580	1683580	The problem, as with most problems in this movie,
1683580	1685580	is when the restructuring does a disservice to the story,
1685580	1687580	or when they go so far with a good thing
1687580	1689580	that they don't know when to stop,
1689580	1691580	jumping that shark from compelling
1691580	1693580	to confusing and or boring.
1693580	1694580	As I mentioned in the last video,
1694580	1696580	moving Thorin's change of heart moment with Bilbo
1696580	1698580	to so early in the narrative was a mistake
1699580	1702580	I've never been so wrong in all my life.
1704580	1706580	Because there's no growth between Thorin and Bilbo
1706580	1707580	in movie two.
1707580	1709580	Thorin and Bilbo's relationship and its falling out
1709580	1711580	is the emotional core of movie three.
1711580	1713580	Diluting the movie with all the crap
1713580	1715580	that we don't need and doesn't matter
1715580	1717580	dilutes the emotional core.
1717580	1719580	Another casualty of this is Thorin's death.
1719580	1723580	Hell, Thorin dies before Tauriel's...
1723580	1725580	Why does it hurt so much?
1725580	1727580	...scene, and both scenes are given
1727580	1729580	the same emotional weight with both the cinematography
1729580	1730580	and the editing.
1730580	1732580	One of these scenes features a relationship
1732580	1734580	that has been built organically.
1734580	1736580	The other features a woman crying over a man
1736580	1737580	she has no reason to care about
1737580	1739580	in a studio-mandated love triangle.
1739580	1741580	And the latter is given the greater focus
1741580	1742580	because it comes last.
1742580	1744580	I'm not saying Keeley and his wingman, Feeley,
1744580	1746580	don't deserve some sort of death scene,
1746580	1748580	because yeah, we've spent a lot of time with them too.
1748580	1750580	But that this happens...
1750580	1752580	Why does it hurt so much?
1753580	1755580	Because it was real.
1756580	1758580	Immediately after this...
1763580	1765580	...robs Thorin's death of its gravitas
1765580	1767580	and pulls the rug out from under what was naturally
1767580	1769580	a cathartic and good farewell
1769580	1771580	that had actual bones in the story.
1781580	1783580	And I hate to bring out the tinfoil hat again,
1783580	1785580	but I cannot help but wonder if Warner Bros.
1785580	1787580	looked at all the gay jokes that followed
1787580	1789580	the Lord of the Rings trilogy...
1789580	1791580	I'm glad you're with me.
1793580	1794580	...and thought,
1794580	1796580	we don't want that.
1796580	1797580	No homo.
1797580	1799580	It isn't difficult to tease out the stuff that worked,
1799580	1801580	like Thorin and Bilbo,
1801580	1802580	from the stuff that didn't,
1802580	1804580	like Tauriel and Keeley, Gandalf and Galadriel.
1804580	1806580	On the one side are things that were there
1806580	1808580	in the source material and just needed to be fleshed out.
1808580	1810580	The other is made up out of whole cloth
1810580	1812580	tacked on because the studio wanted it
1812580	1814580	or because the focus group said it tested well
1814580	1815580	and it's less gay.
1815580	1816580	So the emotional core,
1816580	1818580	especially between Bilbo and the dwarves,
1818580	1820580	the most important aspect of the films,
1820580	1821580	suffers.
1821580	1823580	In this movie, this is our fellowship.
1823580	1825580	And they start out great.
1825580	1827580	The strongest point in all three movies
1827580	1829580	is at the beginning when the dwarves show up.
1838580	1840580	But as the movies progress,
1841580	1843580	until movie three ends with Bilbo just...
1843580	1845580	sneaking out.
1845580	1847580	And the implication here is that
1847580	1849580	the emotional core of the story
1849580	1851580	doesn't really matter.
1852580	1854580	Even though we were in the core cast,
1854580	1857580	we really did feel at some point
1857580	1859580	that we were actually becoming
1859580	1861580	the world's highest paid extras.
1861580	1863580	Whether it had to do with the fact that
1863580	1865580	the studios had said,
1865580	1867580	actually, they're all right,
1867580	1869580	these dwarves, yes,
1869580	1871580	but the real stories are the battle
1871580	1876580	between Thorin and the evil orcs.
1876580	1879580	It's the story of the relationship
1879580	1881580	between Radagast and Gandalf
1881580	1883580	and finding Galadriel again
1883580	1885580	and getting her help.
1885580	1888580	If that is what the studios were pushing for,
1888580	1890580	then they certainly got what they wanted.
1890580	1892580	What I think they missed out on was
1892580	1895580	the heart that we started with.
1896580	1900580	And we had that as a group of dwarves
1900580	1904580	going with Gandalf and with our Hobbit
1904580	1908580	to find our treasure.
1908580	1911580	The treasure, like in the Maori language,
1911580	1914580	taonga, has to do with the treasure
1914580	1916580	of people, of history,
1916580	1919580	and really of heritage.
1919580	1921580	That's what we were after.
1921580	1923580	That's what we as actors
1923580	1925580	were driving towards.
1925580	1929580	And that, I felt, gradually dissipated
1929580	1931580	until at the end we just had
1931580	1935580	a big punch-up with five massive armies
1935580	1938580	driven by technology.
1945580	1946580	There is a lot more to it,
1946580	1948580	but in the case of The Hobbit,
1948580	1949580	bad studio mandates seem to be
1949580	1951580	the cornerstone of the discussion.
1951580	1953580	No, I don't necessarily feel better
1953580	1955580	about The Hobbit,
1955580	1957580	but that doesn't mean that the legacy
1957580	1959580	of The Hobbit has to be all or nothing.
1959580	1960580	I mean, just look at what it's done
1960580	1962580	for the people of New Zealand.
1962580	1964580	Clearly, they're proud of their ties
1964580	1965580	to Middle-earth.
1965580	1967580	There are giant stone dwarves
1967580	1968580	at the airport,
1968580	1970580	and this well-kept-up movie set
1970580	1972580	staffed with enthusiastic people
1972580	1974580	happy to show you around.
1974580	1976580	Maybe these films were deeply flawed
1976580	1978580	and often disappointing,
1978580	1979580	but they were important to the people
1979580	1980580	of New Zealand.
1980580	1982580	These are a simple folk
1982580	1983580	just trying to get by
1983580	1985580	in the global economy.
1985580	1988580	So, even if I can't appreciate the films,
1988580	1991580	I can appreciate their legacy.
1994580	1995580	This was so much fun.
1995580	1996580	Yeah.
1996580	1998580	I think I can finally see
1998580	1999580	that The Hobbit movies have done
1999580	2002580	a great service to the country of New Zealand.
2003580	2005580	In terms of legacy,
2005580	2007580	what The Hobbit left behind
2007580	2009580	is a little bit more complicated than that.
2011580	2013580	I'm sorry, who are you?
2013580	2014580	Hi, I'm Tom.
2014580	2016580	I'm a writer for birth, movies, death,
2016580	2017580	and a filmmaker.
2017580	2019580	Just so you know,
2019580	2021580	what The Hobbit actually did
2021580	2023580	for New Zealand was...
2023580	2025580	Well, it kind of fucked us.
2035580	2036580	Oh.
2036580	2037580	Oh.
2037580	2038580	Thank you.
2041580	2042580	Um...
2042580	2044580	We've just been informed by the studio
2044580	2045580	that this is actually going to be
2045580	2046580	three videos now.
