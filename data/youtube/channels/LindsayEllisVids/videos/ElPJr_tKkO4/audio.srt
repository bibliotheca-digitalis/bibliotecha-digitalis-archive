1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Oh my god.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:57,800
So here we are. In Hobbiton. Well, the movie set fictionally known as Hobbiton. In New

3
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:05,840
Zealand, trying to recapture the lost magic of our childhoods. It comes easier to some

4
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:14,160
of us. I'm going on an adventure! Nella, you were 28 when that movie came out. Anyway.

5
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:21,920
This isn't so bad. I mean, it's a little exploitative, but you know, this is actually

6
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,040
kind of fun. This is pretty fun. This is actually a lot of fun. I don't think I've

7
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,920
reclaimed any lost innocence, but I am having fun. Still, I do have a bigger purpose in

8
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,480
coming here. Sure, yeah, we want to recapture that childhood magic. But first, before we

9
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,560
allow ourselves to really go down that road, since this is a movie set made by a production,

10
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:54,400
we need to talk about the production. We really need to figure out. Okay, let's go

11
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,520
back. Lord of the Rings movies come out, Jackson wins all of the Oscars, the movies make all

12
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,000
the money. Then the good times come to an end when Jackson and company decide that New

13
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,440
Line Cinema, the studio that bankrolled and distributed their Lord of the Rings films,

14
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,100
is holding out on them. So factor number one is Jackson's original lawsuit against New

15
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,820
Line Cinema in 2005. To keep this short, this results in Jackson being booted from all things

16
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,020
related to The Hobbit eventually turning into a feature film or several. A couple of years

17
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:23,100
pass and then in late 2007, Jackson and company settle out of court and he agrees to executive

18
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,020
produce The Hobbit movies. But Jackson does not want to direct The Hobbit films owing to his

19
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,060
commitments to Tintin and The Lovely Bones, although he does want to be involved along

20
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,860
with Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens in a producorial context. In Jackson's words,

21
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,980
he's already spent three three-hour movies in Middle-earth and that was enough for him. The

22
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,580
guy he wants to direct is Guillermo del Toro, who is fresh off the triumph of his Hellboy movies and

23
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:49,260
a critical darling, Pan's Labyrinth. Also around this time, New Line Cinema merges with Warner

24
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,500
Brothers in 2008. So in the grand tango of rights, this is how Warner Brothers acquired the rights to

25
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,620
all things The Lord of the Rings, but not the rights to The Hobbit. See, MGM has those. And

26
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:05,300
MGM has a problem. 3.7 billion of them in fact, which was around the amount of crippling debt

27
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,580
the studio had amassed around the time of the Warner Brothers New Line merger. Given this debt,

28
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,340
MGM could not finance or even co-finance a blockbuster project. So given that New Line

29
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,820
and Warner Brothers were very anxious to create what would inevitably be lucrative movies based

30
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:22,980
on The Hobbit, MGM and New Line brokered a right-sharing deal for two movies, both directed

31
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:28,980
by Guillermo del Toro. The year is 2009, pre-production is a go for del Toro's The Hobbit.

32
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:37,460
I am exploding with the desire of just showing everything. Del Toro was much more keen on The

33
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,500
Hobbit than he was for The Lord of the Rings. His vision was to make the films both visually and

34
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,300
tonally distinct from The Lord of the Rings, and to give them a more operatic, fairytale-like feel

35
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,860
in contrast to the more grounded tone and aesthetic of The Lord of the Rings. Del Toro seemed to want

36
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,980
to capture the whimsical spirit of the book. You don't have a committee. You don't have a group of

37
00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:01,060
studio people telling you there should be a happy ending here and they should never go to see the

38
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:07,860
Spiders. Bjorn is not rating with this age group. But as we would find out later, that wasn't what

39
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,020
Jackson or the studio wanted. Del Toro lived in Wellington for 18 months working on pre-production

40
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:18,860
for The Hobbit before leaving the project in late 2009. And here, okay, here's where it starts to

41
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:23,580
get a little bit tinfoil hattie, but bear with me. After del Toro left, all parties involved cited

42
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,180
scheduling conflicts and claimed that it was all taking too long, and del Toro got impatient and

43
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:33,100
wanted to work on other things, so he left. But given how quickly The Hobbit went into production

44
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:41,380
after he left, to me that reads either as a partial truth or a mistruth. In 2012, Philip

45
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,100
O'Boyan stated that Peter Jackson had to step up and direct for it to start making sense in terms

46
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,660
of those financial models. But for del Toro, the issue feels emotionally fraught.

47
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:59,380
I have incredible heartache. I feel terrible about it. It's very hard, it's getting a little

48
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:04,700
easier to talk about it, but essentially it's like you've been recently widowed and everybody

49
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:10,980
asking you exactly how your wife died. Again, there may be partial truths to the idea that this was all

50
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,860
just taking too long, but this does not read to me of a guy who voluntarily left a project he'd

51
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:21,260
spent almost two years on because he was feeling impatient and wanted to fly free, little bird. Yeah,

52
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:26,540
it was taking a while, but if you've worked in film, you know that 18 months of pre-production

53
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:32,540
for a project this huge, it's not that much. There was none of this taking wonderful photographs in

54
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:38,340
front of racks of armour, completed a year before production as we did on Lord of the Rings. If you

55
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:43,300
think about that time, there was incredible planning. There were three and a half years

56
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,860
of pre-production before we rolled the cameras. And then there's the fact that when Jackson took

57
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,260
over, those 18 months of pre-production got completely scrapped. Jackson threw out everything

58
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,820
that del Toro had done, which speaks to me that there was something about del Toro's vision that

59
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:00,100
was fundamentally at odds with the movies that Jackson and the studio wanted to make. But here's

60
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:05,820
the thing, I don't think that the studio really knew what movies they wanted, just that they wanted

61
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,740
it to look and feel like the Lord of the Rings, because they aren't shy about the fact that no

62
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,100
department was given adequate time and there was effectively no pre-production.

63
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,380
Penny never got a chance to prep these movies.

64
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,300
You can't, I can't say that, but he didn't.

65
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:24,380
You now have to plan on the go. You're laying the tracks directly in front of the train,

66
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,860
and that chased us all the way to the end.

67
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,940
Question to me is why, if they've already wasted so much time and money on del Toro's

68
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,620
pre-production, why not give Jackson at least a few months? The best answer I've been able to

69
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,420
find is those financial models. Pre-production costs money, and Warner Brothers felt like they'd

70
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:47,700
wasted enough, so the decree was to get it done, do it now, or we will find someone who will.

71
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:53,420
At least that's what it seems like to me. New Zealand is a small country. Surely if I poke

72
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,940
around I can find someone who can tell me what happened on the set. Or better yet,

73
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,580
find someone who was actually there.

74
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:08,580
This was the day, the last day, that we were all, the core cast, were all together.

75
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:17,580
The Hobbit and the wizard with all the dwarves. And each one of us got one of these.

76
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:28,580
Yes, my name is John Callan, and I've worked in theatre, television, radio, film, since the early 70s.

77
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:34,580
In The Hobbit, I play one of the dwarves, and I played a character called Oin.

78
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,580
He said he's an expert!

79
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:45,580
As I say, we kicked off with tremendous enthusiasm, a real sense of brotherhood, camaraderie,

80
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:53,580
and everybody working together. There wasn't one toss-pot person in the core cast. We really

81
00:07:53,580 --> 00:08:03,580
had a tremendous sense of brotherhood, of multiple different characters coming together

82
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:09,580
for a single and very important purpose. And there was a determination within the cast

83
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:14,580
that we would be a band of brothers, basically.

84
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:21,580
There is, I don't know whether all your viewers would know this, but it's a very common expression

85
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:26,580
that the film industry is run on the motto, hurry up and wait.

86
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:33,580
And there was more of that in this production than any other production I have worked on.

87
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:40,580
We'd go through make-up and costume, prosthetics, that kind of thing, get ready, and then wait,

88
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:47,580
and wait, and wait. And it so happened that for a number of people, and it wasn't just the

89
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,580
cast that also rans among us, they wouldn't be used.

90
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,580
And so at the end of the day, we'd been waiting all day, and nothing would have happened,

91
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,580
and we just went, oh, well, fine, at least I'm being paid, and the next day there'd be

92
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:05,580
a nice bottle of wine saying, oh, thank you for being so decent about this kind of thing.

93
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,580
And we were very happy to get those bottles of wine.

94
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:16,580
As it went on, the bottles of wine ceased, and the waiting got even longer.

95
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,580
There would be the schedule on the wall, and we would just put a little number up of

96
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,580
how many changes to this schedule there would be within this week or this month.

97
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:32,580
Then somebody would win a bottle of martini or something, that kind of nonsense.

98
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,580
The changes were incredible. Now, I'm not saying they weren't necessary,

99
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:43,580
but they may well have come out of the fact that there had initially been the intention

100
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:50,580
of using a director who had spent time prepping all this thing, and then Peter Jackson thought,

101
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:56,580
well, if Guillermo del Toro has moved on to do the other work that he needs to do,

102
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:03,580
I'll pick up the mantle. Other influences may have come from the studios.

103
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,580
It's hard not to feel for Jackson and company. With the original director gone,

104
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,580
Peter Jackson was put into this position where he had to do what the studio wanted.

105
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,580
He couldn't pass the job off to someone who was really hungry for it.

106
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,580
If he passed on directing, there was no reason for Warner Brothers to keep the production in New Zealand.

107
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,580
So, with no other director and no time, Jackson had to do it.

108
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,580
And he had to do it according to the time frame laid down by Warner Brothers.

109
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,580
And he was also forced to defend their decisions.

110
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,580
It meant that we had a second movie, like the middle movie, The Desolation of Shemelle,

111
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,580
where we could actually have a little bit more fun with it too.

112
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:44,580
Uh-huh. We may never know, but effectively the cost of making three movies instead of two was not a huge jump.

113
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:49,580
And there were more parties at play here than just New Line, Warner Brothers and MGM with their billions of debt.

114
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,580
There was producer Saul Santz, who also had a hand in the rights deal.

115
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,580
And guess who else came to the feast?

116
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,580
Yep, Harvey Weinstein is here too.

117
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,580
So where the Lord of the Rings had one studio bankrolling the films,

118
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:07,580
The Hobbit had five, either bankrolling or taking a cut.

119
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,580
Warner Brothers, parent company of New Line, MGM, which owned the rights to The Hobbit,

120
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,580
producer Saul Santz, who having nothing to do with the production, didn't take his cut,

121
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,580
and Harvey Weinstein, who reaped millions from The Hobbit movies.

122
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:23,580
But according to the deal he struck with Warner Brothers, only the first Hobbit movie.

123
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,580
No, he was not actively involved with the production,

124
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:31,580
but he did take a sizable cut from the first film due to a deal that he had struck with MGM in the long, long ago time.

125
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,580
So when you take into consideration all of these outside interests that had nothing to do with the actual production,

126
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,580
but who were owed cuts of the first film, but only the first film,

127
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:46,580
having three films instead of two doesn't seem like such a bad idea.

128
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,580
And that was only one influence the studio might have had.

129
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:57,580
They may, for instance, have wanted less of the story of the dwarves with The Hobbit,

130
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:04,580
and more the story of the punch-ups, the fights, you know, the battles per se.

131
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:12,580
The idea of having a love story in there, which wasn't in the book,

132
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,580
whether one thinks that was well thought out or not.

133
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,580
Aren't you going to search me?

134
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,580
I could have anything down my trousers.

135
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,580
Or nothing.

136
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:30,580
So as we set off making the first of what we thought was going to be two films,

137
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:37,580
there was a really strong bond with very different aspects to each of these characters.

138
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:43,580
As it went on, we kind of had the feeling that, in fact,

139
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:47,580
there were one or two people whose parts were going to grow,

140
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,580
because they were young and good-looking and feisty and all that kind of thing.

141
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,580
We got left behind a bit.

142
00:12:54,580 --> 00:13:02,580
How much that was based on what was originally intended, I'm not sure,

143
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:07,580
because we didn't initially have complete scripts for three films,

144
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,580
because initially there were going to be only two films.

145
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:17,580
All I can tell you is that there was a definite feeling within the core cast

146
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:26,580
that Peter was, if you like, he wasn't the final arbiter.

147
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,580
One certainly gets that impression.

148
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,580
Just look at this thousand-yard stare.

149
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,580
Changes to increased marketability in movies are inevitable,

150
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,580
and no, of course they're not always evil,

151
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,580
but in the case of The Hobbit, they kind of build up.

152
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,580
Let's run through just a few.

153
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,580
The Hobbit

154
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,580
With The Hobbit, it seemed like Peej started to fall down the same technology hole

155
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,580
that swallowed the likes of James Cameron and George Lucas.

156
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:03,580
A big gimmick that the film was sold on was being shot in 48 frames per second 3D.

157
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,580
One consequence is that the models and matte paintings they used in The Lord of the Rings

158
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,580
looked like models and matte paintings in 48 frames per second 3D,

159
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,580
so there was a much heavier reliance on CGI.

160
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:17,580
They also couldn't use the forced perspective that worked so well in The Lord of the Rings.

161
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,580
The mileage of 48 frames per second varies by viewer.

162
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,580
Some people are more sensitive to it than others.

163
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,580
Some people like it, for some people it gives them a headache.

164
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:30,580
But where CGI is concerned, more frames means more render time and more computer power needed.

165
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,580
Part of the problem with the visual effects was the lack of time the CGI artists had for a lot of these shots.

166
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,580
Contrast how amazing Gollum looks,

167
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:43,580
and the melting gold on a dragon.

168
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,580
Yikes.

169
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:49,580
One of these scenes got the time and care it needed to look photorealistic, the other did not.

170
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:54,580
The real irony is that 3D 48 frames per second version only now exists in prints.

171
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,580
You can't see it anywhere.

172
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:00,580
If you watch The Hobbit on Blu-ray, you're watching it in 2398 frames per second, not 48.

173
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:06,580
I suspect this is also why we got uncanny valley Dian instead of Billy Connolly in makeup.

174
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,580
Dian even gets his own chapter in the appendices, and they pronounce it Dane for some reason.

175
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,580
Dane.

176
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,580
Dane.

177
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,580
This is Dane, Lord of the Iron Hills.

178
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:20,580
They never explain or even acknowledge the decision to put Dian CGI instead of a guy in makeup like the rest of the dwarves are.

179
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,580
Another marketability change, as we mentioned in the last video,

180
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:28,580
is the inclusion of a bunch of characters from The Lord of the Rings that have nothing to do with the plot as written in The Hobbit.

181
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,580
Galadriel, Saruman, Frodo, Legolas.

182
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:39,580
The arc they seem to be going for with Galadriel was that confronting Sauron and doing magic battle with him drained her,

183
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,580
and that's why she has to go to Lothlorien.

184
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,580
Her strength is failing. Take her to Lothlorien.

185
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:50,580
Which, I mean, okay. It's better than what they do with poor Legolas.

186
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:00,580
Legolas should have been a cameo, which was, like, the one thing Pirates of the Caribbean 5 did right.

187
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,580
Because it makes sense that Bilbo and the dwarves would have run into him in Mirkwood.

188
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,580
But because he was such a popular Rings character, they'd go ahead and bump him up to the main cast.

189
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,580
And it continues with another Legolas problem we saw throughout the Rings trilogy.

190
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,580
In Fellowship, he's just kind of, you know, cool and an archer.

191
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:18,580
And by the end of Return of the King, he's basically, like, Spider-Man.

192
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,580
In The Hobbit...

193
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,580
In The Hobbit...

194
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,580
Woof.

195
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:34,580
So let's ignore Super Legolas. Let's talk about his character arcs.

196
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,580
First, there is the mom.

197
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,580
About halfway through the Battle of Five Armies, the movie drops this bomb on the audience.

198
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,580
Okay.

199
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,580
And during Legolas' last scene in the movie, we get this.

200
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,580
More than anyone.

201
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,580
Was that in dispute?

202
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,580
So at a point in history, Legolas' mom died fighting.

203
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,580
There is no grave.

204
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,580
No memory.

205
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:09,580
This somehow led to something of a falling out between Legolas and his father.

206
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,580
My father does not speak of it.

207
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,580
So what we get in the theatrical cut is a motivation with no consequence.

208
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,580
We get a cliche mom-dead, dad-mad, kid-sad situation,

209
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,580
in which the dead parent drives a separation between them,

210
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,580
so now they never have to really talk,

211
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,580
and the writers can focus on that sizzling hot love triangle.

212
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,580
Legolas also says this at the end.

213
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,580
I cannot go back.

214
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:40,580
Like, this Five-Army battle, or Angstrom, the dead mom, it's not clear,

215
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,580
has tainted the mere idea of Mirkwood for him for some reason.

216
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,580
And then Thranduil tells him to go find Aragorn.

217
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,580
Find the Dúnedain.

218
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,580
There's a young ranger amongst them.

219
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,580
You should meet him.

220
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,580
He's known in the wild as Strider.

221
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,580
His true name, you must discover for yourself.

222
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,580
Like, Aragorn's true name is a password for a clubhouse.

223
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,580
Also, Aragorn is like, what, ten during the Battle of Five Armies?

224
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,580
I don't know, maybe Arathorn needs a babysitter.

225
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,580
But much more prominent than this is the love triangle arc.

226
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,580
From a character arc standpoint, this does nothing for either Legolas or for the narrative.

227
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,580
This could have been better set up for his distaste for dwarves,

228
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,580
as we saw in The Fellowship of the Ring.

229
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,580
And my axe.

230
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:32,580
Thranduil, I guess, empathically confirmed that Tauriel's love for Kili was real.

231
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,580
Why does it hurt so much?

232
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,580
Because it was real.

233
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,580
And wow, the greatest love of all time is now legitimized,

234
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,580
and Legolas looks on sadly, but sympathetically.

235
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,580
Instead, the focus at the end is dead mom.

236
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,580
He doesn't seem to care about Tauriel or the dwarves at all.

237
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,580
Certainly doesn't play up that prejudice that he's going to have to work on in Lord of the Rings.

238
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,580
Just this amorphous, mom-shaped angst.

239
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,580
Legolas' arc in The Lord of the Rings is mostly tied to his friendship with Gimli.

240
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:04,580
It isn't just about learning to undo their prejudices against each other,

241
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,580
but also serves as a microcosm of everyone coming together to defeat Sauron.

242
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,580
And they sail into the west together.

243
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,580
I thought I'd die fighting side by side with the elf.

244
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,580
What about side by side with a friend?

245
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,580
This is real.

246
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,580
But Legolas doesn't get it worst in terms of clumsy addition,

247
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,580
made presumably at the behest of the studios.

248
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,580
That honor goes to poor Tauriel.

249
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,580
She's torn between an elf and a dwarf,

250
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,580
so I suppose for Tauriel, size doesn't matter?

251
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,580
Oh, Evangeline Lilly, I am so sorry.

252
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,580
Uh-oh, we have a problem.

253
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,580
Belladonna Took is the only named female character in The Hobbit,

254
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,580
and she dead before the book even starts.

255
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,580
So, what do?

256
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,580
Hollywood doesn't like women because writing them is hard.

257
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,580
But they like women because they have money.

258
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,580
And there's this idea in some studios

259
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,580
that women won't see your movie if there's no women.

260
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,580
But women in movies need a justification for being women.

261
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,580
Or they may as well be men, am I right?

262
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,580
So, better give her a love interest or several.

263
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,580
On the one hand, it's a bit unfair to compare this to The Lord of the Rings,

264
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,580
where they didn't need to fabricate female characters out of whole cloth

265
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,580
and instead just beefed up the parts that were already there.

266
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,580
I am no math.

267
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,580
But on the other hand, creating a character out of whole cloth

268
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,580
does nothing, nothing, nothing to this narrative.

269
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,580
Like, she doesn't help the dwarves escape.

270
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:41,580
She saves Kili, I guess, from a problem that wasn't in the book,

271
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,580
but he dies unceremoniously anyway,

272
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,580
and she's sad, and it hurts so much.

273
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,580
Why does it hurt so much?

274
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,580
So, this brings up the question of what is worse,

275
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,580
bad representation or no representation.

276
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,580
We're gonna answer that question today.

277
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,580
Just kidding, no we're not.

278
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,580
According to popular belief, this is not why these things get changed.

279
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,580
It's not to make it more politically correct.

280
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,580
It's a cynical move on the part of the studio to increase mass market appeal,

281
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,580
one that I don't think was necessary to get lady butts in seats.

282
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,580
Nor do I think it fixes the underlying issue of the way that Tolkien wrote women,

283
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,580
or in the case of Hobbit, didn't.

284
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,580
Fantasy in general has a women problem,

285
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,580
because history is patriarchal,

286
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,580
and since most fantasy is based on history,

287
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,580
authors want to write patriarchal societies,

288
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:29,580
but they don't really want to think or go into how or why these structures came to exist.

289
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,580
You think your life is worth more than hers?

290
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,580
On the one end, you have something like Skyrim,

291
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,580
which is about as egalitarian as a fantasy world is going to get.

292
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,580
There are, of course, the likes of Terry Goodkind and Piers Anthony,

293
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,580
which I'm not gonna go into here.

294
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,580
And then you have works like A Song of Ice and Fire,

295
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,580
where the patriarchal aspects of the society

296
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,580
are both acknowledged and integrated into the narrative consciously.

297
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,580
And then, of course, the benign sexism of Tolkien,

298
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,580
where women are fair maidens.

299
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,580
Sometimes powerful maidens, like in the case of Galadriel,

300
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,580
but we don't really get to see it,

301
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,580
because, you know, she's gotta restrain that.

302
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,580
Eowyn gets her badass moment of awesome,

303
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,580
but when Faramir reads her a poem,

304
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,580
she decides she's done with being a shield maiden

305
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,580
and becomes a good waifu.

306
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,580
But more common in recent fantasy,

307
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,580
at least fantasy written by men,

308
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,580
is the version where there's an implied patriarchal structure

309
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,580
given the utter dearth of women in positions of power,

310
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,580
but no one really talks about it.

311
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,580
And that angle, the one where there's kind of like

312
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,580
a Tolkien badass lady,

313
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,580
that's kind of how I feel they went with

314
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,580
Tariel's inclusion in these movies.

315
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,580
And it's not just that she's there,

316
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,580
it's that she feels so out of place.

317
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,580
No one in universe ever points it out,

318
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,580
because Tolkien didn't really care,

319
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,580
but women have pretty strict gender roles in Middle-earth.

320
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,580
Women don't do battle.

321
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,580
That's why Eowyn stepping out of her lane

322
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,580
was worth remarking upon.

323
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,580
Arwen's redesign in the movies already makes her character

324
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,580
a little bit schizophrenic.

325
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,580
As far as she goes is taking Glorfindel's role,

326
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,580
which again, in my opinion, was a good decision,

327
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,580
but it also sets her up as kind of like a battle maiden.

328
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,580
And they did originally shoot Arwen warrior princess

329
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,580
at Helm's Deep, but then they cut that.

330
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,580
Also a good choice in my opinion.

331
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,580
Because that was what made Eowyn remarkable.

332
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,580
She disguised herself as a man because she had to,

333
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,580
because women don't do battle in Tolkien's universe.

334
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,580
And the screams and the horror of battle take hold.

335
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,580
Do you think he would stand and fight?

336
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,580
So not only is shoehorning in this unnecessary character

337
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,580
doing a disservice to the story,

338
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,580
she does not mesh with the fabric of the universe.

339
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,580
I do not think you would allow your son

340
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,580
to pledge himself to a lowly sylvan elf.

341
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,580
I don't know, maybe lowly sylvan elves

342
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,580
train their women in the art of war or something.

343
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,580
To be clear, my issue with all things Tauriel

344
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,580
isn't because it's unfaithful to Tolkien,

345
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,580
or because representation is bad.

346
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,580
It's because it's a transparent and cynical move

347
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,580
on the part of the studio.

348
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,580
You create a female character that is completely

349
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,580
out of place in her own universe for her to be

350
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,580
the center of a love triangle that serves no purpose

351
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,580
in this narrative.

352
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,580
Not plot-wise, not thematically, nothing.

353
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,580
Hell, the only female character that escapes

354
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,580
the great love triangle in Ing is Galadriel.

355
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,580
And even then...

356
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,580
Come with me, my lady.

357
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,580
Gandalf, I swear to Christ.

358
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,580
In order to take this job, you have to promise me

359
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,580
I will not be in a love triangle.

360
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,580
I swear to God, this is what I said to them.

361
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,580
And they said, we promise you, you won't be

362
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,580
in a love triangle.

363
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,580
Came back in 2012 for reshoots, and they were like,

364
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,580
ah, the studio would really like to see,

365
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,580
and I was like, here we go.

366
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,580
Yep, the great love triangulation of Tauriel

367
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,580
was a reshoot edition, requested by Warner Brothers.

368
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,580
And all of this mess was added in reshoots,

369
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,580
a year after principal photography had ended.

370
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,580
So if this romance feels tacked on,

371
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,580
it's because it is.

372
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,580
And sure enough, I'm in another love triangle.

373
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,580
Tauriel's relationship with Legolas doesn't make sense.

374
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,580
Thranduil expects them to get married.

375
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,580
He has grown very fond of you.

376
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,580
But also kind of hates her.

377
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,580
He would allow your son to pledge himself

378
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,580
to a lowly sylvan elf.

379
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,580
No.

380
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,580
She has no reason to fall in love with Kili.

381
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,580
There is no reason for these two to care about each other.

382
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,580
Like, they couldn't even write in a bit

383
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,580
about how he saves her from a spider

384
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,580
at the beginning or something,

385
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,580
or she saves him from a, I don't know,

386
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,580
they had spiders.

387
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,580
Studios say we need wombs.

388
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,580
But what do you do with women in movie?

389
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,580
I don't know.

390
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,580
Love triangle when none of the characters

391
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,580
even have a reason to like each other, I guess.

392
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,580
Aren't you going to search me?

393
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,580
I could have anything down my trousers.

394
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,580
Or nothing.

395
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,580
Oh, the burning passion.

396
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,580
So we will probably never know exactly

397
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,580
where filmmaker intent ended

398
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,580
and studio mandate began.

399
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,580
But a lot of the weakest aspects of the films,

400
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,580
if not directly demanded by the studio,

401
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,580
were at the very least encouraged.

402
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,580
But the important lesson here is that

403
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,580
all of these additions come at a price.

404
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,580
And the price is what should have been

405
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,580
the emotional core of these films.

406
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,580
Bilbo, his journey,

407
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,580
and his growing friendship with the dwarves,

408
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,580
particularly Thorin.

409
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,580
So speaking of callbacks to Lord of the Rings,

410
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,580
Thorin, you notice that he doesn't really

411
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,580
look like a dwarf?

412
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,580
Gandalf.

413
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,580
Thorin looks more like, well,

414
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,580
Aragorn than he does Gimli.

415
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,580
So both aesthetically and thematically

416
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,580
Thorin is something of a callback to Aragorn

417
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,580
since Thorin is the king what needs to

418
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,580
reclaim his crown in this trilogy.

419
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,580
In the pre-production phase,

420
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,580
Jackson stated that he wanted the dwarves

421
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,580
to be iconically dwarvish.

422
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,580
Pete said to us,

423
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,580
I want to be more bold.

424
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,580
I want the dwarves to look like

425
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,580
a race of dwarves from Middle-earth.

426
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,580
But...

427
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,580
Well, again, I'm not saying he was forced to do it.

428
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,580
I'm just saying beards got shorn,

429
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,580
Thorin looks like Aragorn,

430
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,580
and Gimli, well, he looks like your anime boyfriend.

431
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,580
The ones with the most screen time

432
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,580
are less cartoonish and dwarvish

433
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,580
and more Game of Thrones-y and mainstream.

434
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,580
That said,

435
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,580
there are elements of Thorin's Aragornification

436
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,580
that do work.

437
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,580
Thorin's narrative in the book is that

438
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,580
he's a very important dwarf

439
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,580
who suffers indignity after indignity,

440
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,580
and that's funny.

441
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,580
This

442
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,580
is where he's introduced in the book.

443
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,580
And the book even mentions how annoyed he is

444
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,580
that very important dwarves such as himself

445
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,580
gets relegated to the pile.

446
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,580
So I think the filmmakers found a good way

447
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,580
to bridge this.

448
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,580
Don't put him in the dwarf pile,

449
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:10,580
have the other dwarves hella respect his prowess in battle,

450
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,580
and rather than making it a joke

451
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,580
that this very important dwarf

452
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,580
has to suffer indignity after indignity,

453
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,580
have it be more about him regaining his honor

454
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,580
by way of reclaiming his heritage.

455
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,580
This is a good foundation for a character arc,

456
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,580
but his arrogance is also a good basis

457
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,580
for building a relationship with Bilbo.

458
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,580
And I really like the dynamic they built

459
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,580
between Thorin and Bilbo.

460
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,580
And so does Ao3, by the way.

461
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,580
The problem, as with most problems in this movie,

462
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,580
is when the restructuring does a disservice to the story,

463
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,580
or when they go so far with a good thing

464
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,580
that they don't know when to stop,

465
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,580
jumping that shark from compelling

466
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,580
to confusing and or boring.

467
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,580
As I mentioned in the last video,

468
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,580
moving Thorin's change of heart moment with Bilbo

469
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,580
to so early in the narrative was a mistake

470
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,580
I've never been so wrong in all my life.

471
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,580
Because there's no growth between Thorin and Bilbo

472
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,580
in movie two.

473
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,580
Thorin and Bilbo's relationship and its falling out

474
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,580
is the emotional core of movie three.

475
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,580
Diluting the movie with all the crap

476
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,580
that we don't need and doesn't matter

477
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,580
dilutes the emotional core.

478
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,580
Another casualty of this is Thorin's death.

479
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:43,580
Hell, Thorin dies before Tauriel's...

480
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,580
Why does it hurt so much?

481
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,580
...scene, and both scenes are given

482
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,580
the same emotional weight with both the cinematography

483
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,580
and the editing.

484
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,580
One of these scenes features a relationship

485
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,580
that has been built organically.

486
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,580
The other features a woman crying over a man

487
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,580
she has no reason to care about

488
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,580
in a studio-mandated love triangle.

489
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,580
And the latter is given the greater focus

490
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,580
because it comes last.

491
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,580
I'm not saying Keeley and his wingman, Feeley,

492
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,580
don't deserve some sort of death scene,

493
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,580
because yeah, we've spent a lot of time with them too.

494
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,580
But that this happens...

495
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,580
Why does it hurt so much?

496
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,580
Because it was real.

497
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,580
Immediately after this...

498
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,580
...robs Thorin's death of its gravitas

499
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,580
and pulls the rug out from under what was naturally

500
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,580
a cathartic and good farewell

501
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,580
that had actual bones in the story.

502
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,580
And I hate to bring out the tinfoil hat again,

503
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,580
but I cannot help but wonder if Warner Bros.

504
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,580
looked at all the gay jokes that followed

505
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,580
the Lord of the Rings trilogy...

506
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,580
I'm glad you're with me.

507
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,580
...and thought,

508
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,580
we don't want that.

509
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,580
No homo.

510
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,580
It isn't difficult to tease out the stuff that worked,

511
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,580
like Thorin and Bilbo,

512
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,580
from the stuff that didn't,

513
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,580
like Tauriel and Keeley, Gandalf and Galadriel.

514
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,580
On the one side are things that were there

515
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,580
in the source material and just needed to be fleshed out.

516
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,580
The other is made up out of whole cloth

517
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,580
tacked on because the studio wanted it

518
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,580
or because the focus group said it tested well

519
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,580
and it's less gay.

520
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,580
So the emotional core,

521
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,580
especially between Bilbo and the dwarves,

522
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,580
the most important aspect of the films,

523
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,580
suffers.

524
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,580
In this movie, this is our fellowship.

525
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,580
And they start out great.

526
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,580
The strongest point in all three movies

527
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,580
is at the beginning when the dwarves show up.

528
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,580
But as the movies progress,

529
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,580
until movie three ends with Bilbo just...

530
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,580
sneaking out.

531
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,580
And the implication here is that

532
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,580
the emotional core of the story

533
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,580
doesn't really matter.

534
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,580
Even though we were in the core cast,

535
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:57,580
we really did feel at some point

536
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,580
that we were actually becoming

537
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,580
the world's highest paid extras.

538
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,580
Whether it had to do with the fact that

539
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,580
the studios had said,

540
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,580
actually, they're all right,

541
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,580
these dwarves, yes,

542
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,580
but the real stories are the battle

543
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:16,580
between Thorin and the evil orcs.

544
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,580
It's the story of the relationship

545
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,580
between Radagast and Gandalf

546
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,580
and finding Galadriel again

547
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,580
and getting her help.

548
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,580
If that is what the studios were pushing for,

549
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,580
then they certainly got what they wanted.

550
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,580
What I think they missed out on was

551
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,580
the heart that we started with.

552
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,580
And we had that as a group of dwarves

553
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:44,580
going with Gandalf and with our Hobbit

554
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:48,580
to find our treasure.

555
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:51,580
The treasure, like in the Maori language,

556
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,580
taonga, has to do with the treasure

557
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,580
of people, of history,

558
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,580
and really of heritage.

559
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,580
That's what we were after.

560
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,580
That's what we as actors

561
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,580
were driving towards.

562
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:09,580
And that, I felt, gradually dissipated

563
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,580
until at the end we just had

564
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,580
a big punch-up with five massive armies

565
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:18,580
driven by technology.

566
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,580
There is a lot more to it,

567
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,580
but in the case of The Hobbit,

568
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,580
bad studio mandates seem to be

569
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,580
the cornerstone of the discussion.

570
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,580
No, I don't necessarily feel better

571
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,580
about The Hobbit,

572
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,580
but that doesn't mean that the legacy

573
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,580
of The Hobbit has to be all or nothing.

574
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,580
I mean, just look at what it's done

575
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,580
for the people of New Zealand.

576
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,580
Clearly, they're proud of their ties

577
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,580
to Middle-earth.

578
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,580
There are giant stone dwarves

579
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,580
at the airport,

580
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,580
and this well-kept-up movie set

581
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,580
staffed with enthusiastic people

582
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,580
happy to show you around.

583
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,580
Maybe these films were deeply flawed

584
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,580
and often disappointing,

585
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,580
but they were important to the people

586
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,580
of New Zealand.

587
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,580
These are a simple folk

588
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,580
just trying to get by

589
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,580
in the global economy.

590
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,580
So, even if I can't appreciate the films,

591
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,580
I can appreciate their legacy.

592
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,580
This was so much fun.

593
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,580
Yeah.

594
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,580
I think I can finally see

595
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,580
that The Hobbit movies have done

596
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,580
a great service to the country of New Zealand.

597
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,580
In terms of legacy,

598
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,580
what The Hobbit left behind

599
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,580
is a little bit more complicated than that.

600
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,580
I'm sorry, who are you?

601
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,580
Hi, I'm Tom.

602
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,580
I'm a writer for birth, movies, death,

603
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,580
and a filmmaker.

604
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,580
Just so you know,

605
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,580
what The Hobbit actually did

606
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,580
for New Zealand was...

607
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,580
Well, it kind of fucked us.

608
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,580
Oh.

609
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,580
Oh.

610
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,580
Thank you.

611
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,580
Um...

612
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,580
We've just been informed by the studio

613
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,580
that this is actually going to be

614
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,580
three videos now.
