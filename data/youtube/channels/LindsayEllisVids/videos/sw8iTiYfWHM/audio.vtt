00:00.000 --> 00:06.480
One week later, last week, we haven't moved from this spot.

00:06.480 --> 00:10.800
Oh, I really like this shirt. It's pink.

00:10.800 --> 00:13.600
This is my favorite sweater. It matches my booze.

00:17.600 --> 00:24.000
So this week we're going to talk about genre and appeal, and we are going to figure out what our book is about.

00:24.800 --> 00:36.000
What is the connecting thread between Fifty Shades of Twilight besides the really, really obvious thing?

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Life begins at man.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
Life begins at man.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
Deeply, deeply insecure women.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Deeply insecure women.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Abusive relationship.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
Yes, because it makes you a better person.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
And also because you have to save them somehow.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Yeah, you have to save them.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
You have to save them.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
You have to save them.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
Oh, and the biggie, the biggest biggie biggie, man withholds intimacy.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
That would make sense.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
The plot is trying to get what the man is withholding from you.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Fix him.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Life begins at man.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Martered.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Martered.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Martered.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Life begins at man.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
The original idea we came up with at Sexy Alien Book, at Twitter, was...

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
It's an alien at a high school, and he's kind of Invader Zim style there.

01:22.000 --> 01:29.000
But he's a good guy for some reason, but he's conflicted about something.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
He's a splinter group.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Like trying to be on the down low.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
Not wanting to be drawn into the intergalactic war that the humans don't even know about.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Yeah, there's an intergalactic war, and he's there for reconnaissance or something.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
He doesn't like us, but...

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
That's the thing, though.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
Right now, we've already given it more plot than Twilight or Fifty Shades.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Cry!

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Cry like you've never cried.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Before.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
To Stephanie Meyers' credit, oh my god.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Oh my god.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
Twilight is so much better written than Fifty Shades of Grey.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
It boggles my mind that so many people are reading Fifty Shades of Grey and going like,

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
yeah!

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
This is my fantasy, and if other people like it, great.

02:09.000 --> 02:16.000
I feel like, in a way, E.L. James is like the Michael Bay of writing, because she's

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
alright at drawing people in and driving the plot forward, and people keep coming back

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
and keep going like, yeah, this is legit.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
But it's just like, she's so mad.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Somebody driving the plot forward without having a plot, either.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
I apologize, Mr. Bay.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
That was way out of line.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
I am so sorry.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I think you've had enough.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
It's like, Michael Bay understands his craft.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
E.L. James does not.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
Fan fiction, most fan fiction, and there's definitely fan fiction that gets very plot-heavy,

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
but the majority of fan fiction is more focused on exploring the characters' relationships

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
with each other.

02:58.000 --> 03:09.000
So, therefore, they tend not to have plot, but they are very focused on how the characters

03:09.000 --> 03:15.000
interact, like the mistaken identities, the mistaken intentions, the fights, the tips.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.000
That's why Twilight is so fanficky, is because nothing happens until the lightâ€”

03:21.000 --> 03:27.000
And let it be said, we're not saying this to say that all fan fiction is bad.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
It's not plot-heavy. It is enjoyable.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
But there's clearly a demand for that.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
There is a demand for it.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Demand, for the most part, by women, for character-driven stuff that's not plot-heavy.

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
And that is part of what drives me crazy about Twilight, is the fact that it's not plot-heavy

03:42.000 --> 03:48.000
to the point where the plot, when it does show up, 600 pages in or so,

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
it's just so shoehorned in because it's like we need a conflict,

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
and the only conflict so far has been Edward being like,

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
No, I don't want it. Yes, I do. No, I don't. Yes, I do.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
Fan fiction, when it's really well done, can be very psychological

04:01.000 --> 04:09.000
and very revealing of people, which is why Fifty Shades, for example,

04:09.000 --> 04:16.000
would be an absolutely amazing exploration of how an abusive relationship is built up

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
if it wasn't painted in a romantic light.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Was it your fantasy? Because it's pornographic detail.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Oh, very much so.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
One person coming in and feeling worthless, and the other person saying,

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
I can give you, like, what worthless, you have all this worth, let me give it to you.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
By tying you up. Or by...

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
Tying you and beating you with my alien rod.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Because we're derivative.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
There's so much shame surrounding sex. If you're tied up, then you cannot,

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
and you're not responsible for your own actions, and then you can enjoy whatever's happening to you.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
So we could find a way to contrivedly make it a paranormal thing

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
and throw in the BDSM, because why not?

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
This week's assignment, what is our genre?

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
Are we going to go with young adult, Twilight, I'm afraid of sex, we never have any.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Or we get married before we do.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
Or are we going Fifty Shades, lots and lots and lots of sex.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
But then wondering if we're a whore for liking it.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
And you're not responsible for your own actions, and then you can enjoy whatever's happening to you.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
I feel like I should mention that Twilight with Aliens has been done.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
What's it called?

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
It was called Obsidian, and that's the big, I think that's the most popular one out there,

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
and it's literally, like, she moves to a new town, and this time it's in West Virginia,

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
and she, you know, meets this boy in school, and he's an alien, and...

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
Should this have a paranormal element to it?

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Should it be aliens? Should it be robots?

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
Would Twilight with robots? I haven't seen, like, I sometimes poke around the young adult.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
With androids?

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
You know, bitches love data. Why not?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Mm, bitches do love data. Fully functional.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
He's fully functional.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
What is our gimmick?

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Fifty Shades with robots?

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
That would be, like, this is already 5,000% more awesome than any of these bitches.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
The BDSM bots, and one of them grows a soul somehow.

06:18.000 --> 06:24.000
So are they, like, sex bots that were like, yeah, it could be like an AI with Jude Law,

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
and he's like a prostitute bot.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
This is already way too interesting for our project.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Tone it down!

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
Bring the thought level down, man.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
She goes to school, and there's a robot.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
He just wants to be a human. Or an alien.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
He just doesn't want to live in District 9 anymore.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
There's a prawn, but he's a sexy prawn.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
He wears a human suit he made out of skin.

06:52.000 --> 07:00.000
He can have, like, the Phantom. Like, he takes off his human mask, and she's like, you're beautiful.

07:01.000 --> 07:08.000
One of my favorite moments in history, of the history of film, is the moment Edward Cullen

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
is, like, standing in the sun with this, like, you know, sparkle.

07:14.000 --> 07:21.000
Like, he just went to the MAC store and, like, got sparkle-fied, and is looking at her, and says, with all sincerity,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
This is the skin of a killer, though.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
We're putting too much thought into this.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
Yeah, but I'm liking that he takes his mask off, and she's like, you're beautiful. Man, just man.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
So those are our assignments. What's our gimmick? What's our genre?

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
Young adult or, uh, sexy sci-fi with actual sex.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Or is it even sci-fi? Is it paranormal?

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
And of course, all this will be going up on what will become our idea wall.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Yes. Right behind us.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
So you see there's this glorious blank wall behind us.

07:50.000 --> 07:57.000
We need to fix this, so send us wall things so we will have ideas and fun romance-novel-y things

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
for us to put up on our wall.

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
Send us your ideas about gimmick genre, all sorts of fun observation.

08:04.000 --> 08:12.000
Tweet us at shayapocalypse, hashtag 50shadesofgreen, and of course you can follow us at shayapocalypse.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
Leave comments at shayapocalypse.com and on our Blip page at 50shadesofgreen.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
You can also follow sexyalienbook if you just want to laugh.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Because I will retweet anything I think is funny.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
That shit was hilarious.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
Be sure to tune in next week when we change our clothes and discuss characters.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
What's their appeal? Why do we love these ladies?

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Why do we identify with them?

08:33.000 --> 08:39.000
And what makes us so hot about our abusive male love interests?

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
And why is there always an ethnic third wheel?

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
We need an ethnic third wheel.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
We need an ethnic third wheel.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
But that's what's not been done.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Chinese? Too common?

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Indian.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Indian!

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
But the other-no we discussed the other kind of Indian!

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
In Twilight, he's Native American.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
In 50 Shades, he's Mexican.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
And so without-no.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
Like, no argument on this, he's gonna be from India.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
It's-sorry guys.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Sorry guys.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
It's India.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
It's India.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
It's India.
