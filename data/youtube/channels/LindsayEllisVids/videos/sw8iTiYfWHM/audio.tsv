0	6480	One week later, last week, we haven't moved from this spot.
6480	10800	Oh, I really like this shirt. It's pink.
10800	13600	This is my favorite sweater. It matches my booze.
17600	24000	So this week we're going to talk about genre and appeal, and we are going to figure out what our book is about.
24800	36000	What is the connecting thread between Fifty Shades of Twilight besides the really, really obvious thing?
36000	37000	Life begins at man.
37000	38000	Life begins at man.
38000	42000	Deeply, deeply insecure women.
42000	43000	Deeply insecure women.
43000	44000	Abusive relationship.
44000	47000	Yes, because it makes you a better person.
47000	49000	And also because you have to save them somehow.
49000	50000	Yeah, you have to save them.
50000	51000	You have to save them.
51000	52000	You have to save them.
52000	57000	Oh, and the biggie, the biggest biggie biggie, man withholds intimacy.
57000	58000	That would make sense.
58000	62000	The plot is trying to get what the man is withholding from you.
62000	64000	Fix him.
64000	65000	Life begins at man.
65000	66000	Martered.
66000	67000	Martered.
67000	68000	Martered.
68000	70000	Life begins at man.
70000	77000	The original idea we came up with at Sexy Alien Book, at Twitter, was...
77000	82000	It's an alien at a high school, and he's kind of Invader Zim style there.
82000	89000	But he's a good guy for some reason, but he's conflicted about something.
89000	91000	He's a splinter group.
91000	93000	Like trying to be on the down low.
93000	97000	Not wanting to be drawn into the intergalactic war that the humans don't even know about.
97000	100000	Yeah, there's an intergalactic war, and he's there for reconnaissance or something.
100000	102000	He doesn't like us, but...
102000	103000	That's the thing, though.
103000	107000	Right now, we've already given it more plot than Twilight or Fifty Shades.
107000	108000	Cry!
108000	110000	Cry like you've never cried.
110000	111000	Before.
111000	114000	To Stephanie Meyers' credit, oh my god.
114000	116000	Oh my god.
116000	120000	Twilight is so much better written than Fifty Shades of Grey.
120000	125000	It boggles my mind that so many people are reading Fifty Shades of Grey and going like,
125000	126000	yeah!
126000	129000	This is my fantasy, and if other people like it, great.
129000	136000	I feel like, in a way, E.L. James is like the Michael Bay of writing, because she's
136000	140000	alright at drawing people in and driving the plot forward, and people keep coming back
140000	143000	and keep going like, yeah, this is legit.
143000	145000	But it's just like, she's so mad.
145000	148000	Somebody driving the plot forward without having a plot, either.
148000	150000	I apologize, Mr. Bay.
150000	152000	That was way out of line.
152000	154000	I am so sorry.
154000	156000	I think you've had enough.
156000	160000	It's like, Michael Bay understands his craft.
160000	162000	E.L. James does not.
166000	170000	Fan fiction, most fan fiction, and there's definitely fan fiction that gets very plot-heavy,
170000	176000	but the majority of fan fiction is more focused on exploring the characters' relationships
176000	178000	with each other.
178000	189000	So, therefore, they tend not to have plot, but they are very focused on how the characters
189000	195000	interact, like the mistaken identities, the mistaken intentions, the fights, the tips.
195000	201000	That's why Twilight is so fanficky, is because nothing happens until the lightâ€”
201000	207000	And let it be said, we're not saying this to say that all fan fiction is bad.
207000	210000	It's not plot-heavy. It is enjoyable.
210000	212000	But there's clearly a demand for that.
212000	214000	There is a demand for it.
214000	217000	Demand, for the most part, by women, for character-driven stuff that's not plot-heavy.
217000	222000	And that is part of what drives me crazy about Twilight, is the fact that it's not plot-heavy
222000	228000	to the point where the plot, when it does show up, 600 pages in or so,
228000	232000	it's just so shoehorned in because it's like we need a conflict,
232000	235000	and the only conflict so far has been Edward being like,
235000	237000	No, I don't want it. Yes, I do. No, I don't. Yes, I do.
237000	241000	Fan fiction, when it's really well done, can be very psychological
241000	249000	and very revealing of people, which is why Fifty Shades, for example,
249000	256000	would be an absolutely amazing exploration of how an abusive relationship is built up
256000	259000	if it wasn't painted in a romantic light.
259000	261000	Was it your fantasy? Because it's pornographic detail.
261000	263000	Oh, very much so.
264000	267000	One person coming in and feeling worthless, and the other person saying,
267000	271000	I can give you, like, what worthless, you have all this worth, let me give it to you.
271000	274000	By tying you up. Or by...
274000	279000	Tying you and beating you with my alien rod.
279000	281000	Because we're derivative.
281000	285000	There's so much shame surrounding sex. If you're tied up, then you cannot,
285000	289000	and you're not responsible for your own actions, and then you can enjoy whatever's happening to you.
289000	294000	So we could find a way to contrivedly make it a paranormal thing
294000	297000	and throw in the BDSM, because why not?
299000	304000	This week's assignment, what is our genre?
304000	309000	Are we going to go with young adult, Twilight, I'm afraid of sex, we never have any.
309000	311000	Or we get married before we do.
311000	314000	Or are we going Fifty Shades, lots and lots and lots of sex.
314000	316000	But then wondering if we're a whore for liking it.
316000	320000	And you're not responsible for your own actions, and then you can enjoy whatever's happening to you.
320000	323000	I feel like I should mention that Twilight with Aliens has been done.
323000	324000	What's it called?
324000	329000	It was called Obsidian, and that's the big, I think that's the most popular one out there,
329000	333000	and it's literally, like, she moves to a new town, and this time it's in West Virginia,
333000	336000	and she, you know, meets this boy in school, and he's an alien, and...
336000	339000	Should this have a paranormal element to it?
339000	341000	Should it be aliens? Should it be robots?
341000	346000	Would Twilight with robots? I haven't seen, like, I sometimes poke around the young adult.
346000	348000	With androids?
355000	358000	You know, bitches love data. Why not?
358000	360000	Mm, bitches do love data. Fully functional.
360000	361000	He's fully functional.
363000	365000	What is our gimmick?
365000	367000	Fifty Shades with robots?
368000	373000	That would be, like, this is already 5,000% more awesome than any of these bitches.
375000	378000	The BDSM bots, and one of them grows a soul somehow.
378000	384000	So are they, like, sex bots that were like, yeah, it could be like an AI with Jude Law,
384000	387000	and he's like a prostitute bot.
387000	390000	This is already way too interesting for our project.
390000	392000	Tone it down!
392000	395000	Bring the thought level down, man.
395000	398000	She goes to school, and there's a robot.
399000	401000	He just wants to be a human. Or an alien.
401000	404000	He just doesn't want to live in District 9 anymore.
405000	408000	There's a prawn, but he's a sexy prawn.
409000	412000	He wears a human suit he made out of skin.
412000	420000	He can have, like, the Phantom. Like, he takes off his human mask, and she's like, you're beautiful.
421000	428000	One of my favorite moments in history, of the history of film, is the moment Edward Cullen
428000	434000	is, like, standing in the sun with this, like, you know, sparkle.
434000	441000	Like, he just went to the MAC store and, like, got sparkle-fied, and is looking at her, and says, with all sincerity,
441000	443000	This is the skin of a killer, though.
443000	445000	We're putting too much thought into this.
445000	449000	Yeah, but I'm liking that he takes his mask off, and she's like, you're beautiful. Man, just man.
450000	454000	So those are our assignments. What's our gimmick? What's our genre?
454000	459000	Young adult or, uh, sexy sci-fi with actual sex.
459000	461000	Or is it even sci-fi? Is it paranormal?
461000	466000	And of course, all this will be going up on what will become our idea wall.
466000	467000	Yes. Right behind us.
467000	470000	So you see there's this glorious blank wall behind us.
470000	477000	We need to fix this, so send us wall things so we will have ideas and fun romance-novel-y things
477000	479000	for us to put up on our wall.
479000	484000	Send us your ideas about gimmick genre, all sorts of fun observation.
484000	492000	Tweet us at shayapocalypse, hashtag 50shadesofgreen, and of course you can follow us at shayapocalypse.
492000	496000	Leave comments at shayapocalypse.com and on our Blip page at 50shadesofgreen.

500000	503000	Because I will retweet anything I think is funny.
503000	504000	That shit was hilarious.
504000	508000	Be sure to tune in next week when we change our clothes and discuss characters.
508000	511000	What's their appeal? Why do we love these ladies?
511000	513000	Why do we identify with them?
513000	519000	And what makes us so hot about our abusive male love interests?
519000	523000	And why is there always an ethnic third wheel?
523000	525000	We need an ethnic third wheel.
525000	527000	We need an ethnic third wheel.
527000	528000	But that's what's not been done.
528000	531000	Chinese? Too common?
531000	532000	Indian.
532000	533000	Indian!
533000	536000	But the other-no we discussed the other kind of Indian!
536000	539000	In Twilight, he's Native American.
539000	541000	In 50 Shades, he's Mexican.
541000	543000	And so without-no.
543000	546000	Like, no argument on this, he's gonna be from India.
546000	547000	It's-sorry guys.
547000	548000	Sorry guys.
548000	549000	It's India.
549000	550000	It's India.
550000	551000	It's India.
