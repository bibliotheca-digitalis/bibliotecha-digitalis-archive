1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
One week later, last week, we haven't moved from this spot.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,800
Oh, I really like this shirt. It's pink.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,600
This is my favorite sweater. It matches my booze.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,000
So this week we're going to talk about genre and appeal, and we are going to figure out what our book is about.

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:36,000
What is the connecting thread between Fifty Shades of Twilight besides the really, really obvious thing?

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Life begins at man.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Life begins at man.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Deeply, deeply insecure women.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Deeply insecure women.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Abusive relationship.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yes, because it makes you a better person.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And also because you have to save them somehow.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah, you have to save them.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You have to save them.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You have to save them.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Oh, and the biggie, the biggest biggie biggie, man withholds intimacy.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That would make sense.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The plot is trying to get what the man is withholding from you.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Fix him.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Life begins at man.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Martered.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Martered.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Martered.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Life begins at man.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The original idea we came up with at Sexy Alien Book, at Twitter, was...

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's an alien at a high school, and he's kind of Invader Zim style there.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But he's a good guy for some reason, but he's conflicted about something.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
He's a splinter group.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Like trying to be on the down low.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Not wanting to be drawn into the intergalactic war that the humans don't even know about.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah, there's an intergalactic war, and he's there for reconnaissance or something.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
He doesn't like us, but...

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's the thing, though.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Right now, we've already given it more plot than Twilight or Fifty Shades.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Cry!

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Cry like you've never cried.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Before.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
To Stephanie Meyers' credit, oh my god.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Oh my god.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Twilight is so much better written than Fifty Shades of Grey.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It boggles my mind that so many people are reading Fifty Shades of Grey and going like,

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
yeah!

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
This is my fantasy, and if other people like it, great.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I feel like, in a way, E.L. James is like the Michael Bay of writing, because she's

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
alright at drawing people in and driving the plot forward, and people keep coming back

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and keep going like, yeah, this is legit.

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But it's just like, she's so mad.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Somebody driving the plot forward without having a plot, either.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I apologize, Mr. Bay.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That was way out of line.

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I am so sorry.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I think you've had enough.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's like, Michael Bay understands his craft.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
E.L. James does not.

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Fan fiction, most fan fiction, and there's definitely fan fiction that gets very plot-heavy,

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
but the majority of fan fiction is more focused on exploring the characters' relationships

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
with each other.

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So, therefore, they tend not to have plot, but they are very focused on how the characters

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
interact, like the mistaken identities, the mistaken intentions, the fights, the tips.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That's why Twilight is so fanficky, is because nothing happens until the lightâ€”

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And let it be said, we're not saying this to say that all fan fiction is bad.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's not plot-heavy. It is enjoyable.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But there's clearly a demand for that.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
There is a demand for it.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Demand, for the most part, by women, for character-driven stuff that's not plot-heavy.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And that is part of what drives me crazy about Twilight, is the fact that it's not plot-heavy

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
to the point where the plot, when it does show up, 600 pages in or so,

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
it's just so shoehorned in because it's like we need a conflict,

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and the only conflict so far has been Edward being like,

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
No, I don't want it. Yes, I do. No, I don't. Yes, I do.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Fan fiction, when it's really well done, can be very psychological

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and very revealing of people, which is why Fifty Shades, for example,

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
would be an absolutely amazing exploration of how an abusive relationship is built up

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
if it wasn't painted in a romantic light.

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Was it your fantasy? Because it's pornographic detail.

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Oh, very much so.

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
One person coming in and feeling worthless, and the other person saying,

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I can give you, like, what worthless, you have all this worth, let me give it to you.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
By tying you up. Or by...

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Tying you and beating you with my alien rod.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Because we're derivative.

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
There's so much shame surrounding sex. If you're tied up, then you cannot,

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and you're not responsible for your own actions, and then you can enjoy whatever's happening to you.

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So we could find a way to contrivedly make it a paranormal thing

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and throw in the BDSM, because why not?

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
This week's assignment, what is our genre?

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Are we going to go with young adult, Twilight, I'm afraid of sex, we never have any.

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Or we get married before we do.

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Or are we going Fifty Shades, lots and lots and lots of sex.

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But then wondering if we're a whore for liking it.

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And you're not responsible for your own actions, and then you can enjoy whatever's happening to you.

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I feel like I should mention that Twilight with Aliens has been done.

93
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What's it called?

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It was called Obsidian, and that's the big, I think that's the most popular one out there,

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and it's literally, like, she moves to a new town, and this time it's in West Virginia,

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and she, you know, meets this boy in school, and he's an alien, and...

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Should this have a paranormal element to it?

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Should it be aliens? Should it be robots?

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Would Twilight with robots? I haven't seen, like, I sometimes poke around the young adult.

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
With androids?

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You know, bitches love data. Why not?

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Mm, bitches do love data. Fully functional.

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He's fully functional.

104
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What is our gimmick?

105
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Fifty Shades with robots?

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That would be, like, this is already 5,000% more awesome than any of these bitches.

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The BDSM bots, and one of them grows a soul somehow.

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So are they, like, sex bots that were like, yeah, it could be like an AI with Jude Law,

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and he's like a prostitute bot.

110
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This is already way too interesting for our project.

111
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Tone it down!

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Bring the thought level down, man.

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
She goes to school, and there's a robot.

114
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
He just wants to be a human. Or an alien.

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
He just doesn't want to live in District 9 anymore.

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
There's a prawn, but he's a sexy prawn.

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He wears a human suit he made out of skin.

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,000
He can have, like, the Phantom. Like, he takes off his human mask, and she's like, you're beautiful.

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
One of my favorite moments in history, of the history of film, is the moment Edward Cullen

120
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
is, like, standing in the sun with this, like, you know, sparkle.

121
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Like, he just went to the MAC store and, like, got sparkle-fied, and is looking at her, and says, with all sincerity,

122
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
This is the skin of a killer, though.

123
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
We're putting too much thought into this.

124
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yeah, but I'm liking that he takes his mask off, and she's like, you're beautiful. Man, just man.

125
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So those are our assignments. What's our gimmick? What's our genre?

126
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Young adult or, uh, sexy sci-fi with actual sex.

127
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Or is it even sci-fi? Is it paranormal?

128
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And of course, all this will be going up on what will become our idea wall.

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yes. Right behind us.

130
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So you see there's this glorious blank wall behind us.

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
We need to fix this, so send us wall things so we will have ideas and fun romance-novel-y things

132
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
for us to put up on our wall.

133
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Send us your ideas about gimmick genre, all sorts of fun observation.

134
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Tweet us at shayapocalypse, hashtag 50shadesofgreen, and of course you can follow us at shayapocalypse.

135
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Leave comments at shayapocalypse.com and on our Blip page at 50shadesofgreen.

136
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You can also follow sexyalienbook if you just want to laugh.

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Because I will retweet anything I think is funny.

138
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That shit was hilarious.

139
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Be sure to tune in next week when we change our clothes and discuss characters.

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What's their appeal? Why do we love these ladies?

141
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Why do we identify with them?

142
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And what makes us so hot about our abusive male love interests?

143
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And why is there always an ethnic third wheel?

144
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
We need an ethnic third wheel.

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We need an ethnic third wheel.

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But that's what's not been done.

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Chinese? Too common?

148
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Indian.

149
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Indian!

150
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But the other-no we discussed the other kind of Indian!

151
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
In Twilight, he's Native American.

152
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
In 50 Shades, he's Mexican.

153
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And so without-no.

154
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Like, no argument on this, he's gonna be from India.

155
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's-sorry guys.

156
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Sorry guys.

157
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's India.

158
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's India.

159
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's India.
