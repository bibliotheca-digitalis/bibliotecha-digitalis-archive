1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Uh, our little intro bumper this week comes courtesy of Tone Rebellion.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,240
Ahem.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,920
In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits, dreaming of her.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,720
So we're gonna do things a little bit different this week.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,400
Uh, we'll get to the comments after we talk about the outlines.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,760
Most of the comments are suggestions on name and that sort of thing.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,480
So, uh, first things first.

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,400
Let's talk about what we've nailed down so far of the Outlaw Heads monstrosity.

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,080
Uh, well, the opening should definitely be of her dreaming a very literal dream.

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,640
Mm.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,440
Um, that's gonna tell you exactly what's gonna come.

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,160
Um.

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,120
Our story proper starts in our little Innsmouth town.

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,640
Which is a university town.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,600
Yeah, and literally everyone's parents work at the university.

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,320
And so the major employer of the surrounding five towns.

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,800
Lego, Brick, and Ethnic Third Wheel have been the best of friends for as long as they commit

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,440
and remember.

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,400
That's why she has no interest in him at all, because he's like a brother.

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,360
He's like a brother.

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,400
He inherits this family heirloom, which we later find out to be the Necronomicon, and

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,120
trying to impress her, he shows it to her, and she's like, well, let's fucking read it,

23
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,840
and they do.

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,400
Mm.

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,000
The next day, school starts.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,560
Uh-huh.

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,960
And hottie McChestabs.

28
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,320
Yeah, shows up.

29
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,760
Well, not even, he doesn't even show up.

30
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,840
He's just like, he's looking at them across, like, the parking lot or something.

31
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,800
Yeah, he's just there.

32
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,520
And Ethnic Third Wheel is super threatened by him immediately.

33
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,760
So when's the point, um, that she starts having her, uh, her artistic endeavors that aren't

34
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,920
actually her ability, just force of habit?

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,040
I think, like, like, that night, like, after they read from it.

36
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,640
And she's, she like, maybe draws a picture of, like, this really hot guy.

37
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,140
Mm.

38
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,400
But there's a lot of monstrous stuff in the background.

39
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:52,900
Yeah.

40
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:53,860
Like, there's tentacles.

41
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,460
This is just, like, my dream.

42
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,980
Yeah, except for without the tentacles.

43
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,140
Yeah, like, she sees this really hot guy with, like, a mass of tentacles behind him, and

44
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,580
she's, like, horrified and turned on by this dream that, you know, I sleep drew.

45
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,620
Yeah, so then one day, they're, they're at, like, a pool party, because it's still hot.

46
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,820
Because it's still, you know.

47
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,980
She, she has terrible hydrophobia, by the way.

48
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,740
She hates water.

49
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,900
She, she'll even joke about, like, in a self-deprecating way that she can't even take a bath.

50
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,940
One day, we're at a pool party, and some guy, playfully being a jackass, like, pushes her in.

51
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,260
Yeah, one of her, like, pull her in with him, and be, like, dunking her, and, like,

52
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,820
threatening to, like, untie her bathing suit or something.

53
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,320
Like, super.

54
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,900
No, I don't think it should be that, that threatening.

55
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,180
I think it should be, like, innocent.

56
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,680
Okay, okay.

57
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,860
It should be just, like, he's, like, yeah, he's, like, horse-playing with her, like, come on.

58
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,340
Yeah.

59
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,620
And, and, like, immediately Cthulhu gets, like, that protective rage and just drives

60
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,420
him insane.

61
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:51,140
And so, like, he, you know, for the rest of his life is, like, a shrieking vegetable.

62
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,620
Yeah.

63
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,060
Which they'll blame on drugs.

64
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,340
Yeah, and, and Cthulhu, hot Cthulhu will never be held accountable.

65
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:56,580
Yes.

66
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,860
Lego brick will never, never be troubled by this.

67
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,300
Be like, you did this?

68
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,700
Wow, you're so powerful.

69
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,260
What are you?

70
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,780
Yeah, after this point, they need to have, like, their savior in the hospital.

71
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,100
Yeah.

72
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,980
Not in the hospital, but, like, he, he pisses her off somehow.

73
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,980
Like, he, she's, like, I know something's up with you.

74
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,420
And he's, like, you should never know.

75
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,220
Of course, but before all this, though, we're also introduced to the woman who will become

76
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,100
the villain, who we've decided should be an adult.

77
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,500
Yeah.

78
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,220
Who works at the university.

79
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,580
She's, like, an adjunct.

80
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,580
Yeah, you know, and she's, like, super hot.

81
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,300
Yeah.

82
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,780
And Lego brick is immediately threatened by how hot she is.

83
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,660
But she should be described as this beautiful, gorgeous woman who has a desperate look to

84
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,060
her eye.

85
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,540
Yeah.

86
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:40,580
Like, and not just because, like, she's, like, this cult leader, but also because she's a

87
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,300
woman scorned.

88
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,380
Yeah, we, like, she, she'll often be described as a woman scorned.

89
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,340
But we'll never, ever, ever say why.

90
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,060
No one will ever talk to us.

91
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,780
She might be scorned.

92
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,900
What, what, who scorned her?

93
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,620
Why she was scorned.

94
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,100
I feel like, I feel like Neil, Uncle Neil should know the story, but he never tells it.

95
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,700
Yeah, he's just like, oh, I know her.

96
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,100
I just like, that's an interesting story.

97
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,980
And then they get distracted by something else.

98
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:11,140
Yeah, so then she ends up at a college party, like, and of course, she, like,

99
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,580
drinks too much.

100
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,140
Like, or she doesn't realize, like, she's drinking alcohol.

101
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,580
Like, I thought this was iced tea.

102
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,540
Yeah, wow.

103
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,740
So this, I've never been to Long Island before.

104
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,340
At the college party, drinks too much, gets almost raped.

105
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:24,740
Yeah.

106
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,060
Cthulhu saves her from the almost rape.

107
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,420
Again, we have another blithering insanity case, which gets blamed on drugs.

108
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:30,900
On drugs.

109
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,420
It's mostly bath salts.

110
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,620
It gets blamed on drugs.

111
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,100
Yeah.

112
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,980
And then it's topical.

113
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,980
It'll turn into, like, 21 Jump Street, like, on a subplot that we never see.

114
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,100
And then, like, they're real, like, hardcore.

115
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,460
He, like, phantoms her and kidnaps her and takes her into, like, his, I don't know, local lair.

116
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,740
And she finds out the whole truth about the prophecy and how I don't want to devour you

117
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:52,980
anymore.

118
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,500
He does some really fucked up shit, like, kidnap her, holds her against her will, probably

119
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,300
holds her down.

120
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,180
She goes, no, no, no, but really, yes.

121
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:00,420
Yeah.

122
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,460
And so now that, and he's like, I don't want to, you know, devour your body and soul.

123
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,500
Uh, what are we gonna do?

124
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,860
We're gonna stop this prophecy.

125
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,740
So they go to Uncle Nyarlathotep.

126
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,940
I'm so excited about Uncle Nyarlathotep.

127
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,940
Special thanks to Dylan Turn for this one, uh, that, uh, Nyarlathotep, he's, like, this,

128
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,140
the most awesome character.

129
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,260
He's, like, an old hippie or something.

130
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,580
And he runs this Lovecraft basic cult shop.

131
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,340
And he talks all the time about he and Nikola Tesla would go freak out this racist cult

132
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,060
horror writer.

133
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,220
And basically people will think, why the hell is this book not about Nyarlathotep, like,

134
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:35,620
completely?

135
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:35,860
Yeah.

136
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,580
And his, like, madcap adventures, like, among humanity.

137
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,140
And he'll start, like, he'll keep alluding to them.

138
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,780
And our, our main characters with no interest at all.

139
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,700
So, or they'll, like, they'll be like, it'll be like, that's a great story.

140
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,860
So back to, like, what I love.

141
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,020
And then meanwhile, our, you know, hot villainous is a woman scorned.

142
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,420
Yes.

143
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,700
And it turns out she's the cult leader.

144
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,420
Yeah.

145
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,820
And eventually ethnic third wheel, who has been nothing but threatened by Cthulhu this

146
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,300
whole time.

147
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,140
And rightfully so, because he's a piece of fuck.

148
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:13,540
Shit gets real when ethnic third wheel, uh, goes to the hot cult leader and gets brainwashed.

149
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,780
He goes right away and makes a point of this, that the bad guy be portrayed as slutty and

150
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,220
have her seduce Indian third wheel to get him on their side.

151
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,860
That way we can double down on the weird sexual politics by having the main character be completely

152
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,500
passive and also slut shaming the villain and having sexually assertive women be the

153
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,220
ultimate evil.

154
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,660
Yeah.

155
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,620
Can do.

156
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,740
And so basically like the third act will be all about stopping brainwashed ethnic third

157
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:44,820
wheel and slutty villainous from, uh, uh, you know, using their cult powers to, uh,

158
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,700
you know, summon the greater evil, which is, I guess, Azathoth.

159
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,460
And, uh, that is our plot.

160
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,180
Let the terrible details commence.

161
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,980
The reason we're doing comment seconds is because there was a lot of little details

162
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,340
instead of big sweeping ones that we could divide by theme.

163
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,260
So let's see what we got.

164
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:08,980
We got a lot.

165
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,500
And again, highlights reel.

166
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,260
Sorry for people who didn't get it.

167
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,620
And it was a lot and especially the scenes, which are awesome and we love.

168
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,940
And, uh, yeah, here, here's some suggestions from Andrew Green that I like.

169
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,660
Denny F.

170
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,140
Bridge is an anagram of bitchy friend.

171
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,820
Uh, Kate S.

172
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,380
Fiddick is an anagram of bat sidekick.

173
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,900
I kind of like the Kate Fiddick.

174
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,620
Kate Fiddick.

175
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:29,860
Yeah.

176
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,980
It even kind of sounds fat.

177
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,460
Yeah.

178
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,660
Fat and annoying.

179
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,100
It's actually quite a pleasant character.

180
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,660
Yeah.

181
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,580
And he's actually probably the best friend you'll ever have.

182
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,660
But yeah, you know, our, yeah, our, our, our Lego brick is threatened by all.

183
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,420
We got a lot of votes for Bianca.

184
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,620
Bianca Slate.

185
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,020
Yeah.

186
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,740
And Slate is good, but Bianca Slate's a little too on the nose.

187
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,060
Yeah.

188
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,500
Same with Tabula Rasa.

189
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:48,820
Yeah.

190
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,580
I mean, as much as I love Bianca Slate and you love Tabula Rasa, it is just a little

191
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,300
too on the nose.

192
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,500
Well, uh, among others, um, Melodia E.

193
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,940
McIntyre wrote that Penelope, uh, the character from The Honesty is known for remaining chased,

194
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,460
waiting for her one true love while 108 men want her desperately.

195
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,580
Um, and also she could go by Penny because she hates her name.

196
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,700
Cause it's weird.

197
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,820
Um, I love the idea of it being Penelope.

198
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,380
It's the idea of waiting.

199
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:15,700
Yeah.

200
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,020
I like.

201
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:16,820
Or Rasa.

202
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,540
Or Rasa.

203
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,340
Or heart.

204
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,100
You know, cause going for a nice like soft, cause it's all about love.

205
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,700
We had a lot of funny, uh, like title ones.

206
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:30,100
Kalok Stevens suggests chartreuse whispers.

207
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,460
Sean Simonis.

208
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,700
I have, um, Verdant Dreams.

209
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,140
Olivine Nights.

210
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,900
As well as Malachite Visions.

211
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:43,700
Oh, I like the, uh, the idea of using things like, uh, uh, Verdigris or Viridian.

212
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:43,940
Yeah.

213
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,700
Those are good bees.

214
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:51,220
Gregory Loscalzo reminds us that, uh, verdigris, according to Wikipedia, is a common name for a

215
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:56,580
green pigment obtained through, uh, the natural patina formed when copper, brass, or bronze is

216
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,300
weathered.

217
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,500
So that could like, you know.

218
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,300
That works really well.

219
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,700
That could indicate that we have no idea what this word verdigris actually means.

220
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:03,860
Yeah.

221
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,780
I, uh, I like the idea of at least one of the chapters being undertow.

222
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,500
And submerged.

223
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,060
Dark Waters suggests Bethany Hough.

224
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,140
Could be a good one.

225
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:21,700
Laura Backus suggests, uh, Rain of Darkness, Dark Fate, Book of Fate, Low Tide, Riptide.

226
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,420
Dark Waters.

227
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:28,580
Elizabeth Smith suggested Love Lies Dreaming, possibly followed by sequels Love Awakens

228
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,220
and so on.

229
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:36,420
I was noticing a lot of comments, um, for example, from Jet Black that, um, like Cthulhu

230
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,460
as being part of the swim team as being a thing.

231
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:44,020
And while that would be hilarious, I think the problem with that is that that actually

232
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,060
makes him too social.

233
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,340
Yeah, a little too jockey.

234
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:46,740
I think he's like.

235
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,940
Active in the community.

236
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,540
Yeah, it's like, well, the thing is, it's like, Edward is so super powerful.

237
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,660
Like Christian Grey is obviously, like, very active.

238
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,140
Yeah.

239
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,820
But in solitary ways.

240
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,460
Yeah, we want an angel from Buffy.

241
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,820
We don't want a Riley.

242
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:05,620
Although we had, yeah, we, we, we did have a lot of suggestions that Hot Cthulhu's name

243
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,900
is Riley.

244
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,340
Like, Ru-ya.

245
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,460
However, that's pronounced.

246
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:09,780
Yeah.

247
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,820
Ru-ya.

248
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,100
Which I think is a great idea.

249
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,460
I really like Riley.

250
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:19,540
Jamie of Needs More Gay Fame, uh, suggested Sonya Slate as the protagonist.

251
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:25,940
Um, we liked the idea of, um, Lego Bricks mom and dad being named Sonya and Howard after

252
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,020
H.P. and his wife, Sonya.

253
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:32,740
Dr. Rice suggested that, uh, we got some sort of ominous catchphrase that the cult keeps

254
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,020
saying that never gets explained.

255
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,140
Like, this is the twilight of the universe or something.

256
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:37,460
Yes.

257
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:38,900
Can do.

258
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:44,340
Another one from Dylan Turn that, uh, Hot Cthulhu, whenever she's having those dreams,

259
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,820
it's actually him possessing her body.

260
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,620
And she likes it because he's always inside her.

261
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,620
It's like I, I was using you and she's like, but I liked it.

262
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,540
So good job, internet.

263
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:08,740
We're about to the point where we can start, uh, accepting applications for, uh, our ghost

264
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,220
riders.

265
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,940
And I guess I should preface this by saying we're going to have five, maybe six, and,

266
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,500
uh, a backup or two in case anyone flakes.

267
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,860
Uh, so there, there will not be many because this is only a 70,000 word novel and we're

268
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,900
having ghost writers do chunks of it just so we can have a quicker turnover than it

269
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,420
would take to actually write a novel.

270
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:42,740
But basically, uh, if you can, if you think you could write 5,000 to 10,000 words in two

271
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,460
weeks and I, four or five days of nano.

272
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,580
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

273
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,940
It's like four or five days of nano.

274
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,700
If you could do a NaNoWriMo, you could do this.

275
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:54,100
Please don't apply if you can't turn around 10,000 words in two weeks.

276
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,220
And we are paying for this.

277
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,740
We'll tell you the rate once we, uh, you know, get you on board.

278
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:08,340
So the way this is going to work is you send us a writing sample at this email address

279
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,820
that I've totally made by today.

280
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:21,140
Uh, it with the contact information, your email address, a way to get in touch with

281
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:28,740
you and, uh, no more than 250 word scene based on, uh, some of the scenes we've read.

282
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,100
Just anything that you feel captures your voice.

283
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,620
A scene involving our two leads.

284
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,180
Yeah.

285
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,100
Or ethnic third wheel.

286
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,220
Or the parents.

287
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,580
Slutty antagonists.

288
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:46,020
Um, or, or cool uncle Neil or cool uncle Neil who I'd read the shit out of those.

289
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,940
Gets the hell ignored out of him.

290
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,180
Make the subject line 50 shades of green sample.

291
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,300
And again, don't do this if you can't churn out 10,000 words in two weeks.

292
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,540
And we're not going to respond to comments on our episode next week.

293
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,140
Next week we're going to talk about location.

294
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,140
Not really responding to comments because we're gonna spend the next two weeks, uh,

295
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,020
wading through our, uh, samples.

296
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,740
Mm-hmm.

297
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,540
And, uh, so.

298
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,580
Finalizing an outline.

299
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,220
Yeah.

300
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,340
Finalizing the outline.

301
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:17,620
So two weeks from now we will have, uh, answers as to who we are going to bring on board and

302
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,700
what our final outline will be.

303
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:24,420
And again, remember to check for updates at shayapocalypse.com and follow us on Twitter

304
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:30,260
at Shayapocalypse or at Sexy Alien Book where I retweet the funny things people say at me.

305
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:35,540
And remember, friends, we do this for you, but we do this for literature.

306
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:41,460
Because some things should not stand, but if they must, by God, we should at least make

307
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,500
something from it.

308
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:48,260
Something that we can look at and say, I might not be proud of it, but it might make me a

309
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,940
few bucks on the side.

310
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,300
And isn't that what it's all about?

311
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:54,980
Wading!
