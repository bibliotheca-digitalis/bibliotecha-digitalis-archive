WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.240
Uh, our little intro bumper this week comes courtesy of Tone Rebellion.

00:04.240 --> 00:06.240
Ahem.

00:06.240 --> 00:11.920
In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits, dreaming of her.

00:16.720 --> 00:18.720
So we're gonna do things a little bit different this week.

00:18.720 --> 00:22.400
Uh, we'll get to the comments after we talk about the outlines.

00:22.400 --> 00:25.760
Most of the comments are suggestions on name and that sort of thing.

00:26.480 --> 00:28.480
So, uh, first things first.

00:29.360 --> 00:34.400
Let's talk about what we've nailed down so far of the Outlaw Heads monstrosity.

00:35.680 --> 00:40.080
Uh, well, the opening should definitely be of her dreaming a very literal dream.

00:40.080 --> 00:40.640
Mm.

00:40.640 --> 00:43.440
Um, that's gonna tell you exactly what's gonna come.

00:43.440 --> 00:44.160
Um.

00:44.160 --> 00:49.120
Our story proper starts in our little Innsmouth town.

00:49.120 --> 00:50.640
Which is a university town.

00:50.640 --> 00:53.600
Yeah, and literally everyone's parents work at the university.

00:53.600 --> 00:56.320
And so the major employer of the surrounding five towns.

00:56.320 --> 01:00.800
Lego, Brick, and Ethnic Third Wheel have been the best of friends for as long as they commit

01:00.800 --> 01:01.440
and remember.

01:01.440 --> 01:04.400
That's why she has no interest in him at all, because he's like a brother.

01:04.400 --> 01:05.360
He's like a brother.

01:05.360 --> 01:10.400
He inherits this family heirloom, which we later find out to be the Necronomicon, and

01:10.400 --> 01:15.120
trying to impress her, he shows it to her, and she's like, well, let's fucking read it,

01:15.120 --> 01:15.840
and they do.

01:15.840 --> 01:16.400
Mm.

01:16.400 --> 01:20.000
The next day, school starts.

01:20.000 --> 01:20.560
Uh-huh.

01:20.560 --> 01:22.960
And hottie McChestabs.

01:22.960 --> 01:24.320
Yeah, shows up.

01:24.320 --> 01:25.760
Well, not even, he doesn't even show up.

01:25.760 --> 01:29.840
He's just like, he's looking at them across, like, the parking lot or something.

01:29.840 --> 01:30.800
Yeah, he's just there.

01:30.800 --> 01:33.520
And Ethnic Third Wheel is super threatened by him immediately.

01:34.080 --> 01:39.760
So when's the point, um, that she starts having her, uh, her artistic endeavors that aren't

01:39.760 --> 01:41.920
actually her ability, just force of habit?

01:41.920 --> 01:45.040
I think, like, like, that night, like, after they read from it.

01:45.040 --> 01:48.640
And she's, she like, maybe draws a picture of, like, this really hot guy.

01:48.640 --> 01:49.140
Mm.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.400
But there's a lot of monstrous stuff in the background.

01:52.400 --> 01:52.900
Yeah.

01:53.060 --> 01:53.860
Like, there's tentacles.

01:53.860 --> 01:55.460
This is just, like, my dream.

01:55.460 --> 01:56.980
Yeah, except for without the tentacles.

01:57.540 --> 02:01.140
Yeah, like, she sees this really hot guy with, like, a mass of tentacles behind him, and

02:01.140 --> 02:06.580
she's, like, horrified and turned on by this dream that, you know, I sleep drew.

02:06.580 --> 02:09.620
Yeah, so then one day, they're, they're at, like, a pool party, because it's still hot.

02:09.620 --> 02:10.820
Because it's still, you know.

02:10.820 --> 02:12.980
She, she has terrible hydrophobia, by the way.

02:13.860 --> 02:14.740
She hates water.

02:14.740 --> 02:18.900
She, she'll even joke about, like, in a self-deprecating way that she can't even take a bath.

02:18.900 --> 02:23.940
One day, we're at a pool party, and some guy, playfully being a jackass, like, pushes her in.

02:23.940 --> 02:28.260
Yeah, one of her, like, pull her in with him, and be, like, dunking her, and, like,

02:28.260 --> 02:30.820
threatening to, like, untie her bathing suit or something.

02:30.820 --> 02:31.320
Like, super.

02:31.320 --> 02:32.900
No, I don't think it should be that, that threatening.

02:32.900 --> 02:34.180
I think it should be, like, innocent.

02:34.180 --> 02:34.680
Okay, okay.

02:35.540 --> 02:39.860
It should be just, like, he's, like, yeah, he's, like, horse-playing with her, like, come on.

02:39.860 --> 02:40.340
Yeah.

02:40.340 --> 02:45.620
And, and, like, immediately Cthulhu gets, like, that protective rage and just drives

02:45.620 --> 02:46.420
him insane.

02:46.420 --> 02:51.140
And so, like, he, you know, for the rest of his life is, like, a shrieking vegetable.

02:51.140 --> 02:51.620
Yeah.

02:51.620 --> 02:53.060
Which they'll blame on drugs.

02:53.060 --> 02:56.340
Yeah, and, and Cthulhu, hot Cthulhu will never be held accountable.

02:56.340 --> 02:56.580
Yes.

02:56.580 --> 02:59.860
Lego brick will never, never be troubled by this.

02:59.860 --> 03:01.300
Be like, you did this?

03:02.340 --> 03:03.700
Wow, you're so powerful.

03:03.700 --> 03:04.260
What are you?

03:05.300 --> 03:07.780
Yeah, after this point, they need to have, like, their savior in the hospital.

03:07.780 --> 03:08.100
Yeah.

03:08.100 --> 03:10.980
Not in the hospital, but, like, he, he pisses her off somehow.

03:10.980 --> 03:12.980
Like, he, she's, like, I know something's up with you.

03:12.980 --> 03:14.420
And he's, like, you should never know.

03:15.220 --> 03:19.220
Of course, but before all this, though, we're also introduced to the woman who will become

03:19.220 --> 03:22.100
the villain, who we've decided should be an adult.

03:22.100 --> 03:22.500
Yeah.

03:22.500 --> 03:23.220
Who works at the university.

03:23.220 --> 03:24.580
She's, like, an adjunct.

03:24.580 --> 03:26.580
Yeah, you know, and she's, like, super hot.

03:26.580 --> 03:27.300
Yeah.

03:27.300 --> 03:29.780
And Lego brick is immediately threatened by how hot she is.

03:29.780 --> 03:34.660
But she should be described as this beautiful, gorgeous woman who has a desperate look to

03:34.660 --> 03:35.060
her eye.

03:35.060 --> 03:35.540
Yeah.

03:35.540 --> 03:40.580
Like, and not just because, like, she's, like, this cult leader, but also because she's a

03:40.580 --> 03:41.300
woman scorned.

03:41.300 --> 03:45.380
Yeah, we, like, she, she'll often be described as a woman scorned.

03:45.380 --> 03:48.340
But we'll never, ever, ever say why.

03:48.340 --> 03:49.060
No one will ever talk to us.

03:49.060 --> 03:49.780
She might be scorned.

03:49.780 --> 03:50.900
What, what, who scorned her?

03:52.420 --> 03:53.620
Why she was scorned.

03:54.420 --> 03:58.100
I feel like, I feel like Neil, Uncle Neil should know the story, but he never tells it.

03:58.100 --> 03:59.700
Yeah, he's just like, oh, I know her.

03:59.700 --> 04:02.100
I just like, that's an interesting story.

04:02.100 --> 04:04.980
And then they get distracted by something else.

04:07.460 --> 04:11.140
Yeah, so then she ends up at a college party, like, and of course, she, like,

04:11.700 --> 04:12.580
drinks too much.

04:12.580 --> 04:15.140
Like, or she doesn't realize, like, she's drinking alcohol.

04:15.140 --> 04:16.580
Like, I thought this was iced tea.

04:16.580 --> 04:17.540
Yeah, wow.

04:17.540 --> 04:20.740
So this, I've never been to Long Island before.

04:21.460 --> 04:24.340
At the college party, drinks too much, gets almost raped.

04:24.340 --> 04:24.740
Yeah.

04:24.740 --> 04:27.060
Cthulhu saves her from the almost rape.

04:27.060 --> 04:30.420
Again, we have another blithering insanity case, which gets blamed on drugs.

04:30.420 --> 04:30.900
On drugs.

04:30.900 --> 04:32.420
It's mostly bath salts.

04:32.420 --> 04:33.620
It gets blamed on drugs.

04:33.620 --> 04:34.100
Yeah.

04:34.100 --> 04:34.980
And then it's topical.

04:34.980 --> 04:38.980
It'll turn into, like, 21 Jump Street, like, on a subplot that we never see.

04:41.380 --> 04:44.100
And then, like, they're real, like, hardcore.

04:44.100 --> 04:49.460
He, like, phantoms her and kidnaps her and takes her into, like, his, I don't know, local lair.

04:49.460 --> 04:52.740
And she finds out the whole truth about the prophecy and how I don't want to devour you

04:52.740 --> 04:52.980
anymore.

04:52.980 --> 04:56.500
He does some really fucked up shit, like, kidnap her, holds her against her will, probably

04:56.500 --> 04:57.300
holds her down.

04:57.860 --> 05:00.180
She goes, no, no, no, but really, yes.

05:00.180 --> 05:00.420
Yeah.

05:01.620 --> 05:05.460
And so now that, and he's like, I don't want to, you know, devour your body and soul.

05:05.460 --> 05:06.500
Uh, what are we gonna do?

05:06.500 --> 05:07.860
We're gonna stop this prophecy.

05:08.740 --> 05:10.740
So they go to Uncle Nyarlathotep.

05:12.820 --> 05:15.940
I'm so excited about Uncle Nyarlathotep.

05:15.940 --> 05:21.940
Special thanks to Dylan Turn for this one, uh, that, uh, Nyarlathotep, he's, like, this,

05:21.940 --> 05:23.140
the most awesome character.

05:23.140 --> 05:24.260
He's, like, an old hippie or something.

05:24.260 --> 05:26.580
And he runs this Lovecraft basic cult shop.

05:26.580 --> 05:30.340
And he talks all the time about he and Nikola Tesla would go freak out this racist cult

05:30.340 --> 05:31.060
horror writer.

05:31.060 --> 05:35.220
And basically people will think, why the hell is this book not about Nyarlathotep, like,

05:35.220 --> 05:35.620
completely?

05:35.620 --> 05:35.860
Yeah.

05:35.860 --> 05:38.580
And his, like, madcap adventures, like, among humanity.

05:38.580 --> 05:41.140
And he'll start, like, he'll keep alluding to them.

05:41.140 --> 05:43.780
And our, our main characters with no interest at all.

05:43.780 --> 05:47.700
So, or they'll, like, they'll be like, it'll be like, that's a great story.

05:47.700 --> 05:49.860
So back to, like, what I love.

05:52.100 --> 05:56.020
And then meanwhile, our, you know, hot villainous is a woman scorned.

05:56.020 --> 05:56.420
Yes.

05:56.420 --> 05:59.700
And it turns out she's the cult leader.

05:59.700 --> 06:00.420
Yeah.

06:00.420 --> 06:04.820
And eventually ethnic third wheel, who has been nothing but threatened by Cthulhu this

06:04.820 --> 06:05.300
whole time.

06:05.300 --> 06:07.140
And rightfully so, because he's a piece of fuck.

06:07.700 --> 06:13.540
Shit gets real when ethnic third wheel, uh, goes to the hot cult leader and gets brainwashed.

06:13.540 --> 06:17.780
He goes right away and makes a point of this, that the bad guy be portrayed as slutty and

06:17.780 --> 06:21.220
have her seduce Indian third wheel to get him on their side.

06:21.220 --> 06:25.860
That way we can double down on the weird sexual politics by having the main character be completely

06:25.860 --> 06:30.500
passive and also slut shaming the villain and having sexually assertive women be the

06:30.500 --> 06:31.220
ultimate evil.

06:32.180 --> 06:32.660
Yeah.

06:32.660 --> 06:33.620
Can do.

06:33.700 --> 06:38.740
And so basically like the third act will be all about stopping brainwashed ethnic third

06:38.740 --> 06:44.820
wheel and slutty villainous from, uh, uh, you know, using their cult powers to, uh,

06:44.820 --> 06:47.700
you know, summon the greater evil, which is, I guess, Azathoth.

06:48.900 --> 06:51.460
And, uh, that is our plot.

06:52.580 --> 06:56.180
Let the terrible details commence.

06:59.780 --> 07:02.980
The reason we're doing comment seconds is because there was a lot of little details

07:02.980 --> 07:06.340
instead of big sweeping ones that we could divide by theme.

07:06.340 --> 07:08.260
So let's see what we got.

07:08.260 --> 07:08.980
We got a lot.

07:08.980 --> 07:10.500
And again, highlights reel.

07:10.500 --> 07:12.260
Sorry for people who didn't get it.

07:12.260 --> 07:15.620
And it was a lot and especially the scenes, which are awesome and we love.

07:15.620 --> 07:19.940
And, uh, yeah, here, here's some suggestions from Andrew Green that I like.

07:19.940 --> 07:20.660
Denny F.

07:20.660 --> 07:23.140
Bridge is an anagram of bitchy friend.

07:23.700 --> 07:24.820
Uh, Kate S.

07:24.820 --> 07:27.380
Fiddick is an anagram of bat sidekick.

07:27.380 --> 07:28.900
I kind of like the Kate Fiddick.

07:28.900 --> 07:29.620
Kate Fiddick.

07:29.620 --> 07:29.860
Yeah.

07:29.860 --> 07:30.980
It even kind of sounds fat.

07:30.980 --> 07:31.460
Yeah.

07:31.460 --> 07:32.660
Fat and annoying.

07:32.740 --> 07:34.100
It's actually quite a pleasant character.

07:34.100 --> 07:34.660
Yeah.

07:34.660 --> 07:36.580
And he's actually probably the best friend you'll ever have.

07:36.580 --> 07:40.660
But yeah, you know, our, yeah, our, our, our Lego brick is threatened by all.

07:40.660 --> 07:42.420
We got a lot of votes for Bianca.

07:42.420 --> 07:43.620
Bianca Slate.

07:43.620 --> 07:44.020
Yeah.

07:44.020 --> 07:46.740
And Slate is good, but Bianca Slate's a little too on the nose.

07:46.740 --> 07:47.060
Yeah.

07:47.060 --> 07:48.500
Same with Tabula Rasa.

07:48.500 --> 07:48.820
Yeah.

07:48.820 --> 07:52.580
I mean, as much as I love Bianca Slate and you love Tabula Rasa, it is just a little

07:52.580 --> 07:53.300
too on the nose.

07:53.300 --> 07:56.500
Well, uh, among others, um, Melodia E.

07:56.500 --> 08:01.940
McIntyre wrote that Penelope, uh, the character from The Honesty is known for remaining chased,

08:01.940 --> 08:05.460
waiting for her one true love while 108 men want her desperately.

08:05.460 --> 08:08.580
Um, and also she could go by Penny because she hates her name.

08:08.580 --> 08:09.700
Cause it's weird.

08:09.700 --> 08:12.820
Um, I love the idea of it being Penelope.

08:12.820 --> 08:15.380
It's the idea of waiting.

08:15.380 --> 08:15.700
Yeah.

08:15.700 --> 08:16.020
I like.

08:16.020 --> 08:16.820
Or Rasa.

08:16.820 --> 08:17.540
Or Rasa.

08:17.540 --> 08:18.340
Or heart.

08:18.900 --> 08:22.100
You know, cause going for a nice like soft, cause it's all about love.

08:22.740 --> 08:25.700
We had a lot of funny, uh, like title ones.

08:25.700 --> 08:30.100
Kalok Stevens suggests chartreuse whispers.

08:30.100 --> 08:31.460
Sean Simonis.

08:31.540 --> 08:33.700
I have, um, Verdant Dreams.

08:33.700 --> 08:35.140
Olivine Nights.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.900
As well as Malachite Visions.

08:36.900 --> 08:43.700
Oh, I like the, uh, the idea of using things like, uh, uh, Verdigris or Viridian.

08:43.700 --> 08:43.940
Yeah.

08:44.740 --> 08:45.700
Those are good bees.

08:46.260 --> 08:51.220
Gregory Loscalzo reminds us that, uh, verdigris, according to Wikipedia, is a common name for a

08:51.220 --> 08:56.580
green pigment obtained through, uh, the natural patina formed when copper, brass, or bronze is

08:56.580 --> 08:57.300
weathered.

08:57.300 --> 08:58.500
So that could like, you know.

08:58.500 --> 08:59.300
That works really well.

08:59.860 --> 09:03.700
That could indicate that we have no idea what this word verdigris actually means.

09:03.700 --> 09:03.860
Yeah.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.780
I, uh, I like the idea of at least one of the chapters being undertow.

09:09.300 --> 09:10.500
And submerged.

09:10.500 --> 09:13.060
Dark Waters suggests Bethany Hough.

09:14.020 --> 09:15.140
Could be a good one.

09:15.140 --> 09:21.700
Laura Backus suggests, uh, Rain of Darkness, Dark Fate, Book of Fate, Low Tide, Riptide.

09:21.700 --> 09:22.420
Dark Waters.

09:22.980 --> 09:28.580
Elizabeth Smith suggested Love Lies Dreaming, possibly followed by sequels Love Awakens

09:28.580 --> 09:29.220
and so on.

09:30.020 --> 09:36.420
I was noticing a lot of comments, um, for example, from Jet Black that, um, like Cthulhu

09:36.420 --> 09:39.460
as being part of the swim team as being a thing.

09:39.460 --> 09:44.020
And while that would be hilarious, I think the problem with that is that that actually

09:44.020 --> 09:45.060
makes him too social.

09:45.060 --> 09:46.340
Yeah, a little too jockey.

09:46.340 --> 09:46.740
I think he's like.

09:46.740 --> 09:47.940
Active in the community.

09:47.940 --> 09:51.540
Yeah, it's like, well, the thing is, it's like, Edward is so super powerful.

09:51.540 --> 09:54.660
Like Christian Grey is obviously, like, very active.

09:54.660 --> 09:55.140
Yeah.

09:55.140 --> 09:56.820
But in solitary ways.

09:56.820 --> 09:59.460
Yeah, we want an angel from Buffy.

09:59.460 --> 10:00.820
We don't want a Riley.

10:00.820 --> 10:05.620
Although we had, yeah, we, we, we did have a lot of suggestions that Hot Cthulhu's name

10:05.620 --> 10:06.900
is Riley.

10:06.900 --> 10:08.340
Like, Ru-ya.

10:08.340 --> 10:09.460
However, that's pronounced.

10:09.460 --> 10:09.780
Yeah.

10:09.780 --> 10:10.820
Ru-ya.

10:10.820 --> 10:12.100
Which I think is a great idea.

10:12.100 --> 10:13.460
I really like Riley.

10:13.460 --> 10:19.540
Jamie of Needs More Gay Fame, uh, suggested Sonya Slate as the protagonist.

10:19.540 --> 10:25.940
Um, we liked the idea of, um, Lego Bricks mom and dad being named Sonya and Howard after

10:25.940 --> 10:28.020
H.P. and his wife, Sonya.

10:28.020 --> 10:32.740
Dr. Rice suggested that, uh, we got some sort of ominous catchphrase that the cult keeps

10:32.740 --> 10:34.020
saying that never gets explained.

10:34.020 --> 10:37.140
Like, this is the twilight of the universe or something.

10:37.140 --> 10:37.460
Yes.

10:38.340 --> 10:38.900
Can do.

10:40.020 --> 10:44.340
Another one from Dylan Turn that, uh, Hot Cthulhu, whenever she's having those dreams,

10:44.340 --> 10:46.820
it's actually him possessing her body.

10:46.820 --> 10:49.620
And she likes it because he's always inside her.

10:50.340 --> 10:53.620
It's like I, I was using you and she's like, but I liked it.

10:56.100 --> 10:57.540
So good job, internet.

10:58.500 --> 11:08.740
We're about to the point where we can start, uh, accepting applications for, uh, our ghost

11:08.740 --> 11:09.220
riders.

11:14.340 --> 11:19.940
And I guess I should preface this by saying we're going to have five, maybe six, and,

11:19.940 --> 11:22.500
uh, a backup or two in case anyone flakes.

11:23.140 --> 11:27.860
Uh, so there, there will not be many because this is only a 70,000 word novel and we're

11:27.860 --> 11:32.900
having ghost writers do chunks of it just so we can have a quicker turnover than it

11:32.900 --> 11:34.420
would take to actually write a novel.

11:34.420 --> 11:42.740
But basically, uh, if you can, if you think you could write 5,000 to 10,000 words in two

11:42.740 --> 11:45.460
weeks and I, four or five days of nano.

11:45.460 --> 11:46.580
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

11:46.580 --> 11:47.940
It's like four or five days of nano.

11:47.940 --> 11:49.700
If you could do a NaNoWriMo, you could do this.

11:50.020 --> 11:54.100
Please don't apply if you can't turn around 10,000 words in two weeks.

11:54.100 --> 11:55.220
And we are paying for this.

11:55.220 --> 11:58.740
We'll tell you the rate once we, uh, you know, get you on board.

11:58.740 --> 12:08.340
So the way this is going to work is you send us a writing sample at this email address

12:08.420 --> 12:12.820
that I've totally made by today.

12:15.300 --> 12:21.140
Uh, it with the contact information, your email address, a way to get in touch with

12:21.140 --> 12:28.740
you and, uh, no more than 250 word scene based on, uh, some of the scenes we've read.

12:28.740 --> 12:32.100
Just anything that you feel captures your voice.

12:32.100 --> 12:33.620
A scene involving our two leads.

12:33.620 --> 12:34.180
Yeah.

12:34.180 --> 12:36.100
Or ethnic third wheel.

12:36.100 --> 12:37.220
Or the parents.

12:37.220 --> 12:38.580
Slutty antagonists.

12:39.700 --> 12:46.020
Um, or, or cool uncle Neil or cool uncle Neil who I'd read the shit out of those.

12:46.020 --> 12:47.940
Gets the hell ignored out of him.

12:47.940 --> 12:50.180
Make the subject line 50 shades of green sample.

12:50.900 --> 12:55.300
And again, don't do this if you can't churn out 10,000 words in two weeks.

12:55.300 --> 12:57.540
And we're not going to respond to comments on our episode next week.

12:57.540 --> 12:59.140
Next week we're going to talk about location.

12:59.140 --> 13:03.140
Not really responding to comments because we're gonna spend the next two weeks, uh,

13:03.140 --> 13:06.020
wading through our, uh, samples.

13:06.020 --> 13:06.740
Mm-hmm.

13:06.740 --> 13:07.540
And, uh, so.

13:07.540 --> 13:08.580
Finalizing an outline.

13:08.580 --> 13:09.220
Yeah.

13:09.220 --> 13:10.340
Finalizing the outline.

13:10.340 --> 13:17.620
So two weeks from now we will have, uh, answers as to who we are going to bring on board and

13:17.620 --> 13:19.700
what our final outline will be.

13:19.700 --> 13:24.420
And again, remember to check for updates at shayapocalypse.com and follow us on Twitter

13:24.420 --> 13:30.260
at Shayapocalypse or at Sexy Alien Book where I retweet the funny things people say at me.

13:30.420 --> 13:35.540
And remember, friends, we do this for you, but we do this for literature.

13:36.340 --> 13:41.460
Because some things should not stand, but if they must, by God, we should at least make

13:41.460 --> 13:42.500
something from it.

13:43.540 --> 13:48.260
Something that we can look at and say, I might not be proud of it, but it might make me a

13:48.260 --> 13:49.940
few bucks on the side.

13:49.940 --> 13:51.300
And isn't that what it's all about?

13:54.420 --> 13:54.980
Wading!
