0	4240	Uh, our little intro bumper this week comes courtesy of Tone Rebellion.
4240	6240	Ahem.
6240	11920	In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits, dreaming of her.
16720	18720	So we're gonna do things a little bit different this week.
18720	22400	Uh, we'll get to the comments after we talk about the outlines.
22400	25760	Most of the comments are suggestions on name and that sort of thing.
26480	28480	So, uh, first things first.
29360	34400	Let's talk about what we've nailed down so far of the Outlaw Heads monstrosity.
35680	40080	Uh, well, the opening should definitely be of her dreaming a very literal dream.
40080	40640	Mm.
40640	43440	Um, that's gonna tell you exactly what's gonna come.
43440	44160	Um.
44160	49120	Our story proper starts in our little Innsmouth town.
49120	50640	Which is a university town.
50640	53600	Yeah, and literally everyone's parents work at the university.
53600	56320	And so the major employer of the surrounding five towns.
56320	60800	Lego, Brick, and Ethnic Third Wheel have been the best of friends for as long as they commit
60800	61440	and remember.
61440	64400	That's why she has no interest in him at all, because he's like a brother.
64400	65360	He's like a brother.
65360	70400	He inherits this family heirloom, which we later find out to be the Necronomicon, and
70400	75120	trying to impress her, he shows it to her, and she's like, well, let's fucking read it,
75120	75840	and they do.
75840	76400	Mm.
76400	80000	The next day, school starts.
80000	80560	Uh-huh.
80560	82960	And hottie McChestabs.
82960	84320	Yeah, shows up.
84320	85760	Well, not even, he doesn't even show up.
85760	89840	He's just like, he's looking at them across, like, the parking lot or something.
89840	90800	Yeah, he's just there.
90800	93520	And Ethnic Third Wheel is super threatened by him immediately.
94080	99760	So when's the point, um, that she starts having her, uh, her artistic endeavors that aren't
99760	101920	actually her ability, just force of habit?
101920	105040	I think, like, like, that night, like, after they read from it.
105040	108640	And she's, she like, maybe draws a picture of, like, this really hot guy.
108640	109140	Mm.
110160	112400	But there's a lot of monstrous stuff in the background.
112400	112900	Yeah.
113060	113860	Like, there's tentacles.
113860	115460	This is just, like, my dream.
115460	116980	Yeah, except for without the tentacles.
117540	121140	Yeah, like, she sees this really hot guy with, like, a mass of tentacles behind him, and
121140	126580	she's, like, horrified and turned on by this dream that, you know, I sleep drew.
126580	129620	Yeah, so then one day, they're, they're at, like, a pool party, because it's still hot.
129620	130820	Because it's still, you know.
130820	132980	She, she has terrible hydrophobia, by the way.
133860	134740	She hates water.
134740	138900	She, she'll even joke about, like, in a self-deprecating way that she can't even take a bath.
138900	143940	One day, we're at a pool party, and some guy, playfully being a jackass, like, pushes her in.
143940	148260	Yeah, one of her, like, pull her in with him, and be, like, dunking her, and, like,
148260	150820	threatening to, like, untie her bathing suit or something.
150820	151320	Like, super.
151320	152900	No, I don't think it should be that, that threatening.
152900	154180	I think it should be, like, innocent.
154180	154680	Okay, okay.
155540	159860	It should be just, like, he's, like, yeah, he's, like, horse-playing with her, like, come on.
159860	160340	Yeah.
160340	165620	And, and, like, immediately Cthulhu gets, like, that protective rage and just drives
165620	166420	him insane.
166420	171140	And so, like, he, you know, for the rest of his life is, like, a shrieking vegetable.
171140	171620	Yeah.
171620	173060	Which they'll blame on drugs.
173060	176340	Yeah, and, and Cthulhu, hot Cthulhu will never be held accountable.
176340	176580	Yes.
176580	179860	Lego brick will never, never be troubled by this.
179860	181300	Be like, you did this?
182340	183700	Wow, you're so powerful.
183700	184260	What are you?
185300	187780	Yeah, after this point, they need to have, like, their savior in the hospital.
187780	188100	Yeah.
188100	190980	Not in the hospital, but, like, he, he pisses her off somehow.
190980	192980	Like, he, she's, like, I know something's up with you.
192980	194420	And he's, like, you should never know.
195220	199220	Of course, but before all this, though, we're also introduced to the woman who will become
199220	202100	the villain, who we've decided should be an adult.
202100	202500	Yeah.
202500	203220	Who works at the university.
203220	204580	She's, like, an adjunct.
204580	206580	Yeah, you know, and she's, like, super hot.
206580	207300	Yeah.
207300	209780	And Lego brick is immediately threatened by how hot she is.
209780	214660	But she should be described as this beautiful, gorgeous woman who has a desperate look to
214660	215060	her eye.
215060	215540	Yeah.
215540	220580	Like, and not just because, like, she's, like, this cult leader, but also because she's a
220580	221300	woman scorned.
221300	225380	Yeah, we, like, she, she'll often be described as a woman scorned.
225380	228340	But we'll never, ever, ever say why.
228340	229060	No one will ever talk to us.
229060	229780	She might be scorned.
229780	230900	What, what, who scorned her?
232420	233620	Why she was scorned.
234420	238100	I feel like, I feel like Neil, Uncle Neil should know the story, but he never tells it.
238100	239700	Yeah, he's just like, oh, I know her.
239700	242100	I just like, that's an interesting story.
242100	244980	And then they get distracted by something else.
247460	251140	Yeah, so then she ends up at a college party, like, and of course, she, like,
251700	252580	drinks too much.
252580	255140	Like, or she doesn't realize, like, she's drinking alcohol.
255140	256580	Like, I thought this was iced tea.
256580	257540	Yeah, wow.
257540	260740	So this, I've never been to Long Island before.
261460	264340	At the college party, drinks too much, gets almost raped.
264340	264740	Yeah.
264740	267060	Cthulhu saves her from the almost rape.
267060	270420	Again, we have another blithering insanity case, which gets blamed on drugs.
270420	270900	On drugs.
270900	272420	It's mostly bath salts.
272420	273620	It gets blamed on drugs.
273620	274100	Yeah.
274100	274980	And then it's topical.
274980	278980	It'll turn into, like, 21 Jump Street, like, on a subplot that we never see.
281380	284100	And then, like, they're real, like, hardcore.
284100	289460	He, like, phantoms her and kidnaps her and takes her into, like, his, I don't know, local lair.
289460	292740	And she finds out the whole truth about the prophecy and how I don't want to devour you
292740	292980	anymore.
292980	296500	He does some really fucked up shit, like, kidnap her, holds her against her will, probably
296500	297300	holds her down.
297860	300180	She goes, no, no, no, but really, yes.
300180	300420	Yeah.
301620	305460	And so now that, and he's like, I don't want to, you know, devour your body and soul.
305460	306500	Uh, what are we gonna do?
306500	307860	We're gonna stop this prophecy.
308740	310740	So they go to Uncle Nyarlathotep.
312820	315940	I'm so excited about Uncle Nyarlathotep.
315940	321940	Special thanks to Dylan Turn for this one, uh, that, uh, Nyarlathotep, he's, like, this,
321940	323140	the most awesome character.
323140	324260	He's, like, an old hippie or something.
324260	326580	And he runs this Lovecraft basic cult shop.
326580	330340	And he talks all the time about he and Nikola Tesla would go freak out this racist cult
330340	331060	horror writer.
331060	335220	And basically people will think, why the hell is this book not about Nyarlathotep, like,
335220	335620	completely?
335620	335860	Yeah.
335860	338580	And his, like, madcap adventures, like, among humanity.
338580	341140	And he'll start, like, he'll keep alluding to them.
341140	343780	And our, our main characters with no interest at all.
343780	347700	So, or they'll, like, they'll be like, it'll be like, that's a great story.
347700	349860	So back to, like, what I love.
352100	356020	And then meanwhile, our, you know, hot villainous is a woman scorned.
356020	356420	Yes.
356420	359700	And it turns out she's the cult leader.
359700	360420	Yeah.
360420	364820	And eventually ethnic third wheel, who has been nothing but threatened by Cthulhu this
364820	365300	whole time.
365300	367140	And rightfully so, because he's a piece of fuck.
367700	373540	Shit gets real when ethnic third wheel, uh, goes to the hot cult leader and gets brainwashed.
373540	377780	He goes right away and makes a point of this, that the bad guy be portrayed as slutty and
377780	381220	have her seduce Indian third wheel to get him on their side.
381220	385860	That way we can double down on the weird sexual politics by having the main character be completely
385860	390500	passive and also slut shaming the villain and having sexually assertive women be the
390500	391220	ultimate evil.
392180	392660	Yeah.
392660	393620	Can do.
393700	398740	And so basically like the third act will be all about stopping brainwashed ethnic third
398740	404820	wheel and slutty villainous from, uh, uh, you know, using their cult powers to, uh,
404820	407700	you know, summon the greater evil, which is, I guess, Azathoth.
408900	411460	And, uh, that is our plot.
412580	416180	Let the terrible details commence.
419780	422980	The reason we're doing comment seconds is because there was a lot of little details
422980	426340	instead of big sweeping ones that we could divide by theme.
426340	428260	So let's see what we got.
428260	428980	We got a lot.
428980	430500	And again, highlights reel.
430500	432260	Sorry for people who didn't get it.
432260	435620	And it was a lot and especially the scenes, which are awesome and we love.
435620	439940	And, uh, yeah, here, here's some suggestions from Andrew Green that I like.
439940	440660	Denny F.
440660	443140	Bridge is an anagram of bitchy friend.
443700	444820	Uh, Kate S.
444820	447380	Fiddick is an anagram of bat sidekick.
447380	448900	I kind of like the Kate Fiddick.
448900	449620	Kate Fiddick.
449620	449860	Yeah.
449860	450980	It even kind of sounds fat.
450980	451460	Yeah.
451460	452660	Fat and annoying.
452740	454100	It's actually quite a pleasant character.
454100	454660	Yeah.
454660	456580	And he's actually probably the best friend you'll ever have.
456580	460660	But yeah, you know, our, yeah, our, our, our Lego brick is threatened by all.
460660	462420	We got a lot of votes for Bianca.
462420	463620	Bianca Slate.
463620	464020	Yeah.
464020	466740	And Slate is good, but Bianca Slate's a little too on the nose.
466740	467060	Yeah.
467060	468500	Same with Tabula Rasa.
468500	468820	Yeah.
468820	472580	I mean, as much as I love Bianca Slate and you love Tabula Rasa, it is just a little
472580	473300	too on the nose.
473300	476500	Well, uh, among others, um, Melodia E.
476500	481940	McIntyre wrote that Penelope, uh, the character from The Honesty is known for remaining chased,
481940	485460	waiting for her one true love while 108 men want her desperately.
485460	488580	Um, and also she could go by Penny because she hates her name.
488580	489700	Cause it's weird.
489700	492820	Um, I love the idea of it being Penelope.
492820	495380	It's the idea of waiting.
495380	495700	Yeah.
495700	496020	I like.
496020	496820	Or Rasa.
496820	497540	Or Rasa.
497540	498340	Or heart.
498900	502100	You know, cause going for a nice like soft, cause it's all about love.
502740	505700	We had a lot of funny, uh, like title ones.
505700	510100	Kalok Stevens suggests chartreuse whispers.
510100	511460	Sean Simonis.
511540	513700	I have, um, Verdant Dreams.
513700	515140	Olivine Nights.
515140	516900	As well as Malachite Visions.
516900	523700	Oh, I like the, uh, the idea of using things like, uh, uh, Verdigris or Viridian.
523700	523940	Yeah.
524740	525700	Those are good bees.
526260	531220	Gregory Loscalzo reminds us that, uh, verdigris, according to Wikipedia, is a common name for a
531220	536580	green pigment obtained through, uh, the natural patina formed when copper, brass, or bronze is
536580	537300	weathered.
537300	538500	So that could like, you know.
538500	539300	That works really well.
539860	543700	That could indicate that we have no idea what this word verdigris actually means.
543700	543860	Yeah.
544500	547780	I, uh, I like the idea of at least one of the chapters being undertow.
549300	550500	And submerged.
550500	553060	Dark Waters suggests Bethany Hough.
554020	555140	Could be a good one.
555140	561700	Laura Backus suggests, uh, Rain of Darkness, Dark Fate, Book of Fate, Low Tide, Riptide.
561700	562420	Dark Waters.
562980	568580	Elizabeth Smith suggested Love Lies Dreaming, possibly followed by sequels Love Awakens
568580	569220	and so on.
570020	576420	I was noticing a lot of comments, um, for example, from Jet Black that, um, like Cthulhu
576420	579460	as being part of the swim team as being a thing.
579460	584020	And while that would be hilarious, I think the problem with that is that that actually
584020	585060	makes him too social.
585060	586340	Yeah, a little too jockey.
586340	586740	I think he's like.
586740	587940	Active in the community.
587940	591540	Yeah, it's like, well, the thing is, it's like, Edward is so super powerful.
591540	594660	Like Christian Grey is obviously, like, very active.
594660	595140	Yeah.
595140	596820	But in solitary ways.
596820	599460	Yeah, we want an angel from Buffy.
599460	600820	We don't want a Riley.
600820	605620	Although we had, yeah, we, we, we did have a lot of suggestions that Hot Cthulhu's name
605620	606900	is Riley.
606900	608340	Like, Ru-ya.
608340	609460	However, that's pronounced.
609460	609780	Yeah.
609780	610820	Ru-ya.
610820	612100	Which I think is a great idea.
612100	613460	I really like Riley.
613460	619540	Jamie of Needs More Gay Fame, uh, suggested Sonya Slate as the protagonist.
619540	625940	Um, we liked the idea of, um, Lego Bricks mom and dad being named Sonya and Howard after
625940	628020	H.P. and his wife, Sonya.
628020	632740	Dr. Rice suggested that, uh, we got some sort of ominous catchphrase that the cult keeps
632740	634020	saying that never gets explained.
634020	637140	Like, this is the twilight of the universe or something.
637140	637460	Yes.
638340	638900	Can do.
640020	644340	Another one from Dylan Turn that, uh, Hot Cthulhu, whenever she's having those dreams,
644340	646820	it's actually him possessing her body.
646820	649620	And she likes it because he's always inside her.
650340	653620	It's like I, I was using you and she's like, but I liked it.
656100	657540	So good job, internet.
658500	668740	We're about to the point where we can start, uh, accepting applications for, uh, our ghost
668740	669220	riders.
674340	679940	And I guess I should preface this by saying we're going to have five, maybe six, and,
679940	682500	uh, a backup or two in case anyone flakes.
683140	687860	Uh, so there, there will not be many because this is only a 70,000 word novel and we're
687860	692900	having ghost writers do chunks of it just so we can have a quicker turnover than it
692900	694420	would take to actually write a novel.
694420	702740	But basically, uh, if you can, if you think you could write 5,000 to 10,000 words in two
702740	705460	weeks and I, four or five days of nano.
705460	706580	Yeah, yeah, exactly.
706580	707940	It's like four or five days of nano.
707940	709700	If you could do a NaNoWriMo, you could do this.
710020	714100	Please don't apply if you can't turn around 10,000 words in two weeks.
714100	715220	And we are paying for this.
715220	718740	We'll tell you the rate once we, uh, you know, get you on board.
718740	728340	So the way this is going to work is you send us a writing sample at this email address
728420	732820	that I've totally made by today.
735300	741140	Uh, it with the contact information, your email address, a way to get in touch with
741140	748740	you and, uh, no more than 250 word scene based on, uh, some of the scenes we've read.
748740	752100	Just anything that you feel captures your voice.
752100	753620	A scene involving our two leads.
753620	754180	Yeah.
754180	756100	Or ethnic third wheel.
756100	757220	Or the parents.
757220	758580	Slutty antagonists.
759700	766020	Um, or, or cool uncle Neil or cool uncle Neil who I'd read the shit out of those.
766020	767940	Gets the hell ignored out of him.
767940	770180	Make the subject line 50 shades of green sample.
770900	775300	And again, don't do this if you can't churn out 10,000 words in two weeks.
775300	777540	And we're not going to respond to comments on our episode next week.
777540	779140	Next week we're going to talk about location.
779140	783140	Not really responding to comments because we're gonna spend the next two weeks, uh,
783140	786020	wading through our, uh, samples.
786020	786740	Mm-hmm.
786740	787540	And, uh, so.
787540	788580	Finalizing an outline.
788580	789220	Yeah.
789220	790340	Finalizing the outline.
790340	797620	So two weeks from now we will have, uh, answers as to who we are going to bring on board and
797620	799700	what our final outline will be.
799700	804420	And again, remember to check for updates at shayapocalypse.com and follow us on Twitter
804420	810260	at Shayapocalypse or at Sexy Alien Book where I retweet the funny things people say at me.
810420	815540	And remember, friends, we do this for you, but we do this for literature.
816340	821460	Because some things should not stand, but if they must, by God, we should at least make
821460	822500	something from it.
823540	828260	Something that we can look at and say, I might not be proud of it, but it might make me a
828260	829940	few bucks on the side.
829940	831300	And isn't that what it's all about?
834420	834980	Wading!
