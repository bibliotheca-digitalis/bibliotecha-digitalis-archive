1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
In Ronald Reagan's first speech as president in 1981, he famously said,

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:12,160
In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,280
Before 1984, American television stations were closely regulated,

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,320
and the promotion of any product within the body of a TV show was forbidden by the Federal Communications Commission.

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,320
All that changed under the Reagan administration in 1984,

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,800
when children's television was deregulated as part of a wider bid to boost the American economy.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,320
Around this time, a Japanese toy company called Takara Tomy was enjoying success in Japan

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,840
with several lines of transforming robot toys, including Diaclone

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,880
Diaclone

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,840
and Microman

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,520
Microman

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,840
Spying opportunity with this new deregulation,

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,400
effectively allowing children's television shows to act as commercials for toys,

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,680
American toy giant Hasbro licensed both of these toy lines into a new American brand known as The Transformers,

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,200
and sped into production a cartoon to promote the new toy line, which premiered in September of 1984.

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,440
Although the quality of children's television of this era is notoriously low, if not extremely high on camp,

17
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,880
You tin-tongued dolt! I'm talking about my patience, not my body!

18
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,000
Amazing. A booby trap that actually catches boobies.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,960
Ah, just what everybody needs, a magical island holiday.

20
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,840
I could write a book about what you don't know!

21
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,840
You disgust me.

22
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,840
Hey man, are you alright?

23
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,680
Just must my hair.

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,240
The effects of this change in regulation laws and media targeting children reverberates to this day.

25
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,640
Children's programming is only put into production with a mind to how well it will sell merchandise.

26
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,360
And yes, we can consider a toy, a cartoon, a comic, a whatever, a piece of art.

27
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,720
The Transformers was most definitely art.

28
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,920
You are either lying or you're stupid!

29
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,120
I'm stupid! I'm stupid!

30
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,800
But that piece of art is still used primarily for the calculated push towards profit maximization.

31
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:07,240
The trend since that deregulation in the mid-1980s has seen the profits of these giant corporations go more and more to the top 1% of earners.

32
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,920
Income inequality was a reality in the mid-80s, it is a much bigger reality now.

33
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,040
And if we live in a capitalist society where wealth equals power,

34
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,280
and the way wealth is distributed and who controls the means of production,

35
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:24,280
then what gets made and consumed, especially media that targets children who are not yet old enough to question power structures,

36
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,880
is an important question.

37
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,120
Who controls the means of production?

38
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,800
Who benefits from that control?

39
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,720
Some might even say it is in the best interest of the masses to...

40
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,480
seize the means of production.

41
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,000
Oh boy!

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I don't play.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't play.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't play.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't play.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I don't play.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Today we're talking about Transformers, Marxism, and film theory.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The least complicated topic I've ever decided to tackle.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Sweet Jesus, why did I choose this?

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Marxism. That topic you think you know about because...

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
certain YouTube intellectuals screaming about how Marxism is directly opposed to Western values is so hot right now.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So at the risk of pissing everyone off, both on the right and on the left,

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'll preface by admitting that I am not an expert on Marxist critical theory.

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I have an MFA in film and television, not a PhD in Derrida studies.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But I know enough about Marxism to know that it's really too complex a theoretical framework to satisfactorily scratch the surface in a 15-20 minute YouTube video about Transformers and film theory.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But this is a survey, not a comprehensive lecture, so...

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Where do we start?

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The barest bones reduction of classical Marxism is that capitalism is bad because it's exploitative.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Because a portion of the value that the worker creates goes to the owner.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
In America, a huge portion.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Therefore the worker is not paid the full value of her work.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But Marxism is also highly concerned with the masses.

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
How information is disseminated.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
How values are shaped.

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Who shapes them.

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Who has the power.

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And ultimately, how groups of people are controlled and coerced into buying into this unjust system.

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This makes Marxist theoretical frameworks particularly of interest to film theorists, and especially relevant to the Transformers movies.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
We'll get to that.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
One popular misconception is conflating Marxism with communism.

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Well, technically communism is the inevitable outcome of Marxism, so it's sort of a distinction without a difference.

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Well, I get that.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But what I mean is, in America, when people hear the word communism, they usually think of the totalitarian brand exemplified by Stalin.

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Well, like I said, I'm no expert, so go ahead, school me.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Well, it's true that there's a Western tradition of Marxist theory that's more academic than revolutionary.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You've got your Hegelian Marxists, your Freudian Marxists, your critical theorists, your situationists, your Marxist humanists,

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
your analytic Marxists, your postmodern neo-Marxists.

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You know, you gotta read Kojev, Benjamin, Marcuse, Althusser, Lukács, Gramsci, Rancière.

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You have read Rancière, haven't you?

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Totally.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
An undergrad.

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So moving on, Marxism and Stalinism are not the same thing, but this is a useful opportunity to delve into the difference between theory and praxis.

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Marxism is a form of theory.

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Theory is the thought framework, a means of interpretation, and in this context, a means of predicting sociological trends and interpreting them.

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Praxis is the real-world execution of that theory.

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
In this case, usually it would be activism.

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
For instance, enacting the ideology of Stalinism in the real world is a form of praxis.

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Not a good one.

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
There are those who defend it, but we're not going to go there.

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So giving a Marxist reading on any given text is de facto incomplete as there are many Marxist schools of thought,

91
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
just as there are many feminist schools of thought.

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Marxists disagree with each other constantly, believe it or not.

93
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So to keep this simple, we are going to pick the framework of a Marxist theoretical theorist who is very important and just go with that.

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Let's spin the wheel of Marxist discourse.

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Who's it gonna be? Who's gonna tell us how to interpret the Transformies?

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay, Adorno, good enough.

97
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno were members of the Frankfurt School,

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
which was associated in part with the Institute for Social Research at the Goethe University Frankfurt.

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And ultimately, we today might consider them the daddies of critical theory.

100
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
They were far ahead of their time in that they saw media as a potential lens to culture,

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
how cultures develop, self-reflect, and propagate values,

102
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
ideas that wouldn't take hold in mainstream academia and critical studies until the 1960s and 70s,

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
largely thanks to the works of these guys.

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Adorno was the most pessimistic, so it's a good thing we chose him.

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I ate the whole plate.

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Sam, I gotta run.

107
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yeah.

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Deep wang. Deep wang. You're not getting it.

109
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Say my name. Say my name.

110
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You want those new teeth you saw in Skymall?

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's my dream!

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The whole plate.

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
For Adorno, film was too close to mass culture, and its spectators were in turn too close to it,

114
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
too integrated to its effects and manipulations.

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
With Horkheimer, Adorno produced the blistering Dialectic of Enlightenment in 1944 after they fled to the US,

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
pinning a devastating indictment on the integration of film into capitalist industrial production

117
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
and consumption into what Adorno and Horkheimer describe as the culture industry.

118
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
According to Adorno and Horkheimer, all mass culture under Monopoly is identical,

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and the contours of its skeleton, the conceptual armature fabricated by Monopoly, are beginning to stand out.

120
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The truth that they are nothing but business is used as an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce.

121
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
A jazz musician who has to play a piece of serious music, Beethoven's simplest minuet, involunteer-

122
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Wait a minute. Why does this guy hate jazz so much? Anyway, moving on.

123
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Adorno saw film as almost analogous to the way Marx saw religion,

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
what he famously called the sigh of the oppressed creature,

125
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
the heart of a heartless world and the soul of a soulless condition.

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It is the opium of the people.

127
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Adorno saw the film industry as a mass organized machine designed to salve the masses and to keep them obedient.

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
According to Adorno and Horkheimer, amusement always means putting things out of mind,

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
forgetting suffering, even when it's on display.

130
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
At its root is powerlessness.

131
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It is indeed escape, but not, as it claims, escape from bad reality,

132
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
but from the last thought of resisting that reality.

133
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Existence in late capitalism is a permanent rite of initiation.

134
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Everyone must show that they identify wholeheartedly with the power which beats them.

135
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
This is inherent in the principle of syncopation and jazz,

136
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
which mocks the act of stumbling while elevating it to the nor-

137
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Okay, dude.

138
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
In effect, late-stage capitalism is sad,

139
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and a part of the media-industrial complex's function is to provide a distraction

140
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
from the fact that you are fundamentally being exploited.

141
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So, you watch Transformers,

142
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
movies which nobody likes but pings that nostalgia center of your brain

143
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
just enough that it distracts you from the void for approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes,

144
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
depending on which one you're watching.

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And that is the culture industry.

146
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
An important aspect of the escapism provided by the culture industry

147
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
is the representation of the self,

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
the ur-audience member both elevated and denigrated in the form of the leading man,

149
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
i.e. Sam Witwicky,

150
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm not talking to you for 10 seconds. You have 3 seconds left.

151
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You know what? You can give me the silent treatment all you want.

152
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and Cade Yeager.

153
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Hey, you know, there's a reward for turning you in.

154
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Really? Yeah.

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Cool. You want to get punched in the face like really hard?

156
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The ideology does, it is true, make life initially easier for the spectators.

157
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
They are assured that they do not need to be in any way other than they are,

158
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
and that they can succeed just as well without having to perform tasks

159
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
of which they know themselves incapable.

160
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
At the same time, they are given the hint that the effort would not help them in any case,

161
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
because even bourgeois success no longer has any connection

162
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
to the calculable effect of their own work.

163
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Because of his ubiquity, the film star with whom one is supposed to fall in love

164
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
is, from the start, a copy of himself.

165
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Every tenor now sounds like a Caruso record,

166
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
and the natural faces of Texas girls already resemble those of the established models

167
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
by which they would be typecast in Hollywood.

168
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What is repeated is healthy, the cycle in nature, as in the industry.

169
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The same babies grin endlessly from magazines,

170
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
and endlessly the jazz machine pounds...

171
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Okay, we're done here.

172
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That's enough theoretical framework from Teodoro Dorno, hater of jazz.

173
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm gonna do my own damn Marxist reading.

174
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
First, let's ignore the culture industry,

175
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
i.e. the forces that went into the creation of the text,

176
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
and talk about what's in the text itself.

177
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Interpreting text is the most basic form of film studies,

178
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and mostly ignores other influences, i.e. real-world markets

179
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
that may have led to the thing existing in the first place.

180
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
This is simply the study of the text.

181
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Bumblebee peeing on John Turturro is a part of the text.

182
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It is a thing that happens in the story,

183
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
independent of all things that went into the creation of the text.

184
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The character of Bumblebee hears what Agent Turturro says...

185
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Brave now, all of a sudden, with his big alien friend standing over there.

186
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Decides he needs to be put in his place, and pees on him.

187
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm sorry, lubricates him,

188
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and swivels his little robot hips as he does so.

189
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
This is all text.

190
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So, what does the text have to say about capitalism?

191
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
While on the whole the series remains uninterested in a critique of capitalism,

192
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
there are parts of the text that are strangely anti-capitalist,

193
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
and this is actually a major trend in Hollywood movies,

194
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
where the villains are capitalists,

195
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
in spite of the fact that Hollywood as a system is a monopoly capitalist sweat dream.

196
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I drink your milkshake!

197
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Transformers 4 frames Cade Yeager as a down-on-his-luck inventor.

198
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm an inventor!

199
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
He is an entrepreneur, but appears to work off a barter system?

200
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Contrast him with Stanley Tucci's character Joshua Joyce in Transformers 4.

201
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Transformium. That's what we're calling it.

202
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Focus group. Catchy. Trademarked.

203
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Not, of course, to be confused with Stanley Tucci's portrayal of Merlin in Transformers 5.

204
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Oh, God, I'm sozzled.

205
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
One last nip.

206
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Joyce is a thinly-veiled Steve Jobs-alike whose methods are inherently exploitative.

207
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Programmable matter.

208
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And now we've mapped its genome.

209
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Now you've mapped its genome.

210
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And I was in charge of autopsy duty.

211
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
No union, no benefits, no nothing.

212
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
He steals technology that is not his.

213
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And moreover, he steals technology from the dead bodies of Transformers.

214
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
This is not legal. This is illegal experimentation.

215
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And not just Decepticons, either.

216
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The movie goes out of its way to show that the medic Ratchet from the first movie,

217
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
you know, the guy that said this,

218
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The boy's pheromone levels suggest he wants to mate with the female.

219
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
is having his corpse vandalized.

220
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
They're melting Ratchet.

221
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And that Optimus Prime is really mad about this.

222
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
They slaughtered Ratchet.

223
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm gonna tear them apart.

224
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
In the very same scene where we are getting to learn of Steve Jobs' exploitative villainy,

225
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
boom, product placement.

226
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You like music?

227
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The pill.

228
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And the ironic thing about Age of Extinction,

229
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
the one text of the five movies that is most critical of capitalism,

230
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
is also the most explicit in its product placement.

231
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Insurance?

232
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's a freaking spaceship.

233
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's your car?

234
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Huh?

235
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But there is another form of product placement in these films

236
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
that would also be of interest to the attentive Marxist.

237
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
See, the attentive Marxist is less interested in the text itself

238
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
than in the function of the text.

239
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What values is it encouraging?

240
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What is it trying to sell you?

241
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And the answer to that is, of course, much more than meets the eye.

242
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Sorry.

243
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The answer is much more complex than a series of films designed to sell toys and place products.

244
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And that is where the aesthetics of advertising comes in.

245
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
If the primary intent of these films was to sell product

246
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
and elevate brand name recognition, namely, of the Transformers toy line,

247
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
then Michael Bay was the perfect choice to direct these five movies,

248
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
for a variety of reasons.

249
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The first being his history as a director of commercials and music videos.

250
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Commercials as advertisements for products.

251
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You know, it's pretty good beer.

252
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And music videos being advertisements for albums.

253
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Both are pieces of art unto themselves.

254
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Bay's iconic Got Milk commercial from the 90s is remembered for a reason.

255
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm sorry. Maybe next time.

256
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
But these are pieces of art whose mere existence is dependent on their function as advertising.

257
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So, to bring it back around to Professor Jazz Hater,

258
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
that is the triumph of advertising in the culture industry.

259
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The compulsive imitation by consumers of cultural commodities,

260
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
which, at the same time, they recognize as false.

261
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
But Bay is advertising far more than just toys with these films.

262
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Hollywood has long held a mutually beneficial relationship with the Pentagon

263
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
in which the Department of Defense provides information and equipment to certain productions

264
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
provided that they effectively function as a taxpayer-subsidized military recruitment ad.

265
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Not all Hollywood films make the cut.

266
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The Avengers was famously denied these subsidies

267
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
when the text was not deemed by the Pentagon as, shall we say, helpful to their recruitment efforts.

268
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
According to academic Toby Miller,

269
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
as for propaganda, the state and the film industry have often worked together.

270
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
In the embarrassingly macho language of the U.S. political science,

271
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
the media represents soft power to match the hard power of the military and the economy.

272
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
The military offering their equipment, time, and manpower is nothing new.

273
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What is new is the type of movie they lend their resources to.

274
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
No longer are the biggest projects real-life stories about soldiers and heroism,

275
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
now they just as often involve an alien invasion,

276
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
with a military subplot thrown in as an afterthought, an advertisement even,

277
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
which are then later tied in with a literal recruitment campaign.

278
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Recent high-profile examples include the Transformers movies,

279
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Man of Steel, and Independence Day Resurgence.

280
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yeah, that went well.

281
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Transformers movies use the cinematic language of capitalism

282
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
both to safely critique a fictionalized brand of capitalism,

283
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
the girly, effete, non-manly Steve Jobs kind,

284
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Tactical nuke.

285
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
LOL.

286
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Oh my god!

287
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
while using that same language to actually promote the state's agenda.

288
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And one more important note about Tucci's character.

289
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
He exploits dead Autobots innocently,

290
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
but only with encouragement from corrupt government agencies.

291
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
In fact, Tucci is redeemed at the end, despite his misdeeds,

292
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
where the real bad guy, a government agent played by Kelsey,

293
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
yep-he's-here-too grammar,

294
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and founder of CIA faction Cemetery Wind,

295
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Cemetery Wind.

296
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
is shot in the back by Optimus Prime, our hero.

297
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
In the end, in the words of Ronald Reagan,

298
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Government is not the solution to our problem.

299
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Sometimes it is in the interest of the state to push this ideology,

300
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and the Transformers movies have been all too eager to oblige.

301
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So, I want to bring it back around to Professor Jazz Hater for a minute.

302
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You like jazz?

303
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Normally, I wouldn't feel the need to explain this,

304
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
but this is a series for YouTube, not for the classroom.

305
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
When one explains a theoretical framework

306
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
and applies it to a text,

307
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
that isn't necessarily the same thing as agreeing with that framework.

308
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's just showing that you understand it.

309
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I say this because I don't want my interpreting Adorno's position for Transformers

310
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
to mean that I think that all products of the culture industry

311
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
are meaningless and exist to cram some fleeting complacence in your life

312
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
so you don't get utterly sucked into the void.

313
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
If that was true, then how could I possibly justify

314
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
all these star screams I seem to own?

315
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It makes me happy!

316
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
But there is a big problem in nerd communities

317
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
with coming to terms with the fact that a product they kind of love

318
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
only exists for gross, hyper-capitalistic, Reagan-y reasons.

319
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Personally, I do not care.

320
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I buy my star screams, I read my comics,

321
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
and I can still talk about the fact that this series only exists

322
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
due to deregulation designed to target children and benefit big businesses.

323
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I personally do not ascribe to Adorno's black-and-white worldview

324
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
that the culture industry produces only trash

325
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
and you only stuff your face with it

326
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
because you are trying to fill a bottomless emptiness with no name.

327
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
To concede to this viewpoint is to posit that Hollywood is incapable

328
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
of producing art with any sort of meaning,

329
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
and that's just not a position I can get behind.

330
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Plus, I just don't think I can trust the taste of a guy who hates jazz that much.

331
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
But, and this is if you ignore Bayes' movies,

332
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
which do, I think, fit into Adorno's definition of trash,

333
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
it is also not fair to say that nothing good or artistic
