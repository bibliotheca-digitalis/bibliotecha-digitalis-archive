00:00.000 --> 00:04.440
In Ronald Reagan's first speech as president in 1981, he famously said,

00:04.440 --> 00:12.160
In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem.

00:12.160 --> 00:16.280
Before 1984, American television stations were closely regulated,

00:16.280 --> 00:21.320
and the promotion of any product within the body of a TV show was forbidden by the Federal Communications Commission.

00:21.320 --> 00:24.320
All that changed under the Reagan administration in 1984,

00:24.320 --> 00:28.800
when children's television was deregulated as part of a wider bid to boost the American economy.

00:28.800 --> 00:33.320
Around this time, a Japanese toy company called Takara Tomy was enjoying success in Japan

00:33.320 --> 00:36.840
with several lines of transforming robot toys, including Diaclone

00:36.840 --> 00:40.880
Diaclone

00:40.880 --> 00:41.840
and Microman

00:41.840 --> 00:45.520
Microman

00:45.520 --> 00:47.840
Spying opportunity with this new deregulation,

00:47.840 --> 00:51.400
effectively allowing children's television shows to act as commercials for toys,

00:51.400 --> 00:57.680
American toy giant Hasbro licensed both of these toy lines into a new American brand known as The Transformers,

00:57.680 --> 01:03.200
and sped into production a cartoon to promote the new toy line, which premiered in September of 1984.

01:03.200 --> 01:08.440
Although the quality of children's television of this era is notoriously low, if not extremely high on camp,

01:08.440 --> 01:12.880
You tin-tongued dolt! I'm talking about my patience, not my body!

01:12.880 --> 01:17.000
Amazing. A booby trap that actually catches boobies.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.960
Ah, just what everybody needs, a magical island holiday.

01:20.960 --> 01:23.840
I could write a book about what you don't know!

01:23.840 --> 01:27.840
You disgust me.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.840
Hey man, are you alright?

01:29.840 --> 01:31.680
Just must my hair.

01:31.680 --> 01:36.240
The effects of this change in regulation laws and media targeting children reverberates to this day.

01:36.240 --> 01:40.640
Children's programming is only put into production with a mind to how well it will sell merchandise.

01:40.640 --> 01:45.360
And yes, we can consider a toy, a cartoon, a comic, a whatever, a piece of art.

01:45.360 --> 01:47.720
The Transformers was most definitely art.

01:47.720 --> 01:51.920
You are either lying or you're stupid!

01:51.960 --> 01:55.120
I'm stupid! I'm stupid!

01:55.120 --> 01:59.800
But that piece of art is still used primarily for the calculated push towards profit maximization.

01:59.800 --> 02:07.240
The trend since that deregulation in the mid-1980s has seen the profits of these giant corporations go more and more to the top 1% of earners.

02:07.240 --> 02:11.920
Income inequality was a reality in the mid-80s, it is a much bigger reality now.

02:11.920 --> 02:15.040
And if we live in a capitalist society where wealth equals power,

02:15.040 --> 02:18.280
and the way wealth is distributed and who controls the means of production,

02:18.280 --> 02:24.280
then what gets made and consumed, especially media that targets children who are not yet old enough to question power structures,

02:24.280 --> 02:25.880
is an important question.

02:25.880 --> 02:28.120
Who controls the means of production?

02:28.120 --> 02:29.800
Who benefits from that control?

02:29.800 --> 02:33.720
Some might even say it is in the best interest of the masses to...

02:33.720 --> 02:37.480
seize the means of production.

02:37.480 --> 02:39.000
Oh boy!

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
I don't play.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
I don't play.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
I don't play.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
I don't play.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
I don't play.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
Today we're talking about Transformers, Marxism, and film theory.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
The least complicated topic I've ever decided to tackle.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Sweet Jesus, why did I choose this?

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
Marxism. That topic you think you know about because...

02:58.000 --> 03:06.000
certain YouTube intellectuals screaming about how Marxism is directly opposed to Western values is so hot right now.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
So at the risk of pissing everyone off, both on the right and on the left,

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
I'll preface by admitting that I am not an expert on Marxist critical theory.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
I have an MFA in film and television, not a PhD in Derrida studies.

03:24.000 --> 03:36.000
But I know enough about Marxism to know that it's really too complex a theoretical framework to satisfactorily scratch the surface in a 15-20 minute YouTube video about Transformers and film theory.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
But this is a survey, not a comprehensive lecture, so...

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Where do we start?

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
The barest bones reduction of classical Marxism is that capitalism is bad because it's exploitative.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Because a portion of the value that the worker creates goes to the owner.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
In America, a huge portion.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Therefore the worker is not paid the full value of her work.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
But Marxism is also highly concerned with the masses.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
How information is disseminated.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
How values are shaped.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Who shapes them.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Who has the power.

04:04.000 --> 04:10.000
And ultimately, how groups of people are controlled and coerced into buying into this unjust system.

04:10.000 --> 04:17.000
This makes Marxist theoretical frameworks particularly of interest to film theorists, and especially relevant to the Transformers movies.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
We'll get to that.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
One popular misconception is conflating Marxism with communism.

04:22.000 --> 04:29.000
Well, technically communism is the inevitable outcome of Marxism, so it's sort of a distinction without a difference.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Well, I get that.

04:30.000 --> 04:37.000
But what I mean is, in America, when people hear the word communism, they usually think of the totalitarian brand exemplified by Stalin.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Well, like I said, I'm no expert, so go ahead, school me.

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
Well, it's true that there's a Western tradition of Marxist theory that's more academic than revolutionary.

04:46.000 --> 04:54.000
You've got your Hegelian Marxists, your Freudian Marxists, your critical theorists, your situationists, your Marxist humanists,

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
your analytic Marxists, your postmodern neo-Marxists.

04:58.000 --> 05:06.000
You know, you gotta read Kojev, Benjamin, Marcuse, Althusser, Lukács, Gramsci, Rancière.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
You have read Rancière, haven't you?

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Totally.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
An undergrad.

05:14.000 --> 05:22.000
So moving on, Marxism and Stalinism are not the same thing, but this is a useful opportunity to delve into the difference between theory and praxis.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Marxism is a form of theory.

05:24.000 --> 05:31.000
Theory is the thought framework, a means of interpretation, and in this context, a means of predicting sociological trends and interpreting them.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Praxis is the real-world execution of that theory.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
In this case, usually it would be activism.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
For instance, enacting the ideology of Stalinism in the real world is a form of praxis.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Not a good one.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
There are those who defend it, but we're not going to go there.

05:47.000 --> 05:53.000
So giving a Marxist reading on any given text is de facto incomplete as there are many Marxist schools of thought,

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
just as there are many feminist schools of thought.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
Marxists disagree with each other constantly, believe it or not.

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
So to keep this simple, we are going to pick the framework of a Marxist theoretical theorist who is very important and just go with that.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
Let's spin the wheel of Marxist discourse.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
Who's it gonna be? Who's gonna tell us how to interpret the Transformies?

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Okay, Adorno, good enough.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno were members of the Frankfurt School,

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
which was associated in part with the Institute for Social Research at the Goethe University Frankfurt.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
And ultimately, we today might consider them the daddies of critical theory.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
They were far ahead of their time in that they saw media as a potential lens to culture,

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
how cultures develop, self-reflect, and propagate values,

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
ideas that wouldn't take hold in mainstream academia and critical studies until the 1960s and 70s,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
largely thanks to the works of these guys.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Adorno was the most pessimistic, so it's a good thing we chose him.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
I ate the whole plate.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Sam, I gotta run.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Yeah.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
Deep wang. Deep wang. You're not getting it.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Say my name. Say my name.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
You want those new teeth you saw in Skymall?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
It's my dream!

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
The whole plate.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
For Adorno, film was too close to mass culture, and its spectators were in turn too close to it,

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
too integrated to its effects and manipulations.

07:10.000 --> 07:16.000
With Horkheimer, Adorno produced the blistering Dialectic of Enlightenment in 1944 after they fled to the US,

07:16.000 --> 07:21.000
pinning a devastating indictment on the integration of film into capitalist industrial production

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
and consumption into what Adorno and Horkheimer describe as the culture industry.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
According to Adorno and Horkheimer, all mass culture under Monopoly is identical,

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
and the contours of its skeleton, the conceptual armature fabricated by Monopoly, are beginning to stand out.

07:35.000 --> 07:41.000
The truth that they are nothing but business is used as an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce.

07:41.000 --> 07:47.000
A jazz musician who has to play a piece of serious music, Beethoven's simplest minuet, involunteer-

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
Wait a minute. Why does this guy hate jazz so much? Anyway, moving on.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
Adorno saw film as almost analogous to the way Marx saw religion,

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
what he famously called the sigh of the oppressed creature,

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
the heart of a heartless world and the soul of a soulless condition.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
It is the opium of the people.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
Adorno saw the film industry as a mass organized machine designed to salve the masses and to keep them obedient.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
According to Adorno and Horkheimer, amusement always means putting things out of mind,

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
forgetting suffering, even when it's on display.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
At its root is powerlessness.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
It is indeed escape, but not, as it claims, escape from bad reality,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
but from the last thought of resisting that reality.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
Existence in late capitalism is a permanent rite of initiation.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
Everyone must show that they identify wholeheartedly with the power which beats them.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
This is inherent in the principle of syncopation and jazz,

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
which mocks the act of stumbling while elevating it to the nor-

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Okay, dude.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
In effect, late-stage capitalism is sad,

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
and a part of the media-industrial complex's function is to provide a distraction

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
from the fact that you are fundamentally being exploited.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
So, you watch Transformers,

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
movies which nobody likes but pings that nostalgia center of your brain

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
just enough that it distracts you from the void for approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes,

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
depending on which one you're watching.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
And that is the culture industry.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
An important aspect of the escapism provided by the culture industry

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
is the representation of the self,

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
the ur-audience member both elevated and denigrated in the form of the leading man,

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
i.e. Sam Witwicky,

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
I'm not talking to you for 10 seconds. You have 3 seconds left.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
You know what? You can give me the silent treatment all you want.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
and Cade Yeager.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Hey, you know, there's a reward for turning you in.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Really? Yeah.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Cool. You want to get punched in the face like really hard?

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
The ideology does, it is true, make life initially easier for the spectators.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
They are assured that they do not need to be in any way other than they are,

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
and that they can succeed just as well without having to perform tasks

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
of which they know themselves incapable.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
At the same time, they are given the hint that the effort would not help them in any case,

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
because even bourgeois success no longer has any connection

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
to the calculable effect of their own work.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Because of his ubiquity, the film star with whom one is supposed to fall in love

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
is, from the start, a copy of himself.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Every tenor now sounds like a Caruso record,

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
and the natural faces of Texas girls already resemble those of the established models

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
by which they would be typecast in Hollywood.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
What is repeated is healthy, the cycle in nature, as in the industry.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
The same babies grin endlessly from magazines,

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
and endlessly the jazz machine pounds...

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Okay, we're done here.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
That's enough theoretical framework from Teodoro Dorno, hater of jazz.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
I'm gonna do my own damn Marxist reading.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
First, let's ignore the culture industry,

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
i.e. the forces that went into the creation of the text,

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
and talk about what's in the text itself.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
Interpreting text is the most basic form of film studies,

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
and mostly ignores other influences, i.e. real-world markets

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
that may have led to the thing existing in the first place.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
This is simply the study of the text.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
Bumblebee peeing on John Turturro is a part of the text.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
It is a thing that happens in the story,

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
independent of all things that went into the creation of the text.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
The character of Bumblebee hears what Agent Turturro says...

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Brave now, all of a sudden, with his big alien friend standing over there.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Decides he needs to be put in his place, and pees on him.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
I'm sorry, lubricates him,

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
and swivels his little robot hips as he does so.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
This is all text.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
So, what does the text have to say about capitalism?

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
While on the whole the series remains uninterested in a critique of capitalism,

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
there are parts of the text that are strangely anti-capitalist,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
and this is actually a major trend in Hollywood movies,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
where the villains are capitalists,

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
in spite of the fact that Hollywood as a system is a monopoly capitalist sweat dream.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
I drink your milkshake!

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Transformers 4 frames Cade Yeager as a down-on-his-luck inventor.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I'm an inventor!

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
He is an entrepreneur, but appears to work off a barter system?

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
Contrast him with Stanley Tucci's character Joshua Joyce in Transformers 4.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Transformium. That's what we're calling it.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Focus group. Catchy. Trademarked.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
Not, of course, to be confused with Stanley Tucci's portrayal of Merlin in Transformers 5.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
Oh, God, I'm sozzled.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
One last nip.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
Joyce is a thinly-veiled Steve Jobs-alike whose methods are inherently exploitative.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Programmable matter.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
And now we've mapped its genome.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Now you've mapped its genome.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
And I was in charge of autopsy duty.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
No union, no benefits, no nothing.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
He steals technology that is not his.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
And moreover, he steals technology from the dead bodies of Transformers.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
This is not legal. This is illegal experimentation.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
And not just Decepticons, either.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
The movie goes out of its way to show that the medic Ratchet from the first movie,

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
you know, the guy that said this,

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
The boy's pheromone levels suggest he wants to mate with the female.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
is having his corpse vandalized.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
They're melting Ratchet.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
And that Optimus Prime is really mad about this.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
They slaughtered Ratchet.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
I'm gonna tear them apart.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
In the very same scene where we are getting to learn of Steve Jobs' exploitative villainy,

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
boom, product placement.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
You like music?

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
The pill.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
And the ironic thing about Age of Extinction,

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
the one text of the five movies that is most critical of capitalism,

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
is also the most explicit in its product placement.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Insurance?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
It's a freaking spaceship.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
It's your car?

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Huh?

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
But there is another form of product placement in these films

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
that would also be of interest to the attentive Marxist.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
See, the attentive Marxist is less interested in the text itself

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
than in the function of the text.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
What values is it encouraging?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
What is it trying to sell you?

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
And the answer to that is, of course, much more than meets the eye.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Sorry.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
The answer is much more complex than a series of films designed to sell toys and place products.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
And that is where the aesthetics of advertising comes in.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
If the primary intent of these films was to sell product

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
and elevate brand name recognition, namely, of the Transformers toy line,

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
then Michael Bay was the perfect choice to direct these five movies,

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
for a variety of reasons.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
The first being his history as a director of commercials and music videos.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Commercials as advertisements for products.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
You know, it's pretty good beer.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
And music videos being advertisements for albums.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Both are pieces of art unto themselves.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
Bay's iconic Got Milk commercial from the 90s is remembered for a reason.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
I'm sorry. Maybe next time.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
But these are pieces of art whose mere existence is dependent on their function as advertising.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
So, to bring it back around to Professor Jazz Hater,

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
that is the triumph of advertising in the culture industry.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
The compulsive imitation by consumers of cultural commodities,

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
which, at the same time, they recognize as false.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
But Bay is advertising far more than just toys with these films.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
Hollywood has long held a mutually beneficial relationship with the Pentagon

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
in which the Department of Defense provides information and equipment to certain productions

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
provided that they effectively function as a taxpayer-subsidized military recruitment ad.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Not all Hollywood films make the cut.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
The Avengers was famously denied these subsidies

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
when the text was not deemed by the Pentagon as, shall we say, helpful to their recruitment efforts.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
According to academic Toby Miller,

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
as for propaganda, the state and the film industry have often worked together.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
In the embarrassingly macho language of the U.S. political science,

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
the media represents soft power to match the hard power of the military and the economy.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
The military offering their equipment, time, and manpower is nothing new.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
What is new is the type of movie they lend their resources to.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
No longer are the biggest projects real-life stories about soldiers and heroism,

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
now they just as often involve an alien invasion,

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
with a military subplot thrown in as an afterthought, an advertisement even,

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
which are then later tied in with a literal recruitment campaign.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
Recent high-profile examples include the Transformers movies,

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
Man of Steel, and Independence Day Resurgence.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Yeah, that went well.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
Transformers movies use the cinematic language of capitalism

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
both to safely critique a fictionalized brand of capitalism,

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
the girly, effete, non-manly Steve Jobs kind,

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Tactical nuke.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
LOL.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
Oh my god!

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
while using that same language to actually promote the state's agenda.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
And one more important note about Tucci's character.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
He exploits dead Autobots innocently,

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
but only with encouragement from corrupt government agencies.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
In fact, Tucci is redeemed at the end, despite his misdeeds,

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
where the real bad guy, a government agent played by Kelsey,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
yep-he's-here-too grammar,

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
and founder of CIA faction Cemetery Wind,

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Cemetery Wind.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
is shot in the back by Optimus Prime, our hero.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
In the end, in the words of Ronald Reagan,

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Government is not the solution to our problem.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
Sometimes it is in the interest of the state to push this ideology,

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
and the Transformers movies have been all too eager to oblige.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
So, I want to bring it back around to Professor Jazz Hater for a minute.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
You like jazz?

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
Normally, I wouldn't feel the need to explain this,

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
but this is a series for YouTube, not for the classroom.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
When one explains a theoretical framework

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
and applies it to a text,

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
that isn't necessarily the same thing as agreeing with that framework.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
It's just showing that you understand it.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
I say this because I don't want my interpreting Adorno's position for Transformers

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
to mean that I think that all products of the culture industry

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
are meaningless and exist to cram some fleeting complacence in your life

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
so you don't get utterly sucked into the void.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
If that was true, then how could I possibly justify

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
all these star screams I seem to own?

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
It makes me happy!

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
But there is a big problem in nerd communities

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
with coming to terms with the fact that a product they kind of love

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
only exists for gross, hyper-capitalistic, Reagan-y reasons.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Personally, I do not care.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
I buy my star screams, I read my comics,

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
and I can still talk about the fact that this series only exists

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
due to deregulation designed to target children and benefit big businesses.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
I personally do not ascribe to Adorno's black-and-white worldview

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
that the culture industry produces only trash

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
and you only stuff your face with it

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
because you are trying to fill a bottomless emptiness with no name.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
To concede to this viewpoint is to posit that Hollywood is incapable

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
of producing art with any sort of meaning,

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
and that's just not a position I can get behind.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
Plus, I just don't think I can trust the taste of a guy who hates jazz that much.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
But, and this is if you ignore Bayes' movies,

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
which do, I think, fit into Adorno's definition of trash,

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
it is also not fair to say that nothing good or artistic

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
has not come from this franchise,

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
despite its origins as a marketing tool to sell toys.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
No, the products of the culture industry are hollow and meaningless.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Smash!

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
Hey Tabby, do you like jazz?

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
Yeah, that's what I thought.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
You like jazz?
