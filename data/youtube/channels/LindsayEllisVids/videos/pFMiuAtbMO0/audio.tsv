0	4440	In Ronald Reagan's first speech as president in 1981, he famously said,
4440	12160	In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem.
12160	16280	Before 1984, American television stations were closely regulated,
16280	21320	and the promotion of any product within the body of a TV show was forbidden by the Federal Communications Commission.
21320	24320	All that changed under the Reagan administration in 1984,
24320	28800	when children's television was deregulated as part of a wider bid to boost the American economy.
28800	33320	Around this time, a Japanese toy company called Takara Tomy was enjoying success in Japan
33320	36840	with several lines of transforming robot toys, including Diaclone
36840	40880	Diaclone
40880	41840	and Microman
41840	45520	Microman
45520	47840	Spying opportunity with this new deregulation,
47840	51400	effectively allowing children's television shows to act as commercials for toys,
51400	57680	American toy giant Hasbro licensed both of these toy lines into a new American brand known as The Transformers,
57680	63200	and sped into production a cartoon to promote the new toy line, which premiered in September of 1984.
63200	68440	Although the quality of children's television of this era is notoriously low, if not extremely high on camp,
68440	72880	You tin-tongued dolt! I'm talking about my patience, not my body!
72880	77000	Amazing. A booby trap that actually catches boobies.
77000	80960	Ah, just what everybody needs, a magical island holiday.
80960	83840	I could write a book about what you don't know!
83840	87840	You disgust me.
87840	89840	Hey man, are you alright?
89840	91680	Just must my hair.
91680	96240	The effects of this change in regulation laws and media targeting children reverberates to this day.
96240	100640	Children's programming is only put into production with a mind to how well it will sell merchandise.
100640	105360	And yes, we can consider a toy, a cartoon, a comic, a whatever, a piece of art.
105360	107720	The Transformers was most definitely art.
107720	111920	You are either lying or you're stupid!
111960	115120	I'm stupid! I'm stupid!
115120	119800	But that piece of art is still used primarily for the calculated push towards profit maximization.
119800	127240	The trend since that deregulation in the mid-1980s has seen the profits of these giant corporations go more and more to the top 1% of earners.
127240	131920	Income inequality was a reality in the mid-80s, it is a much bigger reality now.
131920	135040	And if we live in a capitalist society where wealth equals power,
135040	138280	and the way wealth is distributed and who controls the means of production,
138280	144280	then what gets made and consumed, especially media that targets children who are not yet old enough to question power structures,
144280	145880	is an important question.
145880	148120	Who controls the means of production?
148120	149800	Who benefits from that control?
149800	153720	Some might even say it is in the best interest of the masses to...
153720	157480	seize the means of production.
157480	159000	Oh boy!
160000	161000	I don't play.
161000	162000	I don't play.
163000	164000	I don't play.
164000	165000	I don't play.
165000	166000	I don't play.
166000	170000	Today we're talking about Transformers, Marxism, and film theory.
170000	173000	The least complicated topic I've ever decided to tackle.
173000	175000	Sweet Jesus, why did I choose this?
175000	178000	Marxism. That topic you think you know about because...
178000	186000	certain YouTube intellectuals screaming about how Marxism is directly opposed to Western values is so hot right now.
189000	193000	So at the risk of pissing everyone off, both on the right and on the left,
195000	199000	I'll preface by admitting that I am not an expert on Marxist critical theory.
199000	204000	I have an MFA in film and television, not a PhD in Derrida studies.
204000	216000	But I know enough about Marxism to know that it's really too complex a theoretical framework to satisfactorily scratch the surface in a 15-20 minute YouTube video about Transformers and film theory.
216000	220000	But this is a survey, not a comprehensive lecture, so...
221000	222000	Where do we start?
222000	227000	The barest bones reduction of classical Marxism is that capitalism is bad because it's exploitative.
227000	231000	Because a portion of the value that the worker creates goes to the owner.
231000	233000	In America, a huge portion.
233000	236000	Therefore the worker is not paid the full value of her work.
236000	239000	But Marxism is also highly concerned with the masses.
239000	241000	How information is disseminated.
241000	242000	How values are shaped.
242000	243000	Who shapes them.
243000	244000	Who has the power.
244000	250000	And ultimately, how groups of people are controlled and coerced into buying into this unjust system.
250000	257000	This makes Marxist theoretical frameworks particularly of interest to film theorists, and especially relevant to the Transformers movies.
258000	259000	We'll get to that.
259000	262000	One popular misconception is conflating Marxism with communism.
262000	269000	Well, technically communism is the inevitable outcome of Marxism, so it's sort of a distinction without a difference.
269000	270000	Well, I get that.
270000	277000	But what I mean is, in America, when people hear the word communism, they usually think of the totalitarian brand exemplified by Stalin.
277000	280000	Well, like I said, I'm no expert, so go ahead, school me.
280000	286000	Well, it's true that there's a Western tradition of Marxist theory that's more academic than revolutionary.
286000	294000	You've got your Hegelian Marxists, your Freudian Marxists, your critical theorists, your situationists, your Marxist humanists,
294000	298000	your analytic Marxists, your postmodern neo-Marxists.
298000	306000	You know, you gotta read Kojev, Benjamin, Marcuse, Althusser, Lukács, Gramsci, Rancière.
306000	308000	You have read Rancière, haven't you?
311000	313000	Totally.
313000	314000	An undergrad.
314000	322000	So moving on, Marxism and Stalinism are not the same thing, but this is a useful opportunity to delve into the difference between theory and praxis.
322000	324000	Marxism is a form of theory.
324000	331000	Theory is the thought framework, a means of interpretation, and in this context, a means of predicting sociological trends and interpreting them.
331000	334000	Praxis is the real-world execution of that theory.
334000	336000	In this case, usually it would be activism.
336000	342000	For instance, enacting the ideology of Stalinism in the real world is a form of praxis.
342000	344000	Not a good one.
344000	347000	There are those who defend it, but we're not going to go there.
347000	353000	So giving a Marxist reading on any given text is de facto incomplete as there are many Marxist schools of thought,
353000	355000	just as there are many feminist schools of thought.
355000	359000	Marxists disagree with each other constantly, believe it or not.
359000	365000	So to keep this simple, we are going to pick the framework of a Marxist theoretical theorist who is very important and just go with that.
365000	368000	Let's spin the wheel of Marxist discourse.
368000	373000	Who's it gonna be? Who's gonna tell us how to interpret the Transformies?
374000	376000	Okay, Adorno, good enough.
376000	380000	Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno were members of the Frankfurt School,
380000	385000	which was associated in part with the Institute for Social Research at the Goethe University Frankfurt.
385000	389000	And ultimately, we today might consider them the daddies of critical theory.
389000	393000	They were far ahead of their time in that they saw media as a potential lens to culture,
393000	396000	how cultures develop, self-reflect, and propagate values,
396000	401000	ideas that wouldn't take hold in mainstream academia and critical studies until the 1960s and 70s,
401000	403000	largely thanks to the works of these guys.
403000	406000	Adorno was the most pessimistic, so it's a good thing we chose him.
407000	408000	I ate the whole plate.
408000	409000	Sam, I gotta run.
409000	410000	Yeah.
410000	415000	Deep wang. Deep wang. You're not getting it.
415000	417000	Say my name. Say my name.
418000	420000	You want those new teeth you saw in Skymall?
420000	421000	It's my dream!
421000	422000	The whole plate.
422000	427000	For Adorno, film was too close to mass culture, and its spectators were in turn too close to it,
427000	430000	too integrated to its effects and manipulations.
430000	436000	With Horkheimer, Adorno produced the blistering Dialectic of Enlightenment in 1944 after they fled to the US,
436000	441000	pinning a devastating indictment on the integration of film into capitalist industrial production
441000	445000	and consumption into what Adorno and Horkheimer describe as the culture industry.
445000	450000	According to Adorno and Horkheimer, all mass culture under Monopoly is identical,
450000	455000	and the contours of its skeleton, the conceptual armature fabricated by Monopoly, are beginning to stand out.
455000	461000	The truth that they are nothing but business is used as an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce.
461000	467000	A jazz musician who has to play a piece of serious music, Beethoven's simplest minuet, involunteer-
467000	471000	Wait a minute. Why does this guy hate jazz so much? Anyway, moving on.
471000	474000	Adorno saw film as almost analogous to the way Marx saw religion,
474000	477000	what he famously called the sigh of the oppressed creature,
477000	480000	the heart of a heartless world and the soul of a soulless condition.
480000	482000	It is the opium of the people.
482000	488000	Adorno saw the film industry as a mass organized machine designed to salve the masses and to keep them obedient.
488000	492000	According to Adorno and Horkheimer, amusement always means putting things out of mind,
492000	494000	forgetting suffering, even when it's on display.
494000	496000	At its root is powerlessness.
496000	500000	It is indeed escape, but not, as it claims, escape from bad reality,
500000	502000	but from the last thought of resisting that reality.
502000	505000	Existence in late capitalism is a permanent rite of initiation.
505000	509000	Everyone must show that they identify wholeheartedly with the power which beats them.
509000	512000	This is inherent in the principle of syncopation and jazz,
512000	515000	which mocks the act of stumbling while elevating it to the nor-
515000	517000	Okay, dude.
517000	519000	In effect, late-stage capitalism is sad,
519000	523000	and a part of the media-industrial complex's function is to provide a distraction
523000	526000	from the fact that you are fundamentally being exploited.
526000	528000	So, you watch Transformers,
528000	532000	movies which nobody likes but pings that nostalgia center of your brain
532000	536000	just enough that it distracts you from the void for approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes,
536000	538000	depending on which one you're watching.
538000	541000	And that is the culture industry.
541000	544000	An important aspect of the escapism provided by the culture industry
544000	546000	is the representation of the self,
546000	550000	the ur-audience member both elevated and denigrated in the form of the leading man,
550000	552000	i.e. Sam Witwicky,
552000	555000	I'm not talking to you for 10 seconds. You have 3 seconds left.
555000	557000	You know what? You can give me the silent treatment all you want.
557000	558000	and Cade Yeager.
558000	560000	Hey, you know, there's a reward for turning you in.
560000	561000	Really? Yeah.
561000	563000	Cool. You want to get punched in the face like really hard?
563000	567000	The ideology does, it is true, make life initially easier for the spectators.
567000	570000	They are assured that they do not need to be in any way other than they are,
570000	574000	and that they can succeed just as well without having to perform tasks
574000	576000	of which they know themselves incapable.
576000	580000	At the same time, they are given the hint that the effort would not help them in any case,
580000	583000	because even bourgeois success no longer has any connection
583000	585000	to the calculable effect of their own work.
585000	588000	Because of his ubiquity, the film star with whom one is supposed to fall in love
588000	591000	is, from the start, a copy of himself.
591000	593000	Every tenor now sounds like a Caruso record,
593000	597000	and the natural faces of Texas girls already resemble those of the established models
597000	599000	by which they would be typecast in Hollywood.
599000	603000	What is repeated is healthy, the cycle in nature, as in the industry.
603000	605000	The same babies grin endlessly from magazines,
605000	607000	and endlessly the jazz machine pounds...
607000	609000	Okay, we're done here.
609000	613000	That's enough theoretical framework from Teodoro Dorno, hater of jazz.
615000	617000	I'm gonna do my own damn Marxist reading.
617000	619000	First, let's ignore the culture industry,
619000	622000	i.e. the forces that went into the creation of the text,
622000	624000	and talk about what's in the text itself.
624000	627000	Interpreting text is the most basic form of film studies,
627000	631000	and mostly ignores other influences, i.e. real-world markets
631000	634000	that may have led to the thing existing in the first place.
634000	636000	This is simply the study of the text.
636000	640000	Bumblebee peeing on John Turturro is a part of the text.
640000	642000	It is a thing that happens in the story,
642000	645000	independent of all things that went into the creation of the text.
645000	648000	The character of Bumblebee hears what Agent Turturro says...
648000	651000	Brave now, all of a sudden, with his big alien friend standing over there.
652000	655000	Decides he needs to be put in his place, and pees on him.
658000	660000	I'm sorry, lubricates him,
660000	663000	and swivels his little robot hips as he does so.
663000	664000	This is all text.
664000	668000	So, what does the text have to say about capitalism?
668000	672000	While on the whole the series remains uninterested in a critique of capitalism,
676000	679000	there are parts of the text that are strangely anti-capitalist,
679000	681000	and this is actually a major trend in Hollywood movies,
681000	683000	where the villains are capitalists,
683000	687000	in spite of the fact that Hollywood as a system is a monopoly capitalist sweat dream.
687000	691000	I drink your milkshake!
693000	696000	Transformers 4 frames Cade Yeager as a down-on-his-luck inventor.
696000	698000	I'm an inventor!
698000	701000	He is an entrepreneur, but appears to work off a barter system?
701000	705000	Contrast him with Stanley Tucci's character Joshua Joyce in Transformers 4.
705000	708000	Transformium. That's what we're calling it.
708000	710000	Focus group. Catchy. Trademarked.
710000	715000	Not, of course, to be confused with Stanley Tucci's portrayal of Merlin in Transformers 5.
715000	718000	Oh, God, I'm sozzled.
719000	721000	One last nip.
721000	726000	Joyce is a thinly-veiled Steve Jobs-alike whose methods are inherently exploitative.
726000	728000	Programmable matter.
728000	730000	And now we've mapped its genome.
730000	731000	Now you've mapped its genome.
731000	733000	And I was in charge of autopsy duty.
733000	736000	No union, no benefits, no nothing.
736000	738000	He steals technology that is not his.
738000	742000	And moreover, he steals technology from the dead bodies of Transformers.
742000	745000	This is not legal. This is illegal experimentation.
745000	747000	And not just Decepticons, either.
747000	750000	The movie goes out of its way to show that the medic Ratchet from the first movie,
750000	752000	you know, the guy that said this,
752000	757000	The boy's pheromone levels suggest he wants to mate with the female.
757000	759000	is having his corpse vandalized.
759000	761000	They're melting Ratchet.
761000	763000	And that Optimus Prime is really mad about this.
763000	765000	They slaughtered Ratchet.
765000	768000	I'm gonna tear them apart.
768000	772000	In the very same scene where we are getting to learn of Steve Jobs' exploitative villainy,
772000	774000	boom, product placement.
774000	776000	You like music?
776000	777000	The pill.
777000	779000	And the ironic thing about Age of Extinction,
779000	783000	the one text of the five movies that is most critical of capitalism,
783000	786000	is also the most explicit in its product placement.
788000	790000	Insurance?
790000	791000	It's a freaking spaceship.
791000	793000	It's your car?
793000	794000	Huh?
794000	797000	But there is another form of product placement in these films
797000	799000	that would also be of interest to the attentive Marxist.
799000	802000	See, the attentive Marxist is less interested in the text itself
802000	804000	than in the function of the text.
804000	806000	What values is it encouraging?
806000	808000	What is it trying to sell you?
808000	812000	And the answer to that is, of course, much more than meets the eye.
812000	813000	Sorry.
813000	816000	The answer is much more complex than a series of films designed to sell toys and place products.
816000	819000	And that is where the aesthetics of advertising comes in.
819000	822000	If the primary intent of these films was to sell product
822000	826000	and elevate brand name recognition, namely, of the Transformers toy line,
826000	829000	then Michael Bay was the perfect choice to direct these five movies,
829000	831000	for a variety of reasons.
831000	835000	The first being his history as a director of commercials and music videos.
835000	837000	Commercials as advertisements for products.
837000	839000	You know, it's pretty good beer.
839000	841000	And music videos being advertisements for albums.
841000	843000	Both are pieces of art unto themselves.
843000	847000	Bay's iconic Got Milk commercial from the 90s is remembered for a reason.
848000	850000	I'm sorry. Maybe next time.
852000	856000	But these are pieces of art whose mere existence is dependent on their function as advertising.
856000	859000	So, to bring it back around to Professor Jazz Hater,
859000	862000	that is the triumph of advertising in the culture industry.
862000	865000	The compulsive imitation by consumers of cultural commodities,
865000	868000	which, at the same time, they recognize as false.
868000	872000	But Bay is advertising far more than just toys with these films.
872000	875000	Hollywood has long held a mutually beneficial relationship with the Pentagon
875000	879000	in which the Department of Defense provides information and equipment to certain productions
879000	883000	provided that they effectively function as a taxpayer-subsidized military recruitment ad.
883000	885000	Not all Hollywood films make the cut.
885000	888000	The Avengers was famously denied these subsidies
888000	893000	when the text was not deemed by the Pentagon as, shall we say, helpful to their recruitment efforts.
893000	895000	According to academic Toby Miller,
895000	898000	as for propaganda, the state and the film industry have often worked together.
898000	901000	In the embarrassingly macho language of the U.S. political science,
902000	906000	the media represents soft power to match the hard power of the military and the economy.
906000	909000	The military offering their equipment, time, and manpower is nothing new.
909000	912000	What is new is the type of movie they lend their resources to.
912000	916000	No longer are the biggest projects real-life stories about soldiers and heroism,
916000	919000	now they just as often involve an alien invasion,
919000	923000	with a military subplot thrown in as an afterthought, an advertisement even,
923000	926000	which are then later tied in with a literal recruitment campaign.
926000	929000	Recent high-profile examples include the Transformers movies,
929000	933000	Man of Steel, and Independence Day Resurgence.
933000	935000	Yeah, that went well.
935000	938000	Transformers movies use the cinematic language of capitalism
938000	941000	both to safely critique a fictionalized brand of capitalism,
941000	943000	the girly, effete, non-manly Steve Jobs kind,
943000	945000	Tactical nuke.
945000	947000	LOL.
949000	952000	Oh my god!
952000	955000	while using that same language to actually promote the state's agenda.
955000	958000	And one more important note about Tucci's character.
958000	960000	He exploits dead Autobots innocently,
960000	963000	but only with encouragement from corrupt government agencies.
963000	967000	In fact, Tucci is redeemed at the end, despite his misdeeds,
967000	971000	where the real bad guy, a government agent played by Kelsey,
971000	973000	yep-he's-here-too grammar,
973000	976000	and founder of CIA faction Cemetery Wind,
976000	977000	Cemetery Wind.
977000	980000	is shot in the back by Optimus Prime, our hero.
980000	982000	In the end, in the words of Ronald Reagan,
982000	985000	Government is not the solution to our problem.
985000	989000	Sometimes it is in the interest of the state to push this ideology,
989000	992000	and the Transformers movies have been all too eager to oblige.
992000	995000	So, I want to bring it back around to Professor Jazz Hater for a minute.
995000	996000	You like jazz?
996000	999000	Normally, I wouldn't feel the need to explain this,
999000	1002000	but this is a series for YouTube, not for the classroom.
1002000	1004000	When one explains a theoretical framework
1004000	1006000	and applies it to a text,
1006000	1010000	that isn't necessarily the same thing as agreeing with that framework.
1010000	1012000	It's just showing that you understand it.
1012000	1016000	I say this because I don't want my interpreting Adorno's position for Transformers
1016000	1019000	to mean that I think that all products of the culture industry
1019000	1022000	are meaningless and exist to cram some fleeting complacence in your life
1022000	1024000	so you don't get utterly sucked into the void.
1024000	1027000	If that was true, then how could I possibly justify
1027000	1029000	all these star screams I seem to own?
1029000	1030000	It makes me happy!
1030000	1032000	But there is a big problem in nerd communities
1032000	1035000	with coming to terms with the fact that a product they kind of love
1035000	1039000	only exists for gross, hyper-capitalistic, Reagan-y reasons.
1039000	1041000	Personally, I do not care.
1041000	1044000	I buy my star screams, I read my comics,
1044000	1047000	and I can still talk about the fact that this series only exists
1047000	1050000	due to deregulation designed to target children and benefit big businesses.
1050000	1054000	I personally do not ascribe to Adorno's black-and-white worldview
1054000	1056000	that the culture industry produces only trash
1056000	1058000	and you only stuff your face with it
1058000	1061000	because you are trying to fill a bottomless emptiness with no name.
1061000	1064000	To concede to this viewpoint is to posit that Hollywood is incapable
1064000	1066000	of producing art with any sort of meaning,
1066000	1068000	and that's just not a position I can get behind.
1068000	1072000	Plus, I just don't think I can trust the taste of a guy who hates jazz that much.
1072000	1074000	But, and this is if you ignore Bayes' movies,
1074000	1077000	which do, I think, fit into Adorno's definition of trash,
1077000	1080000	it is also not fair to say that nothing good or artistic
1080000	1082000	has not come from this franchise,
1082000	1085000	despite its origins as a marketing tool to sell toys.
1085000	1089000	No, the products of the culture industry are hollow and meaningless.
1089000	1090000	Smash!
1090000	1093000	Hey Tabby, do you like jazz?
1098000	1101000	Yeah, that's what I thought.
1128000	1131000	You like jazz?
