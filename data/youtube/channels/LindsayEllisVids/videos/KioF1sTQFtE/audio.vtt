00:00.000 --> 00:06.240
The Franco-Prussian War was a conflict between the Second French Empire and the Northern

00:06.240 --> 00:10.640
German Confederation led by the Kingdom of Prussia, which, owing to the German's superior

00:10.640 --> 00:14.920
strength and numbers, quickly led to the capitulation of the French Empire and the capture of its

00:14.920 --> 00:17.080
emperor, Napoleon III.

00:17.080 --> 00:20.960
The conflict culminated with the Siege of Paris in the winter of 1871, in which the

00:20.960 --> 00:23.480
German troops invaded the French capital.

00:23.480 --> 00:27.520
Months later, the German states unified into a German Empire, shifting the balance of power

00:27.520 --> 00:30.680
in Europe towards a now unified, powerful Germany.

00:30.680 --> 00:34.880
Britain, who mostly stayed out of it, of course kept a close eye on the conflict, and all

00:34.880 --> 00:38.660
the major newspapers, journals, and magazines reported at length on the course of the War

00:38.660 --> 00:43.840
of 1870 and on the prospects for the British in the changed Europe of 1871.

00:43.840 --> 00:47.660
Out of this national obsession with the conflict in Europe emerged a short story written by

00:47.660 --> 00:53.260
ex-soldier George Tompkins Chesney, The Battle of Dorking in 1871.

00:53.260 --> 00:57.540
The Battle of Dorking recounts the final days before and during a fictionalized, devastating

00:57.540 --> 01:02.420
invasion of Britain by a German-speaking enemy, retold fifty years after the fact by a nameless

01:02.420 --> 01:06.700
narrator to his grandchildren, who have grown up in a contested Britain that is now a heavily

01:06.700 --> 01:09.020
taxed annex of the enemy.

01:09.020 --> 01:13.500
The German-speaking invaders are never named, and are instead referred to obliquely as the

01:13.500 --> 01:17.060
Other Power, or the Enemy.

01:17.060 --> 01:20.740
Battle of Dorking was not only an overnight national sensation and controversy.

01:20.740 --> 01:24.380
Most readers saw the idea that the greatest imperial power in the world could be invaded,

01:24.380 --> 01:26.820
let alone could cease to exist, was ludicrous.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.820
But for many, it was an indictment of nationalistic hubris.

01:29.820 --> 01:34.740
For even more, it was an outrage, unmerited judgment, and a betrayal of Great Britain.

01:34.740 --> 01:39.060
But Battle of Dorking would set off a trend of its own, one that literary historians would

01:39.060 --> 01:44.100
eventually call Invasion Literature, fiction that spoke to the taboo and the thrill of

01:44.100 --> 01:48.580
the obviously ludicrous idea that the sovereign empire of Britain could ever fall to a foreign

01:48.580 --> 01:49.580
power.

01:49.580 --> 01:50.900
But what if?

01:50.900 --> 01:56.740
Between 1871 and 1914, over 60 works of fiction for adult readers describing hypothetical

01:56.740 --> 01:59.100
invasions of Great Britain were published.

01:59.100 --> 02:03.700
During that time, British writer H.G. Wells combined the popularity of Invasion Literature

02:03.700 --> 02:08.740
with a widespread interest in the idea of life on Mars to pioneer a whole new genre,

02:08.740 --> 02:12.700
one that has endured in popularity in some form ever since.

02:12.700 --> 02:13.700
The alien invasion.

02:13.700 --> 02:31.300
Here's an idea.

02:31.300 --> 02:37.660
Aliens in fiction are never just aliens, just as monsters in fiction are never just monsters.

02:37.660 --> 02:41.300
There is the literal function within the narrative, of course, but then there is that layer of

02:41.300 --> 02:45.860
metaphor of significance to the culture that the work is being presented to, a significance

02:45.860 --> 02:51.060
that may not even be obvious to either the author or the audience until some time later,

02:51.060 --> 02:52.060
if ever.

02:52.060 --> 02:56.140
So while I think it's not interesting to reduce a text to a one-to-one allegory, it

02:56.140 --> 03:02.020
is important to be open to textual metaphor, especially where aliens come in, be they sympathetic,

03:02.020 --> 03:09.780
threatening, beyond comprehension, or total gibberish.

03:09.780 --> 03:13.580
Aliens as a narrative device can reflect a historically colonized people, they can

03:13.580 --> 03:18.260
be the innocence of childhood, they can be some sort of spiritual revelation, they can

03:18.260 --> 03:22.900
be a class oppressed by poverty, or the ravages of poverty itself.

03:22.900 --> 03:28.220
Or they can be DUMB AS ROCKS.

03:28.220 --> 03:31.620
Author and professor of English Frank McConnell describes Wells' Martians as,

03:31.620 --> 03:35.620
What you fear most, what your culture and environment have taught you, is the worst

03:35.620 --> 03:39.100
thing that could happen to you, the situation over which you would have the least degree

03:39.420 --> 03:40.420
of control.

03:40.420 --> 03:43.940
Wells was writing for an audience of Victorian Britons, whom he describes in the opening

03:43.940 --> 03:47.740
of the novel as, secure in their empire over this earth.

03:47.740 --> 03:51.060
Wells was writing for an audience for whom the very idea that intelligent beings from

03:51.060 --> 03:55.100
another planet could be capable of launching an attack on the most powerful nation on earth

03:55.100 --> 03:57.700
was a most bizarre and outlandish notion.

03:57.700 --> 04:01.660
But the invasion narrative is a manifestation of different cultural anxieties in different

04:01.660 --> 04:02.660
eras.

04:02.660 --> 04:06.300
For instance, the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers came at the height of the McCarthy

04:06.300 --> 04:10.700
era, and is just one of many invasion narratives that were released during the beginning of

04:10.700 --> 04:11.700
the Cold War.

04:11.700 --> 04:17.060
However, when I say an alien is never just an alien, I do not mean that the alien is

04:17.060 --> 04:21.140
a one-to-one metaphor for something else, and that is a trap that a lot of people tend

04:21.140 --> 04:22.140
to fall into.

04:22.140 --> 04:24.140
Is that the terrorists?

04:24.140 --> 04:26.980
Mmm, yes and no, Dakota Fanning.

04:26.980 --> 04:31.460
Interpreting Animal Farm as a metaphor for totalitarian communism is great for your 8th

04:31.460 --> 04:34.860
grade English class, but metaphor is rarely that simple.

04:34.860 --> 04:38.500
Invasion narratives capture the ecosystem of the culture in which they were made, what

04:38.500 --> 04:40.420
that culture fears most.

04:40.420 --> 04:44.700
With that in mind, we are going to compare invasion narratives from two wildly different

04:44.700 --> 04:49.420
cultures, America in the 1990s, and America in 2005.

04:49.420 --> 04:53.420
My lovely lady lumps, check it out.

04:53.420 --> 04:55.420
We're going to live on.

04:55.420 --> 04:58.420
We're going to survive.

04:58.420 --> 05:03.420
Today, we celebrate our Independence Day.

05:03.980 --> 05:07.500
Independence Day is a 1996 film directed by Roland Emmerich, starring Will Smith, Jeff

05:07.500 --> 05:11.740
Goldblum, and Bill Pullman, each playing characters experiencing different perspectives during

05:11.740 --> 05:17.700
an alien invasion, that of a soldier, a scientist, and the President of the United States, respectively.

05:17.700 --> 05:21.140
Over the course of the film, the invading alien horde wipes out most major cities on

05:21.140 --> 05:25.980
the planet, and all hope seems lost until the scientist devises a computer virus which,

05:25.980 --> 05:29.860
with the help of the soldier, he is able to upload into the mothership, disabling all

05:29.860 --> 05:31.200
subordinate ships.

05:31.200 --> 05:35.240
This enables the American military not only to destroy the local ship threatening them,

05:35.240 --> 05:38.560
but also to instruct the rest of the world on how to do the same.

05:38.560 --> 05:40.560
And the remnants of humanity celebrate.

05:40.560 --> 05:43.560
Didn't I promise you fireworks?

05:43.560 --> 05:44.560
Yeah.

05:48.560 --> 05:51.560
It is dumb as a bag of rocks, and it is one of my favorite movies.

05:51.560 --> 05:52.560
I love it.

05:52.560 --> 05:57.560
War of the Worlds is a 2005 film directed by Steven Spielberg, starring Tom Cruise.

05:57.560 --> 05:59.560
Get a hug?

05:59.920 --> 06:01.920
Using handshake?

06:01.920 --> 06:03.920
Kicking the teeth?

06:03.920 --> 06:07.920
The film follows dock worker and inadequate father, Ray Ferrier, on the rare weekend when

06:07.920 --> 06:12.400
he has custody of his two children, in which an alien invasion happens and he tries to

06:12.400 --> 06:13.680
protect them.

06:13.680 --> 06:17.520
As their circumstances become increasingly desperate, they narrowly escape certain deaths

06:17.520 --> 06:21.520
several times, and eventually Ray is separated from his oldest child.

06:21.520 --> 06:25.400
The film concludes when all family members are reunited, and the aliens die from their

06:25.400 --> 06:27.920
lack of immunity to the planet's pathogens.

06:29.920 --> 06:33.920
It is a stone-cold bummer, and I also kind of love it.

06:33.920 --> 06:37.920
Despite taking place over a century after the novel takes place, the bones of Wells'

06:37.920 --> 06:38.920
story remain intact.

06:38.920 --> 06:42.920
The invasion is seen from the perspective of one character, it is more an episodic survival

06:42.920 --> 06:46.920
narrative than anything else, the tripods are fairly faithful, the narrator is tested

06:46.920 --> 06:51.920
by another character driven to madness whom he must kill in order to survive, and the

06:51.920 --> 06:55.920
invasion is stopped not by human ingenuity, but by a lack of immunity.

06:56.280 --> 07:03.280
They were undone, destroyed, after all of man's weapons and devices had failed, by

07:03.280 --> 07:07.280
the tiniest creatures that God and his wisdom put upon this earth.

07:07.280 --> 07:10.280
In this way, Spielberg's adaptation is perhaps the most faithful.

07:10.280 --> 07:14.280
But War of the Worlds isn't like, say, Les Miserables, where it's the same characters

07:14.280 --> 07:16.280
and basically the same story each time.

07:16.280 --> 07:21.280
War of the Worlds is not a classic story, per se, it is more of a classic premise.

07:21.280 --> 07:24.280
And the characters themselves are totally different in each iteration.

07:24.640 --> 07:28.640
Spielberg himself has pointed out that adaptations of War of the Worlds tend to come about in

07:28.640 --> 07:33.140
times of cultural stress, with the two most well-known adaptations, besides the 05 version

07:33.140 --> 07:38.640
being Orson Welles' radio drama from 1938, and the film adaptation from 1953.

07:38.640 --> 07:42.720
And of course there was the original novel, a twist on a trend in invasion literature

07:42.720 --> 07:47.280
released during a period of growing international tension in Europe where everyone kind of sensed

07:47.280 --> 07:49.560
that a great war was on the horizon.

07:49.600 --> 07:54.240
So while the 1890s was technically a time of peace in the UK, it was a peace squished

07:54.240 --> 07:58.840
between recent violence and the massive sense of tension growing throughout Europe.

07:58.840 --> 08:02.960
But War of the Worlds is also read as a biting critique of British imperialism, encouraging

08:02.960 --> 08:07.800
the reader to consider the world from the perspective of a people being invaded by colonizers.

08:07.800 --> 08:10.800
Welles states this explicitly in the first chapter of the novel,

08:20.300 --> 08:24.600
The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely swept out of existence in a

08:24.600 --> 08:29.320
war of extermination waged by European immigrants in the space of 50 years.

08:29.320 --> 08:34.240
Are we such apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?

08:34.240 --> 08:38.120
I bring this up because the context in which War of the Worlds the novel became a success

08:38.120 --> 08:44.200
in the 1890s, and the context in which Independence Day became a success in the 1990s, are perhaps

08:44.200 --> 08:47.760
more analogous to each other than the 2005 adaptation.

08:47.760 --> 08:51.400
Both Independence Day and Welles' novel came about during times of relative peace

08:51.400 --> 08:56.040
and prosperity for the people living in the dominant world power of the day, and both

08:56.040 --> 09:00.600
preceded violent upheavals that would completely change those cultures forever.

09:00.600 --> 09:04.760
Of course, the huge difference between Independence Day and Welles' original War of the Worlds

09:04.760 --> 09:09.180
is that Welles encourages the reader to reflect on their own position as citizens of an imperial

09:09.180 --> 09:12.360
power built on the exploitation of other people.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.640
Independence Day?

09:14.640 --> 09:15.640
Not so much.

09:16.520 --> 09:18.520
Welcome to Earth.

09:18.520 --> 09:20.320
Dumb as rocks.

09:20.320 --> 09:25.280
In Independence Day, the aliens lest reflect a broad cultural anxiety so much as arrogance.

09:25.280 --> 09:30.480
Yes, this incomprehensible technological force is impressive, but it cannot withstand the

09:30.480 --> 09:35.000
might of American ingenuity and hegemony, a bizarre and outlandish notion.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Peace!

09:42.200 --> 09:45.400
So what do the aliens in War of the Worlds reflect?

09:46.160 --> 09:47.160
Is that the terrorists?

09:47.160 --> 09:49.160
Well, kind of?

09:54.160 --> 10:00.440
The America of 1996 and the America of 2005 may as well exist in different dimensions.

10:00.440 --> 10:02.440
Here is 90s Batman.

10:02.440 --> 10:03.440
Seven million.

10:03.440 --> 10:05.440
Never leave the cave without it.

10:05.440 --> 10:07.440
And here is 2000s Batman.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.440
I swear to God.

10:08.440 --> 10:09.440
Swear to me!

10:09.440 --> 10:14.160
The 90s had a very different, shall we say, mouthfeel.

10:14.200 --> 10:18.920
The white, middle-class, film-going public of 1996 didn't have much to worry about.

10:18.920 --> 10:23.400
Cold War's over, economy's booming, every middle school dance is getting jiggy with

10:23.400 --> 10:26.440
a charming little ditty called the Macarena.

10:26.440 --> 10:32.280
And Hollywood is spending a lot of time in thought exercises of, what if X disaster?

10:32.280 --> 10:39.400
We got tornadoes, we got volcanoes, we got sharks, we got asteroids, we got more asteroids.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.680
Just destroy everything.

10:41.680 --> 10:42.680
It's fun.

10:43.680 --> 10:48.400
Here was an ecosystem in which we can release a movie like Mars Attacks, which was released

10:48.400 --> 10:52.600
the same year as Independence Day, and they could just blow up Congress willy-nilly and

10:52.600 --> 10:53.600
hey, it's funny.

10:53.600 --> 10:56.600
They blew up Congress!

10:56.600 --> 11:00.760
Americans were bored and disconnected from any kind of real social anxieties, and disaster

11:00.760 --> 11:05.000
movies were an effective outlet to get some quick, easy thrills and enjoy some blameless

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
conflict.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
I'm back!

11:09.000 --> 11:11.480
It's a funpocalypse.

11:11.480 --> 11:20.720
So compare this to the genuine, visceral terror we see in War of the Worlds.

11:20.720 --> 11:24.520
There isn't really any horror in seeing these symbols of American hegemony destroyed in

11:24.520 --> 11:26.800
the most complete and terrible way.

11:26.800 --> 11:29.960
Even now, it's not framed to be an uncomfortable thing to watch.

11:29.960 --> 11:35.360
In fact, it's kind of awesome.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.040
It's still kind of awesome.

11:37.040 --> 11:41.000
Here was a film where little children stare upon the smoldering ruins of the only home

11:41.000 --> 11:43.400
they have ever known and say things like,

11:43.400 --> 11:45.600
What happened, Mommy?

11:45.600 --> 11:48.760
Here is a film in which tens of millions of people have died.

11:48.760 --> 11:52.240
And this man, whose family is missing, presumed dead, responds with,

11:52.240 --> 11:53.240
No, sir.

11:53.240 --> 11:57.160
Just a little anxious to get up there and whoop E.T.'s ass, that's all.

11:57.160 --> 12:01.220
The 90s was a time in which it made narrative sense for aliens to ominously show up over

12:01.220 --> 12:06.600
major cities, and a lot of people are like, yeah, they come in peace.

12:06.600 --> 12:12.520
People dancing on top of the skyscraper like, woo, it's the 90s, did you catch Seinfeld

12:12.520 --> 12:13.880
last night?

12:13.880 --> 12:18.080
Aliens show up ominously, and our dingbat president doesn't even evacuate the cities.

12:18.080 --> 12:22.640
But it's okay, because he heroically plays a saxopho- I mean, he flies a plane, and he

12:22.640 --> 12:25.000
shoots the aliens, and America saves the day.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
I'm a combat pilot, Will.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.160
I belong in the air.

12:31.160 --> 12:35.000
And the film was dumb in ways that aren't immediately obvious, like the sheer amount

12:35.000 --> 12:39.120
of time people spend on the phone in this movie, but no one ever allows any time for

12:39.120 --> 12:40.560
information to be conveyed.

12:40.560 --> 12:44.560
This is the Secretary of Defense.

12:44.560 --> 12:45.560
Yes.

12:45.560 --> 12:49.440
Uh, Mr. President, there are aliens outside.

12:49.440 --> 12:52.640
Could you say that again?

12:52.640 --> 12:53.640
Aliens, sir.

12:53.640 --> 12:58.200
So playing on this idea of movie monsters, and invading aliens in particular, embodying

12:58.200 --> 13:04.120
cultural anxieties, why is the tone of the invasion narrative so different in 2005 as

13:04.160 --> 13:06.200
it is from 1996?

13:06.200 --> 13:09.960
Well, this is another entry into my ongoing series called

13:09.960 --> 13:19.200
Ignoring the seriousness of the massive loss of life and the scar to the national psyche,

13:19.200 --> 13:23.840
another pop culture casualty of the most destructive act of terrorism in modern history, at least

13:23.840 --> 13:26.800
for a time, the disaster movie.

13:26.800 --> 13:31.320
Gone were the days of goofy action movies like Independence Day and Godzilla and Wild

13:31.600 --> 13:32.600
West.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.080
No more disaster movies for these jaded masses.

13:35.080 --> 13:39.360
The few stragglers that were in production before 9-11 and crept in after were released,

13:39.360 --> 13:41.520
ignored, and forgotten just as quickly.

13:41.520 --> 13:46.440
According to the Los Angeles Times in 2002, the public appetite for plots involving disasters

13:46.440 --> 13:48.520
and terrorism has vanished.

13:48.520 --> 13:53.160
Obviously, this did not stick, but for a while, filmmakers did not know how to approach mass

13:53.160 --> 13:56.720
destruction in film, so they just didn't.

13:56.720 --> 14:01.200
When big destructive action movies did eventually begin to edge their way back into theaters,

14:01.200 --> 14:03.080
things were different.

14:03.080 --> 14:07.720
A movie like Independence Day no longer makes sense in a post-9-11 world in which audiences

14:07.720 --> 14:11.880
have actually lived through watching the destruction of familiar landmarks and mass casualties

14:11.880 --> 14:12.880
on live television.

14:12.880 --> 14:17.320
So Spielberg wants to create an invasion narrative that works in a post-9-11 world.

14:17.320 --> 14:18.520
But there's a problem, see.

14:22.840 --> 14:28.760
War of the Worlds is, in many ways, a response to, if not refutation of, Independence Day.

14:29.080 --> 14:29.880
This...

14:32.280 --> 14:33.800
evolves into this...

14:40.920 --> 14:41.800
This...

14:43.480 --> 14:44.760
evolves into this...

14:49.960 --> 14:51.960
and this, my favorite subtle dig...

14:59.320 --> 15:04.160
One of the biggest differences is the focus on what is being destroyed, what is at stake.

15:04.160 --> 15:08.520
In Independence Day, it is landmarks, buildings, cities, etc.

15:08.520 --> 15:11.920
In The War of the Worlds, there is much more focus on the loss of human life.

15:11.920 --> 15:15.640
The closest thing we get to big landmark destruction is the Bayonne Bridge.

15:15.640 --> 15:20.520
The horror comes not from mass destruction of landmarks and buildings, but from individuals.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.400
We see their faces as they are zapped out of existence.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.960
We see crowds as they are vaporized en masse.

15:25.960 --> 15:30.120
Roland's extermination is one of symbols, Spielberg's, of human life.

15:30.120 --> 15:33.160
The most obvious refutation of Independence Day is the tone,

15:33.160 --> 15:37.840
which turns big, optimistic 90s bombast into a low-saturation death march.

15:37.840 --> 15:41.960
Where, as with all of Roland's movies, the fall of civilization brings people together,

15:41.960 --> 15:46.320
in War of the Worlds, the fall of civilization turns people into self-serving animals.

15:48.280 --> 15:51.400
Which becomes a problem with the film in and of itself.

15:51.400 --> 15:52.600
We'll get to that.

15:52.600 --> 15:57.840
But at the same time, Independence Day as a film codified a lot of generic staples in shorthand,

15:57.840 --> 15:59.880
which War of the Worlds certainly borrows.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.440
For instance, there's this.

16:06.360 --> 16:09.360
Followed then by the powering up sounds of the primary weapon.

16:17.520 --> 16:20.960
And of course, there is the design of the invaders.

16:22.600 --> 16:33.400
This is not to imply that the Independence Day aliens are the most original design ever.

16:33.400 --> 16:37.800
Again, they're basically just Roswell aliens, only a little, you know, gooey-er.

16:37.800 --> 16:44.880
In part because it's implied in Independence Day that the Roswell aliens inspired our pop-cultural ideas of what aliens look like.

16:44.880 --> 16:49.240
But in War of the Worlds, there's no in-universe reason like that for them to look the way that they do,

16:49.240 --> 16:52.800
only the real-world context of coming out after Independence Day,

16:52.800 --> 16:55.120
and of Independence Day setting a standard.

16:55.120 --> 16:58.000
So they end up looking pretty identical.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.080
Only I guess these guys have mouths, so they can go, bleh.

17:03.280 --> 17:08.000
The aliens themselves also show up a little too late in the film to be anything really unfamiliar-looking.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.720
This is a balancing act in any visual medium when you have a non-human creature.

17:11.720 --> 17:15.680
The more alien they look, the more time the audience has to spend getting used to them.

17:15.680 --> 17:18.280
In War of the Worlds, they don't show up until Act 3,

17:18.280 --> 17:22.640
so they pretty much have to look like what our preconceived idea of an alien will look like,

17:22.640 --> 17:24.360
or it's just gonna be confusing.

17:24.360 --> 17:30.440
But this comes after an hour of the sheer, unadulterated, terrifying, eldritch horror that is the tripods.

17:30.440 --> 17:35.520
(*tripod whirring*)

17:35.520 --> 17:39.360
You spend hours building this up, and then we get... this.

17:39.520 --> 17:43.880
(*tripod whirring*)

17:43.880 --> 17:46.120
A scene which is the second scene in a row,

17:46.120 --> 17:49.600
which is a cut-right ripoff from the raptor scene from Jurassic Park.

17:49.600 --> 17:53.240
(*tripod whirring*)

17:53.240 --> 17:55.360
Now let's do this scene again, but worse.

17:55.360 --> 17:57.640
(*raptor growling*)

17:57.640 --> 18:00.360
I personally would rather not have seen the aliens,

18:00.360 --> 18:03.120
you know, maybe have a hand at the end of the movie, but that's it.

18:03.120 --> 18:07.600
But showing them at all also contradicts the greater horror slant that War of the Worlds is going for.

18:07.600 --> 18:10.680
It's going for a more stylistically real invasion,

18:10.680 --> 18:13.760
where Independence Day is big and cartoonish from the get-go.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.160
-"Is that glass bulletproof?" -"No, sir."

18:16.160 --> 18:17.760
(*raptor growling*)

18:17.760 --> 18:20.240
(*explosion*)

18:20.240 --> 18:24.840
So seeing these big-eyed, cute aliens feels incongruently silly.

18:27.560 --> 18:31.560
It's like if Schumacher's Riddler showed up in a Chris Nolan Batman movie.

18:31.560 --> 18:33.920
-"You're as blind as a bat!"

18:33.920 --> 18:35.440
-"Do I look like a cop?"

18:35.440 --> 18:37.400
(*gunshots*)

18:37.400 --> 18:42.360
But we saw him in Independence Day, so I guess we gotta do it here, too.

18:43.440 --> 18:47.920
So War of the Worlds already has this problem of existing in the shadow of Independence Day.

18:47.920 --> 18:53.320
Now it has to walk this tightrope of that, and also existing in a post-911 hellscape.

18:53.320 --> 18:55.120
Can Spielberg do it?

18:55.120 --> 18:58.120
Well, honestly, the answer was yes...

18:58.120 --> 18:59.320
...for the first half of the film.

18:59.320 --> 19:04.200
-♪♪♪♪

19:04.200 --> 19:08.000
In a time as complicated and shitty as the mid-Bush administration years...

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
-"Check it out!"

19:09.000 --> 19:13.400
...this is not to say that the War of the Worlds aliens are really embodiments of terrorism.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.800
-"Is that the terrorists?"

19:14.800 --> 19:19.000
Spielberg's intent here is less to say that terrorists are literally invading aliens,

19:19.000 --> 19:25.000
than to tap into that sense of helplessness and impotent desire for retaliation Americans felt after 9-11.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.600
-"Now we'll be the ones coming up from underground."

19:27.600 --> 19:30.600
...of trying to capture that feeling through genre fiction.

19:30.600 --> 19:31.800
-"Oh my God!"

19:31.800 --> 19:36.400
There's the misguided impulse to get back at an enemy you don't understand, or even know how to fight.

19:36.400 --> 19:41.600
-"We catch up with these soldiers, hook up with whoever else is in debt, and we get back at them!

19:41.600 --> 19:43.600
We get- we get back at them!"

19:43.600 --> 19:47.000
The rage and terror that something could threaten all this power and security

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
that you didn't realize you never even really had.

19:51.400 --> 19:54.400
And in terms of sheer imagery, there is a lot in here.

19:54.400 --> 20:00.000
Even the very first shot of the film, we swoop in on the backdrop of the place where the World Trade Center...

20:00.000 --> 20:01.400
used to be.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.200
Taking it a step further...

20:03.200 --> 20:04.600
-"There's all this stuff all over you."

20:04.600 --> 20:08.200
Well, this image of Tom Cruise covered in grey dust is, um...

20:08.800 --> 20:10.200
It's- it's loaded.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.200
-"The top floors collapsed down!

20:14.200 --> 20:18.000
I saw it blow, and then ran like hell, thank God!"

20:18.000 --> 20:19.600
As is this scene.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.400
It's not that aliens equals terrorists,

20:23.400 --> 20:28.000
it's Spielberg's ultimate statement on living in an America that no longer feels secure.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.600
We can't just mindlessly enjoy the cinematic destruction of a major city or landmark

20:32.600 --> 20:35.800
because we had just gone through this in real life.

20:35.800 --> 20:38.000
But none of these things are deal-breakers.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.200
Obviously, mass destruction of cities makes their way back into the movies eventually,

20:42.200 --> 20:46.200
and a dark tone in a monster movie is a totally valid creative decision.

20:46.200 --> 20:50.000
With War of the Worlds, I think most people agree that it sours in the second half.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.600
People like to complain about the illogic of aliens burying tripods underground,

20:54.600 --> 20:58.200
or wouldn't they have known about the common cold, that sort of thing.

20:58.200 --> 21:03.000
But if I can forgive that sort of thing in Independence Day, I can definitely forgive it here.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.600
No, where War of the Worlds goes wrong is honestly a little simpler than that.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.600
One clear example of the problem with the structure of the story is the inconsistent theming.

21:16.600 --> 21:20.400
In direct contrast, I would say intentional direct contrast,

21:20.400 --> 21:23.600
to Roland's optimism of disaster bringing humanity together,

21:24.600 --> 21:27.400
I'm not Jewish. Nobody's perfect.

21:27.400 --> 21:30.000
Here, disaster turns humans into animals.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.200
Now listen, put down the gun. I'm taking the car.

21:33.200 --> 21:36.600
Throughout the film, we see the increasing intensity of this theme.

21:36.600 --> 21:40.600
Rey must protect his children from other humans as much as he does from the aliens.

21:40.600 --> 21:45.200
And before we get to the end, he must kill another man to protect his daughter.

21:45.200 --> 21:47.200
I can't let my daughter die because of you.

21:47.200 --> 21:51.000
But then we work together when the plot needs us to.

21:51.200 --> 21:54.000
Suddenly at the end of the movie, with no change in circumstance,

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
humans aren't barbarous animals, and suddenly it's teamwork.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Everybody down!

21:59.000 --> 22:02.400
So, are humans monsters or aren't they?

22:02.400 --> 22:05.600
So, War of the Worlds is about this one guy's relationship to his children

22:05.600 --> 22:09.000
and how that is tested by apocalyptic alien invasion.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.400
This is relevant because the aliens are, at the emotional core of the film,

22:12.400 --> 22:14.800
what tests the strength of the family unit.

22:14.800 --> 22:20.800
Rey, the inadequate father, is forced for the first time in his life to take responsibility for his family.

22:20.800 --> 22:22.800
Can he do it?

22:22.800 --> 22:25.600
You're an asshole. I hate coming here.

22:25.600 --> 22:28.400
It's a solid conceit and firm grounding for a screenplay.

22:28.400 --> 22:31.800
And for the first half of the film, it executes this fairly well.

22:31.800 --> 22:38.000
But, you know, it kind of looks like the screenplay didn't have an answer to that question.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.400
Just look at that ending.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.400
Hey, Dad.

22:41.400 --> 22:44.400
And no, I don't mean how the aliens are defeated.

22:44.400 --> 22:48.400
Although I'm not a stickler for faithful adaptations, that is not the problem here.

22:48.400 --> 22:51.400
The resolution for the characters is the problem.

22:51.400 --> 22:54.400
Unlike Roland's trademark cast of thousands,

22:54.400 --> 22:58.000
War of the Worlds features a cast of four.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.200
Well, I take that back.

22:59.200 --> 23:03.200
You have the two A-listers, one this kid and Tim Robbins,

23:03.200 --> 23:08.000
whose introduction brings the film's momentum to a screeching halt from which it never recovers.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.800
This movie did not need humanity to save the day.

23:10.800 --> 23:15.400
It needed a satisfactory arc for these three characters we spend the entire movie with.

23:15.400 --> 23:20.000
And that, and not how the aliens are defeated, is the core of this narrative.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.600
And it's kind of a hot mess.

23:26.600 --> 23:28.200
For instance, Rachel.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.200
Dear Rachel.

23:29.200 --> 23:31.000
Hey, she said she could get it.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.400
She said she could get it.

23:32.400 --> 23:33.600
It's a Scott roller.

23:33.600 --> 23:35.800
Mom clearly thinks she's incapable.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.200
Dad says she can get it.

23:37.200 --> 23:38.400
She said she could get it.

23:38.400 --> 23:41.000
And it's almost like we're setting up a character arc here.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
Like, Rachel's gonna realize that she could indeed get it,

23:44.000 --> 23:47.800
even though mom and therapists coddle her to the point of being a complete deer in the head.

23:47.800 --> 23:48.400
Nope!

23:50.600 --> 23:52.400
Turns out Rachel can't get the bag.

23:52.400 --> 23:55.200
A realistic kid and well-rounded character in the first half,

23:55.200 --> 23:58.200
she's relegated to little more than a MacGuffin in Act 2,

23:58.200 --> 24:04.200
and basically just a doe-eyed trauma figurine in what passes for Act 3 in this movie.

24:04.200 --> 24:07.200
Which is kind of a problem for the second biggest character in your movie.

24:07.200 --> 24:11.000
And here's the one spot where Independence Day is the superior film.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.400
Despite having the trademark Roland Emmerich cast of thousands,

24:14.400 --> 24:18.600
all of the character arcs are complete, and they work.

24:18.600 --> 24:22.200
They're silly, but they are complete.

24:22.200 --> 24:26.200
Roland manages to give all of them a starting point and a culminating moment.

24:26.200 --> 24:29.800
President Clint Moore is faced with a country beginning to doubt his adequacy.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.000
They elected a warrior and they got a wimp.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.600
But through a series of trial and error, including the use of nuclear weapons,

24:35.600 --> 24:37.600
May our children forgive us.

24:37.600 --> 24:39.000
Whoopsie-daisy.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
He self-actualizes by firing his Secretary of Defense,

24:42.000 --> 24:45.600
and he becomes the warrior the country needed.

24:45.600 --> 24:46.400
Literally.

24:46.400 --> 24:48.600
Eagle One.

24:48.600 --> 24:50.000
Fox Three.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.400
Captain Hiller aspires to fly the Space Shuttle,

24:52.400 --> 24:54.800
a privilege which he is repeatedly denied.

24:54.800 --> 24:57.800
But after a series of conflicts and flying around a lot,

24:57.800 --> 25:04.000
he arguably becomes the most qualified person on the planet to fly the alien shuttle.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.800
I've been waiting for this my whole life.

25:06.000 --> 25:10.400
And David starts with his father and his ex-wife berating him for being a lazy genius.

25:10.400 --> 25:12.200
So tell me something. Are you so smart?

25:12.200 --> 25:15.200
How come you spent eight years in MIT to become a cable repairman?

25:15.200 --> 25:18.200
But in the end, not only does he rise above his inadequacy,

25:18.200 --> 25:21.200
his genius literally saves the world.

25:21.200 --> 25:24.200
You know how I'm like I'm always trying to save the planet?

25:28.200 --> 25:29.200
Here's my chance.

25:29.200 --> 25:31.600
There are three separate and distinguishable arcs here,

25:31.600 --> 25:33.400
and they are all set up really well,

25:33.400 --> 25:36.400
so the audience is very clear about who's accomplishing what,

25:36.400 --> 25:39.800
based on whose skill set by the time Act 3 rolls around,

25:39.800 --> 25:41.600
and we need to see those skills in action.

25:41.600 --> 25:43.800
Hell, even the Randy Quaid subplot,

25:43.800 --> 25:46.600
which seems genuinely pointless for most of the film,

25:46.600 --> 25:49.400
ends up being one of the most important elements in the movie.

25:49.400 --> 25:51.400
His motivation by way of his kids,

25:51.400 --> 25:53.000
why he's drunk all the time.

25:53.000 --> 25:53.800
Oh, yeah.

25:53.800 --> 25:55.800
Seems years back our boy here was kidnapped by aliens,

25:55.800 --> 25:58.400
did all kind of experiments on him and such.

25:58.400 --> 25:59.600
Tell him about it, Russ.

25:59.600 --> 26:00.800
His skill as a pilot.

26:00.800 --> 26:01.400
All of it.

26:01.400 --> 26:03.000
You know, we see it for a reason.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.200
So when it culminates...

26:06.200 --> 26:08.200
All right, you alien assholes!

26:08.200 --> 26:10.600
Oh, yeah.

26:10.600 --> 26:11.600
Sure.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.200
Oh, boys!

26:14.200 --> 26:18.600
I'm back!

26:18.600 --> 26:22.000
Wheeee!

26:22.000 --> 26:24.600
War of the Worlds, for all its masterful tension building,

26:24.600 --> 26:26.000
beautiful cinematography,

26:26.000 --> 26:27.200
genius sound design,

26:27.200 --> 26:29.800
and pretty good first half of a screenplay,

26:30.000 --> 26:34.600
does not have the same level of build-up and payoff as Independence Day.

26:34.600 --> 26:37.600
If you compare the three main character arcs in Independence Day,

26:37.600 --> 26:40.400
each cheesy but complete in its own little world,

26:40.400 --> 26:43.200
to the one protagonist character arc in War of the Worlds,

26:43.200 --> 26:45.800
what is Rey's culminating moment?

26:45.800 --> 26:47.600
He is set up as an inadequate father,

26:47.600 --> 26:51.200
a blue-collar kind of guy who does not know how to take care of his children,

26:51.200 --> 26:54.000
and only endures his custody weekends out of obligation.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.200
And when the aliens invade,

26:55.200 --> 26:58.400
he is forced into a situation where he must care for his children,

26:58.400 --> 26:59.600
all the while said children,

26:59.600 --> 27:01.400
a teenage boy on the verge of manhood,

27:01.400 --> 27:03.400
and a confused neurotic preteen,

27:03.400 --> 27:05.200
are actually acting their age.

27:05.200 --> 27:06.400
Rachel, shut up, Rachel!

27:06.400 --> 27:07.800
I can't sleep in your house!

27:07.800 --> 27:08.800
Look, I'm driving!

27:08.800 --> 27:11.400
Rey does not know how to take responsibility for them,

27:11.400 --> 27:13.800
but through the situation, he is forced to.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.800
And the screenwriters didn't seem to know where to go with that.

27:16.800 --> 27:18.400
And this is where the movie falls apart.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.800
Robbie is constantly wanting to get out and break free,

27:20.800 --> 27:22.200
and be a man,

27:22.200 --> 27:23.800
but break free from what?

27:23.800 --> 27:26.800
You only chose Boston because you hope Mom's there,

27:26.800 --> 27:29.200
and if she's there, you can dump us on her!

27:29.200 --> 27:31.000
Rey's not an overbearing father,

27:31.000 --> 27:34.600
he doesn't even give Robbie a slap on the wrist when he steals his car.

27:34.600 --> 27:35.800
Yeah, Robbie?

27:36.800 --> 27:39.800
Why, I might just smack my own hand.

27:39.800 --> 27:43.800
Nor is Robbie given any motivation to find some greater calling in Act 1.

27:43.800 --> 27:47.400
He doesn't lose anyone, or see the initial carnage Rey saw,

27:47.400 --> 27:48.800
so this...

27:48.800 --> 27:50.800
We catch up with these soldiers,

27:50.800 --> 27:52.400
hook up with whoever else is in debt,

27:52.400 --> 27:53.800
and we get back at them!

27:53.800 --> 27:56.800
...is the idiotic, macho blathering of a teenage boy

27:56.800 --> 27:59.000
who has no idea what he's talking about.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.200
So by the time the movie starts to fall apart,

28:01.200 --> 28:03.800
Robbie has shown no maturation.

28:03.800 --> 28:05.400
And then this happens.

28:05.400 --> 28:06.400
Robbie?

28:07.200 --> 28:08.000
Stay together!

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Robbie.

28:09.000 --> 28:09.600
Robbie.

28:09.600 --> 28:10.200
Robbie, no.

28:10.200 --> 28:11.600
Ro- Robbie, come back.

28:11.600 --> 28:14.200
Robbie, no, you're gonna- you're gonna ruin the movie, Robbie.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.000
Get back here!

28:15.000 --> 28:17.400
What, what do you think you're gonna be the Randy Quaid of this movie?

28:17.400 --> 28:19.400
This movie doesn't get a Randy Quaid, Robbie!

28:19.400 --> 28:21.000
It's not 1996 anymore!

28:21.000 --> 28:23.400
Please let me go. You need to let me go.

28:23.600 --> 28:25.800
So now Robbie is basically out of the movie,

28:25.800 --> 28:30.000
and despite idiotically running into a gigantic fireball...

28:30.800 --> 28:31.800
Don't worry.

28:31.800 --> 28:34.400
Everyone makes it to Grandma's house in the end.

28:35.200 --> 28:36.000
He's fine.

28:39.800 --> 28:42.800
It's not even that Robbie needed to die in the fireball.

28:42.800 --> 28:45.800
It's that he needed a different story arc altogether.

28:45.800 --> 28:47.200
If they wanted it to be,

28:47.200 --> 28:49.600
Rey realizes Robbie's a man,

28:49.600 --> 28:51.200
they should have built it to that.

28:51.200 --> 28:54.800
Because Robbie, as Rit, is a complete dipshit.

28:54.800 --> 28:58.400
Between these balls, we go back there and find one of those things and kill it.

28:58.400 --> 29:01.800
Every action he takes is immature, spiteful, and wrong-headed.

29:01.800 --> 29:05.600
Now let's try one that doesn't involve your ten-year-old sister joining the army!

29:05.600 --> 29:07.800
The movie begins with him stealing Rey's car,

29:07.800 --> 29:10.000
and he does not mature past this.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.800
He never once earns the trust that Rey deigned to give him.

29:12.800 --> 29:17.000
There's never a moment where Robbie and Rey learn to respect each other as men.

29:17.000 --> 29:17.800
So this?

29:17.800 --> 29:20.400
Please let me go. You need to let me go.

29:20.400 --> 29:21.200
It's like...

29:22.200 --> 29:24.200
Where the hell did that come from?

29:24.200 --> 29:27.000
Let's draw a comparison to one of cinema's most famous

29:27.000 --> 29:28.800
you-need-to-let-go moments.

29:28.800 --> 29:31.200
When Marlin and Dory are trapped in a whale,

29:31.200 --> 29:34.200
and Marlin has to make a metaphorical leap of faith...

29:34.200 --> 29:38.200
He says it's time to let go!

29:38.200 --> 29:40.200
Everything's gonna be alright!

29:40.200 --> 29:42.800
This is a culminating moment for Marlin's character.

29:42.800 --> 29:44.800
Marlin is an overprotective father.

29:44.800 --> 29:45.600
He's overbearing.

29:45.600 --> 29:46.600
He's overcompensating.

29:46.600 --> 29:47.600
He's neurotic.

29:47.600 --> 29:50.400
He has already endured the horrible loss of his wife,

29:50.400 --> 29:52.600
which makes the loss of Nemo his greatest fear,

29:52.600 --> 29:55.000
and literally the worst thing that could happen to him.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.200
How do you know something bad isn't gonna happen?

29:58.200 --> 29:59.800
I don't!

29:59.800 --> 30:02.400
So Marlin letting go in the face of uncertainty

30:02.400 --> 30:04.600
is a signifier of character growth.

30:04.600 --> 30:06.200
Rey, on the other hand...

30:06.200 --> 30:07.200
Meh.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.200
He's a bad father.

30:08.200 --> 30:10.000
He makes no room in his life for his children.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.200
He is a poor caretaker,

30:11.200 --> 30:13.000
and he takes no interest in their lives.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.400
I'm allergic to peanut butter.

30:16.400 --> 30:17.400
Since when?

30:18.200 --> 30:18.800
Birth.

30:18.800 --> 30:22.000
So what sense does it make for this to be any kind of culminating moment?

30:22.000 --> 30:24.200
It's a kid who's trying to break free from a dad

30:24.200 --> 30:27.000
who was never really there for him in the first place.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.200
And Rey is eventually like,

30:29.200 --> 30:31.200
Okay.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.200
Do whatever you want.

30:32.200 --> 30:35.200
Yes, I see that the movie is trying to push that it's building up,

30:35.200 --> 30:37.200
that this is Robbie crossing into manhood

30:37.200 --> 30:39.400
and Rey learning to respect him as a man.

30:39.400 --> 30:40.600
But this does not work,

30:40.600 --> 30:44.400
given how obviously wrongheaded his moves to be a man have been

30:44.400 --> 30:45.600
and continue to be.

30:45.600 --> 30:46.800
Please let me go.

30:46.800 --> 30:48.200
You need to let me go.

30:48.200 --> 30:49.200
Nope.

30:49.200 --> 30:52.400
If we need balls, we go back there and find one of those things and kill it.

30:52.400 --> 30:55.800
So it's at this point in the narrative that we trade in Robbie for Tim Robbins

30:55.800 --> 30:58.200
and spend the next 40 minutes in a basement.

30:58.200 --> 31:00.800
Tim Robbins slides into the role of Robbie in the narrative

31:00.800 --> 31:03.200
as the party who wants to fight back.

31:03.200 --> 31:04.600
Why did you bring us here?

31:04.600 --> 31:06.000
To fight them together.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.400
Against the wishes of Rey, who is just trying to not die.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.200
And it is the worst thing.

31:11.200 --> 31:13.800
Now we'll be the ones coming up from underground.

31:13.800 --> 31:16.200
Only we have no attachment to Tim Robbins.

31:16.200 --> 31:19.000
He is crazy and he's just here now.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
In the movie.

31:20.800 --> 31:23.400
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay...

31:23.400 --> 31:28.000
So rather than making it a story about how Robbie and Rey reconcile these two approaches to,

31:28.000 --> 31:30.200
you know, alien invasion,

31:30.200 --> 31:34.800
all the while trying to keep the helpless girl child safe from the barbarousness of humanity,

31:34.800 --> 31:36.000
we get Tim Robbins.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.600
We're right under their feet, right?

31:37.600 --> 31:38.600
Right here.

31:38.600 --> 31:39.600
Under their feet.

31:39.600 --> 31:42.600
So pretty much no matter what happens after Robbie leaves the narrative,

31:42.600 --> 31:45.600
at least if he does consequence-free come back,

31:45.600 --> 31:46.800
which is what happens,

31:46.800 --> 31:49.600
it's not going to be satisfying to the audience as a story.

31:49.600 --> 31:51.200
Because the payoff does not work,

31:51.200 --> 31:54.200
either logically, thematically, emotionally,

31:54.200 --> 31:55.200
with what was built up.

31:55.200 --> 31:56.400
So this...

31:58.800 --> 32:00.600
isn't the real problem.

32:00.600 --> 32:01.600
This is.

32:03.600 --> 32:06.200
I'm not saying it would have been better if Robbie never came back into the ne-

32:06.200 --> 32:07.800
well, I mean, kind of would have.

32:07.800 --> 32:10.600
It would have shown Rey that his inadequacy actually has a consequence.

32:10.600 --> 32:14.600
But rather that Rey steps up and is the goddamn dad for once.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.400
And then maybe later when this happens,

32:16.400 --> 32:18.800
Robbie plays some integral role and helps Rey out.

32:18.800 --> 32:21.800
Like, maybe Robbie is the guy who grabs onto him and pulls him back out

32:21.800 --> 32:24.600
instead of this random guy we've never met.

32:24.600 --> 32:26.000
And then they all three realize that,

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
yeah, they did need each other, something something,

32:28.000 --> 32:31.800
and father-son develop a sense of, you know, something, mutual respect, whatever,

32:31.800 --> 32:34.000
something that pays off the setup.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.600
And it was not a bad setup,

32:35.600 --> 32:38.400
but it needed to find some sense of organic resolution,

32:38.400 --> 32:42.200
or your audience is gonna be pissed that they spent the last two hours with these people.

32:43.200 --> 32:45.800
Which is more or less what happened.

32:45.800 --> 32:48.200
The problem of invasion narratives in general

32:48.200 --> 32:52.800
is that they're really difficult to resolve in ways that aren't just transparently unrealistic.

32:54.400 --> 32:57.000
But moreover, especially for American-made films,

32:57.000 --> 32:58.800
revenge is often a key element.

32:58.800 --> 33:00.800
Get off my plane.

33:00.800 --> 33:02.800
We want revenge against the invaders,

33:02.800 --> 33:05.000
and War of the Worlds 05 didn't deliver.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.800
It just kind of peters out,

33:06.800 --> 33:09.200
as does the narrative about Rey and his family.

33:09.200 --> 33:11.800
Both the invasion narrative and the character narrative

33:11.800 --> 33:16.200
just kind of slops out at the end like a dying alien out of a tripod.

33:16.200 --> 33:18.200
American audiences in 2005,

33:18.200 --> 33:20.400
jacked up on war on terror propaganda

33:20.400 --> 33:23.200
and seeking narratives that provide a sense of revenge,

33:23.200 --> 33:25.200
were left cold by the film upon release.

33:25.200 --> 33:26.800
In the 14 years since,

33:26.800 --> 33:30.200
feelings have softened on it to the point that there's a sort of cultural amnesia

33:30.200 --> 33:32.400
of how much people hated it at the time.

33:32.400 --> 33:35.400
But that it's finally getting a more positive re-evaluation,

33:35.400 --> 33:37.200
or at least a more nuanced re-evaluation,

33:37.200 --> 33:38.800
is deserved in my opinion.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.800
Except, of course, the resolution.

33:41.400 --> 33:43.800
Part of why invasion narratives have fallen out of favor

33:43.800 --> 33:46.400
is that they're really hard to resolve with a happy ending.

33:46.400 --> 33:49.400
We were okay with a dumb happy ending in 1996,

33:49.400 --> 33:51.400
but not in 2005,

33:51.400 --> 33:53.400
and not really now either.

33:53.400 --> 33:56.400
It will never be 1996 again.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.800
You cannot go back to Independence Day.

33:58.800 --> 34:03.800
If we can conceive of an other enemy that is capable of defeating us so completely,

34:03.800 --> 34:07.200
it's harder to suspend disbelief that there is a way we could fight back

34:07.200 --> 34:08.800
and have a happy ending.

34:09.600 --> 34:13.800
Now, a completeness in an invasion narrative just doesn't feel narratively truthful

34:13.800 --> 34:16.800
that humanity could survive something so devastating.

34:16.800 --> 34:18.800
And it's not that invasion narratives are gone,

34:18.800 --> 34:21.800
but nowadays they tend to be secondary to the main conflicts.

34:21.800 --> 34:25.200
In movies like Avengers, Transformers, or even Man of Steel,

34:25.200 --> 34:27.600
the invasion only happens in the third act,

34:27.600 --> 34:30.400
and all of these movies involve super-powered beings

34:30.400 --> 34:33.400
or giant anthropomorphic robots protecting the Earth,

34:33.400 --> 34:36.800
not normal humans as in Independence Day or War of the Worlds.

34:36.800 --> 34:39.800
Moreover, the villains in these films are not like locusts.

34:39.800 --> 34:41.800
They're like locusts.

34:41.800 --> 34:44.400
They're moving from planet to planet.

34:44.400 --> 34:47.400
They are not intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic.

34:47.400 --> 34:52.000
Intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.800
They are, in effect, despite technically being aliens, human.

34:55.800 --> 34:59.200
Their motivations are clear and completely understandable to the audience.

34:59.200 --> 35:01.400
Movies with more straightforward alien invasions,

35:01.400 --> 35:03.400
as seen in films like Edge of Tomorrow,

35:03.400 --> 35:05.000
tend to be commercial failures.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.600
Now audiences want a twist,

35:06.600 --> 35:09.600
and the ones you do see tend to be low-budget suspense thrillers

35:09.600 --> 35:13.200
that have more in common with the horror genre and character studies

35:13.200 --> 35:14.600
than action sci-fi.

35:14.600 --> 35:18.400
Films like A Quiet Place and 10 Cloverfield Lane, for instance.

35:18.400 --> 35:20.600
So the alien invasion motif is not gone,

35:20.600 --> 35:23.600
but it's nothing like War of the Worlds or Independence Day.

35:23.600 --> 35:28.000
As filmgoers, we aren't really interested in villains we can't understand anymore.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
Part of that may be because we've culturally stared down an event

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
that we were unprepared for and incapable of adequately resolving,

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
in part because comprehending it would mean facing our own societal evil.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.400
So, an incomprehensible villain,

35:41.400 --> 35:44.200
mass audiences just aren't really interested in that anymore.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.600
And in the year of our Lord, 2019,

35:46.600 --> 35:49.400
I can think of a number of reasons why that might be.

35:52.400 --> 35:54.400
That's what I call a close encounter.

35:54.600 --> 35:57.600
Ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a

35:57.600 --> 36:00.800
Living in LA, I sure do sit in a lot of traffic,

36:00.800 --> 36:05.400
so I get most of my reading done with our good friends at Audible.

36:05.400 --> 36:08.200
With Audible, you get access to an unbeatable selection of audiobooks,

36:08.200 --> 36:13.000
including bestsellers, motivation, mystery, thrillers, memoirs, and more.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Audible members can choose three titles every month,

36:15.000 --> 36:17.400
one audiobook, and two Audible Originals.

36:17.400 --> 36:20.000
Orson Welles' original radio drama from the 1930s,

36:20.000 --> 36:23.600
which I used a very small amount of in this episode, is on Audible.

36:23.800 --> 36:27.200
There's a War of the Worlds musical that is an Audible Original,

36:27.200 --> 36:30.000
so you get that on top of your free Audible credit.

36:30.800 --> 36:32.200
How could you say no?

36:32.200 --> 36:34.200
Listen on any device, anytime, anywhere,

36:34.200 --> 36:37.600
and you'll also enjoy easy audiobook exchanges, rollover, credits,

36:37.600 --> 36:41.600
and an audiobook library you keep forever, even if you cancel.

36:41.600 --> 36:45.600
It started with a 30-day trial when you go to audible.com slash lindsayellis

36:45.600 --> 36:52.600
or text lindsayellis to 500-500 and listen for a change.
