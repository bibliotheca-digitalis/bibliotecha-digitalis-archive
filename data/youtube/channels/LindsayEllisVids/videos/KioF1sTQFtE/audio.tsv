0	6240	The Franco-Prussian War was a conflict between the Second French Empire and the Northern
6240	10640	German Confederation led by the Kingdom of Prussia, which, owing to the German's superior
10640	14920	strength and numbers, quickly led to the capitulation of the French Empire and the capture of its
14920	17080	emperor, Napoleon III.
17080	20960	The conflict culminated with the Siege of Paris in the winter of 1871, in which the
20960	23480	German troops invaded the French capital.
23480	27520	Months later, the German states unified into a German Empire, shifting the balance of power
27520	30680	in Europe towards a now unified, powerful Germany.
30680	34880	Britain, who mostly stayed out of it, of course kept a close eye on the conflict, and all
34880	38660	the major newspapers, journals, and magazines reported at length on the course of the War
38660	43840	of 1870 and on the prospects for the British in the changed Europe of 1871.
43840	47660	Out of this national obsession with the conflict in Europe emerged a short story written by
47660	53260	ex-soldier George Tompkins Chesney, The Battle of Dorking in 1871.
53260	57540	The Battle of Dorking recounts the final days before and during a fictionalized, devastating
57540	62420	invasion of Britain by a German-speaking enemy, retold fifty years after the fact by a nameless
62420	66700	narrator to his grandchildren, who have grown up in a contested Britain that is now a heavily
66700	69020	taxed annex of the enemy.
69020	73500	The German-speaking invaders are never named, and are instead referred to obliquely as the
73500	77060	Other Power, or the Enemy.
77060	80740	Battle of Dorking was not only an overnight national sensation and controversy.
80740	84380	Most readers saw the idea that the greatest imperial power in the world could be invaded,
84380	86820	let alone could cease to exist, was ludicrous.
86820	89820	But for many, it was an indictment of nationalistic hubris.
89820	94740	For even more, it was an outrage, unmerited judgment, and a betrayal of Great Britain.
94740	99060	But Battle of Dorking would set off a trend of its own, one that literary historians would
99060	104100	eventually call Invasion Literature, fiction that spoke to the taboo and the thrill of
104100	108580	the obviously ludicrous idea that the sovereign empire of Britain could ever fall to a foreign
108580	109580	power.
109580	110900	But what if?
110900	116740	Between 1871 and 1914, over 60 works of fiction for adult readers describing hypothetical
116740	119100	invasions of Great Britain were published.
119100	123700	During that time, British writer H.G. Wells combined the popularity of Invasion Literature
123700	128740	with a widespread interest in the idea of life on Mars to pioneer a whole new genre,
128740	132700	one that has endured in popularity in some form ever since.
132700	133700	The alien invasion.
133700	151300	Here's an idea.
151300	157660	Aliens in fiction are never just aliens, just as monsters in fiction are never just monsters.
157660	161300	There is the literal function within the narrative, of course, but then there is that layer of
161300	165860	metaphor of significance to the culture that the work is being presented to, a significance
165860	171060	that may not even be obvious to either the author or the audience until some time later,
171060	172060	if ever.
172060	176140	So while I think it's not interesting to reduce a text to a one-to-one allegory, it
176140	182020	is important to be open to textual metaphor, especially where aliens come in, be they sympathetic,
182020	189780	threatening, beyond comprehension, or total gibberish.
189780	193580	Aliens as a narrative device can reflect a historically colonized people, they can
193580	198260	be the innocence of childhood, they can be some sort of spiritual revelation, they can
198260	202900	be a class oppressed by poverty, or the ravages of poverty itself.
202900	208220	Or they can be DUMB AS ROCKS.
208220	211620	Author and professor of English Frank McConnell describes Wells' Martians as,
211620	215620	What you fear most, what your culture and environment have taught you, is the worst
215620	219100	thing that could happen to you, the situation over which you would have the least degree
219420	220420	of control.
220420	223940	Wells was writing for an audience of Victorian Britons, whom he describes in the opening
223940	227740	of the novel as, secure in their empire over this earth.
227740	231060	Wells was writing for an audience for whom the very idea that intelligent beings from
231060	235100	another planet could be capable of launching an attack on the most powerful nation on earth
235100	237700	was a most bizarre and outlandish notion.
237700	241660	But the invasion narrative is a manifestation of different cultural anxieties in different
241660	242660	eras.
242660	246300	For instance, the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers came at the height of the McCarthy
246300	250700	era, and is just one of many invasion narratives that were released during the beginning of
250700	251700	the Cold War.
251700	257060	However, when I say an alien is never just an alien, I do not mean that the alien is
257060	261140	a one-to-one metaphor for something else, and that is a trap that a lot of people tend
261140	262140	to fall into.
262140	264140	Is that the terrorists?
264140	266980	Mmm, yes and no, Dakota Fanning.
266980	271460	Interpreting Animal Farm as a metaphor for totalitarian communism is great for your 8th
271460	274860	grade English class, but metaphor is rarely that simple.
274860	278500	Invasion narratives capture the ecosystem of the culture in which they were made, what
278500	280420	that culture fears most.
280420	284700	With that in mind, we are going to compare invasion narratives from two wildly different
284700	289420	cultures, America in the 1990s, and America in 2005.
289420	293420	My lovely lady lumps, check it out.
293420	295420	We're going to live on.
295420	298420	We're going to survive.
298420	303420	Today, we celebrate our Independence Day.
303980	307500	Independence Day is a 1996 film directed by Roland Emmerich, starring Will Smith, Jeff
307500	311740	Goldblum, and Bill Pullman, each playing characters experiencing different perspectives during
311740	317700	an alien invasion, that of a soldier, a scientist, and the President of the United States, respectively.
317700	321140	Over the course of the film, the invading alien horde wipes out most major cities on
321140	325980	the planet, and all hope seems lost until the scientist devises a computer virus which,
325980	329860	with the help of the soldier, he is able to upload into the mothership, disabling all
329860	331200	subordinate ships.
331200	335240	This enables the American military not only to destroy the local ship threatening them,
335240	338560	but also to instruct the rest of the world on how to do the same.
338560	340560	And the remnants of humanity celebrate.
340560	343560	Didn't I promise you fireworks?
343560	344560	Yeah.
348560	351560	It is dumb as a bag of rocks, and it is one of my favorite movies.
351560	352560	I love it.
352560	357560	War of the Worlds is a 2005 film directed by Steven Spielberg, starring Tom Cruise.
357560	359560	Get a hug?
359920	361920	Using handshake?
361920	363920	Kicking the teeth?
363920	367920	The film follows dock worker and inadequate father, Ray Ferrier, on the rare weekend when
367920	372400	he has custody of his two children, in which an alien invasion happens and he tries to
372400	373680	protect them.
373680	377520	As their circumstances become increasingly desperate, they narrowly escape certain deaths
377520	381520	several times, and eventually Ray is separated from his oldest child.
381520	385400	The film concludes when all family members are reunited, and the aliens die from their
385400	387920	lack of immunity to the planet's pathogens.
389920	393920	It is a stone-cold bummer, and I also kind of love it.
393920	397920	Despite taking place over a century after the novel takes place, the bones of Wells'
397920	398920	story remain intact.
398920	402920	The invasion is seen from the perspective of one character, it is more an episodic survival
402920	406920	narrative than anything else, the tripods are fairly faithful, the narrator is tested
406920	411920	by another character driven to madness whom he must kill in order to survive, and the
411920	415920	invasion is stopped not by human ingenuity, but by a lack of immunity.
416280	423280	They were undone, destroyed, after all of man's weapons and devices had failed, by
423280	427280	the tiniest creatures that God and his wisdom put upon this earth.
427280	430280	In this way, Spielberg's adaptation is perhaps the most faithful.
430280	434280	But War of the Worlds isn't like, say, Les Miserables, where it's the same characters
434280	436280	and basically the same story each time.
436280	441280	War of the Worlds is not a classic story, per se, it is more of a classic premise.
441280	444280	And the characters themselves are totally different in each iteration.
444640	448640	Spielberg himself has pointed out that adaptations of War of the Worlds tend to come about in
448640	453140	times of cultural stress, with the two most well-known adaptations, besides the 05 version
453140	458640	being Orson Welles' radio drama from 1938, and the film adaptation from 1953.
458640	462720	And of course there was the original novel, a twist on a trend in invasion literature
462720	467280	released during a period of growing international tension in Europe where everyone kind of sensed
467280	469560	that a great war was on the horizon.
469600	474240	So while the 1890s was technically a time of peace in the UK, it was a peace squished
474240	478840	between recent violence and the massive sense of tension growing throughout Europe.
478840	482960	But War of the Worlds is also read as a biting critique of British imperialism, encouraging
482960	487800	the reader to consider the world from the perspective of a people being invaded by colonizers.
487800	490800	Welles states this explicitly in the first chapter of the novel,
500300	504600	The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely swept out of existence in a
504600	509320	war of extermination waged by European immigrants in the space of 50 years.
509320	514240	Are we such apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?
514240	518120	I bring this up because the context in which War of the Worlds the novel became a success
518120	524200	in the 1890s, and the context in which Independence Day became a success in the 1990s, are perhaps
524200	527760	more analogous to each other than the 2005 adaptation.
527760	531400	Both Independence Day and Welles' novel came about during times of relative peace
531400	536040	and prosperity for the people living in the dominant world power of the day, and both
536040	540600	preceded violent upheavals that would completely change those cultures forever.
540600	544760	Of course, the huge difference between Independence Day and Welles' original War of the Worlds
544760	549180	is that Welles encourages the reader to reflect on their own position as citizens of an imperial
549180	552360	power built on the exploitation of other people.
552360	554640	Independence Day?
554640	555640	Not so much.
556520	558520	Welcome to Earth.
558520	560320	Dumb as rocks.
560320	565280	In Independence Day, the aliens lest reflect a broad cultural anxiety so much as arrogance.
565280	570480	Yes, this incomprehensible technological force is impressive, but it cannot withstand the
570480	575000	might of American ingenuity and hegemony, a bizarre and outlandish notion.
575000	576000	Peace!
582200	585400	So what do the aliens in War of the Worlds reflect?
586160	587160	Is that the terrorists?
587160	589160	Well, kind of?
594160	600440	The America of 1996 and the America of 2005 may as well exist in different dimensions.
600440	602440	Here is 90s Batman.
602440	603440	Seven million.
603440	605440	Never leave the cave without it.
605440	607440	And here is 2000s Batman.
607440	608440	I swear to God.
608440	609440	Swear to me!
609440	614160	The 90s had a very different, shall we say, mouthfeel.
614200	618920	The white, middle-class, film-going public of 1996 didn't have much to worry about.
618920	623400	Cold War's over, economy's booming, every middle school dance is getting jiggy with
623400	626440	a charming little ditty called the Macarena.
626440	632280	And Hollywood is spending a lot of time in thought exercises of, what if X disaster?
632280	639400	We got tornadoes, we got volcanoes, we got sharks, we got asteroids, we got more asteroids.
639400	641680	Just destroy everything.
641680	642680	It's fun.
643680	648400	Here was an ecosystem in which we can release a movie like Mars Attacks, which was released
648400	652600	the same year as Independence Day, and they could just blow up Congress willy-nilly and
652600	653600	hey, it's funny.
653600	656600	They blew up Congress!
656600	660760	Americans were bored and disconnected from any kind of real social anxieties, and disaster
660760	665000	movies were an effective outlet to get some quick, easy thrills and enjoy some blameless
665000	666000	conflict.
666000	669000	I'm back!
669000	671480	It's a funpocalypse.
671480	680720	So compare this to the genuine, visceral terror we see in War of the Worlds.
680720	684520	There isn't really any horror in seeing these symbols of American hegemony destroyed in
684520	686800	the most complete and terrible way.
686800	689960	Even now, it's not framed to be an uncomfortable thing to watch.
689960	695360	In fact, it's kind of awesome.
695360	697040	It's still kind of awesome.
697040	701000	Here was a film where little children stare upon the smoldering ruins of the only home
701000	703400	they have ever known and say things like,
703400	705600	What happened, Mommy?
705600	708760	Here is a film in which tens of millions of people have died.
708760	712240	And this man, whose family is missing, presumed dead, responds with,
712240	713240	No, sir.
713240	717160	Just a little anxious to get up there and whoop E.T.'s ass, that's all.
717160	721220	The 90s was a time in which it made narrative sense for aliens to ominously show up over
721220	726600	major cities, and a lot of people are like, yeah, they come in peace.
726600	732520	People dancing on top of the skyscraper like, woo, it's the 90s, did you catch Seinfeld
732520	733880	last night?
733880	738080	Aliens show up ominously, and our dingbat president doesn't even evacuate the cities.
738080	742640	But it's okay, because he heroically plays a saxopho- I mean, he flies a plane, and he
742640	745000	shoots the aliens, and America saves the day.
745000	749000	I'm a combat pilot, Will.
749000	751160	I belong in the air.
751160	755000	And the film was dumb in ways that aren't immediately obvious, like the sheer amount
755000	759120	of time people spend on the phone in this movie, but no one ever allows any time for
759120	760560	information to be conveyed.
760560	764560	This is the Secretary of Defense.
764560	765560	Yes.
765560	769440	Uh, Mr. President, there are aliens outside.
769440	772640	Could you say that again?
772640	773640	Aliens, sir.
773640	778200	So playing on this idea of movie monsters, and invading aliens in particular, embodying
778200	784120	cultural anxieties, why is the tone of the invasion narrative so different in 2005 as
784160	786200	it is from 1996?
786200	789960	Well, this is another entry into my ongoing series called
789960	799200	Ignoring the seriousness of the massive loss of life and the scar to the national psyche,
799200	803840	another pop culture casualty of the most destructive act of terrorism in modern history, at least
803840	806800	for a time, the disaster movie.
806800	811320	Gone were the days of goofy action movies like Independence Day and Godzilla and Wild
811600	812600	West.
812600	815080	No more disaster movies for these jaded masses.
815080	819360	The few stragglers that were in production before 9-11 and crept in after were released,
819360	821520	ignored, and forgotten just as quickly.
821520	826440	According to the Los Angeles Times in 2002, the public appetite for plots involving disasters
826440	828520	and terrorism has vanished.
828520	833160	Obviously, this did not stick, but for a while, filmmakers did not know how to approach mass
833160	836720	destruction in film, so they just didn't.
836720	841200	When big destructive action movies did eventually begin to edge their way back into theaters,
841200	843080	things were different.
843080	847720	A movie like Independence Day no longer makes sense in a post-9-11 world in which audiences
847720	851880	have actually lived through watching the destruction of familiar landmarks and mass casualties
851880	852880	on live television.
852880	857320	So Spielberg wants to create an invasion narrative that works in a post-9-11 world.
857320	858520	But there's a problem, see.
862840	868760	War of the Worlds is, in many ways, a response to, if not refutation of, Independence Day.
869080	869880	This...
872280	873800	evolves into this...
880920	881800	This...
883480	884760	evolves into this...
889960	891960	and this, my favorite subtle dig...
899320	904160	One of the biggest differences is the focus on what is being destroyed, what is at stake.
904160	908520	In Independence Day, it is landmarks, buildings, cities, etc.
908520	911920	In The War of the Worlds, there is much more focus on the loss of human life.
911920	915640	The closest thing we get to big landmark destruction is the Bayonne Bridge.
915640	920520	The horror comes not from mass destruction of landmarks and buildings, but from individuals.
920520	923400	We see their faces as they are zapped out of existence.
923400	925960	We see crowds as they are vaporized en masse.
925960	930120	Roland's extermination is one of symbols, Spielberg's, of human life.
930120	933160	The most obvious refutation of Independence Day is the tone,
933160	937840	which turns big, optimistic 90s bombast into a low-saturation death march.
937840	941960	Where, as with all of Roland's movies, the fall of civilization brings people together,
941960	946320	in War of the Worlds, the fall of civilization turns people into self-serving animals.
948280	951400	Which becomes a problem with the film in and of itself.
951400	952600	We'll get to that.
952600	957840	But at the same time, Independence Day as a film codified a lot of generic staples in shorthand,
957840	959880	which War of the Worlds certainly borrows.
959880	961440	For instance, there's this.
966360	969360	Followed then by the powering up sounds of the primary weapon.
977520	980960	And of course, there is the design of the invaders.
982600	993400	This is not to imply that the Independence Day aliens are the most original design ever.
993400	997800	Again, they're basically just Roswell aliens, only a little, you know, gooey-er.
997800	1004880	In part because it's implied in Independence Day that the Roswell aliens inspired our pop-cultural ideas of what aliens look like.
1004880	1009240	But in War of the Worlds, there's no in-universe reason like that for them to look the way that they do,
1009240	1012800	only the real-world context of coming out after Independence Day,
1012800	1015120	and of Independence Day setting a standard.
1015120	1018000	So they end up looking pretty identical.
1018000	1022080	Only I guess these guys have mouths, so they can go, bleh.
1023280	1028000	The aliens themselves also show up a little too late in the film to be anything really unfamiliar-looking.
1028000	1031720	This is a balancing act in any visual medium when you have a non-human creature.
1031720	1035680	The more alien they look, the more time the audience has to spend getting used to them.
1035680	1038280	In War of the Worlds, they don't show up until Act 3,
1038280	1042640	so they pretty much have to look like what our preconceived idea of an alien will look like,
1042640	1044360	or it's just gonna be confusing.
1044360	1050440	But this comes after an hour of the sheer, unadulterated, terrifying, eldritch horror that is the tripods.
1050440	1055520	(*tripod whirring*)
1055520	1059360	You spend hours building this up, and then we get... this.
1059520	1063880	(*tripod whirring*)
1063880	1066120	A scene which is the second scene in a row,
1066120	1069600	which is a cut-right ripoff from the raptor scene from Jurassic Park.
1069600	1073240	(*tripod whirring*)
1073240	1075360	Now let's do this scene again, but worse.
1075360	1077640	(*raptor growling*)
1077640	1080360	I personally would rather not have seen the aliens,
1080360	1083120	you know, maybe have a hand at the end of the movie, but that's it.
1083120	1087600	But showing them at all also contradicts the greater horror slant that War of the Worlds is going for.
1087600	1090680	It's going for a more stylistically real invasion,
1090680	1093760	where Independence Day is big and cartoonish from the get-go.
1093760	1096160	-"Is that glass bulletproof?" -"No, sir."
1096160	1097760	(*raptor growling*)
1097760	1100240	(*explosion*)
1100240	1104840	So seeing these big-eyed, cute aliens feels incongruently silly.
1107560	1111560	It's like if Schumacher's Riddler showed up in a Chris Nolan Batman movie.
1111560	1113920	-"You're as blind as a bat!"
1113920	1115440	-"Do I look like a cop?"
1115440	1117400	(*gunshots*)
1117400	1122360	But we saw him in Independence Day, so I guess we gotta do it here, too.
1123440	1127920	So War of the Worlds already has this problem of existing in the shadow of Independence Day.
1127920	1133320	Now it has to walk this tightrope of that, and also existing in a post-911 hellscape.
1133320	1135120	Can Spielberg do it?
1135120	1138120	Well, honestly, the answer was yes...
1138120	1139320	...for the first half of the film.
1139320	1144200	-♪♪♪♪
1144200	1148000	In a time as complicated and shitty as the mid-Bush administration years...
1148000	1149000	-"Check it out!"
1149000	1153400	...this is not to say that the War of the Worlds aliens are really embodiments of terrorism.
1153400	1154800	-"Is that the terrorists?"
1154800	1159000	Spielberg's intent here is less to say that terrorists are literally invading aliens,
1159000	1165000	than to tap into that sense of helplessness and impotent desire for retaliation Americans felt after 9-11.
1165000	1167600	-"Now we'll be the ones coming up from underground."
1167600	1170600	...of trying to capture that feeling through genre fiction.
1170600	1171800	-"Oh my God!"
1171800	1176400	There's the misguided impulse to get back at an enemy you don't understand, or even know how to fight.
1176400	1181600	-"We catch up with these soldiers, hook up with whoever else is in debt, and we get back at them!
1181600	1183600	We get- we get back at them!"
1183600	1187000	The rage and terror that something could threaten all this power and security
1187000	1190000	that you didn't realize you never even really had.
1191400	1194400	And in terms of sheer imagery, there is a lot in here.
1194400	1200000	Even the very first shot of the film, we swoop in on the backdrop of the place where the World Trade Center...
1200000	1201400	used to be.
1201400	1203200	Taking it a step further...
1203200	1204600	-"There's all this stuff all over you."
1204600	1208200	Well, this image of Tom Cruise covered in grey dust is, um...
1208800	1210200	It's- it's loaded.
1210200	1212200	-"The top floors collapsed down!
1214200	1218000	I saw it blow, and then ran like hell, thank God!"
1218000	1219600	As is this scene.
1221000	1223400	It's not that aliens equals terrorists,
1223400	1228000	it's Spielberg's ultimate statement on living in an America that no longer feels secure.
1228000	1232600	We can't just mindlessly enjoy the cinematic destruction of a major city or landmark
1232600	1235800	because we had just gone through this in real life.
1235800	1238000	But none of these things are deal-breakers.
1238000	1242200	Obviously, mass destruction of cities makes their way back into the movies eventually,
1242200	1246200	and a dark tone in a monster movie is a totally valid creative decision.
1246200	1250000	With War of the Worlds, I think most people agree that it sours in the second half.
1250000	1254600	People like to complain about the illogic of aliens burying tripods underground,
1254600	1258200	or wouldn't they have known about the common cold, that sort of thing.
1258200	1263000	But if I can forgive that sort of thing in Independence Day, I can definitely forgive it here.
1263000	1267600	No, where War of the Worlds goes wrong is honestly a little simpler than that.
1272000	1276600	One clear example of the problem with the structure of the story is the inconsistent theming.
1276600	1280400	In direct contrast, I would say intentional direct contrast,
1280400	1283600	to Roland's optimism of disaster bringing humanity together,
1284600	1287400	I'm not Jewish. Nobody's perfect.
1287400	1290000	Here, disaster turns humans into animals.
1290000	1293200	Now listen, put down the gun. I'm taking the car.
1293200	1296600	Throughout the film, we see the increasing intensity of this theme.
1296600	1300600	Rey must protect his children from other humans as much as he does from the aliens.
1300600	1305200	And before we get to the end, he must kill another man to protect his daughter.
1305200	1307200	I can't let my daughter die because of you.
1307200	1311000	But then we work together when the plot needs us to.
1311200	1314000	Suddenly at the end of the movie, with no change in circumstance,
1314000	1317000	humans aren't barbarous animals, and suddenly it's teamwork.
1317000	1319000	Everybody down!
1319000	1322400	So, are humans monsters or aren't they?
1322400	1325600	So, War of the Worlds is about this one guy's relationship to his children
1325600	1329000	and how that is tested by apocalyptic alien invasion.
1329000	1332400	This is relevant because the aliens are, at the emotional core of the film,
1332400	1334800	what tests the strength of the family unit.
1334800	1340800	Rey, the inadequate father, is forced for the first time in his life to take responsibility for his family.
1340800	1342800	Can he do it?
1342800	1345600	You're an asshole. I hate coming here.
1345600	1348400	It's a solid conceit and firm grounding for a screenplay.
1348400	1351800	And for the first half of the film, it executes this fairly well.
1351800	1358000	But, you know, it kind of looks like the screenplay didn't have an answer to that question.
1358000	1359400	Just look at that ending.
1359400	1361400	Hey, Dad.
1361400	1364400	And no, I don't mean how the aliens are defeated.
1364400	1368400	Although I'm not a stickler for faithful adaptations, that is not the problem here.
1368400	1371400	The resolution for the characters is the problem.
1371400	1374400	Unlike Roland's trademark cast of thousands,
1374400	1378000	War of the Worlds features a cast of four.
1378000	1379200	Well, I take that back.
1379200	1383200	You have the two A-listers, one this kid and Tim Robbins,
1383200	1388000	whose introduction brings the film's momentum to a screeching halt from which it never recovers.
1388000	1390800	This movie did not need humanity to save the day.
1390800	1395400	It needed a satisfactory arc for these three characters we spend the entire movie with.
1395400	1400000	And that, and not how the aliens are defeated, is the core of this narrative.
1400000	1402600	And it's kind of a hot mess.
1406600	1408200	For instance, Rachel.
1408200	1409200	Dear Rachel.
1409200	1411000	Hey, she said she could get it.
1411000	1412400	She said she could get it.
1412400	1413600	It's a Scott roller.
1413600	1415800	Mom clearly thinks she's incapable.
1415800	1417200	Dad says she can get it.
1417200	1418400	She said she could get it.
1418400	1421000	And it's almost like we're setting up a character arc here.
1421000	1424000	Like, Rachel's gonna realize that she could indeed get it,
1424000	1427800	even though mom and therapists coddle her to the point of being a complete deer in the head.
1427800	1428400	Nope!
1430600	1432400	Turns out Rachel can't get the bag.
1432400	1435200	A realistic kid and well-rounded character in the first half,
1435200	1438200	she's relegated to little more than a MacGuffin in Act 2,
1438200	1444200	and basically just a doe-eyed trauma figurine in what passes for Act 3 in this movie.
1444200	1447200	Which is kind of a problem for the second biggest character in your movie.
1447200	1451000	And here's the one spot where Independence Day is the superior film.
1451000	1454400	Despite having the trademark Roland Emmerich cast of thousands,
1454400	1458600	all of the character arcs are complete, and they work.
1458600	1462200	They're silly, but they are complete.
1462200	1466200	Roland manages to give all of them a starting point and a culminating moment.
1466200	1469800	President Clint Moore is faced with a country beginning to doubt his adequacy.
1469800	1472000	They elected a warrior and they got a wimp.
1472000	1475600	But through a series of trial and error, including the use of nuclear weapons,
1475600	1477600	May our children forgive us.
1477600	1479000	Whoopsie-daisy.
1479000	1482000	He self-actualizes by firing his Secretary of Defense,
1482000	1485600	and he becomes the warrior the country needed.
1485600	1486400	Literally.
1486400	1488600	Eagle One.
1488600	1490000	Fox Three.
1490000	1492400	Captain Hiller aspires to fly the Space Shuttle,
1492400	1494800	a privilege which he is repeatedly denied.
1494800	1497800	But after a series of conflicts and flying around a lot,
1497800	1504000	he arguably becomes the most qualified person on the planet to fly the alien shuttle.
1504000	1505800	I've been waiting for this my whole life.
1506000	1510400	And David starts with his father and his ex-wife berating him for being a lazy genius.
1510400	1512200	So tell me something. Are you so smart?
1512200	1515200	How come you spent eight years in MIT to become a cable repairman?
1515200	1518200	But in the end, not only does he rise above his inadequacy,
1518200	1521200	his genius literally saves the world.
1521200	1524200	You know how I'm like I'm always trying to save the planet?
1528200	1529200	Here's my chance.
1529200	1531600	There are three separate and distinguishable arcs here,
1531600	1533400	and they are all set up really well,
1533400	1536400	so the audience is very clear about who's accomplishing what,
1536400	1539800	based on whose skill set by the time Act 3 rolls around,
1539800	1541600	and we need to see those skills in action.
1541600	1543800	Hell, even the Randy Quaid subplot,
1543800	1546600	which seems genuinely pointless for most of the film,
1546600	1549400	ends up being one of the most important elements in the movie.
1549400	1551400	His motivation by way of his kids,
1551400	1553000	why he's drunk all the time.
1553000	1553800	Oh, yeah.
1553800	1555800	Seems years back our boy here was kidnapped by aliens,
1555800	1558400	did all kind of experiments on him and such.
1558400	1559600	Tell him about it, Russ.
1559600	1560800	His skill as a pilot.
1560800	1561400	All of it.
1561400	1563000	You know, we see it for a reason.
1563000	1564200	So when it culminates...
1566200	1568200	All right, you alien assholes!
1568200	1570600	Oh, yeah.
1570600	1571600	Sure.
1572000	1574200	Oh, boys!
1574200	1578600	I'm back!
1578600	1582000	Wheeee!
1582000	1584600	War of the Worlds, for all its masterful tension building,
1584600	1586000	beautiful cinematography,
1586000	1587200	genius sound design,
1587200	1589800	and pretty good first half of a screenplay,
1590000	1594600	does not have the same level of build-up and payoff as Independence Day.
1594600	1597600	If you compare the three main character arcs in Independence Day,
1597600	1600400	each cheesy but complete in its own little world,
1600400	1603200	to the one protagonist character arc in War of the Worlds,
1603200	1605800	what is Rey's culminating moment?
1605800	1607600	He is set up as an inadequate father,
1607600	1611200	a blue-collar kind of guy who does not know how to take care of his children,
1611200	1614000	and only endures his custody weekends out of obligation.
1614000	1615200	And when the aliens invade,
1615200	1618400	he is forced into a situation where he must care for his children,
1618400	1619600	all the while said children,
1619600	1621400	a teenage boy on the verge of manhood,
1621400	1623400	and a confused neurotic preteen,
1623400	1625200	are actually acting their age.
1625200	1626400	Rachel, shut up, Rachel!
1626400	1627800	I can't sleep in your house!
1627800	1628800	Look, I'm driving!
1628800	1631400	Rey does not know how to take responsibility for them,
1631400	1633800	but through the situation, he is forced to.
1633800	1636800	And the screenwriters didn't seem to know where to go with that.
1636800	1638400	And this is where the movie falls apart.
1638400	1640800	Robbie is constantly wanting to get out and break free,
1640800	1642200	and be a man,
1642200	1643800	but break free from what?
1643800	1646800	You only chose Boston because you hope Mom's there,
1646800	1649200	and if she's there, you can dump us on her!
1649200	1651000	Rey's not an overbearing father,
1651000	1654600	he doesn't even give Robbie a slap on the wrist when he steals his car.
1654600	1655800	Yeah, Robbie?
1656800	1659800	Why, I might just smack my own hand.
1659800	1663800	Nor is Robbie given any motivation to find some greater calling in Act 1.
1663800	1667400	He doesn't lose anyone, or see the initial carnage Rey saw,
1667400	1668800	so this...
1668800	1670800	We catch up with these soldiers,
1670800	1672400	hook up with whoever else is in debt,
1672400	1673800	and we get back at them!
1673800	1676800	...is the idiotic, macho blathering of a teenage boy
1676800	1679000	who has no idea what he's talking about.
1679000	1681200	So by the time the movie starts to fall apart,
1681200	1683800	Robbie has shown no maturation.
1683800	1685400	And then this happens.
1685400	1686400	Robbie?
1687200	1688000	Stay together!
1688000	1689000	Robbie.
1689000	1689600	Robbie.
1689600	1690200	Robbie, no.
1690200	1691600	Ro- Robbie, come back.
1691600	1694200	Robbie, no, you're gonna- you're gonna ruin the movie, Robbie.
1694200	1695000	Get back here!
1695000	1697400	What, what do you think you're gonna be the Randy Quaid of this movie?
1697400	1699400	This movie doesn't get a Randy Quaid, Robbie!
1699400	1701000	It's not 1996 anymore!
1701000	1703400	Please let me go. You need to let me go.
1703600	1705800	So now Robbie is basically out of the movie,
1705800	1710000	and despite idiotically running into a gigantic fireball...
1710800	1711800	Don't worry.
1711800	1714400	Everyone makes it to Grandma's house in the end.
1715200	1716000	He's fine.
1719800	1722800	It's not even that Robbie needed to die in the fireball.
1722800	1725800	It's that he needed a different story arc altogether.
1725800	1727200	If they wanted it to be,
1727200	1729600	Rey realizes Robbie's a man,
1729600	1731200	they should have built it to that.
1731200	1734800	Because Robbie, as Rit, is a complete dipshit.
1734800	1738400	Between these balls, we go back there and find one of those things and kill it.
1738400	1741800	Every action he takes is immature, spiteful, and wrong-headed.
1741800	1745600	Now let's try one that doesn't involve your ten-year-old sister joining the army!
1745600	1747800	The movie begins with him stealing Rey's car,
1747800	1750000	and he does not mature past this.
1750000	1752800	He never once earns the trust that Rey deigned to give him.
1752800	1757000	There's never a moment where Robbie and Rey learn to respect each other as men.
1757000	1757800	So this?
1757800	1760400	Please let me go. You need to let me go.
1760400	1761200	It's like...
1762200	1764200	Where the hell did that come from?
1764200	1767000	Let's draw a comparison to one of cinema's most famous
1767000	1768800	you-need-to-let-go moments.
1768800	1771200	When Marlin and Dory are trapped in a whale,
1771200	1774200	and Marlin has to make a metaphorical leap of faith...
1774200	1778200	He says it's time to let go!
1778200	1780200	Everything's gonna be alright!
1780200	1782800	This is a culminating moment for Marlin's character.
1782800	1784800	Marlin is an overprotective father.
1784800	1785600	He's overbearing.
1785600	1786600	He's overcompensating.
1786600	1787600	He's neurotic.
1787600	1790400	He has already endured the horrible loss of his wife,
1790400	1792600	which makes the loss of Nemo his greatest fear,
1792600	1795000	and literally the worst thing that could happen to him.
1795000	1798200	How do you know something bad isn't gonna happen?
1798200	1799800	I don't!
1799800	1802400	So Marlin letting go in the face of uncertainty
1802400	1804600	is a signifier of character growth.
1804600	1806200	Rey, on the other hand...
1806200	1807200	Meh.
1807200	1808200	He's a bad father.
1808200	1810000	He makes no room in his life for his children.
1810000	1811200	He is a poor caretaker,
1811200	1813000	and he takes no interest in their lives.
1813000	1816400	I'm allergic to peanut butter.
1816400	1817400	Since when?
1818200	1818800	Birth.
1818800	1822000	So what sense does it make for this to be any kind of culminating moment?
1822000	1824200	It's a kid who's trying to break free from a dad
1824200	1827000	who was never really there for him in the first place.
1827000	1829200	And Rey is eventually like,
1829200	1831200	Okay.
1831200	1832200	Do whatever you want.
1832200	1835200	Yes, I see that the movie is trying to push that it's building up,
1835200	1837200	that this is Robbie crossing into manhood
1837200	1839400	and Rey learning to respect him as a man.
1839400	1840600	But this does not work,
1840600	1844400	given how obviously wrongheaded his moves to be a man have been
1844400	1845600	and continue to be.
1845600	1846800	Please let me go.
1846800	1848200	You need to let me go.
1848200	1849200	Nope.
1849200	1852400	If we need balls, we go back there and find one of those things and kill it.
1852400	1855800	So it's at this point in the narrative that we trade in Robbie for Tim Robbins
1855800	1858200	and spend the next 40 minutes in a basement.
1858200	1860800	Tim Robbins slides into the role of Robbie in the narrative
1860800	1863200	as the party who wants to fight back.
1863200	1864600	Why did you bring us here?
1864600	1866000	To fight them together.
1866000	1869400	Against the wishes of Rey, who is just trying to not die.
1869400	1871200	And it is the worst thing.
1871200	1873800	Now we'll be the ones coming up from underground.
1873800	1876200	Only we have no attachment to Tim Robbins.
1876200	1879000	He is crazy and he's just here now.
1879000	1880000	In the movie.
1880800	1883400	Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay...
1883400	1888000	So rather than making it a story about how Robbie and Rey reconcile these two approaches to,
1888000	1890200	you know, alien invasion,
1890200	1894800	all the while trying to keep the helpless girl child safe from the barbarousness of humanity,
1894800	1896000	we get Tim Robbins.
1896000	1897600	We're right under their feet, right?
1897600	1898600	Right here.
1898600	1899600	Under their feet.
1899600	1902600	So pretty much no matter what happens after Robbie leaves the narrative,
1902600	1905600	at least if he does consequence-free come back,
1905600	1906800	which is what happens,
1906800	1909600	it's not going to be satisfying to the audience as a story.
1909600	1911200	Because the payoff does not work,
1911200	1914200	either logically, thematically, emotionally,
1914200	1915200	with what was built up.
1915200	1916400	So this...
1918800	1920600	isn't the real problem.
1920600	1921600	This is.
1923600	1926200	I'm not saying it would have been better if Robbie never came back into the ne-
1926200	1927800	well, I mean, kind of would have.
1927800	1930600	It would have shown Rey that his inadequacy actually has a consequence.
1930600	1934600	But rather that Rey steps up and is the goddamn dad for once.
1934600	1936400	And then maybe later when this happens,
1936400	1938800	Robbie plays some integral role and helps Rey out.
1938800	1941800	Like, maybe Robbie is the guy who grabs onto him and pulls him back out
1941800	1944600	instead of this random guy we've never met.
1944600	1946000	And then they all three realize that,
1946000	1948000	yeah, they did need each other, something something,
1948000	1951800	and father-son develop a sense of, you know, something, mutual respect, whatever,
1951800	1954000	something that pays off the setup.
1954000	1955600	And it was not a bad setup,
1955600	1958400	but it needed to find some sense of organic resolution,
1958400	1962200	or your audience is gonna be pissed that they spent the last two hours with these people.
1963200	1965800	Which is more or less what happened.
1965800	1968200	The problem of invasion narratives in general
1968200	1972800	is that they're really difficult to resolve in ways that aren't just transparently unrealistic.
1974400	1977000	But moreover, especially for American-made films,
1977000	1978800	revenge is often a key element.
1978800	1980800	Get off my plane.
1980800	1982800	We want revenge against the invaders,
1982800	1985000	and War of the Worlds 05 didn't deliver.
1985000	1986800	It just kind of peters out,
1986800	1989200	as does the narrative about Rey and his family.
1989200	1991800	Both the invasion narrative and the character narrative
1991800	1996200	just kind of slops out at the end like a dying alien out of a tripod.
1996200	1998200	American audiences in 2005,
1998200	2000400	jacked up on war on terror propaganda
2000400	2003200	and seeking narratives that provide a sense of revenge,
2003200	2005200	were left cold by the film upon release.
2005200	2006800	In the 14 years since,
2006800	2010200	feelings have softened on it to the point that there's a sort of cultural amnesia
2010200	2012400	of how much people hated it at the time.
2012400	2015400	But that it's finally getting a more positive re-evaluation,
2015400	2017200	or at least a more nuanced re-evaluation,
2017200	2018800	is deserved in my opinion.
2018800	2020800	Except, of course, the resolution.
2021400	2023800	Part of why invasion narratives have fallen out of favor
2023800	2026400	is that they're really hard to resolve with a happy ending.
2026400	2029400	We were okay with a dumb happy ending in 1996,
2029400	2031400	but not in 2005,
2031400	2033400	and not really now either.
2033400	2036400	It will never be 1996 again.
2036400	2038800	You cannot go back to Independence Day.
2038800	2043800	If we can conceive of an other enemy that is capable of defeating us so completely,
2043800	2047200	it's harder to suspend disbelief that there is a way we could fight back
2047200	2048800	and have a happy ending.
2049600	2053800	Now, a completeness in an invasion narrative just doesn't feel narratively truthful
2053800	2056800	that humanity could survive something so devastating.
2056800	2058800	And it's not that invasion narratives are gone,
2058800	2061800	but nowadays they tend to be secondary to the main conflicts.
2061800	2065200	In movies like Avengers, Transformers, or even Man of Steel,
2065200	2067600	the invasion only happens in the third act,
2067600	2070400	and all of these movies involve super-powered beings
2070400	2073400	or giant anthropomorphic robots protecting the Earth,
2073400	2076800	not normal humans as in Independence Day or War of the Worlds.
2076800	2079800	Moreover, the villains in these films are not like locusts.
2079800	2081800	They're like locusts.
2081800	2084400	They're moving from planet to planet.
2084400	2087400	They are not intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic.
2087400	2092000	Intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic.
2092000	2095800	They are, in effect, despite technically being aliens, human.
2095800	2099200	Their motivations are clear and completely understandable to the audience.
2099200	2101400	Movies with more straightforward alien invasions,
2101400	2103400	as seen in films like Edge of Tomorrow,
2103400	2105000	tend to be commercial failures.
2105000	2106600	Now audiences want a twist,
2106600	2109600	and the ones you do see tend to be low-budget suspense thrillers
2109600	2113200	that have more in common with the horror genre and character studies
2113200	2114600	than action sci-fi.
2114600	2118400	Films like A Quiet Place and 10 Cloverfield Lane, for instance.
2118400	2120600	So the alien invasion motif is not gone,
2120600	2123600	but it's nothing like War of the Worlds or Independence Day.
2123600	2128000	As filmgoers, we aren't really interested in villains we can't understand anymore.
2128000	2131000	Part of that may be because we've culturally stared down an event
2131000	2135000	that we were unprepared for and incapable of adequately resolving,
2135000	2139000	in part because comprehending it would mean facing our own societal evil.
2139000	2141400	So, an incomprehensible villain,
2141400	2144200	mass audiences just aren't really interested in that anymore.
2144200	2146600	And in the year of our Lord, 2019,
2146600	2149400	I can think of a number of reasons why that might be.
2152400	2154400	That's what I call a close encounter.
2154600	2157600	Ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a
2157600	2160800	Living in LA, I sure do sit in a lot of traffic,
2160800	2165400	so I get most of my reading done with our good friends at Audible.
