1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
The Franco-Prussian War was a conflict between the Second French Empire and the Northern

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,640
German Confederation led by the Kingdom of Prussia, which, owing to the German's superior

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,920
strength and numbers, quickly led to the capitulation of the French Empire and the capture of its

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,080
emperor, Napoleon III.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,960
The conflict culminated with the Siege of Paris in the winter of 1871, in which the

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,480
German troops invaded the French capital.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,520
Months later, the German states unified into a German Empire, shifting the balance of power

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,680
in Europe towards a now unified, powerful Germany.

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Britain, who mostly stayed out of it, of course kept a close eye on the conflict, and all

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,660
the major newspapers, journals, and magazines reported at length on the course of the War

11
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:43,840
of 1870 and on the prospects for the British in the changed Europe of 1871.

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,660
Out of this national obsession with the conflict in Europe emerged a short story written by

13
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:53,260
ex-soldier George Tompkins Chesney, The Battle of Dorking in 1871.

14
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,540
The Battle of Dorking recounts the final days before and during a fictionalized, devastating

15
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,420
invasion of Britain by a German-speaking enemy, retold fifty years after the fact by a nameless

16
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,700
narrator to his grandchildren, who have grown up in a contested Britain that is now a heavily

17
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,020
taxed annex of the enemy.

18
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,500
The German-speaking invaders are never named, and are instead referred to obliquely as the

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,060
Other Power, or the Enemy.

20
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,740
Battle of Dorking was not only an overnight national sensation and controversy.

21
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,380
Most readers saw the idea that the greatest imperial power in the world could be invaded,

22
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,820
let alone could cease to exist, was ludicrous.

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,820
But for many, it was an indictment of nationalistic hubris.

24
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,740
For even more, it was an outrage, unmerited judgment, and a betrayal of Great Britain.

25
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,060
But Battle of Dorking would set off a trend of its own, one that literary historians would

26
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,100
eventually call Invasion Literature, fiction that spoke to the taboo and the thrill of

27
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,580
the obviously ludicrous idea that the sovereign empire of Britain could ever fall to a foreign

28
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,580
power.

29
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,900
But what if?

30
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:56,740
Between 1871 and 1914, over 60 works of fiction for adult readers describing hypothetical

31
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,100
invasions of Great Britain were published.

32
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,700
During that time, British writer H.G. Wells combined the popularity of Invasion Literature

33
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,740
with a widespread interest in the idea of life on Mars to pioneer a whole new genre,

34
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,700
one that has endured in popularity in some form ever since.

35
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,700
The alien invasion.

36
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:31,300
Here's an idea.

37
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:37,660
Aliens in fiction are never just aliens, just as monsters in fiction are never just monsters.

38
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,300
There is the literal function within the narrative, of course, but then there is that layer of

39
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,860
metaphor of significance to the culture that the work is being presented to, a significance

40
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:51,060
that may not even be obvious to either the author or the audience until some time later,

41
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,060
if ever.

42
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,140
So while I think it's not interesting to reduce a text to a one-to-one allegory, it

43
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:02,020
is important to be open to textual metaphor, especially where aliens come in, be they sympathetic,

44
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:09,780
threatening, beyond comprehension, or total gibberish.

45
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,580
Aliens as a narrative device can reflect a historically colonized people, they can

46
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:18,260
be the innocence of childhood, they can be some sort of spiritual revelation, they can

47
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,900
be a class oppressed by poverty, or the ravages of poverty itself.

48
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,220
Or they can be DUMB AS ROCKS.

49
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,620
Author and professor of English Frank McConnell describes Wells' Martians as,

50
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,620
What you fear most, what your culture and environment have taught you, is the worst

51
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,100
thing that could happen to you, the situation over which you would have the least degree

52
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,420
of control.

53
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,940
Wells was writing for an audience of Victorian Britons, whom he describes in the opening

54
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,740
of the novel as, secure in their empire over this earth.

55
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,060
Wells was writing for an audience for whom the very idea that intelligent beings from

56
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,100
another planet could be capable of launching an attack on the most powerful nation on earth

57
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,700
was a most bizarre and outlandish notion.

58
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,660
But the invasion narrative is a manifestation of different cultural anxieties in different

59
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,660
eras.

60
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,300
For instance, the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers came at the height of the McCarthy

61
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,700
era, and is just one of many invasion narratives that were released during the beginning of

62
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,700
the Cold War.

63
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:17,060
However, when I say an alien is never just an alien, I do not mean that the alien is

64
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,140
a one-to-one metaphor for something else, and that is a trap that a lot of people tend

65
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,140
to fall into.

66
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,140
Is that the terrorists?

67
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,980
Mmm, yes and no, Dakota Fanning.

68
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,460
Interpreting Animal Farm as a metaphor for totalitarian communism is great for your 8th

69
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,860
grade English class, but metaphor is rarely that simple.

70
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,500
Invasion narratives capture the ecosystem of the culture in which they were made, what

71
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,420
that culture fears most.

72
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,700
With that in mind, we are going to compare invasion narratives from two wildly different

73
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,420
cultures, America in the 1990s, and America in 2005.

74
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,420
My lovely lady lumps, check it out.

75
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,420
We're going to live on.

76
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,420
We're going to survive.

77
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:03,420
Today, we celebrate our Independence Day.

78
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,500
Independence Day is a 1996 film directed by Roland Emmerich, starring Will Smith, Jeff

79
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,740
Goldblum, and Bill Pullman, each playing characters experiencing different perspectives during

80
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:17,700
an alien invasion, that of a soldier, a scientist, and the President of the United States, respectively.

81
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,140
Over the course of the film, the invading alien horde wipes out most major cities on

82
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:25,980
the planet, and all hope seems lost until the scientist devises a computer virus which,

83
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,860
with the help of the soldier, he is able to upload into the mothership, disabling all

84
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,200
subordinate ships.

85
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,240
This enables the American military not only to destroy the local ship threatening them,

86
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,560
but also to instruct the rest of the world on how to do the same.

87
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,560
And the remnants of humanity celebrate.

88
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,560
Didn't I promise you fireworks?

89
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,560
Yeah.

90
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,560
It is dumb as a bag of rocks, and it is one of my favorite movies.

91
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,560
I love it.

92
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,560
War of the Worlds is a 2005 film directed by Steven Spielberg, starring Tom Cruise.

93
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,560
Get a hug?

94
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,920
Using handshake?

95
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,920
Kicking the teeth?

96
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,920
The film follows dock worker and inadequate father, Ray Ferrier, on the rare weekend when

97
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,400
he has custody of his two children, in which an alien invasion happens and he tries to

98
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,680
protect them.

99
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,520
As their circumstances become increasingly desperate, they narrowly escape certain deaths

100
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,520
several times, and eventually Ray is separated from his oldest child.

101
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,400
The film concludes when all family members are reunited, and the aliens die from their

102
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,920
lack of immunity to the planet's pathogens.

103
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,920
It is a stone-cold bummer, and I also kind of love it.

104
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,920
Despite taking place over a century after the novel takes place, the bones of Wells'

105
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,920
story remain intact.

106
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,920
The invasion is seen from the perspective of one character, it is more an episodic survival

107
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,920
narrative than anything else, the tripods are fairly faithful, the narrator is tested

108
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,920
by another character driven to madness whom he must kill in order to survive, and the

109
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,920
invasion is stopped not by human ingenuity, but by a lack of immunity.

110
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:03,280
They were undone, destroyed, after all of man's weapons and devices had failed, by

111
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,280
the tiniest creatures that God and his wisdom put upon this earth.

112
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,280
In this way, Spielberg's adaptation is perhaps the most faithful.

113
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,280
But War of the Worlds isn't like, say, Les Miserables, where it's the same characters

114
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,280
and basically the same story each time.

115
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,280
War of the Worlds is not a classic story, per se, it is more of a classic premise.

116
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,280
And the characters themselves are totally different in each iteration.

117
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,640
Spielberg himself has pointed out that adaptations of War of the Worlds tend to come about in

118
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,140
times of cultural stress, with the two most well-known adaptations, besides the 05 version

119
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:38,640
being Orson Welles' radio drama from 1938, and the film adaptation from 1953.

120
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,720
And of course there was the original novel, a twist on a trend in invasion literature

121
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,280
released during a period of growing international tension in Europe where everyone kind of sensed

122
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,560
that a great war was on the horizon.

123
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,240
So while the 1890s was technically a time of peace in the UK, it was a peace squished

124
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,840
between recent violence and the massive sense of tension growing throughout Europe.

125
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,960
But War of the Worlds is also read as a biting critique of British imperialism, encouraging

126
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,800
the reader to consider the world from the perspective of a people being invaded by colonizers.

127
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Welles states this explicitly in the first chapter of the novel,

128
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,600
The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely swept out of existence in a

129
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,320
war of extermination waged by European immigrants in the space of 50 years.

130
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,240
Are we such apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?

131
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,120
I bring this up because the context in which War of the Worlds the novel became a success

132
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:44,200
in the 1890s, and the context in which Independence Day became a success in the 1990s, are perhaps

133
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,760
more analogous to each other than the 2005 adaptation.

134
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,400
Both Independence Day and Welles' novel came about during times of relative peace

135
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:56,040
and prosperity for the people living in the dominant world power of the day, and both

136
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,600
preceded violent upheavals that would completely change those cultures forever.

137
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,760
Of course, the huge difference between Independence Day and Welles' original War of the Worlds

138
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,180
is that Welles encourages the reader to reflect on their own position as citizens of an imperial

139
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,360
power built on the exploitation of other people.

140
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,640
Independence Day?

141
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,640
Not so much.

142
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,520
Welcome to Earth.

143
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,320
Dumb as rocks.

144
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,280
In Independence Day, the aliens lest reflect a broad cultural anxiety so much as arrogance.

145
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,480
Yes, this incomprehensible technological force is impressive, but it cannot withstand the

146
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,000
might of American ingenuity and hegemony, a bizarre and outlandish notion.

147
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Peace!

148
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,400
So what do the aliens in War of the Worlds reflect?

149
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
Is that the terrorists?

150
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,160
Well, kind of?

151
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,440
The America of 1996 and the America of 2005 may as well exist in different dimensions.

152
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,440
Here is 90s Batman.

153
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
Seven million.

154
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,440
Never leave the cave without it.

155
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,440
And here is 2000s Batman.

156
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,440
I swear to God.

157
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
Swear to me!

158
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,160
The 90s had a very different, shall we say, mouthfeel.

159
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,920
The white, middle-class, film-going public of 1996 didn't have much to worry about.

160
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,400
Cold War's over, economy's booming, every middle school dance is getting jiggy with

161
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,440
a charming little ditty called the Macarena.

162
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:32,280
And Hollywood is spending a lot of time in thought exercises of, what if X disaster?

163
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:39,400
We got tornadoes, we got volcanoes, we got sharks, we got asteroids, we got more asteroids.

164
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,680
Just destroy everything.

165
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,680
It's fun.

166
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,400
Here was an ecosystem in which we can release a movie like Mars Attacks, which was released

167
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,600
the same year as Independence Day, and they could just blow up Congress willy-nilly and

168
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
hey, it's funny.

169
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,600
They blew up Congress!

170
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,760
Americans were bored and disconnected from any kind of real social anxieties, and disaster

171
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,000
movies were an effective outlet to get some quick, easy thrills and enjoy some blameless

172
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
conflict.

173
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm back!

174
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,480
It's a funpocalypse.

175
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:20,720
So compare this to the genuine, visceral terror we see in War of the Worlds.

176
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,520
There isn't really any horror in seeing these symbols of American hegemony destroyed in

177
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,800
the most complete and terrible way.

178
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,960
Even now, it's not framed to be an uncomfortable thing to watch.

179
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:35,360
In fact, it's kind of awesome.

180
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,040
It's still kind of awesome.

181
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,000
Here was a film where little children stare upon the smoldering ruins of the only home

182
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,400
they have ever known and say things like,

183
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,600
What happened, Mommy?

184
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,760
Here is a film in which tens of millions of people have died.

185
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,240
And this man, whose family is missing, presumed dead, responds with,

186
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
No, sir.

187
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,160
Just a little anxious to get up there and whoop E.T.'s ass, that's all.

188
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,220
The 90s was a time in which it made narrative sense for aliens to ominously show up over

189
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:06,600
major cities, and a lot of people are like, yeah, they come in peace.

190
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,520
People dancing on top of the skyscraper like, woo, it's the 90s, did you catch Seinfeld

191
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,880
last night?

192
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,080
Aliens show up ominously, and our dingbat president doesn't even evacuate the cities.

193
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,640
But it's okay, because he heroically plays a saxopho- I mean, he flies a plane, and he

194
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,000
shoots the aliens, and America saves the day.

195
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm a combat pilot, Will.

196
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,160
I belong in the air.

197
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,000
And the film was dumb in ways that aren't immediately obvious, like the sheer amount

198
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,120
of time people spend on the phone in this movie, but no one ever allows any time for

199
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,560
information to be conveyed.

200
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,560
This is the Secretary of Defense.

201
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,560
Yes.

202
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,440
Uh, Mr. President, there are aliens outside.

203
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,640
Could you say that again?

204
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,640
Aliens, sir.

205
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,200
So playing on this idea of movie monsters, and invading aliens in particular, embodying

206
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:04,120
cultural anxieties, why is the tone of the invasion narrative so different in 2005 as

207
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,200
it is from 1996?

208
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,960
Well, this is another entry into my ongoing series called

209
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:19,200
Ignoring the seriousness of the massive loss of life and the scar to the national psyche,

210
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,840
another pop culture casualty of the most destructive act of terrorism in modern history, at least

211
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,800
for a time, the disaster movie.

212
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,320
Gone were the days of goofy action movies like Independence Day and Godzilla and Wild

213
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
West.

214
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,080
No more disaster movies for these jaded masses.

215
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,360
The few stragglers that were in production before 9-11 and crept in after were released,

216
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,520
ignored, and forgotten just as quickly.

217
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,440
According to the Los Angeles Times in 2002, the public appetite for plots involving disasters

218
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,520
and terrorism has vanished.

219
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:53,160
Obviously, this did not stick, but for a while, filmmakers did not know how to approach mass

220
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,720
destruction in film, so they just didn't.

221
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,200
When big destructive action movies did eventually begin to edge their way back into theaters,

222
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,080
things were different.

223
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,720
A movie like Independence Day no longer makes sense in a post-9-11 world in which audiences

224
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,880
have actually lived through watching the destruction of familiar landmarks and mass casualties

225
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
on live television.

226
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,320
So Spielberg wants to create an invasion narrative that works in a post-9-11 world.

227
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,520
But there's a problem, see.

228
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:28,760
War of the Worlds is, in many ways, a response to, if not refutation of, Independence Day.

229
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,880
This...

230
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,800
evolves into this...

231
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,800
This...

232
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,760
evolves into this...

233
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,960
and this, my favorite subtle dig...

234
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,160
One of the biggest differences is the focus on what is being destroyed, what is at stake.

235
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,520
In Independence Day, it is landmarks, buildings, cities, etc.

236
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,920
In The War of the Worlds, there is much more focus on the loss of human life.

237
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,640
The closest thing we get to big landmark destruction is the Bayonne Bridge.

238
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:20,520
The horror comes not from mass destruction of landmarks and buildings, but from individuals.

239
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,400
We see their faces as they are zapped out of existence.

240
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,960
We see crowds as they are vaporized en masse.

241
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:30,120
Roland's extermination is one of symbols, Spielberg's, of human life.

242
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,160
The most obvious refutation of Independence Day is the tone,

243
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,840
which turns big, optimistic 90s bombast into a low-saturation death march.

244
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,960
Where, as with all of Roland's movies, the fall of civilization brings people together,

245
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,320
in War of the Worlds, the fall of civilization turns people into self-serving animals.

246
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,400
Which becomes a problem with the film in and of itself.

247
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,600
We'll get to that.

248
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,840
But at the same time, Independence Day as a film codified a lot of generic staples in shorthand,

249
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,880
which War of the Worlds certainly borrows.

250
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,440
For instance, there's this.

251
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,360
Followed then by the powering up sounds of the primary weapon.

252
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,960
And of course, there is the design of the invaders.

253
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:33,400
This is not to imply that the Independence Day aliens are the most original design ever.

254
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,800
Again, they're basically just Roswell aliens, only a little, you know, gooey-er.

255
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:44,880
In part because it's implied in Independence Day that the Roswell aliens inspired our pop-cultural ideas of what aliens look like.

256
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,240
But in War of the Worlds, there's no in-universe reason like that for them to look the way that they do,

257
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,800
only the real-world context of coming out after Independence Day,

258
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,120
and of Independence Day setting a standard.

259
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,000
So they end up looking pretty identical.

260
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,080
Only I guess these guys have mouths, so they can go, bleh.

261
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:08,000
The aliens themselves also show up a little too late in the film to be anything really unfamiliar-looking.

262
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,720
This is a balancing act in any visual medium when you have a non-human creature.

263
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,680
The more alien they look, the more time the audience has to spend getting used to them.

264
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,280
In War of the Worlds, they don't show up until Act 3,

265
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,640
so they pretty much have to look like what our preconceived idea of an alien will look like,

266
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,360
or it's just gonna be confusing.

267
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:30,440
But this comes after an hour of the sheer, unadulterated, terrifying, eldritch horror that is the tripods.

268
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,520
(*tripod whirring*)

269
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,360
You spend hours building this up, and then we get... this.

270
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,880
(*tripod whirring*)

271
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,120
A scene which is the second scene in a row,

272
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,600
which is a cut-right ripoff from the raptor scene from Jurassic Park.

273
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,240
(*tripod whirring*)

274
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,360
Now let's do this scene again, but worse.

275
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,640
(*raptor growling*)

276
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,360
I personally would rather not have seen the aliens,

277
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,120
you know, maybe have a hand at the end of the movie, but that's it.

278
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,600
But showing them at all also contradicts the greater horror slant that War of the Worlds is going for.

279
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,680
It's going for a more stylistically real invasion,

280
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,760
where Independence Day is big and cartoonish from the get-go.

281
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,160
-"Is that glass bulletproof?" -"No, sir."

282
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,760
(*raptor growling*)

283
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,240
(*explosion*)

284
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,840
So seeing these big-eyed, cute aliens feels incongruently silly.

285
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,560
It's like if Schumacher's Riddler showed up in a Chris Nolan Batman movie.

286
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,920
-"You're as blind as a bat!"

287
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,440
-"Do I look like a cop?"

288
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,400
(*gunshots*)

289
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,360
But we saw him in Independence Day, so I guess we gotta do it here, too.

290
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,920
So War of the Worlds already has this problem of existing in the shadow of Independence Day.

291
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:53,320
Now it has to walk this tightrope of that, and also existing in a post-911 hellscape.

292
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,120
Can Spielberg do it?

293
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,120
Well, honestly, the answer was yes...

294
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,320
...for the first half of the film.

295
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,200
-♪♪♪♪

296
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,000
In a time as complicated and shitty as the mid-Bush administration years...

297
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
-"Check it out!"

298
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,400
...this is not to say that the War of the Worlds aliens are really embodiments of terrorism.

299
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,800
-"Is that the terrorists?"

300
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,000
Spielberg's intent here is less to say that terrorists are literally invading aliens,

301
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
than to tap into that sense of helplessness and impotent desire for retaliation Americans felt after 9-11.

302
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,600
-"Now we'll be the ones coming up from underground."

303
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,600
...of trying to capture that feeling through genre fiction.

304
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,800
-"Oh my God!"

305
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,400
There's the misguided impulse to get back at an enemy you don't understand, or even know how to fight.

306
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,600
-"We catch up with these soldiers, hook up with whoever else is in debt, and we get back at them!

307
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
We get- we get back at them!"

308
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,000
The rage and terror that something could threaten all this power and security

309
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
that you didn't realize you never even really had.

310
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,400
And in terms of sheer imagery, there is a lot in here.

311
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:00,000
Even the very first shot of the film, we swoop in on the backdrop of the place where the World Trade Center...

312
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,400
used to be.

313
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,200
Taking it a step further...

314
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,600
-"There's all this stuff all over you."

315
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,200
Well, this image of Tom Cruise covered in grey dust is, um...

316
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,200
It's- it's loaded.

317
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,200
-"The top floors collapsed down!

318
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,000
I saw it blow, and then ran like hell, thank God!"

319
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,600
As is this scene.

320
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,400
It's not that aliens equals terrorists,

321
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,000
it's Spielberg's ultimate statement on living in an America that no longer feels secure.

322
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,600
We can't just mindlessly enjoy the cinematic destruction of a major city or landmark

323
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,800
because we had just gone through this in real life.

324
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,000
But none of these things are deal-breakers.

325
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,200
Obviously, mass destruction of cities makes their way back into the movies eventually,

326
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,200
and a dark tone in a monster movie is a totally valid creative decision.

327
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,000
With War of the Worlds, I think most people agree that it sours in the second half.

328
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,600
People like to complain about the illogic of aliens burying tripods underground,

329
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,200
or wouldn't they have known about the common cold, that sort of thing.

330
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,000
But if I can forgive that sort of thing in Independence Day, I can definitely forgive it here.

331
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,600
No, where War of the Worlds goes wrong is honestly a little simpler than that.

332
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,600
One clear example of the problem with the structure of the story is the inconsistent theming.

333
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,400
In direct contrast, I would say intentional direct contrast,

334
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,600
to Roland's optimism of disaster bringing humanity together,

335
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,400
I'm not Jewish. Nobody's perfect.

336
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,000
Here, disaster turns humans into animals.

337
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,200
Now listen, put down the gun. I'm taking the car.

338
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,600
Throughout the film, we see the increasing intensity of this theme.

339
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,600
Rey must protect his children from other humans as much as he does from the aliens.

340
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,200
And before we get to the end, he must kill another man to protect his daughter.

341
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
I can't let my daughter die because of you.

342
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,000
But then we work together when the plot needs us to.

343
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,000
Suddenly at the end of the movie, with no change in circumstance,

344
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
humans aren't barbarous animals, and suddenly it's teamwork.

345
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Everybody down!

346
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,400
So, are humans monsters or aren't they?

347
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,600
So, War of the Worlds is about this one guy's relationship to his children

348
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,000
and how that is tested by apocalyptic alien invasion.

349
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,400
This is relevant because the aliens are, at the emotional core of the film,

350
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,800
what tests the strength of the family unit.

351
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:20,800
Rey, the inadequate father, is forced for the first time in his life to take responsibility for his family.

352
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
Can he do it?

353
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,600
You're an asshole. I hate coming here.

354
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,400
It's a solid conceit and firm grounding for a screenplay.

355
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,800
And for the first half of the film, it executes this fairly well.

356
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:38,000
But, you know, it kind of looks like the screenplay didn't have an answer to that question.

357
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,400
Just look at that ending.

358
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,400
Hey, Dad.

359
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,400
And no, I don't mean how the aliens are defeated.

360
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,400
Although I'm not a stickler for faithful adaptations, that is not the problem here.

361
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,400
The resolution for the characters is the problem.

362
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,400
Unlike Roland's trademark cast of thousands,

363
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,000
War of the Worlds features a cast of four.

364
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,200
Well, I take that back.

365
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,200
You have the two A-listers, one this kid and Tim Robbins,

366
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,000
whose introduction brings the film's momentum to a screeching halt from which it never recovers.

367
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,800
This movie did not need humanity to save the day.

368
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,400
It needed a satisfactory arc for these three characters we spend the entire movie with.

369
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,000
And that, and not how the aliens are defeated, is the core of this narrative.

370
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,600
And it's kind of a hot mess.

371
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,200
For instance, Rachel.

372
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,200
Dear Rachel.

373
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,000
Hey, she said she could get it.

374
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,400
She said she could get it.

375
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,600
It's a Scott roller.

376
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,800
Mom clearly thinks she's incapable.

377
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,200
Dad says she can get it.

378
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,400
She said she could get it.

379
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,000
And it's almost like we're setting up a character arc here.

380
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Like, Rachel's gonna realize that she could indeed get it,

381
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,800
even though mom and therapists coddle her to the point of being a complete deer in the head.

382
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,400
Nope!

383
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,400
Turns out Rachel can't get the bag.

384
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,200
A realistic kid and well-rounded character in the first half,

385
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,200
she's relegated to little more than a MacGuffin in Act 2,

386
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:04,200
and basically just a doe-eyed trauma figurine in what passes for Act 3 in this movie.

387
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,200
Which is kind of a problem for the second biggest character in your movie.

388
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,000
And here's the one spot where Independence Day is the superior film.

389
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,400
Despite having the trademark Roland Emmerich cast of thousands,

390
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,600
all of the character arcs are complete, and they work.

391
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,200
They're silly, but they are complete.

392
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,200
Roland manages to give all of them a starting point and a culminating moment.

393
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,800
President Clint Moore is faced with a country beginning to doubt his adequacy.

394
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,000
They elected a warrior and they got a wimp.

395
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,600
But through a series of trial and error, including the use of nuclear weapons,

396
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600
May our children forgive us.

397
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,000
Whoopsie-daisy.

398
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
He self-actualizes by firing his Secretary of Defense,

399
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,600
and he becomes the warrior the country needed.

400
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,400
Literally.

401
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,600
Eagle One.

402
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,000
Fox Three.

403
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,400
Captain Hiller aspires to fly the Space Shuttle,

404
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,800
a privilege which he is repeatedly denied.

405
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,800
But after a series of conflicts and flying around a lot,

406
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:04,000
he arguably becomes the most qualified person on the planet to fly the alien shuttle.

407
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,800
I've been waiting for this my whole life.

408
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,400
And David starts with his father and his ex-wife berating him for being a lazy genius.

409
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,200
So tell me something. Are you so smart?

410
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,200
How come you spent eight years in MIT to become a cable repairman?

411
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,200
But in the end, not only does he rise above his inadequacy,

412
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,200
his genius literally saves the world.

413
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,200
You know how I'm like I'm always trying to save the planet?

414
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,200
Here's my chance.

415
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,600
There are three separate and distinguishable arcs here,

416
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,400
and they are all set up really well,

417
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,400
so the audience is very clear about who's accomplishing what,

418
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,800
based on whose skill set by the time Act 3 rolls around,

419
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,600
and we need to see those skills in action.

420
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,800
Hell, even the Randy Quaid subplot,

421
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,600
which seems genuinely pointless for most of the film,

422
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,400
ends up being one of the most important elements in the movie.

423
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,400
His motivation by way of his kids,

424
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,000
why he's drunk all the time.

425
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,800
Oh, yeah.

426
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,800
Seems years back our boy here was kidnapped by aliens,

427
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,400
did all kind of experiments on him and such.

428
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,600
Tell him about it, Russ.

429
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,800
His skill as a pilot.

430
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,400
All of it.

431
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,000
You know, we see it for a reason.

432
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,200
So when it culminates...

433
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,200
All right, you alien assholes!

434
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,600
Oh, yeah.

435
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,600
Sure.

436
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,200
Oh, boys!

437
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,600
I'm back!

438
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,000
Wheeee!

439
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,600
War of the Worlds, for all its masterful tension building,

440
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,000
beautiful cinematography,

441
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,200
genius sound design,

442
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,800
and pretty good first half of a screenplay,

443
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,600
does not have the same level of build-up and payoff as Independence Day.

444
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,600
If you compare the three main character arcs in Independence Day,

445
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,400
each cheesy but complete in its own little world,

446
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,200
to the one protagonist character arc in War of the Worlds,

447
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,800
what is Rey's culminating moment?

448
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,600
He is set up as an inadequate father,

449
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,200
a blue-collar kind of guy who does not know how to take care of his children,

450
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,000
and only endures his custody weekends out of obligation.

451
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,200
And when the aliens invade,

452
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,400
he is forced into a situation where he must care for his children,

453
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,600
all the while said children,

454
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,400
a teenage boy on the verge of manhood,

455
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,400
and a confused neurotic preteen,

456
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,200
are actually acting their age.

457
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,400
Rachel, shut up, Rachel!

458
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,800
I can't sleep in your house!

459
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,800
Look, I'm driving!

460
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,400
Rey does not know how to take responsibility for them,

461
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,800
but through the situation, he is forced to.

462
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,800
And the screenwriters didn't seem to know where to go with that.

463
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,400
And this is where the movie falls apart.

464
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,800
Robbie is constantly wanting to get out and break free,

465
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,200
and be a man,

466
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,800
but break free from what?

467
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,800
You only chose Boston because you hope Mom's there,

468
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,200
and if she's there, you can dump us on her!

469
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,000
Rey's not an overbearing father,

470
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,600
he doesn't even give Robbie a slap on the wrist when he steals his car.

471
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,800
Yeah, Robbie?

472
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Why, I might just smack my own hand.

473
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,800
Nor is Robbie given any motivation to find some greater calling in Act 1.

474
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,400
He doesn't lose anyone, or see the initial carnage Rey saw,

475
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,800
so this...

476
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,800
We catch up with these soldiers,

477
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,400
hook up with whoever else is in debt,

478
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,800
and we get back at them!

479
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,800
...is the idiotic, macho blathering of a teenage boy

480
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,000
who has no idea what he's talking about.

481
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,200
So by the time the movie starts to fall apart,

482
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,800
Robbie has shown no maturation.

483
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,400
And then this happens.

484
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,400
Robbie?

485
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,000
Stay together!

486
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Robbie.

487
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,600
Robbie.

488
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,200
Robbie, no.

489
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,600
Ro- Robbie, come back.

490
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,200
Robbie, no, you're gonna- you're gonna ruin the movie, Robbie.

491
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,000
Get back here!

492
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,400
What, what do you think you're gonna be the Randy Quaid of this movie?

493
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,400
This movie doesn't get a Randy Quaid, Robbie!

494
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,000
It's not 1996 anymore!

495
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,400
Please let me go. You need to let me go.

496
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,800
So now Robbie is basically out of the movie,

497
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,000
and despite idiotically running into a gigantic fireball...

498
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,800
Don't worry.

499
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,400
Everyone makes it to Grandma's house in the end.

500
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,000
He's fine.

501
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,800
It's not even that Robbie needed to die in the fireball.

502
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,800
It's that he needed a different story arc altogether.

503
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,200
If they wanted it to be,

504
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,600
Rey realizes Robbie's a man,

505
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,200
they should have built it to that.

506
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,800
Because Robbie, as Rit, is a complete dipshit.

507
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,400
Between these balls, we go back there and find one of those things and kill it.

508
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,800
Every action he takes is immature, spiteful, and wrong-headed.

509
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,600
Now let's try one that doesn't involve your ten-year-old sister joining the army!

510
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,800
The movie begins with him stealing Rey's car,

511
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,000
and he does not mature past this.

512
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,800
He never once earns the trust that Rey deigned to give him.

513
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,000
There's never a moment where Robbie and Rey learn to respect each other as men.

514
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,800
So this?

515
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,400
Please let me go. You need to let me go.

516
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,200
It's like...

517
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,200
Where the hell did that come from?

518
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,000
Let's draw a comparison to one of cinema's most famous

519
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,800
you-need-to-let-go moments.

520
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,200
When Marlin and Dory are trapped in a whale,

521
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,200
and Marlin has to make a metaphorical leap of faith...

522
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,200
He says it's time to let go!

523
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,200
Everything's gonna be alright!

524
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,800
This is a culminating moment for Marlin's character.

525
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,800
Marlin is an overprotective father.

526
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,600
He's overbearing.

527
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
He's overcompensating.

528
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,600
He's neurotic.

529
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,400
He has already endured the horrible loss of his wife,

530
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,600
which makes the loss of Nemo his greatest fear,

531
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,000
and literally the worst thing that could happen to him.

532
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,200
How do you know something bad isn't gonna happen?

533
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,800
I don't!

534
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,400
So Marlin letting go in the face of uncertainty

535
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,600
is a signifier of character growth.

536
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,200
Rey, on the other hand...

537
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,200
Meh.

538
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,200
He's a bad father.

539
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,000
He makes no room in his life for his children.

540
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,200
He is a poor caretaker,

541
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,000
and he takes no interest in their lives.

542
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,400
I'm allergic to peanut butter.

543
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,400
Since when?

544
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:18,800
Birth.

545
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,000
So what sense does it make for this to be any kind of culminating moment?

546
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,200
It's a kid who's trying to break free from a dad

547
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,000
who was never really there for him in the first place.

548
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,200
And Rey is eventually like,

549
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,200
Okay.

550
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,200
Do whatever you want.

551
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,200
Yes, I see that the movie is trying to push that it's building up,

552
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,200
that this is Robbie crossing into manhood

553
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,400
and Rey learning to respect him as a man.

554
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,600
But this does not work,

555
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,400
given how obviously wrongheaded his moves to be a man have been

556
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,600
and continue to be.

557
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,800
Please let me go.

558
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,200
You need to let me go.

559
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,200
Nope.

560
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,400
If we need balls, we go back there and find one of those things and kill it.

561
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,800
So it's at this point in the narrative that we trade in Robbie for Tim Robbins

562
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,200
and spend the next 40 minutes in a basement.

563
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,800
Tim Robbins slides into the role of Robbie in the narrative

564
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,200
as the party who wants to fight back.

565
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,600
Why did you bring us here?

566
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,000
To fight them together.

567
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,400
Against the wishes of Rey, who is just trying to not die.

568
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,200
And it is the worst thing.

569
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,800
Now we'll be the ones coming up from underground.

570
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,200
Only we have no attachment to Tim Robbins.

571
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,000
He is crazy and he's just here now.

572
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
In the movie.

573
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,400
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay...

574
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:28,000
So rather than making it a story about how Robbie and Rey reconcile these two approaches to,

575
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,200
you know, alien invasion,

576
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,800
all the while trying to keep the helpless girl child safe from the barbarousness of humanity,

577
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,000
we get Tim Robbins.

578
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,600
We're right under their feet, right?

579
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,600
Right here.

580
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,600
Under their feet.

581
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,600
So pretty much no matter what happens after Robbie leaves the narrative,

582
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,600
at least if he does consequence-free come back,

583
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,800
which is what happens,

584
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,600
it's not going to be satisfying to the audience as a story.

585
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,200
Because the payoff does not work,

586
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,200
either logically, thematically, emotionally,

587
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,200
with what was built up.

588
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,400
So this...

589
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,600
isn't the real problem.

590
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,600
This is.

591
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,200
I'm not saying it would have been better if Robbie never came back into the ne-

592
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,800
well, I mean, kind of would have.

593
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,600
It would have shown Rey that his inadequacy actually has a consequence.

594
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,600
But rather that Rey steps up and is the goddamn dad for once.

595
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,400
And then maybe later when this happens,

596
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,800
Robbie plays some integral role and helps Rey out.

597
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,800
Like, maybe Robbie is the guy who grabs onto him and pulls him back out

598
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,600
instead of this random guy we've never met.

599
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,000
And then they all three realize that,

600
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
yeah, they did need each other, something something,

601
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,800
and father-son develop a sense of, you know, something, mutual respect, whatever,

602
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,000
something that pays off the setup.

603
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,600
And it was not a bad setup,

604
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,400
but it needed to find some sense of organic resolution,

605
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,200
or your audience is gonna be pissed that they spent the last two hours with these people.

606
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,800
Which is more or less what happened.

607
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,200
The problem of invasion narratives in general

608
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,800
is that they're really difficult to resolve in ways that aren't just transparently unrealistic.

609
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,000
But moreover, especially for American-made films,

610
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,800
revenge is often a key element.

611
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,800
Get off my plane.

612
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,800
We want revenge against the invaders,

613
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,000
and War of the Worlds 05 didn't deliver.

614
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,800
It just kind of peters out,

615
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,200
as does the narrative about Rey and his family.

616
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,800
Both the invasion narrative and the character narrative

617
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:16,200
just kind of slops out at the end like a dying alien out of a tripod.

618
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,200
American audiences in 2005,

619
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,400
jacked up on war on terror propaganda

620
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,200
and seeking narratives that provide a sense of revenge,

621
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,200
were left cold by the film upon release.

622
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,800
In the 14 years since,

623
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,200
feelings have softened on it to the point that there's a sort of cultural amnesia

624
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,400
of how much people hated it at the time.

625
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,400
But that it's finally getting a more positive re-evaluation,

626
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,200
or at least a more nuanced re-evaluation,

627
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,800
is deserved in my opinion.

628
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,800
Except, of course, the resolution.

629
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,800
Part of why invasion narratives have fallen out of favor

630
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,400
is that they're really hard to resolve with a happy ending.

631
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,400
We were okay with a dumb happy ending in 1996,

632
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,400
but not in 2005,

633
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,400
and not really now either.

634
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,400
It will never be 1996 again.

635
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,800
You cannot go back to Independence Day.

636
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:03,800
If we can conceive of an other enemy that is capable of defeating us so completely,

637
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,200
it's harder to suspend disbelief that there is a way we could fight back

638
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,800
and have a happy ending.

639
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,800
Now, a completeness in an invasion narrative just doesn't feel narratively truthful

640
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,800
that humanity could survive something so devastating.

641
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
And it's not that invasion narratives are gone,

642
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,800
but nowadays they tend to be secondary to the main conflicts.

643
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,200
In movies like Avengers, Transformers, or even Man of Steel,

644
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,600
the invasion only happens in the third act,

645
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,400
and all of these movies involve super-powered beings

646
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,400
or giant anthropomorphic robots protecting the Earth,

647
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,800
not normal humans as in Independence Day or War of the Worlds.

648
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,800
Moreover, the villains in these films are not like locusts.

649
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,800
They're like locusts.

650
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,400
They're moving from planet to planet.

651
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,400
They are not intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic.

652
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:52,000
Intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic.

653
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,800
They are, in effect, despite technically being aliens, human.

654
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,200
Their motivations are clear and completely understandable to the audience.

655
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,400
Movies with more straightforward alien invasions,

656
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,400
as seen in films like Edge of Tomorrow,

657
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,000
tend to be commercial failures.

658
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,600
Now audiences want a twist,

659
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,600
and the ones you do see tend to be low-budget suspense thrillers

660
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,200
that have more in common with the horror genre and character studies

661
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,600
than action sci-fi.

662
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,400
Films like A Quiet Place and 10 Cloverfield Lane, for instance.

663
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,600
So the alien invasion motif is not gone,

664
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,600
but it's nothing like War of the Worlds or Independence Day.

665
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:28,000
As filmgoers, we aren't really interested in villains we can't understand anymore.

666
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Part of that may be because we've culturally stared down an event

667
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
that we were unprepared for and incapable of adequately resolving,

668
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
in part because comprehending it would mean facing our own societal evil.

669
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,400
So, an incomprehensible villain,

670
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,200
mass audiences just aren't really interested in that anymore.

671
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,600
And in the year of our Lord, 2019,

672
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,400
I can think of a number of reasons why that might be.

673
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,400
That's what I call a close encounter.

674
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,600
Ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a

675
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,800
Living in LA, I sure do sit in a lot of traffic,

676
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,400
so I get most of my reading done with our good friends at Audible.

677
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,200
With Audible, you get access to an unbeatable selection of audiobooks,

678
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:13,000
including bestsellers, motivation, mystery, thrillers, memoirs, and more.

679
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Audible members can choose three titles every month,

680
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,400
one audiobook, and two Audible Originals.

681
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,000
Orson Welles' original radio drama from the 1930s,

682
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,600
which I used a very small amount of in this episode, is on Audible.

683
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,200
There's a War of the Worlds musical that is an Audible Original,

684
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,000
so you get that on top of your free Audible credit.

685
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,200
How could you say no?

686
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,200
Listen on any device, anytime, anywhere,

687
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,600
and you'll also enjoy easy audiobook exchanges, rollover, credits,

688
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,600
and an audiobook library you keep forever, even if you cancel.

689
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,600
It started with a 30-day trial when you go to audible.com slash lindsayellis

690
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:52,600
or text lindsayellis to 500-500 and listen for a change.
