00:00.000 --> 00:02.960
You know who I haven't been hearing a lot about lately?

00:02.960 --> 00:04.960
Hillary Clinton.

00:04.960 --> 00:15.200
So, I for some reason felt compelled to go back through the last 25-odd years or so of pop culture Hillarys.

00:15.200 --> 00:19.200
Don't talk for one second.

00:19.200 --> 00:21.200
And go!

00:21.200 --> 00:23.200
I hate her so much!

00:23.200 --> 00:27.200
They couldn't even do it for a second!

00:27.200 --> 00:31.200
It's easy to forget for those of us who grew up in or after the Clinton era,

00:31.200 --> 00:37.200
but a lot of people saw Hillary Clinton as more threatening than Bill because of what she represented.

00:37.200 --> 00:41.200
The sprint beside the man, not behind anymore, but beside...

00:41.200 --> 00:47.200
It was unprecedented, for instance, for a first lady to identify herself as a career gal, like stuff like this.

00:47.200 --> 00:53.200
I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession...

00:53.200 --> 00:57.200
But it wasn't just that. The Clintons pitched themselves almost as like a two-for-one deal.

00:57.200 --> 01:01.200
That wasn't something dreamed up by the media, although they did focus on it.

01:01.200 --> 01:05.200
If Bill were ever incapacitated, I would assume the presidency.

01:05.200 --> 01:13.200
And full concession, a full half of this-ish, will be more or less the history of Hillary on SNL.

01:13.200 --> 01:17.200
But that in and of itself is an interesting history worthy of discussion.

01:17.200 --> 01:21.200
Go ahead, don't vote for him! I'll be fine, I have a job, I have a lawyer!

01:21.200 --> 01:26.200
Jan Hooks was the first SNL Hillary, despite having left the main cast by the time Clinton took office.

01:26.200 --> 01:31.200
She played Hillary up until Janine Garofalo took over very briefly in the mid-90s.

01:31.200 --> 01:37.200
One of the earlier sketches positions Hillary as the popular one, where Bill isn't as well liked.

01:37.200 --> 01:41.200
Could you say that Somalia and Haiti were your idea?

01:41.200 --> 01:45.200
It would really help a ton. Everyone loves you.

01:45.200 --> 01:51.200
How times change, and a James Carville, played by John Malkovich, tries to get her to run against Bill in 1996.

01:51.200 --> 01:57.200
Hillary, I'll see you in 96 minutes.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.200
Although this sketch does end with surprising sincerity.

02:00.200 --> 02:04.200
Yes, there was a time, albeit brief, where the Clintons were depicted as being in a loving marriage.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.200
I love you.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.200
And I love you.

02:08.200 --> 02:13.200
Hey, good lookin'. Wanna go check out the Lincoln bedroom?

02:13.200 --> 02:15.200
That didn't last too long.

02:15.200 --> 02:19.200
The early Clinton years was where we started to see over-ambitious, power-hungry Hillary.

02:19.200 --> 02:24.200
I happen to be the co-president of the United States of America.

02:24.200 --> 02:30.200
Difficulties with her push for healthcare reform eventually had SNL framing her as being in over her head.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.200
How's that health reform plan coming along?

02:32.200 --> 02:33.200
Well, it's difficult to-

02:33.200 --> 02:35.200
I thought so! You don't have a clue!

02:35.200 --> 02:38.200
And we even have Bob Dole putting Hillary in her place.

02:38.200 --> 02:43.200
So why don't you run along and whip up a batch of chocolate chip, boatmeal raisin, macaroons, marshmallow treats, or whatever you make,

02:43.200 --> 02:47.200
and keep your nose out of things you know nothing about?

02:47.200 --> 02:51.200
Yeah, that's what you get for pushing for universal healthcare, you harpy.

02:51.200 --> 02:54.200
Not long after that, we start to see the sort of honeymooners dynamic start to develop,

02:54.200 --> 02:57.200
with Hillary being quietly annoyed by her doofus husband.

02:57.200 --> 03:03.200
I like sex. I like hot, stinky sex, alright?

03:03.200 --> 03:07.200
But when independent from Bill, most portrayals from the early Clinton years,

03:07.200 --> 03:12.200
the ones that weren't explicitly partisan anyway, remained surprisingly respectful.

03:12.200 --> 03:16.200
Hillary Clinton has revolutionized the role of the first lady in this country.

03:16.200 --> 03:20.200
There's an episode of Step by Step where she goes to Suzanne Somers' salon to get a haircut,

03:20.200 --> 03:22.200
and everyone's like, yay, it's Hillary!

03:22.200 --> 03:25.200
That's why Mrs. Clinton wants him to do her hair.

03:25.200 --> 03:28.200
Really? That's fantastic!

03:28.200 --> 03:34.200
In an episode of Roseanne, she shows up to thank Roseanne for defeating a bunch of terrorists.

03:34.200 --> 03:40.200
It takes a village to raise a child, but just one tough cookie like you to whip a bunch of terrorists.

03:40.200 --> 03:42.200
Hot damn, this show got squirrely.

03:42.200 --> 03:48.200
Well, evidently, we've landed on a world where women are in authority and men are relegated to a second-class status.

03:48.200 --> 03:54.200
There's also an episode of Sliders where the world they slide into is a female-dominated dystopia.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.200
President Clinton?

03:56.200 --> 03:58.200
Of course I mean Clinton. Who else?

03:58.200 --> 04:00.200
I feel sorry for the press.

04:00.200 --> 04:02.200
You married to that loudmouth?

04:02.200 --> 04:08.200
I like how the guys are like, hehe, yeah, that loudmouth, and then they see they're living under the matriarchy.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.200
My fellow Americans.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.200
Yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.200
Wah, wah, wah, wah.

04:14.200 --> 04:17.200
I speak to you tonight from the White House.

04:17.200 --> 04:21.200
Wait a minute, if we're living under the matriarchy, why did she take Bill's name?

04:21.200 --> 04:23.200
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

04:23.200 --> 04:30.200
Also of note, all of the aforementioned besides SNL and many yet to be discussed portrayals are played by the same woman, Teresa Barnwell,

04:30.200 --> 04:34.200
who's been making it as a professional Hillary impersonator for 23 years and is still going at it.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.200
Pokemon, go to the polls.

04:36.200 --> 04:39.200
If you saw that Hillary's dank memes viral video.

04:39.200 --> 04:43.200
Oh, I'm sorry, are my memes too dank for you?

04:43.200 --> 04:45.200
Don't let your memes be dreams.

04:45.200 --> 04:52.200
Yep, that's her. She even has a lock on the domain HillaryClintonimpersonator.com, which has lovely site design by the way.

04:52.200 --> 04:55.200
So we can probably guess who she's rooting for in 2016.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.200
So she can keep working.

04:57.200 --> 05:03.200
Around the end of Clinton's first term, the joke starts to become that Hillary is the real power behind the throne and Bill is kind of a puppet.

05:03.200 --> 05:07.200
But the ones in charge are plain to see. The Clintons, Bill and Hillary.

05:07.200 --> 05:10.200
This one's relevant because this is the original line.

05:10.200 --> 05:13.200
But the one in charge is plain to see. It's Clinton first name Hillary.

05:13.200 --> 05:20.200
And all evidence appears to have been erased, but I swear it was Hillary alone in the chair who swivels around in the original version.

05:20.200 --> 05:24.200
And that's why there's a chair swivel, because the joke doesn't really work with Bill in the chair.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.200
It's not like a reveal. We know Bill's president.

05:26.200 --> 05:32.200
But unless some prescient, enterprising young soul taped it back in the 90s and still has the VHS,

05:32.200 --> 05:37.200
that bit with Hillary in the chair is probably lost to the sands of time.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.200
So just take my word for it.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.200
We saw this joke again in Pinky and the Brain.

05:41.200 --> 05:47.200
In one episode, Bill is entering his 377th term as president, and we are about to go to war with Canada.

05:48.200 --> 05:53.200
You think you can mess with a commander-in-chief like that? I'll show you who's boss.

05:53.200 --> 05:56.200
Uh, excuse me, Hillary. We've got a situation here.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.200
I'm on it, Bill.

05:57.200 --> 06:00.200
In another episode, they have an almost Fred and Wilma dynamic.

06:00.200 --> 06:04.200
We've got to host a conference to stop this dumbing down of America.

06:04.200 --> 06:09.200
Hillary wants to combat the increasing dumbing down of America, and Bill is...

06:09.200 --> 06:13.200
Worst of all, people actually think Pauly Shore is funny.

06:13.200 --> 06:17.200
I don't rock my world. Hey, buddy!

06:17.200 --> 06:19.200
The dumbest Rhodes Scholar.

06:19.200 --> 06:23.200
But it turns out that a Macarena parody called The Schmitzkehuwen is what's making everyone dumber.

06:23.200 --> 06:26.200
You think Pauly Shore is funny?

06:26.200 --> 06:27.200
Doesn't everyone?

06:27.200 --> 06:29.200
Buddy!

06:29.200 --> 06:32.200
Wow, these shows really had it in for Pauly Shore.

06:32.200 --> 06:36.200
She's there again in an episode of Freakazoid, acting basically as co-president.

06:37.200 --> 06:40.200
Do you come in peace or war?

06:40.200 --> 06:46.200
And she also has, like, a weird Jack Nicholson Joker face that I'm not sure is intentional, so I'm not really gonna read into that.

06:46.200 --> 06:50.200
But then came the Lewinsky era.

06:55.200 --> 06:59.200
Now all bets were off. It was open season on the Clintons.

07:04.200 --> 07:09.200
Most Hillarys of this era begin and end with being coldly annoyed with Bill,

07:09.200 --> 07:11.200
either openly...

07:11.200 --> 07:12.200
Nope!

07:12.200 --> 07:14.200
Or secretly not so secretly.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.200
Good luck, Snookums.

07:21.200 --> 07:25.200
Ana Gasteyer has taken over the role of resident Hillary on Saturday Night Live,

07:25.200 --> 07:28.200
and suddenly the Clintons really hate each other.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.200
Start yapping, you she-witch!

07:31.200 --> 07:34.200
And they mind this mutual hatred for a couple years.

07:34.200 --> 07:37.200
What are you doing here with that whoremonger?

07:40.200 --> 07:46.200
The Nanny has the Clintons pop up in a later episode, and it's surprisingly restrained considering the environment at the time.

07:46.200 --> 07:50.200
We're trying to get pregnant, but it just doesn't seem to be happening.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.200
Is there anything I can do to help?

07:52.200 --> 07:54.200
Ah, there it is.

07:54.200 --> 07:59.200
During this period, Hillary also made an appearance on the claymation MTV series Celebrity Deathmatch,

07:59.200 --> 08:03.200
which, if you don't remember, is exactly what it sounds like, where she battles Monica Lewinsky.

08:03.200 --> 08:08.200
I'm here tonight to deliver an uplifting and positive message.

08:08.200 --> 08:14.200
I'm gonna uplift this foot right here and positively kick Monica Lewinsky's big fat ass!

08:14.200 --> 08:17.200
And though Hillary ends up dealing most of the violence...

08:17.200 --> 08:21.200
I'm not sure even Hillary's healthcare plan would cover this kind of punishment.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.200
The match ends with the two of them teaming up to fight the real enemy.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.200
This is gonna get really messy.

08:26.200 --> 08:29.200
Off-screen, which is surprisingly restrained for this show.

08:29.200 --> 08:34.200
It didn't take SNL too long to expand past the hateful honeymooners thing, as that got old pretty quick.

08:34.200 --> 08:39.200
About a year after the Lewinsky scandal broke, SNL started grafting to a more sympathetic light towards the Clintons,

08:39.200 --> 08:45.200
such as one famous sketch where the Clinton clan promises not to gloat about their enemies' failure to take them down.

08:45.200 --> 08:48.200
As you can see, we're not drinking champagne.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.200
That would be gloating.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.200
We're just drinking beer.

08:52.200 --> 08:54.200
And it's not even good beer.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.200
It's Pabst Blue Ribbon.

08:56.200 --> 08:59.200
Or another where she gets a special call from Barbara Walters.

08:59.200 --> 09:02.200
Are you aware of the part about the phone sex?

09:02.200 --> 09:03.200
Oh yeah.

09:03.200 --> 09:06.200
Well, I was wondering if you'd like to try a little experiment.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.200
I'll be the man.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.200
Poor Hillary needs to get laid.

09:09.200 --> 09:14.200
Cause men can do whatever they want and everyone still likes them.

09:14.200 --> 09:16.200
Even if it is over the phone.

09:16.200 --> 09:21.200
Although they didn't ditch the honeymooners dynamic entirely, as after Hillary won the seat in the Senate, we got this sketch.

09:21.200 --> 09:27.200
I am leaving and you won't see me for two months. Don't you even want to say goodbye?

09:27.200 --> 09:28.200
Goodbye.

09:28.200 --> 09:31.200
Although this one was one of the more prescient.

09:31.200 --> 09:35.200
All I'm saying is, y'all are never gonna get tired of us.

09:35.200 --> 09:38.200
We're like the Sopranos in a pickup truck.

09:38.200 --> 09:42.200
We got scandals and crimes out there y'all don't even know about yet.

09:42.200 --> 09:46.200
During the Bush years, media mostly moved on from the humor of the Lewinsky era,

09:46.200 --> 09:50.200
with now Senator Clinton allowed to just, you know, exist as another senator.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.200
Some of the time.

09:52.200 --> 09:55.200
With the exception of that honeymooners dynamic, that still popped up on occasion.

09:55.200 --> 09:58.200
I was in meetings all day.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.200
Bill!

10:01.200 --> 10:02.200
Oh!

10:02.200 --> 10:08.200
In this 2005 episode of Robot Chicken, for instance, Monica Lewinsky jokes apparently aren't super dated.

10:08.200 --> 10:15.200
Ah, but then came the 2008 presidential primary, and with Bill no longer really relevant, shit starts getting weird again.

10:15.200 --> 10:23.200
Most notably in a 2007 episode of South Park called The Snook, in which terrorists managed to plant a nuclear bomb, well...

10:23.200 --> 10:24.200
Well, in her...

10:24.200 --> 10:26.200
In her what?

10:26.200 --> 10:28.200
In her snatch, sir.

10:28.200 --> 10:34.200
She doesn't really have a personality, per se, or an impersonation, really.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.200
Oh my!

10:36.200 --> 10:37.200
Where did that come from?

10:37.200 --> 10:39.200
Oh my!

10:39.200 --> 10:41.200
Senator Southern Belle.

10:41.200 --> 10:44.200
But she does have a big butt and a horrible man-eating vagina.

10:44.200 --> 10:46.200
Because old women are gross, am I right?

10:46.200 --> 10:51.200
She also shows up in The Simpsons movie, as if she's VP, and she seems pretty happy about it too.

10:51.200 --> 10:57.200
But despite her depictions growing more and more independent of Bill, the my doofus husband dynamic isn't completely gone.

10:57.200 --> 11:00.200
We see it again in a 2007 episode of Mind of Mencia,

11:00.200 --> 11:05.200
only this time Bill is secretly running things behind her back and using his womanizing as a front.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.200
Life is coming!

11:07.200 --> 11:10.200
Uh-uh. You can't let her know we're saving the world behind her back.

11:10.200 --> 11:13.200
So you're gonna have to get on this desk and spread them for freedom.

11:13.200 --> 11:16.200
I guess this counts as an inversion of what we saw in the 90s.

11:16.200 --> 11:21.200
But the most memorable iteration of this era was Amy Poehler's Hillary on Saturday Night Live.

11:21.200 --> 11:32.200
Someone so annoying, so pushy, so grating, so bossy and shrill, with a personality so unpleasant.

11:32.200 --> 11:36.200
Today, SNL's longest-running Hillary, and there have been quite a few.

11:36.200 --> 11:40.200
There were some sketches which were more sympathetic, even during the primary,

11:40.200 --> 11:43.200
because this was back when Obama was the new hotness to the point of parody.

11:43.200 --> 11:49.200
Like nearly everyone in the news media, the three of us are totally in the tank for Senator Obama.

11:49.200 --> 11:54.200
But the joke with Poehler's Hillary is that she's cold and conniving and will say anything to get elected.

11:54.200 --> 11:59.200
I'm not going to reverse my stance on the war a second time.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.200
Unless, of course, they want me to.

12:01.200 --> 12:04.200
And also her bottomless ambition is a joke.

12:04.200 --> 12:10.200
Is there anyone in the f***ing country who didn't know I was running for president?

12:10.200 --> 12:13.200
I've been running for president since I was five!

12:13.200 --> 12:16.200
The real deal did show up at one point after a sketch,

12:16.200 --> 12:25.200
and it was really pretty awkward because it was so obviously tacked on at the last minute after a sketch that was not terribly sympathetic to her.

12:25.200 --> 12:28.200
Because I simply adore Amy's impression of me.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.200
Oh well, my ears are ringing.

12:30.200 --> 12:34.200
Poehler's Hillary was really deeply unsympathetic during the 08 primary.

12:34.200 --> 12:39.200
I am a sore loser.

12:39.200 --> 12:42.200
But as soon as she wasn't running anymore, that changed pretty quick.

12:42.200 --> 12:49.200
We are crossing party lines to address the now very ugly role that sexism is playing in the campaign.

12:49.200 --> 12:55.200
An issue which I am frankly surprised to hear people suddenly care about.

12:55.200 --> 12:59.200
This also correlates with the trend that Hillary's approval ratings are generally pretty high.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.200
You know, as long as she's not running for office.

13:01.200 --> 13:07.200
I didn't want a woman to be president, I wanted to be president, and I just happen to be a woman.

13:07.200 --> 13:14.200
Then after that came Hillary as Secretary of State, which kind of gave rise to the trend of Hillary the angry, embittered badass.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.200
Nice to talk to you, Pearl.

13:16.200 --> 13:19.200
F*** you, Dreamstealer!

13:19.200 --> 13:21.200
Damn, some people's just too angry.

13:21.200 --> 13:29.200
Oh yeah, and Mad TV is trying to be around again, and it's still pretty bad.

13:29.200 --> 13:33.200
And Hillary, what did you say was your biggest pet peeve with Bill?

13:33.200 --> 13:38.200
Hey, 1998 called. They want you to stop stealing their even-then unfunny jokes.

13:38.200 --> 13:41.200
Vanessa Bayer took over for polar on SNL.

13:41.200 --> 13:44.200
It turns me on when you deceive the American public.

13:44.200 --> 13:48.200
Then you must be turned on 24-7!

13:48.200 --> 13:54.200
And like her character in Trainwreck, her Hillary is more awkwardly smiley than cold and conniving.

13:54.200 --> 13:57.200
Stop smiling. That's even more.

13:57.200 --> 14:04.200
But then finally, Kate McKinnon descended from her cloud of sparkles and light to take over as Hillary-in-Residence on SNL.

14:04.200 --> 14:13.200
I wasn't born yesterday. I was born 67 years ago, and I have been planning on being president ever since.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.200
A performance which would help her win an Emmy.

14:15.200 --> 14:18.200
Thank you, Ellen Degeneres. Thank you, Hillary Clinton.

14:20.200 --> 14:25.200
Unlike Polar's Hillary, McKinnon's is more... defiant.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.200
Eleven hours, baby.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.200
It couldn't break me, and they never will.

14:31.200 --> 14:37.200
She plays Hillary as less a calculating politician than a Saturday morning cartoon villain from the 80s.

14:37.200 --> 14:42.200
Citizens! You will elect me! I will be your leader!

14:42.200 --> 14:44.200
She kind of reminds me of Invader Zim.

14:44.200 --> 14:48.200
Lord of humans! I will rule you all with an iron fist!

14:48.200 --> 14:50.200
Oh, Huma.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.200
Why won't the people just let me lead?

14:53.200 --> 14:56.200
Maybe that's why she's my favorite of the SNL Hillarys.

14:56.200 --> 15:02.200
I will destroy him, and I will mount his hair in the Oval Office!

15:02.200 --> 15:06.200
Real Hillary came back again, but this time it was actually charming instead of awkward

15:06.200 --> 15:10.200
because it wasn't a tacked-on puff piece, but an actually written-out sketch.

15:10.200 --> 15:13.200
You are really easy to talk to, Val.

15:13.200 --> 15:17.200
Oh, thanks. You know, that's the first time I've ever heard that.

15:17.200 --> 15:21.200
That, albeit lovingly, dares to call her out on her record.

15:21.200 --> 15:24.200
It really is great how long you've supported gay marriage.

15:24.200 --> 15:27.200
Yes. I could have supported it sooner.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.200
Well, you did it pretty soon.

15:29.200 --> 15:31.200
Could have been sooner.

15:31.200 --> 15:35.200
Kate McKinnon, best Hillary, long may she reign.

15:35.200 --> 15:39.200
Because I've got clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right,

15:39.200 --> 15:43.200
and here you are, stuck in the middle with me!

15:45.200 --> 15:48.200
There's no consistency with Hillary's imitators.

15:48.200 --> 15:51.200
Look at someone like Bill Clinton, or George W. Bush,

15:51.200 --> 15:52.200
Strategery.

15:52.200 --> 15:55.200
or Barack Obama, or Sarah Palin.

15:55.200 --> 15:58.200
It just goes to show that anyone can be president.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.200
Anyone. Anyone.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.200
There's an attempt to capture their inflection.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.200
Not so with Hillary.

16:03.200 --> 16:08.200
Even career imitator Teresa Barnwell doesn't really capture her affect or manner of speaking.

16:08.200 --> 16:11.200
Ana Gasteyer waffled between actual impression,

16:11.200 --> 16:16.200
The new Hillary is motherly and warm.

16:16.200 --> 16:19.200
and generic angry woman, but was more often the latter.

16:19.200 --> 16:22.200
Kate McKinnon's was more of an impression at first,

16:22.200 --> 16:25.200
before it eventually evolved into the cartoon villain Hillary.

16:25.200 --> 16:29.200
But as a relatable woman on a couch, hello!

16:31.200 --> 16:34.200
In a discussion on celebrity impressions back in the 90s,

16:34.200 --> 16:37.200
Dana Carvey once said that by the end of his tenure at SNL,

16:37.200 --> 16:42.200
his George Bush impression had basically turned into an impression of the original impression.

16:43.200 --> 16:49.200
400,000 brave Americans await my order to annihilate Iraq.

16:49.200 --> 16:53.200
And you see that in the Hillarys, especially pollers and McKennons.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.200
Yes, it does, my sister friend.

16:55.200 --> 16:59.200
They aren't really impersonating a person, but an idea of a person.

16:59.200 --> 17:05.200
I invite the media to grow a pair, and if you can't, I will lend you mine.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.200
But what is that idea?

17:09.200 --> 17:11.200
Actually, you know what, don't answer that.

17:12.200 --> 17:28.200
Thanks for watching!
