0	2960	You know who I haven't been hearing a lot about lately?
2960	4960	Hillary Clinton.
4960	15200	So, I for some reason felt compelled to go back through the last 25-odd years or so of pop culture Hillarys.
15200	19200	Don't talk for one second.
19200	21200	And go!
21200	23200	I hate her so much!
23200	27200	They couldn't even do it for a second!
27200	31200	It's easy to forget for those of us who grew up in or after the Clinton era,
31200	37200	but a lot of people saw Hillary Clinton as more threatening than Bill because of what she represented.
37200	41200	The sprint beside the man, not behind anymore, but beside...
41200	47200	It was unprecedented, for instance, for a first lady to identify herself as a career gal, like stuff like this.
47200	53200	I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession...
53200	57200	But it wasn't just that. The Clintons pitched themselves almost as like a two-for-one deal.
57200	61200	That wasn't something dreamed up by the media, although they did focus on it.
61200	65200	If Bill were ever incapacitated, I would assume the presidency.
65200	73200	And full concession, a full half of this-ish, will be more or less the history of Hillary on SNL.
73200	77200	But that in and of itself is an interesting history worthy of discussion.
77200	81200	Go ahead, don't vote for him! I'll be fine, I have a job, I have a lawyer!
81200	86200	Jan Hooks was the first SNL Hillary, despite having left the main cast by the time Clinton took office.
86200	91200	She played Hillary up until Janine Garofalo took over very briefly in the mid-90s.
91200	97200	One of the earlier sketches positions Hillary as the popular one, where Bill isn't as well liked.
97200	101200	Could you say that Somalia and Haiti were your idea?
101200	105200	It would really help a ton. Everyone loves you.
105200	111200	How times change, and a James Carville, played by John Malkovich, tries to get her to run against Bill in 1996.
111200	117200	Hillary, I'll see you in 96 minutes.
117200	120200	Although this sketch does end with surprising sincerity.
120200	124200	Yes, there was a time, albeit brief, where the Clintons were depicted as being in a loving marriage.
124200	126200	I love you.
126200	128200	And I love you.
128200	133200	Hey, good lookin'. Wanna go check out the Lincoln bedroom?
133200	135200	That didn't last too long.
135200	139200	The early Clinton years was where we started to see over-ambitious, power-hungry Hillary.
139200	144200	I happen to be the co-president of the United States of America.
144200	150200	Difficulties with her push for healthcare reform eventually had SNL framing her as being in over her head.
150200	152200	How's that health reform plan coming along?
152200	153200	Well, it's difficult to-
153200	155200	I thought so! You don't have a clue!
155200	158200	And we even have Bob Dole putting Hillary in her place.
158200	163200	So why don't you run along and whip up a batch of chocolate chip, boatmeal raisin, macaroons, marshmallow treats, or whatever you make,
163200	167200	and keep your nose out of things you know nothing about?
167200	171200	Yeah, that's what you get for pushing for universal healthcare, you harpy.
171200	174200	Not long after that, we start to see the sort of honeymooners dynamic start to develop,
174200	177200	with Hillary being quietly annoyed by her doofus husband.
177200	183200	I like sex. I like hot, stinky sex, alright?
183200	187200	But when independent from Bill, most portrayals from the early Clinton years,
187200	192200	the ones that weren't explicitly partisan anyway, remained surprisingly respectful.
192200	196200	Hillary Clinton has revolutionized the role of the first lady in this country.
196200	200200	There's an episode of Step by Step where she goes to Suzanne Somers' salon to get a haircut,
200200	202200	and everyone's like, yay, it's Hillary!
202200	205200	That's why Mrs. Clinton wants him to do her hair.
205200	208200	Really? That's fantastic!
208200	214200	In an episode of Roseanne, she shows up to thank Roseanne for defeating a bunch of terrorists.
214200	220200	It takes a village to raise a child, but just one tough cookie like you to whip a bunch of terrorists.
220200	222200	Hot damn, this show got squirrely.
222200	228200	Well, evidently, we've landed on a world where women are in authority and men are relegated to a second-class status.
228200	234200	There's also an episode of Sliders where the world they slide into is a female-dominated dystopia.
234200	236200	President Clinton?
236200	238200	Of course I mean Clinton. Who else?
238200	240200	I feel sorry for the press.
240200	242200	You married to that loudmouth?
242200	248200	I like how the guys are like, hehe, yeah, that loudmouth, and then they see they're living under the matriarchy.
248200	250200	My fellow Americans.
250200	252200	Yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo.
252200	254200	Wah, wah, wah, wah.
254200	257200	I speak to you tonight from the White House.
257200	261200	Wait a minute, if we're living under the matriarchy, why did she take Bill's name?
261200	263200	Shouldn't it be the other way around?
263200	270200	Also of note, all of the aforementioned besides SNL and many yet to be discussed portrayals are played by the same woman, Teresa Barnwell,
270200	274200	who's been making it as a professional Hillary impersonator for 23 years and is still going at it.
274200	276200	Pokemon, go to the polls.
276200	279200	If you saw that Hillary's dank memes viral video.
279200	283200	Oh, I'm sorry, are my memes too dank for you?
283200	285200	Don't let your memes be dreams.
285200	292200	Yep, that's her. She even has a lock on the domain HillaryClintonimpersonator.com, which has lovely site design by the way.
292200	295200	So we can probably guess who she's rooting for in 2016.
295200	297200	So she can keep working.
297200	303200	Around the end of Clinton's first term, the joke starts to become that Hillary is the real power behind the throne and Bill is kind of a puppet.
303200	307200	But the ones in charge are plain to see. The Clintons, Bill and Hillary.
307200	310200	This one's relevant because this is the original line.
310200	313200	But the one in charge is plain to see. It's Clinton first name Hillary.
313200	320200	And all evidence appears to have been erased, but I swear it was Hillary alone in the chair who swivels around in the original version.
320200	324200	And that's why there's a chair swivel, because the joke doesn't really work with Bill in the chair.
324200	326200	It's not like a reveal. We know Bill's president.
326200	332200	But unless some prescient, enterprising young soul taped it back in the 90s and still has the VHS,
332200	337200	that bit with Hillary in the chair is probably lost to the sands of time.
337200	339200	So just take my word for it.
339200	341200	We saw this joke again in Pinky and the Brain.
341200	347200	In one episode, Bill is entering his 377th term as president, and we are about to go to war with Canada.
348200	353200	You think you can mess with a commander-in-chief like that? I'll show you who's boss.
353200	356200	Uh, excuse me, Hillary. We've got a situation here.
356200	357200	I'm on it, Bill.
357200	360200	In another episode, they have an almost Fred and Wilma dynamic.
360200	364200	We've got to host a conference to stop this dumbing down of America.
364200	369200	Hillary wants to combat the increasing dumbing down of America, and Bill is...
369200	373200	Worst of all, people actually think Pauly Shore is funny.
373200	377200	I don't rock my world. Hey, buddy!
377200	379200	The dumbest Rhodes Scholar.
379200	383200	But it turns out that a Macarena parody called The Schmitzkehuwen is what's making everyone dumber.
383200	386200	You think Pauly Shore is funny?
386200	387200	Doesn't everyone?
387200	389200	Buddy!
389200	392200	Wow, these shows really had it in for Pauly Shore.
392200	396200	She's there again in an episode of Freakazoid, acting basically as co-president.
397200	400200	Do you come in peace or war?
400200	406200	And she also has, like, a weird Jack Nicholson Joker face that I'm not sure is intentional, so I'm not really gonna read into that.
406200	410200	But then came the Lewinsky era.
415200	419200	Now all bets were off. It was open season on the Clintons.
424200	429200	Most Hillarys of this era begin and end with being coldly annoyed with Bill,
429200	431200	either openly...
431200	432200	Nope!
432200	434200	Or secretly not so secretly.
434200	436200	Good luck, Snookums.
441200	445200	Ana Gasteyer has taken over the role of resident Hillary on Saturday Night Live,
445200	448200	and suddenly the Clintons really hate each other.
448200	450200	Start yapping, you she-witch!
451200	454200	And they mind this mutual hatred for a couple years.
454200	457200	What are you doing here with that whoremonger?
460200	466200	The Nanny has the Clintons pop up in a later episode, and it's surprisingly restrained considering the environment at the time.
466200	470200	We're trying to get pregnant, but it just doesn't seem to be happening.
470200	472200	Is there anything I can do to help?
472200	474200	Ah, there it is.
474200	479200	During this period, Hillary also made an appearance on the claymation MTV series Celebrity Deathmatch,
479200	483200	which, if you don't remember, is exactly what it sounds like, where she battles Monica Lewinsky.
483200	488200	I'm here tonight to deliver an uplifting and positive message.
488200	494200	I'm gonna uplift this foot right here and positively kick Monica Lewinsky's big fat ass!
494200	497200	And though Hillary ends up dealing most of the violence...
497200	501200	I'm not sure even Hillary's healthcare plan would cover this kind of punishment.
501200	504200	The match ends with the two of them teaming up to fight the real enemy.
504200	506200	This is gonna get really messy.
506200	509200	Off-screen, which is surprisingly restrained for this show.
509200	514200	It didn't take SNL too long to expand past the hateful honeymooners thing, as that got old pretty quick.
514200	519200	About a year after the Lewinsky scandal broke, SNL started grafting to a more sympathetic light towards the Clintons,
519200	525200	such as one famous sketch where the Clinton clan promises not to gloat about their enemies' failure to take them down.
525200	528200	As you can see, we're not drinking champagne.
528200	530200	That would be gloating.
530200	532200	We're just drinking beer.
532200	534200	And it's not even good beer.
534200	536200	It's Pabst Blue Ribbon.
536200	539200	Or another where she gets a special call from Barbara Walters.
539200	542200	Are you aware of the part about the phone sex?
542200	543200	Oh yeah.
543200	546200	Well, I was wondering if you'd like to try a little experiment.
546200	547200	I'll be the man.
547200	549200	Poor Hillary needs to get laid.
549200	554200	Cause men can do whatever they want and everyone still likes them.
554200	556200	Even if it is over the phone.
556200	561200	Although they didn't ditch the honeymooners dynamic entirely, as after Hillary won the seat in the Senate, we got this sketch.
561200	567200	I am leaving and you won't see me for two months. Don't you even want to say goodbye?
567200	568200	Goodbye.
568200	571200	Although this one was one of the more prescient.
571200	575200	All I'm saying is, y'all are never gonna get tired of us.
575200	578200	We're like the Sopranos in a pickup truck.
578200	582200	We got scandals and crimes out there y'all don't even know about yet.
582200	586200	During the Bush years, media mostly moved on from the humor of the Lewinsky era,
586200	590200	with now Senator Clinton allowed to just, you know, exist as another senator.
590200	592200	Some of the time.
592200	595200	With the exception of that honeymooners dynamic, that still popped up on occasion.
595200	598200	I was in meetings all day.
598200	600200	Bill!
601200	602200	Oh!
602200	608200	In this 2005 episode of Robot Chicken, for instance, Monica Lewinsky jokes apparently aren't super dated.
608200	615200	Ah, but then came the 2008 presidential primary, and with Bill no longer really relevant, shit starts getting weird again.
615200	623200	Most notably in a 2007 episode of South Park called The Snook, in which terrorists managed to plant a nuclear bomb, well...
623200	624200	Well, in her...
624200	626200	In her what?
626200	628200	In her snatch, sir.
628200	634200	She doesn't really have a personality, per se, or an impersonation, really.
634200	636200	Oh my!
636200	637200	Where did that come from?
637200	639200	Oh my!
639200	641200	Senator Southern Belle.
641200	644200	But she does have a big butt and a horrible man-eating vagina.
644200	646200	Because old women are gross, am I right?
646200	651200	She also shows up in The Simpsons movie, as if she's VP, and she seems pretty happy about it too.
651200	657200	But despite her depictions growing more and more independent of Bill, the my doofus husband dynamic isn't completely gone.
657200	660200	We see it again in a 2007 episode of Mind of Mencia,
660200	665200	only this time Bill is secretly running things behind her back and using his womanizing as a front.
665200	667200	Life is coming!
667200	670200	Uh-uh. You can't let her know we're saving the world behind her back.
670200	673200	So you're gonna have to get on this desk and spread them for freedom.
673200	676200	I guess this counts as an inversion of what we saw in the 90s.
676200	681200	But the most memorable iteration of this era was Amy Poehler's Hillary on Saturday Night Live.
681200	692200	Someone so annoying, so pushy, so grating, so bossy and shrill, with a personality so unpleasant.
692200	696200	Today, SNL's longest-running Hillary, and there have been quite a few.
696200	700200	There were some sketches which were more sympathetic, even during the primary,
700200	703200	because this was back when Obama was the new hotness to the point of parody.
703200	709200	Like nearly everyone in the news media, the three of us are totally in the tank for Senator Obama.
709200	714200	But the joke with Poehler's Hillary is that she's cold and conniving and will say anything to get elected.
714200	719200	I'm not going to reverse my stance on the war a second time.
719200	721200	Unless, of course, they want me to.
721200	724200	And also her bottomless ambition is a joke.
724200	730200	Is there anyone in the f***ing country who didn't know I was running for president?
730200	733200	I've been running for president since I was five!
733200	736200	The real deal did show up at one point after a sketch,
736200	745200	and it was really pretty awkward because it was so obviously tacked on at the last minute after a sketch that was not terribly sympathetic to her.
745200	748200	Because I simply adore Amy's impression of me.
748200	750200	Oh well, my ears are ringing.
750200	754200	Poehler's Hillary was really deeply unsympathetic during the 08 primary.
754200	759200	I am a sore loser.
759200	762200	But as soon as she wasn't running anymore, that changed pretty quick.
762200	769200	We are crossing party lines to address the now very ugly role that sexism is playing in the campaign.
769200	775200	An issue which I am frankly surprised to hear people suddenly care about.
775200	779200	This also correlates with the trend that Hillary's approval ratings are generally pretty high.
779200	781200	You know, as long as she's not running for office.
781200	787200	I didn't want a woman to be president, I wanted to be president, and I just happen to be a woman.
787200	794200	Then after that came Hillary as Secretary of State, which kind of gave rise to the trend of Hillary the angry, embittered badass.
794200	796200	Nice to talk to you, Pearl.
796200	799200	F*** you, Dreamstealer!
799200	801200	Damn, some people's just too angry.
801200	809200	Oh yeah, and Mad TV is trying to be around again, and it's still pretty bad.
809200	813200	And Hillary, what did you say was your biggest pet peeve with Bill?
813200	818200	Hey, 1998 called. They want you to stop stealing their even-then unfunny jokes.
818200	821200	Vanessa Bayer took over for polar on SNL.
821200	824200	It turns me on when you deceive the American public.
824200	828200	Then you must be turned on 24-7!
828200	834200	And like her character in Trainwreck, her Hillary is more awkwardly smiley than cold and conniving.
834200	837200	Stop smiling. That's even more.
837200	844200	But then finally, Kate McKinnon descended from her cloud of sparkles and light to take over as Hillary-in-Residence on SNL.
844200	853200	I wasn't born yesterday. I was born 67 years ago, and I have been planning on being president ever since.
853200	855200	A performance which would help her win an Emmy.
855200	858200	Thank you, Ellen Degeneres. Thank you, Hillary Clinton.
860200	865200	Unlike Polar's Hillary, McKinnon's is more... defiant.
865200	867200	Eleven hours, baby.
868200	870200	It couldn't break me, and they never will.
871200	877200	She plays Hillary as less a calculating politician than a Saturday morning cartoon villain from the 80s.
877200	882200	Citizens! You will elect me! I will be your leader!
882200	884200	She kind of reminds me of Invader Zim.
884200	888200	Lord of humans! I will rule you all with an iron fist!
888200	890200	Oh, Huma.
891200	893200	Why won't the people just let me lead?
893200	896200	Maybe that's why she's my favorite of the SNL Hillarys.
896200	902200	I will destroy him, and I will mount his hair in the Oval Office!
902200	906200	Real Hillary came back again, but this time it was actually charming instead of awkward
906200	910200	because it wasn't a tacked-on puff piece, but an actually written-out sketch.
910200	913200	You are really easy to talk to, Val.
913200	917200	Oh, thanks. You know, that's the first time I've ever heard that.
917200	921200	That, albeit lovingly, dares to call her out on her record.
921200	924200	It really is great how long you've supported gay marriage.
924200	927200	Yes. I could have supported it sooner.
927200	929200	Well, you did it pretty soon.
929200	931200	Could have been sooner.
931200	935200	Kate McKinnon, best Hillary, long may she reign.
935200	939200	Because I've got clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right,
939200	943200	and here you are, stuck in the middle with me!
945200	948200	There's no consistency with Hillary's imitators.
948200	951200	Look at someone like Bill Clinton, or George W. Bush,
951200	952200	Strategery.
952200	955200	or Barack Obama, or Sarah Palin.
955200	958200	It just goes to show that anyone can be president.
958200	960200	Anyone. Anyone.
960200	962200	There's an attempt to capture their inflection.
962200	963200	Not so with Hillary.
963200	968200	Even career imitator Teresa Barnwell doesn't really capture her affect or manner of speaking.
968200	971200	Ana Gasteyer waffled between actual impression,
971200	976200	The new Hillary is motherly and warm.
976200	979200	and generic angry woman, but was more often the latter.
979200	982200	Kate McKinnon's was more of an impression at first,
982200	985200	before it eventually evolved into the cartoon villain Hillary.
985200	989200	But as a relatable woman on a couch, hello!
991200	994200	In a discussion on celebrity impressions back in the 90s,
994200	997200	Dana Carvey once said that by the end of his tenure at SNL,
997200	1002200	his George Bush impression had basically turned into an impression of the original impression.
