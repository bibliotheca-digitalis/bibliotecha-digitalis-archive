1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
You know who I haven't been hearing a lot about lately?

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,960
Hillary Clinton.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:15,200
So, I for some reason felt compelled to go back through the last 25-odd years or so of pop culture Hillarys.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,200
Don't talk for one second.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,200
And go!

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,200
I hate her so much!

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,200
They couldn't even do it for a second!

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,200
It's easy to forget for those of us who grew up in or after the Clinton era,

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:37,200
but a lot of people saw Hillary Clinton as more threatening than Bill because of what she represented.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,200
The sprint beside the man, not behind anymore, but beside...

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,200
It was unprecedented, for instance, for a first lady to identify herself as a career gal, like stuff like this.

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,200
I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession...

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,200
But it wasn't just that. The Clintons pitched themselves almost as like a two-for-one deal.

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,200
That wasn't something dreamed up by the media, although they did focus on it.

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,200
If Bill were ever incapacitated, I would assume the presidency.

16
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:13,200
And full concession, a full half of this-ish, will be more or less the history of Hillary on SNL.

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,200
But that in and of itself is an interesting history worthy of discussion.

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,200
Go ahead, don't vote for him! I'll be fine, I have a job, I have a lawyer!

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,200
Jan Hooks was the first SNL Hillary, despite having left the main cast by the time Clinton took office.

20
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,200
She played Hillary up until Janine Garofalo took over very briefly in the mid-90s.

21
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,200
One of the earlier sketches positions Hillary as the popular one, where Bill isn't as well liked.

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,200
Could you say that Somalia and Haiti were your idea?

23
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,200
It would really help a ton. Everyone loves you.

24
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,200
How times change, and a James Carville, played by John Malkovich, tries to get her to run against Bill in 1996.

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,200
Hillary, I'll see you in 96 minutes.

26
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,200
Although this sketch does end with surprising sincerity.

27
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Yes, there was a time, albeit brief, where the Clintons were depicted as being in a loving marriage.

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,200
I love you.

29
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,200
And I love you.

30
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,200
Hey, good lookin'. Wanna go check out the Lincoln bedroom?

31
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,200
That didn't last too long.

32
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,200
The early Clinton years was where we started to see over-ambitious, power-hungry Hillary.

33
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,200
I happen to be the co-president of the United States of America.

34
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Difficulties with her push for healthcare reform eventually had SNL framing her as being in over her head.

35
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,200
How's that health reform plan coming along?

36
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,200
Well, it's difficult to-

37
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,200
I thought so! You don't have a clue!

38
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,200
And we even have Bob Dole putting Hillary in her place.

39
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,200
So why don't you run along and whip up a batch of chocolate chip, boatmeal raisin, macaroons, marshmallow treats, or whatever you make,

40
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,200
and keep your nose out of things you know nothing about?

41
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,200
Yeah, that's what you get for pushing for universal healthcare, you harpy.

42
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Not long after that, we start to see the sort of honeymooners dynamic start to develop,

43
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,200
with Hillary being quietly annoyed by her doofus husband.

44
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,200
I like sex. I like hot, stinky sex, alright?

45
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,200
But when independent from Bill, most portrayals from the early Clinton years,

46
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,200
the ones that weren't explicitly partisan anyway, remained surprisingly respectful.

47
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,200
Hillary Clinton has revolutionized the role of the first lady in this country.

48
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,200
There's an episode of Step by Step where she goes to Suzanne Somers' salon to get a haircut,

49
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
and everyone's like, yay, it's Hillary!

50
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,200
That's why Mrs. Clinton wants him to do her hair.

51
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,200
Really? That's fantastic!

52
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,200
In an episode of Roseanne, she shows up to thank Roseanne for defeating a bunch of terrorists.

53
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:40,200
It takes a village to raise a child, but just one tough cookie like you to whip a bunch of terrorists.

54
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,200
Hot damn, this show got squirrely.

55
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:48,200
Well, evidently, we've landed on a world where women are in authority and men are relegated to a second-class status.

56
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:54,200
There's also an episode of Sliders where the world they slide into is a female-dominated dystopia.

57
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,200
President Clinton?

58
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,200
Of course I mean Clinton. Who else?

59
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
I feel sorry for the press.

60
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,200
You married to that loudmouth?

61
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:08,200
I like how the guys are like, hehe, yeah, that loudmouth, and then they see they're living under the matriarchy.

62
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,200
My fellow Americans.

63
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,200
Yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo.

64
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,200
Wah, wah, wah, wah.

65
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,200
I speak to you tonight from the White House.

66
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,200
Wait a minute, if we're living under the matriarchy, why did she take Bill's name?

67
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,200
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

68
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:30,200
Also of note, all of the aforementioned besides SNL and many yet to be discussed portrayals are played by the same woman, Teresa Barnwell,

69
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,200
who's been making it as a professional Hillary impersonator for 23 years and is still going at it.

70
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,200
Pokemon, go to the polls.

71
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,200
If you saw that Hillary's dank memes viral video.

72
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,200
Oh, I'm sorry, are my memes too dank for you?

73
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Don't let your memes be dreams.

74
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Yep, that's her. She even has a lock on the domain HillaryClintonimpersonator.com, which has lovely site design by the way.

75
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,200
So we can probably guess who she's rooting for in 2016.

76
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,200
So she can keep working.

77
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:03,200
Around the end of Clinton's first term, the joke starts to become that Hillary is the real power behind the throne and Bill is kind of a puppet.

78
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,200
But the ones in charge are plain to see. The Clintons, Bill and Hillary.

79
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,200
This one's relevant because this is the original line.

80
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,200
But the one in charge is plain to see. It's Clinton first name Hillary.

81
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:20,200
And all evidence appears to have been erased, but I swear it was Hillary alone in the chair who swivels around in the original version.

82
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,200
And that's why there's a chair swivel, because the joke doesn't really work with Bill in the chair.

83
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,200
It's not like a reveal. We know Bill's president.

84
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:32,200
But unless some prescient, enterprising young soul taped it back in the 90s and still has the VHS,

85
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,200
that bit with Hillary in the chair is probably lost to the sands of time.

86
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,200
So just take my word for it.

87
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,200
We saw this joke again in Pinky and the Brain.

88
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:47,200
In one episode, Bill is entering his 377th term as president, and we are about to go to war with Canada.

89
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,200
You think you can mess with a commander-in-chief like that? I'll show you who's boss.

90
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Uh, excuse me, Hillary. We've got a situation here.

91
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,200
I'm on it, Bill.

92
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,200
In another episode, they have an almost Fred and Wilma dynamic.

93
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,200
We've got to host a conference to stop this dumbing down of America.

94
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,200
Hillary wants to combat the increasing dumbing down of America, and Bill is...

95
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,200
Worst of all, people actually think Pauly Shore is funny.

96
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,200
I don't rock my world. Hey, buddy!

97
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
The dumbest Rhodes Scholar.

98
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,200
But it turns out that a Macarena parody called The Schmitzkehuwen is what's making everyone dumber.

99
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,200
You think Pauly Shore is funny?

100
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Doesn't everyone?

101
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Buddy!

102
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,200
Wow, these shows really had it in for Pauly Shore.

103
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,200
She's there again in an episode of Freakazoid, acting basically as co-president.

104
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,200
Do you come in peace or war?

105
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:46,200
And she also has, like, a weird Jack Nicholson Joker face that I'm not sure is intentional, so I'm not really gonna read into that.

106
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,200
But then came the Lewinsky era.

107
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,200
Now all bets were off. It was open season on the Clintons.

108
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Most Hillarys of this era begin and end with being coldly annoyed with Bill,

109
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,200
either openly...

110
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,200
Nope!

111
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Or secretly not so secretly.

112
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
Good luck, Snookums.

113
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,200
Ana Gasteyer has taken over the role of resident Hillary on Saturday Night Live,

114
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,200
and suddenly the Clintons really hate each other.

115
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Start yapping, you she-witch!

116
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,200
And they mind this mutual hatred for a couple years.

117
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,200
What are you doing here with that whoremonger?

118
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:46,200
The Nanny has the Clintons pop up in a later episode, and it's surprisingly restrained considering the environment at the time.

119
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,200
We're trying to get pregnant, but it just doesn't seem to be happening.

120
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
Is there anything I can do to help?

121
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
Ah, there it is.

122
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:59,200
During this period, Hillary also made an appearance on the claymation MTV series Celebrity Deathmatch,

123
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,200
which, if you don't remember, is exactly what it sounds like, where she battles Monica Lewinsky.

124
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,200
I'm here tonight to deliver an uplifting and positive message.

125
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:14,200
I'm gonna uplift this foot right here and positively kick Monica Lewinsky's big fat ass!

126
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,200
And though Hillary ends up dealing most of the violence...

127
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,200
I'm not sure even Hillary's healthcare plan would cover this kind of punishment.

128
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,200
The match ends with the two of them teaming up to fight the real enemy.

129
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
This is gonna get really messy.

130
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,200
Off-screen, which is surprisingly restrained for this show.

131
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,200
It didn't take SNL too long to expand past the hateful honeymooners thing, as that got old pretty quick.

132
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,200
About a year after the Lewinsky scandal broke, SNL started grafting to a more sympathetic light towards the Clintons,

133
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:45,200
such as one famous sketch where the Clinton clan promises not to gloat about their enemies' failure to take them down.

134
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,200
As you can see, we're not drinking champagne.

135
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
That would be gloating.

136
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
We're just drinking beer.

137
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,200
And it's not even good beer.

138
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
It's Pabst Blue Ribbon.

139
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Or another where she gets a special call from Barbara Walters.

140
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Are you aware of the part about the phone sex?

141
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
Oh yeah.

142
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,200
Well, I was wondering if you'd like to try a little experiment.

143
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,200
I'll be the man.

144
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Poor Hillary needs to get laid.

145
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,200
Cause men can do whatever they want and everyone still likes them.

146
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Even if it is over the phone.

147
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Although they didn't ditch the honeymooners dynamic entirely, as after Hillary won the seat in the Senate, we got this sketch.

148
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,200
I am leaving and you won't see me for two months. Don't you even want to say goodbye?

149
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
Goodbye.

150
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Although this one was one of the more prescient.

151
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,200
All I'm saying is, y'all are never gonna get tired of us.

152
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,200
We're like the Sopranos in a pickup truck.

153
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,200
We got scandals and crimes out there y'all don't even know about yet.

154
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,200
During the Bush years, media mostly moved on from the humor of the Lewinsky era,

155
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,200
with now Senator Clinton allowed to just, you know, exist as another senator.

156
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,200
Some of the time.

157
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,200
With the exception of that honeymooners dynamic, that still popped up on occasion.

158
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,200
I was in meetings all day.

159
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Bill!

160
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,200
Oh!

161
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:08,200
In this 2005 episode of Robot Chicken, for instance, Monica Lewinsky jokes apparently aren't super dated.

162
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Ah, but then came the 2008 presidential primary, and with Bill no longer really relevant, shit starts getting weird again.

163
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Most notably in a 2007 episode of South Park called The Snook, in which terrorists managed to plant a nuclear bomb, well...

164
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Well, in her...

165
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,200
In her what?

166
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,200
In her snatch, sir.

167
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:34,200
She doesn't really have a personality, per se, or an impersonation, really.

168
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Oh my!

169
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Where did that come from?

170
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
Oh my!

171
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Senator Southern Belle.

172
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,200
But she does have a big butt and a horrible man-eating vagina.

173
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,200
Because old women are gross, am I right?

174
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,200
She also shows up in The Simpsons movie, as if she's VP, and she seems pretty happy about it too.

175
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,200
But despite her depictions growing more and more independent of Bill, the my doofus husband dynamic isn't completely gone.

176
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,200
We see it again in a 2007 episode of Mind of Mencia,

177
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,200
only this time Bill is secretly running things behind her back and using his womanizing as a front.

178
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Life is coming!

179
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Uh-uh. You can't let her know we're saving the world behind her back.

180
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,200
So you're gonna have to get on this desk and spread them for freedom.

181
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,200
I guess this counts as an inversion of what we saw in the 90s.

182
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,200
But the most memorable iteration of this era was Amy Poehler's Hillary on Saturday Night Live.

183
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Someone so annoying, so pushy, so grating, so bossy and shrill, with a personality so unpleasant.

184
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,200
Today, SNL's longest-running Hillary, and there have been quite a few.

185
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,200
There were some sketches which were more sympathetic, even during the primary,

186
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,200
because this was back when Obama was the new hotness to the point of parody.

187
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,200
Like nearly everyone in the news media, the three of us are totally in the tank for Senator Obama.

188
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,200
But the joke with Poehler's Hillary is that she's cold and conniving and will say anything to get elected.

189
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,200
I'm not going to reverse my stance on the war a second time.

190
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Unless, of course, they want me to.

191
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,200
And also her bottomless ambition is a joke.

192
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:10,200
Is there anyone in the f***ing country who didn't know I was running for president?

193
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,200
I've been running for president since I was five!

194
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,200
The real deal did show up at one point after a sketch,

195
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:25,200
and it was really pretty awkward because it was so obviously tacked on at the last minute after a sketch that was not terribly sympathetic to her.

196
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,200
Because I simply adore Amy's impression of me.

197
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,200
Oh well, my ears are ringing.

198
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,200
Poehler's Hillary was really deeply unsympathetic during the 08 primary.

199
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:39,200
I am a sore loser.

200
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,200
But as soon as she wasn't running anymore, that changed pretty quick.

201
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:49,200
We are crossing party lines to address the now very ugly role that sexism is playing in the campaign.

202
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:55,200
An issue which I am frankly surprised to hear people suddenly care about.

203
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,200
This also correlates with the trend that Hillary's approval ratings are generally pretty high.

204
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
You know, as long as she's not running for office.

205
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,200
I didn't want a woman to be president, I wanted to be president, and I just happen to be a woman.

206
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:14,200
Then after that came Hillary as Secretary of State, which kind of gave rise to the trend of Hillary the angry, embittered badass.

207
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Nice to talk to you, Pearl.

208
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,200
F*** you, Dreamstealer!

209
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,200
Damn, some people's just too angry.

210
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:29,200
Oh yeah, and Mad TV is trying to be around again, and it's still pretty bad.

211
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,200
And Hillary, what did you say was your biggest pet peeve with Bill?

212
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,200
Hey, 1998 called. They want you to stop stealing their even-then unfunny jokes.

213
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Vanessa Bayer took over for polar on SNL.

214
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,200
It turns me on when you deceive the American public.

215
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Then you must be turned on 24-7!

216
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:54,200
And like her character in Trainwreck, her Hillary is more awkwardly smiley than cold and conniving.

217
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,200
Stop smiling. That's even more.

218
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:04,200
But then finally, Kate McKinnon descended from her cloud of sparkles and light to take over as Hillary-in-Residence on SNL.

219
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:13,200
I wasn't born yesterday. I was born 67 years ago, and I have been planning on being president ever since.

220
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,200
A performance which would help her win an Emmy.

221
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Thank you, Ellen Degeneres. Thank you, Hillary Clinton.

222
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,200
Unlike Polar's Hillary, McKinnon's is more... defiant.

223
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,200
Eleven hours, baby.

224
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,200
It couldn't break me, and they never will.

225
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:37,200
She plays Hillary as less a calculating politician than a Saturday morning cartoon villain from the 80s.

226
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Citizens! You will elect me! I will be your leader!

227
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,200
She kind of reminds me of Invader Zim.

228
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,200
Lord of humans! I will rule you all with an iron fist!

229
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,200
Oh, Huma.

230
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,200
Why won't the people just let me lead?

231
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,200
Maybe that's why she's my favorite of the SNL Hillarys.

232
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:02,200
I will destroy him, and I will mount his hair in the Oval Office!

233
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,200
Real Hillary came back again, but this time it was actually charming instead of awkward

234
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,200
because it wasn't a tacked-on puff piece, but an actually written-out sketch.

235
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,200
You are really easy to talk to, Val.

236
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Oh, thanks. You know, that's the first time I've ever heard that.

237
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,200
That, albeit lovingly, dares to call her out on her record.

238
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,200
It really is great how long you've supported gay marriage.

239
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,200
Yes. I could have supported it sooner.

240
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,200
Well, you did it pretty soon.

241
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,200
Could have been sooner.

242
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,200
Kate McKinnon, best Hillary, long may she reign.

243
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Because I've got clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right,

244
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,200
and here you are, stuck in the middle with me!

245
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,200
There's no consistency with Hillary's imitators.

246
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,200
Look at someone like Bill Clinton, or George W. Bush,

247
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
Strategery.

248
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,200
or Barack Obama, or Sarah Palin.

249
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,200
It just goes to show that anyone can be president.

250
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Anyone. Anyone.

251
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
There's an attempt to capture their inflection.

252
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,200
Not so with Hillary.

253
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Even career imitator Teresa Barnwell doesn't really capture her affect or manner of speaking.

254
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,200
Ana Gasteyer waffled between actual impression,

255
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:16,200
The new Hillary is motherly and warm.

256
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,200
and generic angry woman, but was more often the latter.

257
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Kate McKinnon's was more of an impression at first,

258
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,200
before it eventually evolved into the cartoon villain Hillary.

259
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,200
But as a relatable woman on a couch, hello!

260
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,200
In a discussion on celebrity impressions back in the 90s,

261
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,200
Dana Carvey once said that by the end of his tenure at SNL,

262
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,200
his George Bush impression had basically turned into an impression of the original impression.

263
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:49,200
400,000 brave Americans await my order to annihilate Iraq.

264
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,200
And you see that in the Hillarys, especially pollers and McKennons.

265
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,200
Yes, it does, my sister friend.

266
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,200
They aren't really impersonating a person, but an idea of a person.

267
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:05,200
I invite the media to grow a pair, and if you can't, I will lend you mine.

268
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
But what is that idea?

269
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,200
Actually, you know what, don't answer that.

270
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Thanks for watching!
