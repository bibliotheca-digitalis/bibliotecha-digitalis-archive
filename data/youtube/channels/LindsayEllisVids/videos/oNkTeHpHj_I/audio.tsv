0	3360	So for part two of our deep dive into gender and transformers
3840	6240	How's that for a phrase you never thought you'd say as an adult?
6360	10360	It's time to look at that most misunderstood of all film studies concepts
10960	12960	the male gaze
20320	23360	Male gaze is not just when a male character
23920	28320	Physically looks at a female character and the camera takes on the male characters point of view
28320	36120	Although that is certainly an aspect of the theory male gaze was a concept first developed by Laura Mulvey in her 1975 essay
36400	38240	visual pleasure and narrative cinema
38240	44400	It is important to note that the term originated as a film studies term and was expanded upon in the following decades in media studies
44760	50200	Communications and cultural theory in its original iteration the term male gaze relied heavily on the way
50200	54480	Cinematographers photographed women in movies and if you think Michael Bay is bad
81080	83080	The
91240	96840	Let's just say putting words to the idea of male gaze was a little more on the nose in
97480	102720	1975 than it is in today's mainstream media and it is still pretty on the nose today
102920	109960	Mulvey's idea of male gaze holds that women on film are objects for male fetishistic gazing with men as the de facto subject
109960	116440	And what about female gaze retorts the internet straw man according to Mulvey the language of film was made by male
116640	121760	filmmakers for male audiences female gaze isn't really a thing because even if say a
122240	126840	Female filmmakers tries to invert the idea of male gaze by fetishizing male bodies
126840	132840	It still uses the same language and techniques that male filmmakers used to create a degaze upon female bodies
132960	135920	Just substituting male bodies with female bodies
136000	139880	So according to the Mulvey in viewpoint Magic Mike XXL
140440	142720	Still falls under the purview of male gaze
143080	147760	Gaze has come to be defined not just by a house cinematographers shoot bodies within a frame
147880	151040	But also describes how one group season portrays another group
151080	157040	that's why it's not uncommon for for instance Joss Whedon's affinity for kick-ass fragile waifs or
157600	165000	Tarantino's use of girl fights or even Spielberg's use of beleaguered but powerless mother figures to fall under the purview of male gaze
165440	169320	But gaze does not only apply to members of one group portraying a different group
169320	173040	It can also describe how a group sees and portrays itself
173320	176920	Therefore the reason why Sam Witwicky and Cade Yeager are the way they are
177600	184600	Aggressive hostile abusive self-entitled insecure overcompensating paranoid lazy defeatist and obsessive a friend of yours. I'm not a romantic friend
185160	187160	Romantic friends do this your car
195040	198920	That is all a part of male gaze so in today's discussion
198920	204440	I am NOT going to talk about how Michael Bay's form of male gaze applies to his female characters. No, no, no
204760	207200	Today, I'm going to talk about how Michael Bay sees
207920	209840	the men's
209840	211840	Look at these two June bugs
212960	217200	There is a fascinating discussion of non-human masculinity to be had in these movies
218200	220200	It's supposed to hurt, it's an ass-kissing
220560	227720	Bumblebee oscillates between being a sapient thinking war machine and like a dog who keeps squirting his fluids on people. He doesn't like
229440	231280	Stop lubricating the man
231280	237980	There's a lot of sexual coding in the Transformers that you don't see in other Transformers media like Nokia bot has a dick cannon
238160	242480	Wheelie humps Michaela's leg and in the third movie when Michaela mysteriously disappears
242480	247060	He calls her a bitch before leering at Sam's new girl toy and of course dogs humping other dogs
247080	252700	But with regard to applying concepts like male gaze to male characters. I'm more interested in the two mains
253360	256720	protagonist of Transformers is one through three Sam Witwicky and
260200	264760	Protagonist of Transformers is four and five Cade Yeager your car
268440	271200	Like I think Michael Bay
271960	274480	Kind of hates them for what it's worth
274480	280640	I think he hates Wahlberg's character way less, but there is a staggering amount of baseless insecure aggression between the male characters
280640	283840	I'm about one second away from knocking you out taking the bomb and just leaving you here
284160	286840	You know, we got a rule about people messing with people from Texas
287920	291680	It's a freaking spaceship you go get insurance on a freaking spaceship
291680	294920	Good luck with that buddy pick any random scene in a Transformers movie
294920	300200	And if it's not like a soldier thing, it's probably two male characters being angry at each other over nothing, sir
300200	303440	Do you want to see the property? Sure. I'd be more than happy to give you a tour
303440	305240	I'll show you three other bars. I got buried up back then
305240	307480	I'll crack your head open like an egg in the fourth movie
307480	312040	The central character conflict is between Cade and his 17 year old daughter dating an older boy
314440	320800	What daddy doesn't like baby's new boyfriend one I punch you right in the mouth and you call the police on me
320800	324620	This is a pretty common character motivation for older male characters in Hollywood movies
325380	332540	Unselfconsciously hating daughter's love interest because he suspects that the boyfriend doesn't respect women because he's projecting him because he doesn't respect women and assumes
332540	337260	New boyfriend is like him and so the two are basically fighting over their object daughter lover the whole movie
340700	347140	This character arc usually ends with a dad dying so the breeding pair can go forth unfettered that doesn't happen in age of extinction
347140	352260	But the movie does add in some next-level creepy by having the boyfriend be four years the 17 year old
352420	356020	Senior and having him carry around a card with some obscure, Texas law
356020	362860	That means it's not statutory rape if I stoop your underage daughter Mark Wahlberg got a pre-existing juvenile foundation relationship
363180	365180	statute 2705-3
368820	370820	Yikes
371260	377620	But really it's all about Sam dear Sam Sam the ultimate worthless male protagonist, mr.
377980	379980	Masu-matsu
381420	386700	So worthless at the fourth movie doesn't even mention him and the fifth movie implies that he died off-screen somewhere
387740	391100	Probably slipped in the shower and choked on a bar of soap or something
391660	398700	That is how little respect Bay has for his own protagonist. That is not to say necessarily that Sam is worthy of respect
399780	402400	He is more or less defined by his own inadequacy
402400	408360	Let's go call your mom. I don't need any money for lunch. I have money from yesterday's lunch
408640	410800	Not demoralizing is they've saved the world twice
410800	414720	It's gonna be groveling for a job and inadequacy that he never really overcomes
414720	418480	They try to give him a character arc in the first movie something about
419120	424740	Sacrifice and victory and how he learns the value of sacrifice, but this doesn't make sense because Sam never
425320	430440	Sacrifices anything this is the closest any of the movies get to having a character arc for the main character by the by
430520	432240	So Sam's faults numerous though
432240	436480	They may be do not build to anything except a quiet removal and off-screen death
436560	440640	Sam is by no means unique in terms of his particular brand of character flaws
440640	445220	The last time I ate shrimp my throat closed up and I went into convulsions
446720	452880	Shrimp, but there's an important distinction be drawn between a character like Sam and a character like Star-Lord in the Guardians of the Galaxy
453080	458680	Movies who has a lot of the same character flaws as Sam does look. I'm gonna be totally honest with you. I forgot you're here
459400	464440	The key difference here is that Peter Quill's character flaws form the basis of a character arc for Star-Lord
464440	470040	his immaturity nearly gets the group killed in Guardians 2 if what's between my legs had a hand on it, I
470640	472160	Guarantee I could have landed this ship
472160	478200	His casual sexism is at least part of the reason Gamora doesn't want to settle down and his narcissism almost leads him to going along
478200	481760	With destroying the galaxy. Only you carried the connection
482560	483400	to the light
484120	488040	I don't want there to be confusion or misrepresentation of what I'm saying along the lines of oh
488040	491760	So men aren't allowed to have character flaws now either. No, that's not the point
491760	498120	But if you have a shrieking cowardly abusive overcompensating compulsive liar as your protagonist, maybe you want to I don't know
498480	500480	Do something with those character flaws?
500840	503280	Like have there be a consequence of some sort?
503520	507560	But there never is with Sam because the character flaws aren't framed as character flaws
507600	510320	There are jokey jokes to make him relatable to the audience
513960	515960	You said it first
516120	522200	In short Sam is the audience avatar. This is how Michael Bay sees you the viewer
522200	525040	Let's go call your mom and this is a part of male gaze
525520	531680	One of my friend by his money his power is good looks none of the above check Sam is shitty ineffectual and materialistic
531680	535120	But that's okay because the audience is shitty ineffectual and materialistic
535320	540560	Sam's involvement in the plot of the first two movies has no bearing on discoveries or decisions
540560	544680	He's made but objects he had in his possessions. These are my grandfather's glasses
546520	548520	Glasses
550080	555600	He inherited the glasses his dad purchases Bumblebee for him and then during the final boss battle
555800	559560	Bumblebee gives him the MacGuffin and tells him to run around with it in a circle for five minutes
559560	563720	Sam is a little more active in the third movie where he spends a lot of time trying to figure out why the
564000	569440	Decepticons are killing astronauts and Russian cosmonauts. But again, those character flaws are just kind of tacked on
569760	576600	That is the difference between a character like Star-Lord and a character like Sam Star-Lord's flaws and jokey joke lovable misogyny are meant to be
576600	580760	Relatable. Yes. Yes, I prefer to make people the old-fashioned way
580760	584760	But there is comment on these flaws in the film and there are consequences in the narrative
584800	590960	There is a reason why Sam always gets the girl despite not deserving her and Peter doesn't Sam just sucks
591160	595440	because this is how Michael Bay thinks the straight white male audience sees itself and will respond to
596120	603240	And apparently he's not wrong before we go I want to talk about one under discussed character John Turturro's Reggie
604000	606000	Seymour Simmons
608320	610120	I say slash because mr
610120	614560	Simmons had an unexplained name change between movies one and two Simmons from the get-go is
614760	621760	identified as delusional and pathetic compared to actual soldiers and actual robo soldiers getting peed on by them and
621800	624200	displaying an ignorance about both robots and
624480	630400	Warriors and the military in movie two he's back now manager of the deli of racist screeching
630400	635560	But he joins our ragtag group from the first movie and also this guy who is here for some reason
635560	639400	Don't be sucking the sack and helps organize the strike all while
639960	641960	narrating himself
642360	645480	One man alone betrayed by the country he loves now
645480	649440	It's last hope in the final hour of need like the hero of his own story
649440	653840	Then there is the third movie where he has now capitalized over his involvement with the Transformers
654840	662280	By my book spending the last half of the movie putting Francis McDormand in her place because they had sex at some point
662440	667440	You ever say a word to anyone about what happened that night in Quantico? I cut your heart out
674640	681440	Jesus Christ dude Simmons is in command posturing oblivious full of false confidence and denigrating towards most people
681440	688200	But especially women you in the training bra do not test me a little criminal girlfriend. Look at her now so much sure
689040	691840	What somebody got something for the house going on? Who are you?
695000	698520	Yet the more amoral he behaves the more fame and money he gets
701040	705760	John Turturro has gone on record several times to say that he based his performance of this character on
706160	708640	Michael Bay Simmons reflects the way base
708640	714640	He is a certain type of masculinity which then Turturro flips around to be a reflection on how he sees Michael Bay
714640	716760	This is I could do whatever I want and get away with it
716760	717200	bitch
717200	719200	Sam Cade and Simmons are all
719240	724080	Reflections of how the filmmakers see the audience and not the reason people go to the movies in the first place
724200	729880	This matters because it reinforces a very narrow view of masculinity like a male gazeception
729880	731520	This is called reflexive media
731520	736440	And there are a lot of studies that show statistically speaking that media is not great at necessarily shaping
736600	739680	Behaviors if you see robots blowing up the Lincoln Monument
739680	743600	You're not statistically more likely to go out and try to blow up the Lincoln Monument
743600	746080	But media is great at shaping worldview
746320	752120	Usually in ways that you the viewer are completely unaware of men continue to exist and emulate this narrow view of masculinity
752400	757640	Because media pushes it as normal and relatable the men in the Transformers movies are denied authenticity
757640	761880	They are the subject of ridicule and in constant desperate need to affirm their masculinity
764040	770680	There is a modicum of sincerity allowed in the first movie and sometimes in later movies and usually only in scenes with Optimus Prime
770800	774960	But for the most part sincerity and vulnerability in men is viewed with disdain
778120	782440	The only acceptable form of male authenticity is the soldier kind
782680	787640	So it is a common even cliche refrain now that Michael Bay doesn't respect women
787840	790680	But as far as representations of whole groups go
791320	793960	He doesn't have much respect for men either
812440	814440	You
