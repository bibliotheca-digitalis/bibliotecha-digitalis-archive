WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.360
So for part two of our deep dive into gender and transformers

00:03.840 --> 00:06.240
How's that for a phrase you never thought you'd say as an adult?

00:06.360 --> 00:10.360
It's time to look at that most misunderstood of all film studies concepts

00:10.960 --> 00:12.960
the male gaze

00:20.320 --> 00:23.360
Male gaze is not just when a male character

00:23.920 --> 00:28.320
Physically looks at a female character and the camera takes on the male characters point of view

00:28.320 --> 00:36.120
Although that is certainly an aspect of the theory male gaze was a concept first developed by Laura Mulvey in her 1975 essay

00:36.400 --> 00:38.240
visual pleasure and narrative cinema

00:38.240 --> 00:44.400
It is important to note that the term originated as a film studies term and was expanded upon in the following decades in media studies

00:44.760 --> 00:50.200
Communications and cultural theory in its original iteration the term male gaze relied heavily on the way

00:50.200 --> 00:54.480
Cinematographers photographed women in movies and if you think Michael Bay is bad

01:21.080 --> 01:23.080
The

01:31.240 --> 01:36.840
Let's just say putting words to the idea of male gaze was a little more on the nose in

01:37.480 --> 01:42.720
1975 than it is in today's mainstream media and it is still pretty on the nose today

01:42.920 --> 01:49.960
Mulvey's idea of male gaze holds that women on film are objects for male fetishistic gazing with men as the de facto subject

01:49.960 --> 01:56.440
And what about female gaze retorts the internet straw man according to Mulvey the language of film was made by male

01:56.640 --> 02:01.760
filmmakers for male audiences female gaze isn't really a thing because even if say a

02:02.240 --> 02:06.840
Female filmmakers tries to invert the idea of male gaze by fetishizing male bodies

02:06.840 --> 02:12.840
It still uses the same language and techniques that male filmmakers used to create a degaze upon female bodies

02:12.960 --> 02:15.920
Just substituting male bodies with female bodies

02:16.000 --> 02:19.880
So according to the Mulvey in viewpoint Magic Mike XXL

02:20.440 --> 02:22.720
Still falls under the purview of male gaze

02:23.080 --> 02:27.760
Gaze has come to be defined not just by a house cinematographers shoot bodies within a frame

02:27.880 --> 02:31.040
But also describes how one group season portrays another group

02:31.080 --> 02:37.040
that's why it's not uncommon for for instance Joss Whedon's affinity for kick-ass fragile waifs or

02:37.600 --> 02:45.000
Tarantino's use of girl fights or even Spielberg's use of beleaguered but powerless mother figures to fall under the purview of male gaze

02:45.440 --> 02:49.320
But gaze does not only apply to members of one group portraying a different group

02:49.320 --> 02:53.040
It can also describe how a group sees and portrays itself

02:53.320 --> 02:56.920
Therefore the reason why Sam Witwicky and Cade Yeager are the way they are

02:57.600 --> 03:04.600
Aggressive hostile abusive self-entitled insecure overcompensating paranoid lazy defeatist and obsessive a friend of yours. I'm not a romantic friend

03:05.160 --> 03:07.160
Romantic friends do this your car

03:15.040 --> 03:18.920
That is all a part of male gaze so in today's discussion

03:18.920 --> 03:24.440
I am NOT going to talk about how Michael Bay's form of male gaze applies to his female characters. No, no, no

03:24.760 --> 03:27.200
Today, I'm going to talk about how Michael Bay sees

03:27.920 --> 03:29.840
the men's

03:29.840 --> 03:31.840
Look at these two June bugs

03:32.960 --> 03:37.200
There is a fascinating discussion of non-human masculinity to be had in these movies

03:38.200 --> 03:40.200
It's supposed to hurt, it's an ass-kissing

03:40.560 --> 03:47.720
Bumblebee oscillates between being a sapient thinking war machine and like a dog who keeps squirting his fluids on people. He doesn't like

03:49.440 --> 03:51.280
Stop lubricating the man

03:51.280 --> 03:57.980
There's a lot of sexual coding in the Transformers that you don't see in other Transformers media like Nokia bot has a dick cannon

03:58.160 --> 04:02.480
Wheelie humps Michaela's leg and in the third movie when Michaela mysteriously disappears

04:02.480 --> 04:07.060
He calls her a bitch before leering at Sam's new girl toy and of course dogs humping other dogs

04:07.080 --> 04:12.700
But with regard to applying concepts like male gaze to male characters. I'm more interested in the two mains

04:13.360 --> 04:16.720
protagonist of Transformers is one through three Sam Witwicky and

04:20.200 --> 04:24.760
Protagonist of Transformers is four and five Cade Yeager your car

04:28.440 --> 04:31.200
Like I think Michael Bay

04:31.960 --> 04:34.480
Kind of hates them for what it's worth

04:34.480 --> 04:40.640
I think he hates Wahlberg's character way less, but there is a staggering amount of baseless insecure aggression between the male characters

04:40.640 --> 04:43.840
I'm about one second away from knocking you out taking the bomb and just leaving you here

04:44.160 --> 04:46.840
You know, we got a rule about people messing with people from Texas

04:47.920 --> 04:51.680
It's a freaking spaceship you go get insurance on a freaking spaceship

04:51.680 --> 04:54.920
Good luck with that buddy pick any random scene in a Transformers movie

04:54.920 --> 05:00.200
And if it's not like a soldier thing, it's probably two male characters being angry at each other over nothing, sir

05:00.200 --> 05:03.440
Do you want to see the property? Sure. I'd be more than happy to give you a tour

05:03.440 --> 05:05.240
I'll show you three other bars. I got buried up back then

05:05.240 --> 05:07.480
I'll crack your head open like an egg in the fourth movie

05:07.480 --> 05:12.040
The central character conflict is between Cade and his 17 year old daughter dating an older boy

05:14.440 --> 05:20.800
What daddy doesn't like baby's new boyfriend one I punch you right in the mouth and you call the police on me

05:20.800 --> 05:24.620
This is a pretty common character motivation for older male characters in Hollywood movies

05:25.380 --> 05:32.540
Unselfconsciously hating daughter's love interest because he suspects that the boyfriend doesn't respect women because he's projecting him because he doesn't respect women and assumes

05:32.540 --> 05:37.260
New boyfriend is like him and so the two are basically fighting over their object daughter lover the whole movie

05:40.700 --> 05:47.140
This character arc usually ends with a dad dying so the breeding pair can go forth unfettered that doesn't happen in age of extinction

05:47.140 --> 05:52.260
But the movie does add in some next-level creepy by having the boyfriend be four years the 17 year old

05:52.420 --> 05:56.020
Senior and having him carry around a card with some obscure, Texas law

05:56.020 --> 06:02.860
That means it's not statutory rape if I stoop your underage daughter Mark Wahlberg got a pre-existing juvenile foundation relationship

06:03.180 --> 06:05.180
statute 2705-3

06:08.820 --> 06:10.820
Yikes

06:11.260 --> 06:17.620
But really it's all about Sam dear Sam Sam the ultimate worthless male protagonist, mr.

06:17.980 --> 06:19.980
Masu-matsu

06:21.420 --> 06:26.700
So worthless at the fourth movie doesn't even mention him and the fifth movie implies that he died off-screen somewhere

06:27.740 --> 06:31.100
Probably slipped in the shower and choked on a bar of soap or something

06:31.660 --> 06:38.700
That is how little respect Bay has for his own protagonist. That is not to say necessarily that Sam is worthy of respect

06:39.780 --> 06:42.400
He is more or less defined by his own inadequacy

06:42.400 --> 06:48.360
Let's go call your mom. I don't need any money for lunch. I have money from yesterday's lunch

06:48.640 --> 06:50.800
Not demoralizing is they've saved the world twice

06:50.800 --> 06:54.720
It's gonna be groveling for a job and inadequacy that he never really overcomes

06:54.720 --> 06:58.480
They try to give him a character arc in the first movie something about

06:59.120 --> 07:04.740
Sacrifice and victory and how he learns the value of sacrifice, but this doesn't make sense because Sam never

07:05.320 --> 07:10.440
Sacrifices anything this is the closest any of the movies get to having a character arc for the main character by the by

07:10.520 --> 07:12.240
So Sam's faults numerous though

07:12.240 --> 07:16.480
They may be do not build to anything except a quiet removal and off-screen death

07:16.560 --> 07:20.640
Sam is by no means unique in terms of his particular brand of character flaws

07:20.640 --> 07:25.220
The last time I ate shrimp my throat closed up and I went into convulsions

07:26.720 --> 07:32.880
Shrimp, but there's an important distinction be drawn between a character like Sam and a character like Star-Lord in the Guardians of the Galaxy

07:33.080 --> 07:38.680
Movies who has a lot of the same character flaws as Sam does look. I'm gonna be totally honest with you. I forgot you're here

07:39.400 --> 07:44.440
The key difference here is that Peter Quill's character flaws form the basis of a character arc for Star-Lord

07:44.440 --> 07:50.040
his immaturity nearly gets the group killed in Guardians 2 if what's between my legs had a hand on it, I

07:50.640 --> 07:52.160
Guarantee I could have landed this ship

07:52.160 --> 07:58.200
His casual sexism is at least part of the reason Gamora doesn't want to settle down and his narcissism almost leads him to going along

07:58.200 --> 08:01.760
With destroying the galaxy. Only you carried the connection

08:02.560 --> 08:03.400
to the light

08:04.120 --> 08:08.040
I don't want there to be confusion or misrepresentation of what I'm saying along the lines of oh

08:08.040 --> 08:11.760
So men aren't allowed to have character flaws now either. No, that's not the point

08:11.760 --> 08:18.120
But if you have a shrieking cowardly abusive overcompensating compulsive liar as your protagonist, maybe you want to I don't know

08:18.480 --> 08:20.480
Do something with those character flaws?

08:20.840 --> 08:23.280
Like have there be a consequence of some sort?

08:23.520 --> 08:27.560
But there never is with Sam because the character flaws aren't framed as character flaws

08:27.600 --> 08:30.320
There are jokey jokes to make him relatable to the audience

08:33.960 --> 08:35.960
You said it first

08:36.120 --> 08:42.200
In short Sam is the audience avatar. This is how Michael Bay sees you the viewer

08:42.200 --> 08:45.040
Let's go call your mom and this is a part of male gaze

08:45.520 --> 08:51.680
One of my friend by his money his power is good looks none of the above check Sam is shitty ineffectual and materialistic

08:51.680 --> 08:55.120
But that's okay because the audience is shitty ineffectual and materialistic

08:55.320 --> 09:00.560
Sam's involvement in the plot of the first two movies has no bearing on discoveries or decisions

09:00.560 --> 09:04.680
He's made but objects he had in his possessions. These are my grandfather's glasses

09:06.520 --> 09:08.520
Glasses

09:10.080 --> 09:15.600
He inherited the glasses his dad purchases Bumblebee for him and then during the final boss battle

09:15.800 --> 09:19.560
Bumblebee gives him the MacGuffin and tells him to run around with it in a circle for five minutes

09:19.560 --> 09:23.720
Sam is a little more active in the third movie where he spends a lot of time trying to figure out why the

09:24.000 --> 09:29.440
Decepticons are killing astronauts and Russian cosmonauts. But again, those character flaws are just kind of tacked on

09:29.760 --> 09:36.600
That is the difference between a character like Star-Lord and a character like Sam Star-Lord's flaws and jokey joke lovable misogyny are meant to be

09:36.600 --> 09:40.760
Relatable. Yes. Yes, I prefer to make people the old-fashioned way

09:40.760 --> 09:44.760
But there is comment on these flaws in the film and there are consequences in the narrative

09:44.800 --> 09:50.960
There is a reason why Sam always gets the girl despite not deserving her and Peter doesn't Sam just sucks

09:51.160 --> 09:55.440
because this is how Michael Bay thinks the straight white male audience sees itself and will respond to

09:56.120 --> 10:03.240
And apparently he's not wrong before we go I want to talk about one under discussed character John Turturro's Reggie

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Seymour Simmons

10:08.320 --> 10:10.120
I say slash because mr

10:10.120 --> 10:14.560
Simmons had an unexplained name change between movies one and two Simmons from the get-go is

10:14.760 --> 10:21.760
identified as delusional and pathetic compared to actual soldiers and actual robo soldiers getting peed on by them and

10:21.800 --> 10:24.200
displaying an ignorance about both robots and

10:24.480 --> 10:30.400
Warriors and the military in movie two he's back now manager of the deli of racist screeching

10:30.400 --> 10:35.560
But he joins our ragtag group from the first movie and also this guy who is here for some reason

10:35.560 --> 10:39.400
Don't be sucking the sack and helps organize the strike all while

10:39.960 --> 10:41.960
narrating himself

10:42.360 --> 10:45.480
One man alone betrayed by the country he loves now

10:45.480 --> 10:49.440
It's last hope in the final hour of need like the hero of his own story

10:49.440 --> 10:53.840
Then there is the third movie where he has now capitalized over his involvement with the Transformers

10:54.840 --> 11:02.280
By my book spending the last half of the movie putting Francis McDormand in her place because they had sex at some point

11:02.440 --> 11:07.440
You ever say a word to anyone about what happened that night in Quantico? I cut your heart out

11:14.640 --> 11:21.440
Jesus Christ dude Simmons is in command posturing oblivious full of false confidence and denigrating towards most people

11:21.440 --> 11:28.200
But especially women you in the training bra do not test me a little criminal girlfriend. Look at her now so much sure

11:29.040 --> 11:31.840
What somebody got something for the house going on? Who are you?

11:35.000 --> 11:38.520
Yet the more amoral he behaves the more fame and money he gets

11:41.040 --> 11:45.760
John Turturro has gone on record several times to say that he based his performance of this character on

11:46.160 --> 11:48.640
Michael Bay Simmons reflects the way base

11:48.640 --> 11:54.640
He is a certain type of masculinity which then Turturro flips around to be a reflection on how he sees Michael Bay

11:54.640 --> 11:56.760
This is I could do whatever I want and get away with it

11:56.760 --> 11:57.200
bitch

11:57.200 --> 11:59.200
Sam Cade and Simmons are all

11:59.240 --> 12:04.080
Reflections of how the filmmakers see the audience and not the reason people go to the movies in the first place

12:04.200 --> 12:09.880
This matters because it reinforces a very narrow view of masculinity like a male gazeception

12:09.880 --> 12:11.520
This is called reflexive media

12:11.520 --> 12:16.440
And there are a lot of studies that show statistically speaking that media is not great at necessarily shaping

12:16.600 --> 12:19.680
Behaviors if you see robots blowing up the Lincoln Monument

12:19.680 --> 12:23.600
You're not statistically more likely to go out and try to blow up the Lincoln Monument

12:23.600 --> 12:26.080
But media is great at shaping worldview

12:26.320 --> 12:32.120
Usually in ways that you the viewer are completely unaware of men continue to exist and emulate this narrow view of masculinity

12:32.400 --> 12:37.640
Because media pushes it as normal and relatable the men in the Transformers movies are denied authenticity

12:37.640 --> 12:41.880
They are the subject of ridicule and in constant desperate need to affirm their masculinity

12:44.040 --> 12:50.680
There is a modicum of sincerity allowed in the first movie and sometimes in later movies and usually only in scenes with Optimus Prime

12:50.800 --> 12:54.960
But for the most part sincerity and vulnerability in men is viewed with disdain

12:58.120 --> 13:02.440
The only acceptable form of male authenticity is the soldier kind

13:02.680 --> 13:07.640
So it is a common even cliche refrain now that Michael Bay doesn't respect women

13:07.840 --> 13:10.680
But as far as representations of whole groups go

13:11.320 --> 13:13.960
He doesn't have much respect for men either

13:32.440 --> 13:34.440
You
