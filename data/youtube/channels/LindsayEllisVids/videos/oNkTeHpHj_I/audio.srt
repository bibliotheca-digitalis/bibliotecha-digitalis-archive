1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
So for part two of our deep dive into gender and transformers

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,240
How's that for a phrase you never thought you'd say as an adult?

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,360
It's time to look at that most misunderstood of all film studies concepts

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,960
the male gaze

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,360
Male gaze is not just when a male character

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,320
Physically looks at a female character and the camera takes on the male characters point of view

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:36,120
Although that is certainly an aspect of the theory male gaze was a concept first developed by Laura Mulvey in her 1975 essay

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,240
visual pleasure and narrative cinema

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:44,400
It is important to note that the term originated as a film studies term and was expanded upon in the following decades in media studies

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,200
Communications and cultural theory in its original iteration the term male gaze relied heavily on the way

11
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,480
Cinematographers photographed women in movies and if you think Michael Bay is bad

12
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,080
The

13
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,840
Let's just say putting words to the idea of male gaze was a little more on the nose in

14
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,720
1975 than it is in today's mainstream media and it is still pretty on the nose today

15
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:49,960
Mulvey's idea of male gaze holds that women on film are objects for male fetishistic gazing with men as the de facto subject

16
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:56,440
And what about female gaze retorts the internet straw man according to Mulvey the language of film was made by male

17
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,760
filmmakers for male audiences female gaze isn't really a thing because even if say a

18
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,840
Female filmmakers tries to invert the idea of male gaze by fetishizing male bodies

19
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,840
It still uses the same language and techniques that male filmmakers used to create a degaze upon female bodies

20
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,920
Just substituting male bodies with female bodies

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,880
So according to the Mulvey in viewpoint Magic Mike XXL

22
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,720
Still falls under the purview of male gaze

23
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,760
Gaze has come to be defined not just by a house cinematographers shoot bodies within a frame

24
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,040
But also describes how one group season portrays another group

25
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,040
that's why it's not uncommon for for instance Joss Whedon's affinity for kick-ass fragile waifs or

26
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:45,000
Tarantino's use of girl fights or even Spielberg's use of beleaguered but powerless mother figures to fall under the purview of male gaze

27
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,320
But gaze does not only apply to members of one group portraying a different group

28
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,040
It can also describe how a group sees and portrays itself

29
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,920
Therefore the reason why Sam Witwicky and Cade Yeager are the way they are

30
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Aggressive hostile abusive self-entitled insecure overcompensating paranoid lazy defeatist and obsessive a friend of yours. I'm not a romantic friend

31
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,160
Romantic friends do this your car

32
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,920
That is all a part of male gaze so in today's discussion

33
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,440
I am NOT going to talk about how Michael Bay's form of male gaze applies to his female characters. No, no, no

34
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,200
Today, I'm going to talk about how Michael Bay sees

35
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,840
the men's

36
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,840
Look at these two June bugs

37
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,200
There is a fascinating discussion of non-human masculinity to be had in these movies

38
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,200
It's supposed to hurt, it's an ass-kissing

39
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,720
Bumblebee oscillates between being a sapient thinking war machine and like a dog who keeps squirting his fluids on people. He doesn't like

40
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,280
Stop lubricating the man

41
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,980
There's a lot of sexual coding in the Transformers that you don't see in other Transformers media like Nokia bot has a dick cannon

42
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,480
Wheelie humps Michaela's leg and in the third movie when Michaela mysteriously disappears

43
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,060
He calls her a bitch before leering at Sam's new girl toy and of course dogs humping other dogs

44
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,700
But with regard to applying concepts like male gaze to male characters. I'm more interested in the two mains

45
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,720
protagonist of Transformers is one through three Sam Witwicky and

46
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,760
Protagonist of Transformers is four and five Cade Yeager your car

47
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,200
Like I think Michael Bay

48
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,480
Kind of hates them for what it's worth

49
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:40,640
I think he hates Wahlberg's character way less, but there is a staggering amount of baseless insecure aggression between the male characters

50
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,840
I'm about one second away from knocking you out taking the bomb and just leaving you here

51
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,840
You know, we got a rule about people messing with people from Texas

52
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,680
It's a freaking spaceship you go get insurance on a freaking spaceship

53
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,920
Good luck with that buddy pick any random scene in a Transformers movie

54
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:00,200
And if it's not like a soldier thing, it's probably two male characters being angry at each other over nothing, sir

55
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,440
Do you want to see the property? Sure. I'd be more than happy to give you a tour

56
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,240
I'll show you three other bars. I got buried up back then

57
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,480
I'll crack your head open like an egg in the fourth movie

58
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,040
The central character conflict is between Cade and his 17 year old daughter dating an older boy

59
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:20,800
What daddy doesn't like baby's new boyfriend one I punch you right in the mouth and you call the police on me

60
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,620
This is a pretty common character motivation for older male characters in Hollywood movies

61
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:32,540
Unselfconsciously hating daughter's love interest because he suspects that the boyfriend doesn't respect women because he's projecting him because he doesn't respect women and assumes

62
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:37,260
New boyfriend is like him and so the two are basically fighting over their object daughter lover the whole movie

63
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:47,140
This character arc usually ends with a dad dying so the breeding pair can go forth unfettered that doesn't happen in age of extinction

64
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:52,260
But the movie does add in some next-level creepy by having the boyfriend be four years the 17 year old

65
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,020
Senior and having him carry around a card with some obscure, Texas law

66
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:02,860
That means it's not statutory rape if I stoop your underage daughter Mark Wahlberg got a pre-existing juvenile foundation relationship

67
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,180
statute 2705-3

68
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,820
Yikes

69
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:17,620
But really it's all about Sam dear Sam Sam the ultimate worthless male protagonist, mr.

70
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,980
Masu-matsu

71
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:26,700
So worthless at the fourth movie doesn't even mention him and the fifth movie implies that he died off-screen somewhere

72
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,100
Probably slipped in the shower and choked on a bar of soap or something

73
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:38,700
That is how little respect Bay has for his own protagonist. That is not to say necessarily that Sam is worthy of respect

74
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,400
He is more or less defined by his own inadequacy

75
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,360
Let's go call your mom. I don't need any money for lunch. I have money from yesterday's lunch

76
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,800
Not demoralizing is they've saved the world twice

77
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,720
It's gonna be groveling for a job and inadequacy that he never really overcomes

78
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,480
They try to give him a character arc in the first movie something about

79
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,740
Sacrifice and victory and how he learns the value of sacrifice, but this doesn't make sense because Sam never

80
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:10,440
Sacrifices anything this is the closest any of the movies get to having a character arc for the main character by the by

81
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,240
So Sam's faults numerous though

82
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,480
They may be do not build to anything except a quiet removal and off-screen death

83
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,640
Sam is by no means unique in terms of his particular brand of character flaws

84
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,220
The last time I ate shrimp my throat closed up and I went into convulsions

85
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,880
Shrimp, but there's an important distinction be drawn between a character like Sam and a character like Star-Lord in the Guardians of the Galaxy

86
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,680
Movies who has a lot of the same character flaws as Sam does look. I'm gonna be totally honest with you. I forgot you're here

87
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,440
The key difference here is that Peter Quill's character flaws form the basis of a character arc for Star-Lord

88
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:50,040
his immaturity nearly gets the group killed in Guardians 2 if what's between my legs had a hand on it, I

89
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,160
Guarantee I could have landed this ship

90
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,200
His casual sexism is at least part of the reason Gamora doesn't want to settle down and his narcissism almost leads him to going along

91
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,760
With destroying the galaxy. Only you carried the connection

92
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,400
to the light

93
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,040
I don't want there to be confusion or misrepresentation of what I'm saying along the lines of oh

94
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,760
So men aren't allowed to have character flaws now either. No, that's not the point

95
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:18,120
But if you have a shrieking cowardly abusive overcompensating compulsive liar as your protagonist, maybe you want to I don't know

96
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,480
Do something with those character flaws?

97
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,280
Like have there be a consequence of some sort?

98
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,560
But there never is with Sam because the character flaws aren't framed as character flaws

99
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,320
There are jokey jokes to make him relatable to the audience

100
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,960
You said it first

101
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,200
In short Sam is the audience avatar. This is how Michael Bay sees you the viewer

102
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,040
Let's go call your mom and this is a part of male gaze

103
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:51,680
One of my friend by his money his power is good looks none of the above check Sam is shitty ineffectual and materialistic

104
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,120
But that's okay because the audience is shitty ineffectual and materialistic

105
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,560
Sam's involvement in the plot of the first two movies has no bearing on discoveries or decisions

106
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,680
He's made but objects he had in his possessions. These are my grandfather's glasses

107
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,520
Glasses

108
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,600
He inherited the glasses his dad purchases Bumblebee for him and then during the final boss battle

109
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,560
Bumblebee gives him the MacGuffin and tells him to run around with it in a circle for five minutes

110
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,720
Sam is a little more active in the third movie where he spends a lot of time trying to figure out why the

111
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,440
Decepticons are killing astronauts and Russian cosmonauts. But again, those character flaws are just kind of tacked on

112
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:36,600
That is the difference between a character like Star-Lord and a character like Sam Star-Lord's flaws and jokey joke lovable misogyny are meant to be

113
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,760
Relatable. Yes. Yes, I prefer to make people the old-fashioned way

114
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,760
But there is comment on these flaws in the film and there are consequences in the narrative

115
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,960
There is a reason why Sam always gets the girl despite not deserving her and Peter doesn't Sam just sucks

116
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,440
because this is how Michael Bay thinks the straight white male audience sees itself and will respond to

117
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:03,240
And apparently he's not wrong before we go I want to talk about one under discussed character John Turturro's Reggie

118
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Seymour Simmons

119
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,120
I say slash because mr

120
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,560
Simmons had an unexplained name change between movies one and two Simmons from the get-go is

121
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:21,760
identified as delusional and pathetic compared to actual soldiers and actual robo soldiers getting peed on by them and

122
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,200
displaying an ignorance about both robots and

123
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,400
Warriors and the military in movie two he's back now manager of the deli of racist screeching

124
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,560
But he joins our ragtag group from the first movie and also this guy who is here for some reason

125
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,400
Don't be sucking the sack and helps organize the strike all while

126
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,960
narrating himself

127
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,480
One man alone betrayed by the country he loves now

128
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,440
It's last hope in the final hour of need like the hero of his own story

129
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,840
Then there is the third movie where he has now capitalized over his involvement with the Transformers

130
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:02,280
By my book spending the last half of the movie putting Francis McDormand in her place because they had sex at some point

131
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,440
You ever say a word to anyone about what happened that night in Quantico? I cut your heart out

132
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:21,440
Jesus Christ dude Simmons is in command posturing oblivious full of false confidence and denigrating towards most people

133
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:28,200
But especially women you in the training bra do not test me a little criminal girlfriend. Look at her now so much sure

134
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,840
What somebody got something for the house going on? Who are you?

135
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,520
Yet the more amoral he behaves the more fame and money he gets

136
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,760
John Turturro has gone on record several times to say that he based his performance of this character on

137
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,640
Michael Bay Simmons reflects the way base

138
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,640
He is a certain type of masculinity which then Turturro flips around to be a reflection on how he sees Michael Bay

139
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,760
This is I could do whatever I want and get away with it

140
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,200
bitch

141
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
Sam Cade and Simmons are all

142
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,080
Reflections of how the filmmakers see the audience and not the reason people go to the movies in the first place

143
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,880
This matters because it reinforces a very narrow view of masculinity like a male gazeception

144
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,520
This is called reflexive media

145
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:16,440
And there are a lot of studies that show statistically speaking that media is not great at necessarily shaping

146
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,680
Behaviors if you see robots blowing up the Lincoln Monument

147
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,600
You're not statistically more likely to go out and try to blow up the Lincoln Monument

148
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,080
But media is great at shaping worldview

149
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,120
Usually in ways that you the viewer are completely unaware of men continue to exist and emulate this narrow view of masculinity

150
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,640
Because media pushes it as normal and relatable the men in the Transformers movies are denied authenticity

151
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,880
They are the subject of ridicule and in constant desperate need to affirm their masculinity

152
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:50,680
There is a modicum of sincerity allowed in the first movie and sometimes in later movies and usually only in scenes with Optimus Prime

153
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,960
But for the most part sincerity and vulnerability in men is viewed with disdain

154
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,440
The only acceptable form of male authenticity is the soldier kind
