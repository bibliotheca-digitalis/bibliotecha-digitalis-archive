0	2000	So how are you feeling, Nella?
2000	6000	I'm feeling great. I am so excited about our outline.
6000	10000	I think we're really going to nail this.
14000	19000	So this week, as evidenced by our single camera setup,
19000	22000	this is just going to be a quick little quickie update.
22000	23000	Yeah.
23000	29000	Because rather than a discussion with multicam editing,
29000	31000	On our snazzy smartphones.
31000	35000	Yeah, on our iPhones technology.
35000	41000	We're just doing a quick update to let everyone know the status of the project.
41000	43000	It's still going. We're still here.
43000	45000	We've actually started the writing phase, however.
45000	53000	We have officially hired on five people to help us write this monstrosity.
53000	59000	Once again, thank you all so much for everyone that submitted.
59000	60000	Absolutely.
60000	64000	I was going to email everyone like a professional,
64000	68000	but we're kind of overwhelmed with the amount of work we have to do
68000	70000	and the very few people we have to do it with.
70000	73000	Maybe after this project is done.
73000	74000	Yeah, after we're done.
74000	77000	It's like, yeah, I know I've been rejected.
77000	79000	I deduction that.
79000	81000	But we still appreciate you.
82000	86000	Allow me to reiterate that it wasn't necessarily the quality of writing.
86000	89000	It was the tone, and we went for a variety of scenes
89000	92000	that we thought people would be strong at.
92000	98000	So we want to thank Josh, The Mats, A and B, literally,
98000	102000	Marianne, and No Name.
102000	104000	We need to check with her to make sure.
104000	106000	Can we say her first name?
106000	111000	Yeah, for being our writers and for already being a great deal of fun.
111000	113000	I think we're having a lot of fun with this writing process.
113000	114000	Oh, yeah.
114000	115000	It's been fantastic so far.
115000	120000	And we're going to bastardize the Lovecraft missiles so much more
120000	121000	than we had originally intended.
121000	122000	Oh, man.
122000	125000	Also, we're going to bastardize New England.
125000	127000	We're going to bastardize New York City.
127000	129000	I have that chapter.
129000	132000	I can't wait to read it.
132000	135000	Everything is going to be so wrong yet so right.
135000	140000	While we're working on our fictional biography for our fictional author,
140000	146000	please send your suggestions for her name and hometown and backstory
146000	149000	and all that fun stuff totally gets in Facebook fights
149000	152000	with people who give her books negative reviews.
152000	153000	She's that lady.
153000	155000	Oh, well, then.
155000	157000	I'll keep that in mind as I'm writing.
157000	160000	Yeah, she's super insecure.
160000	163000	So this is Shakespeare.
163000	164000	Yeah.
164000	166000	This is my heart and soul.
166000	171000	So just so you guys are aware, this month is going to be pretty hectic for us.
171000	176000	The deadline for the first draft for everyone is going to be the 28th.
176000	177000	Yeah.
177000	182000	So we're hopefully going to have the first draft of it more or less done by then.
182000	183000	Yeah.
183000	185000	And we'll update next week with how we're going,
185000	190000	what our trials and tribulations are like writing an entire book in two weeks.
190000	191000	Yeah.
191000	193000	But we got eight people.
193000	194000	We got this.
194000	195000	Yeah.
195000	196000	I have a good feeling about it.
196000	197000	Easy.
197000	199000	If you can do NaNoWriMo, you can do this.
199000	202000	Although the homogenizing is going to be an interesting process.
202000	203000	So, yeah.
203000	205000	So, again, thanks for watching.
205000	207000	We'll have a real episode next week, maybe.
207000	209000	Probably not.
209000	212000	We'll see how much writing I still have to do.
212000	213000	Yeah.
213000	215000	It's a rather time-consuming process,
215000	221000	this creating an entire outline that everyone agrees with and is on board with.
221000	225000	But, yes, send us any and all suggestions at SheaApocalypse.com.
225000	227000	We are still taking the ones that we like
227000	233000	and secretly incorporating them into the outline.
233000	235000	Too many to name right now.
235000	237000	And, of course, follow us at SheaApocalypse
237000	243000	and my silly retweet Twitter, sexyalienbook,
243000	245000	which I still have not changed to SexyCthulhu.
245000	246000	I don't think I have.
246000	247000	Might as well just keep it sexyalien.
247000	248000	Yeah.
248000	250000	I mean, Cthulhu's an alien in this book.
250000	253000	Yeah, he's some kind of weird alien thing.
253000	255000	They're the aliens from the space between spaces.
255000	256000	Yeah, exactly.
256000	257000	That's right.
257000	258000	Because that's what's in now.
258000	259000	That's right.
259000	260000	We're those assholes.
260000	262000	We're making them the aliens from Indiana Jones 4.
262000	263000	Yeah.
263000	264000	That's what's in now.
264000	265000	Yeah.
265000	266000	I think.
266000	268000	Once we're ready to go with the book,
268000	270000	we'll be back with, like, real episodes
270000	274000	where we'll discuss stuff like cultural appropriation.
274000	275000	Yeah, cultural appropriation.
275000	277000	Because we've been reading Tiger Saga.
277000	278000	The Tiger Saga.
278000	280000	We've got some stuff to talk about, guys.
280000	281000	We have words.
281000	282000	Such words.
282000	283000	Such words.
283000	285000	White people.
285000	286000	Which words?
286000	289000	She could study tigers in college.
289000	292000	No, that would require her knowing things and being active.
292000	294000	But then she realizes how much she hates biology,
294000	296000	and she can't do that.
296000	298000	Girls don't do science.
298000	299000	Yeah, so anyway.
299000	300000	Next week.
300000	301000	Or not next week.
301000	302000	Eventually.
302000	304000	We'll get to fun things like cultural appropriation,
304000	306000	more gender studies.
306000	309000	We'll hopefully be able to talk to some industry people.
309000	310000	Yeah.
310000	312000	And maybe we'll go through the querying process.
312000	315000	And get to the bottom of why this shit is allowed.
315000	317000	I don't even think it's the authors anymore.
317000	318000	Why do people like?
318000	321000	No, I mean, it's too homogenous for it to be, like, everyone.
321000	322000	Yeah.
322000	323000	It's all the same.
323000	324000	It's all the same.
324000	325000	It's all the same.
325000	326000	Team Paranormal on this.
326000	329000	We need to talk to some people, maybe over drinks.
329000	330000	Yeah.
330000	331000	Like, sit them down, get them really drunk,
331000	332000	and then pick their brains.
332000	333000	Yeah, we're going to lure some publishers.
333000	334000	Make them spill their secrets.
334000	335000	Yeah.
335000	337000	Lure people with promise of alcohol,
337000	341000	and trap them in a web of whys.
341000	342000	Whys.
342000	344000	A web of whys.
344000	346000	Cheers, y'all.
346000	355000	♪♪♪
