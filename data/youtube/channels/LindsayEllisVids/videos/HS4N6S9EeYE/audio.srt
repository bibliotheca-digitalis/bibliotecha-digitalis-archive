1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So how are you feeling, Nella?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm feeling great. I am so excited about our outline.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I think we're really going to nail this.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So this week, as evidenced by our single camera setup,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
this is just going to be a quick little quickie update.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yeah.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Because rather than a discussion with multicam editing,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
On our snazzy smartphones.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yeah, on our iPhones technology.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We're just doing a quick update to let everyone know the status of the project.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's still going. We're still here.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We've actually started the writing phase, however.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We have officially hired on five people to help us write this monstrosity.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Once again, thank you all so much for everyone that submitted.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Absolutely.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I was going to email everyone like a professional,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
but we're kind of overwhelmed with the amount of work we have to do

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and the very few people we have to do it with.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Maybe after this project is done.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeah, after we're done.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's like, yeah, I know I've been rejected.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I deduction that.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But we still appreciate you.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Allow me to reiterate that it wasn't necessarily the quality of writing.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It was the tone, and we went for a variety of scenes

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
that we thought people would be strong at.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So we want to thank Josh, The Mats, A and B, literally,

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Marianne, and No Name.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We need to check with her to make sure.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Can we say her first name?

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah, for being our writers and for already being a great deal of fun.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I think we're having a lot of fun with this writing process.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Oh, yeah.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's been fantastic so far.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And we're going to bastardize the Lovecraft missiles so much more

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
than we had originally intended.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, man.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Also, we're going to bastardize New England.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We're going to bastardize New York City.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I have that chapter.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I can't wait to read it.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Everything is going to be so wrong yet so right.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
While we're working on our fictional biography for our fictional author,

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
please send your suggestions for her name and hometown and backstory

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and all that fun stuff totally gets in Facebook fights

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
with people who give her books negative reviews.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
She's that lady.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Oh, well, then.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'll keep that in mind as I'm writing.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yeah, she's super insecure.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So this is Shakespeare.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah.

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
This is my heart and soul.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So just so you guys are aware, this month is going to be pretty hectic for us.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The deadline for the first draft for everyone is going to be the 28th.

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yeah.

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So we're hopefully going to have the first draft of it more or less done by then.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah.

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And we'll update next week with how we're going,

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
what our trials and tribulations are like writing an entire book in two weeks.

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yeah.

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But we got eight people.

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We got this.

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yeah.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I have a good feeling about it.

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Easy.

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
If you can do NaNoWriMo, you can do this.

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Although the homogenizing is going to be an interesting process.

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So, yeah.

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So, again, thanks for watching.

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We'll have a real episode next week, maybe.

72
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Probably not.

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We'll see how much writing I still have to do.

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah.

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's a rather time-consuming process,

76
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
this creating an entire outline that everyone agrees with and is on board with.

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But, yes, send us any and all suggestions at SheaApocalypse.com.

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We are still taking the ones that we like

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and secretly incorporating them into the outline.

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Too many to name right now.

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And, of course, follow us at SheaApocalypse

82
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and my silly retweet Twitter, sexyalienbook,

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
which I still have not changed to SexyCthulhu.

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I don't think I have.

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Might as well just keep it sexyalien.

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah.

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I mean, Cthulhu's an alien in this book.

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah, he's some kind of weird alien thing.

89
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
They're the aliens from the space between spaces.

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah, exactly.

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That's right.

92
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Because that's what's in now.

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That's right.

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
We're those assholes.

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
We're making them the aliens from Indiana Jones 4.

96
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yeah.

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That's what's in now.

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah.

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I think.

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Once we're ready to go with the book,

101
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
we'll be back with, like, real episodes

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
where we'll discuss stuff like cultural appropriation.

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yeah, cultural appropriation.

104
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Because we've been reading Tiger Saga.

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The Tiger Saga.

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We've got some stuff to talk about, guys.

107
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We have words.

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Such words.

109
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Such words.

110
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
White people.

111
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Which words?

112
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
She could study tigers in college.

113
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No, that would require her knowing things and being active.

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But then she realizes how much she hates biology,

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and she can't do that.

116
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Girls don't do science.

117
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah, so anyway.

118
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Next week.

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Or not next week.

120
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Eventually.

121
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We'll get to fun things like cultural appropriation,

122
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
more gender studies.

123
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
We'll hopefully be able to talk to some industry people.

124
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yeah.

125
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And maybe we'll go through the querying process.

126
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And get to the bottom of why this shit is allowed.

127
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I don't even think it's the authors anymore.

128
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Why do people like?

129
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
No, I mean, it's too homogenous for it to be, like, everyone.

130
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah.

131
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's all the same.

132
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's all the same.

133
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's all the same.

134
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Team Paranormal on this.

135
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
We need to talk to some people, maybe over drinks.

136
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yeah.

137
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Like, sit them down, get them really drunk,

138
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and then pick their brains.

139
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah, we're going to lure some publishers.

140
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Make them spill their secrets.

141
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah.

142
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Lure people with promise of alcohol,

143
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
and trap them in a web of whys.

144
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Whys.

145
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
A web of whys.

146
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Cheers, y'all.
