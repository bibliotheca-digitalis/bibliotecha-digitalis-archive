WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
So how are you feeling, Nella?

00:02.000 --> 00:06.000
I'm feeling great. I am so excited about our outline.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
I think we're really going to nail this.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
So this week, as evidenced by our single camera setup,

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
this is just going to be a quick little quickie update.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
Yeah.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.000
Because rather than a discussion with multicam editing,

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
On our snazzy smartphones.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Yeah, on our iPhones technology.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
We're just doing a quick update to let everyone know the status of the project.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
It's still going. We're still here.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
We've actually started the writing phase, however.

00:45.000 --> 00:53.000
We have officially hired on five people to help us write this monstrosity.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.000
Once again, thank you all so much for everyone that submitted.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Absolutely.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
I was going to email everyone like a professional,

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
but we're kind of overwhelmed with the amount of work we have to do

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
and the very few people we have to do it with.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Maybe after this project is done.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Yeah, after we're done.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
It's like, yeah, I know I've been rejected.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
I deduction that.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
But we still appreciate you.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
Allow me to reiterate that it wasn't necessarily the quality of writing.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
It was the tone, and we went for a variety of scenes

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
that we thought people would be strong at.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
So we want to thank Josh, The Mats, A and B, literally,

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
Marianne, and No Name.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
We need to check with her to make sure.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Can we say her first name?

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
Yeah, for being our writers and for already being a great deal of fun.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
I think we're having a lot of fun with this writing process.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Oh, yeah.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
It's been fantastic so far.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
And we're going to bastardize the Lovecraft missiles so much more

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
than we had originally intended.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Oh, man.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Also, we're going to bastardize New England.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
We're going to bastardize New York City.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
I have that chapter.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
I can't wait to read it.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
Everything is going to be so wrong yet so right.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
While we're working on our fictional biography for our fictional author,

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
please send your suggestions for her name and hometown and backstory

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
and all that fun stuff totally gets in Facebook fights

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
with people who give her books negative reviews.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
She's that lady.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Oh, well, then.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
I'll keep that in mind as I'm writing.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
Yeah, she's super insecure.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
So this is Shakespeare.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Yeah.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
This is my heart and soul.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
So just so you guys are aware, this month is going to be pretty hectic for us.

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
The deadline for the first draft for everyone is going to be the 28th.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Yeah.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
So we're hopefully going to have the first draft of it more or less done by then.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Yeah.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
And we'll update next week with how we're going,

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
what our trials and tribulations are like writing an entire book in two weeks.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Yeah.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
But we got eight people.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
We got this.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Yeah.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
I have a good feeling about it.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Easy.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
If you can do NaNoWriMo, you can do this.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
Although the homogenizing is going to be an interesting process.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
So, yeah.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
So, again, thanks for watching.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
We'll have a real episode next week, maybe.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Probably not.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
We'll see how much writing I still have to do.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Yeah.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
It's a rather time-consuming process,

03:35.000 --> 03:41.000
this creating an entire outline that everyone agrees with and is on board with.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
But, yes, send us any and all suggestions at SheaApocalypse.com.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
We are still taking the ones that we like

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
and secretly incorporating them into the outline.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Too many to name right now.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
And, of course, follow us at SheaApocalypse

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
and my silly retweet Twitter, sexyalienbook,

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
which I still have not changed to SexyCthulhu.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
I don't think I have.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Might as well just keep it sexyalien.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Yeah.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I mean, Cthulhu's an alien in this book.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
Yeah, he's some kind of weird alien thing.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
They're the aliens from the space between spaces.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Yeah, exactly.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
That's right.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Because that's what's in now.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
That's right.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
We're those assholes.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
We're making them the aliens from Indiana Jones 4.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Yeah.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
That's what's in now.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Yeah.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
I think.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Once we're ready to go with the book,

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
we'll be back with, like, real episodes

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
where we'll discuss stuff like cultural appropriation.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Yeah, cultural appropriation.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Because we've been reading Tiger Saga.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
The Tiger Saga.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
We've got some stuff to talk about, guys.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
We have words.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Such words.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Such words.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
White people.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Which words?

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
She could study tigers in college.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
No, that would require her knowing things and being active.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
But then she realizes how much she hates biology,

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
and she can't do that.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Girls don't do science.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Yeah, so anyway.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Next week.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Or not next week.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Eventually.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
We'll get to fun things like cultural appropriation,

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
more gender studies.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
We'll hopefully be able to talk to some industry people.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Yeah.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
And maybe we'll go through the querying process.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
And get to the bottom of why this shit is allowed.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
I don't even think it's the authors anymore.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Why do people like?

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
No, I mean, it's too homogenous for it to be, like, everyone.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Yeah.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
It's all the same.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
It's all the same.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
It's all the same.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Team Paranormal on this.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
We need to talk to some people, maybe over drinks.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Yeah.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Like, sit them down, get them really drunk,

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
and then pick their brains.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Yeah, we're going to lure some publishers.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Make them spill their secrets.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Yeah.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Lure people with promise of alcohol,

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
and trap them in a web of whys.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Whys.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
A web of whys.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Cheers, y'all.

05:46.000 --> 05:55.000
