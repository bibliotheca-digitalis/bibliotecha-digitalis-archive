WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.440
So it's mint julep day, here at Fifty Shades of Greek.

00:07.440 --> 00:08.920
Yeah, blackberry mint julep.

00:08.920 --> 00:09.920
We're so southern.

00:09.920 --> 00:10.920
Cheers.

00:10.920 --> 00:13.600
We needed a drink after having all these.

00:13.600 --> 00:14.600
So many submissions.

00:14.600 --> 00:15.600
So many submissions.

00:15.600 --> 00:16.600
Yeah.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.880
We had over 200 submissions in less than a week.

00:19.880 --> 00:20.880
You guys gave us two.

00:20.880 --> 00:21.880
That's a lot of pictures.

00:21.880 --> 00:22.880
A lot of portfolio to go through.

00:22.880 --> 00:23.880
Yeah.

00:23.880 --> 00:28.560
And surprisingly, you know, of that 200, there was a lot of effort in that 200.

00:28.560 --> 00:29.560
Really?

00:30.560 --> 00:31.560
Yeah.

00:31.560 --> 00:32.560
Bravo to our entrants and your effort.

00:32.560 --> 00:33.560
You efforted.

00:33.560 --> 00:34.560
Yes.

00:34.560 --> 00:35.560
All the effort.

00:35.560 --> 00:40.240
We noticed a lot of repeated themes in the things we got, so we divided them into categories

00:40.240 --> 00:42.440
of ones that were similar to each other.

00:42.440 --> 00:43.520
And we're going to show you.

00:43.520 --> 00:44.760
We're going to just blow through them here.

00:44.760 --> 00:48.200
We have 20 finalists of the over 200 we received.

00:48.200 --> 00:51.760
So we're going to put their names at the bottom of the screen, sort of.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.760
And if you see one that you like, note it in the comments.

00:54.760 --> 00:57.400
Because you are helping us choose our winner.

00:57.400 --> 01:05.840
In our first category, in honor of our mint juleps of Southern origin, we have our Fitzgerald

01:05.840 --> 01:09.560
category or the eyes are watching you.

01:09.560 --> 01:14.280
The eyes that stare into your soul and say, read me precious, read me.

01:14.280 --> 01:17.080
I also like that the tentacles are not too overtly tentacly.

01:17.080 --> 01:18.720
They're a little kelp-ish.

01:18.720 --> 01:19.720
Yeah.

01:19.720 --> 01:21.840
Flower petals.

01:21.840 --> 01:29.300
This is another by the same artist, a different concept on her theme, where we have the tentacles

01:29.300 --> 01:31.200
coming around the eyes.

01:31.200 --> 01:36.880
So keeping with our eye theme, this one's kind of a combination of eye and girl going

01:36.880 --> 01:37.880
places.

01:37.880 --> 01:42.800
Well, I guess it kind of works because it really captures that whole stalkery vibe that

01:42.800 --> 01:43.800
we were going for.

01:43.800 --> 01:45.000
I think the ladies really like that.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.200
I also like that the A comes down to a little tentacle.

01:48.200 --> 01:54.520
So now we're starting into our second trend, which is girl falling.

01:54.520 --> 02:02.040
Here was a sort of dynamic image that we did enjoy, except for the slingshot-like apparatus

02:02.040 --> 02:03.040
around her.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.840
That would be something that we would ask the finalists to sort of nix, to figure out

02:05.840 --> 02:06.840
a way around it.

02:06.840 --> 02:08.720
It's like the stork just arrived.

02:08.720 --> 02:12.320
There was also two variations of this, one the tentacles coming down to sort of rescue

02:12.320 --> 02:14.840
her, one the tentacles reaching up to grab her.

02:14.840 --> 02:17.000
I think we went for the tentacles going up.

02:17.040 --> 02:19.040
Yeah, we actually kind of had a fight about this.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.000
I like the tentacles coming down.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.120
We didn't talk for like two days after that fight.

02:23.120 --> 02:26.040
I know, I had to, I felt so alone.

02:26.040 --> 02:27.360
I still have the wounds.

02:27.360 --> 02:35.480
And then next we have, this is a very fish's eye view of, you can see the tentacles coming

02:35.480 --> 02:39.320
up and she's about to fall into his squirming grasp.

02:39.320 --> 02:42.760
Yeah, she's like kind of chilling at the top of the lake or something.

02:42.760 --> 02:45.160
So then there's this guy.

02:45.160 --> 02:51.400
This one kind of fell in more with the shadowbox theme, and while I do like the kind of shadowbox

02:51.400 --> 02:54.960
and the colors, I feel like there's a lot of dead space here, which maybe this should

02:54.960 --> 02:58.880
go here or something like that.

02:58.880 --> 03:03.120
So here is another one that we felt was a very dynamic image, there seems to be a lot

03:03.120 --> 03:08.760
of motion going on, the tentacle, not tentacle, reaching out and grabbing her.

03:08.760 --> 03:12.880
Another trend we found in the entries was the mope.

03:12.880 --> 03:15.000
Yeah, which is a very apt.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.400
Yeah, no, definitely very fitting.

03:17.400 --> 03:23.280
Like for example this, which we also have the no eyes motif that I find is popular in

03:23.280 --> 03:25.080
young adult.

03:25.080 --> 03:29.600
This is actually quite beautiful and there's a graphic design detail, it's very comic book-y

03:29.600 --> 03:30.880
though too.

03:30.880 --> 03:33.920
So this example of the mope is quite lovely.

03:33.920 --> 03:42.240
I love the art and the more graphic, like woodblock print of tentacles coming out here

03:42.240 --> 03:47.160
over the very soft art is a nice contrast and you've got your moping girl, which is

03:47.160 --> 03:49.840
your classic YA cover.

03:49.840 --> 03:54.840
This artist gave us three submissions and we really, really liked all three of them

03:54.840 --> 04:00.480
and I think it's particularly the fact that it's so sketchy but you got such a good idea

04:00.480 --> 04:01.480
of what it was.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.040
I felt like this was a good idea of the mope.

04:04.040 --> 04:09.280
She's wearing her ball gown, surrounded by the tentacles, I presume she has a mopey face

04:09.280 --> 04:10.280
here.

04:10.280 --> 04:11.280
This is a bit of a mope going on.

04:11.280 --> 04:12.280
It's a little mopey.

04:12.280 --> 04:18.480
It's a little mope, but it's got really, really clean lines to it, again a very almost comic

04:18.480 --> 04:21.320
graphic design going on here.

04:21.320 --> 04:25.880
I feel like that one captures the whole, like, I am the special snowflake of destiny.

04:25.880 --> 04:30.840
The only thing we'd probably, like, with this one, it's like the really obvious but simplified

04:30.840 --> 04:34.160
like, the people in the background might be a little too on the nose.

04:34.160 --> 04:35.160
And we have another mope.

04:35.160 --> 04:40.200
This one, it's the solitary tentacle that comes down and caresses her and you can tell

04:40.200 --> 04:43.040
there's love in this caress, he's not strangling her.

04:43.040 --> 04:47.640
Here's another good mope, I like this mope, but it's also sort of like a hopeful mope

04:47.640 --> 04:51.240
because she's like, you're beautiful.

04:51.240 --> 04:56.760
This one I kind of really enjoy and here you see we have what the full book spread would

04:56.760 --> 05:00.840
look like with the background, the synopsis here, synopsis here, synopsis here, synopsis

05:00.840 --> 05:01.840
here.

05:01.840 --> 05:05.960
Cthulhu, Riley, Wagon, Fatagan, synopsis here.

05:05.960 --> 05:10.440
Obviously a drawn image, but with the eyes hidden as they are, I think it works really

05:10.440 --> 05:11.440
well.

05:11.440 --> 05:15.840
It feels, like, this I almost feel is the mope in the beautiful creatures category.

05:15.840 --> 05:20.080
Like it feels very young adult paranormal romance to me.

05:20.080 --> 05:23.920
And here's our last mope.

05:24.080 --> 05:29.760
We put this in the finalists mainly just because it was so well done and it was so mopey.

05:29.760 --> 05:35.360
I guess it doesn't have a whole lot to do with what actually happens in the book.

05:35.360 --> 05:40.680
And I really like her mopey expression and obviously the artist is very, very, very good

05:40.680 --> 05:47.760
at capturing a more realistic look, like a more photographic kind of art.

05:47.760 --> 05:48.760
We had a lot of hands.

05:48.760 --> 05:53.560
We ended up really only picking one of them as our finalists and honestly this is kind

05:53.560 --> 05:55.000
of my number one right now.

05:55.000 --> 06:01.120
Again, it's from that same artist, Ariel Johnson from earlier, that again was just like a really

06:01.120 --> 06:06.760
sketchy, sketchy mock-up, but you get such a good idea of what it is and it was just

06:06.760 --> 06:12.840
such an expressive hand and those tentacles are just, they want her and they don't know

06:12.840 --> 06:14.400
how to ask.

06:14.400 --> 06:19.400
The next trope that we did was the girl going places, which you see a lot on YA covers.

06:19.440 --> 06:25.080
So this one's very dark and moody and you can't really see it from here, but there's

06:25.080 --> 06:26.640
hints of tentacle in the background.

06:26.640 --> 06:31.120
There's actually a hint of maybe Cthulhu himself back there, but it's so subtle that I think

06:31.120 --> 06:34.680
you could actually get away with it and it's green, but it looks black.

06:34.680 --> 06:40.360
This one did the nice sort of little shadowboxy modern graphic design thing and have her little

06:40.360 --> 06:41.360
ocean thing.

06:41.360 --> 06:44.760
One problem is the fact that she's naked.

06:44.760 --> 06:45.760
Usually they wear ball gowns.

06:46.120 --> 06:51.040
Yeah, but you could draw a ball gown on her, artists, so that would be a change we'd ask

06:51.040 --> 06:52.040
for.

06:52.040 --> 06:57.840
Here's a very different style example of something that was very silhouette and very sparse,

06:57.840 --> 07:02.120
but still very much something that you'd see right now, whereas, is this a tree?

07:02.120 --> 07:03.120
Is it fire?

07:03.120 --> 07:04.120
Is it tentacles?

07:04.120 --> 07:08.000
I don't know, but it makes me want to read to find out and she sure looks like she's

07:08.000 --> 07:09.360
going somewhere.

07:09.360 --> 07:15.840
This was my favorite of the Girl Going Places one, mainly because, first off, you have the

07:15.840 --> 07:20.680
framing of the dark color and also these, they're not quite tentacles, but they are

07:20.680 --> 07:21.880
reaching into it.

07:21.880 --> 07:26.920
It looks a little El Dakari without being disgusting, like I think Sarah would think

07:26.920 --> 07:27.920
it was.

07:27.920 --> 07:32.840
We had some that don't work at all, but we still really, really love, so we're going

07:32.840 --> 07:35.720
to show them as our audible mentions.

07:35.720 --> 07:38.600
So these ones are kind of small, so I'm going to bring it kind of close.

07:38.720 --> 07:43.920
I really liked all three of them, especially the middle one with the hand reaching out

07:43.920 --> 07:45.000
and grasping a tentacle.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.960
We actually got a lot of those.

07:46.960 --> 07:52.560
For me, this one was one of my favorites that, unfortunately, it just won't work, but this

07:52.560 --> 07:57.840
is something in a cover that, man, if I was in high school and middle school, I would

07:57.840 --> 07:59.360
have picked this book up so fast.

07:59.360 --> 08:03.640
If this had happened in 1993 and Avi had written it.

08:03.640 --> 08:06.400
To me, yeah, exactly, this is very Avi.

08:06.400 --> 08:11.120
To me, this is someone creating this character based on descriptions of the book.

08:11.120 --> 08:15.000
Obviously, this one, I love that one.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.320
Nella and I, we thought this one was great.

08:18.320 --> 08:22.720
Awoken, or How I Learned to Cope with Seeing Forever.

08:22.720 --> 08:29.560
And this one was just such a perfect, of the sort of kitschy YA contemporary, the book

08:29.560 --> 08:32.720
equivalent of indie romance.

08:32.720 --> 08:33.720
It would be a quirky romance.

08:33.720 --> 08:34.720
Yeah, exactly.

08:34.720 --> 08:40.160
It felt like a sort of early John Green book kind of thing that didn't have anything to

08:40.160 --> 08:41.160
do with cancer.

08:41.160 --> 08:45.760
The problem with this one was it looked more like a sort of graphic novel cover and more

08:45.760 --> 08:50.480
like an illustration than what you would see in a traditional YA, but it was very pretty.

08:50.480 --> 08:53.520
I like how the ribbons turn into tentacles.

08:53.520 --> 08:59.400
And this one, again, a little bit too manga cover or graphic novel, but I like that it's

08:59.400 --> 09:01.200
very abstract with the swirling.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.200
Like, is that a wave or is it a tentacle?

09:03.200 --> 09:08.760
I can't tell, and it comes around and then she's drowning, but I'm not.

09:08.760 --> 09:13.560
The title fits into the curve of the wave slash tentacle.

09:13.560 --> 09:14.880
This one I really enjoyed.

09:14.880 --> 09:19.400
I did really enjoy the silhouette of the girl.

09:19.400 --> 09:24.240
Also though, what I absolutely adore of all things is the tentacles come into a heart

09:24.240 --> 09:25.240
shape in the middle.

09:25.240 --> 09:32.000
But it's like he's rising from the deep, and it's like, hey girl.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.440
Of the 200 plus we got, a little bit less than 10%.

09:37.440 --> 09:42.040
Which honestly, we're surprised that we got that many because we expended quite a bit

09:42.040 --> 09:44.800
for the writing portion because, you know.

09:44.800 --> 09:45.800
Writing's easy.

09:45.800 --> 09:50.240
Lots of the little are precious snowflake writers out there.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.280
You're all geniuses.

09:52.280 --> 09:55.840
And to pull this off in less than a week, we gave our writing samples a lot more time

09:55.840 --> 09:56.840
than that.

09:56.840 --> 09:57.840
Yeah.

09:57.840 --> 10:03.560
So what you are going to do now, what we need from you, is to tell us in the comments

10:03.560 --> 10:04.800
which artist you like best.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.640
And you saw all their names at the bottom of the video.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.840
Go back and watch again if you have to.

10:08.840 --> 10:09.840
And just leave.

10:09.840 --> 10:10.840
Yes, go back and watch again.

10:10.840 --> 10:13.200
Who watched this video like 18 times?

10:13.200 --> 10:16.140
Watch it if you must, again.

10:16.140 --> 10:17.840
Just make sure you refresh the page.

10:17.840 --> 10:18.840
A little satisfaction.

10:18.840 --> 10:19.840
Oh, of course.

10:19.840 --> 10:23.720
And the honorable mentions, though we think they're awesome, they don't count so don't

10:23.720 --> 10:24.720
vote for them.

10:24.720 --> 10:26.960
The Little Miss Sunshine one is not going to happen.

10:27.080 --> 10:28.080
I'm sorry.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.080
I love it.

10:29.080 --> 10:34.280
I think it could happen in like an ultra special edition, maybe one day if we go to a con.

10:34.280 --> 10:36.560
She's just like, he's my first boyfriend.

10:36.560 --> 10:37.560
I know.

10:37.560 --> 10:40.560
And also, it almost feels like he's got a hoodie on.

10:40.560 --> 10:41.560
He does.

10:41.560 --> 10:44.800
And this photo was taped together.

10:44.800 --> 10:48.200
It's like she took a photo of him and taped it to a photo of herself.

10:48.200 --> 10:49.800
She loves him that much.

10:49.800 --> 10:52.200
Or maybe he did it because he hearts her that much.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.360
And the photo's in the shape of a heart.

10:54.560 --> 10:57.560
I feel like this is going to be our first high school AU.

10:57.560 --> 10:59.560
Which is kind of ironic.

10:59.560 --> 11:01.560
Because we're already in high school.

11:01.560 --> 11:02.560
But yeah.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.400
Junior high AU.

11:04.400 --> 11:11.080
So what we're going to do right now is ask you to please leave your favorites, comments,

11:11.080 --> 11:15.600
suggestions, and we're still open to a tagline in the comments.

11:15.600 --> 11:23.560
And please do so ASAP because by the next time we are speaking to you by way of our

11:23.560 --> 11:30.800
technology cameras, we will have a final decision and a mock-up and a tagline and

11:30.800 --> 11:34.640
everything and then you will just have to just be amazed.

11:34.640 --> 11:40.280
Please give us all of your feedback and congratulations and support to these artists who did such

11:40.280 --> 11:45.560
a good job and did all of the effort way above and beyond the call of duty.

11:45.560 --> 11:46.560
Yes.
