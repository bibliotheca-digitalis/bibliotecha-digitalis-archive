0	7440	So it's mint julep day, here at Fifty Shades of Greek.
7440	8920	Yeah, blackberry mint julep.
8920	9920	We're so southern.
9920	10920	Cheers.
10920	13600	We needed a drink after having all these.
13600	14600	So many submissions.
14600	15600	So many submissions.
15600	16600	Yeah.
16600	19880	We had over 200 submissions in less than a week.
19880	20880	You guys gave us two.
20880	21880	That's a lot of pictures.
21880	22880	A lot of portfolio to go through.
22880	23880	Yeah.
23880	28560	And surprisingly, you know, of that 200, there was a lot of effort in that 200.
28560	29560	Really?
30560	31560	Yeah.
31560	32560	Bravo to our entrants and your effort.
32560	33560	You efforted.
33560	34560	Yes.
34560	35560	All the effort.
35560	40240	We noticed a lot of repeated themes in the things we got, so we divided them into categories
40240	42440	of ones that were similar to each other.
42440	43520	And we're going to show you.
43520	44760	We're going to just blow through them here.
44760	48200	We have 20 finalists of the over 200 we received.
48200	51760	So we're going to put their names at the bottom of the screen, sort of.
51760	54760	And if you see one that you like, note it in the comments.
54760	57400	Because you are helping us choose our winner.
57400	65840	In our first category, in honor of our mint juleps of Southern origin, we have our Fitzgerald
65840	69560	category or the eyes are watching you.
69560	74280	The eyes that stare into your soul and say, read me precious, read me.
74280	77080	I also like that the tentacles are not too overtly tentacly.
77080	78720	They're a little kelp-ish.
78720	79720	Yeah.
79720	81840	Flower petals.
81840	89300	This is another by the same artist, a different concept on her theme, where we have the tentacles
89300	91200	coming around the eyes.
91200	96880	So keeping with our eye theme, this one's kind of a combination of eye and girl going
96880	97880	places.
97880	102800	Well, I guess it kind of works because it really captures that whole stalkery vibe that
102800	103800	we were going for.
103800	105000	I think the ladies really like that.
105000	108200	I also like that the A comes down to a little tentacle.
108200	114520	So now we're starting into our second trend, which is girl falling.
114520	122040	Here was a sort of dynamic image that we did enjoy, except for the slingshot-like apparatus
122040	123040	around her.
123040	125840	That would be something that we would ask the finalists to sort of nix, to figure out
125840	126840	a way around it.
126840	128720	It's like the stork just arrived.
128720	132320	There was also two variations of this, one the tentacles coming down to sort of rescue
132320	134840	her, one the tentacles reaching up to grab her.
134840	137000	I think we went for the tentacles going up.
137040	139040	Yeah, we actually kind of had a fight about this.
139040	141000	I like the tentacles coming down.
141000	143120	We didn't talk for like two days after that fight.
143120	146040	I know, I had to, I felt so alone.
146040	147360	I still have the wounds.
147360	155480	And then next we have, this is a very fish's eye view of, you can see the tentacles coming
155480	159320	up and she's about to fall into his squirming grasp.
159320	162760	Yeah, she's like kind of chilling at the top of the lake or something.
162760	165160	So then there's this guy.
165160	171400	This one kind of fell in more with the shadowbox theme, and while I do like the kind of shadowbox
171400	174960	and the colors, I feel like there's a lot of dead space here, which maybe this should
174960	178880	go here or something like that.
178880	183120	So here is another one that we felt was a very dynamic image, there seems to be a lot
183120	188760	of motion going on, the tentacle, not tentacle, reaching out and grabbing her.
188760	192880	Another trend we found in the entries was the mope.
192880	195000	Yeah, which is a very apt.
195000	197400	Yeah, no, definitely very fitting.
197400	203280	Like for example this, which we also have the no eyes motif that I find is popular in
203280	205080	young adult.
205080	209600	This is actually quite beautiful and there's a graphic design detail, it's very comic book-y
209600	210880	though too.
210880	213920	So this example of the mope is quite lovely.
213920	222240	I love the art and the more graphic, like woodblock print of tentacles coming out here
222240	227160	over the very soft art is a nice contrast and you've got your moping girl, which is
227160	229840	your classic YA cover.
229840	234840	This artist gave us three submissions and we really, really liked all three of them
234840	240480	and I think it's particularly the fact that it's so sketchy but you got such a good idea
240480	241480	of what it was.
241600	244040	I felt like this was a good idea of the mope.
244040	249280	She's wearing her ball gown, surrounded by the tentacles, I presume she has a mopey face
249280	250280	here.
250280	251280	This is a bit of a mope going on.
251280	252280	It's a little mopey.
252280	258480	It's a little mope, but it's got really, really clean lines to it, again a very almost comic
258480	261320	graphic design going on here.
261320	265880	I feel like that one captures the whole, like, I am the special snowflake of destiny.
265880	270840	The only thing we'd probably, like, with this one, it's like the really obvious but simplified
270840	274160	like, the people in the background might be a little too on the nose.
274160	275160	And we have another mope.
275160	280200	This one, it's the solitary tentacle that comes down and caresses her and you can tell
280200	283040	there's love in this caress, he's not strangling her.
283040	287640	Here's another good mope, I like this mope, but it's also sort of like a hopeful mope
287640	291240	because she's like, you're beautiful.
291240	296760	This one I kind of really enjoy and here you see we have what the full book spread would
296760	300840	look like with the background, the synopsis here, synopsis here, synopsis here, synopsis
300840	301840	here.
301840	305960	Cthulhu, Riley, Wagon, Fatagan, synopsis here.
305960	310440	Obviously a drawn image, but with the eyes hidden as they are, I think it works really
310440	311440	well.
311440	315840	It feels, like, this I almost feel is the mope in the beautiful creatures category.
315840	320080	Like it feels very young adult paranormal romance to me.
320080	323920	And here's our last mope.
324080	329760	We put this in the finalists mainly just because it was so well done and it was so mopey.
329760	335360	I guess it doesn't have a whole lot to do with what actually happens in the book.
335360	340680	And I really like her mopey expression and obviously the artist is very, very, very good
340680	347760	at capturing a more realistic look, like a more photographic kind of art.
347760	348760	We had a lot of hands.
348760	353560	We ended up really only picking one of them as our finalists and honestly this is kind
353560	355000	of my number one right now.
355000	361120	Again, it's from that same artist, Ariel Johnson from earlier, that again was just like a really
361120	366760	sketchy, sketchy mock-up, but you get such a good idea of what it is and it was just
366760	372840	such an expressive hand and those tentacles are just, they want her and they don't know
372840	374400	how to ask.
374400	379400	The next trope that we did was the girl going places, which you see a lot on YA covers.
379440	385080	So this one's very dark and moody and you can't really see it from here, but there's
385080	386640	hints of tentacle in the background.
386640	391120	There's actually a hint of maybe Cthulhu himself back there, but it's so subtle that I think
391120	394680	you could actually get away with it and it's green, but it looks black.
394680	400360	This one did the nice sort of little shadowboxy modern graphic design thing and have her little
400360	401360	ocean thing.
401360	404760	One problem is the fact that she's naked.
404760	405760	Usually they wear ball gowns.
406120	411040	Yeah, but you could draw a ball gown on her, artists, so that would be a change we'd ask
411040	412040	for.
412040	417840	Here's a very different style example of something that was very silhouette and very sparse,
417840	422120	but still very much something that you'd see right now, whereas, is this a tree?
422120	423120	Is it fire?
423120	424120	Is it tentacles?
424120	428000	I don't know, but it makes me want to read to find out and she sure looks like she's
428000	429360	going somewhere.
429360	435840	This was my favorite of the Girl Going Places one, mainly because, first off, you have the
435840	440680	framing of the dark color and also these, they're not quite tentacles, but they are
440680	441880	reaching into it.
441880	446920	It looks a little El Dakari without being disgusting, like I think Sarah would think
446920	447920	it was.
447920	452840	We had some that don't work at all, but we still really, really love, so we're going
452840	455720	to show them as our audible mentions.
455720	458600	So these ones are kind of small, so I'm going to bring it kind of close.
458720	463920	I really liked all three of them, especially the middle one with the hand reaching out
463920	465000	and grasping a tentacle.
465000	466960	We actually got a lot of those.
466960	472560	For me, this one was one of my favorites that, unfortunately, it just won't work, but this
472560	477840	is something in a cover that, man, if I was in high school and middle school, I would
477840	479360	have picked this book up so fast.
479360	483640	If this had happened in 1993 and Avi had written it.
483640	486400	To me, yeah, exactly, this is very Avi.
486400	491120	To me, this is someone creating this character based on descriptions of the book.
491120	495000	Obviously, this one, I love that one.
495000	498320	Nella and I, we thought this one was great.
498320	502720	Awoken, or How I Learned to Cope with Seeing Forever.
502720	509560	And this one was just such a perfect, of the sort of kitschy YA contemporary, the book
509560	512720	equivalent of indie romance.
512720	513720	It would be a quirky romance.
513720	514720	Yeah, exactly.
514720	520160	It felt like a sort of early John Green book kind of thing that didn't have anything to
520160	521160	do with cancer.
521160	525760	The problem with this one was it looked more like a sort of graphic novel cover and more
525760	530480	like an illustration than what you would see in a traditional YA, but it was very pretty.
530480	533520	I like how the ribbons turn into tentacles.
533520	539400	And this one, again, a little bit too manga cover or graphic novel, but I like that it's
539400	541200	very abstract with the swirling.
541200	543200	Like, is that a wave or is it a tentacle?
543200	548760	I can't tell, and it comes around and then she's drowning, but I'm not.
548760	553560	The title fits into the curve of the wave slash tentacle.
553560	554880	This one I really enjoyed.
554880	559400	I did really enjoy the silhouette of the girl.
559400	564240	Also though, what I absolutely adore of all things is the tentacles come into a heart
564240	565240	shape in the middle.
565240	572000	But it's like he's rising from the deep, and it's like, hey girl.
572000	577440	Of the 200 plus we got, a little bit less than 10%.
577440	582040	Which honestly, we're surprised that we got that many because we expended quite a bit
582040	584800	for the writing portion because, you know.
584800	585800	Writing's easy.
585800	590240	Lots of the little are precious snowflake writers out there.
590240	592280	You're all geniuses.
592280	595840	And to pull this off in less than a week, we gave our writing samples a lot more time
595840	596840	than that.
596840	597840	Yeah.
597840	603560	So what you are going to do now, what we need from you, is to tell us in the comments
603560	604800	which artist you like best.
604800	606640	And you saw all their names at the bottom of the video.
606640	608840	Go back and watch again if you have to.
608840	609840	And just leave.
609840	610840	Yes, go back and watch again.
610840	613200	Who watched this video like 18 times?
613200	616140	Watch it if you must, again.
616140	617840	Just make sure you refresh the page.
617840	618840	A little satisfaction.
618840	619840	Oh, of course.
619840	623720	And the honorable mentions, though we think they're awesome, they don't count so don't
623720	624720	vote for them.
624720	626960	The Little Miss Sunshine one is not going to happen.
627080	628080	I'm sorry.
628080	629080	I love it.
629080	634280	I think it could happen in like an ultra special edition, maybe one day if we go to a con.
634280	636560	She's just like, he's my first boyfriend.
636560	637560	I know.
637560	640560	And also, it almost feels like he's got a hoodie on.
640560	641560	He does.
641560	644800	And this photo was taped together.
644800	648200	It's like she took a photo of him and taped it to a photo of herself.
648200	649800	She loves him that much.
649800	652200	Or maybe he did it because he hearts her that much.
652200	654360	And the photo's in the shape of a heart.
654560	657560	I feel like this is going to be our first high school AU.
657560	659560	Which is kind of ironic.
659560	661560	Because we're already in high school.
661560	662560	But yeah.
662560	664400	Junior high AU.
664400	671080	So what we're going to do right now is ask you to please leave your favorites, comments,
671080	675600	suggestions, and we're still open to a tagline in the comments.
675600	683560	And please do so ASAP because by the next time we are speaking to you by way of our
683560	690800	technology cameras, we will have a final decision and a mock-up and a tagline and
690800	694640	everything and then you will just have to just be amazed.
694640	700280	Please give us all of your feedback and congratulations and support to these artists who did such
700280	705560	a good job and did all of the effort way above and beyond the call of duty.
705560	706560	Yes.
706560	709720	And if you did a piece, feel free to share it.
709720	710720	There's no secrecy here.
710720	711720	It's not like you can't put it on your...
711720	713000	You own the copyright.
713160	715560	Put it on your DA, put it on your Tumblr, do whatever you want with it.
715560	716560	It's your art.
716560	719080	I have a feeling our wall is going to be a lot more crowded.
719080	722920	Yeah, we're going to have to pull these cameras back.
722920	724120	All 200 plus entries.
