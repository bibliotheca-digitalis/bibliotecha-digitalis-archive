WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:22.720
So, the internet has lost its mind.

00:22.720 --> 00:31.160
I include myself in that description.

00:31.160 --> 00:36.920
I cannot open my YouTube homepage without a flood of angry Game of Thrones hot takes

00:36.920 --> 00:43.760
and here I am, a month late to the conversation, just adding to that deluge and I'm sorry.

00:43.760 --> 00:53.040
But you know, sometimes you've got some feelings and you just, you just gotta monetize them.

00:53.040 --> 00:57.280
How did this cultural landmark, one of the most popular television shows in history,

00:57.280 --> 01:01.680
critical darling and commercial success, a show that unequivocally changed the way television

01:01.680 --> 01:13.400
was made, end as such a trash fire?

01:13.400 --> 01:15.440
It's not like there was a change in the creative heads.

01:15.440 --> 01:20.280
The showrunners were always the same, cast was almost uniformly the same.

01:20.280 --> 01:24.560
So like, what the hell?

01:24.560 --> 01:30.560
So this is yet another autopsy on what I think the hell happened.

01:30.560 --> 01:34.880
And for the most part, I'm going to keep this to a discussion of the TV show.

01:34.880 --> 01:40.720
We could get into discussions of author intentionality and adaptation, but I'm going to stop you

01:40.720 --> 01:42.760
right there because I don't care.

01:42.760 --> 01:47.160
This is an adaptation, therefore every creative decision should stand on its own, regardless

01:47.160 --> 01:51.360
of whether it was in the books or not, or how you think George R.R. Martin is going

01:51.360 --> 01:53.840
to go with it, whatever.

01:53.840 --> 01:55.800
Because the books aren't done yet.

01:55.800 --> 01:56.800
The show is.

01:56.800 --> 01:58.440
So what you're whinging about?

01:58.440 --> 02:00.440
I'm not whinging.

02:00.440 --> 02:03.200
Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something.

02:03.200 --> 02:06.800
That's whinging.

02:06.800 --> 02:10.000
The most common talking point in the wake of the finale of Game of Thrones is that the

02:10.000 --> 02:15.520
writing wasâ€¦ bad.

02:15.520 --> 02:19.720
So with a popular thing always comes controversy, and Game of Thrones was no exception.

02:19.720 --> 02:24.280
From day one we had hot takes about its portrayal of gender, about its portrayal of race, sexual

02:24.280 --> 02:26.880
violence, exploitation, you name it.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.680
Your mileage may vary on how much you're willing to put up with.

02:29.680 --> 02:36.400
I was willing to roll with the problematic elements, not ignore them, but accept them.

02:36.400 --> 02:41.840
But the critique of sexism and racism in media is not, not relevant to the discussion

02:41.840 --> 02:43.280
of bad writing.

02:43.280 --> 02:46.480
When you default to stereotyping, you're being lazy and thoughtless, which generally

02:46.480 --> 02:49.560
makes for bad, or at least uninteresting, writing.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.920
Dwarves have mad eyes.

02:51.920 --> 02:54.440
For more on that, see the Bride episode.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.000
Fairy lives don't matter today.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.080
But at the same time, no piece of media is ever going to be ideologically pure, and it's

03:00.080 --> 03:04.440
unrealistic to expect that.

03:04.480 --> 03:07.720
Critics and fans alike have been discussing the problematic elements of Game of Thrones

03:07.720 --> 03:09.600
since the day it debuted.

03:09.600 --> 03:13.520
For some, they wore too much, and these people stopped watching.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.800
I know a lot of these people.

03:15.800 --> 03:21.160
For others, people like me, they digested it, yep, Sansa's getting raped and Theon

03:21.160 --> 03:31.240
has to watch, but we accepted it and continued to watch because hey, surely this is leading

03:31.240 --> 03:33.320
up to something riveting.

03:33.320 --> 03:35.320
Or at least poignant.

03:35.320 --> 03:43.320
It's not like critique of Game of Thrones is anything new, but it's different now.

03:43.320 --> 03:53.560
Before it was about, like, how the thing is problematic, or when is it okay to have a

03:53.560 --> 03:55.180
rape scene.

03:55.180 --> 04:00.640
Now the discussion is more about, like, structure and planting and payoff and character development

04:00.640 --> 04:04.920
and screenwriting and audience expectations and subverting expectations.

04:04.920 --> 04:10.800
Sir Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of

04:10.800 --> 04:11.800
Coin.

04:11.800 --> 04:14.320
But there's more to it than that.

04:14.320 --> 04:18.000
In fan culture in general, especially for a long-running, beloved series like Game of

04:18.000 --> 04:25.040
Thrones, we may eventually run into the...

04:25.040 --> 04:27.600
Which might make you defend a thing way longer than you should have.

04:27.600 --> 04:31.000
After all, you've watched and re-watched all of the seasons multiple times, you have

04:31.000 --> 04:34.960
a dedicated twitter account just for live-tweeting Game of Thrones.

04:34.960 --> 04:40.200
Yeah, okay, everyone can fast-travel all of a sudden when distance was a huge tactical

04:40.200 --> 04:43.920
consideration in early seasons, but whatever, it's fine.

04:43.920 --> 04:48.020
I'm fine, I'm sure this is because the story needs to head somewhere important.

04:48.020 --> 04:55.640
Season 7 wasn't bad, they were just building up to something cool, give them a chance.

04:55.640 --> 05:04.600
What I hear really often, probably even more often than I don't watch the show, is I stopped

05:04.600 --> 05:09.680
watching the show, usually around season 5 when it really started to go off the rails.

05:09.680 --> 05:14.600
But either way, don't worry, we are going to do a quick recap for the benefit of the

05:14.600 --> 05:20.520
people who stopped watching the show, who never watched the show, and probably the people

05:20.520 --> 05:23.400
who everyone needs a quick recap anyway.

05:23.400 --> 05:29.400
And by quick, I mean about half the runtime of this video.

05:29.400 --> 05:33.880
And I'm also about to steal a lot of jokes from Gay of Thrones, so sorry Jonathan Van

05:33.880 --> 05:36.200
Ness, you're just too difficult not to steal from.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.200
Strap in!

05:37.200 --> 05:41.080
Season 1, basically a murder mystery surrounding the line of succession for the Iron Throne

05:41.080 --> 05:43.560
after the last Hand of the King dies.

05:43.560 --> 05:47.200
Hand of the King is basically the Grand Vizier, let's say.

05:47.200 --> 05:51.000
She says Jon Arryn was murdered.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.600
Episode 1 ends with a child witnessing some incest, and Prince Charming from Shrek 2,

05:55.600 --> 06:00.840
aka Brother Dee, pushing the child out of a window, presumably to kill him, but he fails.

06:00.840 --> 06:04.760
The King asks Sean Bean to be the new Hand of the King after the old one dies mysteriously,

06:04.760 --> 06:07.360
so he goes to King's Landing with his two daughters.

06:07.360 --> 06:11.160
He engages daughter Sansa to the evil Prince, she's thrilled.

06:11.160 --> 06:14.620
But eventually Sean Bean discovers that the Prince is the incest bastard of Lena Headey

06:14.620 --> 06:34.740
and Brother Dee, and not the legitimate son of the King, Bobby B.

06:34.740 --> 06:39.140
But Bobby B dies, Sean Bean gets beheaded, and a big ol' war begins.

06:39.140 --> 06:43.340
Sean Bean's people fighting for independence, and everyone else fighting for the throne.

06:43.380 --> 06:48.460
And also Lord Life Alert over here is like, hey, I'm in the war too, but nobody cares.

06:48.460 --> 06:52.780
Daughter Sansa becomes a captive, other daughter Arya escaped, and is angry.

06:52.780 --> 06:58.380
Meanwhile, across the sea, the deposed King's daughter Daenerys, um, gets married off to

06:58.380 --> 06:59.980
this guy and raped.

06:59.980 --> 07:06.860
But then her husband learns to respect her, and it's fine, but oh no, he's dead.

07:06.860 --> 07:10.780
But then she gets some dragons, and up north Jon Snow discovers some ice zombies.

07:10.780 --> 07:17.100
And two, big ol' war for succession, Bobby B has two brothers, plus inbred bastard King,

07:17.100 --> 07:22.500
plus Sean Bean's son, and also Lord of the no one cares islands is like, hey, I'm in

07:22.500 --> 07:24.420
the war too, but nobody cares.

07:24.420 --> 07:29.140
Ending in a big battle led by Peter Dinklage, evil inbred bastard King side wins, but Charles

07:29.140 --> 07:32.540
Dance is the real power behind the throne, and also the best character in television

07:32.540 --> 07:35.100
history, do not at me, he just is.

07:35.100 --> 07:38.860
Meanwhile, Sean Bean's people are winning the war for independence, and Sean Bean Jr.

07:38.860 --> 07:43.740
is supposed to marry Lord Lifelord's daughter, but then he marries Una Chaplin instead, fun

07:43.740 --> 07:46.020
fact, that's Charlie Chaplin's great-granddaughter.

07:46.020 --> 07:48.060
Up north, more zombies.

07:48.060 --> 07:52.860
Season three, no one is grateful to Peter Dinklage for his role in the big battle, aw,

07:52.860 --> 07:56.860
well he gets to be secretary of the treasury anyway, Arya's still angry, Sansa is no longer

07:56.860 --> 08:02.060
evil inbred bastard King's fiance, Natalie Dormer is, Arya is kidnapped by this guy he's

08:02.060 --> 08:06.440
called the Hound, don't worry, he's great, Brother Dee had a genuinely wonderful redemption

08:06.440 --> 08:14.560
arc with Captain Phasma, seriously, it's some of the best television in all of television.

08:14.560 --> 08:19.040
Sean Bean Jr.'s campaign is no longer going so well, they plan to wed a different Lord

08:19.040 --> 08:23.560
to Lord Lifelord's daughter that Sean Bean Jr. was supposed to marry, but instead the

08:23.560 --> 08:28.480
wedding ends in a massacre and the whole family is slaughtered, this is the infamous Red Wedding,

08:28.480 --> 08:31.200
the war for northern independence is over.

08:31.200 --> 08:35.580
Across the sea, Daenerys has been using those dragons to liberate a bunch of slaves, season

08:35.580 --> 08:40.300
ends with her big white savior moment, season four, evil inbred bastard King is poisoned

08:40.300 --> 08:44.540
at his own wedding, Peter Dinklage is framed for it, Sansa escapes to the north with the

08:44.540 --> 08:48.900
help of totally trustworthy, you know what, I'm just going to steal another thing from

08:48.900 --> 08:54.700
Gay of Thrones vintage Alan Cumming, doe-eyed inbred bastard King is now king, Natalie Dormer

08:54.700 --> 08:59.260
is engaged to him, after a rigged trial, Tyrion demands a trial by combat, which goes well

08:59.260 --> 09:03.520
for him until it doesn't, his brother Dee sneaks him out of the city, but not before

09:03.520 --> 09:16.160
he murders Charles Dance, and also his girlfriend, but don't worry, he's still totally sympathetic.

09:16.160 --> 09:19.840
Arya's travel companion the Hound loses in battle to Captain Phasma, she escapes him

09:19.840 --> 09:23.340
and decides to leave the country to go to assassin school, up north there's a battle

09:23.340 --> 09:28.260
between these people, who are trying to escape the ice zombies, and the border patrol Jon

09:28.260 --> 09:33.220
Snow is a part of, his love interest dies, Daenerys conquers another slave city and decides

09:33.220 --> 09:36.700
to rule it instead of coming to Westeros, child who was pushed out of the window in

09:36.700 --> 09:43.260
season 1, he's like learning omniscient mind powers from Max von Saito.

09:43.260 --> 09:46.500
Season 5 Tyrion with the help of Lord Doctor Evil is

09:46.500 --> 09:51.580
running around Essos trying to find Daenerys, Cersei tries to exploit rising religious extremism

09:51.580 --> 09:55.660
in the capital, which oops really backfires on her once they find out about all those

09:55.660 --> 10:00.380
inbred bastard kings, there's a really dumb subplot involving this guy's people that

10:00.380 --> 10:09.340
gets dropped the following season, it's awful, Bobby B's brother, the guy with the

10:09.340 --> 10:14.220
strongest claim to the throne, burns his daughter to death, because he thinks that will give

10:14.220 --> 10:24.780
him some fire magic to win a battle, it doesn't, Arya goes to ninja school, decides it isn't

10:24.780 --> 10:29.420
for her and leaves, Daenerys is bad at ruling a city whose culture she does not understand,

10:29.420 --> 10:34.180
her dragons are unruly, she's bad at everything, eventually there's a pro-slave rebellion,

10:34.180 --> 10:38.460
she almost gets killed, but don't worry her main dragon saves her, his name is Drogon,

10:38.460 --> 10:42.460
Jon Snow tries to help the free folk they were battling in the previous season because

10:42.460 --> 10:47.700
it turns out those ice zombies are raising an army of regular zombies, and the more dead

10:47.700 --> 10:52.740
bodies they have the bigger their army gets, his border patrol brothers stab him to death

10:52.740 --> 10:58.060
because they don't like that he's helping the foreigners, he's dead, Sansa.

10:58.060 --> 11:06.020
You've known Sansa since she was a girl, now watch her become a woman.

11:06.020 --> 11:13.660
So uh, here is where we pretty much completely run out of books to adapt.

11:13.660 --> 11:14.900
Season 6!

11:14.900 --> 11:18.860
Jon Snow gets resurrected by the woman who talked Bobby B's brother into burning his

11:18.860 --> 11:24.100
daughter alive, Daenerys is captured by the people she married into in season 1 and is

11:24.100 --> 11:29.740
forced into captivity with the other Kull widows, but manages to wow them all by murdering

11:29.740 --> 11:35.620
all of their kings with fire, but you know, she herself is immune to being set on fire,

11:35.620 --> 11:39.460
which means she's the Kull now because that's how the society works so she reunites with

11:39.460 --> 11:45.740
her dragons and manages to do one-two punch of liberating Meereen from the pro-slave rebellion.

11:45.740 --> 11:50.740
Lord of the No One Cares Island gets thrown off a bridge by Hot Topic Pirate, aka the

11:50.740 --> 12:03.460
worst character in the show, or possibly any show, Arya murders the entire house of Lord

12:03.460 --> 12:09.100
Life Alert, and then feeds them to him, and then kills Lord Life Alert, Tyrion becomes

12:09.100 --> 12:12.460
Hand of the Queen for some goddamn reason, I don't know, probably because he's played

12:12.460 --> 12:17.300
by Peter Dinklage, then it's off to Westeros for Dany and her entourage, with the help

12:17.300 --> 12:22.260
of Lord No One Cares Island's daughter and the Iron Fleet, which I haven't mentioned

12:22.260 --> 12:27.300
yet, but they're about to get real frustrating, Sansa escapes and reunites with Jon Snow,

12:27.300 --> 12:40.860
they reclaim Winterfell for the Starks, and feed to his dogs, it is an empowering feminist

12:40.860 --> 12:41.860
moment.

12:41.860 --> 12:46.660
Oh, and Cersei blows up the Vatican, wipes out the religious extremists and her adversaries

12:46.660 --> 12:51.100
in the aristocracy, and parks herself at the balcony drinking wine, where she will stay

12:51.100 --> 12:53.540
for the next two seasons.

12:53.540 --> 12:56.060
But not before her last child kills himself.

12:56.060 --> 12:57.060
SEASON SEVEN!

12:57.060 --> 12:59.340
Okay, it's about to get really dumb.

12:59.340 --> 13:02.220
It's a pretty song, I've never heard it before.

13:02.220 --> 13:03.900
It's a new one.

13:03.900 --> 13:04.900
Whee!

13:04.900 --> 13:06.540
Daenerys and Jon Snow have a meet-cute.

13:06.540 --> 13:09.900
I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you.

13:09.900 --> 13:14.700
In the time since he's met me, he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow, and

13:14.700 --> 13:16.500
now he's calling me a child.

13:16.500 --> 13:21.060
I believe he's calling all of his children.

13:21.060 --> 13:22.060
Figure of speech.

13:22.060 --> 13:28.660
But they spend most of the season faffing around, whether Jon Snow will bend the knee,

13:28.660 --> 13:33.060
on behalf of the North, after he helps Dany take the throne, debate about whether or not

13:33.060 --> 13:36.540
to fight the White Walkers or go after Cersei first.

13:36.540 --> 13:41.140
Daenerys battles the Lannisters a bit, Jon Snow and Daenerys f**k.

13:41.140 --> 13:44.980
And then, okay, this is where it gets really dumb.

13:44.980 --> 13:51.020
Alright, so everyone is like, hey, the big existential threat is the ice zombies.

13:51.020 --> 13:56.100
How do we convince Cersei to stop fighting us so we can deal with the existential zombie

13:56.100 --> 13:57.100
threat?

13:57.100 --> 13:58.100
I know!

13:58.100 --> 14:03.460
Let's send the Magnificent Seven north of the Wall to get a sample zombie.

14:03.460 --> 14:09.420
So they do that, and it is the dumbest thing, but you, like me, are willing to give these

14:09.420 --> 14:13.900
showrunners the benefit of the doubt, like, oh boy, you know, they're just doing this

14:13.900 --> 14:16.300
dumb thing to get to the good stuff.

14:16.300 --> 14:24.580
So they get stuck, and Bobby B's bastard son has to go do chariots of fire and send a note

14:24.580 --> 14:31.460
to Daenerys to please come save us, which she does, risking her life to do so, but loses

14:31.460 --> 14:34.580
a goddamn dragon in the process.

14:34.580 --> 14:36.780
But whatever, she saves their asses.

14:36.780 --> 14:40.980
And it is here, only after she risked her life and lost a goddamn dragon, that Jon is

14:40.980 --> 14:47.620
like, okay, I will bend the knee, and Daenerys is like, okay, well, I already ate some humble

14:47.620 --> 14:52.140
pie to save you, so I hope I am worthy of this, because I know this is a big deal, not

14:52.140 --> 14:56.980
only for you, but, you know, for humanity to, you know, survive.

14:56.980 --> 15:01.860
So then they fast travel to King's Landing and show Cersei the zombie, and they're like,

15:01.860 --> 15:08.740
trust us, I know this is just one, but there's a lot of these, and Cersei's like, okay, truce,

15:08.740 --> 15:12.500
and also I will send soldiers to help you fight the ice zombies.

15:12.500 --> 15:13.500
But guess what?

15:13.500 --> 15:14.500
She's lying!

15:14.500 --> 15:16.340
You pledged to our forces to fight our coming in.

15:16.340 --> 15:19.300
I say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house.

15:19.300 --> 15:23.300
And it is only then that Brother Dee is like, you know, I think I've had enough of your

15:23.300 --> 15:26.780
conniving and evil and blowing up St. Peter's Basilica.

15:26.780 --> 15:33.780
So this whole stupid subplot was not only a total waste of time, but they lost their

15:33.780 --> 15:39.780
resurrection expert and gave the Night King a goddamn dragon in the process.

15:39.780 --> 15:44.980
Go team.

15:44.980 --> 15:46.260
Season 8!

15:46.260 --> 15:50.620
Episode 1, everyone arrives at Winterfell, Cersei fucks Hot Topic pirate, the North is

15:50.620 --> 15:52.380
racist, I guess.

15:52.460 --> 15:57.620
Episode 2, zombies are coming, oh no, a lot of dialogue, basically reads like a big send-off

15:57.620 --> 16:03.220
to all our favorite characters.

16:03.220 --> 16:07.100
This will go down in history as the last decent episode of Game of Thrones, and also a massive

16:07.100 --> 16:10.020
waste of time that gets totally shat upon later.

16:10.020 --> 16:14.500
Oh, it also turns out that Jon Snow is not a bastard, but is in fact the rightful heir

16:14.500 --> 16:15.500
to the throne.

16:15.500 --> 16:19.860
My real name is Aegon Targaryen.

16:20.300 --> 16:25.060
And also Daenerys' nephew, Wheee.

16:25.060 --> 16:30.500
Episode 3, the big battle, the biggest battle, which almost all of the major characters survive.

16:30.500 --> 16:34.580
And it is resolved when Arya stabs the main ice zombie, the Night King, with a special

16:34.580 --> 16:39.260
blade, and then they do the fantasy trope thing of, you know, oh you killed the main

16:39.260 --> 16:45.860
one, the Eye of Sauron is exploded so all of the orcs are dead now.

16:45.860 --> 16:48.420
So yeah.

16:48.420 --> 16:51.740
So that's the end of that, I guess.

16:51.740 --> 16:55.220
No more ice zombies, really.

16:55.220 --> 17:00.140
And we still have three episodes to go, and they're all 90 minutes each, oh good.

17:00.140 --> 17:06.020
Episode 4, I Want to Die, time to head south and conquer Cersei, only on the way Hot Topic

17:06.020 --> 17:13.500
Pirate shoots one of those indestructible dragons out of the sky with two million to

17:13.500 --> 17:19.300
one shots from a mile away, which the dragons did not see.

17:19.300 --> 17:23.620
Also somehow they captured Daenerys' gal pal, but no one else.

17:23.620 --> 17:25.260
And guess what happens to her?

17:25.260 --> 17:26.260
Yep.

17:26.260 --> 17:27.260
Yep.

17:27.260 --> 17:30.020
Also everyone kind of wants to do some treason on Daenerys for some reason, even though she

17:30.020 --> 17:31.820
has by this point done nothing wrong.

17:31.820 --> 17:36.500
If you consider it, the best ruler might be someone who doesn't want to rule.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.980
We're discussing treason.

17:38.980 --> 17:44.780
She's like a literal war hero, but Lord Doctor Evil is like, hmm, I don't know, I was supporting

17:44.780 --> 17:49.900
her for like half of the entire show, but I got a hunch.

17:49.900 --> 17:53.100
He's temperate and measured.

17:53.100 --> 17:57.340
He's a man, which makes him more appealing to the lords of Westeros.

17:57.340 --> 18:01.780
Episode 5, Kill Me, time to invade King's Landing, but not before burning Lord Doctor

18:01.780 --> 18:05.320
Evil alive, because he's doing some treason.

18:05.320 --> 18:09.680
The invasion succeeds, and it is absurdly one-sided and easy.

18:09.680 --> 18:14.280
Turns out it does not matter at all that Daenerys lost half her forces or two of her dragons.

18:14.280 --> 18:16.640
They invade the city in like 90 seconds.

18:16.640 --> 18:19.600
And Tyrion's like, okay, when they ring the bells.

18:19.600 --> 18:20.600
Ringing the bells.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.600
Ring all the bells.

18:21.600 --> 18:22.600
Ring the bells.

18:22.600 --> 18:23.600
Hear the bells ring.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.600
If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates.

18:25.600 --> 18:30.600
I've always hated the bells.

18:30.600 --> 18:31.600
They ring for horror.

18:31.600 --> 18:34.600
A dead king, a city under siege.

18:34.600 --> 18:38.600
If they're welcoming then you king.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.880
I've never known bells to mean surrender.

18:40.880 --> 18:43.480
If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates.

18:43.480 --> 18:48.400
And then the bells ring and then Daenerys is like, no, I think, um, I'm going to go

18:48.400 --> 18:49.960
do some war crimes.

18:49.960 --> 18:54.400
And then like does a 9-11 times a hundred.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.600
9-11 times a hundred.

18:56.600 --> 18:57.600
Jesus.

18:57.600 --> 18:58.600
That's...

18:58.600 --> 18:59.600
Yes.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.600
9-11 times a hundred.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.600
Episode 6.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.600
I long for death.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.600
Triumph of the will shots all around.

19:05.600 --> 19:16.080
Dany does her big fascism speech in scary foreign language and Nazi clothes.

19:16.080 --> 19:20.520
The only non-white characters left in the show are the people who are really into it.

19:20.520 --> 19:24.160
Tyrion's like, well, the madness has taken her.

19:24.160 --> 19:33.760
We should probably put her down like Old Yeller.

19:33.760 --> 19:43.280
And Jon Snow, who has done nothing all season but say, she's my queen, is like, no.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.800
But then he goes and puts her down like Old Yeller.

19:45.800 --> 19:50.640
Her one surviving dragon in a fit of rage burns not the person responsible for her murder,

19:50.640 --> 19:52.960
but the symbolism.

19:52.960 --> 19:54.680
And then he flies away with her corpse.

19:54.680 --> 19:59.040
There is a trial in which the prisoner is allowed to nominate the new king, which no

19:59.040 --> 20:02.760
one has discussed in the intervening months, apparently.

20:02.760 --> 20:07.120
And who has a better story than Bran the Broken?

20:07.120 --> 20:13.480
And yeah, the omniscient guy ends up on the throne and we get our John Hughes ending where

20:13.480 --> 20:19.720
the Kinslayer and the Queenslayer just gets to go up north to Snowchella.

20:19.760 --> 20:24.560
And all of these people whose god-queen has been murdered by this guy are like, well,

20:24.560 --> 20:27.280
okay, I guess we'll agree to disagree.

20:27.280 --> 20:32.520
And birthright monarchy is over, we have aristocratic oligarchy now instead.

20:32.520 --> 20:35.080
Which is totally better.

20:35.080 --> 20:39.400
The end.

20:39.400 --> 20:44.000
So the ending was, um, it was bad.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.480
It was quite bad.

20:45.520 --> 20:52.560
But the ending was, in fairness, foreshadowed by other things being bad.

20:52.560 --> 20:56.280
So it's not original of me to suggest that Game of Thrones took a sharp dive in quality

20:56.280 --> 20:57.720
after season 4.

20:57.720 --> 21:00.760
Some have blamed that on the show running out of source material, others have said as

21:00.760 --> 21:05.040
much as the lack of interesting new characters, as all your faves were rapidly dying off,

21:05.040 --> 21:08.040
which they weren't really in the books, whatever, I'm not here for that.

21:08.040 --> 21:09.760
So what really changed?

21:09.760 --> 21:14.600
Well, as I see it, there were two main storytelling component shifts.

21:14.720 --> 21:19.920
One, that characters, let's take for instance Tyrion, who are defined by their intelligence

21:19.920 --> 21:23.640
and ability to read the writing on the wall as far as Westerosi politics go,

21:23.640 --> 21:29.080
My brother has his sword, and I have my mind, and a mind needs books like a sword needs

21:29.080 --> 21:30.080
a whetstone.

21:30.080 --> 21:33.920
suddenly had to take a whole bunch of stupid pills in order for the plot to get where it

21:33.920 --> 21:35.400
needed to be.

21:35.400 --> 21:40.240
And, number two, where in earlier seasons the plot was highly motivated by the social

21:40.240 --> 21:44.880
trends of its fictional world, see the rise in religious extremism in season 5, the show

21:44.880 --> 21:49.440
completely opted to ignore them in later seasons because it was simply inconvenient to the

21:49.440 --> 21:50.440
plot.

21:50.440 --> 21:54.720
Writer and researcher Zeynep Tufekci wrote a blog entry for Scientific American in which

21:54.720 --> 21:58.800
she posited that this shift lie in the fact that the first few seasons were dominated

21:58.800 --> 22:03.920
by sociologically driven storytelling, i.e. characters responding to a broad physical

22:03.920 --> 22:08.560
and social institution, and that the latter seasons were driven by psychologically driven

22:08.680 --> 22:14.280
storytelling, as in driven by the characters themselves, and therefore were more in line

22:14.280 --> 22:16.440
with typical Hollywood storytelling.

22:16.440 --> 22:18.680
I half agree with this.

22:18.680 --> 22:22.520
The show's plot and point of view has always been extremely character driven, and always

22:22.520 --> 22:25.560
extremely in line with Hollywood storytelling in that way.

22:25.560 --> 22:29.880
The plot is driven by a few powerful people trying to figure out how best to manipulate

22:29.880 --> 22:32.960
the society they lived in to their will.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.960
When you play the game of thrones you win, or you die.

22:35.960 --> 22:39.680
But I will agree that earlier seasons had the main characters making decisions less

22:39.680 --> 22:45.040
based on personal whims and more in response to social trends, be it war, politics, religion,

22:45.040 --> 22:46.040
and so on.

22:46.040 --> 22:49.840
But really where things fall apart can be traced to one underlying main problem.

22:49.840 --> 22:55.000
The showrunners had a destination in mind, and a set length of time to get there, meaning

22:55.000 --> 22:59.240
they had to bend the character actions and world around the destination, rather than

22:59.240 --> 23:04.480
allowing the characters and the world to reach the destination organically.

23:04.480 --> 23:10.520
But the problem is, the characters they wrote kind of developed a life of their own, and

23:10.520 --> 23:15.560
the characters in the show are not the same characters as the characters in the books.

23:15.560 --> 23:20.300
Some see this clusterfuck as a problem of having a planned ending, although I personally

23:20.300 --> 23:24.040
think you always need to have a good idea of where you're going in a series.

23:24.040 --> 23:27.440
It's just that whenever you're working towards an ending, you kind of have to accept

23:27.440 --> 23:32.400
that you might not get there the way you think you will, or in how long you think it will

23:32.400 --> 23:33.400
take.

23:33.800 --> 23:34.800
Right, buddy?

23:34.800 --> 23:35.800
These things take time to write.

23:35.800 --> 23:36.800
They're 1,500 pages long.

23:36.800 --> 23:40.840
Some people can't even read them.

23:40.840 --> 23:45.040
So before we really get into where we got, first let's talk about how we got here.

23:50.680 --> 23:53.160
So stop me if you've heard this about Game of Thrones.

23:53.160 --> 23:56.600
It's fantasy for people who don't like fantasy.

23:56.600 --> 24:01.080
This was a popular selling point in the press back in the show's first few seasons, and

24:01.080 --> 24:04.720
given the different landscape of the time, it's easy to see why.

24:04.720 --> 24:07.920
Fantasy did well in film, television not so much.

24:07.920 --> 24:13.280
When Game of Thrones debuted, prestige Soprano-style television that happened to also be genre

24:13.280 --> 24:19.760
fiction was mostly, um, non-existent and or relegated to cable networks like SyFy, then

24:19.760 --> 24:21.520
called the SyFy Channel.

24:21.520 --> 24:25.640
It was the kind of thing that had a cult following on LiveJournal, not the kind of thing your

24:25.640 --> 24:30.360
cousin Brian, who still tailgates at Penn State despite having graduated a decade ago,

24:30.360 --> 24:32.960
would have any interest in discussing at the family reunion.

24:32.960 --> 24:35.840
This dichotomy is, of course, complete nonsense.

24:35.840 --> 24:40.000
There isn't anything appreciably non-fantasy about A Song of Ice and Fire that sets it

24:40.000 --> 24:44.480
apart from the rest of the genre, but try telling cousin Brian that in 2010.

24:44.480 --> 24:47.240
But only nerds appreciate that kind of nuance.

24:47.240 --> 24:48.240
Lightning bolt!

24:48.240 --> 24:49.240
Lightning bolt!

24:49.240 --> 24:54.120
So, in order for a fantasy show to be worth the time and interest of non-genre fans on

24:54.120 --> 24:58.040
a premium subscription channel, it can't just be regular fantasy.

24:58.040 --> 25:05.240
With its, you know, wizards of great import and prophecies and heroes, what we're destinedâ€¦

25:05.240 --> 25:06.240
no.

25:06.240 --> 25:09.520
It had to be hot fantasy that fucks.

25:09.520 --> 25:13.160
The word-of-mouth narrative around the show quickly devolved into a message of, see how

25:13.160 --> 25:17.200
Game of Thrones subverts fantasy expectations?

25:17.200 --> 25:21.440
Because we've never read a fantasy book besides Lord of the Rings before?

25:21.440 --> 25:26.160
See, this isn't your wide-eyed Brotherhood of Man, too-much-hugging-and-forehead-kissing

25:26.160 --> 25:28.240
fantasy for nerds.

25:28.240 --> 25:34.200
This is hardcore, violent, darkly cynical, titty-besotted fantasy.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.200
Hot fantasy that fucks.

25:36.200 --> 25:38.960
They're gods for Bessie.

25:38.960 --> 25:39.960
And they're tits.

25:39.960 --> 25:44.320
Game of Thrones also came about at the dawn of what has become to be known as the golden

25:44.320 --> 25:46.160
age of television.

25:46.160 --> 25:51.000
We could go on for a while as to the validity of this label, but for now, let's just take

25:51.000 --> 25:54.680
for granted that, yeah, sure, this is the golden age of television.

25:54.680 --> 25:55.680
Here we are.

25:55.680 --> 25:56.680
This is it.

25:56.680 --> 25:57.680
We...

25:57.680 --> 25:59.560
What does that mean?

25:59.560 --> 26:04.480
Broadly, the golden age of television is marked by a period of serialized prestige drama that

26:04.480 --> 26:09.480
debatably began with The Sopranos and has now become an oversaturated market with not

26:09.480 --> 26:15.240
only cable and premium channels, i.e. HBO and Showtime, but with streaming venues themselves

26:15.240 --> 26:20.040
less encumbered with budgetary constraints like Amazon and Netflix, not only piggybacking

26:20.040 --> 26:23.680
off of the success of premium cable, but sometimes outshining it.

26:23.680 --> 26:28.080
We've hit a period of oversaturation that is referred to by some as peak TV.

26:28.080 --> 26:33.000
And while that might lead to some truly excellent, polished, high-budget art that we've genuinely

26:33.000 --> 26:38.960
never seen before, the push for networks is more to become the next big thing.

26:38.960 --> 26:43.640
So when you're writing your series, novel, comic, TV, whatever, there are broadly two

26:43.640 --> 26:45.440
ways you can go about it.

26:45.440 --> 26:48.360
You know the ending, or you don't.

26:49.360 --> 26:54.880
Breaking Bad is widely considered to have one of the best, most coherent, most satisfying

26:54.880 --> 26:57.440
finales in all of prestige television.

26:57.440 --> 26:58.960
According to creator Vince Gilligan,

26:58.960 --> 27:03.280
it was designed to be closed-ended and not have even the possibility of going on indefinitely.

27:03.280 --> 27:07.600
It's really incumbent upon us to bring it to as satisfying a conclusion as possible,

27:07.600 --> 27:11.400
and the only way we'll have a chance at doing that is to know exactly when it is that

27:11.400 --> 27:15.120
we're going to end, and also to have that ending not be too far off in the future.

27:15.120 --> 27:18.640
On the other side of the coin, you have shows like Dexter and Lost, where the showrunners

27:18.640 --> 27:23.680
had no endgame plan, and Lost is perhaps the most emblematic of the problem of a concept

27:23.680 --> 27:25.120
with no endgame in mind.

27:25.200 --> 27:28.880
J.J. Abrams is infamous for his mystery box approach to storytelling.

27:28.880 --> 27:33.920
That presenting an audience with a tantalizing mystery, let's say about someone's mysterious

27:33.920 --> 27:34.920
parentage,

27:34.920 --> 27:38.040
For my family, they'll be back.

27:38.040 --> 27:42.200
is a great way to keep them engaged, whether you know the solution to that mystery or not.

27:42.200 --> 27:44.800
But planned finales can also create problems.

27:44.800 --> 27:48.320
Box writer Emily Vanderwerf wrote about the danger of planned finales in the wake of Game

27:48.320 --> 27:49.320
of Thrones.

27:49.320 --> 27:52.440
She points to Breaking Bad as an example of a show that found a way to thread the needle

27:52.440 --> 27:56.040
of planned finale with the organic storytelling that comes with television.

27:56.040 --> 28:00.120
And after Gilligan and company meticulously plotted season 2, they more or less plotted

28:00.120 --> 28:01.680
the rest of the show on the fly.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.280
According to Vanderwerf, this is the paradox of TV.

28:04.280 --> 28:07.840
You'd think that having a satisfying ending would require having a rock-solid plan to

28:07.840 --> 28:11.680
get to that ending, but the opposite is often true, because the more you know about how

28:11.680 --> 28:15.560
a story is going to play out in the macro, the more the micro just becomes a series of

28:15.560 --> 28:17.200
items checked off a list.

28:17.200 --> 28:20.560
Knowing the goal you are working towards is great, but only if you leave room for the

28:20.560 --> 28:24.480
fact that characters and their relationships can change during the life of a show, even

28:24.480 --> 28:26.380
if you totally know where the show is going.

28:26.380 --> 28:29.120
So with Game of Thrones, that was a benefit and a handicap.

28:29.120 --> 28:32.440
The showrunners knew where they were going, even if the actors didn't.

28:32.440 --> 28:35.880
Jon's eyes open as well, already filling with tears.

28:35.880 --> 28:39.320
For a moment neither moves, as if moving will make this real.

28:39.320 --> 28:46.520
We see Jon with his hands still on the hilt of the dagger he just lodged in Dany's heart.

28:46.520 --> 28:50.280
Her strength leaves her and she collapses to the marble.

28:50.280 --> 28:53.960
He keeps her in his arms and she falls, and then raises his sword to strike, but something

28:53.960 --> 28:55.440
is hurtling toward him out of the dark.

28:55.440 --> 28:56.440
Oh, my lord.

28:56.440 --> 28:57.440
Best of my men.

28:57.440 --> 29:00.440
Breaker of chains and mother of dragons.

29:00.440 --> 29:02.840
Our queen's nature is fire and blood.

29:02.840 --> 29:07.160
Standing before the Iron Throne, Dany steps forward and kids plunge their knives into him.

29:07.160 --> 29:10.800
He takes more punishment than Hodor took at the door, than Beric took in the grave.

29:10.800 --> 29:15.360
And in broad strokes, I don't doubt that where D&D ended up was where Martin intended to go.

29:15.360 --> 29:20.200
However, they create big problems in that taking shortcuts, making character changes,

29:20.200 --> 29:23.800
and cutting certain characters and subplots all together, they've written a different

29:23.800 --> 29:25.960
story to the one that Martin wrote.

29:25.960 --> 29:28.880
Their characters are different characters than the ones Martin was writing.

29:28.880 --> 29:33.120
Cersei is different, Daenerys is different, Tyrion is way different.

29:33.120 --> 29:37.560
Damn you, Peter Dinklage, for just being so ding-dang-dong charismatic and handsome.

29:37.560 --> 29:39.560
You're talking to a king!

29:39.560 --> 29:42.560
And now I've struck a king.

29:42.560 --> 29:44.560
Did my hand fall from my wrist?

29:44.560 --> 29:48.800
I will remember you.

29:48.840 --> 29:50.320
But we can't make him the bad guy.

29:50.320 --> 29:53.440
Who cares if he strangled his lover in a jealous rage?

29:53.440 --> 29:57.480
Or in self-defense, as it is in the show.

29:57.480 --> 29:59.480
I guess that's what we're going with.

29:59.480 --> 30:00.480
I'm sorry.

30:05.480 --> 30:08.200
Yeah, see, the way this arc played out was a red flag.

30:08.200 --> 30:12.840
This scene makes no sense, given how both Tyrion and Shae evolved away from their characterization

30:12.840 --> 30:13.840
in the book.

30:14.840 --> 30:18.840
I am yours, and you are mine.

30:18.840 --> 30:21.240
While still getting their book ending.

30:21.240 --> 30:25.280
So the showrunners were given a destination, but when the show they wrote and the characters

30:25.280 --> 30:30.080
they created kind of went in directions that did not work with that predetermined destination,

30:30.080 --> 30:35.840
or at least were going to have to take a very different way to get there, who cares, let's

30:35.840 --> 30:36.960
do it anyway.

30:36.960 --> 30:40.840
So no discussion about prestige television is complete without a talk about the Sopranos,

30:40.840 --> 30:44.400
and this will spoil how The Sopranos ends, so fair warning.

30:44.400 --> 30:47.840
You know, I still have people asking me, what the hell was that last episode?

30:50.840 --> 30:54.080
The Sopranos begin the era of prestige television drama in earnest.

30:54.080 --> 30:57.360
Like Game of Thrones, it was a massive critical darling and commercial success out of the

30:57.360 --> 30:58.360
gate.

30:58.360 --> 31:01.680
So, like Game of Thrones, when The Sopranos ended after six seasons, there was a lot of

31:01.680 --> 31:03.720
build-up for how it would end.

31:03.720 --> 31:05.920
Would one of Tony's many enemies gun him down?

31:05.920 --> 31:09.000
Would he slaughter all of his enemies in some pyrrhic victory?

31:09.000 --> 31:11.480
How would his relationship with Dr. Melfi play out?

31:11.480 --> 31:13.400
Would he walk away from the life altogether?

31:13.400 --> 31:15.520
We get answers to some of these questions.

31:15.520 --> 31:19.520
Dr. Melfi cuts him off when she realizes Tony is a lost cause, and Tony does not walk away

31:19.520 --> 31:20.640
from the life.

31:20.640 --> 31:23.760
The final scene in the show takes place at a diner where Tony is scheduled to meet his

31:23.760 --> 31:25.840
family for a regular dinner.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.080
Carmella shows up.

31:27.080 --> 31:29.440
His daughter has some difficulty parking.

31:29.440 --> 31:30.440
Shit.

31:30.440 --> 31:35.880
But then we notice that several of the other patrons in the diner are acting kind of suspicious

31:35.880 --> 31:38.040
and giving Tony the side-eye.

31:38.080 --> 31:43.080
Journey's don't-stop-believing increases in volume to the point that it's almost overwhelming.

31:43.080 --> 31:46.200
There's this really dissonant, dark, comedic tone.

31:46.200 --> 31:49.080
The scene is building and building in tension, and then...

31:53.200 --> 31:55.280
It cuts to black.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.400
And that is the end of The Sopranos.

31:57.400 --> 32:01.800
And as with Game of Thrones twelve years later, people lost their shit.

32:01.800 --> 32:09.920
It made a lot of people angry.

32:09.920 --> 32:13.080
Creator David Chase knew how it was going to end for a while, saying,

32:13.080 --> 32:15.800
"...no one was trying to be audacious, honest to God.

32:15.800 --> 32:17.440
We did what we thought we had to do.

32:17.440 --> 32:21.640
No one was trying to blow people's minds or thinking, wow, this will piss them off.

32:21.640 --> 32:27.120
People get the impression that you're trying to fuck with them, and it's not true."

32:27.120 --> 32:29.160
I actually really like the ending of The Sopranos.

32:29.160 --> 32:31.600
I think it works both thematically and dramatically.

32:31.600 --> 32:36.000
Tony might have died in the moment it cut to black, or he may just have had a boring dinner.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.560
But as long as he's stuck in that life, he'll always be living on a knife's edge.

32:39.560 --> 32:42.040
Would I have done anything differently with the ending of the show?

32:46.480 --> 32:47.240
I don't think so.

32:47.240 --> 32:49.880
But The Sopranos set the stage for memorable endings.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.360
And another lesson was learned here.

32:51.360 --> 32:53.000
The wrong one, in my opinion.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.360
A memorable, even controversial ending...

32:55.360 --> 32:57.240
Don't stop!

32:57.240 --> 32:59.560
...is the same as a good one.

33:02.040 --> 33:04.120
Fan service also merits discussion here,

33:04.120 --> 33:08.520
because fans in recent years have had a much more active role in shaping media.

33:08.520 --> 33:13.360
Typically, the longer a thing goes, the more fan service gets jammed in to keep people engaged.

33:13.360 --> 33:15.400
And not all fan service is bad.

33:15.400 --> 33:20.000
One of the positive changes from the books is the fight between Brienne and the Hound in season four.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.440
You're the wrong one to watch over her.

33:22.440 --> 33:24.600
And that's what you're doing?

33:24.600 --> 33:27.200
Watching over her?

33:27.200 --> 33:28.880
Aye, that's what I'm doing.

33:28.880 --> 33:33.680
In the book, the Hound goes down from blood poisoning from a stupid wound he gets in a bar fight.

33:33.680 --> 33:40.680
But in the show, you have two characters you both care about fighting over Arya to the death?

33:40.680 --> 33:42.320
Like, I want them both to beâ€”

33:42.320 --> 33:44.720
No! No, my children!

33:44.720 --> 33:46.160
I'm screaming!

33:46.160 --> 33:48.480
So...

33:48.480 --> 33:49.680
Cleganebowl.

33:49.680 --> 33:51.320
Let the dogs out!

33:51.320 --> 33:53.080
Hoot! Hoot! Hoot! Hoot!

33:53.080 --> 33:54.640
I'm not a knight.

33:58.880 --> 34:01.680
You're a talker.

34:01.680 --> 34:05.080
Listening to talkers...

34:05.080 --> 34:06.280
makes me thirsty.

34:06.280 --> 34:09.280
Thirsty. Thirsty.

34:09.280 --> 34:14.000
At best, Cleganebowl is slash was a fan theory that combined both book and TV lore,

34:14.000 --> 34:15.400
a lot of internet meme culture,

34:15.400 --> 34:20.680
and the burning desire to see this giant man kick the ass of this other giant man

34:20.680 --> 34:25.280
in a revenge fight so epic that it would rock the foundations of Westeros itself.

34:25.280 --> 34:28.000
You know who's coming for you.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.200
You've always known.

34:29.200 --> 34:31.600
Get hyped.

34:31.600 --> 34:34.800
See, the Hound looks the way he does and is afraid of fire

34:34.800 --> 34:40.200
because his brother, the Mountain, shoved his face into a fire when they were kids.

34:40.200 --> 34:44.200
And ever since then, he's wanted him some revenge for that and some other things.

34:44.200 --> 34:48.800
All about that revenge. Just really, really hates that mountain that rides. Hates him.

34:48.800 --> 34:51.800
My brother's alive.

34:51.800 --> 34:53.400
Hates him, the Hound.

34:53.600 --> 34:56.400
We come across my brother.

34:56.400 --> 34:59.400
Maybe we can both cross a name off a list.

34:59.400 --> 35:00.400
Wants revenge.

35:00.400 --> 35:04.000
And while, yeah, the meme itself was a lot of fun and we got hype and everything,

35:04.000 --> 35:08.400
as a dramatic plot point, it's, um, it's really fucking dumb.

35:08.400 --> 35:12.200
One, not only is the Mountain functionally dead by this point, like,

35:12.200 --> 35:17.800
Oberyn Martell killed him and what we have now is basically just a mindless zombie

35:17.800 --> 35:20.200
that does whatever Cersei says.

35:20.200 --> 35:24.600
But two, the books make it pretty clear that Sandor is finally at peace with himself

35:24.600 --> 35:26.200
and his need for revenge.

35:26.200 --> 35:30.200
If the gods are real, why haven't they punished me?

35:30.200 --> 35:31.800
They have.

35:31.800 --> 35:36.400
Revenge being mistaken for justice is a big thing in the books and we will get to that later.

35:36.400 --> 35:40.400
His arc wasn't about getting revenge, it was about moving past that.

35:40.400 --> 35:42.200
In the show, I...

35:42.200 --> 35:45.800
You can still help a lot more than you've harmed Clegane.

35:45.800 --> 35:47.000
It's not too late for you.

35:47.000 --> 35:51.200
Never too late to stop robbing people, to stop killing people.

35:51.200 --> 35:53.000
Start helping people.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.800
Never too late to come back.

35:57.400 --> 36:00.200
You know who's coming for you.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.400
You've always known.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.400
Who is forcing you to do this?

36:08.400 --> 36:09.400
He's, he's like a zombie.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.600
He's dead, he's a shell, he's a zombie.

36:11.600 --> 36:15.400
Cleganebowl happens while Daenerys is doing some war crimes

36:15.600 --> 36:17.800
and King's Landing is burning.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.600
They're fighting for nothing.

36:19.600 --> 36:22.000
The Hound has long since moved on.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.800
This has not been his motivation for a while.

36:24.800 --> 36:28.000
Gregor is an empty zombie shell and the world is ending outside

36:28.000 --> 36:30.800
and everyone here is about to die anyway, so who cares?

36:30.800 --> 36:33.000
The Hound isn't even fighting for Arya.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.600
He's not protecting anyone.

36:34.600 --> 36:35.400
And look at me.

36:35.400 --> 36:36.400
Look at me!

36:39.200 --> 36:40.400
You want to be like me?

36:40.400 --> 36:42.600
You two rode a thousand miles on horseback together

36:42.600 --> 36:45.000
and you only now decide to have this conversation?

36:45.000 --> 36:47.200
Go home, girl.

36:47.200 --> 36:49.000
The fire will get her.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.400
The one who lit the thrackey.

36:52.800 --> 36:56.000
Also, Arya murdered all of House Lord Life Alert

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
and baked them into pies and fed them to their father.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.600
I'm pretty sure her revenge quest is shot the moon

37:02.600 --> 37:05.600
in comparison to yours, sir.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.000
I'm not sir.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.600
So Cleganebowl had no reason to exist

37:09.600 --> 37:13.800
other than the concept becoming memetic on a god-tier level.

37:15.200 --> 37:17.800
Yeah, that's you.

37:20.200 --> 37:21.800
That's what you've always been.

37:21.800 --> 37:25.800
How do you like me now?

37:25.800 --> 37:27.400
Fucking die!

37:27.400 --> 37:29.800
Fan service also comes with the double-edged sword

37:29.800 --> 37:32.200
of, in this case, the show's self-imposed burden

37:32.200 --> 37:34.600
of needing to be smarter than the fans,

37:34.600 --> 37:36.800
which becomes harder and harder in a world

37:36.800 --> 37:40.400
with massive subreddits dedicated to theorizing about the thing

37:40.400 --> 37:41.800
in incredible detail.

37:41.800 --> 37:44.200
So somewhere along the line, subverting expectations

37:44.200 --> 37:47.600
stopped being a thing one did because it benefited the story

37:47.600 --> 37:51.400
and more a thing one did because, well...

37:51.400 --> 37:53.200
We hoped to kind of avoid the expected.

37:53.200 --> 37:54.800
She seemed like the best candidate

37:54.800 --> 37:57.800
provided we weren't thinking about her in that moment.

37:57.800 --> 38:00.000
This isn't necessarily unique to Game of Thrones.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.400
Westworld creator and showrunner Jonathan Nolan

38:02.400 --> 38:05.000
admitted that an episode from season two had to be rewritten

38:05.000 --> 38:07.800
after Reddit fans guessed a major upcoming twist.

38:07.800 --> 38:10.400
Reddit has already figured out the third episode twist,

38:10.400 --> 38:12.600
said Nolan, so we're changing that right now.

38:12.800 --> 38:15.400
It's annoying sometimes when people guess the twists

38:15.400 --> 38:16.600
and then blog about it.

38:16.600 --> 38:20.400
You can't complain when people are that engaged, he added.

38:20.400 --> 38:23.800
It's very gratifying, but stop doing it, please.

38:23.800 --> 38:26.600
I can't help but think that fans should be allowed

38:26.600 --> 38:29.600
to, like, gather in groups online and theorize

38:29.600 --> 38:32.600
and have fun without networks, like, watching in

38:32.600 --> 38:35.400
and going, oh no, they figured us out.

38:35.400 --> 38:38.200
We better go change the show

38:38.200 --> 38:42.000
because we only exist to outsmart Reddit.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.200
Like, you don't have to be unexpected

38:45.200 --> 38:48.000
for the sake of being unexpected,

38:48.000 --> 38:50.800
but when your show is kind of known for that...

38:50.800 --> 38:52.600
We hope to kind of avoid the expected.

38:52.600 --> 38:54.400
These people have guessed the secret

38:54.400 --> 38:56.600
that I'm going to reveal in book six.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.200
People have already guessed that here

38:58.200 --> 38:59.800
and book two is just out.

38:59.800 --> 39:01.200
You really have two choices there.

39:01.200 --> 39:03.600
You can ignore it and proceed with your plan,

39:03.600 --> 39:06.600
despite the fact that some people know where you're going,

39:06.600 --> 39:08.800
or you can get all panicky and say,

39:08.800 --> 39:10.200
oh my God, they figured it out.

39:10.200 --> 39:11.200
I can't let that be.

39:11.200 --> 39:12.200
I'll have to change it.

39:12.200 --> 39:14.200
I'll have to go in a different direction.

39:14.200 --> 39:16.400
And I think some writers do that,

39:16.400 --> 39:18.600
and I think that's always a mistake.

39:18.600 --> 39:20.200
You know, if you've planned your book

39:20.200 --> 39:22.200
that the butler did it,

39:22.200 --> 39:23.600
and then you read on the internet

39:23.600 --> 39:26.000
someone has figured out that the butler did it,

39:26.000 --> 39:27.800
and you suddenly change in midstream

39:27.800 --> 39:29.800
and it was the chambermaid who did it,

39:29.800 --> 39:31.800
then you screw up the whole book.

39:31.800 --> 39:34.200
So I'm not saying that David Benioff and D.B. Weiss

39:34.200 --> 39:36.000
were writing the show with the intention

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
of both indulging in fan service

39:38.000 --> 39:40.600
while also avoiding correct fan theories.

39:40.600 --> 39:43.400
I'm just saying this culture inevitably influences

39:43.400 --> 39:45.800
and infiltrates the writing of a show

39:45.800 --> 39:47.600
that was already handicapping itself

39:47.600 --> 39:50.000
by limiting its runtime for...

39:50.000 --> 39:51.200
no reason,

39:51.200 --> 39:53.800
except that you're really over the show

39:53.800 --> 39:55.200
that made you famous,

39:55.200 --> 39:58.000
and you got a Star War you need to go ruin.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
I mean, make.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.200
Why is it ending?

40:01.200 --> 40:02.200
Uh, I don't know.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.200
Ask Dave and Dan when they come through.

40:04.200 --> 40:07.800
We could have gone to 11, 12, 13 seasons,

40:07.800 --> 40:09.200
but, uh, they...

40:09.200 --> 40:10.400
I guess they wanted a life.

40:10.400 --> 40:12.800
The journalist who reported that quote from Benioff

40:12.800 --> 40:16.000
diplomatically described his reaction to it as

40:16.000 --> 40:17.400
frustrated.

40:17.400 --> 40:19.600
In hindsight, that's a bit of an understatement,

40:19.600 --> 40:22.600
seeing as any thematic coherence in the series fell apart

40:22.600 --> 40:24.800
after Martin stopped being actively involved

40:24.800 --> 40:26.400
in the production after...

40:26.400 --> 40:27.400
wouldn't you know?

40:27.400 --> 40:28.600
Season four.

40:28.600 --> 40:29.400
What are the odds?

40:29.400 --> 40:31.600
But to me, it betrays a certain lack of curiosity

40:31.600 --> 40:33.400
on the part of Benioff and Weiss,

40:33.400 --> 40:35.000
and it makes me wonder

40:35.000 --> 40:38.200
why are they even dedicating their lives to storytelling

40:38.200 --> 40:41.000
if they are so uninterested in themes?

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Especially given that they adapted a book

40:43.000 --> 40:44.600
that was so heavy with them.

40:44.600 --> 40:46.400
What unites people?

40:46.400 --> 40:47.400
Armies?

40:49.400 --> 40:50.400
Gold?

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
Stories.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.400
Yeah, so this series functionally ends with

41:03.400 --> 41:04.800
these two chuckle fucks like

41:04.800 --> 41:07.600
fetishizing storytellers as the most important people

41:07.600 --> 41:08.800
to ever exist.

41:08.800 --> 41:12.000
But yeah, themes are for 8th grade book reports.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.400
We want to avoid the expected

41:14.400 --> 41:16.600
because that means it's bad, okay?

41:16.600 --> 41:18.200
And who has a better story

41:19.600 --> 41:21.200
than Bran the Broken?

41:24.400 --> 41:25.400
So you might be asking,

41:25.400 --> 41:28.800
did you really just spend 45 minutes whinging?

41:28.800 --> 41:30.200
I'm not whinging!

41:30.200 --> 41:33.000
Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something.

41:33.000 --> 41:33.800
That's whinging.

41:33.800 --> 41:36.800
And you didn't even get into any specifics?

41:37.000 --> 41:37.600
Yep.

41:37.600 --> 41:38.600
Uh, yeah.

41:38.600 --> 41:41.400
We got about 10,000 words worth of our whinging.

41:41.400 --> 41:42.200
That's whinging.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.400
In our Google Doc before we realized that

41:44.400 --> 41:46.000
this was, this is gonna be two-parter.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.400
Yep, it's two-parter.

41:47.400 --> 41:48.200
Sorry.

41:49.600 --> 41:52.000
And this part is the sponsored part.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.400
Are you interested in thematic coherence?

41:54.400 --> 41:56.800
Do you have a book report you need to write?

41:56.800 --> 41:58.400
Are you in the 8th grade?

41:58.400 --> 42:01.400
Don't have time to read A Song of Ice and Fire?

42:01.400 --> 42:04.000
Well, why not listen to it using Audible?

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Audible members now get more than ever before.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.600
Members choose three titles every month,

42:07.600 --> 42:10.000
one audiobook plus two Audible originals

42:10.000 --> 42:11.600
that you can't hear anywhere else.

42:11.600 --> 42:13.600
Members also have unlimited access to more than

42:13.600 --> 42:16.800
a hundred audio-guided fitness and meditation programs.

42:16.800 --> 42:17.800
I love those.

42:17.800 --> 42:18.800
And you might be like,

42:18.800 --> 42:22.000
Game of Thrones is 33 hours long!

42:22.000 --> 42:23.400
And that's a lot.

42:23.400 --> 42:26.000
To which I say, the first book I recommended for Audible

42:26.000 --> 42:29.400
was Disney War, and that sucker is three hours longer.

42:29.400 --> 42:32.200
And it's also 33% shorter if you listen to it

42:32.200 --> 42:34.200
at 1.5x speed like I do.

42:34.200 --> 42:36.000
Right now, I'm listening to the Hugo nominees

42:36.000 --> 42:37.400
for Best Novel.

42:37.400 --> 42:40.400
If you didn't hear, Angelina and I are actually

42:40.400 --> 42:44.600
nominated for a Hugo this year for our Hobbit duology.

42:44.600 --> 42:47.400
Hey, I might get to meet George R. R. Martin

42:47.400 --> 42:50.000
at his loser's party.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.400
Oh, no.

42:52.400 --> 42:54.400
I'm going to let best-selling author John Green

42:54.400 --> 42:57.000
deliver the URL information for how you could start

42:57.000 --> 42:58.400

42:58.400 --> 42:59.800

42:59.800 --> 43:02.200

43:23.200 --> 43:25.600

43:25.600 --> 43:27.800
Who let the dogs out?

43:27.800 --> 43:29.800
Who let the dogs out?

43:29.800 --> 43:31.600
Who let the dogs out?

43:33.200 --> 43:34.600
I'm not a knight.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
You're a talker.

43:41.800 --> 43:43.200
Listening to talkers

43:45.200 --> 43:46.400
makes me thirsty.

43:46.400 --> 43:47.000
Thirsty.

43:47.000 --> 43:47.800
Thirsty.

43:54.600 --> 43:55.200
Thirsty.

43:55.200 --> 43:55.800
Thirsty.

43:59.800 --> 44:01.600
You're a talker.
