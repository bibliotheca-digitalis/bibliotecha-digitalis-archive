1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,720
So, the internet has lost its mind.

2
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:31,160
I include myself in that description.

3
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,920
I cannot open my YouTube homepage without a flood of angry Game of Thrones hot takes

4
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:43,760
and here I am, a month late to the conversation, just adding to that deluge and I'm sorry.

5
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:53,040
But you know, sometimes you've got some feelings and you just, you just gotta monetize them.

6
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,280
How did this cultural landmark, one of the most popular television shows in history,

7
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,680
critical darling and commercial success, a show that unequivocally changed the way television

8
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:13,400
was made, end as such a trash fire?

9
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,440
It's not like there was a change in the creative heads.

10
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,280
The showrunners were always the same, cast was almost uniformly the same.

11
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,560
So like, what the hell?

12
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,560
So this is yet another autopsy on what I think the hell happened.

13
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,880
And for the most part, I'm going to keep this to a discussion of the TV show.

14
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,720
We could get into discussions of author intentionality and adaptation, but I'm going to stop you

15
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,760
right there because I don't care.

16
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,160
This is an adaptation, therefore every creative decision should stand on its own, regardless

17
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,360
of whether it was in the books or not, or how you think George R.R. Martin is going

18
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,840
to go with it, whatever.

19
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,800
Because the books aren't done yet.

20
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,800
The show is.

21
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,440
So what you're whinging about?

22
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,440
I'm not whinging.

23
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,200
Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something.

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,800
That's whinging.

25
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,000
The most common talking point in the wake of the finale of Game of Thrones is that the

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,520
writing was… bad.

27
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,720
So with a popular thing always comes controversy, and Game of Thrones was no exception.

28
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,280
From day one we had hot takes about its portrayal of gender, about its portrayal of race, sexual

29
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,880
violence, exploitation, you name it.

30
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,680
Your mileage may vary on how much you're willing to put up with.

31
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:36,400
I was willing to roll with the problematic elements, not ignore them, but accept them.

32
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,840
But the critique of sexism and racism in media is not, not relevant to the discussion

33
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,280
of bad writing.

34
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,480
When you default to stereotyping, you're being lazy and thoughtless, which generally

35
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,560
makes for bad, or at least uninteresting, writing.

36
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,920
Dwarves have mad eyes.

37
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,440
For more on that, see the Bride episode.

38
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,000
Fairy lives don't matter today.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,080
But at the same time, no piece of media is ever going to be ideologically pure, and it's

40
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,440
unrealistic to expect that.

41
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,720
Critics and fans alike have been discussing the problematic elements of Game of Thrones

42
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,600
since the day it debuted.

43
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,520
For some, they wore too much, and these people stopped watching.

44
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,800
I know a lot of these people.

45
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:21,160
For others, people like me, they digested it, yep, Sansa's getting raped and Theon

46
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:31,240
has to watch, but we accepted it and continued to watch because hey, surely this is leading

47
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,320
up to something riveting.

48
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,320
Or at least poignant.

49
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:43,320
It's not like critique of Game of Thrones is anything new, but it's different now.

50
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:53,560
Before it was about, like, how the thing is problematic, or when is it okay to have a

51
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,180
rape scene.

52
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:00,640
Now the discussion is more about, like, structure and planting and payoff and character development

53
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,920
and screenwriting and audience expectations and subverting expectations.

54
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,800
Sir Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of

55
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Coin.

56
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,320
But there's more to it than that.

57
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,000
In fan culture in general, especially for a long-running, beloved series like Game of

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,040
Thrones, we may eventually run into the...

59
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,600
Which might make you defend a thing way longer than you should have.

60
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,000
After all, you've watched and re-watched all of the seasons multiple times, you have

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,960
a dedicated twitter account just for live-tweeting Game of Thrones.

62
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,200
Yeah, okay, everyone can fast-travel all of a sudden when distance was a huge tactical

63
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,920
consideration in early seasons, but whatever, it's fine.

64
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,020
I'm fine, I'm sure this is because the story needs to head somewhere important.

65
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:55,640
Season 7 wasn't bad, they were just building up to something cool, give them a chance.

66
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:04,600
What I hear really often, probably even more often than I don't watch the show, is I stopped

67
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,680
watching the show, usually around season 5 when it really started to go off the rails.

68
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,600
But either way, don't worry, we are going to do a quick recap for the benefit of the

69
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:20,520
people who stopped watching the show, who never watched the show, and probably the people

70
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,400
who everyone needs a quick recap anyway.

71
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:29,400
And by quick, I mean about half the runtime of this video.

72
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,880
And I'm also about to steal a lot of jokes from Gay of Thrones, so sorry Jonathan Van

73
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,200
Ness, you're just too difficult not to steal from.

74
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,200
Strap in!

75
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,080
Season 1, basically a murder mystery surrounding the line of succession for the Iron Throne

76
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,560
after the last Hand of the King dies.

77
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,200
Hand of the King is basically the Grand Vizier, let's say.

78
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,000
She says Jon Arryn was murdered.

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,600
Episode 1 ends with a child witnessing some incest, and Prince Charming from Shrek 2,

80
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,840
aka Brother Dee, pushing the child out of a window, presumably to kill him, but he fails.

81
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,760
The King asks Sean Bean to be the new Hand of the King after the old one dies mysteriously,

82
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,360
so he goes to King's Landing with his two daughters.

83
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,160
He engages daughter Sansa to the evil Prince, she's thrilled.

84
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,620
But eventually Sean Bean discovers that the Prince is the incest bastard of Lena Headey

85
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:34,740
and Brother Dee, and not the legitimate son of the King, Bobby B.

86
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,140
But Bobby B dies, Sean Bean gets beheaded, and a big ol' war begins.

87
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:43,340
Sean Bean's people fighting for independence, and everyone else fighting for the throne.

88
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:48,460
And also Lord Life Alert over here is like, hey, I'm in the war too, but nobody cares.

89
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,780
Daughter Sansa becomes a captive, other daughter Arya escaped, and is angry.

90
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:58,380
Meanwhile, across the sea, the deposed King's daughter Daenerys, um, gets married off to

91
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,980
this guy and raped.

92
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:06,860
But then her husband learns to respect her, and it's fine, but oh no, he's dead.

93
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,780
But then she gets some dragons, and up north Jon Snow discovers some ice zombies.

94
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:17,100
And two, big ol' war for succession, Bobby B has two brothers, plus inbred bastard King,

95
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:22,500
plus Sean Bean's son, and also Lord of the no one cares islands is like, hey, I'm in

96
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,420
the war too, but nobody cares.

97
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:29,140
Ending in a big battle led by Peter Dinklage, evil inbred bastard King side wins, but Charles

98
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,540
Dance is the real power behind the throne, and also the best character in television

99
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,100
history, do not at me, he just is.

100
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,860
Meanwhile, Sean Bean's people are winning the war for independence, and Sean Bean Jr.

101
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:43,740
is supposed to marry Lord Lifelord's daughter, but then he marries Una Chaplin instead, fun

102
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,020
fact, that's Charlie Chaplin's great-granddaughter.

103
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,060
Up north, more zombies.

104
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,860
Season three, no one is grateful to Peter Dinklage for his role in the big battle, aw,

105
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,860
well he gets to be secretary of the treasury anyway, Arya's still angry, Sansa is no longer

106
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:02,060
evil inbred bastard King's fiance, Natalie Dormer is, Arya is kidnapped by this guy he's

107
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,440
called the Hound, don't worry, he's great, Brother Dee had a genuinely wonderful redemption

108
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:14,560
arc with Captain Phasma, seriously, it's some of the best television in all of television.

109
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,040
Sean Bean Jr.'s campaign is no longer going so well, they plan to wed a different Lord

110
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,560
to Lord Lifelord's daughter that Sean Bean Jr. was supposed to marry, but instead the

111
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,480
wedding ends in a massacre and the whole family is slaughtered, this is the infamous Red Wedding,

112
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,200
the war for northern independence is over.

113
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,580
Across the sea, Daenerys has been using those dragons to liberate a bunch of slaves, season

114
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,300
ends with her big white savior moment, season four, evil inbred bastard King is poisoned

115
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,540
at his own wedding, Peter Dinklage is framed for it, Sansa escapes to the north with the

116
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,900
help of totally trustworthy, you know what, I'm just going to steal another thing from

117
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:54,700
Gay of Thrones vintage Alan Cumming, doe-eyed inbred bastard King is now king, Natalie Dormer

118
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:59,260
is engaged to him, after a rigged trial, Tyrion demands a trial by combat, which goes well

119
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:03,520
for him until it doesn't, his brother Dee sneaks him out of the city, but not before

120
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:16,160
he murders Charles Dance, and also his girlfriend, but don't worry, he's still totally sympathetic.

121
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,840
Arya's travel companion the Hound loses in battle to Captain Phasma, she escapes him

122
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,340
and decides to leave the country to go to assassin school, up north there's a battle

123
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:28,260
between these people, who are trying to escape the ice zombies, and the border patrol Jon

124
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:33,220
Snow is a part of, his love interest dies, Daenerys conquers another slave city and decides

125
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,700
to rule it instead of coming to Westeros, child who was pushed out of the window in

126
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:43,260
season 1, he's like learning omniscient mind powers from Max von Saito.

127
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,500
Season 5 Tyrion with the help of Lord Doctor Evil is

128
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,580
running around Essos trying to find Daenerys, Cersei tries to exploit rising religious extremism

129
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,660
in the capital, which oops really backfires on her once they find out about all those

130
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:00,380
inbred bastard kings, there's a really dumb subplot involving this guy's people that

131
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:09,340
gets dropped the following season, it's awful, Bobby B's brother, the guy with the

132
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:14,220
strongest claim to the throne, burns his daughter to death, because he thinks that will give

133
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:24,780
him some fire magic to win a battle, it doesn't, Arya goes to ninja school, decides it isn't

134
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:29,420
for her and leaves, Daenerys is bad at ruling a city whose culture she does not understand,

135
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:34,180
her dragons are unruly, she's bad at everything, eventually there's a pro-slave rebellion,

136
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:38,460
she almost gets killed, but don't worry her main dragon saves her, his name is Drogon,

137
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,460
Jon Snow tries to help the free folk they were battling in the previous season because

138
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:47,700
it turns out those ice zombies are raising an army of regular zombies, and the more dead

139
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,740
bodies they have the bigger their army gets, his border patrol brothers stab him to death

140
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:58,060
because they don't like that he's helping the foreigners, he's dead, Sansa.

141
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:06,020
You've known Sansa since she was a girl, now watch her become a woman.

142
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:13,660
So uh, here is where we pretty much completely run out of books to adapt.

143
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,900
Season 6!

144
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,860
Jon Snow gets resurrected by the woman who talked Bobby B's brother into burning his

145
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:24,100
daughter alive, Daenerys is captured by the people she married into in season 1 and is

146
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:29,740
forced into captivity with the other Kull widows, but manages to wow them all by murdering

147
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:35,620
all of their kings with fire, but you know, she herself is immune to being set on fire,

148
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,460
which means she's the Kull now because that's how the society works so she reunites with

149
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:45,740
her dragons and manages to do one-two punch of liberating Meereen from the pro-slave rebellion.

150
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,740
Lord of the No One Cares Island gets thrown off a bridge by Hot Topic Pirate, aka the

151
00:11:50,740 --> 00:12:03,460
worst character in the show, or possibly any show, Arya murders the entire house of Lord

152
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:09,100
Life Alert, and then feeds them to him, and then kills Lord Life Alert, Tyrion becomes

153
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,460
Hand of the Queen for some goddamn reason, I don't know, probably because he's played

154
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:17,300
by Peter Dinklage, then it's off to Westeros for Dany and her entourage, with the help

155
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,260
of Lord No One Cares Island's daughter and the Iron Fleet, which I haven't mentioned

156
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:27,300
yet, but they're about to get real frustrating, Sansa escapes and reunites with Jon Snow,

157
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:40,860
they reclaim Winterfell for the Starks, and feed to his dogs, it is an empowering feminist

158
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,860
moment.

159
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,660
Oh, and Cersei blows up the Vatican, wipes out the religious extremists and her adversaries

160
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:51,100
in the aristocracy, and parks herself at the balcony drinking wine, where she will stay

161
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,540
for the next two seasons.

162
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,060
But not before her last child kills himself.

163
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,060
SEASON SEVEN!

164
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,340
Okay, it's about to get really dumb.

165
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,220
It's a pretty song, I've never heard it before.

166
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,900
It's a new one.

167
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,900
Whee!

168
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,540
Daenerys and Jon Snow have a meet-cute.

169
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,900
I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you.

170
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:14,700
In the time since he's met me, he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow, and

171
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,500
now he's calling me a child.

172
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,060
I believe he's calling all of his children.

173
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,060
Figure of speech.

174
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:28,660
But they spend most of the season faffing around, whether Jon Snow will bend the knee,

175
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:33,060
on behalf of the North, after he helps Dany take the throne, debate about whether or not

176
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,540
to fight the White Walkers or go after Cersei first.

177
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:41,140
Daenerys battles the Lannisters a bit, Jon Snow and Daenerys f**k.

178
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,980
And then, okay, this is where it gets really dumb.

179
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:51,020
Alright, so everyone is like, hey, the big existential threat is the ice zombies.

180
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:56,100
How do we convince Cersei to stop fighting us so we can deal with the existential zombie

181
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,100
threat?

182
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,100
I know!

183
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:03,460
Let's send the Magnificent Seven north of the Wall to get a sample zombie.

184
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:09,420
So they do that, and it is the dumbest thing, but you, like me, are willing to give these

185
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,900
showrunners the benefit of the doubt, like, oh boy, you know, they're just doing this

186
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,300
dumb thing to get to the good stuff.

187
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:24,580
So they get stuck, and Bobby B's bastard son has to go do chariots of fire and send a note

188
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:31,460
to Daenerys to please come save us, which she does, risking her life to do so, but loses

189
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,580
a goddamn dragon in the process.

190
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,780
But whatever, she saves their asses.

191
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,980
And it is here, only after she risked her life and lost a goddamn dragon, that Jon is

192
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:47,620
like, okay, I will bend the knee, and Daenerys is like, okay, well, I already ate some humble

193
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:52,140
pie to save you, so I hope I am worthy of this, because I know this is a big deal, not

194
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,980
only for you, but, you know, for humanity to, you know, survive.

195
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,860
So then they fast travel to King's Landing and show Cersei the zombie, and they're like,

196
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:08,740
trust us, I know this is just one, but there's a lot of these, and Cersei's like, okay, truce,

197
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,500
and also I will send soldiers to help you fight the ice zombies.

198
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,500
But guess what?

199
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,500
She's lying!

200
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,340
You pledged to our forces to fight our coming in.

201
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,300
I say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house.

202
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,300
And it is only then that Brother Dee is like, you know, I think I've had enough of your

203
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,780
conniving and evil and blowing up St. Peter's Basilica.

204
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:33,780
So this whole stupid subplot was not only a total waste of time, but they lost their

205
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:39,780
resurrection expert and gave the Night King a goddamn dragon in the process.

206
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:44,980
Go team.

207
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,260
Season 8!

208
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:50,620
Episode 1, everyone arrives at Winterfell, Cersei fucks Hot Topic pirate, the North is

209
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,380
racist, I guess.

210
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:57,620
Episode 2, zombies are coming, oh no, a lot of dialogue, basically reads like a big send-off

211
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:03,220
to all our favorite characters.

212
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,100
This will go down in history as the last decent episode of Game of Thrones, and also a massive

213
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,020
waste of time that gets totally shat upon later.

214
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,500
Oh, it also turns out that Jon Snow is not a bastard, but is in fact the rightful heir

215
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,500
to the throne.

216
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,860
My real name is Aegon Targaryen.

217
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:25,060
And also Daenerys' nephew, Wheee.

218
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:30,500
Episode 3, the big battle, the biggest battle, which almost all of the major characters survive.

219
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,580
And it is resolved when Arya stabs the main ice zombie, the Night King, with a special

220
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:39,260
blade, and then they do the fantasy trope thing of, you know, oh you killed the main

221
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:45,860
one, the Eye of Sauron is exploded so all of the orcs are dead now.

222
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,420
So yeah.

223
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,740
So that's the end of that, I guess.

224
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,220
No more ice zombies, really.

225
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:00,140
And we still have three episodes to go, and they're all 90 minutes each, oh good.

226
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:06,020
Episode 4, I Want to Die, time to head south and conquer Cersei, only on the way Hot Topic

227
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:13,500
Pirate shoots one of those indestructible dragons out of the sky with two million to

228
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:19,300
one shots from a mile away, which the dragons did not see.

229
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,620
Also somehow they captured Daenerys' gal pal, but no one else.

230
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,260
And guess what happens to her?

231
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,260
Yep.

232
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,260
Yep.

233
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,020
Also everyone kind of wants to do some treason on Daenerys for some reason, even though she

234
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,820
has by this point done nothing wrong.

235
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:36,500
If you consider it, the best ruler might be someone who doesn't want to rule.

236
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,980
We're discussing treason.

237
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:44,780
She's like a literal war hero, but Lord Doctor Evil is like, hmm, I don't know, I was supporting

238
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:49,900
her for like half of the entire show, but I got a hunch.

239
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,100
He's temperate and measured.

240
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,340
He's a man, which makes him more appealing to the lords of Westeros.

241
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:01,780
Episode 5, Kill Me, time to invade King's Landing, but not before burning Lord Doctor

242
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,320
Evil alive, because he's doing some treason.

243
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,680
The invasion succeeds, and it is absurdly one-sided and easy.

244
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,280
Turns out it does not matter at all that Daenerys lost half her forces or two of her dragons.

245
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,640
They invade the city in like 90 seconds.

246
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,600
And Tyrion's like, okay, when they ring the bells.

247
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,600
Ringing the bells.

248
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
Ring all the bells.

249
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
Ring the bells.

250
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,600
Hear the bells ring.

251
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates.

252
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,600
I've always hated the bells.

253
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
They ring for horror.

254
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,600
A dead king, a city under siege.

255
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,600
If they're welcoming then you king.

256
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,880
I've never known bells to mean surrender.

257
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,480
If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates.

258
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,400
And then the bells ring and then Daenerys is like, no, I think, um, I'm going to go

259
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,960
do some war crimes.

260
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,400
And then like does a 9-11 times a hundred.

261
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,600
9-11 times a hundred.

262
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Jesus.

263
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
That's...

264
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,600
Yes.

265
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
9-11 times a hundred.

266
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Episode 6.

267
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
I long for death.

268
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
Triumph of the will shots all around.

269
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:16,080
Dany does her big fascism speech in scary foreign language and Nazi clothes.

270
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,520
The only non-white characters left in the show are the people who are really into it.

271
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,160
Tyrion's like, well, the madness has taken her.

272
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:33,760
We should probably put her down like Old Yeller.

273
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:43,280
And Jon Snow, who has done nothing all season but say, she's my queen, is like, no.

274
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,800
But then he goes and puts her down like Old Yeller.

275
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,640
Her one surviving dragon in a fit of rage burns not the person responsible for her murder,

276
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,960
but the symbolism.

277
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,680
And then he flies away with her corpse.

278
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:59,040
There is a trial in which the prisoner is allowed to nominate the new king, which no

279
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,760
one has discussed in the intervening months, apparently.

280
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,120
And who has a better story than Bran the Broken?

281
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,480
And yeah, the omniscient guy ends up on the throne and we get our John Hughes ending where

282
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:19,720
the Kinslayer and the Queenslayer just gets to go up north to Snowchella.

283
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,560
And all of these people whose god-queen has been murdered by this guy are like, well,

284
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,280
okay, I guess we'll agree to disagree.

285
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:32,520
And birthright monarchy is over, we have aristocratic oligarchy now instead.

286
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,080
Which is totally better.

287
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,400
The end.

288
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:44,000
So the ending was, um, it was bad.

289
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,480
It was quite bad.

290
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:52,560
But the ending was, in fairness, foreshadowed by other things being bad.

291
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,280
So it's not original of me to suggest that Game of Thrones took a sharp dive in quality

292
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,720
after season 4.

293
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,760
Some have blamed that on the show running out of source material, others have said as

294
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,040
much as the lack of interesting new characters, as all your faves were rapidly dying off,

295
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,040
which they weren't really in the books, whatever, I'm not here for that.

296
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,760
So what really changed?

297
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,600
Well, as I see it, there were two main storytelling component shifts.

298
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,920
One, that characters, let's take for instance Tyrion, who are defined by their intelligence

299
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,640
and ability to read the writing on the wall as far as Westerosi politics go,

300
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:29,080
My brother has his sword, and I have my mind, and a mind needs books like a sword needs

301
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,080
a whetstone.

302
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,920
suddenly had to take a whole bunch of stupid pills in order for the plot to get where it

303
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,400
needed to be.

304
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,240
And, number two, where in earlier seasons the plot was highly motivated by the social

305
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,880
trends of its fictional world, see the rise in religious extremism in season 5, the show

306
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,440
completely opted to ignore them in later seasons because it was simply inconvenient to the

307
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,440
plot.

308
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,720
Writer and researcher Zeynep Tufekci wrote a blog entry for Scientific American in which

309
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,800
she posited that this shift lie in the fact that the first few seasons were dominated

310
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,920
by sociologically driven storytelling, i.e. characters responding to a broad physical

311
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,560
and social institution, and that the latter seasons were driven by psychologically driven

312
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:14,280
storytelling, as in driven by the characters themselves, and therefore were more in line

313
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,440
with typical Hollywood storytelling.

314
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,680
I half agree with this.

315
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,520
The show's plot and point of view has always been extremely character driven, and always

316
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,560
extremely in line with Hollywood storytelling in that way.

317
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:29,880
The plot is driven by a few powerful people trying to figure out how best to manipulate

318
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,960
the society they lived in to their will.

319
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,960
When you play the game of thrones you win, or you die.

320
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,680
But I will agree that earlier seasons had the main characters making decisions less

321
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:45,040
based on personal whims and more in response to social trends, be it war, politics, religion,

322
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,040
and so on.

323
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,840
But really where things fall apart can be traced to one underlying main problem.

324
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:55,000
The showrunners had a destination in mind, and a set length of time to get there, meaning

325
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,240
they had to bend the character actions and world around the destination, rather than

326
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,480
allowing the characters and the world to reach the destination organically.

327
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,520
But the problem is, the characters they wrote kind of developed a life of their own, and

328
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:15,560
the characters in the show are not the same characters as the characters in the books.

329
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,300
Some see this clusterfuck as a problem of having a planned ending, although I personally

330
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,040
think you always need to have a good idea of where you're going in a series.

331
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,440
It's just that whenever you're working towards an ending, you kind of have to accept

332
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,400
that you might not get there the way you think you will, or in how long you think it will

333
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,400
take.

334
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
Right, buddy?

335
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,800
These things take time to write.

336
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,800
They're 1,500 pages long.

337
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,840
Some people can't even read them.

338
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,040
So before we really get into where we got, first let's talk about how we got here.

339
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,160
So stop me if you've heard this about Game of Thrones.

340
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,600
It's fantasy for people who don't like fantasy.

341
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,080
This was a popular selling point in the press back in the show's first few seasons, and

342
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,720
given the different landscape of the time, it's easy to see why.

343
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,920
Fantasy did well in film, television not so much.

344
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:13,280
When Game of Thrones debuted, prestige Soprano-style television that happened to also be genre

345
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:19,760
fiction was mostly, um, non-existent and or relegated to cable networks like SyFy, then

346
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,520
called the SyFy Channel.

347
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,640
It was the kind of thing that had a cult following on LiveJournal, not the kind of thing your

348
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,360
cousin Brian, who still tailgates at Penn State despite having graduated a decade ago,

349
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,960
would have any interest in discussing at the family reunion.

350
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,840
This dichotomy is, of course, complete nonsense.

351
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,000
There isn't anything appreciably non-fantasy about A Song of Ice and Fire that sets it

352
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,480
apart from the rest of the genre, but try telling cousin Brian that in 2010.

353
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,240
But only nerds appreciate that kind of nuance.

354
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,240
Lightning bolt!

355
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,240
Lightning bolt!

356
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:54,120
So, in order for a fantasy show to be worth the time and interest of non-genre fans on

357
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,040
a premium subscription channel, it can't just be regular fantasy.

358
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:05,240
With its, you know, wizards of great import and prophecies and heroes, what we're destined…

359
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,240
no.

360
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,520
It had to be hot fantasy that fucks.

361
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,160
The word-of-mouth narrative around the show quickly devolved into a message of, see how

362
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,200
Game of Thrones subverts fantasy expectations?

363
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,440
Because we've never read a fantasy book besides Lord of the Rings before?

364
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,160
See, this isn't your wide-eyed Brotherhood of Man, too-much-hugging-and-forehead-kissing

365
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,240
fantasy for nerds.

366
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:34,200
This is hardcore, violent, darkly cynical, titty-besotted fantasy.

367
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,200
Hot fantasy that fucks.

368
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,960
They're gods for Bessie.

369
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,960
And they're tits.

370
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,320
Game of Thrones also came about at the dawn of what has become to be known as the golden

371
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,160
age of television.

372
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:51,000
We could go on for a while as to the validity of this label, but for now, let's just take

373
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,680
for granted that, yeah, sure, this is the golden age of television.

374
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,680
Here we are.

375
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,680
This is it.

376
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,680
We...

377
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,560
What does that mean?

378
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:04,480
Broadly, the golden age of television is marked by a period of serialized prestige drama that

379
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,480
debatably began with The Sopranos and has now become an oversaturated market with not

380
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:15,240
only cable and premium channels, i.e. HBO and Showtime, but with streaming venues themselves

381
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:20,040
less encumbered with budgetary constraints like Amazon and Netflix, not only piggybacking

382
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,680
off of the success of premium cable, but sometimes outshining it.

383
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:28,080
We've hit a period of oversaturation that is referred to by some as peak TV.

384
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,000
And while that might lead to some truly excellent, polished, high-budget art that we've genuinely

385
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,960
never seen before, the push for networks is more to become the next big thing.

386
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,640
So when you're writing your series, novel, comic, TV, whatever, there are broadly two

387
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,440
ways you can go about it.

388
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,360
You know the ending, or you don't.

389
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,880
Breaking Bad is widely considered to have one of the best, most coherent, most satisfying

390
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,440
finales in all of prestige television.

391
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,960
According to creator Vince Gilligan,

392
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,280
it was designed to be closed-ended and not have even the possibility of going on indefinitely.

393
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,600
It's really incumbent upon us to bring it to as satisfying a conclusion as possible,

394
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,400
and the only way we'll have a chance at doing that is to know exactly when it is that

395
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,120
we're going to end, and also to have that ending not be too far off in the future.

396
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,640
On the other side of the coin, you have shows like Dexter and Lost, where the showrunners

397
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,680
had no endgame plan, and Lost is perhaps the most emblematic of the problem of a concept

398
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,120
with no endgame in mind.

399
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,880
J.J. Abrams is infamous for his mystery box approach to storytelling.

400
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,920
That presenting an audience with a tantalizing mystery, let's say about someone's mysterious

401
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,920
parentage,

402
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,040
For my family, they'll be back.

403
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,200
is a great way to keep them engaged, whether you know the solution to that mystery or not.

404
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,800
But planned finales can also create problems.

405
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,320
Box writer Emily Vanderwerf wrote about the danger of planned finales in the wake of Game

406
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,320
of Thrones.

407
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,440
She points to Breaking Bad as an example of a show that found a way to thread the needle

408
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,040
of planned finale with the organic storytelling that comes with television.

409
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,120
And after Gilligan and company meticulously plotted season 2, they more or less plotted

410
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,680
the rest of the show on the fly.

411
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,280
According to Vanderwerf, this is the paradox of TV.

412
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,840
You'd think that having a satisfying ending would require having a rock-solid plan to

413
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,680
get to that ending, but the opposite is often true, because the more you know about how

414
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,560
a story is going to play out in the macro, the more the micro just becomes a series of

415
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,200
items checked off a list.

416
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,560
Knowing the goal you are working towards is great, but only if you leave room for the

417
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,480
fact that characters and their relationships can change during the life of a show, even

418
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,380
if you totally know where the show is going.

419
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:29,120
So with Game of Thrones, that was a benefit and a handicap.

420
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,440
The showrunners knew where they were going, even if the actors didn't.

421
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,880
Jon's eyes open as well, already filling with tears.

422
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,320
For a moment neither moves, as if moving will make this real.

423
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:46,520
We see Jon with his hands still on the hilt of the dagger he just lodged in Dany's heart.

424
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:50,280
Her strength leaves her and she collapses to the marble.

425
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,960
He keeps her in his arms and she falls, and then raises his sword to strike, but something

426
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,440
is hurtling toward him out of the dark.

427
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,440
Oh, my lord.

428
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,440
Best of my men.

429
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,440
Breaker of chains and mother of dragons.

430
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,840
Our queen's nature is fire and blood.

431
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:07,160
Standing before the Iron Throne, Dany steps forward and kids plunge their knives into him.

432
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,800
He takes more punishment than Hodor took at the door, than Beric took in the grave.

433
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,360
And in broad strokes, I don't doubt that where D&D ended up was where Martin intended to go.

434
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,200
However, they create big problems in that taking shortcuts, making character changes,

435
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,800
and cutting certain characters and subplots all together, they've written a different

436
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,960
story to the one that Martin wrote.

437
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,880
Their characters are different characters than the ones Martin was writing.

438
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,120
Cersei is different, Daenerys is different, Tyrion is way different.

439
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,560
Damn you, Peter Dinklage, for just being so ding-dang-dong charismatic and handsome.

440
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,560
You're talking to a king!

441
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,560
And now I've struck a king.

442
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,560
Did my hand fall from my wrist?

443
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,800
I will remember you.

444
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,320
But we can't make him the bad guy.

445
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,440
Who cares if he strangled his lover in a jealous rage?

446
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,480
Or in self-defense, as it is in the show.

447
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,480
I guess that's what we're going with.

448
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,480
I'm sorry.

449
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,200
Yeah, see, the way this arc played out was a red flag.

450
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,840
This scene makes no sense, given how both Tyrion and Shae evolved away from their characterization

451
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,840
in the book.

452
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,840
I am yours, and you are mine.

453
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,240
While still getting their book ending.

454
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,280
So the showrunners were given a destination, but when the show they wrote and the characters

455
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:30,080
they created kind of went in directions that did not work with that predetermined destination,

456
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,840
or at least were going to have to take a very different way to get there, who cares, let's

457
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,960
do it anyway.

458
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,840
So no discussion about prestige television is complete without a talk about the Sopranos,

459
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,400
and this will spoil how The Sopranos ends, so fair warning.

460
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,840
You know, I still have people asking me, what the hell was that last episode?

461
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,080
The Sopranos begin the era of prestige television drama in earnest.

462
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,360
Like Game of Thrones, it was a massive critical darling and commercial success out of the

463
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,360
gate.

464
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,680
So, like Game of Thrones, when The Sopranos ended after six seasons, there was a lot of

465
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,720
build-up for how it would end.

466
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,920
Would one of Tony's many enemies gun him down?

467
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,000
Would he slaughter all of his enemies in some pyrrhic victory?

468
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,480
How would his relationship with Dr. Melfi play out?

469
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,400
Would he walk away from the life altogether?

470
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,520
We get answers to some of these questions.

471
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,520
Dr. Melfi cuts him off when she realizes Tony is a lost cause, and Tony does not walk away

472
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,640
from the life.

473
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,760
The final scene in the show takes place at a diner where Tony is scheduled to meet his

474
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,840
family for a regular dinner.

475
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,080
Carmella shows up.

476
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,440
His daughter has some difficulty parking.

477
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,440
Shit.

478
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:35,880
But then we notice that several of the other patrons in the diner are acting kind of suspicious

479
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,040
and giving Tony the side-eye.

480
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,080
Journey's don't-stop-believing increases in volume to the point that it's almost overwhelming.

481
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,200
There's this really dissonant, dark, comedic tone.

482
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,080
The scene is building and building in tension, and then...

483
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,280
It cuts to black.

484
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,400
And that is the end of The Sopranos.

485
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,800
And as with Game of Thrones twelve years later, people lost their shit.

486
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:09,920
It made a lot of people angry.

487
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,080
Creator David Chase knew how it was going to end for a while, saying,

488
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,800
"...no one was trying to be audacious, honest to God.

489
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,440
We did what we thought we had to do.

490
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,640
No one was trying to blow people's minds or thinking, wow, this will piss them off.

491
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:27,120
People get the impression that you're trying to fuck with them, and it's not true."

492
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,160
I actually really like the ending of The Sopranos.

493
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,600
I think it works both thematically and dramatically.

494
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,000
Tony might have died in the moment it cut to black, or he may just have had a boring dinner.

495
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,560
But as long as he's stuck in that life, he'll always be living on a knife's edge.

496
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,040
Would I have done anything differently with the ending of the show?

497
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,240
I don't think so.

498
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,880
But The Sopranos set the stage for memorable endings.

499
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,360
And another lesson was learned here.

500
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,000
The wrong one, in my opinion.

501
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,360
A memorable, even controversial ending...

502
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,240
Don't stop!

503
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,560
...is the same as a good one.

504
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,120
Fan service also merits discussion here,

505
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,520
because fans in recent years have had a much more active role in shaping media.

506
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:13,360
Typically, the longer a thing goes, the more fan service gets jammed in to keep people engaged.

507
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,400
And not all fan service is bad.

508
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:20,000
One of the positive changes from the books is the fight between Brienne and the Hound in season four.

509
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,440
You're the wrong one to watch over her.

510
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,600
And that's what you're doing?

511
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,200
Watching over her?

512
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,880
Aye, that's what I'm doing.

513
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,680
In the book, the Hound goes down from blood poisoning from a stupid wound he gets in a bar fight.

514
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:40,680
But in the show, you have two characters you both care about fighting over Arya to the death?

515
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,320
Like, I want them both to be—

516
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,720
No! No, my children!

517
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,160
I'm screaming!

518
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,480
So...

519
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,680
Cleganebowl.

520
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,320
Let the dogs out!

521
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,080
Hoot! Hoot! Hoot! Hoot!

522
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,640
I'm not a knight.

523
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,680
You're a talker.

524
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,080
Listening to talkers...

525
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,280
makes me thirsty.

526
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,280
Thirsty. Thirsty.

527
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,000
At best, Cleganebowl is slash was a fan theory that combined both book and TV lore,

528
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,400
a lot of internet meme culture,

529
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:20,680
and the burning desire to see this giant man kick the ass of this other giant man

530
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:25,280
in a revenge fight so epic that it would rock the foundations of Westeros itself.

531
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,000
You know who's coming for you.

532
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,200
You've always known.

533
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,600
Get hyped.

534
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,800
See, the Hound looks the way he does and is afraid of fire

535
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,200
because his brother, the Mountain, shoved his face into a fire when they were kids.

536
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,200
And ever since then, he's wanted him some revenge for that and some other things.

537
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,800
All about that revenge. Just really, really hates that mountain that rides. Hates him.

538
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,800
My brother's alive.

539
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,400
Hates him, the Hound.

540
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,400
We come across my brother.

541
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,400
Maybe we can both cross a name off a list.

542
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,400
Wants revenge.

543
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,000
And while, yeah, the meme itself was a lot of fun and we got hype and everything,

544
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,400
as a dramatic plot point, it's, um, it's really fucking dumb.

545
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,200
One, not only is the Mountain functionally dead by this point, like,

546
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:17,800
Oberyn Martell killed him and what we have now is basically just a mindless zombie

547
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,200
that does whatever Cersei says.

548
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,600
But two, the books make it pretty clear that Sandor is finally at peace with himself

549
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,200
and his need for revenge.

550
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,200
If the gods are real, why haven't they punished me?

551
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,800
They have.

552
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,400
Revenge being mistaken for justice is a big thing in the books and we will get to that later.

553
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,400
His arc wasn't about getting revenge, it was about moving past that.

554
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,200
In the show, I...

555
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,800
You can still help a lot more than you've harmed Clegane.

556
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,000
It's not too late for you.

557
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,200
Never too late to stop robbing people, to stop killing people.

558
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,000
Start helping people.

559
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,800
Never too late to come back.

560
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,200
You know who's coming for you.

561
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,400
You've always known.

562
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,400
Who is forcing you to do this?

563
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,400
He's, he's like a zombie.

564
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,600
He's dead, he's a shell, he's a zombie.

565
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,400
Cleganebowl happens while Daenerys is doing some war crimes

566
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,800
and King's Landing is burning.

567
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,600
They're fighting for nothing.

568
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,000
The Hound has long since moved on.

569
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,800
This has not been his motivation for a while.

570
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,000
Gregor is an empty zombie shell and the world is ending outside

571
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,800
and everyone here is about to die anyway, so who cares?

572
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,000
The Hound isn't even fighting for Arya.

573
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,600
He's not protecting anyone.

574
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,400
And look at me.

575
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,400
Look at me!

576
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,400
You want to be like me?

577
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,600
You two rode a thousand miles on horseback together

578
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,000
and you only now decide to have this conversation?

579
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,200
Go home, girl.

580
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,000
The fire will get her.

581
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,400
The one who lit the thrackey.

582
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,000
Also, Arya murdered all of House Lord Life Alert

583
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
and baked them into pies and fed them to their father.

584
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,600
I'm pretty sure her revenge quest is shot the moon

585
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,600
in comparison to yours, sir.

586
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,000
I'm not sir.

587
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,600
So Cleganebowl had no reason to exist

588
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,800
other than the concept becoming memetic on a god-tier level.

589
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,800
Yeah, that's you.

590
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,800
That's what you've always been.

591
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,800
How do you like me now?

592
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,400
Fucking die!

593
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,800
Fan service also comes with the double-edged sword

594
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,200
of, in this case, the show's self-imposed burden

595
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,600
of needing to be smarter than the fans,

596
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,800
which becomes harder and harder in a world

597
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,400
with massive subreddits dedicated to theorizing about the thing

598
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,800
in incredible detail.

599
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,200
So somewhere along the line, subverting expectations

600
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,600
stopped being a thing one did because it benefited the story

601
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,400
and more a thing one did because, well...

602
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,200
We hoped to kind of avoid the expected.

603
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,800
She seemed like the best candidate

604
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,800
provided we weren't thinking about her in that moment.

605
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,000
This isn't necessarily unique to Game of Thrones.

606
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,400
Westworld creator and showrunner Jonathan Nolan

607
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,000
admitted that an episode from season two had to be rewritten

608
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,800
after Reddit fans guessed a major upcoming twist.

609
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,400
Reddit has already figured out the third episode twist,

610
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,600
said Nolan, so we're changing that right now.

611
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,400
It's annoying sometimes when people guess the twists

612
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,600
and then blog about it.

613
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,400
You can't complain when people are that engaged, he added.

614
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,800
It's very gratifying, but stop doing it, please.

615
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,600
I can't help but think that fans should be allowed

616
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,600
to, like, gather in groups online and theorize

617
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,600
and have fun without networks, like, watching in

618
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,400
and going, oh no, they figured us out.

619
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,200
We better go change the show

620
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,000
because we only exist to outsmart Reddit.

621
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,200
Like, you don't have to be unexpected

622
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,000
for the sake of being unexpected,

623
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,800
but when your show is kind of known for that...

624
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,600
We hope to kind of avoid the expected.

625
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,400
These people have guessed the secret

626
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,600
that I'm going to reveal in book six.

627
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,200
People have already guessed that here

628
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,800
and book two is just out.

629
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,200
You really have two choices there.

630
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,600
You can ignore it and proceed with your plan,

631
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,600
despite the fact that some people know where you're going,

632
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,800
or you can get all panicky and say,

633
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,200
oh my God, they figured it out.

634
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,200
I can't let that be.

635
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,200
I'll have to change it.

636
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,200
I'll have to go in a different direction.

637
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,400
And I think some writers do that,

638
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,600
and I think that's always a mistake.

639
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,200
You know, if you've planned your book

640
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,200
that the butler did it,

641
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,600
and then you read on the internet

642
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,000
someone has figured out that the butler did it,

643
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,800
and you suddenly change in midstream

644
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,800
and it was the chambermaid who did it,

645
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,800
then you screw up the whole book.

646
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,200
So I'm not saying that David Benioff and D.B. Weiss

647
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,000
were writing the show with the intention

648
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
of both indulging in fan service

649
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,600
while also avoiding correct fan theories.

650
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,400
I'm just saying this culture inevitably influences

651
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,800
and infiltrates the writing of a show

652
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,600
that was already handicapping itself

653
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,000
by limiting its runtime for...

654
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,200
no reason,

655
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,800
except that you're really over the show

656
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,200
that made you famous,

657
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,000
and you got a Star War you need to go ruin.

658
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I mean, make.

659
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,200
Why is it ending?

660
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,200
Uh, I don't know.

661
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,200
Ask Dave and Dan when they come through.

662
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,800
We could have gone to 11, 12, 13 seasons,

663
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,200
but, uh, they...

664
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,400
I guess they wanted a life.

665
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,800
The journalist who reported that quote from Benioff

666
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,000
diplomatically described his reaction to it as

667
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,400
frustrated.

668
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,600
In hindsight, that's a bit of an understatement,

669
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,600
seeing as any thematic coherence in the series fell apart

670
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,800
after Martin stopped being actively involved

671
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,400
in the production after...

672
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,400
wouldn't you know?

673
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,600
Season four.

674
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,400
What are the odds?

675
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,600
But to me, it betrays a certain lack of curiosity

676
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,400
on the part of Benioff and Weiss,

677
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,000
and it makes me wonder

678
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,200
why are they even dedicating their lives to storytelling

679
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,000
if they are so uninterested in themes?

680
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Especially given that they adapted a book

681
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,600
that was so heavy with them.

682
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,400
What unites people?

683
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,400
Armies?

684
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,400
Gold?

685
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Stories.

686
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story.

687
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,400
Yeah, so this series functionally ends with

688
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,800
these two chuckle fucks like

689
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,600
fetishizing storytellers as the most important people

690
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,800
to ever exist.

691
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,000
But yeah, themes are for 8th grade book reports.

692
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,400
We want to avoid the expected

693
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,600
because that means it's bad, okay?

694
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,200
And who has a better story

695
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,200
than Bran the Broken?

696
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,400
So you might be asking,

697
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,800
did you really just spend 45 minutes whinging?

698
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,200
I'm not whinging!

699
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,000
Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something.

700
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,800
That's whinging.

701
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,800
And you didn't even get into any specifics?

702
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,600
Yep.

703
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,600
Uh, yeah.

704
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,400
We got about 10,000 words worth of our whinging.

705
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,200
That's whinging.

706
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,400
In our Google Doc before we realized that

707
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,000
this was, this is gonna be two-parter.

708
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,400
Yep, it's two-parter.

709
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,200
Sorry.

710
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,000
And this part is the sponsored part.

711
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,400
Are you interested in thematic coherence?

712
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,800
Do you have a book report you need to write?

713
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,400
Are you in the 8th grade?

714
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,400
Don't have time to read A Song of Ice and Fire?

715
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,000
Well, why not listen to it using Audible?

716
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Audible members now get more than ever before.

717
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,600
Members choose three titles every month,

718
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,000
one audiobook plus two Audible originals

719
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,600
that you can't hear anywhere else.

720
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,600
Members also have unlimited access to more than

721
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,800
a hundred audio-guided fitness and meditation programs.

722
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,800
I love those.

723
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,800
And you might be like,

724
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,000
Game of Thrones is 33 hours long!

725
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,400
And that's a lot.

726
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,000
To which I say, the first book I recommended for Audible

727
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,400
was Disney War, and that sucker is three hours longer.

728
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,200
And it's also 33% shorter if you listen to it

729
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,200
at 1.5x speed like I do.

730
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,000
Right now, I'm listening to the Hugo nominees

731
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,400
for Best Novel.

732
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,400
If you didn't hear, Angelina and I are actually

733
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,600
nominated for a Hugo this year for our Hobbit duology.

734
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,400
Hey, I might get to meet George R. R. Martin

735
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,000
at his loser's party.

736
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,400
Oh, no.

737
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,400
I'm going to let best-selling author John Green

738
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,000

739
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,400

I'm glad they let me keep the same URL.

749
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,800
Who let the dogs out?

750
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,800
Who let the dogs out?

751
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,600
Who let the dogs out?

752
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,600
I'm not a knight.

753
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
You're a talker.

754
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,200
Listening to talkers

755
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,400
makes me thirsty.

756
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,000
Thirsty.

757
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,800
Thirsty.

758
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,200
Thirsty.

759
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:55,800
Thirsty.

760
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,600
You're a talker.
