0	22720	So, the internet has lost its mind.
22720	31160	I include myself in that description.
31160	36920	I cannot open my YouTube homepage without a flood of angry Game of Thrones hot takes
36920	43760	and here I am, a month late to the conversation, just adding to that deluge and I'm sorry.
43760	53040	But you know, sometimes you've got some feelings and you just, you just gotta monetize them.
53040	57280	How did this cultural landmark, one of the most popular television shows in history,
57280	61680	critical darling and commercial success, a show that unequivocally changed the way television
61680	73400	was made, end as such a trash fire?
73400	75440	It's not like there was a change in the creative heads.
75440	80280	The showrunners were always the same, cast was almost uniformly the same.
80280	84560	So like, what the hell?
84560	90560	So this is yet another autopsy on what I think the hell happened.
90560	94880	And for the most part, I'm going to keep this to a discussion of the TV show.
94880	100720	We could get into discussions of author intentionality and adaptation, but I'm going to stop you
100720	102760	right there because I don't care.
102760	107160	This is an adaptation, therefore every creative decision should stand on its own, regardless
107160	111360	of whether it was in the books or not, or how you think George R.R. Martin is going
111360	113840	to go with it, whatever.
113840	115800	Because the books aren't done yet.
115800	116800	The show is.
116800	118440	So what you're whinging about?
118440	120440	I'm not whinging.
120440	123200	Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something.
123200	126800	That's whinging.
126800	130000	The most common talking point in the wake of the finale of Game of Thrones is that the
130000	135520	writing wasâ€¦ bad.
135520	139720	So with a popular thing always comes controversy, and Game of Thrones was no exception.
139720	144280	From day one we had hot takes about its portrayal of gender, about its portrayal of race, sexual
144280	146880	violence, exploitation, you name it.
146880	149680	Your mileage may vary on how much you're willing to put up with.
149680	156400	I was willing to roll with the problematic elements, not ignore them, but accept them.
156400	161840	But the critique of sexism and racism in media is not, not relevant to the discussion
161840	163280	of bad writing.
163280	166480	When you default to stereotyping, you're being lazy and thoughtless, which generally
166480	169560	makes for bad, or at least uninteresting, writing.
169560	171920	Dwarves have mad eyes.
171920	174440	For more on that, see the Bride episode.
174440	176000	Fairy lives don't matter today.
176000	180080	But at the same time, no piece of media is ever going to be ideologically pure, and it's
180080	184440	unrealistic to expect that.
184480	187720	Critics and fans alike have been discussing the problematic elements of Game of Thrones
187720	189600	since the day it debuted.
189600	193520	For some, they wore too much, and these people stopped watching.
193520	195800	I know a lot of these people.
195800	201160	For others, people like me, they digested it, yep, Sansa's getting raped and Theon
201160	211240	has to watch, but we accepted it and continued to watch because hey, surely this is leading
211240	213320	up to something riveting.
213320	215320	Or at least poignant.
215320	223320	It's not like critique of Game of Thrones is anything new, but it's different now.
223320	233560	Before it was about, like, how the thing is problematic, or when is it okay to have a
233560	235180	rape scene.
235180	240640	Now the discussion is more about, like, structure and planting and payoff and character development
240640	244920	and screenwriting and audience expectations and subverting expectations.
244920	250800	Sir Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of
250800	251800	Coin.
251800	254320	But there's more to it than that.
254320	258000	In fan culture in general, especially for a long-running, beloved series like Game of
258000	265040	Thrones, we may eventually run into the...
265040	267600	Which might make you defend a thing way longer than you should have.
267600	271000	After all, you've watched and re-watched all of the seasons multiple times, you have
271000	274960	a dedicated twitter account just for live-tweeting Game of Thrones.
274960	280200	Yeah, okay, everyone can fast-travel all of a sudden when distance was a huge tactical
280200	283920	consideration in early seasons, but whatever, it's fine.
283920	288020	I'm fine, I'm sure this is because the story needs to head somewhere important.
288020	295640	Season 7 wasn't bad, they were just building up to something cool, give them a chance.
295640	304600	What I hear really often, probably even more often than I don't watch the show, is I stopped
304600	309680	watching the show, usually around season 5 when it really started to go off the rails.
309680	314600	But either way, don't worry, we are going to do a quick recap for the benefit of the
314600	320520	people who stopped watching the show, who never watched the show, and probably the people
320520	323400	who everyone needs a quick recap anyway.
323400	329400	And by quick, I mean about half the runtime of this video.
329400	333880	And I'm also about to steal a lot of jokes from Gay of Thrones, so sorry Jonathan Van
333880	336200	Ness, you're just too difficult not to steal from.
336200	337200	Strap in!
337200	341080	Season 1, basically a murder mystery surrounding the line of succession for the Iron Throne
341080	343560	after the last Hand of the King dies.
343560	347200	Hand of the King is basically the Grand Vizier, let's say.
347200	351000	She says Jon Arryn was murdered.
351000	355600	Episode 1 ends with a child witnessing some incest, and Prince Charming from Shrek 2,
355600	360840	aka Brother Dee, pushing the child out of a window, presumably to kill him, but he fails.
360840	364760	The King asks Sean Bean to be the new Hand of the King after the old one dies mysteriously,
364760	367360	so he goes to King's Landing with his two daughters.
367360	371160	He engages daughter Sansa to the evil Prince, she's thrilled.
371160	374620	But eventually Sean Bean discovers that the Prince is the incest bastard of Lena Headey
374620	394740	and Brother Dee, and not the legitimate son of the King, Bobby B.
394740	399140	But Bobby B dies, Sean Bean gets beheaded, and a big ol' war begins.
399140	403340	Sean Bean's people fighting for independence, and everyone else fighting for the throne.
403380	408460	And also Lord Life Alert over here is like, hey, I'm in the war too, but nobody cares.
408460	412780	Daughter Sansa becomes a captive, other daughter Arya escaped, and is angry.
412780	418380	Meanwhile, across the sea, the deposed King's daughter Daenerys, um, gets married off to
418380	419980	this guy and raped.
419980	426860	But then her husband learns to respect her, and it's fine, but oh no, he's dead.
426860	430780	But then she gets some dragons, and up north Jon Snow discovers some ice zombies.
430780	437100	And two, big ol' war for succession, Bobby B has two brothers, plus inbred bastard King,
437100	442500	plus Sean Bean's son, and also Lord of the no one cares islands is like, hey, I'm in
442500	444420	the war too, but nobody cares.
444420	449140	Ending in a big battle led by Peter Dinklage, evil inbred bastard King side wins, but Charles
449140	452540	Dance is the real power behind the throne, and also the best character in television
452540	455100	history, do not at me, he just is.
455100	458860	Meanwhile, Sean Bean's people are winning the war for independence, and Sean Bean Jr.
458860	463740	is supposed to marry Lord Lifelord's daughter, but then he marries Una Chaplin instead, fun
463740	466020	fact, that's Charlie Chaplin's great-granddaughter.
466020	468060	Up north, more zombies.
468060	472860	Season three, no one is grateful to Peter Dinklage for his role in the big battle, aw,
472860	476860	well he gets to be secretary of the treasury anyway, Arya's still angry, Sansa is no longer
476860	482060	evil inbred bastard King's fiance, Natalie Dormer is, Arya is kidnapped by this guy he's
482060	486440	called the Hound, don't worry, he's great, Brother Dee had a genuinely wonderful redemption
486440	494560	arc with Captain Phasma, seriously, it's some of the best television in all of television.
494560	499040	Sean Bean Jr.'s campaign is no longer going so well, they plan to wed a different Lord
499040	503560	to Lord Lifelord's daughter that Sean Bean Jr. was supposed to marry, but instead the
503560	508480	wedding ends in a massacre and the whole family is slaughtered, this is the infamous Red Wedding,
508480	511200	the war for northern independence is over.
511200	515580	Across the sea, Daenerys has been using those dragons to liberate a bunch of slaves, season
515580	520300	ends with her big white savior moment, season four, evil inbred bastard King is poisoned
520300	524540	at his own wedding, Peter Dinklage is framed for it, Sansa escapes to the north with the
524540	528900	help of totally trustworthy, you know what, I'm just going to steal another thing from
528900	534700	Gay of Thrones vintage Alan Cumming, doe-eyed inbred bastard King is now king, Natalie Dormer
534700	539260	is engaged to him, after a rigged trial, Tyrion demands a trial by combat, which goes well
539260	543520	for him until it doesn't, his brother Dee sneaks him out of the city, but not before
543520	556160	he murders Charles Dance, and also his girlfriend, but don't worry, he's still totally sympathetic.
556160	559840	Arya's travel companion the Hound loses in battle to Captain Phasma, she escapes him
559840	563340	and decides to leave the country to go to assassin school, up north there's a battle
563340	568260	between these people, who are trying to escape the ice zombies, and the border patrol Jon
568260	573220	Snow is a part of, his love interest dies, Daenerys conquers another slave city and decides
573220	576700	to rule it instead of coming to Westeros, child who was pushed out of the window in
576700	583260	season 1, he's like learning omniscient mind powers from Max von Saito.
583260	586500	Season 5 Tyrion with the help of Lord Doctor Evil is
586500	591580	running around Essos trying to find Daenerys, Cersei tries to exploit rising religious extremism
591580	595660	in the capital, which oops really backfires on her once they find out about all those
595660	600380	inbred bastard kings, there's a really dumb subplot involving this guy's people that
600380	609340	gets dropped the following season, it's awful, Bobby B's brother, the guy with the
609340	614220	strongest claim to the throne, burns his daughter to death, because he thinks that will give
614220	624780	him some fire magic to win a battle, it doesn't, Arya goes to ninja school, decides it isn't
624780	629420	for her and leaves, Daenerys is bad at ruling a city whose culture she does not understand,
629420	634180	her dragons are unruly, she's bad at everything, eventually there's a pro-slave rebellion,
634180	638460	she almost gets killed, but don't worry her main dragon saves her, his name is Drogon,
638460	642460	Jon Snow tries to help the free folk they were battling in the previous season because
642460	647700	it turns out those ice zombies are raising an army of regular zombies, and the more dead
647700	652740	bodies they have the bigger their army gets, his border patrol brothers stab him to death
652740	658060	because they don't like that he's helping the foreigners, he's dead, Sansa.
658060	666020	You've known Sansa since she was a girl, now watch her become a woman.
666020	673660	So uh, here is where we pretty much completely run out of books to adapt.
673660	674900	Season 6!
674900	678860	Jon Snow gets resurrected by the woman who talked Bobby B's brother into burning his
678860	684100	daughter alive, Daenerys is captured by the people she married into in season 1 and is
684100	689740	forced into captivity with the other Kull widows, but manages to wow them all by murdering
689740	695620	all of their kings with fire, but you know, she herself is immune to being set on fire,
695620	699460	which means she's the Kull now because that's how the society works so she reunites with
699460	705740	her dragons and manages to do one-two punch of liberating Meereen from the pro-slave rebellion.
705740	710740	Lord of the No One Cares Island gets thrown off a bridge by Hot Topic Pirate, aka the
710740	723460	worst character in the show, or possibly any show, Arya murders the entire house of Lord
723460	729100	Life Alert, and then feeds them to him, and then kills Lord Life Alert, Tyrion becomes
729100	732460	Hand of the Queen for some goddamn reason, I don't know, probably because he's played
732460	737300	by Peter Dinklage, then it's off to Westeros for Dany and her entourage, with the help
737300	742260	of Lord No One Cares Island's daughter and the Iron Fleet, which I haven't mentioned
742260	747300	yet, but they're about to get real frustrating, Sansa escapes and reunites with Jon Snow,
747300	760860	they reclaim Winterfell for the Starks, and feed to his dogs, it is an empowering feminist
760860	761860	moment.
761860	766660	Oh, and Cersei blows up the Vatican, wipes out the religious extremists and her adversaries
766660	771100	in the aristocracy, and parks herself at the balcony drinking wine, where she will stay
771100	773540	for the next two seasons.
773540	776060	But not before her last child kills himself.
776060	777060	SEASON SEVEN!
777060	779340	Okay, it's about to get really dumb.
779340	782220	It's a pretty song, I've never heard it before.
782220	783900	It's a new one.
783900	784900	Whee!
784900	786540	Daenerys and Jon Snow have a meet-cute.
786540	789900	I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you.
789900	794700	In the time since he's met me, he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow, and
794700	796500	now he's calling me a child.
796500	801060	I believe he's calling all of his children.
801060	802060	Figure of speech.
802060	808660	But they spend most of the season faffing around, whether Jon Snow will bend the knee,
808660	813060	on behalf of the North, after he helps Dany take the throne, debate about whether or not
813060	816540	to fight the White Walkers or go after Cersei first.
816540	821140	Daenerys battles the Lannisters a bit, Jon Snow and Daenerys f**k.
821140	824980	And then, okay, this is where it gets really dumb.
824980	831020	Alright, so everyone is like, hey, the big existential threat is the ice zombies.
831020	836100	How do we convince Cersei to stop fighting us so we can deal with the existential zombie
836100	837100	threat?
837100	838100	I know!
838100	843460	Let's send the Magnificent Seven north of the Wall to get a sample zombie.
843460	849420	So they do that, and it is the dumbest thing, but you, like me, are willing to give these
849420	853900	showrunners the benefit of the doubt, like, oh boy, you know, they're just doing this
853900	856300	dumb thing to get to the good stuff.
856300	864580	So they get stuck, and Bobby B's bastard son has to go do chariots of fire and send a note
864580	871460	to Daenerys to please come save us, which she does, risking her life to do so, but loses
871460	874580	a goddamn dragon in the process.
874580	876780	But whatever, she saves their asses.
876780	880980	And it is here, only after she risked her life and lost a goddamn dragon, that Jon is
880980	887620	like, okay, I will bend the knee, and Daenerys is like, okay, well, I already ate some humble
887620	892140	pie to save you, so I hope I am worthy of this, because I know this is a big deal, not
892140	896980	only for you, but, you know, for humanity to, you know, survive.
896980	901860	So then they fast travel to King's Landing and show Cersei the zombie, and they're like,
901860	908740	trust us, I know this is just one, but there's a lot of these, and Cersei's like, okay, truce,
908740	912500	and also I will send soldiers to help you fight the ice zombies.
912500	913500	But guess what?
913500	914500	She's lying!
914500	916340	You pledged to our forces to fight our coming in.
916340	919300	I say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house.
919300	923300	And it is only then that Brother Dee is like, you know, I think I've had enough of your
923300	926780	conniving and evil and blowing up St. Peter's Basilica.
926780	933780	So this whole stupid subplot was not only a total waste of time, but they lost their
933780	939780	resurrection expert and gave the Night King a goddamn dragon in the process.
939780	944980	Go team.
944980	946260	Season 8!
946260	950620	Episode 1, everyone arrives at Winterfell, Cersei fucks Hot Topic pirate, the North is
950620	952380	racist, I guess.
952460	957620	Episode 2, zombies are coming, oh no, a lot of dialogue, basically reads like a big send-off
957620	963220	to all our favorite characters.
963220	967100	This will go down in history as the last decent episode of Game of Thrones, and also a massive
967100	970020	waste of time that gets totally shat upon later.
970020	974500	Oh, it also turns out that Jon Snow is not a bastard, but is in fact the rightful heir
974500	975500	to the throne.
975500	979860	My real name is Aegon Targaryen.
980300	985060	And also Daenerys' nephew, Wheee.
985060	990500	Episode 3, the big battle, the biggest battle, which almost all of the major characters survive.
990500	994580	And it is resolved when Arya stabs the main ice zombie, the Night King, with a special
994580	999260	blade, and then they do the fantasy trope thing of, you know, oh you killed the main
999260	1005860	one, the Eye of Sauron is exploded so all of the orcs are dead now.
1005860	1008420	So yeah.
1008420	1011740	So that's the end of that, I guess.
1011740	1015220	No more ice zombies, really.
1015220	1020140	And we still have three episodes to go, and they're all 90 minutes each, oh good.
1020140	1026020	Episode 4, I Want to Die, time to head south and conquer Cersei, only on the way Hot Topic
1026020	1033500	Pirate shoots one of those indestructible dragons out of the sky with two million to
1033500	1039300	one shots from a mile away, which the dragons did not see.
1039300	1043620	Also somehow they captured Daenerys' gal pal, but no one else.
1043620	1045260	And guess what happens to her?
1045260	1046260	Yep.
1046260	1047260	Yep.
1047260	1050020	Also everyone kind of wants to do some treason on Daenerys for some reason, even though she
1050020	1051820	has by this point done nothing wrong.
1051820	1056500	If you consider it, the best ruler might be someone who doesn't want to rule.
1056500	1058980	We're discussing treason.
1058980	1064780	She's like a literal war hero, but Lord Doctor Evil is like, hmm, I don't know, I was supporting
1064780	1069900	her for like half of the entire show, but I got a hunch.
1069900	1073100	He's temperate and measured.
1073100	1077340	He's a man, which makes him more appealing to the lords of Westeros.
1077340	1081780	Episode 5, Kill Me, time to invade King's Landing, but not before burning Lord Doctor
1081780	1085320	Evil alive, because he's doing some treason.
1085320	1089680	The invasion succeeds, and it is absurdly one-sided and easy.
1089680	1094280	Turns out it does not matter at all that Daenerys lost half her forces or two of her dragons.
1094280	1096640	They invade the city in like 90 seconds.
1096640	1099600	And Tyrion's like, okay, when they ring the bells.
1099600	1100600	Ringing the bells.
1100600	1101600	Ring all the bells.
1101600	1102600	Ring the bells.
1102600	1103600	Hear the bells ring.
1103600	1105600	If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates.
1105600	1110600	I've always hated the bells.
1110600	1111600	They ring for horror.
1111600	1114600	A dead king, a city under siege.
1114600	1118600	If they're welcoming then you king.
1118600	1120880	I've never known bells to mean surrender.
1120880	1123480	If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates.
1123480	1128400	And then the bells ring and then Daenerys is like, no, I think, um, I'm going to go
1128400	1129960	do some war crimes.
1129960	1134400	And then like does a 9-11 times a hundred.
1134400	1136600	9-11 times a hundred.
1136600	1137600	Jesus.
1137600	1138600	That's...
1138600	1139600	Yes.
1139600	1141600	9-11 times a hundred.
1141600	1142600	Episode 6.
1142600	1143600	I long for death.
1143600	1145600	Triumph of the will shots all around.
1145600	1156080	Dany does her big fascism speech in scary foreign language and Nazi clothes.
1156080	1160520	The only non-white characters left in the show are the people who are really into it.
1160520	1164160	Tyrion's like, well, the madness has taken her.
1164160	1173760	We should probably put her down like Old Yeller.
1173760	1183280	And Jon Snow, who has done nothing all season but say, she's my queen, is like, no.
1183280	1185800	But then he goes and puts her down like Old Yeller.
1185800	1190640	Her one surviving dragon in a fit of rage burns not the person responsible for her murder,
1190640	1192960	but the symbolism.
1192960	1194680	And then he flies away with her corpse.
1194680	1199040	There is a trial in which the prisoner is allowed to nominate the new king, which no
1199040	1202760	one has discussed in the intervening months, apparently.
1202760	1207120	And who has a better story than Bran the Broken?
1207120	1213480	And yeah, the omniscient guy ends up on the throne and we get our John Hughes ending where
1213480	1219720	the Kinslayer and the Queenslayer just gets to go up north to Snowchella.
1219760	1224560	And all of these people whose god-queen has been murdered by this guy are like, well,
1224560	1227280	okay, I guess we'll agree to disagree.
1227280	1232520	And birthright monarchy is over, we have aristocratic oligarchy now instead.
1232520	1235080	Which is totally better.
1235080	1239400	The end.
1239400	1244000	So the ending was, um, it was bad.
1244000	1245480	It was quite bad.
1245520	1252560	But the ending was, in fairness, foreshadowed by other things being bad.
1252560	1256280	So it's not original of me to suggest that Game of Thrones took a sharp dive in quality
1256280	1257720	after season 4.
1257720	1260760	Some have blamed that on the show running out of source material, others have said as
1260760	1265040	much as the lack of interesting new characters, as all your faves were rapidly dying off,
1265040	1268040	which they weren't really in the books, whatever, I'm not here for that.
1268040	1269760	So what really changed?
1269760	1274600	Well, as I see it, there were two main storytelling component shifts.
1274720	1279920	One, that characters, let's take for instance Tyrion, who are defined by their intelligence
1279920	1283640	and ability to read the writing on the wall as far as Westerosi politics go,
1283640	1289080	My brother has his sword, and I have my mind, and a mind needs books like a sword needs
1289080	1290080	a whetstone.
1290080	1293920	suddenly had to take a whole bunch of stupid pills in order for the plot to get where it
1293920	1295400	needed to be.
1295400	1300240	And, number two, where in earlier seasons the plot was highly motivated by the social
1300240	1304880	trends of its fictional world, see the rise in religious extremism in season 5, the show
1304880	1309440	completely opted to ignore them in later seasons because it was simply inconvenient to the
1309440	1310440	plot.
1310440	1314720	Writer and researcher Zeynep Tufekci wrote a blog entry for Scientific American in which
1314720	1318800	she posited that this shift lie in the fact that the first few seasons were dominated
1318800	1323920	by sociologically driven storytelling, i.e. characters responding to a broad physical
1323920	1328560	and social institution, and that the latter seasons were driven by psychologically driven
1328680	1334280	storytelling, as in driven by the characters themselves, and therefore were more in line
1334280	1336440	with typical Hollywood storytelling.
1336440	1338680	I half agree with this.
1338680	1342520	The show's plot and point of view has always been extremely character driven, and always
1342520	1345560	extremely in line with Hollywood storytelling in that way.
1345560	1349880	The plot is driven by a few powerful people trying to figure out how best to manipulate
1349880	1352960	the society they lived in to their will.
1352960	1355960	When you play the game of thrones you win, or you die.
1355960	1359680	But I will agree that earlier seasons had the main characters making decisions less
1359680	1365040	based on personal whims and more in response to social trends, be it war, politics, religion,
1365040	1366040	and so on.
1366040	1369840	But really where things fall apart can be traced to one underlying main problem.
1369840	1375000	The showrunners had a destination in mind, and a set length of time to get there, meaning
1375000	1379240	they had to bend the character actions and world around the destination, rather than
1379240	1384480	allowing the characters and the world to reach the destination organically.
1384480	1390520	But the problem is, the characters they wrote kind of developed a life of their own, and
1390520	1395560	the characters in the show are not the same characters as the characters in the books.
1395560	1400300	Some see this clusterfuck as a problem of having a planned ending, although I personally
1400300	1404040	think you always need to have a good idea of where you're going in a series.
1404040	1407440	It's just that whenever you're working towards an ending, you kind of have to accept
1407440	1412400	that you might not get there the way you think you will, or in how long you think it will
1412400	1413400	take.
1413800	1414800	Right, buddy?
1414800	1415800	These things take time to write.
1415800	1416800	They're 1,500 pages long.
1416800	1420840	Some people can't even read them.
1420840	1425040	So before we really get into where we got, first let's talk about how we got here.
1430680	1433160	So stop me if you've heard this about Game of Thrones.
1433160	1436600	It's fantasy for people who don't like fantasy.
1436600	1441080	This was a popular selling point in the press back in the show's first few seasons, and
1441080	1444720	given the different landscape of the time, it's easy to see why.
1444720	1447920	Fantasy did well in film, television not so much.
1447920	1453280	When Game of Thrones debuted, prestige Soprano-style television that happened to also be genre
1453280	1459760	fiction was mostly, um, non-existent and or relegated to cable networks like SyFy, then
1459760	1461520	called the SyFy Channel.
1461520	1465640	It was the kind of thing that had a cult following on LiveJournal, not the kind of thing your
1465640	1470360	cousin Brian, who still tailgates at Penn State despite having graduated a decade ago,
1470360	1472960	would have any interest in discussing at the family reunion.
1472960	1475840	This dichotomy is, of course, complete nonsense.
1475840	1480000	There isn't anything appreciably non-fantasy about A Song of Ice and Fire that sets it
1480000	1484480	apart from the rest of the genre, but try telling cousin Brian that in 2010.
1484480	1487240	But only nerds appreciate that kind of nuance.
1487240	1488240	Lightning bolt!
1488240	1489240	Lightning bolt!
1489240	1494120	So, in order for a fantasy show to be worth the time and interest of non-genre fans on
1494120	1498040	a premium subscription channel, it can't just be regular fantasy.
1498040	1505240	With its, you know, wizards of great import and prophecies and heroes, what we're destinedâ€¦
1505240	1506240	no.
1506240	1509520	It had to be hot fantasy that fucks.
1509520	1513160	The word-of-mouth narrative around the show quickly devolved into a message of, see how
1513160	1517200	Game of Thrones subverts fantasy expectations?
1517200	1521440	Because we've never read a fantasy book besides Lord of the Rings before?
1521440	1526160	See, this isn't your wide-eyed Brotherhood of Man, too-much-hugging-and-forehead-kissing
1526160	1528240	fantasy for nerds.
1528240	1534200	This is hardcore, violent, darkly cynical, titty-besotted fantasy.
1534200	1536200	Hot fantasy that fucks.
1536200	1538960	They're gods for Bessie.
1538960	1539960	And they're tits.
1539960	1544320	Game of Thrones also came about at the dawn of what has become to be known as the golden
1544320	1546160	age of television.
1546160	1551000	We could go on for a while as to the validity of this label, but for now, let's just take
1551000	1554680	for granted that, yeah, sure, this is the golden age of television.
1554680	1555680	Here we are.
1555680	1556680	This is it.
1556680	1557680	We...
1557680	1559560	What does that mean?
1559560	1564480	Broadly, the golden age of television is marked by a period of serialized prestige drama that
1564480	1569480	debatably began with The Sopranos and has now become an oversaturated market with not
1569480	1575240	only cable and premium channels, i.e. HBO and Showtime, but with streaming venues themselves
1575240	1580040	less encumbered with budgetary constraints like Amazon and Netflix, not only piggybacking
1580040	1583680	off of the success of premium cable, but sometimes outshining it.
1583680	1588080	We've hit a period of oversaturation that is referred to by some as peak TV.
1588080	1593000	And while that might lead to some truly excellent, polished, high-budget art that we've genuinely
1593000	1598960	never seen before, the push for networks is more to become the next big thing.
1598960	1603640	So when you're writing your series, novel, comic, TV, whatever, there are broadly two
1603640	1605440	ways you can go about it.
1605440	1608360	You know the ending, or you don't.
1609360	1614880	Breaking Bad is widely considered to have one of the best, most coherent, most satisfying
1614880	1617440	finales in all of prestige television.
1617440	1618960	According to creator Vince Gilligan,
1618960	1623280	it was designed to be closed-ended and not have even the possibility of going on indefinitely.
1623280	1627600	It's really incumbent upon us to bring it to as satisfying a conclusion as possible,
1627600	1631400	and the only way we'll have a chance at doing that is to know exactly when it is that
1631400	1635120	we're going to end, and also to have that ending not be too far off in the future.
1635120	1638640	On the other side of the coin, you have shows like Dexter and Lost, where the showrunners
1638640	1643680	had no endgame plan, and Lost is perhaps the most emblematic of the problem of a concept
1643680	1645120	with no endgame in mind.
1645200	1648880	J.J. Abrams is infamous for his mystery box approach to storytelling.
1648880	1653920	That presenting an audience with a tantalizing mystery, let's say about someone's mysterious
1653920	1654920	parentage,
1654920	1658040	For my family, they'll be back.
1658040	1662200	is a great way to keep them engaged, whether you know the solution to that mystery or not.
1662200	1664800	But planned finales can also create problems.
1664800	1668320	Box writer Emily Vanderwerf wrote about the danger of planned finales in the wake of Game
1668320	1669320	of Thrones.
1669320	1672440	She points to Breaking Bad as an example of a show that found a way to thread the needle
1672440	1676040	of planned finale with the organic storytelling that comes with television.
1676040	1680120	And after Gilligan and company meticulously plotted season 2, they more or less plotted
1680120	1681680	the rest of the show on the fly.
1681680	1684280	According to Vanderwerf, this is the paradox of TV.
1684280	1687840	You'd think that having a satisfying ending would require having a rock-solid plan to
1687840	1691680	get to that ending, but the opposite is often true, because the more you know about how
1691680	1695560	a story is going to play out in the macro, the more the micro just becomes a series of
1695560	1697200	items checked off a list.
1697200	1700560	Knowing the goal you are working towards is great, but only if you leave room for the
1700560	1704480	fact that characters and their relationships can change during the life of a show, even
1704480	1706380	if you totally know where the show is going.
1706380	1709120	So with Game of Thrones, that was a benefit and a handicap.
1709120	1712440	The showrunners knew where they were going, even if the actors didn't.
1712440	1715880	Jon's eyes open as well, already filling with tears.
1715880	1719320	For a moment neither moves, as if moving will make this real.
1719320	1726520	We see Jon with his hands still on the hilt of the dagger he just lodged in Dany's heart.
1726520	1730280	Her strength leaves her and she collapses to the marble.
1730280	1733960	He keeps her in his arms and she falls, and then raises his sword to strike, but something
1733960	1735440	is hurtling toward him out of the dark.
1735440	1736440	Oh, my lord.
1736440	1737440	Best of my men.
1737440	1740440	Breaker of chains and mother of dragons.
1740440	1742840	Our queen's nature is fire and blood.
1742840	1747160	Standing before the Iron Throne, Dany steps forward and kids plunge their knives into him.
1747160	1750800	He takes more punishment than Hodor took at the door, than Beric took in the grave.
1750800	1755360	And in broad strokes, I don't doubt that where D&D ended up was where Martin intended to go.
1755360	1760200	However, they create big problems in that taking shortcuts, making character changes,
1760200	1763800	and cutting certain characters and subplots all together, they've written a different
1763800	1765960	story to the one that Martin wrote.
1765960	1768880	Their characters are different characters than the ones Martin was writing.
1768880	1773120	Cersei is different, Daenerys is different, Tyrion is way different.
1773120	1777560	Damn you, Peter Dinklage, for just being so ding-dang-dong charismatic and handsome.
1777560	1779560	You're talking to a king!
1779560	1782560	And now I've struck a king.
1782560	1784560	Did my hand fall from my wrist?
1784560	1788800	I will remember you.
1788840	1790320	But we can't make him the bad guy.
1790320	1793440	Who cares if he strangled his lover in a jealous rage?
1793440	1797480	Or in self-defense, as it is in the show.
1797480	1799480	I guess that's what we're going with.
1799480	1800480	I'm sorry.
1805480	1808200	Yeah, see, the way this arc played out was a red flag.
1808200	1812840	This scene makes no sense, given how both Tyrion and Shae evolved away from their characterization
1812840	1813840	in the book.
1814840	1818840	I am yours, and you are mine.
1818840	1821240	While still getting their book ending.
1821240	1825280	So the showrunners were given a destination, but when the show they wrote and the characters
1825280	1830080	they created kind of went in directions that did not work with that predetermined destination,
1830080	1835840	or at least were going to have to take a very different way to get there, who cares, let's
1835840	1836960	do it anyway.
1836960	1840840	So no discussion about prestige television is complete without a talk about the Sopranos,
1840840	1844400	and this will spoil how The Sopranos ends, so fair warning.
1844400	1847840	You know, I still have people asking me, what the hell was that last episode?
1850840	1854080	The Sopranos begin the era of prestige television drama in earnest.
1854080	1857360	Like Game of Thrones, it was a massive critical darling and commercial success out of the
1857360	1858360	gate.
1858360	1861680	So, like Game of Thrones, when The Sopranos ended after six seasons, there was a lot of
1861680	1863720	build-up for how it would end.
1863720	1865920	Would one of Tony's many enemies gun him down?
1865920	1869000	Would he slaughter all of his enemies in some pyrrhic victory?
1869000	1871480	How would his relationship with Dr. Melfi play out?
1871480	1873400	Would he walk away from the life altogether?
1873400	1875520	We get answers to some of these questions.
1875520	1879520	Dr. Melfi cuts him off when she realizes Tony is a lost cause, and Tony does not walk away
1879520	1880640	from the life.
1880640	1883760	The final scene in the show takes place at a diner where Tony is scheduled to meet his
1883760	1885840	family for a regular dinner.
1885840	1887080	Carmella shows up.
1887080	1889440	His daughter has some difficulty parking.
1889440	1890440	Shit.
1890440	1895880	But then we notice that several of the other patrons in the diner are acting kind of suspicious
1895880	1898040	and giving Tony the side-eye.
1898080	1903080	Journey's don't-stop-believing increases in volume to the point that it's almost overwhelming.
1903080	1906200	There's this really dissonant, dark, comedic tone.
1906200	1909080	The scene is building and building in tension, and then...
1913200	1915280	It cuts to black.
1915280	1917400	And that is the end of The Sopranos.
1917400	1921800	And as with Game of Thrones twelve years later, people lost their shit.
1921800	1929920	It made a lot of people angry.
1929920	1933080	Creator David Chase knew how it was going to end for a while, saying,
1933080	1935800	"...no one was trying to be audacious, honest to God.
1935800	1937440	We did what we thought we had to do.
1937440	1941640	No one was trying to blow people's minds or thinking, wow, this will piss them off.
1941640	1947120	People get the impression that you're trying to fuck with them, and it's not true."
1947120	1949160	I actually really like the ending of The Sopranos.
1949160	1951600	I think it works both thematically and dramatically.
1951600	1956000	Tony might have died in the moment it cut to black, or he may just have had a boring dinner.
1956000	1959560	But as long as he's stuck in that life, he'll always be living on a knife's edge.
1959560	1962040	Would I have done anything differently with the ending of the show?
1966480	1967240	I don't think so.
1967240	1969880	But The Sopranos set the stage for memorable endings.
1969880	1971360	And another lesson was learned here.
1971360	1973000	The wrong one, in my opinion.
1973000	1975360	A memorable, even controversial ending...
1975360	1977240	Don't stop!
1977240	1979560	...is the same as a good one.
1982040	1984120	Fan service also merits discussion here,
1984120	1988520	because fans in recent years have had a much more active role in shaping media.
1988520	1993360	Typically, the longer a thing goes, the more fan service gets jammed in to keep people engaged.
1993360	1995400	And not all fan service is bad.
1995400	2000000	One of the positive changes from the books is the fight between Brienne and the Hound in season four.
2000000	2002440	You're the wrong one to watch over her.
2002440	2004600	And that's what you're doing?
2004600	2007200	Watching over her?
2007200	2008880	Aye, that's what I'm doing.
2008880	2013680	In the book, the Hound goes down from blood poisoning from a stupid wound he gets in a bar fight.
2013680	2020680	But in the show, you have two characters you both care about fighting over Arya to the death?
2020680	2022320	Like, I want them both to beâ€”
2022320	2024720	No! No, my children!
2024720	2026160	I'm screaming!
2026160	2028480	So...
2028480	2029680	Cleganebowl.
2029680	2031320	Let the dogs out!
2031320	2033080	Hoot! Hoot! Hoot! Hoot!
2033080	2034640	I'm not a knight.
2038880	2041680	You're a talker.
2041680	2045080	Listening to talkers...
2045080	2046280	makes me thirsty.
2046280	2049280	Thirsty. Thirsty.
2049280	2054000	At best, Cleganebowl is slash was a fan theory that combined both book and TV lore,
2054000	2055400	a lot of internet meme culture,
2055400	2060680	and the burning desire to see this giant man kick the ass of this other giant man
2060680	2065280	in a revenge fight so epic that it would rock the foundations of Westeros itself.
2065280	2068000	You know who's coming for you.
2068000	2069200	You've always known.
2069200	2071600	Get hyped.
2071600	2074800	See, the Hound looks the way he does and is afraid of fire
2074800	2080200	because his brother, the Mountain, shoved his face into a fire when they were kids.
2080200	2084200	And ever since then, he's wanted him some revenge for that and some other things.
2084200	2088800	All about that revenge. Just really, really hates that mountain that rides. Hates him.
2088800	2091800	My brother's alive.
2091800	2093400	Hates him, the Hound.
2093600	2096400	We come across my brother.
2096400	2099400	Maybe we can both cross a name off a list.
2099400	2100400	Wants revenge.
2100400	2104000	And while, yeah, the meme itself was a lot of fun and we got hype and everything,
2104000	2108400	as a dramatic plot point, it's, um, it's really fucking dumb.
2108400	2112200	One, not only is the Mountain functionally dead by this point, like,
2112200	2117800	Oberyn Martell killed him and what we have now is basically just a mindless zombie
2117800	2120200	that does whatever Cersei says.
2120200	2124600	But two, the books make it pretty clear that Sandor is finally at peace with himself
2124600	2126200	and his need for revenge.
2126200	2130200	If the gods are real, why haven't they punished me?
2130200	2131800	They have.
2131800	2136400	Revenge being mistaken for justice is a big thing in the books and we will get to that later.
2136400	2140400	His arc wasn't about getting revenge, it was about moving past that.
2140400	2142200	In the show, I...
2142200	2145800	You can still help a lot more than you've harmed Clegane.
2145800	2147000	It's not too late for you.
2147000	2151200	Never too late to stop robbing people, to stop killing people.
2151200	2153000	Start helping people.
2153000	2154800	Never too late to come back.
2157400	2160200	You know who's coming for you.
2160200	2161400	You've always known.
2167000	2168400	Who is forcing you to do this?
2168400	2169400	He's, he's like a zombie.
2169400	2171600	He's dead, he's a shell, he's a zombie.
2171600	2175400	Cleganebowl happens while Daenerys is doing some war crimes
2175600	2177800	and King's Landing is burning.
2177800	2179600	They're fighting for nothing.
2179600	2182000	The Hound has long since moved on.
2182000	2184800	This has not been his motivation for a while.
2184800	2188000	Gregor is an empty zombie shell and the world is ending outside
2188000	2190800	and everyone here is about to die anyway, so who cares?
2190800	2193000	The Hound isn't even fighting for Arya.
2193000	2194600	He's not protecting anyone.
2194600	2195400	And look at me.
2195400	2196400	Look at me!
2199200	2200400	You want to be like me?
2200400	2202600	You two rode a thousand miles on horseback together
2202600	2205000	and you only now decide to have this conversation?
2205000	2207200	Go home, girl.
2207200	2209000	The fire will get her.
2209000	2210400	The one who lit the thrackey.
2212800	2216000	Also, Arya murdered all of House Lord Life Alert
2216000	2219000	and baked them into pies and fed them to their father.
2219000	2222600	I'm pretty sure her revenge quest is shot the moon
2222600	2225600	in comparison to yours, sir.
2225600	2227000	I'm not sir.
2227000	2229600	So Cleganebowl had no reason to exist
2229600	2233800	other than the concept becoming memetic on a god-tier level.
2235200	2237800	Yeah, that's you.
2240200	2241800	That's what you've always been.
2241800	2245800	How do you like me now?
2245800	2247400	Fucking die!
2247400	2249800	Fan service also comes with the double-edged sword
2249800	2252200	of, in this case, the show's self-imposed burden
2252200	2254600	of needing to be smarter than the fans,
2254600	2256800	which becomes harder and harder in a world
2256800	2260400	with massive subreddits dedicated to theorizing about the thing
2260400	2261800	in incredible detail.
2261800	2264200	So somewhere along the line, subverting expectations
2264200	2267600	stopped being a thing one did because it benefited the story
2267600	2271400	and more a thing one did because, well...
2271400	2273200	We hoped to kind of avoid the expected.
2273200	2274800	She seemed like the best candidate
2274800	2277800	provided we weren't thinking about her in that moment.
2277800	2280000	This isn't necessarily unique to Game of Thrones.
2280000	2282400	Westworld creator and showrunner Jonathan Nolan
2282400	2285000	admitted that an episode from season two had to be rewritten
2285000	2287800	after Reddit fans guessed a major upcoming twist.
2287800	2290400	Reddit has already figured out the third episode twist,
2290400	2292600	said Nolan, so we're changing that right now.
2292800	2295400	It's annoying sometimes when people guess the twists
2295400	2296600	and then blog about it.
2296600	2300400	You can't complain when people are that engaged, he added.
2300400	2303800	It's very gratifying, but stop doing it, please.
2303800	2306600	I can't help but think that fans should be allowed
2306600	2309600	to, like, gather in groups online and theorize
2309600	2312600	and have fun without networks, like, watching in
2312600	2315400	and going, oh no, they figured us out.
2315400	2318200	We better go change the show
2318200	2322000	because we only exist to outsmart Reddit.
2322000	2325200	Like, you don't have to be unexpected
2325200	2328000	for the sake of being unexpected,
2328000	2330800	but when your show is kind of known for that...
2330800	2332600	We hope to kind of avoid the expected.
2332600	2334400	These people have guessed the secret
2334400	2336600	that I'm going to reveal in book six.
2336600	2338200	People have already guessed that here
2338200	2339800	and book two is just out.
2339800	2341200	You really have two choices there.
2341200	2343600	You can ignore it and proceed with your plan,
2343600	2346600	despite the fact that some people know where you're going,
2346600	2348800	or you can get all panicky and say,
2348800	2350200	oh my God, they figured it out.
2350200	2351200	I can't let that be.
2351200	2352200	I'll have to change it.
2352200	2354200	I'll have to go in a different direction.
2354200	2356400	And I think some writers do that,
2356400	2358600	and I think that's always a mistake.
2358600	2360200	You know, if you've planned your book
2360200	2362200	that the butler did it,
2362200	2363600	and then you read on the internet
2363600	2366000	someone has figured out that the butler did it,
2366000	2367800	and you suddenly change in midstream
2367800	2369800	and it was the chambermaid who did it,
2369800	2371800	then you screw up the whole book.
2371800	2374200	So I'm not saying that David Benioff and D.B. Weiss
2374200	2376000	were writing the show with the intention
2376000	2378000	of both indulging in fan service
2378000	2380600	while also avoiding correct fan theories.
2380600	2383400	I'm just saying this culture inevitably influences
2383400	2385800	and infiltrates the writing of a show
2385800	2387600	that was already handicapping itself
2387600	2390000	by limiting its runtime for...
2390000	2391200	no reason,
2391200	2393800	except that you're really over the show
2393800	2395200	that made you famous,
2395200	2398000	and you got a Star War you need to go ruin.
2398000	2399000	I mean, make.
2399000	2401200	Why is it ending?
2401200	2402200	Uh, I don't know.
2402200	2404200	Ask Dave and Dan when they come through.
2404200	2407800	We could have gone to 11, 12, 13 seasons,
2407800	2409200	but, uh, they...
2409200	2410400	I guess they wanted a life.
2410400	2412800	The journalist who reported that quote from Benioff
2412800	2416000	diplomatically described his reaction to it as
2416000	2417400	frustrated.
2417400	2419600	In hindsight, that's a bit of an understatement,
2419600	2422600	seeing as any thematic coherence in the series fell apart
2422600	2424800	after Martin stopped being actively involved
2424800	2426400	in the production after...
2426400	2427400	wouldn't you know?
2427400	2428600	Season four.
2428600	2429400	What are the odds?
2429400	2431600	But to me, it betrays a certain lack of curiosity
2431600	2433400	on the part of Benioff and Weiss,
2433400	2435000	and it makes me wonder
2435000	2438200	why are they even dedicating their lives to storytelling
2438200	2441000	if they are so uninterested in themes?
2441000	2443000	Especially given that they adapted a book
2443000	2444600	that was so heavy with them.
2444600	2446400	What unites people?
2446400	2447400	Armies?
2449400	2450400	Gold?
2456000	2457000	Stories.
2458000	2461000	There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story.
2461000	2463400	Yeah, so this series functionally ends with
2463400	2464800	these two chuckle fucks like
2464800	2467600	fetishizing storytellers as the most important people
2467600	2468800	to ever exist.
2468800	2472000	But yeah, themes are for 8th grade book reports.
2472000	2474400	We want to avoid the expected
2474400	2476600	because that means it's bad, okay?
2476600	2478200	And who has a better story
2479600	2481200	than Bran the Broken?
2484400	2485400	So you might be asking,
2485400	2488800	did you really just spend 45 minutes whinging?
2488800	2490200	I'm not whinging!
2490200	2493000	Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something.
2493000	2493800	That's whinging.
2493800	2496800	And you didn't even get into any specifics?
2497000	2497600	Yep.
2497600	2498600	Uh, yeah.
2498600	2501400	We got about 10,000 words worth of our whinging.
2501400	2502200	That's whinging.
2502200	2504400	In our Google Doc before we realized that
2504400	2506000	this was, this is gonna be two-parter.
2506000	2507400	Yep, it's two-parter.
2507400	2508200	Sorry.
2509600	2512000	And this part is the sponsored part.
2512000	2514400	Are you interested in thematic coherence?
2514400	2516800	Do you have a book report you need to write?
2516800	2518400	Are you in the 8th grade?
2518400	2521400	Don't have time to read A Song of Ice and Fire?
2521400	2524000	Well, why not listen to it using Audible?
2524000	2526000	Audible members now get more than ever before.
2526000	2527600	Members choose three titles every month,
2527600	2530000	one audiobook plus two Audible originals
2530000	2531600	that you can't hear anywhere else.
2531600	2533600	Members also have unlimited access to more than
2533600	2536800	a hundred audio-guided fitness and meditation programs.
2536800	2537800	I love those.
2537800	2538800	And you might be like,
2538800	2542000	Game of Thrones is 33 hours long!
2542000	2543400	And that's a lot.
2543400	2546000	To which I say, the first book I recommended for Audible
2546000	2549400	was Disney War, and that sucker is three hours longer.
2549400	2552200	And it's also 33% shorter if you listen to it
2552200	2554200	at 1.5x speed like I do.
2554200	2556000	Right now, I'm listening to the Hugo nominees
2556000	2557400	for Best Novel.
2557400	2560400	If you didn't hear, Angelina and I are actually
2560400	2564600	nominated for a Hugo this year for our Hobbit duology.
2564600	2567400	Hey, I might get to meet George R. R. Martin
2567400	2570000	at his loser's party.
2570000	2572400	Oh, no.
2572400	2574400	I'm going to let best-selling author John Green

2621800	2623200	Listening to talkers
2625200	2626400	makes me thirsty.
2626400	2627000	Thirsty.
2627000	2627800	Thirsty.
2634600	2635200	Thirsty.
2635200	2635800	Thirsty.
