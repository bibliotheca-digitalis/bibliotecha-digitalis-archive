1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
All were angry and many were frightened, and they converged on City Hall demanding and pleading.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,500
And more than 200 were hauled off to the station house.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,500
The first cases of AIDS in the United States were reported in 1981.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,500
By 1983, there were over a thousand reported cases in the U.S.,

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,000
and by that point, already half had proven fatal.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Unlike other high-mortality-rate viruses like Ebola,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,500
HIV tended not to be something one may eventually recover from once infected.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Part of the slowed government response was because of the epidemic curve of the HIV virus.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Unlike Ebola virus, it was gradual, with symptoms appearing in a matter of years instead of days.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's easier for epidemiologists to encourage behavior changes in a population

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
for an in-your-face disease like smallpox or Ebola virus,

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,500
but AIDS, despite its near 100% mortality rate,

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,000
was so slow-moving that not only was mass behavior change difficult to encourage,

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
most people who spread the virus did not themselves even know that they were infected.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,500
Drug use was a risk factor. Unprotected sex was also a risk factor.

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,500
But many risk factors were not in people's control.

17
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,500
For instance, the 1980s was not a great time to be a hemophiliac.

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,500
But another aspect was the factor that the epicenter of the outbreak

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,000
was not in middle-class straight white families,

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
but the gay community in urban centers like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Since all of the earliest cases were discovered in gay men,

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,500
it was easy for lawmakers to moralize the outbreak,

23
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,500
not just as a sexually transmitted disease, but also of moral degeneracy.

24
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,000
Pat Buchanan, who was the leader of White House Communications at the time,

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,500
wrote about AIDS,

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Reagan didn't seem to understand the seriousness of the epidemic

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
until his friend Rock Hudson announced that he was HIV positive four years into the epidemic.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But even then it wasn't enough to get the administration to act on it.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,500
Dr. Donald P. Francis, an epidemiologist within the CDC assigned to the AIDS outbreak,

30
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,500
later wrote,

31
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,000
Much like firefighters confronting a fire,

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
early aggressive action pays off,

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
whereas slow passive action leads to massive destruction.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,500
The CDC, with the help of Francis, developed a comprehensive plan in 1985

35
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,500
to help stop the spread of HIV,

36
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,500
which had by now infected thousands.

37
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,000
But the Reagan administration rejected it outright.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The administration told epidemiologists within the CDC

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
to look pretty and do as little as possible.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Surgeon General C. Everett Koop was explicitly banned by the Reagan administration

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
from addressing the AIDS crisis

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
when in 1986 he broke with orders and did address what was by now a pandemic.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He was attacked from within all areas of the administration.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The powers that be within the CDC refused to stand up to their bosses

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
higher up in the Reagan administration.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Director of the CDC James Mason, regarding the CDC's failure to act,

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
later said,

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,500
By the late 1980s, with now hundreds of thousands of new cases of HIV,

49
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
it wasn't an issue of passivity, but of active obstruction.

50
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,000
An increasingly popular narrative surrounding the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
was that there was nothing to be done to stop it,

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
that the onus was solely on the infected,

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,500
and there was nothing but their own behavior to blame.

54
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,000
But the spread of HIV-AIDS in the United States was not inevitable,

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and had the powers that be acted sooner,

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,500
millions of lives could have been saved.

57
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,000
This is what happens when governments fail the people they are sworn to protect.

58
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,500
Healthcare is a right! Healthcare is a right! Healthcare is a right!

59
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,500
So, yeah, anyway, today we're going to talk about rent.

60
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Let he among us without sin be the first to condemn!

61
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,500
Well, fortunately, I have literally never sinned.

62
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
So condemn away I shall.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,500
Okay, so here's the thing, full disclosure,

64
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,500
I have always hated rent,

65
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,000
for basically the same reason I hate Reality Bites.

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,500
Yes, even before the movie came out, and yes,

67
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
despite the fact that I lived in the East Village of New York City

68
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,500
the first time I saw it on Broadway and was surrounded by rent-heads,

69
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
or, hell, maybe even because of that.

70
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,500
And the other thing is, the older I get,

71
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,000
the more things I find about rent that annoy me.

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Like, when I was a freshman at NYU,

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I was, like, surrounded by these rent-heads who were, like, it me,

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and I'm like, well, you know, I guess you're not completely wrong,

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
you know, trust Fun Babies.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And then later, I eventually burned a bridge over someone

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
who insisted that rent was beyond criticism

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
because Jonathan Larson died of AIDS.

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He didn't. And even if he did, no.

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I actually won the ticket lottery for this sucker twice.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So, sorry, stage-so-apologists, I'm not here for you.

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
This ain't a stage-show-good-movie-bad kind of episode,

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
so hunker down, y'all!

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Not to mention, of course, hating dear old mom and dad.

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Thing is, the movie does exist in a realm of bad,

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
partially separated from the stage show by virtue of adaptation sickness,

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
and it is not a good adaptation,

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
but a lot of my problems with rent are with rent as a whole.

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So this one goes out to all the people who asked me to deconstruct rent

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
like I did with Schumacher's Phantom,

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and to you, I say, I can't.

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Sorry.

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hey, mister.

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
She's my sister.

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And the truth about rent's adaptation is it's not really that inept.

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I mean, although there are some decisions that are like, what?

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You're what you are.

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But the thing that makes rent the movie fail

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
is the same basic affliction Phantom suffered from.

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The filmmakers didn't know how to translate the stage musical effectively.

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And similar to what we discussed with the Phantom adaptation,

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
its main failure is stripping the source material

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
of the theatrical elements that make it flow

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and replacing it with, you know, mostly montages.

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
From the soul of a young man.

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
A young man.

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Some on-screen dialogue.

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You want me to be your slave?

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You want me to just obey your every wish?

110
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
More scenes, less singing, setting leases on fire.

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But in the end, it has more in common with the adaptation of Les Mis than Phantom.

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's just kind of a boring musical made by a boring filmmaker

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
who never seemed terribly comfortable with the source material.

114
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And in fairness to the original work,

115
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
the movie is much more un-good than the Broadway show.

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And it is important to note that rent is one of the first mainstream-ish works

117
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
with any kind of substantial LGBT representation.

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And hey, this is also one of the rare representations of a bisexual character,

119
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
although she, of course, is the slutty McSlutter Slutterson

120
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
who wants to slut it up with every living human.

121
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Because, bye.

122
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
There will always be women in rubber flirting with me.

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Rent was a step.

124
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It was a step in helping to humanize the LGBT community

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
and urban centers to a broader audience

126
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
who might not have humanized them otherwise.

127
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You know, I'm not here to deny that.

128
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That said, I don't have much nice to say about Rent,

129
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
so if it was, like, integral to your childhood or something,

130
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
you probably might want to sit this one out.

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Rent.

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
If there was one wrong directorial choice

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
to embody the countercultural discontent of the youngs,

134
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
it was Chris Columbus.

135
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Fresh off voice-of-a-generation avant-garde tentpoles

136
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
like Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, and the first two Harry Potters.

137
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Hell, maybe that's why Benny, the alleged sellout,

138
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
is, unlike the stage show, easily the most sympathetic character in the movie.

139
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Columbus is like, here's a guy who knows what's up.

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
If you want to produce films and write songs,

141
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
you need somewhere to do it.

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Invest your money wisely, Benny,

143
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
and use that money to fund your passion project five years from now.

144
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And meanwhile, your old friends will still be poor

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and wondering why the cruel, cruel world

146
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
is forcing them to pay rent to live in a building.

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Anyway, I can't speak to your local community theater production of Rent,

148
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
but the problems that most people have with Rent

149
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
are not necessarily unique to the movie.

150
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Mark, are you there?

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Are you screening your call?

152
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's Mom.

153
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Hi, I just wanted to call and say we love you.

154
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But they are certainly more pronounced.

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
There are times when we're dirt broke,

156
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and hungry, and freezing,

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
and I ask myself,

158
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
why the hell am I still living here?

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And then they call.

160
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
F*** you, Mark.

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
God, this f***ing movie wakes the inner walker-wielding granny in me

162
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
yelling at these kids to get off my lawn.

163
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And these damn kids are from the generation before mine.

164
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So yeah, the reason why Rent the movie fails

165
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
has a lot in common with why Phantom the movie did not work.

166
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But, you know, we've already covered that ground.

167
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm more interested in Rent as part of the grander, counter-cultural canon.

168
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Do you feel left behind by the system?

169
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
A system that, say, doesn't take your art seriously,

170
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
or maybe failed to act on an epidemic before it became a pandemic.

171
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
A system that profited off life-saving drugs,

172
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
that failed to fund research.

173
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
There are over 140 drugs out there that the FDA has identified as possibilities.

174
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That stigmatized the sick,

175
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
that looked the other way when hundreds of thousands of people in our own country were dropping dead.

176
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I think we'd all like a generation-defining musical that really takes the system to task.

177
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But Rent ain't it.

178
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Oh.

179
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Mama who bore me,

180
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Mama who gave me

181
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
No way to handle things

182
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Who made me so sad

183
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The stage musical is a popular format to try and capture the discontent of the... something.

184
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It is the music of a people who will not be slaves again

185
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
We have been left behind by the system. The musical.

186
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
There's a lot of those.

187
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But Rent is literally based on the first we have been left behind by the system.

188
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The musical.

189
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Oh no, c'io milionario

190
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Se fa segno il buon Dio

191
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
La Bohème was the original... that.

192
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Puccini's La Bohème was arguably the start of the mainstream counter-cultural Fightin' the Man musical.

193
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It is the basis of not only Rent, but many modern films and musicals.

194
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Most notably Moulin Rouge, which although based on La Traviata,

195
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
borrows arguably more from Bohème than Traviata,

196
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
or the film from which it takes its name, but not its exclamation point.

197
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'd summarize the plot, but it's basically identical to Rent.

198
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Swap out tuberculosis with AIDS, the Latin Quarter with Alphabet City,

199
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
the 1840s with the 1980s, and Americanify the characters' names a bit.

200
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm Roger

201
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Puccini's Bohème was popular because its characters were relatable,

202
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
and the story was emotionally charged.

203
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The real revelation here is that his opera is about an underclass.

204
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He isn't writing about kings or dukes,

205
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
but about starving artists who feel that they've been left behind.

206
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It is truly a universal story, translatable to any era.

207
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Phantom of the Opera also draws a lot of inspiration from Bohème

208
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
in that it goes a long way with raw, simple, shallow emotionality.

209
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But the difference between Phantom and Rent is

210
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Phantom wasn't trying to make a grand statement about society.

211
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And the truth is, La Bohème isn't either. Not really.

212
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It exists more in the same vein as Moulin Rouge.

213
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You're the voice of the children of the revolution!

214
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But what is the revolution?

215
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I mean, it's not a socialist revolution, or a class revolution, or...

216
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
We have freedom!

217
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Beauty, truth, and love!

218
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Okay.

219
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
See, they use terms like revolution in Moulin Rouge,

220
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
but really, it's about emotionality with an artistic movement set as the backdrop.

221
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Shows like this have romantic ideas in the guise of revolution,

222
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
but none of them challenge any existing power structures

223
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
in a way that might alienate the wealthy audience,

224
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
especially as portrayed in the movie.

225
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
In Cyberland, we only drink...

226
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Diet Coke.

227
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Yeah, that'll show The Man.

228
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Look at those monocles poppin' everywhere.

229
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Every decade sorta had its own.

230
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The 1960s had Hair, the 70s Jesus Christ Superstar,

231
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
80s had Les Mis, 90s had Rent, 2000s...

232
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
wanted to have Spring Awakening, but really, they had Avenue Q.

233
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
They all tried to capture the voice of the class of youngs that feel left out of the system.

234
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Although, all of these are what George Ishikawa has called bourgeois or finished theater.

235
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
In other words, they frame themselves as revolutionary,

236
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
but continue to push the voice, worldview, and values of the status quo.

237
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
In this case, middle-class white kids who want to pass off their home movies as true art.

238
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
From here on in, I shoot without a script.

239
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Without a script? Oh, Mark, you visionary.

240
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
See, this is what I mean when I say that Rent's primary purpose

241
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
is to validate a certain subsect of the theater going public

242
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
rather than bring any theater of the oppressed to the amasses.

243
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This is an idea developed by revolutionary Brazilian dramatist Augusto Bol,

244
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
who developed the idea of theater of the oppressed.

245
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And Bol takes a Marxist reading to pretty much all theater on this subject, so bear that in mind.

246
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Echoing Marx, Bol argues that the dominant art is the art of the dominant class,

247
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
who control the means to disseminate art.

248
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
In this case, Broadway shows.

249
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
All of these shows revolve around the social discontent of some underclass,

250
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
but the shows did not reach the mainstream because some underclass propelled them there.

251
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Rent did claw its way up from off-Broadway, yes,

252
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
but only because it found success with the people who had money.

253
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Only thing to do is jump over the moon.

254
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Hamilton is a perfect example of this phenomenon in action right now.

255
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
High demand and extremely limited quantities

256
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
mean that only the wealthy control access to the stage show.

257
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
A lottery system does exist that sells tickets for $10,

258
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
but there are 21 of these tickets per show and thousands of entrants.

259
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Real access comes in the form of people with thousands of dollars to drop on tickets.

260
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And because Broadway shows are so uniquely expensive in terms of consumable art,

261
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
they have to walk a fine line between being trendy,

262
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
maybe even a little edgy,

263
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
but not enough to put the people with money outside of their comfort zones.

264
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It presents a multi-culti hip-hop narrative about the life of Alexander Hamilton

265
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
and the foundation of the country,

266
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
but it is ultimately really, really reassuring about the American experiment.

267
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?

268
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?

269
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The ruling class does.

270
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You remember you belong to me.

271
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
If you want people to hear your message,

272
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
it first has to get the okay from your wealthy patrons.

273
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I mean, it's no coincidence that the first hip-hop musical to become a huge hit

274
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
happens to be about the whitest thing ever.

275
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And Hamilton is excellent, don't get me wrong.

276
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's just not here to challenge any ideas on American exceptionalism

277
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
or start any revolutions.

278
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught.

279
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You've got to be carefully taught.

280
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
If you talk, you're gonna get shot.

281
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Does every musical need to necessarily challenge the culture it's trying to sell itself to?

282
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
God, no.

283
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I mean, how else would I see Phantom for the 20th time?

284
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
One time only!

285
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
But anyway, not every musical, even the ones with explicit revolutionary text,

286
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
needs to be trying to tear down the system.

287
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
But what would a revolution look like if it had been included in Rent

288
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
rather than the subtext being reject the system instead of change it?

289
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Well, probably what was going down in Alphabet City in the 80s in the real world.

290
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Thousands of demonstrators demand that New York City do more

291
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
to help those suffering from AIDS.

292
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Protests, societal upheaval, all those unpretty things

293
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
that were very much going on during the AIDS crisis,

294
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
they were not designed to make the type of person

295
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
with hundreds of dollars to drop on a Broadway show ticket comfortable.

296
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Do you think you've really accomplished a great deal?

297
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yes, I think we do. What else can we do?

298
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
But Les Mis does not position itself in opposition to the culture it is trying to sell itself to.

299
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Neither does Hamilton.

300
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
But Rent does.

301
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And if your musical spins its entirety dressing down the phony baloney culture

302
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
while at the same time kind of being its very embodiment,

303
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
then we may need to have words.

304
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Rent the Broadway Musical was met with much more universal acclaim

305
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Rent the Broadway Musical was met with much more universal acclaim

306
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
than Bohem a century prior.

307
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It wasn't for another couple of years until we started seeing pushback against Rent.

308
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The movie was what made society as a whole really start to turn on Rent.

309
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So thank you for that movie.

310
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
See, Rent's heyday came and went,

311
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
and a few more years passed,

312
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
and then another few more years passed,

313
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
and then they threw another few years on for posterity.

314
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And they made the movie with the original cast.

315
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So by the time the movie comes out, it's like,

316
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
yeah, sure, sure, you're in your 20s.

317
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And they went hard trying to keep the original cast,

318
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
which was just weird.

319
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Rosario Dawson and Tracy Toms are the only people who seem happy to be here.

320
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Everyone else is in their 30s, and they've moved on with their careers,

321
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
but here they are, pretending to be in their early 20s, and it's weird.

322
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Many of the songs are cut and turned into dialogue,

323
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
which makes for an even draggier experience than it might have been.

324
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Even with the opening number, when they are asking themselves,

325
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
how we gonna pay, how we gonna pay next year's Rent?

326
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Rent, Rent, Rent, Rent, Rent, Rent, Rent.

327
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
The music is arranged similarly to the shows, which is a group number.

328
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
But in the show, everyone in the neighborhood doesn't all collectively decide

329
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
to stop paying rent at the same time.

330
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's more like, you know, like a Greek choir type thing.

331
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Unlike in the movie, where it appears to be a riot.

332
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And like, okay, so Benny turns off their heat, right?

333
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
So they have to burn their precious art creations for warmth.

334
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
This is also lifted directly from La Boheme.

335
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
This is how that starts. Burning our art for warmth.

336
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's like an irony thing.

337
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But then they throw it out the window.

338
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I mean, the whole thing is full of adaptive changes

339
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
that don't really stand up to modest scrutiny.

340
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Joanne and Maureen's relationship never gets resolved in the movie.

341
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Like, they break up and then are together again at the end when they find Mimi.

342
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I guess they get back together off-screen somewhere.

343
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
This works better in the show because they break up and get back together constantly,

344
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
and that's the joke.

345
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
The movie starts with Seasons of Love,

346
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
which is an odd decision as the whole point of that song

347
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
is that it happens after intermission to impart that a year has passed.

348
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
So at the front of the movie, it's just like a song that's there.

349
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
But people know it, so let's start with that, I guess.

350
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Lots of 2005 vehicles here in 1989.

351
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Nobody has 80s hair.

352
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Mark's camera has no sound recording apparatus.

353
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Why are we taking a train to life support if everything's in Alphabet City?

354
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
A neighborhood with no train access.

355
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Roger returns to Manhattan from Santa Fe via the Williamsburg Bridge.

356
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Some of the worst CGI cold-weather breath in history of moviedom.

357
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Lazy, uncreative use of your setting.

358
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Or just strange use of setting.

359
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Is he about to try to sell me a really manly truck?

360
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
There are a lot of problems with Rent that are movie-specific,

361
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
but my interest is more comprehensive.

362
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And it starts with the fact that...

363
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Dorothy and Toto went over the rainbow

364
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
To blow off fancy air

365
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Rent is a musical about selfish, horrible people,

366
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
framed like freedom fighters.

367
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
They show profound entitlement over other people's rights and property,

368
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
but it is framed like romantic rebelliousness.

369
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
A restaurant owner begs them,

370
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
please don't patronize our restaurant, please.

371
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Please, no, no, not tonight. Please leave.

372
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
They then ignore him when he asks them not to move the tables around.

373
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Please don't move the tables.

374
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Hey, Rosie, let's put these tables together.

375
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
No, no, no, no.

376
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Maureen is an emotionally abusive cheater who gaslights all of her partners.

377
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Angel comes into wealth at the beginning by killing a dog.

378
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
But sure as I am here, that dog is now in doggy hell.

379
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Mimi is a self-destructive codependent enabler.

380
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Collins honors the memory of his dead lover

381
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
by hotwiring a local ATM to dispense cash for him and his friends

382
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
when you plug his name in.

383
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I rewired the ATM at the food employee.

384
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Now he needs the code A-N-G-E-L.

385
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And Mark. Sweet Mark.

386
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You might be the worst thing to have ever happened.

387
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And you are... I'm just here to...

388
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
To appropriate your tragedy for my art without having obtained permission.

389
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I hope that's cool.

390
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Rent the Movie really has two stories that don't mesh

391
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
when you give it more than a passing thought.

392
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
The story of the tragic AIDS havers

393
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
and the love triangle between Joanne, Mark, and Maureen.

394
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And these two things have nothing to do with each other

395
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
besides that they know each other.

396
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
But really, Mark and Maureen, while they feel bad for the AIDS havers,

397
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I guess their stories are more about their poetry and their art.

398
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha!

399
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Mark has his aimless documentary and Maureen her terrible performance art.

400
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Both have loving support structures and come from wealthy families

401
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
and none of these people have AIDS or really any reason not to pay the rent

402
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
other than the fact that they feel they shouldn't have to

403
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
because art and selling out are something.

404
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And I ask myself, why the hell am I still living here?

405
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Fuck you!

406
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You know that song, Common People?

407
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Still you'll never get it right

408
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's when you're late in bed at night

409
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Watching roaches climb the wall

410
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
If you called your dad he could stop it, oh yeah

411
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Aw, look Mark, someone wrote a song about you.

412
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
In the show it's more obvious that Maureen is terrible

413
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
and kind of a narcissist, and this is really a pastiche of bad performance art.

414
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha!

415
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha!

416
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But in the movie it is played dead fucking straight.

417
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And the suits are in the audience blown away by how real she is.

418
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Moo with me

419
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Laterate, no!

420
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
They're mooing with her.

421
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Now, the fact that they are horrible need not be a problem.

422
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I need your help to make my neighbor's yappy dog disappear.

423
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Or even that their horribleness goes unexamined by the characters.

424
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
That is, after all, a condition of human behavior.

425
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
But the problem, like the faux-revolutionary subtext, is with the framing.

426
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
The show doesn't really go anywhere with this.

427
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
This type of character is much more effectively explored in Trainspotting.

428
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
In Trainspotting, you are meant to relate to the characters, sure,

429
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
but it makes no pretense of them being idealists or good people.

430
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It much more successfully dresses down the phoniness of the society that they reject.

431
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Choose life, choose a job, choose a career, choose a family,

432
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
choose a fucking big television, choose washing machines, cars,

433
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
compact displayers and electrical tin openers.

434
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
But at the same time, it doesn't dress them up like they are legitimately too good for society.

435
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
They are very obviously not.

436
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So, Rent presents us with a worldview that validates the characters rather than challenges them.

437
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And romantic validation is part of what made Rent so popular.

438
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
You know, similar to Bowen before it.

439
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
But there are ways that this sort of thing can be...

440
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
maybe a little contradictory.

441
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Yes, we are so counter-cultural, like in this scene.

442
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
The nadir of the film, where they dance on the table

443
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
while the pearl-clutching suits are scandalized by the interests of the Bohemians.

444
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Like, huevos rancheros.

445
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Yeah, eating disorders!

446
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Woo!

447
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Rent's primary theme comes from the conflict between Bohemian ideals

448
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
and selling out for financial security.

449
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
What rent?

450
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
This past year's rent which I let slide.

451
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Yeah, they don't want to pay rent because their friend who owns the building

452
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
has reneged on a deal he made with them that they can live there rent-free.

453
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
But there is this underlying entitlement that these guys have

454
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
that they shouldn't have to pay rent

455
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
because they're artists and they don't sell out.

456
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Get off my lawn!

457
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Because working for a show like BuzzLine is completely selling out.

458
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Mark has among the worst resolution to his subplot.

459
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Particularly frustrating to those of us working in journalism today.

460
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Start at $3,000?

461
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
He works for a sort of proto-TMZ-style news organization

462
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
and makes bank doing it,

463
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
but he doesn't like having a job in his chosen field of study

464
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
because selling out.

465
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I sold my soul.

466
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Oh, poor baby.

467
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
You have to work your way up from a job you don't really like

468
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
in your chosen field that pays really well as a starting point for your career?

469
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
If I need to finish my own film, I quit!

470
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Mark, you are the worst.

471
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
There is a big homeless subplot,

472
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
but it's much bigger in the stage show than the movie.

473
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
No room at the Holiday Inn, oh no!

474
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
But the big thing that is pointed out by this character,

475
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
but goes oddly unexamined,

476
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
is the fact that none of these people really care about the homeless.

477
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Who do you think you are?

478
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I don't need no goddamn help from some bleeding heart cameraman.

479
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
My life's not for you to make a name for yourself for.

480
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Easy, sugar, easy. He was just trying...

481
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Just trying to use me to kill his guilt.

482
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Mark getting called out on it doesn't prompt any change in behavior.

483
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Maureen really doesn't give a shit about their plight.

484
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
She only cares about her performance space not being taken from her.

485
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
The tent city is just a backdrop.

486
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
The problem with the theme of selling out for security

487
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
versus adhering to your precious ideals while living in poverty,

488
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
with the backdrop of a massive homeless subplot,

489
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
which was not there in La Boheme, by the by,

490
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
is that it infers that poverty is a choice, and a noble one at that.

491
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Which, sure, Mark has a choice as to whether or not to live in poverty.

492
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Pretty much all of the characters do, except Angel and Collins.

493
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
But the homeless do not choose to live on the street

494
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
in order to uphold their Bohemian ideals.

495
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
So right there we have thematic dissonance number one.

496
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Choosing to live in poverty and romanticizing it

497
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
while surrounded by those living in poverty who do not have a choice,

498
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
and are repulsed by your romanticizing their tragedy, Mark.

499
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Hey, artist! You got a dollar?

500
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Didn't think so.

501
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Yeah, this prompts no change in him, and is the last time it gets brought up.

502
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
The second major theme is that of affliction.

503
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
La Boheme is set against the backdrop of tuberculosis,

504
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
rent of AIDS, which afflicts far more characters in Rent than TB did in Boheme.

505
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So when you have theme one over here, and theme two over here,

506
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
this is where we really start kind of running into problems.

507
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Mark Cohen's character arc, played up in the movie to the point

508
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
where, unlike in the show, he is the explicit protagonist,

509
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
reminds me so much of Lelena in Reality Bites.

510
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
They both exploit their parents,

511
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
neither want to sell out their precious art or play by the rules of fucking society,

512
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
steal shit, know they'll get away with any rules broken

513
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
because they're white kids who come from wealthy families,

514
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
and their approach to documentary is just...

515
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Shoot whatever and call it art because it exists, and I made it.

516
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
From here on in, I shoot without a script.

517
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
To quote Nathan Rabin, last time I checked,

518
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
those are called home fucking movies and nobody thinks that's high art.

519
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
So we suffer in the cold and ignore our loving families

520
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
because suffering equals art, and the homeless are suffering,

521
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
and we like them because suffering equals art,

522
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
and as long as they don't expect us to recognize their needs as humans,

523
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
then hey, maybe they don't think suffering is all that artistic, you assholes.

524
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So in Rent, poverty, despite being confronted on how shitty it is

525
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
to try to appropriate someone else's suffering, Mark,

526
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
is always justified because art,

527
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
and capitalist society is always out to consume you,

528
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
which is why you own nothing, you rent,

529
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
therefore you are always justified in taking anything you can from society.

530
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I rewired the ATM at the food employee.

531
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It's not stealing because you're an artist and the rules don't apply to you.

532
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
You know, poverty is not romantic.

533
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Just throwing it out there.

534
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Anyway, let's tie that back in with the theme of affliction.

535
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Affliction

536
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
No day but today

537
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
A big theme in Rent is presented in the no day but today motif,

538
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
with the central conflict of Mimi and Roger's relationship

539
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
being planning for an uncertain future versus living for the now.

540
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Problem here is Rent doesn't try to find a balance,

541
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
but rather that planning for the future thing tends to be painted in a more negative light,

542
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
especially where Benny is concerned.

543
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
You make fun, yet I'm the one

544
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Attempting to do some good

545
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Or do you really want a neighborhood

546
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Where people piss on your stoop every night

547
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
The no day but today motif is seen in the life support group,

548
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
No day but today

549
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
and in the interactions between Roger and Mimi,

550
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
a bad idea of a relationship that at least one of them gets some bad juju about,

551
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
but here we go anyway.

552
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Your smile reminded me

553
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I always remind people of

554
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
It's almost like I have a type

555
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And I'm drawn to self-destructive addicts

556
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
See, Roger's ex-girlfriend committed suicide

557
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
after finding out that both she and Roger have AIDS.

558
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
The suicide part's not clear in the movie, by the by.

559
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
His girlfriend April left a note

560
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Saying we've got AIDS

561
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Before slitting her wrists in the bathroom

562
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
So the first time we see the no day but today motif

563
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
is used at Angel's life support meeting.

564
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
In the very next scene, we see it again

565
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
when Mimi is trying to get Roger to do drugs with her.

566
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Forget, regret

567
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
All life is yours to miss

568
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
There is an honesty here,

569
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
like that Roger wants to be with her

570
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
but isn't allowing himself to because he's afraid to live

571
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
and Mimi's trying to get him to open up.

572
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
However, this doesn't really work because

573
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
this very simple framing,

574
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
the fact that Mimi is on the side of the life support people

575
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
and therefore in the moral right,

576
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
is undercut by the fact that she's trying to enable

577
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
a newly clean person to do drugs with her.

578
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Take your powder, take your candle

579
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Your sweet whisper, I just can't handle

580
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
The film frames it like Roger is refusing to live

581
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
when in reality, he has a very good reason

582
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
not to want to spend any time with Mimi.

583
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Namely, that of staying clean

584
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
and in that regard, has much more in common

585
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
with the people at the life support meeting than with Mimi.

586
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Excuse me if I'm off track

587
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
But if you're so wise, then tell me

588
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Why do you need smack?

589
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Their No Day But Today

590
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
accepts that any day could be their last

591
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
but that doesn't mean they're not going to take care of themselves now.

592
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Mimi's attitude is that you should live for today

593
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
instead of taking care of yourself

594
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
and planning for the future because you can die at any moment

595
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
so you may as well live for the moment and do whatever.

596
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I'm at this moment

597
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
as my last

598
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
The show does this too, perhaps more pointedly

599
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
because rather than Roger's buds

600
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
plus Mimi being the chorus

601
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
a choice which makes no logical sense by the way

602
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Mimi doesn't really know any of these people except Angel but whatever

603
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
In the stage show, the chorus is the entire life support group.

604
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
No day but today

605
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Take your powder

606
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Take your candle

607
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
So the show does the same thing

608
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
only, you know, more.

609
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Roger does eventually help Mimi get clean

610
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
but that doesn't last long

611
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
and eventually contributes to Roger

612
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
leaving New York altogether for like five minutes

613
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
before coming back and finding that Mimi has disappeared

614
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
and fallen down a deep addiction hole

615
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
but they find her and Roger sings at her

616
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
and love saves the day

617
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Mimi

618
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
It should be noted that Mimi nearly dying

619
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
is not brought on by chance like with Angel

620
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
but by her own decision to give up on life

621
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
She goes back to doing drugs

622
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
stops paying her rent

623
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
lives on the street

624
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
stops taking her AIDS medication

625
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
and nearly dies of exposure

626
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
and still, and still

627
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
she survives

628
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
She said

629
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Turn around girlfriend

630
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
and listen

631
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
to that boy's song

632
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And I'm not going to be a total cold hearted monster

633
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
and say that there is no value in that

634
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
you know, only mostly

635
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
because I realized that Rent was not meant to be

636
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
a cautionary tale

637
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
more than anything it was intended to give hope

638
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
to a portion of the young population that felt like it had no voice

639
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
as well as to get a broader audience

640
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
to empathize with that population

641
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Rent is not endeavoring to be realistic

642
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
it endeavors to provide hope

643
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
which it did for many, many people

644
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
hence the no day but today attitude

645
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
being encouraging to those in dire straits

646
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
just because any day could be your last

647
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
does not mean life is not worth living

648
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
However

649
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
However

650
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Roger is doing the actual hard work of self care

651
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
on which Mimi is an unquestionable drain

652
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
which goes completely ignored once we've decided

653
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
that love is the most important thing

654
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
love at all costs, love will save the day

655
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
and again, I'm not saying that all relationships

656
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
portrayed in things need to be

657
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
healthy, but it's kind of like

658
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Twilight, the work doesn't exactly

659
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
frame it like it's a no good very bad idea

660
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I like watching you sleep

661
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Do you do that a lot?

662
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Just the past couple of months

663
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Rent's biggest departure from La Boheme

664
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
is the ending

665
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
See, Boheme ends like this

666
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And Rent ends like this

667
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
And yes, the play ends this way too

668
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I was heading

669
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
towards this warm

670
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
white light

671
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And I swear

672
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Angel was there

673
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And she looked good

674
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
And also this one

675
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
great song that Roger's been trying to write this whole show

676
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
and he finally writes it and sings it

677
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
and it's like the worst one

678
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
How'd I let you

679
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
slip away

680
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
when I'm longing so

681
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
But it

682
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
saves her from the AIDS

683
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
She's fine

684
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And I have wrestled over this

685
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Rent changes fundamentally

686
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
so little from La Boheme

687
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
such to the point that it hardly feels relevant to the late 1980s

688
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
So why

689
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
change this?

690
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Why does Mimi die in La Boheme

691
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
but miraculously gets an AIDS reprieve

692
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
because Roger sings a song at her

693
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I have always

694
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
loved you

695
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
In La Boheme, Mimi is

696
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
a symbol of innocence and purity

697
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
And she just can't survive

698
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
in this tough new Bohemian world

699
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
That's the price of Bohemia

700
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I guess

701
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
But she is not that innocent in Rent

702
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
She's like a druggie

703
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
and a stripper

704
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
So killing her I guess doesn't have that meaning

705
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
about innocence lost or something

706
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
that they were so into in the Victorian era

707
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
So might as well let her live

708
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
and get some empowerment

709
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
out of her being a survivor

710
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Right?

711
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Oh

712
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And she looked good

713
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
But I don't think that is

714
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
really the end of it

715
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I think in Rent it's Angel who is the Mimi

716
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
because Angel gets the angelic Mimi death

717
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Angel gets to be the embodiment

718
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
of goodness where in Rent

719
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Mimi is not that at all

720
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
She is flawed and therefore Angel dies

721
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
instead of Mimi which is noteworthy

722
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
because Angel's counterpart Shunard

723
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
does not die in La Boheme

724
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
In the show it does depend on the actor

725
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
She is a more fleshed out character

726
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
For instance she is a compulsive placater

727
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
who really does not like conflict

728
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
People! Is this a new way to start a new year?

729
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Oh have compassion

730
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And there is a much bigger sense of active agency

731
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
But Chris Columbus's

732
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
interpretation does not exist

733
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
in a character in her own right

734
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
just to be inspiration

735
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
for everyone else and act as like

736
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
a spirit guide after she dies

737
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Angel is there

738
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Chris Columbus's embodiment of goodness and humanity

739
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
is more of a prop than one of the main

740
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
f***ing characters. You know it's like in Pocahontas

741
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
where they were so obsessed with being respectful

742
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
that she has literally no character

743
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
flaws or character

744
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
period. And I think part of that

745
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
is that Chris Columbus never seems entirely

746
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
comfortable with this character just from a cinematography

747
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
standpoint. Take the curious

748
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
decision to shoot I'll Cover You

749
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
as boringly as they did

750
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Eh let's just walk down

751
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
the streets good enough

752
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Look at this it looks like it was shot by an undercover

753
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
PI from across the street

754
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
This is handled better in the show

755
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
which since it's more of an ensemble Angel is more

756
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
of a character on equal footing with everyone else

757
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
and uh yeah she does

758
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
make money killing a dog and

759
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
we are supposed to be charmed by this

760
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
But soon as I am here that dog is

761
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
now in doggy hell. Well this is actually

762
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
an element from La Boheme where instead

763
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
of a dog it's a parrot so let's ignore

764
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
that. So rather than Mimi who in

765
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Boheme is the embodiment of goodness and

766
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
innocence in Rent she is the waif

767
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
who needs to be saved from herself

768
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
with love and Angel

769
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
well Angel becomes

770
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
the tragic figure of goodness and love dying

771
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
because the world is too cruel and corrupt for

772
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
her. So Angel's story is resolved

773
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
with her becoming an

774
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
angel and at the end of the day

775
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
both in the stage show and in the movie

776
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Angel is the character with the least of

777
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
an arc and she just kinda

778
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
goes quietly into that good night

779
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
nobly not mad about

780
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
it or anything no one is mad

781
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
at the system that has failed them

782
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
and here's the thing about the theme of

783
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
affliction. In the 1840's

784
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
no system was going

785
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
to save you from tuberculosis

786
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
so

787
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
while it was a problem

788
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
that they romanticized it the way they did back

789
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
then same rules didn't

790
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
apply so these two themes

791
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
didn't really conflict

792
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
as they do in a story

793
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
about the AIDS crisis in the late 1980's

794
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
music

795
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Man I'm not gonna let

796
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
you poison me

797
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I threw it on the ground

798
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
So I wanna

799
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
talk a little bit about

800
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I ain't gonna be part

801
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
of your system

802
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
that

803
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
pump that garbage in another man's veins

804
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
There's something

805
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
kinda disingenuous when we have a narrative about

806
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
the AIDS crisis and the machine we're

807
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
raging against isn't the FDA

808
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
or pharmaceutical companies or an indifferent

809
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
political machine but

810
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
gentrification namely gentrification that

811
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
affects the privileged white characters

812
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
and the face of the encroaching gentrifying

813
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
class is a black man who is

814
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
pricing out the white boys

815
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
which is another issue all together that reflects

816
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
basically zero of reality of living in New York

817
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
to this day and I don't like it

818
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
God

819
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
there's just so much to hate

820
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
so many things to throw on the ground

821
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
like this and this

822
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
and that and even this

823
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Anyway this whole theme

824
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
of you know poverty versus

825
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
selling out rings pretty hollow

826
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
when you have all these worried parents calling

827
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
constantly. Roger where are you?

828
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Mimi chica. Roger where are you?

829
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Don't make a fuss. Roger where are you?

830
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
To mama. Roger where are you?

831
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And honestly the show

832
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
is way worse for this such to the point

833
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
where I wonder if it isn't trying to highlight our

834
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
hero's hypocrisy as everyone but

835
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
the two adora-gays has family to go back

836
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
to and they're also the only characters

837
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
who really seem to have anything to do with AIDS

838
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
activism. Angel in the form of his support

839
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
group but with Collins the best we get is

840
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
this. Expel me from my theory

841
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
of actual reality. Which we

842
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
can infer has something to do with AIDS activism

843
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
because of this. Actual

844
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
reality. Act up. Fight it.

845
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
He also hints that this is why he

846
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
got expelled from MIT and this is all

847
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
just lines and subtext this isn't

848
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
really explicit and this line

849
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
in La Vie Boheme is the last we see of it

850
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
and in the end Collins honors Angel's

851
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
memory not by doing anything useful

852
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
but by robbing ATMs.

853
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I rewired the ATM at the food emporium

854
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
now he needs a code

855
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
A-N-G-E-L

856
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Yeah that'll get those extortiony

857
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
drug prices down. Hey how were

858
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
every single one of you able to afford AZT

859
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
anyway? Wasn't it like $8,000 a

860
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
year in 1989? AZT

861
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
break. Do you bohemians all just have

862
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
really good health insurance and nobody's talking

863
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
about it because you don't want to admit you're a part

864
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
of the system?

865
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Or that you're getting government assistance and you

866
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
don't want to talk about that because system bad?

867
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I know that shit didn't just fall off the back

868
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
of a truck.

869
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Rent's idea of a revolution is a purely

870
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
symbolic one and

871
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
that's kind of the point. It's built

872
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
to reinforce world views, not

873
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
change anything. Because the reality

874
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
of the AIDS epidemic was not romantic

875
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
tragedy a la Mimi's inevitable fate

876
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
in La Boheme. It was not Manic Pixie

877
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Dream Gaze going quietly into that good

878
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
night, but it was fighting and scratching

879
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
and clawing and quilting

880
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
and demanding that their humanity be recognized

881
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
and not devalued on basis

882
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
of sexual orientation, which it very much

883
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
was in 1989.

884
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
The reality of the AIDS epidemic does

885
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
not work as a fuck the system musical because

886
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
rejecting the system was not what

887
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
eventually changed it. What

888
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
changed it was holding the system to account.

889
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
You have the FDA

890
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
giving you a drug. So far

891
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
you've got AZT.

892
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Which I can't take because it's

893
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
far too toxic.

894
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
The FDA says there is nothing

895
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
else that is

896
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
worth anything. That does not

897
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
mean that there is no place for rent or that you're

898
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
a bad person for liking it or that the music

899
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
isn't catchy. But if you care about

900
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
the subjects that it champions, rent

901
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
is hardly representative.

902
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And that's the real problem with rent. It and

903
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
its narrative has overshadowed and sanitized

904
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
a painful, terrible, uncomfortable history

905
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
that we still live in the shadow

906
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
of. Go read Stage Struck by

907
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Sarah Schulman. It's on Amazon. Or go

908
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
watch How to Survive a Plague. It's on Netflix.

909
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Or Angels in America. It's on HBO Go.

910
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Or even fucking Dallas Buyers Club.

911
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Yes, it has its own problems, but actually

912
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
acknowledges the criminal shortcomings of every power

913
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
structure in place during the height of the AIDS crisis.

914
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
A light, user-friendly sort of anarchy

915
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
does not work in a narrative about the AIDS

916
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
crisis, because there is nothing noble in extolling

917
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
the virtues of quietly giving in to your

918
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
disease when there is a system right there that

919
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
can help and is actively, even

920
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
aggressively, failing you, but you reject it

921
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
because fuck the man. I'm not a part

922
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
of your system.

923
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
And threw it on the ground.

924
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I don't need your protease

925
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
inhibitors. And that is

926
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
what rent the movie ends up being.

927
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Sympathetic to an underclass that was

928
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
violently screwed by the system, but

929
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
ultimately the embodiment of the voice of the

930
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
ruling class. That is why a story

931
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
about homelessness and the AIDS crisis

932
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
ends up being about not

933
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
selling out. It advocates for

934
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
no revolution other than the revolution

935
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
of whatever makes you

936
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
as an individual feel good.

937
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
It reinforces a worldview in which

938
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
the only way to rebel against the system

939
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
is to reject it. And it might feel good

940
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
to throw it on the ground. And throw the rest

941
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
of the cake too.

942
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
It gives you a sense

943
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
of power in a world that makes you feel powerless.

944
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
But in reality, the only thing

945
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
it fosters is actual powerlessness.

946
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Because in rejecting the system,

947
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
you are not only failing to tear it down,

948
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
you are also forfeiting any voice within it.

949
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Rent takes an inherently political

950
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
issue and depoliticizes it to create

951
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
something comforting and consumable.

952
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Rent looks pretty and does

953
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
as little as possible.

954
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I'm starving for attention,

955
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
hating convention, hating pretension,

956
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
not to mention, of course,

957
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
hating dear old E-Mom and Dad.

958
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Plague!

959
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
We are in the middle of a fucking plague!

960
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
And you behave like this!

961
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I'd guard the entodo

962
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
and cover the rainbow

963
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
to blow off empty air.

964
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Plague!

965
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Plague!

966
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Forty million infected

967
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
people is a fucking plague!

968
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
All we can do is field

969
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
a couple hundred people at a demonstration.

970
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
That's not going to make anybody

971
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
pay attention.

972
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Not until

973
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
we get millions out there.

974
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Let the among us

975
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
without sin

976
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
be the first to condemn!

977
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
And I say to you

978
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
in year 10

979
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
the same thing I said to you

980
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
in 1981

981
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
when there were

982
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
41 cases.

983
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Until we get our acts together,

984
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
all of us,

985
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
we are as good

986
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
as dead.

987
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
We want to be

988
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
a man!

989
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Healthcare is a right!

990
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Healthcare is a right!

991
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Healthcare is a right!

992
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Healthcare is a right!

993
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Healthcare is a right!
