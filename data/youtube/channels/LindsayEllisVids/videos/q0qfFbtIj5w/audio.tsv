0	5500	All were angry and many were frightened, and they converged on City Hall demanding and pleading.
5500	9500	And more than 200 were hauled off to the station house.
9500	13500	The first cases of AIDS in the United States were reported in 1981.
13500	17500	By 1983, there were over a thousand reported cases in the U.S.,
17500	20000	and by that point, already half had proven fatal.
20000	23000	Unlike other high-mortality-rate viruses like Ebola,
23000	28500	HIV tended not to be something one may eventually recover from once infected.
29000	33000	Part of the slowed government response was because of the epidemic curve of the HIV virus.
33000	38000	Unlike Ebola virus, it was gradual, with symptoms appearing in a matter of years instead of days.
38000	42000	It's easier for epidemiologists to encourage behavior changes in a population
42000	45000	for an in-your-face disease like smallpox or Ebola virus,
45000	48500	but AIDS, despite its near 100% mortality rate,
48500	53000	was so slow-moving that not only was mass behavior change difficult to encourage,
53000	57000	most people who spread the virus did not themselves even know that they were infected.
57000	60500	Drug use was a risk factor. Unprotected sex was also a risk factor.
60500	63500	But many risk factors were not in people's control.
63500	66500	For instance, the 1980s was not a great time to be a hemophiliac.
66500	69500	But another aspect was the factor that the epicenter of the outbreak
69500	72000	was not in middle-class straight white families,
72000	77000	but the gay community in urban centers like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City.
77000	80000	Since all of the earliest cases were discovered in gay men,
80000	82500	it was easy for lawmakers to moralize the outbreak,
82500	86500	not just as a sexually transmitted disease, but also of moral degeneracy.
86500	90000	Pat Buchanan, who was the leader of White House Communications at the time,
90000	91500	wrote about AIDS,
97000	100000	Reagan didn't seem to understand the seriousness of the epidemic
100000	104000	until his friend Rock Hudson announced that he was HIV positive four years into the epidemic.
104000	107000	But even then it wasn't enough to get the administration to act on it.
107000	111500	Dr. Donald P. Francis, an epidemiologist within the CDC assigned to the AIDS outbreak,
111500	112500	later wrote,
116500	119000	Much like firefighters confronting a fire,
119000	121000	early aggressive action pays off,
121000	124000	whereas slow passive action leads to massive destruction.
124000	127500	The CDC, with the help of Francis, developed a comprehensive plan in 1985
127500	129500	to help stop the spread of HIV,
129500	131500	which had by now infected thousands.
131500	134000	But the Reagan administration rejected it outright.
134000	137000	The administration told epidemiologists within the CDC
137000	140000	to look pretty and do as little as possible.
140000	144000	Surgeon General C. Everett Koop was explicitly banned by the Reagan administration
144000	146000	from addressing the AIDS crisis
146000	150000	when in 1986 he broke with orders and did address what was by now a pandemic.
150000	153000	He was attacked from within all areas of the administration.
153000	156000	The powers that be within the CDC refused to stand up to their bosses
156000	158000	higher up in the Reagan administration.
158000	162000	Director of the CDC James Mason, regarding the CDC's failure to act,
162000	163000	later said,
169000	173500	By the late 1980s, with now hundreds of thousands of new cases of HIV,
173500	176500	it wasn't an issue of passivity, but of active obstruction.
176500	180000	An increasingly popular narrative surrounding the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s
180000	182000	was that there was nothing to be done to stop it,
182000	184000	that the onus was solely on the infected,
184000	186500	and there was nothing but their own behavior to blame.
186500	190000	But the spread of HIV-AIDS in the United States was not inevitable,
190000	192000	and had the powers that be acted sooner,
192000	194500	millions of lives could have been saved.
194500	199000	This is what happens when governments fail the people they are sworn to protect.
203500	208500	Healthcare is a right! Healthcare is a right! Healthcare is a right!
216500	219500	So, yeah, anyway, today we're going to talk about rent.
220500	226500	Let he among us without sin be the first to condemn!
228500	231500	Well, fortunately, I have literally never sinned.
231500	233500	So condemn away I shall.
234000	236500	Okay, so here's the thing, full disclosure,
236500	238500	I have always hated rent,
238500	241000	for basically the same reason I hate Reality Bites.
241000	243500	Yes, even before the movie came out, and yes,
243500	245500	despite the fact that I lived in the East Village of New York City
245500	248500	the first time I saw it on Broadway and was surrounded by rent-heads,
248500	250500	or, hell, maybe even because of that.
250500	252500	And the other thing is, the older I get,
252500	255000	the more things I find about rent that annoy me.
255000	257000	Like, when I was a freshman at NYU,
257000	260000	I was, like, surrounded by these rent-heads who were, like, it me,
260000	263000	and I'm like, well, you know, I guess you're not completely wrong,
263000	265000	you know, trust Fun Babies.
265000	268000	And then later, I eventually burned a bridge over someone
268000	270000	who insisted that rent was beyond criticism
270000	273000	because Jonathan Larson died of AIDS.
273000	276000	He didn't. And even if he did, no.
276000	279000	I actually won the ticket lottery for this sucker twice.
279000	282000	So, sorry, stage-so-apologists, I'm not here for you.
282000	286000	This ain't a stage-show-good-movie-bad kind of episode,
286000	287000	so hunker down, y'all!
288000	293000	Not to mention, of course, hating dear old mom and dad.
293000	296000	Thing is, the movie does exist in a realm of bad,
296000	299000	partially separated from the stage show by virtue of adaptation sickness,
299000	301000	and it is not a good adaptation,
301000	304000	but a lot of my problems with rent are with rent as a whole.
304000	307000	So this one goes out to all the people who asked me to deconstruct rent
307000	309000	like I did with Schumacher's Phantom,
309000	312000	and to you, I say, I can't.
312000	313000	Sorry.
314000	315000	Hey, mister.
315000	317000	She's my sister.
317000	321000	And the truth about rent's adaptation is it's not really that inept.
321000	325000	I mean, although there are some decisions that are like, what?
325000	329000	You're what you are.
329000	331000	But the thing that makes rent the movie fail
331000	334000	is the same basic affliction Phantom suffered from.
334000	338000	The filmmakers didn't know how to translate the stage musical effectively.
338000	340000	And similar to what we discussed with the Phantom adaptation,
340000	343000	its main failure is stripping the source material
343000	346000	of the theatrical elements that make it flow
346000	351000	and replacing it with, you know, mostly montages.
351000	356000	From the soul of a young man.
356000	358000	A young man.
358000	360000	Some on-screen dialogue.
360000	361000	You want me to be your slave?
361000	363000	You want me to just obey your every wish?
363000	369000	More scenes, less singing, setting leases on fire.
369000	373000	But in the end, it has more in common with the adaptation of Les Mis than Phantom.
373000	376000	It's just kind of a boring musical made by a boring filmmaker
376000	379000	who never seemed terribly comfortable with the source material.
379000	381000	And in fairness to the original work,
381000	386000	the movie is much more un-good than the Broadway show.
386000	389000	And it is important to note that rent is one of the first mainstream-ish works
389000	392000	with any kind of substantial LGBT representation.
392000	396000	And hey, this is also one of the rare representations of a bisexual character,
396000	399000	although she, of course, is the slutty McSlutter Slutterson
399000	402000	who wants to slut it up with every living human.
402000	403000	Because, bye.
403000	407000	There will always be women in rubber flirting with me.
407000	409000	Rent was a step.
409000	413000	It was a step in helping to humanize the LGBT community
413000	416000	and urban centers to a broader audience
416000	419000	who might not have humanized them otherwise.
419000	421000	You know, I'm not here to deny that.
421000	423000	That said, I don't have much nice to say about Rent,
423000	427000	so if it was, like, integral to your childhood or something,
427000	429000	you probably might want to sit this one out.
431000	432000	Rent.
432000	434000	If there was one wrong directorial choice
434000	436000	to embody the countercultural discontent of the youngs,
436000	438000	it was Chris Columbus.
438000	441000	Fresh off voice-of-a-generation avant-garde tentpoles
441000	445000	like Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, and the first two Harry Potters.
447000	450000	Hell, maybe that's why Benny, the alleged sellout,
450000	454000	is, unlike the stage show, easily the most sympathetic character in the movie.
454000	457000	Columbus is like, here's a guy who knows what's up.
457000	459000	If you want to produce films and write songs,
459000	461000	you need somewhere to do it.
461000	463000	Invest your money wisely, Benny,
463000	466000	and use that money to fund your passion project five years from now.
466000	468000	And meanwhile, your old friends will still be poor
468000	470000	and wondering why the cruel, cruel world
470000	473000	is forcing them to pay rent to live in a building.
473000	477000	Anyway, I can't speak to your local community theater production of Rent,
477000	480000	but the problems that most people have with Rent
480000	482000	are not necessarily unique to the movie.
482000	484000	Mark, are you there?
484000	486000	Are you screening your call?
486000	487000	It's Mom.
487000	490000	Hi, I just wanted to call and say we love you.
490000	493000	But they are certainly more pronounced.
493000	496000	There are times when we're dirt broke,
496000	498000	and hungry, and freezing,
498000	500000	and I ask myself,
500000	503000	why the hell am I still living here?
504000	506000	And then they call.
506000	508000	F*** you, Mark.
508000	513000	God, this f***ing movie wakes the inner walker-wielding granny in me
513000	515000	yelling at these kids to get off my lawn.
515000	518000	And these damn kids are from the generation before mine.
518000	520000	So yeah, the reason why Rent the movie fails
520000	523000	has a lot in common with why Phantom the movie did not work.
523000	526000	But, you know, we've already covered that ground.
526000	531000	I'm more interested in Rent as part of the grander, counter-cultural canon.
531000	534000	Do you feel left behind by the system?
534000	539000	A system that, say, doesn't take your art seriously,
539000	543000	or maybe failed to act on an epidemic before it became a pandemic.
543000	545000	A system that profited off life-saving drugs,
545000	547000	that failed to fund research.
547000	553000	There are over 140 drugs out there that the FDA has identified as possibilities.
553000	555000	That stigmatized the sick,
555000	559000	that looked the other way when hundreds of thousands of people in our own country were dropping dead.
559000	564000	I think we'd all like a generation-defining musical that really takes the system to task.
564000	566000	But Rent ain't it.
567000	568000	Oh.
575000	577000	Mama who bore me,
577000	580000	Mama who gave me
580000	582000	No way to handle things
582000	584000	Who made me so sad
584000	590000	The stage musical is a popular format to try and capture the discontent of the... something.
590000	596000	It is the music of a people who will not be slaves again
596000	599000	We have been left behind by the system. The musical.
599000	600000	There's a lot of those.
600000	605000	But Rent is literally based on the first we have been left behind by the system.
605000	606000	The musical.
606000	609000	Oh no, c'io milionario
609000	612000	Se fa segno il buon Dio
612000	615000	La Bohème was the original... that.
615000	621000	Puccini's La Bohème was arguably the start of the mainstream counter-cultural Fightin' the Man musical.
621000	625000	It is the basis of not only Rent, but many modern films and musicals.
625000	628000	Most notably Moulin Rouge, which although based on La Traviata,
628000	631000	borrows arguably more from Bohème than Traviata,
631000	634000	or the film from which it takes its name, but not its exclamation point.
634000	637000	I'd summarize the plot, but it's basically identical to Rent.
637000	640000	Swap out tuberculosis with AIDS, the Latin Quarter with Alphabet City,
640000	644000	the 1840s with the 1980s, and Americanify the characters' names a bit.
644000	645000	I'm Roger
645000	648000	Puccini's Bohème was popular because its characters were relatable,
648000	650000	and the story was emotionally charged.
650000	654000	The real revelation here is that his opera is about an underclass.
654000	656000	He isn't writing about kings or dukes,
656000	659000	but about starving artists who feel that they've been left behind.
659000	663000	It is truly a universal story, translatable to any era.
663000	666000	Phantom of the Opera also draws a lot of inspiration from Bohème
666000	670000	in that it goes a long way with raw, simple, shallow emotionality.
673000	675000	But the difference between Phantom and Rent is
675000	678000	Phantom wasn't trying to make a grand statement about society.
678000	681000	And the truth is, La Bohème isn't either. Not really.
681000	684000	It exists more in the same vein as Moulin Rouge.
684000	686000	You're the voice of the children of the revolution!
686000	688000	But what is the revolution?
688000	692000	I mean, it's not a socialist revolution, or a class revolution, or...
692000	694000	We have freedom!
694000	699000	Beauty, truth, and love!
701000	702000	Okay.
702000	705000	See, they use terms like revolution in Moulin Rouge,
705000	709000	but really, it's about emotionality with an artistic movement set as the backdrop.
709000	712000	Shows like this have romantic ideas in the guise of revolution,
712000	714000	but none of them challenge any existing power structures
714000	717000	in a way that might alienate the wealthy audience,
717000	719000	especially as portrayed in the movie.
719000	723000	In Cyberland, we only drink...
725000	726000	Diet Coke.
727000	729000	Yeah, that'll show The Man.
729000	731000	Look at those monocles poppin' everywhere.
731000	733000	Every decade sorta had its own.
733000	736000	The 1960s had Hair, the 70s Jesus Christ Superstar,
736000	739000	80s had Les Mis, 90s had Rent, 2000s...
739000	742000	wanted to have Spring Awakening, but really, they had Avenue Q.
742000	747000	They all tried to capture the voice of the class of youngs that feel left out of the system.
747000	752000	Although, all of these are what George Ishikawa has called bourgeois or finished theater.
755000	757000	In other words, they frame themselves as revolutionary,
757000	762000	but continue to push the voice, worldview, and values of the status quo.
762000	767000	In this case, middle-class white kids who want to pass off their home movies as true art.
767000	770000	From here on in, I shoot without a script.
770000	773000	Without a script? Oh, Mark, you visionary.
774000	777000	See, this is what I mean when I say that Rent's primary purpose
777000	780000	is to validate a certain subsect of the theater going public
780000	783000	rather than bring any theater of the oppressed to the amasses.
783000	787000	This is an idea developed by revolutionary Brazilian dramatist Augusto Bol,
787000	789000	who developed the idea of theater of the oppressed.
789000	794000	And Bol takes a Marxist reading to pretty much all theater on this subject, so bear that in mind.
794000	798000	Echoing Marx, Bol argues that the dominant art is the art of the dominant class,
798000	800000	who control the means to disseminate art.
800000	802000	In this case, Broadway shows.
802000	806000	All of these shows revolve around the social discontent of some underclass,
806000	810000	but the shows did not reach the mainstream because some underclass propelled them there.
810000	812000	Rent did claw its way up from off-Broadway, yes,
812000	815000	but only because it found success with the people who had money.
815000	821000	Only thing to do is jump over the moon.
821000	825000	Hamilton is a perfect example of this phenomenon in action right now.
825000	827000	High demand and extremely limited quantities
827000	830000	mean that only the wealthy control access to the stage show.
830000	833000	A lottery system does exist that sells tickets for $10,
833000	837000	but there are 21 of these tickets per show and thousands of entrants.
837000	841000	Real access comes in the form of people with thousands of dollars to drop on tickets.
841000	845000	And because Broadway shows are so uniquely expensive in terms of consumable art,
845000	848000	they have to walk a fine line between being trendy,
848000	850000	maybe even a little edgy,
850000	853000	but not enough to put the people with money outside of their comfort zones.
853000	857000	It presents a multi-culti hip-hop narrative about the life of Alexander Hamilton
857000	859000	and the foundation of the country,
859000	863000	but it is ultimately really, really reassuring about the American experiment.
863000	867000	Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?
867000	870000	Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?
870000	872000	The ruling class does.
872000	875000	You remember you belong to me.
875000	877000	If you want people to hear your message,
877000	880000	it first has to get the okay from your wealthy patrons.
880000	883000	I mean, it's no coincidence that the first hip-hop musical to become a huge hit
883000	885000	happens to be about the whitest thing ever.
885000	888000	And Hamilton is excellent, don't get me wrong.
888000	891000	It's just not here to challenge any ideas on American exceptionalism
891000	893000	or start any revolutions.
893000	896000	I'm with you, but the situation is fraught.
896000	898000	You've got to be carefully taught.
898000	900000	If you talk, you're gonna get shot.
900000	905000	Does every musical need to necessarily challenge the culture it's trying to sell itself to?
905000	906000	God, no.
906000	909000	I mean, how else would I see Phantom for the 20th time?
909000	913000	One time only!
913000	917000	But anyway, not every musical, even the ones with explicit revolutionary text,
917000	919000	needs to be trying to tear down the system.
919000	923000	But what would a revolution look like if it had been included in Rent
923000	928000	rather than the subtext being reject the system instead of change it?
928000	934000	Well, probably what was going down in Alphabet City in the 80s in the real world.
934000	938000	Thousands of demonstrators demand that New York City do more
938000	940000	to help those suffering from AIDS.
940000	943000	Protests, societal upheaval, all those unpretty things
943000	946000	that were very much going on during the AIDS crisis,
946000	948000	they were not designed to make the type of person
948000	951000	with hundreds of dollars to drop on a Broadway show ticket comfortable.
951000	954000	Do you think you've really accomplished a great deal?
954000	957000	Yes, I think we do. What else can we do?
957000	962000	But Les Mis does not position itself in opposition to the culture it is trying to sell itself to.
962000	964000	Neither does Hamilton.
965000	967000	But Rent does.
973000	977000	And if your musical spins its entirety dressing down the phony baloney culture
977000	981000	while at the same time kind of being its very embodiment,
981000	983000	then we may need to have words.
988000	991000	Rent the Broadway Musical was met with much more universal acclaim
991000	994000	Rent the Broadway Musical was met with much more universal acclaim
994000	996000	than Bohem a century prior.
996000	1000000	It wasn't for another couple of years until we started seeing pushback against Rent.
1000000	1003000	The movie was what made society as a whole really start to turn on Rent.
1003000	1005000	So thank you for that movie.
1009000	1011000	See, Rent's heyday came and went,
1011000	1013000	and a few more years passed,
1013000	1015000	and then another few more years passed,
1015000	1020000	and then they threw another few years on for posterity.
1020000	1023000	And they made the movie with the original cast.
1023000	1025000	So by the time the movie comes out, it's like,
1025000	1030000	yeah, sure, sure, you're in your 20s.
1035000	1038000	And they went hard trying to keep the original cast,
1038000	1040000	which was just weird.
1040000	1043000	Rosario Dawson and Tracy Toms are the only people who seem happy to be here.
1043000	1047000	Everyone else is in their 30s, and they've moved on with their careers,
1047000	1051000	but here they are, pretending to be in their early 20s, and it's weird.
1051000	1054000	Many of the songs are cut and turned into dialogue,
1054000	1057000	which makes for an even draggier experience than it might have been.
1057000	1060000	Even with the opening number, when they are asking themselves,
1060000	1063000	how we gonna pay, how we gonna pay next year's Rent?
1066000	1068000	Rent, Rent, Rent, Rent, Rent, Rent, Rent.
1068000	1072000	The music is arranged similarly to the shows, which is a group number.
1072000	1075000	But in the show, everyone in the neighborhood doesn't all collectively decide
1075000	1077000	to stop paying rent at the same time.
1077000	1079000	It's more like, you know, like a Greek choir type thing.
1079000	1082000	Unlike in the movie, where it appears to be a riot.
1082000	1085000	And like, okay, so Benny turns off their heat, right?
1085000	1088000	So they have to burn their precious art creations for warmth.
1088000	1090000	This is also lifted directly from La Boheme.
1090000	1092000	This is how that starts. Burning our art for warmth.
1092000	1094000	It's like an irony thing.
1094000	1096000	But then they throw it out the window.
1100000	1103000	I mean, the whole thing is full of adaptive changes
1103000	1105000	that don't really stand up to modest scrutiny.
1105000	1108000	Joanne and Maureen's relationship never gets resolved in the movie.
1108000	1113000	Like, they break up and then are together again at the end when they find Mimi.
1113000	1116000	I guess they get back together off-screen somewhere.
1116000	1120000	This works better in the show because they break up and get back together constantly,
1120000	1121000	and that's the joke.
1126000	1128000	The movie starts with Seasons of Love,
1128000	1130000	which is an odd decision as the whole point of that song
1130000	1133000	is that it happens after intermission to impart that a year has passed.
1133000	1137000	So at the front of the movie, it's just like a song that's there.
1137000	1140000	But people know it, so let's start with that, I guess.
1140000	1144000	Lots of 2005 vehicles here in 1989.
1144000	1146000	Nobody has 80s hair.
1146000	1149000	Mark's camera has no sound recording apparatus.
1149000	1152000	Why are we taking a train to life support if everything's in Alphabet City?
1152000	1155000	A neighborhood with no train access.
1155000	1159000	Roger returns to Manhattan from Santa Fe via the Williamsburg Bridge.
1159000	1162000	Some of the worst CGI cold-weather breath in history of moviedom.
1162000	1165000	Lazy, uncreative use of your setting.
1165000	1168000	Or just strange use of setting.
1173000	1176000	Is he about to try to sell me a really manly truck?
1176000	1179000	There are a lot of problems with Rent that are movie-specific,
1179000	1182000	but my interest is more comprehensive.
1182000	1185000	And it starts with the fact that...
1190000	1193000	Dorothy and Toto went over the rainbow
1193000	1196000	To blow off fancy air
1196000	1199000	Rent is a musical about selfish, horrible people,
1199000	1201000	framed like freedom fighters.
1201000	1204000	They show profound entitlement over other people's rights and property,
1204000	1207000	but it is framed like romantic rebelliousness.
1207000	1209000	A restaurant owner begs them,
1209000	1211000	please don't patronize our restaurant, please.
1211000	1213000	Please, no, no, not tonight. Please leave.
1213000	1216000	They then ignore him when he asks them not to move the tables around.
1216000	1218000	Please don't move the tables.
1218000	1220000	Hey, Rosie, let's put these tables together.
1220000	1222000	No, no, no, no.
1222000	1226000	Maureen is an emotionally abusive cheater who gaslights all of her partners.
1226000	1229000	Angel comes into wealth at the beginning by killing a dog.
1229000	1232000	But sure as I am here, that dog is now in doggy hell.
1232000	1235000	Mimi is a self-destructive codependent enabler.
1235000	1237000	Collins honors the memory of his dead lover
1237000	1240000	by hotwiring a local ATM to dispense cash for him and his friends
1240000	1242000	when you plug his name in.
1242000	1245000	I rewired the ATM at the food employee.
1245000	1249000	Now he needs the code A-N-G-E-L.
1249000	1252000	And Mark. Sweet Mark.
1252000	1255000	You might be the worst thing to have ever happened.
1255000	1258000	And you are... I'm just here to...
1258000	1262000	To appropriate your tragedy for my art without having obtained permission.
1262000	1263000	I hope that's cool.
1263000	1265000	Rent the Movie really has two stories that don't mesh
1265000	1267000	when you give it more than a passing thought.
1267000	1269000	The story of the tragic AIDS havers
1269000	1272000	and the love triangle between Joanne, Mark, and Maureen.
1272000	1274000	And these two things have nothing to do with each other
1274000	1277000	besides that they know each other.
1277000	1280000	But really, Mark and Maureen, while they feel bad for the AIDS havers,
1280000	1285000	I guess their stories are more about their poetry and their art.
1285000	1291000	I gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha!
1291000	1295000	Mark has his aimless documentary and Maureen her terrible performance art.
1295000	1298000	Both have loving support structures and come from wealthy families
1298000	1301000	and none of these people have AIDS or really any reason not to pay the rent
1301000	1303000	other than the fact that they feel they shouldn't have to
1303000	1305000	because art and selling out are something.
1305000	1309000	And I ask myself, why the hell am I still living here?
1309000	1311000	Fuck you!
1311000	1313000	You know that song, Common People?
1313000	1316000	Still you'll never get it right
1316000	1319000	It's when you're late in bed at night
1319000	1323000	Watching roaches climb the wall
1323000	1327000	If you called your dad he could stop it, oh yeah
1327000	1329000	Aw, look Mark, someone wrote a song about you.
1329000	1331000	In the show it's more obvious that Maureen is terrible
1331000	1335000	and kind of a narcissist, and this is really a pastiche of bad performance art.
1335000	1339000	Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha!
1339000	1341000	Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha!
1341000	1344000	But in the movie it is played dead fucking straight.
1344000	1351000	And the suits are in the audience blown away by how real she is.
1351000	1353000	Moo with me
1353000	1356000	Laterate, no!
1356000	1358000	They're mooing with her.
1359000	1363000	Now, the fact that they are horrible need not be a problem.
1363000	1366000	I need your help to make my neighbor's yappy dog disappear.
1366000	1369000	Or even that their horribleness goes unexamined by the characters.
1369000	1372000	That is, after all, a condition of human behavior.
1372000	1376000	But the problem, like the faux-revolutionary subtext, is with the framing.
1376000	1379000	The show doesn't really go anywhere with this.
1379000	1383000	This type of character is much more effectively explored in Trainspotting.
1383000	1386000	In Trainspotting, you are meant to relate to the characters, sure,
1386000	1389000	but it makes no pretense of them being idealists or good people.
1389000	1393000	It much more successfully dresses down the phoniness of the society that they reject.
1393000	1398000	Choose life, choose a job, choose a career, choose a family,
1398000	1401000	choose a fucking big television, choose washing machines, cars,
1401000	1403000	compact displayers and electrical tin openers.
1403000	1407000	But at the same time, it doesn't dress them up like they are legitimately too good for society.
1407000	1409000	They are very obviously not.
1409000	1413000	So, Rent presents us with a worldview that validates the characters rather than challenges them.
1413000	1416000	And romantic validation is part of what made Rent so popular.
1416000	1418000	You know, similar to Bowen before it.
1418000	1421000	But there are ways that this sort of thing can be...
1421000	1423000	maybe a little contradictory.
1434000	1437000	Yes, we are so counter-cultural, like in this scene.
1437000	1441000	The nadir of the film, where they dance on the table
1441000	1446000	while the pearl-clutching suits are scandalized by the interests of the Bohemians.
1450000	1452000	Like, huevos rancheros.
1454000	1456000	Yeah, eating disorders!
1457000	1458000	Woo!
1458000	1463000	Rent's primary theme comes from the conflict between Bohemian ideals
1463000	1467000	and selling out for financial security.
1467000	1468000	What rent?
1468000	1470000	This past year's rent which I let slide.
1470000	1473000	Yeah, they don't want to pay rent because their friend who owns the building
1473000	1476000	has reneged on a deal he made with them that they can live there rent-free.
1476000	1479000	But there is this underlying entitlement that these guys have
1479000	1481000	that they shouldn't have to pay rent
1481000	1484000	because they're artists and they don't sell out.
1484000	1486000	Get off my lawn!
1486000	1489000	Because working for a show like BuzzLine is completely selling out.
1489000	1492000	Mark has among the worst resolution to his subplot.
1492000	1495000	Particularly frustrating to those of us working in journalism today.
1495000	1497000	Start at $3,000?
1497000	1500000	He works for a sort of proto-TMZ-style news organization
1500000	1502000	and makes bank doing it,
1502000	1505000	but he doesn't like having a job in his chosen field of study
1505000	1507000	because selling out.
1507000	1508000	I sold my soul.
1508000	1509000	Oh, poor baby.
1509000	1512000	You have to work your way up from a job you don't really like
1512000	1517000	in your chosen field that pays really well as a starting point for your career?
1517000	1520000	If I need to finish my own film, I quit!
1520000	1522000	Mark, you are the worst.
1522000	1524000	There is a big homeless subplot,
1524000	1526000	but it's much bigger in the stage show than the movie.
1526000	1532000	No room at the Holiday Inn, oh no!
1532000	1535000	But the big thing that is pointed out by this character,
1535000	1536000	but goes oddly unexamined,
1536000	1540000	is the fact that none of these people really care about the homeless.
1540000	1542000	Who do you think you are?
1542000	1546000	I don't need no goddamn help from some bleeding heart cameraman.
1546000	1549000	My life's not for you to make a name for yourself for.
1549000	1551000	Easy, sugar, easy. He was just trying...
1551000	1553000	Just trying to use me to kill his guilt.
1553000	1556000	Mark getting called out on it doesn't prompt any change in behavior.
1556000	1558000	Maureen really doesn't give a shit about their plight.
1558000	1562000	She only cares about her performance space not being taken from her.
1562000	1564000	The tent city is just a backdrop.
1564000	1566000	The problem with the theme of selling out for security
1566000	1570000	versus adhering to your precious ideals while living in poverty,
1570000	1573000	with the backdrop of a massive homeless subplot,
1573000	1576000	which was not there in La Boheme, by the by,
1576000	1580000	is that it infers that poverty is a choice, and a noble one at that.
1580000	1584000	Which, sure, Mark has a choice as to whether or not to live in poverty.
1584000	1587000	Pretty much all of the characters do, except Angel and Collins.
1587000	1589000	But the homeless do not choose to live on the street
1589000	1591000	in order to uphold their Bohemian ideals.
1591000	1594000	So right there we have thematic dissonance number one.
1594000	1596000	Choosing to live in poverty and romanticizing it
1596000	1599000	while surrounded by those living in poverty who do not have a choice,
1599000	1602000	and are repulsed by your romanticizing their tragedy, Mark.
1602000	1605000	Hey, artist! You got a dollar?
1608000	1609000	Didn't think so.
1609000	1612000	Yeah, this prompts no change in him, and is the last time it gets brought up.
1612000	1615000	The second major theme is that of affliction.
1615000	1618000	La Boheme is set against the backdrop of tuberculosis,
1618000	1622000	rent of AIDS, which afflicts far more characters in Rent than TB did in Boheme.
1622000	1627000	So when you have theme one over here, and theme two over here,
1627000	1631000	this is where we really start kind of running into problems.
1631000	1634000	Mark Cohen's character arc, played up in the movie to the point
1634000	1637000	where, unlike in the show, he is the explicit protagonist,
1637000	1640000	reminds me so much of Lelena in Reality Bites.
1640000	1642000	They both exploit their parents,
1642000	1646000	neither want to sell out their precious art or play by the rules of fucking society,
1646000	1650000	steal shit, know they'll get away with any rules broken
1650000	1653000	because they're white kids who come from wealthy families,
1653000	1655000	and their approach to documentary is just...
1659000	1663000	Shoot whatever and call it art because it exists, and I made it.
1663000	1666000	From here on in, I shoot without a script.
1667000	1669000	To quote Nathan Rabin, last time I checked,
1669000	1672000	those are called home fucking movies and nobody thinks that's high art.
1672000	1675000	So we suffer in the cold and ignore our loving families
1675000	1678000	because suffering equals art, and the homeless are suffering,
1678000	1680000	and we like them because suffering equals art,
1680000	1683000	and as long as they don't expect us to recognize their needs as humans,
1683000	1687000	then hey, maybe they don't think suffering is all that artistic, you assholes.
1687000	1690000	So in Rent, poverty, despite being confronted on how shitty it is
1690000	1693000	to try to appropriate someone else's suffering, Mark,
1693000	1695000	is always justified because art,
1695000	1698000	and capitalist society is always out to consume you,
1698000	1700000	which is why you own nothing, you rent,
1700000	1704000	therefore you are always justified in taking anything you can from society.
1704000	1706000	I rewired the ATM at the food employee.
1706000	1711000	It's not stealing because you're an artist and the rules don't apply to you.
1711000	1714000	You know, poverty is not romantic.
1714000	1716000	Just throwing it out there.
1716000	1719000	Anyway, let's tie that back in with the theme of affliction.
1723000	1728000	Affliction
1728000	1734000	No day but today
1734000	1737000	A big theme in Rent is presented in the no day but today motif,
1737000	1740000	with the central conflict of Mimi and Roger's relationship
1740000	1743000	being planning for an uncertain future versus living for the now.
1743000	1745000	Problem here is Rent doesn't try to find a balance,
1745000	1749000	but rather that planning for the future thing tends to be painted in a more negative light,
1749000	1751000	especially where Benny is concerned.
1751000	1753000	You make fun, yet I'm the one
1753000	1756000	Attempting to do some good
1756000	1758000	Or do you really want a neighborhood
1758000	1762000	Where people piss on your stoop every night
1762000	1765000	The no day but today motif is seen in the life support group,
1765000	1769000	No day but today
1769000	1772000	and in the interactions between Roger and Mimi,
1772000	1776000	a bad idea of a relationship that at least one of them gets some bad juju about,
1776000	1777000	but here we go anyway.
1777000	1779000	Your smile reminded me
1779000	1781000	I always remind people of
1781000	1783000	It's almost like I have a type
1783000	1786000	And I'm drawn to self-destructive addicts
1786000	1788000	See, Roger's ex-girlfriend committed suicide
1788000	1791000	after finding out that both she and Roger have AIDS.
1791000	1793000	The suicide part's not clear in the movie, by the by.
1793000	1796000	His girlfriend April left a note
1796000	1798000	Saying we've got AIDS
1798000	1801000	Before slitting her wrists in the bathroom
1801000	1804000	So the first time we see the no day but today motif
1804000	1806000	is used at Angel's life support meeting.
1806000	1808000	In the very next scene, we see it again
1808000	1811000	when Mimi is trying to get Roger to do drugs with her.
1811000	1814000	Forget, regret
1814000	1817000	All life is yours to miss
1817000	1819000	There is an honesty here,
1819000	1821000	like that Roger wants to be with her
1821000	1824000	but isn't allowing himself to because he's afraid to live
1824000	1826000	and Mimi's trying to get him to open up.
1826000	1828000	However, this doesn't really work because
1828000	1830000	this very simple framing,
1830000	1832000	the fact that Mimi is on the side of the life support people
1832000	1834000	and therefore in the moral right,
1834000	1836000	is undercut by the fact that she's trying to enable
1836000	1838000	a newly clean person to do drugs with her.
1838000	1841000	Take your powder, take your candle
1841000	1844000	Your sweet whisper, I just can't handle
1844000	1847000	The film frames it like Roger is refusing to live
1847000	1849000	when in reality, he has a very good reason
1849000	1850000	not to want to spend any time with Mimi.
1850000	1852000	Namely, that of staying clean
1852000	1854000	and in that regard, has much more in common
1854000	1856000	with the people at the life support meeting than with Mimi.
1856000	1859000	Excuse me if I'm off track
1859000	1861000	But if you're so wise, then tell me
1861000	1863000	Why do you need smack?
1863000	1865000	Their No Day But Today
1865000	1867000	accepts that any day could be their last
1867000	1869000	but that doesn't mean they're not going to take care of themselves now.
1869000	1871000	Mimi's attitude is that you should live for today
1871000	1873000	instead of taking care of yourself
1873000	1875000	and planning for the future because you can die at any moment
1875000	1877000	so you may as well live for the moment and do whatever.
1877000	1879000	I'm at this moment
1879000	1884000	as my last
1884000	1886000	The show does this too, perhaps more pointedly
1886000	1888000	because rather than Roger's buds
1888000	1890000	plus Mimi being the chorus
1890000	1892000	a choice which makes no logical sense by the way
1892000	1894000	Mimi doesn't really know any of these people except Angel but whatever
1894000	1896000	In the stage show, the chorus is the entire life support group.
1896000	1898000	No day but today
1898000	1900000	Take your powder
1900000	1902000	Take your candle
1902000	1904000	So the show does the same thing
1904000	1906000	only, you know, more.
1906000	1908000	Roger does eventually help Mimi get clean
1908000	1910000	but that doesn't last long
1910000	1912000	and eventually contributes to Roger
1912000	1914000	leaving New York altogether for like five minutes
1914000	1916000	before coming back and finding that Mimi has disappeared
1916000	1918000	and fallen down a deep addiction hole
1918000	1920000	but they find her and Roger sings at her
1920000	1922000	and love saves the day
1922000	1924000	Mimi
1924000	1926000	It should be noted that Mimi nearly dying
1926000	1928000	is not brought on by chance like with Angel
1928000	1930000	but by her own decision to give up on life
1930000	1932000	She goes back to doing drugs
1932000	1934000	stops paying her rent
1934000	1936000	lives on the street
1936000	1938000	stops taking her AIDS medication
1938000	1940000	and nearly dies of exposure
1940000	1942000	and still, and still
1942000	1944000	she survives
1944000	1946000	She said
1946000	1948000	Turn around girlfriend
1948000	1950000	and listen
1950000	1952000	to that boy's song
1954000	1956000	And I'm not going to be a total cold hearted monster
1956000	1958000	and say that there is no value in that
1958000	1960000	you know, only mostly
1960000	1962000	because I realized that Rent was not meant to be
1962000	1964000	a cautionary tale
1964000	1966000	more than anything it was intended to give hope
1966000	1968000	to a portion of the young population that felt like it had no voice
1968000	1970000	as well as to get a broader audience
1970000	1972000	to empathize with that population
1972000	1974000	Rent is not endeavoring to be realistic
1974000	1976000	it endeavors to provide hope
1976000	1978000	which it did for many, many people
1978000	1980000	hence the no day but today attitude
1980000	1982000	being encouraging to those in dire straits
1982000	1984000	just because any day could be your last
1984000	1986000	does not mean life is not worth living
1994000	1996000	However
1996000	1998000	However
1998000	2000000	Roger is doing the actual hard work of self care
2000000	2002000	on which Mimi is an unquestionable drain
2002000	2004000	which goes completely ignored once we've decided
2004000	2006000	that love is the most important thing
2006000	2008000	love at all costs, love will save the day
2008000	2010000	and again, I'm not saying that all relationships
2010000	2012000	portrayed in things need to be
2012000	2014000	healthy, but it's kind of like
2014000	2016000	Twilight, the work doesn't exactly
2016000	2018000	frame it like it's a no good very bad idea
2018000	2020000	I like watching you sleep
2020000	2022000	Do you do that a lot?
2024000	2026000	Just the past couple of months
2035000	2037000	Rent's biggest departure from La Boheme
2037000	2039000	is the ending
2039000	2041000	See, Boheme ends like this
2047000	2049000	And Rent ends like this
2058000	2060000	And yes, the play ends this way too
2060000	2062000	I was heading
2062000	2064000	towards this warm
2064000	2066000	white light
2066000	2068000	And I swear
2068000	2070000	Angel was there
2070000	2072000	And she looked good
2072000	2074000	And also this one
2074000	2076000	great song that Roger's been trying to write this whole show
2076000	2078000	and he finally writes it and sings it
2078000	2080000	and it's like the worst one
2080000	2082000	How'd I let you
2082000	2084000	slip away
2084000	2086000	when I'm longing so
2086000	2088000	But it
2088000	2090000	saves her from the AIDS
2090000	2092000	She's fine
2092000	2094000	And I have wrestled over this
2094000	2096000	Rent changes fundamentally
2096000	2098000	so little from La Boheme
2098000	2100000	such to the point that it hardly feels relevant to the late 1980s
2100000	2102000	So why
2102000	2104000	change this?
2104000	2106000	Why does Mimi die in La Boheme
2106000	2108000	but miraculously gets an AIDS reprieve
2108000	2110000	because Roger sings a song at her
2110000	2112000	I have always
2112000	2114000	loved you
2114000	2116000	In La Boheme, Mimi is
2116000	2118000	a symbol of innocence and purity
2118000	2120000	And she just can't survive
2120000	2122000	in this tough new Bohemian world
2122000	2124000	That's the price of Bohemia
2124000	2126000	I guess
2126000	2128000	But she is not that innocent in Rent
2128000	2130000	She's like a druggie
2130000	2132000	and a stripper
2132000	2134000	So killing her I guess doesn't have that meaning
2134000	2136000	about innocence lost or something
2136000	2138000	that they were so into in the Victorian era
2138000	2140000	So might as well let her live
2140000	2142000	and get some empowerment
2142000	2144000	out of her being a survivor
2144000	2146000	Right?
2146000	2148000	Oh
2148000	2150000	And she looked good
2150000	2152000	But I don't think that is
2152000	2154000	really the end of it
2154000	2156000	I think in Rent it's Angel who is the Mimi
2156000	2158000	because Angel gets the angelic Mimi death
2158000	2160000	Angel gets to be the embodiment
2160000	2162000	of goodness where in Rent
2162000	2164000	Mimi is not that at all
2164000	2166000	She is flawed and therefore Angel dies
2166000	2168000	instead of Mimi which is noteworthy
2168000	2170000	because Angel's counterpart Shunard
2170000	2172000	does not die in La Boheme
2172000	2174000	In the show it does depend on the actor
2174000	2176000	She is a more fleshed out character
2176000	2178000	For instance she is a compulsive placater
2178000	2180000	who really does not like conflict
2180000	2182000	People! Is this a new way to start a new year?
2182000	2184000	Oh have compassion
2184000	2186000	And there is a much bigger sense of active agency
2186000	2188000	But Chris Columbus's
2188000	2190000	interpretation does not exist
2190000	2192000	in a character in her own right
2192000	2194000	just to be inspiration
2194000	2196000	for everyone else and act as like
2196000	2198000	a spirit guide after she dies
2198000	2200000	Angel is there
2200000	2202000	Chris Columbus's embodiment of goodness and humanity
2202000	2204000	is more of a prop than one of the main
2204000	2206000	f***ing characters. You know it's like in Pocahontas
2206000	2208000	where they were so obsessed with being respectful
2208000	2210000	that she has literally no character
2210000	2212000	flaws or character
2212000	2214000	period. And I think part of that
2214000	2216000	is that Chris Columbus never seems entirely
2216000	2218000	comfortable with this character just from a cinematography
2218000	2220000	standpoint. Take the curious
2220000	2222000	decision to shoot I'll Cover You
2222000	2224000	as boringly as they did
2226000	2228000	Eh let's just walk down
2228000	2230000	the streets good enough
2230000	2232000	Look at this it looks like it was shot by an undercover
2232000	2234000	PI from across the street
2234000	2236000	This is handled better in the show
2236000	2238000	which since it's more of an ensemble Angel is more
2238000	2240000	of a character on equal footing with everyone else
2240000	2242000	and uh yeah she does
2242000	2244000	make money killing a dog and
2244000	2246000	we are supposed to be charmed by this
2246000	2248000	But soon as I am here that dog is
2248000	2250000	now in doggy hell. Well this is actually
2250000	2252000	an element from La Boheme where instead
2252000	2254000	of a dog it's a parrot so let's ignore
2254000	2256000	that. So rather than Mimi who in
2256000	2258000	Boheme is the embodiment of goodness and
2258000	2260000	innocence in Rent she is the waif
2260000	2262000	who needs to be saved from herself
2262000	2264000	with love and Angel
2264000	2266000	well Angel becomes
2266000	2268000	the tragic figure of goodness and love dying
2268000	2270000	because the world is too cruel and corrupt for
2270000	2272000	her. So Angel's story is resolved
2272000	2274000	with her becoming an
2274000	2276000	angel and at the end of the day
2276000	2278000	both in the stage show and in the movie
2278000	2280000	Angel is the character with the least of
2280000	2282000	an arc and she just kinda
2282000	2284000	goes quietly into that good night
2284000	2286000	nobly not mad about
2286000	2288000	it or anything no one is mad
2288000	2290000	at the system that has failed them
2290000	2292000	and here's the thing about the theme of
2292000	2294000	affliction. In the 1840's
2294000	2296000	no system was going
2296000	2298000	to save you from tuberculosis
2298000	2300000	so
2300000	2302000	while it was a problem
2302000	2304000	that they romanticized it the way they did back
2304000	2306000	then same rules didn't
2306000	2308000	apply so these two themes
2308000	2310000	didn't really conflict
2310000	2312000	as they do in a story
2312000	2314000	about the AIDS crisis in the late 1980's
2316000	2318000	music
2322000	2324000	Man I'm not gonna let
2324000	2326000	you poison me
2326000	2328000	I threw it on the ground
2328000	2330000	So I wanna
2330000	2332000	talk a little bit about
2332000	2334000	I ain't gonna be part
2334000	2336000	of your system
2336000	2338000	that
2338000	2340000	pump that garbage in another man's veins
2340000	2342000	There's something
2342000	2344000	kinda disingenuous when we have a narrative about
2344000	2346000	the AIDS crisis and the machine we're
2346000	2348000	raging against isn't the FDA
2348000	2350000	or pharmaceutical companies or an indifferent
2350000	2352000	political machine but
2352000	2354000	gentrification namely gentrification that
2354000	2356000	affects the privileged white characters
2356000	2358000	and the face of the encroaching gentrifying
2358000	2360000	class is a black man who is
2360000	2362000	pricing out the white boys
2362000	2364000	which is another issue all together that reflects
2364000	2366000	basically zero of reality of living in New York
2366000	2368000	to this day and I don't like it
2368000	2370000	God
2370000	2372000	there's just so much to hate
2372000	2374000	so many things to throw on the ground
2374000	2376000	like this and this
2376000	2378000	and that and even this
2378000	2380000	Anyway this whole theme
2380000	2382000	of you know poverty versus
2382000	2384000	selling out rings pretty hollow
2384000	2386000	when you have all these worried parents calling
2386000	2388000	constantly. Roger where are you?
2388000	2390000	Mimi chica. Roger where are you?
2390000	2392000	Don't make a fuss. Roger where are you?
2392000	2394000	To mama. Roger where are you?
2394000	2396000	And honestly the show
2396000	2398000	is way worse for this such to the point
2398000	2400000	where I wonder if it isn't trying to highlight our
2400000	2402000	hero's hypocrisy as everyone but
2402000	2404000	the two adora-gays has family to go back
2404000	2406000	to and they're also the only characters
2406000	2408000	who really seem to have anything to do with AIDS
2408000	2410000	activism. Angel in the form of his support
2410000	2412000	group but with Collins the best we get is
2412000	2414000	this. Expel me from my theory
2414000	2416000	of actual reality. Which we
2416000	2418000	can infer has something to do with AIDS activism
2418000	2420000	because of this. Actual
2420000	2422000	reality. Act up. Fight it.
2422000	2424000	He also hints that this is why he
2424000	2426000	got expelled from MIT and this is all
2426000	2428000	just lines and subtext this isn't
2428000	2430000	really explicit and this line
2430000	2432000	in La Vie Boheme is the last we see of it
2432000	2434000	and in the end Collins honors Angel's
2434000	2436000	memory not by doing anything useful
2436000	2438000	but by robbing ATMs.
2438000	2440000	I rewired the ATM at the food emporium
2440000	2442000	now he needs a code
2442000	2444000	A-N-G-E-L
2444000	2446000	Yeah that'll get those extortiony
2446000	2448000	drug prices down. Hey how were
2448000	2450000	every single one of you able to afford AZT
2450000	2452000	anyway? Wasn't it like $8,000 a
2452000	2454000	year in 1989? AZT
2454000	2456000	break. Do you bohemians all just have
2456000	2458000	really good health insurance and nobody's talking
2458000	2460000	about it because you don't want to admit you're a part
2460000	2462000	of the system?
2464000	2466000	Or that you're getting government assistance and you
2466000	2468000	don't want to talk about that because system bad?
2468000	2470000	I know that shit didn't just fall off the back
2470000	2472000	of a truck.
2474000	2476000	Rent's idea of a revolution is a purely
2476000	2478000	symbolic one and
2478000	2480000	that's kind of the point. It's built
2480000	2482000	to reinforce world views, not
2482000	2484000	change anything. Because the reality
2484000	2486000	of the AIDS epidemic was not romantic
2486000	2488000	tragedy a la Mimi's inevitable fate
2488000	2490000	in La Boheme. It was not Manic Pixie
2490000	2492000	Dream Gaze going quietly into that good
2492000	2494000	night, but it was fighting and scratching
2494000	2496000	and clawing and quilting
2496000	2498000	and demanding that their humanity be recognized
2498000	2500000	and not devalued on basis
2500000	2502000	of sexual orientation, which it very much
2502000	2504000	was in 1989.
2504000	2506000	The reality of the AIDS epidemic does
2506000	2508000	not work as a fuck the system musical because
2508000	2510000	rejecting the system was not what
2510000	2512000	eventually changed it. What
2512000	2514000	changed it was holding the system to account.
2514000	2516000	You have the FDA
2516000	2518000	giving you a drug. So far
2518000	2520000	you've got AZT.
2520000	2522000	Which I can't take because it's
2522000	2524000	far too toxic.
2524000	2526000	The FDA says there is nothing
2526000	2528000	else that is
2528000	2530000	worth anything. That does not
2530000	2532000	mean that there is no place for rent or that you're
2532000	2534000	a bad person for liking it or that the music
2534000	2536000	isn't catchy. But if you care about
2536000	2538000	the subjects that it champions, rent
2538000	2540000	is hardly representative.
2540000	2542000	And that's the real problem with rent. It and
2542000	2544000	its narrative has overshadowed and sanitized
2544000	2546000	a painful, terrible, uncomfortable history
2546000	2548000	that we still live in the shadow
2548000	2550000	of. Go read Stage Struck by
2550000	2552000	Sarah Schulman. It's on Amazon. Or go
2552000	2554000	watch How to Survive a Plague. It's on Netflix.
2554000	2556000	Or Angels in America. It's on HBO Go.
2556000	2558000	Or even fucking Dallas Buyers Club.
2558000	2560000	Yes, it has its own problems, but actually
2560000	2562000	acknowledges the criminal shortcomings of every power
2562000	2564000	structure in place during the height of the AIDS crisis.
2564000	2566000	A light, user-friendly sort of anarchy
2566000	2568000	does not work in a narrative about the AIDS
2568000	2570000	crisis, because there is nothing noble in extolling
2570000	2572000	the virtues of quietly giving in to your
2572000	2574000	disease when there is a system right there that
2574000	2576000	can help and is actively, even
2576000	2578000	aggressively, failing you, but you reject it
2578000	2580000	because fuck the man. I'm not a part
2580000	2582000	of your system.
2582000	2584000	And threw it on the ground.
2584000	2586000	I don't need your protease
2586000	2588000	inhibitors. And that is
2588000	2590000	what rent the movie ends up being.
2590000	2592000	Sympathetic to an underclass that was
2592000	2594000	violently screwed by the system, but
2594000	2596000	ultimately the embodiment of the voice of the
2596000	2598000	ruling class. That is why a story
2598000	2600000	about homelessness and the AIDS crisis
2600000	2602000	ends up being about not
2602000	2604000	selling out. It advocates for
2604000	2606000	no revolution other than the revolution
2606000	2608000	of whatever makes you
2608000	2610000	as an individual feel good.
2610000	2612000	It reinforces a worldview in which
2612000	2614000	the only way to rebel against the system
2614000	2616000	is to reject it. And it might feel good
2616000	2618000	to throw it on the ground. And throw the rest
2618000	2620000	of the cake too.
2620000	2622000	It gives you a sense
2622000	2624000	of power in a world that makes you feel powerless.
2624000	2626000	But in reality, the only thing
2626000	2628000	it fosters is actual powerlessness.
2628000	2630000	Because in rejecting the system,
2630000	2632000	you are not only failing to tear it down,
2632000	2634000	you are also forfeiting any voice within it.
2634000	2636000	Rent takes an inherently political
2636000	2638000	issue and depoliticizes it to create
2638000	2640000	something comforting and consumable.
2640000	2642000	Rent looks pretty and does
2642000	2644000	as little as possible.
2644000	2646000	I'm starving for attention,
2646000	2648000	hating convention, hating pretension,
2648000	2650000	not to mention, of course,
2650000	2654000	hating dear old E-Mom and Dad.
2654000	2656000	Plague!
2656000	2658000	We are in the middle of a fucking plague!
2658000	2660000	And you behave like this!
2664000	2666000	I'd guard the entodo
2666000	2668000	and cover the rainbow
2668000	2670000	to blow off empty air.
2670000	2672000	Plague!
2672000	2674000	Plague!
2674000	2676000	Forty million infected
2676000	2678000	people is a fucking plague!
2686000	2688000	All we can do is field
2688000	2690000	a couple hundred people at a demonstration.
2690000	2692000	That's not going to make anybody
2692000	2694000	pay attention.
2694000	2696000	Not until
2696000	2698000	we get millions out there.
2702000	2704000	Let the among us
2704000	2706000	without sin
2706000	2708000	be the first to condemn!
2708000	2710000	And I say to you
2710000	2712000	in year 10
2712000	2714000	the same thing I said to you
2714000	2716000	in 1981
2716000	2718000	when there were
2718000	2720000	41 cases.
2728000	2730000	Until we get our acts together,
2730000	2732000	all of us,
2734000	2736000	we are as good
2736000	2738000	as dead.
2738000	2740000	We want to be
2740000	2742000	a man!
2742000	2744000	Healthcare is a right!
2744000	2746000	Healthcare is a right!
2746000	2748000	Healthcare is a right!
2748000	2750000	Healthcare is a right!
2750000	2752000	Healthcare is a right!
