00:00.000 --> 00:05.500
All were angry and many were frightened, and they converged on City Hall demanding and pleading.

00:05.500 --> 00:09.500
And more than 200 were hauled off to the station house.

00:09.500 --> 00:13.500
The first cases of AIDS in the United States were reported in 1981.

00:13.500 --> 00:17.500
By 1983, there were over a thousand reported cases in the U.S.,

00:17.500 --> 00:20.000
and by that point, already half had proven fatal.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Unlike other high-mortality-rate viruses like Ebola,

00:23.000 --> 00:28.500
HIV tended not to be something one may eventually recover from once infected.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
Part of the slowed government response was because of the epidemic curve of the HIV virus.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
Unlike Ebola virus, it was gradual, with symptoms appearing in a matter of years instead of days.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
It's easier for epidemiologists to encourage behavior changes in a population

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
for an in-your-face disease like smallpox or Ebola virus,

00:45.000 --> 00:48.500
but AIDS, despite its near 100% mortality rate,

00:48.500 --> 00:53.000
was so slow-moving that not only was mass behavior change difficult to encourage,

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
most people who spread the virus did not themselves even know that they were infected.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.500
Drug use was a risk factor. Unprotected sex was also a risk factor.

01:00.500 --> 01:03.500
But many risk factors were not in people's control.

01:03.500 --> 01:06.500
For instance, the 1980s was not a great time to be a hemophiliac.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.500
But another aspect was the factor that the epicenter of the outbreak

01:09.500 --> 01:12.000
was not in middle-class straight white families,

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
but the gay community in urban centers like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Since all of the earliest cases were discovered in gay men,

01:20.000 --> 01:22.500
it was easy for lawmakers to moralize the outbreak,

01:22.500 --> 01:26.500
not just as a sexually transmitted disease, but also of moral degeneracy.

01:26.500 --> 01:30.000
Pat Buchanan, who was the leader of White House Communications at the time,

01:30.000 --> 01:31.500
wrote about AIDS,

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Reagan didn't seem to understand the seriousness of the epidemic

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
until his friend Rock Hudson announced that he was HIV positive four years into the epidemic.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
But even then it wasn't enough to get the administration to act on it.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.500
Dr. Donald P. Francis, an epidemiologist within the CDC assigned to the AIDS outbreak,

01:51.500 --> 01:52.500
later wrote,

01:56.500 --> 01:59.000
Much like firefighters confronting a fire,

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
early aggressive action pays off,

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
whereas slow passive action leads to massive destruction.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.500
The CDC, with the help of Francis, developed a comprehensive plan in 1985

02:07.500 --> 02:09.500
to help stop the spread of HIV,

02:09.500 --> 02:11.500
which had by now infected thousands.

02:11.500 --> 02:14.000
But the Reagan administration rejected it outright.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
The administration told epidemiologists within the CDC

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
to look pretty and do as little as possible.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
Surgeon General C. Everett Koop was explicitly banned by the Reagan administration

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
from addressing the AIDS crisis

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
when in 1986 he broke with orders and did address what was by now a pandemic.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
He was attacked from within all areas of the administration.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
The powers that be within the CDC refused to stand up to their bosses

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
higher up in the Reagan administration.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
Director of the CDC James Mason, regarding the CDC's failure to act,

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
later said,

02:49.000 --> 02:53.500
By the late 1980s, with now hundreds of thousands of new cases of HIV,

02:53.500 --> 02:56.500
it wasn't an issue of passivity, but of active obstruction.

02:56.500 --> 03:00.000
An increasingly popular narrative surrounding the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
was that there was nothing to be done to stop it,

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
that the onus was solely on the infected,

03:04.000 --> 03:06.500
and there was nothing but their own behavior to blame.

03:06.500 --> 03:10.000
But the spread of HIV-AIDS in the United States was not inevitable,

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
and had the powers that be acted sooner,

03:12.000 --> 03:14.500
millions of lives could have been saved.

03:14.500 --> 03:19.000
This is what happens when governments fail the people they are sworn to protect.

03:23.500 --> 03:28.500
Healthcare is a right! Healthcare is a right! Healthcare is a right!

03:36.500 --> 03:39.500
So, yeah, anyway, today we're going to talk about rent.

03:40.500 --> 03:46.500
Let he among us without sin be the first to condemn!

03:48.500 --> 03:51.500
Well, fortunately, I have literally never sinned.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.500
So condemn away I shall.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.500
Okay, so here's the thing, full disclosure,

03:56.500 --> 03:58.500
I have always hated rent,

03:58.500 --> 04:01.000
for basically the same reason I hate Reality Bites.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.500
Yes, even before the movie came out, and yes,

04:03.500 --> 04:05.500
despite the fact that I lived in the East Village of New York City

04:05.500 --> 04:08.500
the first time I saw it on Broadway and was surrounded by rent-heads,

04:08.500 --> 04:10.500
or, hell, maybe even because of that.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.500
And the other thing is, the older I get,

04:12.500 --> 04:15.000
the more things I find about rent that annoy me.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Like, when I was a freshman at NYU,

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
I was, like, surrounded by these rent-heads who were, like, it me,

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
and I'm like, well, you know, I guess you're not completely wrong,

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
you know, trust Fun Babies.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
And then later, I eventually burned a bridge over someone

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
who insisted that rent was beyond criticism

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
because Jonathan Larson died of AIDS.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
He didn't. And even if he did, no.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
I actually won the ticket lottery for this sucker twice.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
So, sorry, stage-so-apologists, I'm not here for you.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
This ain't a stage-show-good-movie-bad kind of episode,

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
so hunker down, y'all!

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
Not to mention, of course, hating dear old mom and dad.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Thing is, the movie does exist in a realm of bad,

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
partially separated from the stage show by virtue of adaptation sickness,

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
and it is not a good adaptation,

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
but a lot of my problems with rent are with rent as a whole.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
So this one goes out to all the people who asked me to deconstruct rent

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
like I did with Schumacher's Phantom,

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
and to you, I say, I can't.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Sorry.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Hey, mister.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
She's my sister.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
And the truth about rent's adaptation is it's not really that inept.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
I mean, although there are some decisions that are like, what?

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
You're what you are.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
But the thing that makes rent the movie fail

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
is the same basic affliction Phantom suffered from.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
The filmmakers didn't know how to translate the stage musical effectively.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
And similar to what we discussed with the Phantom adaptation,

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
its main failure is stripping the source material

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
of the theatrical elements that make it flow

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
and replacing it with, you know, mostly montages.

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
From the soul of a young man.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
A young man.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Some on-screen dialogue.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
You want me to be your slave?

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
You want me to just obey your every wish?

06:03.000 --> 06:09.000
More scenes, less singing, setting leases on fire.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
But in the end, it has more in common with the adaptation of Les Mis than Phantom.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
It's just kind of a boring musical made by a boring filmmaker

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
who never seemed terribly comfortable with the source material.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
And in fairness to the original work,

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
the movie is much more un-good than the Broadway show.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
And it is important to note that rent is one of the first mainstream-ish works

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
with any kind of substantial LGBT representation.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
And hey, this is also one of the rare representations of a bisexual character,

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
although she, of course, is the slutty McSlutter Slutterson

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
who wants to slut it up with every living human.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Because, bye.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
There will always be women in rubber flirting with me.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Rent was a step.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
It was a step in helping to humanize the LGBT community

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
and urban centers to a broader audience

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
who might not have humanized them otherwise.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
You know, I'm not here to deny that.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
That said, I don't have much nice to say about Rent,

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
so if it was, like, integral to your childhood or something,

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
you probably might want to sit this one out.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Rent.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
If there was one wrong directorial choice

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
to embody the countercultural discontent of the youngs,

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
it was Chris Columbus.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
Fresh off voice-of-a-generation avant-garde tentpoles

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
like Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, and the first two Harry Potters.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
Hell, maybe that's why Benny, the alleged sellout,

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
is, unlike the stage show, easily the most sympathetic character in the movie.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Columbus is like, here's a guy who knows what's up.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
If you want to produce films and write songs,

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
you need somewhere to do it.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Invest your money wisely, Benny,

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
and use that money to fund your passion project five years from now.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
And meanwhile, your old friends will still be poor

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
and wondering why the cruel, cruel world

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
is forcing them to pay rent to live in a building.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
Anyway, I can't speak to your local community theater production of Rent,

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
but the problems that most people have with Rent

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
are not necessarily unique to the movie.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Mark, are you there?

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Are you screening your call?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
It's Mom.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Hi, I just wanted to call and say we love you.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
But they are certainly more pronounced.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
There are times when we're dirt broke,

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
and hungry, and freezing,

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
and I ask myself,

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
why the hell am I still living here?

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
And then they call.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
F*** you, Mark.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
God, this f***ing movie wakes the inner walker-wielding granny in me

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
yelling at these kids to get off my lawn.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
And these damn kids are from the generation before mine.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
So yeah, the reason why Rent the movie fails

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
has a lot in common with why Phantom the movie did not work.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
But, you know, we've already covered that ground.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
I'm more interested in Rent as part of the grander, counter-cultural canon.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
Do you feel left behind by the system?

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
A system that, say, doesn't take your art seriously,

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
or maybe failed to act on an epidemic before it became a pandemic.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
A system that profited off life-saving drugs,

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
that failed to fund research.

09:07.000 --> 09:13.000
There are over 140 drugs out there that the FDA has identified as possibilities.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
That stigmatized the sick,

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
that looked the other way when hundreds of thousands of people in our own country were dropping dead.

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
I think we'd all like a generation-defining musical that really takes the system to task.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
But Rent ain't it.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Oh.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Mama who bore me,

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
Mama who gave me

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
No way to handle things

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Who made me so sad

09:44.000 --> 09:50.000
The stage musical is a popular format to try and capture the discontent of the... something.

09:50.000 --> 09:56.000
It is the music of a people who will not be slaves again

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
We have been left behind by the system. The musical.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
There's a lot of those.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
But Rent is literally based on the first we have been left behind by the system.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
The musical.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Oh no, c'io milionario

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Se fa segno il buon Dio

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
La Bohème was the original... that.

10:15.000 --> 10:21.000
Puccini's La Bohème was arguably the start of the mainstream counter-cultural Fightin' the Man musical.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
It is the basis of not only Rent, but many modern films and musicals.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Most notably Moulin Rouge, which although based on La Traviata,

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
borrows arguably more from Bohème than Traviata,

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
or the film from which it takes its name, but not its exclamation point.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
I'd summarize the plot, but it's basically identical to Rent.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
Swap out tuberculosis with AIDS, the Latin Quarter with Alphabet City,

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
the 1840s with the 1980s, and Americanify the characters' names a bit.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
I'm Roger

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Puccini's Bohème was popular because its characters were relatable,

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
and the story was emotionally charged.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
The real revelation here is that his opera is about an underclass.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
He isn't writing about kings or dukes,

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
but about starving artists who feel that they've been left behind.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
It is truly a universal story, translatable to any era.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
Phantom of the Opera also draws a lot of inspiration from Bohème

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
in that it goes a long way with raw, simple, shallow emotionality.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
But the difference between Phantom and Rent is

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
Phantom wasn't trying to make a grand statement about society.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
And the truth is, La Bohème isn't either. Not really.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
It exists more in the same vein as Moulin Rouge.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
You're the voice of the children of the revolution!

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
But what is the revolution?

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
I mean, it's not a socialist revolution, or a class revolution, or...

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
We have freedom!

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
Beauty, truth, and love!

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Okay.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
See, they use terms like revolution in Moulin Rouge,

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
but really, it's about emotionality with an artistic movement set as the backdrop.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
Shows like this have romantic ideas in the guise of revolution,

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
but none of them challenge any existing power structures

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
in a way that might alienate the wealthy audience,

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
especially as portrayed in the movie.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
In Cyberland, we only drink...

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Diet Coke.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Yeah, that'll show The Man.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Look at those monocles poppin' everywhere.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Every decade sorta had its own.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
The 1960s had Hair, the 70s Jesus Christ Superstar,

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
80s had Les Mis, 90s had Rent, 2000s...

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
wanted to have Spring Awakening, but really, they had Avenue Q.

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
They all tried to capture the voice of the class of youngs that feel left out of the system.

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
Although, all of these are what George Ishikawa has called bourgeois or finished theater.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
In other words, they frame themselves as revolutionary,

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
but continue to push the voice, worldview, and values of the status quo.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
In this case, middle-class white kids who want to pass off their home movies as true art.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
From here on in, I shoot without a script.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
Without a script? Oh, Mark, you visionary.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
See, this is what I mean when I say that Rent's primary purpose

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
is to validate a certain subsect of the theater going public

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
rather than bring any theater of the oppressed to the amasses.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
This is an idea developed by revolutionary Brazilian dramatist Augusto Bol,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
who developed the idea of theater of the oppressed.

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
And Bol takes a Marxist reading to pretty much all theater on this subject, so bear that in mind.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
Echoing Marx, Bol argues that the dominant art is the art of the dominant class,

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
who control the means to disseminate art.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
In this case, Broadway shows.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
All of these shows revolve around the social discontent of some underclass,

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
but the shows did not reach the mainstream because some underclass propelled them there.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Rent did claw its way up from off-Broadway, yes,

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
but only because it found success with the people who had money.

13:35.000 --> 13:41.000
Only thing to do is jump over the moon.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
Hamilton is a perfect example of this phenomenon in action right now.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
High demand and extremely limited quantities

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
mean that only the wealthy control access to the stage show.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
A lottery system does exist that sells tickets for $10,

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
but there are 21 of these tickets per show and thousands of entrants.

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
Real access comes in the form of people with thousands of dollars to drop on tickets.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
And because Broadway shows are so uniquely expensive in terms of consumable art,

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
they have to walk a fine line between being trendy,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
maybe even a little edgy,

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
but not enough to put the people with money outside of their comfort zones.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
It presents a multi-culti hip-hop narrative about the life of Alexander Hamilton

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
and the foundation of the country,

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
but it is ultimately really, really reassuring about the American experiment.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
The ruling class does.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
You remember you belong to me.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
If you want people to hear your message,

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
it first has to get the okay from your wealthy patrons.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
I mean, it's no coincidence that the first hip-hop musical to become a huge hit

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
happens to be about the whitest thing ever.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
And Hamilton is excellent, don't get me wrong.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
It's just not here to challenge any ideas on American exceptionalism

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
or start any revolutions.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
You've got to be carefully taught.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
If you talk, you're gonna get shot.

15:00.000 --> 15:05.000
Does every musical need to necessarily challenge the culture it's trying to sell itself to?

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
God, no.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
I mean, how else would I see Phantom for the 20th time?

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
One time only!

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
But anyway, not every musical, even the ones with explicit revolutionary text,

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
needs to be trying to tear down the system.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
But what would a revolution look like if it had been included in Rent

15:23.000 --> 15:28.000
rather than the subtext being reject the system instead of change it?

15:28.000 --> 15:34.000
Well, probably what was going down in Alphabet City in the 80s in the real world.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
Thousands of demonstrators demand that New York City do more

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
to help those suffering from AIDS.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
Protests, societal upheaval, all those unpretty things

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
that were very much going on during the AIDS crisis,

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
they were not designed to make the type of person

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
with hundreds of dollars to drop on a Broadway show ticket comfortable.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
Do you think you've really accomplished a great deal?

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
Yes, I think we do. What else can we do?

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
But Les Mis does not position itself in opposition to the culture it is trying to sell itself to.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Neither does Hamilton.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
But Rent does.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
And if your musical spins its entirety dressing down the phony baloney culture

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
while at the same time kind of being its very embodiment,

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
then we may need to have words.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
Rent the Broadway Musical was met with much more universal acclaim

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
Rent the Broadway Musical was met with much more universal acclaim

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
than Bohem a century prior.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
It wasn't for another couple of years until we started seeing pushback against Rent.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
The movie was what made society as a whole really start to turn on Rent.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
So thank you for that movie.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
See, Rent's heyday came and went,

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
and a few more years passed,

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
and then another few more years passed,

16:55.000 --> 17:00.000
and then they threw another few years on for posterity.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
And they made the movie with the original cast.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
So by the time the movie comes out, it's like,

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
yeah, sure, sure, you're in your 20s.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
And they went hard trying to keep the original cast,

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
which was just weird.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
Rosario Dawson and Tracy Toms are the only people who seem happy to be here.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
Everyone else is in their 30s, and they've moved on with their careers,

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
but here they are, pretending to be in their early 20s, and it's weird.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Many of the songs are cut and turned into dialogue,

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
which makes for an even draggier experience than it might have been.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
Even with the opening number, when they are asking themselves,

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
how we gonna pay, how we gonna pay next year's Rent?

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Rent, Rent, Rent, Rent, Rent, Rent, Rent.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
The music is arranged similarly to the shows, which is a group number.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
But in the show, everyone in the neighborhood doesn't all collectively decide

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
to stop paying rent at the same time.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
It's more like, you know, like a Greek choir type thing.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
Unlike in the movie, where it appears to be a riot.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
And like, okay, so Benny turns off their heat, right?

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
So they have to burn their precious art creations for warmth.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
This is also lifted directly from La Boheme.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
This is how that starts. Burning our art for warmth.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
It's like an irony thing.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
But then they throw it out the window.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
I mean, the whole thing is full of adaptive changes

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
that don't really stand up to modest scrutiny.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
Joanne and Maureen's relationship never gets resolved in the movie.

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
Like, they break up and then are together again at the end when they find Mimi.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
I guess they get back together off-screen somewhere.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
This works better in the show because they break up and get back together constantly,

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
and that's the joke.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
The movie starts with Seasons of Love,

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
which is an odd decision as the whole point of that song

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
is that it happens after intermission to impart that a year has passed.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
So at the front of the movie, it's just like a song that's there.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
But people know it, so let's start with that, I guess.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
Lots of 2005 vehicles here in 1989.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Nobody has 80s hair.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
Mark's camera has no sound recording apparatus.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
Why are we taking a train to life support if everything's in Alphabet City?

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
A neighborhood with no train access.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
Roger returns to Manhattan from Santa Fe via the Williamsburg Bridge.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
Some of the worst CGI cold-weather breath in history of moviedom.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
Lazy, uncreative use of your setting.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
Or just strange use of setting.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
Is he about to try to sell me a really manly truck?

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
There are a lot of problems with Rent that are movie-specific,

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
but my interest is more comprehensive.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
And it starts with the fact that...

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
Dorothy and Toto went over the rainbow

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
To blow off fancy air

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
Rent is a musical about selfish, horrible people,

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
framed like freedom fighters.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
They show profound entitlement over other people's rights and property,

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
but it is framed like romantic rebelliousness.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
A restaurant owner begs them,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
please don't patronize our restaurant, please.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Please, no, no, not tonight. Please leave.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
They then ignore him when he asks them not to move the tables around.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Please don't move the tables.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Hey, Rosie, let's put these tables together.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
No, no, no, no.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
Maureen is an emotionally abusive cheater who gaslights all of her partners.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
Angel comes into wealth at the beginning by killing a dog.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
But sure as I am here, that dog is now in doggy hell.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
Mimi is a self-destructive codependent enabler.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Collins honors the memory of his dead lover

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
by hotwiring a local ATM to dispense cash for him and his friends

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
when you plug his name in.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
I rewired the ATM at the food employee.

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
Now he needs the code A-N-G-E-L.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
And Mark. Sweet Mark.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
You might be the worst thing to have ever happened.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
And you are... I'm just here to...

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
To appropriate your tragedy for my art without having obtained permission.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
I hope that's cool.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Rent the Movie really has two stories that don't mesh

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
when you give it more than a passing thought.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
The story of the tragic AIDS havers

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
and the love triangle between Joanne, Mark, and Maureen.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
And these two things have nothing to do with each other

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
besides that they know each other.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
But really, Mark and Maureen, while they feel bad for the AIDS havers,

21:20.000 --> 21:25.000
I guess their stories are more about their poetry and their art.

21:25.000 --> 21:31.000
I gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha!

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
Mark has his aimless documentary and Maureen her terrible performance art.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
Both have loving support structures and come from wealthy families

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
and none of these people have AIDS or really any reason not to pay the rent

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
other than the fact that they feel they shouldn't have to

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
because art and selling out are something.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
And I ask myself, why the hell am I still living here?

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Fuck you!

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
You know that song, Common People?

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
Still you'll never get it right

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
It's when you're late in bed at night

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
Watching roaches climb the wall

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
If you called your dad he could stop it, oh yeah

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Aw, look Mark, someone wrote a song about you.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
In the show it's more obvious that Maureen is terrible

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
and kind of a narcissist, and this is really a pastiche of bad performance art.

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha!

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha!

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
But in the movie it is played dead fucking straight.

22:24.000 --> 22:31.000
And the suits are in the audience blown away by how real she is.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Moo with me

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
Laterate, no!

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
They're mooing with her.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
Now, the fact that they are horrible need not be a problem.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
I need your help to make my neighbor's yappy dog disappear.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
Or even that their horribleness goes unexamined by the characters.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
That is, after all, a condition of human behavior.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
But the problem, like the faux-revolutionary subtext, is with the framing.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
The show doesn't really go anywhere with this.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
This type of character is much more effectively explored in Trainspotting.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
In Trainspotting, you are meant to relate to the characters, sure,

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
but it makes no pretense of them being idealists or good people.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
It much more successfully dresses down the phoniness of the society that they reject.

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
Choose life, choose a job, choose a career, choose a family,

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
choose a fucking big television, choose washing machines, cars,

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
compact displayers and electrical tin openers.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
But at the same time, it doesn't dress them up like they are legitimately too good for society.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
They are very obviously not.

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
So, Rent presents us with a worldview that validates the characters rather than challenges them.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
And romantic validation is part of what made Rent so popular.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
You know, similar to Bowen before it.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
But there are ways that this sort of thing can be...

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
maybe a little contradictory.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
Yes, we are so counter-cultural, like in this scene.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
The nadir of the film, where they dance on the table

24:01.000 --> 24:06.000
while the pearl-clutching suits are scandalized by the interests of the Bohemians.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Like, huevos rancheros.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Yeah, eating disorders!

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Woo!

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
Rent's primary theme comes from the conflict between Bohemian ideals

24:23.000 --> 24:27.000
and selling out for financial security.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
What rent?

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
This past year's rent which I let slide.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
Yeah, they don't want to pay rent because their friend who owns the building

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
has reneged on a deal he made with them that they can live there rent-free.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
But there is this underlying entitlement that these guys have

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
that they shouldn't have to pay rent

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
because they're artists and they don't sell out.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Get off my lawn!

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
Because working for a show like BuzzLine is completely selling out.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
Mark has among the worst resolution to his subplot.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
Particularly frustrating to those of us working in journalism today.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Start at $3,000?

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
He works for a sort of proto-TMZ-style news organization

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
and makes bank doing it,

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
but he doesn't like having a job in his chosen field of study

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
because selling out.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
I sold my soul.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Oh, poor baby.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
You have to work your way up from a job you don't really like

25:12.000 --> 25:17.000
in your chosen field that pays really well as a starting point for your career?

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
If I need to finish my own film, I quit!

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Mark, you are the worst.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
There is a big homeless subplot,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
but it's much bigger in the stage show than the movie.

25:26.000 --> 25:32.000
No room at the Holiday Inn, oh no!

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
But the big thing that is pointed out by this character,

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
but goes oddly unexamined,

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
is the fact that none of these people really care about the homeless.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Who do you think you are?

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
I don't need no goddamn help from some bleeding heart cameraman.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
My life's not for you to make a name for yourself for.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Easy, sugar, easy. He was just trying...

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Just trying to use me to kill his guilt.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
Mark getting called out on it doesn't prompt any change in behavior.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Maureen really doesn't give a shit about their plight.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
She only cares about her performance space not being taken from her.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
The tent city is just a backdrop.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
The problem with the theme of selling out for security

26:06.000 --> 26:10.000
versus adhering to your precious ideals while living in poverty,

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
with the backdrop of a massive homeless subplot,

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
which was not there in La Boheme, by the by,

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
is that it infers that poverty is a choice, and a noble one at that.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
Which, sure, Mark has a choice as to whether or not to live in poverty.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
Pretty much all of the characters do, except Angel and Collins.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
But the homeless do not choose to live on the street

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
in order to uphold their Bohemian ideals.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
So right there we have thematic dissonance number one.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Choosing to live in poverty and romanticizing it

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
while surrounded by those living in poverty who do not have a choice,

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
and are repulsed by your romanticizing their tragedy, Mark.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
Hey, artist! You got a dollar?

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Didn't think so.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
Yeah, this prompts no change in him, and is the last time it gets brought up.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
The second major theme is that of affliction.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
La Boheme is set against the backdrop of tuberculosis,

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
rent of AIDS, which afflicts far more characters in Rent than TB did in Boheme.

27:02.000 --> 27:07.000
So when you have theme one over here, and theme two over here,

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
this is where we really start kind of running into problems.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
Mark Cohen's character arc, played up in the movie to the point

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
where, unlike in the show, he is the explicit protagonist,

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
reminds me so much of Lelena in Reality Bites.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
They both exploit their parents,

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
neither want to sell out their precious art or play by the rules of fucking society,

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
steal shit, know they'll get away with any rules broken

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
because they're white kids who come from wealthy families,

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
and their approach to documentary is just...

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
Shoot whatever and call it art because it exists, and I made it.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
From here on in, I shoot without a script.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
To quote Nathan Rabin, last time I checked,

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
those are called home fucking movies and nobody thinks that's high art.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
So we suffer in the cold and ignore our loving families

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
because suffering equals art, and the homeless are suffering,

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
and we like them because suffering equals art,

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
and as long as they don't expect us to recognize their needs as humans,

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
then hey, maybe they don't think suffering is all that artistic, you assholes.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
So in Rent, poverty, despite being confronted on how shitty it is

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
to try to appropriate someone else's suffering, Mark,

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
is always justified because art,

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
and capitalist society is always out to consume you,

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
which is why you own nothing, you rent,

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
therefore you are always justified in taking anything you can from society.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
I rewired the ATM at the food employee.

28:26.000 --> 28:31.000
It's not stealing because you're an artist and the rules don't apply to you.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
You know, poverty is not romantic.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Just throwing it out there.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
Anyway, let's tie that back in with the theme of affliction.

28:43.000 --> 28:48.000
Affliction

28:48.000 --> 28:54.000
No day but today

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
A big theme in Rent is presented in the no day but today motif,

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
with the central conflict of Mimi and Roger's relationship

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
being planning for an uncertain future versus living for the now.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Problem here is Rent doesn't try to find a balance,

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
but rather that planning for the future thing tends to be painted in a more negative light,

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
especially where Benny is concerned.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
You make fun, yet I'm the one

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
Attempting to do some good

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Or do you really want a neighborhood

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
Where people piss on your stoop every night

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
The no day but today motif is seen in the life support group,

29:25.000 --> 29:29.000
No day but today

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
and in the interactions between Roger and Mimi,

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
a bad idea of a relationship that at least one of them gets some bad juju about,

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
but here we go anyway.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Your smile reminded me

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
I always remind people of

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
It's almost like I have a type

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
And I'm drawn to self-destructive addicts

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
See, Roger's ex-girlfriend committed suicide

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
after finding out that both she and Roger have AIDS.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
The suicide part's not clear in the movie, by the by.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
His girlfriend April left a note

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Saying we've got AIDS

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
Before slitting her wrists in the bathroom

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
So the first time we see the no day but today motif

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
is used at Angel's life support meeting.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
In the very next scene, we see it again

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
when Mimi is trying to get Roger to do drugs with her.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
Forget, regret

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
All life is yours to miss

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
There is an honesty here,

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
like that Roger wants to be with her

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
but isn't allowing himself to because he's afraid to live

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
and Mimi's trying to get him to open up.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
However, this doesn't really work because

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
this very simple framing,

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
the fact that Mimi is on the side of the life support people

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
and therefore in the moral right,

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
is undercut by the fact that she's trying to enable

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
a newly clean person to do drugs with her.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
Take your powder, take your candle

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
Your sweet whisper, I just can't handle

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
The film frames it like Roger is refusing to live

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
when in reality, he has a very good reason

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
not to want to spend any time with Mimi.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Namely, that of staying clean

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
and in that regard, has much more in common

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
with the people at the life support meeting than with Mimi.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
Excuse me if I'm off track

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
But if you're so wise, then tell me

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Why do you need smack?

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Their No Day But Today

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
accepts that any day could be their last

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
but that doesn't mean they're not going to take care of themselves now.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Mimi's attitude is that you should live for today

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
instead of taking care of yourself

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
and planning for the future because you can die at any moment

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
so you may as well live for the moment and do whatever.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
I'm at this moment

31:19.000 --> 31:24.000
as my last

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
The show does this too, perhaps more pointedly

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
because rather than Roger's buds

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
plus Mimi being the chorus

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
a choice which makes no logical sense by the way

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Mimi doesn't really know any of these people except Angel but whatever

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
In the stage show, the chorus is the entire life support group.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
No day but today

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Take your powder

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Take your candle

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
So the show does the same thing

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
only, you know, more.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Roger does eventually help Mimi get clean

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
but that doesn't last long

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
and eventually contributes to Roger

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
leaving New York altogether for like five minutes

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
before coming back and finding that Mimi has disappeared

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
and fallen down a deep addiction hole

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
but they find her and Roger sings at her

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
and love saves the day

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Mimi

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
It should be noted that Mimi nearly dying

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
is not brought on by chance like with Angel

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
but by her own decision to give up on life

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
She goes back to doing drugs

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
stops paying her rent

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
lives on the street

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
stops taking her AIDS medication

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
and nearly dies of exposure

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
and still, and still

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
she survives

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
She said

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Turn around girlfriend

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
and listen

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
to that boy's song

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
And I'm not going to be a total cold hearted monster

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
and say that there is no value in that

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
you know, only mostly

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
because I realized that Rent was not meant to be

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
a cautionary tale

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
more than anything it was intended to give hope

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
to a portion of the young population that felt like it had no voice

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
as well as to get a broader audience

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
to empathize with that population

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Rent is not endeavoring to be realistic

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
it endeavors to provide hope

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
which it did for many, many people

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
hence the no day but today attitude

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
being encouraging to those in dire straits

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
just because any day could be your last

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
does not mean life is not worth living

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
However

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
However

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Roger is doing the actual hard work of self care

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
on which Mimi is an unquestionable drain

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
which goes completely ignored once we've decided

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
that love is the most important thing

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
love at all costs, love will save the day

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
and again, I'm not saying that all relationships

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
portrayed in things need to be

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
healthy, but it's kind of like

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Twilight, the work doesn't exactly

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
frame it like it's a no good very bad idea

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
I like watching you sleep

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Do you do that a lot?

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Just the past couple of months

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Rent's biggest departure from La Boheme

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
is the ending

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
See, Boheme ends like this

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
And Rent ends like this

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
And yes, the play ends this way too

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
I was heading

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
towards this warm

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
white light

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
And I swear

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Angel was there

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
And she looked good

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
And also this one

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
great song that Roger's been trying to write this whole show

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
and he finally writes it and sings it

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
and it's like the worst one

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
How'd I let you

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
slip away

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
when I'm longing so

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
But it

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
saves her from the AIDS

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
She's fine

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
And I have wrestled over this

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Rent changes fundamentally

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
so little from La Boheme

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
such to the point that it hardly feels relevant to the late 1980s

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
So why

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
change this?

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Why does Mimi die in La Boheme

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
but miraculously gets an AIDS reprieve

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
because Roger sings a song at her

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I have always

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
loved you

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
In La Boheme, Mimi is

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
a symbol of innocence and purity

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
And she just can't survive

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
in this tough new Bohemian world

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
That's the price of Bohemia

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
I guess

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
But she is not that innocent in Rent

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
She's like a druggie

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
and a stripper

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
So killing her I guess doesn't have that meaning

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
about innocence lost or something

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
that they were so into in the Victorian era

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
So might as well let her live

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
and get some empowerment

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
out of her being a survivor

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Right?

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Oh

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
And she looked good

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
But I don't think that is

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
really the end of it

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
I think in Rent it's Angel who is the Mimi

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
because Angel gets the angelic Mimi death

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Angel gets to be the embodiment

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
of goodness where in Rent

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Mimi is not that at all

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
She is flawed and therefore Angel dies

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
instead of Mimi which is noteworthy

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
because Angel's counterpart Shunard

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
does not die in La Boheme

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
In the show it does depend on the actor

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
She is a more fleshed out character

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
For instance she is a compulsive placater

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
who really does not like conflict

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
People! Is this a new way to start a new year?

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Oh have compassion

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
And there is a much bigger sense of active agency

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
But Chris Columbus's

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
interpretation does not exist

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
in a character in her own right

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
just to be inspiration

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
for everyone else and act as like

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
a spirit guide after she dies

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Angel is there

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Chris Columbus's embodiment of goodness and humanity

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
is more of a prop than one of the main

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
f***ing characters. You know it's like in Pocahontas

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
where they were so obsessed with being respectful

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
that she has literally no character

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
flaws or character

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
period. And I think part of that

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
is that Chris Columbus never seems entirely

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
comfortable with this character just from a cinematography

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
standpoint. Take the curious

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
decision to shoot I'll Cover You

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
as boringly as they did

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Eh let's just walk down

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
the streets good enough

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Look at this it looks like it was shot by an undercover

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
PI from across the street

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
This is handled better in the show

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
which since it's more of an ensemble Angel is more

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
of a character on equal footing with everyone else

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
and uh yeah she does

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
make money killing a dog and

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
we are supposed to be charmed by this

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
But soon as I am here that dog is

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
now in doggy hell. Well this is actually

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
an element from La Boheme where instead

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
of a dog it's a parrot so let's ignore

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
that. So rather than Mimi who in

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Boheme is the embodiment of goodness and

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
innocence in Rent she is the waif

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
who needs to be saved from herself

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
with love and Angel

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
well Angel becomes

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
the tragic figure of goodness and love dying

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
because the world is too cruel and corrupt for

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
her. So Angel's story is resolved

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
with her becoming an

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
angel and at the end of the day

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
both in the stage show and in the movie

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Angel is the character with the least of

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
an arc and she just kinda

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
goes quietly into that good night

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
nobly not mad about

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
it or anything no one is mad

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
at the system that has failed them

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
and here's the thing about the theme of

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
affliction. In the 1840's

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
no system was going

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
to save you from tuberculosis

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
so

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
while it was a problem

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
that they romanticized it the way they did back

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
then same rules didn't

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
apply so these two themes

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
didn't really conflict

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
as they do in a story

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
about the AIDS crisis in the late 1980's

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
music

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Man I'm not gonna let

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
you poison me

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
I threw it on the ground

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
So I wanna

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
talk a little bit about

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
I ain't gonna be part

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
of your system

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
that

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
pump that garbage in another man's veins

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
There's something

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
kinda disingenuous when we have a narrative about

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
the AIDS crisis and the machine we're

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
raging against isn't the FDA

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
or pharmaceutical companies or an indifferent

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
political machine but

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
gentrification namely gentrification that

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
affects the privileged white characters

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
and the face of the encroaching gentrifying

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
class is a black man who is

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
pricing out the white boys

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
which is another issue all together that reflects

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
basically zero of reality of living in New York

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
to this day and I don't like it

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
God

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
there's just so much to hate

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
so many things to throw on the ground

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
like this and this

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
and that and even this

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Anyway this whole theme

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
of you know poverty versus

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
selling out rings pretty hollow

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
when you have all these worried parents calling

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
constantly. Roger where are you?

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Mimi chica. Roger where are you?

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Don't make a fuss. Roger where are you?

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
To mama. Roger where are you?

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
And honestly the show

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
is way worse for this such to the point

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
where I wonder if it isn't trying to highlight our

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
hero's hypocrisy as everyone but

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
the two adora-gays has family to go back

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
to and they're also the only characters

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
who really seem to have anything to do with AIDS

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
activism. Angel in the form of his support

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
group but with Collins the best we get is

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
this. Expel me from my theory

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
of actual reality. Which we

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
can infer has something to do with AIDS activism

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
because of this. Actual

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
reality. Act up. Fight it.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
He also hints that this is why he

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
got expelled from MIT and this is all

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
just lines and subtext this isn't

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
really explicit and this line

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
in La Vie Boheme is the last we see of it

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
and in the end Collins honors Angel's

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
memory not by doing anything useful

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
but by robbing ATMs.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
I rewired the ATM at the food emporium

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
now he needs a code

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
A-N-G-E-L

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Yeah that'll get those extortiony

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
drug prices down. Hey how were

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
every single one of you able to afford AZT

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
anyway? Wasn't it like $8,000 a

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
year in 1989? AZT

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
break. Do you bohemians all just have

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
really good health insurance and nobody's talking

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
about it because you don't want to admit you're a part

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
of the system?

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Or that you're getting government assistance and you

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
don't want to talk about that because system bad?

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
I know that shit didn't just fall off the back

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
of a truck.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Rent's idea of a revolution is a purely

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
symbolic one and

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
that's kind of the point. It's built

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
to reinforce world views, not

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
change anything. Because the reality

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
of the AIDS epidemic was not romantic

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
tragedy a la Mimi's inevitable fate

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
in La Boheme. It was not Manic Pixie

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Dream Gaze going quietly into that good

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
night, but it was fighting and scratching

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
and clawing and quilting

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
and demanding that their humanity be recognized

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
and not devalued on basis

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
of sexual orientation, which it very much

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
was in 1989.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
The reality of the AIDS epidemic does

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
not work as a fuck the system musical because

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
rejecting the system was not what

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
eventually changed it. What

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
changed it was holding the system to account.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
You have the FDA

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
giving you a drug. So far

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
you've got AZT.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Which I can't take because it's

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
far too toxic.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
The FDA says there is nothing

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
else that is

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
worth anything. That does not

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
mean that there is no place for rent or that you're

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
a bad person for liking it or that the music

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
isn't catchy. But if you care about

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
the subjects that it champions, rent

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
is hardly representative.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
And that's the real problem with rent. It and

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
its narrative has overshadowed and sanitized

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
a painful, terrible, uncomfortable history

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
that we still live in the shadow

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
of. Go read Stage Struck by

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Sarah Schulman. It's on Amazon. Or go

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
watch How to Survive a Plague. It's on Netflix.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Or Angels in America. It's on HBO Go.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Or even fucking Dallas Buyers Club.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Yes, it has its own problems, but actually

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
acknowledges the criminal shortcomings of every power

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
structure in place during the height of the AIDS crisis.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
A light, user-friendly sort of anarchy

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
does not work in a narrative about the AIDS

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
crisis, because there is nothing noble in extolling

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
the virtues of quietly giving in to your

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
disease when there is a system right there that

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
can help and is actively, even

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
aggressively, failing you, but you reject it

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
because fuck the man. I'm not a part

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
of your system.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
And threw it on the ground.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
I don't need your protease

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
inhibitors. And that is

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
what rent the movie ends up being.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Sympathetic to an underclass that was

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
violently screwed by the system, but

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
ultimately the embodiment of the voice of the

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
ruling class. That is why a story

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
about homelessness and the AIDS crisis

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
ends up being about not

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
selling out. It advocates for

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
no revolution other than the revolution

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
of whatever makes you

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
as an individual feel good.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
It reinforces a worldview in which

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
the only way to rebel against the system

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
is to reject it. And it might feel good

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
to throw it on the ground. And throw the rest

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
of the cake too.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
It gives you a sense

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
of power in a world that makes you feel powerless.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
But in reality, the only thing

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
it fosters is actual powerlessness.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Because in rejecting the system,

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
you are not only failing to tear it down,

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
you are also forfeiting any voice within it.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Rent takes an inherently political

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
issue and depoliticizes it to create

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
something comforting and consumable.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Rent looks pretty and does

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
as little as possible.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
I'm starving for attention,

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
hating convention, hating pretension,

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
not to mention, of course,

44:10.000 --> 44:14.000
hating dear old E-Mom and Dad.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Plague!

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
We are in the middle of a fucking plague!

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
And you behave like this!

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
I'd guard the entodo

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
and cover the rainbow

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
to blow off empty air.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Plague!

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Plague!

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Forty million infected

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
people is a fucking plague!

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
All we can do is field

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
a couple hundred people at a demonstration.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
That's not going to make anybody

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
pay attention.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Not until

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
we get millions out there.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Let the among us

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
without sin

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
be the first to condemn!

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
And I say to you

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
in year 10

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
the same thing I said to you

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
in 1981

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
when there were

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
41 cases.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Until we get our acts together,

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
all of us,

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
we are as good

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
as dead.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
We want to be

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
a man!

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Healthcare is a right!

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Healthcare is a right!

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Healthcare is a right!

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Healthcare is a right!

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Healthcare is a right!
