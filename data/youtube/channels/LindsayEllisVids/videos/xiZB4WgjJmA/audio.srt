1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Witches, am I right?

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:09,640
If you're a woman in Hollywood over the age of 35, you've probably played one.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,540
In fact, you're probably in the process of playing a witch right now.

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,920
This can speak to many facets regarding the way we view women in Hollywood, but I don't

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,120
think all of them necessarily bad.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,120
Go.

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,040
Go away.

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,840
No longer is the witch a one-note archetype.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:32,120
No, sir, now she is a complex figure with motivations and a backstory.

10
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,120
Some of the time.

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:40,620
With that in mind, who better to talk about than the Wicked Witch of the West, arguably

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,900
the most famous witch of the 20th century, and the template for a good 30% of all Halloween

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,900
costumes.

14
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,800
So, what even is a witch?

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,100
Witch is a pretty broad term, it can apply to pretty much any magical woman, although

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,560
the connotation does tend to be pejorative.

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,920
One of the earliest examples was the Seer of Endor, which was later translated as the

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,740
Witch of Endor, whom King Saul of Israel goes to learn the future because God won't talk

19
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,740
to him.

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,960
Witches are often a source of dangerous wisdom we see similar to the Witch of Endor thousands

21
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,440
of years later with Macbeth's weird sisters.

22
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,920
Again, they're not really evil per se, but they're still mysterious and scary and you

23
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,600
don't want to go there, Macbeth.

24
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,840
During the Middle Ages, as Europe got more and more, well, shitty, the idea of the witch

25
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,780
became more and more associated with the Christian devil, the archetype of the old hag becomes

26
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:35,020
more prominent, witches became associated with brooms.

27
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,460
Where did the broom thing come from?

28
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:41,300
Well, it's hard to pinpoint exactly, but the root of any folk villain tends to deal with

29
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,340
some cultural anxiety, and the witch archetype is European anxiety about women straying from

30
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,740
the very, very narrow box set out for them, so witch iconography utilizes signifiers of

31
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,700
the domestic, but wrong.

32
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,800
You're supposed to use that broom to clean the floor, not fly around.

33
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,840
So when we look at the Wicked Witch of the West, what we see is a distillation of all

34
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,000
of these many hundreds of years of iconography into the ultimate modern archetype for the

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
witch.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
She's got it all!

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,640
Except for the cat.

38
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,880
She's got flying monkeys instead.

39
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,480
Originally a children's book villain, the last hundred years have seen the Wicked Witch

40
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:23,200
of the West be expanded upon in many ways, but being honest we are pretty much going

41
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,900
to use the 1939 film as our bedrock for this discussion, as much as, if not more so than

42
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,900
the original book.

43
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,580
Which is an important distinction to make for one reason, the 1939 film is still under

44
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,980
copyright where L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is not.

45
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,020
So as always, as there are roughly one shit billion different versions of the Wizard of

46
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,920
Oz, this does not include every single version of the Wicked Witch of the West.

47
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,780
So, with that in mind, the Wicked Witch of the West.

48
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,660
There are entire books dedicated to political interpretations of Baum's fiction.

49
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,900
Not that he was necessarily doing it deliberately, the intentionality of anything he put in his

50
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:23,360
books is completely up for debate, but reading politics into the world of Oz is super popular

51
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,320
and super common.

52
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,080
The ruby slippers in the 39 version, in the book they were silver slippers and they represent

53
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,960
like the gold standard and the silverite 16, well actually no, the yellow brick road is

54
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,640
the like dissolution of the gold standard or something, I don't know.

55
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,960
And this is not by Baum's admission, this is just popular conjecture.

56
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,880
That said, the world of Oz is one in which almost all of the power players, good and

57
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,240
bad, are women.

58
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,700
So when you look at all that and Baum's political leanings, it's no coincidence that these books

59
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,060
came out during the height of the suffrage movement.

60
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,020
In the grand scheme of Baum's universe, the Wicked Witch of the West is not a huge player.

61
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,340
She's only in that first novel, and even then, not in Towards the End when the Wizard gives

62
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,740
Dorothy and her pals a murder quest.

63
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,060
And the book's version of the Witch is nothing like what we've come to associate with the

64
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,560
words Wicked Witch of the West.

65
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,140
She doesn't have green skin, she doesn't have a broom, she's short and frumpy, the Wizard

66
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:21,400
doesn't ask them to grab anything from her, Dorothy does wet her out of spite rather than

67
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,140
trying to save the Scarecrow, but is likewise surprised that water melts her.

68
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:31,560
So rather than chief antagonist villain ultra of the universe, this Witch is more just an

69
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,880
obstacle that needs to be overcome in the first book.

70
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,360
But at the end of the day, not a huge power player in the grand scheme of Oz.

71
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,520
So what would change that perception?

72
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:58,480
Where the book is episodic, structured more like The Hobbit, I mean the book, not the

73
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:04,580
nine hour epic, the 1939 film takes on a much more traditional Hollywood structure, setting

74
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,040
up the Wicked Witch as the chief antagonist even before Dorothy gets to Oz.

75
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,800
We first see her, arguably, or her equivalent, as a miserly old spinster named Miss Gulch,

76
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,700
It was after Dorothy's dog, Toto, because Toto bit her.

77
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,700
My leg!

78
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,700
Me, she bit you?

79
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,700
No, her dog.

80
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,860
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?

81
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,740
Gail Sondergaard was originally cast as the Wicked Witch when the film was more overtly

82
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,860
influenced by Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

83
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:38,700
The Wicked Witch wasn't going to be a post-Apple Disney witch, but a sexy, intimidating, pre-Apple

84
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,700
kind of witch.

85
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,780
I've never heard of a beautiful witch before.

86
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,180
Only bad witches are ugly.

87
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,080
Well, there you go, Dorothy, words to live by.

88
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,520
When they decided to lose this felt-sexy witch and do the more conventional ugly hag-witch

89
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,680
instead, Gail Sondergaard did not like that, and she bailed.

90
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,160
And in comes Margaret Hamilton.

91
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,200
These things must be done delicately.

92
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,560
Margaret Hamilton gunned real hard for this part, and she loved being the witch, despite

93
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,180
the fact that in the process she got burned really bad.

94
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,480
Like literally, with fire.

95
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:15,140
On this little elevator that went down slowly or went down fast, in this case, it dropped

96
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,940
out from under me, and we ran to the first aid station.

97
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,380
I had a second degree on my face and a third on my hand.

98
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:22,880
Ah!

99
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,780
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

100
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,280
Ah!

101
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:25,780
Ah!

102
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,280
Ah!

103
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:26,780
Ah!

104
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,280
Ah!

105
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,780
Ah!

106
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,280
Ah!

107
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:28,780
Ah!

108
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,280
Ah!

109
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:29,780
Ah!

110
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,280
Ah!

111
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,780
Ah!

112
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,280
Ah!

113
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:31,780
Ah!

114
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,280
Ah!

115
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:32,780
Ah!

116
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,280
Ah!

117
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:33,780
Ah!

118
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,280
Ah!

119
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:34,780
Ah!

120
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,280
Ah!

121
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,780
Ah!

122
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,280
Ah!

123
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:36,780
Ah!

124
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,280
Ah!

125
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:37,780
Ah!

126
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,280
Ah!

127
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:38,780
Ah!

128
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,280
Ah!

129
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,580
And they're mangy little dogs, too.

130
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,380
Like, it's just timeless, and when you consider what a shitshow this was behind the scenes,

131
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,580
the sheer number of directors that came and went during production, this movie is kind

132
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,580
of a miracle.

133
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,080
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

134
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,480
And 75 years on, Margaret Hamilton's Wicked Witch of the West is still one of the most

135
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,780
iconic movie villains in film history.

136
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,980
Ah!

137
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,280
You cursed brat!

138
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,780
Look what you've done!

139
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,980
Next!

140
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,480
Oh, please, oh, beautiful one!

141
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,980
We haven't had a lunch hour in six months!

142
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:20,480
Well, suffering is free for the soul.

143
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,980
Now suffer!

144
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,980
Oof.

145
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:30,480
So, 40 years pass before we get another big-budget studio Wizard of Oz movie.

146
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:36,280
The agonizingly long The Wiz, adapted from and almost completely omitting the stage musical

147
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:42,280
of the same name, directed by Academy Award-winning director of 12 Angry Men, Sidney Lumet, and

148
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,480
written by Joel Schumacher.

149
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:51,480
What an obvious team to create this funky fresh reimagining of The Wizard of Oz.

150
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,480
The witch isn't even mentioned till it's time to go kill her.

151
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:00,480
Her name is Evelyn, and she appears to be the, uh, slave lord of a sweatshop, which

152
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,180
is kind of weird.

153
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,480
She also has a whip, which is, uh, also weird.

154
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,480
Ahh!

155
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,480
She marches around in what looks to be the most uncomfortable dressed imaginable, and

156
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,480
has eyeballs on her crown, which might be a reference to this all-seeing telescope eye

157
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,480
thing that she has in the book.

158
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,480
Like Wicked Witch Prime, this witch is barely in it, but, unlike the Margaret Hamilton version,

159
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,480
she actually gets a song.

160
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:42,480
Before she gets melted in perhaps the most non-melting-melting scene out of all of them.

161
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,480
The witch portions are among the better paced in the film.

162
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,480
And if we ignore the uncomfortable slave stuff, I even kind of dig her song.

163
00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:03,480
Even so, I'm not so sure about this witch.

164
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,480
What.

165
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,480
Is.

166
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,480
Hell?

167
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,480
Okay.

168
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,480
Next.

169
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,480
Skipping forward almost another twenty years, it is time for a re-examination of the classic

170
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,480
witch archetype, and one of the most influential books ever on that topic, Gregory Maguire's

171
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,480
Wicked colon The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West.

172
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,480
Most of Maguire's well-known books deal with popular stories and characters that just happen

173
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,480
to be in the public domain, and Wicked is no exception.

174
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,480
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz itself and its characters and concepts entered the public

175
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
domain in 1956.

176
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,480
MGM's 1939 film, however, has not.

177
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,480
Maguire's book borrows from both, but being a book, it can get away with a lot more than

178
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
a movie can.

179
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,480
Here, the witch's name is Elphaba.

180
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,480
Get it?

181
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,480
Like, El Frank Bomb?

182
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,480
Elphaba?

183
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,480
Get it?

184
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,480
Wicked utilizes many book-only concepts, such as the geography of the countries, the shoes

185
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,480
being silver, etc.

186
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,480
Maguire also introduces many of his own ideas.

187
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,480
For instance, not only that talking animals exist, but exist as a different type of person

188
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,480
altogether, and that even Oz operates on something of an apartheid system pushed by

189
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,480
the wizard himself.

190
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,480
This being Elphaba's main motivation for turning on the system, as she does, becoming

191
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,480
Wicked.

192
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,480
Buuuuut there are some major elements that are very rooted in the 1939 film.

193
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,480
Elphaba's greenness not only isolates her within the world of the novel, it's also a

194
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,480
major plot point.

195
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:43,480
See, the Wizard of Oz used this green elixir to basically drug and seduce Elphaba's mother.

196
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,480
Seduce.

197
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,480
Not the right word.

198
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,480
She's also got the pointy hat, and she got the broom, which she uses for murder at one

199
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,480
point.

200
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,480
So, one can argue that the most important influences from the 1939 movie on Maguire's

201
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,480
book are purely aesthetic, and therefore can't really be subject to copyright law, which

202
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,480
is probably true.

203
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,480
But since the book got adapted into a very popular and still-running musical on Broadway,

204
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,480
well, they somehow got away with it.

205
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,480
Wicked is kind of musical than musical.

206
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,480
Like, your mom loves it.

207
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,480
It's less political than the book, more about romance and Elphaba's desire to be accepted

208
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,480
and then revolution happens, but still romance.

209
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,480
And the Wizard's less awful.

210
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,480
And in a way, it's the perfect Broadway musical.

211
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,480
It's based on a familiar thing, but it's still a new story, so you're not just watching

212
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,480
a stage version of a movie you've already seen.

213
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,480
Ahem, hem, hem, hem, hem, hem.

214
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,480
Elphaba in the show is a sort of proto-Elsa from Frozen in many ways, not the least of

215
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,480
which being originally portrayed by Idina Menzel, whose signature song is proto-Let

216
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,480
It Go.

217
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,480
The major difference is the way the romance is handled.

218
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,480
She goes into a years-long stupor in the book, during which she gives birth and forgets about

219
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,480
it.

220
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,480
Apparently.

221
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,480
Love interest may or may not have died horribly, but is probably dead, but it's not really

222
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,480
clear by the end.

223
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,480
Musical, she fakes her death and runs off with the bay.

224
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,480
The end.

225
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:33,480
Also, the Wizard is not as evil, nor is he explicitly a date rapist, so there is that.

226
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,480
There is debate as to the merits of the book versus the musical, and I think Gregory Maguire

227
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,480
had really interesting ideas in worldbuilding, but I don't much care for how detached he

228
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,480
is in his writing.

229
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,480
I like the book more in theory, I prefer the musical in practice.

230
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,480
Next.

231
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,480
Oh, man.

232
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,480
Why is this called Tin Man?

233
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,480
Well, originally, he was going to be the main character, but then it turned into more of

234
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:31,480
just a Wizard of Oz retelling, and so now Dorothy- D.G., her name is D.G., she comes

235
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,480
to the O.Z.

236
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
It's called the O.Z., means Outer Zone.

237
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,480
Well, anyway, so the Tin Man was originally going to be the main character, and it was

238
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,480
going to be like a witch murder mystery, but then they decided it should be more of an

239
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,480
analogue to the original book, and D.G. is the main character, but they kept the title

240
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,480
anyway.

241
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,480
I don't know.

242
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,480
My name's D.G., what's yours?

243
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,480
Boy, howdy, is it becoming a race to the bottom for who is the worst Dorothy.

244
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,480
You guys are out of your tiny minds!

245
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,480
Concentrate, concentrate, concentrate, we're talking about the witch.

246
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,480
This also purports to be inspired by the public domain book, but of course there are many

247
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,480
elements lifted from the 39 movie here, too.

248
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,480
D.G., where are you?

249
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
Dorothy!

250
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,480
Where are you?

251
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,480
Regarding the witch, the elements typically lifted from the movie aren't present, though.

252
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,480
No broom, no green skin.

253
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,480
The Wicked Witch in this version is actually Dor- D.G.'s sister, and her name is Azkadilia,

254
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,480
which I'm pretty sure is the name of one of my fanfic self-insert characters from the

255
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,480
sixth grade.

256
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,480
Azkadilia's my sister.

257
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,480
Here she's more of an innocence lost character, and also, like, possessed.

258
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,480
Let go.

259
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,480
No.

260
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,480
D.G. accidentally got Azkadilia possessed by another witch as a child, and they had

261
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:51,480
like, this special hand-holding magic, but D.G. f***ed it up, and Azkadilia got possessed,

262
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,480
and then D.G. got raised by robot parents.

263
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,480
We are Series 1487.

264
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
Nurture units.

265
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,480
So, Tin Man straddles this weird line between retelling and completely off in its own little world.

266
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,480
Glinda Analogue is here, but she's the mom, because these reboots do so love them some familial things.

267
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,480
The witch does not get melted at the end, but instead gets de-possessed by hand-holding magic.

268
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,480
So rather than melting the witch, sisterly love conquers all.

269
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,480
Another proto-frozen.

270
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,480
So that's nice.

271
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,480
The witch is gone.

272
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,480
It's over.

273
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,480
In a lot of ways, Tin Man is the most interesting out of all of these,

274
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,480
but I get the impression that it was written by people with, you know, imagination and creativity,

275
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,480
and then the studio was like, no, people are stupid.

276
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,480
Make it dumber.

277
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,480
Come on, Tin Man, have a heart.

278
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:49,480
So, as cool as a lot of the details and ideas in Tin Man are, the watch itself is a bit of a slog.

279
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,480
She tried to kill me.

280
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,480
No.

281
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,480
She did kill you.

282
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,480
Next.

283
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,480
This TV special is mine!

284
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,480
Kong sah, so you can leave!

285
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,480
The sofa, shoes, and the door!

286
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,480
So this is the worst puppet movie.

287
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,480
Bonjour!

288
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,480
Witch of the West coming at you from my lair of evil!

289
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,480
And again, it's a race to the bottom for worst Dorothy ever.

290
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,480
Ashanti and Zooey Deschanel are neck and neck.

291
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
Sorry, I know, keep focus.

292
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,480
I mean, just people who shit on Diana Ross.

293
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,480
Look at the competition.

294
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,480
Come on.

295
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,480
Check it out, your little show's about to be canceled.

296
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,480
Since Miss Piggy is really the only female Muppet of note,

297
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,480
like, come on, Janice Stans, we know she doesn't really matter,

298
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,480
Muppet Oz takes the interesting, and honestly I'm kind of surprised no one's ever done this before,

299
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,480
the approach of having all of the witches played by the same actress.

300
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,480
Well, you know, actress.

301
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:48,480
Two of which are involved in the most horrifying scenes ever with a Muppet.

302
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,480
This.

303
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,480
Wow, this is a lot heavier than I could get.

304
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,480
And then the melting scene, which is probably a low for Miss Piggy.

305
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,480
It's definitely a low for Miss Piggy.

306
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,480
And that's saying something.

307
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,480
I'm not melting, I'm getting skinny!

308
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,480
I'm getting skinny!

309
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,480
I win, I win!

310
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,480
What?

311
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,480
And cut.

312
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,480
It turns into this, like, Ark of the Covenant kind of horror show.

313
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,480
I think it's supposed to be funny, but nobody wants to see this.

314
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,480
No one wants to see this.

315
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
Muppets.

316
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,480
So, this was right after the Muppets were bought by Disney, and way before the recent curmasaunts.

317
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,480
By the time you get to the witch, you're longing for death so badly you don't even care how awful she is.

318
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,480
Which is good, because halfway through the end battle, this happens.

319
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,480
And then, just as Dorothy and the Wicked Witch charge at each other,

320
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,480
Bam! Blowout fight scene.

321
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,480
The gals whip out these huge samurai swords,

322
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,480
and they just tear it up.

323
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,480
I'm talking kung-fu.

324
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,480
It can't get worse than this, can it?

325
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,480
So, I was going to say that the worst thing about you guys choosing, you, you did this,

326
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,480
you choosing the Wicked Witch of the West for this video,

327
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,480
was the fact that I had to watch this f***ing movie again.

328
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,480
But then, I had to watch the Muppet version, so that did put it in perspective.

329
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,480
Because there's a lot I can live with.

330
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,480
I can live with the fact that Franco looks high all the time,

331
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,480
and the bottomlessness to how much he does not care about his performance.

332
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,480
I can live with the tired-ass shitty, like, faker is deemed to be the chosen one

333
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,480
the second he lands in this wonderful world and he lies to everyone narrative.

334
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,480
God, I hate that plot.

335
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,480
I can even live with the fact that the studio took a universe that almost always had female protagonists,

336
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,480
or males that turned into females, and gave it a male one.

337
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,480
But I cannot take the reason why the Wicked Witch is wicked.

338
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,480
I want him to see me like this.

339
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,480
I want him to know that he was the one who made me this way.

340
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,480
It's just so lame.

341
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,480
It's like a layer cake of lame.

342
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,480
You peel back one layer and it's like, ugh, really?

343
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,480
Like, I don't know what's worse, that it's ultimately like she's a woman scorned by James Franco, of all people.

344
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,480
And that's why she's wicked.

345
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,480
Or the fact that it's actually, like, a poison given to her by her sister,

346
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,480
and she has no agency in her own wickedness.

347
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,480
See, it's not her fault that she's wicked, but it kind of is.

348
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,480
But it isn't, because poison, but it is, I don't know, it's stupid.

349
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:08,480
It really is the anti-wicked, where in Wicked she was like this anarchic activist fighting for the rights of the oppressed.

350
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,480
Here she is, a woman scorned.

351
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,480
Who isn't really, because hey, it isn't her fault she caught the evil.

352
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,480
Her sister gave it to her.

353
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,480
Curse you!

354
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,480
And it's also the worst performance.

355
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,480
They will run and flee for their health!

356
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,480
We shall not let them flee!

357
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,480
We shall show them no mercy!

358
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,480
You are welcome to return.

359
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,480
Never!

360
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,480
Disney having to be mindful of copyright ramifications once again plays a major element here,

361
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,480
the most prominent of which, which, which, was the look of the witch herself.

362
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:53,480
Namely, the shade of green that could not be infringed upon, or Margaret Hamilton's iconic black dress.

363
00:20:53,480 --> 00:21:00,480
So if you're wondering about all that décolletage, that's sort of why. Sort of.

364
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,480
There are elements to this movie that aren't the worst thing ever.

365
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,480
In fact, this movie might have just been passively boring had it not done the thing,

366
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,480
but pretty much every decision surrounding The Wicked Witch of the West is the worst decision they could have made.

367
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:25,480
So if anything is going to make you appreciate Wicked, it is Oz the Great and Powerful.

368
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,480
Next.

369
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:33,480
The queen may be evil, but I'm wicked.

370
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,480
Wicked always wins.

371
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,480
Woof. Okay, okay. It's not as bad as the last two.

372
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,480
Perspective, perspective everybody, we're almost done.

373
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,480
Once again, a lot based on the 39 movie.

374
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,480
You see the copyright sidestepping with the off-brand Margaret Hamilton.

375
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,480
She's got this weird-ass shade of green that makes her look like she's sweating all the time,

376
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,480
but her dress is pretty awesome, so there's that.

377
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,480
I have to take it in a little bit at the hips, but it looks better on me, don't you think?

378
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,480
This show...

379
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,480
This show...

380
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,480
Huh.

381
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:17,480
Okay, so if you've never seen this show, it's like Disney's great big domestic AU fanfic.

382
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,480
Some of the time.

383
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,480
Something something spell something something.

384
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,480
Now we're in the normal world, but sometimes we're not because sometimes there's a curse.

385
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,480
This tends to change with the villain.

386
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,480
It was the evil queen of Snow White who was the spellcaster for a while,

387
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,480
but in this particular arc it's the Wicked Witch of the West, but then it turns out it's not.

388
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:44,480
Anyway, she is Snow White's evil queen's half-sister because she's always someone's sister or daughter or something.

389
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,480
I'm your sister.

390
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,480
But Wizard of Oz isn't really a known Disney thing, so why the Wicked Witch?

391
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,480
It's not till we get to her tragic backstory episode that we actually get to see Oz

392
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,480
and the Oz logo and the wizard himself and it's like...

393
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,480
Oh.

394
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,480
I see all. I am Oz the Great and Terrible.

395
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,480
Oz the Great and Vertically Integrated.

396
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,480
I'm just a circus huxer. I'm a showman.

397
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,480
Oh my god, they are just laying it all out there.

398
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,480
I'm just a con man.

399
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,480
I'm a carnival magician.

400
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:35,480
So Wicked Elphaba is green because of a date rape drug, great and powerful because heart killing drug.

401
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,480
So why are you green once upon a time, Wicked Witch?

402
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,480
She's not nearly as powerful as me. She doesn't deserve to have you as a danger.

403
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,480
Careful, Selina. You're turning green, dearie.

404
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,480
Envy will do that to you.

405
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,480
Yep, she literally turns green with envy.

406
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,480
We'll see about that.

407
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,480
She's also motivated by the desire to destroy her half-sister, the Evil Queen.

408
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,480
What the hell did I ever do to you?

409
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,480
Yeah.

410
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,480
You were born.

411
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,480
Well, okay then.

412
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:14,480
It's all rather convoluted. She does get doused by Dorothy, but this doesn't kill her.

413
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,480
Rumpelstiltskin does, because he's a major character.

414
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,480
And he's also the Beast.

415
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,480
Just...

416
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,480
Rumpelstiltskin never breaks.

417
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,480
And she doesn't melt, she shatters.

418
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,480
So given when this aired, the year after Oz the Great and Powerful was released,

419
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,480
we might be able to read this as something of a brand integration.

420
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,480
Subtle, but distinctive on its own.

421
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,480
But given there's been no real news on the sequel in two years,

422
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,480
they may have just been hedging their brand bets,

423
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,480
and keep on borrowing from the legacy of that 39 movie while we're there.

424
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,480
Disney just wants the rights to that movie so bad.

425
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,480
Something beautifully ironic for Disney wanting to slip in there

426
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,480
and wibble their way around all that copyright that MGM still holds for The Wizard of Oz,

427
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:09,480
and yet what company is most responsible for the extension of the length of copyright?

428
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,480
Hmm...

429
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,480
Who could it be?

430
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,480
To examine different incarnations of the Wicked Witch of the West

431
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,480
To examine different incarnations of the Wicked Witch of the West

432
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,480
is to examine our relationship to the iconography of the witch.

433
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,480
But as audiences grow and change,

434
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,480
we're just not interested in the idea of inherent evil witch anymore.

435
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,480
The idea that a powerful solitary woman is no longer as strange and perverse as it used to be.

436
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
Now it's even sympathetic.

437
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,480
Sometimes.

438
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,480
I think maybe Disney should keep its mitts off of Oz for a little while.

439
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,480
There's this episode of Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood that featured Margaret Hamilton,

440
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,480
and she talks a bit about actually playing the witch,

441
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,480
and how children shouldn't be scared of her.

442
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,480
You know, she was just acting. It's like playing make-believe.

443
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,480
And it is the cutest thing.

444
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,480
But there is one bit that sticks out to me.

445
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:11,480
And I just think that sometimes we think she's just mean and a very bad person,

446
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,480
but actually you have to think about her point of view.

447
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:21,480
It wasn't as happy a time as she wanted it to be, because she just never got what she wanted.

448
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,480
See? Maggie gets it.

449
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,480
Even the Wickedest of Witches has their own motivation.

450
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,480
True, I can't attend you here and now as I'd like.

451
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,480
But just try to stay out of my way. Just try.

452
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,480
So the last three Loose Cannon episodes have been about villains, or at least, you know, villain-ish.

453
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,480
So the next theme will be some flavor of real American-ish hero.

454
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,480
Here are your three choices. You can vote in the link below.

455
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,480
If you like this series, please consider supporting it on Patreon.

456
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:52,480
These episodes take a really long time to produce, and I'd like to do it more often.

457
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,480
That link is also below this video.

458
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,480
And I will announce the winner for this thing on Twitter.

459
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,480
Follow me here.

460
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,480
And hopefully I will do it sooner than two months from now.

461
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,480
And thank you for watching.

462
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,480
Thanks for watching!
