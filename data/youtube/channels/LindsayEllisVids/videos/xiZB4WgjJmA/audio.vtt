00:00.000 --> 00:02.480
Witches, am I right?

00:02.480 --> 00:09.640
If you're a woman in Hollywood over the age of 35, you've probably played one.

00:09.640 --> 00:13.540
In fact, you're probably in the process of playing a witch right now.

00:13.540 --> 00:17.920
This can speak to many facets regarding the way we view women in Hollywood, but I don't

00:17.920 --> 00:21.120
think all of them necessarily bad.

00:21.120 --> 00:22.120
Go.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.040
Go away.

00:24.040 --> 00:25.840
No longer is the witch a one-note archetype.

00:26.280 --> 00:32.120
No, sir, now she is a complex figure with motivations and a backstory.

00:32.120 --> 00:34.120
Some of the time.

00:34.120 --> 00:40.620
With that in mind, who better to talk about than the Wicked Witch of the West, arguably

00:40.620 --> 00:45.900
the most famous witch of the 20th century, and the template for a good 30% of all Halloween

00:45.900 --> 00:46.900
costumes.

00:46.900 --> 00:50.800
So, what even is a witch?

00:50.800 --> 00:55.100
Witch is a pretty broad term, it can apply to pretty much any magical woman, although

00:55.100 --> 00:57.560
the connotation does tend to be pejorative.

00:57.560 --> 01:01.920
One of the earliest examples was the Seer of Endor, which was later translated as the

01:01.920 --> 01:06.740
Witch of Endor, whom King Saul of Israel goes to learn the future because God won't talk

01:06.740 --> 01:07.740
to him.

01:07.740 --> 01:11.960
Witches are often a source of dangerous wisdom we see similar to the Witch of Endor thousands

01:11.960 --> 01:14.440
of years later with Macbeth's weird sisters.

01:14.440 --> 01:18.920
Again, they're not really evil per se, but they're still mysterious and scary and you

01:18.920 --> 01:20.600
don't want to go there, Macbeth.

01:20.600 --> 01:24.840
During the Middle Ages, as Europe got more and more, well, shitty, the idea of the witch

01:24.860 --> 01:29.780
became more and more associated with the Christian devil, the archetype of the old hag becomes

01:29.780 --> 01:35.020
more prominent, witches became associated with brooms.

01:35.020 --> 01:36.460
Where did the broom thing come from?

01:36.460 --> 01:41.300
Well, it's hard to pinpoint exactly, but the root of any folk villain tends to deal with

01:41.300 --> 01:46.340
some cultural anxiety, and the witch archetype is European anxiety about women straying from

01:46.340 --> 01:51.740
the very, very narrow box set out for them, so witch iconography utilizes signifiers of

01:51.740 --> 01:53.700
the domestic, but wrong.

01:54.560 --> 01:58.800
You're supposed to use that broom to clean the floor, not fly around.

01:58.800 --> 02:01.840
So when we look at the Wicked Witch of the West, what we see is a distillation of all

02:01.840 --> 02:07.000
of these many hundreds of years of iconography into the ultimate modern archetype for the

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
witch.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
She's got it all!

02:09.000 --> 02:10.640
Except for the cat.

02:10.640 --> 02:13.880
She's got flying monkeys instead.

02:13.880 --> 02:17.480
Originally a children's book villain, the last hundred years have seen the Wicked Witch

02:17.480 --> 02:23.200
of the West be expanded upon in many ways, but being honest we are pretty much going

02:23.200 --> 02:28.900
to use the 1939 film as our bedrock for this discussion, as much as, if not more so than

02:28.900 --> 02:29.900
the original book.

02:29.900 --> 02:35.580
Which is an important distinction to make for one reason, the 1939 film is still under

02:35.580 --> 02:40.980
copyright where L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is not.

02:40.980 --> 02:46.020
So as always, as there are roughly one shit billion different versions of the Wizard of

02:46.020 --> 02:49.920
Oz, this does not include every single version of the Wicked Witch of the West.

02:49.940 --> 02:53.780
So, with that in mind, the Wicked Witch of the West.

03:09.100 --> 03:13.660
There are entire books dedicated to political interpretations of Baum's fiction.

03:13.660 --> 03:17.900
Not that he was necessarily doing it deliberately, the intentionality of anything he put in his

03:17.900 --> 03:23.360
books is completely up for debate, but reading politics into the world of Oz is super popular

03:23.360 --> 03:25.320
and super common.

03:25.320 --> 03:30.080
The ruby slippers in the 39 version, in the book they were silver slippers and they represent

03:30.080 --> 03:34.960
like the gold standard and the silverite 16, well actually no, the yellow brick road is

03:34.960 --> 03:37.640
the like dissolution of the gold standard or something, I don't know.

03:37.640 --> 03:41.960
And this is not by Baum's admission, this is just popular conjecture.

03:41.960 --> 03:46.880
That said, the world of Oz is one in which almost all of the power players, good and

03:46.880 --> 03:48.240
bad, are women.

03:48.240 --> 03:51.700
So when you look at all that and Baum's political leanings, it's no coincidence that these books

03:51.700 --> 03:54.060
came out during the height of the suffrage movement.

03:54.060 --> 03:59.020
In the grand scheme of Baum's universe, the Wicked Witch of the West is not a huge player.

03:59.020 --> 04:03.340
She's only in that first novel, and even then, not in Towards the End when the Wizard gives

04:03.340 --> 04:05.740
Dorothy and her pals a murder quest.

04:05.740 --> 04:09.060
And the book's version of the Witch is nothing like what we've come to associate with the

04:09.060 --> 04:11.560
words Wicked Witch of the West.

04:11.560 --> 04:16.140
She doesn't have green skin, she doesn't have a broom, she's short and frumpy, the Wizard

04:16.140 --> 04:21.400
doesn't ask them to grab anything from her, Dorothy does wet her out of spite rather than

04:21.400 --> 04:26.140
trying to save the Scarecrow, but is likewise surprised that water melts her.

04:26.140 --> 04:31.560
So rather than chief antagonist villain ultra of the universe, this Witch is more just an

04:31.560 --> 04:33.880
obstacle that needs to be overcome in the first book.

04:33.880 --> 04:38.360
But at the end of the day, not a huge power player in the grand scheme of Oz.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.520
So what would change that perception?

04:46.140 --> 04:58.480
Where the book is episodic, structured more like The Hobbit, I mean the book, not the

04:58.480 --> 05:04.580
nine hour epic, the 1939 film takes on a much more traditional Hollywood structure, setting

05:04.580 --> 05:09.040
up the Wicked Witch as the chief antagonist even before Dorothy gets to Oz.

05:09.040 --> 05:14.800
We first see her, arguably, or her equivalent, as a miserly old spinster named Miss Gulch,

05:14.820 --> 05:17.700
It was after Dorothy's dog, Toto, because Toto bit her.

05:17.700 --> 05:18.700
My leg!

05:18.700 --> 05:19.700
Me, she bit you?

05:19.700 --> 05:20.700
No, her dog.

05:20.700 --> 05:24.860
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?

05:24.860 --> 05:28.740
Gail Sondergaard was originally cast as the Wicked Witch when the film was more overtly

05:28.740 --> 05:31.860
influenced by Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

05:31.860 --> 05:38.700
The Wicked Witch wasn't going to be a post-Apple Disney witch, but a sexy, intimidating, pre-Apple

05:38.700 --> 05:39.700
kind of witch.

05:39.700 --> 05:42.780
I've never heard of a beautiful witch before.

05:42.780 --> 05:44.180
Only bad witches are ugly.

05:44.560 --> 05:47.080
Well, there you go, Dorothy, words to live by.

05:47.080 --> 05:51.520
When they decided to lose this felt-sexy witch and do the more conventional ugly hag-witch

05:51.520 --> 05:54.680
instead, Gail Sondergaard did not like that, and she bailed.

05:54.680 --> 05:56.160
And in comes Margaret Hamilton.

05:56.160 --> 06:00.200
These things must be done delicately.

06:00.200 --> 06:04.560
Margaret Hamilton gunned real hard for this part, and she loved being the witch, despite

06:04.560 --> 06:08.180
the fact that in the process she got burned really bad.

06:08.180 --> 06:09.480
Like literally, with fire.

06:09.480 --> 06:15.140
On this little elevator that went down slowly or went down fast, in this case, it dropped

06:15.140 --> 06:18.940
out from under me, and we ran to the first aid station.

06:18.940 --> 06:22.380
I had a second degree on my face and a third on my hand.

06:22.380 --> 06:22.880
Ah!

06:22.880 --> 06:24.780
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

06:24.780 --> 06:25.280
Ah!

06:25.280 --> 06:25.780
Ah!

06:25.780 --> 06:26.280
Ah!

06:26.280 --> 06:26.780
Ah!

06:26.780 --> 06:27.280
Ah!

06:27.280 --> 06:27.780
Ah!

06:27.780 --> 06:28.280
Ah!

06:28.280 --> 06:28.780
Ah!

06:28.780 --> 06:29.280
Ah!

06:29.280 --> 06:29.780
Ah!

06:29.780 --> 06:30.280
Ah!

06:30.280 --> 06:30.780
Ah!

06:30.780 --> 06:31.280
Ah!

06:31.280 --> 06:31.780
Ah!

06:31.780 --> 06:32.280
Ah!

06:32.280 --> 06:32.780
Ah!

06:32.780 --> 06:33.280
Ah!

06:33.280 --> 06:33.780
Ah!

06:33.780 --> 06:34.280
Ah!

06:34.280 --> 06:34.780
Ah!

06:34.780 --> 06:35.280
Ah!

06:35.280 --> 06:35.780
Ah!

06:35.780 --> 06:36.280
Ah!

06:36.280 --> 06:36.780
Ah!

06:36.780 --> 06:37.280
Ah!

06:37.280 --> 06:37.780
Ah!

06:37.780 --> 06:38.280
Ah!

06:38.280 --> 06:38.780
Ah!

06:38.780 --> 06:39.280
Ah!

06:39.780 --> 06:41.580
And they're mangy little dogs, too.

06:42.080 --> 06:46.380
Like, it's just timeless, and when you consider what a shitshow this was behind the scenes,

06:46.380 --> 06:50.580
the sheer number of directors that came and went during production, this movie is kind

06:50.580 --> 06:51.580
of a miracle.

06:51.580 --> 06:55.080
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

06:55.080 --> 06:59.480
And 75 years on, Margaret Hamilton's Wicked Witch of the West is still one of the most

06:59.480 --> 07:02.780
iconic movie villains in film history.

07:02.780 --> 07:03.980
Ah!

07:03.980 --> 07:05.280
You cursed brat!

07:05.280 --> 07:06.780
Look what you've done!

07:06.780 --> 07:07.980
Next!

07:08.480 --> 07:11.480
Oh, please, oh, beautiful one!

07:11.480 --> 07:14.980
We haven't had a lunch hour in six months!

07:14.980 --> 07:20.480
Well, suffering is free for the soul.

07:20.480 --> 07:22.980
Now suffer!

07:22.980 --> 07:23.980
Oof.

07:25.980 --> 07:30.480
So, 40 years pass before we get another big-budget studio Wizard of Oz movie.

07:30.480 --> 07:36.280
The agonizingly long The Wiz, adapted from and almost completely omitting the stage musical

07:36.280 --> 07:42.280
of the same name, directed by Academy Award-winning director of 12 Angry Men, Sidney Lumet, and

07:42.280 --> 07:45.480
written by Joel Schumacher.

07:45.480 --> 07:51.480
What an obvious team to create this funky fresh reimagining of The Wizard of Oz.

07:51.480 --> 07:54.480
The witch isn't even mentioned till it's time to go kill her.

07:54.480 --> 08:00.480
Her name is Evelyn, and she appears to be the, uh, slave lord of a sweatshop, which

08:00.480 --> 08:02.180
is kind of weird.

08:02.180 --> 08:05.480
She also has a whip, which is, uh, also weird.

08:05.480 --> 08:06.480
Ahh!

08:12.480 --> 08:16.480
She marches around in what looks to be the most uncomfortable dressed imaginable, and

08:16.480 --> 08:21.480
has eyeballs on her crown, which might be a reference to this all-seeing telescope eye

08:21.480 --> 08:23.480
thing that she has in the book.

08:23.480 --> 08:28.480
Like Wicked Witch Prime, this witch is barely in it, but, unlike the Margaret Hamilton version,

08:28.480 --> 08:30.480
she actually gets a song.

08:30.480 --> 08:42.480
Before she gets melted in perhaps the most non-melting-melting scene out of all of them.

08:45.480 --> 08:48.480
The witch portions are among the better paced in the film.

08:48.480 --> 08:52.480
And if we ignore the uncomfortable slave stuff, I even kind of dig her song.

08:52.480 --> 09:03.480
Even so, I'm not so sure about this witch.

09:03.480 --> 09:04.480
What.

09:04.480 --> 09:05.480
Is.

09:05.480 --> 09:06.480
Hell?

09:09.480 --> 09:10.480
Okay.

09:10.480 --> 09:11.480
Next.

09:14.480 --> 09:18.480
Skipping forward almost another twenty years, it is time for a re-examination of the classic

09:18.480 --> 09:24.480
witch archetype, and one of the most influential books ever on that topic, Gregory Maguire's

09:24.480 --> 09:27.480
Wicked colon The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West.

09:27.480 --> 09:32.480
Most of Maguire's well-known books deal with popular stories and characters that just happen

09:32.480 --> 09:36.480
to be in the public domain, and Wicked is no exception.

09:36.480 --> 09:40.480
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz itself and its characters and concepts entered the public

09:40.480 --> 09:42.480
domain in 1956.

09:42.480 --> 09:46.480
MGM's 1939 film, however, has not.

09:46.480 --> 09:51.480
Maguire's book borrows from both, but being a book, it can get away with a lot more than

09:51.480 --> 09:52.480
a movie can.

09:52.480 --> 09:55.480
Here, the witch's name is Elphaba.

09:55.480 --> 09:56.480
Get it?

09:56.480 --> 09:57.480
Like, El Frank Bomb?

09:57.480 --> 09:58.480
Elphaba?

09:58.480 --> 09:59.480
Get it?

09:59.480 --> 10:03.480
Wicked utilizes many book-only concepts, such as the geography of the countries, the shoes

10:03.480 --> 10:05.480
being silver, etc.

10:05.480 --> 10:08.480
Maguire also introduces many of his own ideas.

10:08.480 --> 10:13.480
For instance, not only that talking animals exist, but exist as a different type of person

10:13.480 --> 10:18.480
altogether, and that even Oz operates on something of an apartheid system pushed by

10:18.480 --> 10:19.480
the wizard himself.

10:19.480 --> 10:23.480
This being Elphaba's main motivation for turning on the system, as she does, becoming

10:23.480 --> 10:25.480
Wicked.

10:25.480 --> 10:31.480
Buuuuut there are some major elements that are very rooted in the 1939 film.

10:31.480 --> 10:35.480
Elphaba's greenness not only isolates her within the world of the novel, it's also a

10:35.480 --> 10:36.480
major plot point.

10:36.480 --> 10:43.480
See, the Wizard of Oz used this green elixir to basically drug and seduce Elphaba's mother.

10:43.480 --> 10:45.480
Seduce.

10:45.480 --> 10:46.480
Not the right word.

10:46.480 --> 10:51.480
She's also got the pointy hat, and she got the broom, which she uses for murder at one

10:51.480 --> 10:52.480
point.

10:52.480 --> 10:56.480
So, one can argue that the most important influences from the 1939 movie on Maguire's

10:56.480 --> 11:00.480
book are purely aesthetic, and therefore can't really be subject to copyright law, which

11:00.480 --> 11:02.480
is probably true.

11:02.480 --> 11:07.480
But since the book got adapted into a very popular and still-running musical on Broadway,

11:07.480 --> 11:09.480
well, they somehow got away with it.

11:20.480 --> 11:24.480
Wicked is kind of musical than musical.

11:24.480 --> 11:26.480
Like, your mom loves it.

11:26.480 --> 11:31.480
It's less political than the book, more about romance and Elphaba's desire to be accepted

11:31.480 --> 11:34.480
and then revolution happens, but still romance.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.480
And the Wizard's less awful.

11:36.480 --> 11:39.480
And in a way, it's the perfect Broadway musical.

11:39.480 --> 11:43.480
It's based on a familiar thing, but it's still a new story, so you're not just watching

11:43.480 --> 11:46.480
a stage version of a movie you've already seen.

11:46.480 --> 11:49.480
Ahem, hem, hem, hem, hem, hem.

11:49.480 --> 11:54.480
Elphaba in the show is a sort of proto-Elsa from Frozen in many ways, not the least of

11:54.480 --> 12:00.480
which being originally portrayed by Idina Menzel, whose signature song is proto-Let

12:00.480 --> 12:01.480
It Go.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.480
The major difference is the way the romance is handled.

12:13.480 --> 12:17.480
She goes into a years-long stupor in the book, during which she gives birth and forgets about

12:17.480 --> 12:18.480
it.

12:18.480 --> 12:19.480
Apparently.

12:19.480 --> 12:23.480
Love interest may or may not have died horribly, but is probably dead, but it's not really

12:23.480 --> 12:24.480
clear by the end.

12:24.480 --> 12:26.480
Musical, she fakes her death and runs off with the bay.

12:26.480 --> 12:27.480
The end.

12:27.480 --> 12:33.480
Also, the Wizard is not as evil, nor is he explicitly a date rapist, so there is that.

12:38.480 --> 12:42.480
There is debate as to the merits of the book versus the musical, and I think Gregory Maguire

12:42.480 --> 12:46.480
had really interesting ideas in worldbuilding, but I don't much care for how detached he

12:46.480 --> 12:47.480
is in his writing.

12:47.480 --> 12:50.480
I like the book more in theory, I prefer the musical in practice.

12:58.480 --> 12:59.480
Next.

13:13.480 --> 13:15.480
Oh, man.

13:15.480 --> 13:17.480
Why is this called Tin Man?

13:21.480 --> 13:25.480
Well, originally, he was going to be the main character, but then it turned into more of

13:25.480 --> 13:31.480
just a Wizard of Oz retelling, and so now Dorothy- D.G., her name is D.G., she comes

13:31.480 --> 13:32.480
to the O.Z.

13:32.480 --> 13:34.480
It's called the O.Z., means Outer Zone.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.480
Well, anyway, so the Tin Man was originally going to be the main character, and it was

13:37.480 --> 13:41.480
going to be like a witch murder mystery, but then they decided it should be more of an

13:41.480 --> 13:46.480
analogue to the original book, and D.G. is the main character, but they kept the title

13:46.480 --> 13:47.480
anyway.

13:47.480 --> 13:48.480
I don't know.

13:48.480 --> 13:50.480
My name's D.G., what's yours?

13:51.480 --> 13:55.480
Boy, howdy, is it becoming a race to the bottom for who is the worst Dorothy.

13:55.480 --> 13:58.480
You guys are out of your tiny minds!

13:58.480 --> 14:00.480
Concentrate, concentrate, concentrate, we're talking about the witch.

14:00.480 --> 14:04.480
This also purports to be inspired by the public domain book, but of course there are many

14:04.480 --> 14:07.480
elements lifted from the 39 movie here, too.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.480
D.G., where are you?

14:09.480 --> 14:10.480
Dorothy!

14:10.480 --> 14:12.480
Where are you?

14:12.480 --> 14:16.480
Regarding the witch, the elements typically lifted from the movie aren't present, though.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.480
No broom, no green skin.

14:18.480 --> 14:24.480
The Wicked Witch in this version is actually Dor- D.G.'s sister, and her name is Azkadilia,

14:24.480 --> 14:28.480
which I'm pretty sure is the name of one of my fanfic self-insert characters from the

14:28.480 --> 14:30.480
sixth grade.

14:31.480 --> 14:33.480
Azkadilia's my sister.

14:33.480 --> 14:38.480
Here she's more of an innocence lost character, and also, like, possessed.

14:38.480 --> 14:40.480
Let go.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.480
No.

14:41.480 --> 14:45.480
D.G. accidentally got Azkadilia possessed by another witch as a child, and they had

14:45.480 --> 14:51.480
like, this special hand-holding magic, but D.G. f***ed it up, and Azkadilia got possessed,

14:51.480 --> 14:54.480
and then D.G. got raised by robot parents.

14:54.480 --> 14:58.480
We are Series 1487.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.480
Nurture units.

15:00.480 --> 15:06.480
So, Tin Man straddles this weird line between retelling and completely off in its own little world.

15:06.480 --> 15:12.480
Glinda Analogue is here, but she's the mom, because these reboots do so love them some familial things.

15:12.480 --> 15:17.480
The witch does not get melted at the end, but instead gets de-possessed by hand-holding magic.

15:17.480 --> 15:20.480
So rather than melting the witch, sisterly love conquers all.

15:20.480 --> 15:22.480
Another proto-frozen.

15:22.480 --> 15:23.480
So that's nice.

15:23.480 --> 15:25.480
The witch is gone.

15:27.480 --> 15:28.480
It's over.

15:28.480 --> 15:31.480
In a lot of ways, Tin Man is the most interesting out of all of these,

15:31.480 --> 15:36.480
but I get the impression that it was written by people with, you know, imagination and creativity,

15:36.480 --> 15:39.480
and then the studio was like, no, people are stupid.

15:39.480 --> 15:40.480
Make it dumber.

15:40.480 --> 15:43.480
Come on, Tin Man, have a heart.

15:43.480 --> 15:49.480
So, as cool as a lot of the details and ideas in Tin Man are, the watch itself is a bit of a slog.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.480
She tried to kill me.

15:51.480 --> 15:52.480
No.

15:53.480 --> 15:54.480
She did kill you.

15:55.480 --> 15:56.480
Next.

15:56.480 --> 15:59.480
This TV special is mine!

15:59.480 --> 16:02.480
Kong sah, so you can leave!

16:02.480 --> 16:04.480
The sofa, shoes, and the door!

16:05.480 --> 16:07.480
So this is the worst puppet movie.

16:07.480 --> 16:08.480
Bonjour!

16:08.480 --> 16:11.480
Witch of the West coming at you from my lair of evil!

16:11.480 --> 16:14.480
And again, it's a race to the bottom for worst Dorothy ever.

16:14.480 --> 16:16.480
Ashanti and Zooey Deschanel are neck and neck.

16:16.480 --> 16:17.480
Sorry, I know, keep focus.

16:17.480 --> 16:20.480
I mean, just people who shit on Diana Ross.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.480
Look at the competition.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.480
Come on.

16:23.480 --> 16:25.480
Check it out, your little show's about to be canceled.

16:25.480 --> 16:28.480
Since Miss Piggy is really the only female Muppet of note,

16:28.480 --> 16:31.480
like, come on, Janice Stans, we know she doesn't really matter,

16:31.480 --> 16:36.480
Muppet Oz takes the interesting, and honestly I'm kind of surprised no one's ever done this before,

16:36.480 --> 16:39.480
the approach of having all of the witches played by the same actress.

16:39.480 --> 16:41.480
Well, you know, actress.

16:41.480 --> 16:48.480
Two of which are involved in the most horrifying scenes ever with a Muppet.

16:48.480 --> 16:49.480
This.

16:49.480 --> 16:52.480
Wow, this is a lot heavier than I could get.

16:54.480 --> 16:59.480
And then the melting scene, which is probably a low for Miss Piggy.

16:59.480 --> 17:01.480
It's definitely a low for Miss Piggy.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.480
And that's saying something.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.480
I'm not melting, I'm getting skinny!

17:06.480 --> 17:07.480
I'm getting skinny!

17:09.480 --> 17:10.480
I win, I win!

17:11.480 --> 17:12.480
What?

17:17.480 --> 17:18.480
And cut.

17:23.480 --> 17:26.480
It turns into this, like, Ark of the Covenant kind of horror show.

17:26.480 --> 17:29.480
I think it's supposed to be funny, but nobody wants to see this.

17:29.480 --> 17:31.480
No one wants to see this.

17:33.480 --> 17:34.480
Muppets.

17:34.480 --> 17:40.480
So, this was right after the Muppets were bought by Disney, and way before the recent curmasaunts.

17:40.480 --> 17:45.480
By the time you get to the witch, you're longing for death so badly you don't even care how awful she is.

17:45.480 --> 17:49.480
Which is good, because halfway through the end battle, this happens.

17:51.480 --> 17:55.480
And then, just as Dorothy and the Wicked Witch charge at each other,

17:55.480 --> 17:58.480
Bam! Blowout fight scene.

17:58.480 --> 18:02.480
The gals whip out these huge samurai swords,

18:02.480 --> 18:05.480
and they just tear it up.

18:06.480 --> 18:08.480
I'm talking kung-fu.

18:08.480 --> 18:10.480
It can't get worse than this, can it?

18:26.480 --> 18:30.480
So, I was going to say that the worst thing about you guys choosing, you, you did this,

18:30.480 --> 18:33.480
you choosing the Wicked Witch of the West for this video,

18:33.480 --> 18:36.480
was the fact that I had to watch this f***ing movie again.

18:36.480 --> 18:41.480
But then, I had to watch the Muppet version, so that did put it in perspective.

18:42.480 --> 18:44.480
Because there's a lot I can live with.

18:44.480 --> 18:48.480
I can live with the fact that Franco looks high all the time,

18:48.480 --> 18:52.480
and the bottomlessness to how much he does not care about his performance.

18:52.480 --> 18:56.480
I can live with the tired-ass shitty, like, faker is deemed to be the chosen one

18:56.480 --> 19:00.480
the second he lands in this wonderful world and he lies to everyone narrative.

19:00.480 --> 19:02.480
God, I hate that plot.

19:02.480 --> 19:07.480
I can even live with the fact that the studio took a universe that almost always had female protagonists,

19:07.480 --> 19:11.480
or males that turned into females, and gave it a male one.

19:11.480 --> 19:15.480
But I cannot take the reason why the Wicked Witch is wicked.

19:18.480 --> 19:21.480
I want him to see me like this.

19:21.480 --> 19:25.480
I want him to know that he was the one who made me this way.

19:27.480 --> 19:32.480
It's just so lame.

19:32.480 --> 19:35.480
It's like a layer cake of lame.

19:35.480 --> 19:38.480
You peel back one layer and it's like, ugh, really?

19:38.480 --> 19:43.480
Like, I don't know what's worse, that it's ultimately like she's a woman scorned by James Franco, of all people.

19:45.480 --> 19:47.480
And that's why she's wicked.

19:47.480 --> 19:52.480
Or the fact that it's actually, like, a poison given to her by her sister,

19:52.480 --> 19:54.480
and she has no agency in her own wickedness.

19:54.480 --> 19:57.480
See, it's not her fault that she's wicked, but it kind of is.

19:57.480 --> 20:01.480
But it isn't, because poison, but it is, I don't know, it's stupid.

20:01.480 --> 20:08.480
It really is the anti-wicked, where in Wicked she was like this anarchic activist fighting for the rights of the oppressed.

20:08.480 --> 20:10.480
Here she is, a woman scorned.

20:10.480 --> 20:13.480
Who isn't really, because hey, it isn't her fault she caught the evil.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.480
Her sister gave it to her.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.480
Curse you!

20:17.480 --> 20:20.480
And it's also the worst performance.

20:20.480 --> 20:23.480
They will run and flee for their health!

20:23.480 --> 20:25.480
We shall not let them flee!

20:25.480 --> 20:28.480
We shall show them no mercy!

20:31.480 --> 20:33.480
You are welcome to return.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.480
Never!

20:38.480 --> 20:42.480
Disney having to be mindful of copyright ramifications once again plays a major element here,

20:42.480 --> 20:47.480
the most prominent of which, which, which, was the look of the witch herself.

20:47.480 --> 20:53.480
Namely, the shade of green that could not be infringed upon, or Margaret Hamilton's iconic black dress.

20:53.480 --> 21:00.480
So if you're wondering about all that décolletage, that's sort of why. Sort of.

21:00.480 --> 21:04.480
There are elements to this movie that aren't the worst thing ever.

21:04.480 --> 21:10.480
In fact, this movie might have just been passively boring had it not done the thing,

21:10.480 --> 21:16.480
but pretty much every decision surrounding The Wicked Witch of the West is the worst decision they could have made.

21:18.480 --> 21:25.480
So if anything is going to make you appreciate Wicked, it is Oz the Great and Powerful.

21:25.480 --> 21:27.480
Next.

21:27.480 --> 21:33.480
The queen may be evil, but I'm wicked.

21:33.480 --> 21:36.480
Wicked always wins.

21:38.480 --> 21:43.480
Woof. Okay, okay. It's not as bad as the last two.

21:43.480 --> 21:46.480
Perspective, perspective everybody, we're almost done.

21:46.480 --> 21:49.480
Once again, a lot based on the 39 movie.

21:49.480 --> 21:52.480
You see the copyright sidestepping with the off-brand Margaret Hamilton.

21:52.480 --> 21:57.480
She's got this weird-ass shade of green that makes her look like she's sweating all the time,

21:57.480 --> 22:00.480
but her dress is pretty awesome, so there's that.

22:00.480 --> 22:05.480
I have to take it in a little bit at the hips, but it looks better on me, don't you think?

22:05.480 --> 22:07.480
This show...

22:08.480 --> 22:10.480
This show...

22:10.480 --> 22:11.480
Huh.

22:11.480 --> 22:17.480
Okay, so if you've never seen this show, it's like Disney's great big domestic AU fanfic.

22:17.480 --> 22:19.480
Some of the time.

22:19.480 --> 22:21.480
Something something spell something something.

22:21.480 --> 22:26.480
Now we're in the normal world, but sometimes we're not because sometimes there's a curse.

22:26.480 --> 22:28.480
This tends to change with the villain.

22:28.480 --> 22:32.480
It was the evil queen of Snow White who was the spellcaster for a while,

22:32.480 --> 22:37.480
but in this particular arc it's the Wicked Witch of the West, but then it turns out it's not.

22:37.480 --> 22:44.480
Anyway, she is Snow White's evil queen's half-sister because she's always someone's sister or daughter or something.

22:44.480 --> 22:46.480
I'm your sister.

22:48.480 --> 22:54.480
But Wizard of Oz isn't really a known Disney thing, so why the Wicked Witch?

22:54.480 --> 22:59.480
It's not till we get to her tragic backstory episode that we actually get to see Oz

22:59.480 --> 23:04.480
and the Oz logo and the wizard himself and it's like...

23:07.480 --> 23:08.480
Oh.

23:08.480 --> 23:13.480
I see all. I am Oz the Great and Terrible.

23:13.480 --> 23:16.480
Oz the Great and Vertically Integrated.

23:16.480 --> 23:20.480
I'm just a circus huxer. I'm a showman.

23:20.480 --> 23:23.480
Oh my god, they are just laying it all out there.

23:23.480 --> 23:25.480
I'm just a con man.

23:26.480 --> 23:28.480
I'm a carnival magician.

23:28.480 --> 23:35.480
So Wicked Elphaba is green because of a date rape drug, great and powerful because heart killing drug.

23:35.480 --> 23:38.480
So why are you green once upon a time, Wicked Witch?

23:38.480 --> 23:41.480
She's not nearly as powerful as me. She doesn't deserve to have you as a danger.

23:41.480 --> 23:45.480
Careful, Selina. You're turning green, dearie.

23:47.480 --> 23:49.480
Envy will do that to you.

23:50.480 --> 23:55.480
Yep, she literally turns green with envy.

23:55.480 --> 23:57.480
We'll see about that.

23:57.480 --> 24:01.480
She's also motivated by the desire to destroy her half-sister, the Evil Queen.

24:01.480 --> 24:03.480
What the hell did I ever do to you?

24:03.480 --> 24:04.480
Yeah.

24:04.480 --> 24:06.480
You were born.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.480
Well, okay then.

24:09.480 --> 24:14.480
It's all rather convoluted. She does get doused by Dorothy, but this doesn't kill her.

24:14.480 --> 24:17.480
Rumpelstiltskin does, because he's a major character.

24:17.480 --> 24:19.480
And he's also the Beast.

24:20.480 --> 24:21.480
Just...

24:21.480 --> 24:25.480
Rumpelstiltskin never breaks.

24:27.480 --> 24:30.480
And she doesn't melt, she shatters.

24:31.480 --> 24:36.480
So given when this aired, the year after Oz the Great and Powerful was released,

24:36.480 --> 24:40.480
we might be able to read this as something of a brand integration.

24:40.480 --> 24:43.480
Subtle, but distinctive on its own.

24:43.480 --> 24:46.480
But given there's been no real news on the sequel in two years,

24:46.480 --> 24:48.480
they may have just been hedging their brand bets,

24:48.480 --> 24:52.480
and keep on borrowing from the legacy of that 39 movie while we're there.

24:52.480 --> 24:55.480
Disney just wants the rights to that movie so bad.

24:55.480 --> 24:59.480
Something beautifully ironic for Disney wanting to slip in there

24:59.480 --> 25:03.480
and wibble their way around all that copyright that MGM still holds for The Wizard of Oz,

25:03.480 --> 25:09.480
and yet what company is most responsible for the extension of the length of copyright?

25:09.480 --> 25:11.480
Hmm...

25:11.480 --> 25:14.480
Who could it be?

25:18.480 --> 25:21.480
To examine different incarnations of the Wicked Witch of the West

25:21.480 --> 25:24.480
To examine different incarnations of the Wicked Witch of the West

25:24.480 --> 25:27.480
is to examine our relationship to the iconography of the witch.

25:27.480 --> 25:29.480
But as audiences grow and change,

25:29.480 --> 25:33.480
we're just not interested in the idea of inherent evil witch anymore.

25:33.480 --> 25:38.480
The idea that a powerful solitary woman is no longer as strange and perverse as it used to be.

25:38.480 --> 25:40.480
Now it's even sympathetic.

25:40.480 --> 25:42.480
Sometimes.

25:44.480 --> 25:49.480
I think maybe Disney should keep its mitts off of Oz for a little while.

25:50.480 --> 25:53.480
There's this episode of Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood that featured Margaret Hamilton,

25:53.480 --> 25:56.480
and she talks a bit about actually playing the witch,

25:56.480 --> 25:58.480
and how children shouldn't be scared of her.

25:58.480 --> 26:01.480
You know, she was just acting. It's like playing make-believe.

26:01.480 --> 26:03.480
And it is the cutest thing.

26:03.480 --> 26:05.480
But there is one bit that sticks out to me.

26:05.480 --> 26:11.480
And I just think that sometimes we think she's just mean and a very bad person,

26:11.480 --> 26:15.480
but actually you have to think about her point of view.

26:15.480 --> 26:21.480
It wasn't as happy a time as she wanted it to be, because she just never got what she wanted.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.480
See? Maggie gets it.

26:23.480 --> 26:26.480
Even the Wickedest of Witches has their own motivation.

26:26.480 --> 26:28.480
True, I can't attend you here and now as I'd like.

26:28.480 --> 26:32.480
But just try to stay out of my way. Just try.

26:32.480 --> 26:36.480
So the last three Loose Cannon episodes have been about villains, or at least, you know, villain-ish.

26:36.480 --> 26:41.480
So the next theme will be some flavor of real American-ish hero.

26:41.480 --> 26:44.480
Here are your three choices. You can vote in the link below.

26:44.480 --> 26:47.480
If you like this series, please consider supporting it on Patreon.

26:47.480 --> 26:52.480
These episodes take a really long time to produce, and I'd like to do it more often.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.480
That link is also below this video.

26:54.480 --> 26:58.480
And I will announce the winner for this thing on Twitter.

26:58.480 --> 27:00.480
Follow me here.

27:00.480 --> 27:04.480
And hopefully I will do it sooner than two months from now.

27:04.480 --> 27:06.480
And thank you for watching.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.480
Thanks for watching!
