0	2480	Witches, am I right?
2480	9640	If you're a woman in Hollywood over the age of 35, you've probably played one.
9640	13540	In fact, you're probably in the process of playing a witch right now.
13540	17920	This can speak to many facets regarding the way we view women in Hollywood, but I don't
17920	21120	think all of them necessarily bad.
21120	22120	Go.
22120	24040	Go away.
24040	25840	No longer is the witch a one-note archetype.
26280	32120	No, sir, now she is a complex figure with motivations and a backstory.
32120	34120	Some of the time.
34120	40620	With that in mind, who better to talk about than the Wicked Witch of the West, arguably
40620	45900	the most famous witch of the 20th century, and the template for a good 30% of all Halloween
45900	46900	costumes.
46900	50800	So, what even is a witch?
50800	55100	Witch is a pretty broad term, it can apply to pretty much any magical woman, although
55100	57560	the connotation does tend to be pejorative.
57560	61920	One of the earliest examples was the Seer of Endor, which was later translated as the
61920	66740	Witch of Endor, whom King Saul of Israel goes to learn the future because God won't talk
66740	67740	to him.
67740	71960	Witches are often a source of dangerous wisdom we see similar to the Witch of Endor thousands
71960	74440	of years later with Macbeth's weird sisters.
74440	78920	Again, they're not really evil per se, but they're still mysterious and scary and you
78920	80600	don't want to go there, Macbeth.
80600	84840	During the Middle Ages, as Europe got more and more, well, shitty, the idea of the witch
84860	89780	became more and more associated with the Christian devil, the archetype of the old hag becomes
89780	95020	more prominent, witches became associated with brooms.
95020	96460	Where did the broom thing come from?
96460	101300	Well, it's hard to pinpoint exactly, but the root of any folk villain tends to deal with
101300	106340	some cultural anxiety, and the witch archetype is European anxiety about women straying from
106340	111740	the very, very narrow box set out for them, so witch iconography utilizes signifiers of
111740	113700	the domestic, but wrong.
114560	118800	You're supposed to use that broom to clean the floor, not fly around.
118800	121840	So when we look at the Wicked Witch of the West, what we see is a distillation of all
121840	127000	of these many hundreds of years of iconography into the ultimate modern archetype for the
127000	128000	witch.
128000	129000	She's got it all!
129000	130640	Except for the cat.
130640	133880	She's got flying monkeys instead.
133880	137480	Originally a children's book villain, the last hundred years have seen the Wicked Witch
137480	143200	of the West be expanded upon in many ways, but being honest we are pretty much going
143200	148900	to use the 1939 film as our bedrock for this discussion, as much as, if not more so than
148900	149900	the original book.
149900	155580	Which is an important distinction to make for one reason, the 1939 film is still under
155580	160980	copyright where L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is not.
160980	166020	So as always, as there are roughly one shit billion different versions of the Wizard of
166020	169920	Oz, this does not include every single version of the Wicked Witch of the West.
169940	173780	So, with that in mind, the Wicked Witch of the West.
189100	193660	There are entire books dedicated to political interpretations of Baum's fiction.
193660	197900	Not that he was necessarily doing it deliberately, the intentionality of anything he put in his
197900	203360	books is completely up for debate, but reading politics into the world of Oz is super popular
203360	205320	and super common.
205320	210080	The ruby slippers in the 39 version, in the book they were silver slippers and they represent
210080	214960	like the gold standard and the silverite 16, well actually no, the yellow brick road is
214960	217640	the like dissolution of the gold standard or something, I don't know.
217640	221960	And this is not by Baum's admission, this is just popular conjecture.
221960	226880	That said, the world of Oz is one in which almost all of the power players, good and
226880	228240	bad, are women.
228240	231700	So when you look at all that and Baum's political leanings, it's no coincidence that these books
231700	234060	came out during the height of the suffrage movement.
234060	239020	In the grand scheme of Baum's universe, the Wicked Witch of the West is not a huge player.
239020	243340	She's only in that first novel, and even then, not in Towards the End when the Wizard gives
243340	245740	Dorothy and her pals a murder quest.
245740	249060	And the book's version of the Witch is nothing like what we've come to associate with the
249060	251560	words Wicked Witch of the West.
251560	256140	She doesn't have green skin, she doesn't have a broom, she's short and frumpy, the Wizard
256140	261400	doesn't ask them to grab anything from her, Dorothy does wet her out of spite rather than
261400	266140	trying to save the Scarecrow, but is likewise surprised that water melts her.
266140	271560	So rather than chief antagonist villain ultra of the universe, this Witch is more just an
271560	273880	obstacle that needs to be overcome in the first book.
273880	278360	But at the end of the day, not a huge power player in the grand scheme of Oz.
278360	280520	So what would change that perception?
286140	298480	Where the book is episodic, structured more like The Hobbit, I mean the book, not the
298480	304580	nine hour epic, the 1939 film takes on a much more traditional Hollywood structure, setting
304580	309040	up the Wicked Witch as the chief antagonist even before Dorothy gets to Oz.
309040	314800	We first see her, arguably, or her equivalent, as a miserly old spinster named Miss Gulch,
314820	317700	It was after Dorothy's dog, Toto, because Toto bit her.
317700	318700	My leg!
318700	319700	Me, she bit you?
319700	320700	No, her dog.
320700	324860	Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
324860	328740	Gail Sondergaard was originally cast as the Wicked Witch when the film was more overtly
328740	331860	influenced by Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
331860	338700	The Wicked Witch wasn't going to be a post-Apple Disney witch, but a sexy, intimidating, pre-Apple
338700	339700	kind of witch.
339700	342780	I've never heard of a beautiful witch before.
342780	344180	Only bad witches are ugly.
344560	347080	Well, there you go, Dorothy, words to live by.
347080	351520	When they decided to lose this felt-sexy witch and do the more conventional ugly hag-witch
351520	354680	instead, Gail Sondergaard did not like that, and she bailed.
354680	356160	And in comes Margaret Hamilton.
356160	360200	These things must be done delicately.
360200	364560	Margaret Hamilton gunned real hard for this part, and she loved being the witch, despite
364560	368180	the fact that in the process she got burned really bad.
368180	369480	Like literally, with fire.
369480	375140	On this little elevator that went down slowly or went down fast, in this case, it dropped
375140	378940	out from under me, and we ran to the first aid station.
378940	382380	I had a second degree on my face and a third on my hand.
382380	382880	Ah!
382880	384780	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
384780	385280	Ah!
385280	385780	Ah!
385780	386280	Ah!
386280	386780	Ah!
386780	387280	Ah!
387280	387780	Ah!
387780	388280	Ah!
388280	388780	Ah!
388780	389280	Ah!
389280	389780	Ah!
389780	390280	Ah!
390280	390780	Ah!
390780	391280	Ah!
391280	391780	Ah!
391780	392280	Ah!
392280	392780	Ah!
392780	393280	Ah!
393280	393780	Ah!
393780	394280	Ah!
394280	394780	Ah!
394780	395280	Ah!
395280	395780	Ah!
395780	396280	Ah!
396280	396780	Ah!
396780	397280	Ah!
397280	397780	Ah!
397780	398280	Ah!
398280	398780	Ah!
398780	399280	Ah!
399780	401580	And they're mangy little dogs, too.
402080	406380	Like, it's just timeless, and when you consider what a shitshow this was behind the scenes,
406380	410580	the sheer number of directors that came and went during production, this movie is kind
410580	411580	of a miracle.
411580	415080	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
415080	419480	And 75 years on, Margaret Hamilton's Wicked Witch of the West is still one of the most
419480	422780	iconic movie villains in film history.
422780	423980	Ah!
423980	425280	You cursed brat!
425280	426780	Look what you've done!
426780	427980	Next!
428480	431480	Oh, please, oh, beautiful one!
431480	434980	We haven't had a lunch hour in six months!
434980	440480	Well, suffering is free for the soul.
440480	442980	Now suffer!
442980	443980	Oof.
445980	450480	So, 40 years pass before we get another big-budget studio Wizard of Oz movie.
450480	456280	The agonizingly long The Wiz, adapted from and almost completely omitting the stage musical
456280	462280	of the same name, directed by Academy Award-winning director of 12 Angry Men, Sidney Lumet, and
462280	465480	written by Joel Schumacher.
465480	471480	What an obvious team to create this funky fresh reimagining of The Wizard of Oz.
471480	474480	The witch isn't even mentioned till it's time to go kill her.
474480	480480	Her name is Evelyn, and she appears to be the, uh, slave lord of a sweatshop, which
480480	482180	is kind of weird.
482180	485480	She also has a whip, which is, uh, also weird.
485480	486480	Ahh!
492480	496480	She marches around in what looks to be the most uncomfortable dressed imaginable, and
496480	501480	has eyeballs on her crown, which might be a reference to this all-seeing telescope eye
501480	503480	thing that she has in the book.
503480	508480	Like Wicked Witch Prime, this witch is barely in it, but, unlike the Margaret Hamilton version,
508480	510480	she actually gets a song.
510480	522480	Before she gets melted in perhaps the most non-melting-melting scene out of all of them.
525480	528480	The witch portions are among the better paced in the film.
528480	532480	And if we ignore the uncomfortable slave stuff, I even kind of dig her song.
532480	543480	Even so, I'm not so sure about this witch.
543480	544480	What.
544480	545480	Is.
545480	546480	Hell?
549480	550480	Okay.
550480	551480	Next.
554480	558480	Skipping forward almost another twenty years, it is time for a re-examination of the classic
558480	564480	witch archetype, and one of the most influential books ever on that topic, Gregory Maguire's
564480	567480	Wicked colon The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West.
567480	572480	Most of Maguire's well-known books deal with popular stories and characters that just happen
572480	576480	to be in the public domain, and Wicked is no exception.
576480	580480	The Wonderful Wizard of Oz itself and its characters and concepts entered the public
580480	582480	domain in 1956.
582480	586480	MGM's 1939 film, however, has not.
586480	591480	Maguire's book borrows from both, but being a book, it can get away with a lot more than
591480	592480	a movie can.
592480	595480	Here, the witch's name is Elphaba.
595480	596480	Get it?
596480	597480	Like, El Frank Bomb?
597480	598480	Elphaba?
598480	599480	Get it?
599480	603480	Wicked utilizes many book-only concepts, such as the geography of the countries, the shoes
603480	605480	being silver, etc.
605480	608480	Maguire also introduces many of his own ideas.
608480	613480	For instance, not only that talking animals exist, but exist as a different type of person
613480	618480	altogether, and that even Oz operates on something of an apartheid system pushed by
618480	619480	the wizard himself.
619480	623480	This being Elphaba's main motivation for turning on the system, as she does, becoming
623480	625480	Wicked.
625480	631480	Buuuuut there are some major elements that are very rooted in the 1939 film.
631480	635480	Elphaba's greenness not only isolates her within the world of the novel, it's also a
635480	636480	major plot point.
636480	643480	See, the Wizard of Oz used this green elixir to basically drug and seduce Elphaba's mother.
643480	645480	Seduce.
645480	646480	Not the right word.
646480	651480	She's also got the pointy hat, and she got the broom, which she uses for murder at one
651480	652480	point.
652480	656480	So, one can argue that the most important influences from the 1939 movie on Maguire's
656480	660480	book are purely aesthetic, and therefore can't really be subject to copyright law, which
660480	662480	is probably true.
662480	667480	But since the book got adapted into a very popular and still-running musical on Broadway,
667480	669480	well, they somehow got away with it.
680480	684480	Wicked is kind of musical than musical.
684480	686480	Like, your mom loves it.
686480	691480	It's less political than the book, more about romance and Elphaba's desire to be accepted
691480	694480	and then revolution happens, but still romance.
694480	696480	And the Wizard's less awful.
696480	699480	And in a way, it's the perfect Broadway musical.
699480	703480	It's based on a familiar thing, but it's still a new story, so you're not just watching
703480	706480	a stage version of a movie you've already seen.
706480	709480	Ahem, hem, hem, hem, hem, hem.
709480	714480	Elphaba in the show is a sort of proto-Elsa from Frozen in many ways, not the least of
714480	720480	which being originally portrayed by Idina Menzel, whose signature song is proto-Let
720480	721480	It Go.
730480	733480	The major difference is the way the romance is handled.
733480	737480	She goes into a years-long stupor in the book, during which she gives birth and forgets about
737480	738480	it.
738480	739480	Apparently.
739480	743480	Love interest may or may not have died horribly, but is probably dead, but it's not really
743480	744480	clear by the end.
744480	746480	Musical, she fakes her death and runs off with the bay.
746480	747480	The end.
747480	753480	Also, the Wizard is not as evil, nor is he explicitly a date rapist, so there is that.
758480	762480	There is debate as to the merits of the book versus the musical, and I think Gregory Maguire
762480	766480	had really interesting ideas in worldbuilding, but I don't much care for how detached he
766480	767480	is in his writing.
767480	770480	I like the book more in theory, I prefer the musical in practice.
778480	779480	Next.
793480	795480	Oh, man.
795480	797480	Why is this called Tin Man?
801480	805480	Well, originally, he was going to be the main character, but then it turned into more of
805480	811480	just a Wizard of Oz retelling, and so now Dorothy- D.G., her name is D.G., she comes
811480	812480	to the O.Z.
812480	814480	It's called the O.Z., means Outer Zone.
814480	817480	Well, anyway, so the Tin Man was originally going to be the main character, and it was
817480	821480	going to be like a witch murder mystery, but then they decided it should be more of an
821480	826480	analogue to the original book, and D.G. is the main character, but they kept the title
826480	827480	anyway.
827480	828480	I don't know.
828480	830480	My name's D.G., what's yours?
831480	835480	Boy, howdy, is it becoming a race to the bottom for who is the worst Dorothy.
835480	838480	You guys are out of your tiny minds!
838480	840480	Concentrate, concentrate, concentrate, we're talking about the witch.
840480	844480	This also purports to be inspired by the public domain book, but of course there are many
844480	847480	elements lifted from the 39 movie here, too.
847480	849480	D.G., where are you?
849480	850480	Dorothy!
850480	852480	Where are you?
852480	856480	Regarding the witch, the elements typically lifted from the movie aren't present, though.
856480	858480	No broom, no green skin.
858480	864480	The Wicked Witch in this version is actually Dor- D.G.'s sister, and her name is Azkadilia,
864480	868480	which I'm pretty sure is the name of one of my fanfic self-insert characters from the
868480	870480	sixth grade.
871480	873480	Azkadilia's my sister.
873480	878480	Here she's more of an innocence lost character, and also, like, possessed.
878480	880480	Let go.
880480	881480	No.
881480	885480	D.G. accidentally got Azkadilia possessed by another witch as a child, and they had
885480	891480	like, this special hand-holding magic, but D.G. f***ed it up, and Azkadilia got possessed,
891480	894480	and then D.G. got raised by robot parents.
894480	898480	We are Series 1487.
898480	900480	Nurture units.
900480	906480	So, Tin Man straddles this weird line between retelling and completely off in its own little world.
906480	912480	Glinda Analogue is here, but she's the mom, because these reboots do so love them some familial things.
912480	917480	The witch does not get melted at the end, but instead gets de-possessed by hand-holding magic.
917480	920480	So rather than melting the witch, sisterly love conquers all.
920480	922480	Another proto-frozen.
922480	923480	So that's nice.
923480	925480	The witch is gone.
927480	928480	It's over.
928480	931480	In a lot of ways, Tin Man is the most interesting out of all of these,
931480	936480	but I get the impression that it was written by people with, you know, imagination and creativity,
936480	939480	and then the studio was like, no, people are stupid.
939480	940480	Make it dumber.
940480	943480	Come on, Tin Man, have a heart.
943480	949480	So, as cool as a lot of the details and ideas in Tin Man are, the watch itself is a bit of a slog.
949480	951480	She tried to kill me.
951480	952480	No.
953480	954480	She did kill you.
955480	956480	Next.
956480	959480	This TV special is mine!
959480	962480	Kong sah, so you can leave!
962480	964480	The sofa, shoes, and the door!
965480	967480	So this is the worst puppet movie.
967480	968480	Bonjour!
968480	971480	Witch of the West coming at you from my lair of evil!
971480	974480	And again, it's a race to the bottom for worst Dorothy ever.
974480	976480	Ashanti and Zooey Deschanel are neck and neck.
976480	977480	Sorry, I know, keep focus.
977480	980480	I mean, just people who shit on Diana Ross.
980480	981480	Look at the competition.
981480	982480	Come on.
983480	985480	Check it out, your little show's about to be canceled.
985480	988480	Since Miss Piggy is really the only female Muppet of note,
988480	991480	like, come on, Janice Stans, we know she doesn't really matter,
991480	996480	Muppet Oz takes the interesting, and honestly I'm kind of surprised no one's ever done this before,
996480	999480	the approach of having all of the witches played by the same actress.
999480	1001480	Well, you know, actress.
1001480	1008480	Two of which are involved in the most horrifying scenes ever with a Muppet.
1008480	1009480	This.
1009480	1012480	Wow, this is a lot heavier than I could get.
1014480	1019480	And then the melting scene, which is probably a low for Miss Piggy.
1019480	1021480	It's definitely a low for Miss Piggy.
1021480	1023480	And that's saying something.
1023480	1025480	I'm not melting, I'm getting skinny!
1026480	1027480	I'm getting skinny!
1029480	1030480	I win, I win!
1031480	1032480	What?
1037480	1038480	And cut.
1043480	1046480	It turns into this, like, Ark of the Covenant kind of horror show.
1046480	1049480	I think it's supposed to be funny, but nobody wants to see this.
1049480	1051480	No one wants to see this.
1053480	1054480	Muppets.
1054480	1060480	So, this was right after the Muppets were bought by Disney, and way before the recent curmasaunts.
1060480	1065480	By the time you get to the witch, you're longing for death so badly you don't even care how awful she is.
1065480	1069480	Which is good, because halfway through the end battle, this happens.
1071480	1075480	And then, just as Dorothy and the Wicked Witch charge at each other,
1075480	1078480	Bam! Blowout fight scene.
1078480	1082480	The gals whip out these huge samurai swords,
1082480	1085480	and they just tear it up.
1086480	1088480	I'm talking kung-fu.
1088480	1090480	It can't get worse than this, can it?
1106480	1110480	So, I was going to say that the worst thing about you guys choosing, you, you did this,
1110480	1113480	you choosing the Wicked Witch of the West for this video,
1113480	1116480	was the fact that I had to watch this f***ing movie again.
1116480	1121480	But then, I had to watch the Muppet version, so that did put it in perspective.
1122480	1124480	Because there's a lot I can live with.
1124480	1128480	I can live with the fact that Franco looks high all the time,
1128480	1132480	and the bottomlessness to how much he does not care about his performance.
1132480	1136480	I can live with the tired-ass shitty, like, faker is deemed to be the chosen one
1136480	1140480	the second he lands in this wonderful world and he lies to everyone narrative.
1140480	1142480	God, I hate that plot.
1142480	1147480	I can even live with the fact that the studio took a universe that almost always had female protagonists,
1147480	1151480	or males that turned into females, and gave it a male one.
1151480	1155480	But I cannot take the reason why the Wicked Witch is wicked.
1158480	1161480	I want him to see me like this.
1161480	1165480	I want him to know that he was the one who made me this way.
1167480	1172480	It's just so lame.
1172480	1175480	It's like a layer cake of lame.
1175480	1178480	You peel back one layer and it's like, ugh, really?
1178480	1183480	Like, I don't know what's worse, that it's ultimately like she's a woman scorned by James Franco, of all people.
1185480	1187480	And that's why she's wicked.
1187480	1192480	Or the fact that it's actually, like, a poison given to her by her sister,
1192480	1194480	and she has no agency in her own wickedness.
1194480	1197480	See, it's not her fault that she's wicked, but it kind of is.
1197480	1201480	But it isn't, because poison, but it is, I don't know, it's stupid.
1201480	1208480	It really is the anti-wicked, where in Wicked she was like this anarchic activist fighting for the rights of the oppressed.
1208480	1210480	Here she is, a woman scorned.
1210480	1213480	Who isn't really, because hey, it isn't her fault she caught the evil.
1213480	1215480	Her sister gave it to her.
1215480	1217480	Curse you!
1217480	1220480	And it's also the worst performance.
1220480	1223480	They will run and flee for their health!
1223480	1225480	We shall not let them flee!
1225480	1228480	We shall show them no mercy!
1231480	1233480	You are welcome to return.
1236480	1238480	Never!
1238480	1242480	Disney having to be mindful of copyright ramifications once again plays a major element here,
1242480	1247480	the most prominent of which, which, which, was the look of the witch herself.
1247480	1253480	Namely, the shade of green that could not be infringed upon, or Margaret Hamilton's iconic black dress.
1253480	1260480	So if you're wondering about all that décolletage, that's sort of why. Sort of.
1260480	1264480	There are elements to this movie that aren't the worst thing ever.
1264480	1270480	In fact, this movie might have just been passively boring had it not done the thing,
1270480	1276480	but pretty much every decision surrounding The Wicked Witch of the West is the worst decision they could have made.
1278480	1285480	So if anything is going to make you appreciate Wicked, it is Oz the Great and Powerful.
1285480	1287480	Next.
1287480	1293480	The queen may be evil, but I'm wicked.
1293480	1296480	Wicked always wins.
1298480	1303480	Woof. Okay, okay. It's not as bad as the last two.
1303480	1306480	Perspective, perspective everybody, we're almost done.
1306480	1309480	Once again, a lot based on the 39 movie.
1309480	1312480	You see the copyright sidestepping with the off-brand Margaret Hamilton.
1312480	1317480	She's got this weird-ass shade of green that makes her look like she's sweating all the time,
1317480	1320480	but her dress is pretty awesome, so there's that.
1320480	1325480	I have to take it in a little bit at the hips, but it looks better on me, don't you think?
1325480	1327480	This show...
1328480	1330480	This show...
1330480	1331480	Huh.
1331480	1337480	Okay, so if you've never seen this show, it's like Disney's great big domestic AU fanfic.
1337480	1339480	Some of the time.
1339480	1341480	Something something spell something something.
1341480	1346480	Now we're in the normal world, but sometimes we're not because sometimes there's a curse.
1346480	1348480	This tends to change with the villain.
1348480	1352480	It was the evil queen of Snow White who was the spellcaster for a while,
1352480	1357480	but in this particular arc it's the Wicked Witch of the West, but then it turns out it's not.
1357480	1364480	Anyway, she is Snow White's evil queen's half-sister because she's always someone's sister or daughter or something.
1364480	1366480	I'm your sister.
1368480	1374480	But Wizard of Oz isn't really a known Disney thing, so why the Wicked Witch?
1374480	1379480	It's not till we get to her tragic backstory episode that we actually get to see Oz
1379480	1384480	and the Oz logo and the wizard himself and it's like...
1387480	1388480	Oh.
1388480	1393480	I see all. I am Oz the Great and Terrible.
1393480	1396480	Oz the Great and Vertically Integrated.
1396480	1400480	I'm just a circus huxer. I'm a showman.
1400480	1403480	Oh my god, they are just laying it all out there.
1403480	1405480	I'm just a con man.
1406480	1408480	I'm a carnival magician.
1408480	1415480	So Wicked Elphaba is green because of a date rape drug, great and powerful because heart killing drug.
1415480	1418480	So why are you green once upon a time, Wicked Witch?
1418480	1421480	She's not nearly as powerful as me. She doesn't deserve to have you as a danger.
1421480	1425480	Careful, Selina. You're turning green, dearie.
1427480	1429480	Envy will do that to you.
1430480	1435480	Yep, she literally turns green with envy.
1435480	1437480	We'll see about that.
1437480	1441480	She's also motivated by the desire to destroy her half-sister, the Evil Queen.
1441480	1443480	What the hell did I ever do to you?
1443480	1444480	Yeah.
1444480	1446480	You were born.
1447480	1449480	Well, okay then.
1449480	1454480	It's all rather convoluted. She does get doused by Dorothy, but this doesn't kill her.
1454480	1457480	Rumpelstiltskin does, because he's a major character.
1457480	1459480	And he's also the Beast.
1460480	1461480	Just...
1461480	1465480	Rumpelstiltskin never breaks.
1467480	1470480	And she doesn't melt, she shatters.
1471480	1476480	So given when this aired, the year after Oz the Great and Powerful was released,
1476480	1480480	we might be able to read this as something of a brand integration.
1480480	1483480	Subtle, but distinctive on its own.
1483480	1486480	But given there's been no real news on the sequel in two years,
1486480	1488480	they may have just been hedging their brand bets,
1488480	1492480	and keep on borrowing from the legacy of that 39 movie while we're there.
1492480	1495480	Disney just wants the rights to that movie so bad.
1495480	1499480	Something beautifully ironic for Disney wanting to slip in there
1499480	1503480	and wibble their way around all that copyright that MGM still holds for The Wizard of Oz,
1503480	1509480	and yet what company is most responsible for the extension of the length of copyright?
1509480	1511480	Hmm...
1511480	1514480	Who could it be?
1518480	1521480	To examine different incarnations of the Wicked Witch of the West
1521480	1524480	To examine different incarnations of the Wicked Witch of the West
1524480	1527480	is to examine our relationship to the iconography of the witch.
1527480	1529480	But as audiences grow and change,
1529480	1533480	we're just not interested in the idea of inherent evil witch anymore.
1533480	1538480	The idea that a powerful solitary woman is no longer as strange and perverse as it used to be.
1538480	1540480	Now it's even sympathetic.
1540480	1542480	Sometimes.
1544480	1549480	I think maybe Disney should keep its mitts off of Oz for a little while.
1550480	1553480	There's this episode of Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood that featured Margaret Hamilton,
1553480	1556480	and she talks a bit about actually playing the witch,
1556480	1558480	and how children shouldn't be scared of her.
1558480	1561480	You know, she was just acting. It's like playing make-believe.
1561480	1563480	And it is the cutest thing.
1563480	1565480	But there is one bit that sticks out to me.
1565480	1571480	And I just think that sometimes we think she's just mean and a very bad person,
1571480	1575480	but actually you have to think about her point of view.
1575480	1581480	It wasn't as happy a time as she wanted it to be, because she just never got what she wanted.
1581480	1583480	See? Maggie gets it.
1583480	1586480	Even the Wickedest of Witches has their own motivation.
1586480	1588480	True, I can't attend you here and now as I'd like.
1588480	1592480	But just try to stay out of my way. Just try.
1592480	1596480	So the last three Loose Cannon episodes have been about villains, or at least, you know, villain-ish.
1596480	1601480	So the next theme will be some flavor of real American-ish hero.
1601480	1604480	Here are your three choices. You can vote in the link below.
1604480	1607480	If you like this series, please consider supporting it on Patreon.
1607480	1612480	These episodes take a really long time to produce, and I'd like to do it more often.
1612480	1614480	That link is also below this video.
1614480	1618480	And I will announce the winner for this thing on Twitter.
1618480	1620480	Follow me here.
1620480	1624480	And hopefully I will do it sooner than two months from now.
1624480	1626480	And thank you for watching.
1634480	1636480	Thanks for watching!
