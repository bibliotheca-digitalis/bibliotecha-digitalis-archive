0	7000	It is 2017, meaning we have been living in the world of Michael Bay's Transformers for 10 years.
15000	16000	Feels like yesterday.
17000	18000	I don't play.
18000	19000	I don't play.
19000	20000	I don't play.
20000	21000	I don't play.
21000	22000	I don't play.
22000	23000	I don't play.
23000	24000	I don't play.
24000	28000	2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the first Transformers movie.
28000	35000	This year, we will see the 5th, meaning we have had, on average, one Transformers movie every two years for the last 10.
35000	37000	All of them directed by Michael Bay.
38000	43000	So, 2017 seemed like the perfect time to start a project which I'd actually been wanting to make for a while now.
44000	50000	Studying the basic aspects of film studies and film theory using Michael Bay's Transformers.
52000	54000	This is why I was put here on this earth.
54000	59000	People from both sides of the aisle, both fans of the film and people from the more academic side,
59000	63000	who aren't terribly interested in textual analysis of low art, have asked me,
63000	65000	why Transformers?
65000	70000	To which I say, aside from the surprising dearth of any real academic study on these movies,
70000	73000	considering how influential and lucrative they've been,
73000	77000	Transformers is ripe for every kind of theoretical reading.
77000	78000	Auteur theory.
78000	81000	They're so good, you know, and there's a lot of bad in the world,
81000	84000	and it's like they're always doing the right thing.
84000	85000	Feminist theory.
87000	88000	Critical race theory.
88000	90000	What's crackin', little bitches?
90000	92000	This looks like a cool place to kick it.
92000	93000	Marxist theory.
96000	97000	Queer theory.
97000	99000	Oh, look, we can't sashay him back.
99000	102000	Transformers has everything.
102000	105000	But more noteworthy is the franchise's success.
105000	109000	The first four Transformers movies alone rank among the highest-grossing franchises in film history.
109000	111000	I am directly below.
111000	113000	The enemy screwed him.
113000	116000	Ranking just under the likes of Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings movies,
116000	120000	the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and James Bond, all of which had more installments.
120000	124000	The main difference here is that these franchises, while they might have had a dud here or there,
124000	126000	You were the chosen one!
126000	131000	are generally well-regarded and have a large body of critical and academic work studying them.
132000	133000	Generally.
133000	135000	I don't like sand.
136000	138000	This is important academic work, y'all.
138000	140000	Be the change you want to see in the world.
140000	144000	So why do we write about film?
144000	147000	Academic Bill Nichols describes three major types of film writing.
147000	150000	The film review as decision-making aid for moviegoers,
150000	155000	academic critical essays, and film criticism as a dialogue among viewers.
155000	159000	According to academic Tim Corrigan, writing about film can serve several functions,
159000	162000	ranging from better understanding your own response to a movie,
162000	166000	comparing and contrasting one movie to others as a way of understanding them better,
166000	169000	and making connections between a movie and other areas of the culture
169000	172000	to illuminate both the culture and the movies it produces.
172000	175000	Mainstream media sack. They're lying to us, alright?
175000	180000	Film, like contemporary literature, represents the most artistically resourceful use of a given language,
180000	183000	in this case, an audiovisual language.
185000	188000	Great films are the modern vernacular equivalent of the ancient classics,
188000	193000	embodiment of the human capacity to imagine and create in a commonly understood language.
193000	199000	That last bit seems frivolous to some, but to me it is probably the most important aspect of film study,
199000	203000	because movies, especially really popular movies that a lot of people see,
203000	207000	illuminate the dreams, desires, and values of a culture.
207000	212000	And if Transformers is one of the most lucrative film franchises of this generation...
216000	220000	What that means merits discussion!
220000	223000	In the words of film historians Tim Corrigan and Nancy White,
223000	227000	film studies is a critical discipline that promotes serious reflection on the movies
227000	229000	and the place of film in culture.
229000	234000	Film studies is an umbrella term, under which all areas of film academia and film writing fall.
234000	239000	But an important thing to keep in mind is that each of these branches of study, in theory, are not islands.
239000	243000	They mesh, mix around, influence each other, and are influenced.
243000	247000	You can't really do a feminist reading without influence from the psychoanalytical side
247000	249000	and the history side, for instance.
249000	253000	We all intrinsically know and understand what this scene is trying to get across to us,
253000	256000	but without the context of similar framing devices throughout film history
256000	259000	paired with a psychoanalytical subtext motivating it,
259000	262000	not only would we not have the words to describe the text,
262000	265000	but the text itself would be meaningless without the context of every movie
265000	267000	and every story that had ever come before it.
267000	271000	To quote film historian Bill Nichols on the current state of film studies,
271000	273000	the underlying assumptions are,
273000	275000	1. Film's social implications are paramount,
275000	278000	even though cinema relies on aesthetic means to convey these implications effectively.
278000	282000	Freedom is the light of all sentient beings.
282000	287000	2. Viewers respond to films in direct relation to their actual social and historical situation.
287000	292000	As a result, the perceived significance or greatness of a film will vary with time, place, and who is watching it.
292000	293000	A little rice with a piece of meat.
293000	295000	A little tuna for the leader.
295000	297000	English, please.
297000	299000	And 3. Different viewers and groups of viewers,
299000	300000	at the same time and place,
300000	302000	interpret any film, including great films,
302000	304000	in different but understandable ways.
306000	307000	Cool, Mom!
307000	309000	My point here is that the term film studies
309000	312000	is kind of meaningless outside of the umbrella term.
312000	314000	The real meat of film studies
314000	317000	comes from the individual disciplines within that umbrella.
317000	319000	And that is why this is a...
319000	324000	twelve-ish part mini-series instead of one.
324000	327000	Now, personally, I feel like the study of the technical aspects of film
327000	330000	and the study of the sociological and theoretical aspects of film
330000	334000	are complementary, and one cannot really exist without the other.
334000	337000	When you apply critical analysis to a work or body of work,
337000	339000	it isn't so much about issuing a manifesto
339000	342000	as it is issuing a theory-based argument
342000	344000	that then becomes a part of a greater discussion.
344000	347000	These discussions can be fairly simple or more complex,
347000	350000	but the thing to remember about any form of critical analysis
350000	352000	is that it is not set in stone.
352000	354000	These things change over time.
354000	356000	They are fluid and always evolving.
356000	359000	And that's kind of the great thing about theory and critical analysis.
359000	362000	It's important to understand the language of the technical elements,
362000	365000	as everything you see on the screen is trying to convey something to you,
365000	369000	be that an emotion idea or a theme or a plot point, and so on.
369000	371000	While I will talk a little bit about film language,
371000	373000	story structure, and the technical side of things,
373000	378000	the purpose of this series is to focus more on theoretical interpretations.
378000	382000	And if you've been around the film studies block a time or two
382000	385000	and feel like this is a little bit 101,
385000	388000	then yeah, yeah, that is literally the point.
388000	391000	That certain films succeed, even flourish,
391000	394000	where others don't reflect something about us as a culture.
394000	398000	And I'm not trying to say that Transformers is something dark and devious.
398000	401000	I'm not interested in defending the existence of these movies,
401000	404000	nor am I going to decry them as the herald for the end of Western civilization.
404000	407000	No, I think even Transformers goes a little bit more complex
407000	410000	than movie good or movie bad.
410000	413000	What I do intend to argue against is the automatic dismissal
413000	417000	of any serious discussion on the topic of Transformers or Michael Bay.
417000	420000	And I do understand the impulse to stick your fingers in your ears
420000	422000	and go la-la-la-la-la at the things you don't like,
422000	425000	but that does not mean that these things don't keep chugging along,
425000	428000	existing, influencing, and being influenced.
428000	432000	By dismissing Michael Bay, you also dismiss his worldview,
432000	437000	the themes and ideas he pushes, what resonates with his audience, and why.
437000	439000	In the words of Thomas Doherty,
440000	444000	is less a window on the past than a screen reflecting the preoccupations of the beholder,
444000	448000	a canvas for interpretive dexterity and polemical praxis.
448000	452000	I ate the whole plate. The whole plate.
452000	455000	So with this series, we are going to delve into the Transformers franchise,
455000	460000	its influence and its influences, its meaning and its intent.
460000	463000	And you can say that this sort of thing is not worth your time,
463000	466000	but that does not mean that a lot of people are not seeing these movies
466000	467000	or that they're not important.
467000	472000	And it certainly does not mean that movies like this are going to go away anytime soon.
