1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It is 2017, meaning we have been living in the world of Michael Bay's Transformers for 10 years.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Feels like yesterday.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I don't play.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I don't play.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I don't play.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I don't play.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I don't play.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I don't play.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I don't play.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the first Transformers movie.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This year, we will see the 5th, meaning we have had, on average, one Transformers movie every two years for the last 10.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
All of them directed by Michael Bay.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So, 2017 seemed like the perfect time to start a project which I'd actually been wanting to make for a while now.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Studying the basic aspects of film studies and film theory using Michael Bay's Transformers.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This is why I was put here on this earth.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
People from both sides of the aisle, both fans of the film and people from the more academic side,

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
who aren't terribly interested in textual analysis of low art, have asked me,

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
why Transformers?

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
To which I say, aside from the surprising dearth of any real academic study on these movies,

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
considering how influential and lucrative they've been,

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Transformers is ripe for every kind of theoretical reading.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Auteur theory.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
They're so good, you know, and there's a lot of bad in the world,

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and it's like they're always doing the right thing.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Feminist theory.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Critical race theory.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What's crackin', little bitches?

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This looks like a cool place to kick it.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Marxist theory.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Queer theory.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Oh, look, we can't sashay him back.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Transformers has everything.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But more noteworthy is the franchise's success.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The first four Transformers movies alone rank among the highest-grossing franchises in film history.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I am directly below.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The enemy screwed him.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Ranking just under the likes of Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings movies,

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and James Bond, all of which had more installments.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The main difference here is that these franchises, while they might have had a dud here or there,

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You were the chosen one!

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
are generally well-regarded and have a large body of critical and academic work studying them.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Generally.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I don't like sand.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This is important academic work, y'all.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Be the change you want to see in the world.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So why do we write about film?

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Academic Bill Nichols describes three major types of film writing.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The film review as decision-making aid for moviegoers,

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
academic critical essays, and film criticism as a dialogue among viewers.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
According to academic Tim Corrigan, writing about film can serve several functions,

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
ranging from better understanding your own response to a movie,

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
comparing and contrasting one movie to others as a way of understanding them better,

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and making connections between a movie and other areas of the culture

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
to illuminate both the culture and the movies it produces.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Mainstream media sack. They're lying to us, alright?

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Film, like contemporary literature, represents the most artistically resourceful use of a given language,

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
in this case, an audiovisual language.

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Great films are the modern vernacular equivalent of the ancient classics,

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
embodiment of the human capacity to imagine and create in a commonly understood language.

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That last bit seems frivolous to some, but to me it is probably the most important aspect of film study,

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
because movies, especially really popular movies that a lot of people see,

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
illuminate the dreams, desires, and values of a culture.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And if Transformers is one of the most lucrative film franchises of this generation...

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What that means merits discussion!

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
In the words of film historians Tim Corrigan and Nancy White,

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
film studies is a critical discipline that promotes serious reflection on the movies

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and the place of film in culture.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Film studies is an umbrella term, under which all areas of film academia and film writing fall.

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But an important thing to keep in mind is that each of these branches of study, in theory, are not islands.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
They mesh, mix around, influence each other, and are influenced.

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You can't really do a feminist reading without influence from the psychoanalytical side

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and the history side, for instance.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We all intrinsically know and understand what this scene is trying to get across to us,

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
but without the context of similar framing devices throughout film history

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
paired with a psychoanalytical subtext motivating it,

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
not only would we not have the words to describe the text,

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
but the text itself would be meaningless without the context of every movie

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and every story that had ever come before it.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
To quote film historian Bill Nichols on the current state of film studies,

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
the underlying assumptions are,

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
1. Film's social implications are paramount,

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
even though cinema relies on aesthetic means to convey these implications effectively.

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Freedom is the light of all sentient beings.

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
2. Viewers respond to films in direct relation to their actual social and historical situation.

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
As a result, the perceived significance or greatness of a film will vary with time, place, and who is watching it.

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
A little rice with a piece of meat.

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
A little tuna for the leader.

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
English, please.

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And 3. Different viewers and groups of viewers,

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
at the same time and place,

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
interpret any film, including great films,

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
in different but understandable ways.

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Cool, Mom!

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
My point here is that the term film studies

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
is kind of meaningless outside of the umbrella term.

96
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The real meat of film studies

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
comes from the individual disciplines within that umbrella.

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And that is why this is a...

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
twelve-ish part mini-series instead of one.

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Now, personally, I feel like the study of the technical aspects of film

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and the study of the sociological and theoretical aspects of film

102
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
are complementary, and one cannot really exist without the other.

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
When you apply critical analysis to a work or body of work,

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
it isn't so much about issuing a manifesto

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
as it is issuing a theory-based argument

106
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
that then becomes a part of a greater discussion.

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
These discussions can be fairly simple or more complex,

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
but the thing to remember about any form of critical analysis

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
is that it is not set in stone.

110
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
These things change over time.

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
They are fluid and always evolving.

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And that's kind of the great thing about theory and critical analysis.

113
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's important to understand the language of the technical elements,

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
as everything you see on the screen is trying to convey something to you,

115
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
be that an emotion idea or a theme or a plot point, and so on.

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
While I will talk a little bit about film language,

117
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
story structure, and the technical side of things,

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
the purpose of this series is to focus more on theoretical interpretations.

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And if you've been around the film studies block a time or two

120
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and feel like this is a little bit 101,

121
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
then yeah, yeah, that is literally the point.

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That certain films succeed, even flourish,

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
where others don't reflect something about us as a culture.

124
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And I'm not trying to say that Transformers is something dark and devious.

125
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm not interested in defending the existence of these movies,

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
nor am I going to decry them as the herald for the end of Western civilization.

127
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
No, I think even Transformers goes a little bit more complex

128
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
than movie good or movie bad.

129
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What I do intend to argue against is the automatic dismissal

130
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
of any serious discussion on the topic of Transformers or Michael Bay.

131
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And I do understand the impulse to stick your fingers in your ears

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
and go la-la-la-la-la at the things you don't like,

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
but that does not mean that these things don't keep chugging along,

134
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
existing, influencing, and being influenced.

135
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
By dismissing Michael Bay, you also dismiss his worldview,

136
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
the themes and ideas he pushes, what resonates with his audience, and why.

137
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
In the words of Thomas Doherty,

138
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
is less a window on the past than a screen reflecting the preoccupations of the beholder,

139
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
a canvas for interpretive dexterity and polemical praxis.

140
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I ate the whole plate. The whole plate.

141
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So with this series, we are going to delve into the Transformers franchise,

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
its influence and its influences, its meaning and its intent.

143
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And you can say that this sort of thing is not worth your time,

144
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
but that does not mean that a lot of people are not seeing these movies

145
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
or that they're not important.

146
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And it certainly does not mean that movies like this are going to go away anytime soon.
