00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
It is 2017, meaning we have been living in the world of Michael Bay's Transformers for 10 years.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
Feels like yesterday.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
I don't play.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
I don't play.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
I don't play.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
I don't play.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
I don't play.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
I don't play.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
I don't play.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the first Transformers movie.

00:28.000 --> 00:35.000
This year, we will see the 5th, meaning we have had, on average, one Transformers movie every two years for the last 10.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
All of them directed by Michael Bay.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
So, 2017 seemed like the perfect time to start a project which I'd actually been wanting to make for a while now.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
Studying the basic aspects of film studies and film theory using Michael Bay's Transformers.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
This is why I was put here on this earth.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
People from both sides of the aisle, both fans of the film and people from the more academic side,

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
who aren't terribly interested in textual analysis of low art, have asked me,

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
why Transformers?

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
To which I say, aside from the surprising dearth of any real academic study on these movies,

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
considering how influential and lucrative they've been,

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
Transformers is ripe for every kind of theoretical reading.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Auteur theory.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
They're so good, you know, and there's a lot of bad in the world,

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
and it's like they're always doing the right thing.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Feminist theory.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Critical race theory.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
What's crackin', little bitches?

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
This looks like a cool place to kick it.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Marxist theory.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Queer theory.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Oh, look, we can't sashay him back.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Transformers has everything.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
But more noteworthy is the franchise's success.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
The first four Transformers movies alone rank among the highest-grossing franchises in film history.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
I am directly below.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
The enemy screwed him.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
Ranking just under the likes of Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings movies,

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and James Bond, all of which had more installments.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
The main difference here is that these franchises, while they might have had a dud here or there,

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
You were the chosen one!

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
are generally well-regarded and have a large body of critical and academic work studying them.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Generally.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
I don't like sand.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
This is important academic work, y'all.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Be the change you want to see in the world.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
So why do we write about film?

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Academic Bill Nichols describes three major types of film writing.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
The film review as decision-making aid for moviegoers,

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
academic critical essays, and film criticism as a dialogue among viewers.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
According to academic Tim Corrigan, writing about film can serve several functions,

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
ranging from better understanding your own response to a movie,

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
comparing and contrasting one movie to others as a way of understanding them better,

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
and making connections between a movie and other areas of the culture

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
to illuminate both the culture and the movies it produces.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
Mainstream media sack. They're lying to us, alright?

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
Film, like contemporary literature, represents the most artistically resourceful use of a given language,

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
in this case, an audiovisual language.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Great films are the modern vernacular equivalent of the ancient classics,

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
embodiment of the human capacity to imagine and create in a commonly understood language.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
That last bit seems frivolous to some, but to me it is probably the most important aspect of film study,

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
because movies, especially really popular movies that a lot of people see,

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
illuminate the dreams, desires, and values of a culture.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
And if Transformers is one of the most lucrative film franchises of this generation...

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
What that means merits discussion!

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
In the words of film historians Tim Corrigan and Nancy White,

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
film studies is a critical discipline that promotes serious reflection on the movies

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
and the place of film in culture.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
Film studies is an umbrella term, under which all areas of film academia and film writing fall.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
But an important thing to keep in mind is that each of these branches of study, in theory, are not islands.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
They mesh, mix around, influence each other, and are influenced.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
You can't really do a feminist reading without influence from the psychoanalytical side

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
and the history side, for instance.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
We all intrinsically know and understand what this scene is trying to get across to us,

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
but without the context of similar framing devices throughout film history

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
paired with a psychoanalytical subtext motivating it,

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
not only would we not have the words to describe the text,

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
but the text itself would be meaningless without the context of every movie

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
and every story that had ever come before it.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
To quote film historian Bill Nichols on the current state of film studies,

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
the underlying assumptions are,

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
1. Film's social implications are paramount,

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
even though cinema relies on aesthetic means to convey these implications effectively.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
Freedom is the light of all sentient beings.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
2. Viewers respond to films in direct relation to their actual social and historical situation.

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
As a result, the perceived significance or greatness of a film will vary with time, place, and who is watching it.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
A little rice with a piece of meat.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
A little tuna for the leader.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
English, please.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
And 3. Different viewers and groups of viewers,

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
at the same time and place,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
interpret any film, including great films,

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
in different but understandable ways.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Cool, Mom!

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
My point here is that the term film studies

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
is kind of meaningless outside of the umbrella term.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
The real meat of film studies

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
comes from the individual disciplines within that umbrella.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
And that is why this is a...

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
twelve-ish part mini-series instead of one.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Now, personally, I feel like the study of the technical aspects of film

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
and the study of the sociological and theoretical aspects of film

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
are complementary, and one cannot really exist without the other.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
When you apply critical analysis to a work or body of work,

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
it isn't so much about issuing a manifesto

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
as it is issuing a theory-based argument

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
that then becomes a part of a greater discussion.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
These discussions can be fairly simple or more complex,

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
but the thing to remember about any form of critical analysis

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
is that it is not set in stone.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
These things change over time.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
They are fluid and always evolving.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
And that's kind of the great thing about theory and critical analysis.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
It's important to understand the language of the technical elements,

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
as everything you see on the screen is trying to convey something to you,

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
be that an emotion idea or a theme or a plot point, and so on.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
While I will talk a little bit about film language,

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
story structure, and the technical side of things,

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
the purpose of this series is to focus more on theoretical interpretations.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
And if you've been around the film studies block a time or two

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
and feel like this is a little bit 101,

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
then yeah, yeah, that is literally the point.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
That certain films succeed, even flourish,

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
where others don't reflect something about us as a culture.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
And I'm not trying to say that Transformers is something dark and devious.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
I'm not interested in defending the existence of these movies,

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
nor am I going to decry them as the herald for the end of Western civilization.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
No, I think even Transformers goes a little bit more complex

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
than movie good or movie bad.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
What I do intend to argue against is the automatic dismissal

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
of any serious discussion on the topic of Transformers or Michael Bay.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
And I do understand the impulse to stick your fingers in your ears

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
and go la-la-la-la-la at the things you don't like,

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
but that does not mean that these things don't keep chugging along,

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
existing, influencing, and being influenced.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
By dismissing Michael Bay, you also dismiss his worldview,

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
the themes and ideas he pushes, what resonates with his audience, and why.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
In the words of Thomas Doherty,

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
is less a window on the past than a screen reflecting the preoccupations of the beholder,

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
a canvas for interpretive dexterity and polemical praxis.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
I ate the whole plate. The whole plate.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
So with this series, we are going to delve into the Transformers franchise,

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
its influence and its influences, its meaning and its intent.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
And you can say that this sort of thing is not worth your time,

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
but that does not mean that a lot of people are not seeing these movies

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
or that they're not important.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
And it certainly does not mean that movies like this are going to go away anytime soon.
