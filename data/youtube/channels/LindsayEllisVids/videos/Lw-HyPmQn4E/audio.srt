1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
Prior to the Silver Age of comics and the rare event that superheroes ran into each other,

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,960
odds were that, one, they probably have already heard of each other,

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,560
and two, they would probably get along immediately because, you know, they're the good guys.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,200
It just makes sense.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,960
But then came the Fantastic Four, comic bookdom's favorite straight-laced family

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,720
who apparently just feels the need to fight everyone they meet.

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,800
And from then on, one of our proudest comic book traditions is superheroes fighting each other,

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,920
usually for no good reason.

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,520
I say no good reason because generally fights arise as the result of a misunderstanding and or manipulation,

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,120
and could be avoided by the two fighting parties behaving like adults and talking things out

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,120
rather than launching a full-blown assault on each other at the very first opportunity,

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,520
only to realize later, hey, we were both the good guys.

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,120
But, you know, readers wanted to see heroes fight, so who cares how contrived it got?

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,920
So this list of superhero battles through the ages is not exhaustive

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,920
because I would be low-balling it to say that in all of published comics,

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,320
this has probably happened in the thousands of times.

17
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,720
But here are some cherry-picked examples of the history of comic book superhero fights,

18
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,520
and we're going to stick with the big two.

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,720
Because reasons.

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,920
Until Prince Namor the Submariner met and battled with the original Human Torch,

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,920
the characters of Marvel Comics seemed to exist only in their own separate story universes.

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,720
So this battle basically created the idea that there was a shared Marvel Universe.

23
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,720
Namor is kind of an anti-hero in that his motivations are fairly pure.

24
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,520
He wants to protect the oceans, but he also wants to destroy the United States to do so.

25
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,320
So this one actually kind of falls on the less contrived end.

26
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,720
But then came the Fantastic Four, and they set the trend for superhero meetups,

27
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,920
at least for the foreseeable future.

28
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,520
Either Party A has not heard of Party B, or Party A has heard of Party B,

29
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,920
but only bad things like the X-Men are mutant terrorists,

30
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,120
or Spider-Man has a bad rep because the editor of the New York Post really doesn't like him.

31
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,120
The more straight-laced law-abiding group of the Marvel Universe,

32
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,720
the Fantastic Four fought everybody.

33
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,520
The Avengers, the Silver Surfer, the Hulk, I mean, no surprise there,

34
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,120
and of course Spider-Man.

35
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,120
He wanted to join the Fantastic Four because he figures,

36
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,320
hey, everybody likes the Fantastic Four, and that might improve my image.

37
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,120
He goes about this by picking a fight with them.

38
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,520
In the end, his plan doesn't work, not because they were like,

39
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,920
hey, that was a really stupid way to try to join our superhero group,

40
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,920
but apparently because the Fantastic Four are a non-profit.

41
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,520
Wolverine was introduced to the Marvel Universe by a battle, this time with the Hulk.

42
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,720
But that one doesn't need much justification, as both the Hulk and Wolverine will fight anything,

43
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,320
so putting these two together in the same Canada is basically asking for it.

44
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,720
But when there weren't misunderstandings, there were manipulations.

45
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,520
Thor battled the Silver Surfer because Loki.

46
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,720
He convinced him that Thor was an evil god.

47
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,120
Speaking of Loki, the Avengers basically formed after Loki tricked Thor into fighting the Hulk,

48
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,520
after which everybody teamed up to turn on Loki and lo the Avengers.

49
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,120
Until Hulk left an issue or two later.

50
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,520
Superman even fought Spider-Man at one point

51
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,720
because he mistakenly blamed Spider-Man for kidnapping Lois Lane.

52
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:19,520
This was made more of an even match because Lex Luthor had fired red sun radiation at Spider-Man's suit.

53
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,120
So, you know, Superman was a little wiltier than he normally was.

54
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,320
Mind control was a popular one.

55
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,520
Here's Namor again fighting the Fantastic Four, again under mind control.

56
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,720
There's also another issue where Professor X, again under mind control,

57
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,520
just up and tells the X-Men they need to go destroy the Fantastic Four for no reason,

58
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,520
and the X-Men are like, okay, boss.

59
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,920
The Justice League was manipulated into fighting the Avengers because...

60
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
reasons.

61
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,720
Of course, not all battles need to be misunderstandings or manipulations.

62
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,920
Superman and the Flash battled via footrace to raise money for charity.

63
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,920
In the end, the two tied because they decided that their charities were more important than their egos,

64
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,720
and that's just adorable.

65
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,920
But then came the 80s, and adorable's not allowed.

66
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,320
It's gritty realism time.

67
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,920
So, misunderstandings and manipulation from bad guys is not so satisfying anymore.

68
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,320
The Spider-Man vs. Wolverine series was not really a knock-down-drag-out brawl,

69
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,720
so much as Spider-Man edging in on Wolverine's turf and Wolverine telling him to back off, bub.

70
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,120
The Fantastic Four also had a feud with the X-Men,

71
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,520
so this time it was because Reed Richard wasn't helping them enough,

72
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,720
in this case to save Kitty Pryde from disintegrating.

73
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,520
This is also to say nothing of the countless inter-X-Men feuds,

74
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,320
exacerbated by certain villains switching sides constantly, and vice versa.

75
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,120
But the most well-known battle from this era is between Superman and Batman in The Dark Knight Returns.

76
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,920
Frank Miller took the attitude that Batman and Superman could never really be friends with one another

77
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,520
because their personalities are too at odds.

78
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,520
Taking place in a dark, Watchmen-ish alternate future timeline,

79
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,920
Superman has become more or less an agent of the government,

80
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:03,520
and Batman, unwilling to abide by The Man, is forced into conflict with Superman.

81
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,520
So if you're wondering why Batman's tech suit in Batman vs. Superman looks so chunky and silly, this is why.

82
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,520
In the end, the two are pretty evenly matched, Superman with his strength and Batman with his cleverness and technology,

83
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,720
but Batman ultimately has to fake his own death in order to win,

84
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,720
or at least to get the government to stop looking his way.

85
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,520
But let's not forget about Wonder Woman, who battles Batman in Hikiteia.

86
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,920
Penned by Greg Rucka, this is the one with the famous Wonder Woman shoe holding down Batman's head.

87
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,320
Hashtag misandry.

88
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,120
In this one, Diana takes a vow to protect this girl,

89
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,120
only to discover that her charge is a fugitive on the run from Batman,

90
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:47,720
putting her at odds with him in this duty vs. justice story, and a terrible crisis for Diana's character.

91
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,120
Speaking of crisis, Infinite Crisis was another draw for the Batman vs. Superman thing.

92
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,120
This one followed Identity Crisis.

93
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,320
During Identity Crisis, Batman walked in on something that Justice League did not want him to see,

94
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,320
and he got his memory wiped.

95
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,720
As Batman recovered his memory, he set up a massive satellite network to track all superhuman activity on the planet

96
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,320
because he decided that superhumans cannot be trusted.

97
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,720
Then this dude named Maxwell Lord co-ops Batman's technology to mind control Superman,

98
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,320
and to try to get him to kill Batman.

99
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,320
And only Wonder Woman killing this guy could stop Superman's rampage,

100
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,120
which was big in-universe deal because she did it on live television.

101
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,320
Oopsie-daisy.

102
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,320
Speaking of the Justice League, they battle the Teen Titans in the Technus Imperative.

103
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,720
Teen Titan Cyborg has decided he wants to steal the moon.

104
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,520
For... reasons.

105
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,920
The Justice League decide that the thing to do here is to destroy Cyborg in order to save the moon,

106
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,920
but the Titans want to defend their friend.

107
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,920
So, fight, fight, fight, but only sort of,

108
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,720
because it turns out the Justice League are only doing their thing as a way to cause a distraction for Cyborg,

109
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,520
and eventually the two teams team up and save the day.

110
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,720
A later similar dark alternate future to The Dark Knight Returns is Kingdom Come.

111
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,120
Gritty, violent, vigilante murder heroes are all the rage in this timeline

112
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,120
until one of the murder heroes nukes half of Kansas.

113
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,320
Superman and Wonder Woman have a disagreement with Batman on how to go about dealing with this problem,

114
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,720
and before you know it, we have murder hero gulags and re-education camps

115
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,920
and a big brawl between Superman's forces, Batman's forces, and the murder heroes.

116
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,520
Eventually, world leaders have to be the adults here and step in and tell them to stop

117
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,520
or we're going to turn this car around by nuking a majority of the superhero population.

118
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,320
In the Marvel Universe, Civil War is pretty similar to Kingdom Come, minus the alternate timeline part.

119
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,920
We discussed Civil War back in the Captain America episode.

120
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,920
Eh.

121
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,320
But here is a quick recap.

122
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:46,520
After some D-list heroes nuke a school, a superhero registration act is introduced,

123
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,520
championed by Iron Man, among many others,

124
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,720
and opposed by Captain America, among many others.

125
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,120
There are various and sundry tie-in comics that are not the worst thing ever,

126
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,920
but the seven issues of Civil War are predicated on the premise that no one thinks like an adult

127
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:06,120
and everyone, especially Captain America, is behaving horribly out of character.

128
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,720
Once again, gulags for superhero who don't comply with the totalitarian whatever,

129
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,720
courtesy of an also-wildly-out-of-character Reed Richards,

130
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,520
only this time they're interdimensional space gulags.

131
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,920
Civil War ends when Captain America, after six issues of acting like a belligerent asshole

132
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,920
incapable of human reason, goes,

133
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,920
wait guys, this is stupid,

134
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,920
and turns himself in.

135
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,120
And then he's assassinated and it's like, what?

136
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,720
The upcoming movie appears to give Iron Man and Captain America more concrete motivations,

137
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,920
and honestly, any movie that they made could only be an improvement on the source material

138
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,720
as far as I am concerned.

139
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,120
As for Dawn of Justice, with so much comic history to draw on,

140
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,720
I'm sure Batman and Superman have a totally legit and not contrived reason for fighting each other.

141
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,520
And if we believe there's even a 1% chance that he is our enemy,

142
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,120
we have to take it as an absolute certainty.

143
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:03,520
Like Batman quoting Dick Cheney to justify his xenophobia and violence.

144
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,720
Well, points for originality, Zack Snyder.

145
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,720
You, uh, you always fail to disappoint.

146
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,320
We'll talk about that another time, after the movie comes out.

147
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,720
Anyway, thank you, of course, patrons for making this episode and this show possible,

148
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,320
and thank you to Louis Linkara-Love-Hogg for helping me with the DC stuff.

149
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,720
Thank you again for watching.

150
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
Patreon, Twitter...

151
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,520
Can you tell I didn't write out a concrete conclusion for this one?

152
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,520
See, I was supposed to end with a dig at Zack Snyder, and then I forgot to write in the thank yous.

153
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,520
