0	3800	Prior to the Silver Age of comics and the rare event that superheroes ran into each other,
3800	6960	odds were that, one, they probably have already heard of each other,
6960	11560	and two, they would probably get along immediately because, you know, they're the good guys.
11560	13200	It just makes sense.
13200	17960	But then came the Fantastic Four, comic bookdom's favorite straight-laced family
17960	20720	who apparently just feels the need to fight everyone they meet.
20720	25800	And from then on, one of our proudest comic book traditions is superheroes fighting each other,
25800	27920	usually for no good reason.
27920	34520	I say no good reason because generally fights arise as the result of a misunderstanding and or manipulation,
34520	39120	and could be avoided by the two fighting parties behaving like adults and talking things out
39120	43120	rather than launching a full-blown assault on each other at the very first opportunity,
43120	46520	only to realize later, hey, we were both the good guys.
46520	51120	But, you know, readers wanted to see heroes fight, so who cares how contrived it got?
51120	55920	So this list of superhero battles through the ages is not exhaustive
55920	59920	because I would be low-balling it to say that in all of published comics,
59920	63320	this has probably happened in the thousands of times.
63320	68720	But here are some cherry-picked examples of the history of comic book superhero fights,
68720	71520	and we're going to stick with the big two.
71520	72720	Because reasons.
72720	76920	Until Prince Namor the Submariner met and battled with the original Human Torch,
76920	81920	the characters of Marvel Comics seemed to exist only in their own separate story universes.
81920	86720	So this battle basically created the idea that there was a shared Marvel Universe.
86720	90720	Namor is kind of an anti-hero in that his motivations are fairly pure.
90720	96520	He wants to protect the oceans, but he also wants to destroy the United States to do so.
96520	100320	So this one actually kind of falls on the less contrived end.
100320	105720	But then came the Fantastic Four, and they set the trend for superhero meetups,
105720	107920	at least for the foreseeable future.
107920	112520	Either Party A has not heard of Party B, or Party A has heard of Party B,
112520	115920	but only bad things like the X-Men are mutant terrorists,
115920	121120	or Spider-Man has a bad rep because the editor of the New York Post really doesn't like him.
121120	124120	The more straight-laced law-abiding group of the Marvel Universe,
124120	126720	the Fantastic Four fought everybody.
126720	131520	The Avengers, the Silver Surfer, the Hulk, I mean, no surprise there,
131520	133120	and of course Spider-Man.
133120	136120	He wanted to join the Fantastic Four because he figures,
136120	140320	hey, everybody likes the Fantastic Four, and that might improve my image.
140320	143120	He goes about this by picking a fight with them.
143120	145520	In the end, his plan doesn't work, not because they were like,
145520	148920	hey, that was a really stupid way to try to join our superhero group,
148920	151920	but apparently because the Fantastic Four are a non-profit.
151920	156520	Wolverine was introduced to the Marvel Universe by a battle, this time with the Hulk.
156520	160720	But that one doesn't need much justification, as both the Hulk and Wolverine will fight anything,
160720	165320	so putting these two together in the same Canada is basically asking for it.
165320	168720	But when there weren't misunderstandings, there were manipulations.
168720	172520	Thor battled the Silver Surfer because Loki.
172520	174720	He convinced him that Thor was an evil god.
174720	180120	Speaking of Loki, the Avengers basically formed after Loki tricked Thor into fighting the Hulk,
180120	185520	after which everybody teamed up to turn on Loki and lo the Avengers.
185520	188120	Until Hulk left an issue or two later.
188120	190520	Superman even fought Spider-Man at one point
190520	193720	because he mistakenly blamed Spider-Man for kidnapping Lois Lane.
193720	199520	This was made more of an even match because Lex Luthor had fired red sun radiation at Spider-Man's suit.
199520	204120	So, you know, Superman was a little wiltier than he normally was.
204120	206320	Mind control was a popular one.
206320	210520	Here's Namor again fighting the Fantastic Four, again under mind control.
210520	213720	There's also another issue where Professor X, again under mind control,
213720	217520	just up and tells the X-Men they need to go destroy the Fantastic Four for no reason,
217520	220520	and the X-Men are like, okay, boss.
220520	224920	The Justice League was manipulated into fighting the Avengers because...
224920	225920	reasons.
225920	230720	Of course, not all battles need to be misunderstandings or manipulations.
230720	234920	Superman and the Flash battled via footrace to raise money for charity.
234920	239920	In the end, the two tied because they decided that their charities were more important than their egos,
239920	241720	and that's just adorable.
241720	244920	But then came the 80s, and adorable's not allowed.
244920	246320	It's gritty realism time.
246320	250920	So, misunderstandings and manipulation from bad guys is not so satisfying anymore.
250920	255320	The Spider-Man vs. Wolverine series was not really a knock-down-drag-out brawl,
255320	260720	so much as Spider-Man edging in on Wolverine's turf and Wolverine telling him to back off, bub.
260720	263120	The Fantastic Four also had a feud with the X-Men,
263120	266520	so this time it was because Reed Richard wasn't helping them enough,
266520	269720	in this case to save Kitty Pryde from disintegrating.
269720	273520	This is also to say nothing of the countless inter-X-Men feuds,
273520	278320	exacerbated by certain villains switching sides constantly, and vice versa.
278320	284120	But the most well-known battle from this era is between Superman and Batman in The Dark Knight Returns.
284120	288920	Frank Miller took the attitude that Batman and Superman could never really be friends with one another
288920	291520	because their personalities are too at odds.
291520	295520	Taking place in a dark, Watchmen-ish alternate future timeline,
295520	297920	Superman has become more or less an agent of the government,
297920	303520	and Batman, unwilling to abide by The Man, is forced into conflict with Superman.
303520	310520	So if you're wondering why Batman's tech suit in Batman vs. Superman looks so chunky and silly, this is why.
310520	316520	In the end, the two are pretty evenly matched, Superman with his strength and Batman with his cleverness and technology,
316520	319720	but Batman ultimately has to fake his own death in order to win,
319720	322720	or at least to get the government to stop looking his way.
322720	326520	But let's not forget about Wonder Woman, who battles Batman in Hikiteia.
326520	331920	Penned by Greg Rucka, this is the one with the famous Wonder Woman shoe holding down Batman's head.
331920	333320	Hashtag misandry.
333320	336120	In this one, Diana takes a vow to protect this girl,
336120	340120	only to discover that her charge is a fugitive on the run from Batman,
340120	347720	putting her at odds with him in this duty vs. justice story, and a terrible crisis for Diana's character.
347720	353120	Speaking of crisis, Infinite Crisis was another draw for the Batman vs. Superman thing.
353120	355120	This one followed Identity Crisis.
355120	360320	During Identity Crisis, Batman walked in on something that Justice League did not want him to see,
360320	362320	and he got his memory wiped.
362320	367720	As Batman recovered his memory, he set up a massive satellite network to track all superhuman activity on the planet
367720	370320	because he decided that superhumans cannot be trusted.
370320	374720	Then this dude named Maxwell Lord co-ops Batman's technology to mind control Superman,
374720	377320	and to try to get him to kill Batman.
377320	381320	And only Wonder Woman killing this guy could stop Superman's rampage,
381520	386120	which was big in-universe deal because she did it on live television.
386120	387320	Oopsie-daisy.
387320	391320	Speaking of the Justice League, they battle the Teen Titans in the Technus Imperative.
391320	395720	Teen Titan Cyborg has decided he wants to steal the moon.
395720	398520	For... reasons.
398520	402920	The Justice League decide that the thing to do here is to destroy Cyborg in order to save the moon,
402920	404920	but the Titans want to defend their friend.
404920	407920	So, fight, fight, fight, but only sort of,
407920	412720	because it turns out the Justice League are only doing their thing as a way to cause a distraction for Cyborg,
412720	415520	and eventually the two teams team up and save the day.
415520	419720	A later similar dark alternate future to The Dark Knight Returns is Kingdom Come.
419720	423120	Gritty, violent, vigilante murder heroes are all the rage in this timeline
423120	426120	until one of the murder heroes nukes half of Kansas.
426120	431320	Superman and Wonder Woman have a disagreement with Batman on how to go about dealing with this problem,
431320	435720	and before you know it, we have murder hero gulags and re-education camps
435720	440920	and a big brawl between Superman's forces, Batman's forces, and the murder heroes.
440920	444520	Eventually, world leaders have to be the adults here and step in and tell them to stop
444520	449520	or we're going to turn this car around by nuking a majority of the superhero population.
449520	455320	In the Marvel Universe, Civil War is pretty similar to Kingdom Come, minus the alternate timeline part.
455320	458920	We discussed Civil War back in the Captain America episode.
458920	459920	Eh.
459920	461320	But here is a quick recap.
461320	466520	After some D-list heroes nuke a school, a superhero registration act is introduced,
466520	469520	championed by Iron Man, among many others,
469520	472720	and opposed by Captain America, among many others.
472720	476120	There are various and sundry tie-in comics that are not the worst thing ever,
476120	480920	but the seven issues of Civil War are predicated on the premise that no one thinks like an adult
480920	486120	and everyone, especially Captain America, is behaving horribly out of character.
486120	490720	Once again, gulags for superhero who don't comply with the totalitarian whatever,
490720	493720	courtesy of an also-wildly-out-of-character Reed Richards,
493720	497520	only this time they're interdimensional space gulags.
497520	501920	Civil War ends when Captain America, after six issues of acting like a belligerent asshole
501920	503920	incapable of human reason, goes,
503920	505920	wait guys, this is stupid,
505920	507920	and turns himself in.
507920	510120	And then he's assassinated and it's like, what?
510120	514720	The upcoming movie appears to give Iron Man and Captain America more concrete motivations,
514720	518920	and honestly, any movie that they made could only be an improvement on the source material
518920	520720	as far as I am concerned.
520720	524120	As for Dawn of Justice, with so much comic history to draw on,
524120	529720	I'm sure Batman and Superman have a totally legit and not contrived reason for fighting each other.
529720	532520	And if we believe there's even a 1% chance that he is our enemy,
532520	535120	we have to take it as an absolute certainty.
537320	543520	Like Batman quoting Dick Cheney to justify his xenophobia and violence.
543520	546720	Well, points for originality, Zack Snyder.
546720	549720	You, uh, you always fail to disappoint.
549720	555320	We'll talk about that another time, after the movie comes out.
555320	560720	Anyway, thank you, of course, patrons for making this episode and this show possible,
560720	565320	and thank you to Louis Linkara-Love-Hogg for helping me with the DC stuff.
565320	566720	Thank you again for watching.
566720	568720	Patreon, Twitter...
571120	574520	Can you tell I didn't write out a concrete conclusion for this one?
575520	580520	See, I was supposed to end with a dig at Zack Snyder, and then I forgot to write in the thank yous.
580520	583520	Like and subscribe! I'm a professional.
