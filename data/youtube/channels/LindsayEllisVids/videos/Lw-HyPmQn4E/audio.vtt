00:00.000 --> 00:03.800
Prior to the Silver Age of comics and the rare event that superheroes ran into each other,

00:03.800 --> 00:06.960
odds were that, one, they probably have already heard of each other,

00:06.960 --> 00:11.560
and two, they would probably get along immediately because, you know, they're the good guys.

00:11.560 --> 00:13.200
It just makes sense.

00:13.200 --> 00:17.960
But then came the Fantastic Four, comic bookdom's favorite straight-laced family

00:17.960 --> 00:20.720
who apparently just feels the need to fight everyone they meet.

00:20.720 --> 00:25.800
And from then on, one of our proudest comic book traditions is superheroes fighting each other,

00:25.800 --> 00:27.920
usually for no good reason.

00:27.920 --> 00:34.520
I say no good reason because generally fights arise as the result of a misunderstanding and or manipulation,

00:34.520 --> 00:39.120
and could be avoided by the two fighting parties behaving like adults and talking things out

00:39.120 --> 00:43.120
rather than launching a full-blown assault on each other at the very first opportunity,

00:43.120 --> 00:46.520
only to realize later, hey, we were both the good guys.

00:46.520 --> 00:51.120
But, you know, readers wanted to see heroes fight, so who cares how contrived it got?

00:51.120 --> 00:55.920
So this list of superhero battles through the ages is not exhaustive

00:55.920 --> 00:59.920
because I would be low-balling it to say that in all of published comics,

00:59.920 --> 01:03.320
this has probably happened in the thousands of times.

01:03.320 --> 01:08.720
But here are some cherry-picked examples of the history of comic book superhero fights,

01:08.720 --> 01:11.520
and we're going to stick with the big two.

01:11.520 --> 01:12.720
Because reasons.

01:12.720 --> 01:16.920
Until Prince Namor the Submariner met and battled with the original Human Torch,

01:16.920 --> 01:21.920
the characters of Marvel Comics seemed to exist only in their own separate story universes.

01:21.920 --> 01:26.720
So this battle basically created the idea that there was a shared Marvel Universe.

01:26.720 --> 01:30.720
Namor is kind of an anti-hero in that his motivations are fairly pure.

01:30.720 --> 01:36.520
He wants to protect the oceans, but he also wants to destroy the United States to do so.

01:36.520 --> 01:40.320
So this one actually kind of falls on the less contrived end.

01:40.320 --> 01:45.720
But then came the Fantastic Four, and they set the trend for superhero meetups,

01:45.720 --> 01:47.920
at least for the foreseeable future.

01:47.920 --> 01:52.520
Either Party A has not heard of Party B, or Party A has heard of Party B,

01:52.520 --> 01:55.920
but only bad things like the X-Men are mutant terrorists,

01:55.920 --> 02:01.120
or Spider-Man has a bad rep because the editor of the New York Post really doesn't like him.

02:01.120 --> 02:04.120
The more straight-laced law-abiding group of the Marvel Universe,

02:04.120 --> 02:06.720
the Fantastic Four fought everybody.

02:06.720 --> 02:11.520
The Avengers, the Silver Surfer, the Hulk, I mean, no surprise there,

02:11.520 --> 02:13.120
and of course Spider-Man.

02:13.120 --> 02:16.120
He wanted to join the Fantastic Four because he figures,

02:16.120 --> 02:20.320
hey, everybody likes the Fantastic Four, and that might improve my image.

02:20.320 --> 02:23.120
He goes about this by picking a fight with them.

02:23.120 --> 02:25.520
In the end, his plan doesn't work, not because they were like,

02:25.520 --> 02:28.920
hey, that was a really stupid way to try to join our superhero group,

02:28.920 --> 02:31.920
but apparently because the Fantastic Four are a non-profit.

02:31.920 --> 02:36.520
Wolverine was introduced to the Marvel Universe by a battle, this time with the Hulk.

02:36.520 --> 02:40.720
But that one doesn't need much justification, as both the Hulk and Wolverine will fight anything,

02:40.720 --> 02:45.320
so putting these two together in the same Canada is basically asking for it.

02:45.320 --> 02:48.720
But when there weren't misunderstandings, there were manipulations.

02:48.720 --> 02:52.520
Thor battled the Silver Surfer because Loki.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.720
He convinced him that Thor was an evil god.

02:54.720 --> 03:00.120
Speaking of Loki, the Avengers basically formed after Loki tricked Thor into fighting the Hulk,

03:00.120 --> 03:05.520
after which everybody teamed up to turn on Loki and lo the Avengers.

03:05.520 --> 03:08.120
Until Hulk left an issue or two later.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.520
Superman even fought Spider-Man at one point

03:10.520 --> 03:13.720
because he mistakenly blamed Spider-Man for kidnapping Lois Lane.

03:13.720 --> 03:19.520
This was made more of an even match because Lex Luthor had fired red sun radiation at Spider-Man's suit.

03:19.520 --> 03:24.120
So, you know, Superman was a little wiltier than he normally was.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.320
Mind control was a popular one.

03:26.320 --> 03:30.520
Here's Namor again fighting the Fantastic Four, again under mind control.

03:30.520 --> 03:33.720
There's also another issue where Professor X, again under mind control,

03:33.720 --> 03:37.520
just up and tells the X-Men they need to go destroy the Fantastic Four for no reason,

03:37.520 --> 03:40.520
and the X-Men are like, okay, boss.

03:40.520 --> 03:44.920
The Justice League was manipulated into fighting the Avengers because...

03:44.920 --> 03:45.920
reasons.

03:45.920 --> 03:50.720
Of course, not all battles need to be misunderstandings or manipulations.

03:50.720 --> 03:54.920
Superman and the Flash battled via footrace to raise money for charity.

03:54.920 --> 03:59.920
In the end, the two tied because they decided that their charities were more important than their egos,

03:59.920 --> 04:01.720
and that's just adorable.

04:01.720 --> 04:04.920
But then came the 80s, and adorable's not allowed.

04:04.920 --> 04:06.320
It's gritty realism time.

04:06.320 --> 04:10.920
So, misunderstandings and manipulation from bad guys is not so satisfying anymore.

04:10.920 --> 04:15.320
The Spider-Man vs. Wolverine series was not really a knock-down-drag-out brawl,

04:15.320 --> 04:20.720
so much as Spider-Man edging in on Wolverine's turf and Wolverine telling him to back off, bub.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.120
The Fantastic Four also had a feud with the X-Men,

04:23.120 --> 04:26.520
so this time it was because Reed Richard wasn't helping them enough,

04:26.520 --> 04:29.720
in this case to save Kitty Pryde from disintegrating.

04:29.720 --> 04:33.520
This is also to say nothing of the countless inter-X-Men feuds,

04:33.520 --> 04:38.320
exacerbated by certain villains switching sides constantly, and vice versa.

04:38.320 --> 04:44.120
But the most well-known battle from this era is between Superman and Batman in The Dark Knight Returns.

04:44.120 --> 04:48.920
Frank Miller took the attitude that Batman and Superman could never really be friends with one another

04:48.920 --> 04:51.520
because their personalities are too at odds.

04:51.520 --> 04:55.520
Taking place in a dark, Watchmen-ish alternate future timeline,

04:55.520 --> 04:57.920
Superman has become more or less an agent of the government,

04:57.920 --> 05:03.520
and Batman, unwilling to abide by The Man, is forced into conflict with Superman.

05:03.520 --> 05:10.520
So if you're wondering why Batman's tech suit in Batman vs. Superman looks so chunky and silly, this is why.

05:10.520 --> 05:16.520
In the end, the two are pretty evenly matched, Superman with his strength and Batman with his cleverness and technology,

05:16.520 --> 05:19.720
but Batman ultimately has to fake his own death in order to win,

05:19.720 --> 05:22.720
or at least to get the government to stop looking his way.

05:22.720 --> 05:26.520
But let's not forget about Wonder Woman, who battles Batman in Hikiteia.

05:26.520 --> 05:31.920
Penned by Greg Rucka, this is the one with the famous Wonder Woman shoe holding down Batman's head.

05:31.920 --> 05:33.320
Hashtag misandry.

05:33.320 --> 05:36.120
In this one, Diana takes a vow to protect this girl,

05:36.120 --> 05:40.120
only to discover that her charge is a fugitive on the run from Batman,

05:40.120 --> 05:47.720
putting her at odds with him in this duty vs. justice story, and a terrible crisis for Diana's character.

05:47.720 --> 05:53.120
Speaking of crisis, Infinite Crisis was another draw for the Batman vs. Superman thing.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.120
This one followed Identity Crisis.

05:55.120 --> 06:00.320
During Identity Crisis, Batman walked in on something that Justice League did not want him to see,

06:00.320 --> 06:02.320
and he got his memory wiped.

06:02.320 --> 06:07.720
As Batman recovered his memory, he set up a massive satellite network to track all superhuman activity on the planet

06:07.720 --> 06:10.320
because he decided that superhumans cannot be trusted.

06:10.320 --> 06:14.720
Then this dude named Maxwell Lord co-ops Batman's technology to mind control Superman,

06:14.720 --> 06:17.320
and to try to get him to kill Batman.

06:17.320 --> 06:21.320
And only Wonder Woman killing this guy could stop Superman's rampage,

06:21.520 --> 06:26.120
which was big in-universe deal because she did it on live television.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.320
Oopsie-daisy.

06:27.320 --> 06:31.320
Speaking of the Justice League, they battle the Teen Titans in the Technus Imperative.

06:31.320 --> 06:35.720
Teen Titan Cyborg has decided he wants to steal the moon.

06:35.720 --> 06:38.520
For... reasons.

06:38.520 --> 06:42.920
The Justice League decide that the thing to do here is to destroy Cyborg in order to save the moon,

06:42.920 --> 06:44.920
but the Titans want to defend their friend.

06:44.920 --> 06:47.920
So, fight, fight, fight, but only sort of,

06:47.920 --> 06:52.720
because it turns out the Justice League are only doing their thing as a way to cause a distraction for Cyborg,

06:52.720 --> 06:55.520
and eventually the two teams team up and save the day.

06:55.520 --> 06:59.720
A later similar dark alternate future to The Dark Knight Returns is Kingdom Come.

06:59.720 --> 07:03.120
Gritty, violent, vigilante murder heroes are all the rage in this timeline

07:03.120 --> 07:06.120
until one of the murder heroes nukes half of Kansas.

07:06.120 --> 07:11.320
Superman and Wonder Woman have a disagreement with Batman on how to go about dealing with this problem,

07:11.320 --> 07:15.720
and before you know it, we have murder hero gulags and re-education camps

07:15.720 --> 07:20.920
and a big brawl between Superman's forces, Batman's forces, and the murder heroes.

07:20.920 --> 07:24.520
Eventually, world leaders have to be the adults here and step in and tell them to stop

07:24.520 --> 07:29.520
or we're going to turn this car around by nuking a majority of the superhero population.

07:29.520 --> 07:35.320
In the Marvel Universe, Civil War is pretty similar to Kingdom Come, minus the alternate timeline part.

07:35.320 --> 07:38.920
We discussed Civil War back in the Captain America episode.

07:38.920 --> 07:39.920
Eh.

07:39.920 --> 07:41.320
But here is a quick recap.

07:41.320 --> 07:46.520
After some D-list heroes nuke a school, a superhero registration act is introduced,

07:46.520 --> 07:49.520
championed by Iron Man, among many others,

07:49.520 --> 07:52.720
and opposed by Captain America, among many others.

07:52.720 --> 07:56.120
There are various and sundry tie-in comics that are not the worst thing ever,

07:56.120 --> 08:00.920
but the seven issues of Civil War are predicated on the premise that no one thinks like an adult

08:00.920 --> 08:06.120
and everyone, especially Captain America, is behaving horribly out of character.

08:06.120 --> 08:10.720
Once again, gulags for superhero who don't comply with the totalitarian whatever,

08:10.720 --> 08:13.720
courtesy of an also-wildly-out-of-character Reed Richards,

08:13.720 --> 08:17.520
only this time they're interdimensional space gulags.

08:17.520 --> 08:21.920
Civil War ends when Captain America, after six issues of acting like a belligerent asshole

08:21.920 --> 08:23.920
incapable of human reason, goes,

08:23.920 --> 08:25.920
wait guys, this is stupid,

08:25.920 --> 08:27.920
and turns himself in.

08:27.920 --> 08:30.120
And then he's assassinated and it's like, what?

08:30.120 --> 08:34.720
The upcoming movie appears to give Iron Man and Captain America more concrete motivations,

08:34.720 --> 08:38.920
and honestly, any movie that they made could only be an improvement on the source material

08:38.920 --> 08:40.720
as far as I am concerned.

08:40.720 --> 08:44.120
As for Dawn of Justice, with so much comic history to draw on,

08:44.120 --> 08:49.720
I'm sure Batman and Superman have a totally legit and not contrived reason for fighting each other.

08:49.720 --> 08:52.520
And if we believe there's even a 1% chance that he is our enemy,

08:52.520 --> 08:55.120
we have to take it as an absolute certainty.

08:57.320 --> 09:03.520
Like Batman quoting Dick Cheney to justify his xenophobia and violence.

09:03.520 --> 09:06.720
Well, points for originality, Zack Snyder.

09:06.720 --> 09:09.720
You, uh, you always fail to disappoint.

09:09.720 --> 09:15.320
We'll talk about that another time, after the movie comes out.

09:15.320 --> 09:20.720
Anyway, thank you, of course, patrons for making this episode and this show possible,

09:20.720 --> 09:25.320
and thank you to Louis Linkara-Love-Hogg for helping me with the DC stuff.

09:25.320 --> 09:26.720
Thank you again for watching.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.720
Patreon, Twitter...

09:31.120 --> 09:34.520
Can you tell I didn't write out a concrete conclusion for this one?

09:35.520 --> 09:40.520
See, I was supposed to end with a dig at Zack Snyder, and then I forgot to write in the thank yous.

09:40.520 --> 09:43.520
Like and subscribe! I'm a professional.
