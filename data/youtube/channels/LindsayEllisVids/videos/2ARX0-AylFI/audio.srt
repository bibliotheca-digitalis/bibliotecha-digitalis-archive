1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So, I have a pitch for a movie.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It's about this young girl, and she's the daughter of the tribal chief of a group of indigenous people living in pre-colonial times.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And she's about to come of age, and her dad is like,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Time to come of age, honey. You need to do the thing and take your place in the leaderarchy.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It suits you.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And she's like, Eh, I'm not too keen on your particular vision for me, Dad.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
She likes water. It's like a metaphor for freedom, and she's like,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Hey water, is there something more for me out there?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And then she sings a song about the water.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
She has this grandmother character who's special because she's got a spiritual insight that nobody else in the tribe has,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and she's like, Hey, maybe your dad is being too restrictive.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Maybe there is something more out there for you.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But then a conflict comes from over the sea, and Grandma's like,

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, you know what? Hey, maybe that's your destiny, and you need to go meet it.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And our heroine is like, Okay, yeah, that sounds legit.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Turns out she has this treasure-obsessed antagonist who's really obsessed with being shiny.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So she gets in a boat and goes out to meet her destiny.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And after some trials and tribulations and hanging out with some guy who is pretty disrespectful to her TBH,

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
she kind of f***s up by way of overestimating her own abilities

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and nearly gets the guy she's palling around with killed.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And then she's like, You know what? Maybe I can't do it.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Maybe I can't fix the conflict.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And so she's kind of sad, and she talks to her spirit grandma like,

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I have no idea what I'm doing, and spirit grandma's like, No, honey, you got this.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And she realizes what her destiny is, and ultimately our heroine saves the day,

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
not through violence or might, but with her compassion.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And then her dad was like, Oh, okay, honey, I guess you were right.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And then she takes her place in the leaderarchy and helps her people into a new era of hope.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The end.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's not been done before, has it?

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon?

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The 90s was a weird time for representation of Native American people.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
There's a documentary on Netflix called Real Engine you should check out for a better overview.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I am greeted with open smiles and looks of appreciation.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
In short, I have become a celebrity.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We'd be here all day if we did even a brief overview of all the media trends leading up to that.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But suffice to say that by the 90s, the trend was sympathetic to the Native American plight.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But also, you know, white Americans don't want to feel like the bad guy,

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
which is why almost all of the 90s crop of movies that involved Native Americans had good white protagonists,

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
helping the natives out against the bad white people who are greedy and bad and like money,

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
not like the good white people who just want to be free and live one with the nature and the spirits of the nature,

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
and like, hey, maybe we're not so different.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
That brief resurgence of the Western in the 90s was a reflection on America's changing understanding of its own history.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:05,000
White America was in a process of coming to terms with its relationship to the people who were here, you know, first.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Enter Pocahontas, which effectively ended that 90s era of why can't we just all get along colonialist Hollywood narratives.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Oh, there continued to be smatterings of that kind of movie here and there in the years that followed,

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
but by the time Pocahontas came out, people were kind of sick of it.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
My bark is worse than my bite.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Disney was expecting Pocahontas to be the smash hit that would break through the glass ceiling cracked by Beauty and the Beast.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That Best Picture Oscar glass ceiling, because Best Animated Picture was not a thing yet.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Inside of the Disney studio, the faith the filmmakers had in Pocahontas caused minor chaos,

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
with animators begging to jump ship off of The Lion King in favor of Pocahontas,

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
which was widely considered within the studio to be the superior of the two.

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The more legit and artistic, see?

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg, who were CEO and studio head respectively at the time,

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
were somewhat surprised that the reaction to the film was mostly indifference, disappointment,

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
and harsh criticism from Native American groups who were annoyed at basically every aspect of the film.

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And it's easy to see where that criticism comes from.

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Pocahontas is basically peak 90s neoliberalism.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It has all of the required merchandisable Disney things.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Cool!

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
She's beautiful!

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
She's so tall!

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And her hair's so long!

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We've aged up the historical figure into a sexy Barbie doll, middle-aged pudge man John Smith.

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
John Smith!

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Has been chiseled into a golden-haired Adonis, voiced by Mel Gibson,

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and it plays into basically every Native American stereotype that even by the 90s had reached parody levels.

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
This movie is so parodic in levels of Disney-ness,

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm surprised Miko didn't have, like, a cute snarky one-liner that they then printed on millions of shirts

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
that went on to fill millions of cubic landfill feet.

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The subject of the Disney company and its portrayal of indigenous peoples in service of the Disney brand is massive,

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
so I'm going to have to omit a lot of stuff in the service of streamlining this thing,

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
so I apologize for that.

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm going to have to leave a lot of stuff out.

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I should probably also mention that talking about issues of indigenous people as an American is somewhat fraught,

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
because Americans are kind of obsessed with this idea of blood quantums,

78
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
especially since that is actually how a lot of tribes determine tribal membership.

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And a lot of white people have this tendency to claim some obscure Native American ancestry like it makes them an expert,

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
or it makes whatever they say or do regarding Native American representation totes okay.

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I can remember my grandparents, you know, talking about how we had some degree of Indian blood,

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and it was, to me, a point of pride.

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You don't even know what tribe you're supposed to be descended from!

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm not trying to qualify anything I say, except as a student of media studies.

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I am just one well-meaning idiot trying to contextualize Disney's portrayal of indigenous people

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and how that has changed over the years.

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Eisner and Katzenberg thought they were ushering in a new era of artistic credibility.

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Instead, the film feels more like a mistake.

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But now in the era of Moana, much as I still think Pocahontas, well, sucks,

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I've never been popular.

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I like you.

92
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
my feelings on the film and its place in the discourse have softened a bit.

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Pocahontas was, in many ways, a mistake, in the same way that Song of the South was a mistake.

94
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I think history will only look more and more unkindly upon Disney's Pocahontas.

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But a mistake need not necessarily be a bad thing.

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
As a wise megamind once said,

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
If there's a benefit to losing, you get to learn from your mistakes.

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So the question is, with this little stealth remake they've done with Moana,

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
has Disney learned from the mistakes of Pocahontas?

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Here at the studio, we have many artists who achieved national reputation as painters

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
in addition to their accomplishments in the field of animation.

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
These men know the value of Henry's advice to be yourself.

103
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
In 1962, during a screening in his home in the hills of Los Feliz,

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Walt Disney watched Robert Mulligan's To Kill a Mockingbird starring Gregory Peck.

105
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
In the name of God, do your duty.

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
After the film was over, Disney lamented to his family,

107
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That's the kind of film I wish I could make.

108
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Disney had so successfully solidified his brand

109
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
that he had branded himself right into a corner with fun, light-hearted family fare.

110
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And because of that, he could not make the kinds of movies

111
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
that were revolutionizing the film industry.

112
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Disney was experiencing a creative stimming, at least on the movie side of things,

113
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
that would follow him until his death a few years later.

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The Walt Disney Studio is the only major movie studio

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
that has a specific brand attached to the sort of movies it puts out.

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And with that brand is a certain set of expectations.

117
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
This problem was especially obvious with several of the renaissance-era Disney movies.

118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
There was a desire to expand and tell more complex narratives,

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
but the studio was still really constrained by that Disney brand.

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The Hunchback of Notre Dame is the best example of this.

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Like fire, hellfire.

122
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And as I ring these bells tonight,

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
God have mercy on me.

124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm losing to a bird!

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Stay true, Eddie!

126
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Pour the wine and cut the cheese.

127
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But Pocahontas is up there, too.

128
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Here's what you get when races are diverse.

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
They're not like you and me, which means they must be evil.

130
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The filmmakers originally envisioned a more, shall we say, historically rooted film.

131
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But the studio head Jeffrey Katzenberg pushed it to what he considered to be more commercial.

132
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Pocahontas was originally closer in age to the historical Pocahontas.

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It was even kicked around for a while that the Powhatan characters, yes, would speak entirely in native Powhatan,

134
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and Pocahontas would have to go through the process of learning English.

135
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Malick-style, baby.

136
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But in the end, most of the decisions that dragged the movie down into mediocrity

137
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
were born out of Katzenberg's desire to force a best picture contender like Beauty and the Beast.

138
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Pocahontas was aged up, and it was turned into a Romeo and Juliet-inspired love story

139
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
with the language barrier being transversed via listening with one's heart.

140
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Then there's Pocahontas's design, a trope as old as the hills.

141
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
By the time Pocahontas came out, the only other Disney princess arguably as sexualized as Pocahontas was Princess Jasmine.

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And the year after that, Esmeralda.

143
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Look at that disgusting display.

144
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yes, sir.

145
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Funny that.

146
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Well, what do you do?

147
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
According to an interview with Glen Keane from 1995,

148
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
we are doing a mature love story here, and we have to draw her as such.

149
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
She has to be sexy.

150
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
This is a Disney version.

151
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
This is not a documentary.

152
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
This may seem harmless,

153
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
but these media trends mirror very real problems in the real world to this day.

154
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Even now, Native American women are twice the national average in reported rapes and sexual assault.

155
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And those are just the ones that get reported.

156
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Media trends of sexualizing indigenous women do not exist in a bubble.

157
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But the worst hangover I get from Pocahontas is how it reinforces this comfortable lie

158
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
that white Americans are fed from birth.

159
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That things were a little tense at first,

160
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
but ultimately the whites and the natives got along and everything was fine.

161
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Like, seriously, the movie both sides-es the whole issue.

162
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yeah, the English had guns and smallpox,

163
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
and decades of driving the natives off their lands,

164
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
but the Powhatans were jerks too, you guys.

165
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Killers at the core.

166
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
They're different from us,

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
which means they can't be trusted.

168
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

169
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The Indians calling the Europeans savages?

170
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Mind blown.

171
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The studio purported a desire to honor Native Americans,

172
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
and I'm sure there is some truth to that.

173
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
But at the end of the day,

174
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
the film just kind of reinforces this myth of the founding of the country

175
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
that we are force-fed from birth,

176
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
like a goose being fed for pate.

177
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But not everyone reads it like that.

178
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
According to Russell Means,

179
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
This film is the finest feature film ever done

180
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
about American Indians in the history of Hollywood.

181
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's so revolutionary.

182
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It shocked me when they showed it to me.

183
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The first thing that shocked me was the truth.

184
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The Eurocentric males are admitting why they came here,

185
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
to kill Indians and to rob and pillage.

186
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That's never been done before.

187
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
This is also the first time, other than on Northern Exposure,

188
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
that a human face has been put on an Indian female.

189
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Here is this young woman who is wiser than her father or any man in the village,

190
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
and she causes peace to reign.

191
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's beautiful.

192
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Without going too deeply into it,

193
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
let's just say that Russell Means is somewhat controversial

194
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
in the activism world.

195
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Russell Means was the actor who played Pocahontas' father in the film.

196
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
He was also a Lakota Sioux activist for Native American rights

197
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
and a leader of the American Indian movement in the 1970s,

198
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
helping to organize the standoff at Wounded Knee in 1973.

199
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
According to the LA Times,

200
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Russell Means brought instant legitimacy and authenticity to Pocahontas.

201
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I haven't abandoned the movement for Hollywood, said Means.

202
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I've just added Hollywood to the movement.

203
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The entertainment world is a powerful venue for revolution,

204
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
particularly now that there are 500 channels on the horizon

205
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and the global market is so big.

206
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Many of Means' former activist colleagues

207
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
did not agree with his interpretation on the media,

208
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
or that he was helping to champion the causes he purported to champion

209
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
by the media he was participating in.

210
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But my point here is that the legacy of Pocahontas

211
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
is more complicated than thing good or thing bad.

212
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So.

213
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Cultural appropriation!

214
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
R.I.P. comment section.

215
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'd like to take it back a few dozen steps

216
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
and talk about some of these theoretical terms

217
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
that have become politically loaded over the last few years,

218
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
particularly cultural appropriation.

219
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
As a theoretical term, cultural appropriation is neither bad nor good.

220
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It just describes a sociological phenomenon.

221
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It may have deleterious or positive effects on certain groups,

222
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
but the term itself is neutral.

223
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Cultural appropriation is the adoption or use

224
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
of elements of one culture by members of another culture.

225
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That's all it is.

226
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
That's what I mean when I say cultural appropriation is a neutral term.

227
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
For instance, the fact that I wear a clodder ring.

228
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
This is a form of cultural appropriation.

229
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm not Irish.

230
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I studied Irish when I was in college.

231
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I actually have a minor in Irish studies.

232
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But I don't know if I have any Irish ancestry.

233
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I might. I might not.

234
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
If I do, it's so far back in the ancestry line

235
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
as to be completely irrelevant.

236
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So this is actually a form of cultural appropriation.

237
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
If you happen to be American

238
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
and want a more subjective understanding

239
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
of what cultural appropriation in movies even is,

240
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
one of my favorite examples is from a 2003 Bollywood movie

241
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
called Galhónahó.

242
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
This movie takes place in New York.

243
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
This was filmed in Toronto.

244
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And, yeah, this is a form of cultural appropriation.

245
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I like to use this example because unless you're super into anime,

246
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
most Americans have an experienced media

247
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
as American culture on the other end of cultural appropriation.

248
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Americans are so used to being the dominant producers of media

249
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
that we aren't accustomed to seeing what it's like

250
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
to be portrayed by a culture that does not care

251
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
if their product sells in American markets.

252
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
The fact that cultural appropriation is, in theory,

253
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
a neutral term leads to a lot of false equivalencies,

254
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
i.e., why is this form of cultural appropriation okay,

255
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
but Gwen Stefani dressing as a sexy warrior is not okay?

256
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Well, it's a complex issue,

257
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
and there is a lot of intersection over race and class and gender,

258
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
but here is a general rule of thumb.

259
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
If it is a culture that was historically exploited by colonialism

260
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
appropriating a historically colonizing culture,

261
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
no harm, no foul.

262
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
No one gets mad at Mexico for appropriating elements of German culture.

263
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Unless you happen to live in LA and that's all that's on the radio.

264
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
If it is a historically colonialist culture

265
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
appropriating a culture that was exploited by colonialism,

266
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
then people start to get a little cranky.

267
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Obviously, there are intersections and complexities,

268
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
but for simplicity's sake, I'll leave it there for now.

269
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But I think most people would agree that,

270
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
unlike something like Pocahontas or even Slumdog Millionaire,

271
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
a movie which pretty much every Indian I've ever talked to is not a fan of,

272
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
this kind of cultural appropriation is basically harmless.

273
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
This is what I mean by cultural appropriation being a neutral term.

274
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Not all cultural appropriation is created equal.

275
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So I think the real question people want the answer to

276
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
is where the line is between positive examples of representation

277
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
and harmful cultural appropriation.

278
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And that's the problem.

279
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
There isn't really a line.

280
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So you can have a movie like Moana,

281
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
which had a much higher proportion of Pacific Islanders

282
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
working behind the scenes and in the cast

283
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
than American Natives did for Pocahontas.

284
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But the film still reads as appropriative to some

285
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
because the story is still cookie-cutter Disney.

286
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What is wrong with me?

287
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And the department heads were overwhelmingly old white men.

288
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
As long as you have a multinational corporation

289
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
appropriating some element of another culture to sell stuff,

290
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
no matter how respectful or well-researched,

291
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
there is always going to be some level of appropriation.

292
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
So with regard to the lesson Disney took from the backlash against Pocahontas,

293
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
you would think that the lesson Disney would have taken

294
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
with regard to depicting indigenous peoples is

295
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
DON'T.

296
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But it wasn't.

297
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
We've had four more Disney features with indigenous protagonists since Pocahontas,

298
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
two of which involved said protagonists turning into large mammals

299
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
in order to learn a lesson.

300
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm not going to get into that.

301
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm just saying.

302
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It happened.

303
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Twice.

304
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Shh.

305
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I don't speak bear.

306
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
First was The Emperor's New Groove,

307
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
which was in development hell for years

308
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and was originally a large, very important portentous musical

309
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
in the vein of Pocahontas called Kingdom of the Sun.

310
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But then that vision got scrapped,

311
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
most of the creative team got replaced,

312
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
and the film turned into a buddy comedy

313
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
with barely a veneer of the original setting slapped on top.

314
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Butler.

315
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Chef.

316
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Theme song guy.

317
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The Emperor's New Groove has almost no relation to the culture it takes place in

318
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
other than llama being the one domesticated animal down there

319
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
and sometimes the topography.

320
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The Emperor's New Groove is so thoroughly divorced from the culture it takes place in

321
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
that the appropriation discussion rarely even pops up in relation to this movie.

322
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Brother Bear, the other movie where the arrogant protagonist

323
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
gets turned into a large mammal to learn a lesson,

324
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
has more to do with the culture it is appropriating than either Emperor's New Groove

325
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
or even Pocahontas for that matter,

326
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
taking the concept of spirit animal to a very literal literalness.

327
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But the thing that fascinates me about Brother Bear in this context

328
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
is less how it appropriates culture in its story

329
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
with the idea of the spirit animal turning Joaquin Phoenix into a literal animal,

330
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
but with the way it mixes native language with a European style of music.

331
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
YouTuber Sideways did a great video essay entitled How Disney Uses Language.

332
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
This essay has a little segment about Brother Bear

333
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
and its use of Inupiat language with Bulgarian women's choir music

334
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
because it sounds vaguely, you know, ethnic.

335
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
So they used music that most people hadn't heard of

336
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
that had nothing to do with the context of the film

337
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
in order to make the scene sound, I don't know, more magical?

338
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Point here being that Brother Bear kind of took a step back

339
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
and got away with it because most people couldn't tell the difference

340
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
between a Bulgarian women's choir and Inupiat music.

341
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Both are presumed to sound equally alien.

342
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
So even though Brother Bear uses Bulgarian music to try and convey an Alaskan sound,

343
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
which, alright, they were actually on the right track by using the native language.

344
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Part of the reason Brother Bear was a huge step back

345
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
is because there was a lot of chaos going on at the Disney company at the time

346
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
with Roy Disney basically staging a coup against Michael Eisner from the outside of the company.

347
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So the result was that the last few gasps of traditional animation in the mid-2000s

348
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
were just kind of lazy and careless.

349
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
But if we really want to take a look at the way Disney portrays indigenous people,

350
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
especially indigenous women, the real shift isn't Moana.

351
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's Nani from 2002's Lilo and Stitch.

352
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Hey! Which way are you going?

353
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Pocahontas is hyper-sexualized.

354
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
She moves animalistically, falls in love with the first white guy she sees,

355
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
talks to the animals and communes with the spirits of things like rocks and trees.

356
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Nani is a complete departure from that.

357
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
She isn't sexually available to white men.

358
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
She's not even sexually available at all, not really.

359
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
She has one guy who's interested in her,

360
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
but she can't return that interest because she doesn't have that luxury

361
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
because she has to take care of her sister.

362
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You're not doing anything.

363
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
David, I told you, I can't.

364
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I...

365
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I got a lot to deal with right now.

366
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
The most exoticized thing that Nani wears is for when she's working for a literal tourist trap.

367
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
But Nani is not divorced from her culture either.

368
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
In one of the most emotionally powerful moments in the film,

369
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
the night before Lilo is set to be taken away from Nani by social services,

370
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Nani sings to her Aloha Oe.

371
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Aloha Oe

372
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Aloha Oe

373
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Aloha Oe was written by Queen Lili'uokalani,

374
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
the last monarch of the Kingdom of Hawaii.

375
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It translates to farewell to thee and became a symbol for lost country

376
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
after the forced annexation of Hawaii into the United States.

377
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And this isn't the only reference to Lili'uokalani in the film.

378
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
The song at the opening invokes her as well, in the Hawaiian language.

379
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Aloha Oe

380
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's super subtle for Disney,

381
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
but there is a deliberateness here to tie in the characters' personal struggles with their heritage.

382
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So in the later scene, when Nani is singing Aloha Oe to Lilo,

383
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Nani is using one of the most iconic cultural songs of Hawaii

384
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
to symbolize what is literally about to happen to her.

385
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Her family is about to be ripped apart by a literal agent of the United States government.

386
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
In case you're wondering, this did not go well.

387
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
This is an issue that directly affects indigenous peoples, especially in the United States.

388
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
We, like most countries, have a long, proud history of tearing indigenous families apart.

389
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
That the film uses Aloha Oe,

390
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
a song that has become a symbol of the forced annexation of Hawaii into the United States,

391
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
about her own pain over her family being ripped apart,

392
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
that's almost radical for a Disney movie.

393
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And, yeah, it's also some level of appropriation.

394
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It might be a powerful moment and was mostly positively received, but it's still Disney.

395
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
See, that's what I mean by there isn't really a line.

396
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's a complex topic.

397
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Lilo and Stitch had a deleted scene that confronted the racism of the white tourists head-on.

398
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Hey, speak English? Which way to the beach?

399
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm kind of bummed they cut this out for a lot of reasons.

400
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It would have helped the movie from a story standpoint,

401
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
as this deleted scene is the moment where Stitch decides, hey, maybe this kid's all right.

402
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It also points to Lilo's feelings as an outsider being more than just her being a weirdo.

403
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
She is a tourist commodity in her own country.

404
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Oh, look, a real native!

405
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Lilo and Stitch begins to scratch the surface of Hawaii's poverty, job market,

406
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
and its dependence on mainland tourists.

407
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
But, you know, not really, dawg, because it's still a Disney movie,

408
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
which is why I think they cut that scene out.

409
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Tourists, prepare to die!

410
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
So the big lesson learned from Pocahontas wasn't don't make narratives about indigenous peoples,

411
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
but rather don't make these narratives about the characters' relationships to white people.

412
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
With The Emperor's New Groove, Brother Bear, and Moana,

413
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
this is accomplished by simply setting the story in the pre-Columbian era,

414
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
with Lilo and Stitch in the modern era, but with no white characters except for the tourists.

415
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I wish Disney had internalized this lesson with The Princess and the Frog,

416
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
which goes so far out of its way to portray the wealthy white family as nice and well-meaning,

417
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
and what systemic oppression?

418
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
What, Jim Crow? I'm just a nice, wealthy white patrician here for some beignets

419
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
from my favorite black-owned establishment on the other side of the tracks.

420
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Anyway, and then came Moana.

421
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Now who's up next?

422
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Uh-oh.

423
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Uh-oh, it's Moana!

424
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
As I may have alluded to earlier, Moana has a very great deal in common with Pocahontas,

425
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
both narratively and in concept.

426
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So because of that, there was a lot of cringe in anticipation of the film.

427
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,000
This cringe was upgraded to cringe upon the announcement of a little brown-faced,

428
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,000
brown-bodied costume for kids of Maui's body and tats, which, yikes.

429
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Yeah, well, they pulled that, but yeah.

430
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Disney, what were you thinking?

431
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
At the end of the day, Disney gonna Disney.

432
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Even before Moana came out, I was like,

433
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
oh boy, The Rock sure looks fun and love that Lin-Manuel Miranda,

434
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
and I can't wait to book my Disney vacation so I can stay at Disney's Polynesian Resort.

435
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I'd also be really curious to see if this movie would have even been greenlit

436
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
if Disney hadn't just bought its own private chunk of Hawaii.

437
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Hey, check it out, it's the star of Moana promoting Disney's new Hawaii chunk.

438
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
What are your impressions about this beautiful resort,

439
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Aulania Disney Resort and Spa?

440
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Love it here. It's absolutely beautiful.

441
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Vertical integration.

442
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
At the end of the day, Moana is another cog in the vertically integrated Disney machine.

443
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
As such, it's only willing to go so far with regard to authenticity.

444
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Instead of focusing on a Polynesian culture, Moana is more of a mush of all of them,

445
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
which kind of reminds me of Mulan, which took place in China,

446
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
but aesthetically picked and chose a lot of elements from all over Asia.

447
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Korea, Japan, the gang's all here.

448
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Moana also avoids the sexually available, submissive Polynesian woman stereotype,

449
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
but it still plays the happy natives with coconuts trope.

450
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Consider the coconut!

451
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Disney hired what they called an Oceanic Brain Trust,

452
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
a collection of scholars and activists from all over the Pacific,

453
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
to help with accuracy and sensitivity issues.

454
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
But as Tina Ngata points out, having brown advisors doesn't make it a brown story.

455
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It's still very much a white person's story.

456
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
No matter how much the story draws from the culture it's trying to portray,

457
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
at the end of the day it's still a very narrow Disney coming-of-age story.

458
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Vicente M. Diaz wrote in Indian Country Today before the movie came out,

459
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
any altruism associated with this latest commercial adventure

460
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
will always be trumped by the proverbial bottom line,

461
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
but more depressingly, by an enduring colonial legacy in the Pacific Islands

462
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
that is further animated in the 21st century by neoliberal and post-colonial desires

463
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
for selling and consuming native culture of a very specific type.

464
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And this is why the line between representation and cultural appropriation,

465
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
especially in animated movies, can be so blurry.

466
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
The legacy of colonialism is baked into every facet of every culture on the planet.

467
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Colonialism has had an incalculable impact on human civilization.

468
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
That is why it's so difficult to parse out exactly the impact of

469
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Group A being portrayed by dominant cultural Group B

470
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
in Disney movies.

471
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
But that's why we're here.

472
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
We're gonna fix colonialism, y'all.

473
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Turn down the volume!

474
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Filmmaker Taika Waititi, a native of New Zealand of Maori descent,

475
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
wrote the first draft of Moana before leaving the project.

476
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Although little of Waititi's script, which focused way more on gender

477
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
and on Moana's struggle in being in a family full of boys, remained in the film.

478
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
His departure from the project seemed amicable.

479
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
He's on good enough terms with Disney to be directing this fall's Thor Ragnarok.

480
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Waititi said after the movie came out,

481
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Indigenous people in films, it's like all nose flutes and panpipes

482
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
and, you know, people talking to ghosts, which I hate.

483
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I thought, well, the best way of them not making something that's insensitive or shallow

484
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
was to involve people from that community, from the Pacific.

485
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
If there's some way I could be at the table and help try and make this not a bad film,

486
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
then I'll try.

487
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Waititi left Moana to go make What We Do in the Shadows with Jemaine Clement,

488
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
who, incidentally, stars in Moana as Ta Matoa.

489
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And if you haven't seen that movie, you should. It's cute.

490
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Just leave me to do my dark bidding on the internet.

491
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
What are you bidding on?

492
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I'm bidding on the table.

493
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
But here's the thing that I think really separates Moana from Pocahontas,

494
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
and The Emperor's New Groove, for that matter.

495
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
The plot derives from lessons Moana learns about her own culture.

496
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Moana's personal journey only really kicks in when she finds out that

497
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
she is descended from a long line of voyagers.

498
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
We are descended from voyagers

499
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Who found their way across the world

500
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And they call me

501
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And that's the thing that sticks with me, racial stereotyping aside,

502
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
is that ultimately the story isn't just about a young girl finding herself,

503
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
but discovering that her ancestors did incredible things,

504
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
and her joy at discovering that.

505
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
We were voyagers.

506
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Is anyone going to say that we should sacrifice some little girl in New Zealand

507
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
or Los Angeles or Hawaii seeing a well-rounded character who looks like her

508
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
just because it's Disney and therefore appropriative?

509
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
No. That's why there's a push for ethical cultural representation.

510
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And a lot of this stuff is subjective.

511
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
That is why there can never be a pure representation,

512
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
especially in a globalist media economy.

513
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
An increasingly diverse consumer base wants to see characters

514
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
who look like them portrayed on screen.

515
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Disney gets that it's just good business to try to be authentic

516
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
to the communities they are portraying.

517
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
But they should hire more people from those communities, I'm just saying.

518
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
But the one article I found the most interesting was Doug Herman

519
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
writing for Smithsonian Magazine,

520
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
and that article was about his ambivalence on the film.

521
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
He liked that it got some stuff right,

522
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
but it also still plays into racial stereotyping.

523
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
He felt ambivalent about it, frustrated even.

524
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And this frustration kind of gives me some hope

525
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
because I feel like we're making progress from the days of Pocahontas.

526
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
It's no longer a hot mess, but a mixed bag.

527
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
When you use a bird to write with, it's called tweeting.

528
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And that may always be the case,

529
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
because, let me say it again for the people in the back,

530
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
the legacy of colonialism is baked into every facet of every culture on the planet.

531
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
So yeah, Disney's not about to challenge your ideas on American history.

532
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
They've got theme park tickets to sell.

533
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Come down onto Epcot Center and enjoy the American experience.

534
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Or you fans of Pocahontas can march on down to the world of Pandora,

535
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
which is a thing now.

536
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Ugh.

537
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Again, especially with a multinational hydra like Disney,

538
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
progress isn't always linear.

539
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
At the end of the day, the financial bottom line

540
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
will always be the most important thing for a company like Disney.

541
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
But there is money to be made in authenticity,

542
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
and I think Disney is edging closer to that

543
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
than, for instance, the days of The Enchanted Tiki Room.

544
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
There's this one scene that's there towards the end of both films

545
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
where our heroine gets a pep talk from Spirit Grandma

546
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
that I feel speaks to the evolution,

547
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
not just of the cultural angle, but of the ethical storytelling of Disney movies.

548
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
In both films, our heroine is feeling down and out,

549
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
and she's ready to give up.

550
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Here's what Spirit Grandma says in Pocahontas.

551
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
You have to stop them.

552
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I can't.

553
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Child, remember your dream.

554
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I was wrong, Grandmother Willow.

555
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
And here's what Spirit Grandma says in Moana.

556
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
It's not your fault.

557
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I never should have put so much on your shoulders.

558
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
If you are ready to go home,

559
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I will be with you.

560
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
This is such a tiny difference, but it is so telling to me

561
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
because it tells me that the filmmakers were thinking about

562
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
what children would take from the exchange with Moana.

563
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
In Pocahontas, Spirit Grandma tells her that she's obligated

564
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
to fix the mess that other people made.

565
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
But in Moana, Spirit Grandma concedes that it wasn't fair

566
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
for her to put that responsibility on a literal child.

567
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And rather than pushing Moana to fulfill her destiny,

568
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
she reassures her that her family loves and supports her

569
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
no matter what she decides.

570
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
She loves the sea and her people.

571
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
She makes her whole family proud.

572
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
This is indicative of how taking into consideration

573
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
the feelings of your audience,

574
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
in this case of children,

575
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
can actually help make the story stronger.

576
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Moana's moment is stronger than Pocahontas'

577
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
because it is motivated by her character growth.

578
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Where in Pocahontas, it's her remembering this dream

579
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
she had at the beginning.

580
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It's the arrow from your dream.

581
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I was right.

582
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
For Moana, it comes not from Compus Ex Machina,

583
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
but from a place of love and support,

584
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
creating a much more iconic moment than Pocahontas ever got.

585
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Harry, you're here in my heart.

586
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
You remind me.

587
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And I don't think this would have happened

588
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
if the filmmakers hadn't looked at the scene in Pocahontas

589
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
and thought,

590
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
wait, this has already been done.

591
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And it was kind of weak the first time.

592
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
We can do better.

593
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I am Moana!

594
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Moana is far from perfect,

595
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
but I think the ambivalence of the criticism it received

596
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
is telling.

597
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It tells us that Disney, and by extension all of us,

598
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
has a long way to go,

599
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
but that Disney has learned some from the mistakes of its past.

600
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
The best advice I have ever given to students

601
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
who have studied under me has been just this.

602
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Educate yourself.

603
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Here! Educate yourself!

604
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
What you love most about cinema

605
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
would get you called a movie snob.

606
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
The language can be subtle and poetic,

607
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
but not all people care about that,

608
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
like Mary Alice or Jim Bob.

609
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
To be safe, we use a visual dialectic.

610
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Water is the metaphor.

611
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Water is the metaphor.

612
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I'm pure and free.

613
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Water is the metaphor.

614
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I'm like the sea.

615
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I'm wild and I'm deep.

616
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I've got a spree

617
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
swimming through my guts and gore.

618
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Water is the metaphor

619
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
for me.

620
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
That describes me.
