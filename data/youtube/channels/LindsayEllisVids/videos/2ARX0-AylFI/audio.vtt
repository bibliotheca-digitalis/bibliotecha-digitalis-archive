WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
So, I have a pitch for a movie.

00:02.000 --> 00:09.000
It's about this young girl, and she's the daughter of the tribal chief of a group of indigenous people living in pre-colonial times.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
And she's about to come of age, and her dad is like,

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
Time to come of age, honey. You need to do the thing and take your place in the leaderarchy.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
It suits you.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
And she's like, Eh, I'm not too keen on your particular vision for me, Dad.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
She likes water. It's like a metaphor for freedom, and she's like,

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
Hey water, is there something more for me out there?

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
And then she sings a song about the water.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
She has this grandmother character who's special because she's got a spiritual insight that nobody else in the tribe has,

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
and she's like, Hey, maybe your dad is being too restrictive.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Maybe there is something more out there for you.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
But then a conflict comes from over the sea, and Grandma's like,

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Well, you know what? Hey, maybe that's your destiny, and you need to go meet it.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
And our heroine is like, Okay, yeah, that sounds legit.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
Turns out she has this treasure-obsessed antagonist who's really obsessed with being shiny.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
So she gets in a boat and goes out to meet her destiny.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
And after some trials and tribulations and hanging out with some guy who is pretty disrespectful to her TBH,

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
she kind of f***s up by way of overestimating her own abilities

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
and nearly gets the guy she's palling around with killed.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
And then she's like, You know what? Maybe I can't do it.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Maybe I can't fix the conflict.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
And so she's kind of sad, and she talks to her spirit grandma like,

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
I have no idea what I'm doing, and spirit grandma's like, No, honey, you got this.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
And she realizes what her destiny is, and ultimately our heroine saves the day,

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
not through violence or might, but with her compassion.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
And then her dad was like, Oh, okay, honey, I guess you were right.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
And then she takes her place in the leaderarchy and helps her people into a new era of hope.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
The end.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
That's not been done before, has it?

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon?

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
The 90s was a weird time for representation of Native American people.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
There's a documentary on Netflix called Real Engine you should check out for a better overview.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
I am greeted with open smiles and looks of appreciation.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
In short, I have become a celebrity.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
We'd be here all day if we did even a brief overview of all the media trends leading up to that.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
But suffice to say that by the 90s, the trend was sympathetic to the Native American plight.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
But also, you know, white Americans don't want to feel like the bad guy,

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
which is why almost all of the 90s crop of movies that involved Native Americans had good white protagonists,

02:31.000 --> 02:38.000
helping the natives out against the bad white people who are greedy and bad and like money,

02:38.000 --> 02:44.000
not like the good white people who just want to be free and live one with the nature and the spirits of the nature,

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
and like, hey, maybe we're not so different.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
That brief resurgence of the Western in the 90s was a reflection on America's changing understanding of its own history.

02:55.000 --> 03:05.000
White America was in a process of coming to terms with its relationship to the people who were here, you know, first.

03:05.000 --> 03:12.000
Enter Pocahontas, which effectively ended that 90s era of why can't we just all get along colonialist Hollywood narratives.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
Oh, there continued to be smatterings of that kind of movie here and there in the years that followed,

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
but by the time Pocahontas came out, people were kind of sick of it.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
My bark is worse than my bite.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
Disney was expecting Pocahontas to be the smash hit that would break through the glass ceiling cracked by Beauty and the Beast.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
That Best Picture Oscar glass ceiling, because Best Animated Picture was not a thing yet.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
Inside of the Disney studio, the faith the filmmakers had in Pocahontas caused minor chaos,

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
with animators begging to jump ship off of The Lion King in favor of Pocahontas,

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
which was widely considered within the studio to be the superior of the two.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
The more legit and artistic, see?

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
So Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg, who were CEO and studio head respectively at the time,

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
were somewhat surprised that the reaction to the film was mostly indifference, disappointment,

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
and harsh criticism from Native American groups who were annoyed at basically every aspect of the film.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
And it's easy to see where that criticism comes from.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Pocahontas is basically peak 90s neoliberalism.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
It has all of the required merchandisable Disney things.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Cool!

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
She's beautiful!

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
She's so tall!

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
And her hair's so long!

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
We've aged up the historical figure into a sexy Barbie doll, middle-aged pudge man John Smith.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
John Smith!

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
Has been chiseled into a golden-haired Adonis, voiced by Mel Gibson,

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
and it plays into basically every Native American stereotype that even by the 90s had reached parody levels.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
This movie is so parodic in levels of Disney-ness,

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
I'm surprised Miko didn't have, like, a cute snarky one-liner that they then printed on millions of shirts

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
that went on to fill millions of cubic landfill feet.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
The subject of the Disney company and its portrayal of indigenous peoples in service of the Disney brand is massive,

04:55.000 --> 05:01.000
so I'm going to have to omit a lot of stuff in the service of streamlining this thing,

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
so I apologize for that.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
I'm going to have to leave a lot of stuff out.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
I should probably also mention that talking about issues of indigenous people as an American is somewhat fraught,

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
because Americans are kind of obsessed with this idea of blood quantums,

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
especially since that is actually how a lot of tribes determine tribal membership.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
And a lot of white people have this tendency to claim some obscure Native American ancestry like it makes them an expert,

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
or it makes whatever they say or do regarding Native American representation totes okay.

05:28.000 --> 05:35.000
I can remember my grandparents, you know, talking about how we had some degree of Indian blood,

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
and it was, to me, a point of pride.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
You don't even know what tribe you're supposed to be descended from!

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
I'm not trying to qualify anything I say, except as a student of media studies.

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
I am just one well-meaning idiot trying to contextualize Disney's portrayal of indigenous people

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
and how that has changed over the years.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
Eisner and Katzenberg thought they were ushering in a new era of artistic credibility.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
Instead, the film feels more like a mistake.

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
But now in the era of Moana, much as I still think Pocahontas, well, sucks,

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
I've never been popular.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
I like you.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
my feelings on the film and its place in the discourse have softened a bit.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
Pocahontas was, in many ways, a mistake, in the same way that Song of the South was a mistake.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
I think history will only look more and more unkindly upon Disney's Pocahontas.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
But a mistake need not necessarily be a bad thing.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
As a wise megamind once said,

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
If there's a benefit to losing, you get to learn from your mistakes.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
So the question is, with this little stealth remake they've done with Moana,

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
has Disney learned from the mistakes of Pocahontas?

06:41.000 --> 06:47.000
Here at the studio, we have many artists who achieved national reputation as painters

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
in addition to their accomplishments in the field of animation.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
These men know the value of Henry's advice to be yourself.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
In 1962, during a screening in his home in the hills of Los Feliz,

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
Walt Disney watched Robert Mulligan's To Kill a Mockingbird starring Gregory Peck.

07:02.000 --> 07:09.000
In the name of God, do your duty.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
After the film was over, Disney lamented to his family,

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
That's the kind of film I wish I could make.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
Disney had so successfully solidified his brand

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
that he had branded himself right into a corner with fun, light-hearted family fare.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
And because of that, he could not make the kinds of movies

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
that were revolutionizing the film industry.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
Disney was experiencing a creative stimming, at least on the movie side of things,

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
that would follow him until his death a few years later.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
The Walt Disney Studio is the only major movie studio

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
that has a specific brand attached to the sort of movies it puts out.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
And with that brand is a certain set of expectations.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
This problem was especially obvious with several of the renaissance-era Disney movies.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
There was a desire to expand and tell more complex narratives,

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
but the studio was still really constrained by that Disney brand.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
The Hunchback of Notre Dame is the best example of this.

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
Like fire, hellfire.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
And as I ring these bells tonight,

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
God have mercy on me.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
I'm losing to a bird!

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Stay true, Eddie!

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Pour the wine and cut the cheese.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
But Pocahontas is up there, too.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Here's what you get when races are diverse.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
They're not like you and me, which means they must be evil.

08:26.000 --> 08:32.000
The filmmakers originally envisioned a more, shall we say, historically rooted film.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
But the studio head Jeffrey Katzenberg pushed it to what he considered to be more commercial.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Pocahontas was originally closer in age to the historical Pocahontas.

08:39.000 --> 08:45.000
It was even kicked around for a while that the Powhatan characters, yes, would speak entirely in native Powhatan,

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
and Pocahontas would have to go through the process of learning English.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Malick-style, baby.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
But in the end, most of the decisions that dragged the movie down into mediocrity

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
were born out of Katzenberg's desire to force a best picture contender like Beauty and the Beast.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
Pocahontas was aged up, and it was turned into a Romeo and Juliet-inspired love story

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
with the language barrier being transversed via listening with one's heart.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
Then there's Pocahontas's design, a trope as old as the hills.

09:18.000 --> 09:24.000
By the time Pocahontas came out, the only other Disney princess arguably as sexualized as Pocahontas was Princess Jasmine.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
And the year after that, Esmeralda.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Look at that disgusting display.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Yes, sir.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Funny that.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Well, what do you do?

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
According to an interview with Glen Keane from 1995,

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
we are doing a mature love story here, and we have to draw her as such.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
She has to be sexy.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
This is a Disney version.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
This is not a documentary.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
This may seem harmless,

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
but these media trends mirror very real problems in the real world to this day.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
Even now, Native American women are twice the national average in reported rapes and sexual assault.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
And those are just the ones that get reported.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
Media trends of sexualizing indigenous women do not exist in a bubble.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
But the worst hangover I get from Pocahontas is how it reinforces this comfortable lie

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
that white Americans are fed from birth.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
That things were a little tense at first,

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
but ultimately the whites and the natives got along and everything was fine.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
Like, seriously, the movie both sides-es the whole issue.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Yeah, the English had guns and smallpox,

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
and decades of driving the natives off their lands,

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
but the Powhatans were jerks too, you guys.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Killers at the core.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
They're different from us,

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
which means they can't be trusted.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
The Indians calling the Europeans savages?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Mind blown.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
The studio purported a desire to honor Native Americans,

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
and I'm sure there is some truth to that.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
But at the end of the day,

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
the film just kind of reinforces this myth of the founding of the country

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
that we are force-fed from birth,

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
like a goose being fed for pate.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
But not everyone reads it like that.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
According to Russell Means,

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
This film is the finest feature film ever done

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
about American Indians in the history of Hollywood.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
It's so revolutionary.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
It shocked me when they showed it to me.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
The first thing that shocked me was the truth.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
The Eurocentric males are admitting why they came here,

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
to kill Indians and to rob and pillage.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
That's never been done before.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
This is also the first time, other than on Northern Exposure,

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
that a human face has been put on an Indian female.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
Here is this young woman who is wiser than her father or any man in the village,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
and she causes peace to reign.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
It's beautiful.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Without going too deeply into it,

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
let's just say that Russell Means is somewhat controversial

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
in the activism world.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
Russell Means was the actor who played Pocahontas' father in the film.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
He was also a Lakota Sioux activist for Native American rights

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
and a leader of the American Indian movement in the 1970s,

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
helping to organize the standoff at Wounded Knee in 1973.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
According to the LA Times,

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
Russell Means brought instant legitimacy and authenticity to Pocahontas.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
I haven't abandoned the movement for Hollywood, said Means.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
I've just added Hollywood to the movement.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
The entertainment world is a powerful venue for revolution,

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
particularly now that there are 500 channels on the horizon

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
and the global market is so big.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Many of Means' former activist colleagues

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
did not agree with his interpretation on the media,

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
or that he was helping to champion the causes he purported to champion

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
by the media he was participating in.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
But my point here is that the legacy of Pocahontas

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
is more complicated than thing good or thing bad.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
So.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Cultural appropriation!

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
R.I.P. comment section.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
I'd like to take it back a few dozen steps

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
and talk about some of these theoretical terms

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
that have become politically loaded over the last few years,

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
particularly cultural appropriation.

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
As a theoretical term, cultural appropriation is neither bad nor good.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
It just describes a sociological phenomenon.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
It may have deleterious or positive effects on certain groups,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
but the term itself is neutral.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Cultural appropriation is the adoption or use

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
of elements of one culture by members of another culture.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
That's all it is.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
That's what I mean when I say cultural appropriation is a neutral term.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
For instance, the fact that I wear a clodder ring.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
This is a form of cultural appropriation.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
I'm not Irish.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
I studied Irish when I was in college.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
I actually have a minor in Irish studies.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
But I don't know if I have any Irish ancestry.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
I might. I might not.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
If I do, it's so far back in the ancestry line

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
as to be completely irrelevant.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
So this is actually a form of cultural appropriation.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
If you happen to be American

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
and want a more subjective understanding

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
of what cultural appropriation in movies even is,

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
one of my favorite examples is from a 2003 Bollywood movie

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
called Galhónahó.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
This movie takes place in New York.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
This was filmed in Toronto.

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
And, yeah, this is a form of cultural appropriation.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
I like to use this example because unless you're super into anime,

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
most Americans have an experienced media

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
as American culture on the other end of cultural appropriation.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Americans are so used to being the dominant producers of media

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
that we aren't accustomed to seeing what it's like

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
to be portrayed by a culture that does not care

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
if their product sells in American markets.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
The fact that cultural appropriation is, in theory,

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
a neutral term leads to a lot of false equivalencies,

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
i.e., why is this form of cultural appropriation okay,

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
but Gwen Stefani dressing as a sexy warrior is not okay?

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Well, it's a complex issue,

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
and there is a lot of intersection over race and class and gender,

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
but here is a general rule of thumb.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
If it is a culture that was historically exploited by colonialism

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
appropriating a historically colonizing culture,

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
no harm, no foul.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
No one gets mad at Mexico for appropriating elements of German culture.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
Unless you happen to live in LA and that's all that's on the radio.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
If it is a historically colonialist culture

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
appropriating a culture that was exploited by colonialism,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
then people start to get a little cranky.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Obviously, there are intersections and complexities,

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
but for simplicity's sake, I'll leave it there for now.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
But I think most people would agree that,

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
unlike something like Pocahontas or even Slumdog Millionaire,

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
a movie which pretty much every Indian I've ever talked to is not a fan of,

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
this kind of cultural appropriation is basically harmless.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
This is what I mean by cultural appropriation being a neutral term.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
Not all cultural appropriation is created equal.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
So I think the real question people want the answer to

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
is where the line is between positive examples of representation

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
and harmful cultural appropriation.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
And that's the problem.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
There isn't really a line.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
So you can have a movie like Moana,

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
which had a much higher proportion of Pacific Islanders

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
working behind the scenes and in the cast

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
than American Natives did for Pocahontas.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
But the film still reads as appropriative to some

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
because the story is still cookie-cutter Disney.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
What is wrong with me?

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
And the department heads were overwhelmingly old white men.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
As long as you have a multinational corporation

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
appropriating some element of another culture to sell stuff,

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
no matter how respectful or well-researched,

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
there is always going to be some level of appropriation.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
So with regard to the lesson Disney took from the backlash against Pocahontas,

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
you would think that the lesson Disney would have taken

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
with regard to depicting indigenous peoples is

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
DON'T.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
But it wasn't.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
We've had four more Disney features with indigenous protagonists since Pocahontas,

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
two of which involved said protagonists turning into large mammals

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
in order to learn a lesson.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
I'm not going to get into that.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
I'm just saying.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
It happened.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Twice.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Shh.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
I don't speak bear.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
First was The Emperor's New Groove,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
which was in development hell for years

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
and was originally a large, very important portentous musical

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
in the vein of Pocahontas called Kingdom of the Sun.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
But then that vision got scrapped,

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
most of the creative team got replaced,

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
and the film turned into a buddy comedy

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
with barely a veneer of the original setting slapped on top.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Butler.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Chef.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Theme song guy.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
The Emperor's New Groove has almost no relation to the culture it takes place in

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
other than llama being the one domesticated animal down there

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
and sometimes the topography.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
The Emperor's New Groove is so thoroughly divorced from the culture it takes place in

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
that the appropriation discussion rarely even pops up in relation to this movie.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
Brother Bear, the other movie where the arrogant protagonist

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
gets turned into a large mammal to learn a lesson,

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
has more to do with the culture it is appropriating than either Emperor's New Groove

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
or even Pocahontas for that matter,

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
taking the concept of spirit animal to a very literal literalness.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
But the thing that fascinates me about Brother Bear in this context

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
is less how it appropriates culture in its story

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
with the idea of the spirit animal turning Joaquin Phoenix into a literal animal,

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
but with the way it mixes native language with a European style of music.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
YouTuber Sideways did a great video essay entitled How Disney Uses Language.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
This essay has a little segment about Brother Bear

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
and its use of Inupiat language with Bulgarian women's choir music

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
because it sounds vaguely, you know, ethnic.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
So they used music that most people hadn't heard of

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
that had nothing to do with the context of the film

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
in order to make the scene sound, I don't know, more magical?

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
Point here being that Brother Bear kind of took a step back

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
and got away with it because most people couldn't tell the difference

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
between a Bulgarian women's choir and Inupiat music.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
Both are presumed to sound equally alien.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
So even though Brother Bear uses Bulgarian music to try and convey an Alaskan sound,

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
which, alright, they were actually on the right track by using the native language.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Part of the reason Brother Bear was a huge step back

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
is because there was a lot of chaos going on at the Disney company at the time

19:19.000 --> 19:24.000
with Roy Disney basically staging a coup against Michael Eisner from the outside of the company.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
So the result was that the last few gasps of traditional animation in the mid-2000s

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
were just kind of lazy and careless.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
But if we really want to take a look at the way Disney portrays indigenous people,

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
especially indigenous women, the real shift isn't Moana.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
It's Nani from 2002's Lilo and Stitch.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
Hey! Which way are you going?

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Pocahontas is hyper-sexualized.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
She moves animalistically, falls in love with the first white guy she sees,

19:49.000 --> 19:55.000
talks to the animals and communes with the spirits of things like rocks and trees.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
Nani is a complete departure from that.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
She isn't sexually available to white men.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
She's not even sexually available at all, not really.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
She has one guy who's interested in her,

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
but she can't return that interest because she doesn't have that luxury

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
because she has to take care of her sister.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
You're not doing anything.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
David, I told you, I can't.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
I...

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
I got a lot to deal with right now.

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
The most exoticized thing that Nani wears is for when she's working for a literal tourist trap.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
But Nani is not divorced from her culture either.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
In one of the most emotionally powerful moments in the film,

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
the night before Lilo is set to be taken away from Nani by social services,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Nani sings to her Aloha Oe.

20:36.000 --> 20:41.000
Aloha Oe

20:41.000 --> 20:46.000
Aloha Oe

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
Aloha Oe was written by Queen Lili'uokalani,

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
the last monarch of the Kingdom of Hawaii.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
It translates to farewell to thee and became a symbol for lost country

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
after the forced annexation of Hawaii into the United States.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
And this isn't the only reference to Lili'uokalani in the film.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
The song at the opening invokes her as well, in the Hawaiian language.

21:04.000 --> 21:12.000
Aloha Oe

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
It's super subtle for Disney,

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
but there is a deliberateness here to tie in the characters' personal struggles with their heritage.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
So in the later scene, when Nani is singing Aloha Oe to Lilo,

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
Nani is using one of the most iconic cultural songs of Hawaii

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
to symbolize what is literally about to happen to her.

21:26.000 --> 21:31.000
Her family is about to be ripped apart by a literal agent of the United States government.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
In case you're wondering, this did not go well.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
This is an issue that directly affects indigenous peoples, especially in the United States.

21:38.000 --> 21:43.000
We, like most countries, have a long, proud history of tearing indigenous families apart.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
That the film uses Aloha Oe,

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
a song that has become a symbol of the forced annexation of Hawaii into the United States,

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
about her own pain over her family being ripped apart,

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
that's almost radical for a Disney movie.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
And, yeah, it's also some level of appropriation.

21:59.000 --> 22:04.000
It might be a powerful moment and was mostly positively received, but it's still Disney.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
See, that's what I mean by there isn't really a line.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
It's a complex topic.

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
Lilo and Stitch had a deleted scene that confronted the racism of the white tourists head-on.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
Hey, speak English? Which way to the beach?

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
I'm kind of bummed they cut this out for a lot of reasons.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
It would have helped the movie from a story standpoint,

22:26.000 --> 22:31.000
as this deleted scene is the moment where Stitch decides, hey, maybe this kid's all right.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
It also points to Lilo's feelings as an outsider being more than just her being a weirdo.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
She is a tourist commodity in her own country.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Oh, look, a real native!

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
Lilo and Stitch begins to scratch the surface of Hawaii's poverty, job market,

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
and its dependence on mainland tourists.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
But, you know, not really, dawg, because it's still a Disney movie,

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
which is why I think they cut that scene out.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
Tourists, prepare to die!

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
So the big lesson learned from Pocahontas wasn't don't make narratives about indigenous peoples,

22:59.000 --> 23:04.000
but rather don't make these narratives about the characters' relationships to white people.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
With The Emperor's New Groove, Brother Bear, and Moana,

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
this is accomplished by simply setting the story in the pre-Columbian era,

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
with Lilo and Stitch in the modern era, but with no white characters except for the tourists.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
I wish Disney had internalized this lesson with The Princess and the Frog,

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
which goes so far out of its way to portray the wealthy white family as nice and well-meaning,

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
and what systemic oppression?

23:23.000 --> 23:28.000
What, Jim Crow? I'm just a nice, wealthy white patrician here for some beignets

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
from my favorite black-owned establishment on the other side of the tracks.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Anyway, and then came Moana.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Now who's up next?

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Uh-oh.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Uh-oh, it's Moana!

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
As I may have alluded to earlier, Moana has a very great deal in common with Pocahontas,

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
both narratively and in concept.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
So because of that, there was a lot of cringe in anticipation of the film.

23:53.000 --> 23:59.000
This cringe was upgraded to cringe upon the announcement of a little brown-faced,

23:59.000 --> 24:06.000
brown-bodied costume for kids of Maui's body and tats, which, yikes.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Yeah, well, they pulled that, but yeah.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Disney, what were you thinking?

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
At the end of the day, Disney gonna Disney.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Even before Moana came out, I was like,

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
oh boy, The Rock sure looks fun and love that Lin-Manuel Miranda,

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
and I can't wait to book my Disney vacation so I can stay at Disney's Polynesian Resort.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
I'd also be really curious to see if this movie would have even been greenlit

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
if Disney hadn't just bought its own private chunk of Hawaii.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
Hey, check it out, it's the star of Moana promoting Disney's new Hawaii chunk.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
What are your impressions about this beautiful resort,

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Aulania Disney Resort and Spa?

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Love it here. It's absolutely beautiful.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Vertical integration.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
At the end of the day, Moana is another cog in the vertically integrated Disney machine.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
As such, it's only willing to go so far with regard to authenticity.

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
Instead of focusing on a Polynesian culture, Moana is more of a mush of all of them,

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
which kind of reminds me of Mulan, which took place in China,

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
but aesthetically picked and chose a lot of elements from all over Asia.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Korea, Japan, the gang's all here.

25:04.000 --> 25:09.000
Moana also avoids the sexually available, submissive Polynesian woman stereotype,

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
but it still plays the happy natives with coconuts trope.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Consider the coconut!

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
Disney hired what they called an Oceanic Brain Trust,

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
a collection of scholars and activists from all over the Pacific,

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
to help with accuracy and sensitivity issues.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
But as Tina Ngata points out, having brown advisors doesn't make it a brown story.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
It's still very much a white person's story.

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
No matter how much the story draws from the culture it's trying to portray,

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
at the end of the day it's still a very narrow Disney coming-of-age story.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
Vicente M. Diaz wrote in Indian Country Today before the movie came out,

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
any altruism associated with this latest commercial adventure

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
will always be trumped by the proverbial bottom line,

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
but more depressingly, by an enduring colonial legacy in the Pacific Islands

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
that is further animated in the 21st century by neoliberal and post-colonial desires

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
for selling and consuming native culture of a very specific type.

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
And this is why the line between representation and cultural appropriation,

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
especially in animated movies, can be so blurry.

26:04.000 --> 26:10.000
The legacy of colonialism is baked into every facet of every culture on the planet.

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
Colonialism has had an incalculable impact on human civilization.

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
That is why it's so difficult to parse out exactly the impact of

26:18.000 --> 26:23.000
Group A being portrayed by dominant cultural Group B

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
in Disney movies.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
But that's why we're here.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
We're gonna fix colonialism, y'all.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Turn down the volume!

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
Filmmaker Taika Waititi, a native of New Zealand of Maori descent,

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
wrote the first draft of Moana before leaving the project.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
Although little of Waititi's script, which focused way more on gender

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
and on Moana's struggle in being in a family full of boys, remained in the film.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
His departure from the project seemed amicable.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
He's on good enough terms with Disney to be directing this fall's Thor Ragnarok.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Waititi said after the movie came out,

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
Indigenous people in films, it's like all nose flutes and panpipes

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
and, you know, people talking to ghosts, which I hate.

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
I thought, well, the best way of them not making something that's insensitive or shallow

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
was to involve people from that community, from the Pacific.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
If there's some way I could be at the table and help try and make this not a bad film,

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
then I'll try.

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
Waititi left Moana to go make What We Do in the Shadows with Jemaine Clement,

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
who, incidentally, stars in Moana as Ta Matoa.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
And if you haven't seen that movie, you should. It's cute.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
Just leave me to do my dark bidding on the internet.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
What are you bidding on?

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
I'm bidding on the table.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
But here's the thing that I think really separates Moana from Pocahontas,

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
and The Emperor's New Groove, for that matter.

27:33.000 --> 27:38.000
The plot derives from lessons Moana learns about her own culture.

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
Moana's personal journey only really kicks in when she finds out that

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
she is descended from a long line of voyagers.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
We are descended from voyagers

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
Who found their way across the world

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
And they call me

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
And that's the thing that sticks with me, racial stereotyping aside,

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
is that ultimately the story isn't just about a young girl finding herself,

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
but discovering that her ancestors did incredible things,

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
and her joy at discovering that.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
We were voyagers.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
Is anyone going to say that we should sacrifice some little girl in New Zealand

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
or Los Angeles or Hawaii seeing a well-rounded character who looks like her

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
just because it's Disney and therefore appropriative?

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
No. That's why there's a push for ethical cultural representation.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
And a lot of this stuff is subjective.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
That is why there can never be a pure representation,

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
especially in a globalist media economy.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
An increasingly diverse consumer base wants to see characters

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
who look like them portrayed on screen.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
Disney gets that it's just good business to try to be authentic

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
to the communities they are portraying.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
But they should hire more people from those communities, I'm just saying.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
But the one article I found the most interesting was Doug Herman

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
writing for Smithsonian Magazine,

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
and that article was about his ambivalence on the film.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
He liked that it got some stuff right,

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
but it also still plays into racial stereotyping.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
He felt ambivalent about it, frustrated even.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
And this frustration kind of gives me some hope

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
because I feel like we're making progress from the days of Pocahontas.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
It's no longer a hot mess, but a mixed bag.

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
When you use a bird to write with, it's called tweeting.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
And that may always be the case,

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
because, let me say it again for the people in the back,

29:11.000 --> 29:16.000
the legacy of colonialism is baked into every facet of every culture on the planet.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
So yeah, Disney's not about to challenge your ideas on American history.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
They've got theme park tickets to sell.

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
Come down onto Epcot Center and enjoy the American experience.

29:25.000 --> 29:29.000
Or you fans of Pocahontas can march on down to the world of Pandora,

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
which is a thing now.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
Ugh.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
Again, especially with a multinational hydra like Disney,

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
progress isn't always linear.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
At the end of the day, the financial bottom line

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
will always be the most important thing for a company like Disney.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
But there is money to be made in authenticity,

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
and I think Disney is edging closer to that

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
than, for instance, the days of The Enchanted Tiki Room.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
There's this one scene that's there towards the end of both films

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
where our heroine gets a pep talk from Spirit Grandma

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
that I feel speaks to the evolution,

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
not just of the cultural angle, but of the ethical storytelling of Disney movies.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
In both films, our heroine is feeling down and out,

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
and she's ready to give up.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Here's what Spirit Grandma says in Pocahontas.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
You have to stop them.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
I can't.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Child, remember your dream.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
I was wrong, Grandmother Willow.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
And here's what Spirit Grandma says in Moana.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
It's not your fault.

30:19.000 --> 30:24.000
I never should have put so much on your shoulders.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
If you are ready to go home,

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
I will be with you.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
This is such a tiny difference, but it is so telling to me

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
because it tells me that the filmmakers were thinking about

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
what children would take from the exchange with Moana.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
In Pocahontas, Spirit Grandma tells her that she's obligated

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
to fix the mess that other people made.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
But in Moana, Spirit Grandma concedes that it wasn't fair

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
for her to put that responsibility on a literal child.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
And rather than pushing Moana to fulfill her destiny,

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
she reassures her that her family loves and supports her

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
no matter what she decides.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
She loves the sea and her people.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
She makes her whole family proud.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
This is indicative of how taking into consideration

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
the feelings of your audience,

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
in this case of children,

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
can actually help make the story stronger.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Moana's moment is stronger than Pocahontas'

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
because it is motivated by her character growth.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Where in Pocahontas, it's her remembering this dream

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
she had at the beginning.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
It's the arrow from your dream.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
I was right.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
For Moana, it comes not from Compus Ex Machina,

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
but from a place of love and support,

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
creating a much more iconic moment than Pocahontas ever got.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Harry, you're here in my heart.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
You remind me.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
And I don't think this would have happened

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
if the filmmakers hadn't looked at the scene in Pocahontas

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
and thought,

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
wait, this has already been done.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
And it was kind of weak the first time.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
We can do better.

31:43.000 --> 31:47.000
I am Moana!

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Moana is far from perfect,

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
but I think the ambivalence of the criticism it received

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
is telling.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
It tells us that Disney, and by extension all of us,

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
has a long way to go,

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
but that Disney has learned some from the mistakes of its past.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
The best advice I have ever given to students

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
who have studied under me has been just this.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
Educate yourself.

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
Here! Educate yourself!

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
What you love most about cinema

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
would get you called a movie snob.

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
The language can be subtle and poetic,

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
but not all people care about that,

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
like Mary Alice or Jim Bob.

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
To be safe, we use a visual dialectic.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
Water is the metaphor.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
Water is the metaphor.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
I'm pure and free.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Water is the metaphor.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
I'm like the sea.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
I'm wild and I'm deep.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
I've got a spree

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
swimming through my guts and gore.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
Water is the metaphor

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
for me.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
That describes me.
