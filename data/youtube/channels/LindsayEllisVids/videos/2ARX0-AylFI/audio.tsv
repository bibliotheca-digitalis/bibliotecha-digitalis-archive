0	2000	So, I have a pitch for a movie.
2000	9000	It's about this young girl, and she's the daughter of the tribal chief of a group of indigenous people living in pre-colonial times.
9000	11000	And she's about to come of age, and her dad is like,
11000	16000	Time to come of age, honey. You need to do the thing and take your place in the leaderarchy.
16000	18000	It suits you.
18000	22000	And she's like, Eh, I'm not too keen on your particular vision for me, Dad.
22000	25000	She likes water. It's like a metaphor for freedom, and she's like,
25000	28000	Hey water, is there something more for me out there?
28000	30000	And then she sings a song about the water.
35000	40000	She has this grandmother character who's special because she's got a spiritual insight that nobody else in the tribe has,
40000	44000	and she's like, Hey, maybe your dad is being too restrictive.
44000	46000	Maybe there is something more out there for you.
46000	49000	But then a conflict comes from over the sea, and Grandma's like,
49000	52000	Well, you know what? Hey, maybe that's your destiny, and you need to go meet it.
52000	55000	And our heroine is like, Okay, yeah, that sounds legit.
55000	61000	Turns out she has this treasure-obsessed antagonist who's really obsessed with being shiny.
63000	66000	So she gets in a boat and goes out to meet her destiny.
66000	72000	And after some trials and tribulations and hanging out with some guy who is pretty disrespectful to her TBH,
72000	75000	she kind of f***s up by way of overestimating her own abilities
75000	78000	and nearly gets the guy she's palling around with killed.
78000	81000	And then she's like, You know what? Maybe I can't do it.
81000	83000	Maybe I can't fix the conflict.
83000	86000	And so she's kind of sad, and she talks to her spirit grandma like,
86000	90000	I have no idea what I'm doing, and spirit grandma's like, No, honey, you got this.
90000	94000	And she realizes what her destiny is, and ultimately our heroine saves the day,
94000	98000	not through violence or might, but with her compassion.
98000	100000	And then her dad was like, Oh, okay, honey, I guess you were right.
100000	105000	And then she takes her place in the leaderarchy and helps her people into a new era of hope.
105000	107000	The end.
109000	110000	That's not been done before, has it?
110000	115000	Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon?
115000	119000	The 90s was a weird time for representation of Native American people.
119000	123000	There's a documentary on Netflix called Real Engine you should check out for a better overview.
123000	127000	I am greeted with open smiles and looks of appreciation.
127000	130000	In short, I have become a celebrity.
131000	136000	We'd be here all day if we did even a brief overview of all the media trends leading up to that.
136000	142000	But suffice to say that by the 90s, the trend was sympathetic to the Native American plight.
142000	146000	But also, you know, white Americans don't want to feel like the bad guy,
146000	151000	which is why almost all of the 90s crop of movies that involved Native Americans had good white protagonists,
151000	158000	helping the natives out against the bad white people who are greedy and bad and like money,
158000	164000	not like the good white people who just want to be free and live one with the nature and the spirits of the nature,
164000	166000	and like, hey, maybe we're not so different.
169000	175000	That brief resurgence of the Western in the 90s was a reflection on America's changing understanding of its own history.
175000	185000	White America was in a process of coming to terms with its relationship to the people who were here, you know, first.
185000	192000	Enter Pocahontas, which effectively ended that 90s era of why can't we just all get along colonialist Hollywood narratives.
192000	197000	Oh, there continued to be smatterings of that kind of movie here and there in the years that followed,
197000	200000	but by the time Pocahontas came out, people were kind of sick of it.
200000	203000	My bark is worse than my bite.
204000	210000	Disney was expecting Pocahontas to be the smash hit that would break through the glass ceiling cracked by Beauty and the Beast.
210000	214000	That Best Picture Oscar glass ceiling, because Best Animated Picture was not a thing yet.
214000	219000	Inside of the Disney studio, the faith the filmmakers had in Pocahontas caused minor chaos,
219000	223000	with animators begging to jump ship off of The Lion King in favor of Pocahontas,
223000	226000	which was widely considered within the studio to be the superior of the two.
226000	228000	The more legit and artistic, see?
230000	235000	So Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg, who were CEO and studio head respectively at the time,
235000	239000	were somewhat surprised that the reaction to the film was mostly indifference, disappointment,
239000	245000	and harsh criticism from Native American groups who were annoyed at basically every aspect of the film.
245000	248000	And it's easy to see where that criticism comes from.
248000	251000	Pocahontas is basically peak 90s neoliberalism.
251000	254000	It has all of the required merchandisable Disney things.
254000	255000	Cool!
255000	256000	She's beautiful!
256000	257000	She's so tall!
257000	259000	And her hair's so long!
261000	266000	We've aged up the historical figure into a sexy Barbie doll, middle-aged pudge man John Smith.
266000	269000	John Smith!
269000	273000	Has been chiseled into a golden-haired Adonis, voiced by Mel Gibson,
273000	278000	and it plays into basically every Native American stereotype that even by the 90s had reached parody levels.
278000	281000	This movie is so parodic in levels of Disney-ness,
281000	286000	I'm surprised Miko didn't have, like, a cute snarky one-liner that they then printed on millions of shirts
286000	289000	that went on to fill millions of cubic landfill feet.
289000	295000	The subject of the Disney company and its portrayal of indigenous peoples in service of the Disney brand is massive,
295000	301000	so I'm going to have to omit a lot of stuff in the service of streamlining this thing,
301000	303000	so I apologize for that.
303000	305000	I'm going to have to leave a lot of stuff out.
305000	310000	I should probably also mention that talking about issues of indigenous people as an American is somewhat fraught,
310000	314000	because Americans are kind of obsessed with this idea of blood quantums,
314000	319000	especially since that is actually how a lot of tribes determine tribal membership.
319000	324000	And a lot of white people have this tendency to claim some obscure Native American ancestry like it makes them an expert,
324000	328000	or it makes whatever they say or do regarding Native American representation totes okay.
328000	335000	I can remember my grandparents, you know, talking about how we had some degree of Indian blood,
335000	337000	and it was, to me, a point of pride.
337000	340000	You don't even know what tribe you're supposed to be descended from!
340000	345000	I'm not trying to qualify anything I say, except as a student of media studies.
345000	350000	I am just one well-meaning idiot trying to contextualize Disney's portrayal of indigenous people
350000	352000	and how that has changed over the years.
352000	356000	Eisner and Katzenberg thought they were ushering in a new era of artistic credibility.
356000	360000	Instead, the film feels more like a mistake.
360000	366000	But now in the era of Moana, much as I still think Pocahontas, well, sucks,
366000	369000	I've never been popular.
369000	370000	I like you.
370000	374000	my feelings on the film and its place in the discourse have softened a bit.
374000	379000	Pocahontas was, in many ways, a mistake, in the same way that Song of the South was a mistake.
379000	383000	I think history will only look more and more unkindly upon Disney's Pocahontas.
383000	386000	But a mistake need not necessarily be a bad thing.
386000	388000	As a wise megamind once said,
388000	392000	If there's a benefit to losing, you get to learn from your mistakes.
392000	396000	So the question is, with this little stealth remake they've done with Moana,
396000	400000	has Disney learned from the mistakes of Pocahontas?
401000	407000	Here at the studio, we have many artists who achieved national reputation as painters
407000	410000	in addition to their accomplishments in the field of animation.
410000	414000	These men know the value of Henry's advice to be yourself.
414000	418000	In 1962, during a screening in his home in the hills of Los Feliz,
418000	422000	Walt Disney watched Robert Mulligan's To Kill a Mockingbird starring Gregory Peck.
422000	429000	In the name of God, do your duty.
429000	432000	After the film was over, Disney lamented to his family,
432000	435000	That's the kind of film I wish I could make.
435000	438000	Disney had so successfully solidified his brand
438000	442000	that he had branded himself right into a corner with fun, light-hearted family fare.
442000	445000	And because of that, he could not make the kinds of movies
445000	447000	that were revolutionizing the film industry.
447000	451000	Disney was experiencing a creative stimming, at least on the movie side of things,
451000	454000	that would follow him until his death a few years later.
454000	457000	The Walt Disney Studio is the only major movie studio
457000	461000	that has a specific brand attached to the sort of movies it puts out.
462000	465000	And with that brand is a certain set of expectations.
465000	469000	This problem was especially obvious with several of the renaissance-era Disney movies.
469000	472000	There was a desire to expand and tell more complex narratives,
472000	475000	but the studio was still really constrained by that Disney brand.
475000	478000	The Hunchback of Notre Dame is the best example of this.
478000	483000	Like fire, hellfire.
483000	487000	And as I ring these bells tonight,
488000	492000	God have mercy on me.
492000	494000	I'm losing to a bird!
494000	497000	Stay true, Eddie!
497000	499000	Pour the wine and cut the cheese.
499000	501000	But Pocahontas is up there, too.
501000	503000	Here's what you get when races are diverse.
503000	506000	They're not like you and me, which means they must be evil.
506000	512000	The filmmakers originally envisioned a more, shall we say, historically rooted film.
512000	516000	But the studio head Jeffrey Katzenberg pushed it to what he considered to be more commercial.
516000	519000	Pocahontas was originally closer in age to the historical Pocahontas.
519000	525000	It was even kicked around for a while that the Powhatan characters, yes, would speak entirely in native Powhatan,
525000	528000	and Pocahontas would have to go through the process of learning English.
528000	530000	Malick-style, baby.
532000	536000	But in the end, most of the decisions that dragged the movie down into mediocrity
536000	540000	were born out of Katzenberg's desire to force a best picture contender like Beauty and the Beast.
540000	545000	Pocahontas was aged up, and it was turned into a Romeo and Juliet-inspired love story
545000	550000	with the language barrier being transversed via listening with one's heart.
554000	558000	Then there's Pocahontas's design, a trope as old as the hills.
558000	564000	By the time Pocahontas came out, the only other Disney princess arguably as sexualized as Pocahontas was Princess Jasmine.
564000	566000	And the year after that, Esmeralda.
566000	568000	Look at that disgusting display.
568000	569000	Yes, sir.
569000	571000	Funny that.
571000	573000	Well, what do you do?
573000	576000	According to an interview with Glen Keane from 1995,
576000	580000	we are doing a mature love story here, and we have to draw her as such.
580000	581000	She has to be sexy.
581000	583000	This is a Disney version.
583000	585000	This is not a documentary.
585000	587000	This may seem harmless,
587000	591000	but these media trends mirror very real problems in the real world to this day.
591000	596000	Even now, Native American women are twice the national average in reported rapes and sexual assault.
596000	598000	And those are just the ones that get reported.
598000	602000	Media trends of sexualizing indigenous women do not exist in a bubble.
602000	606000	But the worst hangover I get from Pocahontas is how it reinforces this comfortable lie
606000	608000	that white Americans are fed from birth.
608000	610000	That things were a little tense at first,
610000	613000	but ultimately the whites and the natives got along and everything was fine.
613000	616000	Like, seriously, the movie both sides-es the whole issue.
616000	618000	Yeah, the English had guns and smallpox,
618000	621000	and decades of driving the natives off their lands,
621000	624000	but the Powhatans were jerks too, you guys.
626000	628000	Killers at the core.
628000	629000	They're different from us,
629000	631000	which means they can't be trusted.
632000	633000	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
633000	637000	The Indians calling the Europeans savages?
637000	639000	Mind blown.
639000	642000	The studio purported a desire to honor Native Americans,
642000	645000	and I'm sure there is some truth to that.
645000	646000	But at the end of the day,
646000	650000	the film just kind of reinforces this myth of the founding of the country
650000	652000	that we are force-fed from birth,
652000	655000	like a goose being fed for pate.
655000	657000	But not everyone reads it like that.
657000	659000	According to Russell Means,
659000	661000	This film is the finest feature film ever done
661000	663000	about American Indians in the history of Hollywood.
663000	665000	It's so revolutionary.
665000	667000	It shocked me when they showed it to me.
667000	669000	The first thing that shocked me was the truth.
669000	671000	The Eurocentric males are admitting why they came here,
671000	673000	to kill Indians and to rob and pillage.
673000	675000	That's never been done before.
675000	678000	This is also the first time, other than on Northern Exposure,
678000	680000	that a human face has been put on an Indian female.
680000	684000	Here is this young woman who is wiser than her father or any man in the village,
684000	686000	and she causes peace to reign.
686000	687000	It's beautiful.
687000	689000	Without going too deeply into it,
689000	693000	let's just say that Russell Means is somewhat controversial
693000	695000	in the activism world.
695000	698000	Russell Means was the actor who played Pocahontas' father in the film.
698000	701000	He was also a Lakota Sioux activist for Native American rights
701000	704000	and a leader of the American Indian movement in the 1970s,
704000	707000	helping to organize the standoff at Wounded Knee in 1973.
707000	709000	According to the LA Times,
709000	712000	Russell Means brought instant legitimacy and authenticity to Pocahontas.
712000	715000	I haven't abandoned the movement for Hollywood, said Means.
715000	717000	I've just added Hollywood to the movement.
717000	720000	The entertainment world is a powerful venue for revolution,
720000	723000	particularly now that there are 500 channels on the horizon
723000	724000	and the global market is so big.
724000	726000	Many of Means' former activist colleagues
726000	729000	did not agree with his interpretation on the media,
729000	733000	or that he was helping to champion the causes he purported to champion
733000	735000	by the media he was participating in.
735000	738000	But my point here is that the legacy of Pocahontas
738000	742000	is more complicated than thing good or thing bad.
742000	743000	So.
744000	746000	Cultural appropriation!
747000	749000	R.I.P. comment section.
754000	756000	I'd like to take it back a few dozen steps
756000	758000	and talk about some of these theoretical terms
758000	761000	that have become politically loaded over the last few years,
761000	763000	particularly cultural appropriation.
766000	771000	As a theoretical term, cultural appropriation is neither bad nor good.
771000	773000	It just describes a sociological phenomenon.
773000	777000	It may have deleterious or positive effects on certain groups,
777000	779000	but the term itself is neutral.
779000	781000	Cultural appropriation is the adoption or use
781000	784000	of elements of one culture by members of another culture.
784000	785000	That's all it is.
785000	789000	That's what I mean when I say cultural appropriation is a neutral term.
789000	792000	For instance, the fact that I wear a clodder ring.
792000	794000	This is a form of cultural appropriation.
794000	796000	I'm not Irish.
796000	798000	I studied Irish when I was in college.
798000	800000	I actually have a minor in Irish studies.
800000	804000	But I don't know if I have any Irish ancestry.
804000	805000	I might. I might not.
805000	808000	If I do, it's so far back in the ancestry line
808000	810000	as to be completely irrelevant.
810000	813000	So this is actually a form of cultural appropriation.
819000	820000	If you happen to be American
820000	822000	and want a more subjective understanding
822000	824000	of what cultural appropriation in movies even is,
824000	827000	one of my favorite examples is from a 2003 Bollywood movie
827000	829000	called Galhónahó.
831000	834000	This movie takes place in New York.
834000	836000	This was filmed in Toronto.
842000	847000	And, yeah, this is a form of cultural appropriation.
854000	857000	I like to use this example because unless you're super into anime,
857000	859000	most Americans have an experienced media
859000	862000	as American culture on the other end of cultural appropriation.
862000	864000	Americans are so used to being the dominant producers of media
864000	866000	that we aren't accustomed to seeing what it's like
866000	868000	to be portrayed by a culture that does not care
868000	870000	if their product sells in American markets.
870000	873000	The fact that cultural appropriation is, in theory,
873000	876000	a neutral term leads to a lot of false equivalencies,
876000	879000	i.e., why is this form of cultural appropriation okay,
879000	883000	but Gwen Stefani dressing as a sexy warrior is not okay?
883000	885000	Well, it's a complex issue,
885000	888000	and there is a lot of intersection over race and class and gender,
888000	891000	but here is a general rule of thumb.
891000	894000	If it is a culture that was historically exploited by colonialism
894000	896000	appropriating a historically colonizing culture,
896000	898000	no harm, no foul.
898000	901000	No one gets mad at Mexico for appropriating elements of German culture.
901000	905000	Unless you happen to live in LA and that's all that's on the radio.
910000	912000	If it is a historically colonialist culture
912000	915000	appropriating a culture that was exploited by colonialism,
915000	917000	then people start to get a little cranky.
917000	919000	Obviously, there are intersections and complexities,
919000	921000	but for simplicity's sake, I'll leave it there for now.
921000	924000	But I think most people would agree that,
924000	927000	unlike something like Pocahontas or even Slumdog Millionaire,
927000	931000	a movie which pretty much every Indian I've ever talked to is not a fan of,
931000	935000	this kind of cultural appropriation is basically harmless.
941000	945000	This is what I mean by cultural appropriation being a neutral term.
945000	948000	Not all cultural appropriation is created equal.
948000	951000	So I think the real question people want the answer to
951000	955000	is where the line is between positive examples of representation
955000	957000	and harmful cultural appropriation.
957000	959000	And that's the problem.
959000	961000	There isn't really a line.
967000	969000	So you can have a movie like Moana,
969000	971000	which had a much higher proportion of Pacific Islanders
971000	973000	working behind the scenes and in the cast
973000	975000	than American Natives did for Pocahontas.
975000	977000	But the film still reads as appropriative to some
977000	979000	because the story is still cookie-cutter Disney.
979000	981000	What is wrong with me?
981000	984000	And the department heads were overwhelmingly old white men.
984000	986000	As long as you have a multinational corporation
986000	989000	appropriating some element of another culture to sell stuff,
989000	992000	no matter how respectful or well-researched,
992000	995000	there is always going to be some level of appropriation.
995000	999000	So with regard to the lesson Disney took from the backlash against Pocahontas,
999000	1001000	you would think that the lesson Disney would have taken
1001000	1004000	with regard to depicting indigenous peoples is
1004000	1005000	DON'T.
1005000	1007000	But it wasn't.
1007000	1011000	We've had four more Disney features with indigenous protagonists since Pocahontas,
1011000	1015000	two of which involved said protagonists turning into large mammals
1015000	1017000	in order to learn a lesson.
1021000	1022000	I'm not going to get into that.
1022000	1023000	I'm just saying.
1023000	1024000	It happened.
1024000	1025000	Twice.
1026000	1027000	Shh.
1027000	1029000	I don't speak bear.
1029000	1031000	First was The Emperor's New Groove,
1031000	1033000	which was in development hell for years
1033000	1037000	and was originally a large, very important portentous musical
1037000	1040000	in the vein of Pocahontas called Kingdom of the Sun.
1040000	1042000	But then that vision got scrapped,
1042000	1044000	most of the creative team got replaced,
1044000	1046000	and the film turned into a buddy comedy
1046000	1049000	with barely a veneer of the original setting slapped on top.
1049000	1050000	Butler.
1050000	1052000	Chef.
1052000	1054000	Theme song guy.
1055000	1059000	The Emperor's New Groove has almost no relation to the culture it takes place in
1059000	1064000	other than llama being the one domesticated animal down there
1064000	1066000	and sometimes the topography.
1067000	1071000	The Emperor's New Groove is so thoroughly divorced from the culture it takes place in
1071000	1075000	that the appropriation discussion rarely even pops up in relation to this movie.
1075000	1078000	Brother Bear, the other movie where the arrogant protagonist
1078000	1081000	gets turned into a large mammal to learn a lesson,
1081000	1085000	has more to do with the culture it is appropriating than either Emperor's New Groove
1085000	1087000	or even Pocahontas for that matter,
1087000	1092000	taking the concept of spirit animal to a very literal literalness.
1092000	1095000	But the thing that fascinates me about Brother Bear in this context
1095000	1098000	is less how it appropriates culture in its story
1098000	1102000	with the idea of the spirit animal turning Joaquin Phoenix into a literal animal,
1102000	1107000	but with the way it mixes native language with a European style of music.
1111000	1115000	YouTuber Sideways did a great video essay entitled How Disney Uses Language.
1115000	1117000	This essay has a little segment about Brother Bear
1117000	1121000	and its use of Inupiat language with Bulgarian women's choir music
1121000	1126000	because it sounds vaguely, you know, ethnic.
1126000	1128000	So they used music that most people hadn't heard of
1128000	1130000	that had nothing to do with the context of the film
1130000	1134000	in order to make the scene sound, I don't know, more magical?
1134000	1137000	Point here being that Brother Bear kind of took a step back
1137000	1140000	and got away with it because most people couldn't tell the difference
1140000	1143000	between a Bulgarian women's choir and Inupiat music.
1143000	1146000	Both are presumed to sound equally alien.
1146000	1150000	So even though Brother Bear uses Bulgarian music to try and convey an Alaskan sound,
1150000	1154000	which, alright, they were actually on the right track by using the native language.
1154000	1156000	Part of the reason Brother Bear was a huge step back
1156000	1159000	is because there was a lot of chaos going on at the Disney company at the time
1159000	1164000	with Roy Disney basically staging a coup against Michael Eisner from the outside of the company.
1164000	1168000	So the result was that the last few gasps of traditional animation in the mid-2000s
1168000	1170000	were just kind of lazy and careless.
1170000	1174000	But if we really want to take a look at the way Disney portrays indigenous people,
1174000	1177000	especially indigenous women, the real shift isn't Moana.
1177000	1180000	It's Nani from 2002's Lilo and Stitch.
1180000	1183000	Hey! Which way are you going?
1183000	1185000	Pocahontas is hyper-sexualized.
1185000	1189000	She moves animalistically, falls in love with the first white guy she sees,
1189000	1195000	talks to the animals and communes with the spirits of things like rocks and trees.
1195000	1198000	Nani is a complete departure from that.
1200000	1202000	She isn't sexually available to white men.
1202000	1205000	She's not even sexually available at all, not really.
1205000	1207000	She has one guy who's interested in her,
1207000	1210000	but she can't return that interest because she doesn't have that luxury
1210000	1212000	because she has to take care of her sister.
1212000	1213000	You're not doing anything.
1213000	1216000	David, I told you, I can't.
1216000	1217000	I...
1218000	1220000	I got a lot to deal with right now.
1220000	1224000	The most exoticized thing that Nani wears is for when she's working for a literal tourist trap.
1224000	1227000	But Nani is not divorced from her culture either.
1227000	1230000	In one of the most emotionally powerful moments in the film,
1230000	1234000	the night before Lilo is set to be taken away from Nani by social services,
1234000	1236000	Nani sings to her Aloha Oe.
1236000	1241000	Aloha Oe
1241000	1246000	Aloha Oe
1246000	1249000	Aloha Oe was written by Queen Lili'uokalani,
1249000	1251000	the last monarch of the Kingdom of Hawaii.
1251000	1254000	It translates to farewell to thee and became a symbol for lost country
1254000	1257000	after the forced annexation of Hawaii into the United States.
1257000	1260000	And this isn't the only reference to Lili'uokalani in the film.
1260000	1264000	The song at the opening invokes her as well, in the Hawaiian language.
1264000	1272000	Aloha Oe
1272000	1274000	It's super subtle for Disney,
1274000	1278000	but there is a deliberateness here to tie in the characters' personal struggles with their heritage.
1278000	1281000	So in the later scene, when Nani is singing Aloha Oe to Lilo,
1281000	1284000	Nani is using one of the most iconic cultural songs of Hawaii
1284000	1286000	to symbolize what is literally about to happen to her.
1286000	1291000	Her family is about to be ripped apart by a literal agent of the United States government.
1291000	1294000	In case you're wondering, this did not go well.
1294000	1298000	This is an issue that directly affects indigenous peoples, especially in the United States.
1298000	1303000	We, like most countries, have a long, proud history of tearing indigenous families apart.
1303000	1305000	That the film uses Aloha Oe,
1305000	1309000	a song that has become a symbol of the forced annexation of Hawaii into the United States,
1309000	1312000	about her own pain over her family being ripped apart,
1312000	1315000	that's almost radical for a Disney movie.
1315000	1319000	And, yeah, it's also some level of appropriation.
1319000	1324000	It might be a powerful moment and was mostly positively received, but it's still Disney.
1324000	1328000	See, that's what I mean by there isn't really a line.
1328000	1330000	It's a complex topic.
1330000	1334000	Lilo and Stitch had a deleted scene that confronted the racism of the white tourists head-on.
1335000	1338000	Hey, speak English? Which way to the beach?
1341000	1344000	I'm kind of bummed they cut this out for a lot of reasons.
1344000	1346000	It would have helped the movie from a story standpoint,
1346000	1351000	as this deleted scene is the moment where Stitch decides, hey, maybe this kid's all right.
1351000	1355000	It also points to Lilo's feelings as an outsider being more than just her being a weirdo.
1355000	1358000	She is a tourist commodity in her own country.
1358000	1360000	Oh, look, a real native!
1360000	1364000	Lilo and Stitch begins to scratch the surface of Hawaii's poverty, job market,
1364000	1366000	and its dependence on mainland tourists.
1366000	1369000	But, you know, not really, dawg, because it's still a Disney movie,
1369000	1371000	which is why I think they cut that scene out.
1371000	1375000	Tourists, prepare to die!
1375000	1379000	So the big lesson learned from Pocahontas wasn't don't make narratives about indigenous peoples,
1379000	1384000	but rather don't make these narratives about the characters' relationships to white people.
1384000	1386000	With The Emperor's New Groove, Brother Bear, and Moana,
1386000	1389000	this is accomplished by simply setting the story in the pre-Columbian era,
1389000	1393000	with Lilo and Stitch in the modern era, but with no white characters except for the tourists.
1393000	1396000	I wish Disney had internalized this lesson with The Princess and the Frog,
1396000	1401000	which goes so far out of its way to portray the wealthy white family as nice and well-meaning,
1401000	1403000	and what systemic oppression?
1403000	1408000	What, Jim Crow? I'm just a nice, wealthy white patrician here for some beignets
1408000	1412000	from my favorite black-owned establishment on the other side of the tracks.
1415000	1417000	Anyway, and then came Moana.
1417000	1419000	Now who's up next?
1419000	1421000	Uh-oh.
1421000	1423000	Uh-oh, it's Moana!
1423000	1427000	As I may have alluded to earlier, Moana has a very great deal in common with Pocahontas,
1427000	1429000	both narratively and in concept.
1429000	1433000	So because of that, there was a lot of cringe in anticipation of the film.
1433000	1439000	This cringe was upgraded to cringe upon the announcement of a little brown-faced,
1439000	1446000	brown-bodied costume for kids of Maui's body and tats, which, yikes.
1447000	1449000	Yeah, well, they pulled that, but yeah.
1449000	1451000	Disney, what were you thinking?
1451000	1454000	At the end of the day, Disney gonna Disney.
1454000	1456000	Even before Moana came out, I was like,
1456000	1460000	oh boy, The Rock sure looks fun and love that Lin-Manuel Miranda,
1460000	1465000	and I can't wait to book my Disney vacation so I can stay at Disney's Polynesian Resort.
1465000	1468000	I'd also be really curious to see if this movie would have even been greenlit
1468000	1471000	if Disney hadn't just bought its own private chunk of Hawaii.
1471000	1475000	Hey, check it out, it's the star of Moana promoting Disney's new Hawaii chunk.
1475000	1477000	What are your impressions about this beautiful resort,
1477000	1479000	Aulania Disney Resort and Spa?
1479000	1481000	Love it here. It's absolutely beautiful.
1481000	1483000	Vertical integration.
1483000	1487000	At the end of the day, Moana is another cog in the vertically integrated Disney machine.
1487000	1491000	As such, it's only willing to go so far with regard to authenticity.
1491000	1496000	Instead of focusing on a Polynesian culture, Moana is more of a mush of all of them,
1496000	1499000	which kind of reminds me of Mulan, which took place in China,
1499000	1502000	but aesthetically picked and chose a lot of elements from all over Asia.
1502000	1504000	Korea, Japan, the gang's all here.
1504000	1509000	Moana also avoids the sexually available, submissive Polynesian woman stereotype,
1509000	1512000	but it still plays the happy natives with coconuts trope.
1512000	1514000	Consider the coconut!
1514000	1517000	Disney hired what they called an Oceanic Brain Trust,
1517000	1520000	a collection of scholars and activists from all over the Pacific,
1520000	1522000	to help with accuracy and sensitivity issues.
1522000	1526000	But as Tina Ngata points out, having brown advisors doesn't make it a brown story.
1526000	1528000	It's still very much a white person's story.
1528000	1532000	No matter how much the story draws from the culture it's trying to portray,
1532000	1536000	at the end of the day it's still a very narrow Disney coming-of-age story.
1536000	1540000	Vicente M. Diaz wrote in Indian Country Today before the movie came out,
1540000	1543000	any altruism associated with this latest commercial adventure
1543000	1545000	will always be trumped by the proverbial bottom line,
1545000	1549000	but more depressingly, by an enduring colonial legacy in the Pacific Islands
1549000	1553000	that is further animated in the 21st century by neoliberal and post-colonial desires
1553000	1557000	for selling and consuming native culture of a very specific type.
1557000	1561000	And this is why the line between representation and cultural appropriation,
1561000	1564000	especially in animated movies, can be so blurry.
1564000	1570000	The legacy of colonialism is baked into every facet of every culture on the planet.
1570000	1574000	Colonialism has had an incalculable impact on human civilization.
1574000	1578000	That is why it's so difficult to parse out exactly the impact of
1578000	1583000	Group A being portrayed by dominant cultural Group B
1583000	1585000	in Disney movies.
1585000	1587000	But that's why we're here.
1587000	1589000	We're gonna fix colonialism, y'all.
1589000	1591000	Turn down the volume!
1592000	1596000	Filmmaker Taika Waititi, a native of New Zealand of Maori descent,
1596000	1599000	wrote the first draft of Moana before leaving the project.
1599000	1602000	Although little of Waititi's script, which focused way more on gender
1602000	1606000	and on Moana's struggle in being in a family full of boys, remained in the film.
1606000	1608000	His departure from the project seemed amicable.
1608000	1612000	He's on good enough terms with Disney to be directing this fall's Thor Ragnarok.
1612000	1614000	Waititi said after the movie came out,
1614000	1618000	Indigenous people in films, it's like all nose flutes and panpipes
1618000	1621000	and, you know, people talking to ghosts, which I hate.
1621000	1625000	I thought, well, the best way of them not making something that's insensitive or shallow
1625000	1628000	was to involve people from that community, from the Pacific.
1628000	1632000	If there's some way I could be at the table and help try and make this not a bad film,
1632000	1633000	then I'll try.
1633000	1637000	Waititi left Moana to go make What We Do in the Shadows with Jemaine Clement,
1637000	1639000	who, incidentally, stars in Moana as Ta Matoa.
1639000	1641000	And if you haven't seen that movie, you should. It's cute.
1641000	1644000	Just leave me to do my dark bidding on the internet.
1644000	1646000	What are you bidding on?
1646000	1647000	I'm bidding on the table.
1647000	1651000	But here's the thing that I think really separates Moana from Pocahontas,
1651000	1653000	and The Emperor's New Groove, for that matter.
1653000	1658000	The plot derives from lessons Moana learns about her own culture.
1658000	1662000	Moana's personal journey only really kicks in when she finds out that
1662000	1665000	she is descended from a long line of voyagers.
1665000	1668000	We are descended from voyagers
1668000	1671000	Who found their way across the world
1671000	1673000	And they call me
1673000	1676000	And that's the thing that sticks with me, racial stereotyping aside,
1676000	1680000	is that ultimately the story isn't just about a young girl finding herself,
1680000	1683000	but discovering that her ancestors did incredible things,
1683000	1685000	and her joy at discovering that.
1686000	1688000	We were voyagers.
1688000	1691000	Is anyone going to say that we should sacrifice some little girl in New Zealand
1691000	1695000	or Los Angeles or Hawaii seeing a well-rounded character who looks like her
1695000	1697000	just because it's Disney and therefore appropriative?
1697000	1700000	No. That's why there's a push for ethical cultural representation.
1700000	1702000	And a lot of this stuff is subjective.
1702000	1705000	That is why there can never be a pure representation,
1705000	1707000	especially in a globalist media economy.
1707000	1710000	An increasingly diverse consumer base wants to see characters
1710000	1712000	who look like them portrayed on screen.
1712000	1715000	Disney gets that it's just good business to try to be authentic
1715000	1717000	to the communities they are portraying.
1717000	1719000	But they should hire more people from those communities, I'm just saying.
1719000	1722000	But the one article I found the most interesting was Doug Herman
1722000	1724000	writing for Smithsonian Magazine,
1724000	1726000	and that article was about his ambivalence on the film.
1726000	1728000	He liked that it got some stuff right,
1728000	1731000	but it also still plays into racial stereotyping.
1731000	1733000	He felt ambivalent about it, frustrated even.
1733000	1736000	And this frustration kind of gives me some hope
1736000	1739000	because I feel like we're making progress from the days of Pocahontas.
1739000	1742000	It's no longer a hot mess, but a mixed bag.
1742000	1746000	When you use a bird to write with, it's called tweeting.
1746000	1748000	And that may always be the case,
1748000	1751000	because, let me say it again for the people in the back,
1751000	1756000	the legacy of colonialism is baked into every facet of every culture on the planet.
1756000	1759000	So yeah, Disney's not about to challenge your ideas on American history.
1759000	1761000	They've got theme park tickets to sell.
1761000	1765000	Come down onto Epcot Center and enjoy the American experience.
1765000	1769000	Or you fans of Pocahontas can march on down to the world of Pandora,
1769000	1771000	which is a thing now.
1771000	1772000	Ugh.
1772000	1775000	Again, especially with a multinational hydra like Disney,
1775000	1777000	progress isn't always linear.
1777000	1779000	At the end of the day, the financial bottom line
1779000	1782000	will always be the most important thing for a company like Disney.
1782000	1785000	But there is money to be made in authenticity,
1785000	1788000	and I think Disney is edging closer to that
1788000	1791000	than, for instance, the days of The Enchanted Tiki Room.
1791000	1794000	There's this one scene that's there towards the end of both films
1794000	1796000	where our heroine gets a pep talk from Spirit Grandma
1796000	1798000	that I feel speaks to the evolution,
1798000	1801000	not just of the cultural angle, but of the ethical storytelling of Disney movies.
1801000	1804000	In both films, our heroine is feeling down and out,
1804000	1805000	and she's ready to give up.
1805000	1807000	Here's what Spirit Grandma says in Pocahontas.
1807000	1809000	You have to stop them.
1809000	1811000	I can't.
1811000	1813000	Child, remember your dream.
1813000	1815000	I was wrong, Grandmother Willow.
1815000	1817000	And here's what Spirit Grandma says in Moana.
1817000	1819000	It's not your fault.
1819000	1824000	I never should have put so much on your shoulders.
1824000	1827000	If you are ready to go home,
1827000	1829000	I will be with you.
1829000	1832000	This is such a tiny difference, but it is so telling to me
1832000	1834000	because it tells me that the filmmakers were thinking about
1834000	1837000	what children would take from the exchange with Moana.
1837000	1839000	In Pocahontas, Spirit Grandma tells her that she's obligated
1839000	1841000	to fix the mess that other people made.
1841000	1844000	But in Moana, Spirit Grandma concedes that it wasn't fair
1844000	1847000	for her to put that responsibility on a literal child.
1847000	1850000	And rather than pushing Moana to fulfill her destiny,
1850000	1853000	she reassures her that her family loves and supports her
1853000	1855000	no matter what she decides.
1855000	1858000	She loves the sea and her people.
1858000	1861000	She makes her whole family proud.
1861000	1863000	This is indicative of how taking into consideration
1863000	1865000	the feelings of your audience,
1865000	1867000	in this case of children,
1867000	1869000	can actually help make the story stronger.
1869000	1871000	Moana's moment is stronger than Pocahontas'
1871000	1873000	because it is motivated by her character growth.
1873000	1875000	Where in Pocahontas, it's her remembering this dream
1875000	1877000	she had at the beginning.
1877000	1879000	It's the arrow from your dream.
1879000	1880000	I was right.
1880000	1882000	For Moana, it comes not from Compus Ex Machina,
1882000	1884000	but from a place of love and support,
1884000	1887000	creating a much more iconic moment than Pocahontas ever got.
1887000	1889000	Harry, you're here in my heart.
1889000	1892000	You remind me.
1892000	1893000	And I don't think this would have happened
1893000	1895000	if the filmmakers hadn't looked at the scene in Pocahontas
1895000	1897000	and thought,
1897000	1899000	wait, this has already been done.
1899000	1901000	And it was kind of weak the first time.
1901000	1903000	We can do better.
1903000	1907000	I am Moana!
1907000	1909000	Moana is far from perfect,
1909000	1911000	but I think the ambivalence of the criticism it received
1911000	1912000	is telling.
1912000	1914000	It tells us that Disney, and by extension all of us,
1914000	1916000	has a long way to go,
1916000	1919000	but that Disney has learned some from the mistakes of its past.
1919000	1922000	The best advice I have ever given to students
1922000	1926000	who have studied under me has been just this.
1926000	1927000	Educate yourself.
1927000	1931000	Here! Educate yourself!
1931000	1933000	What you love most about cinema
1933000	1935000	would get you called a movie snob.
1935000	1939000	The language can be subtle and poetic,
1939000	1941000	but not all people care about that,
1941000	1943000	like Mary Alice or Jim Bob.
1943000	1947000	To be safe, we use a visual dialectic.
1947000	1950000	Water is the metaphor.
1950000	1954000	Water is the metaphor.
1954000	1956000	I'm pure and free.
1956000	1958000	Water is the metaphor.
1958000	1960000	I'm like the sea.
1960000	1962000	I'm wild and I'm deep.
1962000	1964000	I've got a spree
1964000	1966000	swimming through my guts and gore.
1966000	1969000	Water is the metaphor
1969000	1972000	for me.
1972000	1975000	That describes me.
