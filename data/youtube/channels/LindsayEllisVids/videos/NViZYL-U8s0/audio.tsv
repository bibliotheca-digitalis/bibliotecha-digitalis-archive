0	4880	I guess I'm going to do something kind of uncharacteristic and pop off a hot take
7160	13080	without thinking about it for like six months. So I've been seeing a lot of people on Twitter, a lot of which are in my mentions,
14520	20920	discussing death of the author and asking how we should apply this to
22720	24720	our newly out and proud
25680	29600	incredibly transphobic JK Rowling. The warning signs were there.
31200	38240	It kind of began, it was like a few months ago when people were noticing that she was liking some really hardcore
39920	41600	right-wing
41600	48520	TERF-y tweets. TERF meaning trans-exclusionary radical feminist. Like I'm not wild about the term for accuracy reasons,
48520	51160	but just so we're clear, it is not a slur.
51400	58360	So anyway, she was liking some TERF-y stuff and then she started retweeting it. What's the step beyond showing your slip? It's like
58880	61480	her dress got caught in her underwear,
62440	64440	with the most hilarious
65120	67120	oops
67120	69120	of a tweet that
69240	76440	has ever maybe happened with someone with more than a million followers, and then she just doubled down from there.
76520	84360	And so like just within the last 24 hours, we have her comparing providing gender services to young people with gay conversion therapy,
85160	91880	linking to fringe weirdos and medium posts, like it's like some authority. And as is the case with so many transphobes,
91880	95440	she is arguing against a position that nobody actually has.
96360	100440	No one is saying chromosomes are not real, Joanne.
100840	105240	Now if we wanted to get into that, that is its whole other thing, but suffice to say that
106160	108160	biological sex is in fact
108640	116800	much more complicated than the simple X and Y chromosome. Trans YouTuber Riley Dennis did a video on the subject a few years ago,
117040	121240	so I'll go ahead and link to that, and I'll let her speak to that issue. That's not what we're talking about.
121320	129560	We're talking about death of the author. So death of the author, when the author, a very successful and wealthy author, outs themselves as a
130560	138280	bigot. Now, it is entirely possible that you do not care, and you genuinely do believe in separating art from the artist.
138280	140280	And if that is the case,
140320	145600	you fly free, little bird. This video is not for you. Stop watching now. Go enjoy
146360	153480	Fantastic Beasts 5 or whatever. But here's the problem with even applying death of the author to this discussion, is
154360	159680	basically, you are trying to find an academic solution for an emotional and ethical
160360	162840	problem. As I said on my video on the subject,
162840	170360	I personally believe that you can't really practice death of the author in its purest pure form. If for no other reason than
170440	175080	if you are in any kind of like discourse setting, be it academic or
175440	178760	Twitter, other people aren't going to really allow it.
178760	183720	They will bring the author into it, and that is going to introduce subconscious biases,
183720	189040	which is of course going to affect your reading of the text, no matter how hard you try to be
189400	195840	unbiased or whatever. So you can try to practice death of the author, but as long as you're engaged in a community,
196360	200600	other people are probably going to bring the author in, whether you want them to or not.
200640	206080	So I think that part of the reason why there are a lot of really confused emotions about
206560	212560	J.K. Rowling going hard turf, is because so many people have an attachment to Harry Potter.
212560	217400	It was a part of their childhood. It was a part of their adolescence. It is deeply, deeply
218120	222640	important to some people. Maybe like 10 or 20 years ago, I would have been like smug about this,
223760	229600	but I feel for the Harry Potter fans of the world. Harry Potter, like I didn't hate it,
229600	233120	but like Harry Potter was never my thing, obviously. I never talk about it on this channel.
233160	239000	You know, like I read the books. I even, I even gave it a shout out in my book, which I'm kind of regretting now.
239600	242640	Oops. I just needed a book that came out in 2007.
242640	248920	But Harry Potter was blowing up around the same times that Lord of the Rings was having its resurgence in popularity, and the
249080	257000	relationship of the author to that text is a completely different discussion and one we are not going to have here. Tolkien has been dead
257000	261680	for 50 years. He's not on Twitter, but J.K. Rowling is not only alive,
261760	264240	she's also relatively young and
264760	271280	has tremendous power and influence and a lot of followers and a lot of money and a
271520	277960	lot of control of her intellectual property. And I've seen a lot of takes and I don't really want to address them all,
277960	283480	but basically you can try to be rational about the whole thing and be like, don't support her financially,
283560	287120	but the reality is it's a lot more complicated than that.
287120	292800	So while on some level there is a sort of broader political discussion on how she wields her influence,
293000	297400	really when people want to talk about death of the author, in this instance, they want to
298240	302720	reconcile their personal feelings about Harry Potter with the author.
303360	310880	Like, how do I reconcile the fact that the author of this series is using her power to do such incredible harm,
310880	318280	all while genuinely believing that she is doing the right thing, with the fact that this series was so formative for so many people?
318520	320520	How do you reconcile this?
320800	323920	The answer to that is, I don't know.
324200	330600	But I have kind of touched on this subject before a long time ago, and I think you can find it on my other channel.
330600	332600	I did a video
332680	337440	that kind of touched on a similar topic about Orson Scott Card,
337560	340160	who is the author of Ender's Game.
340160	344520	And it wasn't my, like, Harry Potter or anything, because I was older when I read it,
344680	353040	but it was extremely, well, formative for me, especially as a professional author. In particular, the sequel to Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead,
353040	356560	was extremely influential, and if you're familiar with it, you'll be like,
357120	364960	ah, I can see that. Like, even the title of the Axiom's End sequel, which is called Truth of the Divine, is kind of,
365720	368000	it takes some inspiration from Speaker for the Dead.
368000	373240	So I remember a long time ago, people would talk about Orson Scott Card on Twitter, and at first,
374640	377040	I kind of was inclined to disbelieve them,
377760	384040	mostly because I couldn't really reconcile the fact that the same person who wrote this work,
384040	390920	which is fundamentally about the importance of understanding someone or something that is very different from you,
391400	398720	with this incredible homophobic bigot. And it's not that this guy just has some bad Twitter opinions,
399000	406200	he openly advocates against gay and trans people, and he uses his not inconsiderable wealth to do so.
406200	410240	And unlike Joanne, he, for the most part, has the good sense to keep his bullshit off Twitter,
410840	412400	but
412400	418480	he is still mostly on his bullshit, and was on Ben Shapiro's channel as recently as two months ago.
418720	421240	Orson Scott Card is still alive, and
421760	430080	there is a difference between a dead author that maybe has a checkered past, and a living one who is using their
430080	434480	not inconsiderable wealth and power to advocate against marginalized groups.
434480	439440	And this is one of the most insidious aspects of J.K. Rowling doing what she's doing.
439560	445440	She knows that because of her wealth and influence, she's going to be believed more than,
445720	450000	you know, the lived experience of trans people and decades and decades of medical research.
450000	456400	And I know there are a lot of people who are perfectly willing to compartmentalize, and again, I see
456920	462160	separate art from the artist constantly. And you know what? That's fine. You know what? You do you. Again,
462160	464160	this discussion is not for you.
464320	467720	This is for the people who are trying to figure out how to reconcile
468120	471560	having Harry Potter in their past and in their lives with
471600	477360	the way she is wielding her power. And sort of the way that Orson Scott Card's hope in bigotry has
477480	482280	influenced the way that I read the Ender series, I think people kind of know that
482840	490320	knowing this about the author is going to affect how they read and engage with the Harry Potter series.
490600	497280	And if it was formative for them, if it was a big part of their childhood or adolescence, or even if it is still a big
497280	498840	part of your life,
498840	505640	that is going to influence the way you remember it or the way you experience it. And while you can absolutely
506200	509360	control the way you read or engage with a text,
509640	517160	you cannot control the way an author uses their money and influence. Even case in point, right now I am using my,
517160	518400	you know,
518400	526040	relative extreme micro influence to advocate against what J.K. Rowling is advocating for.
526200	528200	And if you disagree with me,
528800	530200	bye,
530200	532200	Felicia.
532400	538720	See, normally I work off a script, so this is very unnatural for me. As you can see, I like my ring light and my
539680	545640	degree over there. See, I'm a professional. I know for a lot of people there would be no forgiveness for them and I
546160	549120	can understand that. I think on some level I
550000	553480	would have to agree. But as it stands right now, all signs point to
553840	557240	this is where her train is going, that she's not going to change.
557240	564520	What is probably going to happen is she and her social circle is going to become more and more insular and she's going to
564520	568000	distance herself from people that she used to work with, like
568440	574400	the entire cast of the Harry Potter movies. And she's gonna get love-bombed by not only people who agree with her,
574400	576760	but people who probably have much more
577600	583520	far-right beliefs about trans people than even Rowling does. I have seen people argue that
584040	586040	once a text is in the world,
586360	593040	regardless of how much the author tries to influence people's reading of it once it's out there,
594080	600080	the text no longer belongs to them. And on a certain level, I do agree with that.
600080	604160	However, there are few creators that are as deeply entrenched in the world
604160	607440	they created as J.K. Rowling. Like, Ezzie, for instance,
607440	614600	let's say that George Lucas goes off the deep end and, like, chains himself to a Confederate statue that is slated for removal.
615880	622120	He's not really got anything to do with Star Wars anymore, but J.K. Rowling is Harry Potter.
622560	629720	She has made sure of that. And this is sort of a unique franchise in that you can't really consume and advocate for it
630080	637160	without indirectly doing the same for the author. And she knows this, which is why she's kind of decided
637360	643480	that this is the hill she's going to die on. She has a lot of power and influence, especially in the UK,
643840	648800	where shameless turfery is a lot more normalized than it is here in the U.S.
648800	652560	It's like the one thing that we are slightly less shitty about.
653600	659680	Winning? So here's the thing. If you, like, I don't know, never watch another Harry Potter movie again,
660160	666560	or sell your books to a used bookstore or something, that isn't really going to change anything.
666560	674320	Like, the number of consumers who are going to change their habits because of this thing is vanishingly small.
674320	681040	But whenever you take the concept of death of the author and basically proclaim that the text belongs to the reader now,
681040	688440	this is a way to reconcile your own personal, emotional attachment to this text, and that's fine.
688720	697720	However, you can't really cry death of the author and keep consuming Harry Potter stuff without supporting her wealth and influence.
697720	707200	And honestly, what she is doing does scare me, you know, like such to the point that I would, you know, make a YouTube video in my pajamas
708240	712680	reacting to the discussion of death of the author as it pertains to J.K. Rowling.
713080	727560	I think we're at an important crossroads where trans visibility is concerned, and we could either go forward or we could see the loss of what gains we have made.
728320	732960	And I don't want to think about what going backward might look like.
733000	735360	And like, terfery is a spectrum.
735800	744880	There are a lot of gender critical people, that's what they call themselves, that are, they know they are transphobic.
744880	748400	They have like terrible, you know, terminologies that they use.
748760	751240	They actively try to do harm for people.
751240	752440	They know what they're doing.
752680	759720	But Rowling is in this camp where I don't think she believes she's transphobic.
759800	766040	I think she genuinely believes that she's doing the right thing, which is why I don't think she's going to change.
766080	769120	So again, with this discussion, we are dealing with two separate issues.
769360	773720	How do you personally reconcile your relationship to this text?
774120	778000	And how do we as consumers interact with J.K. Rowling's intellectual property?
778280	782720	Obviously, if Harry Potter never meant anything to you, you keep doing you, boo.
782880	784720	Advocate against her positions.
784760	786720	You can try to reason with her on Twitter.
787800	788280	Good luck.
788280	798520	But if you cry death of the author and decide to ignore the author, yet you continue to consume her product, that is a form of empowerment.
798720	805200	Rowling only has this massive platform because of her influence, which comes from her creative output.
805360	812320	And the only way her influence is reduced is if businesses decide that she's too toxic to be associated with.
812480	825840	Now, I think in a weird way, the case of J.K. Rowling, you know, suddenly making this heel term is a pretty extreme case because there are very, very few authors in this world with the kind of influence that she has.
826080	837480	So if Harry Potter means so much to you that you genuinely can't let it go and you desire to compartmentalize the author with the text, then go ahead.
837720	848280	But, like, don't try to morally justify it if you understand that Joanne's position and influence comes from the fact that so many people consume her text.
848320	854120	So normally I might advocate for a sort of wishy-washy, it's your own personal relationship to the text thing.
854480	858200	But in this case, I don't think that death of the author can apply.
858480	863440	The fact that she is so deeply entwined in the world she created is why she has so much power.
863640	866720	So from an academic standpoint, it's fine.
866840	869120	That's why death of the author exists.
869160	876480	It's supposed to be this, you know, emotionless, manly way of engaging with texts.
876520	885440	But from an ethical standpoint, if you really don't want to support the author, you might just need to let Harry Potter go.
885680	890840	And I feel like what I'm seeing is a lot of people who are not ready to do that.
891160	900280	Again, to draw the point of comparison with me and Orson Scott Card, I can accept that Orson Scott Card was very formative and influential to me.
900840	905440	But I'm past the point where I'm willing to consume or enjoy his work.
905760	909640	And I cannot encourage others in good conscience to do the same.
909800	917240	So I know that this kind of comes off like I'm saying, boycott Harry Potter because the author has some bad Twitter opinions.
917720	923560	But I think that if this is an issue that you really care about, you kind of have to.
923720	927600	And to be clear, I don't want to insinuate that it's either or.
927640	938520	Either the author has a spotless past and is completely unproblematic and therefore it's OK to consume their work or cancel J.K.
938520	940880	Rowling. That is not what I'm saying, because again, J.K.
940880	944880	Rowling is a pretty extreme case because she's so famous.
944920	955040	And I don't think I can overstate the amount of harm she is doing right now by tweeting this dangerous crap to her 14 million followers.
955080	961560	She is normalizing misinformation and making it genuinely dangerous for trans people to exist.
961920	963560	And that makes me mad.
964760	965760	I don't like it.
966320	967320	Mm hmm.
969200	974000	People in the last video asking, do you really drink that much Canada Dry diet?
974680	975680	Yes. Yes, I do.
975840	983640	So, again, I think we're kind of dealing with a strange and unique case of author doing real harm who thinks she is doing good,
984440	993080	but is the owner of a text that is arguably the most popular franchise that has happened in the last 30 years.
993080	994640	That is what the issue is here.
994640	999680	And that is why I felt it was important enough to even talk about to wield my power.
999680	1003280	And I, an author who I'm not even published yet.
1006160	1007600	Actually, because here's the thing.
1007600	1014760	I actually honestly and I don't again, I don't like talking about my personal feelings because I like to pretend that I don't have any.
1015120	1025800	But I honestly, I kind of was waffling on whether or not I should even say something because I have a book coming out in like two weeks.
1025800	1035720	And as a debut author, it maybe isn't the best idea to publicly advocate one of the most successful living authors.
1035720	1043360	And I don't want it to sound like it's this moral hoity toity thing, but it kind of just was the right thing to do.
1043400	1044520	And I know it is.
1044520	1046000	I had so much coffee today.
1046000	1046840	My hands are shaking.
1046840	1047840	Oh, why did I do it?
1048160	1053000	And I think in a situation like this, it isn't just about death of the author.
1053000	1055400	It it is about advocacy.
1055400	1061000	And what she is doing right now is normalizing some really insidious stuff.
1061040	1062920	So, yeah, I don't really know how to end this.
1062920	1065840	Obviously, I kind of put this together on the fly.
1066440	1068040	She's still trending on Twitter.
1068040	1069280	She's been trending all day.
1069760	1072040	I don't know. Stop buying Harry Potter stuff.
1072240	1073920	Donkey Kong says trans rights.
1075480	1076080	Good night.
