1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
I guess I'm going to do something kind of uncharacteristic and pop off a hot take

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:13,080
without thinking about it for like six months. So I've been seeing a lot of people on Twitter, a lot of which are in my mentions,

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:20,920
discussing death of the author and asking how we should apply this to

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,720
our newly out and proud

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,600
incredibly transphobic JK Rowling. The warning signs were there.

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:38,240
It kind of began, it was like a few months ago when people were noticing that she was liking some really hardcore

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,600
right-wing

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,520
TERF-y tweets. TERF meaning trans-exclusionary radical feminist. Like I'm not wild about the term for accuracy reasons,

9
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,160
but just so we're clear, it is not a slur.

10
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:58,360
So anyway, she was liking some TERF-y stuff and then she started retweeting it. What's the step beyond showing your slip? It's like

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,480
her dress got caught in her underwear,

12
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,440
with the most hilarious

13
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,120
oops

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,120
of a tweet that

15
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:16,440
has ever maybe happened with someone with more than a million followers, and then she just doubled down from there.

16
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:24,360
And so like just within the last 24 hours, we have her comparing providing gender services to young people with gay conversion therapy,

17
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:31,880
linking to fringe weirdos and medium posts, like it's like some authority. And as is the case with so many transphobes,

18
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,440
she is arguing against a position that nobody actually has.

19
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,440
No one is saying chromosomes are not real, Joanne.

20
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,240
Now if we wanted to get into that, that is its whole other thing, but suffice to say that

21
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,160
biological sex is in fact

22
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:56,800
much more complicated than the simple X and Y chromosome. Trans YouTuber Riley Dennis did a video on the subject a few years ago,

23
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,240
so I'll go ahead and link to that, and I'll let her speak to that issue. That's not what we're talking about.

24
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:09,560
We're talking about death of the author. So death of the author, when the author, a very successful and wealthy author, outs themselves as a

25
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:18,280
bigot. Now, it is entirely possible that you do not care, and you genuinely do believe in separating art from the artist.

26
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,280
And if that is the case,

27
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,600
you fly free, little bird. This video is not for you. Stop watching now. Go enjoy

28
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:33,480
Fantastic Beasts 5 or whatever. But here's the problem with even applying death of the author to this discussion, is

29
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,680
basically, you are trying to find an academic solution for an emotional and ethical

30
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,840
problem. As I said on my video on the subject,

31
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:50,360
I personally believe that you can't really practice death of the author in its purest pure form. If for no other reason than

32
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:55,080
if you are in any kind of like discourse setting, be it academic or

33
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,760
Twitter, other people aren't going to really allow it.

34
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,720
They will bring the author into it, and that is going to introduce subconscious biases,

35
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,040
which is of course going to affect your reading of the text, no matter how hard you try to be

36
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,840
unbiased or whatever. So you can try to practice death of the author, but as long as you're engaged in a community,

37
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,600
other people are probably going to bring the author in, whether you want them to or not.

38
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,080
So I think that part of the reason why there are a lot of really confused emotions about

39
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,560
J.K. Rowling going hard turf, is because so many people have an attachment to Harry Potter.

40
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,400
It was a part of their childhood. It was a part of their adolescence. It is deeply, deeply

41
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,640
important to some people. Maybe like 10 or 20 years ago, I would have been like smug about this,

42
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,600
but I feel for the Harry Potter fans of the world. Harry Potter, like I didn't hate it,

43
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,120
but like Harry Potter was never my thing, obviously. I never talk about it on this channel.

44
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:59,000
You know, like I read the books. I even, I even gave it a shout out in my book, which I'm kind of regretting now.

45
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,640
Oops. I just needed a book that came out in 2007.

46
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,920
But Harry Potter was blowing up around the same times that Lord of the Rings was having its resurgence in popularity, and the

47
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:17,000
relationship of the author to that text is a completely different discussion and one we are not going to have here. Tolkien has been dead

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,680
for 50 years. He's not on Twitter, but J.K. Rowling is not only alive,

49
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,240
she's also relatively young and

50
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:31,280
has tremendous power and influence and a lot of followers and a lot of money and a

51
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,960
lot of control of her intellectual property. And I've seen a lot of takes and I don't really want to address them all,

52
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:43,480
but basically you can try to be rational about the whole thing and be like, don't support her financially,

53
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,120
but the reality is it's a lot more complicated than that.

54
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,800
So while on some level there is a sort of broader political discussion on how she wields her influence,

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,400
really when people want to talk about death of the author, in this instance, they want to

56
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,720
reconcile their personal feelings about Harry Potter with the author.

57
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,880
Like, how do I reconcile the fact that the author of this series is using her power to do such incredible harm,

58
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:18,280
all while genuinely believing that she is doing the right thing, with the fact that this series was so formative for so many people?

59
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,520
How do you reconcile this?

60
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,920
The answer to that is, I don't know.

61
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:30,600
But I have kind of touched on this subject before a long time ago, and I think you can find it on my other channel.

62
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
I did a video

63
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,440
that kind of touched on a similar topic about Orson Scott Card,

64
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,160
who is the author of Ender's Game.

65
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,520
And it wasn't my, like, Harry Potter or anything, because I was older when I read it,

66
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:53,040
but it was extremely, well, formative for me, especially as a professional author. In particular, the sequel to Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead,

67
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,560
was extremely influential, and if you're familiar with it, you'll be like,

68
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:04,960
ah, I can see that. Like, even the title of the Axiom's End sequel, which is called Truth of the Divine, is kind of,

69
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,000
it takes some inspiration from Speaker for the Dead.

70
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,240
So I remember a long time ago, people would talk about Orson Scott Card on Twitter, and at first,

71
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,040
I kind of was inclined to disbelieve them,

72
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:24,040
mostly because I couldn't really reconcile the fact that the same person who wrote this work,

73
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:30,920
which is fundamentally about the importance of understanding someone or something that is very different from you,

74
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:38,720
with this incredible homophobic bigot. And it's not that this guy just has some bad Twitter opinions,

75
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,200
he openly advocates against gay and trans people, and he uses his not inconsiderable wealth to do so.

76
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,240
And unlike Joanne, he, for the most part, has the good sense to keep his bullshit off Twitter,

77
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,400
but

78
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,480
he is still mostly on his bullshit, and was on Ben Shapiro's channel as recently as two months ago.

79
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,240
Orson Scott Card is still alive, and

80
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:10,080
there is a difference between a dead author that maybe has a checkered past, and a living one who is using their

81
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,480
not inconsiderable wealth and power to advocate against marginalized groups.

82
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:19,440
And this is one of the most insidious aspects of J.K. Rowling doing what she's doing.

83
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,440
She knows that because of her wealth and influence, she's going to be believed more than,

84
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,000
you know, the lived experience of trans people and decades and decades of medical research.

85
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,400
And I know there are a lot of people who are perfectly willing to compartmentalize, and again, I see

86
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:42,160
separate art from the artist constantly. And you know what? That's fine. You know what? You do you. Again,

87
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,160
this discussion is not for you.

88
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,720
This is for the people who are trying to figure out how to reconcile

89
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,560
having Harry Potter in their past and in their lives with

90
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,360
the way she is wielding her power. And sort of the way that Orson Scott Card's hope in bigotry has

91
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,280
influenced the way that I read the Ender series, I think people kind of know that

92
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:10,320
knowing this about the author is going to affect how they read and engage with the Harry Potter series.

93
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:17,280
And if it was formative for them, if it was a big part of their childhood or adolescence, or even if it is still a big

94
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,840
part of your life,

95
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:25,640
that is going to influence the way you remember it or the way you experience it. And while you can absolutely

96
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,360
control the way you read or engage with a text,

97
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:37,160
you cannot control the way an author uses their money and influence. Even case in point, right now I am using my,

98
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,400
you know,

99
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:46,040
relative extreme micro influence to advocate against what J.K. Rowling is advocating for.

100
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
And if you disagree with me,

101
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,200
bye,

102
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Felicia.

103
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:58,720
See, normally I work off a script, so this is very unnatural for me. As you can see, I like my ring light and my

104
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,640
degree over there. See, I'm a professional. I know for a lot of people there would be no forgiveness for them and I

105
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,120
can understand that. I think on some level I

106
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,480
would have to agree. But as it stands right now, all signs point to

107
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,240
this is where her train is going, that she's not going to change.

108
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:24,520
What is probably going to happen is she and her social circle is going to become more and more insular and she's going to

109
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,000
distance herself from people that she used to work with, like

110
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:34,400
the entire cast of the Harry Potter movies. And she's gonna get love-bombed by not only people who agree with her,

111
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,760
but people who probably have much more

112
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,520
far-right beliefs about trans people than even Rowling does. I have seen people argue that

113
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,040
once a text is in the world,

114
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:53,040
regardless of how much the author tries to influence people's reading of it once it's out there,

115
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,080
the text no longer belongs to them. And on a certain level, I do agree with that.

116
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,160
However, there are few creators that are as deeply entrenched in the world

117
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,440
they created as J.K. Rowling. Like, Ezzie, for instance,

118
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:14,600
let's say that George Lucas goes off the deep end and, like, chains himself to a Confederate statue that is slated for removal.

119
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:22,120
He's not really got anything to do with Star Wars anymore, but J.K. Rowling is Harry Potter.

120
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:29,720
She has made sure of that. And this is sort of a unique franchise in that you can't really consume and advocate for it

121
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:37,160
without indirectly doing the same for the author. And she knows this, which is why she's kind of decided

122
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,480
that this is the hill she's going to die on. She has a lot of power and influence, especially in the UK,

123
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,800
where shameless turfery is a lot more normalized than it is here in the U.S.

124
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,560
It's like the one thing that we are slightly less shitty about.

125
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,680
Winning? So here's the thing. If you, like, I don't know, never watch another Harry Potter movie again,

126
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:06,560
or sell your books to a used bookstore or something, that isn't really going to change anything.

127
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:14,320
Like, the number of consumers who are going to change their habits because of this thing is vanishingly small.

128
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:21,040
But whenever you take the concept of death of the author and basically proclaim that the text belongs to the reader now,

129
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:28,440
this is a way to reconcile your own personal, emotional attachment to this text, and that's fine.

130
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:37,720
However, you can't really cry death of the author and keep consuming Harry Potter stuff without supporting her wealth and influence.

131
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:47,200
And honestly, what she is doing does scare me, you know, like such to the point that I would, you know, make a YouTube video in my pajamas

132
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,680
reacting to the discussion of death of the author as it pertains to J.K. Rowling.

133
00:11:53,080 --> 00:12:07,560
I think we're at an important crossroads where trans visibility is concerned, and we could either go forward or we could see the loss of what gains we have made.

134
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,960
And I don't want to think about what going backward might look like.

135
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,360
And like, terfery is a spectrum.

136
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:24,880
There are a lot of gender critical people, that's what they call themselves, that are, they know they are transphobic.

137
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,400
They have like terrible, you know, terminologies that they use.

138
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,240
They actively try to do harm for people.

139
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,440
They know what they're doing.

140
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:39,720
But Rowling is in this camp where I don't think she believes she's transphobic.

141
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:46,040
I think she genuinely believes that she's doing the right thing, which is why I don't think she's going to change.

142
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,120
So again, with this discussion, we are dealing with two separate issues.

143
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,720
How do you personally reconcile your relationship to this text?

144
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,000
And how do we as consumers interact with J.K. Rowling's intellectual property?

145
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,720
Obviously, if Harry Potter never meant anything to you, you keep doing you, boo.

146
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,720
Advocate against her positions.

147
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,720
You can try to reason with her on Twitter.

148
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,280
Good luck.

149
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:18,520
But if you cry death of the author and decide to ignore the author, yet you continue to consume her product, that is a form of empowerment.

150
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:25,200
Rowling only has this massive platform because of her influence, which comes from her creative output.

151
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:32,320
And the only way her influence is reduced is if businesses decide that she's too toxic to be associated with.

152
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:45,840
Now, I think in a weird way, the case of J.K. Rowling, you know, suddenly making this heel term is a pretty extreme case because there are very, very few authors in this world with the kind of influence that she has.

153
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:57,480
So if Harry Potter means so much to you that you genuinely can't let it go and you desire to compartmentalize the author with the text, then go ahead.

154
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:08,280
But, like, don't try to morally justify it if you understand that Joanne's position and influence comes from the fact that so many people consume her text.

155
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,120
So normally I might advocate for a sort of wishy-washy, it's your own personal relationship to the text thing.

156
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,200
But in this case, I don't think that death of the author can apply.

157
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,440
The fact that she is so deeply entwined in the world she created is why she has so much power.

158
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,720
So from an academic standpoint, it's fine.

159
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,120
That's why death of the author exists.

160
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:36,480
It's supposed to be this, you know, emotionless, manly way of engaging with texts.

161
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:45,440
But from an ethical standpoint, if you really don't want to support the author, you might just need to let Harry Potter go.

162
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,840
And I feel like what I'm seeing is a lot of people who are not ready to do that.

163
00:14:51,160 --> 00:15:00,280
Again, to draw the point of comparison with me and Orson Scott Card, I can accept that Orson Scott Card was very formative and influential to me.

164
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:05,440
But I'm past the point where I'm willing to consume or enjoy his work.

165
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,640
And I cannot encourage others in good conscience to do the same.

166
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:17,240
So I know that this kind of comes off like I'm saying, boycott Harry Potter because the author has some bad Twitter opinions.

167
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:23,560
But I think that if this is an issue that you really care about, you kind of have to.

168
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,600
And to be clear, I don't want to insinuate that it's either or.

169
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:38,520
Either the author has a spotless past and is completely unproblematic and therefore it's OK to consume their work or cancel J.K.

170
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,880
Rowling. That is not what I'm saying, because again, J.K.

171
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,880
Rowling is a pretty extreme case because she's so famous.

172
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:55,040
And I don't think I can overstate the amount of harm she is doing right now by tweeting this dangerous crap to her 14 million followers.

173
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:01,560
She is normalizing misinformation and making it genuinely dangerous for trans people to exist.

174
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,560
And that makes me mad.

175
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,760
I don't like it.

176
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,320
Mm hmm.

177
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,000
People in the last video asking, do you really drink that much Canada Dry diet?

178
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,680
Yes. Yes, I do.

179
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:23,640
So, again, I think we're kind of dealing with a strange and unique case of author doing real harm who thinks she is doing good,

180
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:33,080
but is the owner of a text that is arguably the most popular franchise that has happened in the last 30 years.

181
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,640
That is what the issue is here.

182
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,680
And that is why I felt it was important enough to even talk about to wield my power.

183
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,280
And I, an author who I'm not even published yet.

184
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,600
Actually, because here's the thing.

185
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:54,760
I actually honestly and I don't again, I don't like talking about my personal feelings because I like to pretend that I don't have any.

186
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:05,800
But I honestly, I kind of was waffling on whether or not I should even say something because I have a book coming out in like two weeks.

187
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:15,720
And as a debut author, it maybe isn't the best idea to publicly advocate one of the most successful living authors.

188
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:23,360
And I don't want it to sound like it's this moral hoity toity thing, but it kind of just was the right thing to do.

189
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,520
And I know it is.

190
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,000
I had so much coffee today.

191
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,840
My hands are shaking.

192
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,840
Oh, why did I do it?

193
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,000
And I think in a situation like this, it isn't just about death of the author.

194
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,400
It it is about advocacy.

195
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:41,000
And what she is doing right now is normalizing some really insidious stuff.

196
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,920
So, yeah, I don't really know how to end this.

197
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,840
Obviously, I kind of put this together on the fly.

198
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,040
She's still trending on Twitter.

199
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,280
She's been trending all day.

200
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,040
I don't know. Stop buying Harry Potter stuff.

201
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,920
Donkey Kong says trans rights.

202
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,080
Good night.
