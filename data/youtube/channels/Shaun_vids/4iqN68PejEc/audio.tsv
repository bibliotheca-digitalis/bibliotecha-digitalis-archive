0	1320	Hello there.
1320	5820	So okay, I know I said I was burnt out on Stefan Molyneux,
5820	10020	but the other day I happened to watch Star Wars The Force Awakens again,
10020	14360	and I couldn't resist going to take another look at Stefan's video about it.
14360	19600	In my first video about Stefan, I included a clip of him talking about Star Wars
19600	24360	and what he sees as its anti-family, anti-male message.
24480	30220	Now the purpose of that clip was to demonstrate what I see as Stefan's anti-woman ideology
30220	36360	affecting his approach to art, as well as, to a certain degree, everything else.
36360	41460	So the purpose of this video is, in part, to expand on that point.
41460	46420	Now the idea that one's particular world view colours one's understanding of art
46420	49020	is certainly not specific to Stefan.
49020	50520	It happens to everyone.
50540	55480	You know, I have my own biases and leanings that I bring with me when I watch a movie,
55480	61080	or read a book, or whatever, so I'm not criticising Stefan just for having opinions.
61080	67280	And I'm generally a fan of what we'll call unconventional interpretations of art.
67280	71220	At the least, I think they're usually fun to think about.
71220	76480	I've seen it argued, for instance, that Hamlet is a gay character.
76480	81840	And there's certain things in the play one can point to that could be interpreted as supporting this.
81840	86480	His rejection of Ophelia, his affection for Horatio, and so on,
86480	90140	and as well as certain lines of dialogue here and there.
90140	94340	However, one needs to be careful with these sorts of interpretations.
94340	99040	It's easy to cross over from speculations to declarations.
99040	105440	There's a line between speculating that Hamlet could be gay, and declaring Hamlet to be gay.
105440	109600	And there's a much bigger line between speculating that Hamlet could be gay,
109600	116700	and declaring Hamlet to be gay based on the scene where he has sex with Horatio, which doesn't happen.
116700	119900	You know, you've started misconstruing the text at that point,
119900	124900	and you've entered into the realm of just being objectively wrong about things.
124900	130900	And I mention this now because Stefan makes a few claims about the characters and events of The Force Awakens
130900	138260	that I think go beyond individual interpretation, and end up just being directly contradicted by the movie.
138260	140260	So that's my aim with this video.
140260	147760	I'm gonna highlight the times I think Stefan is incorrect, and present a counter-interpretation of the material.
147760	154860	But before we talk about The Force Awakens directly, we'll start with a few thoughts on the fantasy genre.
154860	159760	In most epic stories, parents are conveniently removed from the home,
159760	165260	allowing the young hero to easily slide under the tutelage of a warrior master,
165260	170160	and learn the ways of obedience and drama and war.
170160	174160	In the original Star Wars, family life was portrayed as mundane and humiliating,
174160	181220	as a young Luke Skywalker was expected to work productively on his uncle's farm.
181220	184660	Historically, epics tend to be fantasies.
184660	191560	That feed the murderlust of the young, who were needed by the aristocracy to wage war on their behalf.
191560	198660	The word adventure basically means, learn the dehumanizing joy of murdering for your masters.
198660	205660	In these stories, boring parents are replaced by wise, hypnotic elders who teach young men,
205660	210360	and now young women, the excitement and joys of war.
210360	215960	This conveniently allows the authority of the state to displace the authority of parents,
215960	223060	transitioning young men from pimply-faced teens to hardened warriors serving their economic and political masters.
223060	227860	Hey, who wants to work for a banker when you can kill for a banker?
229360	232760	So Stefan starts out with something that I agree with here.
232760	238560	He is correct that the fantasy genre usually takes the protagonist's parents out of the picture,
238560	242160	either before the story or during the opening act.
242160	247660	But he claims this is down to some anti-family and or pro-violence message.
247660	250460	You know, freed from their family constraints,
250460	256160	the protagonist can now go off killing people under the guidance of an older warrior.
256160	258660	And I can't really agree with that interpretation.
258660	262560	I think the real reason is mainly just narrative in nature, you know.
262560	268060	Removing the parents is often a necessary step to force the protagonist into action.
268060	273960	If Luke, for instance, had stayed on the farm and not followed Obi-Wan, he wouldn't have a story.
273960	278260	Nobody wants to watch Luke work a boring farm job for two hours.
278260	283960	Regardless, I think Star Wars is the wrong series to make this point about, to be honest.
283960	289460	Neither of Luke's masters, Obi-Wan or Yoda, teach Luke to attack anyone.
289460	293860	In fact, they seem to prefer non-violent means of resolving conflicts.
293860	297560	You can't win, but there are alternatives to fighting.
297560	301760	A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense.
302360	303860	Never attack.
303860	310860	Obi-Wan sneaks his way past stormtroopers that he could kill, and he even allows himself to be killed.
310860	317860	And the culmination of Luke's story has him defeating the Emperor by explicitly refusing to fight.
317860	323560	This seems more of an anti-violence message to me, really, rather than a pro-violence one.
324160	325660	In the new film, we meet Finn.
325660	329960	Now, Finn is a stormtrooper who was cloned, raised without parents,
329960	335160	and trained to be a mindless, obedient, killing robot pretty much from birth.
335160	337560	As an adult, he has a strong conscience.
337560	344260	He is engaging, charming, funny, enthusiastic, and, for obvious reasons, mindlessly horny.
344260	350960	In other words, despite being raised in conditions that your average African child soldier would find utterly horrifying,
350960	356160	he is a perfectly well-adjusted, mentally healthy, courageous, he's a good team player,
356160	359660	he's socially poised, warm, and funny.
359660	363460	This mirrors the fantasy of Harry Potter, who was also endlessly abused as a child,
363460	370660	and shares most of this eerie, steroid mental health characteristics that Finn has.
370660	379860	This denial of the effects of childhood trauma is the fundamental reason for the consistent re-emergence of intergalactic evil,
379860	384860	not just in Star Wars, but in all these stories, and in the world as well.
385660	389160	Intergalactic evil? Yikes.
389660	391860	What does Stefan know that we don't?
392360	394860	So, a few minor points about Finn here.
394860	399860	Firstly, Stefan says that he's a clone, but he isn't.
400860	401860	I'm a stormtrooper.
403860	406860	Like all of him, I was taken from a family I'll never know.
407860	411860	Secondly, when is Finn mindlessly horny?
411860	414860	The Force Awakens is rather sexless, to be honest.
414860	419860	The only thing I can think of here is when Finn asks Rey if she has a boyfriend.
419860	423860	But that's about as far as the movie takes that romance, to be honest.
423860	425860	He's hardly mindlessly horny.
426360	429860	So anyway, the effects of childhood trauma.
429860	437860	Why don't fantasy films with orphaned or abused protagonists show the negative effects of such neglect and or abuse?
438360	440860	Well, for a start, sometimes they do.
441360	446360	You know, I'd argue that The Force Awakens does, even, but we'll get to that later.
446860	450860	For now, let's carry on and answer the question anyway, for funsies.
451360	454860	So I'd argue that, instead of not showing these effects,
454860	460860	fantasy stories like Star Wars and Harry Potter generally do have them, just at a reduced level.
460860	467860	You know, it's there, but it's not generally enough to prevent the protagonist from progressing through the story.
467860	469860	And the reason why is in the name, really.
470360	473860	Fantasy. These works are escapist fiction.
474860	482860	You know, they show, at first, average protagonists with mundane lives who are suddenly thrust into some grand adventure.
482860	486860	You know, you thought you were just some kid with a horrible family and a boring life.
486860	492360	Well, no, it turns out you're actually rich and famous, and you've got magical powers.
492860	495360	And, yes, it's unrealistic.
495860	498860	But it's a fantasy. It's meant to be unrealistic.
499360	503360	Nobody wants to watch Harry Potter and the Crippling Anxiety,
503360	509360	where we read about a non-magical Harry Potter who tries to work through his abandonment issues.
509860	512360	Actually, I'm lying. I would totally read that.
512860	519360	But anyway, fantasy presents an escape from an often boring and upsetting reality,
519360	521860	and I don't think it's a negative escape at all.
521860	524860	We need fantasies, or we'd all go insane.
525360	529860	Now, much has been made of the casting of a woman as Rey, the new Luke.
530360	534860	It is somehow considered to be a break from convention.
535360	542360	While her, I don't know, let's just say character, is in fact perfectly boring and predictable,
542360	548860	a hyper-empowered, pearly feminist robot of implausibly infinite abilities.
549860	555860	Rey is what by now has become a yawningly cliched stock character,
555860	559860	the all-competent ingenue, or the ACI.
559860	562860	Now, the ACI starts off as a low-status character,
563360	567360	whose endless and escalating waves of superlative competence
567360	571860	quickly wash away any and all hints of reality or limitations,
571860	575860	a superwoman fetish of automatic and unearned abilities,
575860	581860	who ends up as little more than a delusional, man-gina him to bottomless female vanity.
583360	588360	Rey, this film's ACI, turns out to be fantastic at hand-to-hand combat,
588360	591860	flying various spaceships, sword fighting, using the Force,
591860	594860	CGI cliff climbing, to name just a few.
595360	599860	So then, Rey as an all-competent ingenue,
599860	604860	or, to use a less annoying term, Rey as a Mary Sue character.
604860	608360	Now, I've seen this criticism of The Force Awakens a fair few times,
608360	609860	and not just from Stefan.
610360	613360	So, is Rey a Mary Sue character?
613860	619360	A Mary Sue here meaning a sort of hyper-competent, seemingly perfect character
619360	622360	who has extensive and unrealistic skills.
622360	625860	Well, to answer that, we first need to answer another question.
625860	628860	What's the line that separates a Mary Sue character
629360	633360	and just any protagonist of escapist fantasy fiction?
633860	637360	You know, for instance, is Luke Skywalker a Mary Sue?
637360	643360	So let's think about this further by running down the list of things that Stefan says Rey is fantastic at.
643860	646360	Firstly, hand-to-hand combat.
646360	651360	Rey also regularly fights grown men trained from birth in the ways of combat,
651860	653360	and wins easily.
653860	654860	She weighs...
655360	657360	maybe a little over a buck ten,
657360	661860	and regularly takes down multiple 200-pound jacked-up monster warriors.
662360	663860	Uh, but when?
664360	669860	There's only one time Rey fights hand-to-hand in the movie other than the concluding lightsaber duel,
670360	673360	and that's when she fights these two dudes in the junkyard.
673360	675360	And if I were being nitpicky here,
675360	680360	I'd say it's technically not really hand-to-hand combat because she's armed with a big metal staff.
680860	682860	She never fights unarmed in the movie.
683360	686860	She's always got a blaster, a staff, or a lightsaber.
687360	690360	And have you seen videos of Daisy Ridley's workouts?
690360	691360	Now, I have.
691860	694360	Purely for research purposes, you understand.
694360	696360	And she's hardly a weak person.
696360	701360	I mean, I'm over 200 pounds and I wouldn't want her hitting me in the head with a big metal pole.
701860	703360	And let's think about these guys.
703360	705360	Like, who are these guys?
705360	707360	They're wearing hoods and masks.
707360	709360	We don't even know what species they are.
709860	711860	We don't even know if they're men, actually.
711860	714360	They could be anything under there for all we know.
714860	716360	And they're unarmed.
716860	721360	And I think Stefan missed this, but this scene is played as a joke.
721360	724360	Finn sees Rey under attack and runs over to help,
724360	727860	and halfway there, he realizes he doesn't have to.
728360	730860	Now, this scene is giving some information to the audience.
730860	733860	You know, Rey knows how to fight with a staff.
733860	737860	But there's also some comedy in Finn's unnecessary dash to help.
738360	742860	And Finn's surprise that he doesn't need to help out only works as a joke
742860	749360	if the audience has an understanding that it is a rare thing for women to be able to defend themselves
749360	750860	in the way that Rey can.
751360	757360	Anyway, next up, Rey is fantastic at flying spaceships and fixing the Falcon.
757860	763360	Rey, on the other hand, has spent her youth picking up garbage, Wally-style,
763360	768860	but is able to pull off the most ridiculous aerial maneuvers on an unfamiliar spaceship,
768860	772360	outflying professional pilots trained from childhood.
772860	776860	So, Rey is apparently fantastic at flying various spaceships.
777860	784860	Now, the only spaceship that Rey flies on screen, if we don't count this little speeder thing, is the Falcon.
784860	789360	Now, first off, Stefan says that Rey has never flown a spaceship before.
789860	795360	So, you see, boys trained from birth to fight are terrible at fighting.
795860	801360	But girls who've never flown a spaceship are immediate experts who can outfly relentlessly trained pilots.
801360	805360	But this is directly contradicted by a line of dialogue in the movie.
811360	818360	So, Rey has flown ships before, and Stefan says that the Millennium Falcon is an unfamiliar spaceship for Rey.
818360	822360	But I don't know why, because she seems to know a lot about it.
822360	824360	Ah! What about that ship?
824860	826360	That one's garbage!
826860	830860	Gunner position is down there! This ship hasn't flown in years!
831360	832860	Who had it? Duquesne?
832860	837360	I stole it. From Unkar Plutt. He stole it from the Irving boys who stole it from Duquesne.
837360	840360	Some moof milker put a compressor on the ignition line.
840360	844360	Unkar Plutt did. I thought it was a mistake too, but it's too much stress on the hyperdrive.
845360	849360	You see, Rey works for this guy, who she was left with as a child.
849360	854360	And he owns the Millennium Falcon, and that's how she knows about it.
854360	861360	Now, Stefan goes on to be annoyed about how Rey knows how to fix a problem with the Falcon, when Han didn't.
861360	868360	When standing with Han Solo at the controls of the Millennium Falcon, Rey fixes a problem that Han Solo cannot even identify.
868360	872360	She also goes below deck to repair its malfunctioning innards.
872360	874360	I mean, come on!
874360	878360	Han Solo flew and maintained the Millennium Falcon for decades!
878360	880360	Knew it inside and out!
880360	888360	Then this vapid ACI wanders in with no knowledge of the complex spacecraft and knows exactly what to do to fix problems.
890360	893360	But I have a couple of explanations for this.
893360	899360	First off, Rey is a scavenger who pokes around inside spaceships and strips them for parts.
899360	903360	So I guess I give you some knowledge about the mechanics of how spaceships work.
903360	911360	Secondly, the problem with the Falcon is to do with a modification that happened after Han had lost the Falcon.
911360	915360	You see, this guy, Rey's boss, made some of his own modifications.
915360	924360	So since Rey was there when whatever it was was modified, it stands to reason she'd know more about it than Han and know how to undo it.
925360	934360	Additionally here, I remember it being played for a joke in Empire that Han is not exactly a complete authority on how to fix the Falcon.
934360	938360	I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarised.
938360	940360	I'm afraid we'll have to replace it.
941360	943360	Well, of course I'll have to replace it.
944360	946360	Here. Chewie.
949360	951360	I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling.
952360	957360	Also, is Rey fantastic at flying the Falcon?
957360	961360	You know, the first thing she does when she takes off is crash it into the ground.
961360	965360	And then all of this stuff. And she can't get the shields up.
965360	968360	And then the TIE fighters are landing shots on the Falcon.
968360	973360	You see, this scene is the scene where the heroes learn to work together.
973360	975360	And they barely scrape by.
976360	981360	I think the movie's pretty good at showing that Rey and Finn are not that good at flying the Falcon, actually.
981360	985360	This is not how a fantastic pilot flies a ship.
985360	987360	Why didn't Stefan see any of this?
987360	990360	I guess all the feminism got in the way.
990360	993360	And there's a comparison to Luke to be made here.
993360	998360	Luke is a farmer. Why does he know how to fly an X-wing?
998360	1003360	And he seems to know all the controls and can identify problems with the ship.
1004360	1013360	You know, why is Stefan seemingly more willing to accept Luke as a skilled pilot and not Rey?
1013360	1016360	There's a similar amount of evidence for each.
1016360	1020360	Early on, we see them looking into the distance, dreaming of bigger things.
1020360	1025360	They play with something that lets the audience know they want to be a pilot.
1025360	1029360	There's a line of dialogue that lets the audience know they can fly.
1029360	1031360	We need a pilot!
1031360	1032360	We've got one!
1032360	1035360	You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot myself. We don't have to sit here and...
1035360	1037360	And that's about it.
1037360	1041360	There's even a disbelieving line from Han about their piloting abilities.
1041360	1044360	But who's gonna fly it, kid? You?
1044360	1045360	Where's the pilot?
1045360	1046360	I'm the pilot.
1046360	1047360	You?
1047360	1050360	Luke and Rey are very similar in this regard.
1050360	1054360	If we accept Luke as a pilot, we have to accept Rey as well.
1054360	1057360	Next up, sword fighting.
1057360	1065360	It is nowhere explained how Rey gains her miraculous abilities to take on a master swordsman.
1065360	1071360	Sword fighting is a pretty difficult and dangerous skill to acquire, as I remember from playing Macbeth.
1071360	1078360	Rey simply has the skill and credibly engages in combat against a master swordsman.
1078360	1084360	This is beyond ridiculous, and it is not a message I want my daughter to see.
1084360	1086360	So, sword fighting.
1086360	1092360	Rey shouldn't be a match for Kylo Ren, who is a stronger Force user and trained with a lightsaber.
1092360	1094360	And here's the thing.
1094360	1096360	She isn't really a match for him.
1096360	1100360	The odds have to be evened first in order to give her a shot.
1100360	1107360	Now, Stefan doesn't mention it here, but Kylo Ren has just killed his father, so he's emotionally all messed up.
1107360	1114360	And, he's been shot in the gut with a weapon that the movie has went out of its way to make seem extremely powerful.
1118360	1122360	Kylo is bleeding out, and he's punching himself in his wound.
1122360	1128360	And he's just fought another lightsaber fight, during which he was hit with a lightsaber.
1128360	1131360	Also, he's not trying to kill Rey either.
1131360	1134360	He just wants to turn her to the dark side.
1135360	1136360	You need a teacher!
1138360	1140360	I can show you the ways of the Force!
1141360	1147360	And despite all of these disadvantages, Kylo is still the dominant fighter throughout the duel.
1147360	1150360	Rey is running away from him for most of it.
1150360	1153360	And I think this fight is great here, actually.
1153360	1155360	There's some excellent acting throughout it.
1155360	1160360	Both Finn and Rey look genuinely scared of being hit by a lightsaber.
1160360	1165360	And it's clear just from the fight choreography who the superior fighter is.
1165360	1173360	Rey only wins because she remembers to use the Force in the end, which mirrors Luke using the Force at the end of A New Hope.
1173360	1176360	So, Rey isn't a fantastic sword fighter, really.
1176360	1184360	She only barely squeaks out a win over an emotionally distraught opponent who's bleeding out with multiple injuries.
1184360	1187360	But let's talk about her Force abilities.
1188360	1195360	Compare this effortless estrogen excellence to Luke Skywalker's slow grind to mastery.
1195360	1204360	Luke had to work for three long films to even begin mastering the Force, apprenticing at the gnarled feet of Yoda for months at a time.
1204360	1206360	Rey, on the other hand, she's a woman.
1206360	1211360	See, she merely has to frown for five or ten seconds in order to master the Force.
1211360	1219360	Well, Stefan's problem here is that he's comparing Rey's character arc over one film to Luke's character arc over three films.
1219360	1223360	You know, the new trilogy is only a third complete, remember?
1223360	1232360	And given that Rey meets Luke at the end of The Force Awakens, I'm guessing she's gonna be training with him in the next film, like Luke trained with Yoda in Empire.
1232360	1238360	Stefan should really be making comparisons to Luke's story in A New Hope.
1238360	1244360	Luke had no extensive training in that film. He just got shot by a little shooty ball thing for a while.
1244360	1250360	And he successfully uses the Force in that movie to make the killing shot on the Death Star.
1250360	1256360	And I'd like to make a point here, actually. What does Rey actually accomplish during the end of The Force Awakens?
1256360	1265360	You know, Luke Skywalker starts the movie as a farm boy and ends it by almost single-handedly destroying the Death Star and saving the entire Rebellion.
1265360	1271360	Rey has no effect on the destruction of Starkiller Base. That's all Han, Chewie, and Poe Dameron.
1271360	1278360	All she does is defeat Kylo Ren, but the planet's already collapsing at that point, so it doesn't really affect much, really.
1278360	1282360	Luke's untrained use of the Force is much more impactful than Rey's is.
1282360	1286360	Also, the Force is a magical power.
1286360	1295360	One can't really make declarations about whether or not a character would be able to use magic as proficiently as they do in a work of fiction,
1295360	1302360	because it's inherently unrealistic. We can only judge by the movie universe's internal rules.
1302360	1308360	So, have any other characters in Star Wars been seen to use the Force without extensive training?
1308360	1312360	Well, for starters, Anakin in Episode I.
1312360	1314360	He has special powers.
1316360	1317360	Yes.
1318360	1325360	He can see things before they happen. That's why he appears to have such quick reflexes. It's a Jedi trait.
1325360	1332360	Now, someone might argue that this is because Anakin is exceptionally strong with the Force by birth because of some prophecy or whatever,
1332360	1337360	but this raises a point. We don't know who Rey is yet. We don't know who her parents are.
1337360	1342360	You know, maybe she was hidden on Jakku because of her incredible Force potential or something.
1342360	1347360	We don't know. We'll have to wait until the other movies come out to learn more.
1347360	1354360	Here's another important point. Given the endless hyper-competence of modern women in movie and video game combat,
1354360	1358360	how could women ever be the victims of physical violence in real life?
1358360	1362360	Two strong soldiers get their asses kicked by Rey.
1362360	1372360	In the movie Salt, Angelina Jolie regularly throws her 95-pound stick figure combat moves at giant neck-bearded men, beating them handily.
1372360	1379360	Since this is all accepted as valid and empowering, how could there possibly be any such thing as rape culture?
1379360	1382360	Or a patriarchy, for that matter.
1382360	1391360	If women are victims, they must be weaker. But if they are weaker, they obviously cannot take on men twice their size and weight.
1391360	1397360	Which is it, ladies? If you're victims, you cannot be fighters. If you're fighters, then you cannot be victims.
1397360	1402360	And isn't it dangerous to endlessly encourage women to fight men twice their size?
1402360	1406360	Why do women ever even bother calling the cops?
1406360	1414360	Well, because it's just a movie, Stefan. You see, the problem is you are only seeing Rey as a woman
1415360	1421360	and taking her to be representative of all women instead of a character in her own right.
1421360	1424360	You know, you're only seeing her gender.
1424360	1431360	Just because a female movie character has a special skill doesn't mean that movie makers are saying all women have those skills.
1431360	1439360	This is honestly a very silly argument that I think is below Stefan's usual standard, because it can so easily be reversed, you know.
1440360	1447360	I don't see Stefan complaining about male characters' ability to fight, so why do men ever call the police?
1447360	1455360	Why would men ever need help, since we can all apparently fight like Arnie or Rocky in the movies, you know? Silly argument.
1456360	1461360	Now, little has been made of an even more hardcore female hypocrisy in the movie.
1461360	1468360	Finn, terrified of the monstrous intergalactic death cult that raised him to pretty much kill anyone not wearing a Teflon mask,
1468360	1472360	wants to run away and hide on distant planets.
1472360	1475360	Rey roundly condemns Finn for his cowardice,
1475360	1483360	making that scornful World War I lemon-white feather face that indicates a complete denial of egg accessibility.
1483360	1489360	However, shortly afterwards, Rey has an unpleasant vision and runs away,
1489360	1494360	saying she wants to have nothing to do with fighting or the war or anything.
1495360	1504360	In other words, Rey has nothing but contempt for Finn's fear of those who destroyed his childhood and have the power to destroy entire planets,
1504360	1510360	while her fear of a bad dream is portrayed as perfectly legitimate.
1510360	1516360	Hey, if I said you had a choice to go to war or have a bad dream, which would you take?
1516360	1523360	It is only the modern Western cult of women or wonderful that blinds us to this bottomless hypocrisy.
1523360	1527360	So let's talk about Finn and Rey's attempts to run away.
1527360	1532360	Now, Stefan seems to think that the movie presents Finn's desire to run away as cowardly,
1532360	1538360	and Rey's desire to run away as completely rational, but I've no idea where he's getting that from, to be honest.
1538360	1544360	The movie presents both cases fairly neutrally, I think. It shows two characters running away,
1544360	1549360	though one is determined and considered, and the other is panicked and overwhelmed.
1549360	1553360	And the other characters all have opinions about that, but that's all.
1553360	1558360	The movie itself makes no moral declarations about who's right or wrong.
1558360	1564360	Rey just panics and runs away, and there's no judgment of that action. It's just what she does.
1564360	1571360	Stefan is doing a special kind of expectant projecting here. He's not projecting his own opinions onto the movie.
1571360	1578360	He's projecting an opinion he disagrees with onto the movie in order to disagree with it.
1578360	1581360	I think the movie's siding with the woman over the man.
1581360	1587360	How awful. I'm gonna disagree with that anti-male bias. You know, it's absurd.
1587360	1593360	Anyway, remember earlier when Stefan said that the movies show no negative effects of childhood trauma?
1593360	1596360	Well, here it is, Stefan.
1596360	1602360	Rey is so fixated on her past and returning to Jakku that when Maz tells her what she already knows,
1602360	1607360	that her family are never coming back for her, she panics and flees.
1607360	1612360	She's paralyzed by her past and she can't move forward and accept the future.
1612360	1616360	She can't let go of her childhood trauma of being abandoned.
1616360	1619360	And we can say the same thing about Finn wanting to flee.
1619360	1626360	He's been so traumatized by the First Order that he wants to run away rather than face them again.
1626360	1631360	And what about Kylo Ren? You know, his whole thing is being emotionally traumatized.
1631360	1640360	This, Stefan, is exactly what you were asking for earlier, but you missed it because you were fixated on an imagined anti-male bias.
1640360	1646360	Women are not wonderful. They are people. Anything else is sexism.
1646360	1652360	Excessive praise arises from the same bigotry matrix as excessive criticism.
1652360	1655360	Yes, pay attention, black people.
1656360	1661360	Now, I don't really have much to say about this. I include it here only to ask what it means.
1661360	1666360	You know, at what point was Stefan making there? I genuinely can't figure it out.
1666360	1668360	Answers in the comments, please.
1668360	1677360	Let us institute a test of movie masculinity called the Ball Crush Test, which goes like this.
1677360	1687360	Do men and women die in equal proportions? If not, is this not virulently anti-male sexism?
1687360	1694360	Are there equal numbers of male and female villains? I'm guessing not.
1694360	1703360	Ah, if there are female villains, is there villainy explained in a sympathetic backstory? Maleficent.
1704360	1710360	Do male villains get the same sympathetic backstories?
1710360	1718360	When male villains are killed, is their death more brutal than female villains?
1718360	1727360	If male villains target women, are they depicted as more evil than the male villains who target men?
1727360	1737360	Do women sacrifice themselves to save men, at least to the degree that men sacrifice themselves to save women?
1737360	1746360	If these standards are not met, you're not watching a movie. You are watching anti-male war propaganda.
1746360	1756360	Because it dehumanizes and objectifies men, let us deploy the ancient saying that the beginning of wisdom is to call things by their proper names.
1756360	1763360	This is not art. This is war-nography.
1768360	1779360	And that's my favorite part of every Stefan video right there, the last five seconds where he stares right at you with the intensity of a man trying to make your head explode using only his mind.
1779360	1785360	So I want to address one part specifically here from Stefan's so-called ball-crush test.
1785360	1791360	And it's when he asks if male villains get sympathetic backstories, like, for instance, Maleficent.
1791360	1799360	And, again, this movie is entirely the wrong movie to make that point about since, yes, here, Kylo Ren is presented sympathetically.
1799360	1807360	Kylo is my favorite character in the movie, honestly. I think it's incredibly clever to make him an angsty and unstable Vader fanboy.
1807360	1813360	You know, he's a Vader copycat, obviously, but it's justified by his character, and I really appreciate that.
1813360	1827360	But, yeah, Kylo is not a mustache-twirling villain. He's an interesting guy, really, and he's got a surprising amount of depth and complexity relative to the usual level of depth in Star Wars villains, anyway.
1827360	1836360	So I'd like to wrap up here with perhaps Stefan's weirdest point. And I didn't really understand this one, I don't think, so have a listen.
1837360	1863360	The resentments against men harbored by abandoned boys and their bitter, clinging single mothers showed up in the all-male evil of the Empire and the endless phallic symbols scattered throughout the movie, from Darth Vader's helmet to lightsabers to the insemination sequence of navigating a dangerous trench to drop a tiny sperm into a giant Death Star egg in which birth is destruction.
1864360	1885360	The modern semi-socialist state made necessary by the collapse of Western families – the welfare state is, in reality, the single mother state – is shown by the giant Death Star egg, which has the capacity to destroy entire civilizations, as unleashed and state-subsidized female hypergamy has repeatedly done throughout human history.
1885360	1892360	Now, this is kind of a weird take, and I don't really know what to make of it. You know, the Death Star as the welfare state?
1892360	1900360	It seems like a contradiction of what Stefan says prior to that about the all-male Empire representing a hatred of men.
1900360	1909360	So the Empire are all male because abandoned boys and single mothers harbor resentments against men, so men have to be the bad guys.
1909360	1921360	But the evil men built the welfare state, the Death Star, and they're using its power of unleashed female hypergamy to destroy civilizations.
1921360	1924360	Did I get that right? I honestly have no idea.
1924360	1930360	Either way, and I'm sorry to say, I really am, but this comparison is really just very silly.
1930360	1933360	You know, to look at the Death Star and say,
1933360	1943360	Yeah, well, that thing is clearly bad and evil, so it therefore must represent the things that I don't like in real life, such as the welfare state and women.
1944360	1948360	It's such a... it's a laughably direct comparison to draw.
1948360	1952360	You see that? The bad thing is blowing up the planet.
1952360	1958360	Well, that's bad, and if you think about it, that's basically what women do, isn't it?
1958360	1966360	You know, it's kind of like what women do, that is, with the welfare state. They blow up the planet with their hypergamy.
1968360	1969360	Nonsense.
1970360	1975360	Thanks a lot for watching. Sorry to go back to the well with Stefan so quickly,
1975360	1980360	especially with so many other channels to get to, but I couldn't stop thinking about him, to be honest.
1980360	1983360	It's those eyes. I get lost in them.
