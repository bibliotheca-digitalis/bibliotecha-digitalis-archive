00:00.000 --> 00:01.320
Hello there.

00:01.320 --> 00:05.820
So okay, I know I said I was burnt out on Stefan Molyneux,

00:05.820 --> 00:10.020
but the other day I happened to watch Star Wars The Force Awakens again,

00:10.020 --> 00:14.360
and I couldn't resist going to take another look at Stefan's video about it.

00:14.360 --> 00:19.600
In my first video about Stefan, I included a clip of him talking about Star Wars

00:19.600 --> 00:24.360
and what he sees as its anti-family, anti-male message.

00:24.480 --> 00:30.220
Now the purpose of that clip was to demonstrate what I see as Stefan's anti-woman ideology

00:30.220 --> 00:36.360
affecting his approach to art, as well as, to a certain degree, everything else.

00:36.360 --> 00:41.460
So the purpose of this video is, in part, to expand on that point.

00:41.460 --> 00:46.420
Now the idea that one's particular world view colours one's understanding of art

00:46.420 --> 00:49.020
is certainly not specific to Stefan.

00:49.020 --> 00:50.520
It happens to everyone.

00:50.540 --> 00:55.480
You know, I have my own biases and leanings that I bring with me when I watch a movie,

00:55.480 --> 01:01.080
or read a book, or whatever, so I'm not criticising Stefan just for having opinions.

01:01.080 --> 01:07.280
And I'm generally a fan of what we'll call unconventional interpretations of art.

01:07.280 --> 01:11.220
At the least, I think they're usually fun to think about.

01:11.220 --> 01:16.480
I've seen it argued, for instance, that Hamlet is a gay character.

01:16.480 --> 01:21.840
And there's certain things in the play one can point to that could be interpreted as supporting this.

01:21.840 --> 01:26.480
His rejection of Ophelia, his affection for Horatio, and so on,

01:26.480 --> 01:30.140
and as well as certain lines of dialogue here and there.

01:30.140 --> 01:34.340
However, one needs to be careful with these sorts of interpretations.

01:34.340 --> 01:39.040
It's easy to cross over from speculations to declarations.

01:39.040 --> 01:45.440
There's a line between speculating that Hamlet could be gay, and declaring Hamlet to be gay.

01:45.440 --> 01:49.600
And there's a much bigger line between speculating that Hamlet could be gay,

01:49.600 --> 01:56.700
and declaring Hamlet to be gay based on the scene where he has sex with Horatio, which doesn't happen.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.900
You know, you've started misconstruing the text at that point,

01:59.900 --> 02:04.900
and you've entered into the realm of just being objectively wrong about things.

02:04.900 --> 02:10.900
And I mention this now because Stefan makes a few claims about the characters and events of The Force Awakens

02:10.900 --> 02:18.260
that I think go beyond individual interpretation, and end up just being directly contradicted by the movie.

02:18.260 --> 02:20.260
So that's my aim with this video.

02:20.260 --> 02:27.760
I'm gonna highlight the times I think Stefan is incorrect, and present a counter-interpretation of the material.

02:27.760 --> 02:34.860
But before we talk about The Force Awakens directly, we'll start with a few thoughts on the fantasy genre.

02:34.860 --> 02:39.760
In most epic stories, parents are conveniently removed from the home,

02:39.760 --> 02:45.260
allowing the young hero to easily slide under the tutelage of a warrior master,

02:45.260 --> 02:50.160
and learn the ways of obedience and drama and war.

02:50.160 --> 02:54.160
In the original Star Wars, family life was portrayed as mundane and humiliating,

02:54.160 --> 03:01.220
as a young Luke Skywalker was expected to work productively on his uncle's farm.

03:01.220 --> 03:04.660
Historically, epics tend to be fantasies.

03:04.660 --> 03:11.560
That feed the murderlust of the young, who were needed by the aristocracy to wage war on their behalf.

03:11.560 --> 03:18.660
The word adventure basically means, learn the dehumanizing joy of murdering for your masters.

03:18.660 --> 03:25.660
In these stories, boring parents are replaced by wise, hypnotic elders who teach young men,

03:25.660 --> 03:30.360
and now young women, the excitement and joys of war.

03:30.360 --> 03:35.960
This conveniently allows the authority of the state to displace the authority of parents,

03:35.960 --> 03:43.060
transitioning young men from pimply-faced teens to hardened warriors serving their economic and political masters.

03:43.060 --> 03:47.860
Hey, who wants to work for a banker when you can kill for a banker?

03:49.360 --> 03:52.760
So Stefan starts out with something that I agree with here.

03:52.760 --> 03:58.560
He is correct that the fantasy genre usually takes the protagonist's parents out of the picture,

03:58.560 --> 04:02.160
either before the story or during the opening act.

04:02.160 --> 04:07.660
But he claims this is down to some anti-family and or pro-violence message.

04:07.660 --> 04:10.460
You know, freed from their family constraints,

04:10.460 --> 04:16.160
the protagonist can now go off killing people under the guidance of an older warrior.

04:16.160 --> 04:18.660
And I can't really agree with that interpretation.

04:18.660 --> 04:22.560
I think the real reason is mainly just narrative in nature, you know.

04:22.560 --> 04:28.060
Removing the parents is often a necessary step to force the protagonist into action.

04:28.060 --> 04:33.960
If Luke, for instance, had stayed on the farm and not followed Obi-Wan, he wouldn't have a story.

04:33.960 --> 04:38.260
Nobody wants to watch Luke work a boring farm job for two hours.

04:38.260 --> 04:43.960
Regardless, I think Star Wars is the wrong series to make this point about, to be honest.

04:43.960 --> 04:49.460
Neither of Luke's masters, Obi-Wan or Yoda, teach Luke to attack anyone.

04:49.460 --> 04:53.860
In fact, they seem to prefer non-violent means of resolving conflicts.

04:53.860 --> 04:57.560
You can't win, but there are alternatives to fighting.

04:57.560 --> 05:01.760
A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense.

05:02.360 --> 05:03.860
Never attack.

05:03.860 --> 05:10.860
Obi-Wan sneaks his way past stormtroopers that he could kill, and he even allows himself to be killed.

05:10.860 --> 05:17.860
And the culmination of Luke's story has him defeating the Emperor by explicitly refusing to fight.

05:17.860 --> 05:23.560
This seems more of an anti-violence message to me, really, rather than a pro-violence one.

05:24.160 --> 05:25.660
In the new film, we meet Finn.

05:25.660 --> 05:29.960
Now, Finn is a stormtrooper who was cloned, raised without parents,

05:29.960 --> 05:35.160
and trained to be a mindless, obedient, killing robot pretty much from birth.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.560
As an adult, he has a strong conscience.

05:37.560 --> 05:44.260
He is engaging, charming, funny, enthusiastic, and, for obvious reasons, mindlessly horny.

05:44.260 --> 05:50.960
In other words, despite being raised in conditions that your average African child soldier would find utterly horrifying,

05:50.960 --> 05:56.160
he is a perfectly well-adjusted, mentally healthy, courageous, he's a good team player,

05:56.160 --> 05:59.660
he's socially poised, warm, and funny.

05:59.660 --> 06:03.460
This mirrors the fantasy of Harry Potter, who was also endlessly abused as a child,

06:03.460 --> 06:10.660
and shares most of this eerie, steroid mental health characteristics that Finn has.

06:10.660 --> 06:19.860
This denial of the effects of childhood trauma is the fundamental reason for the consistent re-emergence of intergalactic evil,

06:19.860 --> 06:24.860
not just in Star Wars, but in all these stories, and in the world as well.

06:25.660 --> 06:29.160
Intergalactic evil? Yikes.

06:29.660 --> 06:31.860
What does Stefan know that we don't?

06:32.360 --> 06:34.860
So, a few minor points about Finn here.

06:34.860 --> 06:39.860
Firstly, Stefan says that he's a clone, but he isn't.

06:40.860 --> 06:41.860
I'm a stormtrooper.

06:43.860 --> 06:46.860
Like all of him, I was taken from a family I'll never know.

06:47.860 --> 06:51.860
Secondly, when is Finn mindlessly horny?

06:51.860 --> 06:54.860
The Force Awakens is rather sexless, to be honest.

06:54.860 --> 06:59.860
The only thing I can think of here is when Finn asks Rey if she has a boyfriend.

06:59.860 --> 07:03.860
But that's about as far as the movie takes that romance, to be honest.

07:03.860 --> 07:05.860
He's hardly mindlessly horny.

07:06.360 --> 07:09.860
So anyway, the effects of childhood trauma.

07:09.860 --> 07:17.860
Why don't fantasy films with orphaned or abused protagonists show the negative effects of such neglect and or abuse?

07:18.360 --> 07:20.860
Well, for a start, sometimes they do.

07:21.360 --> 07:26.360
You know, I'd argue that The Force Awakens does, even, but we'll get to that later.

07:26.860 --> 07:30.860
For now, let's carry on and answer the question anyway, for funsies.

07:31.360 --> 07:34.860
So I'd argue that, instead of not showing these effects,

07:34.860 --> 07:40.860
fantasy stories like Star Wars and Harry Potter generally do have them, just at a reduced level.

07:40.860 --> 07:47.860
You know, it's there, but it's not generally enough to prevent the protagonist from progressing through the story.

07:47.860 --> 07:49.860
And the reason why is in the name, really.

07:50.360 --> 07:53.860
Fantasy. These works are escapist fiction.

07:54.860 --> 08:02.860
You know, they show, at first, average protagonists with mundane lives who are suddenly thrust into some grand adventure.

08:02.860 --> 08:06.860
You know, you thought you were just some kid with a horrible family and a boring life.

08:06.860 --> 08:12.360
Well, no, it turns out you're actually rich and famous, and you've got magical powers.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.360
And, yes, it's unrealistic.

08:15.860 --> 08:18.860
But it's a fantasy. It's meant to be unrealistic.

08:19.360 --> 08:23.360
Nobody wants to watch Harry Potter and the Crippling Anxiety,

08:23.360 --> 08:29.360
where we read about a non-magical Harry Potter who tries to work through his abandonment issues.

08:29.860 --> 08:32.360
Actually, I'm lying. I would totally read that.

08:32.860 --> 08:39.360
But anyway, fantasy presents an escape from an often boring and upsetting reality,

08:39.360 --> 08:41.860
and I don't think it's a negative escape at all.

08:41.860 --> 08:44.860
We need fantasies, or we'd all go insane.

08:45.360 --> 08:49.860
Now, much has been made of the casting of a woman as Rey, the new Luke.

08:50.360 --> 08:54.860
It is somehow considered to be a break from convention.

08:55.360 --> 09:02.360
While her, I don't know, let's just say character, is in fact perfectly boring and predictable,

09:02.360 --> 09:08.860
a hyper-empowered, pearly feminist robot of implausibly infinite abilities.

09:09.860 --> 09:15.860
Rey is what by now has become a yawningly cliched stock character,

09:15.860 --> 09:19.860
the all-competent ingenue, or the ACI.

09:19.860 --> 09:22.860
Now, the ACI starts off as a low-status character,

09:23.360 --> 09:27.360
whose endless and escalating waves of superlative competence

09:27.360 --> 09:31.860
quickly wash away any and all hints of reality or limitations,

09:31.860 --> 09:35.860
a superwoman fetish of automatic and unearned abilities,

09:35.860 --> 09:41.860
who ends up as little more than a delusional, man-gina him to bottomless female vanity.

09:43.360 --> 09:48.360
Rey, this film's ACI, turns out to be fantastic at hand-to-hand combat,

09:48.360 --> 09:51.860
flying various spaceships, sword fighting, using the Force,

09:51.860 --> 09:54.860
CGI cliff climbing, to name just a few.

09:55.360 --> 09:59.860
So then, Rey as an all-competent ingenue,

09:59.860 --> 10:04.860
or, to use a less annoying term, Rey as a Mary Sue character.

10:04.860 --> 10:08.360
Now, I've seen this criticism of The Force Awakens a fair few times,

10:08.360 --> 10:09.860
and not just from Stefan.

10:10.360 --> 10:13.360
So, is Rey a Mary Sue character?

10:13.860 --> 10:19.360
A Mary Sue here meaning a sort of hyper-competent, seemingly perfect character

10:19.360 --> 10:22.360
who has extensive and unrealistic skills.

10:22.360 --> 10:25.860
Well, to answer that, we first need to answer another question.

10:25.860 --> 10:28.860
What's the line that separates a Mary Sue character

10:29.360 --> 10:33.360
and just any protagonist of escapist fantasy fiction?

10:33.860 --> 10:37.360
You know, for instance, is Luke Skywalker a Mary Sue?

10:37.360 --> 10:43.360
So let's think about this further by running down the list of things that Stefan says Rey is fantastic at.

10:43.860 --> 10:46.360
Firstly, hand-to-hand combat.

10:46.360 --> 10:51.360
Rey also regularly fights grown men trained from birth in the ways of combat,

10:51.860 --> 10:53.360
and wins easily.

10:53.860 --> 10:54.860
She weighs...

10:55.360 --> 10:57.360
maybe a little over a buck ten,

10:57.360 --> 11:01.860
and regularly takes down multiple 200-pound jacked-up monster warriors.

11:02.360 --> 11:03.860
Uh, but when?

11:04.360 --> 11:09.860
There's only one time Rey fights hand-to-hand in the movie other than the concluding lightsaber duel,

11:10.360 --> 11:13.360
and that's when she fights these two dudes in the junkyard.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.360
And if I were being nitpicky here,

11:15.360 --> 11:20.360
I'd say it's technically not really hand-to-hand combat because she's armed with a big metal staff.

11:20.860 --> 11:22.860
She never fights unarmed in the movie.

11:23.360 --> 11:26.860
She's always got a blaster, a staff, or a lightsaber.

11:27.360 --> 11:30.360
And have you seen videos of Daisy Ridley's workouts?

11:30.360 --> 11:31.360
Now, I have.

11:31.860 --> 11:34.360
Purely for research purposes, you understand.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.360
And she's hardly a weak person.

11:36.360 --> 11:41.360
I mean, I'm over 200 pounds and I wouldn't want her hitting me in the head with a big metal pole.

11:41.860 --> 11:43.360
And let's think about these guys.

11:43.360 --> 11:45.360
Like, who are these guys?

11:45.360 --> 11:47.360
They're wearing hoods and masks.

11:47.360 --> 11:49.360
We don't even know what species they are.

11:49.860 --> 11:51.860
We don't even know if they're men, actually.

11:51.860 --> 11:54.360
They could be anything under there for all we know.

11:54.860 --> 11:56.360
And they're unarmed.

11:56.860 --> 12:01.360
And I think Stefan missed this, but this scene is played as a joke.

12:01.360 --> 12:04.360
Finn sees Rey under attack and runs over to help,

12:04.360 --> 12:07.860
and halfway there, he realizes he doesn't have to.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.860
Now, this scene is giving some information to the audience.

12:10.860 --> 12:13.860
You know, Rey knows how to fight with a staff.

12:13.860 --> 12:17.860
But there's also some comedy in Finn's unnecessary dash to help.

12:18.360 --> 12:22.860
And Finn's surprise that he doesn't need to help out only works as a joke

12:22.860 --> 12:29.360
if the audience has an understanding that it is a rare thing for women to be able to defend themselves

12:29.360 --> 12:30.860
in the way that Rey can.

12:31.360 --> 12:37.360
Anyway, next up, Rey is fantastic at flying spaceships and fixing the Falcon.

12:37.860 --> 12:43.360
Rey, on the other hand, has spent her youth picking up garbage, Wally-style,

12:43.360 --> 12:48.860
but is able to pull off the most ridiculous aerial maneuvers on an unfamiliar spaceship,

12:48.860 --> 12:52.360
outflying professional pilots trained from childhood.

12:52.860 --> 12:56.860
So, Rey is apparently fantastic at flying various spaceships.

12:57.860 --> 13:04.860
Now, the only spaceship that Rey flies on screen, if we don't count this little speeder thing, is the Falcon.

13:04.860 --> 13:09.360
Now, first off, Stefan says that Rey has never flown a spaceship before.

13:09.860 --> 13:15.360
So, you see, boys trained from birth to fight are terrible at fighting.

13:15.860 --> 13:21.360
But girls who've never flown a spaceship are immediate experts who can outfly relentlessly trained pilots.

13:21.360 --> 13:25.360
But this is directly contradicted by a line of dialogue in the movie.

13:31.360 --> 13:38.360
So, Rey has flown ships before, and Stefan says that the Millennium Falcon is an unfamiliar spaceship for Rey.

13:38.360 --> 13:42.360
But I don't know why, because she seems to know a lot about it.

13:42.360 --> 13:44.360
Ah! What about that ship?

13:44.860 --> 13:46.360
That one's garbage!

13:46.860 --> 13:50.860
Gunner position is down there! This ship hasn't flown in years!

13:51.360 --> 13:52.860
Who had it? Duquesne?

13:52.860 --> 13:57.360
I stole it. From Unkar Plutt. He stole it from the Irving boys who stole it from Duquesne.

13:57.360 --> 14:00.360
Some moof milker put a compressor on the ignition line.

14:00.360 --> 14:04.360
Unkar Plutt did. I thought it was a mistake too, but it's too much stress on the hyperdrive.

14:05.360 --> 14:09.360
You see, Rey works for this guy, who she was left with as a child.

14:09.360 --> 14:14.360
And he owns the Millennium Falcon, and that's how she knows about it.

14:14.360 --> 14:21.360
Now, Stefan goes on to be annoyed about how Rey knows how to fix a problem with the Falcon, when Han didn't.

14:21.360 --> 14:28.360
When standing with Han Solo at the controls of the Millennium Falcon, Rey fixes a problem that Han Solo cannot even identify.

14:28.360 --> 14:32.360
She also goes below deck to repair its malfunctioning innards.

14:32.360 --> 14:34.360
I mean, come on!

14:34.360 --> 14:38.360
Han Solo flew and maintained the Millennium Falcon for decades!

14:38.360 --> 14:40.360
Knew it inside and out!

14:40.360 --> 14:48.360
Then this vapid ACI wanders in with no knowledge of the complex spacecraft and knows exactly what to do to fix problems.

14:50.360 --> 14:53.360
But I have a couple of explanations for this.

14:53.360 --> 14:59.360
First off, Rey is a scavenger who pokes around inside spaceships and strips them for parts.

14:59.360 --> 15:03.360
So I guess I give you some knowledge about the mechanics of how spaceships work.

15:03.360 --> 15:11.360
Secondly, the problem with the Falcon is to do with a modification that happened after Han had lost the Falcon.

15:11.360 --> 15:15.360
You see, this guy, Rey's boss, made some of his own modifications.

15:15.360 --> 15:24.360
So since Rey was there when whatever it was was modified, it stands to reason she'd know more about it than Han and know how to undo it.

15:25.360 --> 15:34.360
Additionally here, I remember it being played for a joke in Empire that Han is not exactly a complete authority on how to fix the Falcon.

15:34.360 --> 15:38.360
I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarised.

15:38.360 --> 15:40.360
I'm afraid we'll have to replace it.

15:41.360 --> 15:43.360
Well, of course I'll have to replace it.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.360
Here. Chewie.

15:49.360 --> 15:51.360
I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling.

15:52.360 --> 15:57.360
Also, is Rey fantastic at flying the Falcon?

15:57.360 --> 16:01.360
You know, the first thing she does when she takes off is crash it into the ground.

16:01.360 --> 16:05.360
And then all of this stuff. And she can't get the shields up.

16:05.360 --> 16:08.360
And then the TIE fighters are landing shots on the Falcon.

16:08.360 --> 16:13.360
You see, this scene is the scene where the heroes learn to work together.

16:13.360 --> 16:15.360
And they barely scrape by.

16:16.360 --> 16:21.360
I think the movie's pretty good at showing that Rey and Finn are not that good at flying the Falcon, actually.

16:21.360 --> 16:25.360
This is not how a fantastic pilot flies a ship.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.360
Why didn't Stefan see any of this?

16:27.360 --> 16:30.360
I guess all the feminism got in the way.

16:30.360 --> 16:33.360
And there's a comparison to Luke to be made here.

16:33.360 --> 16:38.360
Luke is a farmer. Why does he know how to fly an X-wing?

16:38.360 --> 16:43.360
And he seems to know all the controls and can identify problems with the ship.

16:44.360 --> 16:53.360
You know, why is Stefan seemingly more willing to accept Luke as a skilled pilot and not Rey?

16:53.360 --> 16:56.360
There's a similar amount of evidence for each.

16:56.360 --> 17:00.360
Early on, we see them looking into the distance, dreaming of bigger things.

17:00.360 --> 17:05.360
They play with something that lets the audience know they want to be a pilot.

17:05.360 --> 17:09.360
There's a line of dialogue that lets the audience know they can fly.

17:09.360 --> 17:11.360
We need a pilot!

17:11.360 --> 17:12.360
We've got one!

17:12.360 --> 17:15.360
You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot myself. We don't have to sit here and...

17:15.360 --> 17:17.360
And that's about it.

17:17.360 --> 17:21.360
There's even a disbelieving line from Han about their piloting abilities.

17:21.360 --> 17:24.360
But who's gonna fly it, kid? You?

17:24.360 --> 17:25.360
Where's the pilot?

17:25.360 --> 17:26.360
I'm the pilot.

17:26.360 --> 17:27.360
You?

17:27.360 --> 17:30.360
Luke and Rey are very similar in this regard.

17:30.360 --> 17:34.360
If we accept Luke as a pilot, we have to accept Rey as well.

17:34.360 --> 17:37.360
Next up, sword fighting.

17:37.360 --> 17:45.360
It is nowhere explained how Rey gains her miraculous abilities to take on a master swordsman.

17:45.360 --> 17:51.360
Sword fighting is a pretty difficult and dangerous skill to acquire, as I remember from playing Macbeth.

17:51.360 --> 17:58.360
Rey simply has the skill and credibly engages in combat against a master swordsman.

17:58.360 --> 18:04.360
This is beyond ridiculous, and it is not a message I want my daughter to see.

18:04.360 --> 18:06.360
So, sword fighting.

18:06.360 --> 18:12.360
Rey shouldn't be a match for Kylo Ren, who is a stronger Force user and trained with a lightsaber.

18:12.360 --> 18:14.360
And here's the thing.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.360
She isn't really a match for him.

18:16.360 --> 18:20.360
The odds have to be evened first in order to give her a shot.

18:20.360 --> 18:27.360
Now, Stefan doesn't mention it here, but Kylo Ren has just killed his father, so he's emotionally all messed up.

18:27.360 --> 18:34.360
And, he's been shot in the gut with a weapon that the movie has went out of its way to make seem extremely powerful.

18:38.360 --> 18:42.360
Kylo is bleeding out, and he's punching himself in his wound.

18:42.360 --> 18:48.360
And he's just fought another lightsaber fight, during which he was hit with a lightsaber.

18:48.360 --> 18:51.360
Also, he's not trying to kill Rey either.

18:51.360 --> 18:54.360
He just wants to turn her to the dark side.

18:55.360 --> 18:56.360
You need a teacher!

18:58.360 --> 19:00.360
I can show you the ways of the Force!

19:01.360 --> 19:07.360
And despite all of these disadvantages, Kylo is still the dominant fighter throughout the duel.

19:07.360 --> 19:10.360
Rey is running away from him for most of it.

19:10.360 --> 19:13.360
And I think this fight is great here, actually.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.360
There's some excellent acting throughout it.

19:15.360 --> 19:20.360
Both Finn and Rey look genuinely scared of being hit by a lightsaber.

19:20.360 --> 19:25.360
And it's clear just from the fight choreography who the superior fighter is.

19:25.360 --> 19:33.360
Rey only wins because she remembers to use the Force in the end, which mirrors Luke using the Force at the end of A New Hope.

19:33.360 --> 19:36.360
So, Rey isn't a fantastic sword fighter, really.

19:36.360 --> 19:44.360
She only barely squeaks out a win over an emotionally distraught opponent who's bleeding out with multiple injuries.

19:44.360 --> 19:47.360
But let's talk about her Force abilities.

19:48.360 --> 19:55.360
Compare this effortless estrogen excellence to Luke Skywalker's slow grind to mastery.

19:55.360 --> 20:04.360
Luke had to work for three long films to even begin mastering the Force, apprenticing at the gnarled feet of Yoda for months at a time.

20:04.360 --> 20:06.360
Rey, on the other hand, she's a woman.

20:06.360 --> 20:11.360
See, she merely has to frown for five or ten seconds in order to master the Force.

20:11.360 --> 20:19.360
Well, Stefan's problem here is that he's comparing Rey's character arc over one film to Luke's character arc over three films.

20:19.360 --> 20:23.360
You know, the new trilogy is only a third complete, remember?

20:23.360 --> 20:32.360
And given that Rey meets Luke at the end of The Force Awakens, I'm guessing she's gonna be training with him in the next film, like Luke trained with Yoda in Empire.

20:32.360 --> 20:38.360
Stefan should really be making comparisons to Luke's story in A New Hope.

20:38.360 --> 20:44.360
Luke had no extensive training in that film. He just got shot by a little shooty ball thing for a while.

20:44.360 --> 20:50.360
And he successfully uses the Force in that movie to make the killing shot on the Death Star.

20:50.360 --> 20:56.360
And I'd like to make a point here, actually. What does Rey actually accomplish during the end of The Force Awakens?

20:56.360 --> 21:05.360
You know, Luke Skywalker starts the movie as a farm boy and ends it by almost single-handedly destroying the Death Star and saving the entire Rebellion.

21:05.360 --> 21:11.360
Rey has no effect on the destruction of Starkiller Base. That's all Han, Chewie, and Poe Dameron.

21:11.360 --> 21:18.360
All she does is defeat Kylo Ren, but the planet's already collapsing at that point, so it doesn't really affect much, really.

21:18.360 --> 21:22.360
Luke's untrained use of the Force is much more impactful than Rey's is.

21:22.360 --> 21:26.360
Also, the Force is a magical power.

21:26.360 --> 21:35.360
One can't really make declarations about whether or not a character would be able to use magic as proficiently as they do in a work of fiction,

21:35.360 --> 21:42.360
because it's inherently unrealistic. We can only judge by the movie universe's internal rules.

21:42.360 --> 21:48.360
So, have any other characters in Star Wars been seen to use the Force without extensive training?

21:48.360 --> 21:52.360
Well, for starters, Anakin in Episode I.

21:52.360 --> 21:54.360
He has special powers.

21:56.360 --> 21:57.360
Yes.

21:58.360 --> 22:05.360
He can see things before they happen. That's why he appears to have such quick reflexes. It's a Jedi trait.

22:05.360 --> 22:12.360
Now, someone might argue that this is because Anakin is exceptionally strong with the Force by birth because of some prophecy or whatever,

22:12.360 --> 22:17.360
but this raises a point. We don't know who Rey is yet. We don't know who her parents are.

22:17.360 --> 22:22.360
You know, maybe she was hidden on Jakku because of her incredible Force potential or something.

22:22.360 --> 22:27.360
We don't know. We'll have to wait until the other movies come out to learn more.

22:27.360 --> 22:34.360
Here's another important point. Given the endless hyper-competence of modern women in movie and video game combat,

22:34.360 --> 22:38.360
how could women ever be the victims of physical violence in real life?

22:38.360 --> 22:42.360
Two strong soldiers get their asses kicked by Rey.

22:42.360 --> 22:52.360
In the movie Salt, Angelina Jolie regularly throws her 95-pound stick figure combat moves at giant neck-bearded men, beating them handily.

22:52.360 --> 22:59.360
Since this is all accepted as valid and empowering, how could there possibly be any such thing as rape culture?

22:59.360 --> 23:02.360
Or a patriarchy, for that matter.

23:02.360 --> 23:11.360
If women are victims, they must be weaker. But if they are weaker, they obviously cannot take on men twice their size and weight.

23:11.360 --> 23:17.360
Which is it, ladies? If you're victims, you cannot be fighters. If you're fighters, then you cannot be victims.

23:17.360 --> 23:22.360
And isn't it dangerous to endlessly encourage women to fight men twice their size?

23:22.360 --> 23:26.360
Why do women ever even bother calling the cops?

23:26.360 --> 23:34.360
Well, because it's just a movie, Stefan. You see, the problem is you are only seeing Rey as a woman

23:35.360 --> 23:41.360
and taking her to be representative of all women instead of a character in her own right.

23:41.360 --> 23:44.360
You know, you're only seeing her gender.

23:44.360 --> 23:51.360
Just because a female movie character has a special skill doesn't mean that movie makers are saying all women have those skills.

23:51.360 --> 23:59.360
This is honestly a very silly argument that I think is below Stefan's usual standard, because it can so easily be reversed, you know.

24:00.360 --> 24:07.360
I don't see Stefan complaining about male characters' ability to fight, so why do men ever call the police?

24:07.360 --> 24:15.360
Why would men ever need help, since we can all apparently fight like Arnie or Rocky in the movies, you know? Silly argument.

24:16.360 --> 24:21.360
Now, little has been made of an even more hardcore female hypocrisy in the movie.

24:21.360 --> 24:28.360
Finn, terrified of the monstrous intergalactic death cult that raised him to pretty much kill anyone not wearing a Teflon mask,

24:28.360 --> 24:32.360
wants to run away and hide on distant planets.

24:32.360 --> 24:35.360
Rey roundly condemns Finn for his cowardice,

24:35.360 --> 24:43.360
making that scornful World War I lemon-white feather face that indicates a complete denial of egg accessibility.

24:43.360 --> 24:49.360
However, shortly afterwards, Rey has an unpleasant vision and runs away,

24:49.360 --> 24:54.360
saying she wants to have nothing to do with fighting or the war or anything.

24:55.360 --> 25:04.360
In other words, Rey has nothing but contempt for Finn's fear of those who destroyed his childhood and have the power to destroy entire planets,

25:04.360 --> 25:10.360
while her fear of a bad dream is portrayed as perfectly legitimate.

25:10.360 --> 25:16.360
Hey, if I said you had a choice to go to war or have a bad dream, which would you take?

25:16.360 --> 25:23.360
It is only the modern Western cult of women or wonderful that blinds us to this bottomless hypocrisy.

25:23.360 --> 25:27.360
So let's talk about Finn and Rey's attempts to run away.

25:27.360 --> 25:32.360
Now, Stefan seems to think that the movie presents Finn's desire to run away as cowardly,

25:32.360 --> 25:38.360
and Rey's desire to run away as completely rational, but I've no idea where he's getting that from, to be honest.

25:38.360 --> 25:44.360
The movie presents both cases fairly neutrally, I think. It shows two characters running away,

25:44.360 --> 25:49.360
though one is determined and considered, and the other is panicked and overwhelmed.

25:49.360 --> 25:53.360
And the other characters all have opinions about that, but that's all.

25:53.360 --> 25:58.360
The movie itself makes no moral declarations about who's right or wrong.

25:58.360 --> 26:04.360
Rey just panics and runs away, and there's no judgment of that action. It's just what she does.

26:04.360 --> 26:11.360
Stefan is doing a special kind of expectant projecting here. He's not projecting his own opinions onto the movie.

26:11.360 --> 26:18.360
He's projecting an opinion he disagrees with onto the movie in order to disagree with it.

26:18.360 --> 26:21.360
I think the movie's siding with the woman over the man.

26:21.360 --> 26:27.360
How awful. I'm gonna disagree with that anti-male bias. You know, it's absurd.

26:27.360 --> 26:33.360
Anyway, remember earlier when Stefan said that the movies show no negative effects of childhood trauma?

26:33.360 --> 26:36.360
Well, here it is, Stefan.

26:36.360 --> 26:42.360
Rey is so fixated on her past and returning to Jakku that when Maz tells her what she already knows,

26:42.360 --> 26:47.360
that her family are never coming back for her, she panics and flees.

26:47.360 --> 26:52.360
She's paralyzed by her past and she can't move forward and accept the future.

26:52.360 --> 26:56.360
She can't let go of her childhood trauma of being abandoned.

26:56.360 --> 26:59.360
And we can say the same thing about Finn wanting to flee.

26:59.360 --> 27:06.360
He's been so traumatized by the First Order that he wants to run away rather than face them again.

27:06.360 --> 27:11.360
And what about Kylo Ren? You know, his whole thing is being emotionally traumatized.

27:11.360 --> 27:20.360
This, Stefan, is exactly what you were asking for earlier, but you missed it because you were fixated on an imagined anti-male bias.

27:20.360 --> 27:26.360
Women are not wonderful. They are people. Anything else is sexism.

27:26.360 --> 27:32.360
Excessive praise arises from the same bigotry matrix as excessive criticism.

27:32.360 --> 27:35.360
Yes, pay attention, black people.

27:36.360 --> 27:41.360
Now, I don't really have much to say about this. I include it here only to ask what it means.

27:41.360 --> 27:46.360
You know, at what point was Stefan making there? I genuinely can't figure it out.

27:46.360 --> 27:48.360
Answers in the comments, please.

27:48.360 --> 27:57.360
Let us institute a test of movie masculinity called the Ball Crush Test, which goes like this.

27:57.360 --> 28:07.360
Do men and women die in equal proportions? If not, is this not virulently anti-male sexism?

28:07.360 --> 28:14.360
Are there equal numbers of male and female villains? I'm guessing not.

28:14.360 --> 28:23.360
Ah, if there are female villains, is there villainy explained in a sympathetic backstory? Maleficent.

28:24.360 --> 28:30.360
Do male villains get the same sympathetic backstories?

28:30.360 --> 28:38.360
When male villains are killed, is their death more brutal than female villains?

28:38.360 --> 28:47.360
If male villains target women, are they depicted as more evil than the male villains who target men?

28:47.360 --> 28:57.360
Do women sacrifice themselves to save men, at least to the degree that men sacrifice themselves to save women?

28:57.360 --> 29:06.360
If these standards are not met, you're not watching a movie. You are watching anti-male war propaganda.

29:06.360 --> 29:16.360
Because it dehumanizes and objectifies men, let us deploy the ancient saying that the beginning of wisdom is to call things by their proper names.

29:16.360 --> 29:23.360
This is not art. This is war-nography.

29:28.360 --> 29:39.360
And that's my favorite part of every Stefan video right there, the last five seconds where he stares right at you with the intensity of a man trying to make your head explode using only his mind.

29:39.360 --> 29:45.360
So I want to address one part specifically here from Stefan's so-called ball-crush test.

29:45.360 --> 29:51.360
And it's when he asks if male villains get sympathetic backstories, like, for instance, Maleficent.

29:51.360 --> 29:59.360
And, again, this movie is entirely the wrong movie to make that point about since, yes, here, Kylo Ren is presented sympathetically.

29:59.360 --> 30:07.360
Kylo is my favorite character in the movie, honestly. I think it's incredibly clever to make him an angsty and unstable Vader fanboy.

30:07.360 --> 30:13.360
You know, he's a Vader copycat, obviously, but it's justified by his character, and I really appreciate that.

30:13.360 --> 30:27.360
But, yeah, Kylo is not a mustache-twirling villain. He's an interesting guy, really, and he's got a surprising amount of depth and complexity relative to the usual level of depth in Star Wars villains, anyway.

30:27.360 --> 30:36.360
So I'd like to wrap up here with perhaps Stefan's weirdest point. And I didn't really understand this one, I don't think, so have a listen.

30:37.360 --> 31:03.360
The resentments against men harbored by abandoned boys and their bitter, clinging single mothers showed up in the all-male evil of the Empire and the endless phallic symbols scattered throughout the movie, from Darth Vader's helmet to lightsabers to the insemination sequence of navigating a dangerous trench to drop a tiny sperm into a giant Death Star egg in which birth is destruction.

31:04.360 --> 31:25.360
The modern semi-socialist state made necessary by the collapse of Western families – the welfare state is, in reality, the single mother state – is shown by the giant Death Star egg, which has the capacity to destroy entire civilizations, as unleashed and state-subsidized female hypergamy has repeatedly done throughout human history.

31:25.360 --> 31:32.360
Now, this is kind of a weird take, and I don't really know what to make of it. You know, the Death Star as the welfare state?

31:32.360 --> 31:40.360
It seems like a contradiction of what Stefan says prior to that about the all-male Empire representing a hatred of men.

31:40.360 --> 31:49.360
So the Empire are all male because abandoned boys and single mothers harbor resentments against men, so men have to be the bad guys.

31:49.360 --> 32:01.360
But the evil men built the welfare state, the Death Star, and they're using its power of unleashed female hypergamy to destroy civilizations.

32:01.360 --> 32:04.360
Did I get that right? I honestly have no idea.

32:04.360 --> 32:10.360
Either way, and I'm sorry to say, I really am, but this comparison is really just very silly.

32:10.360 --> 32:13.360
You know, to look at the Death Star and say,

32:13.360 --> 32:23.360
Yeah, well, that thing is clearly bad and evil, so it therefore must represent the things that I don't like in real life, such as the welfare state and women.

32:24.360 --> 32:28.360
It's such a... it's a laughably direct comparison to draw.

32:28.360 --> 32:32.360
You see that? The bad thing is blowing up the planet.

32:32.360 --> 32:38.360
Well, that's bad, and if you think about it, that's basically what women do, isn't it?

32:38.360 --> 32:46.360
You know, it's kind of like what women do, that is, with the welfare state. They blow up the planet with their hypergamy.

32:48.360 --> 32:49.360
Nonsense.

32:50.360 --> 32:55.360
Thanks a lot for watching. Sorry to go back to the well with Stefan so quickly,

32:55.360 --> 33:00.360
especially with so many other channels to get to, but I couldn't stop thinking about him, to be honest.

33:00.360 --> 33:03.360
It's those eyes. I get lost in them.

33:04.360 --> 33:08.360
Remember to like and subscribe. Well, if you liked it, anyway.

33:08.360 --> 33:17.360
And there's a donation link on the YouTube banner there, so maybe click it for a complete laugh, you absolute madman, you.

33:17.360 --> 33:19.360
And stay tuned for more rubbish.
