0	1280	Hello, everyone.
1280	5500	Today, we're gonna be taking a look at a Paul Joseph Watson video entitled,
5500	7500	The Truth About Gender.
7780	9500	Well, that's the title now.
9500	11400	When he posted it, it was called,
11400	14500	Why Women Suck at Sports, in all caps,
14500	17500	before swiftly being changed for some reason.
17500	20000	And you should probably go and watch that video,
20000	23500	just so you can be sure I'm not misrepresenting his arguments.
23500	25300	It's only eight minutes long,
25300	28300	but that means if you speed it up, it's only four minutes long,
28300	30000	and he sounds rather funny sped up,
30000	32500	so that should hopefully take some of the edge off,
32500	35200	having to watch a Paul Joseph Watson video.
35200	37200	Go on, then. Off you go.
37200	39500	And welcome back. Sorry about that.
39500	42400	So then, what's the point of Paul's video?
42400	44600	Well, it seems rather stupid at first, doesn't it?
44600	48300	You know, all the football mistakes with the silly sound effects and music,
48300	51500	but it's actually a clever little bit of manipulation.
51500	56000	This video exists to misrepresent feminist arguments about sports
56000	60700	and reframe the discussion in such a way that makes feminists seem crazy,
60700	64200	whereas Paul Joseph Watson, and by extension his viewers,
64200	67700	get to feel like enlightened truth-speakers, quote,
67700	73500	"...triggering the social justice warriors, just by speaking basic obvious facts."
73500	75400	And this is a fantasy, obviously,
75400	77900	but before we get into the specifics of how,
77900	82400	let's go through some of those basic obvious facts and have a bit of a chat about them.
82400	87300	So then, men obviously outperform women at the top levels of most sports,
87300	90100	and this is for a whole host of biological reasons.
90100	93400	If we take a man and a woman of similar height and weight,
93400	97500	the man will typically have a larger heart, higher lung capacity,
97500	99600	denser bones, more muscle mass,
99600	104200	and various other things that will usually give the man an advantage in most sports.
104200	108100	Now, I say typically and usually because, of course, there are outliers,
108100	110300	men and women who fall outside the average,
110300	114500	so you can get men who are worse than most women at sports, and vice versa.
114500	120900	And of course, with training, it's not too hard for the average woman to outperform the average untrained man.
120900	122600	The majority of the time, though,
122600	127300	women have to train longer and harder than men to attain the same level of ability,
127300	131800	and at the top athletic level, say, the Olympics or top-flight football,
131800	134400	everyone's training pretty much all the time anyway,
134400	137300	so this effectively squeezes women out of the running.
137300	142400	However, even though women can't usually compete directly with the best men in each sport,
142400	147300	these differences in ability might not actually be as different as you might expect.
147300	151200	Women's records tend to lag behind men's by about 10%,
151200	153900	but that's not 10% in everything, mind.
153900	156800	There's a scale. Some records are closer than that,
156800	161700	and others, mainly ones that are more dependent upon muscle mass like weightlifting,
161700	163600	are much more exaggerated.
163600	169100	So then, given all of this, what are the feminist arguments for integrating sports?
169100	176100	Well, one argument I do see is in favor of integrating sports in which biological differences don't play as much of a part,
176100	179300	say, shooting at the Olympics, for instance.
179300	183800	The last time women were allowed to compete with men in shooting at the 1992 Olympics,
183800	188600	a woman won a gold medal, and since then, the sport has been segregated by gender.
188600	194800	Now, some might say this is good. It allows more women to get represented at the top level or something like that,
194800	202000	and others might see it differently and say it'd be better for women to be able to compete with men directly in these kinds of events.
202000	204600	And I don't know, to be honest. I kinda see both sides,
204600	210000	but that's one argument anyway that maybe some sports are unnecessarily segregated.
210000	215800	Another argument I see is in favor of more mixed sports, like we have mixed tennis and badminton,
215800	219800	and that might be good, you know, you could have mixed relays and swimming and running,
219800	223000	and all sorts of team sports could have mixed divisions.
223000	225800	So there are real conversations going on there.
225800	233400	However, and this is to Paul, I have never seen any feminist make the case that we should just integrate something like
233400	240800	boxing or MMA, say, and just leave it at that, because that would be incredibly stupid and dangerous.
240800	247200	I've never seen any feminist deny that men generally outperform women at the top level of most sports.
247200	255400	You see, Paul's problem here is that the actual arguments going on aren't as stupid as he'd like them to be, so he has to pretend.
255400	263400	You see, the argument he wants to have is one in which crazed feminists insist that women are always equal to men in everything,
263400	270400	and then Paul smirks and unsheathes all of his facts, and then the social justice warriors crawl away from him,
270400	272200	screeching, you're a sexist.
272200	280800	And it's a great plan, honestly, but the spanner in the works here is that these people he's talking about don't seem to actually exist, by and large.
280800	287400	Paul gives a couple of examples in the video of people who are supposedly making the argument that he is countering.
287400	292200	One is this post from Feministing.com by a user named Vicki Chatwin.
292200	295200	Paul read out part of it in a silly voice, of course.
295200	298000	Now, what Paul missed was the concluding sentence.
298000	306000	Maybe in things like boxing or lifting weights, men would have an advantage, but what about other sports which are not just about brute strength?
306000	311600	Now, this conclusion makes it clear that Vicki Chatwin does understand that men have an advantage in certain sports,
311600	318000	and is actually talking about integrating those other sports, ones in which the differences don't play as much of a part.
318000	321200	The other example Paul gives is from the start of the video.
321200	324000	So a while back, I was having this debate with a feminist.
324000	334000	She claimed that women could compete with men at soccer, but weren't allowed to because of gender segregation in sports enforced by the patriarchy!
334000	336200	This shit writes itself!
336200	339800	Now, I couldn't find the supposed argument Paul had.
339800	345400	I searched through his Twitter and didn't find anything, and he's not usually above naming and shaming people, to be honest,
345400	352400	but he doesn't here for some reason, so my guess would be that this conversation didn't actually take place,
352400	358400	and he's just pretending it did, because the only way he can win an argument is by making up what the other side said.
358400	364200	But since I might be wrong about that, let's pretend this argument did take place anyway.
364200	368200	So the imaginary Slippery Slope strawman feminist said,
368200	375200	Women can compete with men at soccer, but just aren't allowed to play against them because of the patriarchy or something.
375200	379800	They do love blaming the patriarchy, don't they, those imaginary feminists?
379800	386200	Now, all I can imagine here is that Paul has either met a real-life caricature of a cartoon rabid feminist,
386200	389000	or he's misunderstood a different argument.
389000	395800	You see, there has been the odd case of clubs in men's lower division leagues trying to sign professional women footballers,
395800	400800	and being denied that by FIFA, who insist on the leagues being strictly divided.
400800	406600	Now, I can see someone making the case that men's clubs should be allowed to sign women if they want to.
406600	413600	If you integrated the leagues in that way, you know, keeping the women's leagues but also allowing women to play in the men's if they're able to,
413600	420400	you'd end up with something like the current chess situation, and probably with similar arguments for and against that.
420400	428800	Anyway, misunderstanding or not, Paul has framed the argument such that the feminists he's arguing against are all delusional,
428800	434600	and all he has to do to beat them is cite basic biological facts and tell the truth.
434600	440200	It's quite a low bar he's set for himself there, and surprisingly, he will fail to clear it,
440200	445600	because, as we'll see, even with dishonest framing, Paul just can't help lying.
445600	449000	For example, Paul includes this clip in his video.
449000	455000	That's because, no matter what gender pronoun you call yourself, biology is king.
455000	461000	["In the Hall of the Mountain King"]
461000	468400	So that's the supposed world's strongest woman arm-wrestling against a supposedly average man and losing,
468400	474000	the implication there being that even the strongest woman in the world is weaker than the average man.
474200	480800	So I went looking for the context here, and first off, I'd like to submit the following clip for your consideration.
480800	501200	["In the Hall of the Mountain King"]
501200	508400	So that was American strongwoman Jill Mills beating comedian and not professional athlete Sam Tripoli
508400	512600	in an arm wrestle on a show called The Wild World of Spike.
512600	518400	Sam Tripoli was one of the three hosts on that show alongside Kit Cope and Jason Ellis,
518400	525000	Jason Ellis being the man from the clip that Paul showed in his video where he labeled him the average man.
525000	530800	And here is average man Jason Ellis winning a professional MMA fight.
530800	536400	You see, Jason Ellis isn't actually the average man. He's a trained athlete.
536400	540200	Do you think that this fairly represents the average man, Paul?
540200	544000	Because if that's the case, I think you need to look in a mirror.
544000	547200	You look fairly average, Paul. No offense.
547200	551000	But according to you, this means you're stronger than Jill Mills.
551000	557600	So here's Jill Mills deadlifting 475 pounds. Repeatedly, I might add.
557600	559800	And I've got a challenge for you, Paul.
559800	567000	If you post a video of you deadlifting that weight even once, I'll donate 500 pounds to a charity of your choice.
567000	572600	And I'll even give you until Christmas to do it, just in case you're a little out of shape right now, you know.
572600	574600	It shouldn't be too difficult for you.
574600	580200	I mean, you're already stronger than Jill Mills, clearly, just by virtue of being an average man.
580200	583800	You see, this lie reveals another purpose of Paul's video,
583800	589600	and that's to reassure its male audience that women aren't as good as them and never can be.
589600	594600	And he does this again elsewhere by telling porkies about an Australian football match.
594600	602400	Look what happened when the professional, international Australian women's soccer team played a team of 15-year-old boys.
602400	605800	The 15-year-old boys' team won 7-0.
605800	610000	They called this a shock result. It wasn't a shock result.
610000	618400	Even at 15, the boys were physically superior to a highly trained team of adult female professionals.
618400	622600	So there was a lot of deception and lying by omission in that clip,
622600	627600	which I noticed because I'm lucky enough to just remember this incident from when it actually happened.
627600	632200	So, losing 7-0, it's not a very good result, is it, really?
632200	639400	Uh, but Paul declares this not shocking at all because of the obvious biological advantage that the boys have over the women.
639400	645800	Now, this might lead you to believe that this match was a one-off, like an exhibition battle of the sexes sort of thing.
645800	647200	And that's just not true.
647400	655000	This match was a warm-up for an international friendly game that the Australian women's team was playing in the run-up to the Rio Olympics.
655000	658600	You see, they play these sorts of games all the time.
658600	663000	There aren't enough women's teams around at that level to get in enough training games,
663000	666600	so they play against the youth teams of men's football clubs.
666600	668200	That's another point, actually.
668200	674000	This was the youth team of a professional football club. It wasn't just a random group of teenage boys.
674000	681800	And it actually was a shock result, because the last time the women played against teenage boys in a similar match, they drew 2-2.
681800	686200	And as coach Alan Stajkic... Stajkic? Explains?
686200	693000	We've probably played 40 matches against boys over the last 18 months, and the objectives are always the same.
693000	699200	To test out our players, to find out their strengths and weaknesses, and see where our team structure's good and where it's not.
699200	705800	In fact, for all of those actually involved, they seemed surprised that the match even had a reported result.
705800	709800	You know, it was a training match warming up for a friendly.
709800	712600	Half the first team weren't even present.
712600	718600	And it was a rotating player match, meaning they kept swapping players out and testing new positions.
718600	721000	The captain was playing in a jumper.
721000	727000	Also, the women's team was themselves fielding players like Ellie Carpenter, who was 16 at the time.
727000	729800	The exact same age as the boys she was playing against.
729800	737000	Regardless, 7-0 is still a bad result, but it was a warm-up match where they were trying out new players and tactics.
737000	740600	It's not as though they were playing as if they were in the World Cup final.
740600	748400	No, the only reason this news story took off is because it allowed sexist men to have a bit of a chortle about women being crap at something.
748400	755200	You know, completely ignoring the dozens of other times that the women's team has played similar matches and not lost to 7-0.
755200	758200	Oh, I am good at ruining all the fun, aren't I?
758200	766200	Now, the oddest portion of Paul's video is this little bit on Bill Nye's recent, apparently controversial show about sex and gender.
766200	768800	And this was odd to me for a couple of reasons.
768800	776000	Firstly, I went and watched that show and it seemed a fairly basic rundown of the modern scientific understanding of sex and gender,
776000	779600	interspersed with, frankly, rather rubbish attempts at comedy.
779600	785800	So it was surprising to me that anyone even took issue with any of this, other than the comedy, that is.
785800	793000	The other reason this was odd to me is that the show has absolutely nothing to do with the different sporting abilities of men and women.
793000	798600	Paul seems to have just shoved it in there because it's a recent meme-y thing about gender to talk about.
798600	800800	So let's talk about it briefly anyway.
800800	806000	Now, the fairly recent scientific understanding of sex and gender being different things,
806000	813200	and even when only talking about biological sex, there are different chromosome combinations that neatly fit into just two categories,
813200	818800	seems to have left the anti-feminist, anti-social justice crowd a little bit confused.
818800	821800	You know, sex and gender are the same thing, they say.
821800	827600	There's only two. How could our precious science, which we claim to love, be leaving us behind?
827600	834600	And that's because science changes. It updates. With additional evidence, it may come to new conclusions over time.
834600	841000	And just as creationists mock science for its evolving and changing understanding of things,
841000	848400	the rationals and anti-feminists are now mocking Bill Nye just for reporting the current scientific consensus.
848400	854600	And my favorite take on all this was Ian Miles-Chong, a.k.a. The Wrongest Man on Twitter,
854600	861200	retweeting the criticisms of an actual creationist saying that there are only two genders.
861200	864200	Gender politics makes strange bedfellows.
864200	869400	So anyway, as I close out today, I'm gonna put in a bunch of clips of men fucking up at football,
869400	877400	just to balance Paul's clips of women fucking up at football, as if a bunch of cherry-picked clips prove anything, you know.
877400	883800	So watching his video, I kinda got the sense that Paul doesn't really understand why people like sports.
883800	888200	Because it's not always about watching the very best of the best, or...
888200	892400	Everyone in England would only watch Chelsea, say, because they won the league.
892400	897000	Or everyone would only watch the heavyweight boxing and MMA fights, I mean...
897000	902000	They're technically the strongest, but they're not always the most interesting to watch, are they?
902000	909200	Similarly, women's sports can be fun to watch, even completely divorced from the fact that they can't compete with the best men.
909200	912400	You know, Ronda Rousey's career has been incredible to watch,
912400	918400	and the story of her dominance and downfall is as interesting as anything happening in men's MMA.
918400	925000	You know, far from only wanting to see the best of the best perform, people tend to like an underdog story, you know.
925000	930200	The best football match I've ever seen, not in terms of sheer ability, remember,
930200	936000	but in terms of entertainment and excitement, was the 2011 Women's World Cup Final,
936000	938800	which was Japan versus the United States.
938800	942200	Now, Japan had already shocked everyone by getting to the final.
942200	946400	They had to first beat hosts and current world champions, Germany,
946400	949800	and then they had to come back from being behind against Sweden,
949800	952400	and then they had to face the Americans in the final,
952400	958800	and were expected to lose handily, having never once beaten them in 25 previous appearances.
958800	963200	The Americans were much taller and stronger and faster than the Japanese,
963200	967800	and they were dominant throughout most of the match, with the Japanese barely holding them back.
967800	973600	And they equalized in the final minutes of extra time with one of the most inexplicable goals I've ever seen.
973600	977600	You know, what happened there, even? I don't know.
977600	980800	It just sort of somehow went into the goal.
980800	982800	So the match went to penalties.
982800	986400	Penalties in the World Cup Final, always very exciting, isn't it?
986400	988600	And I didn't give Japan much of a chance here,
988600	992800	because their goalkeeper appears to be the smallest person in the entire world.
992800	996200	But she saved two, and Japan won.
996400	1000400	It was the perfect underdog-beating-the-odds-and-winning story,
1000400	1005800	and if you're prevented from being entertained by something like this because you're sitting there thinking,
1005800	1012400	well, they couldn't beat the German men's team or something like that, then that's just sad, frankly.
1012400	1015000	It doesn't all have to be about gender, you know?
1015000	1016800	So anyway, Paul.
1016800	1022800	Nobody thinks that males and females are exactly equal in ability in everything,
1022800	1026000	except the feminists that live in your head.
1026000	1029800	You're in an argumentative cul-de-sac talking to yourself.
1029800	1037000	Your fans are a collective, fragile male ego who wanna believe that the average man is an MMA fighter.
1037000	1041600	You know, you're not triggering anyone or speaking truth to power.
1041600	1046200	You're being a shoulder to cry on for lonely men who are scared of ladies.
1046200	1050600	Anyway, go and do that deadlift video. I want it by Christmas.
1050600	1052600	Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.
1052600	1054600	We hit our next Patreon goal.
1054600	1055600	Wahey.
1055600	1060400	Thanks to the support of all these lovely people you can see on the screen right now.
1060400	1066200	I couldn't do it without you, and you're all wonderful, so give yourself a firm handshake and pat on the back.
1066200	1072000	If you like my videos and wanna see more of them, consider joining this list of names by pledging me a dollar.
1072000	1075200	Now, I say a dollar, you can pledge me way more than that if you like.
1075200	1079800	I mean, I'm not gonna stop you, but I'm genuinely happy for any support, really.
1080000	1085800	Also, like and subscribe and follow me on Twitter and all that jazz, if you feel like.
1085800	1088000	Right. See you next time, folks.
