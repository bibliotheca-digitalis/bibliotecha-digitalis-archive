00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,500
Today, we're gonna be taking a look at a Paul Joseph Watson video entitled,

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,500
The Truth About Gender.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,500
Well, that's the title now.

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,400
When he posted it, it was called,

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,500
Why Women Suck at Sports, in all caps,

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,500
before swiftly being changed for some reason.

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,000
And you should probably go and watch that video,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,500
just so you can be sure I'm not misrepresenting his arguments.

10
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,300
It's only eight minutes long,

11
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,300
but that means if you speed it up, it's only four minutes long,

12
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,000
and he sounds rather funny sped up,

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,500
so that should hopefully take some of the edge off,

14
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,200
having to watch a Paul Joseph Watson video.

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,200
Go on, then. Off you go.

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,500
And welcome back. Sorry about that.

17
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,400
So then, what's the point of Paul's video?

18
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,600
Well, it seems rather stupid at first, doesn't it?

19
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,300
You know, all the football mistakes with the silly sound effects and music,

20
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,500
but it's actually a clever little bit of manipulation.

21
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,000
This video exists to misrepresent feminist arguments about sports

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,700
and reframe the discussion in such a way that makes feminists seem crazy,

23
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,200
whereas Paul Joseph Watson, and by extension his viewers,

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,700
get to feel like enlightened truth-speakers, quote,

25
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:13,500
"...triggering the social justice warriors, just by speaking basic obvious facts."

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,400
And this is a fantasy, obviously,

27
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,900
but before we get into the specifics of how,

28
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,400
let's go through some of those basic obvious facts and have a bit of a chat about them.

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,300
So then, men obviously outperform women at the top levels of most sports,

30
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,100
and this is for a whole host of biological reasons.

31
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,400
If we take a man and a woman of similar height and weight,

32
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,500
the man will typically have a larger heart, higher lung capacity,

33
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,600
denser bones, more muscle mass,

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,200
and various other things that will usually give the man an advantage in most sports.

35
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,100
Now, I say typically and usually because, of course, there are outliers,

36
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,300
men and women who fall outside the average,

37
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,500
so you can get men who are worse than most women at sports, and vice versa.

38
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:00,900
And of course, with training, it's not too hard for the average woman to outperform the average untrained man.

39
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,600
The majority of the time, though,

40
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,300
women have to train longer and harder than men to attain the same level of ability,

41
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,800
and at the top athletic level, say, the Olympics or top-flight football,

42
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,400
everyone's training pretty much all the time anyway,

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,300
so this effectively squeezes women out of the running.

44
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,400
However, even though women can't usually compete directly with the best men in each sport,

45
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,300
these differences in ability might not actually be as different as you might expect.

46
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,200
Women's records tend to lag behind men's by about 10%,

47
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,900
but that's not 10% in everything, mind.

48
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,800
There's a scale. Some records are closer than that,

49
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,700
and others, mainly ones that are more dependent upon muscle mass like weightlifting,

50
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,600
are much more exaggerated.

51
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:49,100
So then, given all of this, what are the feminist arguments for integrating sports?

52
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:56,100
Well, one argument I do see is in favor of integrating sports in which biological differences don't play as much of a part,

53
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,300
say, shooting at the Olympics, for instance.

54
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,800
The last time women were allowed to compete with men in shooting at the 1992 Olympics,

55
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,600
a woman won a gold medal, and since then, the sport has been segregated by gender.

56
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:14,800
Now, some might say this is good. It allows more women to get represented at the top level or something like that,

57
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:22,000
and others might see it differently and say it'd be better for women to be able to compete with men directly in these kinds of events.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,600
And I don't know, to be honest. I kinda see both sides,

59
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:30,000
but that's one argument anyway that maybe some sports are unnecessarily segregated.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,800
Another argument I see is in favor of more mixed sports, like we have mixed tennis and badminton,

61
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,800
and that might be good, you know, you could have mixed relays and swimming and running,

62
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,000
and all sorts of team sports could have mixed divisions.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,800
So there are real conversations going on there.

64
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:53,400
However, and this is to Paul, I have never seen any feminist make the case that we should just integrate something like

65
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:00,800
boxing or MMA, say, and just leave it at that, because that would be incredibly stupid and dangerous.

66
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:07,200
I've never seen any feminist deny that men generally outperform women at the top level of most sports.

67
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:15,400
You see, Paul's problem here is that the actual arguments going on aren't as stupid as he'd like them to be, so he has to pretend.

68
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:23,400
You see, the argument he wants to have is one in which crazed feminists insist that women are always equal to men in everything,

69
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:30,400
and then Paul smirks and unsheathes all of his facts, and then the social justice warriors crawl away from him,

70
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,200
screeching, you're a sexist.

71
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:40,800
And it's a great plan, honestly, but the spanner in the works here is that these people he's talking about don't seem to actually exist, by and large.

72
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,400
Paul gives a couple of examples in the video of people who are supposedly making the argument that he is countering.

73
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,200
One is this post from Feministing.com by a user named Vicki Chatwin.

74
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,200
Paul read out part of it in a silly voice, of course.

75
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,000
Now, what Paul missed was the concluding sentence.

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Maybe in things like boxing or lifting weights, men would have an advantage, but what about other sports which are not just about brute strength?

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,600
Now, this conclusion makes it clear that Vicki Chatwin does understand that men have an advantage in certain sports,

78
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:18,000
and is actually talking about integrating those other sports, ones in which the differences don't play as much of a part.

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,200
The other example Paul gives is from the start of the video.

80
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,000
So a while back, I was having this debate with a feminist.

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:34,000
She claimed that women could compete with men at soccer, but weren't allowed to because of gender segregation in sports enforced by the patriarchy!

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,200
This shit writes itself!

83
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,800
Now, I couldn't find the supposed argument Paul had.

84
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,400
I searched through his Twitter and didn't find anything, and he's not usually above naming and shaming people, to be honest,

85
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:52,400
but he doesn't here for some reason, so my guess would be that this conversation didn't actually take place,

86
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,400
and he's just pretending it did, because the only way he can win an argument is by making up what the other side said.

87
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,200
But since I might be wrong about that, let's pretend this argument did take place anyway.

88
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,200
So the imaginary Slippery Slope strawman feminist said,

89
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Women can compete with men at soccer, but just aren't allowed to play against them because of the patriarchy or something.

90
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,800
They do love blaming the patriarchy, don't they, those imaginary feminists?

91
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:26,200
Now, all I can imagine here is that Paul has either met a real-life caricature of a cartoon rabid feminist,

92
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,000
or he's misunderstood a different argument.

93
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,800
You see, there has been the odd case of clubs in men's lower division leagues trying to sign professional women footballers,

94
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,800
and being denied that by FIFA, who insist on the leagues being strictly divided.

95
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,600
Now, I can see someone making the case that men's clubs should be allowed to sign women if they want to.

96
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:53,600
If you integrated the leagues in that way, you know, keeping the women's leagues but also allowing women to play in the men's if they're able to,

97
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:00,400
you'd end up with something like the current chess situation, and probably with similar arguments for and against that.

98
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:08,800
Anyway, misunderstanding or not, Paul has framed the argument such that the feminists he's arguing against are all delusional,

99
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,600
and all he has to do to beat them is cite basic biological facts and tell the truth.

100
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:20,200
It's quite a low bar he's set for himself there, and surprisingly, he will fail to clear it,

101
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:25,600
because, as we'll see, even with dishonest framing, Paul just can't help lying.

102
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,000
For example, Paul includes this clip in his video.

103
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That's because, no matter what gender pronoun you call yourself, biology is king.

104
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
["In the Hall of the Mountain King"]

105
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,400
So that's the supposed world's strongest woman arm-wrestling against a supposedly average man and losing,

106
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,000
the implication there being that even the strongest woman in the world is weaker than the average man.

107
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:00,800
So I went looking for the context here, and first off, I'd like to submit the following clip for your consideration.

108
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:21,200
["In the Hall of the Mountain King"]

109
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:28,400
So that was American strongwoman Jill Mills beating comedian and not professional athlete Sam Tripoli

110
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,600
in an arm wrestle on a show called The Wild World of Spike.

111
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:38,400
Sam Tripoli was one of the three hosts on that show alongside Kit Cope and Jason Ellis,

112
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:45,000
Jason Ellis being the man from the clip that Paul showed in his video where he labeled him the average man.

113
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,800
And here is average man Jason Ellis winning a professional MMA fight.

114
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,400
You see, Jason Ellis isn't actually the average man. He's a trained athlete.

115
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,200
Do you think that this fairly represents the average man, Paul?

116
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,000
Because if that's the case, I think you need to look in a mirror.

117
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,200
You look fairly average, Paul. No offense.

118
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,000
But according to you, this means you're stronger than Jill Mills.

119
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,600
So here's Jill Mills deadlifting 475 pounds. Repeatedly, I might add.

120
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,800
And I've got a challenge for you, Paul.

121
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:27,000
If you post a video of you deadlifting that weight even once, I'll donate 500 pounds to a charity of your choice.

122
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,600
And I'll even give you until Christmas to do it, just in case you're a little out of shape right now, you know.

123
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
It shouldn't be too difficult for you.

124
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,200
I mean, you're already stronger than Jill Mills, clearly, just by virtue of being an average man.

125
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,800
You see, this lie reveals another purpose of Paul's video,

126
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,600
and that's to reassure its male audience that women aren't as good as them and never can be.

127
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,600
And he does this again elsewhere by telling porkies about an Australian football match.

128
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:02,400
Look what happened when the professional, international Australian women's soccer team played a team of 15-year-old boys.

129
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,800
The 15-year-old boys' team won 7-0.

130
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,000
They called this a shock result. It wasn't a shock result.

131
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:18,400
Even at 15, the boys were physically superior to a highly trained team of adult female professionals.

132
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,600
So there was a lot of deception and lying by omission in that clip,

133
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,600
which I noticed because I'm lucky enough to just remember this incident from when it actually happened.

134
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,200
So, losing 7-0, it's not a very good result, is it, really?

135
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:39,400
Uh, but Paul declares this not shocking at all because of the obvious biological advantage that the boys have over the women.

136
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:45,800
Now, this might lead you to believe that this match was a one-off, like an exhibition battle of the sexes sort of thing.

137
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,200
And that's just not true.

138
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:55,000
This match was a warm-up for an international friendly game that the Australian women's team was playing in the run-up to the Rio Olympics.

139
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,600
You see, they play these sorts of games all the time.

140
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,000
There aren't enough women's teams around at that level to get in enough training games,

141
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,600
so they play against the youth teams of men's football clubs.

142
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,200
That's another point, actually.

143
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:14,000
This was the youth team of a professional football club. It wasn't just a random group of teenage boys.

144
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,800
And it actually was a shock result, because the last time the women played against teenage boys in a similar match, they drew 2-2.

145
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,200
And as coach Alan Stajkic... Stajkic? Explains?

146
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:33,000
We've probably played 40 matches against boys over the last 18 months, and the objectives are always the same.

147
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,200
To test out our players, to find out their strengths and weaknesses, and see where our team structure's good and where it's not.

148
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:45,800
In fact, for all of those actually involved, they seemed surprised that the match even had a reported result.

149
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,800
You know, it was a training match warming up for a friendly.

150
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,600
Half the first team weren't even present.

151
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:58,600
And it was a rotating player match, meaning they kept swapping players out and testing new positions.

152
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,000
The captain was playing in a jumper.

153
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Also, the women's team was themselves fielding players like Ellie Carpenter, who was 16 at the time.

154
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,800
The exact same age as the boys she was playing against.

155
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:17,000
Regardless, 7-0 is still a bad result, but it was a warm-up match where they were trying out new players and tactics.

156
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,600
It's not as though they were playing as if they were in the World Cup final.

157
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:28,400
No, the only reason this news story took off is because it allowed sexist men to have a bit of a chortle about women being crap at something.

158
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:35,200
You know, completely ignoring the dozens of other times that the women's team has played similar matches and not lost to 7-0.

159
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,200
Oh, I am good at ruining all the fun, aren't I?

160
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:46,200
Now, the oddest portion of Paul's video is this little bit on Bill Nye's recent, apparently controversial show about sex and gender.

161
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,800
And this was odd to me for a couple of reasons.

162
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:56,000
Firstly, I went and watched that show and it seemed a fairly basic rundown of the modern scientific understanding of sex and gender,

163
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,600
interspersed with, frankly, rather rubbish attempts at comedy.

164
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,800
So it was surprising to me that anyone even took issue with any of this, other than the comedy, that is.

165
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:13,000
The other reason this was odd to me is that the show has absolutely nothing to do with the different sporting abilities of men and women.

166
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,600
Paul seems to have just shoved it in there because it's a recent meme-y thing about gender to talk about.

167
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,800
So let's talk about it briefly anyway.

168
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,000
Now, the fairly recent scientific understanding of sex and gender being different things,

169
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,200
and even when only talking about biological sex, there are different chromosome combinations that neatly fit into just two categories,

170
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,800
seems to have left the anti-feminist, anti-social justice crowd a little bit confused.

171
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,800
You know, sex and gender are the same thing, they say.

172
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:47,600
There's only two. How could our precious science, which we claim to love, be leaving us behind?

173
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,600
And that's because science changes. It updates. With additional evidence, it may come to new conclusions over time.

174
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:01,000
And just as creationists mock science for its evolving and changing understanding of things,

175
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:08,400
the rationals and anti-feminists are now mocking Bill Nye just for reporting the current scientific consensus.

176
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:14,600
And my favorite take on all this was Ian Miles-Chong, a.k.a. The Wrongest Man on Twitter,

177
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:21,200
retweeting the criticisms of an actual creationist saying that there are only two genders.

178
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,200
Gender politics makes strange bedfellows.

179
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:29,400
So anyway, as I close out today, I'm gonna put in a bunch of clips of men fucking up at football,

180
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:37,400
just to balance Paul's clips of women fucking up at football, as if a bunch of cherry-picked clips prove anything, you know.

181
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:43,800
So watching his video, I kinda got the sense that Paul doesn't really understand why people like sports.

182
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,200
Because it's not always about watching the very best of the best, or...

183
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,400
Everyone in England would only watch Chelsea, say, because they won the league.

184
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,000
Or everyone would only watch the heavyweight boxing and MMA fights, I mean...

185
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
They're technically the strongest, but they're not always the most interesting to watch, are they?

186
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,200
Similarly, women's sports can be fun to watch, even completely divorced from the fact that they can't compete with the best men.

187
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,400
You know, Ronda Rousey's career has been incredible to watch,

188
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:18,400
and the story of her dominance and downfall is as interesting as anything happening in men's MMA.

189
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:25,000
You know, far from only wanting to see the best of the best perform, people tend to like an underdog story, you know.

190
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,200
The best football match I've ever seen, not in terms of sheer ability, remember,

191
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:36,000
but in terms of entertainment and excitement, was the 2011 Women's World Cup Final,

192
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,800
which was Japan versus the United States.

193
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,200
Now, Japan had already shocked everyone by getting to the final.

194
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,400
They had to first beat hosts and current world champions, Germany,

195
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,800
and then they had to come back from being behind against Sweden,

196
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,400
and then they had to face the Americans in the final,

197
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:58,800
and were expected to lose handily, having never once beaten them in 25 previous appearances.

198
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,200
The Americans were much taller and stronger and faster than the Japanese,

199
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,800
and they were dominant throughout most of the match, with the Japanese barely holding them back.

200
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:13,600
And they equalized in the final minutes of extra time with one of the most inexplicable goals I've ever seen.

201
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,600
You know, what happened there, even? I don't know.

202
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,800
It just sort of somehow went into the goal.

203
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
So the match went to penalties.

204
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,400
Penalties in the World Cup Final, always very exciting, isn't it?

205
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,600
And I didn't give Japan much of a chance here,

206
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,800
because their goalkeeper appears to be the smallest person in the entire world.

207
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,200
But she saved two, and Japan won.

208
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,400
It was the perfect underdog-beating-the-odds-and-winning story,

209
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,800
and if you're prevented from being entertained by something like this because you're sitting there thinking,

210
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:52,400
well, they couldn't beat the German men's team or something like that, then that's just sad, frankly.

211
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,000
It doesn't all have to be about gender, you know?

212
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,800
So anyway, Paul.

213
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,800
Nobody thinks that males and females are exactly equal in ability in everything,

214
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,000
except the feminists that live in your head.

215
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,800
You're in an argumentative cul-de-sac talking to yourself.

216
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:17,000
Your fans are a collective, fragile male ego who wanna believe that the average man is an MMA fighter.

217
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,600
You know, you're not triggering anyone or speaking truth to power.

218
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,200
You're being a shoulder to cry on for lonely men who are scared of ladies.

219
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,600
Anyway, go and do that deadlift video. I want it by Christmas.

220
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,600
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

221
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,600

Thanks to the support of all these lovely people you can see on the screen right now.

224
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,200
I couldn't do it without you, and you're all wonderful, so give yourself a firm handshake and pat on the back.

227
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,800
I mean, I'm not gonna stop you, but I'm genuinely happy for any support, really.
