00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about immigration.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
Again, yes.

00:06.000 --> 00:11.000
Specifically, immigration's capacity to destroy civilizations.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
And we're going to be talking about one particular civilization that was destroyed by immigration,

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
and that is Nazi Germany.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
How's that for a plot twist?

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
And so early in the video as well.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
So let's talk about how immigration caused the downfall of Nazi Germany.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
At the end of the 1930s, Germany was resurgent.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
After struggling for many years with an economy in recession and a worthless currency,

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
the government initiated numerous public building projects to stabilize the economy

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
and put its citizens back to work.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
The military was greatly expanded, and a combination of diplomacy and military action

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
secured many of the adjacent provinces to Germany and put them under direct German rule.

00:56.000 --> 01:04.000
By the early 1940s, the vast majority of Europe was controlled either directly by Nazi Germany or by an ally.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Eventually, though, they ran into a problem,

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
and that problem is one that has felled many great civilizations throughout history.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Immigration.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
Immigrants were attracted to Nazi Germany from all over.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
In the East, great swarms of Russian immigrants crossed the border into German territory.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
And from the UK, immigrants from a great many nations made the dangerous channel crossing,

01:27.000 --> 01:34.000
often in small, unsafe boats, and their sheer number overwhelmed the German border forces.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
And who were these immigrants?

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
Well, they certainly weren't a representative cross-section of wider society.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
There were hardly any women, children, or elderly.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
No, they were mainly young, military-aged males

01:47.000 --> 01:53.000
who made absolutely no attempt to integrate into the culture of Nazi Germany.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
In fact, they were frequently involved in violent clashes with German security forces,

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
which put a great strain on the state,

02:00.000 --> 02:08.000
as well as carrying out various terrorist bombing campaigns to frighten the populace and destroy vital German infrastructure.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
Germany proved completely unable to handle the sheer scale of the migrant crisis,

02:14.000 --> 02:21.000
and eventually, they were overwhelmed completely, and their civilization was destroyed.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Now then, what was all that rubbish I just said?

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Well, I want to make two points about it.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
The first is, it was all nonsense.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
Obviously, sort of a pointless, misleading bunch of gibberish.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
The second thing I want to say about it, though, is that technically, actually,

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
nothing that I just said was untrue,

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
as long as we don't mind stretching certain definitions of words to the breaking point, anyway,

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
because that was the problem with what I just said.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
The actual events did happen as stated,

02:53.000 --> 03:00.000
but the terminology that I used to describe them happening was obviously incorrect and misleading.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
The immigrants were actually foreign soldiers loyal to governments that were at war with Nazi Germany.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
They were only migrants in the sense that they went from one place to another.

03:10.000 --> 03:17.000
The point of my Nazi Germany example there is to show how misleading contemporary political terminology,

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
with all its associated implications, can be if we apply it to events from the distant past.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
You see, we're all, of course, familiar on some level with the events of the Second World War,

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
it being relatively recent, so my deceptive language there really stood out.

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
Modern audiences will be less familiar with events from ancient history, though.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
The fall of Rome, for instance, which is what this video is actually about.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
So we'll try and keep that in mind going forward.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
When someone points to the ancient world to make a point about the modern one,

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
don't take what they say at face value,

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
because it might be just as misleading as my little history of World War II right there.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
So then, with that in mind, did immigration cause the fall of Rome?

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
This video is sort of a companion piece to my previous video about Rome,

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
which was a response to Stefan Molyneux's claims that loose morality,

04:09.000 --> 04:15.000
women's rights, taxation, and various other things were the cause of the fall of Rome.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
And starting out here, I'll repeat a few things to be considered from that video.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
Firstly, when people say the fall of the Roman Empire,

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
they usually mean the fall of the Western Roman Empire,

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
because the Eastern half kept on going for another thousand years.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
Until someone invented a cannon strong enough to bring down the walls of Constantinople,

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
which in itself highlights the more practical and tangible reasons that empires often fall.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
Not due to some degradation of morality or national spirit,

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
but instead because someone invented a really big gun and shot them with it.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
Virtue and spirit are all well and good, but they're not going to stop a 600 pound cannonball.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
So anyway, we're going to be talking about the fall of the Western Roman Empire,

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
which most historians date to 476 AD,

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
when a chieftain called Odoacer revolted against the Empire

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
and deposed Romulus Augustus, the last emperor of the West.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
And I see two approaches online when someone's attempting to pin the fall of the Roman Empire

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
onto one singular event or concept, with the aim of making a modern political point.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
The first is one of direct comparison.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
The Roman Empire is the EU, and the Germanic tribes who fought against Rome

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
are directly analogous to modern migrants and asylum seekers, for instance.

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
Now this approach is easily foiled by simply pointing out the many differences in the two situations.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
Ravenna fell because it was captured by a military loyal to a rebellious enemy king.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
For an actual direct historical comparison to be legitimate,

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
we'd need to see something like an army of former Syrian, say, allies,

05:55.000 --> 06:01.000
revolting against the EU and then invading Europe and occupying Brussels or something.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
This reclassification of an enemy armed force to simply immigrants

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
is every bit as misleading as my Nazi Germany example.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
Now the other approach you see is the more interesting one,

06:12.000 --> 06:18.000
the one that acknowledges the differences between given historical and contemporary situations,

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
but makes the case that there are enough similarities to justify the comparison.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
And that's a little more interesting to talk about.

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
For instance, in 376 AD, 100 years before the fall of Ravenna,

06:30.000 --> 06:36.000
Rome did have to deal with a migrant crisis which led to a costly war, the Gothic War,

06:36.000 --> 06:42.000
during a precarious time in Roman history when the Empire could ill afford costly wars.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
And it is this crisis that various clever clogs who know their Roman history

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
often cite when making the argument that immigration led to the fall of Rome.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
And so we'll also be talking about that migrant crisis today.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
But before we get to that specifically, however,

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
I'd like to talk about a few relevant events from throughout Roman history,

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
which I think are key to understanding exactly how and why the Gothic War started.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
And I'd like to kick off by asking a question, and it's quite a big one.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
What actually did cause the fall of the Roman Empire?

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
And the interesting thing about the various singular reasons we could cite here

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
is that since Roman history covers such a huge amount of time,

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
and Rome itself existed under so many varying forms of organization and government,

07:26.000 --> 07:33.000
there's invariably an alternate example from Roman history that counters any one reason by itself.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
Now, for instance, we could look at the fall of Rome strictly militarily.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
Rome fell because it was defeated in battle in a very practical sense.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
But then we can look through Rome's history to all the other times it was defeated in battle.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
The Carthaginian general Hannibal, for example,

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
inflicted a string of costly defeats upon the Romans during the Second Punic War.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
He defeated Rome in the Battle of Trebia, the Battle of Lake Trasimene,

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
and the Battle of Cannae, which was one of the costliest defeats Rome ever suffered,

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
and one of the bloodiest battles in human history,

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
with up to 70,000 Romans killed or captured in a single day,

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
including a sitting consul for that year and up to 80 senators.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
Rome was also no stranger to losing battles against the various Germanic peoples.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
In one of the other great losses in Roman history, the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest,

08:23.000 --> 08:29.000
three entire Roman legions were ambushed and destroyed by an alliance of Germanic tribes.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
Now, Rome did not fall after these defeats.

08:32.000 --> 08:38.000
Rome's great military strength was not necessarily that they were invincible on the battlefield,

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
although, of course, they were very strong.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
It was their ability to absorb and recover from defeats.

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
The sheer size of the empire, as well as its organization and logistics,

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
meant that Rome could handle the occasional military loss,

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
which was a rare thing in the ancient world.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Look at the rebellion of Boudica, for instance.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
Boudica's rebellion defeated the Romans at Camulodonum,

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
they sacked the city, they destroyed the 9th Legion,

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
they sacked Londinium, they sacked Verulamium,

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
and then they lost one battle to the Romans,

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
and the rebellion was broken and Boudica committed suicide.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
For most ancient military forces, this was how it went.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
Being defeated meant just that you were defeated.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
For the Romans, though, if a legion was defeated, they just sent another legion.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
Rome's enemies usually had to win every single time,

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
whereas Rome often only had to win once.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
So Rome was clearly no stranger to military losses

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
and was always previously able to recover.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
And so, at the end of the empire, we have to ask,

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
what happened to that ability?

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
Why didn't Rome recover the final time? What was different?

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
And this is where we have to look beyond strictly singular reasons that Rome fell,

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
because any one reason can't tell us the whole story, clearly.

09:59.000 --> 10:05.000
So by the time it fell, Rome had lost its ability to recover from military defeats the way it had in the past,

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
but it had lost other important abilities too.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
For instance, the ability to make and maintain allies.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
So let's talk about that for a while.

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
And to introduce this concept, we're gonna read a little of the Annals of Tacitus.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
This section chronicling a debate in 48 AD in the Roman Senate

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
during the reign of Emperor Claudius, who is my favorite emperor,

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
being a very interesting character and a historian himself, so he knew his stuff.

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
The debate was to answer whether or not Rome should allow Gauls to be appointed to public office in Rome.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
Gaul being roughly the territory covered by modern-day France,

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
which had at this point been conquered by Rome.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
Now Gauls, being provincials, had certain rights in the Roman political system,

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
but were ineligible to run for public office or sit as senators in Rome.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
And I quote,

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
In the consulship of Aulus Vitellius and Lucius Phipps Darnus,

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
the question of filling up the Senate was discussed,

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
and the chief men of Gallia Comata, as it was called,

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
who had long possessed the rights of allies and of Roman citizens,

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
sought the privilege of obtaining public offices at Rome.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
There was much talk of every kind on the subject,

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
and it was argued before the emperor would fayament opposition.

11:18.000 --> 11:24.000
Italy, it was asserted, is not so feeble as to be unable to furnish its own capital with the Senate.

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
Once, our native-born citizens sufficed for peoples of our own kin,

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
and we are by no means dissatisfied with the Rome of the past.

11:33.000 --> 11:40.000
To this day we cite examples which under our old customs the Roman character exhibited as to valor and renown.

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
Is it a small thing that the Veneti and Insuris have already burst into the Senate house

11:45.000 --> 11:51.000
unless a mob of foreigners, a troop of captives, so to say, is now forced upon us?

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
What distinctions will be left for the remnants of our noble houses,

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
or for any impoverished senators from Latium?

11:58.000 --> 12:04.000
Every place will be crowded with these millionaires whose ancestors of the second and third generations

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
at the head of hostile tribes destroyed our armies with fire and sword,

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
and actually besieged the divine Julius at Alesia.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
These are recent memories.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
What if there were to rise up the remembrance of those who fell in Rome's citadel,

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
and are heralded by the hands of these same barbarians?

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
Let them enjoy indeed the title of citizens,

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
but let them not vulgarize the distinctions of the Senate and the honors of office.

12:28.000 --> 12:33.000
So that's how Tacitus recounts the opposing side of the argument there,

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
and it goes that Rome does not need foreigners to fill its senatorial ranks,

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
and admitting them would vulgarize the office.

12:41.000 --> 12:47.000
Also mentioned are events from the Gallic Wars, such as Julius Caesar being besieged at Alesia,

12:47.000 --> 12:53.000
as well as the sack of Rome in or around 390 BC by a Gallic tribe, the Senones.

12:53.000 --> 13:01.000
The Gauls were relatively recent enemies of Rome, it was argued, and thus should not be granted full rights.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
And let's keep reading and see Claudius' response.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
These and like arguments failed to impress the emperor.

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
He at once addressed himself to answer them, and thus harangued the assembled Senate.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
My ancestors, the most ancient of whom was made at once a citizen and a noble of Rome,

13:18.000 --> 13:25.000
encouraged me to govern by the same policy of transferring to this city all conspicuous merit, wherever found.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
What was the ruin of Sparta and Athens but this?

13:29.000 --> 13:35.000
That mighty as they were in war, they spurned from them as aliens those whom they had conquered.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
Our founder Romulus, on the other hand, was so wise that he fought as enemies

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
and then hailed as fellow citizens several nations on the very same day.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Strangers have reigned over us.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
That freedmen's sons should be entrusted with public offices is not, as many wrongly think,

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
a sudden innovation, but was a common practice in the old Commonwealth.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
But it will be said, we have fought with the Senones.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
I suppose then that the Volske and Aquae never stood an array against us.

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
Our city was taken by the Gauls while we also gave hostages to the Etruscans

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
and passed under the yoke of the Samnites.

14:11.000 --> 14:17.000
On the whole, if you review all our wars, never has one been finished in a shorter time than with the Gauls.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
Thenceforth, they have preserved an unbroken and loyal peace.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
United as they now are with us by manners, education, and intermarriage,

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
let them bring us their gold and their wealth rather than enjoy it in isolation.

14:29.000 --> 14:34.000
Everything, Senators, which we now hold to be of the highest antiquity, was once new.

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
Plebeian magistrates came after patrician, Latin magistrates after plebeian,

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
magistrates of other Italian peoples after Latin.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
This practice too will establish itself,

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
and what we are this day justifying by precedence will be itself a precedent.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
So what is Claudius saying there?

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
Well, in this section here, he first lists a Gallic tribe that was at war with Rome,

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
but then two Italian ones.

14:59.000 --> 15:06.000
And he's saying, yes, the Gauls were at war with us, but so too were the cities we now control in Italy.

15:06.000 --> 15:12.000
We suffered defeats at the hands of the Gauls, but we've also suffered defeats at the hands of Italians.

15:12.000 --> 15:18.000
And we should welcome the defeated as allies, lest we face the same fate as Athens or Sparta.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
In short, those opposing the Gauls being admitted into the Senate said,

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
hey, we don't need these foreigners coming over here telling us how to run things.

15:26.000 --> 15:32.000
And Claudius responds, well, half of us sitting here were also once foreigners to Rome,

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
so maybe chill out about it a bit and it'll be fine.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
It loses something in translation like that, but there you go.

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
And what I'd like you to take away from that little scene there is that for Claudius,

15:45.000 --> 15:54.000
one of Rome's great strengths was its ability to turn former enemies into allies, like Goku.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
And I'd like to elaborate a little on a conflict from Roman history

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
involving some of the Italian tribes mentioned by Claudius there.

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
From 91 to 88 BC, the Roman Republic fought the Social War,

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
also known as the War of the Allies,

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
which saw several Italian city-states rise up in revolt against Rome.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
And the reasoning behind this conflict is especially noteworthy here.

16:18.000 --> 16:24.000
So then, prior to the Social War, Rome had effective control of the whole Italian peninsula.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
They had defeated or allied with the other tribes and city-states

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
and had the ability to both tax and demand military aid from them.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
And this was not an insignificant thing.

16:33.000 --> 16:39.000
By the 2nd century BC, Rome's Italian allies comprised a majority of its military forces.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
But, even though the allies were being taxed by Rome,

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
as well as being made to fight in Rome's wars,

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
they received a disproportionately small share of the spoils and land.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
And they did not have Roman citizenship rights.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
And the allies were increasingly ticked off about this.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Any Americans listening will know the term,

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
no taxation without representation.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
Well, this was kind of one of those situations.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
Now, a Roman politician called Marcus Livius Drusus

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
attempted to address this problem in 91 BC

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
by introducing reforms that would grant the allies Roman citizenship,

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
which would probably have been a smart move, given they were on the verge of open rebellion.

17:20.000 --> 17:27.000
The response of the Roman Senate, however, was to ignore the problem and have Drusus assassinated.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
And as a result, the Social War broke out almost immediately.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
So, good move there, Roman Senate.

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
Rome eventually won the Social War, but they did not have an easy time of it by any means,

17:38.000 --> 17:44.000
suffering several losses, and notably, they were forced to offer a major concession to the allies

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
to get them to stop fighting.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Full Roman citizenship.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
Which is what the allies wanted in the first place.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
So, why am I telling you about the Social War?

17:54.000 --> 18:00.000
Well, first off, it's a time in Roman history when they had to learn an important lesson the hard way.

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
Do not, as Claudius says, treat those you've conquered as aliens.

18:05.000 --> 18:11.000
Or, at the very least, don't give increasing amounts of military power to people with no political power,

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
because before long, they will use the former to take the latter.

18:15.000 --> 18:20.000
The other reason I mention the Social War is that Odoacer's rebellion, centuries later,

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
the one that deposed the last Roman emperor, was triggered in much the same way.

18:25.000 --> 18:31.000
Odoacer was a military leader who, in the summer of 476 AD,

18:31.000 --> 18:37.000
visited Ravenna and asked Orestes, who was the father of the teenage emperor, Romulus Augustus,

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
to make good on various promises.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
You see, Orestes had himself deposed the previous emperor, Julius Nepos,

18:45.000 --> 18:51.000
and he had promised Odoacer's soldiers land on which to settle if they supported his rebellion.

18:51.000 --> 18:57.000
However, when it came time to grant the land for the soldiers, Orestes reneged on his promise.

18:57.000 --> 19:04.000
Now, a more forward-thinking man might have questioned the logic of refusing to pay a mercenary army,

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
a mercenary army that clearly have no qualms about overthrowing a Roman emperor,

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
given that they'd just done that exact same thing to the last guy,

19:12.000 --> 19:17.000
so Orestes really, super, incredibly should have paid them.

19:17.000 --> 19:22.000
Predictably, Odoacer and his men didn't like not being paid and broke into open revolt,

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
and they sacked a bunch of cities, defeated Orestes in the field,

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
took Ravenna, deposed young Romulus Augustus,

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
and that's all she wrote for the Western Roman Empire.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
Now, it's not a direct one-to-one comparison by any means,

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
but both the Social War and Odoacer's rebellion have a few similarities.

19:40.000 --> 19:47.000
Non-Roman armies fighting for Rome but being refused what they feel is an equal share of the spoils.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
Military power being in the hands of people with limited political power,

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
and both situations show the danger of mistreating your allies

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
when they make up the majority of your military forces.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
You see, in the latter days of the Empire especially,

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
Rome increasingly relied upon mercenaries to fight their battles for them,

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
which works perfectly fine right up until you don't pay them, like Orestes found out.

20:10.000 --> 20:16.000
There are also stories of people fighting Rome who didn't necessarily want to.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Both conflicts were entirely avoidable.

20:18.000 --> 20:24.000
You know, the Italian allies wanted rights and Odoacer's troops wanted payment and land on which to settle,

20:24.000 --> 20:30.000
but they only rebelled when denied those things that they felt their military service had earned for them.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
And notably, these peoples wanted to be part of Roman society.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
They wanted to live on Roman land and have Roman rights.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
And it's an interesting thing.

20:40.000 --> 20:45.000
For many, being in the Empire was seen as a benefit, and that's how it had to be.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
It would be impossible for Rome to hold its whole Empire by military force alone.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
For most provinces in the Empire, particularly the interior provinces,

20:54.000 --> 21:00.000
seeing a Roman legion at all, let alone a battle, would be a very rare occurrence.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
Rome's forces were most often found on its frontiers,

21:03.000 --> 21:10.000
and the Empire was far too large and populous for the legions to hold it all if everyone decided to rebel at once.

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
Now, they didn't rebel because, for the most part anyway, they wanted to be in the Empire,

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
and migration into the Empire occurred throughout its whole history.

21:19.000 --> 21:27.000
For instance, emperors Diocletian and Constantine both resettled tribes from outside to inside the Empire,

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
with the aim of negating the threat they posed as outsiders,

21:30.000 --> 21:36.000
as well as providing more people to work, pay taxes, and be recruited into the legions.

21:36.000 --> 21:43.000
In the first century AD, a Roman governor of Moesia was recorded as transferring 100,000 people

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
of those living across the Danube into the Empire with, I quote,

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
"...their wives, children, chiefs, and kings."

21:50.000 --> 21:55.000
And this was recorded in a dedication to him as one of his great achievements.

21:55.000 --> 22:02.000
And that's something you wouldn't see today, is a politician bragging about bringing 100,000 migrants into the country.

22:02.000 --> 22:09.000
So Rome did have a history of successfully and peacefully managing migrations into the Empire.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
And so now we come to the Gothic War, which I mentioned earlier.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
The war that followed a migration of Gothic tribes into the Empire.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
And so we have to ask, what went wrong?

22:20.000 --> 22:26.000
What was done differently in that case to distinguish it from the successful migrations?

22:26.000 --> 22:31.000
So in 376 AD, a large number of Gothic peoples arrived on the Danube River,

22:31.000 --> 22:37.000
which was the border of Roman territory, and asked if they could settle inside the Empire.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
The Goths were fleeing from the Huns, who were currently riding around on horseback,

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
shooting arrows at people, and generally just being menacing.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
The Goths sent envoys to the Eastern Roman Emperor, Valens, saying,

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
"...hey, can we move in with you, please?"

22:52.000 --> 22:59.000
And Valens said, okay, that sounds neat, you know, I can tax you, you can join the legions, let's do it.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
I'm streamlining the actual historical record here, if you hadn't noticed.

23:03.000 --> 23:10.000
Now, this correspondence took some time, as Valens was off preparing for a campaign against the Sassanid Empire in the East.

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
Now, firstly, since the Emperor was preparing for war on another front,

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
he had left only a skeleton crew manning the Danube border.

23:18.000 --> 23:26.000
And secondly, since the correspondence took a while, the Goths had thousands of people all sitting put on a riverbank for a very long time,

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
and they started to run out of provisions.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
So when they began crossing the river into Rome,

23:31.000 --> 23:37.000
they were coming as a hungry and desperate people who outnumbered the Roman border force.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
And they were armed, too.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
In the relevant section of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,

23:43.000 --> 23:49.000
historian Edward Gibbon notes that one of the various ways this migration differed from the previous migrations

23:49.000 --> 23:56.000
was that the Goths managed to keep hold of their arms via a series of extravagant bribes to corrupt Roman officials.

23:56.000 --> 24:04.000
And those bribed Roman officials turned a blind eye and did not disarm the incoming migrants, as was the standard practice.

24:04.000 --> 24:12.000
So the Goths were armed, desperate, hungry, and locally, at least, outnumbered the Roman military.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
Kind of a precarious situation.

24:15.000 --> 24:20.000
But, however, not one that necessarily had to lead to violence.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
I mean, the Goths wanted to be part of the Roman Empire, and they'd come in peace.

24:25.000 --> 24:31.000
As long as the Romans weren't actively antagonistic towards the Goths, there's no reason they couldn't have been resupplied,

24:31.000 --> 24:36.000
apportioned some land, and set to work churning out taxes and soldiers.

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
Enter Lupercenus, a Roman lieutenant of Emperor Valens,

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
who was in charge of the military government in the area where the Goths were crossing the border.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
And I will now read you his entire Wikipedia article.

24:50.000 --> 24:57.000
Lupercenus was a Roman lieutenant of Valens in Thrace in the late 4th century AD.

24:57.000 --> 25:05.000
His reputed poor treatment of the Ferevingi Goths under Fritigern led to the Gothic Wars and the Battle of Adrianople.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Wonderfully short and to the point there.

25:07.000 --> 25:14.000
Now, if we click through, the Battle of Adrianople is an upcoming battle between the Goths and the Romans,

25:14.000 --> 25:19.000
which is an overwhelming defeat for the Romans and in which the Emperor Valens dies.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
Furthermore, from Wikipedia,

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
What a jerk.

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
So what did he actually do that was so bad it started a war?

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
Well, upon encountering the masses of hungry and desperate Goths,

25:47.000 --> 25:52.000
Lupercenus and the rest of the Roman border forces saw the Roman equivalent of dollar signs.

25:52.000 --> 25:58.000
They sold the Goths food at exorbitant prices, quickly stripping them of their wealth and valuables.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
And when the Goths ran out of things to trade for food,

26:02.000 --> 26:08.000
the Romans started accepting as payment Gothic children, who were then sold into slavery.

26:08.000 --> 26:15.000
And I'll quote Roman soldier and historian Ammianus Marcellinus here, talking about the greed of the Roman commanders.

26:38.000 --> 26:44.000
Which, even if they were to choose their own judges, must appear wholly unpardonable, must be mentioned.

26:48.000 --> 26:53.000
When the barbarians who had been conducted across the river were in great distress from want of provisions,

26:53.000 --> 26:58.000
those detested generals conceived the idea of a most disgraceful traffic.

26:58.000 --> 27:03.000
And having collected hounds from all quarters with the most insatiable rapacity,

27:04.000 --> 27:10.000
they exchanged them for an equal number of slaves, among whom were several sons of men of noble birth.

27:10.000 --> 27:15.000
Whew, that's a bit of a mouthful, that bit. That took a few takes, and no mistake.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
And what did it say?

27:17.000 --> 27:23.000
Well, the Romans forced the Goths to sell their children into slavery for dog meat.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
Which is pretty rubbish behaviour, frankly.

27:26.000 --> 27:32.000
And I just want to point out and make clear, Marcellinus places the blame for what is about to happen,

27:32.000 --> 27:37.000
squarely on the greedy Roman commanders, rather than the migrant Goths.

27:37.000 --> 27:43.000
So anyway, the Goths were pretty ticked off at this children for dog meat scam the Romans were running,

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
to put it somewhat lightly.

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
And I'm sure one or two of them probably started doing a little mental arithmetic,

27:49.000 --> 27:54.000
and possibly noticing that there were a lot more of them than there were Roman gods.

27:54.000 --> 28:00.000
And so grumbling turned into shouting, and shouting into fighting.

28:00.000 --> 28:06.000
Now, Luperkinus, correctly fearful that he was about to have a full-blown revolt on his hands,

28:06.000 --> 28:12.000
decided to help speed things along a bit by inviting a bunch of the Gothic leaders to a banquet,

28:12.000 --> 28:17.000
and then, when they were there, executing their guards and imprisoning them.

28:17.000 --> 28:23.000
Which is very odd behaviour, maybe he was an ancient accelerationist, who knows.

28:23.000 --> 28:28.000
Anyway, after Luperkinus read weddinged a bunch of their chiefs, war was unavoidable.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
Obviously.

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
And though Rome would technically win, it would be only a Pyrrhic victory,

28:34.000 --> 28:39.000
with the later Battle of Adrianople being particularly costly for the Romans.

28:39.000 --> 28:44.000
It also changed how Rome dealt with barbarian tribes going forward.

28:44.000 --> 28:50.000
The huge difficulty the Empire had in winning the Gothic war exposed it as something of a paper tiger,

28:50.000 --> 28:55.000
and migrating groups were now able to negotiate with Rome on their own terms.

28:55.000 --> 28:59.000
And as a result, people like the Visigoths were able to settle inside the Empire,

28:59.000 --> 29:05.000
while remaining a unified people, loyal to their own leaders, rather than the Emperor.

29:05.000 --> 29:10.000
They were living in the Empire, but they had not integrated into the Empire.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
All this brings me to my main point.

29:13.000 --> 29:19.000
So often, the expectation to integrate is placed entirely on the migrant people.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
However, that isn't how integration works.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Integration is a two-way street.

29:25.000 --> 29:30.000
The Gothic war was the result of Rome's failure to integrate the Goths.

29:30.000 --> 29:36.000
It was just one more of Rome's abilities that they had lost near the end of the Western Empire.

29:36.000 --> 29:42.000
Rather than turning enemies into allies, Rome was now instead turning potential allies into enemies.

29:42.000 --> 29:47.000
And this next point is shamelessly stolen from Mike Duncan's History of Rome podcast,

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
which you should listen to if you haven't, because it's great.

29:50.000 --> 29:56.000
In the conclusion to his series, Duncan wonders what the Western Roman Empire could have been

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
had it successfully integrated the various Germanic peoples.

30:00.000 --> 30:04.000
You see, increasingly near the end of the Western Roman Empire,

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
the most powerful and capable leaders were of Germanic origin.

30:08.000 --> 30:16.000
However, Rome's unwillingness to see a German as Emperor imposed a ceiling on the political power they could attain.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
And that's why, at the end, we start seeing puppet Emperors.

30:19.000 --> 30:24.000
You know, Emperors of the correct birthplace and from the correct families,

30:24.000 --> 30:30.000
placed onto the imperial throne to act as proxies for the Germanic generals who had the real military power.

30:30.000 --> 30:36.000
Duncan asks us to consider why we never saw an Emperor Aetius or an Emperor Stilicho,

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
who were two such capable leaders who were not able to become Emperor.

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
And it was only a matter of time before someone like Odoacer came along,

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
and just neglected to appoint a puppet Emperor.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
And you see, this is the interesting thing about Roman history.

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
I can look at the exact same chain of events that someone might use to claim that

30:55.000 --> 31:01.000
migrants caused the fall of the Empire, and instead conclude that it was Rome's increasing xenophobia

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
and mistreatment of migrants that caused the fall of the Empire.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
You know, Rome didn't fall because of migration. There had always been migration.

31:08.000 --> 31:13.000
And for most of its history, Rome understood that when handled intelligently and compassionately,

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
migration is a benefit.

31:15.000 --> 31:20.000
Rome fell, in part anyway, when it started acting against this knowledge.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
And I'd like to wrap up here with a thought.

31:23.000 --> 31:30.000
If we simplify the armed force that took Ravenna and opposed the last Emperor to just immigrants,

31:30.000 --> 31:37.000
then yes, immigration, in a silly and misleading sense, caused the fall of the Western Roman Empire.

31:37.000 --> 31:43.000
However, by that exact same logic, immigration created the Roman Empire,

31:43.000 --> 31:48.000
because Romans, setting out from Rome, immigrated throughout the Mediterranean,

31:48.000 --> 31:53.000
taking over cities and civilizations, and filling them with Roman buildings,

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
and Roman people, and Roman legions.

31:56.000 --> 32:01.000
So if you're a fan of the Romans, then immigration is good, right?

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
Do you catch my drift? I've, like... I've flipped it.

32:05.000 --> 32:09.000
I've turned the argument back on itself. It's clever, that, isn't it?

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
Anyway, thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

32:12.000 --> 32:17.000
Like, subscribe, leave a comment, all the usual things.

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
Let me know what you feel about me doing just a straight history video.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
If I bored everyone to death, I apologize.

32:24.000 --> 32:29.000
Also, before I go, I need a name for my YouTube channel.

32:29.000 --> 32:35.000
It was called Sean and Jen, but Jen isn't involved in the YouTube videos at all anymore,

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
though don't worry, Jen fans, you can still find her over on Twitch.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
Anyway, I've taken Jen's name off the YouTube channel,

32:42.000 --> 32:48.000
but I can't just have a YouTube channel called Sean, can I? I don't know, anyway.

32:48.000 --> 32:52.000
So if anyone has any bright ideas, please leave them in a comment below this video.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
I'm very excited to see what you come up with.

32:55.000 --> 33:02.000
Also, a big thank you, as always, to all my supporters over on Patreon, who, also, as always,

33:02.000 --> 33:07.000
are scrolling by right now, feeling all smug and satisfied that they're in the credits.

33:07.000 --> 33:12.000
And if you'd like to be up there with them, consider pledging me a dollar or two.

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
Anyway, thanks a lot, and see you next time, folks.
