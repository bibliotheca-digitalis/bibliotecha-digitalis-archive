0	4000	Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about immigration.
4000	6000	Again, yes.
6000	11000	Specifically, immigration's capacity to destroy civilizations.
11000	16000	And we're going to be talking about one particular civilization that was destroyed by immigration,
16000	19000	and that is Nazi Germany.
19000	21000	How's that for a plot twist?
21000	24000	And so early in the video as well.
24000	29000	So let's talk about how immigration caused the downfall of Nazi Germany.
29000	33000	At the end of the 1930s, Germany was resurgent.
33000	38000	After struggling for many years with an economy in recession and a worthless currency,
38000	43000	the government initiated numerous public building projects to stabilize the economy
43000	45000	and put its citizens back to work.
45000	50000	The military was greatly expanded, and a combination of diplomacy and military action
50000	56000	secured many of the adjacent provinces to Germany and put them under direct German rule.
56000	64000	By the early 1940s, the vast majority of Europe was controlled either directly by Nazi Germany or by an ally.
64000	67000	Eventually, though, they ran into a problem,
67000	71000	and that problem is one that has felled many great civilizations throughout history.
71000	73000	Immigration.
73000	77000	Immigrants were attracted to Nazi Germany from all over.
77000	82000	In the East, great swarms of Russian immigrants crossed the border into German territory.
82000	87000	And from the UK, immigrants from a great many nations made the dangerous channel crossing,
87000	94000	often in small, unsafe boats, and their sheer number overwhelmed the German border forces.
94000	96000	And who were these immigrants?
96000	100000	Well, they certainly weren't a representative cross-section of wider society.
100000	104000	There were hardly any women, children, or elderly.
104000	107000	No, they were mainly young, military-aged males
107000	113000	who made absolutely no attempt to integrate into the culture of Nazi Germany.
113000	118000	In fact, they were frequently involved in violent clashes with German security forces,
118000	120000	which put a great strain on the state,
120000	128000	as well as carrying out various terrorist bombing campaigns to frighten the populace and destroy vital German infrastructure.
128000	134000	Germany proved completely unable to handle the sheer scale of the migrant crisis,
134000	141000	and eventually, they were overwhelmed completely, and their civilization was destroyed.
141000	145000	Now then, what was all that rubbish I just said?
145000	147000	Well, I want to make two points about it.
147000	150000	The first is, it was all nonsense.
150000	155000	Obviously, sort of a pointless, misleading bunch of gibberish.
155000	160000	The second thing I want to say about it, though, is that technically, actually,
160000	163000	nothing that I just said was untrue,
163000	168000	as long as we don't mind stretching certain definitions of words to the breaking point, anyway,
168000	171000	because that was the problem with what I just said.
171000	173000	The actual events did happen as stated,
173000	180000	but the terminology that I used to describe them happening was obviously incorrect and misleading.
180000	186000	The immigrants were actually foreign soldiers loyal to governments that were at war with Nazi Germany.
186000	190000	They were only migrants in the sense that they went from one place to another.
190000	197000	The point of my Nazi Germany example there is to show how misleading contemporary political terminology,
197000	202000	with all its associated implications, can be if we apply it to events from the distant past.
202000	207000	You see, we're all, of course, familiar on some level with the events of the Second World War,
207000	212000	it being relatively recent, so my deceptive language there really stood out.
212000	217000	Modern audiences will be less familiar with events from ancient history, though.
217000	221000	The fall of Rome, for instance, which is what this video is actually about.
221000	224000	So we'll try and keep that in mind going forward.
224000	228000	When someone points to the ancient world to make a point about the modern one,
228000	231000	don't take what they say at face value,
231000	235000	because it might be just as misleading as my little history of World War II right there.
235000	241000	So then, with that in mind, did immigration cause the fall of Rome?
241000	245000	This video is sort of a companion piece to my previous video about Rome,
245000	249000	which was a response to Stefan Molyneux's claims that loose morality,
249000	255000	women's rights, taxation, and various other things were the cause of the fall of Rome.
255000	260000	And starting out here, I'll repeat a few things to be considered from that video.
260000	264000	Firstly, when people say the fall of the Roman Empire,
264000	267000	they usually mean the fall of the Western Roman Empire,
267000	270000	because the Eastern half kept on going for another thousand years.
270000	275000	Until someone invented a cannon strong enough to bring down the walls of Constantinople,
275000	280000	which in itself highlights the more practical and tangible reasons that empires often fall.
280000	284000	Not due to some degradation of morality or national spirit,
284000	289000	but instead because someone invented a really big gun and shot them with it.
289000	295000	Virtue and spirit are all well and good, but they're not going to stop a 600 pound cannonball.
295000	299000	So anyway, we're going to be talking about the fall of the Western Roman Empire,
299000	302000	which most historians date to 476 AD,
302000	306000	when a chieftain called Odoacer revolted against the Empire
306000	311000	and deposed Romulus Augustus, the last emperor of the West.
311000	316000	And I see two approaches online when someone's attempting to pin the fall of the Roman Empire
316000	322000	onto one singular event or concept, with the aim of making a modern political point.
322000	325000	The first is one of direct comparison.
325000	330000	The Roman Empire is the EU, and the Germanic tribes who fought against Rome
330000	335000	are directly analogous to modern migrants and asylum seekers, for instance.
335000	341000	Now this approach is easily foiled by simply pointing out the many differences in the two situations.
341000	347000	Ravenna fell because it was captured by a military loyal to a rebellious enemy king.
347000	351000	For an actual direct historical comparison to be legitimate,
351000	355000	we'd need to see something like an army of former Syrian, say, allies,
355000	361000	revolting against the EU and then invading Europe and occupying Brussels or something.
361000	366000	This reclassification of an enemy armed force to simply immigrants
366000	369000	is every bit as misleading as my Nazi Germany example.
369000	372000	Now the other approach you see is the more interesting one,
372000	378000	the one that acknowledges the differences between given historical and contemporary situations,
378000	382000	but makes the case that there are enough similarities to justify the comparison.
382000	385000	And that's a little more interesting to talk about.
385000	390000	For instance, in 376 AD, 100 years before the fall of Ravenna,
390000	396000	Rome did have to deal with a migrant crisis which led to a costly war, the Gothic War,
396000	402000	during a precarious time in Roman history when the Empire could ill afford costly wars.
402000	406000	And it is this crisis that various clever clogs who know their Roman history
406000	410000	often cite when making the argument that immigration led to the fall of Rome.
410000	414000	And so we'll also be talking about that migrant crisis today.
414000	417000	But before we get to that specifically, however,
417000	421000	I'd like to talk about a few relevant events from throughout Roman history,
421000	426000	which I think are key to understanding exactly how and why the Gothic War started.
426000	430000	And I'd like to kick off by asking a question, and it's quite a big one.
430000	434000	What actually did cause the fall of the Roman Empire?
434000	438000	And the interesting thing about the various singular reasons we could cite here
438000	441000	is that since Roman history covers such a huge amount of time,
441000	446000	and Rome itself existed under so many varying forms of organization and government,
446000	453000	there's invariably an alternate example from Roman history that counters any one reason by itself.
453000	457000	Now, for instance, we could look at the fall of Rome strictly militarily.
457000	462000	Rome fell because it was defeated in battle in a very practical sense.
462000	466000	But then we can look through Rome's history to all the other times it was defeated in battle.
466000	469000	The Carthaginian general Hannibal, for example,
469000	474000	inflicted a string of costly defeats upon the Romans during the Second Punic War.
474000	478000	He defeated Rome in the Battle of Trebia, the Battle of Lake Trasimene,
478000	482000	and the Battle of Cannae, which was one of the costliest defeats Rome ever suffered,
482000	485000	and one of the bloodiest battles in human history,
485000	489000	with up to 70,000 Romans killed or captured in a single day,
489000	494000	including a sitting consul for that year and up to 80 senators.
494000	499000	Rome was also no stranger to losing battles against the various Germanic peoples.
499000	503000	In one of the other great losses in Roman history, the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest,
503000	509000	three entire Roman legions were ambushed and destroyed by an alliance of Germanic tribes.
509000	512000	Now, Rome did not fall after these defeats.
512000	518000	Rome's great military strength was not necessarily that they were invincible on the battlefield,
518000	520000	although, of course, they were very strong.
520000	524000	It was their ability to absorb and recover from defeats.
524000	529000	The sheer size of the empire, as well as its organization and logistics,
529000	532000	meant that Rome could handle the occasional military loss,
532000	535000	which was a rare thing in the ancient world.
535000	538000	Look at the rebellion of Boudica, for instance.
538000	542000	Boudica's rebellion defeated the Romans at Camulodonum,
542000	545000	they sacked the city, they destroyed the 9th Legion,
545000	548000	they sacked Londinium, they sacked Verulamium,
548000	551000	and then they lost one battle to the Romans,
551000	555000	and the rebellion was broken and Boudica committed suicide.
555000	559000	For most ancient military forces, this was how it went.
559000	563000	Being defeated meant just that you were defeated.
563000	568000	For the Romans, though, if a legion was defeated, they just sent another legion.
568000	572000	Rome's enemies usually had to win every single time,
572000	575000	whereas Rome often only had to win once.
575000	578000	So Rome was clearly no stranger to military losses
578000	581000	and was always previously able to recover.
581000	584000	And so, at the end of the empire, we have to ask,
584000	587000	what happened to that ability?
587000	591000	Why didn't Rome recover the final time? What was different?
591000	595000	And this is where we have to look beyond strictly singular reasons that Rome fell,
595000	599000	because any one reason can't tell us the whole story, clearly.
599000	605000	So by the time it fell, Rome had lost its ability to recover from military defeats the way it had in the past,
605000	608000	but it had lost other important abilities too.
608000	612000	For instance, the ability to make and maintain allies.
612000	614000	So let's talk about that for a while.
614000	619000	And to introduce this concept, we're gonna read a little of the Annals of Tacitus.
619000	623000	This section chronicling a debate in 48 AD in the Roman Senate
623000	627000	during the reign of Emperor Claudius, who is my favorite emperor,
627000	632000	being a very interesting character and a historian himself, so he knew his stuff.
632000	637000	The debate was to answer whether or not Rome should allow Gauls to be appointed to public office in Rome.
637000	641000	Gaul being roughly the territory covered by modern-day France,
641000	644000	which had at this point been conquered by Rome.
644000	648000	Now Gauls, being provincials, had certain rights in the Roman political system,
648000	653000	but were ineligible to run for public office or sit as senators in Rome.
653000	654000	And I quote,
654000	658000	In the consulship of Aulus Vitellius and Lucius Phipps Darnus,
658000	661000	the question of filling up the Senate was discussed,
661000	664000	and the chief men of Gallia Comata, as it was called,
664000	668000	who had long possessed the rights of allies and of Roman citizens,
668000	672000	sought the privilege of obtaining public offices at Rome.
672000	674000	There was much talk of every kind on the subject,
674000	678000	and it was argued before the emperor would fayament opposition.
678000	684000	Italy, it was asserted, is not so feeble as to be unable to furnish its own capital with the Senate.
684000	689000	Once, our native-born citizens sufficed for peoples of our own kin,
689000	693000	and we are by no means dissatisfied with the Rome of the past.
693000	700000	To this day we cite examples which under our old customs the Roman character exhibited as to valor and renown.
700000	705000	Is it a small thing that the Veneti and Insuris have already burst into the Senate house
705000	711000	unless a mob of foreigners, a troop of captives, so to say, is now forced upon us?
711000	715000	What distinctions will be left for the remnants of our noble houses,
715000	718000	or for any impoverished senators from Latium?
718000	724000	Every place will be crowded with these millionaires whose ancestors of the second and third generations
724000	729000	at the head of hostile tribes destroyed our armies with fire and sword,
729000	732000	and actually besieged the divine Julius at Alesia.
732000	734000	These are recent memories.
734000	738000	What if there were to rise up the remembrance of those who fell in Rome's citadel,
738000	741000	and are heralded by the hands of these same barbarians?
741000	744000	Let them enjoy indeed the title of citizens,
744000	748000	but let them not vulgarize the distinctions of the Senate and the honors of office.
748000	753000	So that's how Tacitus recounts the opposing side of the argument there,
753000	757000	and it goes that Rome does not need foreigners to fill its senatorial ranks,
757000	760000	and admitting them would vulgarize the office.
761000	767000	Also mentioned are events from the Gallic Wars, such as Julius Caesar being besieged at Alesia,
767000	773000	as well as the sack of Rome in or around 390 BC by a Gallic tribe, the Senones.
773000	781000	The Gauls were relatively recent enemies of Rome, it was argued, and thus should not be granted full rights.
781000	784000	And let's keep reading and see Claudius' response.
784000	788000	These and like arguments failed to impress the emperor.
788000	793000	He at once addressed himself to answer them, and thus harangued the assembled Senate.
793000	798000	My ancestors, the most ancient of whom was made at once a citizen and a noble of Rome,
798000	805000	encouraged me to govern by the same policy of transferring to this city all conspicuous merit, wherever found.
805000	809000	What was the ruin of Sparta and Athens but this?
809000	815000	That mighty as they were in war, they spurned from them as aliens those whom they had conquered.
815000	819000	Our founder Romulus, on the other hand, was so wise that he fought as enemies
819000	824000	and then hailed as fellow citizens several nations on the very same day.
824000	826000	Strangers have reigned over us.
826000	831000	That freedmen's sons should be entrusted with public offices is not, as many wrongly think,
831000	835000	a sudden innovation, but was a common practice in the old Commonwealth.
835000	839000	But it will be said, we have fought with the Senones.
839000	843000	I suppose then that the Volske and Aquae never stood an array against us.
843000	848000	Our city was taken by the Gauls while we also gave hostages to the Etruscans
848000	851000	and passed under the yoke of the Samnites.
851000	857000	On the whole, if you review all our wars, never has one been finished in a shorter time than with the Gauls.
857000	861000	Thenceforth, they have preserved an unbroken and loyal peace.
861000	865000	United as they now are with us by manners, education, and intermarriage,
865000	869000	let them bring us their gold and their wealth rather than enjoy it in isolation.
869000	874000	Everything, Senators, which we now hold to be of the highest antiquity, was once new.
874000	879000	Plebeian magistrates came after patrician, Latin magistrates after plebeian,
879000	882000	magistrates of other Italian peoples after Latin.
882000	885000	This practice too will establish itself,
885000	890000	and what we are this day justifying by precedence will be itself a precedent.
890000	892000	So what is Claudius saying there?
892000	897000	Well, in this section here, he first lists a Gallic tribe that was at war with Rome,
897000	899000	but then two Italian ones.
899000	906000	And he's saying, yes, the Gauls were at war with us, but so too were the cities we now control in Italy.
906000	912000	We suffered defeats at the hands of the Gauls, but we've also suffered defeats at the hands of Italians.
912000	918000	And we should welcome the defeated as allies, lest we face the same fate as Athens or Sparta.
918000	922000	In short, those opposing the Gauls being admitted into the Senate said,
922000	926000	hey, we don't need these foreigners coming over here telling us how to run things.
926000	932000	And Claudius responds, well, half of us sitting here were also once foreigners to Rome,
932000	936000	so maybe chill out about it a bit and it'll be fine.
936000	940000	It loses something in translation like that, but there you go.
940000	945000	And what I'd like you to take away from that little scene there is that for Claudius,
945000	954000	one of Rome's great strengths was its ability to turn former enemies into allies, like Goku.
954000	958000	And I'd like to elaborate a little on a conflict from Roman history
958000	962000	involving some of the Italian tribes mentioned by Claudius there.
962000	967000	From 91 to 88 BC, the Roman Republic fought the Social War,
967000	970000	also known as the War of the Allies,
970000	974000	which saw several Italian city-states rise up in revolt against Rome.
974000	978000	And the reasoning behind this conflict is especially noteworthy here.
978000	984000	So then, prior to the Social War, Rome had effective control of the whole Italian peninsula.
984000	987000	They had defeated or allied with the other tribes and city-states
987000	991000	and had the ability to both tax and demand military aid from them.
991000	993000	And this was not an insignificant thing.
993000	999000	By the 2nd century BC, Rome's Italian allies comprised a majority of its military forces.
999000	1003000	But, even though the allies were being taxed by Rome,
1003000	1005000	as well as being made to fight in Rome's wars,
1005000	1010000	they received a disproportionately small share of the spoils and land.
1010000	1013000	And they did not have Roman citizenship rights.
1013000	1017000	And the allies were increasingly ticked off about this.
1017000	1019000	Any Americans listening will know the term,
1019000	1022000	no taxation without representation.
1022000	1025000	Well, this was kind of one of those situations.
1025000	1028000	Now, a Roman politician called Marcus Livius Drusus
1028000	1031000	attempted to address this problem in 91 BC
1031000	1035000	by introducing reforms that would grant the allies Roman citizenship,
1035000	1040000	which would probably have been a smart move, given they were on the verge of open rebellion.
1040000	1047000	The response of the Roman Senate, however, was to ignore the problem and have Drusus assassinated.
1047000	1050000	And as a result, the Social War broke out almost immediately.
1050000	1053000	So, good move there, Roman Senate.
1053000	1058000	Rome eventually won the Social War, but they did not have an easy time of it by any means,
1058000	1064000	suffering several losses, and notably, they were forced to offer a major concession to the allies
1064000	1066000	to get them to stop fighting.
1066000	1068000	Full Roman citizenship.
1068000	1071000	Which is what the allies wanted in the first place.
1071000	1074000	So, why am I telling you about the Social War?
1074000	1080000	Well, first off, it's a time in Roman history when they had to learn an important lesson the hard way.
1080000	1085000	Do not, as Claudius says, treat those you've conquered as aliens.
1085000	1091000	Or, at the very least, don't give increasing amounts of military power to people with no political power,
1091000	1095000	because before long, they will use the former to take the latter.
1095000	1100000	The other reason I mention the Social War is that Odoacer's rebellion, centuries later,
1100000	1105000	the one that deposed the last Roman emperor, was triggered in much the same way.
1105000	1111000	Odoacer was a military leader who, in the summer of 476 AD,
1111000	1117000	visited Ravenna and asked Orestes, who was the father of the teenage emperor, Romulus Augustus,
1117000	1120000	to make good on various promises.
1120000	1125000	You see, Orestes had himself deposed the previous emperor, Julius Nepos,
1125000	1131000	and he had promised Odoacer's soldiers land on which to settle if they supported his rebellion.
1131000	1137000	However, when it came time to grant the land for the soldiers, Orestes reneged on his promise.
1137000	1144000	Now, a more forward-thinking man might have questioned the logic of refusing to pay a mercenary army,
1144000	1148000	a mercenary army that clearly have no qualms about overthrowing a Roman emperor,
1148000	1152000	given that they'd just done that exact same thing to the last guy,
1152000	1157000	so Orestes really, super, incredibly should have paid them.
1157000	1162000	Predictably, Odoacer and his men didn't like not being paid and broke into open revolt,
1162000	1166000	and they sacked a bunch of cities, defeated Orestes in the field,
1166000	1169000	took Ravenna, deposed young Romulus Augustus,
1169000	1173000	and that's all she wrote for the Western Roman Empire.
1173000	1176000	Now, it's not a direct one-to-one comparison by any means,
1176000	1180000	but both the Social War and Odoacer's rebellion have a few similarities.
1180000	1187000	Non-Roman armies fighting for Rome but being refused what they feel is an equal share of the spoils.
1187000	1191000	Military power being in the hands of people with limited political power,
1191000	1195000	and both situations show the danger of mistreating your allies
1195000	1198000	when they make up the majority of your military forces.
1198000	1201000	You see, in the latter days of the Empire especially,
1201000	1205000	Rome increasingly relied upon mercenaries to fight their battles for them,
1205000	1210000	which works perfectly fine right up until you don't pay them, like Orestes found out.
1210000	1216000	There are also stories of people fighting Rome who didn't necessarily want to.
1216000	1218000	Both conflicts were entirely avoidable.
1218000	1224000	You know, the Italian allies wanted rights and Odoacer's troops wanted payment and land on which to settle,
1224000	1230000	but they only rebelled when denied those things that they felt their military service had earned for them.
1230000	1234000	And notably, these peoples wanted to be part of Roman society.
1234000	1238000	They wanted to live on Roman land and have Roman rights.
1238000	1240000	And it's an interesting thing.
1240000	1245000	For many, being in the Empire was seen as a benefit, and that's how it had to be.
1245000	1250000	It would be impossible for Rome to hold its whole Empire by military force alone.
1250000	1254000	For most provinces in the Empire, particularly the interior provinces,
1254000	1260000	seeing a Roman legion at all, let alone a battle, would be a very rare occurrence.
1260000	1263000	Rome's forces were most often found on its frontiers,
1263000	1270000	and the Empire was far too large and populous for the legions to hold it all if everyone decided to rebel at once.
1270000	1275000	Now, they didn't rebel because, for the most part anyway, they wanted to be in the Empire,
1275000	1279000	and migration into the Empire occurred throughout its whole history.
1279000	1287000	For instance, emperors Diocletian and Constantine both resettled tribes from outside to inside the Empire,
1287000	1290000	with the aim of negating the threat they posed as outsiders,
1290000	1296000	as well as providing more people to work, pay taxes, and be recruited into the legions.
1296000	1303000	In the first century AD, a Roman governor of Moesia was recorded as transferring 100,000 people
1303000	1307000	of those living across the Danube into the Empire with, I quote,
1307000	1310000	"...their wives, children, chiefs, and kings."
1310000	1315000	And this was recorded in a dedication to him as one of his great achievements.
1315000	1322000	And that's something you wouldn't see today, is a politician bragging about bringing 100,000 migrants into the country.
1322000	1329000	So Rome did have a history of successfully and peacefully managing migrations into the Empire.
1329000	1333000	And so now we come to the Gothic War, which I mentioned earlier.
1333000	1337000	The war that followed a migration of Gothic tribes into the Empire.
1337000	1340000	And so we have to ask, what went wrong?
1340000	1346000	What was done differently in that case to distinguish it from the successful migrations?
1346000	1351000	So in 376 AD, a large number of Gothic peoples arrived on the Danube River,
1351000	1357000	which was the border of Roman territory, and asked if they could settle inside the Empire.
1357000	1361000	The Goths were fleeing from the Huns, who were currently riding around on horseback,
1361000	1365000	shooting arrows at people, and generally just being menacing.
1365000	1369000	The Goths sent envoys to the Eastern Roman Emperor, Valens, saying,
1369000	1372000	"...hey, can we move in with you, please?"
1372000	1379000	And Valens said, okay, that sounds neat, you know, I can tax you, you can join the legions, let's do it.
1379000	1383000	I'm streamlining the actual historical record here, if you hadn't noticed.
1383000	1390000	Now, this correspondence took some time, as Valens was off preparing for a campaign against the Sassanid Empire in the East.
1390000	1394000	Now, firstly, since the Emperor was preparing for war on another front,
1394000	1398000	he had left only a skeleton crew manning the Danube border.
1398000	1406000	And secondly, since the correspondence took a while, the Goths had thousands of people all sitting put on a riverbank for a very long time,
1406000	1408000	and they started to run out of provisions.
1408000	1411000	So when they began crossing the river into Rome,
1411000	1417000	they were coming as a hungry and desperate people who outnumbered the Roman border force.
1417000	1419000	And they were armed, too.
1419000	1423000	In the relevant section of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,
1423000	1429000	historian Edward Gibbon notes that one of the various ways this migration differed from the previous migrations
1429000	1436000	was that the Goths managed to keep hold of their arms via a series of extravagant bribes to corrupt Roman officials.
1436000	1444000	And those bribed Roman officials turned a blind eye and did not disarm the incoming migrants, as was the standard practice.
1444000	1452000	So the Goths were armed, desperate, hungry, and locally, at least, outnumbered the Roman military.
1452000	1455000	Kind of a precarious situation.
1455000	1460000	But, however, not one that necessarily had to lead to violence.
1460000	1465000	I mean, the Goths wanted to be part of the Roman Empire, and they'd come in peace.
1465000	1471000	As long as the Romans weren't actively antagonistic towards the Goths, there's no reason they couldn't have been resupplied,
1471000	1476000	apportioned some land, and set to work churning out taxes and soldiers.
1476000	1480000	Enter Lupercenus, a Roman lieutenant of Emperor Valens,
1480000	1485000	who was in charge of the military government in the area where the Goths were crossing the border.
1485000	1489000	And I will now read you his entire Wikipedia article.
1490000	1497000	Lupercenus was a Roman lieutenant of Valens in Thrace in the late 4th century AD.
1497000	1505000	His reputed poor treatment of the Ferevingi Goths under Fritigern led to the Gothic Wars and the Battle of Adrianople.
1505000	1507000	Wonderfully short and to the point there.
1507000	1514000	Now, if we click through, the Battle of Adrianople is an upcoming battle between the Goths and the Romans,
1514000	1519000	which is an overwhelming defeat for the Romans and in which the Emperor Valens dies.
1519000	1522000	Furthermore, from Wikipedia,
1537000	1538000	What a jerk.
1538000	1542000	So what did he actually do that was so bad it started a war?
1543000	1547000	Well, upon encountering the masses of hungry and desperate Goths,
1547000	1552000	Lupercenus and the rest of the Roman border forces saw the Roman equivalent of dollar signs.
1552000	1558000	They sold the Goths food at exorbitant prices, quickly stripping them of their wealth and valuables.
1558000	1562000	And when the Goths ran out of things to trade for food,
1562000	1568000	the Romans started accepting as payment Gothic children, who were then sold into slavery.
1568000	1575000	And I'll quote Roman soldier and historian Ammianus Marcellinus here, talking about the greed of the Roman commanders.
1598000	1604000	Which, even if they were to choose their own judges, must appear wholly unpardonable, must be mentioned.
1608000	1613000	When the barbarians who had been conducted across the river were in great distress from want of provisions,
1613000	1618000	those detested generals conceived the idea of a most disgraceful traffic.
1618000	1623000	And having collected hounds from all quarters with the most insatiable rapacity,
1624000	1630000	they exchanged them for an equal number of slaves, among whom were several sons of men of noble birth.
1630000	1635000	Whew, that's a bit of a mouthful, that bit. That took a few takes, and no mistake.
1635000	1637000	And what did it say?
1637000	1643000	Well, the Romans forced the Goths to sell their children into slavery for dog meat.
1643000	1646000	Which is pretty rubbish behaviour, frankly.
1646000	1652000	And I just want to point out and make clear, Marcellinus places the blame for what is about to happen,
1652000	1657000	squarely on the greedy Roman commanders, rather than the migrant Goths.
1657000	1663000	So anyway, the Goths were pretty ticked off at this children for dog meat scam the Romans were running,
1663000	1665000	to put it somewhat lightly.
1665000	1669000	And I'm sure one or two of them probably started doing a little mental arithmetic,
1669000	1674000	and possibly noticing that there were a lot more of them than there were Roman gods.
1674000	1680000	And so grumbling turned into shouting, and shouting into fighting.
1680000	1686000	Now, Luperkinus, correctly fearful that he was about to have a full-blown revolt on his hands,
1686000	1692000	decided to help speed things along a bit by inviting a bunch of the Gothic leaders to a banquet,
1692000	1697000	and then, when they were there, executing their guards and imprisoning them.
1697000	1703000	Which is very odd behaviour, maybe he was an ancient accelerationist, who knows.
1703000	1708000	Anyway, after Luperkinus read weddinged a bunch of their chiefs, war was unavoidable.
1709000	1710000	Obviously.
1710000	1714000	And though Rome would technically win, it would be only a Pyrrhic victory,
1714000	1719000	with the later Battle of Adrianople being particularly costly for the Romans.
1719000	1724000	It also changed how Rome dealt with barbarian tribes going forward.
1724000	1730000	The huge difficulty the Empire had in winning the Gothic war exposed it as something of a paper tiger,
1730000	1735000	and migrating groups were now able to negotiate with Rome on their own terms.
1735000	1739000	And as a result, people like the Visigoths were able to settle inside the Empire,
1739000	1745000	while remaining a unified people, loyal to their own leaders, rather than the Emperor.
1745000	1750000	They were living in the Empire, but they had not integrated into the Empire.
1750000	1753000	All this brings me to my main point.
1753000	1759000	So often, the expectation to integrate is placed entirely on the migrant people.
1760000	1763000	However, that isn't how integration works.
1763000	1765000	Integration is a two-way street.
1765000	1770000	The Gothic war was the result of Rome's failure to integrate the Goths.
1770000	1776000	It was just one more of Rome's abilities that they had lost near the end of the Western Empire.
1776000	1782000	Rather than turning enemies into allies, Rome was now instead turning potential allies into enemies.
1782000	1787000	And this next point is shamelessly stolen from Mike Duncan's History of Rome podcast,
1787000	1790000	which you should listen to if you haven't, because it's great.
1790000	1796000	In the conclusion to his series, Duncan wonders what the Western Roman Empire could have been
1796000	1800000	had it successfully integrated the various Germanic peoples.
1800000	1804000	You see, increasingly near the end of the Western Roman Empire,
1804000	1808000	the most powerful and capable leaders were of Germanic origin.
1808000	1816000	However, Rome's unwillingness to see a German as Emperor imposed a ceiling on the political power they could attain.
1816000	1819000	And that's why, at the end, we start seeing puppet Emperors.
1819000	1824000	You know, Emperors of the correct birthplace and from the correct families,
1824000	1830000	placed onto the imperial throne to act as proxies for the Germanic generals who had the real military power.
1830000	1836000	Duncan asks us to consider why we never saw an Emperor Aetius or an Emperor Stilicho,
1836000	1840000	who were two such capable leaders who were not able to become Emperor.
1840000	1844000	And it was only a matter of time before someone like Odoacer came along,
1845000	1848000	and just neglected to appoint a puppet Emperor.
1848000	1851000	And you see, this is the interesting thing about Roman history.
1851000	1855000	I can look at the exact same chain of events that someone might use to claim that
1855000	1861000	migrants caused the fall of the Empire, and instead conclude that it was Rome's increasing xenophobia
1861000	1864000	and mistreatment of migrants that caused the fall of the Empire.
1864000	1868000	You know, Rome didn't fall because of migration. There had always been migration.
1868000	1873000	And for most of its history, Rome understood that when handled intelligently and compassionately,
1873000	1875000	migration is a benefit.
1875000	1880000	Rome fell, in part anyway, when it started acting against this knowledge.
1880000	1883000	And I'd like to wrap up here with a thought.
1883000	1890000	If we simplify the armed force that took Ravenna and opposed the last Emperor to just immigrants,
1890000	1897000	then yes, immigration, in a silly and misleading sense, caused the fall of the Western Roman Empire.
1897000	1903000	However, by that exact same logic, immigration created the Roman Empire,
1903000	1908000	because Romans, setting out from Rome, immigrated throughout the Mediterranean,
1908000	1913000	taking over cities and civilizations, and filling them with Roman buildings,
1913000	1916000	and Roman people, and Roman legions.
1916000	1921000	So if you're a fan of the Romans, then immigration is good, right?
1922000	1925000	Do you catch my drift? I've, like... I've flipped it.
1925000	1929000	I've turned the argument back on itself. It's clever, that, isn't it?
1929000	1932000	Anyway, thanks a lot for watching, everyone.
1932000	1937000	Like, subscribe, leave a comment, all the usual things.
1937000	1941000	Let me know what you feel about me doing just a straight history video.
1941000	1944000	If I bored everyone to death, I apologize.
1944000	1949000	Also, before I go, I need a name for my YouTube channel.
1949000	1955000	It was called Sean and Jen, but Jen isn't involved in the YouTube videos at all anymore,
1955000	1959000	though don't worry, Jen fans, you can still find her over on Twitch.
1959000	1962000	Anyway, I've taken Jen's name off the YouTube channel,
1962000	1968000	but I can't just have a YouTube channel called Sean, can I? I don't know, anyway.
1968000	1972000	So if anyone has any bright ideas, please leave them in a comment below this video.
1972000	1975000	I'm very excited to see what you come up with.
1975000	1982000	Also, a big thank you, as always, to all my supporters over on Patreon, who, also, as always,
1982000	1987000	are scrolling by right now, feeling all smug and satisfied that they're in the credits.
1987000	1992000	And if you'd like to be up there with them, consider pledging me a dollar or two.
1992000	1996000	Anyway, thanks a lot, and see you next time, folks.
