00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,120
So, I have a little confession to make.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:10,360
I had an idea for a video while looking at Stefan Molyneux's The Truth About X series.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,200
In particular, his videos about popular contemporary movies.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,120
Now, my idea was to watch all of those videos and make a sort of rapid-fire,

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,200
reverse, Cinemasins-style debunking video,

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,200
where I point out all the time Stefan screwed up,

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,200
or misremembered something,

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,600
or misrepresented what was in the movie.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,600
And so on.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,800
So, I sat down with my notebook and put the first one on.

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,200
The Truth About Wonder Woman.

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,400
Now, as I watched this video,

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,000
I very quickly realized that my original idea was not gonna pan out.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You see, Stefan gets so many things wrong about just this one particular movie

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,600
that any response seeking to address all of his movie videos

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,000
would probably be several hours long.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,600
So, I had to abandon my original plan

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,200
and just concern myself with the truth about Wonder Woman today.

20
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,600
I'm very sorry.

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,600
And now, the reason I started out by watching that video

22
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,600
is because I was honestly looking forward to Stefan's take on the Wonder Woman movie.

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,600
And that's because, back in April,

24
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,200
Stefan posted this tweet.

25
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,600
Pasta in tomato sauce.

26
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,000
Now with feminist virtue signaling.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,800
And there's a photograph of a can of pasta in tomato sauce

28
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,200
with some female superheroes on it.

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,600
Wonder Woman included.

30
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,000
And I like this tweet a lot for a few reasons,

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and let me briefly run them by you.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,200
Firstly, I like the idea that a can of pasta is apparently feminist

33
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,400
because it has a picture of a cartoon lady on it.

34
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,200
Likewise, this is apparently virtue signaling,

35
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,200
although as to what virtues are being signaled here,

36
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
who knows?

37
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,600
The can just has a picture of Supergirl on it, that's it.

38
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,400
Unless no artificial flavors or preservatives is virtue signaling now.

39
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,200
I'm at a loss there.

40
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,400
The next thing I like about this tweet is that Stefan appears to have purchased

41
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,600
the can of pasta in tomato sauce

42
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
in order to complain about it.

43
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Which would be funny enough by itself, to be honest,

44
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,200
but as people were quick to point out to Stefan,

45
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,000
the cans also had versions with male superheroes on,

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,600
such as Superman and Batman.

47
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,600
Apparently the existence of male superheroes on cans of pasta

48
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,000
doesn't qualify as virtue signaling for whatever reason.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,600
This is Molyneux's projecting problem that I've spoken about in a previous video.

50
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Any depiction of a woman,

51
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,000
even a completely neutrally presented cartoon of a fictional woman

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,600
in a meaningless context, on a can of pasta even,

53
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,600
is apparently malicious, feminist virtue signaling now.

54
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,400
As if the mere fact that Supergirl or Wonder Woman exist at all

55
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,200
is somehow a problem.

56
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,800
So anyway, after seeing Stefan's take on a can of pasta with Wonder Woman on it,

57
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,800
how could I not be excited for his video review

58
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,800
of the Wonder Woman movie that came out this year?

59
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,800
Um, we know how much Stefan likes seeing women fight against men in movies,

60
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,200
and this movie has the all-female warrior race, the Amazons, in it,

61
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,200
so you know we're in for a good time.

62
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,600
So, let's get to it.

63
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,600
And we're gonna go about this semi-chronologically here.

64
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,200
We'll work through Stefan's video from start to finish,

65
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
with some skipping around as needed.

66
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,800
Um, and it should go without saying here,

67
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,400
there will be spoilers from this point on, so...

68
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
beware.

69
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
And let's begin.

70
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,200
So the artistry, charm and special effects, and one powerful twist

71
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,800
are the only things that rescue Wonder Woman from its own stultifying clichés.

72
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,400
First of all, I give you...

73
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,000
the clichés.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,200
One.

75
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,600
A female-run society is a paradise.

76
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,000
Now, there's a very good reason for this.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,400
You see, the island the Amazons live on is a paradise.

78
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,200
A literal, God-given paradise.

79
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,200
With his dying breath,

80
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,200
Zeus created this island to hide us from the outside world,

81
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,600
somewhere Ares could not find us.

82
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,800
We give thanks to the gods for giving us this paradise.

83
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,200
It's not a paradise because women live on it,

84
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,400
it's a paradise because Zeus,

85
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,200
a male god, by the way,

86
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,600
created it to be that way.

87
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,600
During the first scenes on the island of...

88
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,000
Well, let's just say it somewhat reminds me of the Greek island of Lesbos,

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,200
the skies are blue, the waterfalls seem to spill diamonds, and...

90
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,600
no woman seems to age much past 45.

91
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,800
Haha, the Amazons are gay.

92
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,400
Anyway, this is the first point in the video

93
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,200
that Stefan is confused about the fact that the Amazons don't age,

94
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,400
and he further expands on that point.

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,800
Now, of course, there are no old women on this island

96
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,600
because that would beg the question,

97
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,400
where are all these women coming from?

98
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Is there a gimp in a leather suit in a box used for sperm harvesting?

99
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,000
Are male babies killed off?

100
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,800
So, where are the old Amazons?

101
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,200
And without men, how are the Amazons being born?

102
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,200
Well, near the start of the movie, Diana's mother,

103
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,800
the queen of the Amazons,

104
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,600
explains all this to Diana as a child.

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,200
The Amazons were created by Zeus,

106
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,800
and we see them emerging from the sea as fully grown women.

107
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,000
And Diana's mother in this flashback

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,600
appears to be the exact same age as she is when she's reading the story,

109
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,800
so the Amazons aren't born, they were created by a god,

110
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
and they don't appear to age,

111
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,800
which explains both why there aren't any old Amazons,

112
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,400
and why they don't need any men on the island.

113
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,400
And if the literal picture book explained to a child method of exposition

114
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,800
was a bit too complicated for Stefan,

115
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,200
there are other clues cleverly hidden in the narrative.

116
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,400
For example, Diana ages from a child to a fully grown woman

117
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,600
without any other character on the island aging a day.

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,200
Isn't that odd?

119
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,600
Now, Diana ages, I presume, because she's not an Amazon.

120
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,800
Exactly, she was created differently from the rest of them as a child.

121
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,000
But even she ages very slowly.

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,800
And the big tip-off here is that the movie opens in the present day,

123
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,400
but the bulk of it is a flashback set in the First World War,

124
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,000
and Wonder Woman looks exactly the same in both times.

125
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,000
Didn't Stefan wonder why this was?

126
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,200
Did he not notice that that was unusual?

127
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,400
I don't know.

128
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,400
And these Amazons take the only man on the island and interrogate him.

129
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,800
When, logically, of course, they should be burying him in affirmative action programs.

130
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,800
Now, this is a minor point here,

131
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,000
but the Amazons interrogate him because he's dressed in the same uniform

132
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
as the soldiers who attacked them.

133
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,800
Because he's a spy.

134
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,000
You.

135
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,400
No, Mother, no!

136
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,000
You fought at my side against these babies.

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,400
What man fights against his own people?

138
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,200
These aren't my people.

139
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,200
And why do you wear their colors?

140
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,200
I can't tell you that.

141
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,200
So they interrogate him to find out why that is.

142
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,200
You know, they're not just doing it arbitrarily,

143
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,200
but, like I say, that's a minor point.

144
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,200
Cliche number two.

145
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Women are great warriors.

146
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Now, I've criticized female fighters in movies before

147
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,200
for taking on men three times their size with little or no prior training.

148
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,200
In this movie, Wonder Woman, whose actual name is Diana,

149
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,200
does go through years of rigorous training,

150
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,200
but gains supernatural powers somehow when she hits her late teens.

151
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,200
She magically throws back her trainer half the length of a football field

152
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,200
by blocking a sword blow with her golden bracers.

153
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,200
This new power has two primary meanings.

154
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,200
The first is the pushback of an abused child

155
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,200
who has grown bigger and stronger than her aging abuser.

156
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,200
The second is the displacement of an older woman's physical attractiveness

157
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,200
by a younger woman.

158
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
So there's a lot to unpack here.

159
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:05,200
First off, Wonder Woman's size doesn't matter.

160
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,200
She's a demigod with supernatural powers.

161
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
She can hold a tank over her head.

162
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,200
You know, the amount of training she does is,

163
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,200
with regards to fighting against human men, anyway,

164
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,200
completely inconsequential.

165
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,200
She's training to fight against Ares, the god of war.

166
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,200
She could crush a human man's head like a grape

167
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,200
even if she hadn't trained a day in her life because she's not human.

168
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Secondly, Stefan's two primary readings of the meaning of this scene are very telling.

169
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,200
The pushback of an abused child

170
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,200
and the displacement of an older woman's physical attractiveness by a younger woman.

171
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,200
Now, okay, I'm generally rather accepting of unconventional takes on movies.

172
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
I mean, I have to be.

173
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,200
I'm pals with the prequel Defender himself.

174
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,200
But I can't help but think Stefan is reaching a little too far here.

175
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Diana and her aunt appear to have a good relationship

176
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,200
so I'm not sure the abuser angle flies, really.

177
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,200
To me, this scene is just showing that Diana has some unexplained power

178
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,200
that differentiates her from the rest of the Amazons.

179
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,200
That seems to be the primary meaning of the scene

180
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
and, as we'll see later in the video,

181
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,200
it's a meaning that Stefan missed somehow.

182
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
But we'll get back to that later.

183
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
Cliche number three.

184
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,200
The hot Amazon supermodel librarian.

185
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,200
A beautiful woman who has no idea how attractive she is.

186
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
The dream of beta males everywhere

187
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,200
who've never listened to Stanley Kowalski from A Streetcar Named Desire

188
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,200
who says this to an erotic woman fishing for compliments.

189
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,200
I never met a dame yet that didn't know if she was good-looking or not without being told

190
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,200
and there's some of them that give themselves credit for more than they've got.

191
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Trust me, the lead actress may be playing a naive, otherworldly warrior

192
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,200
but in real life, she knows exactly how attractive she is.

193
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,200
She was a model who married a man who sold a hotel for $26 million.

194
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Here's a hint. You're not going to take off her thick glasses,

195
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,200
tell her she's beautiful, and have her fall in love with you.

196
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,200
So for cliche number three, I have three points to make. Isn't that nice?

197
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,200
The first is that Diana isn't human and has never interacted with human society

198
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,200
and therefore doesn't have the same ideas about what is appropriate behavior

199
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,200
or is attractive to the opposite sex.

200
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,200
She's never even met a man before the events of the movie.

201
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Have you never met a man before? What about your father?

202
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
I had no father.

203
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Secondly, it doesn't matter who the actor is, she's playing a character.

204
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:48,200
We know she's rich and famous in real life but that isn't supposed to affect the narrative of the film.

205
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,200
You know, does Stefan do this for other movies?

206
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Henry Cavill can't fly, he's just a regular human actor.

207
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,200
This film doesn't make any sense.

208
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:05,200
Thirdly, the idea that Diana is still very attractive, even if you cover her up and put glasses on her,

209
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,200
is actually stated outright in the film.

210
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,200
Yeah, really, Specs? Suddenly she's not the most beautiful woman you've ever seen.

211
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,200
The film's point here, one that it makes a few too many times for me to be honest,

212
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,200
is that yes, Diana is very attractive. Anyway...

213
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Cliche number four, the incomprehensibly jealous and angry villain.

214
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Now, the intergalactic badass in Wonder Woman is the god Ares,

215
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,200
who becomes jealous of Zeus' favorite created toy, humanity.

216
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,200
So this is basic sibling rivalry cliche 101.

217
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,200
The eldest sibling resents the younger sibling for the attention paid by the parents to the new arrival,

218
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
who has displaced him.

219
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,200
I have two points to make here, and the first one is kind of a minor nitpicky one.

220
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,200
Ares isn't an intergalactic villain.

221
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,200
He doesn't travel to or from another galaxy at any point.

222
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:05,200
And now I only bring this up because Stefan has previously misunderstood the word intergalactic.

223
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,200
Now I think he thinks it means, like, phenomenal or grand or something.

224
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Anyway...

225
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:20,200
Secondly here, Stefan says Ares, the god of war, being angry, is a cliche.

226
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,200
And if Stefan has a problem with the conflict between Zeus and Ares,

227
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,200
or Ares being violent and angry,

228
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,200
or even the Amazonian warrior women,

229
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,200
he really needs to take that up with the ancient Greeks.

230
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,200
You know, this narrative isn't the result of some modern, malicious Hollywood machination.

231
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,200
They're characters from Greek mythology.

232
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,200
And I thought Stefan was all about the ancient Greeks and western civilization and everything.

233
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,200
But I guess I must have been mistaken there.

234
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,200
Diana, princess of blow-dried hair, shopping and not eating, sorry.

235
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
Sorry, sorry.

236
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
Wrong, Princess Diana.

237
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:02,200
Diana, princess of thermosquita, possesses powers that make no sense at all.

238
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,200
So, Ares, the god of war, kills her father Zeus.

239
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Now, Ares has been provoking fights among mankind for thousands of years.

240
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:15,200
But Diana was molded of clay, and Zeus was supposed to have breathed life into her a few short years before the movie began.

241
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Diana is an Amazon, with superpowers.

242
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,200
But the Amazons are mere mortals, felled by a single bullet.

243
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,200
So first off, there was a conflict between Zeus and Ares,

244
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,200
during which Ares was injured and went into hiding.

245
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Now, Zeus was also injured and used the last of his strength to create the island paradise for the Amazons to live on.

246
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Now then, given that Diana ages incredibly slowly,

247
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:48,200
as shown by her appearing the same age over a period of 100 years from the First World War to the modern day,

248
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,200
Diana's childhood could have lasted hundreds or even thousands of years.

249
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
Who knows?

250
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,200
You know, Stefan saw a child age into a woman and thought,

251
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Oh, that probably took about 25 years.

252
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,200
But no, she's a demigod living on a supernatural island.

253
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,200
She doesn't age like regular humans.

254
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,200
Secondly, Diana isn't an Amazon.

255
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,200
And that's what the scene of her discovering her unique powers was supposed to represent.

256
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,200
But if you missed that, Stefan, there also was this line of dialogue.

257
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,200
As Amazons, this is our duty.

258
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,200
But you are not an Amazon like the rest of us.

259
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
So you will do nothing.

260
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,200
And movies must be very confusing indeed if you just ignore half of what happens in them.

261
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,200
Anyway, let's move on.

262
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Now, Chris Pine.

263
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,200
Chris Pine is, in fact, a charming pile of J. Crew waspy hotness

264
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,200
and helps carry the movie with his one-liners that shouldn't be one-liners.

265
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,200
Now, as the audience, you become attached to him and then, of course, he has to die

266
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:58,200
so that the population of the world always gets used to male disposability.

267
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,200
And even the way he dies makes no sense.

268
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:08,200
He's piloting a plane full of poison gas, which he chooses to blow up rather than, say, land safely.

269
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,200
Because why?

270
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,200
Landing the plane safely would allow the poison gas to be deactivated.

271
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:19,200
Blowing it up in mid-air will just spread the poison gas for hundreds of miles, causing countless deaths.

272
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:24,200
The prevention of which was the whole point and beguffin of the movie to begin with.

273
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:31,200
But you see, men must always be expendable, so plot and logic must be expendable as well.

274
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,200
So then, Chris Pine's sacrifice in order to blow up the poison gas plane.

275
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,200
Stefan doesn't understand why the plane can't just be landed safely,

276
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,200
but the movie does attempt to explain this.

277
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,200
If we can get on the radio, we can ask Flankor to shoot her down.

278
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:53,200
No, if it crashes, it'll wipe everyone out for 50 square miles. We gotta ground it.

279
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,200
Bad news. It's on a timer. If we ground it here, it's the same thing.

280
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:04,200
Stefan also doesn't understand why they have to blow the plane up, but the movie explains this as well.

281
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,200
Is it flammable, Chief?

282
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,200
Yes, you said it's hydrogen? It's flammable.

283
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:17,200
So the gas is going to be released on a timer and will disperse over a large area, killing everyone around.

284
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:22,200
But it is flammable, so if they explode the plane, the gas will burn up.

285
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,200
So Chris Pine flies the plane to a safe distance and then does just that.

286
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:33,200
Is it convoluted movie logic? A little bit, sure, but it does explain itself and it shouldn't be hard to follow.

287
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:41,200
And furthermore, the selfless sacrifice of a man also serves an important narrative purpose that is missed by Stefan,

288
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,200
and let's take a look at that.

289
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,200
And if you think I'm kidding about male disposability, think of this.

290
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,200
Remember the evil woman Dr. Poison who concocts the genocidal gas?

291
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,200
Remember how Wonder Woman spares her life?

292
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,200
She gets to live, the good guy doesn't.

293
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:06,200
So then, Diana spares the life of the evil Dr. Poison, and this proves male disposability, apparently.

294
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:13,200
But I feel like Stefan may have missed the point of this scene, if you couldn't believe such a thing.

295
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,200
You see, Ares is using her to say to Diana,

296
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Look, humans are rubbish. They're evil. They make weapons to kill each other with.

297
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,200
Let's team up and we'll go and get them.

298
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:33,200
And in response to this, Diana remembers Chris Pine and how nice he was, blowing himself up to save everyone.

299
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,200
And she says,

300
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:44,200
You see, the woman's actions are being used as the proof that mankind is evil.

301
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:50,200
And the man's noble sacrifice is being used as the counterargument that mankind is good.

302
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,200
And, of course, Diana spares the life of an unarmed opponent.

303
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,200
I mean, what's she gonna do? Just squish her with the tank or something?

304
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,200
You know, she's the hero at the climax of the movie.

305
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,200
I mean, what were you expecting to happen?

306
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:13,200
Actually, I'd kinda like that if Diana just dropped the tank on her completely unexpectedly.

307
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,200
That'd be quite good.

308
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,200
Now, as usual, almost all the on-screen deaths are male.

309
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,200
Female deaths are inevitably deployed as a plot device to heighten the stakes to raise attention.

310
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,200
Men die anonymously in quick succession. Women die slowly or off-screen.

311
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,200
Huh.

312
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:39,200
Using sympathy for women to provoke male aggression does not seem very feminist to me.

313
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,200
Ah, well, maybe it is. Hard to tell these days.

314
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:49,200
Now, I'm afraid this is one of those times that Stefan is correct only if we ignore the times where he's wrong.

315
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:57,200
For example, the battle at the start of the movie in which many Amazons are killed by German soldiers in quick succession.

316
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,200
But if we ignore this bit, though, Stefan makes an excellent point.

317
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:11,200
So, all men are evil or incompetent, except for non-white males, of course, with the exception of one, the Chris Pine character, who must die.

318
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Now, all women are wonderful and good, except for one, Dr. Poison, who gets to live.

319
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:25,200
Now, these few sentences are a real masterpiece of appearing to have an argument when, in fact, you don't really.

320
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
And let's think about this for a bit.

321
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:38,200
All men are presented as evil or incompetent, except for non-white males, of course, with the exception of one, Chris Pine, who has to die.

322
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Now, built into Stefan's all men statement, there are two exceptions.

323
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,200
All men are presented as evil only if we first discount the various presentations of men as not evil.

324
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,200
And if we do that, wow, point made, you know.

325
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,200
However, even with Stefan's caveats there, it's not true.

326
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:03,200
For example, all these white soldiers rushing across No Man's Land are presented pretty heroically,

327
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,200
and these liberated villagers seem like they're having a good time and they don't look evil or incompetent.

328
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:16,200
And there's also Charlie, who's generally a good guy, but I guess he falls under Stefan's classification of incompetent

329
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:23,200
because he doesn't want to fight anymore due to having PTSD, which, you know, would be a bit cruel and thoughtless.

330
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:30,200
But anyway, ultimately, the fairly uncomplicated message of the movie is that mankind can be good.

331
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:36,200
Stefan misses this because he's viewing the movie only along the racial and sexual lines that he's imposing.

332
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,200
You know, it's not enough that the principal male character is a heroic white man.

333
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:49,200
You know, not all the male characters are heroic white men, and as such, the movie is clearly anti-male, anti-white propaganda.

334
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:56,200
And what is the role of women in raising such nasty and violent men?

335
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:02,200
Completely absent from the film, of course. Men are just bad.

336
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:09,200
The women who raise them are just saints. For feminists and leftists, environment is everything.

337
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,200
You know, you are a criminal because you were raised poor in a poor neighborhood, except for men.

338
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:21,200
Well, they're just bad regardless of environment, regardless of the mothers and female daycare workers and female primary school teachers who raise them.

339
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:29,200
Regardless of the welfare state policies that women vote for, environment creates badness, except for boys raised by women.

340
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,200
Then, the badness of boys has absolutely nothing to do with women at all.

341
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:42,200
Well, again, the point of the movie is actually not that men are naturally just bad.

342
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:58,200
But regardless, does Stefan really want the movie to go into how the evil General Ludendorff, say, actually would have been a really nice guy but for the malicious actions of his abusive mother who raised him poorly?

343
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,200
Like, what on earth is that?

344
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,200
You know, we all remember this classic clip of Stefan I used in another video.

345
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:15,200
All the cold-hearted jerks who run the world came out of the vaginas of women who married assholes.

346
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:22,200
And I don't know how to make the world a better place without holding women accountable for choosing assholes!

347
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:28,200
All the evil men in the world came out of evil women's evil vaginas.

348
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:37,200
Now, it appears Stefan has convinced himself pretty well of this convoluted delusion because it seems he's now actually expecting to see it represented in reality.

349
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,200
And it's an interesting approach to art criticism, I guess.

350
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:50,200
Convince yourself of something truly mad, and then when you don't see any evidence of it, that proves the existence of the insidious conspiracy to cover it up.

351
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:58,200
So to any Stefan Molyneux fans watching this video, the reason that the movie doesn't go into the backstories of the violent German soldiers

352
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:05,200
and explore their abuse at the hands of their neglectful mothers who only went out with assholes and ignored all the nice guys

353
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,200
is because it would be really, really weird.

354
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,200
Anyway, that's about it for me today.

355
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Kind of a lighter one this time, but the other video I'm working on right now is about police shootings,

356
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,200
so I needed the levity, to be honest.

357
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,200
And I certainly had fun watching Stefan try to cram his ideology into the movie however he could.

358
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:33,200
I might come back to this again and check out the many, many other movies that Stefan tells us the truth about.

359
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,200
I hope you could hear the air quotes there.

360
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,200
Let me know what you think about that idea in the comments.

361
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:45,200
Also, consider supporting me on Patreon if you like, like all these lovely people right here.

362
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,200
I don't run ads on my videos and I'd like to keep it that way.

363
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,200
Also, follow me on Twitter or send me a curious cat question if you like.

364
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,200
I really like questions.

365
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,200
Okay folks, I'll see you next time.

366
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,200
I actually waved goodbye at my microphone then.

367
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
See ya.
