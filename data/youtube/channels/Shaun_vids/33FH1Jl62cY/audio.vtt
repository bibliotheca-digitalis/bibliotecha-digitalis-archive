00:00.000 --> 00:01.520
Hello, everyone.

00:01.520 --> 00:04.120
So, I have a little confession to make.

00:04.120 --> 00:10.360
I had an idea for a video while looking at Stefan Molyneux's The Truth About X series.

00:10.360 --> 00:14.200
In particular, his videos about popular contemporary movies.

00:14.200 --> 00:19.120
Now, my idea was to watch all of those videos and make a sort of rapid-fire,

00:19.120 --> 00:22.200
reverse, Cinemasins-style debunking video,

00:22.200 --> 00:25.200
where I point out all the time Stefan screwed up,

00:25.200 --> 00:27.200
or misremembered something,

00:27.200 --> 00:29.600
or misrepresented what was in the movie.

00:29.600 --> 00:30.600
And so on.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.800
So, I sat down with my notebook and put the first one on.

00:33.800 --> 00:36.200
The Truth About Wonder Woman.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.400
Now, as I watched this video,

00:38.400 --> 00:43.000
I very quickly realized that my original idea was not gonna pan out.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
You see, Stefan gets so many things wrong about just this one particular movie

00:48.000 --> 00:51.600
that any response seeking to address all of his movie videos

00:51.600 --> 00:54.000
would probably be several hours long.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.600
So, I had to abandon my original plan

00:56.600 --> 01:00.200
and just concern myself with the truth about Wonder Woman today.

01:00.200 --> 01:01.600
I'm very sorry.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.600
And now, the reason I started out by watching that video

01:04.600 --> 01:09.600
is because I was honestly looking forward to Stefan's take on the Wonder Woman movie.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.600
And that's because, back in April,

01:11.600 --> 01:14.200
Stefan posted this tweet.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.600
Pasta in tomato sauce.

01:16.600 --> 01:20.000
Now with feminist virtue signaling.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.800
And there's a photograph of a can of pasta in tomato sauce

01:23.800 --> 01:26.200
with some female superheroes on it.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.600
Wonder Woman included.

01:28.600 --> 01:32.000
And I like this tweet a lot for a few reasons,

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
and let me briefly run them by you.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.200
Firstly, I like the idea that a can of pasta is apparently feminist

01:39.200 --> 01:42.400
because it has a picture of a cartoon lady on it.

01:42.400 --> 01:46.200
Likewise, this is apparently virtue signaling,

01:46.200 --> 01:49.200
although as to what virtues are being signaled here,

01:49.200 --> 01:50.200
who knows?

01:50.200 --> 01:53.600
The can just has a picture of Supergirl on it, that's it.

01:53.600 --> 01:58.400
Unless no artificial flavors or preservatives is virtue signaling now.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.200
I'm at a loss there.

02:00.200 --> 02:04.400
The next thing I like about this tweet is that Stefan appears to have purchased

02:04.400 --> 02:06.600
the can of pasta in tomato sauce

02:06.600 --> 02:08.600
in order to complain about it.

02:08.600 --> 02:11.600
Which would be funny enough by itself, to be honest,

02:11.600 --> 02:14.200
but as people were quick to point out to Stefan,

02:14.200 --> 02:18.000
the cans also had versions with male superheroes on,

02:18.000 --> 02:20.600
such as Superman and Batman.

02:21.200 --> 02:24.600
Apparently the existence of male superheroes on cans of pasta

02:24.600 --> 02:28.000
doesn't qualify as virtue signaling for whatever reason.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.600
This is Molyneux's projecting problem that I've spoken about in a previous video.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.600
Any depiction of a woman,

02:34.600 --> 02:39.000
even a completely neutrally presented cartoon of a fictional woman

02:39.000 --> 02:42.600
in a meaningless context, on a can of pasta even,

02:42.600 --> 02:46.600
is apparently malicious, feminist virtue signaling now.

02:46.600 --> 02:50.400
As if the mere fact that Supergirl or Wonder Woman exist at all

02:50.400 --> 02:52.200
is somehow a problem.

02:52.200 --> 02:56.800
So anyway, after seeing Stefan's take on a can of pasta with Wonder Woman on it,

02:56.800 --> 02:59.800
how could I not be excited for his video review

02:59.800 --> 03:02.800
of the Wonder Woman movie that came out this year?

03:02.800 --> 03:07.800
Um, we know how much Stefan likes seeing women fight against men in movies,

03:07.800 --> 03:12.200
and this movie has the all-female warrior race, the Amazons, in it,

03:12.200 --> 03:14.200
so you know we're in for a good time.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.600
So, let's get to it.

03:15.600 --> 03:18.600
And we're gonna go about this semi-chronologically here.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.200
We'll work through Stefan's video from start to finish,

03:21.200 --> 03:23.200
with some skipping around as needed.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.800
Um, and it should go without saying here,

03:25.800 --> 03:28.400
there will be spoilers from this point on, so...

03:28.400 --> 03:29.400
beware.

03:29.400 --> 03:30.400
And let's begin.

03:31.400 --> 03:35.200
So the artistry, charm and special effects, and one powerful twist

03:35.200 --> 03:39.800
are the only things that rescue Wonder Woman from its own stultifying clichés.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.400
First of all, I give you...

03:41.400 --> 03:43.000
the clichés.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.200
One.

03:44.200 --> 03:47.600
A female-run society is a paradise.

03:47.600 --> 03:50.000
Now, there's a very good reason for this.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.400
You see, the island the Amazons live on is a paradise.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.200
A literal, God-given paradise.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.200
With his dying breath,

03:59.200 --> 04:04.200
Zeus created this island to hide us from the outside world,

04:04.200 --> 04:06.600
somewhere Ares could not find us.

04:08.600 --> 04:12.800
We give thanks to the gods for giving us this paradise.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.200
It's not a paradise because women live on it,

04:16.200 --> 04:18.400
it's a paradise because Zeus,

04:18.400 --> 04:20.200
a male god, by the way,

04:20.200 --> 04:22.600
created it to be that way.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.600
During the first scenes on the island of...

04:26.800 --> 04:31.000
Well, let's just say it somewhat reminds me of the Greek island of Lesbos,

04:31.000 --> 04:35.200
the skies are blue, the waterfalls seem to spill diamonds, and...

04:35.200 --> 04:37.600
no woman seems to age much past 45.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.800
Haha, the Amazons are gay.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.400
Anyway, this is the first point in the video

04:44.400 --> 04:48.200
that Stefan is confused about the fact that the Amazons don't age,

04:48.200 --> 04:50.400
and he further expands on that point.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.800
Now, of course, there are no old women on this island

04:53.800 --> 04:55.600
because that would beg the question,

04:55.600 --> 04:57.400
where are all these women coming from?

04:57.400 --> 05:01.400
Is there a gimp in a leather suit in a box used for sperm harvesting?

05:01.400 --> 05:03.000
Are male babies killed off?

05:03.600 --> 05:05.800
So, where are the old Amazons?

05:05.800 --> 05:09.200
And without men, how are the Amazons being born?

05:09.200 --> 05:12.200
Well, near the start of the movie, Diana's mother,

05:12.200 --> 05:13.800
the queen of the Amazons,

05:13.800 --> 05:16.600
explains all this to Diana as a child.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.200
The Amazons were created by Zeus,

05:19.200 --> 05:22.800
and we see them emerging from the sea as fully grown women.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.000
And Diana's mother in this flashback

05:25.000 --> 05:28.600
appears to be the exact same age as she is when she's reading the story,

05:28.600 --> 05:32.800
so the Amazons aren't born, they were created by a god,

05:32.800 --> 05:34.800
and they don't appear to age,

05:34.800 --> 05:37.800
which explains both why there aren't any old Amazons,

05:37.800 --> 05:40.400
and why they don't need any men on the island.

05:40.600 --> 05:45.400
And if the literal picture book explained to a child method of exposition

05:45.400 --> 05:47.800
was a bit too complicated for Stefan,

05:47.800 --> 05:51.200
there are other clues cleverly hidden in the narrative.

05:51.600 --> 05:56.400
For example, Diana ages from a child to a fully grown woman

05:56.400 --> 05:59.600
without any other character on the island aging a day.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.200
Isn't that odd?

06:01.200 --> 06:05.600
Now, Diana ages, I presume, because she's not an Amazon.

06:05.600 --> 06:09.800
Exactly, she was created differently from the rest of them as a child.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.000
But even she ages very slowly.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.800
And the big tip-off here is that the movie opens in the present day,

06:16.800 --> 06:20.400
but the bulk of it is a flashback set in the First World War,

06:20.400 --> 06:24.000
and Wonder Woman looks exactly the same in both times.

06:24.200 --> 06:27.000
Didn't Stefan wonder why this was?

06:27.600 --> 06:30.200
Did he not notice that that was unusual?

06:30.600 --> 06:31.400
I don't know.

06:32.200 --> 06:36.400
And these Amazons take the only man on the island and interrogate him.

06:36.800 --> 06:40.800
When, logically, of course, they should be burying him in affirmative action programs.

06:42.200 --> 06:43.800
Now, this is a minor point here,

06:43.800 --> 06:48.000
but the Amazons interrogate him because he's dressed in the same uniform

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
as the soldiers who attacked them.

06:50.400 --> 06:51.800
Because he's a spy.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.000
You.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.400
No, Mother, no!

06:56.400 --> 06:58.000
You fought at my side against these babies.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.400
What man fights against his own people?

07:00.400 --> 07:01.200
These aren't my people.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.200
And why do you wear their colors?

07:04.200 --> 07:06.200
I can't tell you that.

07:06.200 --> 07:09.200
So they interrogate him to find out why that is.

07:09.200 --> 07:12.200
You know, they're not just doing it arbitrarily,

07:12.200 --> 07:15.200
but, like I say, that's a minor point.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.200
Cliche number two.

07:17.200 --> 07:20.200
Women are great warriors.

07:20.200 --> 07:23.200
Now, I've criticized female fighters in movies before

07:23.200 --> 07:26.200
for taking on men three times their size with little or no prior training.

07:26.200 --> 07:30.200
In this movie, Wonder Woman, whose actual name is Diana,

07:30.200 --> 07:33.200
does go through years of rigorous training,

07:33.200 --> 07:37.200
but gains supernatural powers somehow when she hits her late teens.

07:37.200 --> 07:41.200
She magically throws back her trainer half the length of a football field

07:41.200 --> 07:44.200
by blocking a sword blow with her golden bracers.

07:44.200 --> 07:47.200
This new power has two primary meanings.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.200
The first is the pushback of an abused child

07:50.200 --> 07:53.200
who has grown bigger and stronger than her aging abuser.

07:53.200 --> 07:56.200
The second is the displacement of an older woman's physical attractiveness

07:56.200 --> 07:58.200
by a younger woman.

07:58.200 --> 08:00.200
So there's a lot to unpack here.

08:00.200 --> 08:05.200
First off, Wonder Woman's size doesn't matter.

08:05.200 --> 08:08.200
She's a demigod with supernatural powers.

08:08.200 --> 08:10.200
She can hold a tank over her head.

08:10.200 --> 08:13.200
You know, the amount of training she does is,

08:13.200 --> 08:17.200
with regards to fighting against human men, anyway,

08:17.200 --> 08:19.200
completely inconsequential.

08:19.200 --> 08:23.200
She's training to fight against Ares, the god of war.

08:23.200 --> 08:26.200
She could crush a human man's head like a grape

08:26.200 --> 08:30.200
even if she hadn't trained a day in her life because she's not human.

08:30.200 --> 08:35.200
Secondly, Stefan's two primary readings of the meaning of this scene are very telling.

08:35.200 --> 08:38.200
The pushback of an abused child

08:38.200 --> 08:43.200
and the displacement of an older woman's physical attractiveness by a younger woman.

08:43.200 --> 08:48.200
Now, okay, I'm generally rather accepting of unconventional takes on movies.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.200
I mean, I have to be.

08:50.200 --> 08:53.200
I'm pals with the prequel Defender himself.

08:54.200 --> 08:58.200
But I can't help but think Stefan is reaching a little too far here.

08:58.200 --> 09:01.200
Diana and her aunt appear to have a good relationship

09:01.200 --> 09:04.200
so I'm not sure the abuser angle flies, really.

09:04.200 --> 09:09.200
To me, this scene is just showing that Diana has some unexplained power

09:09.200 --> 09:12.200
that differentiates her from the rest of the Amazons.

09:12.200 --> 09:15.200
That seems to be the primary meaning of the scene

09:15.200 --> 09:17.200
and, as we'll see later in the video,

09:17.200 --> 09:20.200
it's a meaning that Stefan missed somehow.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.200
But we'll get back to that later.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.200
Cliche number three.

09:24.200 --> 09:27.200
The hot Amazon supermodel librarian.

09:27.200 --> 09:31.200
A beautiful woman who has no idea how attractive she is.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.200
The dream of beta males everywhere

09:33.200 --> 09:36.200
who've never listened to Stanley Kowalski from A Streetcar Named Desire

09:36.200 --> 09:40.200
who says this to an erotic woman fishing for compliments.

09:40.200 --> 09:44.200
I never met a dame yet that didn't know if she was good-looking or not without being told

09:44.200 --> 09:49.200
and there's some of them that give themselves credit for more than they've got.

09:49.200 --> 09:53.200
Trust me, the lead actress may be playing a naive, otherworldly warrior

09:53.200 --> 09:57.200
but in real life, she knows exactly how attractive she is.

09:57.200 --> 10:02.200
She was a model who married a man who sold a hotel for $26 million.

10:02.200 --> 10:05.200
Here's a hint. You're not going to take off her thick glasses,

10:05.200 --> 10:09.200
tell her she's beautiful, and have her fall in love with you.

10:09.200 --> 10:14.200
So for cliche number three, I have three points to make. Isn't that nice?

10:14.200 --> 10:19.200
The first is that Diana isn't human and has never interacted with human society

10:19.200 --> 10:24.200
and therefore doesn't have the same ideas about what is appropriate behavior

10:24.200 --> 10:27.200
or is attractive to the opposite sex.

10:27.200 --> 10:31.200
She's never even met a man before the events of the movie.

10:31.200 --> 10:35.200
Have you never met a man before? What about your father?

10:35.200 --> 10:37.200
I had no father.

10:37.200 --> 10:42.200
Secondly, it doesn't matter who the actor is, she's playing a character.

10:42.200 --> 10:48.200
We know she's rich and famous in real life but that isn't supposed to affect the narrative of the film.

10:48.200 --> 10:51.200
You know, does Stefan do this for other movies?

10:51.200 --> 10:56.200
Henry Cavill can't fly, he's just a regular human actor.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.200
This film doesn't make any sense.

10:58.200 --> 11:05.200
Thirdly, the idea that Diana is still very attractive, even if you cover her up and put glasses on her,

11:05.200 --> 11:08.200
is actually stated outright in the film.

11:08.200 --> 11:13.200
Yeah, really, Specs? Suddenly she's not the most beautiful woman you've ever seen.

11:13.200 --> 11:17.200
The film's point here, one that it makes a few too many times for me to be honest,

11:17.200 --> 11:22.200
is that yes, Diana is very attractive. Anyway...

11:22.200 --> 11:28.200
Cliche number four, the incomprehensibly jealous and angry villain.

11:28.200 --> 11:32.200
Now, the intergalactic badass in Wonder Woman is the god Ares,

11:32.200 --> 11:36.200
who becomes jealous of Zeus' favorite created toy, humanity.

11:37.200 --> 11:40.200
So this is basic sibling rivalry cliche 101.

11:40.200 --> 11:45.200
The eldest sibling resents the younger sibling for the attention paid by the parents to the new arrival,

11:45.200 --> 11:47.200
who has displaced him.

11:47.200 --> 11:52.200
I have two points to make here, and the first one is kind of a minor nitpicky one.

11:52.200 --> 11:55.200
Ares isn't an intergalactic villain.

11:55.200 --> 11:59.200
He doesn't travel to or from another galaxy at any point.

11:59.200 --> 12:05.200
And now I only bring this up because Stefan has previously misunderstood the word intergalactic.

12:05.200 --> 12:11.200
Now I think he thinks it means, like, phenomenal or grand or something.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.200
Anyway...

12:12.200 --> 12:20.200
Secondly here, Stefan says Ares, the god of war, being angry, is a cliche.

12:20.200 --> 12:24.200
And if Stefan has a problem with the conflict between Zeus and Ares,

12:24.200 --> 12:27.200
or Ares being violent and angry,

12:27.200 --> 12:30.200
or even the Amazonian warrior women,

12:30.200 --> 12:33.200
he really needs to take that up with the ancient Greeks.

12:33.200 --> 12:38.200
You know, this narrative isn't the result of some modern, malicious Hollywood machination.

12:38.200 --> 12:41.200
They're characters from Greek mythology.

12:41.200 --> 12:46.200
And I thought Stefan was all about the ancient Greeks and western civilization and everything.

12:46.200 --> 12:49.200
But I guess I must have been mistaken there.

12:50.200 --> 12:54.200
Diana, princess of blow-dried hair, shopping and not eating, sorry.

12:54.200 --> 12:55.200
Sorry, sorry.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.200
Wrong, Princess Diana.

12:56.200 --> 13:02.200
Diana, princess of thermosquita, possesses powers that make no sense at all.

13:02.200 --> 13:06.200
So, Ares, the god of war, kills her father Zeus.

13:06.200 --> 13:09.200
Now, Ares has been provoking fights among mankind for thousands of years.

13:09.200 --> 13:15.200
But Diana was molded of clay, and Zeus was supposed to have breathed life into her a few short years before the movie began.

13:16.200 --> 13:19.200
Diana is an Amazon, with superpowers.

13:19.200 --> 13:23.200
But the Amazons are mere mortals, felled by a single bullet.

13:23.200 --> 13:27.200
So first off, there was a conflict between Zeus and Ares,

13:27.200 --> 13:31.200
during which Ares was injured and went into hiding.

13:31.200 --> 13:37.200
Now, Zeus was also injured and used the last of his strength to create the island paradise for the Amazons to live on.

13:37.200 --> 13:41.200
Now then, given that Diana ages incredibly slowly,

13:41.200 --> 13:48.200
as shown by her appearing the same age over a period of 100 years from the First World War to the modern day,

13:48.200 --> 13:53.200
Diana's childhood could have lasted hundreds or even thousands of years.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.200
Who knows?

13:54.200 --> 13:58.200
You know, Stefan saw a child age into a woman and thought,

13:58.200 --> 14:01.200
Oh, that probably took about 25 years.

14:01.200 --> 14:05.200
But no, she's a demigod living on a supernatural island.

14:05.200 --> 14:08.200
She doesn't age like regular humans.

14:08.200 --> 14:11.200
Secondly, Diana isn't an Amazon.

14:11.200 --> 14:16.200
And that's what the scene of her discovering her unique powers was supposed to represent.

14:16.200 --> 14:20.200
But if you missed that, Stefan, there also was this line of dialogue.

14:20.200 --> 14:23.200
As Amazons, this is our duty.

14:23.200 --> 14:26.200
But you are not an Amazon like the rest of us.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.200
So you will do nothing.

14:28.200 --> 14:33.200
And movies must be very confusing indeed if you just ignore half of what happens in them.

14:33.200 --> 14:36.200
Anyway, let's move on.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.200
Now, Chris Pine.

14:38.200 --> 14:43.200
Chris Pine is, in fact, a charming pile of J. Crew waspy hotness

14:43.200 --> 14:47.200
and helps carry the movie with his one-liners that shouldn't be one-liners.

14:47.200 --> 14:52.200
Now, as the audience, you become attached to him and then, of course, he has to die

14:52.200 --> 14:58.200
so that the population of the world always gets used to male disposability.

14:58.200 --> 15:01.200
And even the way he dies makes no sense.

15:01.200 --> 15:08.200
He's piloting a plane full of poison gas, which he chooses to blow up rather than, say, land safely.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.200
Because why?

15:10.200 --> 15:14.200
Landing the plane safely would allow the poison gas to be deactivated.

15:14.200 --> 15:19.200
Blowing it up in mid-air will just spread the poison gas for hundreds of miles, causing countless deaths.

15:19.200 --> 15:24.200
The prevention of which was the whole point and beguffin of the movie to begin with.

15:24.200 --> 15:31.200
But you see, men must always be expendable, so plot and logic must be expendable as well.

15:31.200 --> 15:36.200
So then, Chris Pine's sacrifice in order to blow up the poison gas plane.

15:36.200 --> 15:41.200
Stefan doesn't understand why the plane can't just be landed safely,

15:41.200 --> 15:44.200
but the movie does attempt to explain this.

15:44.200 --> 15:48.200
If we can get on the radio, we can ask Flankor to shoot her down.

15:48.200 --> 15:53.200
No, if it crashes, it'll wipe everyone out for 50 square miles. We gotta ground it.

15:53.200 --> 15:57.200
Bad news. It's on a timer. If we ground it here, it's the same thing.

15:57.200 --> 16:04.200
Stefan also doesn't understand why they have to blow the plane up, but the movie explains this as well.

16:04.200 --> 16:07.200
Is it flammable, Chief?

16:07.200 --> 16:10.200
Yes, you said it's hydrogen? It's flammable.

16:10.200 --> 16:17.200
So the gas is going to be released on a timer and will disperse over a large area, killing everyone around.

16:17.200 --> 16:22.200
But it is flammable, so if they explode the plane, the gas will burn up.

16:22.200 --> 16:26.200
So Chris Pine flies the plane to a safe distance and then does just that.

16:26.200 --> 16:33.200
Is it convoluted movie logic? A little bit, sure, but it does explain itself and it shouldn't be hard to follow.

16:33.200 --> 16:41.200
And furthermore, the selfless sacrifice of a man also serves an important narrative purpose that is missed by Stefan,

16:41.200 --> 16:43.200
and let's take a look at that.

16:43.200 --> 16:47.200
And if you think I'm kidding about male disposability, think of this.

16:47.200 --> 16:51.200
Remember the evil woman Dr. Poison who concocts the genocidal gas?

16:51.200 --> 16:55.200
Remember how Wonder Woman spares her life?

16:55.200 --> 16:59.200
She gets to live, the good guy doesn't.

16:59.200 --> 17:06.200
So then, Diana spares the life of the evil Dr. Poison, and this proves male disposability, apparently.

17:06.200 --> 17:13.200
But I feel like Stefan may have missed the point of this scene, if you couldn't believe such a thing.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.200
You see, Ares is using her to say to Diana,

17:16.200 --> 17:22.200
Look, humans are rubbish. They're evil. They make weapons to kill each other with.

17:22.200 --> 17:26.200
Let's team up and we'll go and get them.

17:26.200 --> 17:33.200
And in response to this, Diana remembers Chris Pine and how nice he was, blowing himself up to save everyone.

17:33.200 --> 17:34.200
And she says,

17:34.200 --> 17:44.200
You see, the woman's actions are being used as the proof that mankind is evil.

17:44.200 --> 17:50.200
And the man's noble sacrifice is being used as the counterargument that mankind is good.

17:50.200 --> 17:54.200
And, of course, Diana spares the life of an unarmed opponent.

17:54.200 --> 17:58.200
I mean, what's she gonna do? Just squish her with the tank or something?

17:58.200 --> 18:02.200
You know, she's the hero at the climax of the movie.

18:02.200 --> 18:05.200
I mean, what were you expecting to happen?

18:05.200 --> 18:13.200
Actually, I'd kinda like that if Diana just dropped the tank on her completely unexpectedly.

18:13.200 --> 18:16.200
That'd be quite good.

18:16.200 --> 18:20.200
Now, as usual, almost all the on-screen deaths are male.

18:20.200 --> 18:25.200
Female deaths are inevitably deployed as a plot device to heighten the stakes to raise attention.

18:25.200 --> 18:31.200
Men die anonymously in quick succession. Women die slowly or off-screen.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.200
Huh.

18:32.200 --> 18:39.200
Using sympathy for women to provoke male aggression does not seem very feminist to me.

18:39.200 --> 18:43.200
Ah, well, maybe it is. Hard to tell these days.

18:43.200 --> 18:49.200
Now, I'm afraid this is one of those times that Stefan is correct only if we ignore the times where he's wrong.

18:49.200 --> 18:57.200
For example, the battle at the start of the movie in which many Amazons are killed by German soldiers in quick succession.

18:57.200 --> 19:02.200
But if we ignore this bit, though, Stefan makes an excellent point.

19:02.200 --> 19:11.200
So, all men are evil or incompetent, except for non-white males, of course, with the exception of one, the Chris Pine character, who must die.

19:11.200 --> 19:18.200
Now, all women are wonderful and good, except for one, Dr. Poison, who gets to live.

19:18.200 --> 19:25.200
Now, these few sentences are a real masterpiece of appearing to have an argument when, in fact, you don't really.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.200
And let's think about this for a bit.

19:27.200 --> 19:38.200
All men are presented as evil or incompetent, except for non-white males, of course, with the exception of one, Chris Pine, who has to die.

19:38.200 --> 19:43.200
Now, built into Stefan's all men statement, there are two exceptions.

19:43.200 --> 19:49.200
All men are presented as evil only if we first discount the various presentations of men as not evil.

19:49.200 --> 19:53.200
And if we do that, wow, point made, you know.

19:53.200 --> 19:57.200
However, even with Stefan's caveats there, it's not true.

19:57.200 --> 20:03.200
For example, all these white soldiers rushing across No Man's Land are presented pretty heroically,

20:03.200 --> 20:09.200
and these liberated villagers seem like they're having a good time and they don't look evil or incompetent.

20:09.200 --> 20:16.200
And there's also Charlie, who's generally a good guy, but I guess he falls under Stefan's classification of incompetent

20:16.200 --> 20:23.200
because he doesn't want to fight anymore due to having PTSD, which, you know, would be a bit cruel and thoughtless.

20:23.200 --> 20:30.200
But anyway, ultimately, the fairly uncomplicated message of the movie is that mankind can be good.

20:30.200 --> 20:36.200
Stefan misses this because he's viewing the movie only along the racial and sexual lines that he's imposing.

20:36.200 --> 20:41.200
You know, it's not enough that the principal male character is a heroic white man.

20:41.200 --> 20:49.200
You know, not all the male characters are heroic white men, and as such, the movie is clearly anti-male, anti-white propaganda.

20:50.200 --> 20:56.200
And what is the role of women in raising such nasty and violent men?

20:56.200 --> 21:02.200
Completely absent from the film, of course. Men are just bad.

21:02.200 --> 21:09.200
The women who raise them are just saints. For feminists and leftists, environment is everything.

21:09.200 --> 21:14.200
You know, you are a criminal because you were raised poor in a poor neighborhood, except for men.

21:14.200 --> 21:21.200
Well, they're just bad regardless of environment, regardless of the mothers and female daycare workers and female primary school teachers who raise them.

21:21.200 --> 21:29.200
Regardless of the welfare state policies that women vote for, environment creates badness, except for boys raised by women.

21:29.200 --> 21:35.200
Then, the badness of boys has absolutely nothing to do with women at all.

21:36.200 --> 21:42.200
Well, again, the point of the movie is actually not that men are naturally just bad.

21:43.200 --> 21:58.200
But regardless, does Stefan really want the movie to go into how the evil General Ludendorff, say, actually would have been a really nice guy but for the malicious actions of his abusive mother who raised him poorly?

21:58.200 --> 22:01.200
Like, what on earth is that?

22:01.200 --> 22:06.200
You know, we all remember this classic clip of Stefan I used in another video.

22:06.200 --> 22:15.200
All the cold-hearted jerks who run the world came out of the vaginas of women who married assholes.

22:15.200 --> 22:22.200
And I don't know how to make the world a better place without holding women accountable for choosing assholes!

22:22.200 --> 22:28.200
All the evil men in the world came out of evil women's evil vaginas.

22:28.200 --> 22:37.200
Now, it appears Stefan has convinced himself pretty well of this convoluted delusion because it seems he's now actually expecting to see it represented in reality.

22:37.200 --> 22:41.200
And it's an interesting approach to art criticism, I guess.

22:41.200 --> 22:50.200
Convince yourself of something truly mad, and then when you don't see any evidence of it, that proves the existence of the insidious conspiracy to cover it up.

22:50.200 --> 22:58.200
So to any Stefan Molyneux fans watching this video, the reason that the movie doesn't go into the backstories of the violent German soldiers

22:58.200 --> 23:05.200
and explore their abuse at the hands of their neglectful mothers who only went out with assholes and ignored all the nice guys

23:05.200 --> 23:09.200
is because it would be really, really weird.

23:09.200 --> 23:11.200
Anyway, that's about it for me today.

23:11.200 --> 23:17.200
Kind of a lighter one this time, but the other video I'm working on right now is about police shootings,

23:17.200 --> 23:20.200
so I needed the levity, to be honest.

23:20.200 --> 23:25.200
And I certainly had fun watching Stefan try to cram his ideology into the movie however he could.

23:25.200 --> 23:33.200
I might come back to this again and check out the many, many other movies that Stefan tells us the truth about.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.200
I hope you could hear the air quotes there.

23:35.200 --> 23:39.200
Let me know what you think about that idea in the comments.

23:39.200 --> 23:45.200
Also, consider supporting me on Patreon if you like, like all these lovely people right here.

23:45.200 --> 23:49.200
I don't run ads on my videos and I'd like to keep it that way.

23:49.200 --> 23:54.200
Also, follow me on Twitter or send me a curious cat question if you like.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.200
I really like questions.

23:56.200 --> 23:59.200
Okay folks, I'll see you next time.

23:59.200 --> 24:03.200
I actually waved goodbye at my microphone then.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.200
See ya.
