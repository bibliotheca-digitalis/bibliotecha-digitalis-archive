0	1520	Hello, everyone.
1520	4120	So, I have a little confession to make.
4120	10360	I had an idea for a video while looking at Stefan Molyneux's The Truth About X series.
10360	14200	In particular, his videos about popular contemporary movies.
14200	19120	Now, my idea was to watch all of those videos and make a sort of rapid-fire,
19120	22200	reverse, Cinemasins-style debunking video,
22200	25200	where I point out all the time Stefan screwed up,
25200	27200	or misremembered something,
27200	29600	or misrepresented what was in the movie.
29600	30600	And so on.
30600	33800	So, I sat down with my notebook and put the first one on.
33800	36200	The Truth About Wonder Woman.
36200	38400	Now, as I watched this video,
38400	43000	I very quickly realized that my original idea was not gonna pan out.
43000	48000	You see, Stefan gets so many things wrong about just this one particular movie
48000	51600	that any response seeking to address all of his movie videos
51600	54000	would probably be several hours long.
54000	56600	So, I had to abandon my original plan
56600	60200	and just concern myself with the truth about Wonder Woman today.
60200	61600	I'm very sorry.
61600	64600	And now, the reason I started out by watching that video
64600	69600	is because I was honestly looking forward to Stefan's take on the Wonder Woman movie.
69600	71600	And that's because, back in April,
71600	74200	Stefan posted this tweet.
74200	76600	Pasta in tomato sauce.
76600	80000	Now with feminist virtue signaling.
80000	83800	And there's a photograph of a can of pasta in tomato sauce
83800	86200	with some female superheroes on it.
86400	88600	Wonder Woman included.
88600	92000	And I like this tweet a lot for a few reasons,
92000	94000	and let me briefly run them by you.
94000	99200	Firstly, I like the idea that a can of pasta is apparently feminist
99200	102400	because it has a picture of a cartoon lady on it.
102400	106200	Likewise, this is apparently virtue signaling,
106200	109200	although as to what virtues are being signaled here,
109200	110200	who knows?
110200	113600	The can just has a picture of Supergirl on it, that's it.
113600	118400	Unless no artificial flavors or preservatives is virtue signaling now.
118400	120200	I'm at a loss there.
120200	124400	The next thing I like about this tweet is that Stefan appears to have purchased
124400	126600	the can of pasta in tomato sauce
126600	128600	in order to complain about it.
128600	131600	Which would be funny enough by itself, to be honest,
131600	134200	but as people were quick to point out to Stefan,
134200	138000	the cans also had versions with male superheroes on,
138000	140600	such as Superman and Batman.
141200	144600	Apparently the existence of male superheroes on cans of pasta
144600	148000	doesn't qualify as virtue signaling for whatever reason.
148000	152600	This is Molyneux's projecting problem that I've spoken about in a previous video.
152600	154600	Any depiction of a woman,
154600	159000	even a completely neutrally presented cartoon of a fictional woman
159000	162600	in a meaningless context, on a can of pasta even,
162600	166600	is apparently malicious, feminist virtue signaling now.
166600	170400	As if the mere fact that Supergirl or Wonder Woman exist at all
170400	172200	is somehow a problem.
172200	176800	So anyway, after seeing Stefan's take on a can of pasta with Wonder Woman on it,
176800	179800	how could I not be excited for his video review
179800	182800	of the Wonder Woman movie that came out this year?
182800	187800	Um, we know how much Stefan likes seeing women fight against men in movies,
187800	192200	and this movie has the all-female warrior race, the Amazons, in it,
192200	194200	so you know we're in for a good time.
194200	195600	So, let's get to it.
195600	198600	And we're gonna go about this semi-chronologically here.
198600	201200	We'll work through Stefan's video from start to finish,
201200	203200	with some skipping around as needed.
203200	205800	Um, and it should go without saying here,
205800	208400	there will be spoilers from this point on, so...
208400	209400	beware.
209400	210400	And let's begin.
211400	215200	So the artistry, charm and special effects, and one powerful twist
215200	219800	are the only things that rescue Wonder Woman from its own stultifying clichés.
219800	221400	First of all, I give you...
221400	223000	the clichés.
223000	224200	One.
224200	227600	A female-run society is a paradise.
227600	230000	Now, there's a very good reason for this.
230000	234400	You see, the island the Amazons live on is a paradise.
234400	237200	A literal, God-given paradise.
237600	239200	With his dying breath,
239200	244200	Zeus created this island to hide us from the outside world,
244200	246600	somewhere Ares could not find us.
248600	252800	We give thanks to the gods for giving us this paradise.
253600	256200	It's not a paradise because women live on it,
256200	258400	it's a paradise because Zeus,
258400	260200	a male god, by the way,
260200	262600	created it to be that way.
263400	265600	During the first scenes on the island of...
266800	271000	Well, let's just say it somewhat reminds me of the Greek island of Lesbos,
271000	275200	the skies are blue, the waterfalls seem to spill diamonds, and...
275200	277600	no woman seems to age much past 45.
278200	280800	Haha, the Amazons are gay.
281800	284400	Anyway, this is the first point in the video
284400	288200	that Stefan is confused about the fact that the Amazons don't age,
288200	290400	and he further expands on that point.
291000	293800	Now, of course, there are no old women on this island
293800	295600	because that would beg the question,
295600	297400	where are all these women coming from?
297400	301400	Is there a gimp in a leather suit in a box used for sperm harvesting?
301400	303000	Are male babies killed off?
303600	305800	So, where are the old Amazons?
305800	309200	And without men, how are the Amazons being born?
309200	312200	Well, near the start of the movie, Diana's mother,
312200	313800	the queen of the Amazons,
313800	316600	explains all this to Diana as a child.
317000	319200	The Amazons were created by Zeus,
319200	322800	and we see them emerging from the sea as fully grown women.
323200	325000	And Diana's mother in this flashback
325000	328600	appears to be the exact same age as she is when she's reading the story,
328600	332800	so the Amazons aren't born, they were created by a god,
332800	334800	and they don't appear to age,
334800	337800	which explains both why there aren't any old Amazons,
337800	340400	and why they don't need any men on the island.
340600	345400	And if the literal picture book explained to a child method of exposition
345400	347800	was a bit too complicated for Stefan,
347800	351200	there are other clues cleverly hidden in the narrative.
351600	356400	For example, Diana ages from a child to a fully grown woman
356400	359600	without any other character on the island aging a day.
360000	361200	Isn't that odd?
361200	365600	Now, Diana ages, I presume, because she's not an Amazon.
365600	369800	Exactly, she was created differently from the rest of them as a child.
370200	373000	But even she ages very slowly.
373000	376800	And the big tip-off here is that the movie opens in the present day,
376800	380400	but the bulk of it is a flashback set in the First World War,
380400	384000	and Wonder Woman looks exactly the same in both times.
384200	387000	Didn't Stefan wonder why this was?
387600	390200	Did he not notice that that was unusual?
390600	391400	I don't know.
392200	396400	And these Amazons take the only man on the island and interrogate him.
396800	400800	When, logically, of course, they should be burying him in affirmative action programs.
402200	403800	Now, this is a minor point here,
403800	408000	but the Amazons interrogate him because he's dressed in the same uniform
408000	410000	as the soldiers who attacked them.
410400	411800	Because he's a spy.
412400	413000	You.
415200	416400	No, Mother, no!
416400	418000	You fought at my side against these babies.
418000	420400	What man fights against his own people?
420400	421200	These aren't my people.
421200	423200	And why do you wear their colors?
424200	426200	I can't tell you that.
426200	429200	So they interrogate him to find out why that is.
429200	432200	You know, they're not just doing it arbitrarily,
432200	435200	but, like I say, that's a minor point.
436200	437200	Cliche number two.
437200	440200	Women are great warriors.
440200	443200	Now, I've criticized female fighters in movies before
443200	446200	for taking on men three times their size with little or no prior training.
446200	450200	In this movie, Wonder Woman, whose actual name is Diana,
450200	453200	does go through years of rigorous training,
453200	457200	but gains supernatural powers somehow when she hits her late teens.
457200	461200	She magically throws back her trainer half the length of a football field
461200	464200	by blocking a sword blow with her golden bracers.
464200	467200	This new power has two primary meanings.
467200	470200	The first is the pushback of an abused child
470200	473200	who has grown bigger and stronger than her aging abuser.
473200	476200	The second is the displacement of an older woman's physical attractiveness
476200	478200	by a younger woman.
478200	480200	So there's a lot to unpack here.
480200	485200	First off, Wonder Woman's size doesn't matter.
485200	488200	She's a demigod with supernatural powers.
488200	490200	She can hold a tank over her head.
490200	493200	You know, the amount of training she does is,
493200	497200	with regards to fighting against human men, anyway,
497200	499200	completely inconsequential.
499200	503200	She's training to fight against Ares, the god of war.
503200	506200	She could crush a human man's head like a grape
506200	510200	even if she hadn't trained a day in her life because she's not human.
510200	515200	Secondly, Stefan's two primary readings of the meaning of this scene are very telling.
515200	518200	The pushback of an abused child
518200	523200	and the displacement of an older woman's physical attractiveness by a younger woman.
523200	528200	Now, okay, I'm generally rather accepting of unconventional takes on movies.
528200	530200	I mean, I have to be.
530200	533200	I'm pals with the prequel Defender himself.
534200	538200	But I can't help but think Stefan is reaching a little too far here.
538200	541200	Diana and her aunt appear to have a good relationship
541200	544200	so I'm not sure the abuser angle flies, really.
544200	549200	To me, this scene is just showing that Diana has some unexplained power
549200	552200	that differentiates her from the rest of the Amazons.
552200	555200	That seems to be the primary meaning of the scene
555200	557200	and, as we'll see later in the video,
557200	560200	it's a meaning that Stefan missed somehow.
560200	562200	But we'll get back to that later.
562200	564200	Cliche number three.
564200	567200	The hot Amazon supermodel librarian.
567200	571200	A beautiful woman who has no idea how attractive she is.
571200	573200	The dream of beta males everywhere
573200	576200	who've never listened to Stanley Kowalski from A Streetcar Named Desire
576200	580200	who says this to an erotic woman fishing for compliments.
580200	584200	I never met a dame yet that didn't know if she was good-looking or not without being told
584200	589200	and there's some of them that give themselves credit for more than they've got.
589200	593200	Trust me, the lead actress may be playing a naive, otherworldly warrior
593200	597200	but in real life, she knows exactly how attractive she is.
597200	602200	She was a model who married a man who sold a hotel for $26 million.
602200	605200	Here's a hint. You're not going to take off her thick glasses,
605200	609200	tell her she's beautiful, and have her fall in love with you.
609200	614200	So for cliche number three, I have three points to make. Isn't that nice?
614200	619200	The first is that Diana isn't human and has never interacted with human society
619200	624200	and therefore doesn't have the same ideas about what is appropriate behavior
624200	627200	or is attractive to the opposite sex.
627200	631200	She's never even met a man before the events of the movie.
631200	635200	Have you never met a man before? What about your father?
635200	637200	I had no father.
637200	642200	Secondly, it doesn't matter who the actor is, she's playing a character.
642200	648200	We know she's rich and famous in real life but that isn't supposed to affect the narrative of the film.
648200	651200	You know, does Stefan do this for other movies?
651200	656200	Henry Cavill can't fly, he's just a regular human actor.
656200	658200	This film doesn't make any sense.
658200	665200	Thirdly, the idea that Diana is still very attractive, even if you cover her up and put glasses on her,
665200	668200	is actually stated outright in the film.
668200	673200	Yeah, really, Specs? Suddenly she's not the most beautiful woman you've ever seen.
673200	677200	The film's point here, one that it makes a few too many times for me to be honest,
677200	682200	is that yes, Diana is very attractive. Anyway...
682200	688200	Cliche number four, the incomprehensibly jealous and angry villain.
688200	692200	Now, the intergalactic badass in Wonder Woman is the god Ares,
692200	696200	who becomes jealous of Zeus' favorite created toy, humanity.
697200	700200	So this is basic sibling rivalry cliche 101.
700200	705200	The eldest sibling resents the younger sibling for the attention paid by the parents to the new arrival,
705200	707200	who has displaced him.
707200	712200	I have two points to make here, and the first one is kind of a minor nitpicky one.
712200	715200	Ares isn't an intergalactic villain.
715200	719200	He doesn't travel to or from another galaxy at any point.
719200	725200	And now I only bring this up because Stefan has previously misunderstood the word intergalactic.
725200	731200	Now I think he thinks it means, like, phenomenal or grand or something.
731200	732200	Anyway...
732200	740200	Secondly here, Stefan says Ares, the god of war, being angry, is a cliche.
740200	744200	And if Stefan has a problem with the conflict between Zeus and Ares,
744200	747200	or Ares being violent and angry,
747200	750200	or even the Amazonian warrior women,
750200	753200	he really needs to take that up with the ancient Greeks.
753200	758200	You know, this narrative isn't the result of some modern, malicious Hollywood machination.
758200	761200	They're characters from Greek mythology.
761200	766200	And I thought Stefan was all about the ancient Greeks and western civilization and everything.
766200	769200	But I guess I must have been mistaken there.
770200	774200	Diana, princess of blow-dried hair, shopping and not eating, sorry.
774200	775200	Sorry, sorry.
775200	776200	Wrong, Princess Diana.
776200	782200	Diana, princess of thermosquita, possesses powers that make no sense at all.
782200	786200	So, Ares, the god of war, kills her father Zeus.
786200	789200	Now, Ares has been provoking fights among mankind for thousands of years.
789200	795200	But Diana was molded of clay, and Zeus was supposed to have breathed life into her a few short years before the movie began.
796200	799200	Diana is an Amazon, with superpowers.
799200	803200	But the Amazons are mere mortals, felled by a single bullet.
803200	807200	So first off, there was a conflict between Zeus and Ares,
807200	811200	during which Ares was injured and went into hiding.
811200	817200	Now, Zeus was also injured and used the last of his strength to create the island paradise for the Amazons to live on.
817200	821200	Now then, given that Diana ages incredibly slowly,
821200	828200	as shown by her appearing the same age over a period of 100 years from the First World War to the modern day,
828200	833200	Diana's childhood could have lasted hundreds or even thousands of years.
833200	834200	Who knows?
834200	838200	You know, Stefan saw a child age into a woman and thought,
838200	841200	Oh, that probably took about 25 years.
841200	845200	But no, she's a demigod living on a supernatural island.
845200	848200	She doesn't age like regular humans.
848200	851200	Secondly, Diana isn't an Amazon.
851200	856200	And that's what the scene of her discovering her unique powers was supposed to represent.
856200	860200	But if you missed that, Stefan, there also was this line of dialogue.
860200	863200	As Amazons, this is our duty.
863200	866200	But you are not an Amazon like the rest of us.
866200	868200	So you will do nothing.
868200	873200	And movies must be very confusing indeed if you just ignore half of what happens in them.
873200	876200	Anyway, let's move on.
876200	878200	Now, Chris Pine.
878200	883200	Chris Pine is, in fact, a charming pile of J. Crew waspy hotness
883200	887200	and helps carry the movie with his one-liners that shouldn't be one-liners.
887200	892200	Now, as the audience, you become attached to him and then, of course, he has to die
892200	898200	so that the population of the world always gets used to male disposability.
898200	901200	And even the way he dies makes no sense.
901200	908200	He's piloting a plane full of poison gas, which he chooses to blow up rather than, say, land safely.
908200	910200	Because why?
910200	914200	Landing the plane safely would allow the poison gas to be deactivated.
914200	919200	Blowing it up in mid-air will just spread the poison gas for hundreds of miles, causing countless deaths.
919200	924200	The prevention of which was the whole point and beguffin of the movie to begin with.
924200	931200	But you see, men must always be expendable, so plot and logic must be expendable as well.
931200	936200	So then, Chris Pine's sacrifice in order to blow up the poison gas plane.
936200	941200	Stefan doesn't understand why the plane can't just be landed safely,
941200	944200	but the movie does attempt to explain this.
944200	948200	If we can get on the radio, we can ask Flankor to shoot her down.
948200	953200	No, if it crashes, it'll wipe everyone out for 50 square miles. We gotta ground it.
953200	957200	Bad news. It's on a timer. If we ground it here, it's the same thing.
957200	964200	Stefan also doesn't understand why they have to blow the plane up, but the movie explains this as well.
964200	967200	Is it flammable, Chief?
967200	970200	Yes, you said it's hydrogen? It's flammable.
970200	977200	So the gas is going to be released on a timer and will disperse over a large area, killing everyone around.
977200	982200	But it is flammable, so if they explode the plane, the gas will burn up.
982200	986200	So Chris Pine flies the plane to a safe distance and then does just that.
986200	993200	Is it convoluted movie logic? A little bit, sure, but it does explain itself and it shouldn't be hard to follow.
993200	1001200	And furthermore, the selfless sacrifice of a man also serves an important narrative purpose that is missed by Stefan,
1001200	1003200	and let's take a look at that.
1003200	1007200	And if you think I'm kidding about male disposability, think of this.
1007200	1011200	Remember the evil woman Dr. Poison who concocts the genocidal gas?
1011200	1015200	Remember how Wonder Woman spares her life?
1015200	1019200	She gets to live, the good guy doesn't.
1019200	1026200	So then, Diana spares the life of the evil Dr. Poison, and this proves male disposability, apparently.
1026200	1033200	But I feel like Stefan may have missed the point of this scene, if you couldn't believe such a thing.
1033200	1036200	You see, Ares is using her to say to Diana,
1036200	1042200	Look, humans are rubbish. They're evil. They make weapons to kill each other with.
1042200	1046200	Let's team up and we'll go and get them.
1046200	1053200	And in response to this, Diana remembers Chris Pine and how nice he was, blowing himself up to save everyone.
1053200	1054200	And she says,
1054200	1064200	You see, the woman's actions are being used as the proof that mankind is evil.
1064200	1070200	And the man's noble sacrifice is being used as the counterargument that mankind is good.
1070200	1074200	And, of course, Diana spares the life of an unarmed opponent.
1074200	1078200	I mean, what's she gonna do? Just squish her with the tank or something?
1078200	1082200	You know, she's the hero at the climax of the movie.
1082200	1085200	I mean, what were you expecting to happen?
1085200	1093200	Actually, I'd kinda like that if Diana just dropped the tank on her completely unexpectedly.
1093200	1096200	That'd be quite good.
1096200	1100200	Now, as usual, almost all the on-screen deaths are male.
1100200	1105200	Female deaths are inevitably deployed as a plot device to heighten the stakes to raise attention.
1105200	1111200	Men die anonymously in quick succession. Women die slowly or off-screen.
1111200	1112200	Huh.
1112200	1119200	Using sympathy for women to provoke male aggression does not seem very feminist to me.
1119200	1123200	Ah, well, maybe it is. Hard to tell these days.
1123200	1129200	Now, I'm afraid this is one of those times that Stefan is correct only if we ignore the times where he's wrong.
1129200	1137200	For example, the battle at the start of the movie in which many Amazons are killed by German soldiers in quick succession.
1137200	1142200	But if we ignore this bit, though, Stefan makes an excellent point.
1142200	1151200	So, all men are evil or incompetent, except for non-white males, of course, with the exception of one, the Chris Pine character, who must die.
1151200	1158200	Now, all women are wonderful and good, except for one, Dr. Poison, who gets to live.
1158200	1165200	Now, these few sentences are a real masterpiece of appearing to have an argument when, in fact, you don't really.
1165200	1167200	And let's think about this for a bit.
1167200	1178200	All men are presented as evil or incompetent, except for non-white males, of course, with the exception of one, Chris Pine, who has to die.
1178200	1183200	Now, built into Stefan's all men statement, there are two exceptions.
1183200	1189200	All men are presented as evil only if we first discount the various presentations of men as not evil.
1189200	1193200	And if we do that, wow, point made, you know.
1193200	1197200	However, even with Stefan's caveats there, it's not true.
1197200	1203200	For example, all these white soldiers rushing across No Man's Land are presented pretty heroically,
1203200	1209200	and these liberated villagers seem like they're having a good time and they don't look evil or incompetent.
1209200	1216200	And there's also Charlie, who's generally a good guy, but I guess he falls under Stefan's classification of incompetent
1216200	1223200	because he doesn't want to fight anymore due to having PTSD, which, you know, would be a bit cruel and thoughtless.
1223200	1230200	But anyway, ultimately, the fairly uncomplicated message of the movie is that mankind can be good.
1230200	1236200	Stefan misses this because he's viewing the movie only along the racial and sexual lines that he's imposing.
1236200	1241200	You know, it's not enough that the principal male character is a heroic white man.
1241200	1249200	You know, not all the male characters are heroic white men, and as such, the movie is clearly anti-male, anti-white propaganda.
1250200	1256200	And what is the role of women in raising such nasty and violent men?
1256200	1262200	Completely absent from the film, of course. Men are just bad.
1262200	1269200	The women who raise them are just saints. For feminists and leftists, environment is everything.
1269200	1274200	You know, you are a criminal because you were raised poor in a poor neighborhood, except for men.
1274200	1281200	Well, they're just bad regardless of environment, regardless of the mothers and female daycare workers and female primary school teachers who raise them.
1281200	1289200	Regardless of the welfare state policies that women vote for, environment creates badness, except for boys raised by women.
1289200	1295200	Then, the badness of boys has absolutely nothing to do with women at all.
1296200	1302200	Well, again, the point of the movie is actually not that men are naturally just bad.
1303200	1318200	But regardless, does Stefan really want the movie to go into how the evil General Ludendorff, say, actually would have been a really nice guy but for the malicious actions of his abusive mother who raised him poorly?
1318200	1321200	Like, what on earth is that?
1321200	1326200	You know, we all remember this classic clip of Stefan I used in another video.
1326200	1335200	All the cold-hearted jerks who run the world came out of the vaginas of women who married assholes.
1335200	1342200	And I don't know how to make the world a better place without holding women accountable for choosing assholes!
1342200	1348200	All the evil men in the world came out of evil women's evil vaginas.
1348200	1357200	Now, it appears Stefan has convinced himself pretty well of this convoluted delusion because it seems he's now actually expecting to see it represented in reality.
1357200	1361200	And it's an interesting approach to art criticism, I guess.
1361200	1370200	Convince yourself of something truly mad, and then when you don't see any evidence of it, that proves the existence of the insidious conspiracy to cover it up.
1370200	1378200	So to any Stefan Molyneux fans watching this video, the reason that the movie doesn't go into the backstories of the violent German soldiers
1378200	1385200	and explore their abuse at the hands of their neglectful mothers who only went out with assholes and ignored all the nice guys
1385200	1389200	is because it would be really, really weird.
1389200	1391200	Anyway, that's about it for me today.
1391200	1397200	Kind of a lighter one this time, but the other video I'm working on right now is about police shootings,
1397200	1400200	so I needed the levity, to be honest.
1400200	1405200	And I certainly had fun watching Stefan try to cram his ideology into the movie however he could.
1405200	1413200	I might come back to this again and check out the many, many other movies that Stefan tells us the truth about.
1413200	1415200	I hope you could hear the air quotes there.
1415200	1419200	Let me know what you think about that idea in the comments.
1419200	1425200	Also, consider supporting me on Patreon if you like, like all these lovely people right here.
1425200	1429200	I don't run ads on my videos and I'd like to keep it that way.
1429200	1434200	Also, follow me on Twitter or send me a curious cat question if you like.
1434200	1436200	I really like questions.
1436200	1439200	Okay folks, I'll see you next time.
1439200	1443200	I actually waved goodbye at my microphone then.
1443200	1445200	See ya.
