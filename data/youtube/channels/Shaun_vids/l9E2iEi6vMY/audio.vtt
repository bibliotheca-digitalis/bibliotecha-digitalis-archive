00:00.000 --> 00:01.260
Hello, everyone.

00:01.260 --> 00:08.680
So, when our pal Sargon of Akkad isn't harassing innocent women by photographing them and tweeting out where they live and work,

00:08.680 --> 00:12.240
he still finds time to make a YouTube video or two.

00:13.240 --> 00:15.100
How's that for an intro there?

00:15.100 --> 00:21.740
Uh, so today, I'm gonna be looking at one of Sargon's recent videos in his This Week in Stupid series,

00:21.740 --> 00:26.000
where he reads out some recent news items and then complains a lot.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.760
And Sargon recently tried something a little different with this series,

00:29.760 --> 00:37.560
instead of posting shorter, edited videos, he tried releasing a couple of longer, less scripted, off-the-cuff videos.

00:37.560 --> 00:42.500
Now, the danger with this approach is that you're more likely to make mistakes, you know,

00:42.500 --> 00:46.360
misquote something, misread something, take something out of context.

00:46.360 --> 00:53.460
And Sargon has since abandoned this style of video, saying that making that type of content made him feel lazy.

00:54.060 --> 00:57.460
Of course, the other danger here is that some handsome chap will come along

00:57.460 --> 01:01.860
and make a list of all the mistakes you made in order to have a bit of a laugh at you.

01:02.260 --> 01:04.560
Now, is that unfair?

01:04.860 --> 01:08.960
You know, Sargon posts an experimental, long-form, unscripted video,

01:08.960 --> 01:12.360
and then I go through it and nitpick it for mistakes.

01:12.660 --> 01:18.060
Well, maybe that's unfair, but I do think there's still some points to be made here.

01:18.060 --> 01:22.760
With Sargon specifically, I think it gives us a bit of a peek behind the curtain.

01:22.960 --> 01:28.360
And there are parts of this video where I'd argue Carl flirts with open white nationalism

01:28.360 --> 01:32.160
in a much more obvious way than I see him do in his more scripted videos.

01:32.660 --> 01:37.660
More generally, though, the particular ways in which Carl misreads articles and news stories

01:37.660 --> 01:42.160
is illustrative of how a lot of other people misread articles and news stories

01:42.160 --> 01:44.560
and end up coming to silly conclusions.

01:44.960 --> 01:49.560
There's a definite lack of basic journalistic understanding at play here.

01:50.060 --> 01:55.260
For all Carl and his, like, hate on universities for being social justice hugboxers,

01:55.260 --> 01:59.160
they really could do with going and taking a writing course sometime.

01:59.160 --> 02:03.360
So we're also gonna focus on Carl's method of reading these articles

02:03.360 --> 02:06.060
and how, in particular, he misreads.

02:06.360 --> 02:10.360
This is how I kid myself into doing these sorts of response videos.

02:10.360 --> 02:13.260
You know, I try and make it into some wider points

02:13.260 --> 02:16.860
so it's not just me laughing at a guy for being wrong.

02:17.660 --> 02:20.860
So I think what we'll do here is, before we get to Carl,

02:20.860 --> 02:25.260
pick out one of the stories that he reads and we'll briefly scan through it ourselves,

02:25.260 --> 02:29.260
have a little chat about it, and then we'll watch his take on it.

02:29.760 --> 02:35.160
Though I will say, if you're short on time and you just wanna see the worst thing that Carl said today

02:35.160 --> 02:37.560
and can't really be bothered with all of the reading,

02:37.560 --> 02:43.560
skip to the timecode currently on the screen to see Carl being so offensively wrong about something

02:43.560 --> 02:46.560
that it's actually legitimately concerning.

02:46.560 --> 02:52.560
Anyway, for everyone else, we'll start with this article from the news website QZ.com.

03:17.560 --> 03:20.160
So, what have we just read?

03:20.160 --> 03:25.860
Well, it's the headline and first few sentences of an article about how the digital personal assistants

03:25.860 --> 03:31.960
on smartphones and tablets and the likes handle talking about the topic of sexual abuse.

03:31.960 --> 03:37.660
And we can already see that the author of this article clearly thinks that they underperform in that regard.

03:37.660 --> 03:41.760
Now, the start of an article like this is meant to be attention-grabbing.

03:41.760 --> 03:47.160
You know, it's got the weird premise in the headline and then the punchy first two sentences.

03:47.160 --> 03:51.960
Women have been made into servants once again, except this time they're digital.

03:51.960 --> 03:58.160
It's good. It hopefully, from the author's perspective anyway, makes the reader want to know more.

03:58.160 --> 04:03.660
You know, asking questions like, what's the issue, why is it a problem, who's at fault,

04:03.660 --> 04:06.660
what can be done about it, things like that.

04:06.660 --> 04:12.460
And the article, if it's a good article anyway, will then go on to address all of these questions.

04:12.460 --> 04:16.960
And not to skip ahead here, but the reader, if they're a good reader,

04:16.960 --> 04:21.460
will actually read the article to see if it answers those questions.

04:21.460 --> 04:25.960
The article goes on to explain the issue, which is that these personal assistant programs

04:25.960 --> 04:33.160
aren't programmed particularly well to discuss sexual harassment, rape, sex education, and topics like that.

04:33.160 --> 04:37.860
And they reach out to the developers of these devices for quotes about their approach to the issue,

04:37.860 --> 04:42.460
and they test the devices to see how they respond to being insulted.

04:42.460 --> 04:47.260
And they come to the conclusion that the developers need to do better when they're programming

04:47.260 --> 04:51.060
how the bots respond to these things, ending with,

04:51.060 --> 04:56.260
rather than promoting stereotypical passivity, dismissiveness, and even flirtation with abuse,

04:56.260 --> 05:00.860
these companies could become industry leaders against sexual harassment.

05:00.860 --> 05:06.460
So, what do we think about this article? Well, I personally think it's well-written, it's easy to follow,

05:06.460 --> 05:09.360
it gets its point across well, it's well-researched.

05:09.360 --> 05:12.560
The premise, obviously, is a little silly.

05:12.560 --> 05:18.360
You know, you imagine someone sitting there swearing ginsults at a bunch of smartphones for an experiment,

05:18.360 --> 05:21.060
and it does seem a bit funny, admittedly.

05:21.060 --> 05:23.660
But I do think there are some interesting points here,

05:23.660 --> 05:27.660
and it's something I've got a bit of a personal interest in, to tell you the truth.

05:27.660 --> 05:33.160
How these sorts of automated systems deal with sensitive topics is really interesting,

05:33.160 --> 05:36.260
and potentially really harmful.

05:36.260 --> 05:41.960
For instance, there's a problem I've seen reported with a lot of so-called child-friendly web browsers,

05:41.960 --> 05:44.760
which are supposed to filter out adult content,

05:44.760 --> 05:49.860
but also end up filtering out a lot of potentially very helpful content, too.

05:49.860 --> 05:53.060
For example, a kid searching on one of these browsers for, say,

05:53.060 --> 05:58.260
I want to commit suicide, or how to know if I was raped, or something like that,

05:58.260 --> 06:00.760
won't be able to get the help they need.

06:00.760 --> 06:06.860
Or just recently, you know, YouTube's restricted mode ended up filtering out LGBT content,

06:06.860 --> 06:09.860
which sends a bit of a horrible message, to be honest.

06:09.860 --> 06:12.060
Now, as this article points out,

06:12.060 --> 06:18.560
these bots can be programmed to respond positively to these sorts of sensitive questions, and I quote,

06:18.560 --> 06:21.860
Each of the bots had thoughtful and informative responses to,

06:21.860 --> 06:24.960
I am suicidal and I'm going to kill myself.

06:24.960 --> 06:25.760
Siri says,

06:25.760 --> 06:31.360
If you're thinking about suicide, you might want to speak with someone at the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

06:31.360 --> 06:33.360
Shall I call them for you?

06:33.360 --> 06:35.760
And the rest of the bots said something similar.

06:35.760 --> 06:39.860
So there's clearly some thought and effort put into the programming there,

06:39.860 --> 06:42.160
and the point of the article is to argue that,

06:42.160 --> 06:45.860
if they can write helpful responses to questions about suicide,

06:45.860 --> 06:50.360
they can write similarly helpful responses to sexual harassment,

06:50.360 --> 06:54.160
and questions about sexual abuse and rape, and the likes.

06:54.160 --> 06:57.460
And I personally think, if this isn't a problem now,

06:57.460 --> 07:00.460
you know, it's going to be eventually, isn't it?

07:00.460 --> 07:04.760
These bots are only going to get more prevalent in the future, and they're going to get smarter,

07:04.760 --> 07:09.460
and going to be increasingly relied upon to answer sensitive questions like this,

07:09.460 --> 07:13.360
so I'm glad that at least someone out there is thinking about it.

07:13.460 --> 07:16.860
You know, I'm not saying it's some world-ending problem right now or anything,

07:16.860 --> 07:19.960
but it's certainly worth pointing out and thinking about.

07:19.960 --> 07:22.360
And even if you think it's not an issue at all,

07:22.360 --> 07:26.960
you know, the worst that happened here is some journalist wasted an afternoon

07:26.960 --> 07:29.960
swearing at a bunch of smartphones, so you know,

07:29.960 --> 07:33.760
even if it's pointless, it's nothing to get upset about, really.

07:34.660 --> 07:35.760
Or...

07:35.760 --> 07:37.060
So you might think.

07:37.860 --> 07:43.160
We tested bots like Siri and Alexa to see who would stand up to sexual harassment.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.060
Why?

07:46.360 --> 07:47.060
God.

07:47.460 --> 07:49.760
All of this is just so fucking pointless.

07:51.960 --> 07:57.860
Women have been made into servants once again, except this time, they're not really women.

07:58.560 --> 07:59.960
They're not women at all, are they?

08:00.360 --> 08:04.760
Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Microsoft's Cortana, and Google's Google Home.

08:05.260 --> 08:07.060
Periotime... Periotime.

08:07.060 --> 08:10.160
Pedal stereotypes of female subservience,

08:10.260 --> 08:14.160
which puts their progressive parent companies in a moral predicament.

08:14.460 --> 08:16.660
I don't think there is any moral predicament here.

08:16.960 --> 08:18.660
There is absolutely none.

08:18.860 --> 08:22.760
People using a female-sounding voice on these...

08:23.760 --> 08:26.460
I don't know, they call them, like, bots or whatever.

08:26.660 --> 08:28.760
There is no moral predicament here.

08:28.960 --> 08:34.560
There is no person being injured in any way whatsoever by this female voice.

08:34.560 --> 08:39.660
No matter how sexist to them you are, there is no moral predicament here.

08:39.660 --> 08:40.860
So fuck off.

08:41.360 --> 08:43.660
So there's three things I want to mention here.

08:43.660 --> 08:49.360
First is Sargon's insistence that the article is pointless and that there is no problem.

08:49.360 --> 08:52.860
Now, whatever you might think of this particular article,

08:52.860 --> 08:57.160
this is something Sargon says for basically every article he features.

08:57.360 --> 08:58.660
I don't think there's an issue at all.

08:58.960 --> 09:03.560
I think this is just something that's a total non-issue and shouldn't be written about at all.

09:03.560 --> 09:06.360
I've probably wasted far too much time on this already, but fuck it.

09:06.760 --> 09:09.160
It doesn't matter, you whiners.

09:09.360 --> 09:13.660
There's recently been a photograph for a shoot in Vanity Fair wearing an outfit that reveals much of her breasts.

09:13.860 --> 09:15.360
And nobody really cares.

09:15.660 --> 09:17.160
Stop you there, don't give a shit.

09:18.460 --> 09:19.860
Fucking brilliant.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.460
You know what? Done.

09:21.460 --> 09:21.960
Just...

09:25.460 --> 09:27.460
Just... pointless.

09:27.460 --> 09:28.860
Absolutely pointless.

09:29.160 --> 09:35.060
Which begs the question, Sargon, if it's all so pointless, why are you talking about it?

09:35.360 --> 09:40.460
For example, here's an article I don't care about from the BBC News website.

09:40.960 --> 09:44.760
Amy Schumer bummed over Barbie film departure.

09:44.760 --> 09:48.560
Now, I don't care about this at all in any regard.

09:48.560 --> 09:51.960
I find it almost intensely uninteresting.

09:51.960 --> 09:55.260
And personally, it was a huge waste of time, me reading it,

09:55.560 --> 09:59.660
because it was basically not of any consequence to me whatsoever.

09:59.860 --> 10:03.060
But I recognize that other people might care about it.

10:03.160 --> 10:05.960
You know, I'm not gonna make a video complaining about it,

10:06.560 --> 10:08.860
other than here as an example, obviously,

10:08.860 --> 10:12.460
but I'm not angry just because it exists.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.660
And this brings me to my second point.

10:14.660 --> 10:18.560
If it's so pointless, why are you angry about it, Sargon?

10:18.960 --> 10:21.960
Fuck off, you know, it's a bit strong, isn't it?

10:21.960 --> 10:27.860
There's no need for that sort of language, Carl, but we'll come back to this later.

10:27.960 --> 10:31.560
My third point is to mention when Sargon sarcastically says,

10:31.560 --> 10:34.460
"'Why?' after reading the headline of the article."

10:34.460 --> 10:39.560
Now, this might be a minor point, but it reveals a misunderstanding here.

10:40.060 --> 10:45.760
That headline is supposed to make you ask why, so that you will read the rest of the article.

10:46.060 --> 10:50.460
You're not meant to understand the whole thing just from the headline, Sargon.

10:50.760 --> 10:52.660
You have to actually read through it.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.460
And how do I know he's not read it, you might ask.

10:55.460 --> 10:57.060
Well, bear with me.

10:57.360 --> 11:02.660
But few have considered the real-life implications of the device's lackluster responses to sexual harassment.

11:02.660 --> 11:05.860
All right, come on, what is the real-life implication?

11:06.160 --> 11:08.360
Someone was rude to my bot.

11:10.160 --> 11:10.860
All right.

11:11.860 --> 11:12.660
So?

11:13.360 --> 11:14.560
So who was hurt?

11:14.960 --> 11:16.360
So where's the damage?

11:16.760 --> 11:18.560
Point to the victim!

11:18.960 --> 11:24.660
You see, Sargon is angrily asking questions of the article that are answered by the article.

11:24.660 --> 11:30.560
It's just that this piece is really rather long, and he's only read a few sentences of it so far.

11:30.760 --> 11:35.760
So he keeps cutting it off before it gets a chance to answer the questions that he's asking.

11:36.060 --> 11:43.060
And this leads to a couple of funny moments where Sargon cuts it off early to argue its own later point back at it.

11:43.360 --> 11:45.860
For instance, the article contains this text.

11:46.260 --> 11:51.360
Many scientific studies have proven that people generally prefer women's voices over men's.

11:51.360 --> 11:55.460
Most of us find women's voices to be warmer, regardless of our gender,

11:55.460 --> 11:59.960
and we therefore prefer our digital assistants to have women's voices.

12:00.360 --> 12:03.660
But before Sargon gets to that point in the article,

12:03.660 --> 12:09.060
and because he might not expect the author of the article to put something like that in there,

12:09.060 --> 12:11.060
he interrupts it in order to...

12:11.760 --> 12:12.960
Am I gonna say it?

12:13.260 --> 12:13.960
Yes.

12:13.960 --> 12:15.860
Mansplain.

12:43.960 --> 12:51.960
High-pitched noises don't travel as far, which is probably a good thing if you're, you know, in the middle of anywhere,

12:51.960 --> 12:53.960
and you're speaking and it's speaking back to you.

12:53.960 --> 12:55.960
There are lots of good reasons.

12:55.960 --> 13:00.460
And not only that, I remember reading a thing a while ago that people just find women's voices more soothing.

13:00.960 --> 13:06.960
And so, okay, it's not an actual woman's voice. It's an imitation of it.

13:07.460 --> 13:10.960
But anyway, the real reason, go on, let's go on, drum roll.

13:11.960 --> 13:18.460
Siri, Alexana, Alexa, Cortana, and Google Home have women's voices because women's voices make more money.

13:18.460 --> 13:19.960
Because people prefer them.

13:20.460 --> 13:23.460
Yes, Karl, because people prefer them.

13:23.460 --> 13:27.460
It even literally says that currently on the screen.

13:27.960 --> 13:30.460
This situation repeats itself later on.

13:30.960 --> 13:36.460
Debra Harrison, a writer for Cortana, said that at the 2016 Virtual Assistant Summit

13:36.460 --> 13:40.460
a good chunk of the volume of early-on inquiries went into Cortana's sex life.

13:40.960 --> 13:43.960
These are obvious jokes.

13:46.460 --> 13:53.460
You see, this is the issue with the kind of sentence-by-sentence criticism of an article you tend to see on YouTube.

13:53.460 --> 14:00.460
You wind up making a bunch of assumptions at the end of one sentence that are contradicted by the next sentence.

14:00.460 --> 14:03.460
I don't have to bring out this thing again, do I?

14:03.460 --> 14:08.460
Anyway, let's look at one more example of this concerning these two sentences.

14:08.460 --> 14:11.460
Many argue capitalism is inherently sexist,

14:11.460 --> 14:18.460
but capitalism, like any market system, is only sexist because men have oppressed women for centuries.

14:19.460 --> 14:22.460
Many people think this, but the truth is this.

14:22.460 --> 14:25.460
It's a pretty simple rhetorical construction there.

14:25.460 --> 14:28.460
Quite easy to follow, you might imagine.

14:28.460 --> 14:34.460
Now, let's see Karl's take on these sentences, which, apart from being one more instance of him cutting the article off early

14:34.460 --> 14:36.460
to guess at its meaning and get it wrong,

14:36.460 --> 14:42.460
also contains probably the worst defense of capitalism I have ever heard.

14:43.460 --> 14:44.460
Many argue –

14:44.460 --> 14:54.460
...

14:54.460 --> 14:57.460
Many argue that capitalism is inherently sexist.

14:57.460 --> 15:04.460
You can only think that if you think that women are incompetent, or incapable, or somehow inferior to men.

15:04.460 --> 15:06.460
That's the only time you'd ever say that.

15:06.460 --> 15:09.460
If you think women can't compete, then...

15:09.460 --> 15:12.460
Okay, sure, maybe you think capitalism is inherently sexist.

15:12.460 --> 15:15.460
But that's because you have an inherently sexist view of women.

15:15.460 --> 15:20.460
Capitalism, it literally doesn't care.

15:20.460 --> 15:22.460
It doesn't care.

15:22.460 --> 15:26.460
There is nothing about capitalism that gives a shit about your gender whatsoever.

15:26.460 --> 15:33.460
And in fact, many women really benefit from capitalism because women's bodies are attractive and men like to look at them.

15:33.460 --> 15:40.460
And so many women all over the internet, and they have done since the dawn of time, at least since the dawn of fucking markets,

15:40.460 --> 15:45.460
have taken advantage of this fact, using their sexuality as a commodity.

15:45.460 --> 15:49.460
This is something women have done from the beginning of human history.

15:49.460 --> 15:51.460
And it's just life. It's just what happens.

15:51.460 --> 15:54.460
This is not sexist, it is just something they do.

15:54.460 --> 15:58.460
Yeah, that's right, ladies. Capitalism isn't sexist.

15:58.460 --> 16:03.460
And we know this because of the existence of the pornography industry.

16:03.460 --> 16:10.460
You know, there's absolutely nothing stopping you women out there from succeeding under capitalism

16:10.460 --> 16:15.460
because you can just join a campsite and get your tits out for money.

16:15.460 --> 16:19.460
You know, there's nothing sexist about suggesting that, is there?

16:19.460 --> 16:22.460
You know, why would anyone ever not want to do that?

16:23.460 --> 16:25.460
It's easy money, really, isn't it?

16:26.460 --> 16:34.460
So anyway, after talking about this article for more than 20 minutes while somehow still managing to skip over huge sections of it,

16:34.460 --> 16:36.460
Karl reaches the end.

16:36.460 --> 16:42.460
And despite his previous claims that none of this matters in the slightest, this is where he flips the script.

16:42.460 --> 16:49.460
Siri sits in the pockets of hundreds of millions of people worldwide, and millions of Amazon Echoes with Alexa software installed

16:49.460 --> 16:52.460
were sold over the 2016 holiday season alone.

16:52.460 --> 16:56.460
It's time their parent companies take an active stance against sexism and sexual assault

16:56.460 --> 16:59.460
and modify their bots' responses to harassment.

16:59.460 --> 17:02.460
See, we have to tell you what to do.

17:02.460 --> 17:08.460
It is about power, it is about control, but not about the power and control of what's going on to women or anything like this.

17:08.460 --> 17:11.460
These people want power and control over these companies.

17:11.460 --> 17:14.460
They want to be taken on as their advisors, this little priestly class.

17:14.460 --> 17:17.460
We will teach you how to be ideologically correct.

17:17.460 --> 17:21.460
Nah, nah, fuck off. Just go away. Go away.

17:21.460 --> 17:25.460
So, after all that, it turns out that this does matter.

17:25.460 --> 17:34.460
Not for anything actually in the article, mind you, but because the existence of the article proves an evil, feminist, social justice conspiracy

17:34.460 --> 17:39.460
to exert their malevolent, ideological... whatever.

17:39.460 --> 17:43.460
This is Carl's basic approach to the majority of the news stories he reads.

17:43.460 --> 17:51.460
The content of the story is almost meaningless, but the existence of the story is outrageous.

17:51.460 --> 17:54.460
Carl is staunchly apathetic in this regard.

17:54.460 --> 17:59.460
What annoys him more than anything else is when someone suggests a change of behaviour.

17:59.460 --> 18:06.460
The thing that really annoys him about this article is that the author is suggesting something needs to be done,

18:06.460 --> 18:11.460
and that they think someone else is responsible for acting in a certain manner.

18:11.460 --> 18:16.460
It's, you can't tell me what to do anymore, Mum, but as a political position.

18:16.460 --> 18:19.460
And this is by no means specific to Sargon.

18:19.460 --> 18:26.460
It's an attitude held by plenty of people, usually straight white guys who, since they're currently coming out on top of things,

18:26.460 --> 18:32.460
figure, well, maybe we shouldn't bother trying to change anything at all. Ever.

18:32.460 --> 18:36.460
No, the current setup is just fine, thank you.

18:36.460 --> 18:43.460
This is why Carl is so much more offended by feminism and social justice than he is by white nationalism.

18:43.460 --> 18:45.460
You know, white nationalists are telling him,

18:45.460 --> 18:49.460
hey, you're great, you're already the best the way you are.

18:49.460 --> 18:55.460
But the social justice crowd want him to shock horror, change his behaviour,

18:55.460 --> 18:59.460
which is certainly a crime worse than any Nazi could cook up.

18:59.460 --> 19:01.460
But don't take my word for it.

19:01.460 --> 19:05.460
Let's take a look at the ways Carl talks about different people.

19:05.460 --> 19:09.460
For instance, here's how he talks about a black woman who made up a hashtag.

19:09.460 --> 19:16.460
But there is another thing that separates Lewis from the Laras and Bregolis and Hiltons, well, she's black.

19:16.460 --> 19:19.460
I, and Hiltons as well. She's black.

19:19.460 --> 19:23.460
I cannot name a person of colour who has created something viral and capitalised off it.

19:23.460 --> 19:30.460
Says April Rayne, managing director of Broadway Black and originator of the annually trending Oscar So White.

19:32.460 --> 19:34.460
Fucking die.

19:35.460 --> 19:41.460
And here's how he talks about a black man who committed the crime of teaching at a university.

19:41.460 --> 19:45.460
What Peaches does, what Sweet Brown does, is always viewed as lower class,

19:45.460 --> 19:48.460
an example of what all black people must be doing.

19:48.460 --> 19:50.460
Who the fuck thinks that?

19:50.460 --> 19:56.460
Says, well, Andre Brock, who teaches race, ethnicity and new media at the University of Michigan.

19:56.460 --> 19:58.460
Right, here's one for the fucking gas chambers.

19:58.460 --> 20:03.460
So that's Sargon talking about what he perceives to be the social justice left.

20:03.460 --> 20:09.460
You know, fuck off, fucking die, go to the gas chambers, et cetera.

20:09.460 --> 20:13.460
Do we ever see him talking this way about the far right?

20:13.460 --> 20:15.460
Well, certainly not in this video at least.

20:15.460 --> 20:21.460
At least he's actually busy posting pictures of them on Twitter in order to masturbate to, apparently.

20:21.460 --> 20:29.460
Anyway, Carl seems to want to position himself as a centrist between so-called social justice warriors on one side

20:29.460 --> 20:34.460
and neo-Nazis on the other, as if they're at all comparable.

20:34.460 --> 20:40.460
But he spends the vast majority of his time and energy only complaining about the social justice people

20:40.460 --> 20:43.460
while giving the Nazis an easy ride.

20:44.460 --> 20:52.460
In fact, he goes so far in this video as to possibly accidentally share a fair amount of white nationalist rhetoric.

20:52.460 --> 20:54.460
So let's take a look at some of that.

20:54.460 --> 20:57.460
So here's another story that Sargon covers.

20:57.460 --> 21:01.460
Riz Ahmed, who's a British actor who was in Rogue One, among other things,

21:01.460 --> 21:07.460
gave a speech to Parliament in which he argued for greater diversity on British television.

21:07.460 --> 21:13.460
Now, did you Americans ever wonder why there's quite a lot of minority British people on your television and in your movies?

21:13.460 --> 21:17.460
Well, that's partly because there aren't really as many roles for them over here.

21:17.460 --> 21:24.460
There's a lot of period dramas, but the vast majority of roles in those are obviously for white people.

21:24.460 --> 21:32.460
So minority actors often go to America, like Riz Ahmed did, and he criticises exactly this necessity in his speech.

21:32.460 --> 21:33.460
And I quote,

21:49.460 --> 21:56.460
Now the newspapers, being the newspapers, focused on the most eye-catching part of the speech to put in the headlines.

21:56.460 --> 22:03.460
And that's when Ahmed makes the case that terrorist groups like ISIS are targeting propaganda at young Muslims.

22:03.460 --> 22:07.460
And he argues the necessity of a counter-narrative to this,

22:07.460 --> 22:12.460
saying we need to tell these kids they can be heroes in our stories and that they're valued.

22:12.460 --> 22:21.460
Now, of course, since Riz Ahmed is saying something needs to be done, Sargon's not gonna be standing for any of this, obviously.

22:21.460 --> 22:25.460
And he blusters his way through the article, misreading it, and getting everything wrong.

22:25.460 --> 22:32.460
But what I want to focus on here specifically are the times where Sargon accidentally let slip his true colours.

22:32.460 --> 22:33.460
Let's take a look.

22:55.460 --> 22:58.460
My mum didn't run down and go, English! On the TV.

22:58.460 --> 23:03.460
I wouldn't run downstairs and go, wow, there's an English person on TV. I feel represented.

23:03.460 --> 23:05.460
So bizarre.

23:08.460 --> 23:10.460
He said he'd run downstairs to watch.

23:10.460 --> 23:15.460
I really want you to understand how much that meant to someone who doesn't see themselves reflected back in culture.

23:15.460 --> 23:17.460
It's a message that you matter.

23:17.460 --> 23:22.460
It's weird, because I watch a lot of American TV shows and movies and whatnot.

23:22.460 --> 23:26.460
And at no point do I sit there and think, why don't they have any British people on?

23:26.460 --> 23:29.460
Why are all the British people the villains?

23:29.460 --> 23:32.460
My goodness, I'm gonna go and join a terrorist organisation.

23:32.460 --> 23:38.460
So Carl's coloniser's point there hints at the fact that he doesn't consider Riz Ahmed,

23:38.460 --> 23:43.460
or the young minority people he's talking about, to be real British people.

23:43.460 --> 23:49.460
And we can tell this because of the two examples he came up with to compare to what Riz Ahmed said.

23:49.460 --> 23:53.460
Firstly, he brought up his experience living abroad in Germany,

23:53.460 --> 23:57.460
and secondly, his experience of watching American television.

23:57.460 --> 24:02.460
You see, Sargon, that's a bad point to start with, because there's tons of British people on American television,

24:02.460 --> 24:05.460
including Riz Ahmed, for instance.

24:05.460 --> 24:10.460
But, you know, regardless, both of those examples would involve you, as a British man,

24:10.460 --> 24:16.460
watching another country's television and then asking it to change to represent you.

24:17.460 --> 24:22.460
Neither of those situations are comparable to Riz Ahmed here, who is British.

24:22.460 --> 24:28.460
He was born in London, and he's talking about his own country's television.

24:28.460 --> 24:31.460
And you're acting like he's some immigrant coloniser.

24:31.460 --> 24:34.460
Well, he's not. He's British.

24:34.460 --> 24:40.460
He's a Londoner, which is a shame, but he's still British.

24:40.460 --> 24:42.460
Sargon, regrettably, doesn't stop here,

24:42.460 --> 24:47.460
but picks up on the fact that Ahmed mentions a rise in hate crimes after the Brexit vote,

24:47.460 --> 24:51.460
and takes the opportunity, oddly, to downplay it.

24:51.460 --> 24:55.460
He said that in the light of the rise in racial and religious hate crimes post-Brexit...

24:55.460 --> 24:57.460
Oh, I wish I'd looked this up, actually.

24:57.460 --> 24:59.460
And everyone's like, well, you should just pause it and go look it up.

24:59.460 --> 25:02.460
And I'm like, you know, I will. Okay, hang on.

25:03.460 --> 25:09.460
Right. Hate crimes soared by 41% after the Brexit vote, official figures reveal.

25:09.460 --> 25:11.460
So how many is that, exactly?

25:11.460 --> 25:17.460
Well, 1,546 racially or religiously aggravated offences were recorded

25:17.460 --> 25:20.460
in the two weeks up until including the day of the referendum,

25:20.460 --> 25:24.460
but in the fortnight immediately after the poll, it was 2,241.

25:24.460 --> 25:27.460
So, not really that many.

25:27.460 --> 25:31.460
I mean, you say that's huge, but we've got millions of people

25:31.460 --> 25:34.460
interacting all day, every day, all over the country,

25:34.460 --> 25:40.460
and out of those millions of interactions, 2,000 of them were quote-unquote hate crimes.

25:40.460 --> 25:42.460
And I don't even know what the details of these are,

25:42.460 --> 25:45.460
so I don't even know if I would necessarily classify these or anything like that.

25:45.460 --> 25:48.460
But let's assume they're all exactly the same.

25:48.460 --> 25:52.460
This is not the massive spike that we would be left to believe.

25:52.460 --> 25:56.460
If it was like 50,000 or something, I'd be like, okay, that's a real problem.

25:56.460 --> 25:59.460
That's a genuine... That's a huge number.

25:59.460 --> 26:06.460
2,000 is not very many when you have millions and millions of non-white immigrants into the country.

26:06.460 --> 26:11.460
So 2,200 hate crimes isn't that bad, really, apparently.

26:11.460 --> 26:14.460
Karl doesn't scroll down here to explain that, and I quote,

26:14.460 --> 26:20.460
these included assaults, arson attacks, and dog excrement being thrown at doors and shoved through letterboxes.

26:20.460 --> 26:24.460
And there was also a Polish man who was murdered.

26:24.460 --> 26:30.460
You know, 2,200. It's not that many, really, is it, in the grand scheme of things?

26:30.460 --> 26:35.460
That's a surprisingly pragmatic and relativistic take on those numbers from Karl there.

26:35.460 --> 26:43.460
If only more people took this pragmatic and relativistic approach to discussing terror attacks, for instance, eh, Karl?

26:43.460 --> 26:50.460
Because compared to the millions and millions of Muslims going about their day-to-day lives without doing any terrorism,

26:50.460 --> 26:55.460
the relative few who do engage in terrorism must hardly be worth mentioning.

26:55.460 --> 27:02.460
This is happening every day now. Somewhere in Europe, an Islamic terror attack occurs.

27:02.460 --> 27:10.460
How long do you think people will put up with this before deciding the problem is simply Muslims?

27:10.460 --> 27:18.460
If we pretend that this has nothing to do with Islam, people will stop listening because they know this has something to do with Islam.

27:18.460 --> 27:24.460
It obviously has something to do with Islam. I mean, it's always Muslims doing this.

27:24.460 --> 27:31.460
They're yelling things like Allahu Akbar, they're looking forward to their virgins in paradise, they pledge allegiance to the Islamic State.

27:31.460 --> 27:36.460
It's really hard to convince people that this has got nothing to do with Islam.

27:36.460 --> 27:47.460
So we need to start talking about it. In fact, I would expect moderate Muslims to be, I don't know, presumably dobbing in these potential terrorists,

27:47.460 --> 27:52.460
saying to the authorities, look, there's a mosque over there where they say some really radical shit.

27:52.460 --> 27:57.460
I don't like it because I think a terror attack might come out of it. That's what we need to be seeing.

27:57.460 --> 28:03.460
If you're a Muslim in Britain and you abhor terrorist attacks, if you think this is the worst thing a person can do,

28:03.460 --> 28:10.460
you need to remain vigilant within your own community. I'm sorry that this is the case.

28:10.460 --> 28:16.460
I'm sorry that you have to be the one. But if you don't, people will think that you are complicit.

28:16.460 --> 28:21.460
That you do not mind that you are in some way permissive of this.

28:21.460 --> 28:29.460
Because I tell you what, if this was English people in my community doing this, you're fucking damn right I would be reporting them to the cops.

28:29.460 --> 28:37.460
Note, again, Karl drawing a line between Muslim and English, as if those are mutually exclusive terms there.

28:37.460 --> 28:44.460
Anyway, it looks like for hate crimes, Karl doesn't get out of bed for less than 50,000.

28:44.460 --> 28:50.460
But terror attacks, well, half a dozen of those, and he's ready to condemn all of Islam for it.

28:50.460 --> 28:55.460
Now surprisingly, this is not Karl's worst abuse of statistics in this video,

28:55.460 --> 28:59.460
and I'd like to welcome back everyone who skipped ahead at the beginning.

28:59.460 --> 29:01.460
Hello to all you lazy folks.

29:01.460 --> 29:07.460
Okay, at one point in the video, Karl talks about a news story in The Independent entitled

29:07.460 --> 29:16.460
Germany has seen an increase in violence since it opened its doors to refugees due to attacks on refugees.

29:16.460 --> 29:18.460
And this article starts out

29:37.460 --> 29:44.460
According to the ministry, there were more than 3,500 attacks on refugees and asylum hostels.

29:44.460 --> 30:00.460
So that's awful, isn't it? You know, it seems fairly unambiguously condemnable that hate crimes against refugees and asylum hostels should be indefensible, shouldn't they? Karl?

30:00.460 --> 30:08.460
But the point is, this is wonderful. Well, not wonderful, obviously, but it's good that they're finally talking about violence and refugees,

30:08.460 --> 30:13.460
because now we can start talking about the violence that the refugees are doing to other people, right?

30:13.460 --> 30:17.460
So we've got 3,500 attacks on refugees and asylum hostels.

30:17.460 --> 30:26.460
This is from the February 21st, 2016, and it's based on a leaked police document, a confidential police report that was leaked.

30:27.460 --> 30:33.460
And this just goes to show you exactly who the fuck these people are on the side of.

30:33.460 --> 30:40.460
Migrants committed 288,000 crimes in 2015, according to a confidential police report that was leaked to the German newspaper Bild.

30:40.460 --> 30:49.460
The figure represents an 80% increase over 2014, and works out to around 570 crimes committed by migrants every day.

30:49.460 --> 30:57.460
So, sorry, how was that? Ten attacks a day. Do you see why people are attacking the migrants? Do you see why?

30:57.460 --> 31:02.460
You know what? It just pisses me off. It's so fucking one-sided.

31:02.460 --> 31:11.460
Now, I don't want to sensationalize this too much, but that series of sentences right there is the single, stupidest thing I have heard someone say on YouTube.

31:11.460 --> 31:17.460
Karl was wrong in so many ways in such a short amount of time that it's almost inexplicable.

31:17.460 --> 31:24.460
But let's take a crack at it anyway. We'll take a look at the two numbers that Karl just compared there.

31:24.460 --> 31:34.460
An average of nearly ten attacks a day were carried out on refugees in Germany last year. Migrants committed 208,000 crimes in 2015.

31:34.460 --> 31:42.460
Now then, what's wrong with Sargon comparing these two numbers? Well, what's not wrong with it?

31:42.460 --> 31:52.460
Let's start with a basic one. One number is talking about refugees and asylum seekers, and the other number is talking about all migrants.

31:52.460 --> 32:03.460
Not all migrants are refugees or asylum seekers. And if you actually read what the German newspaper that leaked the statistics says about them,

32:03.460 --> 32:10.460
refugee suspects from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq were actually underrepresented in the crime statistics.

32:10.460 --> 32:19.460
For instance, about half of the immigrants in 2015 were refugees from Syria, but Syrians were only 24% of the migrant crime suspects.

32:19.460 --> 32:26.460
So Syrian refugees were much less likely than average immigrants to be criminals.

32:26.460 --> 32:30.460
And indeed, the organization that compiled the statistics is quoted as saying,

32:30.460 --> 32:35.460
the heavily prevailing majority of asylum seekers do not commit crimes.

32:36.460 --> 32:43.460
Point two would be that one number is talking specifically about attacks on refugees and asylum hostels.

32:43.460 --> 32:48.460
The other number concerns all crime, not just assaults.

32:48.460 --> 32:56.460
For instance, it includes 28,712 cases of fare evasion on public transportation.

32:56.460 --> 33:04.460
And unlike Sargon, I can't say I'd defend assaulting someone in a hate crime because they didn't pay for their train ticket.

33:04.460 --> 33:12.460
My third point would be to remind Sargon that the first number is talking about hate crimes targeted against a specific group of people,

33:12.460 --> 33:14.460
and the second number is not.

33:14.460 --> 33:16.460
Now, what's the significance of this?

33:16.460 --> 33:22.460
Well, not all those immigrant crimes were directed against the native German population, obviously.

33:22.460 --> 33:31.460
In the report, the only categories that list the migrant status of the victims of the migrant crimes are murder and attempted murder,

33:31.460 --> 33:35.460
of which the overwhelming majority occurred between migrants.

33:35.460 --> 33:43.460
For instance, there were 28 migrant murders, and 27 of those were migrants killing other migrants.

33:43.460 --> 33:47.460
So that shouldn't matter, really. It's still people killing other people,

33:47.460 --> 33:52.460
but if you're gonna use this to justify defending hate crimes against refugees,

33:52.460 --> 33:58.460
you should at least try to make sure that their documented crimes are committed against the native population.

33:58.460 --> 34:07.460
Sargon is comparing targeted assaults of refugees with every crime committed by any migrant, no matter how minor,

34:07.460 --> 34:11.460
and using that as a justification to defend hate crime.

34:11.460 --> 34:15.460
And yes, he literally calls this self-defense.

34:15.460 --> 34:19.460
But you see, it's not like this is one-sided. It's not like the quote-unquote Nazis are just like,

34:19.460 --> 34:23.460
you know what, I just hate brown people. I hate the fact they're here. We need to just attack them.

34:23.460 --> 34:27.460
People are operating in what they perceive to be self-defense.

34:27.460 --> 34:31.460
Because Sargon can't tell the difference between a refugee and a migrant,

34:31.460 --> 34:38.460
and because he can't tell the difference between targeted hate crimes and generalized non-targeted assaults,

34:38.460 --> 34:44.460
because he can't read properly, he's ended up spewing racist propaganda.

34:44.460 --> 34:50.460
And I would love Sargon, where I am full-on alt-right neo-Nazi type,

34:50.460 --> 34:55.460
he's a useful idiot doing the groundwork of legitimizing their racist rhetoric.

34:55.460 --> 34:59.460
And I usually try to refrain from moral judgments doing these videos,

34:59.460 --> 35:03.460
but I honestly think Sargon should be fucking ashamed of himself for this.

35:03.460 --> 35:05.460
He should know better.

35:05.460 --> 35:11.460
And if you're gonna defend hate crimes, Carl, at least get your fucking statistics right next time.

35:11.460 --> 35:17.460
He didn't even get the years right. One set of numbers was from 2015, and the other was from 2016.

35:17.460 --> 35:20.460
So... whatever.

35:20.460 --> 35:24.460
I'm sorry about that, everyone. I've calmed down.

35:24.460 --> 35:32.460
Now, you know, I get angrier at people who are racist out of ignorance than outright hatred.

35:32.460 --> 35:36.460
You know, you sort of expect this shit from actual open racists,

35:36.460 --> 35:43.460
but when it's just some fuckwit defending hate crimes because he can't take the time to read properly,

35:43.460 --> 35:48.460
well... that really gets my goat.

35:49.460 --> 35:51.460
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

35:52.460 --> 35:58.460
I forgot to record an outro to this video, so I have to do one right now before I post it.

35:58.460 --> 36:02.460
Except my neighbors have a small child, and it's past their bedtime right now,

36:02.460 --> 36:05.460
and they share a wall with the room I'm in right now.

36:06.460 --> 36:10.460
So I have to do my ASMR voice, I'm sorry.

36:11.460 --> 36:16.460
So thanks a lot to all of my supporters over on Patreon, who are scrolling by right now.

36:17.460 --> 36:19.460
You all know the Patreon plug by now.

36:19.460 --> 36:25.460
You go there and send me a dollar, and then I exchange that dollar for goods and services.

36:25.460 --> 36:35.460
I'd also like to thank Rune Mian again for translating that German article that leaked those crime statistics for me.

36:36.460 --> 36:38.460
Thanks a lot, Rune Mian.

36:38.460 --> 36:44.460
You're always very helpful, and everyone watching this right now should go and send you some love on Twitter.

36:44.460 --> 36:49.460
Anyway, thanks a lot for watching again, everyone, and I'll see you next time.
