0	1260	Hello, everyone.
1260	8680	So, when our pal Sargon of Akkad isn't harassing innocent women by photographing them and tweeting out where they live and work,
8680	12240	he still finds time to make a YouTube video or two.
13240	15100	How's that for an intro there?
15100	21740	Uh, so today, I'm gonna be looking at one of Sargon's recent videos in his This Week in Stupid series,
21740	26000	where he reads out some recent news items and then complains a lot.
26000	29760	And Sargon recently tried something a little different with this series,
29760	37560	instead of posting shorter, edited videos, he tried releasing a couple of longer, less scripted, off-the-cuff videos.
37560	42500	Now, the danger with this approach is that you're more likely to make mistakes, you know,
42500	46360	misquote something, misread something, take something out of context.
46360	53460	And Sargon has since abandoned this style of video, saying that making that type of content made him feel lazy.
54060	57460	Of course, the other danger here is that some handsome chap will come along
57460	61860	and make a list of all the mistakes you made in order to have a bit of a laugh at you.
62260	64560	Now, is that unfair?
64860	68960	You know, Sargon posts an experimental, long-form, unscripted video,
68960	72360	and then I go through it and nitpick it for mistakes.
72660	78060	Well, maybe that's unfair, but I do think there's still some points to be made here.
78060	82760	With Sargon specifically, I think it gives us a bit of a peek behind the curtain.
82960	88360	And there are parts of this video where I'd argue Carl flirts with open white nationalism
88360	92160	in a much more obvious way than I see him do in his more scripted videos.
92660	97660	More generally, though, the particular ways in which Carl misreads articles and news stories
97660	102160	is illustrative of how a lot of other people misread articles and news stories
102160	104560	and end up coming to silly conclusions.
104960	109560	There's a definite lack of basic journalistic understanding at play here.
110060	115260	For all Carl and his, like, hate on universities for being social justice hugboxers,
115260	119160	they really could do with going and taking a writing course sometime.
119160	123360	So we're also gonna focus on Carl's method of reading these articles
123360	126060	and how, in particular, he misreads.
126360	130360	This is how I kid myself into doing these sorts of response videos.
130360	133260	You know, I try and make it into some wider points
133260	136860	so it's not just me laughing at a guy for being wrong.
137660	140860	So I think what we'll do here is, before we get to Carl,
140860	145260	pick out one of the stories that he reads and we'll briefly scan through it ourselves,
145260	149260	have a little chat about it, and then we'll watch his take on it.
149760	155160	Though I will say, if you're short on time and you just wanna see the worst thing that Carl said today
155160	157560	and can't really be bothered with all of the reading,
157560	163560	skip to the timecode currently on the screen to see Carl being so offensively wrong about something
163560	166560	that it's actually legitimately concerning.
166560	172560	Anyway, for everyone else, we'll start with this article from the news website QZ.com.
197560	200160	So, what have we just read?
200160	205860	Well, it's the headline and first few sentences of an article about how the digital personal assistants
205860	211960	on smartphones and tablets and the likes handle talking about the topic of sexual abuse.
211960	217660	And we can already see that the author of this article clearly thinks that they underperform in that regard.
217660	221760	Now, the start of an article like this is meant to be attention-grabbing.
221760	227160	You know, it's got the weird premise in the headline and then the punchy first two sentences.
227160	231960	Women have been made into servants once again, except this time they're digital.
231960	238160	It's good. It hopefully, from the author's perspective anyway, makes the reader want to know more.
238160	243660	You know, asking questions like, what's the issue, why is it a problem, who's at fault,
243660	246660	what can be done about it, things like that.
246660	252460	And the article, if it's a good article anyway, will then go on to address all of these questions.
252460	256960	And not to skip ahead here, but the reader, if they're a good reader,
256960	261460	will actually read the article to see if it answers those questions.
261460	265960	The article goes on to explain the issue, which is that these personal assistant programs
265960	273160	aren't programmed particularly well to discuss sexual harassment, rape, sex education, and topics like that.
273160	277860	And they reach out to the developers of these devices for quotes about their approach to the issue,
277860	282460	and they test the devices to see how they respond to being insulted.
282460	287260	And they come to the conclusion that the developers need to do better when they're programming
287260	291060	how the bots respond to these things, ending with,
291060	296260	rather than promoting stereotypical passivity, dismissiveness, and even flirtation with abuse,
296260	300860	these companies could become industry leaders against sexual harassment.
300860	306460	So, what do we think about this article? Well, I personally think it's well-written, it's easy to follow,
306460	309360	it gets its point across well, it's well-researched.
309360	312560	The premise, obviously, is a little silly.
312560	318360	You know, you imagine someone sitting there swearing ginsults at a bunch of smartphones for an experiment,
318360	321060	and it does seem a bit funny, admittedly.
321060	323660	But I do think there are some interesting points here,
323660	327660	and it's something I've got a bit of a personal interest in, to tell you the truth.
327660	333160	How these sorts of automated systems deal with sensitive topics is really interesting,
333160	336260	and potentially really harmful.
336260	341960	For instance, there's a problem I've seen reported with a lot of so-called child-friendly web browsers,
341960	344760	which are supposed to filter out adult content,
344760	349860	but also end up filtering out a lot of potentially very helpful content, too.
349860	353060	For example, a kid searching on one of these browsers for, say,
353060	358260	I want to commit suicide, or how to know if I was raped, or something like that,
358260	360760	won't be able to get the help they need.
360760	366860	Or just recently, you know, YouTube's restricted mode ended up filtering out LGBT content,
366860	369860	which sends a bit of a horrible message, to be honest.
369860	372060	Now, as this article points out,
372060	378560	these bots can be programmed to respond positively to these sorts of sensitive questions, and I quote,
378560	381860	Each of the bots had thoughtful and informative responses to,
381860	384960	I am suicidal and I'm going to kill myself.
384960	385760	Siri says,
385760	391360	If you're thinking about suicide, you might want to speak with someone at the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.
391360	393360	Shall I call them for you?
393360	395760	And the rest of the bots said something similar.
395760	399860	So there's clearly some thought and effort put into the programming there,
399860	402160	and the point of the article is to argue that,
402160	405860	if they can write helpful responses to questions about suicide,
405860	410360	they can write similarly helpful responses to sexual harassment,
410360	414160	and questions about sexual abuse and rape, and the likes.
414160	417460	And I personally think, if this isn't a problem now,
417460	420460	you know, it's going to be eventually, isn't it?
420460	424760	These bots are only going to get more prevalent in the future, and they're going to get smarter,
424760	429460	and going to be increasingly relied upon to answer sensitive questions like this,
429460	433360	so I'm glad that at least someone out there is thinking about it.
433460	436860	You know, I'm not saying it's some world-ending problem right now or anything,
436860	439960	but it's certainly worth pointing out and thinking about.
439960	442360	And even if you think it's not an issue at all,
442360	446960	you know, the worst that happened here is some journalist wasted an afternoon
446960	449960	swearing at a bunch of smartphones, so you know,
449960	453760	even if it's pointless, it's nothing to get upset about, really.
454660	455760	Or...
455760	457060	So you might think.
457860	463160	We tested bots like Siri and Alexa to see who would stand up to sexual harassment.
464160	465060	Why?
466360	467060	God.
467460	469760	All of this is just so fucking pointless.
471960	477860	Women have been made into servants once again, except this time, they're not really women.
478560	479960	They're not women at all, are they?
480360	484760	Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Microsoft's Cortana, and Google's Google Home.
485260	487060	Periotime... Periotime.
487060	490160	Pedal stereotypes of female subservience,
490260	494160	which puts their progressive parent companies in a moral predicament.
494460	496660	I don't think there is any moral predicament here.
496960	498660	There is absolutely none.
498860	502760	People using a female-sounding voice on these...
503760	506460	I don't know, they call them, like, bots or whatever.
506660	508760	There is no moral predicament here.
508960	514560	There is no person being injured in any way whatsoever by this female voice.
514560	519660	No matter how sexist to them you are, there is no moral predicament here.
519660	520860	So fuck off.
521360	523660	So there's three things I want to mention here.
523660	529360	First is Sargon's insistence that the article is pointless and that there is no problem.
529360	532860	Now, whatever you might think of this particular article,
532860	537160	this is something Sargon says for basically every article he features.
537360	538660	I don't think there's an issue at all.
538960	543560	I think this is just something that's a total non-issue and shouldn't be written about at all.
543560	546360	I've probably wasted far too much time on this already, but fuck it.
546760	549160	It doesn't matter, you whiners.
549360	553660	There's recently been a photograph for a shoot in Vanity Fair wearing an outfit that reveals much of her breasts.
553860	555360	And nobody really cares.
555660	557160	Stop you there, don't give a shit.
558460	559860	Fucking brilliant.
559860	561460	You know what? Done.
561460	561960	Just...
565460	567460	Just... pointless.
567460	568860	Absolutely pointless.
569160	575060	Which begs the question, Sargon, if it's all so pointless, why are you talking about it?
575360	580460	For example, here's an article I don't care about from the BBC News website.
580960	584760	Amy Schumer bummed over Barbie film departure.
584760	588560	Now, I don't care about this at all in any regard.
588560	591960	I find it almost intensely uninteresting.
591960	595260	And personally, it was a huge waste of time, me reading it,
595560	599660	because it was basically not of any consequence to me whatsoever.
599860	603060	But I recognize that other people might care about it.
603160	605960	You know, I'm not gonna make a video complaining about it,
606560	608860	other than here as an example, obviously,
608860	612460	but I'm not angry just because it exists.
612960	614660	And this brings me to my second point.
614660	618560	If it's so pointless, why are you angry about it, Sargon?
618960	621960	Fuck off, you know, it's a bit strong, isn't it?
621960	627860	There's no need for that sort of language, Carl, but we'll come back to this later.
627960	631560	My third point is to mention when Sargon sarcastically says,
631560	634460	"'Why?' after reading the headline of the article."
634460	639560	Now, this might be a minor point, but it reveals a misunderstanding here.
640060	645760	That headline is supposed to make you ask why, so that you will read the rest of the article.
646060	650460	You're not meant to understand the whole thing just from the headline, Sargon.
650760	652660	You have to actually read through it.
652860	655460	And how do I know he's not read it, you might ask.
655460	657060	Well, bear with me.
657360	662660	But few have considered the real-life implications of the device's lackluster responses to sexual harassment.
662660	665860	All right, come on, what is the real-life implication?
666160	668360	Someone was rude to my bot.
670160	670860	All right.
671860	672660	So?
673360	674560	So who was hurt?
674960	676360	So where's the damage?
676760	678560	Point to the victim!
678960	684660	You see, Sargon is angrily asking questions of the article that are answered by the article.
684660	690560	It's just that this piece is really rather long, and he's only read a few sentences of it so far.
690760	695760	So he keeps cutting it off before it gets a chance to answer the questions that he's asking.
696060	703060	And this leads to a couple of funny moments where Sargon cuts it off early to argue its own later point back at it.
703360	705860	For instance, the article contains this text.
706260	711360	Many scientific studies have proven that people generally prefer women's voices over men's.
711360	715460	Most of us find women's voices to be warmer, regardless of our gender,
715460	719960	and we therefore prefer our digital assistants to have women's voices.
720360	723660	But before Sargon gets to that point in the article,
723660	729060	and because he might not expect the author of the article to put something like that in there,
729060	731060	he interrupts it in order to...
731760	732960	Am I gonna say it?
733260	733960	Yes.
733960	735860	Mansplain.
763960	771960	High-pitched noises don't travel as far, which is probably a good thing if you're, you know, in the middle of anywhere,
771960	773960	and you're speaking and it's speaking back to you.
773960	775960	There are lots of good reasons.
775960	780460	And not only that, I remember reading a thing a while ago that people just find women's voices more soothing.
780960	786960	And so, okay, it's not an actual woman's voice. It's an imitation of it.
787460	790960	But anyway, the real reason, go on, let's go on, drum roll.
791960	798460	Siri, Alexana, Alexa, Cortana, and Google Home have women's voices because women's voices make more money.
798460	799960	Because people prefer them.
800460	803460	Yes, Karl, because people prefer them.
803460	807460	It even literally says that currently on the screen.
807960	810460	This situation repeats itself later on.
810960	816460	Debra Harrison, a writer for Cortana, said that at the 2016 Virtual Assistant Summit
816460	820460	a good chunk of the volume of early-on inquiries went into Cortana's sex life.
820960	823960	These are obvious jokes.
826460	833460	You see, this is the issue with the kind of sentence-by-sentence criticism of an article you tend to see on YouTube.
833460	840460	You wind up making a bunch of assumptions at the end of one sentence that are contradicted by the next sentence.
840460	843460	I don't have to bring out this thing again, do I?
843460	848460	Anyway, let's look at one more example of this concerning these two sentences.
848460	851460	Many argue capitalism is inherently sexist,
851460	858460	but capitalism, like any market system, is only sexist because men have oppressed women for centuries.
859460	862460	Many people think this, but the truth is this.
862460	865460	It's a pretty simple rhetorical construction there.
865460	868460	Quite easy to follow, you might imagine.
868460	874460	Now, let's see Karl's take on these sentences, which, apart from being one more instance of him cutting the article off early
874460	876460	to guess at its meaning and get it wrong,
876460	882460	also contains probably the worst defense of capitalism I have ever heard.
883460	884460	Many argue –
884460	894460	...
894460	897460	Many argue that capitalism is inherently sexist.
897460	904460	You can only think that if you think that women are incompetent, or incapable, or somehow inferior to men.
904460	906460	That's the only time you'd ever say that.
906460	909460	If you think women can't compete, then...
909460	912460	Okay, sure, maybe you think capitalism is inherently sexist.
912460	915460	But that's because you have an inherently sexist view of women.
915460	920460	Capitalism, it literally doesn't care.
920460	922460	It doesn't care.
922460	926460	There is nothing about capitalism that gives a shit about your gender whatsoever.
926460	933460	And in fact, many women really benefit from capitalism because women's bodies are attractive and men like to look at them.
933460	940460	And so many women all over the internet, and they have done since the dawn of time, at least since the dawn of fucking markets,
940460	945460	have taken advantage of this fact, using their sexuality as a commodity.
945460	949460	This is something women have done from the beginning of human history.
949460	951460	And it's just life. It's just what happens.
951460	954460	This is not sexist, it is just something they do.
954460	958460	Yeah, that's right, ladies. Capitalism isn't sexist.
958460	963460	And we know this because of the existence of the pornography industry.
963460	970460	You know, there's absolutely nothing stopping you women out there from succeeding under capitalism
970460	975460	because you can just join a campsite and get your tits out for money.
975460	979460	You know, there's nothing sexist about suggesting that, is there?
979460	982460	You know, why would anyone ever not want to do that?
983460	985460	It's easy money, really, isn't it?
986460	994460	So anyway, after talking about this article for more than 20 minutes while somehow still managing to skip over huge sections of it,
994460	996460	Karl reaches the end.
996460	1002460	And despite his previous claims that none of this matters in the slightest, this is where he flips the script.
1002460	1009460	Siri sits in the pockets of hundreds of millions of people worldwide, and millions of Amazon Echoes with Alexa software installed
1009460	1012460	were sold over the 2016 holiday season alone.
1012460	1016460	It's time their parent companies take an active stance against sexism and sexual assault
1016460	1019460	and modify their bots' responses to harassment.
1019460	1022460	See, we have to tell you what to do.
1022460	1028460	It is about power, it is about control, but not about the power and control of what's going on to women or anything like this.
1028460	1031460	These people want power and control over these companies.
1031460	1034460	They want to be taken on as their advisors, this little priestly class.
1034460	1037460	We will teach you how to be ideologically correct.
1037460	1041460	Nah, nah, fuck off. Just go away. Go away.
1041460	1045460	So, after all that, it turns out that this does matter.
1045460	1054460	Not for anything actually in the article, mind you, but because the existence of the article proves an evil, feminist, social justice conspiracy
1054460	1059460	to exert their malevolent, ideological... whatever.
1059460	1063460	This is Carl's basic approach to the majority of the news stories he reads.
1063460	1071460	The content of the story is almost meaningless, but the existence of the story is outrageous.
1071460	1074460	Carl is staunchly apathetic in this regard.
1074460	1079460	What annoys him more than anything else is when someone suggests a change of behaviour.
1079460	1086460	The thing that really annoys him about this article is that the author is suggesting something needs to be done,
1086460	1091460	and that they think someone else is responsible for acting in a certain manner.
1091460	1096460	It's, you can't tell me what to do anymore, Mum, but as a political position.
1096460	1099460	And this is by no means specific to Sargon.
1099460	1106460	It's an attitude held by plenty of people, usually straight white guys who, since they're currently coming out on top of things,
1106460	1112460	figure, well, maybe we shouldn't bother trying to change anything at all. Ever.
1112460	1116460	No, the current setup is just fine, thank you.
1116460	1123460	This is why Carl is so much more offended by feminism and social justice than he is by white nationalism.
1123460	1125460	You know, white nationalists are telling him,
1125460	1129460	hey, you're great, you're already the best the way you are.
1129460	1135460	But the social justice crowd want him to shock horror, change his behaviour,
1135460	1139460	which is certainly a crime worse than any Nazi could cook up.
1139460	1141460	But don't take my word for it.
1141460	1145460	Let's take a look at the ways Carl talks about different people.
1145460	1149460	For instance, here's how he talks about a black woman who made up a hashtag.
1149460	1156460	But there is another thing that separates Lewis from the Laras and Bregolis and Hiltons, well, she's black.
1156460	1159460	I, and Hiltons as well. She's black.
1159460	1163460	I cannot name a person of colour who has created something viral and capitalised off it.
1163460	1170460	Says April Rayne, managing director of Broadway Black and originator of the annually trending Oscar So White.
1172460	1174460	Fucking die.
1175460	1181460	And here's how he talks about a black man who committed the crime of teaching at a university.
1181460	1185460	What Peaches does, what Sweet Brown does, is always viewed as lower class,
1185460	1188460	an example of what all black people must be doing.
1188460	1190460	Who the fuck thinks that?
1190460	1196460	Says, well, Andre Brock, who teaches race, ethnicity and new media at the University of Michigan.
1196460	1198460	Right, here's one for the fucking gas chambers.
1198460	1203460	So that's Sargon talking about what he perceives to be the social justice left.
1203460	1209460	You know, fuck off, fucking die, go to the gas chambers, et cetera.
1209460	1213460	Do we ever see him talking this way about the far right?
1213460	1215460	Well, certainly not in this video at least.
1215460	1221460	At least he's actually busy posting pictures of them on Twitter in order to masturbate to, apparently.
1221460	1229460	Anyway, Carl seems to want to position himself as a centrist between so-called social justice warriors on one side
1229460	1234460	and neo-Nazis on the other, as if they're at all comparable.
1234460	1240460	But he spends the vast majority of his time and energy only complaining about the social justice people
1240460	1243460	while giving the Nazis an easy ride.
1244460	1252460	In fact, he goes so far in this video as to possibly accidentally share a fair amount of white nationalist rhetoric.
1252460	1254460	So let's take a look at some of that.
1254460	1257460	So here's another story that Sargon covers.
1257460	1261460	Riz Ahmed, who's a British actor who was in Rogue One, among other things,
1261460	1267460	gave a speech to Parliament in which he argued for greater diversity on British television.
1267460	1273460	Now, did you Americans ever wonder why there's quite a lot of minority British people on your television and in your movies?
1273460	1277460	Well, that's partly because there aren't really as many roles for them over here.
1277460	1284460	There's a lot of period dramas, but the vast majority of roles in those are obviously for white people.
1284460	1292460	So minority actors often go to America, like Riz Ahmed did, and he criticises exactly this necessity in his speech.
1292460	1293460	And I quote,
1309460	1316460	Now the newspapers, being the newspapers, focused on the most eye-catching part of the speech to put in the headlines.
1316460	1323460	And that's when Ahmed makes the case that terrorist groups like ISIS are targeting propaganda at young Muslims.
1323460	1327460	And he argues the necessity of a counter-narrative to this,
1327460	1332460	saying we need to tell these kids they can be heroes in our stories and that they're valued.
1332460	1341460	Now, of course, since Riz Ahmed is saying something needs to be done, Sargon's not gonna be standing for any of this, obviously.
1341460	1345460	And he blusters his way through the article, misreading it, and getting everything wrong.
1345460	1352460	But what I want to focus on here specifically are the times where Sargon accidentally let slip his true colours.
1352460	1353460	Let's take a look.
1375460	1378460	My mum didn't run down and go, English! On the TV.
1378460	1383460	I wouldn't run downstairs and go, wow, there's an English person on TV. I feel represented.
1383460	1385460	So bizarre.
1388460	1390460	He said he'd run downstairs to watch.
1390460	1395460	I really want you to understand how much that meant to someone who doesn't see themselves reflected back in culture.
1395460	1397460	It's a message that you matter.
1397460	1402460	It's weird, because I watch a lot of American TV shows and movies and whatnot.
1402460	1406460	And at no point do I sit there and think, why don't they have any British people on?
1406460	1409460	Why are all the British people the villains?
1409460	1412460	My goodness, I'm gonna go and join a terrorist organisation.
1412460	1418460	So Carl's coloniser's point there hints at the fact that he doesn't consider Riz Ahmed,
1418460	1423460	or the young minority people he's talking about, to be real British people.
1423460	1429460	And we can tell this because of the two examples he came up with to compare to what Riz Ahmed said.
1429460	1433460	Firstly, he brought up his experience living abroad in Germany,
1433460	1437460	and secondly, his experience of watching American television.
1437460	1442460	You see, Sargon, that's a bad point to start with, because there's tons of British people on American television,
1442460	1445460	including Riz Ahmed, for instance.
1445460	1450460	But, you know, regardless, both of those examples would involve you, as a British man,
1450460	1456460	watching another country's television and then asking it to change to represent you.
1457460	1462460	Neither of those situations are comparable to Riz Ahmed here, who is British.
1462460	1468460	He was born in London, and he's talking about his own country's television.
1468460	1471460	And you're acting like he's some immigrant coloniser.
1471460	1474460	Well, he's not. He's British.
1474460	1480460	He's a Londoner, which is a shame, but he's still British.
1480460	1482460	Sargon, regrettably, doesn't stop here,
1482460	1487460	but picks up on the fact that Ahmed mentions a rise in hate crimes after the Brexit vote,
1487460	1491460	and takes the opportunity, oddly, to downplay it.
1491460	1495460	He said that in the light of the rise in racial and religious hate crimes post-Brexit...
1495460	1497460	Oh, I wish I'd looked this up, actually.
1497460	1499460	And everyone's like, well, you should just pause it and go look it up.
1499460	1502460	And I'm like, you know, I will. Okay, hang on.
1503460	1509460	Right. Hate crimes soared by 41% after the Brexit vote, official figures reveal.
1509460	1511460	So how many is that, exactly?
1511460	1517460	Well, 1,546 racially or religiously aggravated offences were recorded
1517460	1520460	in the two weeks up until including the day of the referendum,
1520460	1524460	but in the fortnight immediately after the poll, it was 2,241.
1524460	1527460	So, not really that many.
1527460	1531460	I mean, you say that's huge, but we've got millions of people
1531460	1534460	interacting all day, every day, all over the country,
1534460	1540460	and out of those millions of interactions, 2,000 of them were quote-unquote hate crimes.
1540460	1542460	And I don't even know what the details of these are,
1542460	1545460	so I don't even know if I would necessarily classify these or anything like that.
1545460	1548460	But let's assume they're all exactly the same.
1548460	1552460	This is not the massive spike that we would be left to believe.
1552460	1556460	If it was like 50,000 or something, I'd be like, okay, that's a real problem.
1556460	1559460	That's a genuine... That's a huge number.
1559460	1566460	2,000 is not very many when you have millions and millions of non-white immigrants into the country.
1566460	1571460	So 2,200 hate crimes isn't that bad, really, apparently.
1571460	1574460	Karl doesn't scroll down here to explain that, and I quote,
1574460	1580460	these included assaults, arson attacks, and dog excrement being thrown at doors and shoved through letterboxes.
1580460	1584460	And there was also a Polish man who was murdered.
1584460	1590460	You know, 2,200. It's not that many, really, is it, in the grand scheme of things?
1590460	1595460	That's a surprisingly pragmatic and relativistic take on those numbers from Karl there.
1595460	1603460	If only more people took this pragmatic and relativistic approach to discussing terror attacks, for instance, eh, Karl?
1603460	1610460	Because compared to the millions and millions of Muslims going about their day-to-day lives without doing any terrorism,
1610460	1615460	the relative few who do engage in terrorism must hardly be worth mentioning.
1615460	1622460	This is happening every day now. Somewhere in Europe, an Islamic terror attack occurs.
1622460	1630460	How long do you think people will put up with this before deciding the problem is simply Muslims?
1630460	1638460	If we pretend that this has nothing to do with Islam, people will stop listening because they know this has something to do with Islam.
1638460	1644460	It obviously has something to do with Islam. I mean, it's always Muslims doing this.
1644460	1651460	They're yelling things like Allahu Akbar, they're looking forward to their virgins in paradise, they pledge allegiance to the Islamic State.
1651460	1656460	It's really hard to convince people that this has got nothing to do with Islam.
1656460	1667460	So we need to start talking about it. In fact, I would expect moderate Muslims to be, I don't know, presumably dobbing in these potential terrorists,
1667460	1672460	saying to the authorities, look, there's a mosque over there where they say some really radical shit.
1672460	1677460	I don't like it because I think a terror attack might come out of it. That's what we need to be seeing.
1677460	1683460	If you're a Muslim in Britain and you abhor terrorist attacks, if you think this is the worst thing a person can do,
1683460	1690460	you need to remain vigilant within your own community. I'm sorry that this is the case.
1690460	1696460	I'm sorry that you have to be the one. But if you don't, people will think that you are complicit.
1696460	1701460	That you do not mind that you are in some way permissive of this.
1701460	1709460	Because I tell you what, if this was English people in my community doing this, you're fucking damn right I would be reporting them to the cops.
1709460	1717460	Note, again, Karl drawing a line between Muslim and English, as if those are mutually exclusive terms there.
1717460	1724460	Anyway, it looks like for hate crimes, Karl doesn't get out of bed for less than 50,000.
1724460	1730460	But terror attacks, well, half a dozen of those, and he's ready to condemn all of Islam for it.
1730460	1735460	Now surprisingly, this is not Karl's worst abuse of statistics in this video,
1735460	1739460	and I'd like to welcome back everyone who skipped ahead at the beginning.
1739460	1741460	Hello to all you lazy folks.
1741460	1747460	Okay, at one point in the video, Karl talks about a news story in The Independent entitled
1747460	1756460	Germany has seen an increase in violence since it opened its doors to refugees due to attacks on refugees.
1756460	1758460	And this article starts out
1777460	1784460	According to the ministry, there were more than 3,500 attacks on refugees and asylum hostels.
1784460	1800460	So that's awful, isn't it? You know, it seems fairly unambiguously condemnable that hate crimes against refugees and asylum hostels should be indefensible, shouldn't they? Karl?
1800460	1808460	But the point is, this is wonderful. Well, not wonderful, obviously, but it's good that they're finally talking about violence and refugees,
1808460	1813460	because now we can start talking about the violence that the refugees are doing to other people, right?
1813460	1817460	So we've got 3,500 attacks on refugees and asylum hostels.
1817460	1826460	This is from the February 21st, 2016, and it's based on a leaked police document, a confidential police report that was leaked.
1827460	1833460	And this just goes to show you exactly who the fuck these people are on the side of.
1833460	1840460	Migrants committed 288,000 crimes in 2015, according to a confidential police report that was leaked to the German newspaper Bild.
1840460	1849460	The figure represents an 80% increase over 2014, and works out to around 570 crimes committed by migrants every day.
1849460	1857460	So, sorry, how was that? Ten attacks a day. Do you see why people are attacking the migrants? Do you see why?
1857460	1862460	You know what? It just pisses me off. It's so fucking one-sided.
1862460	1871460	Now, I don't want to sensationalize this too much, but that series of sentences right there is the single, stupidest thing I have heard someone say on YouTube.
1871460	1877460	Karl was wrong in so many ways in such a short amount of time that it's almost inexplicable.
1877460	1884460	But let's take a crack at it anyway. We'll take a look at the two numbers that Karl just compared there.
1884460	1894460	An average of nearly ten attacks a day were carried out on refugees in Germany last year. Migrants committed 208,000 crimes in 2015.
1894460	1902460	Now then, what's wrong with Sargon comparing these two numbers? Well, what's not wrong with it?
1902460	1912460	Let's start with a basic one. One number is talking about refugees and asylum seekers, and the other number is talking about all migrants.
1912460	1923460	Not all migrants are refugees or asylum seekers. And if you actually read what the German newspaper that leaked the statistics says about them,
1923460	1930460	refugee suspects from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq were actually underrepresented in the crime statistics.
1930460	1939460	For instance, about half of the immigrants in 2015 were refugees from Syria, but Syrians were only 24% of the migrant crime suspects.
1939460	1946460	So Syrian refugees were much less likely than average immigrants to be criminals.
1946460	1950460	And indeed, the organization that compiled the statistics is quoted as saying,
1950460	1955460	the heavily prevailing majority of asylum seekers do not commit crimes.
1956460	1963460	Point two would be that one number is talking specifically about attacks on refugees and asylum hostels.
1963460	1968460	The other number concerns all crime, not just assaults.
1968460	1976460	For instance, it includes 28,712 cases of fare evasion on public transportation.
1976460	1984460	And unlike Sargon, I can't say I'd defend assaulting someone in a hate crime because they didn't pay for their train ticket.
1984460	1992460	My third point would be to remind Sargon that the first number is talking about hate crimes targeted against a specific group of people,
1992460	1994460	and the second number is not.
1994460	1996460	Now, what's the significance of this?
1996460	2002460	Well, not all those immigrant crimes were directed against the native German population, obviously.
2002460	2011460	In the report, the only categories that list the migrant status of the victims of the migrant crimes are murder and attempted murder,
2011460	2015460	of which the overwhelming majority occurred between migrants.
2015460	2023460	For instance, there were 28 migrant murders, and 27 of those were migrants killing other migrants.
2023460	2027460	So that shouldn't matter, really. It's still people killing other people,
2027460	2032460	but if you're gonna use this to justify defending hate crimes against refugees,
2032460	2038460	you should at least try to make sure that their documented crimes are committed against the native population.
2038460	2047460	Sargon is comparing targeted assaults of refugees with every crime committed by any migrant, no matter how minor,
2047460	2051460	and using that as a justification to defend hate crime.
2051460	2055460	And yes, he literally calls this self-defense.
2055460	2059460	But you see, it's not like this is one-sided. It's not like the quote-unquote Nazis are just like,
2059460	2063460	you know what, I just hate brown people. I hate the fact they're here. We need to just attack them.
2063460	2067460	People are operating in what they perceive to be self-defense.
2067460	2071460	Because Sargon can't tell the difference between a refugee and a migrant,
2071460	2078460	and because he can't tell the difference between targeted hate crimes and generalized non-targeted assaults,
2078460	2084460	because he can't read properly, he's ended up spewing racist propaganda.
2084460	2090460	And I would love Sargon, where I am full-on alt-right neo-Nazi type,
2090460	2095460	he's a useful idiot doing the groundwork of legitimizing their racist rhetoric.
2095460	2099460	And I usually try to refrain from moral judgments doing these videos,
2099460	2103460	but I honestly think Sargon should be fucking ashamed of himself for this.
2103460	2105460	He should know better.
2105460	2111460	And if you're gonna defend hate crimes, Carl, at least get your fucking statistics right next time.
2111460	2117460	He didn't even get the years right. One set of numbers was from 2015, and the other was from 2016.
2117460	2120460	So... whatever.
2120460	2124460	I'm sorry about that, everyone. I've calmed down.
2124460	2132460	Now, you know, I get angrier at people who are racist out of ignorance than outright hatred.
2132460	2136460	You know, you sort of expect this shit from actual open racists,
2136460	2143460	but when it's just some fuckwit defending hate crimes because he can't take the time to read properly,
2143460	2148460	well... that really gets my goat.
2149460	2151460	Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.
2152460	2158460	I forgot to record an outro to this video, so I have to do one right now before I post it.
2158460	2162460	Except my neighbors have a small child, and it's past their bedtime right now,
2162460	2165460	and they share a wall with the room I'm in right now.
2166460	2170460	So I have to do my ASMR voice, I'm sorry.
2171460	2176460	So thanks a lot to all of my supporters over on Patreon, who are scrolling by right now.
2177460	2179460	You all know the Patreon plug by now.
2179460	2185460	You go there and send me a dollar, and then I exchange that dollar for goods and services.
2185460	2195460	I'd also like to thank Rune Mian again for translating that German article that leaked those crime statistics for me.
2196460	2198460	Thanks a lot, Rune Mian.
2198460	2204460	You're always very helpful, and everyone watching this right now should go and send you some love on Twitter.
2204460	2209460	Anyway, thanks a lot for watching again, everyone, and I'll see you next time.
