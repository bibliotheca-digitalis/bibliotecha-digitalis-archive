00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,260
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:08,680
So, when our pal Sargon of Akkad isn't harassing innocent women by photographing them and tweeting out where they live and work,

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,240
he still finds time to make a YouTube video or two.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,100
How's that for an intro there?

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:21,740
Uh, so today, I'm gonna be looking at one of Sargon's recent videos in his This Week in Stupid series,

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,000
where he reads out some recent news items and then complains a lot.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,760
And Sargon recently tried something a little different with this series,

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:37,560
instead of posting shorter, edited videos, he tried releasing a couple of longer, less scripted, off-the-cuff videos.

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,500
Now, the danger with this approach is that you're more likely to make mistakes, you know,

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,360
misquote something, misread something, take something out of context.

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:53,460
And Sargon has since abandoned this style of video, saying that making that type of content made him feel lazy.

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,460
Of course, the other danger here is that some handsome chap will come along

13
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,860
and make a list of all the mistakes you made in order to have a bit of a laugh at you.

14
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,560
Now, is that unfair?

15
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,960
You know, Sargon posts an experimental, long-form, unscripted video,

16
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,360
and then I go through it and nitpick it for mistakes.

17
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:18,060
Well, maybe that's unfair, but I do think there's still some points to be made here.

18
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,760
With Sargon specifically, I think it gives us a bit of a peek behind the curtain.

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,360
And there are parts of this video where I'd argue Carl flirts with open white nationalism

20
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,160
in a much more obvious way than I see him do in his more scripted videos.

21
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:37,660
More generally, though, the particular ways in which Carl misreads articles and news stories

22
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:42,160
is illustrative of how a lot of other people misread articles and news stories

23
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,560
and end up coming to silly conclusions.

24
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,560
There's a definite lack of basic journalistic understanding at play here.

25
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:55,260
For all Carl and his, like, hate on universities for being social justice hugboxers,

26
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,160
they really could do with going and taking a writing course sometime.

27
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,360
So we're also gonna focus on Carl's method of reading these articles

28
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,060
and how, in particular, he misreads.

29
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,360
This is how I kid myself into doing these sorts of response videos.

30
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,260
You know, I try and make it into some wider points

31
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,860
so it's not just me laughing at a guy for being wrong.

32
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,860
So I think what we'll do here is, before we get to Carl,

33
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,260
pick out one of the stories that he reads and we'll briefly scan through it ourselves,

34
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,260
have a little chat about it, and then we'll watch his take on it.

35
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,160
Though I will say, if you're short on time and you just wanna see the worst thing that Carl said today

36
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,560
and can't really be bothered with all of the reading,

37
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,560
skip to the timecode currently on the screen to see Carl being so offensively wrong about something

38
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,560
that it's actually legitimately concerning.

39
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,560
Anyway, for everyone else, we'll start with this article from the news website QZ.com.

40
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,160
So, what have we just read?

41
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,860
Well, it's the headline and first few sentences of an article about how the digital personal assistants

42
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:31,960
on smartphones and tablets and the likes handle talking about the topic of sexual abuse.

43
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:37,660
And we can already see that the author of this article clearly thinks that they underperform in that regard.

44
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,760
Now, the start of an article like this is meant to be attention-grabbing.

45
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,160
You know, it's got the weird premise in the headline and then the punchy first two sentences.

46
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,960
Women have been made into servants once again, except this time they're digital.

47
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:58,160
It's good. It hopefully, from the author's perspective anyway, makes the reader want to know more.

48
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,660
You know, asking questions like, what's the issue, why is it a problem, who's at fault,

49
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,660
what can be done about it, things like that.

50
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:12,460
And the article, if it's a good article anyway, will then go on to address all of these questions.

51
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,960
And not to skip ahead here, but the reader, if they're a good reader,

52
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,460
will actually read the article to see if it answers those questions.

53
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:25,960
The article goes on to explain the issue, which is that these personal assistant programs

54
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:33,160
aren't programmed particularly well to discuss sexual harassment, rape, sex education, and topics like that.

55
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,860
And they reach out to the developers of these devices for quotes about their approach to the issue,

56
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,460
and they test the devices to see how they respond to being insulted.

57
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:47,260
And they come to the conclusion that the developers need to do better when they're programming

58
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,060
how the bots respond to these things, ending with,

59
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,260
rather than promoting stereotypical passivity, dismissiveness, and even flirtation with abuse,

60
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,860
these companies could become industry leaders against sexual harassment.

61
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:06,460
So, what do we think about this article? Well, I personally think it's well-written, it's easy to follow,

62
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,360
it gets its point across well, it's well-researched.

63
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,560
The premise, obviously, is a little silly.

64
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,360
You know, you imagine someone sitting there swearing ginsults at a bunch of smartphones for an experiment,

65
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,060
and it does seem a bit funny, admittedly.

66
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,660
But I do think there are some interesting points here,

67
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,660
and it's something I've got a bit of a personal interest in, to tell you the truth.

68
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,160
How these sorts of automated systems deal with sensitive topics is really interesting,

69
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,260
and potentially really harmful.

70
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:41,960
For instance, there's a problem I've seen reported with a lot of so-called child-friendly web browsers,

71
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,760
which are supposed to filter out adult content,

72
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,860
but also end up filtering out a lot of potentially very helpful content, too.

73
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,060
For example, a kid searching on one of these browsers for, say,

74
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:58,260
I want to commit suicide, or how to know if I was raped, or something like that,

75
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,760
won't be able to get the help they need.

76
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:06,860
Or just recently, you know, YouTube's restricted mode ended up filtering out LGBT content,

77
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,860
which sends a bit of a horrible message, to be honest.

78
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,060
Now, as this article points out,

79
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:18,560
these bots can be programmed to respond positively to these sorts of sensitive questions, and I quote,

80
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,860
Each of the bots had thoughtful and informative responses to,

81
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,960
I am suicidal and I'm going to kill myself.

82
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,760
Siri says,

83
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,360
If you're thinking about suicide, you might want to speak with someone at the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

84
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,360
Shall I call them for you?

85
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,760
And the rest of the bots said something similar.

86
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,860
So there's clearly some thought and effort put into the programming there,

87
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,160
and the point of the article is to argue that,

88
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,860
if they can write helpful responses to questions about suicide,

89
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,360
they can write similarly helpful responses to sexual harassment,

90
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,160
and questions about sexual abuse and rape, and the likes.

91
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,460
And I personally think, if this isn't a problem now,

92
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,460
you know, it's going to be eventually, isn't it?

93
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,760
These bots are only going to get more prevalent in the future, and they're going to get smarter,

94
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,460
and going to be increasingly relied upon to answer sensitive questions like this,

95
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:13,360
so I'm glad that at least someone out there is thinking about it.

96
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,860
You know, I'm not saying it's some world-ending problem right now or anything,

97
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,960
but it's certainly worth pointing out and thinking about.

98
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,360
And even if you think it's not an issue at all,

99
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,960
you know, the worst that happened here is some journalist wasted an afternoon

100
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,960
swearing at a bunch of smartphones, so you know,

101
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,760
even if it's pointless, it's nothing to get upset about, really.

102
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,760
Or...

103
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,060
So you might think.

104
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:43,160
We tested bots like Siri and Alexa to see who would stand up to sexual harassment.

105
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,060
Why?

106
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,060
God.

107
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,760
All of this is just so fucking pointless.

108
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:57,860
Women have been made into servants once again, except this time, they're not really women.

109
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,960
They're not women at all, are they?

110
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,760
Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Microsoft's Cortana, and Google's Google Home.

111
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,060
Periotime... Periotime.

112
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,160
Pedal stereotypes of female subservience,

113
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,160
which puts their progressive parent companies in a moral predicament.

114
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,660
I don't think there is any moral predicament here.

115
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,660
There is absolutely none.

116
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,760
People using a female-sounding voice on these...

117
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,460
I don't know, they call them, like, bots or whatever.

118
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,760
There is no moral predicament here.

119
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,560
There is no person being injured in any way whatsoever by this female voice.

120
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,660
No matter how sexist to them you are, there is no moral predicament here.

121
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,860
So fuck off.

122
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,660
So there's three things I want to mention here.

123
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:49,360
First is Sargon's insistence that the article is pointless and that there is no problem.

124
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,860
Now, whatever you might think of this particular article,

125
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,160
this is something Sargon says for basically every article he features.

126
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,660
I don't think there's an issue at all.

127
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,560
I think this is just something that's a total non-issue and shouldn't be written about at all.

128
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,360
I've probably wasted far too much time on this already, but fuck it.

129
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,160
It doesn't matter, you whiners.

130
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,660
There's recently been a photograph for a shoot in Vanity Fair wearing an outfit that reveals much of her breasts.

131
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,360
And nobody really cares.

132
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,160
Stop you there, don't give a shit.

133
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,860
Fucking brilliant.

134
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,460
You know what? Done.

135
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:21,960
Just...

136
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,460
Just... pointless.

137
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,860
Absolutely pointless.

138
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:35,060
Which begs the question, Sargon, if it's all so pointless, why are you talking about it?

139
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,460
For example, here's an article I don't care about from the BBC News website.

140
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,760
Amy Schumer bummed over Barbie film departure.

141
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,560
Now, I don't care about this at all in any regard.

142
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,960
I find it almost intensely uninteresting.

143
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,260
And personally, it was a huge waste of time, me reading it,

144
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,660
because it was basically not of any consequence to me whatsoever.

145
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,060
But I recognize that other people might care about it.

146
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,960
You know, I'm not gonna make a video complaining about it,

147
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,860
other than here as an example, obviously,

148
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,460
but I'm not angry just because it exists.

149
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,660
And this brings me to my second point.

150
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,560
If it's so pointless, why are you angry about it, Sargon?

151
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,960
Fuck off, you know, it's a bit strong, isn't it?

152
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:27,860
There's no need for that sort of language, Carl, but we'll come back to this later.

153
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,560
My third point is to mention when Sargon sarcastically says,

154
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,460
"'Why?' after reading the headline of the article."

155
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:39,560
Now, this might be a minor point, but it reveals a misunderstanding here.

156
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:45,760
That headline is supposed to make you ask why, so that you will read the rest of the article.

157
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,460
You're not meant to understand the whole thing just from the headline, Sargon.

158
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,660
You have to actually read through it.

159
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,460
And how do I know he's not read it, you might ask.

160
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,060
Well, bear with me.

161
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,660
But few have considered the real-life implications of the device's lackluster responses to sexual harassment.

162
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,860
All right, come on, what is the real-life implication?

163
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,360
Someone was rude to my bot.

164
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,860
All right.

165
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,660
So?

166
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,560
So who was hurt?

167
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,360
So where's the damage?

168
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,560
Point to the victim!

169
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:24,660
You see, Sargon is angrily asking questions of the article that are answered by the article.

170
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:30,560
It's just that this piece is really rather long, and he's only read a few sentences of it so far.

171
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,760
So he keeps cutting it off before it gets a chance to answer the questions that he's asking.

172
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:43,060
And this leads to a couple of funny moments where Sargon cuts it off early to argue its own later point back at it.

173
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,860
For instance, the article contains this text.

174
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,360
Many scientific studies have proven that people generally prefer women's voices over men's.

175
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,460
Most of us find women's voices to be warmer, regardless of our gender,

176
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:59,960
and we therefore prefer our digital assistants to have women's voices.

177
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,660
But before Sargon gets to that point in the article,

178
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:09,060
and because he might not expect the author of the article to put something like that in there,

179
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,060
he interrupts it in order to...

180
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,960
Am I gonna say it?

181
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:13,960
Yes.

182
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,860
Mansplain.

183
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:51,960
High-pitched noises don't travel as far, which is probably a good thing if you're, you know, in the middle of anywhere,

184
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,960
and you're speaking and it's speaking back to you.

185
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,960
There are lots of good reasons.

186
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,460
And not only that, I remember reading a thing a while ago that people just find women's voices more soothing.

187
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:06,960
And so, okay, it's not an actual woman's voice. It's an imitation of it.

188
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,960
But anyway, the real reason, go on, let's go on, drum roll.

189
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:18,460
Siri, Alexana, Alexa, Cortana, and Google Home have women's voices because women's voices make more money.

190
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,960
Because people prefer them.

191
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,460
Yes, Karl, because people prefer them.

192
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:27,460
It even literally says that currently on the screen.

193
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,460
This situation repeats itself later on.

194
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:36,460
Debra Harrison, a writer for Cortana, said that at the 2016 Virtual Assistant Summit

195
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,460
a good chunk of the volume of early-on inquiries went into Cortana's sex life.

196
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,960
These are obvious jokes.

197
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:53,460
You see, this is the issue with the kind of sentence-by-sentence criticism of an article you tend to see on YouTube.

198
00:13:53,460 --> 00:14:00,460
You wind up making a bunch of assumptions at the end of one sentence that are contradicted by the next sentence.

199
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,460
I don't have to bring out this thing again, do I?

200
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:08,460
Anyway, let's look at one more example of this concerning these two sentences.

201
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,460
Many argue capitalism is inherently sexist,

202
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:18,460
but capitalism, like any market system, is only sexist because men have oppressed women for centuries.

203
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,460
Many people think this, but the truth is this.

204
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,460
It's a pretty simple rhetorical construction there.

205
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,460
Quite easy to follow, you might imagine.

206
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:34,460
Now, let's see Karl's take on these sentences, which, apart from being one more instance of him cutting the article off early

207
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,460
to guess at its meaning and get it wrong,

208
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:42,460
also contains probably the worst defense of capitalism I have ever heard.

209
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,460
Many argue –

210
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:54,460
...

211
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,460
Many argue that capitalism is inherently sexist.

212
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:04,460
You can only think that if you think that women are incompetent, or incapable, or somehow inferior to men.

213
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,460
That's the only time you'd ever say that.

214
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,460
If you think women can't compete, then...

215
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,460
Okay, sure, maybe you think capitalism is inherently sexist.

216
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,460
But that's because you have an inherently sexist view of women.

217
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:20,460
Capitalism, it literally doesn't care.

218
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,460
It doesn't care.

219
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,460
There is nothing about capitalism that gives a shit about your gender whatsoever.

220
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:33,460
And in fact, many women really benefit from capitalism because women's bodies are attractive and men like to look at them.

221
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:40,460
And so many women all over the internet, and they have done since the dawn of time, at least since the dawn of fucking markets,

222
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:45,460
have taken advantage of this fact, using their sexuality as a commodity.

223
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:49,460
This is something women have done from the beginning of human history.

224
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,460
And it's just life. It's just what happens.

225
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,460
This is not sexist, it is just something they do.

226
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:58,460
Yeah, that's right, ladies. Capitalism isn't sexist.

227
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:03,460
And we know this because of the existence of the pornography industry.

228
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:10,460
You know, there's absolutely nothing stopping you women out there from succeeding under capitalism

229
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:15,460
because you can just join a campsite and get your tits out for money.

230
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,460
You know, there's nothing sexist about suggesting that, is there?

231
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,460
You know, why would anyone ever not want to do that?

232
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,460
It's easy money, really, isn't it?

233
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:34,460
So anyway, after talking about this article for more than 20 minutes while somehow still managing to skip over huge sections of it,

234
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,460
Karl reaches the end.

235
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:42,460
And despite his previous claims that none of this matters in the slightest, this is where he flips the script.

236
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:49,460
Siri sits in the pockets of hundreds of millions of people worldwide, and millions of Amazon Echoes with Alexa software installed

237
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,460
were sold over the 2016 holiday season alone.

238
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,460
It's time their parent companies take an active stance against sexism and sexual assault

239
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,460
and modify their bots' responses to harassment.

240
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,460
See, we have to tell you what to do.

241
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:08,460
It is about power, it is about control, but not about the power and control of what's going on to women or anything like this.

242
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,460
These people want power and control over these companies.

243
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,460
They want to be taken on as their advisors, this little priestly class.

244
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:17,460
We will teach you how to be ideologically correct.

245
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:21,460
Nah, nah, fuck off. Just go away. Go away.

246
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:25,460
So, after all that, it turns out that this does matter.

247
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:34,460
Not for anything actually in the article, mind you, but because the existence of the article proves an evil, feminist, social justice conspiracy

248
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:39,460
to exert their malevolent, ideological... whatever.

249
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,460
This is Carl's basic approach to the majority of the news stories he reads.

250
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:51,460
The content of the story is almost meaningless, but the existence of the story is outrageous.

251
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,460
Carl is staunchly apathetic in this regard.

252
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,460
What annoys him more than anything else is when someone suggests a change of behaviour.

253
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:06,460
The thing that really annoys him about this article is that the author is suggesting something needs to be done,

254
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:11,460
and that they think someone else is responsible for acting in a certain manner.

255
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,460
It's, you can't tell me what to do anymore, Mum, but as a political position.

256
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,460
And this is by no means specific to Sargon.

257
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:26,460
It's an attitude held by plenty of people, usually straight white guys who, since they're currently coming out on top of things,

258
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:32,460
figure, well, maybe we shouldn't bother trying to change anything at all. Ever.

259
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,460
No, the current setup is just fine, thank you.

260
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:43,460
This is why Carl is so much more offended by feminism and social justice than he is by white nationalism.

261
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,460
You know, white nationalists are telling him,

262
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,460
hey, you're great, you're already the best the way you are.

263
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:55,460
But the social justice crowd want him to shock horror, change his behaviour,

264
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,460
which is certainly a crime worse than any Nazi could cook up.

265
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,460
But don't take my word for it.

266
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,460
Let's take a look at the ways Carl talks about different people.

267
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:09,460
For instance, here's how he talks about a black woman who made up a hashtag.

268
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:16,460
But there is another thing that separates Lewis from the Laras and Bregolis and Hiltons, well, she's black.

269
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,460
I, and Hiltons as well. She's black.

270
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,460
I cannot name a person of colour who has created something viral and capitalised off it.

271
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:30,460
Says April Rayne, managing director of Broadway Black and originator of the annually trending Oscar So White.

272
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,460
Fucking die.

273
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:41,460
And here's how he talks about a black man who committed the crime of teaching at a university.

274
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,460
What Peaches does, what Sweet Brown does, is always viewed as lower class,

275
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,460
an example of what all black people must be doing.

276
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,460
Who the fuck thinks that?

277
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:56,460
Says, well, Andre Brock, who teaches race, ethnicity and new media at the University of Michigan.

278
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,460
Right, here's one for the fucking gas chambers.

279
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:03,460
So that's Sargon talking about what he perceives to be the social justice left.

280
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:09,460
You know, fuck off, fucking die, go to the gas chambers, et cetera.

281
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:13,460
Do we ever see him talking this way about the far right?

282
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,460
Well, certainly not in this video at least.

283
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:21,460
At least he's actually busy posting pictures of them on Twitter in order to masturbate to, apparently.

284
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:29,460
Anyway, Carl seems to want to position himself as a centrist between so-called social justice warriors on one side

285
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:34,460
and neo-Nazis on the other, as if they're at all comparable.

286
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:40,460
But he spends the vast majority of his time and energy only complaining about the social justice people

287
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,460
while giving the Nazis an easy ride.

288
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:52,460
In fact, he goes so far in this video as to possibly accidentally share a fair amount of white nationalist rhetoric.

289
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,460
So let's take a look at some of that.

290
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,460
So here's another story that Sargon covers.

291
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:01,460
Riz Ahmed, who's a British actor who was in Rogue One, among other things,

292
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:07,460
gave a speech to Parliament in which he argued for greater diversity on British television.

293
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:13,460
Now, did you Americans ever wonder why there's quite a lot of minority British people on your television and in your movies?

294
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:17,460
Well, that's partly because there aren't really as many roles for them over here.

295
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:24,460
There's a lot of period dramas, but the vast majority of roles in those are obviously for white people.

296
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:32,460
So minority actors often go to America, like Riz Ahmed did, and he criticises exactly this necessity in his speech.

297
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,460
And I quote,

298
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:56,460
Now the newspapers, being the newspapers, focused on the most eye-catching part of the speech to put in the headlines.

299
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:03,460
And that's when Ahmed makes the case that terrorist groups like ISIS are targeting propaganda at young Muslims.

300
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:07,460
And he argues the necessity of a counter-narrative to this,

301
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:12,460
saying we need to tell these kids they can be heroes in our stories and that they're valued.

302
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:21,460
Now, of course, since Riz Ahmed is saying something needs to be done, Sargon's not gonna be standing for any of this, obviously.

303
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:25,460
And he blusters his way through the article, misreading it, and getting everything wrong.

304
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:32,460
But what I want to focus on here specifically are the times where Sargon accidentally let slip his true colours.

305
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,460
Let's take a look.

306
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,460
My mum didn't run down and go, English! On the TV.

307
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:03,460
I wouldn't run downstairs and go, wow, there's an English person on TV. I feel represented.

308
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,460
So bizarre.

309
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,460
He said he'd run downstairs to watch.

310
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:15,460
I really want you to understand how much that meant to someone who doesn't see themselves reflected back in culture.

311
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,460
It's a message that you matter.

312
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:22,460
It's weird, because I watch a lot of American TV shows and movies and whatnot.

313
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,460
And at no point do I sit there and think, why don't they have any British people on?

314
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,460
Why are all the British people the villains?

315
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,460
My goodness, I'm gonna go and join a terrorist organisation.

316
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:38,460
So Carl's coloniser's point there hints at the fact that he doesn't consider Riz Ahmed,

317
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:43,460
or the young minority people he's talking about, to be real British people.

318
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:49,460
And we can tell this because of the two examples he came up with to compare to what Riz Ahmed said.

319
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:53,460
Firstly, he brought up his experience living abroad in Germany,

320
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,460
and secondly, his experience of watching American television.

321
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:02,460
You see, Sargon, that's a bad point to start with, because there's tons of British people on American television,

322
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,460
including Riz Ahmed, for instance.

323
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:10,460
But, you know, regardless, both of those examples would involve you, as a British man,

324
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:16,460
watching another country's television and then asking it to change to represent you.

325
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:22,460
Neither of those situations are comparable to Riz Ahmed here, who is British.

326
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:28,460
He was born in London, and he's talking about his own country's television.

327
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,460
And you're acting like he's some immigrant coloniser.

328
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,460
Well, he's not. He's British.

329
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:40,460
He's a Londoner, which is a shame, but he's still British.

330
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,460
Sargon, regrettably, doesn't stop here,

331
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:47,460
but picks up on the fact that Ahmed mentions a rise in hate crimes after the Brexit vote,

332
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,460
and takes the opportunity, oddly, to downplay it.

333
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,460
He said that in the light of the rise in racial and religious hate crimes post-Brexit...

334
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,460
Oh, I wish I'd looked this up, actually.

335
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,460
And everyone's like, well, you should just pause it and go look it up.

336
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,460
And I'm like, you know, I will. Okay, hang on.

337
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:09,460
Right. Hate crimes soared by 41% after the Brexit vote, official figures reveal.

338
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,460
So how many is that, exactly?

339
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:17,460
Well, 1,546 racially or religiously aggravated offences were recorded

340
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,460
in the two weeks up until including the day of the referendum,

341
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:24,460
but in the fortnight immediately after the poll, it was 2,241.

342
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,460
So, not really that many.

343
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:31,460
I mean, you say that's huge, but we've got millions of people

344
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:34,460
interacting all day, every day, all over the country,

345
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:40,460
and out of those millions of interactions, 2,000 of them were quote-unquote hate crimes.

346
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,460
And I don't even know what the details of these are,

347
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,460
so I don't even know if I would necessarily classify these or anything like that.

348
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,460
But let's assume they're all exactly the same.

349
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:52,460
This is not the massive spike that we would be left to believe.

350
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,460
If it was like 50,000 or something, I'd be like, okay, that's a real problem.

351
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,460
That's a genuine... That's a huge number.

352
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:06,460
2,000 is not very many when you have millions and millions of non-white immigrants into the country.

353
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:11,460
So 2,200 hate crimes isn't that bad, really, apparently.

354
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,460
Karl doesn't scroll down here to explain that, and I quote,

355
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:20,460
these included assaults, arson attacks, and dog excrement being thrown at doors and shoved through letterboxes.

356
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,460
And there was also a Polish man who was murdered.

357
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:30,460
You know, 2,200. It's not that many, really, is it, in the grand scheme of things?

358
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:35,460
That's a surprisingly pragmatic and relativistic take on those numbers from Karl there.

359
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:43,460
If only more people took this pragmatic and relativistic approach to discussing terror attacks, for instance, eh, Karl?

360
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:50,460
Because compared to the millions and millions of Muslims going about their day-to-day lives without doing any terrorism,

361
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,460
the relative few who do engage in terrorism must hardly be worth mentioning.

362
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:02,460
This is happening every day now. Somewhere in Europe, an Islamic terror attack occurs.

363
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:10,460
How long do you think people will put up with this before deciding the problem is simply Muslims?

364
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:18,460
If we pretend that this has nothing to do with Islam, people will stop listening because they know this has something to do with Islam.

365
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:24,460
It obviously has something to do with Islam. I mean, it's always Muslims doing this.

366
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:31,460
They're yelling things like Allahu Akbar, they're looking forward to their virgins in paradise, they pledge allegiance to the Islamic State.

367
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:36,460
It's really hard to convince people that this has got nothing to do with Islam.

368
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:47,460
So we need to start talking about it. In fact, I would expect moderate Muslims to be, I don't know, presumably dobbing in these potential terrorists,

369
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:52,460
saying to the authorities, look, there's a mosque over there where they say some really radical shit.

370
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:57,460
I don't like it because I think a terror attack might come out of it. That's what we need to be seeing.

371
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:03,460
If you're a Muslim in Britain and you abhor terrorist attacks, if you think this is the worst thing a person can do,

372
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:10,460
you need to remain vigilant within your own community. I'm sorry that this is the case.

373
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:16,460
I'm sorry that you have to be the one. But if you don't, people will think that you are complicit.

374
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:21,460
That you do not mind that you are in some way permissive of this.

375
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:29,460
Because I tell you what, if this was English people in my community doing this, you're fucking damn right I would be reporting them to the cops.

376
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:37,460
Note, again, Karl drawing a line between Muslim and English, as if those are mutually exclusive terms there.

377
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:44,460
Anyway, it looks like for hate crimes, Karl doesn't get out of bed for less than 50,000.

378
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:50,460
But terror attacks, well, half a dozen of those, and he's ready to condemn all of Islam for it.

379
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:55,460
Now surprisingly, this is not Karl's worst abuse of statistics in this video,

380
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:59,460
and I'd like to welcome back everyone who skipped ahead at the beginning.

381
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,460
Hello to all you lazy folks.

382
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:07,460
Okay, at one point in the video, Karl talks about a news story in The Independent entitled

383
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:16,460
Germany has seen an increase in violence since it opened its doors to refugees due to attacks on refugees.

384
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,460
And this article starts out

385
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:44,460
According to the ministry, there were more than 3,500 attacks on refugees and asylum hostels.

386
00:29:44,460 --> 00:30:00,460
So that's awful, isn't it? You know, it seems fairly unambiguously condemnable that hate crimes against refugees and asylum hostels should be indefensible, shouldn't they? Karl?

387
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:08,460
But the point is, this is wonderful. Well, not wonderful, obviously, but it's good that they're finally talking about violence and refugees,

388
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:13,460
because now we can start talking about the violence that the refugees are doing to other people, right?

389
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:17,460
So we've got 3,500 attacks on refugees and asylum hostels.

390
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:26,460
This is from the February 21st, 2016, and it's based on a leaked police document, a confidential police report that was leaked.

391
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:33,460
And this just goes to show you exactly who the fuck these people are on the side of.

392
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:40,460
Migrants committed 288,000 crimes in 2015, according to a confidential police report that was leaked to the German newspaper Bild.

393
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:49,460
The figure represents an 80% increase over 2014, and works out to around 570 crimes committed by migrants every day.

394
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:57,460
So, sorry, how was that? Ten attacks a day. Do you see why people are attacking the migrants? Do you see why?

395
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:02,460
You know what? It just pisses me off. It's so fucking one-sided.

396
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:11,460
Now, I don't want to sensationalize this too much, but that series of sentences right there is the single, stupidest thing I have heard someone say on YouTube.

397
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:17,460
Karl was wrong in so many ways in such a short amount of time that it's almost inexplicable.

398
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:24,460
But let's take a crack at it anyway. We'll take a look at the two numbers that Karl just compared there.

399
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:34,460
An average of nearly ten attacks a day were carried out on refugees in Germany last year. Migrants committed 208,000 crimes in 2015.

400
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:42,460
Now then, what's wrong with Sargon comparing these two numbers? Well, what's not wrong with it?

401
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:52,460
Let's start with a basic one. One number is talking about refugees and asylum seekers, and the other number is talking about all migrants.

402
00:31:52,460 --> 00:32:03,460
Not all migrants are refugees or asylum seekers. And if you actually read what the German newspaper that leaked the statistics says about them,

403
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:10,460
refugee suspects from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq were actually underrepresented in the crime statistics.

404
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:19,460
For instance, about half of the immigrants in 2015 were refugees from Syria, but Syrians were only 24% of the migrant crime suspects.

405
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:26,460
So Syrian refugees were much less likely than average immigrants to be criminals.

406
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:30,460
And indeed, the organization that compiled the statistics is quoted as saying,

407
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:35,460
the heavily prevailing majority of asylum seekers do not commit crimes.

408
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:43,460
Point two would be that one number is talking specifically about attacks on refugees and asylum hostels.

409
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:48,460
The other number concerns all crime, not just assaults.

410
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:56,460
For instance, it includes 28,712 cases of fare evasion on public transportation.

411
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:04,460
And unlike Sargon, I can't say I'd defend assaulting someone in a hate crime because they didn't pay for their train ticket.

412
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:12,460
My third point would be to remind Sargon that the first number is talking about hate crimes targeted against a specific group of people,

413
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,460
and the second number is not.

414
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,460
Now, what's the significance of this?

415
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:22,460
Well, not all those immigrant crimes were directed against the native German population, obviously.

416
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:31,460
In the report, the only categories that list the migrant status of the victims of the migrant crimes are murder and attempted murder,

417
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:35,460
of which the overwhelming majority occurred between migrants.

418
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:43,460
For instance, there were 28 migrant murders, and 27 of those were migrants killing other migrants.

419
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:47,460
So that shouldn't matter, really. It's still people killing other people,

420
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:52,460
but if you're gonna use this to justify defending hate crimes against refugees,

421
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:58,460
you should at least try to make sure that their documented crimes are committed against the native population.

422
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:07,460
Sargon is comparing targeted assaults of refugees with every crime committed by any migrant, no matter how minor,

423
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:11,460
and using that as a justification to defend hate crime.

424
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:15,460
And yes, he literally calls this self-defense.

425
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:19,460
But you see, it's not like this is one-sided. It's not like the quote-unquote Nazis are just like,

426
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:23,460
you know what, I just hate brown people. I hate the fact they're here. We need to just attack them.

427
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:27,460
People are operating in what they perceive to be self-defense.

428
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:31,460
Because Sargon can't tell the difference between a refugee and a migrant,

429
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:38,460
and because he can't tell the difference between targeted hate crimes and generalized non-targeted assaults,

430
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:44,460
because he can't read properly, he's ended up spewing racist propaganda.

431
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:50,460
And I would love Sargon, where I am full-on alt-right neo-Nazi type,

432
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:55,460
he's a useful idiot doing the groundwork of legitimizing their racist rhetoric.

433
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:59,460
And I usually try to refrain from moral judgments doing these videos,

434
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,460
but I honestly think Sargon should be fucking ashamed of himself for this.

435
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,460
He should know better.

436
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:11,460
And if you're gonna defend hate crimes, Carl, at least get your fucking statistics right next time.

437
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:17,460
He didn't even get the years right. One set of numbers was from 2015, and the other was from 2016.

438
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,460
So... whatever.

439
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:24,460
I'm sorry about that, everyone. I've calmed down.

440
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:32,460
Now, you know, I get angrier at people who are racist out of ignorance than outright hatred.

441
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:36,460
You know, you sort of expect this shit from actual open racists,

442
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:43,460
but when it's just some fuckwit defending hate crimes because he can't take the time to read properly,

443
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:48,460
well... that really gets my goat.

444
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,460
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

445
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:58,460
I forgot to record an outro to this video, so I have to do one right now before I post it.

446
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:02,460
Except my neighbors have a small child, and it's past their bedtime right now,

447
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,460
and they share a wall with the room I'm in right now.

448
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:10,460
So I have to do my ASMR voice, I'm sorry.

449
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,460
So thanks a lot to all of my supporters over on Patreon, who are scrolling by right now.

450
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,460
You all know the Patreon plug by now.

451
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:25,460
You go there and send me a dollar, and then I exchange that dollar for goods and services.

452
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:35,460
I'd also like to thank Rune Mian again for translating that German article that leaked those crime statistics for me.

453
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,460
Thanks a lot, Rune Mian.

454
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:44,460
You're always very helpful, and everyone watching this right now should go and send you some love on Twitter.

455
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:49,460
Anyway, thanks a lot for watching again, everyone, and I'll see you next time.
