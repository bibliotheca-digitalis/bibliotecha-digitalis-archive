0	6920	Hello everyone, this is just another Q&A video because I hit a hundred thousand subscribers here on YouTube recently
7420	11300	Which is fairly neat. I like it when we hit these milestones
12020	15680	Generally because I like making these Q&A videos to be honest
15680	22200	So thank you to everyone who's subscribed and supported the channel. Here's to... what's the next big
23200	24800	milestone after this?
24840	30960	Here's to 50 million subscribers, how about that? And let's just get right into it, okay
31600	34720	Hi Sean, have you ever tried vanilla Coke?
36080	38080	Yes, I have
38780	43100	Starting with that question. I didn't do any editing on the order of these questions
43100	46480	they're just how I pasted them into the text document here, so
47700	49700	Yes, I have tried vanilla Coke
49960	54480	I'm not going to tell you what I thought of vanilla Coke because that wasn't part of the question
54640	56640	So okay on to the next one
56920	62960	When are we getting our annual CinemaSins video for 2018? Oh, man, those things
63520	69720	Do I really have to do another one of those? I don't... I don't want to. I hate them
70240	77220	It'd involve watching another year's worth of CinemaSins videos. I don't know. People seem to like them though
79680	81480	Possibly
81480	88160	Around December, I'd say around the end of the year if it happens, which right now it probably won't
88640	92280	What thing have you done so far that you're most proud of?
93080	97800	I'll assume you just mean on YouTube here, and it's the Charlottesville video
97800	103400	I think that's the one I spent the most time on and that I think came out the best to be honest
103400	105360	So yeah that one
105360	110400	What's the ideal length for audio takes or do you try to get it all over with in one go?
110400	115520	Well, I answered this in another video, but I tend to record all of my audio in a single go
116520	121840	Just because I'm not very good at it, and if I recorded it at different times, it would sound different
121840	128320	I've never been able to crack that problem really even in an identical audio setup my audio seems to sound different
128320	130960	So I just do it all in one go so there's no
132040	137640	Noticeable cuts so now I try to get the script completely 100% finished before I start
138360	142560	Recording it. Can you hear those banging upstairs? I'm not gonna cut that out today
144000	145400	Yeah, there's another one
145400	153240	It's it's that all the time so on my like regular videos where I don't want to have just random knocks in the background
153240	156920	I have to try and record sentences in between those knocks
157360	162500	It's it's hellish, and they seem to increase when I start recording as well
162580	168980	I think my upstairs neighbors don't like me very much and wait for me to start recording videos, and there's another one
169860	172120	Just start throwing rocks around or something
173060	177700	Seeing as you seem to like Star Wars. What are your thoughts on the prequel trilogy?
177700	184020	Do you like them hate them or have mixed feelings about them? I guess I'd fall under the mixed category here
184620	190920	I don't think they're particularly good movies however. They're not as bad as the internet
191520	193520	Makes out and
194240	197540	some of the things in there are quite interesting like I
198160	199480	I
199480	201840	don't know. I'm one of those people who's like I
202480	205400	I'm happier that the prequels exist than
205840	213920	Sort of free boring movies that just tried to copy the success of the original trilogy by making something like identical
214740	219560	But without the impact you know so I'm happy yeah, I'm happy the prequels exist
220040	225240	And I like the Gungans. I think the Gungans are cool, and I like the podrace as well
225240	227240	I think the podrace is a genuinely good
227960	229360	action scene
229360	230840	So yeah
230840	231960	Sue me
231960	237920	How do you deal with parasocial relationships and then in brackets in which you are not the persona?
238400	245000	So I guess this is me being a fan of someone else then I think you just need to respect
245480	249920	Boundaries really and keep a few things in mind like I have
250560	254180	Creators on YouTube. I really like I have twitch streamers. I really like
255160	260360	but you have to be aware constantly that what you're seeing is just a
261760	268880	Public face really and it's a little bit more of a blurred line than in
269880	277960	Traditional like broadcast television obviously because it's there's no PR people or handlers or editors in between you and them when
277960	279960	They're just like streaming live on Twitch
280400	282440	but you're still seeing a
283800	285560	persona and
285560	287560	Not always the real person
287760	294120	This question reminded me of that video by Shannon Strachey about parasocial relationships
294120	300440	Which I believe she's and making a follow-up to so I'll link that in the description and you should go check that out
300440	307460	I say I believe she's making a follow-up to I know she is she asked me to record a voice climb for it
307840	309840	So I'll be in that one as well
310440	316020	How do you manage to stay so calm and maintain hope when everything seems so grim?
316360	319880	Well, this is a loaded question, isn't it? I don't
320600	327600	Often, you know, actually this ties into the previous question a little which is odd because I didn't intend for it to at all
327640	329640	but yeah, what you're seeing there is
330840	336860	An act if I make a response video the first time I watch through the video
337000	339880	I'm pausing every 10 seconds and swearing and
340640	343760	Furiously scribbling notes and I'm incredibly angry about it all
344320	350320	And then over the creation process by the time it comes out the other side in in the actual
350920	356660	Video that goes up on my channel. It's not that I'm suddenly not angry about racism or
357240	359240	Whatever else I'm talking about
359400	364380	It's that I've decided that that is the best way to present my argument
365520	367520	so it's a
367800	374760	Fiction basically, I'm more often a very angry and moody person to be honest
375240	382740	Next question. Why are anti-feminist anti SJW beliefs so popular? I got asked this a few times in
383480	385200	various forms and
385200	391420	Mainly it's because they're easy. It's very simple to look at sort of complicated
392160	396160	social political economic problems and then just
396960	401660	Blame all of that on a group of other people who are bad
401920	407740	It's sort of a shortcut into feeling superior to other people and all types of people do it
408600	410800	It's just lazy thinking basically
411440	418960	Next question. I really want to make video game reviews and political essays like you and hbomberguy, but I'm terrified. No one will like me
420080	424400	Well, that certainly hasn't stopped hbomberguy. So I'd say just go ahead
427080	429080	That's not very fair
429960	432440	I'd say if you want to do those things
433320	436580	Then you should don't let the fear of not being popular
437520	439000	Stop you
439000	440840	Because you won't be
440840	443400	You definitely won't be when you start out
443400	448600	I made videos for years as I've mentioned before with basically no audience at all
448600	452400	Oh, you know a single or double-digit audience for a very long time
453320	454320	before
454320	455920	like any of my
455960	460200	Videos broke a thousand views. It was like two years or something like that
460720	466600	And but it was still fun. It was still an interesting way to spend my time and I learned a lot doing that
467040	471920	That has helped me out now. So yeah, go ahead. Give it a go
472520	477560	Next question. What are your predictions for the future of the Democrats? Will they move to the left?
477560	484280	Will they be surpassed by a more left-wing party? Will they continue to capitulate to Republicans and be absolutely useless?
484360	486360	That's from Cameron there
487640	491840	Sort of a mix of those I think Democrats as in
493080	498360	The party membership and people who vote for the Democrats will probably move further left
498360	504560	I think the party establishment will continue to capitulate to Republicans and be absolutely useless
504560	508520	I mean the way they're going now, they are going to lose
509480	516680	The next presidential election like how they are right now they it's over already Trump is a two-term president
516680	518680	They have absolutely no chance in hell
519560	524320	That beaten Trump and without a significant shift in a policy here
525600	529000	It's best to think of the of the Democrats
530160	537960	Saying when I say the Democrats, I usually mean at the party establishment in terms of energy as in
538600	542280	They have no energy to do anything. That's why they've latched on to the
542920	549800	Russia thing so much because it doesn't require them to make any promises like they don't have to do anything
550640	555520	They all promise something that they'll fail to deliver on like they know
555800	559400	At least I hope they know that they could win by running on
559840	565480	Things like relief for student debt and universal health care and things like that
565520	569120	They must know that they could win if they did that
570240	572980	But they won't because then they'd have to do it
574360	576400	Or they think they'd have to do it
576400	583160	Anyway, they should learn from the Republicans that you don't have to actually do the things that you promised to do like
583760	590240	Democrats tense and waffling now, but whatever I'm gonna keep going at Democrats and the states tend to try to get everything sorted
590960	593100	Before they decide what they're going to do
593940	597500	Republicans just say what they're going to do and then worry about the
598220	599780	complications later
599780	604220	Like Trump ran on big wall Mexico pays for it
604220	607740	And now there's absolutely no way to do that or make it work
607740	613960	It's a complete waste of time and money and effort and it makes the country look bad and it wouldn't do anything
613960	615960	Even if you did it
616940	618940	But none of that matters
619220	621620	What matters is that he won the election
621620	627300	I feel like they're too addicted to polling which makes them very boring and
627540	634300	unexciting like if you look at universal health care very divisive policy in the United States anyway, not
635300	637060	insensible countries
637060	643980	Yeah, universal health care you get people coming out very strongly in favor of it very strongly against it and the Democrats don't like that
644020	647380	They like things that everyone sort of agrees with
647940	653780	so if you poll for universal health care you get 50-50 split of people being angry or happy about it and
654420	657140	But if you poll for better health care
657620	664340	It turns out everyone likes better health care everyone supports better health care. So they run on that instead
664740	668900	They say oh we're going to work to make health care better for everyone
669460	671460	You're like, but how?
672020	677060	What are you actually going to do like we're going to make it really good
677940	685480	Non specifically that's how you end up with like just like middle-of-the-road rubbish like Obamacare and get it
685480	689700	It's easy to call it that as like someone from a different country where you know
689700	691700	It hasn't saved my life or whatever
691820	697900	But even accounting for all the people who Obamacare has helped it is a rubbish system
697940	702100	It's awful and you just need full universal health coverage in the states
702500	705340	That's it should be the only acceptable position
705340	711560	I mean if I lived in the states, I'd encourage people not to support any Democrat who didn't come out in favor of it
712460	719080	But again, I get that that's very easy for me to say, you know, not living with the consequences of all the other actions
719180	725460	What was the question here? Even I don't know the Democrats are just rubbish as in the party establishment
725500	731100	There's plenty of local-level Democrats who are brilliant and working really hard and doing everything, right?
731540	735460	But it feels like if they want to get anything done anytime soon
735700	742420	They're just gonna have to go through the party leadership somehow. I don't know how they are gonna do that
742820	745060	but that should be on the agenda of
745740	752080	More left-leaning Democrats now. It's okay. How do we get these people out of the party? How do we go around them?
752400	757520	Next question, do you know how artists eventually begin to regret old works that they made?
757760	761780	Does that happen to you and how long does it take to kick in if it does?
762360	763680	about
763680	765680	45 seconds usually
766720	771160	Yes, I've got old videos I've taken down because I'm not happy with them anymore
771920	776000	Around the time I started getting popular on YouTube was when I started making
776800	778600	videos about
778600	780600	anti-feminists and alt-right figures and such
781480	784280	And when I set about doing that it wasn't
785560	793120	for some social justice cause particularly it wasn't because I was worried about the reach or
794040	802040	Corrupting influence of these people or anything and it was because I thought that they were really pompous and it would be funny to annoy them
802720	806980	So the way I went about making videos was totally different to how I do it now
807420	814860	Like now I am actually concerned about those things and I actually do make videos about ideas and arguments
814860	816260	Or at least I hope I do
816260	818860	But back then I was just trying to piss people off really
819620	825420	So I've been taking those videos offline now because I'm not happy with them and it's not something
825420	828660	I like being out there and representing me
829140	833580	So yes, basically I tend to go off things that I make
834460	839320	Next question. Is there any possible way for you to make more videos faster?
840180	844340	Yes, I could do that, but I haven't been
845140	846940	for a few reasons
846940	852860	One thing is I've been thinking of changing maybe to monthly payments on a patreon
853620	857700	Because some ideas I have are like I could make a video about that
858060	862440	But there isn't really enough in it to justify me spending the time
863020	867020	Making it if I'm not gonna feel comfortable charging for it
867020	872380	and with a like a lighter video if I made something like 10 minutes or something or
873180	878340	Anything that was substantially either shorter or like more off-the-cuff
879340	880540	I
880540	885220	Wouldn't feel comfortable charging for that charging an audience for that who were used to
885580	891500	You know a different sort of thing so I just tend not to do those ideas instead
891500	895780	I'm like, well, I can't really justify the time investment if I'm not gonna get paid for it, but
896460	898460	So it just ends up not being made
898740	900740	but if I went to monthly
901100	905360	Then I could sort of I'd feel more loose about what I could make then
905440	910620	So that's something I'm gonna be thinking about in the next few months. If I did that it would probably be
911140	912100	around
912100	914100	Christmas this year I
914220	918660	Think I might go over to monthly. I'm not sure I'll think about it
918660	922980	And do you have any plans to change your format and introduce more visuals?
923700	927340	Not really. I wanted to initially but
928380	932820	Similar to the last question, you know, this seems to be fairly popular what I'm doing right now
933220	939580	A lot of people have messaged me to say they treat them sort of as podcasts and I've started writing them
939820	943500	More and more such that they make sense without the visuals as well
943500	946820	I still put visuals in because I think they enhance it
947300	952100	Make things clearer and such and you have to refer to a visual every now and then in the script
952700	954700	but I try to do as much of it as
955740	958060	Understandable just by listening to the audio
958620	964700	So I don't have any plans to change the format right now if I changed formats at all, it would be
965900	970260	On completely new content that wasn't related to what I was currently doing
970900	974820	So my sort of monthly videos will continue to be the same sort of thing
975460	977460	For the foreseeable future anyway
977860	983660	Next question. Why are so many right-wingers into Warhammer? Well, because it's a bunch of
984540	988700	Militaristic fascist states just clashing into each other constantly
989940	991940	And they love all that shit
993300	995900	Basically, I think Warhammer doesn't have
996540	1002580	Like everything's horrible in Warhammer, there's no faction you can point to and say they're the good guys
1002580	1005800	You know, they're the people who are trying to get it done. Well
1006420	1009480	Like everyone is just a different flavor of horrible
1011060	1012900	So there's no
1012900	1014260	sort of
1014260	1021100	Space within the universe to sort of openly criticize these like horrible societies
1021940	1025060	Next question. Why aren't conservatives funny?
1026740	1028740	And it's interesting this
1028820	1031620	It's all relative. Of course. I mean lots of people do think
1032340	1034340	Conservatives are funny for whatever reason
1035580	1037580	but with
1037780	1041020	Comedy you need both the person that like
1041720	1045900	Attempting to be funny and you need the audience as well. Like you need to consider their
1046780	1049500	Reaction and their understanding and what they're bringing to it
1050060	1054620	No one can be funny in a vacuum without an audience really
1055100	1062820	Playing to conservative audiences you have much less material and fewer places you can go
1063660	1069180	because if you you know, very loose characterizations of liberal and conservative thought
1070580	1072580	conservatives favor
1072700	1074780	tradition things staying the same
1076220	1081180	They don't like change. They like everyone being one way one type of thing
1081980	1089020	And that just sort of naturally restricts your available material because you can't go outside that
1089540	1092460	relatively narrow world view whereas
1093420	1099100	On the left you have a lot more spaces you can go basically also and again
1099100	1103060	This is just my opinion comedy works best when you're punching up
1104100	1107580	And conservatives really don't like punching up at all
1108580	1114340	Next question, how's brexit treating you? Well, it's an absolute disaster, isn't it?
1114340	1117380	I don't think there's anyone who thinks it's going well
1118140	1123580	Yeah, it's terrible. It's I thought about stockpiling food the other day
1124900	1126220	imagine that
1126220	1127840	like in
1127840	1129840	the UK like
1130420	1132220	ostensibly a
1132220	1135740	first world developed wealthy nation
1136540	1137740	I'm
1137740	1139100	thinking about
1139100	1145700	Stockpiling food for an upcoming disaster next question. What do you think of Jeremy Corbyn?
1146500	1147920	I
1147920	1149920	Don't know yet
1150700	1152700	on the one hand I really like
1153900	1157360	Corbyn for but well, he's a left-winger, isn't he?
1158060	1163740	Which is great. It's excellent to have an actual leftist at the head of the Labour Party
1164500	1168200	Which should you know, you'd imagine it be a requirement
1169420	1177420	To be the head of the again ostensibly left-wing Labour Party, but it's not so it's very good that he's in there
1177420	1182460	I hope he is able to transform the party to be more in line with
1183220	1189240	Like its original intent than what Tony Blair and co turned it into
1190000	1197620	Now the reason I am unsure about Corbyn is I'm not sure what he's going to do with regards to
1198480	1200560	the whole brexit
1200560	1201920	disaster I
1201920	1208680	Was completely not on board with how labor were handling the whole brexit thing until fairly recently. I've come around on it, but
1209280	1210360	see
1210360	1215140	What I wanted them to do was to immediately come out guns blazing
1215460	1218340	Trying to shut it down offering a second referendum
1219260	1222340	Doing everything in their power to stop it
1223060	1226580	And seeing them just sit on the sidelines was a bit frustrating
1227740	1230100	But I've changed my mind now. I
1231200	1236340	feel like brexit is such a disaster and so terrible that
1237740	1242780	It sort of needs to land squarely on the Tories like that
1242780	1250060	It needs to be marked down in the history books as the Tories did this and it was a complete disaster. I
1250700	1252700	Feel like giving them an out
1253020	1257020	Like if Corbyn came out tomorrow and said we'll do a second referendum
1257980	1262220	One it would be very risky because a lot of Labour voters voted leave
1263780	1266820	Secondly the Tories would immediately pivot
1267540	1269540	from infighting and
1269740	1271740	destroying themselves and resigning
1271860	1273300	to
1273300	1275300	immediately blaming everything on labor
1275900	1279180	They would say I can't believe labor is
1279700	1282860	Disrupting these negotiations which were going so well
1283180	1289580	They it was perfect until labor came along and ruined it all and the very
1289860	1295340	Compliant media would swallow it completely. They would say labor are backstabbers
1295940	1300740	Hurting our country at this crucial point in the negotiations, which were going wonderfully
1302400	1304400	So now I'm sort of on board
1305060	1309660	With labor just sitting on their hands and saying well, you know get on with it
1311740	1313740	However, that's
1314140	1320620	Introduced like an element of uncertainty now, like I'm not sure what Corbyn would do if he was just handed power tomorrow
1321580	1327700	so it makes it kind of hard for me to throw my full like unqualified support behind him because
1328340	1329580	his
1329580	1335940	Attitude towards like this big crucial question about the future of our country is just sort of a question mark to me right now
1337660	1342920	So it remains to be seen basically, I hope he's as good as he could be
1343740	1348540	Next question. How has YouTube fame affected your opinion of yourself?
1350060	1354580	It hasn't really and I wouldn't I'm not YouTube famous am I I
1355580	1357580	Don't think so, I'm like one
1358420	1363060	600th of a PewDiePie like it's you know, it's all relative and
1363740	1365740	because I I
1365980	1373260	Don't often appear in videos or on camera like even when I'm streaming like it's a rare thing. I don't get recognized
1374060	1377900	So it's not really affected my opinion of myself all that much at least
1377900	1382020	I hope it hasn't it's hard to tell when these things are happening to you. Well
1382900	1389320	One thing I've noticed with a lot of the anti-feminist youtubers that get quite big they start thinking that they are
1390260	1392260	geniuses just because they have
1392660	1395580	Thousands of people telling them that they're geniuses all the time
1395940	1400780	So I always have to remind myself when anyone says oh, you're really good or whatever
1400780	1406240	I always challenge it in my head. I'm like dad. You don't know what you're talking about. I'm actually
1406840	1408360	Complete rubbish
1408360	1415000	Next question. Hey Shawn just for your 100k Q&A video who are some of your favorite YouTube channels?
1415000	1419080	Always looking for new folks to watch. Thanks. That's from Nick's fears there
1419800	1426360	Well one particular channel that I'd like to give a big shout out to is a Nick's fears
1426360	1432800	I don't know if you've heard of them question asker, but they make very good videos about movies
1433200	1437080	I'll put a link in the description. So everyone should head over there and subscribe
1437280	1442360	It's absolutely criminal that my channel is at 100k subscribers
1442760	1448420	Before Nick's fears as so go and correct that injustice, please everyone
1449200	1452260	as for other YouTube channels, I
1453480	1454760	mentioned
1454760	1461320	Shannon Strouchy on Strouchy movies earlier. I hope I'm pronouncing your surname. Okay there Shannon
1462320	1469260	Mainly you could just look at my subscription list on YouTube. I think that's available to be seen if it's not
1470360	1473280	It's not I think it is though
1475120	1481920	Besides all the other big leftist youtubers, which I imagine most people know, you know, if you watch me, you you know contrapoints
1481920	1483920	You know hbomberguy
1484320	1485600	Probably
1485600	1491160	Things that I just watch personally in my own time. I always feel weird giving a plug to
1491320	1493000	like I watch
1493000	1496040	Panon Coec 2012's Mario videos
1496680	1504040	The whole bunch but that's cuz I just find that really interesting and I wouldn't do other people like watching that stuff
1504040	1507580	I don't know. Well, they make very good videos about Mario 64
1508440	1509440	I
1509440	1511440	like novel 87s
1511960	1518460	Warcraft lore videos because I'm a big nerd and I actually care about the lore of world of warcraft
1518620	1523980	If you can believe it I am one of the four people I
1524860	1526180	think
1526180	1529400	None of who work at Blizzard who actually care about the law
1531080	1536820	So, yeah, just check my subscription list basically if it's available if not, I
1537340	1543060	Should do like I'll do like a Twitter thread of a bunch of channels. I think are really good
1543620	1548360	Remind me to do that if I don't do that like within a day of this video being posted
1548760	1554220	Someone just poked me on Twitter and I'll do it. I'm using my audience like you'd use Siri or something
1556660	1563860	Next question have you explored your gender identity much any interesting findings? Yes, and no
1565860	1568880	Yes, I thought about gender a lot I have
1569640	1572960	Trans pals, you know, I have non-binary pals
1574680	1576680	Gay pals and so on
1577100	1582220	So it's something I do I talk about and think about a fair amount but personally
1583400	1584600	I'm
1584600	1589440	Comfortable with how I'm seen to be yeah, which I've always considered myself
1590320	1596640	Quite lucky. What should I say that? I don't know. I feel bad. I feel like it's giving into a world that
1597240	1598480	Sort of
1598480	1599440	oppresses
1599440	1606040	Minorities to say oh, I'm glad I'm not a minority because I don't I wouldn't want to deal with the like oppression and assholes
1606040	1609680	Making me feel bad all the time. I guess I need to qualify that I
1610440	1617160	Feel glad I'm not because I wouldn't want to deal with the discrimination and not because I think there's anything
1618480	1625120	You know inherently bad about identifying as any of those things. There we go. I thought I figured that out live
1625240	1628440	There we go live for process everyone
1629000	1634840	Next question you've mentioned before people who are a bit overbearing in your fan base who demand you denounce
1634840	1637600	They saw that person or speak on a certain issue
1638000	1644840	Is there any particular way you deal with that now if I'd edited these into a proper list? I would have put this earlier with the
1646440	1648040	With the
1648040	1653320	parasocial relationships one, but yes something I've struggled with is people
1654320	1656320	Seeing the brand
1657800	1663520	Instead of you know me as a person as in if I don't speak about one particular issue
1664280	1671480	That means I am deliberately avoiding it instead of you know I was at Tesco and
1672200	1673920	Didn't see it
1673920	1680720	You know I don't think people literally think I'm like a corporation or something with you know
1681280	1683280	handlers and
1683920	1687480	secretary and things and I'm aware of everything but I
1688080	1694440	Feel like they sort of carry that mindset over like once you reach a certain size on the internet
1694680	1697160	people start treating you like that anyway, and
1698340	1704560	You know I can have a bad day and not want to get into a big internet argument about something I
1705360	1707360	remember a point where
1708320	1712880	Some Twitter personality had done something very bad that I disagreed with
1713560	1718000	And people were asking me to call them out about it
1718800	1721800	But just that particular day. I was feeling very down and
1722760	1729400	About something in my personal life a family issue and didn't really feel like getting into a big
1730280	1731400	argument
1731400	1732560	with
1732560	1734560	someone on Twitter you know and
1735080	1738520	That can suck. It's like you don't get days off
1739160	1746080	From it and in a sense you know usually I'm happy to try and use my audience for productive things like that, but it's
1746920	1751000	It doesn't feel like it's a choice a lot of the time it feels like
1751560	1758040	You have to do that or you just lose some people forever like I've a lot of people on the left
1758400	1762040	Particularly people in minority groups like so used to being betrayed
1763000	1765600	Quotes well, I guess not air quotes, maybe
1766520	1768520	The semi quotes
1770520	1775160	By like online figures and stuff that you only really get one chance with a lot of people
1775240	1780400	So if you don't speak on this or that issue you're cancelled forever of course
1781400	1785000	so the way I deal with that is to just assume that
1786080	1789520	If it wasn't this thing it would be another thing fairly soon
1790100	1792480	You can't keep everyone on board forever
1792480	1795480	You're always gonna have some people who disagree with the way you do things
1796520	1799960	So I just rationalize it like that. You know people are free to
1800880	1802880	Decide they don't like me
1803080	1804480	Yeah
1804480	1810440	Next question what you use to organize or plan video research is it just a text document or what?
1810800	1819160	Usually I just use a text document occasionally if I have anything that I'd like anyone else to check out for me I use
1820040	1823000	Like a Google Drive to just upload it
1823880	1827960	When I made the Charlottesville video I had to print out a whole bunch of maps
1828640	1831560	And notes to like keep it all organized. So
1832400	1834400	my
1834560	1836560	Room looked a bit like
1837160	1839840	Seen from the wire or something, you know
1842120	1848040	A whole bunch of maps with notes and little sticky notes stuck all over them. That was fun
1848040	1851060	You know, I hope I never have to make another video about that topic
1852080	1855240	But I liked the process of actually putting the video together
1855920	1862220	Next question. How is your vegetarian diet going? It was going well until a couple of days ago
1863200	1866120	Where I've I've temporarily put it on hold. I
1866800	1870360	Need to take another run at it in a little while. I
1871280	1873760	decided to go vegetarian a few months ago and
1874760	1882920	Did so successfully I didn't eat any meat for like months apart from my cheese at once with a fish
1884680	1886680	Sounds weird. I
1887400	1889400	Never got cravings for meat at all
1889600	1893140	Even though it was like mainly what I ate until then except for fish
1893140	1897880	I got fish cravings and I don't even particularly like fish very much. So that was
1898680	1904760	That was interesting, but I didn't put enough preparation into thinking about how to go vegetarian. So instead of
1905880	1911280	Coming up with vegetarian meals and stuff to fill in for the meat. I was cutting out
1911280	1918240	I just ate more of the non meat things that I like that were in my diet, which isn't good for you. Really? So
1918840	1920440	I've
1920440	1924640	Been feeling not too great on the old vegetarian diet
1925560	1930320	And so I've had to put a pin in it for now and my I'm eating meat again
1930320	1935560	But my goal is to go vegetarian and stick with it. So I'm going to
1936520	1938520	spend a little while
1939080	1942880	experimenting with different food and trying to come up with it like a
1943920	1946980	menu of foods that I can eat from that sort of
1947600	1949040	ensures that I
1949040	1950440	Like actually
1950440	1953840	nutritionally get everything that I need I'm gonna try and make it a
1954560	1956560	process instead of just like a
1956920	1964600	Immediate thing, you know next question. Why is it so hot? I'm dying. I feel my melted brain leaking out my ears and
1965600	1972960	Me too. I mean especially when I mean I'm recording audio right now, so I can't have my fan on because it sounds like this
1973960	1979680	And I can't have the window open because then you can hear everything that's happening outside
1981200	1985000	So I'm sitting in a hot little room being really hot
1986440	1993720	It's the worst I hate heat waves where is just cold all year round I want I'm thinking about moving
1995240	1997240	Probably next year. I'm gonna move
1998200	2003000	Somewhere else and a big part of me deciding where to move is
2003680	2008240	Somewhere where it's colder than it is here because I really like the cold. I
2008880	2013240	Don't like heat at all. It makes me feel terrible and it's just hot all the time
2013240	2019960	Now this it was a heat wave a while ago and now it's just like oh, this is just the weather in the country now
2020480	2026880	It's terrible and it's hot everywhere else. There's a heat wave in Japan right now. There's some horrible
2027400	2029000	fire and grease
2029000	2031400	God the world's burning
2032160	2034160	It's this dreadful
2034880	2041440	Next question. How do you go about refuting people who make their arguments by simply pointing out a true fact while obviously
2042120	2049360	insinuating some bad political opinion with the fact so folks who are very coy about their true beliefs and sort of
2049960	2051960	Talk around it. I suppose
2052400	2056900	I just fill in the gaps that they won't for instance
2057960	2060200	you know you get some people who are
2061320	2062880	racist and who
2062880	2068120	Hate black people and think black people are genetically inferior and they want to spread that message
2068120	2074040	But they know they can't say that upfront because they'll just look like a racist and they'll get banned off whatever platform
2074040	2076040	they're using so what they do is just
2076720	2082600	List off all the other reasons why black people might not do as well economically or whatever and
2083240	2085960	Then dismiss them they have a list of reasons
2085960	2090200	It could be and they just cross out everything except for the genetic argument
2090200	2094760	And then just leave it hanging there and trust the audience to make the leap for themselves
2096280	2102320	So what I do is just step in and force it to go to that position by
2103500	2105500	Claiming that is what they believe
2105860	2107860	deliberately heavy air quotes
2108860	2110860	misrepresenting their position
2111940	2113940	Because that forces them to
2114100	2121740	Clarify by saying they do or do not believe and then you've sort of neutered the tactic there because you've taken it to a place
2122380	2126720	Where they didn't want to go because they were deliberately avoiding it
2127020	2132940	It's something I've done in videos before if someone's being very coy about what they actually believe
2132940	2139480	I just pick a position for them and say that's what they believe because then it makes them say I don't believe that
2139900	2141900	It's something I've had success with
2142060	2148980	For instance with Stefan Molyneux like I have previously claimed Stefan Molyneux thinks women are inferior
2149500	2156460	Which he does, but he'd never admit to so I just like make the claim for him, and then that splits his audience
2156460	2158740	I've posted comments before that are like
2159220	2165620	One Stefan Molyneux fan being like he's never said he hates women that would be a ludicrous thing to say you're
2166020	2171900	Misrepresenting him and then the next comment is like he's right to hate women. They're weak and inferior. You know
2172820	2179660	Next question I noticed that sometimes in your response videos you play a lot of clips from the source and other times like in recent
2179660	2185500	Videos you don't is it about the time it takes to make a video editing wise or is it to do with the content?
2185500	2186700	You'd be quoting from them
2186700	2192540	Do you ever have misgivings about including clips of people saying slurs and hateful things and the impact it might have on your audience?
2193340	2199140	Yes, this is something I think about quite a lot, and I've definitely been experimenting more with
2200820	2203220	Just not including clips
2204220	2206940	Of other people talking when it's not
2207940	2213420	actually necessary and just summarizing their arguments for them and trusting my audience to
2213820	2217460	Go and view the original video if they doubt me there
2220460	2225440	Partially because I don't like spreading that content around even if I'm responding to it
2225440	2230520	You know like I don't like making people listen to black pigeon speaks for instance
2231060	2232500	so I've been
2232500	2238380	It's not anything to do with the video editing time because it's no time at all really to just drop clips
2238700	2245140	It probably takes more time to write and record me summarizing their arguments than to just put their clips in
2246260	2250260	But it's something I've been moving away from I used to get a lot comments like oh
2250260	2256940	I struggle to watch Sean's videos because he puts in long clips of like Molyneux or whoever
2258500	2262100	So yeah, I'm attempting to do it without for now
2262460	2264580	But who knows I might change my mind later
2264940	2271020	Next question your frog riddle argument relies on the assumption that the rate at which male frogs croak is
2271300	2274740	independent of the sexes of the other frogs as well as other factors
2275180	2278980	Since croaking is a social act closely tied to mating behavior
2278980	2284240	This assumption is dubious and either way cannot be a third from the information present in the riddle
2284660	2289940	There's no valid basis to assume that two male frogs are twice as likely to croak as one male frog
2290220	2294140	Rendering your argument invalid to summarize this as a question
2294140	2300140	Do you concede that the correct answer to the frog riddle given only the information presented therein is two thirds?
2301940	2303940	This again, right
2304420	2306420	No, I don't agree. I
2307180	2312780	Think that if we start making assumptions about the croaking such as it's tied to mating behavior
2313460	2318180	Then the croaking would actually increase if it was a male-female pair
2318220	2321180	It would be more likely to occur than if it were two males
2321860	2325860	Because they wouldn't be croaking at each other. It wouldn't be two-thirds
2325860	2327860	It would actually be some other value
2328220	2333860	The problem here is that if you make the assumption that two male frogs are not
2334180	2338820	More likely than one male frog to make a croak over a given period
2339540	2341800	Then you have to explain why that is
2342800	2343960	And
2343960	2351320	The answer will invariably be something that makes the outcome of the riddle not be a fixed value
2351640	2358180	Anymore because it's information that we don't have like saying something like, you know frogs croak
2358720	2361500	when they're mating for instance
2362560	2363840	or
2363840	2370000	Saying two male frogs won't croak when they're in close proximity, which you know, maybe that's true
2370680	2374200	So two male frogs will be less likely to croak than one male frog
2375920	2379700	But that makes it the answer to the riddle not be two-thirds, doesn't it?
2380260	2385680	because it's if one you hear one frog croak, then you know that the other one is a female if
2386200	2389600	You say that two male frogs will croak around other male frogs
2389600	2397140	But not twice as likely then you have to account for why the fact that only one would croak and there just isn't the information
2397140	2399300	In the riddle, basically, it's not a good riddle
2399740	2404020	It's explained poorly. I was right. The riddle was wrong
2404400	2410540	You're all gonna have to wait for the inevitable hbomberguy video about the frog riddle that he's been threatening to make for a while
2411500	2413500	What's your favorite biscuit?
2414020	2416900	I'm partial to some ginger nuts actually
2417940	2426500	Next question. What's your computer setup CPU GPU etc. Can you hear that plane? I live right next to the airport. It's terrible
2427100	2433580	I have a 1080 TI an i7 8700 K 16 gigs of RAM
2434260	2436520	and a bunch of solid-state hard drives
2437460	2444420	Which is neat. I have a fairly good computer on the whole. I need it for streaming to be honest streaming's
2444820	2448180	Difficult it really taxes everything. I
2450080	2453500	Feel like there needs to be some sort of nah, they wouldn't make it good
2453500	2457340	I was thinking they should sell like they I don't know who they are either
2457860	2460540	They should sell like a streaming rig
2461380	2463380	specifically designed to stream games
2464380	2466380	instead of sort of forcing
2466580	2473200	You know one CPU to do the rendering of the game and the streaming of the game at the same time
2473620	2477540	the next question is who is the best fictional detective and
2478260	2483980	My question is why is this a question because it's obviously Columbo
2484740	2488840	Columbo is by far and away the best fictional detective. He's brilliant
2489360	2495600	The next question is are you planning on doing more videos like the problem with privatizing the railways?
2497120	2502820	Yes, I am I have a couple more of those plans and I said at the start of the year that I'd like to make more
2502820	2504500	videos like that
2504500	2506500	But things just keep getting in the way
2506820	2509700	They take quite a long time to research those ones
2509700	2516420	I still I'm going to make those videos, but it's just when I get around to them. Basically. I've got one about
2517480	2521780	Schools in the works and then one about health. That's
2522300	2526300	That's just like a skeleton plan for now, but the school one is pretty far along
2526300	2531620	I could do that like next month really if I wanted to maybe I will I don't know
2531620	2536020	I've learned not to make predictions about when my videos are gonna come out anymore
2536980	2542500	because invariably something gets in the way or I change my mind like a month later or
2543340	2545340	some terrible
2545720	2548580	Technical problem happens that pushes the release date back
2549080	2552920	Never listen to me if I say a video is going to be out by a particular date
2553380	2556500	It almost certainly won't be next question
2556500	2562540	I want to know what is your opinion about people of the upper class who support the ideas of the left?
2562540	2568140	I ask because I'm from the upper class. My parents have given me many opportunities in life
2568140	2575000	Which does not mean that I believe these opportunities were deserved and I feel conflicted about my support for the abolishment of inheritance
2575580	2580700	Because even if I'm completely in favor of it if my inheritance disappeared, I don't know what I'd do
2581380	2586980	On the other hand, I think that if there was a certainty that I would not die of hunger or cold in the future
2586980	2589420	I would not mind at all what happens to my parents money
2590300	2592660	Yes, well you nailed it at the end there
2592660	2599860	I think this is an example of a situation in which when we say we support something we need to clarify our
2600060	2605700	Sort of broader political goals as well because if you say I support
2606260	2611780	Abolishing inheritance and then nothing else a lot of people are gonna be very put off by that obviously
2611780	2616220	But if it didn't matter if inheritance was abolished because no one would ever
2616740	2620920	Want for a place to stay or food or heating or such?
2621180	2625020	Then people would be a lot more on board with it for a lot of these sorts of issues
2625100	2631400	It's better to explain your full world view and how your opinion on the particular issue fits into it
2631560	2637880	Rather than just saying, you know, I support abolishing inheritance and that's it similarly with
2638640	2644380	Saying you want to abolish private property. I mean if you just say that in isolation a lot of people assume
2645480	2651400	You mean you want to come to their house and steal their car and their pets and things like that
2652000	2657920	Which obviously isn't how it works. So I guess what I'm saying is we should push for the full package really
2658200	2664000	Hey Sean, this is a pretty stupid question, but I plan to move to the UK at some point in my life soon
2664080	2669300	Would you advise against it and you'll have any suggestions for a cheap but good place to live?
2670840	2672840	Wow, okay, I
2673880	2678640	would advise waiting for now and seeing how brexit turns out it's
2680520	2685040	Right now we're looking at the quotes hard brexit
2685040	2688120	Which means the whole country is going to explode
2689840	2697320	If you do if you have to move here for whatever horrible reason I would look at places in
2698000	2699040	maybe
2699040	2704760	Wales or Scotland and not England and if you do have to live in England
2704760	2708580	I would probably suggest somewhere outside of London
2709840	2712080	Just because it's so expensive there, you know
2712560	2716600	Either way best of luck to you. You're gonna need it
2717680	2721140	Next question. Do you tend to get more enjoyment from multiplayer?
2721680	2728480	systems driven games where you spend many hours perfecting your play or from games that take you through a story or adventure once and then
2728480	2729720	You're done with it
2729720	2733600	Well, I'm very boring here and don't really have a preference. I
2734280	2737260	Like plenty of games that fall into both of those categories
2737900	2743260	And what I think makes the game good or bad in this regard is if it knows exactly what it is and
2745180	2751220	Like the worst of both worlds here is a game that should be a short story driven thing
2751620	2752700	but
2752700	2755260	unnecessarily tacks on a bunch of like
2756220	2758220	customization level up
2758420	2760420	grindy nonsense
2760420	2763700	In order to slow the whole game down and just pad the runtime
2764220	2768980	So I can like either of these I just like them when they're well designed
2769580	2775300	For what they are. So I guess what I'm saying is is I like good video games and not bad ones
2775580	2782140	That's my brave opinion for today. Next question. Is the voice you use in your videos your real voice?
2783940	2785380	Mostly I
2785380	2787880	Guess I don't put on an accent or anything
2788800	2794480	But in most of my videos I'm reading from my prepared script I'm not in this one
2794480	2796480	which is why I'm umming and ahhing and
2797120	2804080	Speaking slower than you might be used to hearing me. But mostly yeah, I sound like this IRL I suppose
2804640	2807340	next question who is Jen and
2807960	2812980	I still get asked this quite a lot. I took Jen's name off the YouTube channel and everything
2813180	2819780	I still get asked who Jen is like all the time and it's so easy to find out but people keep asking me it
2819780	2824900	So actually I'm gonna throw this one over to Jen. Hello. I'm Jen
2824900	2828660	I am NOT a body pillow or a hand. I am Sean's friend
2828660	2834220	I am NOT in the YouTube videos anymore except for this one because nobody believes I am real
2834460	2838980	If you like me, you should watch our regular live streams on our twitch channel
2839140	2842820	Twitch.tv slash Sean and Jen, okay
2844220	2849580	So there we go. That was Jen why she chose to read that out. Like I forced her to at gunpoint
2849580	2852220	I don't know. So thanks for that Jen
2853260	2859700	Yeah, okay folks. That's all for me today. Thanks a lot as always for watching and subscribing all
2861100	2865100	100,000 of you that is rather scary, isn't it?
2866820	2868620	Yes
2869140	2871140	100,000 people
2871580	2873580	Wow, let's get to a million
2874180	2878260	Then then I'll really be scared when we get to a million Wow ten times
2878260	2880260	So it took me like a couple years to get here
2880420	2883460	So it's gonna take me a couple of decades to get to a million
2884140	2887140	Assuming like steady growth like it has been going Wow
2888300	2890300	So I'll be like 50
2891080	2895500	Let's see if I can get to a million subscribers before I'm 50
2896060	2901980	Will I still be doing this when I'm 50 I I don't know if I'm happy about that or not actually I
2902820	2905840	Mean, I like doing it, but am I gonna like doing this when I'm 50?
2906740	2911900	This is the conversations I have with myself off microphone. Okay
2913300	2915860	Thanks a lot folks. I'll see you next time
