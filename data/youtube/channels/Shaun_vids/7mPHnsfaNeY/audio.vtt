00:00.000 --> 00:06.920
Hello everyone, this is just another Q&A video because I hit a hundred thousand subscribers here on YouTube recently

00:07.420 --> 00:11.300
Which is fairly neat. I like it when we hit these milestones

00:12.020 --> 00:15.680
Generally because I like making these Q&A videos to be honest

00:15.680 --> 00:22.200
So thank you to everyone who's subscribed and supported the channel. Here's to... what's the next big

00:23.200 --> 00:24.800
milestone after this?

00:24.840 --> 00:30.960
Here's to 50 million subscribers, how about that? And let's just get right into it, okay

00:31.600 --> 00:34.720
Hi Sean, have you ever tried vanilla Coke?

00:36.080 --> 00:38.080
Yes, I have

00:38.780 --> 00:43.100
Starting with that question. I didn't do any editing on the order of these questions

00:43.100 --> 00:46.480
they're just how I pasted them into the text document here, so

00:47.700 --> 00:49.700
Yes, I have tried vanilla Coke

00:49.960 --> 00:54.480
I'm not going to tell you what I thought of vanilla Coke because that wasn't part of the question

00:54.640 --> 00:56.640
So okay on to the next one

00:56.920 --> 01:02.960
When are we getting our annual CinemaSins video for 2018? Oh, man, those things

01:03.520 --> 01:09.720
Do I really have to do another one of those? I don't... I don't want to. I hate them

01:10.240 --> 01:17.220
It'd involve watching another year's worth of CinemaSins videos. I don't know. People seem to like them though

01:19.680 --> 01:21.480
Possibly

01:21.480 --> 01:28.160
Around December, I'd say around the end of the year if it happens, which right now it probably won't

01:28.640 --> 01:32.280
What thing have you done so far that you're most proud of?

01:33.080 --> 01:37.800
I'll assume you just mean on YouTube here, and it's the Charlottesville video

01:37.800 --> 01:43.400
I think that's the one I spent the most time on and that I think came out the best to be honest

01:43.400 --> 01:45.360
So yeah that one

01:45.360 --> 01:50.400
What's the ideal length for audio takes or do you try to get it all over with in one go?

01:50.400 --> 01:55.520
Well, I answered this in another video, but I tend to record all of my audio in a single go

01:56.520 --> 02:01.840
Just because I'm not very good at it, and if I recorded it at different times, it would sound different

02:01.840 --> 02:08.320
I've never been able to crack that problem really even in an identical audio setup my audio seems to sound different

02:08.320 --> 02:10.960
So I just do it all in one go so there's no

02:12.040 --> 02:17.640
Noticeable cuts so now I try to get the script completely 100% finished before I start

02:18.360 --> 02:22.560
Recording it. Can you hear those banging upstairs? I'm not gonna cut that out today

02:24.000 --> 02:25.400
Yeah, there's another one

02:25.400 --> 02:33.240
It's it's that all the time so on my like regular videos where I don't want to have just random knocks in the background

02:33.240 --> 02:36.920
I have to try and record sentences in between those knocks

02:37.360 --> 02:42.500
It's it's hellish, and they seem to increase when I start recording as well

02:42.580 --> 02:48.980
I think my upstairs neighbors don't like me very much and wait for me to start recording videos, and there's another one

02:49.860 --> 02:52.120
Just start throwing rocks around or something

02:53.060 --> 02:57.700
Seeing as you seem to like Star Wars. What are your thoughts on the prequel trilogy?

02:57.700 --> 03:04.020
Do you like them hate them or have mixed feelings about them? I guess I'd fall under the mixed category here

03:04.620 --> 03:10.920
I don't think they're particularly good movies however. They're not as bad as the internet

03:11.520 --> 03:13.520
Makes out and

03:14.240 --> 03:17.540
some of the things in there are quite interesting like I

03:18.160 --> 03:19.480
I

03:19.480 --> 03:21.840
don't know. I'm one of those people who's like I

03:22.480 --> 03:25.400
I'm happier that the prequels exist than

03:25.840 --> 03:33.920
Sort of free boring movies that just tried to copy the success of the original trilogy by making something like identical

03:34.740 --> 03:39.560
But without the impact you know so I'm happy yeah, I'm happy the prequels exist

03:40.040 --> 03:45.240
And I like the Gungans. I think the Gungans are cool, and I like the podrace as well

03:45.240 --> 03:47.240
I think the podrace is a genuinely good

03:47.960 --> 03:49.360
action scene

03:49.360 --> 03:50.840
So yeah

03:50.840 --> 03:51.960
Sue me

03:51.960 --> 03:57.920
How do you deal with parasocial relationships and then in brackets in which you are not the persona?

03:58.400 --> 04:05.000
So I guess this is me being a fan of someone else then I think you just need to respect

04:05.480 --> 04:09.920
Boundaries really and keep a few things in mind like I have

04:10.560 --> 04:14.180
Creators on YouTube. I really like I have twitch streamers. I really like

04:15.160 --> 04:20.360
but you have to be aware constantly that what you're seeing is just a

04:21.760 --> 04:28.880
Public face really and it's a little bit more of a blurred line than in

04:29.880 --> 04:37.960
Traditional like broadcast television obviously because it's there's no PR people or handlers or editors in between you and them when

04:37.960 --> 04:39.960
They're just like streaming live on Twitch

04:40.400 --> 04:42.440
but you're still seeing a

04:43.800 --> 04:45.560
persona and

04:45.560 --> 04:47.560
Not always the real person

04:47.760 --> 04:54.120
This question reminded me of that video by Shannon Strachey about parasocial relationships

04:54.120 --> 05:00.440
Which I believe she's and making a follow-up to so I'll link that in the description and you should go check that out

05:00.440 --> 05:07.460
I say I believe she's making a follow-up to I know she is she asked me to record a voice climb for it

05:07.840 --> 05:09.840
So I'll be in that one as well

05:10.440 --> 05:16.020
How do you manage to stay so calm and maintain hope when everything seems so grim?

05:16.360 --> 05:19.880
Well, this is a loaded question, isn't it? I don't

05:20.600 --> 05:27.600
Often, you know, actually this ties into the previous question a little which is odd because I didn't intend for it to at all

05:27.640 --> 05:29.640
but yeah, what you're seeing there is

05:30.840 --> 05:36.860
An act if I make a response video the first time I watch through the video

05:37.000 --> 05:39.880
I'm pausing every 10 seconds and swearing and

05:40.640 --> 05:43.760
Furiously scribbling notes and I'm incredibly angry about it all

05:44.320 --> 05:50.320
And then over the creation process by the time it comes out the other side in in the actual

05:50.920 --> 05:56.660
Video that goes up on my channel. It's not that I'm suddenly not angry about racism or

05:57.240 --> 05:59.240
Whatever else I'm talking about

05:59.400 --> 06:04.380
It's that I've decided that that is the best way to present my argument

06:05.520 --> 06:07.520
so it's a

06:07.800 --> 06:14.760
Fiction basically, I'm more often a very angry and moody person to be honest

06:15.240 --> 06:22.740
Next question. Why are anti-feminist anti SJW beliefs so popular? I got asked this a few times in

06:23.480 --> 06:25.200
various forms and

06:25.200 --> 06:31.420
Mainly it's because they're easy. It's very simple to look at sort of complicated

06:32.160 --> 06:36.160
social political economic problems and then just

06:36.960 --> 06:41.660
Blame all of that on a group of other people who are bad

06:41.920 --> 06:47.740
It's sort of a shortcut into feeling superior to other people and all types of people do it

06:48.600 --> 06:50.800
It's just lazy thinking basically

06:51.440 --> 06:58.960
Next question. I really want to make video game reviews and political essays like you and hbomberguy, but I'm terrified. No one will like me

07:00.080 --> 07:04.400
Well, that certainly hasn't stopped hbomberguy. So I'd say just go ahead

07:07.080 --> 07:09.080
That's not very fair

07:09.960 --> 07:12.440
I'd say if you want to do those things

07:13.320 --> 07:16.580
Then you should don't let the fear of not being popular

07:17.520 --> 07:19.000
Stop you

07:19.000 --> 07:20.840
Because you won't be

07:20.840 --> 07:23.400
You definitely won't be when you start out

07:23.400 --> 07:28.600
I made videos for years as I've mentioned before with basically no audience at all

07:28.600 --> 07:32.400
Oh, you know a single or double-digit audience for a very long time

07:33.320 --> 07:34.320
before

07:34.320 --> 07:35.920
like any of my

07:35.960 --> 07:40.200
Videos broke a thousand views. It was like two years or something like that

07:40.720 --> 07:46.600
And but it was still fun. It was still an interesting way to spend my time and I learned a lot doing that

07:47.040 --> 07:51.920
That has helped me out now. So yeah, go ahead. Give it a go

07:52.520 --> 07:57.560
Next question. What are your predictions for the future of the Democrats? Will they move to the left?

07:57.560 --> 08:04.280
Will they be surpassed by a more left-wing party? Will they continue to capitulate to Republicans and be absolutely useless?

08:04.360 --> 08:06.360
That's from Cameron there

08:07.640 --> 08:11.840
Sort of a mix of those I think Democrats as in

08:13.080 --> 08:18.360
The party membership and people who vote for the Democrats will probably move further left

08:18.360 --> 08:24.560
I think the party establishment will continue to capitulate to Republicans and be absolutely useless

08:24.560 --> 08:28.520
I mean the way they're going now, they are going to lose

08:29.480 --> 08:36.680
The next presidential election like how they are right now they it's over already Trump is a two-term president

08:36.680 --> 08:38.680
They have absolutely no chance in hell

08:39.560 --> 08:44.320
That beaten Trump and without a significant shift in a policy here

08:45.600 --> 08:49.000
It's best to think of the of the Democrats

08:50.160 --> 08:57.960
Saying when I say the Democrats, I usually mean at the party establishment in terms of energy as in

08:58.600 --> 09:02.280
They have no energy to do anything. That's why they've latched on to the

09:02.920 --> 09:09.800
Russia thing so much because it doesn't require them to make any promises like they don't have to do anything

09:10.640 --> 09:15.520
They all promise something that they'll fail to deliver on like they know

09:15.800 --> 09:19.400
At least I hope they know that they could win by running on

09:19.840 --> 09:25.480
Things like relief for student debt and universal health care and things like that

09:25.520 --> 09:29.120
They must know that they could win if they did that

09:30.240 --> 09:32.980
But they won't because then they'd have to do it

09:34.360 --> 09:36.400
Or they think they'd have to do it

09:36.400 --> 09:43.160
Anyway, they should learn from the Republicans that you don't have to actually do the things that you promised to do like

09:43.760 --> 09:50.240
Democrats tense and waffling now, but whatever I'm gonna keep going at Democrats and the states tend to try to get everything sorted

09:50.960 --> 09:53.100
Before they decide what they're going to do

09:53.940 --> 09:57.500
Republicans just say what they're going to do and then worry about the

09:58.220 --> 09:59.780
complications later

09:59.780 --> 10:04.220
Like Trump ran on big wall Mexico pays for it

10:04.220 --> 10:07.740
And now there's absolutely no way to do that or make it work

10:07.740 --> 10:13.960
It's a complete waste of time and money and effort and it makes the country look bad and it wouldn't do anything

10:13.960 --> 10:15.960
Even if you did it

10:16.940 --> 10:18.940
But none of that matters

10:19.220 --> 10:21.620
What matters is that he won the election

10:21.620 --> 10:27.300
I feel like they're too addicted to polling which makes them very boring and

10:27.540 --> 10:34.300
unexciting like if you look at universal health care very divisive policy in the United States anyway, not

10:35.300 --> 10:37.060
insensible countries

10:37.060 --> 10:43.980
Yeah, universal health care you get people coming out very strongly in favor of it very strongly against it and the Democrats don't like that

10:44.020 --> 10:47.380
They like things that everyone sort of agrees with

10:47.940 --> 10:53.780
so if you poll for universal health care you get 50-50 split of people being angry or happy about it and

10:54.420 --> 10:57.140
But if you poll for better health care

10:57.620 --> 11:04.340
It turns out everyone likes better health care everyone supports better health care. So they run on that instead

11:04.740 --> 11:08.900
They say oh we're going to work to make health care better for everyone

11:09.460 --> 11:11.460
You're like, but how?

11:12.020 --> 11:17.060
What are you actually going to do like we're going to make it really good

11:17.940 --> 11:25.480
Non specifically that's how you end up with like just like middle-of-the-road rubbish like Obamacare and get it

11:25.480 --> 11:29.700
It's easy to call it that as like someone from a different country where you know

11:29.700 --> 11:31.700
It hasn't saved my life or whatever

11:31.820 --> 11:37.900
But even accounting for all the people who Obamacare has helped it is a rubbish system

11:37.940 --> 11:42.100
It's awful and you just need full universal health coverage in the states

11:42.500 --> 11:45.340
That's it should be the only acceptable position

11:45.340 --> 11:51.560
I mean if I lived in the states, I'd encourage people not to support any Democrat who didn't come out in favor of it

11:52.460 --> 11:59.080
But again, I get that that's very easy for me to say, you know, not living with the consequences of all the other actions

11:59.180 --> 12:05.460
What was the question here? Even I don't know the Democrats are just rubbish as in the party establishment

12:05.500 --> 12:11.100
There's plenty of local-level Democrats who are brilliant and working really hard and doing everything, right?

12:11.540 --> 12:15.460
But it feels like if they want to get anything done anytime soon

12:15.700 --> 12:22.420
They're just gonna have to go through the party leadership somehow. I don't know how they are gonna do that

12:22.820 --> 12:25.060
but that should be on the agenda of

12:25.740 --> 12:32.080
More left-leaning Democrats now. It's okay. How do we get these people out of the party? How do we go around them?

12:32.400 --> 12:37.520
Next question, do you know how artists eventually begin to regret old works that they made?

12:37.760 --> 12:41.780
Does that happen to you and how long does it take to kick in if it does?

12:42.360 --> 12:43.680
about

12:43.680 --> 12:45.680
45 seconds usually

12:46.720 --> 12:51.160
Yes, I've got old videos I've taken down because I'm not happy with them anymore

12:51.920 --> 12:56.000
Around the time I started getting popular on YouTube was when I started making

12:56.800 --> 12:58.600
videos about

12:58.600 --> 13:00.600
anti-feminists and alt-right figures and such

13:01.480 --> 13:04.280
And when I set about doing that it wasn't

13:05.560 --> 13:13.120
for some social justice cause particularly it wasn't because I was worried about the reach or

13:14.040 --> 13:22.040
Corrupting influence of these people or anything and it was because I thought that they were really pompous and it would be funny to annoy them

13:22.720 --> 13:26.980
So the way I went about making videos was totally different to how I do it now

13:27.420 --> 13:34.860
Like now I am actually concerned about those things and I actually do make videos about ideas and arguments

13:34.860 --> 13:36.260
Or at least I hope I do

13:36.260 --> 13:38.860
But back then I was just trying to piss people off really

13:39.620 --> 13:45.420
So I've been taking those videos offline now because I'm not happy with them and it's not something

13:45.420 --> 13:48.660
I like being out there and representing me

13:49.140 --> 13:53.580
So yes, basically I tend to go off things that I make

13:54.460 --> 13:59.320
Next question. Is there any possible way for you to make more videos faster?

14:00.180 --> 14:04.340
Yes, I could do that, but I haven't been

14:05.140 --> 14:06.940
for a few reasons

14:06.940 --> 14:12.860
One thing is I've been thinking of changing maybe to monthly payments on a patreon

14:13.620 --> 14:17.700
Because some ideas I have are like I could make a video about that

14:18.060 --> 14:22.440
But there isn't really enough in it to justify me spending the time

14:23.020 --> 14:27.020
Making it if I'm not gonna feel comfortable charging for it

14:27.020 --> 14:32.380
and with a like a lighter video if I made something like 10 minutes or something or

14:33.180 --> 14:38.340
Anything that was substantially either shorter or like more off-the-cuff

14:39.340 --> 14:40.540
I

14:40.540 --> 14:45.220
Wouldn't feel comfortable charging for that charging an audience for that who were used to

14:45.580 --> 14:51.500
You know a different sort of thing so I just tend not to do those ideas instead

14:51.500 --> 14:55.780
I'm like, well, I can't really justify the time investment if I'm not gonna get paid for it, but

14:56.460 --> 14:58.460
So it just ends up not being made

14:58.740 --> 15:00.740
but if I went to monthly

15:01.100 --> 15:05.360
Then I could sort of I'd feel more loose about what I could make then

15:05.440 --> 15:10.620
So that's something I'm gonna be thinking about in the next few months. If I did that it would probably be

15:11.140 --> 15:12.100
around

15:12.100 --> 15:14.100
Christmas this year I

15:14.220 --> 15:18.660
Think I might go over to monthly. I'm not sure I'll think about it

15:18.660 --> 15:22.980
And do you have any plans to change your format and introduce more visuals?

15:23.700 --> 15:27.340
Not really. I wanted to initially but

15:28.380 --> 15:32.820
Similar to the last question, you know, this seems to be fairly popular what I'm doing right now

15:33.220 --> 15:39.580
A lot of people have messaged me to say they treat them sort of as podcasts and I've started writing them

15:39.820 --> 15:43.500
More and more such that they make sense without the visuals as well

15:43.500 --> 15:46.820
I still put visuals in because I think they enhance it

15:47.300 --> 15:52.100
Make things clearer and such and you have to refer to a visual every now and then in the script

15:52.700 --> 15:54.700
but I try to do as much of it as

15:55.740 --> 15:58.060
Understandable just by listening to the audio

15:58.620 --> 16:04.700
So I don't have any plans to change the format right now if I changed formats at all, it would be

16:05.900 --> 16:10.260
On completely new content that wasn't related to what I was currently doing

16:10.900 --> 16:14.820
So my sort of monthly videos will continue to be the same sort of thing

16:15.460 --> 16:17.460
For the foreseeable future anyway

16:17.860 --> 16:23.660
Next question. Why are so many right-wingers into Warhammer? Well, because it's a bunch of

16:24.540 --> 16:28.700
Militaristic fascist states just clashing into each other constantly

16:29.940 --> 16:31.940
And they love all that shit

16:33.300 --> 16:35.900
Basically, I think Warhammer doesn't have

16:36.540 --> 16:42.580
Like everything's horrible in Warhammer, there's no faction you can point to and say they're the good guys

16:42.580 --> 16:45.800
You know, they're the people who are trying to get it done. Well

16:46.420 --> 16:49.480
Like everyone is just a different flavor of horrible

16:51.060 --> 16:52.900
So there's no

16:52.900 --> 16:54.260
sort of

16:54.260 --> 17:01.100
Space within the universe to sort of openly criticize these like horrible societies

17:01.940 --> 17:05.060
Next question. Why aren't conservatives funny?

17:06.740 --> 17:08.740
And it's interesting this

17:08.820 --> 17:11.620
It's all relative. Of course. I mean lots of people do think

17:12.340 --> 17:14.340
Conservatives are funny for whatever reason

17:15.580 --> 17:17.580
but with

17:17.780 --> 17:21.020
Comedy you need both the person that like

17:21.720 --> 17:25.900
Attempting to be funny and you need the audience as well. Like you need to consider their

17:26.780 --> 17:29.500
Reaction and their understanding and what they're bringing to it

17:30.060 --> 17:34.620
No one can be funny in a vacuum without an audience really

17:35.100 --> 17:42.820
Playing to conservative audiences you have much less material and fewer places you can go

17:43.660 --> 17:49.180
because if you you know, very loose characterizations of liberal and conservative thought

17:50.580 --> 17:52.580
conservatives favor

17:52.700 --> 17:54.780
tradition things staying the same

17:56.220 --> 18:01.180
They don't like change. They like everyone being one way one type of thing

18:01.980 --> 18:09.020
And that just sort of naturally restricts your available material because you can't go outside that

18:09.540 --> 18:12.460
relatively narrow world view whereas

18:13.420 --> 18:19.100
On the left you have a lot more spaces you can go basically also and again

18:19.100 --> 18:23.060
This is just my opinion comedy works best when you're punching up

18:24.100 --> 18:27.580
And conservatives really don't like punching up at all

18:28.580 --> 18:34.340
Next question, how's brexit treating you? Well, it's an absolute disaster, isn't it?

18:34.340 --> 18:37.380
I don't think there's anyone who thinks it's going well

18:38.140 --> 18:43.580
Yeah, it's terrible. It's I thought about stockpiling food the other day

18:44.900 --> 18:46.220
imagine that

18:46.220 --> 18:47.840
like in

18:47.840 --> 18:49.840
the UK like

18:50.420 --> 18:52.220
ostensibly a

18:52.220 --> 18:55.740
first world developed wealthy nation

18:56.540 --> 18:57.740
I'm

18:57.740 --> 18:59.100
thinking about

18:59.100 --> 19:05.700
Stockpiling food for an upcoming disaster next question. What do you think of Jeremy Corbyn?

19:06.500 --> 19:07.920
I

19:07.920 --> 19:09.920
Don't know yet

19:10.700 --> 19:12.700
on the one hand I really like

19:13.900 --> 19:17.360
Corbyn for but well, he's a left-winger, isn't he?

19:18.060 --> 19:23.740
Which is great. It's excellent to have an actual leftist at the head of the Labour Party

19:24.500 --> 19:28.200
Which should you know, you'd imagine it be a requirement

19:29.420 --> 19:37.420
To be the head of the again ostensibly left-wing Labour Party, but it's not so it's very good that he's in there

19:37.420 --> 19:42.460
I hope he is able to transform the party to be more in line with

19:43.220 --> 19:49.240
Like its original intent than what Tony Blair and co turned it into

19:50.000 --> 19:57.620
Now the reason I am unsure about Corbyn is I'm not sure what he's going to do with regards to

19:58.480 --> 20:00.560
the whole brexit

20:00.560 --> 20:01.920
disaster I

20:01.920 --> 20:08.680
Was completely not on board with how labor were handling the whole brexit thing until fairly recently. I've come around on it, but

20:09.280 --> 20:10.360
see

20:10.360 --> 20:15.140
What I wanted them to do was to immediately come out guns blazing

20:15.460 --> 20:18.340
Trying to shut it down offering a second referendum

20:19.260 --> 20:22.340
Doing everything in their power to stop it

20:23.060 --> 20:26.580
And seeing them just sit on the sidelines was a bit frustrating

20:27.740 --> 20:30.100
But I've changed my mind now. I

20:31.200 --> 20:36.340
feel like brexit is such a disaster and so terrible that

20:37.740 --> 20:42.780
It sort of needs to land squarely on the Tories like that

20:42.780 --> 20:50.060
It needs to be marked down in the history books as the Tories did this and it was a complete disaster. I

20:50.700 --> 20:52.700
Feel like giving them an out

20:53.020 --> 20:57.020
Like if Corbyn came out tomorrow and said we'll do a second referendum

20:57.980 --> 21:02.220
One it would be very risky because a lot of Labour voters voted leave

21:03.780 --> 21:06.820
Secondly the Tories would immediately pivot

21:07.540 --> 21:09.540
from infighting and

21:09.740 --> 21:11.740
destroying themselves and resigning

21:11.860 --> 21:13.300
to

21:13.300 --> 21:15.300
immediately blaming everything on labor

21:15.900 --> 21:19.180
They would say I can't believe labor is

21:19.700 --> 21:22.860
Disrupting these negotiations which were going so well

21:23.180 --> 21:29.580
They it was perfect until labor came along and ruined it all and the very

21:29.860 --> 21:35.340
Compliant media would swallow it completely. They would say labor are backstabbers

21:35.940 --> 21:40.740
Hurting our country at this crucial point in the negotiations, which were going wonderfully

21:42.400 --> 21:44.400
So now I'm sort of on board

21:45.060 --> 21:49.660
With labor just sitting on their hands and saying well, you know get on with it

21:51.740 --> 21:53.740
However, that's

21:54.140 --> 22:00.620
Introduced like an element of uncertainty now, like I'm not sure what Corbyn would do if he was just handed power tomorrow

22:01.580 --> 22:07.700
so it makes it kind of hard for me to throw my full like unqualified support behind him because

22:08.340 --> 22:09.580
his

22:09.580 --> 22:15.940
Attitude towards like this big crucial question about the future of our country is just sort of a question mark to me right now

22:17.660 --> 22:22.920
So it remains to be seen basically, I hope he's as good as he could be

22:23.740 --> 22:28.540
Next question. How has YouTube fame affected your opinion of yourself?

22:30.060 --> 22:34.580
It hasn't really and I wouldn't I'm not YouTube famous am I I

22:35.580 --> 22:37.580
Don't think so, I'm like one

22:38.420 --> 22:43.060
600th of a PewDiePie like it's you know, it's all relative and

22:43.740 --> 22:45.740
because I I

22:45.980 --> 22:53.260
Don't often appear in videos or on camera like even when I'm streaming like it's a rare thing. I don't get recognized

22:54.060 --> 22:57.900
So it's not really affected my opinion of myself all that much at least

22:57.900 --> 23:02.020
I hope it hasn't it's hard to tell when these things are happening to you. Well

23:02.900 --> 23:09.320
One thing I've noticed with a lot of the anti-feminist youtubers that get quite big they start thinking that they are

23:10.260 --> 23:12.260
geniuses just because they have

23:12.660 --> 23:15.580
Thousands of people telling them that they're geniuses all the time

23:15.940 --> 23:20.780
So I always have to remind myself when anyone says oh, you're really good or whatever

23:20.780 --> 23:26.240
I always challenge it in my head. I'm like dad. You don't know what you're talking about. I'm actually

23:26.840 --> 23:28.360
Complete rubbish

23:28.360 --> 23:35.000
Next question. Hey Shawn just for your 100k Q&A video who are some of your favorite YouTube channels?

23:35.000 --> 23:39.080
Always looking for new folks to watch. Thanks. That's from Nick's fears there

23:39.800 --> 23:46.360
Well one particular channel that I'd like to give a big shout out to is a Nick's fears

23:46.360 --> 23:52.800
I don't know if you've heard of them question asker, but they make very good videos about movies

23:53.200 --> 23:57.080
I'll put a link in the description. So everyone should head over there and subscribe

23:57.280 --> 24:02.360
It's absolutely criminal that my channel is at 100k subscribers

24:02.760 --> 24:08.420
Before Nick's fears as so go and correct that injustice, please everyone

24:09.200 --> 24:12.260
as for other YouTube channels, I

24:13.480 --> 24:14.760
mentioned

24:14.760 --> 24:21.320
Shannon Strouchy on Strouchy movies earlier. I hope I'm pronouncing your surname. Okay there Shannon

24:22.320 --> 24:29.260
Mainly you could just look at my subscription list on YouTube. I think that's available to be seen if it's not

24:30.360 --> 24:33.280
It's not I think it is though

24:35.120 --> 24:41.920
Besides all the other big leftist youtubers, which I imagine most people know, you know, if you watch me, you you know contrapoints

24:41.920 --> 24:43.920
You know hbomberguy

24:44.320 --> 24:45.600
Probably

24:45.600 --> 24:51.160
Things that I just watch personally in my own time. I always feel weird giving a plug to

24:51.320 --> 24:53.000
like I watch

24:53.000 --> 24:56.040
Panon Coec 2012's Mario videos

24:56.680 --> 25:04.040
The whole bunch but that's cuz I just find that really interesting and I wouldn't do other people like watching that stuff

25:04.040 --> 25:07.580
I don't know. Well, they make very good videos about Mario 64

25:08.440 --> 25:09.440
I

25:09.440 --> 25:11.440
like novel 87s

25:11.960 --> 25:18.460
Warcraft lore videos because I'm a big nerd and I actually care about the lore of world of warcraft

25:18.620 --> 25:23.980
If you can believe it I am one of the four people I

25:24.860 --> 25:26.180
think

25:26.180 --> 25:29.400
None of who work at Blizzard who actually care about the law

25:31.080 --> 25:36.820
So, yeah, just check my subscription list basically if it's available if not, I

25:37.340 --> 25:43.060
Should do like I'll do like a Twitter thread of a bunch of channels. I think are really good

25:43.620 --> 25:48.360
Remind me to do that if I don't do that like within a day of this video being posted

25:48.760 --> 25:54.220
Someone just poked me on Twitter and I'll do it. I'm using my audience like you'd use Siri or something

25:56.660 --> 26:03.860
Next question have you explored your gender identity much any interesting findings? Yes, and no

26:05.860 --> 26:08.880
Yes, I thought about gender a lot I have

26:09.640 --> 26:12.960
Trans pals, you know, I have non-binary pals

26:14.680 --> 26:16.680
Gay pals and so on

26:17.100 --> 26:22.220
So it's something I do I talk about and think about a fair amount but personally

26:23.400 --> 26:24.600
I'm

26:24.600 --> 26:29.440
Comfortable with how I'm seen to be yeah, which I've always considered myself

26:30.320 --> 26:36.640
Quite lucky. What should I say that? I don't know. I feel bad. I feel like it's giving into a world that

26:37.240 --> 26:38.480
Sort of

26:38.480 --> 26:39.440
oppresses

26:39.440 --> 26:46.040
Minorities to say oh, I'm glad I'm not a minority because I don't I wouldn't want to deal with the like oppression and assholes

26:46.040 --> 26:49.680
Making me feel bad all the time. I guess I need to qualify that I

26:50.440 --> 26:57.160
Feel glad I'm not because I wouldn't want to deal with the discrimination and not because I think there's anything

26:58.480 --> 27:05.120
You know inherently bad about identifying as any of those things. There we go. I thought I figured that out live

27:05.240 --> 27:08.440
There we go live for process everyone

27:09.000 --> 27:14.840
Next question you've mentioned before people who are a bit overbearing in your fan base who demand you denounce

27:14.840 --> 27:17.600
They saw that person or speak on a certain issue

27:18.000 --> 27:24.840
Is there any particular way you deal with that now if I'd edited these into a proper list? I would have put this earlier with the

27:26.440 --> 27:28.040
With the

27:28.040 --> 27:33.320
parasocial relationships one, but yes something I've struggled with is people

27:34.320 --> 27:36.320
Seeing the brand

27:37.800 --> 27:43.520
Instead of you know me as a person as in if I don't speak about one particular issue

27:44.280 --> 27:51.480
That means I am deliberately avoiding it instead of you know I was at Tesco and

27:52.200 --> 27:53.920
Didn't see it

27:53.920 --> 28:00.720
You know I don't think people literally think I'm like a corporation or something with you know

28:01.280 --> 28:03.280
handlers and

28:03.920 --> 28:07.480
secretary and things and I'm aware of everything but I

28:08.080 --> 28:14.440
Feel like they sort of carry that mindset over like once you reach a certain size on the internet

28:14.680 --> 28:17.160
people start treating you like that anyway, and

28:18.340 --> 28:24.560
You know I can have a bad day and not want to get into a big internet argument about something I

28:25.360 --> 28:27.360
remember a point where

28:28.320 --> 28:32.880
Some Twitter personality had done something very bad that I disagreed with

28:33.560 --> 28:38.000
And people were asking me to call them out about it

28:38.800 --> 28:41.800
But just that particular day. I was feeling very down and

28:42.760 --> 28:49.400
About something in my personal life a family issue and didn't really feel like getting into a big

28:50.280 --> 28:51.400
argument

28:51.400 --> 28:52.560
with

28:52.560 --> 28:54.560
someone on Twitter you know and

28:55.080 --> 28:58.520
That can suck. It's like you don't get days off

28:59.160 --> 29:06.080
From it and in a sense you know usually I'm happy to try and use my audience for productive things like that, but it's

29:06.920 --> 29:11.000
It doesn't feel like it's a choice a lot of the time it feels like

29:11.560 --> 29:18.040
You have to do that or you just lose some people forever like I've a lot of people on the left

29:18.400 --> 29:22.040
Particularly people in minority groups like so used to being betrayed

29:23.000 --> 29:25.600
Quotes well, I guess not air quotes, maybe

29:26.520 --> 29:28.520
The semi quotes

29:30.520 --> 29:35.160
By like online figures and stuff that you only really get one chance with a lot of people

29:35.240 --> 29:40.400
So if you don't speak on this or that issue you're cancelled forever of course

29:41.400 --> 29:45.000
so the way I deal with that is to just assume that

29:46.080 --> 29:49.520
If it wasn't this thing it would be another thing fairly soon

29:50.100 --> 29:52.480
You can't keep everyone on board forever

29:52.480 --> 29:55.480
You're always gonna have some people who disagree with the way you do things

29:56.520 --> 29:59.960
So I just rationalize it like that. You know people are free to

30:00.880 --> 30:02.880
Decide they don't like me

30:03.080 --> 30:04.480
Yeah

30:04.480 --> 30:10.440
Next question what you use to organize or plan video research is it just a text document or what?

30:10.800 --> 30:19.160
Usually I just use a text document occasionally if I have anything that I'd like anyone else to check out for me I use

30:20.040 --> 30:23.000
Like a Google Drive to just upload it

30:23.880 --> 30:27.960
When I made the Charlottesville video I had to print out a whole bunch of maps

30:28.640 --> 30:31.560
And notes to like keep it all organized. So

30:32.400 --> 30:34.400
my

30:34.560 --> 30:36.560
Room looked a bit like

30:37.160 --> 30:39.840
Seen from the wire or something, you know

30:42.120 --> 30:48.040
A whole bunch of maps with notes and little sticky notes stuck all over them. That was fun

30:48.040 --> 30:51.060
You know, I hope I never have to make another video about that topic

30:52.080 --> 30:55.240
But I liked the process of actually putting the video together

30:55.920 --> 31:02.220
Next question. How is your vegetarian diet going? It was going well until a couple of days ago

31:03.200 --> 31:06.120
Where I've I've temporarily put it on hold. I

31:06.800 --> 31:10.360
Need to take another run at it in a little while. I

31:11.280 --> 31:13.760
decided to go vegetarian a few months ago and

31:14.760 --> 31:22.920
Did so successfully I didn't eat any meat for like months apart from my cheese at once with a fish

31:24.680 --> 31:26.680
Sounds weird. I

31:27.400 --> 31:29.400
Never got cravings for meat at all

31:29.600 --> 31:33.140
Even though it was like mainly what I ate until then except for fish

31:33.140 --> 31:37.880
I got fish cravings and I don't even particularly like fish very much. So that was

31:38.680 --> 31:44.760
That was interesting, but I didn't put enough preparation into thinking about how to go vegetarian. So instead of

31:45.880 --> 31:51.280
Coming up with vegetarian meals and stuff to fill in for the meat. I was cutting out

31:51.280 --> 31:58.240
I just ate more of the non meat things that I like that were in my diet, which isn't good for you. Really? So

31:58.840 --> 32:00.440
I've

32:00.440 --> 32:04.640
Been feeling not too great on the old vegetarian diet

32:05.560 --> 32:10.320
And so I've had to put a pin in it for now and my I'm eating meat again

32:10.320 --> 32:15.560
But my goal is to go vegetarian and stick with it. So I'm going to

32:16.520 --> 32:18.520
spend a little while

32:19.080 --> 32:22.880
experimenting with different food and trying to come up with it like a

32:23.920 --> 32:26.980
menu of foods that I can eat from that sort of

32:27.600 --> 32:29.040
ensures that I

32:29.040 --> 32:30.440
Like actually

32:30.440 --> 32:33.840
nutritionally get everything that I need I'm gonna try and make it a

32:34.560 --> 32:36.560
process instead of just like a

32:36.920 --> 32:44.600
Immediate thing, you know next question. Why is it so hot? I'm dying. I feel my melted brain leaking out my ears and

32:45.600 --> 32:52.960
Me too. I mean especially when I mean I'm recording audio right now, so I can't have my fan on because it sounds like this

32:53.960 --> 32:59.680
And I can't have the window open because then you can hear everything that's happening outside

33:01.200 --> 33:05.000
So I'm sitting in a hot little room being really hot

33:06.440 --> 33:13.720
It's the worst I hate heat waves where is just cold all year round I want I'm thinking about moving

33:15.240 --> 33:17.240
Probably next year. I'm gonna move

33:18.200 --> 33:23.000
Somewhere else and a big part of me deciding where to move is

33:23.680 --> 33:28.240
Somewhere where it's colder than it is here because I really like the cold. I

33:28.880 --> 33:33.240
Don't like heat at all. It makes me feel terrible and it's just hot all the time

33:33.240 --> 33:39.960
Now this it was a heat wave a while ago and now it's just like oh, this is just the weather in the country now

33:40.480 --> 33:46.880
It's terrible and it's hot everywhere else. There's a heat wave in Japan right now. There's some horrible

33:47.400 --> 33:49.000
fire and grease

33:49.000 --> 33:51.400
God the world's burning

33:52.160 --> 33:54.160
It's this dreadful

33:54.880 --> 34:01.440
Next question. How do you go about refuting people who make their arguments by simply pointing out a true fact while obviously

34:02.120 --> 34:09.360
insinuating some bad political opinion with the fact so folks who are very coy about their true beliefs and sort of

34:09.960 --> 34:11.960
Talk around it. I suppose

34:12.400 --> 34:16.900
I just fill in the gaps that they won't for instance

34:17.960 --> 34:20.200
you know you get some people who are

34:21.320 --> 34:22.880
racist and who

34:22.880 --> 34:28.120
Hate black people and think black people are genetically inferior and they want to spread that message

34:28.120 --> 34:34.040
But they know they can't say that upfront because they'll just look like a racist and they'll get banned off whatever platform

34:34.040 --> 34:36.040
they're using so what they do is just

34:36.720 --> 34:42.600
List off all the other reasons why black people might not do as well economically or whatever and

34:43.240 --> 34:45.960
Then dismiss them they have a list of reasons

34:45.960 --> 34:50.200
It could be and they just cross out everything except for the genetic argument

34:50.200 --> 34:54.760
And then just leave it hanging there and trust the audience to make the leap for themselves

34:56.280 --> 35:02.320
So what I do is just step in and force it to go to that position by

35:03.500 --> 35:05.500
Claiming that is what they believe

35:05.860 --> 35:07.860
deliberately heavy air quotes

35:08.860 --> 35:10.860
misrepresenting their position

35:11.940 --> 35:13.940
Because that forces them to

35:14.100 --> 35:21.740
Clarify by saying they do or do not believe and then you've sort of neutered the tactic there because you've taken it to a place

35:22.380 --> 35:26.720
Where they didn't want to go because they were deliberately avoiding it

35:27.020 --> 35:32.940
It's something I've done in videos before if someone's being very coy about what they actually believe

35:32.940 --> 35:39.480
I just pick a position for them and say that's what they believe because then it makes them say I don't believe that

35:39.900 --> 35:41.900
It's something I've had success with

35:42.060 --> 35:48.980
For instance with Stefan Molyneux like I have previously claimed Stefan Molyneux thinks women are inferior

35:49.500 --> 35:56.460
Which he does, but he'd never admit to so I just like make the claim for him, and then that splits his audience

35:56.460 --> 35:58.740
I've posted comments before that are like

35:59.220 --> 36:05.620
One Stefan Molyneux fan being like he's never said he hates women that would be a ludicrous thing to say you're

36:06.020 --> 36:11.900
Misrepresenting him and then the next comment is like he's right to hate women. They're weak and inferior. You know

36:12.820 --> 36:19.660
Next question I noticed that sometimes in your response videos you play a lot of clips from the source and other times like in recent

36:19.660 --> 36:25.500
Videos you don't is it about the time it takes to make a video editing wise or is it to do with the content?

36:25.500 --> 36:26.700
You'd be quoting from them

36:26.700 --> 36:32.540
Do you ever have misgivings about including clips of people saying slurs and hateful things and the impact it might have on your audience?

36:33.340 --> 36:39.140
Yes, this is something I think about quite a lot, and I've definitely been experimenting more with

36:40.820 --> 36:43.220
Just not including clips

36:44.220 --> 36:46.940
Of other people talking when it's not

36:47.940 --> 36:53.420
actually necessary and just summarizing their arguments for them and trusting my audience to

36:53.820 --> 36:57.460
Go and view the original video if they doubt me there

37:00.460 --> 37:05.440
Partially because I don't like spreading that content around even if I'm responding to it

37:05.440 --> 37:10.520
You know like I don't like making people listen to black pigeon speaks for instance

37:11.060 --> 37:12.500
so I've been

37:12.500 --> 37:18.380
It's not anything to do with the video editing time because it's no time at all really to just drop clips

37:18.700 --> 37:25.140
It probably takes more time to write and record me summarizing their arguments than to just put their clips in

37:26.260 --> 37:30.260
But it's something I've been moving away from I used to get a lot comments like oh

37:30.260 --> 37:36.940
I struggle to watch Sean's videos because he puts in long clips of like Molyneux or whoever

37:38.500 --> 37:42.100
So yeah, I'm attempting to do it without for now

37:42.460 --> 37:44.580
But who knows I might change my mind later

37:44.940 --> 37:51.020
Next question your frog riddle argument relies on the assumption that the rate at which male frogs croak is

37:51.300 --> 37:54.740
independent of the sexes of the other frogs as well as other factors

37:55.180 --> 37:58.980
Since croaking is a social act closely tied to mating behavior

37:58.980 --> 38:04.240
This assumption is dubious and either way cannot be a third from the information present in the riddle

38:04.660 --> 38:09.940
There's no valid basis to assume that two male frogs are twice as likely to croak as one male frog

38:10.220 --> 38:14.140
Rendering your argument invalid to summarize this as a question

38:14.140 --> 38:20.140
Do you concede that the correct answer to the frog riddle given only the information presented therein is two thirds?

38:21.940 --> 38:23.940
This again, right

38:24.420 --> 38:26.420
No, I don't agree. I

38:27.180 --> 38:32.780
Think that if we start making assumptions about the croaking such as it's tied to mating behavior

38:33.460 --> 38:38.180
Then the croaking would actually increase if it was a male-female pair

38:38.220 --> 38:41.180
It would be more likely to occur than if it were two males

38:41.860 --> 38:45.860
Because they wouldn't be croaking at each other. It wouldn't be two-thirds

38:45.860 --> 38:47.860
It would actually be some other value

38:48.220 --> 38:53.860
The problem here is that if you make the assumption that two male frogs are not

38:54.180 --> 38:58.820
More likely than one male frog to make a croak over a given period

38:59.540 --> 39:01.800
Then you have to explain why that is

39:02.800 --> 39:03.960
And

39:03.960 --> 39:11.320
The answer will invariably be something that makes the outcome of the riddle not be a fixed value

39:11.640 --> 39:18.180
Anymore because it's information that we don't have like saying something like, you know frogs croak

39:18.720 --> 39:21.500
when they're mating for instance

39:22.560 --> 39:23.840
or

39:23.840 --> 39:30.000
Saying two male frogs won't croak when they're in close proximity, which you know, maybe that's true

39:30.680 --> 39:34.200
So two male frogs will be less likely to croak than one male frog

39:35.920 --> 39:39.700
But that makes it the answer to the riddle not be two-thirds, doesn't it?

39:40.260 --> 39:45.680
because it's if one you hear one frog croak, then you know that the other one is a female if

39:46.200 --> 39:49.600
You say that two male frogs will croak around other male frogs

39:49.600 --> 39:57.140
But not twice as likely then you have to account for why the fact that only one would croak and there just isn't the information

39:57.140 --> 39:59.300
In the riddle, basically, it's not a good riddle

39:59.740 --> 40:04.020
It's explained poorly. I was right. The riddle was wrong

40:04.400 --> 40:10.540
You're all gonna have to wait for the inevitable hbomberguy video about the frog riddle that he's been threatening to make for a while

40:11.500 --> 40:13.500
What's your favorite biscuit?

40:14.020 --> 40:16.900
I'm partial to some ginger nuts actually

40:17.940 --> 40:26.500
Next question. What's your computer setup CPU GPU etc. Can you hear that plane? I live right next to the airport. It's terrible

40:27.100 --> 40:33.580
I have a 1080 TI an i7 8700 K 16 gigs of RAM

40:34.260 --> 40:36.520
and a bunch of solid-state hard drives

40:37.460 --> 40:44.420
Which is neat. I have a fairly good computer on the whole. I need it for streaming to be honest streaming's

40:44.820 --> 40:48.180
Difficult it really taxes everything. I

40:50.080 --> 40:53.500
Feel like there needs to be some sort of nah, they wouldn't make it good

40:53.500 --> 40:57.340
I was thinking they should sell like they I don't know who they are either

40:57.860 --> 41:00.540
They should sell like a streaming rig

41:01.380 --> 41:03.380
specifically designed to stream games

41:04.380 --> 41:06.380
instead of sort of forcing

41:06.580 --> 41:13.200
You know one CPU to do the rendering of the game and the streaming of the game at the same time

41:13.620 --> 41:17.540
the next question is who is the best fictional detective and

41:18.260 --> 41:23.980
My question is why is this a question because it's obviously Columbo

41:24.740 --> 41:28.840
Columbo is by far and away the best fictional detective. He's brilliant

41:29.360 --> 41:35.600
The next question is are you planning on doing more videos like the problem with privatizing the railways?

41:37.120 --> 41:42.820
Yes, I am I have a couple more of those plans and I said at the start of the year that I'd like to make more

41:42.820 --> 41:44.500
videos like that

41:44.500 --> 41:46.500
But things just keep getting in the way

41:46.820 --> 41:49.700
They take quite a long time to research those ones

41:49.700 --> 41:56.420
I still I'm going to make those videos, but it's just when I get around to them. Basically. I've got one about

41:57.480 --> 42:01.780
Schools in the works and then one about health. That's

42:02.300 --> 42:06.300
That's just like a skeleton plan for now, but the school one is pretty far along

42:06.300 --> 42:11.620
I could do that like next month really if I wanted to maybe I will I don't know

42:11.620 --> 42:16.020
I've learned not to make predictions about when my videos are gonna come out anymore

42:16.980 --> 42:22.500
because invariably something gets in the way or I change my mind like a month later or

42:23.340 --> 42:25.340
some terrible

42:25.720 --> 42:28.580
Technical problem happens that pushes the release date back

42:29.080 --> 42:32.920
Never listen to me if I say a video is going to be out by a particular date

42:33.380 --> 42:36.500
It almost certainly won't be next question

42:36.500 --> 42:42.540
I want to know what is your opinion about people of the upper class who support the ideas of the left?

42:42.540 --> 42:48.140
I ask because I'm from the upper class. My parents have given me many opportunities in life

42:48.140 --> 42:55.000
Which does not mean that I believe these opportunities were deserved and I feel conflicted about my support for the abolishment of inheritance

42:55.580 --> 43:00.700
Because even if I'm completely in favor of it if my inheritance disappeared, I don't know what I'd do

43:01.380 --> 43:06.980
On the other hand, I think that if there was a certainty that I would not die of hunger or cold in the future

43:06.980 --> 43:09.420
I would not mind at all what happens to my parents money

43:10.300 --> 43:12.660
Yes, well you nailed it at the end there

43:12.660 --> 43:19.860
I think this is an example of a situation in which when we say we support something we need to clarify our

43:20.060 --> 43:25.700
Sort of broader political goals as well because if you say I support

43:26.260 --> 43:31.780
Abolishing inheritance and then nothing else a lot of people are gonna be very put off by that obviously

43:31.780 --> 43:36.220
But if it didn't matter if inheritance was abolished because no one would ever

43:36.740 --> 43:40.920
Want for a place to stay or food or heating or such?

43:41.180 --> 43:45.020
Then people would be a lot more on board with it for a lot of these sorts of issues

43:45.100 --> 43:51.400
It's better to explain your full world view and how your opinion on the particular issue fits into it

43:51.560 --> 43:57.880
Rather than just saying, you know, I support abolishing inheritance and that's it similarly with

43:58.640 --> 44:04.380
Saying you want to abolish private property. I mean if you just say that in isolation a lot of people assume

44:05.480 --> 44:11.400
You mean you want to come to their house and steal their car and their pets and things like that

44:12.000 --> 44:17.920
Which obviously isn't how it works. So I guess what I'm saying is we should push for the full package really

44:18.200 --> 44:24.000
Hey Sean, this is a pretty stupid question, but I plan to move to the UK at some point in my life soon

44:24.080 --> 44:29.300
Would you advise against it and you'll have any suggestions for a cheap but good place to live?

44:30.840 --> 44:32.840
Wow, okay, I

44:33.880 --> 44:38.640
would advise waiting for now and seeing how brexit turns out it's

44:40.520 --> 44:45.040
Right now we're looking at the quotes hard brexit

44:45.040 --> 44:48.120
Which means the whole country is going to explode

44:49.840 --> 44:57.320
If you do if you have to move here for whatever horrible reason I would look at places in

44:58.000 --> 44:59.040
maybe

44:59.040 --> 45:04.760
Wales or Scotland and not England and if you do have to live in England

45:04.760 --> 45:08.580
I would probably suggest somewhere outside of London

45:09.840 --> 45:12.080
Just because it's so expensive there, you know

45:12.560 --> 45:16.600
Either way best of luck to you. You're gonna need it

45:17.680 --> 45:21.140
Next question. Do you tend to get more enjoyment from multiplayer?

45:21.680 --> 45:28.480
systems driven games where you spend many hours perfecting your play or from games that take you through a story or adventure once and then

45:28.480 --> 45:29.720
You're done with it

45:29.720 --> 45:33.600
Well, I'm very boring here and don't really have a preference. I

45:34.280 --> 45:37.260
Like plenty of games that fall into both of those categories

45:37.900 --> 45:43.260
And what I think makes the game good or bad in this regard is if it knows exactly what it is and

45:45.180 --> 45:51.220
Like the worst of both worlds here is a game that should be a short story driven thing

45:51.620 --> 45:52.700
but

45:52.700 --> 45:55.260
unnecessarily tacks on a bunch of like

45:56.220 --> 45:58.220
customization level up

45:58.420 --> 46:00.420
grindy nonsense

46:00.420 --> 46:03.700
In order to slow the whole game down and just pad the runtime

46:04.220 --> 46:08.980
So I can like either of these I just like them when they're well designed

46:09.580 --> 46:15.300
For what they are. So I guess what I'm saying is is I like good video games and not bad ones

46:15.580 --> 46:22.140
That's my brave opinion for today. Next question. Is the voice you use in your videos your real voice?

46:23.940 --> 46:25.380
Mostly I

46:25.380 --> 46:27.880
Guess I don't put on an accent or anything

46:28.800 --> 46:34.480
But in most of my videos I'm reading from my prepared script I'm not in this one

46:34.480 --> 46:36.480
which is why I'm umming and ahhing and

46:37.120 --> 46:44.080
Speaking slower than you might be used to hearing me. But mostly yeah, I sound like this IRL I suppose

46:44.640 --> 46:47.340
next question who is Jen and

46:47.960 --> 46:52.980
I still get asked this quite a lot. I took Jen's name off the YouTube channel and everything

46:53.180 --> 46:59.780
I still get asked who Jen is like all the time and it's so easy to find out but people keep asking me it

46:59.780 --> 47:04.900
So actually I'm gonna throw this one over to Jen. Hello. I'm Jen

47:04.900 --> 47:08.660
I am NOT a body pillow or a hand. I am Sean's friend

47:08.660 --> 47:14.220
I am NOT in the YouTube videos anymore except for this one because nobody believes I am real

47:14.460 --> 47:18.980
If you like me, you should watch our regular live streams on our twitch channel

47:19.140 --> 47:22.820
Twitch.tv slash Sean and Jen, okay

47:24.220 --> 47:29.580
So there we go. That was Jen why she chose to read that out. Like I forced her to at gunpoint

47:29.580 --> 47:32.220
I don't know. So thanks for that Jen

47:33.260 --> 47:39.700
Yeah, okay folks. That's all for me today. Thanks a lot as always for watching and subscribing all

47:41.100 --> 47:45.100
100,000 of you that is rather scary, isn't it?

47:46.820 --> 47:48.620
Yes

47:49.140 --> 47:51.140
100,000 people

47:51.580 --> 47:53.580
Wow, let's get to a million

47:54.180 --> 47:58.260
Then then I'll really be scared when we get to a million Wow ten times

47:58.260 --> 48:00.260
So it took me like a couple years to get here

48:00.420 --> 48:03.460
So it's gonna take me a couple of decades to get to a million

48:04.140 --> 48:07.140
Assuming like steady growth like it has been going Wow

48:08.300 --> 48:10.300
So I'll be like 50

48:11.080 --> 48:15.500
Let's see if I can get to a million subscribers before I'm 50

48:16.060 --> 48:21.980
Will I still be doing this when I'm 50 I I don't know if I'm happy about that or not actually I

48:22.820 --> 48:25.840
Mean, I like doing it, but am I gonna like doing this when I'm 50?

48:26.740 --> 48:31.900
