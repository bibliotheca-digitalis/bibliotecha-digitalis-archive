00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,920
Hello everyone, this is just another Q&A video because I hit a hundred thousand subscribers here on YouTube recently

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:11,300
Which is fairly neat. I like it when we hit these milestones

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,680
Generally because I like making these Q&A videos to be honest

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:22,200
So thank you to everyone who's subscribed and supported the channel. Here's to... what's the next big

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,800
milestone after this?

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,960
Here's to 50 million subscribers, how about that? And let's just get right into it, okay

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,720
Hi Sean, have you ever tried vanilla Coke?

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,080
Yes, I have

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,100
Starting with that question. I didn't do any editing on the order of these questions

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,480
they're just how I pasted them into the text document here, so

11
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,700
Yes, I have tried vanilla Coke

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,480
I'm not going to tell you what I thought of vanilla Coke because that wasn't part of the question

13
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,640
So okay on to the next one

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:02,960
When are we getting our annual CinemaSins video for 2018? Oh, man, those things

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,720
Do I really have to do another one of those? I don't... I don't want to. I hate them

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:17,220
It'd involve watching another year's worth of CinemaSins videos. I don't know. People seem to like them though

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,480
Possibly

18
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:28,160
Around December, I'd say around the end of the year if it happens, which right now it probably won't

19
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,280
What thing have you done so far that you're most proud of?

20
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,800
I'll assume you just mean on YouTube here, and it's the Charlottesville video

21
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:43,400
I think that's the one I spent the most time on and that I think came out the best to be honest

22
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,360
So yeah that one

23
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,400
What's the ideal length for audio takes or do you try to get it all over with in one go?

24
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,520
Well, I answered this in another video, but I tend to record all of my audio in a single go

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,840
Just because I'm not very good at it, and if I recorded it at different times, it would sound different

26
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,320
I've never been able to crack that problem really even in an identical audio setup my audio seems to sound different

27
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,960
So I just do it all in one go so there's no

28
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,640
Noticeable cuts so now I try to get the script completely 100% finished before I start

29
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,560
Recording it. Can you hear those banging upstairs? I'm not gonna cut that out today

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,400
Yeah, there's another one

31
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:33,240
It's it's that all the time so on my like regular videos where I don't want to have just random knocks in the background

32
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,920
I have to try and record sentences in between those knocks

33
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,500
It's it's hellish, and they seem to increase when I start recording as well

34
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:48,980
I think my upstairs neighbors don't like me very much and wait for me to start recording videos, and there's another one

35
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,120
Just start throwing rocks around or something

36
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,700
Seeing as you seem to like Star Wars. What are your thoughts on the prequel trilogy?

37
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:04,020
Do you like them hate them or have mixed feelings about them? I guess I'd fall under the mixed category here

38
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,920
I don't think they're particularly good movies however. They're not as bad as the internet

39
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,520
Makes out and

40
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,540
some of the things in there are quite interesting like I

41
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,480
I

42
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,840
don't know. I'm one of those people who's like I

43
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,400
I'm happier that the prequels exist than

44
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:33,920
Sort of free boring movies that just tried to copy the success of the original trilogy by making something like identical

45
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:39,560
But without the impact you know so I'm happy yeah, I'm happy the prequels exist

46
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,240
And I like the Gungans. I think the Gungans are cool, and I like the podrace as well

47
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,240
I think the podrace is a genuinely good

48
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,360
action scene

49
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,840
So yeah

50
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,960
Sue me

51
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,920
How do you deal with parasocial relationships and then in brackets in which you are not the persona?

52
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:05,000
So I guess this is me being a fan of someone else then I think you just need to respect

53
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,920
Boundaries really and keep a few things in mind like I have

54
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,180
Creators on YouTube. I really like I have twitch streamers. I really like

55
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,360
but you have to be aware constantly that what you're seeing is just a

56
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:28,880
Public face really and it's a little bit more of a blurred line than in

57
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:37,960
Traditional like broadcast television obviously because it's there's no PR people or handlers or editors in between you and them when

58
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,960
They're just like streaming live on Twitch

59
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,440
but you're still seeing a

60
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,560
persona and

61
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,560
Not always the real person

62
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:54,120
This question reminded me of that video by Shannon Strachey about parasocial relationships

63
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:00,440
Which I believe she's and making a follow-up to so I'll link that in the description and you should go check that out

64
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:07,460
I say I believe she's making a follow-up to I know she is she asked me to record a voice climb for it

65
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,840
So I'll be in that one as well

66
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:16,020
How do you manage to stay so calm and maintain hope when everything seems so grim?

67
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,880
Well, this is a loaded question, isn't it? I don't

68
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:27,600
Often, you know, actually this ties into the previous question a little which is odd because I didn't intend for it to at all

69
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,640
but yeah, what you're seeing there is

70
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:36,860
An act if I make a response video the first time I watch through the video

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,880
I'm pausing every 10 seconds and swearing and

72
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,760
Furiously scribbling notes and I'm incredibly angry about it all

73
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,320
And then over the creation process by the time it comes out the other side in in the actual

74
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:56,660
Video that goes up on my channel. It's not that I'm suddenly not angry about racism or

75
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,240
Whatever else I'm talking about

76
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,380
It's that I've decided that that is the best way to present my argument

77
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,520
so it's a

78
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:14,760
Fiction basically, I'm more often a very angry and moody person to be honest

79
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:22,740
Next question. Why are anti-feminist anti SJW beliefs so popular? I got asked this a few times in

80
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,200
various forms and

81
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:31,420
Mainly it's because they're easy. It's very simple to look at sort of complicated

82
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,160
social political economic problems and then just

83
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,660
Blame all of that on a group of other people who are bad

84
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,740
It's sort of a shortcut into feeling superior to other people and all types of people do it

85
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,800
It's just lazy thinking basically

86
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:58,960
Next question. I really want to make video game reviews and political essays like you and hbomberguy, but I'm terrified. No one will like me

87
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,400
Well, that certainly hasn't stopped hbomberguy. So I'd say just go ahead

88
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,080
That's not very fair

89
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,440
I'd say if you want to do those things

90
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,580
Then you should don't let the fear of not being popular

91
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,000
Stop you

92
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,840
Because you won't be

93
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,400
You definitely won't be when you start out

94
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,600
I made videos for years as I've mentioned before with basically no audience at all

95
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,400
Oh, you know a single or double-digit audience for a very long time

96
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,320
before

97
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,920
like any of my

98
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,200
Videos broke a thousand views. It was like two years or something like that

99
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,600
And but it was still fun. It was still an interesting way to spend my time and I learned a lot doing that

100
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,920
That has helped me out now. So yeah, go ahead. Give it a go

101
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,560
Next question. What are your predictions for the future of the Democrats? Will they move to the left?

102
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:04,280
Will they be surpassed by a more left-wing party? Will they continue to capitulate to Republicans and be absolutely useless?

103
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,360
That's from Cameron there

104
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,840
Sort of a mix of those I think Democrats as in

105
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,360
The party membership and people who vote for the Democrats will probably move further left

106
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,560
I think the party establishment will continue to capitulate to Republicans and be absolutely useless

107
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,520
I mean the way they're going now, they are going to lose

108
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:36,680
The next presidential election like how they are right now they it's over already Trump is a two-term president

109
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,680
They have absolutely no chance in hell

110
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,320
That beaten Trump and without a significant shift in a policy here

111
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,000
It's best to think of the of the Democrats

112
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:57,960
Saying when I say the Democrats, I usually mean at the party establishment in terms of energy as in

113
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,280
They have no energy to do anything. That's why they've latched on to the

114
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:09,800
Russia thing so much because it doesn't require them to make any promises like they don't have to do anything

115
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,520
They all promise something that they'll fail to deliver on like they know

116
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,400
At least I hope they know that they could win by running on

117
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:25,480
Things like relief for student debt and universal health care and things like that

118
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,120
They must know that they could win if they did that

119
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,980
But they won't because then they'd have to do it

120
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,400
Or they think they'd have to do it

121
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:43,160
Anyway, they should learn from the Republicans that you don't have to actually do the things that you promised to do like

122
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,240
Democrats tense and waffling now, but whatever I'm gonna keep going at Democrats and the states tend to try to get everything sorted

123
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,100
Before they decide what they're going to do

124
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,500
Republicans just say what they're going to do and then worry about the

125
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,780
complications later

126
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:04,220
Like Trump ran on big wall Mexico pays for it

127
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,740
And now there's absolutely no way to do that or make it work

128
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:13,960
It's a complete waste of time and money and effort and it makes the country look bad and it wouldn't do anything

129
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,960
Even if you did it

130
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,940
But none of that matters

131
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,620
What matters is that he won the election

132
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:27,300
I feel like they're too addicted to polling which makes them very boring and

133
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:34,300
unexciting like if you look at universal health care very divisive policy in the United States anyway, not

134
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,060
insensible countries

135
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:43,980
Yeah, universal health care you get people coming out very strongly in favor of it very strongly against it and the Democrats don't like that

136
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,380
They like things that everyone sort of agrees with

137
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:53,780
so if you poll for universal health care you get 50-50 split of people being angry or happy about it and

138
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,140
But if you poll for better health care

139
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:04,340
It turns out everyone likes better health care everyone supports better health care. So they run on that instead

140
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,900
They say oh we're going to work to make health care better for everyone

141
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,460
You're like, but how?

142
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:17,060
What are you actually going to do like we're going to make it really good

143
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:25,480
Non specifically that's how you end up with like just like middle-of-the-road rubbish like Obamacare and get it

144
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,700
It's easy to call it that as like someone from a different country where you know

145
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,700
It hasn't saved my life or whatever

146
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:37,900
But even accounting for all the people who Obamacare has helped it is a rubbish system

147
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:42,100
It's awful and you just need full universal health coverage in the states

148
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,340
That's it should be the only acceptable position

149
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:51,560
I mean if I lived in the states, I'd encourage people not to support any Democrat who didn't come out in favor of it

150
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:59,080
But again, I get that that's very easy for me to say, you know, not living with the consequences of all the other actions

151
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:05,460
What was the question here? Even I don't know the Democrats are just rubbish as in the party establishment

152
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:11,100
There's plenty of local-level Democrats who are brilliant and working really hard and doing everything, right?

153
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,460
But it feels like if they want to get anything done anytime soon

154
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:22,420
They're just gonna have to go through the party leadership somehow. I don't know how they are gonna do that

155
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,060
but that should be on the agenda of

156
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:32,080
More left-leaning Democrats now. It's okay. How do we get these people out of the party? How do we go around them?

157
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,520
Next question, do you know how artists eventually begin to regret old works that they made?

158
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,780
Does that happen to you and how long does it take to kick in if it does?

159
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,680
about

160
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,680
45 seconds usually

161
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,160
Yes, I've got old videos I've taken down because I'm not happy with them anymore

162
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,000
Around the time I started getting popular on YouTube was when I started making

163
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,600
videos about

164
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,600
anti-feminists and alt-right figures and such

165
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,280
And when I set about doing that it wasn't

166
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:13,120
for some social justice cause particularly it wasn't because I was worried about the reach or

167
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:22,040
Corrupting influence of these people or anything and it was because I thought that they were really pompous and it would be funny to annoy them

168
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,980
So the way I went about making videos was totally different to how I do it now

169
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:34,860
Like now I am actually concerned about those things and I actually do make videos about ideas and arguments

170
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,260
Or at least I hope I do

171
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,860
But back then I was just trying to piss people off really

172
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:45,420
So I've been taking those videos offline now because I'm not happy with them and it's not something

173
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,660
I like being out there and representing me

174
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:53,580
So yes, basically I tend to go off things that I make

175
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:59,320
Next question. Is there any possible way for you to make more videos faster?

176
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,340
Yes, I could do that, but I haven't been

177
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,940
for a few reasons

178
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:12,860
One thing is I've been thinking of changing maybe to monthly payments on a patreon

179
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,700
Because some ideas I have are like I could make a video about that

180
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,440
But there isn't really enough in it to justify me spending the time

181
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:27,020
Making it if I'm not gonna feel comfortable charging for it

182
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:32,380
and with a like a lighter video if I made something like 10 minutes or something or

183
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:38,340
Anything that was substantially either shorter or like more off-the-cuff

184
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,540
I

185
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:45,220
Wouldn't feel comfortable charging for that charging an audience for that who were used to

186
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:51,500
You know a different sort of thing so I just tend not to do those ideas instead

187
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,780
I'm like, well, I can't really justify the time investment if I'm not gonna get paid for it, but

188
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,460
So it just ends up not being made

189
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,740
but if I went to monthly

190
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,360
Then I could sort of I'd feel more loose about what I could make then

191
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,620
So that's something I'm gonna be thinking about in the next few months. If I did that it would probably be

192
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,100
around

193
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,100
Christmas this year I

194
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,660
Think I might go over to monthly. I'm not sure I'll think about it

195
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,980
And do you have any plans to change your format and introduce more visuals?

196
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,340
Not really. I wanted to initially but

197
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,820
Similar to the last question, you know, this seems to be fairly popular what I'm doing right now

198
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:39,580
A lot of people have messaged me to say they treat them sort of as podcasts and I've started writing them

199
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,500
More and more such that they make sense without the visuals as well

200
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,820
I still put visuals in because I think they enhance it

201
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:52,100
Make things clearer and such and you have to refer to a visual every now and then in the script

202
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,700
but I try to do as much of it as

203
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,060
Understandable just by listening to the audio

204
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:04,700
So I don't have any plans to change the format right now if I changed formats at all, it would be

205
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:10,260
On completely new content that wasn't related to what I was currently doing

206
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,820
So my sort of monthly videos will continue to be the same sort of thing

207
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,460
For the foreseeable future anyway

208
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:23,660
Next question. Why are so many right-wingers into Warhammer? Well, because it's a bunch of

209
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,700
Militaristic fascist states just clashing into each other constantly

210
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,940
And they love all that shit

211
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,900
Basically, I think Warhammer doesn't have

212
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:42,580
Like everything's horrible in Warhammer, there's no faction you can point to and say they're the good guys

213
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,800
You know, they're the people who are trying to get it done. Well

214
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,480
Like everyone is just a different flavor of horrible

215
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,900
So there's no

216
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,260
sort of

217
00:16:54,260 --> 00:17:01,100
Space within the universe to sort of openly criticize these like horrible societies

218
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,060
Next question. Why aren't conservatives funny?

219
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,740
And it's interesting this

220
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,620
It's all relative. Of course. I mean lots of people do think

221
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,340
Conservatives are funny for whatever reason

222
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,580
but with

223
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,020
Comedy you need both the person that like

224
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,900
Attempting to be funny and you need the audience as well. Like you need to consider their

225
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,500
Reaction and their understanding and what they're bringing to it

226
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:34,620
No one can be funny in a vacuum without an audience really

227
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:42,820
Playing to conservative audiences you have much less material and fewer places you can go

228
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:49,180
because if you you know, very loose characterizations of liberal and conservative thought

229
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,580
conservatives favor

230
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,780
tradition things staying the same

231
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,180
They don't like change. They like everyone being one way one type of thing

232
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:09,020
And that just sort of naturally restricts your available material because you can't go outside that

233
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,460
relatively narrow world view whereas

234
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:19,100
On the left you have a lot more spaces you can go basically also and again

235
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,060
This is just my opinion comedy works best when you're punching up

236
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,580
And conservatives really don't like punching up at all

237
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:34,340
Next question, how's brexit treating you? Well, it's an absolute disaster, isn't it?

238
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,380
I don't think there's anyone who thinks it's going well

239
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:43,580
Yeah, it's terrible. It's I thought about stockpiling food the other day

240
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,220
imagine that

241
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,840
like in

242
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,840
the UK like

243
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,220
ostensibly a

244
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,740
first world developed wealthy nation

245
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,740
I'm

246
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,100
thinking about

247
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:05,700
Stockpiling food for an upcoming disaster next question. What do you think of Jeremy Corbyn?

248
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,920
I

249
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,920
Don't know yet

250
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,700
on the one hand I really like

251
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,360
Corbyn for but well, he's a left-winger, isn't he?

252
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:23,740
Which is great. It's excellent to have an actual leftist at the head of the Labour Party

253
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,200
Which should you know, you'd imagine it be a requirement

254
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:37,420
To be the head of the again ostensibly left-wing Labour Party, but it's not so it's very good that he's in there

255
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:42,460
I hope he is able to transform the party to be more in line with

256
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:49,240
Like its original intent than what Tony Blair and co turned it into

257
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,620
Now the reason I am unsure about Corbyn is I'm not sure what he's going to do with regards to

258
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,560
the whole brexit

259
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,920
disaster I

260
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:08,680
Was completely not on board with how labor were handling the whole brexit thing until fairly recently. I've come around on it, but

261
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,360
see

262
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:15,140
What I wanted them to do was to immediately come out guns blazing

263
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,340
Trying to shut it down offering a second referendum

264
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,340
Doing everything in their power to stop it

265
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,580
And seeing them just sit on the sidelines was a bit frustrating

266
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,100
But I've changed my mind now. I

267
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,340
feel like brexit is such a disaster and so terrible that

268
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,780
It sort of needs to land squarely on the Tories like that

269
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:50,060
It needs to be marked down in the history books as the Tories did this and it was a complete disaster. I

270
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,700
Feel like giving them an out

271
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:57,020
Like if Corbyn came out tomorrow and said we'll do a second referendum

272
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:02,220
One it would be very risky because a lot of Labour voters voted leave

273
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,820
Secondly the Tories would immediately pivot

274
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,540
from infighting and

275
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,740
destroying themselves and resigning

276
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,300
to

277
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,300
immediately blaming everything on labor

278
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,180
They would say I can't believe labor is

279
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,860
Disrupting these negotiations which were going so well

280
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:29,580
They it was perfect until labor came along and ruined it all and the very

281
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:35,340
Compliant media would swallow it completely. They would say labor are backstabbers

282
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:40,740
Hurting our country at this crucial point in the negotiations, which were going wonderfully

283
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
So now I'm sort of on board

284
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:49,660
With labor just sitting on their hands and saying well, you know get on with it

285
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,740
However, that's

286
00:21:54,140 --> 00:22:00,620
Introduced like an element of uncertainty now, like I'm not sure what Corbyn would do if he was just handed power tomorrow

287
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:07,700
so it makes it kind of hard for me to throw my full like unqualified support behind him because

288
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,580
his

289
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:15,940
Attitude towards like this big crucial question about the future of our country is just sort of a question mark to me right now

290
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:22,920
So it remains to be seen basically, I hope he's as good as he could be

291
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:28,540
Next question. How has YouTube fame affected your opinion of yourself?

292
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:34,580
It hasn't really and I wouldn't I'm not YouTube famous am I I

293
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,580
Don't think so, I'm like one

294
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:43,060
600th of a PewDiePie like it's you know, it's all relative and

295
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,740
because I I

296
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:53,260
Don't often appear in videos or on camera like even when I'm streaming like it's a rare thing. I don't get recognized

297
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,900
So it's not really affected my opinion of myself all that much at least

298
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,020
I hope it hasn't it's hard to tell when these things are happening to you. Well

299
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:09,320
One thing I've noticed with a lot of the anti-feminist youtubers that get quite big they start thinking that they are

300
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,260
geniuses just because they have

301
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,580
Thousands of people telling them that they're geniuses all the time

302
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:20,780
So I always have to remind myself when anyone says oh, you're really good or whatever

303
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:26,240
I always challenge it in my head. I'm like dad. You don't know what you're talking about. I'm actually

304
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,360
Complete rubbish

305
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:35,000
Next question. Hey Shawn just for your 100k Q&A video who are some of your favorite YouTube channels?

306
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,080
Always looking for new folks to watch. Thanks. That's from Nick's fears there

307
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:46,360
Well one particular channel that I'd like to give a big shout out to is a Nick's fears

308
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:52,800
I don't know if you've heard of them question asker, but they make very good videos about movies

309
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,080
I'll put a link in the description. So everyone should head over there and subscribe

310
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:02,360
It's absolutely criminal that my channel is at 100k subscribers

311
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:08,420
Before Nick's fears as so go and correct that injustice, please everyone

312
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,260
as for other YouTube channels, I

313
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,760
mentioned

314
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:21,320
Shannon Strouchy on Strouchy movies earlier. I hope I'm pronouncing your surname. Okay there Shannon

315
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:29,260
Mainly you could just look at my subscription list on YouTube. I think that's available to be seen if it's not

316
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,280
It's not I think it is though

317
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:41,920
Besides all the other big leftist youtubers, which I imagine most people know, you know, if you watch me, you you know contrapoints

318
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,920
You know hbomberguy

319
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,600
Probably

320
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,160
Things that I just watch personally in my own time. I always feel weird giving a plug to

321
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,000
like I watch

322
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,040
Panon Coec 2012's Mario videos

323
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:04,040
The whole bunch but that's cuz I just find that really interesting and I wouldn't do other people like watching that stuff

324
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,580
I don't know. Well, they make very good videos about Mario 64

325
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,440
I

326
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,440
like novel 87s

327
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:18,460
Warcraft lore videos because I'm a big nerd and I actually care about the lore of world of warcraft

328
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:23,980
If you can believe it I am one of the four people I

329
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,180
think

330
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:29,400
None of who work at Blizzard who actually care about the law

331
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:36,820
So, yeah, just check my subscription list basically if it's available if not, I

332
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:43,060
Should do like I'll do like a Twitter thread of a bunch of channels. I think are really good

333
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:48,360
Remind me to do that if I don't do that like within a day of this video being posted

334
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:54,220
Someone just poked me on Twitter and I'll do it. I'm using my audience like you'd use Siri or something

335
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:03,860
Next question have you explored your gender identity much any interesting findings? Yes, and no

336
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,880
Yes, I thought about gender a lot I have

337
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,960
Trans pals, you know, I have non-binary pals

338
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,680
Gay pals and so on

339
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:22,220
So it's something I do I talk about and think about a fair amount but personally

340
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,600
I'm

341
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,440
Comfortable with how I'm seen to be yeah, which I've always considered myself

342
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:36,640
Quite lucky. What should I say that? I don't know. I feel bad. I feel like it's giving into a world that

343
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,480
Sort of

344
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,440
oppresses

345
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:46,040
Minorities to say oh, I'm glad I'm not a minority because I don't I wouldn't want to deal with the like oppression and assholes

346
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,680
Making me feel bad all the time. I guess I need to qualify that I

347
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:57,160
Feel glad I'm not because I wouldn't want to deal with the discrimination and not because I think there's anything

348
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:05,120
You know inherently bad about identifying as any of those things. There we go. I thought I figured that out live

349
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,440
There we go live for process everyone

350
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,840
Next question you've mentioned before people who are a bit overbearing in your fan base who demand you denounce

351
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,600
They saw that person or speak on a certain issue

352
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,840
Is there any particular way you deal with that now if I'd edited these into a proper list? I would have put this earlier with the

353
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,040
With the

354
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:33,320
parasocial relationships one, but yes something I've struggled with is people

355
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
Seeing the brand

356
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:43,520
Instead of you know me as a person as in if I don't speak about one particular issue

357
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:51,480
That means I am deliberately avoiding it instead of you know I was at Tesco and

358
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,920
Didn't see it

359
00:27:53,920 --> 00:28:00,720
You know I don't think people literally think I'm like a corporation or something with you know

360
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,280
handlers and

361
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,480
secretary and things and I'm aware of everything but I

362
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:14,440
Feel like they sort of carry that mindset over like once you reach a certain size on the internet

363
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,160
people start treating you like that anyway, and

364
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:24,560
You know I can have a bad day and not want to get into a big internet argument about something I

365
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,360
remember a point where

366
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,880
Some Twitter personality had done something very bad that I disagreed with

367
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:38,000
And people were asking me to call them out about it

368
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,800
But just that particular day. I was feeling very down and

369
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:49,400
About something in my personal life a family issue and didn't really feel like getting into a big

370
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,400
argument

371
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,560
with

372
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,560
someone on Twitter you know and

373
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,520
That can suck. It's like you don't get days off

374
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:06,080
From it and in a sense you know usually I'm happy to try and use my audience for productive things like that, but it's

375
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,000
It doesn't feel like it's a choice a lot of the time it feels like

376
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:18,040
You have to do that or you just lose some people forever like I've a lot of people on the left

377
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,040
Particularly people in minority groups like so used to being betrayed

378
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,600
Quotes well, I guess not air quotes, maybe

379
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,520
The semi quotes

380
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,160
By like online figures and stuff that you only really get one chance with a lot of people

381
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,400
So if you don't speak on this or that issue you're cancelled forever of course

382
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,000
so the way I deal with that is to just assume that

383
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,520
If it wasn't this thing it would be another thing fairly soon

384
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,480
You can't keep everyone on board forever

385
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,480
You're always gonna have some people who disagree with the way you do things

386
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,960
So I just rationalize it like that. You know people are free to

387
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,880
Decide they don't like me

388
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,480
Yeah

389
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,440
Next question what you use to organize or plan video research is it just a text document or what?

390
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:19,160
Usually I just use a text document occasionally if I have anything that I'd like anyone else to check out for me I use

391
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,000
Like a Google Drive to just upload it

392
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,960
When I made the Charlottesville video I had to print out a whole bunch of maps

393
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,560
And notes to like keep it all organized. So

394
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,400
my

395
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,560
Room looked a bit like

396
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,840
Seen from the wire or something, you know

397
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:48,040
A whole bunch of maps with notes and little sticky notes stuck all over them. That was fun

398
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,060
You know, I hope I never have to make another video about that topic

399
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,240
But I liked the process of actually putting the video together

400
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:02,220
Next question. How is your vegetarian diet going? It was going well until a couple of days ago

401
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,120
Where I've I've temporarily put it on hold. I

402
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,360
Need to take another run at it in a little while. I

403
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,760
decided to go vegetarian a few months ago and

404
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:22,920
Did so successfully I didn't eat any meat for like months apart from my cheese at once with a fish

405
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,680
Sounds weird. I

406
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,400
Never got cravings for meat at all

407
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,140
Even though it was like mainly what I ate until then except for fish

408
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:37,880
I got fish cravings and I don't even particularly like fish very much. So that was

409
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:44,760
That was interesting, but I didn't put enough preparation into thinking about how to go vegetarian. So instead of

410
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:51,280
Coming up with vegetarian meals and stuff to fill in for the meat. I was cutting out

411
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:58,240
I just ate more of the non meat things that I like that were in my diet, which isn't good for you. Really? So

412
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,440
I've

413
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,640
Been feeling not too great on the old vegetarian diet

414
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:10,320
And so I've had to put a pin in it for now and my I'm eating meat again

415
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,560
But my goal is to go vegetarian and stick with it. So I'm going to

416
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,520
spend a little while

417
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,880
experimenting with different food and trying to come up with it like a

418
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,980
menu of foods that I can eat from that sort of

419
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,040
ensures that I

420
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,440
Like actually

421
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,840
nutritionally get everything that I need I'm gonna try and make it a

422
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,560
process instead of just like a

423
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:44,600
Immediate thing, you know next question. Why is it so hot? I'm dying. I feel my melted brain leaking out my ears and

424
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:52,960
Me too. I mean especially when I mean I'm recording audio right now, so I can't have my fan on because it sounds like this

425
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:59,680
And I can't have the window open because then you can hear everything that's happening outside

426
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,000
So I'm sitting in a hot little room being really hot

427
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:13,720
It's the worst I hate heat waves where is just cold all year round I want I'm thinking about moving

428
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,240
Probably next year. I'm gonna move

429
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:23,000
Somewhere else and a big part of me deciding where to move is

430
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:28,240
Somewhere where it's colder than it is here because I really like the cold. I

431
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,240
Don't like heat at all. It makes me feel terrible and it's just hot all the time

432
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:39,960
Now this it was a heat wave a while ago and now it's just like oh, this is just the weather in the country now

433
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:46,880
It's terrible and it's hot everywhere else. There's a heat wave in Japan right now. There's some horrible

434
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,000
fire and grease

435
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,400
God the world's burning

436
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,160
It's this dreadful

437
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:01,440
Next question. How do you go about refuting people who make their arguments by simply pointing out a true fact while obviously

438
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:09,360
insinuating some bad political opinion with the fact so folks who are very coy about their true beliefs and sort of

439
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,960
Talk around it. I suppose

440
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,900
I just fill in the gaps that they won't for instance

441
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,200
you know you get some people who are

442
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,880
racist and who

443
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:28,120
Hate black people and think black people are genetically inferior and they want to spread that message

444
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:34,040
But they know they can't say that upfront because they'll just look like a racist and they'll get banned off whatever platform

445
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,040
they're using so what they do is just

446
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:42,600
List off all the other reasons why black people might not do as well economically or whatever and

447
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,960
Then dismiss them they have a list of reasons

448
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,200
It could be and they just cross out everything except for the genetic argument

449
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:54,760
And then just leave it hanging there and trust the audience to make the leap for themselves

450
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:02,320
So what I do is just step in and force it to go to that position by

451
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,500
Claiming that is what they believe

452
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,860
deliberately heavy air quotes

453
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,860
misrepresenting their position

454
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,940
Because that forces them to

455
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:21,740
Clarify by saying they do or do not believe and then you've sort of neutered the tactic there because you've taken it to a place

456
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:26,720
Where they didn't want to go because they were deliberately avoiding it

457
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:32,940
It's something I've done in videos before if someone's being very coy about what they actually believe

458
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:39,480
I just pick a position for them and say that's what they believe because then it makes them say I don't believe that

459
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,900
It's something I've had success with

460
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:48,980
For instance with Stefan Molyneux like I have previously claimed Stefan Molyneux thinks women are inferior

461
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:56,460
Which he does, but he'd never admit to so I just like make the claim for him, and then that splits his audience

462
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,740
I've posted comments before that are like

463
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:05,620
One Stefan Molyneux fan being like he's never said he hates women that would be a ludicrous thing to say you're

464
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:11,900
Misrepresenting him and then the next comment is like he's right to hate women. They're weak and inferior. You know

465
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:19,660
Next question I noticed that sometimes in your response videos you play a lot of clips from the source and other times like in recent

466
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:25,500
Videos you don't is it about the time it takes to make a video editing wise or is it to do with the content?

467
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,700
You'd be quoting from them

468
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:32,540
Do you ever have misgivings about including clips of people saying slurs and hateful things and the impact it might have on your audience?

469
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:39,140
Yes, this is something I think about quite a lot, and I've definitely been experimenting more with

470
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:43,220
Just not including clips

471
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,940
Of other people talking when it's not

472
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:53,420
actually necessary and just summarizing their arguments for them and trusting my audience to

473
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,460
Go and view the original video if they doubt me there

474
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:05,440
Partially because I don't like spreading that content around even if I'm responding to it

475
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,520
You know like I don't like making people listen to black pigeon speaks for instance

476
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,500
so I've been

477
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:18,380
It's not anything to do with the video editing time because it's no time at all really to just drop clips

478
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:25,140
It probably takes more time to write and record me summarizing their arguments than to just put their clips in

479
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:30,260
But it's something I've been moving away from I used to get a lot comments like oh

480
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:36,940
I struggle to watch Sean's videos because he puts in long clips of like Molyneux or whoever

481
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,100
So yeah, I'm attempting to do it without for now

482
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,580
But who knows I might change my mind later

483
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:51,020
Next question your frog riddle argument relies on the assumption that the rate at which male frogs croak is

484
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,740
independent of the sexes of the other frogs as well as other factors

485
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,980
Since croaking is a social act closely tied to mating behavior

486
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:04,240
This assumption is dubious and either way cannot be a third from the information present in the riddle

487
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:09,940
There's no valid basis to assume that two male frogs are twice as likely to croak as one male frog

488
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:14,140
Rendering your argument invalid to summarize this as a question

489
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:20,140
Do you concede that the correct answer to the frog riddle given only the information presented therein is two thirds?

490
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,940
This again, right

491
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,420
No, I don't agree. I

492
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:32,780
Think that if we start making assumptions about the croaking such as it's tied to mating behavior

493
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:38,180
Then the croaking would actually increase if it was a male-female pair

494
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,180
It would be more likely to occur than if it were two males

495
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,860
Because they wouldn't be croaking at each other. It wouldn't be two-thirds

496
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,860
It would actually be some other value

497
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:53,860
The problem here is that if you make the assumption that two male frogs are not

498
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:58,820
More likely than one male frog to make a croak over a given period

499
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,800
Then you have to explain why that is

500
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,960
And

501
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:11,320
The answer will invariably be something that makes the outcome of the riddle not be a fixed value

502
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:18,180
Anymore because it's information that we don't have like saying something like, you know frogs croak

503
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,500
when they're mating for instance

504
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,840
or

505
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:30,000
Saying two male frogs won't croak when they're in close proximity, which you know, maybe that's true

506
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,200
So two male frogs will be less likely to croak than one male frog

507
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,700
But that makes it the answer to the riddle not be two-thirds, doesn't it?

508
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:45,680
because it's if one you hear one frog croak, then you know that the other one is a female if

509
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,600
You say that two male frogs will croak around other male frogs

510
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:57,140
But not twice as likely then you have to account for why the fact that only one would croak and there just isn't the information

511
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,300
In the riddle, basically, it's not a good riddle

512
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:04,020
It's explained poorly. I was right. The riddle was wrong

513
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,540
You're all gonna have to wait for the inevitable hbomberguy video about the frog riddle that he's been threatening to make for a while

514
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,500
What's your favorite biscuit?

515
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,900
I'm partial to some ginger nuts actually

516
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:26,500
Next question. What's your computer setup CPU GPU etc. Can you hear that plane? I live right next to the airport. It's terrible

517
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:33,580
I have a 1080 TI an i7 8700 K 16 gigs of RAM

518
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,520
and a bunch of solid-state hard drives

519
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:44,420
Which is neat. I have a fairly good computer on the whole. I need it for streaming to be honest streaming's

520
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:48,180
Difficult it really taxes everything. I

521
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,500
Feel like there needs to be some sort of nah, they wouldn't make it good

522
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,340
I was thinking they should sell like they I don't know who they are either

523
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,540
They should sell like a streaming rig

524
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,380
specifically designed to stream games

525
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,380
instead of sort of forcing

526
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:13,200
You know one CPU to do the rendering of the game and the streaming of the game at the same time

527
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:17,540
the next question is who is the best fictional detective and

528
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:23,980
My question is why is this a question because it's obviously Columbo

529
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:28,840
Columbo is by far and away the best fictional detective. He's brilliant

530
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:35,600
The next question is are you planning on doing more videos like the problem with privatizing the railways?

531
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:42,820
Yes, I am I have a couple more of those plans and I said at the start of the year that I'd like to make more

532
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,500
videos like that

533
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,500
But things just keep getting in the way

534
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,700
They take quite a long time to research those ones

535
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:56,420
I still I'm going to make those videos, but it's just when I get around to them. Basically. I've got one about

536
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,780
Schools in the works and then one about health. That's

537
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:06,300
That's just like a skeleton plan for now, but the school one is pretty far along

538
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:11,620
I could do that like next month really if I wanted to maybe I will I don't know

539
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:16,020
I've learned not to make predictions about when my videos are gonna come out anymore

540
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:22,500
because invariably something gets in the way or I change my mind like a month later or

541
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,340
some terrible

542
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,580
Technical problem happens that pushes the release date back

543
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,920
Never listen to me if I say a video is going to be out by a particular date

544
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:36,500
It almost certainly won't be next question

545
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:42,540
I want to know what is your opinion about people of the upper class who support the ideas of the left?

546
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:48,140
I ask because I'm from the upper class. My parents have given me many opportunities in life

547
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:55,000
Which does not mean that I believe these opportunities were deserved and I feel conflicted about my support for the abolishment of inheritance

548
00:42:55,580 --> 00:43:00,700
Because even if I'm completely in favor of it if my inheritance disappeared, I don't know what I'd do

549
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:06,980
On the other hand, I think that if there was a certainty that I would not die of hunger or cold in the future

550
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,420
I would not mind at all what happens to my parents money

551
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,660
Yes, well you nailed it at the end there

552
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:19,860
I think this is an example of a situation in which when we say we support something we need to clarify our

553
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:25,700
Sort of broader political goals as well because if you say I support

554
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:31,780
Abolishing inheritance and then nothing else a lot of people are gonna be very put off by that obviously

555
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:36,220
But if it didn't matter if inheritance was abolished because no one would ever

556
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:40,920
Want for a place to stay or food or heating or such?

557
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:45,020
Then people would be a lot more on board with it for a lot of these sorts of issues

558
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:51,400
It's better to explain your full world view and how your opinion on the particular issue fits into it

559
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:57,880
Rather than just saying, you know, I support abolishing inheritance and that's it similarly with

560
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:04,380
Saying you want to abolish private property. I mean if you just say that in isolation a lot of people assume

561
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:11,400
You mean you want to come to their house and steal their car and their pets and things like that

562
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,920
Which obviously isn't how it works. So I guess what I'm saying is we should push for the full package really

563
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:24,000
Hey Sean, this is a pretty stupid question, but I plan to move to the UK at some point in my life soon

564
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:29,300
Would you advise against it and you'll have any suggestions for a cheap but good place to live?

565
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,840
Wow, okay, I

566
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:38,640
would advise waiting for now and seeing how brexit turns out it's

567
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:45,040
Right now we're looking at the quotes hard brexit

568
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,120
Which means the whole country is going to explode

569
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:57,320
If you do if you have to move here for whatever horrible reason I would look at places in

570
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,040
maybe

571
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:04,760
Wales or Scotland and not England and if you do have to live in England

572
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,580
I would probably suggest somewhere outside of London

573
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,080
Just because it's so expensive there, you know

574
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,600
Either way best of luck to you. You're gonna need it

575
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:21,140
Next question. Do you tend to get more enjoyment from multiplayer?

576
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:28,480
systems driven games where you spend many hours perfecting your play or from games that take you through a story or adventure once and then

577
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,720
You're done with it

578
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:33,600
Well, I'm very boring here and don't really have a preference. I

579
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,260
Like plenty of games that fall into both of those categories

580
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:43,260
And what I think makes the game good or bad in this regard is if it knows exactly what it is and

581
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:51,220
Like the worst of both worlds here is a game that should be a short story driven thing

582
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,700
but

583
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,260
unnecessarily tacks on a bunch of like

584
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,220
customization level up

585
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,420
grindy nonsense

586
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,700
In order to slow the whole game down and just pad the runtime

587
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:08,980
So I can like either of these I just like them when they're well designed

588
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:15,300
For what they are. So I guess what I'm saying is is I like good video games and not bad ones

589
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:22,140
That's my brave opinion for today. Next question. Is the voice you use in your videos your real voice?

590
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,380
Mostly I

591
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,880
Guess I don't put on an accent or anything

592
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:34,480
But in most of my videos I'm reading from my prepared script I'm not in this one

593
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,480
which is why I'm umming and ahhing and

594
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:44,080
Speaking slower than you might be used to hearing me. But mostly yeah, I sound like this IRL I suppose

595
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,340
next question who is Jen and

596
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:52,980
I still get asked this quite a lot. I took Jen's name off the YouTube channel and everything

597
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:59,780
I still get asked who Jen is like all the time and it's so easy to find out but people keep asking me it

598
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:04,900
So actually I'm gonna throw this one over to Jen. Hello. I'm Jen

599
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:08,660
I am NOT a body pillow or a hand. I am Sean's friend

600
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:14,220
I am NOT in the YouTube videos anymore except for this one because nobody believes I am real

601
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:18,980
If you like me, you should watch our regular live streams on our twitch channel

602
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:22,820
Twitch.tv slash Sean and Jen, okay

603
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:29,580
So there we go. That was Jen why she chose to read that out. Like I forced her to at gunpoint

604
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:32,220
I don't know. So thanks for that Jen

605
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:39,700
Yeah, okay folks. That's all for me today. Thanks a lot as always for watching and subscribing all

606
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:45,100
100,000 of you that is rather scary, isn't it?

607
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,620
Yes

608
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:51,140
100,000 people

609
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:53,580
Wow, let's get to a million

610
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:58,260
Then then I'll really be scared when we get to a million Wow ten times

611
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,260
So it took me like a couple years to get here

612
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,460
So it's gonna take me a couple of decades to get to a million

613
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:07,140
Assuming like steady growth like it has been going Wow

614
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,300
So I'll be like 50

615
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:15,500
Let's see if I can get to a million subscribers before I'm 50

616
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:21,980
Will I still be doing this when I'm 50 I I don't know if I'm happy about that or not actually I

617
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:25,840
Mean, I like doing it, but am I gonna like doing this when I'm 50?

618
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:31,900
This is the conversations I have with myself off microphone. Okay

619
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,860
Thanks a lot folks. I'll see you next time
