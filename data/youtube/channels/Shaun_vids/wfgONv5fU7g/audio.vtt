00:00.000 --> 00:04.600
Hello, everyone. As you can see from the video game filler in the background there,

00:04.600 --> 00:08.600
this is another Q&A video, but a little different this time.

00:08.600 --> 00:15.120
You see, recently I put out a video in which I called for more people to start creating their own content on YouTube.

00:15.120 --> 00:22.680
And now after I did that, my Twitter and Curious Cat accounts got minorly bombarded by questions from people who wanted to get started,

00:22.920 --> 00:24.320
which is great.

00:24.320 --> 00:29.840
So this is just a little video to answer a few of those questions and hopefully help people who are starting out.

00:30.520 --> 00:33.400
I was asked a lot of similar questions multiple times,

00:33.400 --> 00:39.200
so I'll be going over the most common ones here first before answering a few more specific ones at the end.

00:39.720 --> 00:45.960
But before I start, I should say, I can only really go into detail about how I personally make videos.

00:46.080 --> 00:50.640
Everyone has different approaches and finds different things helpful, and like anything else,

00:50.640 --> 00:57.840
I'd say the best way to learn about it is by doing it. With that said, first up, I'll answer the various technical questions

00:57.880 --> 01:03.160
I was asked about equipment and software and so on, and I'll talk about pricing first, I guess.

01:03.160 --> 01:10.160
So one question I've been asked is, is it worth me starting out making content before I have an expensive microphone

01:10.680 --> 01:13.120
like you have? Which made me laugh.

01:13.680 --> 01:19.760
So this is the microphone I still use, a Behringer XM1800S.

01:19.760 --> 01:23.960
As you can see there, it is free for £31 on Amazon.

01:24.240 --> 01:31.360
Now, I have that running into a BTEC BT26 preamp, which is £25 on Amazon,

01:31.360 --> 01:33.520
and for additional audio equipment,

01:33.520 --> 01:36.880
I have a couple of microphone stands that were about £10 each,

01:37.240 --> 01:40.080
a bunch of sound paneling to reduce the echo in the room,

01:40.080 --> 01:44.960
but the price for that will vary depending on how much of it you need, that's if you need it at all.

01:45.400 --> 01:49.160
And of course, you'll need the various wires and things to connect all that together.

01:50.040 --> 01:57.640
All in all, I'd estimate you could replicate my current audio setup for about £100, or about $140.

01:57.920 --> 02:01.400
Though this is assuming you already have a computer to record on,

02:01.720 --> 02:04.800
and I will point out that if you want to actually appear in your videos,

02:04.800 --> 02:10.400
you'll need to add a camera and probably lighting to that as well. I can't really help you there, unfortunately.

02:11.200 --> 02:15.480
So that's my basic audio setup there. Now, is it great?

02:16.360 --> 02:23.320
No, it's not. It's next on the list of things I need to upgrade, actually. However, it's also not that bad.

02:23.360 --> 02:26.240
You know, you can hear my voice fine, it's listenable,

02:26.240 --> 02:30.720
it's not too echoey, and I've managed to get to this point without having to change it.

02:31.040 --> 02:36.800
Now, obviously, if you have the income to spare, you can buy better and more expensive versions of all the things

02:36.800 --> 02:43.000
I just mentioned, but if you don't, it's perfectly possible to start out with something similar to my bare bones setup there.

02:43.240 --> 02:50.120
My one piece of possibly snobbish audio advice I'll hand out is to stay away from USB audio devices,

02:50.600 --> 02:57.280
microphones, headsets, and so on. Now, obviously, different people will tell you different things, but I'm not a fan, personally.

02:57.280 --> 03:03.240
They don't sound the best, and even a cheap XLR slash preamp setup will usually be superior.

03:03.560 --> 03:09.160
That's in my experience, anyway. Now, software-wise, I record audio in Audacity,

03:09.200 --> 03:15.560
I edit video in Lightworks, and I capture footage for videos with OBS, which is a streaming software,

03:15.560 --> 03:20.240
but can also make local recordings. All of these are okay programs.

03:20.240 --> 03:23.360
I mean, they get the job done, and they're all free.

03:23.360 --> 03:28.560
I will say, if you're just starting out and you have access to a better video editor than Lightworks,

03:28.560 --> 03:33.000
I'd recommend learning to edit in that instead, because Lightworks can be a bit finicky.

03:33.280 --> 03:37.720
But if you don't have access to that, and you're not some sort of mega millionaire who can purchase

03:38.120 --> 03:43.800
professional editing software on a whim, Lightworks is a perfectly passable free alternative,

03:43.840 --> 03:48.060
so long as you're not looking to do anything too fancy very easily, anyway.

03:48.660 --> 03:54.260
So that's hardware and software there. I'll go into a few production tips here, although, again,

03:54.320 --> 03:58.720
the best way to learn is to do it for yourself. For recording audio,

03:59.320 --> 04:05.600
firstly, make sure there's no echo. If you're recording in a room with big, flat, empty walls and an uncarpeted floor,

04:05.600 --> 04:09.640
it is going to echo. Now, I have sound paneling now, but in the past,

04:09.640 --> 04:14.980
I would hang a duvet or some sheets around near the microphone while I recorded, and that worked just as well.

04:15.320 --> 04:18.800
When you're recording, sit up straight, take deep breaths,

04:19.080 --> 04:23.140
try not to fiddle with things or speak animatedly with your hands too much.

04:23.600 --> 04:28.200
Sit on a chair that doesn't creak when you move, like this one. Listen to this.

04:28.200 --> 04:34.680
Try to record all your audio in a set position without moving around too much or

04:34.920 --> 04:38.920
rearranging the microphone or different parts of your audio track will sound different.

04:38.920 --> 04:44.880
I actually just record all my audio for each video in a single sitting to try to circumvent this problem.

04:45.240 --> 04:50.300
Make sure you don't have a smartphone too close to your microphone or preamp or you'll get interference.

04:50.960 --> 04:55.860
Try to record somewhere quiet. I guess that's the main piece of advice there.

04:55.860 --> 05:03.540
I believe some libraries have recording booth bookings if your home environment is like completely unusable as far as audio goes,

05:03.540 --> 05:09.460
so maybe look into that if you have to. Next up is audio editing, which is very important.

05:09.460 --> 05:16.540
Now, obviously, as my recording setup is kind of cheap and basic, if I just record a track in Audacity and export it with no

05:16.540 --> 05:22.020
editing, it would sound fairly rubbish. In fact, it would sound like this.

05:22.380 --> 05:26.640
I'll read out the rest of this paragraph with no editing so you can see the difference.

05:26.740 --> 05:32.780
So how do we stop our audio from sounding like this? Well, in Audacity, or your editor of choice,

05:32.780 --> 05:37.440
I guess, we can apply different filters and effects. Now, the most important one

05:37.440 --> 05:44.100
I always use is noise reduction. At the start of every track I record, I leave a brief period of total silence,

05:44.700 --> 05:46.700
which looks like this,

05:46.740 --> 05:50.060
so that I can let the microphone get a sample of the background noise.

05:50.420 --> 05:56.860
Then if we select that part of the track, we can go to Effect, Noise Reduction, click Get Noise Profile,

05:57.020 --> 06:02.740
which will tell Audacity what you want it to remove, hit Effect, Repeat Noise Reduction, and

06:02.980 --> 06:05.560
say farewell to the background noise. There we go.

06:05.600 --> 06:12.660
Now, obviously, you'll have to play around with the various settings to get it sounding the best, depending on your recording equipment and space.

06:13.180 --> 06:19.260
I also use the normalize and equalize effects with particular settings relevant to my setup here,

06:19.260 --> 06:22.100
but I had to play about with those to get the right numbers,

06:22.100 --> 06:24.480
so experiment and see what works for you.

06:24.880 --> 06:32.460
And the rest of the editing is just cutting the track down to the usable parts, you know, cutting flubbed lines or coughs, weird clicks,

06:33.340 --> 06:39.900
shortening unusually long pauses, all that jazz. Now, I do this in Audacity before exporting the track,

06:39.900 --> 06:45.160
but obviously this is different if you're editing audio that has to be fit to video footage of you speaking.

06:45.320 --> 06:51.440
Any cuts there will have to match the video, or it will all be out of sync, so that's best done in the video editor.

06:51.880 --> 06:58.320
So, video editing tips. Well, you know, don't ask me. I'm not the best, as I'm sure you've noticed.

06:58.320 --> 07:05.200
I can do things, you know, I can make there be a picture of pyramids when I'm talking about pyramids.

07:05.800 --> 07:10.500
I can make that picture of pyramids spin around if I wanted to, or like,

07:11.060 --> 07:16.000
get really small and then slowly slide off the left of the screen.

07:16.460 --> 07:18.180
You know, I can do it,

07:18.180 --> 07:26.060
but mainly my video editing only extends to showing clips and pictures I happen to be talking about, and that's all fairly simple to learn,

07:26.060 --> 07:32.140
which is cool. But for actual advice I can give, first off, make sure you have a good folder system.

07:32.140 --> 07:35.220
I didn't know this at first, and everything got very messy.

07:35.580 --> 07:43.100
So now every project has its own folder, and then within that are folders for pictures, video clips, audio, and so on.

07:43.620 --> 07:51.740
In the actual editor, video editing for me boils down to dropping various clips and pictures onto the timeline at the right time.

07:52.460 --> 07:58.020
I import the audio track first and then add visuals to it. Now, other people will do it differently again.

07:58.460 --> 08:00.780
You'll have to see what works best for you.

08:00.900 --> 08:07.500
I won't really go into any specifics here, as it will depend on what editor you're using and the type of content you're trying to make,

08:07.500 --> 08:11.640
but there are plenty of great video editing tutorials here on YouTube,

08:11.640 --> 08:17.980
so give those a look. And in future, when you see a YouTuber you like use an effect that you'd like to know how to do,

08:18.220 --> 08:24.460
just have a Google of it and someone somewhere will have a tutorial for how to do it. Isn't the internet wonderful?

08:24.740 --> 08:29.220
So I realized a lot of my technical advice there kind of boiled down to Google it and

08:29.780 --> 08:34.380
experiment for yourself, so let's see if I'm any better at creative advice.

08:34.960 --> 08:38.720
Now, I was asked two particular questions multiple times here.

08:38.980 --> 08:45.980
How do I decide what to make videos about? And secondly, how do I know what I make will be worth watching?

08:46.460 --> 08:48.460
So to the second question,

08:49.180 --> 08:54.300
I don't know. You know, do you want to make the thing? You know, do you wish it existed?

08:54.300 --> 09:00.660
Would you watch it yourself? If so, you know, it's worth creating. And that's rather simple, that one.

09:01.180 --> 09:05.100
To the first question, how do I decide what to make videos about?

09:05.700 --> 09:07.700
Well, there's two main answers here.

09:07.840 --> 09:12.040
The first thing is something that you know about and you want to share with other people.

09:12.040 --> 09:16.340
I get a lot of questions from academic-type folks saying things like,

09:16.340 --> 09:19.140
I'm a historian or a biologist or whatever.

09:19.380 --> 09:24.840
Do you think it's worth me making videos about my area of expertise? And the answer is yes.

09:25.500 --> 09:31.140
More topics than you think can be video-ified, to use the accurate technical term there.

09:31.140 --> 09:37.620
The second thing I'd advise making videos about is something that you don't have expert knowledge of, but would like to learn more about.

09:38.260 --> 09:43.360
For instance, I learn a lot about each topic I cover as I'm putting the script together.

09:43.620 --> 09:48.660
It's a great learning experience by itself, and I've found it's good for the old mental health,

09:48.780 --> 09:52.540
to be working on some sort of ongoing creative project.

09:52.680 --> 09:58.380
So make videos about either things you do know about, or things you don't know about.

09:59.180 --> 10:01.180
That encompasses everything,

10:02.060 --> 10:09.880
doesn't it? I am terrible at giving advice. I've realized far too late in the production of this video though, so whatever. I'm pressing on.

10:10.780 --> 10:15.420
So I'll give a few creative tips relating to how I make videos here. Now again,

10:15.420 --> 10:18.940
these might be useless to someone with a different approach, but here we are.

10:19.260 --> 10:22.700
So first off, I keep a list of ideas on the go. Now,

10:22.700 --> 10:29.580
this is a .txt file on my computer with a list of video ideas, and I make notes on my phone or in a notebook

10:29.580 --> 10:33.820
if something comes to me when I'm on the train or whatever. Now, it seems simple,

10:33.820 --> 10:38.340
but if you don't do this, you will definitely forget that great idea you had yesterday.

10:38.780 --> 10:43.780
So keep a pen and paper handy. This advice extends to each project too.

10:43.860 --> 10:50.820
Write everything even vaguely useful down as you go, and you can always cut out the unnecessary parts later. Now,

10:50.820 --> 10:54.660
I personally write scripts by, over the course of a week to a few weeks,

10:55.260 --> 11:01.460
making a big jumbled list of phrases and keywords and sentence fragments that are stand-ins for full paragraphs,

11:02.180 --> 11:05.180
written down as I think or read about the topic.

11:05.820 --> 11:11.660
Talking your ideas through with someone else can be really helpful too, as they will ask questions or raise additional points,

11:11.660 --> 11:15.940
and you can get a bit of a preview of how an audience is going to respond to what you're saying.

11:16.300 --> 11:22.020
So anyway, I have my big jumbled mess. Now, after I run out of material or

11:22.660 --> 11:28.700
things to research or when I decide to stop because otherwise my video will be four hours long,

11:28.700 --> 11:31.700
I take the mess and I start editing it.

11:31.700 --> 11:37.900
I first cut and paste relevant sections together until they're structured in some sort of narrative order.

11:38.380 --> 11:42.780
I write an introduction with leading questions that will be answered in the rest of the video.

11:42.780 --> 11:47.400
I cut out any parts that don't fit or I decide aren't worth the time to go into.

11:47.900 --> 11:54.500
So then when it finally comes time to actually write the script out fully, it's a simple process of fleshing out the skeleton structure

11:54.500 --> 12:02.020
that's already there. Now, this is all fairly basic essay writing advice aimed at making a particular type of video.

12:02.260 --> 12:05.340
But there are lots of different approaches for different types of videos.

12:05.620 --> 12:10.900
Some people work better when they're less structured, but I like to have everything written out.

12:11.420 --> 12:17.300
So again, experiment and see what works for you. I realize I'm saying that a lot today, but oh well.

12:17.340 --> 12:23.580
I'll move on to answering some more specific questions here, which are more about the culture of YouTube, I guess.

12:23.820 --> 12:26.140
So a curious cat user asked,

12:36.340 --> 12:42.420
How do you deal with the intense amount of backlash related to being left-wing and pro-feminist on YouTube?

12:42.420 --> 12:46.660
And this question was echoed by a few other people, including someone who says,

12:46.660 --> 12:52.100
I've been considering making a political YouTube channel, but I am afraid of doxxing and the likes.

12:52.100 --> 12:59.700
I feel especially exposed to it because of the various minority groups I'm part of. Not straight, not a man, etc.

13:00.260 --> 13:06.480
Any safety advice or uplifting pep talk? So okay, brigading videos,

13:07.060 --> 13:14.860
abuse, doxxing and the likes. It happens, it sucks, and there isn't a short or easy way around it, unfortunately.

13:15.500 --> 13:22.100
Now, I'm not too worried about down-voting campaigns. They're actually good for your channel, strictly numbers-wise.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.240
It brings in a lot of views and interaction.

13:25.100 --> 13:29.940
Likewise, in my experience, the false flagging of my videos has worked out pretty well for me.

13:30.260 --> 13:34.740
The one time a group of angry lads got a video of mine taken down through mass flagging,

13:34.740 --> 13:41.580
I saw a big increase in subscribers and views. And then, of course, because the flagging was not warranted, the video was then

13:41.940 --> 13:46.100
reinstated, so I didn't lose anything, and it actually worked out okay.

13:46.540 --> 13:50.260
Now, there isn't really a nice side to the abuse itself, unfortunately.

13:51.220 --> 13:54.580
And I actually get it pretty easy, all things considered.

13:54.580 --> 14:00.900
All I'd say is don't feel bad about blocking or muting people who are arguing in bad faith.

14:01.920 --> 14:08.340
Particularly starting out, you're gonna be reading all your YouTube comments and messages and the likes, but that gets old very fast.

14:08.540 --> 14:12.980
You shouldn't waste your time engaging with trolls who are only there to annoy you.

14:13.460 --> 14:19.820
Now, the worst of the things that happens is the doxxing and attempting to mess with your personal life somehow.

14:20.540 --> 14:24.660
Luckily, it is only a very small minority of people who engage in this sort of behavior,

14:25.300 --> 14:28.980
but it does happen. If you develop enough of a presence online,

14:28.980 --> 14:32.940
there will be people who try to find out your address or guess your passwords.

14:33.740 --> 14:39.820
Social engineer their way into getting the reset question for your backup email that you haven't logged into in five years,

14:39.820 --> 14:45.940
you know, all that sort of thing. So before starting out, I'd say prepare yourself for that to happen.

14:46.780 --> 14:53.540
Create a fresh email address for your channel and associated other social media accounts. Use a new, long,

14:54.220 --> 14:58.780
complicated password, and be aware of your previous history on the internet.

14:58.780 --> 15:05.400
You know, did you used to have a DeviantArt account where you drew Mario licking Sonic's feet or something?

15:05.620 --> 15:12.380
If you don't do anything about that, the first person you piss off is going to find it and email it to your parents.

15:12.580 --> 15:19.800
So any old social media accounts you don't use, log into them and deactivate them, and put the ones you do use on the highest

15:20.160 --> 15:27.500
security settings. If there's something you've done in the past that would be embarrassing to be revealed about you, be upfront about it early on.

15:27.740 --> 15:34.000
Part of the reason why I keep mentioning I was a little shithead troll years ago is if anyone ever finds a bunch of

15:34.000 --> 15:40.300
posts of mine where I've said some air quotes edgy racist or sexist crap, which I did frequently,

15:40.820 --> 15:47.000
I've already addressed that. For tips on trying to avoid this kind of extreme negative attention,

15:47.000 --> 15:49.500
I'd just say mainly be boring.

15:49.500 --> 15:56.100
You know, don't give them what they want. The people who engage in this sort of behavior just want a target, and they don't really

15:56.100 --> 16:02.300
care who it is. If you give them the attention they want, they will follow you around and try to make you do it again.

16:02.620 --> 16:06.380
So just hammer that mute button, I guess. Let's move on.

16:06.860 --> 16:08.180
Another user asks,

16:08.180 --> 16:13.100
How do you get past the fear that your videos won't be good enough or as good as you want them to be?

16:13.620 --> 16:19.340
And the answer to that is you don't, or at least I don't. I see the flaws in everything

16:19.340 --> 16:24.860
I make, and they'll never be as good as I want them to be, but that fear is not a good reason to stop.

16:25.500 --> 16:28.580
Just try to make the next thing better than the last thing was.

16:29.060 --> 16:30.140
Someone else asks,

16:30.140 --> 16:35.140
How do you decide when you have something worth saying or maybe more accurately worth listening to?

16:35.300 --> 16:40.660
I've thought about trying out getting going on YouTube, but it's hard to know if I'd have anything of value to share.

16:41.380 --> 16:47.380
First off, I'm sure you do have something of value to share, but for me this process happens topic by topic.

16:48.180 --> 16:54.260
There are videos I've abandoned if I realize that the approach I'm taking doesn't work, or there isn't enough material,

16:54.300 --> 16:59.580
or whatever else. You know, you won't know until you try, I guess I'm saying. Someone else asks,

16:59.580 --> 17:02.020
Hey Sean, I'm currently setting up a YouTube channel.

17:02.020 --> 17:09.300
My first video happens to be about a popular YouTube skeptic spreading misinformation about the Holocaust and bordering denial.

17:09.300 --> 17:15.220
I keep asking myself if I should touch this topic at all, or if there are certain things that should be off-limits

17:15.700 --> 17:19.180
even when correcting Holocaust deniers. What are your thoughts on this?

17:19.620 --> 17:24.180
So this is something I've been thinking about a lot lately, and here's where I'm at with it right now.

17:24.700 --> 17:32.700
You can make a video countering something like Holocaust denial or some other similarly difficult subject, as long as you're kind of careful.

17:33.300 --> 17:36.660
First off, I'd say you should aim upwards in terms of audiences.

17:36.660 --> 17:39.020
You know, if you have a million subscribers,

17:39.020 --> 17:46.220
it might be irresponsible to expose them to some obscure Holocaust deniers arguments, even for the purposes of debunking them.

17:46.260 --> 17:50.700
So probably only respond to people with a larger audience than yourself,

17:50.700 --> 17:55.660
and you can debunk an argument without providing a platform to any one person.

17:55.660 --> 17:58.020
So talk about fascists all you want,

17:58.020 --> 18:05.500
but don't have them on the show for a friendly chat. And if you ever make a video trying to explain their views and arguments,

18:05.700 --> 18:08.260
include very clear and unambiguous

18:08.780 --> 18:14.380
refutations to those arguments. You know, don't give them an inch, basically, or you'll be doing their job for them.

18:14.580 --> 18:15.940
Another user asks,

18:23.940 --> 18:25.940
To answer that, just dive right in.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.820
Well, that was an easy one.

18:28.820 --> 18:30.260
Another user asks,

18:44.380 --> 18:52.020
So I'd say the big issue here is your concern about your videos no longer being relevant,

18:52.020 --> 18:58.100
and you shouldn't be worried about that, really, unless you're making a channel that reacts to daily news or something.

18:58.100 --> 19:03.180
I made a video about the shooting of Trayvon Martin, like, five years after it happened.

19:03.260 --> 19:07.820
I'm working on a video about the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally right now.

19:07.820 --> 19:11.820
You know, there's something to be said for missing the immediate response window,

19:11.860 --> 19:14.860
and instead just getting the last word and later on.

19:15.300 --> 19:21.460
So maybe try being less concerned about staying current, or develop content that is just timeless.

19:21.460 --> 19:26.620
You know, I've made videos about Roman history, for instance. It doesn't really matter when they came out, you know.

19:26.780 --> 19:28.100
Another user asks,

19:35.700 --> 19:37.100
I find this comes with time.

19:37.500 --> 19:43.500
You know, if you pick any YouTuber who sounds confident now and scroll to their old videos, they'll probably all sound totally different.

19:43.700 --> 19:47.780
So make ten videos and then see if you still sound nervous, I guess.

19:48.380 --> 19:49.500
Someone else asks,

19:57.500 --> 20:00.020
And yes, that's completely fine.

20:00.020 --> 20:04.420
You know, you can just put out political content and ignore all the rest of the rubbish if you like.

20:04.460 --> 20:08.740
It'd probably be good for your mental health in the long run as well, so, yeah, go for it.

20:09.180 --> 20:14.140
Finally, I was also asked a few questions about how to get views and subscribers and all that.

20:14.140 --> 20:16.860
Now, I'm probably not the best person to answer this.

20:17.420 --> 20:22.420
For me, it was about two years of producing video content before I broke a thousand subscribers.

20:22.980 --> 20:26.980
Before doing political stuff, I was making kinda rubbish game videos.

20:27.220 --> 20:30.380
And then before that, I had another YouTube channel that I ran for a year,

20:30.740 --> 20:34.220
and that never really saw a sizeable audience of any kind.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.420
I kept up with making videos because I found it fun.

20:37.420 --> 20:41.420
It's an enjoyable hobby for me, so just keep on trucking, basically.

20:41.660 --> 20:47.140
If you enjoy it, then just focus on improving, and eventually, if you're kinda lucky,

20:47.140 --> 20:54.540
like I was, you'll eventually hit some sort of self-perpetuating snowball increase that will leave you very confused.

20:55.220 --> 21:03.220
For more active advice, though, get a Twitter account and interact a bunch with the sorts of people who you think might like and share your videos.

21:03.540 --> 21:07.860
The first step to getting a big audience is getting a little audience.

21:08.340 --> 21:10.140
That's gonna be all from me today, folks.

21:10.140 --> 21:13.140
Thanks a lot, I hope I answered all of your questions.

21:13.140 --> 21:19.700
If there's anything you really want to know that I missed, just head over to Twitter or Curious Cat and send me a question.

21:20.220 --> 21:22.700
Okay, thanks folks, and I'll see you next time.
