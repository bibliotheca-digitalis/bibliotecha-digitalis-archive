0	4600	Hello, everyone. As you can see from the video game filler in the background there,
4600	8600	this is another Q&A video, but a little different this time.
8600	15120	You see, recently I put out a video in which I called for more people to start creating their own content on YouTube.
15120	22680	And now after I did that, my Twitter and Curious Cat accounts got minorly bombarded by questions from people who wanted to get started,
22920	24320	which is great.
24320	29840	So this is just a little video to answer a few of those questions and hopefully help people who are starting out.
30520	33400	I was asked a lot of similar questions multiple times,
33400	39200	so I'll be going over the most common ones here first before answering a few more specific ones at the end.
39720	45960	But before I start, I should say, I can only really go into detail about how I personally make videos.
46080	50640	Everyone has different approaches and finds different things helpful, and like anything else,
50640	57840	I'd say the best way to learn about it is by doing it. With that said, first up, I'll answer the various technical questions
57880	63160	I was asked about equipment and software and so on, and I'll talk about pricing first, I guess.
63160	70160	So one question I've been asked is, is it worth me starting out making content before I have an expensive microphone
70680	73120	like you have? Which made me laugh.
73680	79760	So this is the microphone I still use, a Behringer XM1800S.
79760	83960	As you can see there, it is free for £31 on Amazon.
84240	91360	Now, I have that running into a BTEC BT26 preamp, which is £25 on Amazon,
91360	93520	and for additional audio equipment,
93520	96880	I have a couple of microphone stands that were about £10 each,
97240	100080	a bunch of sound paneling to reduce the echo in the room,
100080	104960	but the price for that will vary depending on how much of it you need, that's if you need it at all.
105400	109160	And of course, you'll need the various wires and things to connect all that together.
110040	117640	All in all, I'd estimate you could replicate my current audio setup for about £100, or about $140.
117920	121400	Though this is assuming you already have a computer to record on,
121720	124800	and I will point out that if you want to actually appear in your videos,
124800	130400	you'll need to add a camera and probably lighting to that as well. I can't really help you there, unfortunately.
131200	135480	So that's my basic audio setup there. Now, is it great?
136360	143320	No, it's not. It's next on the list of things I need to upgrade, actually. However, it's also not that bad.
143360	146240	You know, you can hear my voice fine, it's listenable,
146240	150720	it's not too echoey, and I've managed to get to this point without having to change it.
151040	156800	Now, obviously, if you have the income to spare, you can buy better and more expensive versions of all the things
156800	163000	I just mentioned, but if you don't, it's perfectly possible to start out with something similar to my bare bones setup there.
163240	170120	My one piece of possibly snobbish audio advice I'll hand out is to stay away from USB audio devices,
170600	177280	microphones, headsets, and so on. Now, obviously, different people will tell you different things, but I'm not a fan, personally.
177280	183240	They don't sound the best, and even a cheap XLR slash preamp setup will usually be superior.
183560	189160	That's in my experience, anyway. Now, software-wise, I record audio in Audacity,
189200	195560	I edit video in Lightworks, and I capture footage for videos with OBS, which is a streaming software,
195560	200240	but can also make local recordings. All of these are okay programs.
200240	203360	I mean, they get the job done, and they're all free.
203360	208560	I will say, if you're just starting out and you have access to a better video editor than Lightworks,
208560	213000	I'd recommend learning to edit in that instead, because Lightworks can be a bit finicky.
213280	217720	But if you don't have access to that, and you're not some sort of mega millionaire who can purchase
218120	223800	professional editing software on a whim, Lightworks is a perfectly passable free alternative,
223840	228060	so long as you're not looking to do anything too fancy very easily, anyway.
228660	234260	So that's hardware and software there. I'll go into a few production tips here, although, again,
234320	238720	the best way to learn is to do it for yourself. For recording audio,
239320	245600	firstly, make sure there's no echo. If you're recording in a room with big, flat, empty walls and an uncarpeted floor,
245600	249640	it is going to echo. Now, I have sound paneling now, but in the past,
249640	254980	I would hang a duvet or some sheets around near the microphone while I recorded, and that worked just as well.
255320	258800	When you're recording, sit up straight, take deep breaths,
259080	263140	try not to fiddle with things or speak animatedly with your hands too much.
263600	268200	Sit on a chair that doesn't creak when you move, like this one. Listen to this.
268200	274680	Try to record all your audio in a set position without moving around too much or
274920	278920	rearranging the microphone or different parts of your audio track will sound different.
278920	284880	I actually just record all my audio for each video in a single sitting to try to circumvent this problem.
285240	290300	Make sure you don't have a smartphone too close to your microphone or preamp or you'll get interference.
290960	295860	Try to record somewhere quiet. I guess that's the main piece of advice there.
295860	303540	I believe some libraries have recording booth bookings if your home environment is like completely unusable as far as audio goes,
303540	309460	so maybe look into that if you have to. Next up is audio editing, which is very important.
309460	316540	Now, obviously, as my recording setup is kind of cheap and basic, if I just record a track in Audacity and export it with no
316540	322020	editing, it would sound fairly rubbish. In fact, it would sound like this.
322380	326640	I'll read out the rest of this paragraph with no editing so you can see the difference.
326740	332780	So how do we stop our audio from sounding like this? Well, in Audacity, or your editor of choice,
332780	337440	I guess, we can apply different filters and effects. Now, the most important one
337440	344100	I always use is noise reduction. At the start of every track I record, I leave a brief period of total silence,
344700	346700	which looks like this,
346740	350060	so that I can let the microphone get a sample of the background noise.
350420	356860	Then if we select that part of the track, we can go to Effect, Noise Reduction, click Get Noise Profile,
357020	362740	which will tell Audacity what you want it to remove, hit Effect, Repeat Noise Reduction, and
362980	365560	say farewell to the background noise. There we go.
365600	372660	Now, obviously, you'll have to play around with the various settings to get it sounding the best, depending on your recording equipment and space.
373180	379260	I also use the normalize and equalize effects with particular settings relevant to my setup here,
379260	382100	but I had to play about with those to get the right numbers,
382100	384480	so experiment and see what works for you.
384880	392460	And the rest of the editing is just cutting the track down to the usable parts, you know, cutting flubbed lines or coughs, weird clicks,
393340	399900	shortening unusually long pauses, all that jazz. Now, I do this in Audacity before exporting the track,
399900	405160	but obviously this is different if you're editing audio that has to be fit to video footage of you speaking.
405320	411440	Any cuts there will have to match the video, or it will all be out of sync, so that's best done in the video editor.
411880	418320	So, video editing tips. Well, you know, don't ask me. I'm not the best, as I'm sure you've noticed.
418320	425200	I can do things, you know, I can make there be a picture of pyramids when I'm talking about pyramids.
425800	430500	I can make that picture of pyramids spin around if I wanted to, or like,
431060	436000	get really small and then slowly slide off the left of the screen.
436460	438180	You know, I can do it,
438180	446060	but mainly my video editing only extends to showing clips and pictures I happen to be talking about, and that's all fairly simple to learn,
446060	452140	which is cool. But for actual advice I can give, first off, make sure you have a good folder system.
452140	455220	I didn't know this at first, and everything got very messy.
455580	463100	So now every project has its own folder, and then within that are folders for pictures, video clips, audio, and so on.
463620	471740	In the actual editor, video editing for me boils down to dropping various clips and pictures onto the timeline at the right time.
472460	478020	I import the audio track first and then add visuals to it. Now, other people will do it differently again.
478460	480780	You'll have to see what works best for you.
480900	487500	I won't really go into any specifics here, as it will depend on what editor you're using and the type of content you're trying to make,
487500	491640	but there are plenty of great video editing tutorials here on YouTube,
491640	497980	so give those a look. And in future, when you see a YouTuber you like use an effect that you'd like to know how to do,
498220	504460	just have a Google of it and someone somewhere will have a tutorial for how to do it. Isn't the internet wonderful?
504740	509220	So I realized a lot of my technical advice there kind of boiled down to Google it and
509780	514380	experiment for yourself, so let's see if I'm any better at creative advice.
514960	518720	Now, I was asked two particular questions multiple times here.
518980	525980	How do I decide what to make videos about? And secondly, how do I know what I make will be worth watching?
526460	528460	So to the second question,
529180	534300	I don't know. You know, do you want to make the thing? You know, do you wish it existed?
534300	540660	Would you watch it yourself? If so, you know, it's worth creating. And that's rather simple, that one.
541180	545100	To the first question, how do I decide what to make videos about?
545700	547700	Well, there's two main answers here.
547840	552040	The first thing is something that you know about and you want to share with other people.
552040	556340	I get a lot of questions from academic-type folks saying things like,
556340	559140	I'm a historian or a biologist or whatever.
559380	564840	Do you think it's worth me making videos about my area of expertise? And the answer is yes.
565500	571140	More topics than you think can be video-ified, to use the accurate technical term there.
571140	577620	The second thing I'd advise making videos about is something that you don't have expert knowledge of, but would like to learn more about.
578260	583360	For instance, I learn a lot about each topic I cover as I'm putting the script together.
583620	588660	It's a great learning experience by itself, and I've found it's good for the old mental health,
588780	592540	to be working on some sort of ongoing creative project.
592680	598380	So make videos about either things you do know about, or things you don't know about.
599180	601180	That encompasses everything,
602060	609880	doesn't it? I am terrible at giving advice. I've realized far too late in the production of this video though, so whatever. I'm pressing on.
610780	615420	So I'll give a few creative tips relating to how I make videos here. Now again,
615420	618940	these might be useless to someone with a different approach, but here we are.
619260	622700	So first off, I keep a list of ideas on the go. Now,
622700	629580	this is a .txt file on my computer with a list of video ideas, and I make notes on my phone or in a notebook
629580	633820	if something comes to me when I'm on the train or whatever. Now, it seems simple,
633820	638340	but if you don't do this, you will definitely forget that great idea you had yesterday.
638780	643780	So keep a pen and paper handy. This advice extends to each project too.
643860	650820	Write everything even vaguely useful down as you go, and you can always cut out the unnecessary parts later. Now,
650820	654660	I personally write scripts by, over the course of a week to a few weeks,
655260	661460	making a big jumbled list of phrases and keywords and sentence fragments that are stand-ins for full paragraphs,
662180	665180	written down as I think or read about the topic.
665820	671660	Talking your ideas through with someone else can be really helpful too, as they will ask questions or raise additional points,
671660	675940	and you can get a bit of a preview of how an audience is going to respond to what you're saying.
676300	682020	So anyway, I have my big jumbled mess. Now, after I run out of material or
682660	688700	things to research or when I decide to stop because otherwise my video will be four hours long,
688700	691700	I take the mess and I start editing it.
691700	697900	I first cut and paste relevant sections together until they're structured in some sort of narrative order.
698380	702780	I write an introduction with leading questions that will be answered in the rest of the video.
702780	707400	I cut out any parts that don't fit or I decide aren't worth the time to go into.
707900	714500	So then when it finally comes time to actually write the script out fully, it's a simple process of fleshing out the skeleton structure
714500	722020	that's already there. Now, this is all fairly basic essay writing advice aimed at making a particular type of video.
722260	725340	But there are lots of different approaches for different types of videos.
725620	730900	Some people work better when they're less structured, but I like to have everything written out.
731420	737300	So again, experiment and see what works for you. I realize I'm saying that a lot today, but oh well.
737340	743580	I'll move on to answering some more specific questions here, which are more about the culture of YouTube, I guess.
743820	746140	So a curious cat user asked,
756340	762420	How do you deal with the intense amount of backlash related to being left-wing and pro-feminist on YouTube?
762420	766660	And this question was echoed by a few other people, including someone who says,
766660	772100	I've been considering making a political YouTube channel, but I am afraid of doxxing and the likes.
772100	779700	I feel especially exposed to it because of the various minority groups I'm part of. Not straight, not a man, etc.
780260	786480	Any safety advice or uplifting pep talk? So okay, brigading videos,
787060	794860	abuse, doxxing and the likes. It happens, it sucks, and there isn't a short or easy way around it, unfortunately.
795500	802100	Now, I'm not too worried about down-voting campaigns. They're actually good for your channel, strictly numbers-wise.
802100	804240	It brings in a lot of views and interaction.
805100	809940	Likewise, in my experience, the false flagging of my videos has worked out pretty well for me.
810260	814740	The one time a group of angry lads got a video of mine taken down through mass flagging,
814740	821580	I saw a big increase in subscribers and views. And then, of course, because the flagging was not warranted, the video was then
821940	826100	reinstated, so I didn't lose anything, and it actually worked out okay.
826540	830260	Now, there isn't really a nice side to the abuse itself, unfortunately.
831220	834580	And I actually get it pretty easy, all things considered.
834580	840900	All I'd say is don't feel bad about blocking or muting people who are arguing in bad faith.
841920	848340	Particularly starting out, you're gonna be reading all your YouTube comments and messages and the likes, but that gets old very fast.
848540	852980	You shouldn't waste your time engaging with trolls who are only there to annoy you.
853460	859820	Now, the worst of the things that happens is the doxxing and attempting to mess with your personal life somehow.
860540	864660	Luckily, it is only a very small minority of people who engage in this sort of behavior,
865300	868980	but it does happen. If you develop enough of a presence online,
868980	872940	there will be people who try to find out your address or guess your passwords.
873740	879820	Social engineer their way into getting the reset question for your backup email that you haven't logged into in five years,
879820	885940	you know, all that sort of thing. So before starting out, I'd say prepare yourself for that to happen.
886780	893540	Create a fresh email address for your channel and associated other social media accounts. Use a new, long,
894220	898780	complicated password, and be aware of your previous history on the internet.
898780	905400	You know, did you used to have a DeviantArt account where you drew Mario licking Sonic's feet or something?
905620	912380	If you don't do anything about that, the first person you piss off is going to find it and email it to your parents.
912580	919800	So any old social media accounts you don't use, log into them and deactivate them, and put the ones you do use on the highest
920160	927500	security settings. If there's something you've done in the past that would be embarrassing to be revealed about you, be upfront about it early on.
927740	934000	Part of the reason why I keep mentioning I was a little shithead troll years ago is if anyone ever finds a bunch of
934000	940300	posts of mine where I've said some air quotes edgy racist or sexist crap, which I did frequently,
940820	947000	I've already addressed that. For tips on trying to avoid this kind of extreme negative attention,
947000	949500	I'd just say mainly be boring.
949500	956100	You know, don't give them what they want. The people who engage in this sort of behavior just want a target, and they don't really
956100	962300	care who it is. If you give them the attention they want, they will follow you around and try to make you do it again.
962620	966380	So just hammer that mute button, I guess. Let's move on.
966860	968180	Another user asks,
968180	973100	How do you get past the fear that your videos won't be good enough or as good as you want them to be?
973620	979340	And the answer to that is you don't, or at least I don't. I see the flaws in everything
979340	984860	I make, and they'll never be as good as I want them to be, but that fear is not a good reason to stop.
985500	988580	Just try to make the next thing better than the last thing was.
989060	990140	Someone else asks,
990140	995140	How do you decide when you have something worth saying or maybe more accurately worth listening to?
995300	1000660	I've thought about trying out getting going on YouTube, but it's hard to know if I'd have anything of value to share.
1001380	1007380	First off, I'm sure you do have something of value to share, but for me this process happens topic by topic.
1008180	1014260	There are videos I've abandoned if I realize that the approach I'm taking doesn't work, or there isn't enough material,
1014300	1019580	or whatever else. You know, you won't know until you try, I guess I'm saying. Someone else asks,
1019580	1022020	Hey Sean, I'm currently setting up a YouTube channel.
1022020	1029300	My first video happens to be about a popular YouTube skeptic spreading misinformation about the Holocaust and bordering denial.
1029300	1035220	I keep asking myself if I should touch this topic at all, or if there are certain things that should be off-limits
1035700	1039180	even when correcting Holocaust deniers. What are your thoughts on this?
1039620	1044180	So this is something I've been thinking about a lot lately, and here's where I'm at with it right now.
1044700	1052700	You can make a video countering something like Holocaust denial or some other similarly difficult subject, as long as you're kind of careful.
1053300	1056660	First off, I'd say you should aim upwards in terms of audiences.
1056660	1059020	You know, if you have a million subscribers,
1059020	1066220	it might be irresponsible to expose them to some obscure Holocaust deniers arguments, even for the purposes of debunking them.
1066260	1070700	So probably only respond to people with a larger audience than yourself,
1070700	1075660	and you can debunk an argument without providing a platform to any one person.
1075660	1078020	So talk about fascists all you want,
1078020	1085500	but don't have them on the show for a friendly chat. And if you ever make a video trying to explain their views and arguments,
1085700	1088260	include very clear and unambiguous
1088780	1094380	refutations to those arguments. You know, don't give them an inch, basically, or you'll be doing their job for them.
1094580	1095940	Another user asks,
1103940	1105940	To answer that, just dive right in.
1106940	1108820	Well, that was an easy one.
1108820	1110260	Another user asks,
1124380	1132020	So I'd say the big issue here is your concern about your videos no longer being relevant,
1132020	1138100	and you shouldn't be worried about that, really, unless you're making a channel that reacts to daily news or something.
1138100	1143180	I made a video about the shooting of Trayvon Martin, like, five years after it happened.
1143260	1147820	I'm working on a video about the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally right now.
1147820	1151820	You know, there's something to be said for missing the immediate response window,
1151860	1154860	and instead just getting the last word and later on.
1155300	1161460	So maybe try being less concerned about staying current, or develop content that is just timeless.
1161460	1166620	You know, I've made videos about Roman history, for instance. It doesn't really matter when they came out, you know.
1166780	1168100	Another user asks,
1175700	1177100	I find this comes with time.
1177500	1183500	You know, if you pick any YouTuber who sounds confident now and scroll to their old videos, they'll probably all sound totally different.
1183700	1187780	So make ten videos and then see if you still sound nervous, I guess.
1188380	1189500	Someone else asks,
1197500	1200020	And yes, that's completely fine.
1200020	1204420	You know, you can just put out political content and ignore all the rest of the rubbish if you like.
1204460	1208740	It'd probably be good for your mental health in the long run as well, so, yeah, go for it.
1209180	1214140	Finally, I was also asked a few questions about how to get views and subscribers and all that.
1214140	1216860	Now, I'm probably not the best person to answer this.
1217420	1222420	For me, it was about two years of producing video content before I broke a thousand subscribers.
1222980	1226980	Before doing political stuff, I was making kinda rubbish game videos.
1227220	1230380	And then before that, I had another YouTube channel that I ran for a year,
1230740	1234220	and that never really saw a sizeable audience of any kind.
1234900	1237420	I kept up with making videos because I found it fun.
1237420	1241420	It's an enjoyable hobby for me, so just keep on trucking, basically.
1241660	1247140	If you enjoy it, then just focus on improving, and eventually, if you're kinda lucky,
1247140	1254540	like I was, you'll eventually hit some sort of self-perpetuating snowball increase that will leave you very confused.
1255220	1263220	For more active advice, though, get a Twitter account and interact a bunch with the sorts of people who you think might like and share your videos.
1263540	1267860	The first step to getting a big audience is getting a little audience.
1268340	1270140	That's gonna be all from me today, folks.
1270140	1273140	Thanks a lot, I hope I answered all of your questions.
1273140	1279700	If there's anything you really want to know that I missed, just head over to Twitter or Curious Cat and send me a question.
1280220	1282700	Okay, thanks folks, and I'll see you next time.
