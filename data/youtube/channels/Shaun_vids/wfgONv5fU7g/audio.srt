00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
Hello, everyone. As you can see from the video game filler in the background there,

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,600
this is another Q&A video, but a little different this time.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:15,120
You see, recently I put out a video in which I called for more people to start creating their own content on YouTube.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:22,680
And now after I did that, my Twitter and Curious Cat accounts got minorly bombarded by questions from people who wanted to get started,

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,320
which is great.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,840
So this is just a little video to answer a few of those questions and hopefully help people who are starting out.

7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,400
I was asked a lot of similar questions multiple times,

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:39,200
so I'll be going over the most common ones here first before answering a few more specific ones at the end.

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:45,960
But before I start, I should say, I can only really go into detail about how I personally make videos.

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,640
Everyone has different approaches and finds different things helpful, and like anything else,

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,840
I'd say the best way to learn about it is by doing it. With that said, first up, I'll answer the various technical questions

12
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:03,160
I was asked about equipment and software and so on, and I'll talk about pricing first, I guess.

13
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:10,160
So one question I've been asked is, is it worth me starting out making content before I have an expensive microphone

14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,120
like you have? Which made me laugh.

15
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,760
So this is the microphone I still use, a Behringer XM1800S.

16
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,960
As you can see there, it is free for £31 on Amazon.

17
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:31,360
Now, I have that running into a BTEC BT26 preamp, which is £25 on Amazon,

18
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,520
and for additional audio equipment,

19
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,880
I have a couple of microphone stands that were about £10 each,

20
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,080
a bunch of sound paneling to reduce the echo in the room,

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,960
but the price for that will vary depending on how much of it you need, that's if you need it at all.

22
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,160
And of course, you'll need the various wires and things to connect all that together.

23
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:57,640
All in all, I'd estimate you could replicate my current audio setup for about £100, or about $140.

24
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,400
Though this is assuming you already have a computer to record on,

25
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,800
and I will point out that if you want to actually appear in your videos,

26
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,400
you'll need to add a camera and probably lighting to that as well. I can't really help you there, unfortunately.

27
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,480
So that's my basic audio setup there. Now, is it great?

28
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:23,320
No, it's not. It's next on the list of things I need to upgrade, actually. However, it's also not that bad.

29
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,240
You know, you can hear my voice fine, it's listenable,

30
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,720
it's not too echoey, and I've managed to get to this point without having to change it.

31
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,800
Now, obviously, if you have the income to spare, you can buy better and more expensive versions of all the things

32
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,000
I just mentioned, but if you don't, it's perfectly possible to start out with something similar to my bare bones setup there.

33
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:50,120
My one piece of possibly snobbish audio advice I'll hand out is to stay away from USB audio devices,

34
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:57,280
microphones, headsets, and so on. Now, obviously, different people will tell you different things, but I'm not a fan, personally.

35
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,240
They don't sound the best, and even a cheap XLR slash preamp setup will usually be superior.

36
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,160
That's in my experience, anyway. Now, software-wise, I record audio in Audacity,

37
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,560
I edit video in Lightworks, and I capture footage for videos with OBS, which is a streaming software,

38
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,240
but can also make local recordings. All of these are okay programs.

39
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,360
I mean, they get the job done, and they're all free.

40
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,560
I will say, if you're just starting out and you have access to a better video editor than Lightworks,

41
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,000
I'd recommend learning to edit in that instead, because Lightworks can be a bit finicky.

42
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,720
But if you don't have access to that, and you're not some sort of mega millionaire who can purchase

43
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,800
professional editing software on a whim, Lightworks is a perfectly passable free alternative,

44
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,060
so long as you're not looking to do anything too fancy very easily, anyway.

45
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:54,260
So that's hardware and software there. I'll go into a few production tips here, although, again,

46
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,720
the best way to learn is to do it for yourself. For recording audio,

47
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:05,600
firstly, make sure there's no echo. If you're recording in a room with big, flat, empty walls and an uncarpeted floor,

48
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,640
it is going to echo. Now, I have sound paneling now, but in the past,

49
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,980
I would hang a duvet or some sheets around near the microphone while I recorded, and that worked just as well.

50
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,800
When you're recording, sit up straight, take deep breaths,

51
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,140
try not to fiddle with things or speak animatedly with your hands too much.

52
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,200
Sit on a chair that doesn't creak when you move, like this one. Listen to this.

53
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:34,680
Try to record all your audio in a set position without moving around too much or

54
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,920
rearranging the microphone or different parts of your audio track will sound different.

55
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:44,880
I actually just record all my audio for each video in a single sitting to try to circumvent this problem.

56
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,300
Make sure you don't have a smartphone too close to your microphone or preamp or you'll get interference.

57
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,860
Try to record somewhere quiet. I guess that's the main piece of advice there.

58
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:03,540
I believe some libraries have recording booth bookings if your home environment is like completely unusable as far as audio goes,

59
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:09,460
so maybe look into that if you have to. Next up is audio editing, which is very important.

60
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:16,540
Now, obviously, as my recording setup is kind of cheap and basic, if I just record a track in Audacity and export it with no

61
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:22,020
editing, it would sound fairly rubbish. In fact, it would sound like this.

62
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,640
I'll read out the rest of this paragraph with no editing so you can see the difference.

63
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:32,780
So how do we stop our audio from sounding like this? Well, in Audacity, or your editor of choice,

64
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:37,440
I guess, we can apply different filters and effects. Now, the most important one

65
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:44,100
I always use is noise reduction. At the start of every track I record, I leave a brief period of total silence,

66
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,700
which looks like this,

67
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,060
so that I can let the microphone get a sample of the background noise.

68
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:56,860
Then if we select that part of the track, we can go to Effect, Noise Reduction, click Get Noise Profile,

69
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:02,740
which will tell Audacity what you want it to remove, hit Effect, Repeat Noise Reduction, and

70
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,560
say farewell to the background noise. There we go.

71
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:12,660
Now, obviously, you'll have to play around with the various settings to get it sounding the best, depending on your recording equipment and space.

72
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:19,260
I also use the normalize and equalize effects with particular settings relevant to my setup here,

73
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,100
but I had to play about with those to get the right numbers,

74
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,480
so experiment and see what works for you.

75
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:32,460
And the rest of the editing is just cutting the track down to the usable parts, you know, cutting flubbed lines or coughs, weird clicks,

76
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:39,900
shortening unusually long pauses, all that jazz. Now, I do this in Audacity before exporting the track,

77
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:45,160
but obviously this is different if you're editing audio that has to be fit to video footage of you speaking.

78
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:51,440
Any cuts there will have to match the video, or it will all be out of sync, so that's best done in the video editor.

79
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:58,320
So, video editing tips. Well, you know, don't ask me. I'm not the best, as I'm sure you've noticed.

80
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:05,200
I can do things, you know, I can make there be a picture of pyramids when I'm talking about pyramids.

81
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,500
I can make that picture of pyramids spin around if I wanted to, or like,

82
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:16,000
get really small and then slowly slide off the left of the screen.

83
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,180
You know, I can do it,

84
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:26,060
but mainly my video editing only extends to showing clips and pictures I happen to be talking about, and that's all fairly simple to learn,

85
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:32,140
which is cool. But for actual advice I can give, first off, make sure you have a good folder system.

86
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,220
I didn't know this at first, and everything got very messy.

87
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:43,100
So now every project has its own folder, and then within that are folders for pictures, video clips, audio, and so on.

88
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:51,740
In the actual editor, video editing for me boils down to dropping various clips and pictures onto the timeline at the right time.

89
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:58,020
I import the audio track first and then add visuals to it. Now, other people will do it differently again.

90
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,780
You'll have to see what works best for you.

91
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:07,500
I won't really go into any specifics here, as it will depend on what editor you're using and the type of content you're trying to make,

92
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,640
but there are plenty of great video editing tutorials here on YouTube,

93
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:17,980
so give those a look. And in future, when you see a YouTuber you like use an effect that you'd like to know how to do,

94
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:24,460
just have a Google of it and someone somewhere will have a tutorial for how to do it. Isn't the internet wonderful?

95
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,220
So I realized a lot of my technical advice there kind of boiled down to Google it and

96
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:34,380
experiment for yourself, so let's see if I'm any better at creative advice.

97
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,720
Now, I was asked two particular questions multiple times here.

98
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:45,980
How do I decide what to make videos about? And secondly, how do I know what I make will be worth watching?

99
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,460
So to the second question,

100
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:54,300
I don't know. You know, do you want to make the thing? You know, do you wish it existed?

101
00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:00,660
Would you watch it yourself? If so, you know, it's worth creating. And that's rather simple, that one.

102
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,100
To the first question, how do I decide what to make videos about?

103
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,700
Well, there's two main answers here.

104
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,040
The first thing is something that you know about and you want to share with other people.

105
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,340
I get a lot of questions from academic-type folks saying things like,

106
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,140
I'm a historian or a biologist or whatever.

107
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:24,840
Do you think it's worth me making videos about my area of expertise? And the answer is yes.

108
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,140
More topics than you think can be video-ified, to use the accurate technical term there.

109
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:37,620
The second thing I'd advise making videos about is something that you don't have expert knowledge of, but would like to learn more about.

110
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:43,360
For instance, I learn a lot about each topic I cover as I'm putting the script together.

111
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,660
It's a great learning experience by itself, and I've found it's good for the old mental health,

112
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,540
to be working on some sort of ongoing creative project.

113
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:58,380
So make videos about either things you do know about, or things you don't know about.

114
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,180
That encompasses everything,

115
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:09,880
doesn't it? I am terrible at giving advice. I've realized far too late in the production of this video though, so whatever. I'm pressing on.

116
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:15,420
So I'll give a few creative tips relating to how I make videos here. Now again,

117
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,940
these might be useless to someone with a different approach, but here we are.

118
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,700
So first off, I keep a list of ideas on the go. Now,

119
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:29,580
this is a .txt file on my computer with a list of video ideas, and I make notes on my phone or in a notebook

120
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,820
if something comes to me when I'm on the train or whatever. Now, it seems simple,

121
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,340
but if you don't do this, you will definitely forget that great idea you had yesterday.

122
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:43,780
So keep a pen and paper handy. This advice extends to each project too.

123
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:50,820
Write everything even vaguely useful down as you go, and you can always cut out the unnecessary parts later. Now,

124
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,660
I personally write scripts by, over the course of a week to a few weeks,

125
00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:01,460
making a big jumbled list of phrases and keywords and sentence fragments that are stand-ins for full paragraphs,

126
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,180
written down as I think or read about the topic.

127
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:11,660
Talking your ideas through with someone else can be really helpful too, as they will ask questions or raise additional points,

128
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,940
and you can get a bit of a preview of how an audience is going to respond to what you're saying.

129
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:22,020
So anyway, I have my big jumbled mess. Now, after I run out of material or

130
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:28,700
things to research or when I decide to stop because otherwise my video will be four hours long,

131
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,700
I take the mess and I start editing it.

132
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:37,900
I first cut and paste relevant sections together until they're structured in some sort of narrative order.

133
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:42,780
I write an introduction with leading questions that will be answered in the rest of the video.

134
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:47,400
I cut out any parts that don't fit or I decide aren't worth the time to go into.

135
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:54,500
So then when it finally comes time to actually write the script out fully, it's a simple process of fleshing out the skeleton structure

136
00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:02,020
that's already there. Now, this is all fairly basic essay writing advice aimed at making a particular type of video.

137
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,340
But there are lots of different approaches for different types of videos.

138
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,900
Some people work better when they're less structured, but I like to have everything written out.

139
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:17,300
So again, experiment and see what works for you. I realize I'm saying that a lot today, but oh well.

140
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:23,580
I'll move on to answering some more specific questions here, which are more about the culture of YouTube, I guess.

141
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,140
So a curious cat user asked,

142
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:42,420
How do you deal with the intense amount of backlash related to being left-wing and pro-feminist on YouTube?

143
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,660
And this question was echoed by a few other people, including someone who says,

144
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:52,100
I've been considering making a political YouTube channel, but I am afraid of doxxing and the likes.

145
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:59,700
I feel especially exposed to it because of the various minority groups I'm part of. Not straight, not a man, etc.

146
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:06,480
Any safety advice or uplifting pep talk? So okay, brigading videos,

147
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:14,860
abuse, doxxing and the likes. It happens, it sucks, and there isn't a short or easy way around it, unfortunately.

148
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:22,100
Now, I'm not too worried about down-voting campaigns. They're actually good for your channel, strictly numbers-wise.

149
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,240
It brings in a lot of views and interaction.

150
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,940
Likewise, in my experience, the false flagging of my videos has worked out pretty well for me.

151
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,740
The one time a group of angry lads got a video of mine taken down through mass flagging,

152
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:41,580
I saw a big increase in subscribers and views. And then, of course, because the flagging was not warranted, the video was then

153
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,100
reinstated, so I didn't lose anything, and it actually worked out okay.

154
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,260
Now, there isn't really a nice side to the abuse itself, unfortunately.

155
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,580
And I actually get it pretty easy, all things considered.

156
00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:00,900
All I'd say is don't feel bad about blocking or muting people who are arguing in bad faith.

157
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:08,340
Particularly starting out, you're gonna be reading all your YouTube comments and messages and the likes, but that gets old very fast.

158
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,980
You shouldn't waste your time engaging with trolls who are only there to annoy you.

159
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:19,820
Now, the worst of the things that happens is the doxxing and attempting to mess with your personal life somehow.

160
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,660
Luckily, it is only a very small minority of people who engage in this sort of behavior,

161
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,980
but it does happen. If you develop enough of a presence online,

162
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,940
there will be people who try to find out your address or guess your passwords.

163
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:39,820
Social engineer their way into getting the reset question for your backup email that you haven't logged into in five years,

164
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:45,940
you know, all that sort of thing. So before starting out, I'd say prepare yourself for that to happen.

165
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:53,540
Create a fresh email address for your channel and associated other social media accounts. Use a new, long,

166
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,780
complicated password, and be aware of your previous history on the internet.

167
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:05,400
You know, did you used to have a DeviantArt account where you drew Mario licking Sonic's feet or something?

168
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:12,380
If you don't do anything about that, the first person you piss off is going to find it and email it to your parents.

169
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:19,800
So any old social media accounts you don't use, log into them and deactivate them, and put the ones you do use on the highest

170
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:27,500
security settings. If there's something you've done in the past that would be embarrassing to be revealed about you, be upfront about it early on.

171
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:34,000
Part of the reason why I keep mentioning I was a little shithead troll years ago is if anyone ever finds a bunch of

172
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,300
posts of mine where I've said some air quotes edgy racist or sexist crap, which I did frequently,

173
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:47,000
I've already addressed that. For tips on trying to avoid this kind of extreme negative attention,

174
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,500
I'd just say mainly be boring.

175
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:56,100
You know, don't give them what they want. The people who engage in this sort of behavior just want a target, and they don't really

176
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:02,300
care who it is. If you give them the attention they want, they will follow you around and try to make you do it again.

177
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:06,380
So just hammer that mute button, I guess. Let's move on.

178
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,180
Another user asks,

179
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:13,100
How do you get past the fear that your videos won't be good enough or as good as you want them to be?

180
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:19,340
And the answer to that is you don't, or at least I don't. I see the flaws in everything

181
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:24,860
I make, and they'll never be as good as I want them to be, but that fear is not a good reason to stop.

182
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,580
Just try to make the next thing better than the last thing was.

183
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,140
Someone else asks,

184
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:35,140
How do you decide when you have something worth saying or maybe more accurately worth listening to?

185
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:40,660
I've thought about trying out getting going on YouTube, but it's hard to know if I'd have anything of value to share.

186
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:47,380
First off, I'm sure you do have something of value to share, but for me this process happens topic by topic.

187
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:54,260
There are videos I've abandoned if I realize that the approach I'm taking doesn't work, or there isn't enough material,

188
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:59,580
or whatever else. You know, you won't know until you try, I guess I'm saying. Someone else asks,

189
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,020
Hey Sean, I'm currently setting up a YouTube channel.

190
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:09,300
My first video happens to be about a popular YouTube skeptic spreading misinformation about the Holocaust and bordering denial.

191
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:15,220
I keep asking myself if I should touch this topic at all, or if there are certain things that should be off-limits

192
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,180
even when correcting Holocaust deniers. What are your thoughts on this?

193
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:24,180
So this is something I've been thinking about a lot lately, and here's where I'm at with it right now.

194
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:32,700
You can make a video countering something like Holocaust denial or some other similarly difficult subject, as long as you're kind of careful.

195
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,660
First off, I'd say you should aim upwards in terms of audiences.

196
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,020
You know, if you have a million subscribers,

197
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:46,220
it might be irresponsible to expose them to some obscure Holocaust deniers arguments, even for the purposes of debunking them.

198
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:50,700
So probably only respond to people with a larger audience than yourself,

199
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:55,660
and you can debunk an argument without providing a platform to any one person.

200
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,020
So talk about fascists all you want,

201
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:05,500
but don't have them on the show for a friendly chat. And if you ever make a video trying to explain their views and arguments,

202
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,260
include very clear and unambiguous

203
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:14,380
refutations to those arguments. You know, don't give them an inch, basically, or you'll be doing their job for them.

204
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,940
Another user asks,

205
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,940
To answer that, just dive right in.

206
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,820
Well, that was an easy one.

207
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,260
Another user asks,

208
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:52,020
So I'd say the big issue here is your concern about your videos no longer being relevant,

209
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:58,100
and you shouldn't be worried about that, really, unless you're making a channel that reacts to daily news or something.

210
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:03,180
I made a video about the shooting of Trayvon Martin, like, five years after it happened.

211
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,820
I'm working on a video about the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally right now.

212
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,820
You know, there's something to be said for missing the immediate response window,

213
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,860
and instead just getting the last word and later on.

214
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:21,460
So maybe try being less concerned about staying current, or develop content that is just timeless.

215
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:26,620
You know, I've made videos about Roman history, for instance. It doesn't really matter when they came out, you know.

216
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,100
Another user asks,

217
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,100
I find this comes with time.

218
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:43,500
You know, if you pick any YouTuber who sounds confident now and scroll to their old videos, they'll probably all sound totally different.

219
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,780
So make ten videos and then see if you still sound nervous, I guess.

220
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,500
Someone else asks,

221
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,020
And yes, that's completely fine.

222
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,420
You know, you can just put out political content and ignore all the rest of the rubbish if you like.

223
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,740
It'd probably be good for your mental health in the long run as well, so, yeah, go for it.

224
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:14,140
Finally, I was also asked a few questions about how to get views and subscribers and all that.

225
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,860
Now, I'm probably not the best person to answer this.

226
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:22,420
For me, it was about two years of producing video content before I broke a thousand subscribers.

227
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,980
Before doing political stuff, I was making kinda rubbish game videos.

228
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,380
And then before that, I had another YouTube channel that I ran for a year,

229
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,220
and that never really saw a sizeable audience of any kind.

230
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,420
I kept up with making videos because I found it fun.

231
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:41,420
It's an enjoyable hobby for me, so just keep on trucking, basically.

232
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:47,140
If you enjoy it, then just focus on improving, and eventually, if you're kinda lucky,

233
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:54,540
like I was, you'll eventually hit some sort of self-perpetuating snowball increase that will leave you very confused.

234
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:03,220
For more active advice, though, get a Twitter account and interact a bunch with the sorts of people who you think might like and share your videos.

235
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:07,860
The first step to getting a big audience is getting a little audience.

236
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,140
That's gonna be all from me today, folks.

237
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,140
Thanks a lot, I hope I answered all of your questions.

238
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:19,700
If there's anything you really want to know that I missed, just head over to Twitter or Curious Cat and send me a question.

239
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,700
Okay, thanks folks, and I'll see you next time.
