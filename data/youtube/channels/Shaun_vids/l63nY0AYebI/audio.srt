00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
Hello, everyone. Today, we're going to be talking about Doom Eternal, and no, I don't mean Brexit.

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,120
That's the only joke in today's video, everyone. I hope you enjoyed it.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:19,040
So anyway, before we actually get to Doom Eternal, if you remember, late last year,

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:26,720
I made a video about Cuphead and the various non-controversies associated with it called Cuphead the Fake Outrage,

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,880
which is a cleverly ambiguous, algorithm-fooling title there, if I do say so myself.

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,960
Cuphead, as a recent popular game, was being discussed and critiqued by games journalists and consumers

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,720
in articles and videos and Twitter conversations and the likes.

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,720
Now, what my video did was expose how various anti-feminist, anti-social justice folks online

9
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,160
lied about the nature of the discussions and critiques of Cuphead

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,400
in order to conjure the specter of an evil SJW outrage monster

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,240
that wants to take away their audience's new favorite video game.

12
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,200
It's a sort of constructed meta-outrage.

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,080
You know, you act outraged about the air-quote SJWs being outraged,

14
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,360
except you also made the SJWs up.

15
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,120
It's shameless clickbait pandering tactics, basically.

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,320
Cuphead the Fake Outrage was a landmark video in the history of games journalism

17
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,400
and changed the face of YouTube forever.

18
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,440
The meta-outrage industry was shamed into silence, collectively promising that in the future

19
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,600
they would only respond proportionally to real, substantial news stories

20
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,120
about things that actually happened in reality.

21
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,240
And having gotten that completely real setup out of the way there,

22
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,440
it's time to take a big sip of coffee and do a YouTube search for Doom Eternal.

23
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,720
Oh, no. What's happened here, then?

24
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,520
SJW snowflakes triggered by Doom Eternal.

25
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,320
SJW outrage ensures Doom Eternal will be bestseller.

26
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,960
SJWs flip over Doom Eternal mocking immigration.

27
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,560
YouTubers Sargon of Akkad, No Bullshit, and The Quartering there,

28
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,960
all talking about how the SJWs are triggered and outraged and so on about Doom Eternal.

29
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,240
And those three weren't the only ones who made videos about this topic.

30
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,400
There's also Geeks and Gamers, Optimus, Dr. Shame, Steve Talon,

31
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,600
Maltered Bampot, Half-Harry, Timkast, Xander Scullion,

32
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,920
Weaponized Nerd Rage, Jacob Strickland, The Good Old Gamer,

33
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,720
The Hyrule Bard, A Guy and His Games,

34
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,640
Resident Evil God, Millennial Reject, McDovin,

35
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,920
Rundan, FM Vipera, Prince of Fallen,

36
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,920
Gamers Cafe, The Hellwalker, Zanyvids, American Krogan,

37
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,120
Vossen Media, It's a Gundam, Scummy Rebel, Jim the Ape,

38
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,080
Moybridge, Chosen Civil Talk, Yellow Flash Productions,

39
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,480
Mr. H Reviews, and Channel Reason.

40
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,680
Now, all of this was confusing to me,

41
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,040
as I sit on the ruling council of SJWs here online,

42
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,240
and I'd not heard anything about this Doom Eternal stuff.

43
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,080
And I love being offended about things,

44
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,760
so honestly, it's kind of annoying that an opportunity to be offended

45
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,440
seems to have slipped me by.

46
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,080
So then, let's see if we can figure out what happened here,

47
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,880
and maybe get in on the outrage ourselves.

48
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,760
So, Doom Eternal is the upcoming sequel to id Software's 2016 reboot

49
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,000
of the Doom franchise, unhelpfully titled Doom, not Doom 4,

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,600
because fuck sequentially numbered sequels, apparently.

51
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,400
Doom 2016 was an excellent game, and rightfully received critical acclaim.

52
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,880
It looked really good, the music was great,

53
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,360
the fast-paced combat was consistently fun,

54
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,360
you know, whatever, I'm not a games review channel,

55
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,160
so I'll just say, it was almost always really good.

56
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,560
I streamed it recently on my Twitch channel,

57
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,840
and had a grand old time, except for one part when the game glitched

58
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,160
as I was killing an enemy and dropped me out on the map.

59
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,800
But you know, otherwise, it's very good.

60
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,080
Now, if we want to understand all of this mess,

61
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,960
what we do need to talk about here is the game's narrative.

62
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,320
So, spoiler warning.

63
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,160
In the future, there's some sort of energy crisis on Earth,

64
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,480
which is solved by the Union Aerospace Corporation, or UAC,

65
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,560
opening up a portal to hell on Mars.

66
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,240
They then siphon, quote,

67
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,360
hell energy out of hell and process it into usable energy in our dimension.

68
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,160
Unsurprisingly, things soon go awry,

69
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,400
and a bunch of hell demons invade the UAC's Mars facility.

70
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,080
Players play as the Doom Slayer, which is a wonderful name,

71
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,800
who's awakened from hibernation on Mars

72
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,200
in order to put a stop to the invasion.

73
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,720
And they then spend the game hopping back and forth between Mars and hell,

74
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,240
accomplishing objectives and trying to sever the link between the worlds.

75
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,000
So it's a wonderfully cheesy setup for a game story there.

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,800
So the question we have to ask here is, who are the antagonists in Doom?

77
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,120
Well, it's the demons, right?

78
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,480
All the evil hell demons you spend your time fighting against.

79
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,320
Well, not really, no.

80
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,280
The hell demons are technically evil and bad,

81
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,720
but, you know, they're hell demons.

82
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,080
What do you expect? You get what you sign up for with hell demons.

83
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,560
They're presented more as a force of nature than anything else.

84
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,320
The actual, quote, bad guys in Doom are the UAC,

85
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,000
the mega-corporation that actually opened the portal to hell.

86
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,840
The leadership of the UAC are presented as driven by profit and greed and personal gain.

87
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,960
We have the corrupted head of research, Olivia Pierce,

88
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,600
who ends up being the final boss of the game,

89
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,480
and the chairman of the UAC, Samuel Hayden, the soulless CEO robot.

90
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,640
Samuel Hayden.

91
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,400
S. Hayden.

92
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,920
Satan.

93
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,080
You get it.

94
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,960
The UAC are the reason for the conflict in Doom, not the demons.

95
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,840
Samuel Hayden is introduced right after you wake up,

96
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,120
contacting you via a computer screen to offer to work together

97
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,320
to solve this problem in a way that benefits us both.

98
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,720
In response to which, your character grabs the computer and just throws it away,

99
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,400
which is really funny.

100
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,360
And shortly afterwards, the following cutscene happens.

101
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,760
I'm willing to take full responsibility for the horrible events of the last 24 hours,

102
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,560
but you must understand,

103
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,680
our interest in their world was purely for the betterment of mankind.

104
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,080
Everything has clearly gotten out of hand now, yes,

105
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,800
but it was worth the risk, I assure you.

106
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,040
And that's the one joke in Doom there.

107
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,240
It'll say something like,

108
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,560
this was for the benefit of mankind,

109
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,240
and then it pans to a dead guy.

110
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,640
It's funny, it's a good joke.

111
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,680
So the point is made right at the start of the game there.

112
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,760
The corporation is bad.

113
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,680
And there's plenty of jokes in the story

114
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,760
about the mixing of corporate culture with the demonic invasion.

115
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,520
And notable for us here are the various friendly announcement holograms

116
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,800
present throughout the game.

117
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,080
And they say things like,

118
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,840
weaponizing demons for a brighter tomorrow.

119
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,440
There will be an open forum to resolve any questions or concerns

120
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,840
on the initiative to weaponize the demons.

121
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,040
Go beyond mere mortal limitations.

122
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,320
See Jessica in Human Resources to find out if you qualify.

123
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,160
You know, hardy-har.

124
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,040
They're using corporate speak to put a positive spin on the demonic invasion.

125
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,240
I apologize here.

126
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,160
I'm not making fun of this joke.

127
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,360
Everything's just unfunny when you break it down to the fundamentals.

128
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,160
I can't really help ruining these jokes here.

129
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,600
Anyway, this brings us to the QuakeCon gameplay trailer,

130
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,680
the one that is supposedly the source of all the SJW outrage.

131
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,400
Now, this trailer also had the friendly corporate announcement holograms.

132
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,840
Please remain calm.

133
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,040
You may notice a slight change in the environment.

134
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,000
A slight change in the environment?

135
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,080
But that's not a slight change.

136
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,680
That's a really big change.

137
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:04,820
You get it.

138
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,480
Now, the lines we're concerned about here are the following.

139
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,640
My brothers and sisters,

140
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,560
let's help to make our friends transition into their new world a comfortable one.

141
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,400
Remember, demon can be an offensive term.

142
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,960
Refer to them as mortally challenged.

143
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,960
And Earth is the melting pot of the universe.

144
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,120
So what do we think about these lines?

145
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,360
Well, when I watched the trailer,

146
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,320
I found them a little eye-rolling, to be honest.

147
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,640
But I figured they were just going for the same sort of thing as the previous game.

148
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,520
You know, they're satirizing corporate culture.

149
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,640
And particularly here, they're satirizing how corporations

150
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,600
can co-opt progressive language in an attempt to spin their various evil doings.

151
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,000
Well, that was my take on the trailer, anyway.

152
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,160
And because it was my opinion, it was the only correct one.

153
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,600
And anyone who had a different opinion was wrong, and I was shocked.

154
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,600
Shocked to discover anyone could dare to think differently than me,

155
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,200
who was right about everything.

156
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,360
I kid, of course.

157
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
I've been on the internet for a while now,

158
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,280
so when I watched the trailer, I thought,

159
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,600
Okay, someone without the full context there,

160
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,960
like someone who didn't play or remember the previous game in the series,

161
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,240
or just someone who has a different opinion about the game than me,

162
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,440
they could have read those lines not as a satire

163
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,600
of corporate co-opting of progressive language,

164
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,040
but as a satire of progressive language itself.

165
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,880
Well, I'm narrativizing a bit there.

166
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,520
My actual first thought when I watched the trailer was,

167
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,880
mortally challenged.

168
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,640
Wasn't that a Discworld joke?

169
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,480
And then I went and checked and I was like,

170
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,040
Hey, it was, they're stealing Terry Pratchett's jokes.

171
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,920
But for the purposes of this video,

172
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,720
I'm gonna streamline my thought process here.

173
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,040
So the next thing I thought was,

174
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,040
there's two types of reactions here

175
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,880
if you're someone who thinks the trailer is mocking progressive language.

176
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,720
If you're on the left, you probably thought,

177
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,120
Oh, well, that sucks.

178
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,600
You know, the previous game could fairly be read as

179
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,080
anti-corporate, anti-capitalist, pro-environmentalism, you know?

180
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,080
And it was produced by Bethesda,

181
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,640
who also produced the Wolfenstein series,

182
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,760
which has Nazis being bad people in the story,

183
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,760
who it's okay to fight against.

184
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,480
It's weird how that's noteworthy these days.

185
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,880
So to see this new Doom trailer

186
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,600
pandering to anti-political correctness, folks,

187
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
must be fairly disappointing.

188
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,760
The other type of reaction you could have is

189
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,360
if you were an anti-immigrant, anti-political correctness type,

190
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,640
you might think,

191
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,240
Yes, excellent. This game is pandering to me.

192
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,000
For example, here are the opening posts of some threads about the trailer

193
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,800
from 4chan's far-right politics board.

194
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,760
Is there any game more anti-migrant than new Doom Eternal 2019?

195
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,840
Basically, replace all the words demons with immigrants.

196
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,120
Hologram is saying.

197
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,520
Doom 2018.

198
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,160
Earth is melting pot of the universe.

199
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,440
WTF?

200
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,280
Paltier memes in biggest shotter of this decade.

201
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,720
Is this real world?

202
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,720
I just copied these into the script.

203
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,040
I didn't practice reading these out before I started.

204
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,920
These are really funny.

205
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,120
Doom Eternal is a complete 180

206
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,400
and is very blatantly making fun of the leftist globalist SJW crowd

207
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,680
and likening demons to the refugees and immigrants.

208
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,280
This game is fucking red-pilled as fuck.

209
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,080
And here's an article from redstate.com.

210
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,720
SJWs flip over Doom Eternal

211
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,400
as it mocks leftist political correctness on immigration.

212
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,240
And this article manages to mention both MS-13 and, quote,

213
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,000
rape fugies.

214
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,040
So there are racist anti-immigrant folks

215
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,600
who think the trailer was pandering to them.

216
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,960
Now, I think they're wrong.

217
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,960
But the fact that they have the space to even think that at all

218
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,160
means that it was kind of a bad trailer.

219
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
You know, I read it one way,

220
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,640
but the trailer wasn't just made for me, was it?

221
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,560
It was made for a wide audience,

222
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,600
some of whom thought the trailer was being racist.

223
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,960
And they liked it.

224
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,800
Satire requires a clarity of purpose and target,

225
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,360
lest it be mistaken for and contribute to

226
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,840
that which it intends to criticize.

227
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,760
So they say.

228
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,560
So let's take a look at some examples of people on Twitter

229
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,880
who talked about not liking the trailer.

230
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,560
And these come from a post on funnyjunk.com titled

231
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,960
Mortally Challenged Controversy.

232
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,240
One person says,

233
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,560
And then they quote one.

234
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,640
Four likes.

235
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,680
Another user says,

236
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,080
One like.

237
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,120
Another user says,

238
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,960
So what am I doing here?

239
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,880
Why am I reading out these posts?

240
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,360
And why am I saying how many likes they got?

241
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,400
Well, this page on funnyjunk.com

242
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,880
is where all of this came from.

243
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,040
There are a dozen tweets on this page,

244
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,080
none of which were particularly big.

245
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,760
The most retweeted post on here has seven retweets.

246
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,840
And I'd like to point a few more things out.

247
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,760
Those three tweets that I just read out there

248
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,720
all mention that they think the game looks good

249
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,480
despite not liking the jokes.

250
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,680
You know, I'm super excited by things in the new Doom reveal.

251
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,880
The trailer's great.

252
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,480
The game still rules.

253
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,080
And they weren't the only ones.

254
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,720
Doom Eternal looking fucking phenomenal.

255
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,360
But I'm not sure how I feel about the lazy jokes

256
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,880
about political correctness.

257
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,480
And if you noticed here that certain words are highlighted.

258
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,520
They're bold because they're Twitter search terms.

259
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,600
Because whoever put this list together

260
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,160
had to search to find these tweets.

261
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,040
Which, you know, is it really a controversy

262
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,120
if you have to go looking for it?

263
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,520
And most of these people seem pretty excited

264
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,720
about the new Doom game.

265
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,440
They're not on some moral crusade to ban it or anything.

266
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,640
They're just questioning some of the jokes in the trailer.

267
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,200
This person just quoted one of the jokes

268
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,360
and put a roll eyes emoji after it.

269
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,800
That's it.

270
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,640
That's the extent of their outrage.

271
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,760
Their one emoji.

272
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,680
No retweets.

273
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,360
Four likes.

274
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,240
You know, who cares?

275
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,160
Well, I'll tell you who cares.

276
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,360
Billy D of oneangrygamer.net

277
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,600
who wrote a post about the Funny Junk article

278
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,280
and included some tweets of his own.

279
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,720
Which are, like the Funny Junk tweets, fairly tame.

280
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,480
Anyways, I'm hyped about new Doom Eternal still.

281
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,080
But it's a muted hype.

282
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,840
Because I can't ignore that dog whistly immigration joke in the trailer.

283
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,520
Doom Eternal looks good.

284
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,640
But I hope they've adjusted the locked in arena combat stuff.

285
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,880
It was too obvious when that was about to happen.

286
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,560
The bit with the NPCs is great.

287
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,520
Some vaguely concerning satire

288
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,120
using the language surrounding immigration and minorities for the demons.

289
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,760
So we've got muted hype,

290
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,680
vague concern,

291
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,360
kinda wary,

292
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,440
seems kinda lame,

293
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,240
one roll eyes emoji.

294
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,560
You know, where's the outrage here?

295
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,120
And this article finishes out by saying the following.

296
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,160
One Twitter user pointed out that everyone calling the satirical nature of the holograms

297
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,280
comments racist and anti-immigration were just projecting

298
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,360
because it meant that SJW see foreigners as destructive violent demons.

299
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,280
Plot twist.

300
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,360
What if the real racists are the people who aren't racist?

301
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,040
Never seen that one before.

302
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,600
And that's the angle a lot of these people took too.

303
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,320
Except, as we've already seen, plenty of racists and anti-immigration folks

304
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,800
responded positively to the trailer.

305
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,360
Which was to be expected, to be honest.

306
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,080
So the people being vaguely concerned about the tweets are justified in being so.

307
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,840
They're just thinking a couple of moves ahead of old Billy Dee here.

308
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,480
Most of these videos are just reading out this article.

309
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,400
And I can prove that fairly easily.

310
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,640
Look, here's the first tweet in the article and take it away, lads.

311
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:32,160
Not sure what to think of Doom Eternal having not one but two anti-SJW jokes in it.

312
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,920
Not sure what to think of Doom Eternal having not one but two anti-SJW jokes in it.

313
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,840
Not sure what to think of Doom Eternal having not one but two anti-SJW jokes in it.

314
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,680
Not sure what to do- I'm not sure what to think of Doom Eternal

315
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,200
having not one but two anti-SJW jokes in it.

316
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,560
Not sure what to think of Doom Eternal having not one but two anti-SJW jokes in it.

317
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,840
Not one but two anti-SJW jokes in it.

318
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,720
They've all made the same fucking video.

319
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,960
There were more YouTube videos made about these tweets than there were tweets.

320
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,120
This outrage isn't real.

321
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,240
It was constructed to get clicks using the oldest advertising trick in the book.

322
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,480
Do what I say because someone you don't like doesn't want you to do it.

323
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,080
The psychology behind this meta-outrage industry is pretty sad, really.

324
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,360
The title of one video I showed earlier is kind of insightful here.

325
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,920
From Geeks and Gamers.

326
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:42,400
And it's Doom Eternal makes SJWs cry and normal people are laughing at them.

327
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,480
So it follows that if you laugh at the SJWs, you're normal.

328
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,280
Click here to be normal.

329
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,480
Click here to be part of the in-group, all hating the out-group.

330
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,280
It's the six and a half minutes hate.

331
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,800
It's a trick played on people, mostly younger people here,

332
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,680
who just aren't developed enough to appreciate enjoying things on their own terms.

333
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,040
They can only enjoy something in relation to their peers.

334
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,760
I.e. my in-group like it, or more importantly and effectively,

335
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,840
my out-group don't like it.

336
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,960
And they want to stop me from liking it.

337
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,040
And that's how consumerism becomes heroism to these kids.

338
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,320
The top comment on Sargon of Akkad's video says,

339
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,920
any developer in this day and age willing to stand up against the tyranny of social justice

340
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,760
deserves a pre-order for every snowflake tier they cause.

341
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,080
Yeah. Well done, guys.

342
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,720
You're really sticking it to them by falling into an easy marketing trap, aren't you?

343
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,400
You could sell these kids sand in the desert if you told them SJWs didn't like it.

344
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,320
Back to the trailer for a second here.

345
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,160
And this is my cynical, anti-capitalist side talking,

346
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,840
but the people who put the trailers together for these games

347
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,640
often aren't the people who designed the game.

348
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,520
And maybe they put those jokes in the trailer deliberately to spark this kind of discussion.

349
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,440
It's something I'm noticing more of, and it's companies saying,

350
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:16,160
you know, if we're sort of ambiguously, but not really, but arguably racist,

351
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,760
everyone's gonna argue about whether we were racist or not.

352
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,520
And in the process, they'll be talking about our product.

353
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,560
And from funny junk to one angry gamer to all these guys to me,

354
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,080
and then to you, now, we did talk about it.

355
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,600
What a human centipede of content we have here.

356
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,800
Is that what happened?

357
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,420
Maybe.

358
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,400
It worked, if so.

359
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,400
You know, bravo, marketing guys, you made us all talk about Doom.

360
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,720
Congratulations, you soulless, manipulative parasites.

361
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,400
And I hope that is what happened, actually, because there is another alternative here

362
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,480
that I don't really want to be the truth, because I was looking forward to this game.

363
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,960
But maybe the game is just bad.

364
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,920
Maybe it's just rubbish now.

365
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,560
Doom 2016 was surprisingly good and surprisingly popular.

366
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:11,200
And it's possible that going forward, the series will chase that popularity

367
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,360
and lose what message it had.

368
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,080
Look at another Bethesda-produced game that's coming up, Fallout 76.

369
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,560
Now, Fallout was a game series initially about the horrors of surviving

370
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,960
in a post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland,

371
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,720
and now is being marketed as get together with all your pals

372
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,960
and nuke the next town to get some loot crates or whatever.

373
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,440
So it's possible that this game is just gonna be crap.

374
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,400
Maybe they'll forget the messaging of the previous game

375
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,400
and put out a story in which the demons are just bad outsiders

376
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,040
who need to be killed because they're bad.

377
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,040
Maybe they'll forget that Samuel Hayden is supposed to be the bad guy,

378
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,000
or they'll have him as the final boss for no other reason

379
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,280
than he's a character in the series who could be a final boss

380
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,480
instead of it making narrative sense for him to play that role.

381
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,560
I don't know. I hope not, but it's all possible.

382
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,720
So, good job, Doom trailer.

383
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,680
You made me wonder about how much worse than its predecessor the next game is going to be.

384
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,080
But, you know, the shotgun has a hook on it now, and that looks cool.

385
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,320
It's about time for me to wrap up here, folks,

386
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,800
but, uh, sympathize with me a little.

387
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,120
I usually like to end my video scripts on something weighty, you know?

388
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
Something with some punch to it.

389
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,080
But that's difficult here because nothing happened.

390
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,160
You know, lots of people said something happened, but it didn't.

391
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,360
And it was relatively trivial to show that it didn't happen too,

392
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,680
so I'm a bit deflated, to be honest.

393
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,600
I feel like this one's just gonna fizzle out.

394
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,960
I don't have anything killer to go out on.

395
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,640
I could talk about the hypocrisy of the YouTube outrage industry

396
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,200
solely targeting, quote, SJWs,

397
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,680
when there are plenty of examples of racists taking the trailer seriously online.

398
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,800
You know, you could make a video in the style of one of theirs

399
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,720
going through a poll thread or whatever

400
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,360
and mocking all the people thinking the game is, quote, red-pilled and the likes.

401
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,000
They don't do that, though, do they?

402
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,640
It's sort of revealing in its absence there.

403
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:19,040
So why do they instead endlessly attack this nebulous idea of SJWs?

404
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,120
And it's because the narrative they've built needs enemies.

405
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,360
And SJWs are good and useful enemies.

406
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,040
Anyone can be one.

407
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:34,640
There's no criteria for it other than doing something that anti-SJWs don't like,

408
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,720
such as not being sufficiently excited about a video game trailer.

409
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,320
SJWs are crazed, mindless opponents

410
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,520
who are numberless, can turn up anywhere, and are always easily defeated,

411
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,560
while somehow simultaneously being the puppet masters

412
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,680
behind a conspiracy to destroy Western civilization.

413
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,440
SJWs hate us for being straight white males,

414
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,720
and thus we never have to feel bad about fighting them.

415
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,800
They hate us just because.

416
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,680
So our hatred of them is justified.

417
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,840
It's a narrative of victimization.

418
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,800
They want to be under attack, but they don't ever want to actually risk being beaten.

419
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,600
So they make up an easy enemy to fight.

420
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,360
And then to maintain the illusion,

421
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,800
they just have to selectively turn their brains off every now and then

422
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,880
and watch a man complain to 700,000 people

423
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,680
that a tweet with two likes on it is taking something too seriously.

424
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,240
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

425
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,120
What do we think? Was that punchy enough of an ending there?

426
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,600
I don't know. It'll do, won't it?

427
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,960
I went with the SJW demon comparison there,

428
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,160
but I didn't outright state it, and that way anyone who noticed it would feel clever.

429
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,720
It's the best I could do given the circumstances.

430
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,920
It's hard to make a video where nothing happens, you know?

431
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,680
I wish I could just read out other people's articles I found on the internet.

432
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,560
That'd be easy.

433
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,240
If I was this Billy Dee chap over at One Angry Gamer or whatever, I'd be furious.

434
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,840
I didn't see that in the script either.

435
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,320
Of course he'd be furious. He's one angry gamer.

436
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,760
But yeah, all those people just copying his article.

437
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,480
It's terrible.

438
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,600

00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,640
Thanks a lot to all my current supporters, as always.

442
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,320
I do have videos coming up that are actually about things.

443
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,520
Don't worry, folks.

444
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,520
Okay, that's it from me today.

445
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,020
Bye.
