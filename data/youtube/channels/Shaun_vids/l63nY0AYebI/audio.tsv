0	7200	Hello, everyone. Today, we're going to be talking about Doom Eternal, and no, I don't mean Brexit.
9120	13120	That's the only joke in today's video, everyone. I hope you enjoyed it.
13560	19040	So anyway, before we actually get to Doom Eternal, if you remember, late last year,
19040	26720	I made a video about Cuphead and the various non-controversies associated with it called Cuphead the Fake Outrage,
27360	32880	which is a cleverly ambiguous, algorithm-fooling title there, if I do say so myself.
32880	38960	Cuphead, as a recent popular game, was being discussed and critiqued by games journalists and consumers
38960	42720	in articles and videos and Twitter conversations and the likes.
42720	48720	Now, what my video did was expose how various anti-feminist, anti-social justice folks online
48720	52160	lied about the nature of the discussions and critiques of Cuphead
52160	56400	in order to conjure the specter of an evil SJW outrage monster
56400	60240	that wants to take away their audience's new favorite video game.
60240	63200	It's a sort of constructed meta-outrage.
63200	68080	You know, you act outraged about the air-quote SJWs being outraged,
68080	71360	except you also made the SJWs up.
71360	75120	It's shameless clickbait pandering tactics, basically.
75840	80320	Cuphead the Fake Outrage was a landmark video in the history of games journalism
80320	82400	and changed the face of YouTube forever.
84080	89440	The meta-outrage industry was shamed into silence, collectively promising that in the future
89440	93600	they would only respond proportionally to real, substantial news stories
93600	97120	about things that actually happened in reality.
97120	100240	And having gotten that completely real setup out of the way there,
100240	105440	it's time to take a big sip of coffee and do a YouTube search for Doom Eternal.
106240	108720	Oh, no. What's happened here, then?
109440	113520	SJW snowflakes triggered by Doom Eternal.
113520	118320	SJW outrage ensures Doom Eternal will be bestseller.
118320	122960	SJWs flip over Doom Eternal mocking immigration.
123600	128560	YouTubers Sargon of Akkad, No Bullshit, and The Quartering there,
128560	134960	all talking about how the SJWs are triggered and outraged and so on about Doom Eternal.
134960	138240	And those three weren't the only ones who made videos about this topic.
138240	144400	There's also Geeks and Gamers, Optimus, Dr. Shame, Steve Talon,
144400	149600	Maltered Bampot, Half-Harry, Timkast, Xander Scullion,
149600	153920	Weaponized Nerd Rage, Jacob Strickland, The Good Old Gamer,
153920	156720	The Hyrule Bard, A Guy and His Games,
156720	160640	Resident Evil God, Millennial Reject, McDovin,
160640	163920	Rundan, FM Vipera, Prince of Fallen,
163920	167920	Gamers Cafe, The Hellwalker, Zanyvids, American Krogan,
167920	171120	Vossen Media, It's a Gundam, Scummy Rebel, Jim the Ape,
171120	174080	Moybridge, Chosen Civil Talk, Yellow Flash Productions,
174080	176480	Mr. H Reviews, and Channel Reason.
177680	179680	Now, all of this was confusing to me,
179680	183040	as I sit on the ruling council of SJWs here online,
183040	186240	and I'd not heard anything about this Doom Eternal stuff.
186240	188080	And I love being offended about things,
188080	191760	so honestly, it's kind of annoying that an opportunity to be offended
191760	193440	seems to have slipped me by.
193440	196080	So then, let's see if we can figure out what happened here,
196080	198880	and maybe get in on the outrage ourselves.
198880	203760	So, Doom Eternal is the upcoming sequel to id Software's 2016 reboot
203760	210000	of the Doom franchise, unhelpfully titled Doom, not Doom 4,
210000	213600	because fuck sequentially numbered sequels, apparently.
213600	218400	Doom 2016 was an excellent game, and rightfully received critical acclaim.
218400	220880	It looked really good, the music was great,
220880	223360	the fast-paced combat was consistently fun,
223360	225360	you know, whatever, I'm not a games review channel,
225360	228160	so I'll just say, it was almost always really good.
228160	230560	I streamed it recently on my Twitch channel,
230560	233840	and had a grand old time, except for one part when the game glitched
233840	236160	as I was killing an enemy and dropped me out on the map.
236160	238800	But you know, otherwise, it's very good.
238800	242080	Now, if we want to understand all of this mess,
242080	244960	what we do need to talk about here is the game's narrative.
244960	246320	So, spoiler warning.
247040	250160	In the future, there's some sort of energy crisis on Earth,
250160	254480	which is solved by the Union Aerospace Corporation, or UAC,
255120	258560	opening up a portal to hell on Mars.
258560	260240	They then siphon, quote,
260240	265360	hell energy out of hell and process it into usable energy in our dimension.
265360	268160	Unsurprisingly, things soon go awry,
268160	272400	and a bunch of hell demons invade the UAC's Mars facility.
272400	276080	Players play as the Doom Slayer, which is a wonderful name,
276080	278800	who's awakened from hibernation on Mars
278800	281200	in order to put a stop to the invasion.
281200	284720	And they then spend the game hopping back and forth between Mars and hell,
284720	288240	accomplishing objectives and trying to sever the link between the worlds.
288240	292000	So it's a wonderfully cheesy setup for a game story there.
292000	296800	So the question we have to ask here is, who are the antagonists in Doom?
297360	299120	Well, it's the demons, right?
299120	302480	All the evil hell demons you spend your time fighting against.
302480	304320	Well, not really, no.
305280	309280	The hell demons are technically evil and bad,
309280	310720	but, you know, they're hell demons.
310720	314080	What do you expect? You get what you sign up for with hell demons.
314720	318560	They're presented more as a force of nature than anything else.
318560	322320	The actual, quote, bad guys in Doom are the UAC,
322320	326000	the mega-corporation that actually opened the portal to hell.
326000	331840	The leadership of the UAC are presented as driven by profit and greed and personal gain.
331840	334960	We have the corrupted head of research, Olivia Pierce,
334960	337600	who ends up being the final boss of the game,
337600	342480	and the chairman of the UAC, Samuel Hayden, the soulless CEO robot.
343520	344640	Samuel Hayden.
345440	346400	S. Hayden.
347200	347920	Satan.
349200	350080	You get it.
350080	354960	The UAC are the reason for the conflict in Doom, not the demons.
354960	357840	Samuel Hayden is introduced right after you wake up,
357840	361120	contacting you via a computer screen to offer to work together
361120	364320	to solve this problem in a way that benefits us both.
364880	368720	In response to which, your character grabs the computer and just throws it away,
368720	370400	which is really funny.
370400	373360	And shortly afterwards, the following cutscene happens.
374320	379760	I'm willing to take full responsibility for the horrible events of the last 24 hours,
379760	382560	but you must understand,
382560	387680	our interest in their world was purely for the betterment of mankind.
389040	392080	Everything has clearly gotten out of hand now, yes,
393440	396800	but it was worth the risk, I assure you.
398880	401040	And that's the one joke in Doom there.
401040	402240	It'll say something like,
402240	404560	this was for the benefit of mankind,
404560	406240	and then it pans to a dead guy.
406960	408640	It's funny, it's a good joke.
408640	411680	So the point is made right at the start of the game there.
411680	413760	The corporation is bad.
413760	415680	And there's plenty of jokes in the story
415680	419760	about the mixing of corporate culture with the demonic invasion.
419760	423520	And notable for us here are the various friendly announcement holograms
423520	424800	present throughout the game.
424800	426080	And they say things like,
426720	429840	weaponizing demons for a brighter tomorrow.
429840	433440	There will be an open forum to resolve any questions or concerns
433440	435840	on the initiative to weaponize the demons.
436400	439040	Go beyond mere mortal limitations.
439040	442320	See Jessica in Human Resources to find out if you qualify.
442320	444160	You know, hardy-har.
444160	449040	They're using corporate speak to put a positive spin on the demonic invasion.
449040	450240	I apologize here.
450240	452160	I'm not making fun of this joke.
452160	455360	Everything's just unfunny when you break it down to the fundamentals.
455360	458160	I can't really help ruining these jokes here.
458160	461600	Anyway, this brings us to the QuakeCon gameplay trailer,
461600	465680	the one that is supposedly the source of all the SJW outrage.
465680	470400	Now, this trailer also had the friendly corporate announcement holograms.
471920	473840	Please remain calm.
473840	477040	You may notice a slight change in the environment.
477840	480000	A slight change in the environment?
480000	482080	But that's not a slight change.
482080	483680	That's a really big change.
484320	484820	You get it.
485600	488480	Now, the lines we're concerned about here are the following.
489040	490640	My brothers and sisters,
490640	494560	let's help to make our friends transition into their new world a comfortable one.
495440	498400	Remember, demon can be an offensive term.
498400	500960	Refer to them as mortally challenged.
501520	504960	And Earth is the melting pot of the universe.
504960	507120	So what do we think about these lines?
507120	509360	Well, when I watched the trailer,
509360	512320	I found them a little eye-rolling, to be honest.
512320	516640	But I figured they were just going for the same sort of thing as the previous game.
516640	519520	You know, they're satirizing corporate culture.
519520	522640	And particularly here, they're satirizing how corporations
522640	527600	can co-opt progressive language in an attempt to spin their various evil doings.
528240	532000	Well, that was my take on the trailer, anyway.
532000	536160	And because it was my opinion, it was the only correct one.
536160	539600	And anyone who had a different opinion was wrong, and I was shocked.
540160	543600	Shocked to discover anyone could dare to think differently than me,
543600	545200	who was right about everything.
546080	547360	I kid, of course.
547360	549360	I've been on the internet for a while now,
549360	551280	so when I watched the trailer, I thought,
552240	555600	Okay, someone without the full context there,
555600	558960	like someone who didn't play or remember the previous game in the series,
558960	562240	or just someone who has a different opinion about the game than me,
562880	565440	they could have read those lines not as a satire
565440	567600	of corporate co-opting of progressive language,
567600	571040	but as a satire of progressive language itself.
571040	572880	Well, I'm narrativizing a bit there.
572880	575520	My actual first thought when I watched the trailer was,
575520	576880	mortally challenged.
576880	578640	Wasn't that a Discworld joke?
578640	580480	And then I went and checked and I was like,
580480	583040	Hey, it was, they're stealing Terry Pratchett's jokes.
584080	585920	But for the purposes of this video,
585920	588720	I'm gonna streamline my thought process here.
588720	591040	So the next thing I thought was,
591040	593040	there's two types of reactions here
593040	596880	if you're someone who thinks the trailer is mocking progressive language.
596880	598720	If you're on the left, you probably thought,
598720	601120	Oh, well, that sucks.
601120	603600	You know, the previous game could fairly be read as
603600	608080	anti-corporate, anti-capitalist, pro-environmentalism, you know?
608080	610080	And it was produced by Bethesda,
610080	612640	who also produced the Wolfenstein series,
612640	615760	which has Nazis being bad people in the story,
615760	617760	who it's okay to fight against.
618320	620480	It's weird how that's noteworthy these days.
621040	622880	So to see this new Doom trailer
622880	625600	pandering to anti-political correctness, folks,
625600	627600	must be fairly disappointing.
627600	629760	The other type of reaction you could have is
629760	633360	if you were an anti-immigrant, anti-political correctness type,
633360	634640	you might think,
634640	638240	Yes, excellent. This game is pandering to me.
638240	642000	For example, here are the opening posts of some threads about the trailer
642000	644800	from 4chan's far-right politics board.
645600	651760	Is there any game more anti-migrant than new Doom Eternal 2019?
651760	655840	Basically, replace all the words demons with immigrants.
655840	657120	Hologram is saying.
657680	659520	Doom 2018.
659520	662160	Earth is melting pot of the universe.
662160	663440	WTF?
663440	667280	Paltier memes in biggest shotter of this decade.
667280	668720	Is this real world?
671040	672720	I just copied these into the script.
672720	675040	I didn't practice reading these out before I started.
675040	675920	These are really funny.
676960	679120	Doom Eternal is a complete 180
679120	684400	and is very blatantly making fun of the leftist globalist SJW crowd
684400	687680	and likening demons to the refugees and immigrants.
688400	691280	This game is fucking red-pilled as fuck.
691280	694080	And here's an article from redstate.com.
694080	696720	SJWs flip over Doom Eternal
696720	700400	as it mocks leftist political correctness on immigration.
700400	704240	And this article manages to mention both MS-13 and, quote,
704880	706000	rape fugies.
706640	709040	So there are racist anti-immigrant folks
709040	711600	who think the trailer was pandering to them.
711600	712960	Now, I think they're wrong.
713600	716960	But the fact that they have the space to even think that at all
717520	720160	means that it was kind of a bad trailer.
720160	722160	You know, I read it one way,
722160	724640	but the trailer wasn't just made for me, was it?
724640	726560	It was made for a wide audience,
726560	729600	some of whom thought the trailer was being racist.
729600	730960	And they liked it.
730960	734800	Satire requires a clarity of purpose and target,
734800	737360	lest it be mistaken for and contribute to
738000	739840	that which it intends to criticize.
740480	741760	So they say.
741760	744560	So let's take a look at some examples of people on Twitter
744560	746880	who talked about not liking the trailer.
746880	750560	And these come from a post on funnyjunk.com titled
750560	752960	Mortally Challenged Controversy.
752960	754240	One person says,
763520	764560	And then they quote one.
765440	766640	Four likes.
766640	767680	Another user says,
777200	778080	One like.
778080	779120	Another user says,
797680	798960	So what am I doing here?
798960	800880	Why am I reading out these posts?
800880	803360	And why am I saying how many likes they got?
803360	806400	Well, this page on funnyjunk.com
806480	808880	is where all of this came from.
808880	811040	There are a dozen tweets on this page,
811760	814080	none of which were particularly big.
814080	817760	The most retweeted post on here has seven retweets.
817760	819840	And I'd like to point a few more things out.
819840	821760	Those three tweets that I just read out there
821760	824720	all mention that they think the game looks good
824720	826480	despite not liking the jokes.
826480	829680	You know, I'm super excited by things in the new Doom reveal.
829680	830880	The trailer's great.
830880	832480	The game still rules.
832480	834080	And they weren't the only ones.
834080	836720	Doom Eternal looking fucking phenomenal.
836720	839360	But I'm not sure how I feel about the lazy jokes
839360	840880	about political correctness.
840880	844480	And if you noticed here that certain words are highlighted.
844480	847520	They're bold because they're Twitter search terms.
847520	849600	Because whoever put this list together
849600	852160	had to search to find these tweets.
852160	855040	Which, you know, is it really a controversy
855040	857120	if you have to go looking for it?
857120	859520	And most of these people seem pretty excited
859520	860720	about the new Doom game.
860720	863440	They're not on some moral crusade to ban it or anything.
863440	866640	They're just questioning some of the jokes in the trailer.
866640	869200	This person just quoted one of the jokes
869200	871360	and put a roll eyes emoji after it.
872240	872800	That's it.
872800	874640	That's the extent of their outrage.
874640	875760	Their one emoji.
876640	877680	No retweets.
878400	879360	Four likes.
880000	882240	You know, who cares?
882240	884160	Well, I'll tell you who cares.
884160	887360	Billy D of oneangrygamer.net
887360	889600	who wrote a post about the Funny Junk article
889600	891280	and included some tweets of his own.
891840	894720	Which are, like the Funny Junk tweets, fairly tame.
895280	898480	Anyways, I'm hyped about new Doom Eternal still.
898480	900080	But it's a muted hype.
900080	903840	Because I can't ignore that dog whistly immigration joke in the trailer.
903840	905520	Doom Eternal looks good.
905520	908640	But I hope they've adjusted the locked in arena combat stuff.
908640	910880	It was too obvious when that was about to happen.
910880	912560	The bit with the NPCs is great.
913200	915520	Some vaguely concerning satire
915520	919120	using the language surrounding immigration and minorities for the demons.
919760	921760	So we've got muted hype,
922480	923680	vague concern,
924240	925360	kinda wary,
925920	927440	seems kinda lame,
928160	930240	one roll eyes emoji.
930240	932560	You know, where's the outrage here?
932560	935120	And this article finishes out by saying the following.
935680	940160	One Twitter user pointed out that everyone calling the satirical nature of the holograms
940160	943280	comments racist and anti-immigration were just projecting
943280	947360	because it meant that SJW see foreigners as destructive violent demons.
948320	949280	Plot twist.
949280	953360	What if the real racists are the people who aren't racist?
953360	955040	Never seen that one before.
955040	957600	And that's the angle a lot of these people took too.
957600	962320	Except, as we've already seen, plenty of racists and anti-immigration folks
962320	964800	responded positively to the trailer.
964800	967360	Which was to be expected, to be honest.
967360	972080	So the people being vaguely concerned about the tweets are justified in being so.
972080	975840	They're just thinking a couple of moves ahead of old Billy Dee here.
975840	980480	Most of these videos are just reading out this article.
980480	982400	And I can prove that fairly easily.
982400	986640	Look, here's the first tweet in the article and take it away, lads.
986640	992160	Not sure what to think of Doom Eternal having not one but two anti-SJW jokes in it.
992160	997920	Not sure what to think of Doom Eternal having not one but two anti-SJW jokes in it.
997920	1003840	Not sure what to think of Doom Eternal having not one but two anti-SJW jokes in it.
1003840	1007680	Not sure what to do- I'm not sure what to think of Doom Eternal
1007680	1011200	having not one but two anti-SJW jokes in it.
1011200	1016560	Not sure what to think of Doom Eternal having not one but two anti-SJW jokes in it.
1016560	1021840	Not one but two anti-SJW jokes in it.
1021840	1024720	They've all made the same fucking video.
1024720	1030960	There were more YouTube videos made about these tweets than there were tweets.
1031040	1033120	This outrage isn't real.
1033120	1038240	It was constructed to get clicks using the oldest advertising trick in the book.
1038880	1044480	Do what I say because someone you don't like doesn't want you to do it.
1044480	1050080	The psychology behind this meta-outrage industry is pretty sad, really.
1050080	1053360	The title of one video I showed earlier is kind of insightful here.
1054080	1055920	From Geeks and Gamers.
1055920	1062400	And it's Doom Eternal makes SJWs cry and normal people are laughing at them.
1062400	1066480	So it follows that if you laugh at the SJWs, you're normal.
1067040	1069280	Click here to be normal.
1069840	1074480	Click here to be part of the in-group, all hating the out-group.
1074480	1077280	It's the six and a half minutes hate.
1077280	1080800	It's a trick played on people, mostly younger people here,
1080800	1085680	who just aren't developed enough to appreciate enjoying things on their own terms.
1085680	1089040	They can only enjoy something in relation to their peers.
1089040	1093760	I.e. my in-group like it, or more importantly and effectively,
1093760	1095840	my out-group don't like it.
1095840	1098960	And they want to stop me from liking it.
1098960	1103040	And that's how consumerism becomes heroism to these kids.
1103040	1106320	The top comment on Sargon of Akkad's video says,
1106320	1111920	any developer in this day and age willing to stand up against the tyranny of social justice
1111920	1115760	deserves a pre-order for every snowflake tier they cause.
1116480	1118080	Yeah. Well done, guys.
1118080	1122720	You're really sticking it to them by falling into an easy marketing trap, aren't you?
1122720	1128400	You could sell these kids sand in the desert if you told them SJWs didn't like it.
1128400	1130320	Back to the trailer for a second here.
1130320	1134160	And this is my cynical, anti-capitalist side talking,
1134160	1137840	but the people who put the trailers together for these games
1137840	1140640	often aren't the people who designed the game.
1140640	1145520	And maybe they put those jokes in the trailer deliberately to spark this kind of discussion.
1145520	1149440	It's something I'm noticing more of, and it's companies saying,
1149440	1156160	you know, if we're sort of ambiguously, but not really, but arguably racist,
1156160	1159760	everyone's gonna argue about whether we were racist or not.
1159760	1163520	And in the process, they'll be talking about our product.
1163520	1168560	And from funny junk to one angry gamer to all these guys to me,
1169200	1172080	and then to you, now, we did talk about it.
1172080	1175600	What a human centipede of content we have here.
1175600	1176800	Is that what happened?
1177920	1178420	Maybe.
1179120	1180400	It worked, if so.
1180400	1184400	You know, bravo, marketing guys, you made us all talk about Doom.
1184400	1188720	Congratulations, you soulless, manipulative parasites.
1188720	1192400	And I hope that is what happened, actually, because there is another alternative here
1192400	1196480	that I don't really want to be the truth, because I was looking forward to this game.
1197280	1198960	But maybe the game is just bad.
1199760	1201920	Maybe it's just rubbish now.
1201920	1206560	Doom 2016 was surprisingly good and surprisingly popular.
1206560	1211200	And it's possible that going forward, the series will chase that popularity
1211200	1213360	and lose what message it had.
1213360	1218080	Look at another Bethesda-produced game that's coming up, Fallout 76.
1218080	1222560	Now, Fallout was a game series initially about the horrors of surviving
1222560	1224960	in a post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland,
1224960	1228720	and now is being marketed as get together with all your pals
1228720	1232960	and nuke the next town to get some loot crates or whatever.
1233520	1237440	So it's possible that this game is just gonna be crap.
1237440	1240400	Maybe they'll forget the messaging of the previous game
1240400	1244400	and put out a story in which the demons are just bad outsiders
1244400	1247040	who need to be killed because they're bad.
1247040	1251040	Maybe they'll forget that Samuel Hayden is supposed to be the bad guy,
1251120	1254000	or they'll have him as the final boss for no other reason
1254000	1257280	than he's a character in the series who could be a final boss
1257280	1260480	instead of it making narrative sense for him to play that role.
1261360	1264560	I don't know. I hope not, but it's all possible.
1264560	1266720	So, good job, Doom trailer.
1266720	1271680	You made me wonder about how much worse than its predecessor the next game is going to be.
1272480	1278080	But, you know, the shotgun has a hook on it now, and that looks cool.
1278080	1280320	It's about time for me to wrap up here, folks,
1280320	1282800	but, uh, sympathize with me a little.
1282800	1287120	I usually like to end my video scripts on something weighty, you know?
1287120	1289120	Something with some punch to it.
1289120	1292080	But that's difficult here because nothing happened.
1292080	1296160	You know, lots of people said something happened, but it didn't.
1296160	1299360	And it was relatively trivial to show that it didn't happen too,
1299360	1301680	so I'm a bit deflated, to be honest.
1301680	1303600	I feel like this one's just gonna fizzle out.
1304480	1306960	I don't have anything killer to go out on.
1306960	1310640	I could talk about the hypocrisy of the YouTube outrage industry
1310640	1313200	solely targeting, quote, SJWs,
1313200	1317680	when there are plenty of examples of racists taking the trailer seriously online.
1318240	1320800	You know, you could make a video in the style of one of theirs
1320800	1322720	going through a poll thread or whatever
1322720	1327360	and mocking all the people thinking the game is, quote, red-pilled and the likes.
1327360	1330000	They don't do that, though, do they?
1330000	1332640	It's sort of revealing in its absence there.
1332640	1339040	So why do they instead endlessly attack this nebulous idea of SJWs?
1339600	1343120	And it's because the narrative they've built needs enemies.
1343680	1347360	And SJWs are good and useful enemies.
1347360	1349040	Anyone can be one.
1349040	1354640	There's no criteria for it other than doing something that anti-SJWs don't like,
1354640	1358720	such as not being sufficiently excited about a video game trailer.
1358720	1362320	SJWs are crazed, mindless opponents
1362320	1367520	who are numberless, can turn up anywhere, and are always easily defeated,
1367520	1370560	while somehow simultaneously being the puppet masters
1370560	1373680	behind a conspiracy to destroy Western civilization.
1373680	1377440	SJWs hate us for being straight white males,
1377440	1380720	and thus we never have to feel bad about fighting them.
1380720	1382800	They hate us just because.
1382800	1385680	So our hatred of them is justified.
1385680	1387840	It's a narrative of victimization.
1387920	1392800	They want to be under attack, but they don't ever want to actually risk being beaten.
1392800	1395600	So they make up an easy enemy to fight.
1395600	1397360	And then to maintain the illusion,
1397360	1400800	they just have to selectively turn their brains off every now and then
1400800	1404880	and watch a man complain to 700,000 people
1404880	1409680	that a tweet with two likes on it is taking something too seriously.
1410240	1412240	Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.
1412240	1415120	What do we think? Was that punchy enough of an ending there?
1415920	1417600	I don't know. It'll do, won't it?
1417600	1420960	I went with the SJW demon comparison there,
1420960	1426160	but I didn't outright state it, and that way anyone who noticed it would feel clever.
1426160	1428720	It's the best I could do given the circumstances.
1428720	1431920	It's hard to make a video where nothing happens, you know?
1431920	1435680	I wish I could just read out other people's articles I found on the internet.
1435680	1436560	That'd be easy.
1437200	1442240	If I was this Billy Dee chap over at One Angry Gamer or whatever, I'd be furious.
1442240	1443840	I didn't see that in the script either.
1443840	1446320	Of course he'd be furious. He's one angry gamer.
1446320	1449760	But yeah, all those people just copying his article.
1449760	1450480	It's terrible.
