00:00.000 --> 00:07.200
Hello, everyone. Today, we're going to be talking about Doom Eternal, and no, I don't mean Brexit.

00:09.120 --> 00:13.120
That's the only joke in today's video, everyone. I hope you enjoyed it.

00:13.560 --> 00:19.040
So anyway, before we actually get to Doom Eternal, if you remember, late last year,

00:19.040 --> 00:26.720
I made a video about Cuphead and the various non-controversies associated with it called Cuphead the Fake Outrage,

00:27.360 --> 00:32.880
which is a cleverly ambiguous, algorithm-fooling title there, if I do say so myself.

00:32.880 --> 00:38.960
Cuphead, as a recent popular game, was being discussed and critiqued by games journalists and consumers

00:38.960 --> 00:42.720
in articles and videos and Twitter conversations and the likes.

00:42.720 --> 00:48.720
Now, what my video did was expose how various anti-feminist, anti-social justice folks online

00:48.720 --> 00:52.160
lied about the nature of the discussions and critiques of Cuphead

00:52.160 --> 00:56.400
in order to conjure the specter of an evil SJW outrage monster

00:56.400 --> 01:00.240
that wants to take away their audience's new favorite video game.

01:00.240 --> 01:03.200
It's a sort of constructed meta-outrage.

01:03.200 --> 01:08.080
You know, you act outraged about the air-quote SJWs being outraged,

01:08.080 --> 01:11.360
except you also made the SJWs up.

01:11.360 --> 01:15.120
It's shameless clickbait pandering tactics, basically.

01:15.840 --> 01:20.320
Cuphead the Fake Outrage was a landmark video in the history of games journalism

01:20.320 --> 01:22.400
and changed the face of YouTube forever.

01:24.080 --> 01:29.440
The meta-outrage industry was shamed into silence, collectively promising that in the future

01:29.440 --> 01:33.600
they would only respond proportionally to real, substantial news stories

01:33.600 --> 01:37.120
about things that actually happened in reality.

01:37.120 --> 01:40.240
And having gotten that completely real setup out of the way there,

01:40.240 --> 01:45.440
it's time to take a big sip of coffee and do a YouTube search for Doom Eternal.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.720
Oh, no. What's happened here, then?

01:49.440 --> 01:53.520
SJW snowflakes triggered by Doom Eternal.

01:53.520 --> 01:58.320
SJW outrage ensures Doom Eternal will be bestseller.

01:58.320 --> 02:02.960
SJWs flip over Doom Eternal mocking immigration.

02:03.600 --> 02:08.560
YouTubers Sargon of Akkad, No Bullshit, and The Quartering there,

02:08.560 --> 02:14.960
all talking about how the SJWs are triggered and outraged and so on about Doom Eternal.

02:14.960 --> 02:18.240
And those three weren't the only ones who made videos about this topic.

02:18.240 --> 02:24.400
There's also Geeks and Gamers, Optimus, Dr. Shame, Steve Talon,

02:24.400 --> 02:29.600
Maltered Bampot, Half-Harry, Timkast, Xander Scullion,

02:29.600 --> 02:33.920
Weaponized Nerd Rage, Jacob Strickland, The Good Old Gamer,

02:33.920 --> 02:36.720
The Hyrule Bard, A Guy and His Games,

02:36.720 --> 02:40.640
Resident Evil God, Millennial Reject, McDovin,

02:40.640 --> 02:43.920
Rundan, FM Vipera, Prince of Fallen,

02:43.920 --> 02:47.920
Gamers Cafe, The Hellwalker, Zanyvids, American Krogan,

02:47.920 --> 02:51.120
Vossen Media, It's a Gundam, Scummy Rebel, Jim the Ape,

02:51.120 --> 02:54.080
Moybridge, Chosen Civil Talk, Yellow Flash Productions,

02:54.080 --> 02:56.480
Mr. H Reviews, and Channel Reason.

02:57.680 --> 02:59.680
Now, all of this was confusing to me,

02:59.680 --> 03:03.040
as I sit on the ruling council of SJWs here online,

03:03.040 --> 03:06.240
and I'd not heard anything about this Doom Eternal stuff.

03:06.240 --> 03:08.080
And I love being offended about things,

03:08.080 --> 03:11.760
so honestly, it's kind of annoying that an opportunity to be offended

03:11.760 --> 03:13.440
seems to have slipped me by.

03:13.440 --> 03:16.080
So then, let's see if we can figure out what happened here,

03:16.080 --> 03:18.880
and maybe get in on the outrage ourselves.

03:18.880 --> 03:23.760
So, Doom Eternal is the upcoming sequel to id Software's 2016 reboot

03:23.760 --> 03:30.000
of the Doom franchise, unhelpfully titled Doom, not Doom 4,

03:30.000 --> 03:33.600
because fuck sequentially numbered sequels, apparently.

03:33.600 --> 03:38.400
Doom 2016 was an excellent game, and rightfully received critical acclaim.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.880
It looked really good, the music was great,

03:40.880 --> 03:43.360
the fast-paced combat was consistently fun,

03:43.360 --> 03:45.360
you know, whatever, I'm not a games review channel,

03:45.360 --> 03:48.160
so I'll just say, it was almost always really good.

03:48.160 --> 03:50.560
I streamed it recently on my Twitch channel,

03:50.560 --> 03:53.840
and had a grand old time, except for one part when the game glitched

03:53.840 --> 03:56.160
as I was killing an enemy and dropped me out on the map.

03:56.160 --> 03:58.800
But you know, otherwise, it's very good.

03:58.800 --> 04:02.080
Now, if we want to understand all of this mess,

04:02.080 --> 04:04.960
what we do need to talk about here is the game's narrative.

04:04.960 --> 04:06.320
So, spoiler warning.

04:07.040 --> 04:10.160
In the future, there's some sort of energy crisis on Earth,

04:10.160 --> 04:14.480
which is solved by the Union Aerospace Corporation, or UAC,

04:15.120 --> 04:18.560
opening up a portal to hell on Mars.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.240
They then siphon, quote,

04:20.240 --> 04:25.360
hell energy out of hell and process it into usable energy in our dimension.

04:25.360 --> 04:28.160
Unsurprisingly, things soon go awry,

04:28.160 --> 04:32.400
and a bunch of hell demons invade the UAC's Mars facility.

04:32.400 --> 04:36.080
Players play as the Doom Slayer, which is a wonderful name,

04:36.080 --> 04:38.800
who's awakened from hibernation on Mars

04:38.800 --> 04:41.200
in order to put a stop to the invasion.

04:41.200 --> 04:44.720
And they then spend the game hopping back and forth between Mars and hell,

04:44.720 --> 04:48.240
accomplishing objectives and trying to sever the link between the worlds.

04:48.240 --> 04:52.000
So it's a wonderfully cheesy setup for a game story there.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.800
So the question we have to ask here is, who are the antagonists in Doom?

04:57.360 --> 04:59.120
Well, it's the demons, right?

04:59.120 --> 05:02.480
All the evil hell demons you spend your time fighting against.

05:02.480 --> 05:04.320
Well, not really, no.

05:05.280 --> 05:09.280
The hell demons are technically evil and bad,

05:09.280 --> 05:10.720
but, you know, they're hell demons.

05:10.720 --> 05:14.080
What do you expect? You get what you sign up for with hell demons.

05:14.720 --> 05:18.560
They're presented more as a force of nature than anything else.

05:18.560 --> 05:22.320
The actual, quote, bad guys in Doom are the UAC,

05:22.320 --> 05:26.000
the mega-corporation that actually opened the portal to hell.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.840
The leadership of the UAC are presented as driven by profit and greed and personal gain.

05:31.840 --> 05:34.960
We have the corrupted head of research, Olivia Pierce,

05:34.960 --> 05:37.600
who ends up being the final boss of the game,

05:37.600 --> 05:42.480
and the chairman of the UAC, Samuel Hayden, the soulless CEO robot.

05:43.520 --> 05:44.640
Samuel Hayden.

05:45.440 --> 05:46.400
S. Hayden.

05:47.200 --> 05:47.920
Satan.

05:49.200 --> 05:50.080
You get it.

05:50.080 --> 05:54.960
The UAC are the reason for the conflict in Doom, not the demons.

05:54.960 --> 05:57.840
Samuel Hayden is introduced right after you wake up,

05:57.840 --> 06:01.120
contacting you via a computer screen to offer to work together

06:01.120 --> 06:04.320
to solve this problem in a way that benefits us both.

06:04.880 --> 06:08.720
In response to which, your character grabs the computer and just throws it away,

06:08.720 --> 06:10.400
which is really funny.

06:10.400 --> 06:13.360
And shortly afterwards, the following cutscene happens.

06:14.320 --> 06:19.760
I'm willing to take full responsibility for the horrible events of the last 24 hours,

06:19.760 --> 06:22.560
but you must understand,

06:22.560 --> 06:27.680
our interest in their world was purely for the betterment of mankind.

06:29.040 --> 06:32.080
Everything has clearly gotten out of hand now, yes,

06:33.440 --> 06:36.800
but it was worth the risk, I assure you.

06:38.880 --> 06:41.040
And that's the one joke in Doom there.

06:41.040 --> 06:42.240
It'll say something like,

06:42.240 --> 06:44.560
this was for the benefit of mankind,

06:44.560 --> 06:46.240
and then it pans to a dead guy.

06:46.960 --> 06:48.640
It's funny, it's a good joke.

06:48.640 --> 06:51.680
So the point is made right at the start of the game there.

06:51.680 --> 06:53.760
The corporation is bad.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.680
And there's plenty of jokes in the story

06:55.680 --> 06:59.760
about the mixing of corporate culture with the demonic invasion.

06:59.760 --> 07:03.520
And notable for us here are the various friendly announcement holograms

07:03.520 --> 07:04.800
present throughout the game.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.080
And they say things like,

07:06.720 --> 07:09.840
weaponizing demons for a brighter tomorrow.

07:09.840 --> 07:13.440
There will be an open forum to resolve any questions or concerns

07:13.440 --> 07:15.840
on the initiative to weaponize the demons.

07:16.400 --> 07:19.040
Go beyond mere mortal limitations.

07:19.040 --> 07:22.320
See Jessica in Human Resources to find out if you qualify.

07:22.320 --> 07:24.160
You know, hardy-har.

07:24.160 --> 07:29.040
They're using corporate speak to put a positive spin on the demonic invasion.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.240
I apologize here.

07:30.240 --> 07:32.160
I'm not making fun of this joke.

07:32.160 --> 07:35.360
Everything's just unfunny when you break it down to the fundamentals.

07:35.360 --> 07:38.160
I can't really help ruining these jokes here.

07:38.160 --> 07:41.600
Anyway, this brings us to the QuakeCon gameplay trailer,

07:41.600 --> 07:45.680
the one that is supposedly the source of all the SJW outrage.

07:45.680 --> 07:50.400
Now, this trailer also had the friendly corporate announcement holograms.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.840
Please remain calm.

07:53.840 --> 07:57.040
You may notice a slight change in the environment.

07:57.840 --> 08:00.000
A slight change in the environment?

08:00.000 --> 08:02.080
But that's not a slight change.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.680
That's a really big change.

08:04.320 --> 08:04.820
You get it.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.480
Now, the lines we're concerned about here are the following.

08:09.040 --> 08:10.640
My brothers and sisters,

08:10.640 --> 08:14.560
let's help to make our friends transition into their new world a comfortable one.

08:15.440 --> 08:18.400
Remember, demon can be an offensive term.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.960
Refer to them as mortally challenged.

08:21.520 --> 08:24.960
And Earth is the melting pot of the universe.

08:24.960 --> 08:27.120
So what do we think about these lines?

08:27.120 --> 08:29.360
Well, when I watched the trailer,

08:29.360 --> 08:32.320
I found them a little eye-rolling, to be honest.

08:32.320 --> 08:36.640
But I figured they were just going for the same sort of thing as the previous game.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.520
You know, they're satirizing corporate culture.

08:39.520 --> 08:42.640
And particularly here, they're satirizing how corporations

08:42.640 --> 08:47.600
can co-opt progressive language in an attempt to spin their various evil doings.

08:48.240 --> 08:52.000
Well, that was my take on the trailer, anyway.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.160
And because it was my opinion, it was the only correct one.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.600
And anyone who had a different opinion was wrong, and I was shocked.

09:00.160 --> 09:03.600
Shocked to discover anyone could dare to think differently than me,

09:03.600 --> 09:05.200
who was right about everything.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.360
I kid, of course.

09:07.360 --> 09:09.360
I've been on the internet for a while now,

09:09.360 --> 09:11.280
so when I watched the trailer, I thought,

09:12.240 --> 09:15.600
Okay, someone without the full context there,

09:15.600 --> 09:18.960
like someone who didn't play or remember the previous game in the series,

09:18.960 --> 09:22.240
or just someone who has a different opinion about the game than me,

09:22.880 --> 09:25.440
they could have read those lines not as a satire

09:25.440 --> 09:27.600
of corporate co-opting of progressive language,

09:27.600 --> 09:31.040
but as a satire of progressive language itself.

09:31.040 --> 09:32.880
Well, I'm narrativizing a bit there.

09:32.880 --> 09:35.520
My actual first thought when I watched the trailer was,

09:35.520 --> 09:36.880
mortally challenged.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.640
Wasn't that a Discworld joke?

09:38.640 --> 09:40.480
And then I went and checked and I was like,

09:40.480 --> 09:43.040
Hey, it was, they're stealing Terry Pratchett's jokes.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.920
But for the purposes of this video,

09:45.920 --> 09:48.720
I'm gonna streamline my thought process here.

09:48.720 --> 09:51.040
So the next thing I thought was,

09:51.040 --> 09:53.040
there's two types of reactions here

09:53.040 --> 09:56.880
if you're someone who thinks the trailer is mocking progressive language.

09:56.880 --> 09:58.720
If you're on the left, you probably thought,

09:58.720 --> 10:01.120
Oh, well, that sucks.

10:01.120 --> 10:03.600
You know, the previous game could fairly be read as

10:03.600 --> 10:08.080
anti-corporate, anti-capitalist, pro-environmentalism, you know?

10:08.080 --> 10:10.080
And it was produced by Bethesda,

10:10.080 --> 10:12.640
who also produced the Wolfenstein series,

10:12.640 --> 10:15.760
which has Nazis being bad people in the story,

10:15.760 --> 10:17.760
who it's okay to fight against.

10:18.320 --> 10:20.480
It's weird how that's noteworthy these days.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.880
So to see this new Doom trailer

10:22.880 --> 10:25.600
pandering to anti-political correctness, folks,

10:25.600 --> 10:27.600
must be fairly disappointing.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.760
The other type of reaction you could have is

10:29.760 --> 10:33.360
if you were an anti-immigrant, anti-political correctness type,

10:33.360 --> 10:34.640
you might think,

10:34.640 --> 10:38.240
Yes, excellent. This game is pandering to me.

10:38.240 --> 10:42.000
For example, here are the opening posts of some threads about the trailer

10:42.000 --> 10:44.800
from 4chan's far-right politics board.

10:45.600 --> 10:51.760
Is there any game more anti-migrant than new Doom Eternal 2019?

10:51.760 --> 10:55.840
Basically, replace all the words demons with immigrants.

10:55.840 --> 10:57.120
Hologram is saying.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.520
Doom 2018.

10:59.520 --> 11:02.160
Earth is melting pot of the universe.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.440
WTF?

11:03.440 --> 11:07.280
Paltier memes in biggest shotter of this decade.

11:07.280 --> 11:08.720
Is this real world?

11:11.040 --> 11:12.720
I just copied these into the script.

11:12.720 --> 11:15.040
I didn't practice reading these out before I started.

11:15.040 --> 11:15.920
These are really funny.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.120
Doom Eternal is a complete 180

11:19.120 --> 11:24.400
and is very blatantly making fun of the leftist globalist SJW crowd

11:24.400 --> 11:27.680
and likening demons to the refugees and immigrants.

11:28.400 --> 11:31.280
This game is fucking red-pilled as fuck.

11:31.280 --> 11:34.080
And here's an article from redstate.com.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.720
SJWs flip over Doom Eternal

11:36.720 --> 11:40.400
as it mocks leftist political correctness on immigration.

11:40.400 --> 11:44.240
And this article manages to mention both MS-13 and, quote,

11:44.880 --> 11:46.000
rape fugies.

11:46.640 --> 11:49.040
So there are racist anti-immigrant folks

11:49.040 --> 11:51.600
who think the trailer was pandering to them.

11:51.600 --> 11:52.960
Now, I think they're wrong.

11:53.600 --> 11:56.960
But the fact that they have the space to even think that at all

11:57.520 --> 12:00.160
means that it was kind of a bad trailer.

12:00.160 --> 12:02.160
You know, I read it one way,

12:02.160 --> 12:04.640
but the trailer wasn't just made for me, was it?

12:04.640 --> 12:06.560
It was made for a wide audience,

12:06.560 --> 12:09.600
some of whom thought the trailer was being racist.

12:09.600 --> 12:10.960
And they liked it.

12:10.960 --> 12:14.800
Satire requires a clarity of purpose and target,

12:14.800 --> 12:17.360
lest it be mistaken for and contribute to

12:18.000 --> 12:19.840
that which it intends to criticize.

12:20.480 --> 12:21.760
So they say.

12:21.760 --> 12:24.560
So let's take a look at some examples of people on Twitter

12:24.560 --> 12:26.880
who talked about not liking the trailer.

12:26.880 --> 12:30.560
And these come from a post on funnyjunk.com titled

12:30.560 --> 12:32.960
Mortally Challenged Controversy.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.240
One person says,

12:43.520 --> 12:44.560
And then they quote one.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.640
Four likes.

12:46.640 --> 12:47.680
Another user says,

12:57.200 --> 12:58.080
One like.

12:58.080 --> 12:59.120
Another user says,

13:17.680 --> 13:18.960
So what am I doing here?

13:18.960 --> 13:20.880
Why am I reading out these posts?

13:20.880 --> 13:23.360
And why am I saying how many likes they got?

13:23.360 --> 13:26.400
Well, this page on funnyjunk.com

13:26.480 --> 13:28.880
is where all of this came from.

13:28.880 --> 13:31.040
There are a dozen tweets on this page,

13:31.760 --> 13:34.080
none of which were particularly big.

13:34.080 --> 13:37.760
The most retweeted post on here has seven retweets.

13:37.760 --> 13:39.840
And I'd like to point a few more things out.

13:39.840 --> 13:41.760
Those three tweets that I just read out there

13:41.760 --> 13:44.720
all mention that they think the game looks good

13:44.720 --> 13:46.480
despite not liking the jokes.

13:46.480 --> 13:49.680
You know, I'm super excited by things in the new Doom reveal.

13:49.680 --> 13:50.880
The trailer's great.

13:50.880 --> 13:52.480
The game still rules.

13:52.480 --> 13:54.080
And they weren't the only ones.

13:54.080 --> 13:56.720
Doom Eternal looking fucking phenomenal.

13:56.720 --> 13:59.360
But I'm not sure how I feel about the lazy jokes

13:59.360 --> 14:00.880
about political correctness.

14:00.880 --> 14:04.480
And if you noticed here that certain words are highlighted.

14:04.480 --> 14:07.520
They're bold because they're Twitter search terms.

14:07.520 --> 14:09.600
Because whoever put this list together

14:09.600 --> 14:12.160
had to search to find these tweets.

14:12.160 --> 14:15.040
Which, you know, is it really a controversy

14:15.040 --> 14:17.120
if you have to go looking for it?

14:17.120 --> 14:19.520
And most of these people seem pretty excited

14:19.520 --> 14:20.720
about the new Doom game.

14:20.720 --> 14:23.440
They're not on some moral crusade to ban it or anything.

14:23.440 --> 14:26.640
They're just questioning some of the jokes in the trailer.

14:26.640 --> 14:29.200
This person just quoted one of the jokes

14:29.200 --> 14:31.360
and put a roll eyes emoji after it.

14:32.240 --> 14:32.800
That's it.

14:32.800 --> 14:34.640
That's the extent of their outrage.

14:34.640 --> 14:35.760
Their one emoji.

14:36.640 --> 14:37.680
No retweets.

14:38.400 --> 14:39.360
Four likes.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.240
You know, who cares?

14:42.240 --> 14:44.160
Well, I'll tell you who cares.

14:44.160 --> 14:47.360
Billy D of oneangrygamer.net

14:47.360 --> 14:49.600
who wrote a post about the Funny Junk article

14:49.600 --> 14:51.280
and included some tweets of his own.

14:51.840 --> 14:54.720
Which are, like the Funny Junk tweets, fairly tame.

14:55.280 --> 14:58.480
Anyways, I'm hyped about new Doom Eternal still.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.080
But it's a muted hype.

15:00.080 --> 15:03.840
Because I can't ignore that dog whistly immigration joke in the trailer.

15:03.840 --> 15:05.520
Doom Eternal looks good.

15:05.520 --> 15:08.640
But I hope they've adjusted the locked in arena combat stuff.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.880
It was too obvious when that was about to happen.

15:10.880 --> 15:12.560
The bit with the NPCs is great.

15:13.200 --> 15:15.520
Some vaguely concerning satire

15:15.520 --> 15:19.120
using the language surrounding immigration and minorities for the demons.

15:19.760 --> 15:21.760
So we've got muted hype,

15:22.480 --> 15:23.680
vague concern,

15:24.240 --> 15:25.360
kinda wary,

15:25.920 --> 15:27.440
seems kinda lame,

15:28.160 --> 15:30.240
one roll eyes emoji.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.560
You know, where's the outrage here?

15:32.560 --> 15:35.120
And this article finishes out by saying the following.

15:35.680 --> 15:40.160
One Twitter user pointed out that everyone calling the satirical nature of the holograms

15:40.160 --> 15:43.280
comments racist and anti-immigration were just projecting

15:43.280 --> 15:47.360
because it meant that SJW see foreigners as destructive violent demons.

15:48.320 --> 15:49.280
Plot twist.

15:49.280 --> 15:53.360
What if the real racists are the people who aren't racist?

15:53.360 --> 15:55.040
Never seen that one before.

15:55.040 --> 15:57.600
And that's the angle a lot of these people took too.

15:57.600 --> 16:02.320
Except, as we've already seen, plenty of racists and anti-immigration folks

16:02.320 --> 16:04.800
responded positively to the trailer.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.360
Which was to be expected, to be honest.

16:07.360 --> 16:12.080
So the people being vaguely concerned about the tweets are justified in being so.

16:12.080 --> 16:15.840
They're just thinking a couple of moves ahead of old Billy Dee here.

16:15.840 --> 16:20.480
Most of these videos are just reading out this article.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.400
And I can prove that fairly easily.

16:22.400 --> 16:26.640
Look, here's the first tweet in the article and take it away, lads.

16:26.640 --> 16:32.160
Not sure what to think of Doom Eternal having not one but two anti-SJW jokes in it.

16:32.160 --> 16:37.920
Not sure what to think of Doom Eternal having not one but two anti-SJW jokes in it.

16:37.920 --> 16:43.840
Not sure what to think of Doom Eternal having not one but two anti-SJW jokes in it.

16:43.840 --> 16:47.680
Not sure what to do- I'm not sure what to think of Doom Eternal

16:47.680 --> 16:51.200
having not one but two anti-SJW jokes in it.

16:51.200 --> 16:56.560
Not sure what to think of Doom Eternal having not one but two anti-SJW jokes in it.

16:56.560 --> 17:01.840
Not one but two anti-SJW jokes in it.

17:01.840 --> 17:04.720
They've all made the same fucking video.

17:04.720 --> 17:10.960
There were more YouTube videos made about these tweets than there were tweets.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.120
This outrage isn't real.

17:13.120 --> 17:18.240
It was constructed to get clicks using the oldest advertising trick in the book.

17:18.880 --> 17:24.480
Do what I say because someone you don't like doesn't want you to do it.

17:24.480 --> 17:30.080
The psychology behind this meta-outrage industry is pretty sad, really.

17:30.080 --> 17:33.360
The title of one video I showed earlier is kind of insightful here.

17:34.080 --> 17:35.920
From Geeks and Gamers.

17:35.920 --> 17:42.400
And it's Doom Eternal makes SJWs cry and normal people are laughing at them.

17:42.400 --> 17:46.480
So it follows that if you laugh at the SJWs, you're normal.

17:47.040 --> 17:49.280
Click here to be normal.

17:49.840 --> 17:54.480
Click here to be part of the in-group, all hating the out-group.

17:54.480 --> 17:57.280
It's the six and a half minutes hate.

17:57.280 --> 18:00.800
It's a trick played on people, mostly younger people here,

18:00.800 --> 18:05.680
who just aren't developed enough to appreciate enjoying things on their own terms.

18:05.680 --> 18:09.040
They can only enjoy something in relation to their peers.

18:09.040 --> 18:13.760
I.e. my in-group like it, or more importantly and effectively,

18:13.760 --> 18:15.840
my out-group don't like it.

18:15.840 --> 18:18.960
And they want to stop me from liking it.

18:18.960 --> 18:23.040
And that's how consumerism becomes heroism to these kids.

18:23.040 --> 18:26.320
The top comment on Sargon of Akkad's video says,

18:26.320 --> 18:31.920
any developer in this day and age willing to stand up against the tyranny of social justice

18:31.920 --> 18:35.760
deserves a pre-order for every snowflake tier they cause.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.080
Yeah. Well done, guys.

18:38.080 --> 18:42.720
You're really sticking it to them by falling into an easy marketing trap, aren't you?

18:42.720 --> 18:48.400
You could sell these kids sand in the desert if you told them SJWs didn't like it.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.320
Back to the trailer for a second here.

18:50.320 --> 18:54.160
And this is my cynical, anti-capitalist side talking,

18:54.160 --> 18:57.840
but the people who put the trailers together for these games

18:57.840 --> 19:00.640
often aren't the people who designed the game.

19:00.640 --> 19:05.520
And maybe they put those jokes in the trailer deliberately to spark this kind of discussion.

19:05.520 --> 19:09.440
It's something I'm noticing more of, and it's companies saying,

19:09.440 --> 19:16.160
you know, if we're sort of ambiguously, but not really, but arguably racist,

19:16.160 --> 19:19.760
everyone's gonna argue about whether we were racist or not.

19:19.760 --> 19:23.520
And in the process, they'll be talking about our product.

19:23.520 --> 19:28.560
And from funny junk to one angry gamer to all these guys to me,

19:29.200 --> 19:32.080
and then to you, now, we did talk about it.

19:32.080 --> 19:35.600
What a human centipede of content we have here.

19:35.600 --> 19:36.800
Is that what happened?

19:37.920 --> 19:38.420
Maybe.

19:39.120 --> 19:40.400
It worked, if so.

19:40.400 --> 19:44.400
You know, bravo, marketing guys, you made us all talk about Doom.

19:44.400 --> 19:48.720
Congratulations, you soulless, manipulative parasites.

19:48.720 --> 19:52.400
And I hope that is what happened, actually, because there is another alternative here

19:52.400 --> 19:56.480
that I don't really want to be the truth, because I was looking forward to this game.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.960
But maybe the game is just bad.

19:59.760 --> 20:01.920
Maybe it's just rubbish now.

20:01.920 --> 20:06.560
Doom 2016 was surprisingly good and surprisingly popular.

20:06.560 --> 20:11.200
And it's possible that going forward, the series will chase that popularity

20:11.200 --> 20:13.360
and lose what message it had.

20:13.360 --> 20:18.080
Look at another Bethesda-produced game that's coming up, Fallout 76.

20:18.080 --> 20:22.560
Now, Fallout was a game series initially about the horrors of surviving

20:22.560 --> 20:24.960
in a post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland,

20:24.960 --> 20:28.720
and now is being marketed as get together with all your pals

20:28.720 --> 20:32.960
and nuke the next town to get some loot crates or whatever.

20:33.520 --> 20:37.440
So it's possible that this game is just gonna be crap.

20:37.440 --> 20:40.400
Maybe they'll forget the messaging of the previous game

20:40.400 --> 20:44.400
and put out a story in which the demons are just bad outsiders

20:44.400 --> 20:47.040
who need to be killed because they're bad.

20:47.040 --> 20:51.040
Maybe they'll forget that Samuel Hayden is supposed to be the bad guy,

20:51.120 --> 20:54.000
or they'll have him as the final boss for no other reason

20:54.000 --> 20:57.280
than he's a character in the series who could be a final boss

20:57.280 --> 21:00.480
instead of it making narrative sense for him to play that role.

21:01.360 --> 21:04.560
I don't know. I hope not, but it's all possible.

21:04.560 --> 21:06.720
So, good job, Doom trailer.

21:06.720 --> 21:11.680
You made me wonder about how much worse than its predecessor the next game is going to be.

21:12.480 --> 21:18.080
But, you know, the shotgun has a hook on it now, and that looks cool.

21:18.080 --> 21:20.320
It's about time for me to wrap up here, folks,

21:20.320 --> 21:22.800
but, uh, sympathize with me a little.

21:22.800 --> 21:27.120
I usually like to end my video scripts on something weighty, you know?

21:27.120 --> 21:29.120
Something with some punch to it.

21:29.120 --> 21:32.080
But that's difficult here because nothing happened.

21:32.080 --> 21:36.160
You know, lots of people said something happened, but it didn't.

21:36.160 --> 21:39.360
And it was relatively trivial to show that it didn't happen too,

21:39.360 --> 21:41.680
so I'm a bit deflated, to be honest.

21:41.680 --> 21:43.600
I feel like this one's just gonna fizzle out.

21:44.480 --> 21:46.960
I don't have anything killer to go out on.

21:46.960 --> 21:50.640
I could talk about the hypocrisy of the YouTube outrage industry

21:50.640 --> 21:53.200
solely targeting, quote, SJWs,

21:53.200 --> 21:57.680
when there are plenty of examples of racists taking the trailer seriously online.

21:58.240 --> 22:00.800
You know, you could make a video in the style of one of theirs

22:00.800 --> 22:02.720
going through a poll thread or whatever

22:02.720 --> 22:07.360
and mocking all the people thinking the game is, quote, red-pilled and the likes.

22:07.360 --> 22:10.000
They don't do that, though, do they?

22:10.000 --> 22:12.640
It's sort of revealing in its absence there.

22:12.640 --> 22:19.040
So why do they instead endlessly attack this nebulous idea of SJWs?

22:19.600 --> 22:23.120
And it's because the narrative they've built needs enemies.

22:23.680 --> 22:27.360
And SJWs are good and useful enemies.

22:27.360 --> 22:29.040
Anyone can be one.

22:29.040 --> 22:34.640
There's no criteria for it other than doing something that anti-SJWs don't like,

22:34.640 --> 22:38.720
such as not being sufficiently excited about a video game trailer.

22:38.720 --> 22:42.320
SJWs are crazed, mindless opponents

22:42.320 --> 22:47.520
who are numberless, can turn up anywhere, and are always easily defeated,

22:47.520 --> 22:50.560
while somehow simultaneously being the puppet masters

22:50.560 --> 22:53.680
behind a conspiracy to destroy Western civilization.

22:53.680 --> 22:57.440
SJWs hate us for being straight white males,

22:57.440 --> 23:00.720
and thus we never have to feel bad about fighting them.

23:00.720 --> 23:02.800
They hate us just because.

23:02.800 --> 23:05.680
So our hatred of them is justified.

23:05.680 --> 23:07.840
It's a narrative of victimization.

23:07.920 --> 23:12.800
They want to be under attack, but they don't ever want to actually risk being beaten.

23:12.800 --> 23:15.600
So they make up an easy enemy to fight.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.360
And then to maintain the illusion,

23:17.360 --> 23:20.800
they just have to selectively turn their brains off every now and then

23:20.800 --> 23:24.880
and watch a man complain to 700,000 people

23:24.880 --> 23:29.680
that a tweet with two likes on it is taking something too seriously.

23:30.240 --> 23:32.240
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

23:32.240 --> 23:35.120
What do we think? Was that punchy enough of an ending there?

23:35.920 --> 23:37.600
I don't know. It'll do, won't it?

23:37.600 --> 23:40.960
I went with the SJW demon comparison there,

23:40.960 --> 23:46.160
but I didn't outright state it, and that way anyone who noticed it would feel clever.

23:46.160 --> 23:48.720
It's the best I could do given the circumstances.

23:48.720 --> 23:51.920
It's hard to make a video where nothing happens, you know?

23:51.920 --> 23:55.680
I wish I could just read out other people's articles I found on the internet.

23:55.680 --> 23:56.560
That'd be easy.

23:57.200 --> 24:02.240
If I was this Billy Dee chap over at One Angry Gamer or whatever, I'd be furious.

24:02.240 --> 24:03.840
I didn't see that in the script either.

24:03.840 --> 24:06.320
Of course he'd be furious. He's one angry gamer.

24:06.320 --> 24:09.760
But yeah, all those people just copying his article.

24:09.760 --> 24:10.480
It's terrible.

24:11.040 --> 24:15.600
If you'd like more videos about nothing, consider supporting me on Patreon.

24:15.600 --> 24:18.880
The links below, along with links to my Twitter and Curious Cat accounts

24:18.880 --> 24:21.680
if you feel like giving me a follow or sending in a question.

24:21.680 --> 24:24.640
Thanks a lot to all my current supporters, as always.

24:24.640 --> 24:28.320
I do have videos coming up that are actually about things.

24:28.320 --> 24:29.520
Don't worry, folks.

24:29.520 --> 24:31.520
Okay, that's it from me today.

24:31.520 --> 24:32.020
Bye.
