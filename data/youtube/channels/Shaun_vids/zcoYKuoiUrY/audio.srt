00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,260
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:08,180
This is a video about the Unite the Right rally that took place on August 12th of last year in Charlottesville, Virginia.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,520
Many of you will be familiar with the general events of the day.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,440
It was a rally attended by far-right figures such as Richard Spencer and David Duke,

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:24,140
organized to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee from a park in Charlottesville.

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:30,640
Shortly before the event was scheduled to begin amid violent clashes between Unite the Right attendees and protesters,

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,320
the rally was declared an unlawful assembly and police began clearing the park.

8
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:43,740
Soon afterwards, a white supremacist drove his car into a group of counter-protesters, injuring several people, one fatally.

9
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,580
He was later arrested and charged with second-degree murder.

10
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,340
Now, this fatal attack was obviously the main news story that came out of the event,

11
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,140
but also noteworthy were President Trump's later comments to reporters about the rally.

12
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,540
Firstly, condemning hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides,

13
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,300
and then later saying that there were in attendance at the rally very fine people on both sides,

14
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,020
comments for which he was widely condemned.

15
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,300
So that's the Unite the Right rally in a nutshell there.

16
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,900
So what is the purpose of my video?

17
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:23,820
Well, primarily, it's to examine some of the alt-right responses to Charlottesville which emerged in the months after the rally was held.

18
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,340
For example, if you search for Unite the Right on YouTube,

19
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:35,420
well, the first result is a Vice News video featuring scenes from the rally alongside interviews with organizers and speakers at the event,

20
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,820
including speaker Christopher Cantwell.

21
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,260
["We were asking whether white people were capable of violence."

22
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,100
["I didn't say capable. Of course we're capable. I'm carrying a pistol. I go to the gym all the time."

23
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,220
["I'm trying to make myself more capable of violence."

24
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:54,620
And true to his word, Cantwell was later arrested for pepper-spraying anti-fascist protesters at the rally,

25
00:01:54,620 --> 00:02:00,700
his tearful video explaining the situation earned him the moniker The Crying Nazi.

26
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,500
So, that's interesting, isn't it, to start with?

27
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,740
One of the speakers at the rally was arrested for violence at the rally.

28
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,060
That's just something to remember for later.

29
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:15,100
Anyway, only a few videos below that one in the YouTube search results is this video.

30
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:21,420
The Truth About Charlottesville Unite the Right by James Allsup, with over 80,000 views.

31
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:27,180
Now, James Allsup is an alt-right YouTuber who was present at Unite the Right live-streaming it.

32
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,700
There he is there.

33
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,220
Now, this video was released very soon after the Unite the Right rally,

34
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,540
when obviously, what with the white nationalist terror attack that killed someone,

35
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,780
the mainstream opinion of the Unite the Right attendees was rather low.

36
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:45,660
And Allsup's video is one of many white nationalist attempts to put the brakes on that narrative,

37
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:51,900
so there's lots of deflection, attempts at recontextualization, and outright lies.

38
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,380
Don't take my word for it, though. We'll start looking at those in a little while.

39
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,940
But firstly, I'd like to ask a question.

40
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:05,260
James Allsup live-streamed the Unite the Right rally, and he uses clips from his live-stream in his video.

41
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,740
But he has since taken that stream down.

42
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,460
Likewise, other alt-right figures such as Baked Alaska were present at the rally,

43
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:18,380
and Baked Alaska also live-streamed the event, and has also since taken his stream down.

44
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,620
So why did they do this?

45
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,780
Surely if James Allsup wanted us to see the truth about Charlottesville,

46
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,900
he could have left his unedited stream up on YouTube.

47
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,540
You can't get more truthful than a direct video of the event, after all.

48
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,140
So my question is, what are they trying to hide?

49
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:41,500
Luckily, there were plenty of willing cameramen at the rally who have not deleted their live-streams.

50
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,780
There are dozens of hours of footage from Charlottesville from a variety of different sources online,

51
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,980
and using those, we can show exactly what happened pretty much throughout the entire day.

52
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:57,580
Firstly, though, we'll briefly run through the events that led up to the Unite the Right rally.

53
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,100
So in early 2016, a Charlottesville high school student

54
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,900
started a petition to remove Confederate monuments from Charlottesville parks.

55
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:13,020
Vice mayor Wes Bellamy agreed, and held a press conference in which he urged the removal of the monuments.

56
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:17,340
For this, Bellamy drew the ire of white nationalist Jason Kessler,

57
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,460
the man who would later organize the Unite the Right rally,

58
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,900
who started a petition to get Bellamy removed from office.

59
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:29,740
Incidentally, in January of 2017, while out collecting signatures for said petition,

60
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,380
Jason Kessler assaulted someone.

61
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,220
I was just having a bad day. I've never done this kind of thing before.

62
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:41,420
Jason Kessler admits that he punched this man, James Taylor, in the face.

63
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:46,060
Man to man, you can expect to get punched if you yell in another man's face.

64
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:51,660
Kessler pled guilty in court and was sentenced to complete 50 hours of community service.

65
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,100
So that's the organizer of the free speech rally there,

66
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,940
a man who punches people who say things that he doesn't like.

67
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,700
Anyway, back to the timeline.

68
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:07,260
In early 2017, the city council voted to remove the statue of Robert E. Lee from Emancipation Park,

69
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:14,540
which kicked off a bit of an endless legal battle about whether or not the city can actually remove the statues or not.

70
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:21,020
More relevant for us, though, is that it drew harsh criticism from conservatives and far-right figures.

71
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:28,620
In April of 2017, Jason Kessler met white nationalist Richard Spencer at a protest in Washington, D.C.

72
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:35,900
Kessler and Spencer decided to hold a rally protesting the removal of Charlottesville's Confederate monuments to be held on May 13th.

73
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:42,140
Now, the May the 13th demonstration was a relatively small affair compared to the later Unite the Right rally.

74
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:46,860
Speeches were given in Jackson Park by the likes of Richard Spencer and Mike Enoch,

75
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,860
the host of the anti-semitic podcast The Daily Shoah.

76
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,820
Shoah being the Hebrew word for Holocaust there, so a lovely chap.

77
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:00,460
And later on May the 13th, the protesters moved to Lee Park with lit torches,

78
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,700
but this gathering quickly broke up and left the park after police turned up.

79
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:12,860
The next significant protest against the removal of the Confederate monuments was held on July the 8th by the Ku Klux Klan.

80
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,700
Yeah, those guys.

81
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:21,900
This rally was a rather messy affair that eventually saw police use tear gas to disperse the crowd of counter-protesters.

82
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:27,980
I won't go into the July the 8th KKK rally all too deeply, but I'll use it to introduce this report.

83
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,780
The independent review of the 2017 protest events in Charlottesville, Virginia,

84
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:37,100
compiled by the law firm Hunton & Williams and commissioned by the city.

85
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:42,460
This report is highly critical of the Charlottesville Police Department's handling of the KKK rally,

86
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:47,180
In a section titled What Went Wrong, the report contains subsections titled

87
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,540
Law enforcement failed to operate within a unified command.

88
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,900
Law enforcement allowed media inside the law enforcement zone.

89
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,300
The operational plan created insufficient space for opposing groups, and crucially,

90
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,900
the deployment of tear gas was unauthorized by command,

91
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:09,340
which says there was no unified plan or understanding as to who would authorize the use of tear gas on July the 8th.

92
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,780
In other words, the police were just rubbish.

93
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:20,300
This smaller KKK event serves as a preview for the mistakes the police would make on August 12th at the Unite the Right rally,

94
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,500
and this police incompetence drew major criticism from the alt-right after the event.

95
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,820
So we're going to go through the events of the entirety of the Unite the Right rally now,

96
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,460
while paying particular attention to the mistakes the police made throughout the day.

97
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,140
So late on August 11th, the day before the rally was scheduled,

98
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:42,220
a group of white nationalists marched through the University of Virginia's campus,

99
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,420
chanting Nazi slogans and throwing Nazi salutes.

100
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,420
This was an unscheduled event that was not announced beforehand,

101
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,260
so there were few counter-protesters and a delayed police response.

102
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:59,020
The marchers surrounded the few counter-protesters that were present and held abuse at them,

103
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,900
and several fights broke out, which the police broke up when they finally arrived.

104
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,020
And we'll come back and talk about the torch rally a little more later on,

105
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,660
but for now, let's move on to the main event.

106
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,620
And I suppose I should introduce our cameramen here.

107
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,780
For the first part of the day, I will be mainly showing footage from the livestream

108
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:21,340
organized by members of the alt-right's since-deleted Discord server.

109
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:27,900
This is from the video titled Unite the Right All Day Livestream, hosted on the channel TheBigKK.

110
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,900
This stream covers events prior to the police clearing the park.

111
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,620
After that, we'll be following Baked Alaska's crew,

112
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,740
whose streams started just prior to the park being cleared.

113
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,460
Now, Baked Alaska and James Allsup both deleted their streams, as I mentioned,

114
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:52,060
but this chap here, in the red shirt and the helmet with the Kekistan flag on the front,

115
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:56,460
his stream still exists, so we can follow that stream for the rest of the day.

116
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,340
Yeah, we'll be dipping into a few other sources as we go,

117
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,740
but those are our two main camera crews there,

118
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,060
the alt-right Discord channel and Baked Alaska and his entourage.

119
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,980
And I also have a few clips from James Allsup's deleted stream,

120
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,500
which were re-uploaded to YouTube by somebody else.

121
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,460
Now, that person has added their own subtitles and annotations over the video,

122
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,300
somewhat annoyingly, most of which I've blanked out.

123
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:28,380
So if you see a clip with a bit of the screen missing, that's James Allsup's deleted stream.

124
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,860
Starting off with the Discord crew, then.

125
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:36,140
They began the day in a car park in McIntyre Park, waiting to be bused to the event.

126
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:41,420
As they're milling about, we see several far-right figures in the assembled groups.

127
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:45,020
There's David Duke, the former Grand Wizard of the KKK.

128
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,660
Mike Enoch is there.

129
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,380
Richard Spencer is there with his crew, of course.

130
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,660
And they also take the time to interview Jason Kessler.

131
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,020
You can't stop the alt-right.

132
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,500
There's a warning to anybody across the country who tries to shut us down.

133
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,460
They're gonna fail.

134
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,540
This is gonna be the largest demonstration in the history of the alt-right so far,

135
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,620
and we'll only get bigger from here.

136
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,580
Get ready for kibetching on a massive, massive scale from the left-wing media,

137
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,620
but fuck them, you know?

138
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:19,740
They're already trying to run their narratives about us being violent or whatever.

139
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,820
Of course we're gonna defend ourselves.

140
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,420
Of course we're gonna defend ourselves.

141
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:28,220
But the media tries to portray it that we're the violent ones.

142
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,460
But you'll see today, of course...

143
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,860
I mean, given what happens in a few hours, he couldn't have been more wrong about that.

144
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,380
We also see Nathan D'Amigo, founder of the group Identity Europa,

145
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,820
seen here at an earlier protest, punching a woman in the face.

146
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,220
D'Amigo has also done time in prison for pulling a gun on a cab driver

147
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,660
and robbing him for, quote,

148
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,420
"...looking Iraqi."

149
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,220
Is anyone keeping score, by the way, for the organizers of this thing?

150
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:01,340
It'd probably be quicker to list the ones who haven't been arrested for assaulting someone.

151
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,140
Anyway, after the little meet-and-greet in the car park,

152
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,060
groups start heading over to Emancipation Park by van.

153
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:13,260
And it's here that the first big mistake the Charlottesville police made comes into play.

154
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,140
So we'll leave the rally attendees en route for the moment

155
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,940
and talk about the police action plan for the day.

156
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,260
So this plan went through several designs

157
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,780
before it arrived at the one that was circulated on August 7th,

158
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,540
a few days before the rally.

159
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,460
Now, there are a few problems with this plan,

160
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,420
the first of which will have been spotted already by any keen-eyed viewers out there.

161
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,420
They spelled the name of the rally wrong.

162
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,580
Unit the Right.

163
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:42,620
Anyway, on this map, the police deployment areas are designated by the zone arrows.

164
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,140
So they had five separate deployment areas total.

165
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,740
Although it's worth noting here that Virginia State Police were working with

166
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,260
an earlier version of the plan that had four deployment zones.

167
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,220
So the VSP commanders were confused when they turned up.

168
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,780
Off to a great start there.

169
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,700
So this plan sections off a quarter of the park for the Unit the Right rally,

170
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,060
and a quarter of the park is designated a public area.

171
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,220
So that's for the counter-protesters.

172
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,540
The police deployed to Zone 2 would be between the double barricade

173
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,380
keeping the two groups separate.

174
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,140
And the police deployed to Zone 5, the road to the south of the park,

175
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,340
would be there to break up fights and make arrests.

176
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:25,660
Great plan, on paper, spelling mistakes aside.

177
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,900
So how did we get from this plan to just one big mess of people

178
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,380
fighting in the streets of the south of the park?

179
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,500
Well, it's because of a couple of key last-minute changes

180
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,260
that were made by the police department.

181
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,980
So back to the Unit the Right attendees that are en route to the rally-by van.

182
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,700
When the police learned that the vans would be dropping people off to the west of the park,

183
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,260
they switched the designated areas for protesters and counter-protesters.

184
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,980
They did this less than 24 hours before the rally was scheduled to begin.

185
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,460
And quoting the Hunton and Williams report,

186
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:02,220
it appears that no efforts were made to communicate the zone designation

187
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,220
to counter-protest groups.

188
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,620
From later in the report, we can see the effect that this zone switching had.

189
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,380
At 9.42am, the first organized group of demonstrators

190
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,660
carrying the flag of identity Europa, remember them,

191
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,060
and led by Eli Mosley, entered the public area of Emancipation Park

192
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,900
through the southeast entrance.

193
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:26,700
Body camera footage shows Mosley walking over to the police officers stationed in Zone 2

194
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,140
and asking whether they were in the right section of the park.

195
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,860
Officers told Mosley that the designated Unit the Right area was in the opposite section.

196
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:39,500
Mosley called out to his group to form up and go around to the other side.

197
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,940
And this misunderstanding is something that was repeated throughout the day

198
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,740
with the various different alt-right groups.

199
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:50,380
So the arriving rally attendees are confused about where they're supposed to be.

200
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,940
And to change zones, they have to walk along the road to the south of the park.

201
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,540
But that's okay, right?

202
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,820
What about all the police officers stationed in Zone 5

203
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,020
to break up fights and keep the protesters apart?

204
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,300
Well, that's the other last-minute change that was made to this plan.

205
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,420
And I quote,

206
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,740
Captain Lewis told us it was her understanding

207
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,820
Zone 5 officers would be tasked with breaking up fights on Market Street.

208
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,500
But the parking lot backed up to the Wells Fargo building

209
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,140
where the Unified Command Center would be hosted.

210
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:24,860
VSP insisted that the entire area be protected by barricades.

211
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,060
CPD complied with the request and installed barricades

212
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,740
along the surface parking lot south of Emancipation Park.

213
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:36,380
This crucial change effectively stationed the officers in Zone 5 behind barricades,

214
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,940
much like the officers assigned to the other four zones.

215
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,780
As a result, no officers were assigned to open areas

216
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:46,140
in which protesters and counter-protesters would interact.

217
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,060
And indeed, the Hunt and Williams report,

218
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,980
written by people who had access to all the police body cam footage for the day,

219
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,060
notes only one instance of an officer leaving the barricaded zones

220
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,900
in order to break up a fight.

221
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:02,380
So the very poorly communicated last-minute changes to the police plan

222
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:06,300
ensured that basically nobody was aware of where they were supposed to be.

223
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:11,100
And the inability of the police to respond to the changing circumstances

224
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,620
saw them mostly just standing there watching it happen.

225
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,420
And I quote,

226
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,260
"...VSP directed its officers to remain behind barricades

227
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:24,620
rather than risk injury responding to conflicts between protesters and counter-protesters."

228
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,460
Yeah, that's your job, though.

229
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,220
You know... kinda.

230
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,020
Another genius moment from the Charlottesville Police Department is this one.

231
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:39,660
Mitchell told us he intentionally channeled entry to and exit from the interior of the park

232
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,260
through the staircases at its southeast and southwest corners.

233
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,700
He explained to us that such a design would force attendees

234
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,900
to walk around and enter at those controlled locations.

235
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,820
Through communications with Jason Kessler and his security personnel,

236
00:15:53,820 --> 00:16:00,540
CPD agreed to allow Unite the Right security members to act as doormen at the entry point

237
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:05,500
to ensure only demonstrators would enter the appropriate quadrant of the park.

238
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:10,220
So when you see the alt-right shield wall blocking off the entrance to the park,

239
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,140
that's by design.

240
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,300
That's part of the police plan.

241
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,500
They allowed the alt-right to police their own event.

242
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,820
And of course, this particular shield wall

243
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,940
is blocking off the entrance to the public area of the park

244
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,340
because they don't know where they're supposed to be.

245
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,220
So this big mess of people was inevitable, really.

246
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,980
And the police do deserve the lion's share of the blame here.

247
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,300
However, I'm not about to let the alt-right off the hook that easily.

248
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:41,100
They themselves repeatedly exacerbated the situation unnecessarily.

249
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,580
First off, once the Unite the Right attendees were actually inside their own rally,

250
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,980
they repeatedly ran groups back outside to fight with counter-protesters.

251
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,540
One live stream from just outside the barricades

252
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,820
captured one of these groups being organized and moved out.

253
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:12,380
And this is how the alt-right discord stream ends, actually.

254
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,540
They then form up into one of these groups and run out of the park.

255
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,340
The other big criticism of the alt-right I have here

256
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,860
is the unnecessary presence of the speakers and, quote,

257
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,820
VIPs outside the rally.

258
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,420
Because the police actually did do one thing right on the day.

259
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,140
They organized an unmarked police escort

260
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,460
to move the noteworthy alt-right figures and rally speakers to the park.

261
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,980
The plan was to bring the VIPs into the park around the back,

262
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,220
safely under police protection.

263
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,260
So it's kind of confusing to then hear Richard Spencer

264
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,460
complain about being attacked on his way into the park.

265
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,020
Okay, so here's another point that's got to be made.

266
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,700
The communists were doing all the attacking from the outside.

267
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,740
They were throwing bricks.

268
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,380
I got assaulted by Antifa as I was entering.

269
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,420
Oh, I did too, we all did.

270
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,860
Other people were sprayed with pepper spray or mayonnaise.

271
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,900
I don't know which one it was.

272
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,500
It was absolutely terrible.

273
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,540
And we elsewhere see James also complain about

274
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,180
Baked Alaska being attacked on his way into the park.

275
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,740
Where the police were on what I believe was the south side of the park.

276
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,140
They formed a line on the south side of the park

277
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,820
where there were no counter demonstrators or no protesters.

278
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,100
And they left the north end of the park where people were funneling into.

279
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,660
Myself, Baked Alaska, and others completely unguarded and unprotected.

280
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,580
We were essentially, you know, thrown to the wolves and were actually forced,

281
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,020
and I'll show this video here too,

282
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:44,940
forced to break through the line of anti-unite the right demonstrators.

283
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,620
So how was this possible?

284
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,180
What happened to that police escort?

285
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,060
And I quote,

286
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,860
Just after 9am, Sergeant Tony Newberry,

287
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,100
the detective who had been in touch with Unite the Right security organizer Jack Pierce

288
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,820
about getting speakers and VIPs into the park,

289
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,900
was driving around the downtown area with his partner in an unmarked van.

290
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,500
Pierce had refused to share where the speakers would be gathering that day

291
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,180
to assemble for the convoy,

292
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,780
but Newberry knew by now that they were at McIntyre Park.

293
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,180
As the morning went on and groups began to gather,

294
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:19,100
Newberry was anxious to get the speakers and VIPs into the park.

295
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,460
Newberry called Pierce's cell phone and told him,

296
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,340
There's never going to be a better time than right now.

297
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,820
Pierce said he understood and responded he would get everyone together and call Newberry back.

298
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,820
A few minutes later,

299
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,500
Pierce called back and told Newberry that the speakers had changed their minds

300
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:40,220
about coming in separately because they wanted to walk in with their audiences.

301
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,500
There will be no police escort from McIntyre Park.

302
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,100
Newberry told us he had a hunch that Pierce had been tricked into working with him

303
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,100
and that the rally organizers had never planned to be brought in the back of the park.

304
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,020
After the call ended,

305
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:57,980
Newberry turned to his partner in the van and told him they do not plan on this going well.

306
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:02,380
So you can't really blame the police for anything that happened to the speakers and VIPs

307
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:06,300
entering the event as they turned down available police protection.

308
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,580
And I'd like to say a few more things about James Allsup

309
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,060
and Baked Alaska's entrance to the park here.

310
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,900
Allsup himself lets us know the time that they arrived.

311
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,500
However, from the timeline of events,

312
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:35,420
we can see that the unlawful assembly was called half an hour earlier at 11.31.

313
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,380
Which means Baked Alaska, James Allsup and crew,

314
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,380
when they forced their way through the line of counter protesters to get into the park,

315
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,100
were pushing their way into an unlawful assembly.

316
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,820
So when James Allsup says,

317
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,660
Right, they were trying to inhibit our movement,

318
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,500
they were forming blockades to block us from, from entering the event,

319
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,540
that's unlawful detention, that's a form of violence.

320
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,100
Sorry James, but that just isn't true.

321
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,060
The rally was an unlawful assembly by that point.

322
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:06,060
You were also forcing your way into the wrong area of the park,

323
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,780
the designated counter protester area.

324
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,980
But of course we can't really blame you for that misunderstanding,

325
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,020
that one is mainly on the police for changing the zones.

326
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,420
I almost feel bad for the Unite the Right VIPs here.

327
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:23,340
They traveled all the way there, they turned down the police escort,

328
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,820
and then they hear that the event's being called off.

329
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,180
So they have to book it down to the park as fast as possible,

330
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,500
and force their way in so they can film themselves getting thrown out.

331
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,620
To justify the trip, I guess.

332
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,700
Or a sad little display.

333
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,940
Anyway, let's get back to our timeline, with the police now clearing the park.

334
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,780
And this leads us to yet another big mistake made by the police.

335
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:51,900
They put no thought into how the crowds would disperse after the rally was over.

336
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,180
As the crowd dispersed, law enforcement failed to prevent

337
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,380
and respond to violent confrontations in and around the park.

338
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,140
Those in the park at the time of the unlawful assembly were pushed straight south,

339
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,460
into the area on Market Street where counter protesters had assembled.

340
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,100
Predictably, violent confrontations occurred

341
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:13,020
as the Unite the Right protesters streamed past the counter protesters.

342
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,460
Rather than separate the crowds and break up individual fights,

343
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,340
troopers stood behind barricades as people left the park.

344
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,180
The CPD officers who could have de-escalated confrontations

345
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:28,540
stood in the back of Emancipation Park, acting as a rear guard for the VSP field force.

346
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:34,540
This thoughtless attitude towards the aftermath of clearing the park had fatal consequences.

347
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,860
And I quote from later in the report,

348
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:40,780
"...Officer Tammy Shifflett was in a vulnerable position at her assigned post

349
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,380
at the intersection of 4th Street Northeast and Market Street.

350
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:47,340
Although she is a sworn police officer and carries a firearm,

351
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:51,820
Officer Shifflett is a school resource officer who works in an elementary school,

352
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,500
and she had just returned to active duty following more than two months of leave

353
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,980
while recovering from elbow surgery.

354
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,140
In the face of the Market Street skirmishes

355
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,100
that broke out after the unlawful assembly declaration,

356
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,540
Officer Shifflett felt unsafe and radioed for assistance.

357
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,300
She was soon reassigned and she moved her vehicle away from that intersection.

358
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,380
After Officer Shifflett departed,

359
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:16,620
all that remained at the crucial intersection was a wooden saw horse barricade.

360
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,180
Lieutenant Steve Nick, the traffic supervisor,

361
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,300
was not aware Officer Shifflett had been reassigned.

362
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,220
No one in the command center fought to replace Officer Shifflett with other officers

363
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,780
or install any additional barricades.

364
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,900
And this, of course, was the street where James Alex Fields

365
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,500
was then able to drive his car into the group of counter protesters,

366
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,300
an attack that was made possible by the poor planning

367
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,140
and lack of communication within the Charlottesville Police Department.

368
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,260
We'll talk more about James Alex Fields later on.

369
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,580
For now, let's rejoin Baked Alaska and crew

370
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:52,540
who are in the large group of rally attendees making their way back to McIntyre Park.

371
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:57,260
At some point, Baked Alaska's stream crosses paths with David Dukes

372
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,740
and Baked Alaska tells him that he loves him.

373
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:15,740
At another point, someone convinces Baked Alaska to spray soap in his own eyes.

374
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,740
Which is kind of funny.

375
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:43,820
So as this ridiculous procession moved down the road,

376
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,500
Richard Spencer arrived in a convoy of cars,

377
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:52,060
leading to a terribly pathetic outbreak of fanboyism from all present.

378
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,420
Oh, Spencer.

379
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:54,940
OK, we're doing it.

380
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,340
We're doing it.

381
00:24:59,340 --> 00:24:59,980
Hold on, hold on.

382
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,700
Watch out for the pole.

383
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,260
Call him and tell him I'm coming up there.

384
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,820
Tell Spencer I'm coming.

385
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:37,820
Richard Spencer and the MPI guys making a surprise appearance.

386
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:51,820
All right.

387
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,300
All right.

388
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,060
Wait, which lane?

389
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:54,620
Which lane?

390
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:58,860
James Allsup sprints up the road to try to hold traffic for Spencer's car

391
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,420
and gets completely shut down by some random guy.

392
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,420
Hey guys, guys, guys, guys.

393
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:03,900
Don't cross.

394
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,700
We need to get Richard.

395
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,260
Richard's in his car.

396
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:05,820
He needs to get out.

397
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,580
I don't give a fuck about Richard Spencer.

398
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,080
OK, well.

399
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,580
Allsup later talks to a friend about David Duke.

400
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,700
Did you see Dr. Duke?

401
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,180
I did.

402
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:13,740
Was he here?

403
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,020
David Duke was the Duke.

404
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,980
The Dukester himself.

405
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,500
I disavowed.

406
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,580
Yeah, of course, of course, of course disavowed.

407
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,100
Of course.

408
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,860
I'm seeing a lot of Murdoch Murdoch t-shirts.

409
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,940
I disavow, of course.

410
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,940
I love that particular backpedal there because it contrasts beautifully

411
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,820
with a section from his Unite the Right video.

412
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,460
Repeatedly stated my position on Nazism.

413
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:40,540
I don't, I'm not a Nazi, but no amount of disavowing.

414
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:45,340
And I've realized this after dealing with the media very hard for the last week or so.

415
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:50,300
No amount of disavowing is going to convince the leftists, oh, he's not a Nazi.

416
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:56,140
Now, James, the problem isn't with disavowing Nazis and racists not being good enough.

417
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,340
Because it is.

418
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,740
The problem is with you disavowing Nazis and racists.

419
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:07,180
Because when you disavow Nazis and racists, you're obviously lying.

420
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,940
You know, you don't get to frantically cheer for Richard Spencer

421
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,620
and get all excited when you hear David Duke is present and then go,

422
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,340
well, of course, I disavow.

423
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,900
You know, who do you think that's supposed to fool?

424
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:25,100
You're treating disavowing something like a get-out-of-jail-free card in Monopoly.

425
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,900
You could at least act like you mean it, you know?

426
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,820
Let's stick with James for a bit and move on and talk about the signs,

427
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,780
flags, and iconography present at the rally.

428
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,540
Being completely honest, there were a couple people there

429
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:43,340
with swastika flags or Hitler iconography or whatever.

430
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:49,820
And I was reviewing the live streams of the event that Baked Alaska did start.

431
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:53,340
And then Matt took over for and that I had.

432
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:58,300
And in all of our footage, I think I saw a combined three swastika flags.

433
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,820
Three swastika flags, okay.

434
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:05,340
And so let's say, you know, for every swastika flag there are 10 Nazis there in support.

435
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,020
Okay, so that puts you at 30 Nazis, right?

436
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:13,900
So James also apparently didn't personally see many swastika flags.

437
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,260
So that means that there weren't many neo-Nazis at the event.

438
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,780
Now I could go through the various videos and streams

439
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:24,380
and find all the instances of people waving swastika flags.

440
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,900
You know, there's obviously the one that Allsub includes in his video.

441
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,580
And here's another one.

442
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,540
And another one.

443
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,060
And another one.

444
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,660
And so on.

445
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,620
And here's a chap in a swastika t-shirt even.

446
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:41,340
However, that would be the wrong way to answer James Allsub's claim.

447
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:45,660
Because that would buy into the idea that the only way to spot a neo-Nazi

448
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,140
is to see them waving a swastika flag.

449
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:52,620
There were, after all, lots of other flags and symbols on display at the rally.

450
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,260
So let's take a look at a few of those.

451
00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:00,300
First up, this here is a black sun flag, also known as a sonnenrat.

452
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,340
This is a symbol often used by neo-Nazis

453
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,860
because it was once used by the precursors to the neo-Nazis.

454
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,540
The Nazis.

455
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:15,500
Here it is on the floor of the former General's Hall at Wühlsburg Castle in Germany.

456
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,860
I pronounced that wrong.

457
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:22,220
Which was operated by Heinrich Himmler's SS during the Second World War.

458
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:25,580
If you see someone waving a black sun flag at a rally,

459
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:30,780
they're basically waving a swastika flag, but they're trying to be clever about it.

460
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,100
Here it is on a bunch of shields.

461
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:37,340
And this guy seems to have mixed it in with a confederate flag, which is a bit odd.

462
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:42,860
And here's a variant of that flag in a photo with a group of odd fellows throwing Nazi salutes.

463
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:46,620
Now, the cheery guy in the center there is Matthew Heimbach,

464
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,580
who was one of the listed speakers at the rally.

465
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:55,580
Incidentally, Matthew Heimbach was arrested for domestic battery during the editing of this video.

466
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,460
Interesting little tidbit there.

467
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,980
And here's another black sun shield in the right of a photograph

468
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:07,820
alongside some shields bearing a logo of the white supremacist group Vanguard America.

469
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:11,260
Now, center in this photo is James Alex Fields,

470
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:15,820
the person who later drove his car into the crowd of counter-protesters.

471
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,500
Next up is this flag.

472
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:22,780
This is the flag of the United States National Socialist Movement.

473
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:26,060
And I hope I don't have to explain the origins of that name.

474
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,940
They put in quite a showing at Charlottesville.

475
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:34,220
They had a big banner and a bunch of flags and members in attendance wearing their t-shirts.

476
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:40,060
Now, this flag is actually a 2016 redesign of their former flag, which looked like this.

477
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:45,020
And I'm not sure we need an Enigma machine to decipher this Nazi code.

478
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:49,180
They swapped out the swastika for this rune, an Odal rune,

479
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:54,540
variants of which were used by two different SS divisions during the Second World War.

480
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,940
So if you see someone waving this flag,

481
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:01,420
they're again waving a swastika flag, but trying to be clever about it.

482
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:05,900
Coincidentally, one of these flags is in the footage James also shows

483
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,940
as he's saying he didn't spot many swastikas.

484
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:13,020
This is a banner advertising the website The Daily Stormer,

485
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:19,580
which is named for the former Nazi propaganda newspaper Der Sturmer, or The Stormer.

486
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:23,020
The Daily Stormer had quite a little following going at the rally,

487
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,260
but more on them in a moment.

488
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,980
So here to James Allsup, I would say this.

489
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:32,540
It doesn't matter how many swastika flags you personally happen to see at the rally.

490
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:37,260
The acceptable amount of swastika flags at the rally would be zero.

491
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,780
You can't get away with saying,

492
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:42,540
well, only some of us were Nazis, so how could you judge us as a group?

493
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,740
You know, the event was called Unite the Right.

494
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,500
If you're tolerant of any Nazis being there at all,

495
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,180
you're talking about uniting the Nazis with everyone else.

496
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:56,380
Secondly, swastikas aside, as we've just seen,

497
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,260
other Nazi imagery was everywhere.

498
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,180
It was impossible to miss.

499
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:06,380
So either James is so naive that he does not recognize the meaning of group names like

500
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,780
the National Socialist Movement,

501
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:13,500
and he thinks the swastika is the only permissible identifier of Nazi sympathies,

502
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,260
or he's attempting to twist the truth to mislead his audience.

503
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,940
Anyway, back to the symbols.

504
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:24,540
Besides the explicit Nazi flags, there was all the usual white supremacist stuff,

505
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:29,100
Crusader imagery, deus vult shields, iron crosses, and so on,

506
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:34,300
and more appropriation of Norse symbols and runes like this Falknot flag.

507
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,340
Of course, the Kekistan flag was out and about,

508
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,580
seen here on one of the streamer's helmets.

509
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:40,860
What a dork.

510
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:46,620
The Kekistan flag is not much more than a green recoloring of a Nazi flag.

511
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,780
Proponents, of course, claim it's all a joke,

512
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:53,020
but there comes a point when if neo-Nazis like your joke flag

513
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:58,060
and start waving your joke flag alongside their other completely not a joke flags,

514
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,340
maybe it's time to come up with a better joke.

515
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,900
There were also flags for various, quote,

516
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,460
Identitarian groups present at the rally,

517
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:09,500
such as the previously mentioned Identity Europa.

518
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:15,020
Leaders and members of Identity Europa, such as former leader Eli Mosley,

519
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,940
have praised Nazi Germany,

520
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:21,580
and have openly pushed for what they say is the Nazification of America.

521
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,900
Is anyone shocked by that at this point?

522
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:29,100
I mean, anyone watching this who has not already worked out what these people are

523
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,740
is probably never going to see what these people are.

524
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:36,140
Now, the strangest-seeming flag at the event was this one.

525
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:41,260
The flag of Rhodesia, or rather a flag of Rhodesia,

526
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:45,260
apartheid state Rhodesia, when it existed, of course,

527
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,700
which in this crowd kinda resolves that mystery, to be honest.

528
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:53,420
Here it is alongside the apartheid-era flag of South Africa

529
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,900
on a jacket worn by Dylann Roof,

530
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,140
a white supremacist who in 2015 murdered nine African Americans

531
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,820
in a mass shooting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina.

532
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:07,660
Dylann Roof is currently serving a life sentence in prison.

533
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:12,300
I mention Dylann Roof here because it's time to move on to the next section of my video.

534
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,700
It's time to hear these people speak.

535
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,780
And Dylann Roof comes up a few times in the footage I watched.

536
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:23,100
There's like, there's that line between edgy and advocating

537
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,660
bombing of the classroom for the fourth grade.

538
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,100
This is self-defense bombing.

539
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:32,380
We need to mass produce, we need to mass produce bowl cut wigs.

540
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:38,700
We really need to not, like, heroize, um...

541
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,260
Dylann Roof?

542
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,500
Yeah, we need to heroize.

543
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,500
The bowl cut mentioned there being a reference to Dylann Roof's haircut.

544
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:50,380
Incidentally, here's Christopher Cantwell over on gab.ai

545
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:55,340
sharing a photograph of himself with Dylann Roof's hair photoshopped on top,

546
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:58,300
fantasizing about shooting children.

547
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:04,780
Making jokes about Roof and his actions, calling him a hero even, is really telling.

548
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:09,260
These people really do support murdering black people, Jewish people,

549
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,980
various other minorities they don't like.

550
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:15,180
And again, don't take my word for it.

551
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,900
Let's listen to the rest of what they have to say.

552
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,700
And we'll start off by hearing a few of their chants.

553
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:27,260
Blood and toil! Blood and toil! Blood and toil!

554
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:33,260
Jews will not replace us! Jews will not replace us!

555
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:36,060
So two chants from the torch rally there.

556
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,660
Jews will not replace us.

557
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,940
Self-explanatory, that one, I should hope.

558
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,540
And blood and soil.

559
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:47,420
Now, blood and soil was a slogan popular in, if you can believe it,

560
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,700
surprise, surprise, Nazi Germany.

561
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,220
And sticking with that theme...

562
00:35:52,220 --> 00:36:01,580
Tomorrow belongs to us! Tomorrow belongs to us! Tomorrow belongs to us!

563
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,420
Tomorrow belongs to us.

564
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,980
Either an enormous coincidence or a reference to the song Tomorrow Belongs to Me

565
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:13,660
from the 1972 film Cabaret, which is sung by a member of the Hitler Youth.

566
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:17,500
As for the non-Nazi chants, few that they were,

567
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,500
well, they were pretty much as you'd expect.

568
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:28,220
Fuck you, faggots! Fuck you, faggots! Fuck you, faggots!

569
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:32,780
As for casual conversation, well, I listened through hours of it.

570
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:37,500
And I'm going to include a series of clips here demonstrating how the rally attendees

571
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,860
speak to each other, what they think is funny,

572
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:44,460
and what they think are acceptable opinions to express.

573
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,660
And I apologize for having to include all of this in the video,

574
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,940
but I do feel it is necessary, so here we go.

575
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,060
Ben Shekelman Goldberg said he really likes you.

576
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,140
Are you single?

577
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:56,940
No, sorry.

578
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,700
Ben Shekelman Goldberg.

579
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,580
Not one of them.

580
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,940
He's a good boy, boys.

581
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,460
Just like J-B-J-B-J-B-E-R-O.

582
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,940
Well, I'm just curious.

583
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,540
Jell-O, race traitor, no exceptions.

584
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,140
Oh, man.

585
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,380
The big KK, hold on.

586
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,660
Saying that you should have sex with the big black beautiful Negros.

587
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,060
That's disgusting.

588
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,660
Sorry, I'm not in the bestiality.

589
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,820
Base sub-Saharan.

590
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,540
We're talking about the non-white stormers.

591
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,660
Did you guys see the base abo in the flag jacket or whatever?

592
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,700
Wait, there's an abo here?

593
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,260
There's an abo.

594
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,140
Oh, what the fuck?

595
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,020
West melody is a nigger.

596
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:49,260
You know, I don't even give a shit if a little fucking soy boy bitch sees my face.

597
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:52,380
Look, my bosses hate niggers and Jews anyway, you fucking communists,

598
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,900
so why don't you go fucking hang yourself?

599
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,580
On this stream, you're definitely going to see some people get wrecked.

600
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,820
You're going to see some little Jewish kids being suplexed.

601
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,100
It's not going to be pretty.

602
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,700
We're building an oven and it just got 10 feet taller after yesterday.

603
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,580
The Nazis were basically pacifists compared to us.

604
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,220
We're back.

605
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,180
Me and Matt are back.

606
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,060
Hell yeah.

607
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,340
You will not replace us.

608
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,820
You and your cultural Marxist faggot bullshit.

609
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,020
You will not replace us.

610
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,740
They thought we wouldn't stand up.

611
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,540
Guess what?

612
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,540
We're standing up for our rights.

613
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,300
We're proud to be white.

614
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,140
We're proud to be white, brother.

615
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,340
Proud to be white.

616
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,460
We're proud to be white.

617
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,340
Hail victory.

618
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,060
Hell yeah.

619
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:40,620
Thank you.

620
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,260
Black lives matter.

621
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,620
Today, you'll remember that 40 Antifa stood against...

622
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:21,820
Oh, when 40 Antifa stood up with our Holocaust tattoos against the Nazis yet again.

623
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,180
Got some...

624
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:26,540
Oh God, got some big Nazi asses in my face.

625
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,100
Oh, my ass neck and my...

626
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,820
Oh, my spine and my spleen and scabula.

627
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,100
Oh, my hemorrhoids.

628
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,220
I got to take some zinc.

629
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:41,020
Oh, look at all these goyim with these nice haircuts.

630
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,540
Well, she's our journalist, I think.

631
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,700
We haven't seen any journalists here yet.

632
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,460
Some actual accredited people.

633
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,180
New York Times.

634
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:57,500
Oh, they're from the New York Times and the New York Daily News and all these red bagels.

635
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,500
Oh, no, I'm Jewish.

636
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,220
I'm not a Nazi.

637
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:00,780
I'm Jewish.

638
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,780
I just had a lipshoot asking if I was Jewish.

639
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,460
I was like, oh, oh, goodness.

640
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,820
She found me out.

641
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,700
Oh, shit.

642
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,620
Oh, God.

643
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,540
I hope the Nazis don't beat me up.

644
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,180
What are you doing?

645
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:13,980
Where are you, dude?

646
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,340
You're going to your fucking Proud Boy meetup?

647
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,140
That's another thing.

648
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,060
Fuck you, Gavin McInnes.

649
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,020
You're a faggot, too.

650
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,140
You and your fucking Proud Boys are all faggots.

651
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:24,640
All of them.

652
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,220
Where are you?

653
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,380
You're fucking nowhere.

654
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,340
You're going to be at a fucking rally in Boston next week.

655
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,620
You're fucking faggots.

656
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,820
You're fucking losers.

657
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,940
Your movement's done.

658
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,060
You have no movement.

659
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,420
This is the fucking movement.

660
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,900
Either get on board or get the fuck out of the way.

661
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,180
That ranty chap at the end there was Millennial Matt,

662
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:47,340
the person who commandeered Baked Alaska's live stream after he was maced

663
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:51,260
and wondered around saying a bunch of vile shit like what we just heard.

664
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,180
He's also probably the main reason

665
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:57,020
Baked Alaska chose to take his stream down after the event.

666
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:02,140
We saw him there being very mad at far-right media figure Gavin McInnes

667
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,980
for choosing to skip the event

668
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:08,540
because he didn't want to be associated with a bunch of outright Nazis.

669
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:12,780
So that's how the far-right talk about their own when they break ranks there.

670
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,380
We also heard a lot from the alt-right Discord stream.

671
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:21,500
They were the ones who had the cameraman who liked doing that one particular impression.

672
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,420
They're also the ones who made the joke,

673
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,020
the oven just got bigger,

674
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,940
which is a telling mix of their rhetoric with that of Donald Trump there.

675
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,580
And I'd like to contrast a couple of particular clips from their video.

676
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,780
So here's the first one.

677
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:47,500
So that's the typical deflection offered by far-right groups

678
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,100
when they're called Nazis, you know.

679
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,100
Nazis don't exist anymore.

680
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,980
They haven't existed since the 1930s.

681
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:58,140
It's a childish attempt at using semantics to dodge the charge,

682
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,900
it's very silly.

683
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:04,300
So that was them talking to anti-fascist demonstrators outside the rally.

684
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:08,540
And the clip I'd like to contrast that with is from later on inside the rally.

685
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:11,660
The alt-right Discord stream happened to catch a speech

686
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:15,660
being given in front of the Daily Stormer banner I showed earlier.

687
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,780
Do you remember that?

688
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:17,740
Let's take a listen.

689
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,460
Didn't hit my journey, people!

690
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,660
No!

691
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,460
Fuck this.

692
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:23,980
Yeah!

693
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,260
I love my people!

694
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,460
Yeah!

695
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:55,100
One more, one more.

696
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,140
I want everybody to take close attention

697
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:04,060
because this is the first preset of the true alt-right.

698
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:05,740
Remember it.

699
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:09,260
Gas the kites race!

700
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:13,260
Gas the kites race!

701
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,540
Yeah!

702
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,580
Who brought the ovens?

703
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,220
And that's how they talk inside the rally.

704
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:30,300
In front of a banner that says end Jewish control over America,

705
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,020
they chant,

706
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,460
Hitler did nothing wrong.

707
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,420
Gas the racial slurs.

708
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,500
Race war now.

709
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,260
And I'd like to note the complete lack of dissent in this clip.

710
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:43,900
Everybody present joins in and applauds.

711
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,060
People shout Sieg Heil.

712
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,980
They're all, to a man, completely on board with this happening.

713
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,460
Not one person attempts to break ranks.

714
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,060
And that's how it goes.

715
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:58,220
Outward facing, the rally attendees will talk about free speech,

716
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,340
say they're non-violent, they disavow Nazism,

717
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:04,300
they'll claim there aren't any more Nazis, even.

718
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,500
But inside, they're chanting Nazi slogans,

719
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,420
and wearing Nazi iconography,

720
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:12,700
and waving Nazi flags, praising Hitler,

721
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:17,420
talking about gassing Jewish people, throwing Hitler salutes and shouting Sieg Heil.

722
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:21,180
These people here are neo-Nazis.

723
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,820
I think we can all agree.

724
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:28,060
But does this mean that all the people at the rally were therefore neo-Nazis?

725
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:31,740
Opinions are divided, but the answer is yes.

726
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,180
Or, you know, is that fair?

727
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,300
I don't know.

728
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:40,300
In my opinion, if you're willing to walk under a Nazi flag with a bunch of Nazis

729
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,420
and make no effort to disagree with them or counter the things they say,

730
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,660
then you're a Nazi.

731
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:48,860
If I went to a Liverpool match wearing a Liverpool kit,

732
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:51,180
and stood singing You'll Never Walk Alone

733
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:54,860
with all the other Liverpool supporters under a big LFC banner,

734
00:44:54,860 --> 00:45:00,300
it would be reasonable to assume I was a supporter of Liverpool Football Club.

735
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:05,820
But oh no, I could say, you know, I'm not really a Liverpool supporter, in my mind.

736
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:09,580
I just really look like one, do all the same things they do.

737
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,100
You know, give me a break.

738
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,020
We know what these people are.

739
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:18,860
Anyone who wasn't a Nazi would have turned and left the first time they saw a swastika flag.

740
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:22,540
Still though, some people will insist it's all just a joke.

741
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:27,500
Such as this chap who got surrounded by counter protesters and stripped off his clothes,

742
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,260
saying he's not really a racist, he's just there for a bit of fun.

743
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:35,260
Now, I'd argue that this doesn't really matter, to be honest.

744
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:38,700
But for those who think it does, how do we tell the difference?

745
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,500
The difference between the, quote,

746
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:45,900
real racists and the ones supposedly just there for a bit of a laugh, that is.

747
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:51,100
Well, the only way to tell the difference for sure is in their reactions to events

748
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:55,580
like the murders committed by Dylann Roof and James Alex Fields.

749
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:59,740
Once the ideology goes beyond words and becomes action,

750
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:04,220
fatal action at that, you can no longer claim it's just a joke.

751
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,060
You are all in at that point.

752
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:12,220
And with that in mind, let's take a look at a few of the reactions to James Alex Fields' car attack.

753
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:17,740
First up is James Allsup's response to the terror attack from his Truth About Charlottesville video.

754
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:23,100
Oh, wait, no it isn't, because he doesn't mention it.

755
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:29,260
Beyond one passing reference to the car crash, a rather neutral phrasing for a murder there.

756
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,260
So that's Allsup's approach, you know, just pretend it didn't happen.

757
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:38,140
He elsewhere claims that all the violence came from the counter-protesters,

758
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:42,460
which I guess is an easy stance to take if you're able to tune out a terror attack

759
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,380
originating on your side.

760
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:47,580
You know, if we don't look at it, it didn't happen, I guess.

761
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:51,020
That's the media-savvy alt-right tactic there.

762
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:56,300
Now the other alt-right tactic is to defame the victim, Heather Heyer.

763
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:00,940
Jason Kessler, who early predicted the rally attendees would be non-violent,

764
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,220
tweeted out,

765
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:11,900
And he's sharing there a Daily Stormer article which says,

766
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:28,540
Christopher Cantwell was, of course, his usual charming self about the whole affair.

767
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:33,580
The fact that nobody on our side died, I'd go ahead and call that points for us.

768
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:40,300
The fact that none of our people killed anybody unjustly, I think, is a plus for us.

769
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:44,300
Matthew Heimbach also approached reporters to say,

770
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:53,740
So this is what happens when things escalate beyond speech and someone is murdered.

771
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:58,060
They don't disavow the murderer, they rally around them and defend.

772
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:01,740
And there was, of course, also a conspiracy theory

773
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:04,700
that Heather Heyer was not hit by the car at all

774
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:11,420
and instead, coincidentally, died of a heart attack nearby at around the same time.

775
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:15,100
Of course, this ignores both that her death was ruled a homicide

776
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,900
and that the medical examiner's office in Richmond, Virginia,

777
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:21,820
determined that Heyer's cause of death was blunt force trauma to the torso.

778
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:27,180
Regardless of the truth, however, the heart attack lie persisted.

779
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:33,020
In neo-Nazi circles, obviously, but also among those seemingly with Nazi sympathies.

780
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:23,020
That's white supremacist millennial woes there, talking to YouTube personality Sargon of Akkad,

781
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:28,540
who is, as usual, mindlessly repeating whatever rubbish he's overheard Nazis say.

782
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,900
Is that a random jab at Sargon from me there?

783
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:33,660
Well, a little bit.

784
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:36,380
But I do think there's an important point to be made here

785
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:41,580
about how easily white nationalist lies can spread among the lazy and uneducated.

786
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:47,260
I mention it here because James Field's trial is scheduled for later this year

787
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:51,180
and all the alt-right's lies and deformations will be brought out again.

788
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:55,820
They will lie about the nature of those present at the Charlottesville rally.

789
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,900
They will lie about James Fields.

790
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,700
They will lie about how Heather Heyer died.

791
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:04,700
And we need to be vigilant in checking and correcting those lies,

792
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:09,580
lest we end up as witless Nazi stooges just like Sargon of Akkad.

793
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:12,140
So that's about it for me today, folks.

794
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:14,700
But I'd like to wrap up with a final thought here.

795
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:17,820
James Allsup, in his Unite the Right video,

796
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:24,460
rather hilariously predicts that Charlottesville would be seen as a PR victory for the alt-right.

797
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:26,700
But where are we today?

798
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,860
Well, the alt-right are in disarray, I'm happy to say.

799
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:35,580
Richard Spencer recently posted a video calling off his college tour,

800
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:38,220
citing heavy resistance by anti-fascists

801
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:42,780
as the main reason why he's barely able to draw a double-digit crowd anymore.

802
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:46,860
He also acknowledges Charlottesville as the turning point in the movement,

803
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:51,340
and one can read between the lines and see what he wanted out of Unite the Right.

804
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:55,660
The far right would turn up, pretend to be peaceful, get attacked,

805
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:58,060
and then play it up and act the victim.

806
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:01,660
James Fields ruined that narrative for them, of course.

807
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:06,380
Alt-right figures found instead their Twitter and YouTube accounts being shut down,

808
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:09,340
their web hosting taking their websites offline,

809
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,740
their Discord servers being deleted,

810
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:13,980
and the size of the anti-fascist crowds

811
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:16,940
turning out to meet them at their rallies and speeches increasing.

812
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:20,860
Charlottesville exposed them for what they really are,

813
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:23,660
a group of cowardly Nazi thugs.

814
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:26,300
They overestimated their broader support,

815
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,140
they overplayed their hand,

816
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:28,860
and they lost.

817
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:32,860
However, this is a somewhat hollow victory,

818
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:37,820
in particular because it took someone being killed in order to turn the tide,

819
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:41,500
and also because we can be sure that the alt-right,

820
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:47,020
neo-Nazis, white nationalists, identitarians, whatever you want to call them,

821
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:50,220
they will lick their wounds and resurface.

822
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,460
They will try all this again.

823
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:56,380
So what we need to do is remember who these people are,

824
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:58,300
remember what they stand for,

825
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:01,420
and remember what they do when given a chance.

826
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:06,700
I titled this video the true alt-right because of that particular clip from earlier,

827
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:12,300
in which the speaker urges the crowd to remember the first precept of the true alt-right.

828
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:22,460
And this is exactly how we should remember these people, too.

829
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:25,100
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

830
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,580
Sorry about the delay getting this video out there.

831
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:30,620
It was a bit of a monster to make, as I'm sure you can imagine,

832
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:34,060
and I got rather sick right in the middle of editing it, which was just terrible.

833
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:40,060
If you feel sorry enough for me and you'd like to see more videos like this or the others on my channel,

834
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:43,260
you can head over to Patreon and send me a dollar or two.

835
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:48,780
And thank you again to all my supporters whose generosity makes it possible for me to keep doing this.

836
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:52,460
You can also follow me on Twitter or send me a question on Curious Cat.

837
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,300
I'll put those links below.

838
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,220
And as a note here at the end,

839
00:52:56,220 --> 00:53:01,260
I half expect this video to possibly be flagged down with a series of false reports.

840
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:04,780
There's obviously several points in it where you could clip someone out of context

841
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:08,700
saying something horrible and then report it to YouTube's algorithm.

842
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,980
And I'll take it as a point of pride if it does get flagged down, of course,

843
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:15,260
because it would be far-right chumps flagging their own hate speech.

844
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:18,700
Regardless, if it does get taken down,

845
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:21,900
feel free to mirror this video on whatever platform you like.

846
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:25,500
Mirroring flagged videos has proven to be an excellent counter

847
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,940
to the far-right tactic of false flagging criticism.

848
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:32,700
So if it does happen, you're more than welcome to re-host it.

849
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,140
Okay, thanks folks.

850
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:36,940
That's all from me today, and I'll see you next time.
