00:00.000 --> 00:01.260
Hello, everyone.

00:01.260 --> 00:08.180
This is a video about the Unite the Right rally that took place on August 12th of last year in Charlottesville, Virginia.

00:08.180 --> 00:11.520
Many of you will be familiar with the general events of the day.

00:11.520 --> 00:16.440
It was a rally attended by far-right figures such as Richard Spencer and David Duke,

00:16.440 --> 00:24.140
organized to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee from a park in Charlottesville.

00:24.340 --> 00:30.640
Shortly before the event was scheduled to begin amid violent clashes between Unite the Right attendees and protesters,

00:30.640 --> 00:35.320
the rally was declared an unlawful assembly and police began clearing the park.

00:35.740 --> 00:43.740
Soon afterwards, a white supremacist drove his car into a group of counter-protesters, injuring several people, one fatally.

00:43.740 --> 00:47.580
He was later arrested and charged with second-degree murder.

00:47.580 --> 00:52.340
Now, this fatal attack was obviously the main news story that came out of the event,

00:52.340 --> 00:57.140
but also noteworthy were President Trump's later comments to reporters about the rally.

00:57.140 --> 01:01.540
Firstly, condemning hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides,

01:01.540 --> 01:07.300
and then later saying that there were in attendance at the rally very fine people on both sides,

01:07.300 --> 01:10.020
comments for which he was widely condemned.

01:10.020 --> 01:13.300
So that's the Unite the Right rally in a nutshell there.

01:13.300 --> 01:15.900
So what is the purpose of my video?

01:15.980 --> 01:23.820
Well, primarily, it's to examine some of the alt-right responses to Charlottesville which emerged in the months after the rally was held.

01:23.820 --> 01:27.340
For example, if you search for Unite the Right on YouTube,

01:27.340 --> 01:35.420
well, the first result is a Vice News video featuring scenes from the rally alongside interviews with organizers and speakers at the event,

01:35.420 --> 01:37.820
including speaker Christopher Cantwell.

01:37.820 --> 01:41.260
["We were asking whether white people were capable of violence."

01:41.260 --> 01:45.100
["I didn't say capable. Of course we're capable. I'm carrying a pistol. I go to the gym all the time."

01:45.100 --> 01:48.220
["I'm trying to make myself more capable of violence."

01:48.220 --> 01:54.620
And true to his word, Cantwell was later arrested for pepper-spraying anti-fascist protesters at the rally,

01:54.620 --> 02:00.700
his tearful video explaining the situation earned him the moniker The Crying Nazi.

02:00.700 --> 02:03.500
So, that's interesting, isn't it, to start with?

02:03.500 --> 02:07.740
One of the speakers at the rally was arrested for violence at the rally.

02:07.740 --> 02:10.060
That's just something to remember for later.

02:10.060 --> 02:15.100
Anyway, only a few videos below that one in the YouTube search results is this video.

02:15.100 --> 02:21.420
The Truth About Charlottesville Unite the Right by James Allsup, with over 80,000 views.

02:21.420 --> 02:27.180
Now, James Allsup is an alt-right YouTuber who was present at Unite the Right live-streaming it.

02:27.180 --> 02:28.700
There he is there.

02:28.700 --> 02:32.220
Now, this video was released very soon after the Unite the Right rally,

02:32.220 --> 02:36.540
when obviously, what with the white nationalist terror attack that killed someone,

02:36.540 --> 02:40.780
the mainstream opinion of the Unite the Right attendees was rather low.

02:40.780 --> 02:45.660
And Allsup's video is one of many white nationalist attempts to put the brakes on that narrative,

02:45.660 --> 02:51.900
so there's lots of deflection, attempts at recontextualization, and outright lies.

02:51.900 --> 02:56.380
Don't take my word for it, though. We'll start looking at those in a little while.

02:56.380 --> 02:58.940
But firstly, I'd like to ask a question.

02:58.940 --> 03:05.260
James Allsup live-streamed the Unite the Right rally, and he uses clips from his live-stream in his video.

03:05.260 --> 03:07.740
But he has since taken that stream down.

03:07.740 --> 03:12.460
Likewise, other alt-right figures such as Baked Alaska were present at the rally,

03:12.460 --> 03:18.380
and Baked Alaska also live-streamed the event, and has also since taken his stream down.

03:18.380 --> 03:20.620
So why did they do this?

03:20.620 --> 03:24.780
Surely if James Allsup wanted us to see the truth about Charlottesville,

03:24.780 --> 03:27.900
he could have left his unedited stream up on YouTube.

03:27.900 --> 03:32.540
You can't get more truthful than a direct video of the event, after all.

03:32.540 --> 03:36.140
So my question is, what are they trying to hide?

03:36.140 --> 03:41.500
Luckily, there were plenty of willing cameramen at the rally who have not deleted their live-streams.

03:41.500 --> 03:46.780
There are dozens of hours of footage from Charlottesville from a variety of different sources online,

03:46.780 --> 03:51.980
and using those, we can show exactly what happened pretty much throughout the entire day.

03:51.980 --> 03:57.580
Firstly, though, we'll briefly run through the events that led up to the Unite the Right rally.

03:57.580 --> 04:01.100
So in early 2016, a Charlottesville high school student

04:01.100 --> 04:05.900
started a petition to remove Confederate monuments from Charlottesville parks.

04:05.900 --> 04:13.020
Vice mayor Wes Bellamy agreed, and held a press conference in which he urged the removal of the monuments.

04:13.020 --> 04:17.340
For this, Bellamy drew the ire of white nationalist Jason Kessler,

04:17.340 --> 04:20.460
the man who would later organize the Unite the Right rally,

04:20.460 --> 04:23.900
who started a petition to get Bellamy removed from office.

04:23.900 --> 04:29.740
Incidentally, in January of 2017, while out collecting signatures for said petition,

04:29.740 --> 04:32.380
Jason Kessler assaulted someone.

04:32.380 --> 04:36.220
I was just having a bad day. I've never done this kind of thing before.

04:36.220 --> 04:41.420
Jason Kessler admits that he punched this man, James Taylor, in the face.

04:41.420 --> 04:46.060
Man to man, you can expect to get punched if you yell in another man's face.

04:46.060 --> 04:51.660
Kessler pled guilty in court and was sentenced to complete 50 hours of community service.

04:51.660 --> 04:55.100
So that's the organizer of the free speech rally there,

04:55.100 --> 04:58.940
a man who punches people who say things that he doesn't like.

04:58.940 --> 05:00.700
Anyway, back to the timeline.

05:00.700 --> 05:07.260
In early 2017, the city council voted to remove the statue of Robert E. Lee from Emancipation Park,

05:07.260 --> 05:14.540
which kicked off a bit of an endless legal battle about whether or not the city can actually remove the statues or not.

05:14.540 --> 05:21.020
More relevant for us, though, is that it drew harsh criticism from conservatives and far-right figures.

05:21.020 --> 05:28.620
In April of 2017, Jason Kessler met white nationalist Richard Spencer at a protest in Washington, D.C.

05:28.620 --> 05:35.900
Kessler and Spencer decided to hold a rally protesting the removal of Charlottesville's Confederate monuments to be held on May 13th.

05:35.900 --> 05:42.140
Now, the May the 13th demonstration was a relatively small affair compared to the later Unite the Right rally.

05:42.140 --> 05:46.860
Speeches were given in Jackson Park by the likes of Richard Spencer and Mike Enoch,

05:46.860 --> 05:50.860
the host of the anti-semitic podcast The Daily Shoah.

05:50.860 --> 05:55.820
Shoah being the Hebrew word for Holocaust there, so a lovely chap.

05:55.820 --> 06:00.460
And later on May the 13th, the protesters moved to Lee Park with lit torches,

06:00.460 --> 06:04.700
but this gathering quickly broke up and left the park after police turned up.

06:04.700 --> 06:12.860
The next significant protest against the removal of the Confederate monuments was held on July the 8th by the Ku Klux Klan.

06:12.860 --> 06:14.700
Yeah, those guys.

06:14.700 --> 06:21.900
This rally was a rather messy affair that eventually saw police use tear gas to disperse the crowd of counter-protesters.

06:21.900 --> 06:27.980
I won't go into the July the 8th KKK rally all too deeply, but I'll use it to introduce this report.

06:27.980 --> 06:32.780
The independent review of the 2017 protest events in Charlottesville, Virginia,

06:32.780 --> 06:37.100
compiled by the law firm Hunton & Williams and commissioned by the city.

06:37.100 --> 06:42.460
This report is highly critical of the Charlottesville Police Department's handling of the KKK rally,

06:42.460 --> 06:47.180
In a section titled What Went Wrong, the report contains subsections titled

06:47.180 --> 06:50.540
Law enforcement failed to operate within a unified command.

06:50.540 --> 06:53.900
Law enforcement allowed media inside the law enforcement zone.

06:53.900 --> 06:58.300
The operational plan created insufficient space for opposing groups, and crucially,

06:58.300 --> 07:01.900
the deployment of tear gas was unauthorized by command,

07:01.900 --> 07:09.340
which says there was no unified plan or understanding as to who would authorize the use of tear gas on July the 8th.

07:09.420 --> 07:12.780
In other words, the police were just rubbish.

07:12.780 --> 07:20.300
This smaller KKK event serves as a preview for the mistakes the police would make on August 12th at the Unite the Right rally,

07:20.300 --> 07:25.500
and this police incompetence drew major criticism from the alt-right after the event.

07:25.500 --> 07:29.820
So we're going to go through the events of the entirety of the Unite the Right rally now,

07:29.820 --> 07:34.460
while paying particular attention to the mistakes the police made throughout the day.

07:34.460 --> 07:38.140
So late on August 11th, the day before the rally was scheduled,

07:38.140 --> 07:42.220
a group of white nationalists marched through the University of Virginia's campus,

07:42.220 --> 07:45.420
chanting Nazi slogans and throwing Nazi salutes.

07:46.220 --> 07:49.420
This was an unscheduled event that was not announced beforehand,

07:49.420 --> 07:53.260
so there were few counter-protesters and a delayed police response.

07:53.900 --> 07:59.020
The marchers surrounded the few counter-protesters that were present and held abuse at them,

07:59.020 --> 08:03.900
and several fights broke out, which the police broke up when they finally arrived.

08:03.900 --> 08:07.020
And we'll come back and talk about the torch rally a little more later on,

08:07.020 --> 08:09.660
but for now, let's move on to the main event.

08:09.660 --> 08:12.620
And I suppose I should introduce our cameramen here.

08:12.620 --> 08:16.780
For the first part of the day, I will be mainly showing footage from the livestream

08:16.780 --> 08:21.340
organized by members of the alt-right's since-deleted Discord server.

08:21.340 --> 08:27.900
This is from the video titled Unite the Right All Day Livestream, hosted on the channel TheBigKK.

08:27.900 --> 08:31.900
This stream covers events prior to the police clearing the park.

08:31.900 --> 08:34.620
After that, we'll be following Baked Alaska's crew,

08:34.620 --> 08:37.740
whose streams started just prior to the park being cleared.

08:41.820 --> 08:46.460
Now, Baked Alaska and James Allsup both deleted their streams, as I mentioned,

08:46.460 --> 08:52.060
but this chap here, in the red shirt and the helmet with the Kekistan flag on the front,

08:52.060 --> 08:56.460
his stream still exists, so we can follow that stream for the rest of the day.

08:56.460 --> 08:59.340
Yeah, we'll be dipping into a few other sources as we go,

08:59.340 --> 09:01.740
but those are our two main camera crews there,

09:01.740 --> 09:06.060
the alt-right Discord channel and Baked Alaska and his entourage.

09:06.060 --> 09:09.980
And I also have a few clips from James Allsup's deleted stream,

09:09.980 --> 09:13.500
which were re-uploaded to YouTube by somebody else.

09:13.500 --> 09:18.460
Now, that person has added their own subtitles and annotations over the video,

09:18.460 --> 09:22.300
somewhat annoyingly, most of which I've blanked out.

09:22.300 --> 09:28.380
So if you see a clip with a bit of the screen missing, that's James Allsup's deleted stream.

09:28.380 --> 09:30.860
Starting off with the Discord crew, then.

09:30.860 --> 09:36.140
They began the day in a car park in McIntyre Park, waiting to be bused to the event.

09:36.780 --> 09:41.420
As they're milling about, we see several far-right figures in the assembled groups.

09:41.420 --> 09:45.020
There's David Duke, the former Grand Wizard of the KKK.

09:45.980 --> 09:47.660
Mike Enoch is there.

09:47.660 --> 09:50.380
Richard Spencer is there with his crew, of course.

09:50.380 --> 09:53.660
And they also take the time to interview Jason Kessler.

09:53.660 --> 09:55.020
You can't stop the alt-right.

09:55.660 --> 09:59.500
There's a warning to anybody across the country who tries to shut us down.

09:59.500 --> 10:00.460
They're gonna fail.

10:00.460 --> 10:04.540
This is gonna be the largest demonstration in the history of the alt-right so far,

10:04.540 --> 10:06.620
and we'll only get bigger from here.

10:06.620 --> 10:11.580
Get ready for kibetching on a massive, massive scale from the left-wing media,

10:11.580 --> 10:12.620
but fuck them, you know?

10:13.580 --> 10:19.740
They're already trying to run their narratives about us being violent or whatever.

10:19.740 --> 10:21.820
Of course we're gonna defend ourselves.

10:21.820 --> 10:23.420
Of course we're gonna defend ourselves.

10:23.420 --> 10:28.220
But the media tries to portray it that we're the violent ones.

10:28.220 --> 10:30.460
But you'll see today, of course...

10:30.460 --> 10:34.860
I mean, given what happens in a few hours, he couldn't have been more wrong about that.

10:35.500 --> 10:40.380
We also see Nathan D'Amigo, founder of the group Identity Europa,

10:40.380 --> 10:43.820
seen here at an earlier protest, punching a woman in the face.

10:44.380 --> 10:48.220
D'Amigo has also done time in prison for pulling a gun on a cab driver

10:48.220 --> 10:49.660
and robbing him for, quote,

10:50.300 --> 10:51.420
"...looking Iraqi."

10:52.140 --> 10:56.220
Is anyone keeping score, by the way, for the organizers of this thing?

10:56.300 --> 11:01.340
It'd probably be quicker to list the ones who haven't been arrested for assaulting someone.

11:01.340 --> 11:04.140
Anyway, after the little meet-and-greet in the car park,

11:04.140 --> 11:08.060
groups start heading over to Emancipation Park by van.

11:08.060 --> 11:13.260
And it's here that the first big mistake the Charlottesville police made comes into play.

11:13.260 --> 11:16.140
So we'll leave the rally attendees en route for the moment

11:16.140 --> 11:18.940
and talk about the police action plan for the day.

11:18.940 --> 11:21.260
So this plan went through several designs

11:21.260 --> 11:24.780
before it arrived at the one that was circulated on August 7th,

11:24.780 --> 11:26.540
a few days before the rally.

11:26.540 --> 11:28.460
Now, there are a few problems with this plan,

11:29.100 --> 11:33.420
the first of which will have been spotted already by any keen-eyed viewers out there.

11:33.420 --> 11:35.420
They spelled the name of the rally wrong.

11:35.980 --> 11:37.580
Unit the Right.

11:37.580 --> 11:42.620
Anyway, on this map, the police deployment areas are designated by the zone arrows.

11:42.620 --> 11:46.140
So they had five separate deployment areas total.

11:46.140 --> 11:49.740
Although it's worth noting here that Virginia State Police were working with

11:49.740 --> 11:53.260
an earlier version of the plan that had four deployment zones.

11:53.260 --> 11:56.220
So the VSP commanders were confused when they turned up.

11:56.860 --> 11:58.780
Off to a great start there.

11:58.780 --> 12:02.700
So this plan sections off a quarter of the park for the Unit the Right rally,

12:02.700 --> 12:06.060
and a quarter of the park is designated a public area.

12:06.060 --> 12:08.220
So that's for the counter-protesters.

12:08.860 --> 12:12.540
The police deployed to Zone 2 would be between the double barricade

12:12.540 --> 12:14.380
keeping the two groups separate.

12:14.380 --> 12:18.140
And the police deployed to Zone 5, the road to the south of the park,

12:18.140 --> 12:21.340
would be there to break up fights and make arrests.

12:21.340 --> 12:25.660
Great plan, on paper, spelling mistakes aside.

12:25.660 --> 12:29.900
So how did we get from this plan to just one big mess of people

12:29.900 --> 12:32.380
fighting in the streets of the south of the park?

12:32.380 --> 12:35.500
Well, it's because of a couple of key last-minute changes

12:35.500 --> 12:37.260
that were made by the police department.

12:37.820 --> 12:41.980
So back to the Unit the Right attendees that are en route to the rally-by van.

12:42.540 --> 12:46.700
When the police learned that the vans would be dropping people off to the west of the park,

12:46.700 --> 12:51.260
they switched the designated areas for protesters and counter-protesters.

12:51.260 --> 12:55.980
They did this less than 24 hours before the rally was scheduled to begin.

12:55.980 --> 12:58.460
And quoting the Hunton and Williams report,

12:58.460 --> 13:02.220
it appears that no efforts were made to communicate the zone designation

13:02.220 --> 13:04.220
to counter-protest groups.

13:04.220 --> 13:08.620
From later in the report, we can see the effect that this zone switching had.

13:08.620 --> 13:12.380
At 9.42am, the first organized group of demonstrators

13:12.380 --> 13:15.660
carrying the flag of identity Europa, remember them,

13:15.660 --> 13:20.060
and led by Eli Mosley, entered the public area of Emancipation Park

13:20.060 --> 13:21.900
through the southeast entrance.

13:21.900 --> 13:26.700
Body camera footage shows Mosley walking over to the police officers stationed in Zone 2

13:26.700 --> 13:30.140
and asking whether they were in the right section of the park.

13:30.140 --> 13:34.860
Officers told Mosley that the designated Unit the Right area was in the opposite section.

13:35.420 --> 13:39.500
Mosley called out to his group to form up and go around to the other side.

13:39.500 --> 13:42.940
And this misunderstanding is something that was repeated throughout the day

13:42.940 --> 13:45.740
with the various different alt-right groups.

13:45.740 --> 13:50.380
So the arriving rally attendees are confused about where they're supposed to be.

13:50.380 --> 13:54.940
And to change zones, they have to walk along the road to the south of the park.

13:54.940 --> 13:56.540
But that's okay, right?

13:56.540 --> 13:59.820
What about all the police officers stationed in Zone 5

13:59.820 --> 14:03.020
to break up fights and keep the protesters apart?

14:03.020 --> 14:06.300
Well, that's the other last-minute change that was made to this plan.

14:06.300 --> 14:07.420
And I quote,

14:07.420 --> 14:09.740
Captain Lewis told us it was her understanding

14:09.740 --> 14:13.820
Zone 5 officers would be tasked with breaking up fights on Market Street.

14:14.380 --> 14:17.500
But the parking lot backed up to the Wells Fargo building

14:17.500 --> 14:20.140
where the Unified Command Center would be hosted.

14:20.140 --> 14:24.860
VSP insisted that the entire area be protected by barricades.

14:24.860 --> 14:28.060
CPD complied with the request and installed barricades

14:28.060 --> 14:31.740
along the surface parking lot south of Emancipation Park.

14:31.740 --> 14:36.380
This crucial change effectively stationed the officers in Zone 5 behind barricades,

14:36.380 --> 14:38.940
much like the officers assigned to the other four zones.

14:39.500 --> 14:42.780
As a result, no officers were assigned to open areas

14:42.780 --> 14:46.140
in which protesters and counter-protesters would interact.

14:46.140 --> 14:48.060
And indeed, the Hunt and Williams report,

14:48.060 --> 14:51.980
written by people who had access to all the police body cam footage for the day,

14:51.980 --> 14:56.060
notes only one instance of an officer leaving the barricaded zones

14:56.060 --> 14:57.900
in order to break up a fight.

14:57.900 --> 15:02.380
So the very poorly communicated last-minute changes to the police plan

15:02.380 --> 15:06.300
ensured that basically nobody was aware of where they were supposed to be.

15:06.860 --> 15:11.100
And the inability of the police to respond to the changing circumstances

15:11.100 --> 15:14.620
saw them mostly just standing there watching it happen.

15:14.620 --> 15:15.420
And I quote,

15:15.420 --> 15:19.260
"...VSP directed its officers to remain behind barricades

15:19.260 --> 15:24.620
rather than risk injury responding to conflicts between protesters and counter-protesters."

15:25.420 --> 15:28.460
Yeah, that's your job, though.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.220
You know... kinda.

15:31.100 --> 15:35.020
Another genius moment from the Charlottesville Police Department is this one.

15:35.020 --> 15:39.660
Mitchell told us he intentionally channeled entry to and exit from the interior of the park

15:39.660 --> 15:43.260
through the staircases at its southeast and southwest corners.

15:43.820 --> 15:46.700
He explained to us that such a design would force attendees

15:46.700 --> 15:49.900
to walk around and enter at those controlled locations.

15:49.900 --> 15:53.820
Through communications with Jason Kessler and his security personnel,

15:53.820 --> 16:00.540
CPD agreed to allow Unite the Right security members to act as doormen at the entry point

16:00.540 --> 16:05.500
to ensure only demonstrators would enter the appropriate quadrant of the park.

16:06.060 --> 16:10.220
So when you see the alt-right shield wall blocking off the entrance to the park,

16:10.860 --> 16:12.140
that's by design.

16:12.140 --> 16:14.300
That's part of the police plan.

16:14.300 --> 16:17.500
They allowed the alt-right to police their own event.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.820
And of course, this particular shield wall

16:19.820 --> 16:22.940
is blocking off the entrance to the public area of the park

16:22.940 --> 16:25.340
because they don't know where they're supposed to be.

16:25.340 --> 16:28.220
So this big mess of people was inevitable, really.

16:28.220 --> 16:31.980
And the police do deserve the lion's share of the blame here.

16:31.980 --> 16:36.300
However, I'm not about to let the alt-right off the hook that easily.

16:36.300 --> 16:41.100
They themselves repeatedly exacerbated the situation unnecessarily.

16:41.100 --> 16:45.580
First off, once the Unite the Right attendees were actually inside their own rally,

16:45.580 --> 16:49.980
they repeatedly ran groups back outside to fight with counter-protesters.

16:49.980 --> 16:52.540
One live stream from just outside the barricades

16:52.540 --> 16:55.820
captured one of these groups being organized and moved out.

16:55.820 --> 17:12.380
And this is how the alt-right discord stream ends, actually.

17:16.380 --> 17:20.540
They then form up into one of these groups and run out of the park.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.340
The other big criticism of the alt-right I have here

17:23.340 --> 17:26.860
is the unnecessary presence of the speakers and, quote,

17:26.860 --> 17:29.820
VIPs outside the rally.

17:29.820 --> 17:33.420
Because the police actually did do one thing right on the day.

17:33.420 --> 17:36.140
They organized an unmarked police escort

17:36.140 --> 17:40.460
to move the noteworthy alt-right figures and rally speakers to the park.

17:40.460 --> 17:43.980
The plan was to bring the VIPs into the park around the back,

17:43.980 --> 17:46.220
safely under police protection.

17:46.220 --> 17:49.260
So it's kind of confusing to then hear Richard Spencer

17:49.260 --> 17:52.460
complain about being attacked on his way into the park.

17:52.540 --> 17:55.020
Okay, so here's another point that's got to be made.

17:55.660 --> 17:58.700
The communists were doing all the attacking from the outside.

17:58.700 --> 17:59.740
They were throwing bricks.

17:59.740 --> 18:02.380
I got assaulted by Antifa as I was entering.

18:02.380 --> 18:03.420
Oh, I did too, we all did.

18:03.420 --> 18:06.860
Other people were sprayed with pepper spray or mayonnaise.

18:06.860 --> 18:07.900
I don't know which one it was.

18:07.900 --> 18:09.500
It was absolutely terrible.

18:10.060 --> 18:12.540
And we elsewhere see James also complain about

18:12.540 --> 18:15.180
Baked Alaska being attacked on his way into the park.

18:15.820 --> 18:19.740
Where the police were on what I believe was the south side of the park.

18:19.740 --> 18:22.140
They formed a line on the south side of the park

18:22.220 --> 18:25.820
where there were no counter demonstrators or no protesters.

18:25.820 --> 18:29.100
And they left the north end of the park where people were funneling into.

18:29.100 --> 18:33.660
Myself, Baked Alaska, and others completely unguarded and unprotected.

18:34.540 --> 18:37.580
We were essentially, you know, thrown to the wolves and were actually forced,

18:37.580 --> 18:39.020
and I'll show this video here too,

18:39.020 --> 18:44.940
forced to break through the line of anti-unite the right demonstrators.

18:44.940 --> 18:46.620
So how was this possible?

18:46.620 --> 18:49.180
What happened to that police escort?

18:49.180 --> 18:50.060
And I quote,

18:50.060 --> 18:52.860
Just after 9am, Sergeant Tony Newberry,

18:52.860 --> 18:57.100
the detective who had been in touch with Unite the Right security organizer Jack Pierce

18:57.100 --> 18:59.820
about getting speakers and VIPs into the park,

18:59.820 --> 19:03.900
was driving around the downtown area with his partner in an unmarked van.

19:03.900 --> 19:07.500
Pierce had refused to share where the speakers would be gathering that day

19:07.500 --> 19:09.180
to assemble for the convoy,

19:09.180 --> 19:12.780
but Newberry knew by now that they were at McIntyre Park.

19:12.780 --> 19:15.180
As the morning went on and groups began to gather,

19:15.180 --> 19:19.100
Newberry was anxious to get the speakers and VIPs into the park.

19:19.820 --> 19:22.460
Newberry called Pierce's cell phone and told him,

19:22.460 --> 19:25.340
There's never going to be a better time than right now.

19:25.340 --> 19:29.820
Pierce said he understood and responded he would get everyone together and call Newberry back.

19:30.460 --> 19:31.820
A few minutes later,

19:31.820 --> 19:35.500
Pierce called back and told Newberry that the speakers had changed their minds

19:35.500 --> 19:40.220
about coming in separately because they wanted to walk in with their audiences.

19:40.220 --> 19:43.500
There will be no police escort from McIntyre Park.

19:43.500 --> 19:47.100
Newberry told us he had a hunch that Pierce had been tricked into working with him

19:47.100 --> 19:51.100
and that the rally organizers had never planned to be brought in the back of the park.

19:51.660 --> 19:53.020
After the call ended,

19:53.020 --> 19:57.980
Newberry turned to his partner in the van and told him they do not plan on this going well.

19:57.980 --> 20:02.380
So you can't really blame the police for anything that happened to the speakers and VIPs

20:02.380 --> 20:06.300
entering the event as they turned down available police protection.

20:06.860 --> 20:09.580
And I'd like to say a few more things about James Allsup

20:09.580 --> 20:12.060
and Baked Alaska's entrance to the park here.

20:12.780 --> 20:15.900
Allsup himself lets us know the time that they arrived.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.500
However, from the timeline of events,

20:29.500 --> 20:35.420
we can see that the unlawful assembly was called half an hour earlier at 11.31.

20:35.420 --> 20:38.380
Which means Baked Alaska, James Allsup and crew,

20:38.380 --> 20:42.380
when they forced their way through the line of counter protesters to get into the park,

20:42.380 --> 20:45.100
were pushing their way into an unlawful assembly.

20:45.660 --> 20:47.820
So when James Allsup says,

20:47.820 --> 20:49.660
Right, they were trying to inhibit our movement,

20:49.660 --> 20:53.500
they were forming blockades to block us from, from entering the event,

20:53.500 --> 20:56.540
that's unlawful detention, that's a form of violence.

20:56.540 --> 20:59.100
Sorry James, but that just isn't true.

20:59.100 --> 21:02.060
The rally was an unlawful assembly by that point.

21:02.060 --> 21:06.060
You were also forcing your way into the wrong area of the park,

21:06.060 --> 21:08.780
the designated counter protester area.

21:08.780 --> 21:11.980
But of course we can't really blame you for that misunderstanding,

21:11.980 --> 21:15.020
that one is mainly on the police for changing the zones.

21:15.660 --> 21:19.420
I almost feel bad for the Unite the Right VIPs here.

21:19.420 --> 21:23.340
They traveled all the way there, they turned down the police escort,

21:23.340 --> 21:25.820
and then they hear that the event's being called off.

21:25.820 --> 21:29.180
So they have to book it down to the park as fast as possible,

21:29.180 --> 21:33.500
and force their way in so they can film themselves getting thrown out.

21:34.060 --> 21:36.620
To justify the trip, I guess.

21:36.620 --> 21:38.700
Or a sad little display.

21:38.700 --> 21:42.940
Anyway, let's get back to our timeline, with the police now clearing the park.

21:42.940 --> 21:46.780
And this leads us to yet another big mistake made by the police.

21:46.780 --> 21:51.900
They put no thought into how the crowds would disperse after the rally was over.

21:51.900 --> 21:55.180
As the crowd dispersed, law enforcement failed to prevent

21:55.180 --> 21:58.380
and respond to violent confrontations in and around the park.

21:58.380 --> 22:02.140
Those in the park at the time of the unlawful assembly were pushed straight south,

22:02.140 --> 22:06.460
into the area on Market Street where counter protesters had assembled.

22:06.460 --> 22:09.100
Predictably, violent confrontations occurred

22:09.100 --> 22:13.020
as the Unite the Right protesters streamed past the counter protesters.

22:13.020 --> 22:16.460
Rather than separate the crowds and break up individual fights,

22:16.460 --> 22:19.340
troopers stood behind barricades as people left the park.

22:19.900 --> 22:23.180
The CPD officers who could have de-escalated confrontations

22:23.180 --> 22:28.540
stood in the back of Emancipation Park, acting as a rear guard for the VSP field force.

22:28.540 --> 22:34.540
This thoughtless attitude towards the aftermath of clearing the park had fatal consequences.

22:34.540 --> 22:36.860
And I quote from later in the report,

22:36.860 --> 22:40.780
"...Officer Tammy Shifflett was in a vulnerable position at her assigned post

22:40.780 --> 22:44.380
at the intersection of 4th Street Northeast and Market Street.

22:44.380 --> 22:47.340
Although she is a sworn police officer and carries a firearm,

22:47.340 --> 22:51.820
Officer Shifflett is a school resource officer who works in an elementary school,

22:51.820 --> 22:55.500
and she had just returned to active duty following more than two months of leave

22:55.500 --> 22:57.980
while recovering from elbow surgery.

22:57.980 --> 23:00.140
In the face of the Market Street skirmishes

23:00.140 --> 23:03.100
that broke out after the unlawful assembly declaration,

23:03.100 --> 23:06.540
Officer Shifflett felt unsafe and radioed for assistance.

23:06.540 --> 23:10.300
She was soon reassigned and she moved her vehicle away from that intersection.

23:10.300 --> 23:12.380
After Officer Shifflett departed,

23:12.380 --> 23:16.620
all that remained at the crucial intersection was a wooden saw horse barricade.

23:16.620 --> 23:19.180
Lieutenant Steve Nick, the traffic supervisor,

23:19.180 --> 23:22.300
was not aware Officer Shifflett had been reassigned.

23:22.300 --> 23:26.220
No one in the command center fought to replace Officer Shifflett with other officers

23:26.220 --> 23:28.780
or install any additional barricades.

23:28.780 --> 23:31.900
And this, of course, was the street where James Alex Fields

23:31.900 --> 23:35.500
was then able to drive his car into the group of counter protesters,

23:35.500 --> 23:38.300
an attack that was made possible by the poor planning

23:38.300 --> 23:42.140
and lack of communication within the Charlottesville Police Department.

23:42.140 --> 23:45.260
We'll talk more about James Alex Fields later on.

23:45.260 --> 23:47.580
For now, let's rejoin Baked Alaska and crew

23:47.580 --> 23:52.540
who are in the large group of rally attendees making their way back to McIntyre Park.

23:52.540 --> 23:57.260
At some point, Baked Alaska's stream crosses paths with David Dukes

23:57.260 --> 23:59.740
and Baked Alaska tells him that he loves him.

24:11.340 --> 24:15.740
At another point, someone convinces Baked Alaska to spray soap in his own eyes.

24:16.700 --> 24:17.740
Which is kind of funny.

24:22.780 --> 24:43.820
So as this ridiculous procession moved down the road,

24:44.460 --> 24:47.500
Richard Spencer arrived in a convoy of cars,

24:47.500 --> 24:52.060
leading to a terribly pathetic outbreak of fanboyism from all present.

24:52.700 --> 24:53.420
Oh, Spencer.

24:54.220 --> 24:54.940
OK, we're doing it.

24:54.940 --> 24:55.340
We're doing it.

24:59.340 --> 24:59.980
Hold on, hold on.

24:59.980 --> 25:00.700
Watch out for the pole.

25:01.660 --> 25:03.260
Call him and tell him I'm coming up there.

25:04.060 --> 25:05.820
Tell Spencer I'm coming.

25:22.540 --> 25:37.820
Richard Spencer and the MPI guys making a surprise appearance.

25:51.260 --> 25:51.820
All right.

25:51.820 --> 25:52.300
All right.

25:52.860 --> 25:54.060
Wait, which lane?

25:54.060 --> 25:54.620
Which lane?

25:54.620 --> 25:58.860
James Allsup sprints up the road to try to hold traffic for Spencer's car

25:58.860 --> 26:01.420
and gets completely shut down by some random guy.

26:01.980 --> 26:03.420
Hey guys, guys, guys, guys.

26:03.420 --> 26:03.900
Don't cross.

26:03.900 --> 26:04.700
We need to get Richard.

26:04.700 --> 26:05.260
Richard's in his car.

26:05.260 --> 26:05.820
He needs to get out.

26:05.820 --> 26:07.580
I don't give a fuck about Richard Spencer.

26:07.580 --> 26:08.080
OK, well.

26:08.700 --> 26:11.580
Allsup later talks to a friend about David Duke.

26:11.580 --> 26:12.700
Did you see Dr. Duke?

26:12.700 --> 26:13.180
I did.

26:13.180 --> 26:13.740
Was he here?

26:13.740 --> 26:15.020
David Duke was the Duke.

26:15.020 --> 26:15.980
The Dukester himself.

26:16.700 --> 26:17.500
I disavowed.

26:19.740 --> 26:21.580
Yeah, of course, of course, of course disavowed.

26:22.540 --> 26:23.100
Of course.

26:23.100 --> 26:24.860
I'm seeing a lot of Murdoch Murdoch t-shirts.

26:24.860 --> 26:26.940
I disavow, of course.

26:26.940 --> 26:30.940
I love that particular backpedal there because it contrasts beautifully

26:30.940 --> 26:33.820
with a section from his Unite the Right video.

26:33.820 --> 26:36.460
Repeatedly stated my position on Nazism.

26:36.460 --> 26:40.540
I don't, I'm not a Nazi, but no amount of disavowing.

26:40.540 --> 26:45.340
And I've realized this after dealing with the media very hard for the last week or so.

26:45.340 --> 26:50.300
No amount of disavowing is going to convince the leftists, oh, he's not a Nazi.

26:50.300 --> 26:56.140
Now, James, the problem isn't with disavowing Nazis and racists not being good enough.

26:56.700 --> 26:57.340
Because it is.

26:58.140 --> 27:01.740
The problem is with you disavowing Nazis and racists.

27:01.740 --> 27:07.180
Because when you disavow Nazis and racists, you're obviously lying.

27:07.180 --> 27:10.940
You know, you don't get to frantically cheer for Richard Spencer

27:10.940 --> 27:14.620
and get all excited when you hear David Duke is present and then go,

27:15.340 --> 27:17.340
well, of course, I disavow.

27:17.340 --> 27:19.900
You know, who do you think that's supposed to fool?

27:19.900 --> 27:25.100
You're treating disavowing something like a get-out-of-jail-free card in Monopoly.

27:25.100 --> 27:27.900
You could at least act like you mean it, you know?

27:28.540 --> 27:31.820
Let's stick with James for a bit and move on and talk about the signs,

27:31.820 --> 27:34.780
flags, and iconography present at the rally.

27:35.420 --> 27:38.540
Being completely honest, there were a couple people there

27:38.540 --> 27:43.340
with swastika flags or Hitler iconography or whatever.

27:43.340 --> 27:49.820
And I was reviewing the live streams of the event that Baked Alaska did start.

27:49.820 --> 27:53.340
And then Matt took over for and that I had.

27:53.340 --> 27:58.300
And in all of our footage, I think I saw a combined three swastika flags.

27:58.300 --> 27:59.820
Three swastika flags, okay.

27:59.820 --> 28:05.340
And so let's say, you know, for every swastika flag there are 10 Nazis there in support.

28:06.220 --> 28:09.020
Okay, so that puts you at 30 Nazis, right?

28:09.020 --> 28:13.900
So James also apparently didn't personally see many swastika flags.

28:13.900 --> 28:17.260
So that means that there weren't many neo-Nazis at the event.

28:18.060 --> 28:20.780
Now I could go through the various videos and streams

28:20.780 --> 28:24.380
and find all the instances of people waving swastika flags.

28:24.380 --> 28:27.900
You know, there's obviously the one that Allsub includes in his video.

28:27.900 --> 28:29.580
And here's another one.

28:29.580 --> 28:30.540
And another one.

28:31.100 --> 28:32.060
And another one.

28:32.700 --> 28:33.660
And so on.

28:33.660 --> 28:36.620
And here's a chap in a swastika t-shirt even.

28:36.620 --> 28:41.340
However, that would be the wrong way to answer James Allsub's claim.

28:41.340 --> 28:45.660
Because that would buy into the idea that the only way to spot a neo-Nazi

28:45.660 --> 28:48.140
is to see them waving a swastika flag.

28:48.140 --> 28:52.620
There were, after all, lots of other flags and symbols on display at the rally.

28:52.620 --> 28:55.260
So let's take a look at a few of those.

28:55.260 --> 29:00.300
First up, this here is a black sun flag, also known as a sonnenrat.

29:00.940 --> 29:03.340
This is a symbol often used by neo-Nazis

29:03.340 --> 29:06.860
because it was once used by the precursors to the neo-Nazis.

29:07.740 --> 29:08.540
The Nazis.

29:09.420 --> 29:15.500
Here it is on the floor of the former General's Hall at Wühlsburg Castle in Germany.

29:15.740 --> 29:16.860
I pronounced that wrong.

29:17.500 --> 29:22.220
Which was operated by Heinrich Himmler's SS during the Second World War.

29:22.220 --> 29:25.580
If you see someone waving a black sun flag at a rally,

29:25.580 --> 29:30.780
they're basically waving a swastika flag, but they're trying to be clever about it.

29:30.780 --> 29:33.100
Here it is on a bunch of shields.

29:33.100 --> 29:37.340
And this guy seems to have mixed it in with a confederate flag, which is a bit odd.

29:37.340 --> 29:42.860
And here's a variant of that flag in a photo with a group of odd fellows throwing Nazi salutes.

29:42.860 --> 29:46.620
Now, the cheery guy in the center there is Matthew Heimbach,

29:46.620 --> 29:49.580
who was one of the listed speakers at the rally.

29:49.580 --> 29:55.580
Incidentally, Matthew Heimbach was arrested for domestic battery during the editing of this video.

29:56.140 --> 29:58.460
Interesting little tidbit there.

29:58.460 --> 30:01.980
And here's another black sun shield in the right of a photograph

30:01.980 --> 30:07.820
alongside some shields bearing a logo of the white supremacist group Vanguard America.

30:07.820 --> 30:11.260
Now, center in this photo is James Alex Fields,

30:11.260 --> 30:15.820
the person who later drove his car into the crowd of counter-protesters.

30:15.820 --> 30:17.500
Next up is this flag.

30:17.500 --> 30:22.780
This is the flag of the United States National Socialist Movement.

30:22.780 --> 30:26.060
And I hope I don't have to explain the origins of that name.

30:26.700 --> 30:28.940
They put in quite a showing at Charlottesville.

30:28.940 --> 30:34.220
They had a big banner and a bunch of flags and members in attendance wearing their t-shirts.

30:34.220 --> 30:40.060
Now, this flag is actually a 2016 redesign of their former flag, which looked like this.

30:40.620 --> 30:45.020
And I'm not sure we need an Enigma machine to decipher this Nazi code.

30:45.020 --> 30:49.180
They swapped out the swastika for this rune, an Odal rune,

30:49.180 --> 30:54.540
variants of which were used by two different SS divisions during the Second World War.

30:54.540 --> 30:56.940
So if you see someone waving this flag,

30:56.940 --> 31:01.420
they're again waving a swastika flag, but trying to be clever about it.

31:01.420 --> 31:05.900
Coincidentally, one of these flags is in the footage James also shows

31:05.900 --> 31:08.940
as he's saying he didn't spot many swastikas.

31:08.940 --> 31:13.020
This is a banner advertising the website The Daily Stormer,

31:13.020 --> 31:19.580
which is named for the former Nazi propaganda newspaper Der Sturmer, or The Stormer.

31:19.580 --> 31:23.020
The Daily Stormer had quite a little following going at the rally,

31:23.020 --> 31:25.260
but more on them in a moment.

31:25.260 --> 31:27.980
So here to James Allsup, I would say this.

31:27.980 --> 31:32.540
It doesn't matter how many swastika flags you personally happen to see at the rally.

31:32.540 --> 31:37.260
The acceptable amount of swastika flags at the rally would be zero.

31:37.260 --> 31:38.780
You can't get away with saying,

31:38.780 --> 31:42.540
well, only some of us were Nazis, so how could you judge us as a group?

31:43.100 --> 31:45.740
You know, the event was called Unite the Right.

31:46.300 --> 31:49.500
If you're tolerant of any Nazis being there at all,

31:49.500 --> 31:53.180
you're talking about uniting the Nazis with everyone else.

31:53.180 --> 31:56.380
Secondly, swastikas aside, as we've just seen,

31:56.380 --> 31:59.260
other Nazi imagery was everywhere.

31:59.260 --> 32:01.180
It was impossible to miss.

32:01.180 --> 32:06.380
So either James is so naive that he does not recognize the meaning of group names like

32:06.380 --> 32:08.780
the National Socialist Movement,

32:08.780 --> 32:13.500
and he thinks the swastika is the only permissible identifier of Nazi sympathies,

32:13.500 --> 32:17.260
or he's attempting to twist the truth to mislead his audience.

32:17.260 --> 32:18.940
Anyway, back to the symbols.

32:19.500 --> 32:24.540
Besides the explicit Nazi flags, there was all the usual white supremacist stuff,

32:24.540 --> 32:29.100
Crusader imagery, deus vult shields, iron crosses, and so on,

32:29.100 --> 32:34.300
and more appropriation of Norse symbols and runes like this Falknot flag.

32:34.300 --> 32:37.340
Of course, the Kekistan flag was out and about,

32:37.340 --> 32:39.580
seen here on one of the streamer's helmets.

32:40.220 --> 32:40.860
What a dork.

32:41.660 --> 32:46.620
The Kekistan flag is not much more than a green recoloring of a Nazi flag.

32:46.620 --> 32:48.780
Proponents, of course, claim it's all a joke,

32:48.780 --> 32:53.020
but there comes a point when if neo-Nazis like your joke flag

32:53.020 --> 32:58.060
and start waving your joke flag alongside their other completely not a joke flags,

32:58.780 --> 33:01.340
maybe it's time to come up with a better joke.

33:01.340 --> 33:03.900
There were also flags for various, quote,

33:03.900 --> 33:06.460
Identitarian groups present at the rally,

33:06.460 --> 33:09.500
such as the previously mentioned Identity Europa.

33:10.220 --> 33:15.020
Leaders and members of Identity Europa, such as former leader Eli Mosley,

33:15.020 --> 33:16.940
have praised Nazi Germany,

33:16.940 --> 33:21.580
and have openly pushed for what they say is the Nazification of America.

33:21.580 --> 33:23.900
Is anyone shocked by that at this point?

33:24.540 --> 33:29.100
I mean, anyone watching this who has not already worked out what these people are

33:29.100 --> 33:31.740
is probably never going to see what these people are.

33:32.300 --> 33:36.140
Now, the strangest-seeming flag at the event was this one.

33:36.140 --> 33:41.260
The flag of Rhodesia, or rather a flag of Rhodesia,

33:41.260 --> 33:45.260
apartheid state Rhodesia, when it existed, of course,

33:45.260 --> 33:48.700
which in this crowd kinda resolves that mystery, to be honest.

33:49.340 --> 33:53.420
Here it is alongside the apartheid-era flag of South Africa

33:53.420 --> 33:55.900
on a jacket worn by Dylann Roof,

33:55.900 --> 34:00.140
a white supremacist who in 2015 murdered nine African Americans

34:00.140 --> 34:03.820
in a mass shooting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina.

34:03.820 --> 34:07.660
Dylann Roof is currently serving a life sentence in prison.

34:07.660 --> 34:12.300
I mention Dylann Roof here because it's time to move on to the next section of my video.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.700
It's time to hear these people speak.

34:15.260 --> 34:18.780
And Dylann Roof comes up a few times in the footage I watched.

34:18.780 --> 34:23.100
There's like, there's that line between edgy and advocating

34:23.100 --> 34:25.660
bombing of the classroom for the fourth grade.

34:25.660 --> 34:27.100
This is self-defense bombing.

34:27.900 --> 34:32.380
We need to mass produce, we need to mass produce bowl cut wigs.

34:33.660 --> 34:38.700
We really need to not, like, heroize, um...

34:38.700 --> 34:39.260
Dylann Roof?

34:39.900 --> 34:41.500
Yeah, we need to heroize.

34:41.500 --> 34:45.500
The bowl cut mentioned there being a reference to Dylann Roof's haircut.

34:46.140 --> 34:50.380
Incidentally, here's Christopher Cantwell over on gab.ai

34:50.380 --> 34:55.340
sharing a photograph of himself with Dylann Roof's hair photoshopped on top,

34:55.340 --> 34:58.300
fantasizing about shooting children.

34:58.300 --> 35:04.780
Making jokes about Roof and his actions, calling him a hero even, is really telling.

35:04.780 --> 35:09.260
These people really do support murdering black people, Jewish people,

35:09.260 --> 35:11.980
various other minorities they don't like.

35:11.980 --> 35:15.180
And again, don't take my word for it.

35:15.180 --> 35:17.900
Let's listen to the rest of what they have to say.

35:17.900 --> 35:20.700
And we'll start off by hearing a few of their chants.

35:20.700 --> 35:27.260
Blood and toil! Blood and toil! Blood and toil!

35:27.260 --> 35:33.260
Jews will not replace us! Jews will not replace us!

35:33.260 --> 35:36.060
So two chants from the torch rally there.

35:36.060 --> 35:37.660
Jews will not replace us.

35:38.540 --> 35:40.940
Self-explanatory, that one, I should hope.

35:40.940 --> 35:42.540
And blood and soil.

35:42.540 --> 35:47.420
Now, blood and soil was a slogan popular in, if you can believe it,

35:47.420 --> 35:50.700
surprise, surprise, Nazi Germany.

35:50.700 --> 35:52.220
And sticking with that theme...

35:52.220 --> 36:01.580
Tomorrow belongs to us! Tomorrow belongs to us! Tomorrow belongs to us!

36:01.580 --> 36:03.420
Tomorrow belongs to us.

36:03.420 --> 36:07.980
Either an enormous coincidence or a reference to the song Tomorrow Belongs to Me

36:07.980 --> 36:13.660
from the 1972 film Cabaret, which is sung by a member of the Hitler Youth.

36:13.660 --> 36:17.500
As for the non-Nazi chants, few that they were,

36:17.500 --> 36:19.500
well, they were pretty much as you'd expect.

36:19.500 --> 36:28.220
Fuck you, faggots! Fuck you, faggots! Fuck you, faggots!

36:28.220 --> 36:32.780
As for casual conversation, well, I listened through hours of it.

36:32.780 --> 36:37.500
And I'm going to include a series of clips here demonstrating how the rally attendees

36:37.500 --> 36:40.860
speak to each other, what they think is funny,

36:40.860 --> 36:44.460
and what they think are acceptable opinions to express.

36:44.460 --> 36:47.660
And I apologize for having to include all of this in the video,

36:47.660 --> 36:50.940
but I do feel it is necessary, so here we go.

36:51.500 --> 36:54.060
Ben Shekelman Goldberg said he really likes you.

36:54.940 --> 36:56.140
Are you single?

36:56.140 --> 36:56.940
No, sorry.

36:59.420 --> 37:00.700
Ben Shekelman Goldberg.

37:02.460 --> 37:03.580
Not one of them.

37:07.260 --> 37:08.940
He's a good boy, boys.

37:08.940 --> 37:10.460
Just like J-B-J-B-J-B-E-R-O.

37:11.660 --> 37:12.940
Well, I'm just curious.

37:12.940 --> 37:14.540
Jell-O, race traitor, no exceptions.

37:15.660 --> 37:16.140
Oh, man.

37:17.260 --> 37:18.380
The big KK, hold on.

37:19.100 --> 37:21.660
Saying that you should have sex with the big black beautiful Negros.

37:21.660 --> 37:24.060
That's disgusting.

37:24.060 --> 37:25.660
Sorry, I'm not in the bestiality.

37:26.700 --> 37:27.820
Base sub-Saharan.

37:27.820 --> 37:30.540
We're talking about the non-white stormers.

37:32.380 --> 37:35.660
Did you guys see the base abo in the flag jacket or whatever?

37:35.660 --> 37:36.700
Wait, there's an abo here?

37:36.700 --> 37:37.260
There's an abo.

37:37.260 --> 37:38.140
Oh, what the fuck?

37:41.260 --> 37:43.020
West melody is a nigger.

37:45.420 --> 37:49.260
You know, I don't even give a shit if a little fucking soy boy bitch sees my face.

37:49.260 --> 37:52.380
Look, my bosses hate niggers and Jews anyway, you fucking communists,

37:52.380 --> 37:53.900
so why don't you go fucking hang yourself?

37:55.180 --> 37:57.580
On this stream, you're definitely going to see some people get wrecked.

37:59.340 --> 38:01.820
You're going to see some little Jewish kids being suplexed.

38:05.420 --> 38:07.100
It's not going to be pretty.

38:07.100 --> 38:10.700
We're building an oven and it just got 10 feet taller after yesterday.

38:10.860 --> 38:13.580
The Nazis were basically pacifists compared to us.

38:15.500 --> 38:16.220
We're back.

38:16.220 --> 38:17.180
Me and Matt are back.

38:19.180 --> 38:20.060
Hell yeah.

38:20.060 --> 38:21.340
You will not replace us.

38:22.380 --> 38:25.820
You and your cultural Marxist faggot bullshit.

38:25.820 --> 38:27.020
You will not replace us.

38:27.820 --> 38:29.740
They thought we wouldn't stand up.

38:29.740 --> 38:30.540
Guess what?

38:30.540 --> 38:32.540
We're standing up for our rights.

38:32.540 --> 38:34.300
We're proud to be white.

38:34.300 --> 38:36.140
We're proud to be white, brother.

38:36.140 --> 38:37.340
Proud to be white.

38:37.340 --> 38:38.460
We're proud to be white.

38:38.460 --> 38:39.340
Hail victory.

38:39.340 --> 38:40.060
Hell yeah.

38:40.060 --> 38:40.620
Thank you.

39:10.300 --> 39:11.260
Black lives matter.

39:11.260 --> 39:14.620
Today, you'll remember that 40 Antifa stood against...

39:14.620 --> 39:21.820
Oh, when 40 Antifa stood up with our Holocaust tattoos against the Nazis yet again.

39:22.700 --> 39:23.180
Got some...

39:23.180 --> 39:26.540
Oh God, got some big Nazi asses in my face.

39:26.540 --> 39:29.100
Oh, my ass neck and my...

39:29.100 --> 39:31.820
Oh, my spine and my spleen and scabula.

39:31.820 --> 39:33.100
Oh, my hemorrhoids.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.220
I got to take some zinc.

39:36.460 --> 39:41.020
Oh, look at all these goyim with these nice haircuts.

39:42.300 --> 39:44.540
Well, she's our journalist, I think.

39:44.540 --> 39:46.700
We haven't seen any journalists here yet.

39:46.700 --> 39:48.460
Some actual accredited people.

39:49.820 --> 39:51.180
New York Times.

39:51.180 --> 39:57.500
Oh, they're from the New York Times and the New York Daily News and all these red bagels.

39:57.500 --> 39:59.500
Oh, no, I'm Jewish.

39:59.500 --> 40:00.220
I'm not a Nazi.

40:00.220 --> 40:00.780
I'm Jewish.

40:02.300 --> 40:04.780
I just had a lipshoot asking if I was Jewish.

40:04.780 --> 40:06.460
I was like, oh, oh, goodness.

40:06.460 --> 40:07.820
She found me out.

40:07.820 --> 40:08.700
Oh, shit.

40:09.580 --> 40:10.620
Oh, God.

40:10.620 --> 40:12.540
I hope the Nazis don't beat me up.

40:12.540 --> 40:13.180
What are you doing?

40:13.180 --> 40:13.980
Where are you, dude?

40:15.180 --> 40:17.340
You're going to your fucking Proud Boy meetup?

40:17.340 --> 40:18.140
That's another thing.

40:18.140 --> 40:20.060
Fuck you, Gavin McInnes.

40:20.060 --> 40:21.020
You're a faggot, too.

40:22.140 --> 40:24.140
You and your fucking Proud Boys are all faggots.

40:24.140 --> 40:24.640
All of them.

40:25.740 --> 40:26.220
Where are you?

40:27.420 --> 40:28.380
You're fucking nowhere.

40:29.100 --> 40:31.340
You're going to be at a fucking rally in Boston next week.

40:31.340 --> 40:32.620
You're fucking faggots.

40:32.620 --> 40:33.820
You're fucking losers.

40:33.820 --> 40:34.940
Your movement's done.

40:34.940 --> 40:36.060
You have no movement.

40:36.060 --> 40:37.420
This is the fucking movement.

40:37.420 --> 40:39.900
Either get on board or get the fuck out of the way.

40:39.900 --> 40:43.180
That ranty chap at the end there was Millennial Matt,

40:43.180 --> 40:47.340
the person who commandeered Baked Alaska's live stream after he was maced

40:47.340 --> 40:51.260
and wondered around saying a bunch of vile shit like what we just heard.

40:51.260 --> 40:53.180
He's also probably the main reason

40:53.180 --> 40:57.020
Baked Alaska chose to take his stream down after the event.

40:57.020 --> 41:02.140
We saw him there being very mad at far-right media figure Gavin McInnes

41:02.140 --> 41:03.980
for choosing to skip the event

41:03.980 --> 41:08.540
because he didn't want to be associated with a bunch of outright Nazis.

41:08.540 --> 41:12.780
So that's how the far-right talk about their own when they break ranks there.

41:12.780 --> 41:16.380
We also heard a lot from the alt-right Discord stream.

41:16.380 --> 41:21.500
They were the ones who had the cameraman who liked doing that one particular impression.

41:21.500 --> 41:23.420
They're also the ones who made the joke,

41:23.420 --> 41:25.020
the oven just got bigger,

41:25.020 --> 41:28.940
which is a telling mix of their rhetoric with that of Donald Trump there.

41:29.500 --> 41:33.580
And I'd like to contrast a couple of particular clips from their video.

41:33.580 --> 41:34.780
So here's the first one.

41:34.780 --> 41:47.500
So that's the typical deflection offered by far-right groups

41:47.500 --> 41:49.100
when they're called Nazis, you know.

41:49.100 --> 41:51.100
Nazis don't exist anymore.

41:51.100 --> 41:53.980
They haven't existed since the 1930s.

41:53.980 --> 41:58.140
It's a childish attempt at using semantics to dodge the charge,

41:58.700 --> 41:59.900
it's very silly.

41:59.900 --> 42:04.300
So that was them talking to anti-fascist demonstrators outside the rally.

42:04.300 --> 42:08.540
And the clip I'd like to contrast that with is from later on inside the rally.

42:08.540 --> 42:11.660
The alt-right Discord stream happened to catch a speech

42:11.660 --> 42:15.660
being given in front of the Daily Stormer banner I showed earlier.

42:15.660 --> 42:16.780
Do you remember that?

42:16.780 --> 42:17.740
Let's take a listen.

42:18.460 --> 42:20.460
Didn't hit my journey, people!

42:20.460 --> 42:21.660
No!

42:21.660 --> 42:22.460
Fuck this.

42:23.500 --> 42:23.980
Yeah!

42:39.100 --> 42:41.260
I love my people!

42:41.260 --> 42:42.460
Yeah!

42:47.740 --> 42:55.100
One more, one more.

42:55.100 --> 42:58.140
I want everybody to take close attention

42:58.140 --> 43:04.060
because this is the first preset of the true alt-right.

43:04.940 --> 43:05.740
Remember it.

43:06.940 --> 43:09.260
Gas the kites race!

43:09.260 --> 43:13.260
Gas the kites race!

43:18.540 --> 43:20.540
Yeah!

43:20.540 --> 43:21.580
Who brought the ovens?

43:23.500 --> 43:26.220
And that's how they talk inside the rally.

43:26.220 --> 43:30.300
In front of a banner that says end Jewish control over America,

43:30.300 --> 43:31.020
they chant,

43:31.020 --> 43:32.460
Hitler did nothing wrong.

43:33.180 --> 43:35.420
Gas the racial slurs.

43:35.980 --> 43:37.500
Race war now.

43:37.500 --> 43:41.260
And I'd like to note the complete lack of dissent in this clip.

43:41.260 --> 43:43.900
Everybody present joins in and applauds.

43:43.900 --> 43:46.060
People shout Sieg Heil.

43:46.060 --> 43:49.980
They're all, to a man, completely on board with this happening.

43:49.980 --> 43:52.460
Not one person attempts to break ranks.

43:53.020 --> 43:54.060
And that's how it goes.

43:54.620 --> 43:58.220
Outward facing, the rally attendees will talk about free speech,

43:58.220 --> 44:01.340
say they're non-violent, they disavow Nazism,

44:01.340 --> 44:04.300
they'll claim there aren't any more Nazis, even.

44:04.300 --> 44:07.500
But inside, they're chanting Nazi slogans,

44:07.500 --> 44:09.420
and wearing Nazi iconography,

44:09.420 --> 44:12.700
and waving Nazi flags, praising Hitler,

44:12.700 --> 44:17.420
talking about gassing Jewish people, throwing Hitler salutes and shouting Sieg Heil.

44:17.980 --> 44:21.180
These people here are neo-Nazis.

44:22.060 --> 44:23.820
I think we can all agree.

44:23.820 --> 44:28.060
But does this mean that all the people at the rally were therefore neo-Nazis?

44:28.860 --> 44:31.740
Opinions are divided, but the answer is yes.

44:32.860 --> 44:35.180
Or, you know, is that fair?

44:35.180 --> 44:36.300
I don't know.

44:36.300 --> 44:40.300
In my opinion, if you're willing to walk under a Nazi flag with a bunch of Nazis

44:40.300 --> 44:43.420
and make no effort to disagree with them or counter the things they say,

44:44.060 --> 44:45.660
then you're a Nazi.

44:45.660 --> 44:48.860
If I went to a Liverpool match wearing a Liverpool kit,

44:48.860 --> 44:51.180
and stood singing You'll Never Walk Alone

44:51.180 --> 44:54.860
with all the other Liverpool supporters under a big LFC banner,

44:54.860 --> 45:00.300
it would be reasonable to assume I was a supporter of Liverpool Football Club.

45:00.300 --> 45:05.820
But oh no, I could say, you know, I'm not really a Liverpool supporter, in my mind.

45:05.820 --> 45:09.580
I just really look like one, do all the same things they do.

45:09.580 --> 45:11.100
You know, give me a break.

45:11.100 --> 45:13.020
We know what these people are.

45:13.020 --> 45:18.860
Anyone who wasn't a Nazi would have turned and left the first time they saw a swastika flag.

45:18.860 --> 45:22.540
Still though, some people will insist it's all just a joke.

45:22.540 --> 45:27.500
Such as this chap who got surrounded by counter protesters and stripped off his clothes,

45:27.500 --> 45:31.260
saying he's not really a racist, he's just there for a bit of fun.

45:31.260 --> 45:35.260
Now, I'd argue that this doesn't really matter, to be honest.

45:35.260 --> 45:38.700
But for those who think it does, how do we tell the difference?

45:39.580 --> 45:41.500
The difference between the, quote,

45:41.500 --> 45:45.900
real racists and the ones supposedly just there for a bit of a laugh, that is.

45:46.540 --> 45:51.100
Well, the only way to tell the difference for sure is in their reactions to events

45:51.100 --> 45:55.580
like the murders committed by Dylann Roof and James Alex Fields.

45:55.580 --> 45:59.740
Once the ideology goes beyond words and becomes action,

45:59.740 --> 46:04.220
fatal action at that, you can no longer claim it's just a joke.

46:04.220 --> 46:06.060
You are all in at that point.

46:06.700 --> 46:12.220
And with that in mind, let's take a look at a few of the reactions to James Alex Fields' car attack.

46:12.220 --> 46:17.740
First up is James Allsup's response to the terror attack from his Truth About Charlottesville video.

46:19.900 --> 46:23.100
Oh, wait, no it isn't, because he doesn't mention it.

46:23.100 --> 46:29.260
Beyond one passing reference to the car crash, a rather neutral phrasing for a murder there.

46:29.900 --> 46:33.260
So that's Allsup's approach, you know, just pretend it didn't happen.

46:33.900 --> 46:38.140
He elsewhere claims that all the violence came from the counter-protesters,

46:38.140 --> 46:42.460
which I guess is an easy stance to take if you're able to tune out a terror attack

46:42.460 --> 46:44.380
originating on your side.

46:44.380 --> 46:47.580
You know, if we don't look at it, it didn't happen, I guess.

46:47.580 --> 46:51.020
That's the media-savvy alt-right tactic there.

46:51.020 --> 46:56.300
Now the other alt-right tactic is to defame the victim, Heather Heyer.

46:56.300 --> 47:00.940
Jason Kessler, who early predicted the rally attendees would be non-violent,

47:00.940 --> 47:02.220
tweeted out,

47:07.900 --> 47:11.900
And he's sharing there a Daily Stormer article which says,

47:23.420 --> 47:28.540
Christopher Cantwell was, of course, his usual charming self about the whole affair.

47:28.540 --> 47:33.580
The fact that nobody on our side died, I'd go ahead and call that points for us.

47:34.620 --> 47:40.300
The fact that none of our people killed anybody unjustly, I think, is a plus for us.

47:41.260 --> 47:44.300
Matthew Heimbach also approached reporters to say,

47:49.100 --> 47:53.740
So this is what happens when things escalate beyond speech and someone is murdered.

47:53.740 --> 47:58.060
They don't disavow the murderer, they rally around them and defend.

47:58.060 --> 48:01.740
And there was, of course, also a conspiracy theory

48:01.740 --> 48:04.700
that Heather Heyer was not hit by the car at all

48:04.700 --> 48:11.420
and instead, coincidentally, died of a heart attack nearby at around the same time.

48:11.420 --> 48:15.100
Of course, this ignores both that her death was ruled a homicide

48:15.100 --> 48:17.900
and that the medical examiner's office in Richmond, Virginia,

48:17.900 --> 48:21.820
determined that Heyer's cause of death was blunt force trauma to the torso.

48:22.380 --> 48:27.180
Regardless of the truth, however, the heart attack lie persisted.

48:27.180 --> 48:33.020
In neo-Nazi circles, obviously, but also among those seemingly with Nazi sympathies.

48:57.180 --> 49:23.020
That's white supremacist millennial woes there, talking to YouTube personality Sargon of Akkad,

49:23.020 --> 49:28.540
who is, as usual, mindlessly repeating whatever rubbish he's overheard Nazis say.

49:29.100 --> 49:31.900
Is that a random jab at Sargon from me there?

49:32.540 --> 49:33.660
Well, a little bit.

49:33.660 --> 49:36.380
But I do think there's an important point to be made here

49:36.380 --> 49:41.580
about how easily white nationalist lies can spread among the lazy and uneducated.

49:42.220 --> 49:47.260
I mention it here because James Field's trial is scheduled for later this year

49:47.260 --> 49:51.180
and all the alt-right's lies and deformations will be brought out again.

49:51.820 --> 49:55.820
They will lie about the nature of those present at the Charlottesville rally.

49:55.820 --> 49:57.900
They will lie about James Fields.

49:57.900 --> 50:00.700
They will lie about how Heather Heyer died.

50:00.700 --> 50:04.700
And we need to be vigilant in checking and correcting those lies,

50:04.700 --> 50:09.580
lest we end up as witless Nazi stooges just like Sargon of Akkad.

50:09.580 --> 50:12.140
So that's about it for me today, folks.

50:12.140 --> 50:14.700
But I'd like to wrap up with a final thought here.

50:15.260 --> 50:17.820
James Allsup, in his Unite the Right video,

50:18.380 --> 50:24.460
rather hilariously predicts that Charlottesville would be seen as a PR victory for the alt-right.

50:25.420 --> 50:26.700
But where are we today?

50:27.500 --> 50:30.860
Well, the alt-right are in disarray, I'm happy to say.

50:31.420 --> 50:35.580
Richard Spencer recently posted a video calling off his college tour,

50:35.580 --> 50:38.220
citing heavy resistance by anti-fascists

50:38.220 --> 50:42.780
as the main reason why he's barely able to draw a double-digit crowd anymore.

50:42.780 --> 50:46.860
He also acknowledges Charlottesville as the turning point in the movement,

50:46.860 --> 50:51.340
and one can read between the lines and see what he wanted out of Unite the Right.

50:51.340 --> 50:55.660
The far right would turn up, pretend to be peaceful, get attacked,

50:55.660 --> 50:58.060
and then play it up and act the victim.

50:58.060 --> 51:01.660
James Fields ruined that narrative for them, of course.

51:01.660 --> 51:06.380
Alt-right figures found instead their Twitter and YouTube accounts being shut down,

51:06.380 --> 51:09.340
their web hosting taking their websites offline,

51:09.340 --> 51:11.740
their Discord servers being deleted,

51:11.740 --> 51:13.980
and the size of the anti-fascist crowds

51:13.980 --> 51:16.940
turning out to meet them at their rallies and speeches increasing.

51:17.580 --> 51:20.860
Charlottesville exposed them for what they really are,

51:20.860 --> 51:23.660
a group of cowardly Nazi thugs.

51:23.660 --> 51:26.300
They overestimated their broader support,

51:26.300 --> 51:28.140
they overplayed their hand,

51:28.140 --> 51:28.860
and they lost.

51:29.580 --> 51:32.860
However, this is a somewhat hollow victory,

51:32.860 --> 51:37.820
in particular because it took someone being killed in order to turn the tide,

51:38.460 --> 51:41.500
and also because we can be sure that the alt-right,

51:41.500 --> 51:47.020
neo-Nazis, white nationalists, identitarians, whatever you want to call them,

51:47.660 --> 51:50.220
they will lick their wounds and resurface.

51:50.780 --> 51:52.460
They will try all this again.

51:53.020 --> 51:56.380
So what we need to do is remember who these people are,

51:56.380 --> 51:58.300
remember what they stand for,

51:58.300 --> 52:01.420
and remember what they do when given a chance.

52:01.420 --> 52:06.700
I titled this video the true alt-right because of that particular clip from earlier,

52:06.700 --> 52:12.300
in which the speaker urges the crowd to remember the first precept of the true alt-right.

52:18.940 --> 52:22.460
And this is exactly how we should remember these people, too.

52:23.020 --> 52:25.100
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

52:25.100 --> 52:27.580
Sorry about the delay getting this video out there.

52:27.580 --> 52:30.620
It was a bit of a monster to make, as I'm sure you can imagine,

52:30.620 --> 52:34.060
and I got rather sick right in the middle of editing it, which was just terrible.

52:34.700 --> 52:40.060
If you feel sorry enough for me and you'd like to see more videos like this or the others on my channel,

52:40.060 --> 52:43.260
you can head over to Patreon and send me a dollar or two.

52:43.260 --> 52:48.780
And thank you again to all my supporters whose generosity makes it possible for me to keep doing this.

52:48.780 --> 52:52.460
You can also follow me on Twitter or send me a question on Curious Cat.

52:52.460 --> 52:54.300
I'll put those links below.

52:54.300 --> 52:56.220
And as a note here at the end,

52:56.220 --> 53:01.260
I half expect this video to possibly be flagged down with a series of false reports.

53:01.260 --> 53:04.780
There's obviously several points in it where you could clip someone out of context

53:04.780 --> 53:08.700
saying something horrible and then report it to YouTube's algorithm.

53:08.700 --> 53:11.980
And I'll take it as a point of pride if it does get flagged down, of course,

53:11.980 --> 53:15.260
because it would be far-right chumps flagging their own hate speech.

53:15.820 --> 53:18.700
Regardless, if it does get taken down,

53:18.700 --> 53:21.900
feel free to mirror this video on whatever platform you like.

53:22.460 --> 53:25.500
Mirroring flagged videos has proven to be an excellent counter

53:25.500 --> 53:28.940
to the far-right tactic of false flagging criticism.

53:28.940 --> 53:32.700
So if it does happen, you're more than welcome to re-host it.

53:32.700 --> 53:34.140
Okay, thanks folks.

53:34.140 --> 53:36.940
That's all from me today, and I'll see you next time.
