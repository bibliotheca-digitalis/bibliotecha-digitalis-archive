0	1260	Hello, everyone.
1260	8180	This is a video about the Unite the Right rally that took place on August 12th of last year in Charlottesville, Virginia.
8180	11520	Many of you will be familiar with the general events of the day.
11520	16440	It was a rally attended by far-right figures such as Richard Spencer and David Duke,
16440	24140	organized to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee from a park in Charlottesville.
24340	30640	Shortly before the event was scheduled to begin amid violent clashes between Unite the Right attendees and protesters,
30640	35320	the rally was declared an unlawful assembly and police began clearing the park.
35740	43740	Soon afterwards, a white supremacist drove his car into a group of counter-protesters, injuring several people, one fatally.
43740	47580	He was later arrested and charged with second-degree murder.
47580	52340	Now, this fatal attack was obviously the main news story that came out of the event,
52340	57140	but also noteworthy were President Trump's later comments to reporters about the rally.
57140	61540	Firstly, condemning hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides,
61540	67300	and then later saying that there were in attendance at the rally very fine people on both sides,
67300	70020	comments for which he was widely condemned.
70020	73300	So that's the Unite the Right rally in a nutshell there.
73300	75900	So what is the purpose of my video?
75980	83820	Well, primarily, it's to examine some of the alt-right responses to Charlottesville which emerged in the months after the rally was held.
83820	87340	For example, if you search for Unite the Right on YouTube,
87340	95420	well, the first result is a Vice News video featuring scenes from the rally alongside interviews with organizers and speakers at the event,
95420	97820	including speaker Christopher Cantwell.
97820	101260	["We were asking whether white people were capable of violence."
101260	105100	["I didn't say capable. Of course we're capable. I'm carrying a pistol. I go to the gym all the time."
105100	108220	["I'm trying to make myself more capable of violence."
108220	114620	And true to his word, Cantwell was later arrested for pepper-spraying anti-fascist protesters at the rally,
114620	120700	his tearful video explaining the situation earned him the moniker The Crying Nazi.
120700	123500	So, that's interesting, isn't it, to start with?
123500	127740	One of the speakers at the rally was arrested for violence at the rally.
127740	130060	That's just something to remember for later.
130060	135100	Anyway, only a few videos below that one in the YouTube search results is this video.
135100	141420	The Truth About Charlottesville Unite the Right by James Allsup, with over 80,000 views.
141420	147180	Now, James Allsup is an alt-right YouTuber who was present at Unite the Right live-streaming it.
147180	148700	There he is there.
148700	152220	Now, this video was released very soon after the Unite the Right rally,
152220	156540	when obviously, what with the white nationalist terror attack that killed someone,
156540	160780	the mainstream opinion of the Unite the Right attendees was rather low.
160780	165660	And Allsup's video is one of many white nationalist attempts to put the brakes on that narrative,
165660	171900	so there's lots of deflection, attempts at recontextualization, and outright lies.
171900	176380	Don't take my word for it, though. We'll start looking at those in a little while.
176380	178940	But firstly, I'd like to ask a question.
178940	185260	James Allsup live-streamed the Unite the Right rally, and he uses clips from his live-stream in his video.
185260	187740	But he has since taken that stream down.
187740	192460	Likewise, other alt-right figures such as Baked Alaska were present at the rally,
192460	198380	and Baked Alaska also live-streamed the event, and has also since taken his stream down.
198380	200620	So why did they do this?
200620	204780	Surely if James Allsup wanted us to see the truth about Charlottesville,
204780	207900	he could have left his unedited stream up on YouTube.
207900	212540	You can't get more truthful than a direct video of the event, after all.
212540	216140	So my question is, what are they trying to hide?
216140	221500	Luckily, there were plenty of willing cameramen at the rally who have not deleted their live-streams.
221500	226780	There are dozens of hours of footage from Charlottesville from a variety of different sources online,
226780	231980	and using those, we can show exactly what happened pretty much throughout the entire day.
231980	237580	Firstly, though, we'll briefly run through the events that led up to the Unite the Right rally.
237580	241100	So in early 2016, a Charlottesville high school student
241100	245900	started a petition to remove Confederate monuments from Charlottesville parks.
245900	253020	Vice mayor Wes Bellamy agreed, and held a press conference in which he urged the removal of the monuments.
253020	257340	For this, Bellamy drew the ire of white nationalist Jason Kessler,
257340	260460	the man who would later organize the Unite the Right rally,
260460	263900	who started a petition to get Bellamy removed from office.
263900	269740	Incidentally, in January of 2017, while out collecting signatures for said petition,
269740	272380	Jason Kessler assaulted someone.
272380	276220	I was just having a bad day. I've never done this kind of thing before.
276220	281420	Jason Kessler admits that he punched this man, James Taylor, in the face.
281420	286060	Man to man, you can expect to get punched if you yell in another man's face.
286060	291660	Kessler pled guilty in court and was sentenced to complete 50 hours of community service.
291660	295100	So that's the organizer of the free speech rally there,
295100	298940	a man who punches people who say things that he doesn't like.
298940	300700	Anyway, back to the timeline.
300700	307260	In early 2017, the city council voted to remove the statue of Robert E. Lee from Emancipation Park,
307260	314540	which kicked off a bit of an endless legal battle about whether or not the city can actually remove the statues or not.
314540	321020	More relevant for us, though, is that it drew harsh criticism from conservatives and far-right figures.
321020	328620	In April of 2017, Jason Kessler met white nationalist Richard Spencer at a protest in Washington, D.C.
328620	335900	Kessler and Spencer decided to hold a rally protesting the removal of Charlottesville's Confederate monuments to be held on May 13th.
335900	342140	Now, the May the 13th demonstration was a relatively small affair compared to the later Unite the Right rally.
342140	346860	Speeches were given in Jackson Park by the likes of Richard Spencer and Mike Enoch,
346860	350860	the host of the anti-semitic podcast The Daily Shoah.
350860	355820	Shoah being the Hebrew word for Holocaust there, so a lovely chap.
355820	360460	And later on May the 13th, the protesters moved to Lee Park with lit torches,
360460	364700	but this gathering quickly broke up and left the park after police turned up.
364700	372860	The next significant protest against the removal of the Confederate monuments was held on July the 8th by the Ku Klux Klan.
372860	374700	Yeah, those guys.
374700	381900	This rally was a rather messy affair that eventually saw police use tear gas to disperse the crowd of counter-protesters.
381900	387980	I won't go into the July the 8th KKK rally all too deeply, but I'll use it to introduce this report.
387980	392780	The independent review of the 2017 protest events in Charlottesville, Virginia,
392780	397100	compiled by the law firm Hunton & Williams and commissioned by the city.
397100	402460	This report is highly critical of the Charlottesville Police Department's handling of the KKK rally,
402460	407180	In a section titled What Went Wrong, the report contains subsections titled
407180	410540	Law enforcement failed to operate within a unified command.
410540	413900	Law enforcement allowed media inside the law enforcement zone.
413900	418300	The operational plan created insufficient space for opposing groups, and crucially,
418300	421900	the deployment of tear gas was unauthorized by command,
421900	429340	which says there was no unified plan or understanding as to who would authorize the use of tear gas on July the 8th.
429420	432780	In other words, the police were just rubbish.
432780	440300	This smaller KKK event serves as a preview for the mistakes the police would make on August 12th at the Unite the Right rally,
440300	445500	and this police incompetence drew major criticism from the alt-right after the event.
445500	449820	So we're going to go through the events of the entirety of the Unite the Right rally now,
449820	454460	while paying particular attention to the mistakes the police made throughout the day.
454460	458140	So late on August 11th, the day before the rally was scheduled,
458140	462220	a group of white nationalists marched through the University of Virginia's campus,
462220	465420	chanting Nazi slogans and throwing Nazi salutes.
466220	469420	This was an unscheduled event that was not announced beforehand,
469420	473260	so there were few counter-protesters and a delayed police response.
473900	479020	The marchers surrounded the few counter-protesters that were present and held abuse at them,
479020	483900	and several fights broke out, which the police broke up when they finally arrived.
483900	487020	And we'll come back and talk about the torch rally a little more later on,
487020	489660	but for now, let's move on to the main event.
489660	492620	And I suppose I should introduce our cameramen here.
492620	496780	For the first part of the day, I will be mainly showing footage from the livestream
496780	501340	organized by members of the alt-right's since-deleted Discord server.
501340	507900	This is from the video titled Unite the Right All Day Livestream, hosted on the channel TheBigKK.
507900	511900	This stream covers events prior to the police clearing the park.
511900	514620	After that, we'll be following Baked Alaska's crew,
514620	517740	whose streams started just prior to the park being cleared.
521820	526460	Now, Baked Alaska and James Allsup both deleted their streams, as I mentioned,
526460	532060	but this chap here, in the red shirt and the helmet with the Kekistan flag on the front,
532060	536460	his stream still exists, so we can follow that stream for the rest of the day.
536460	539340	Yeah, we'll be dipping into a few other sources as we go,
539340	541740	but those are our two main camera crews there,
541740	546060	the alt-right Discord channel and Baked Alaska and his entourage.
546060	549980	And I also have a few clips from James Allsup's deleted stream,
549980	553500	which were re-uploaded to YouTube by somebody else.
553500	558460	Now, that person has added their own subtitles and annotations over the video,
558460	562300	somewhat annoyingly, most of which I've blanked out.
562300	568380	So if you see a clip with a bit of the screen missing, that's James Allsup's deleted stream.
568380	570860	Starting off with the Discord crew, then.
570860	576140	They began the day in a car park in McIntyre Park, waiting to be bused to the event.
576780	581420	As they're milling about, we see several far-right figures in the assembled groups.
581420	585020	There's David Duke, the former Grand Wizard of the KKK.
585980	587660	Mike Enoch is there.
587660	590380	Richard Spencer is there with his crew, of course.
590380	593660	And they also take the time to interview Jason Kessler.
593660	595020	You can't stop the alt-right.
595660	599500	There's a warning to anybody across the country who tries to shut us down.
599500	600460	They're gonna fail.
600460	604540	This is gonna be the largest demonstration in the history of the alt-right so far,
604540	606620	and we'll only get bigger from here.
606620	611580	Get ready for kibetching on a massive, massive scale from the left-wing media,
611580	612620	but fuck them, you know?
613580	619740	They're already trying to run their narratives about us being violent or whatever.
619740	621820	Of course we're gonna defend ourselves.
621820	623420	Of course we're gonna defend ourselves.
623420	628220	But the media tries to portray it that we're the violent ones.
628220	630460	But you'll see today, of course...
630460	634860	I mean, given what happens in a few hours, he couldn't have been more wrong about that.
635500	640380	We also see Nathan D'Amigo, founder of the group Identity Europa,
640380	643820	seen here at an earlier protest, punching a woman in the face.
644380	648220	D'Amigo has also done time in prison for pulling a gun on a cab driver
648220	649660	and robbing him for, quote,
650300	651420	"...looking Iraqi."
652140	656220	Is anyone keeping score, by the way, for the organizers of this thing?
656300	661340	It'd probably be quicker to list the ones who haven't been arrested for assaulting someone.
661340	664140	Anyway, after the little meet-and-greet in the car park,
664140	668060	groups start heading over to Emancipation Park by van.
668060	673260	And it's here that the first big mistake the Charlottesville police made comes into play.
673260	676140	So we'll leave the rally attendees en route for the moment
676140	678940	and talk about the police action plan for the day.
678940	681260	So this plan went through several designs
681260	684780	before it arrived at the one that was circulated on August 7th,
684780	686540	a few days before the rally.
686540	688460	Now, there are a few problems with this plan,
689100	693420	the first of which will have been spotted already by any keen-eyed viewers out there.
693420	695420	They spelled the name of the rally wrong.
695980	697580	Unit the Right.
697580	702620	Anyway, on this map, the police deployment areas are designated by the zone arrows.
702620	706140	So they had five separate deployment areas total.
706140	709740	Although it's worth noting here that Virginia State Police were working with
709740	713260	an earlier version of the plan that had four deployment zones.
713260	716220	So the VSP commanders were confused when they turned up.
716860	718780	Off to a great start there.
718780	722700	So this plan sections off a quarter of the park for the Unit the Right rally,
722700	726060	and a quarter of the park is designated a public area.
726060	728220	So that's for the counter-protesters.
728860	732540	The police deployed to Zone 2 would be between the double barricade
732540	734380	keeping the two groups separate.
734380	738140	And the police deployed to Zone 5, the road to the south of the park,
738140	741340	would be there to break up fights and make arrests.
741340	745660	Great plan, on paper, spelling mistakes aside.
745660	749900	So how did we get from this plan to just one big mess of people
749900	752380	fighting in the streets of the south of the park?
752380	755500	Well, it's because of a couple of key last-minute changes
755500	757260	that were made by the police department.
757820	761980	So back to the Unit the Right attendees that are en route to the rally-by van.
762540	766700	When the police learned that the vans would be dropping people off to the west of the park,
766700	771260	they switched the designated areas for protesters and counter-protesters.
771260	775980	They did this less than 24 hours before the rally was scheduled to begin.
775980	778460	And quoting the Hunton and Williams report,
778460	782220	it appears that no efforts were made to communicate the zone designation
782220	784220	to counter-protest groups.
784220	788620	From later in the report, we can see the effect that this zone switching had.
788620	792380	At 9.42am, the first organized group of demonstrators
792380	795660	carrying the flag of identity Europa, remember them,
795660	800060	and led by Eli Mosley, entered the public area of Emancipation Park
800060	801900	through the southeast entrance.
801900	806700	Body camera footage shows Mosley walking over to the police officers stationed in Zone 2
806700	810140	and asking whether they were in the right section of the park.
810140	814860	Officers told Mosley that the designated Unit the Right area was in the opposite section.
815420	819500	Mosley called out to his group to form up and go around to the other side.
819500	822940	And this misunderstanding is something that was repeated throughout the day
822940	825740	with the various different alt-right groups.
825740	830380	So the arriving rally attendees are confused about where they're supposed to be.
830380	834940	And to change zones, they have to walk along the road to the south of the park.
834940	836540	But that's okay, right?
836540	839820	What about all the police officers stationed in Zone 5
839820	843020	to break up fights and keep the protesters apart?
843020	846300	Well, that's the other last-minute change that was made to this plan.
846300	847420	And I quote,
847420	849740	Captain Lewis told us it was her understanding
849740	853820	Zone 5 officers would be tasked with breaking up fights on Market Street.
854380	857500	But the parking lot backed up to the Wells Fargo building
857500	860140	where the Unified Command Center would be hosted.
860140	864860	VSP insisted that the entire area be protected by barricades.
864860	868060	CPD complied with the request and installed barricades
868060	871740	along the surface parking lot south of Emancipation Park.
871740	876380	This crucial change effectively stationed the officers in Zone 5 behind barricades,
876380	878940	much like the officers assigned to the other four zones.
879500	882780	As a result, no officers were assigned to open areas
882780	886140	in which protesters and counter-protesters would interact.
886140	888060	And indeed, the Hunt and Williams report,
888060	891980	written by people who had access to all the police body cam footage for the day,
891980	896060	notes only one instance of an officer leaving the barricaded zones
896060	897900	in order to break up a fight.
897900	902380	So the very poorly communicated last-minute changes to the police plan
902380	906300	ensured that basically nobody was aware of where they were supposed to be.
906860	911100	And the inability of the police to respond to the changing circumstances
911100	914620	saw them mostly just standing there watching it happen.
914620	915420	And I quote,
915420	919260	"...VSP directed its officers to remain behind barricades
919260	924620	rather than risk injury responding to conflicts between protesters and counter-protesters."
925420	928460	Yeah, that's your job, though.
928460	930220	You know... kinda.
931100	935020	Another genius moment from the Charlottesville Police Department is this one.
935020	939660	Mitchell told us he intentionally channeled entry to and exit from the interior of the park
939660	943260	through the staircases at its southeast and southwest corners.
943820	946700	He explained to us that such a design would force attendees
946700	949900	to walk around and enter at those controlled locations.
949900	953820	Through communications with Jason Kessler and his security personnel,
953820	960540	CPD agreed to allow Unite the Right security members to act as doormen at the entry point
960540	965500	to ensure only demonstrators would enter the appropriate quadrant of the park.
966060	970220	So when you see the alt-right shield wall blocking off the entrance to the park,
970860	972140	that's by design.
972140	974300	That's part of the police plan.
974300	977500	They allowed the alt-right to police their own event.
977500	979820	And of course, this particular shield wall
979820	982940	is blocking off the entrance to the public area of the park
982940	985340	because they don't know where they're supposed to be.
985340	988220	So this big mess of people was inevitable, really.
988220	991980	And the police do deserve the lion's share of the blame here.
991980	996300	However, I'm not about to let the alt-right off the hook that easily.
996300	1001100	They themselves repeatedly exacerbated the situation unnecessarily.
1001100	1005580	First off, once the Unite the Right attendees were actually inside their own rally,
1005580	1009980	they repeatedly ran groups back outside to fight with counter-protesters.
1009980	1012540	One live stream from just outside the barricades
1012540	1015820	captured one of these groups being organized and moved out.
1015820	1032380	And this is how the alt-right discord stream ends, actually.
1036380	1040540	They then form up into one of these groups and run out of the park.
1040540	1043340	The other big criticism of the alt-right I have here
1043340	1046860	is the unnecessary presence of the speakers and, quote,
1046860	1049820	VIPs outside the rally.
1049820	1053420	Because the police actually did do one thing right on the day.
1053420	1056140	They organized an unmarked police escort
1056140	1060460	to move the noteworthy alt-right figures and rally speakers to the park.
1060460	1063980	The plan was to bring the VIPs into the park around the back,
1063980	1066220	safely under police protection.
1066220	1069260	So it's kind of confusing to then hear Richard Spencer
1069260	1072460	complain about being attacked on his way into the park.
1072540	1075020	Okay, so here's another point that's got to be made.
1075660	1078700	The communists were doing all the attacking from the outside.
1078700	1079740	They were throwing bricks.
1079740	1082380	I got assaulted by Antifa as I was entering.
1082380	1083420	Oh, I did too, we all did.
1083420	1086860	Other people were sprayed with pepper spray or mayonnaise.
1086860	1087900	I don't know which one it was.
1087900	1089500	It was absolutely terrible.
1090060	1092540	And we elsewhere see James also complain about
1092540	1095180	Baked Alaska being attacked on his way into the park.
1095820	1099740	Where the police were on what I believe was the south side of the park.
1099740	1102140	They formed a line on the south side of the park
1102220	1105820	where there were no counter demonstrators or no protesters.
1105820	1109100	And they left the north end of the park where people were funneling into.
1109100	1113660	Myself, Baked Alaska, and others completely unguarded and unprotected.
1114540	1117580	We were essentially, you know, thrown to the wolves and were actually forced,
1117580	1119020	and I'll show this video here too,
1119020	1124940	forced to break through the line of anti-unite the right demonstrators.
1124940	1126620	So how was this possible?
1126620	1129180	What happened to that police escort?
1129180	1130060	And I quote,
1130060	1132860	Just after 9am, Sergeant Tony Newberry,
1132860	1137100	the detective who had been in touch with Unite the Right security organizer Jack Pierce
1137100	1139820	about getting speakers and VIPs into the park,
1139820	1143900	was driving around the downtown area with his partner in an unmarked van.
1143900	1147500	Pierce had refused to share where the speakers would be gathering that day
1147500	1149180	to assemble for the convoy,
1149180	1152780	but Newberry knew by now that they were at McIntyre Park.
1152780	1155180	As the morning went on and groups began to gather,
1155180	1159100	Newberry was anxious to get the speakers and VIPs into the park.
1159820	1162460	Newberry called Pierce's cell phone and told him,
1162460	1165340	There's never going to be a better time than right now.
1165340	1169820	Pierce said he understood and responded he would get everyone together and call Newberry back.
1170460	1171820	A few minutes later,
1171820	1175500	Pierce called back and told Newberry that the speakers had changed their minds
1175500	1180220	about coming in separately because they wanted to walk in with their audiences.
1180220	1183500	There will be no police escort from McIntyre Park.
1183500	1187100	Newberry told us he had a hunch that Pierce had been tricked into working with him
1187100	1191100	and that the rally organizers had never planned to be brought in the back of the park.
1191660	1193020	After the call ended,
1193020	1197980	Newberry turned to his partner in the van and told him they do not plan on this going well.
1197980	1202380	So you can't really blame the police for anything that happened to the speakers and VIPs
1202380	1206300	entering the event as they turned down available police protection.
1206860	1209580	And I'd like to say a few more things about James Allsup
1209580	1212060	and Baked Alaska's entrance to the park here.
1212780	1215900	Allsup himself lets us know the time that they arrived.
1227660	1229500	However, from the timeline of events,
1229500	1235420	we can see that the unlawful assembly was called half an hour earlier at 11.31.
1235420	1238380	Which means Baked Alaska, James Allsup and crew,
1238380	1242380	when they forced their way through the line of counter protesters to get into the park,
1242380	1245100	were pushing their way into an unlawful assembly.
1245660	1247820	So when James Allsup says,
1247820	1249660	Right, they were trying to inhibit our movement,
1249660	1253500	they were forming blockades to block us from, from entering the event,
1253500	1256540	that's unlawful detention, that's a form of violence.
1256540	1259100	Sorry James, but that just isn't true.
1259100	1262060	The rally was an unlawful assembly by that point.
1262060	1266060	You were also forcing your way into the wrong area of the park,
1266060	1268780	the designated counter protester area.
1268780	1271980	But of course we can't really blame you for that misunderstanding,
1271980	1275020	that one is mainly on the police for changing the zones.
1275660	1279420	I almost feel bad for the Unite the Right VIPs here.
1279420	1283340	They traveled all the way there, they turned down the police escort,
1283340	1285820	and then they hear that the event's being called off.
1285820	1289180	So they have to book it down to the park as fast as possible,
1289180	1293500	and force their way in so they can film themselves getting thrown out.
1294060	1296620	To justify the trip, I guess.
1296620	1298700	Or a sad little display.
1298700	1302940	Anyway, let's get back to our timeline, with the police now clearing the park.
1302940	1306780	And this leads us to yet another big mistake made by the police.
1306780	1311900	They put no thought into how the crowds would disperse after the rally was over.
1311900	1315180	As the crowd dispersed, law enforcement failed to prevent
1315180	1318380	and respond to violent confrontations in and around the park.
1318380	1322140	Those in the park at the time of the unlawful assembly were pushed straight south,
1322140	1326460	into the area on Market Street where counter protesters had assembled.
1326460	1329100	Predictably, violent confrontations occurred
1329100	1333020	as the Unite the Right protesters streamed past the counter protesters.
1333020	1336460	Rather than separate the crowds and break up individual fights,
1336460	1339340	troopers stood behind barricades as people left the park.
1339900	1343180	The CPD officers who could have de-escalated confrontations
1343180	1348540	stood in the back of Emancipation Park, acting as a rear guard for the VSP field force.
1348540	1354540	This thoughtless attitude towards the aftermath of clearing the park had fatal consequences.
1354540	1356860	And I quote from later in the report,
1356860	1360780	"...Officer Tammy Shifflett was in a vulnerable position at her assigned post
1360780	1364380	at the intersection of 4th Street Northeast and Market Street.
1364380	1367340	Although she is a sworn police officer and carries a firearm,
1367340	1371820	Officer Shifflett is a school resource officer who works in an elementary school,
1371820	1375500	and she had just returned to active duty following more than two months of leave
1375500	1377980	while recovering from elbow surgery.
1377980	1380140	In the face of the Market Street skirmishes
1380140	1383100	that broke out after the unlawful assembly declaration,
1383100	1386540	Officer Shifflett felt unsafe and radioed for assistance.
1386540	1390300	She was soon reassigned and she moved her vehicle away from that intersection.
1390300	1392380	After Officer Shifflett departed,
1392380	1396620	all that remained at the crucial intersection was a wooden saw horse barricade.
1396620	1399180	Lieutenant Steve Nick, the traffic supervisor,
1399180	1402300	was not aware Officer Shifflett had been reassigned.
1402300	1406220	No one in the command center fought to replace Officer Shifflett with other officers
1406220	1408780	or install any additional barricades.
1408780	1411900	And this, of course, was the street where James Alex Fields
1411900	1415500	was then able to drive his car into the group of counter protesters,
1415500	1418300	an attack that was made possible by the poor planning
1418300	1422140	and lack of communication within the Charlottesville Police Department.
1422140	1425260	We'll talk more about James Alex Fields later on.
1425260	1427580	For now, let's rejoin Baked Alaska and crew
1427580	1432540	who are in the large group of rally attendees making their way back to McIntyre Park.
1432540	1437260	At some point, Baked Alaska's stream crosses paths with David Dukes
1437260	1439740	and Baked Alaska tells him that he loves him.
1451340	1455740	At another point, someone convinces Baked Alaska to spray soap in his own eyes.
1456700	1457740	Which is kind of funny.
1462780	1483820	So as this ridiculous procession moved down the road,
1484460	1487500	Richard Spencer arrived in a convoy of cars,
1487500	1492060	leading to a terribly pathetic outbreak of fanboyism from all present.
1492700	1493420	Oh, Spencer.
1494220	1494940	OK, we're doing it.
1494940	1495340	We're doing it.
1499340	1499980	Hold on, hold on.
1499980	1500700	Watch out for the pole.
1501660	1503260	Call him and tell him I'm coming up there.
1504060	1505820	Tell Spencer I'm coming.
1522540	1537820	Richard Spencer and the MPI guys making a surprise appearance.
1551260	1551820	All right.
1551820	1552300	All right.
1552860	1554060	Wait, which lane?
1554060	1554620	Which lane?
1554620	1558860	James Allsup sprints up the road to try to hold traffic for Spencer's car
1558860	1561420	and gets completely shut down by some random guy.
1561980	1563420	Hey guys, guys, guys, guys.
1563420	1563900	Don't cross.
1563900	1564700	We need to get Richard.
1564700	1565260	Richard's in his car.
1565260	1565820	He needs to get out.
1565820	1567580	I don't give a fuck about Richard Spencer.
1567580	1568080	OK, well.
1568700	1571580	Allsup later talks to a friend about David Duke.
1571580	1572700	Did you see Dr. Duke?
1572700	1573180	I did.
1573180	1573740	Was he here?
1573740	1575020	David Duke was the Duke.
1575020	1575980	The Dukester himself.
1576700	1577500	I disavowed.
1579740	1581580	Yeah, of course, of course, of course disavowed.
1582540	1583100	Of course.
1583100	1584860	I'm seeing a lot of Murdoch Murdoch t-shirts.
1584860	1586940	I disavow, of course.
1586940	1590940	I love that particular backpedal there because it contrasts beautifully
1590940	1593820	with a section from his Unite the Right video.
1593820	1596460	Repeatedly stated my position on Nazism.
1596460	1600540	I don't, I'm not a Nazi, but no amount of disavowing.
1600540	1605340	And I've realized this after dealing with the media very hard for the last week or so.
1605340	1610300	No amount of disavowing is going to convince the leftists, oh, he's not a Nazi.
1610300	1616140	Now, James, the problem isn't with disavowing Nazis and racists not being good enough.
1616700	1617340	Because it is.
1618140	1621740	The problem is with you disavowing Nazis and racists.
1621740	1627180	Because when you disavow Nazis and racists, you're obviously lying.
1627180	1630940	You know, you don't get to frantically cheer for Richard Spencer
1630940	1634620	and get all excited when you hear David Duke is present and then go,
1635340	1637340	well, of course, I disavow.
1637340	1639900	You know, who do you think that's supposed to fool?
1639900	1645100	You're treating disavowing something like a get-out-of-jail-free card in Monopoly.
1645100	1647900	You could at least act like you mean it, you know?
1648540	1651820	Let's stick with James for a bit and move on and talk about the signs,
1651820	1654780	flags, and iconography present at the rally.
1655420	1658540	Being completely honest, there were a couple people there
1658540	1663340	with swastika flags or Hitler iconography or whatever.
1663340	1669820	And I was reviewing the live streams of the event that Baked Alaska did start.
1669820	1673340	And then Matt took over for and that I had.
1673340	1678300	And in all of our footage, I think I saw a combined three swastika flags.
1678300	1679820	Three swastika flags, okay.
1679820	1685340	And so let's say, you know, for every swastika flag there are 10 Nazis there in support.
1686220	1689020	Okay, so that puts you at 30 Nazis, right?
1689020	1693900	So James also apparently didn't personally see many swastika flags.
1693900	1697260	So that means that there weren't many neo-Nazis at the event.
1698060	1700780	Now I could go through the various videos and streams
1700780	1704380	and find all the instances of people waving swastika flags.
1704380	1707900	You know, there's obviously the one that Allsub includes in his video.
1707900	1709580	And here's another one.
1709580	1710540	And another one.
1711100	1712060	And another one.
1712700	1713660	And so on.
1713660	1716620	And here's a chap in a swastika t-shirt even.
1716620	1721340	However, that would be the wrong way to answer James Allsub's claim.
1721340	1725660	Because that would buy into the idea that the only way to spot a neo-Nazi
1725660	1728140	is to see them waving a swastika flag.
1728140	1732620	There were, after all, lots of other flags and symbols on display at the rally.
1732620	1735260	So let's take a look at a few of those.
1735260	1740300	First up, this here is a black sun flag, also known as a sonnenrat.
1740940	1743340	This is a symbol often used by neo-Nazis
1743340	1746860	because it was once used by the precursors to the neo-Nazis.
1747740	1748540	The Nazis.
1749420	1755500	Here it is on the floor of the former General's Hall at Wühlsburg Castle in Germany.
1755740	1756860	I pronounced that wrong.
1757500	1762220	Which was operated by Heinrich Himmler's SS during the Second World War.
1762220	1765580	If you see someone waving a black sun flag at a rally,
1765580	1770780	they're basically waving a swastika flag, but they're trying to be clever about it.
1770780	1773100	Here it is on a bunch of shields.
1773100	1777340	And this guy seems to have mixed it in with a confederate flag, which is a bit odd.
1777340	1782860	And here's a variant of that flag in a photo with a group of odd fellows throwing Nazi salutes.
1782860	1786620	Now, the cheery guy in the center there is Matthew Heimbach,
1786620	1789580	who was one of the listed speakers at the rally.
1789580	1795580	Incidentally, Matthew Heimbach was arrested for domestic battery during the editing of this video.
1796140	1798460	Interesting little tidbit there.
1798460	1801980	And here's another black sun shield in the right of a photograph
1801980	1807820	alongside some shields bearing a logo of the white supremacist group Vanguard America.
1807820	1811260	Now, center in this photo is James Alex Fields,
1811260	1815820	the person who later drove his car into the crowd of counter-protesters.
1815820	1817500	Next up is this flag.
1817500	1822780	This is the flag of the United States National Socialist Movement.
1822780	1826060	And I hope I don't have to explain the origins of that name.
1826700	1828940	They put in quite a showing at Charlottesville.
1828940	1834220	They had a big banner and a bunch of flags and members in attendance wearing their t-shirts.
1834220	1840060	Now, this flag is actually a 2016 redesign of their former flag, which looked like this.
1840620	1845020	And I'm not sure we need an Enigma machine to decipher this Nazi code.
1845020	1849180	They swapped out the swastika for this rune, an Odal rune,
1849180	1854540	variants of which were used by two different SS divisions during the Second World War.
1854540	1856940	So if you see someone waving this flag,
1856940	1861420	they're again waving a swastika flag, but trying to be clever about it.
1861420	1865900	Coincidentally, one of these flags is in the footage James also shows
1865900	1868940	as he's saying he didn't spot many swastikas.
1868940	1873020	This is a banner advertising the website The Daily Stormer,
1873020	1879580	which is named for the former Nazi propaganda newspaper Der Sturmer, or The Stormer.
1879580	1883020	The Daily Stormer had quite a little following going at the rally,
1883020	1885260	but more on them in a moment.
1885260	1887980	So here to James Allsup, I would say this.
1887980	1892540	It doesn't matter how many swastika flags you personally happen to see at the rally.
1892540	1897260	The acceptable amount of swastika flags at the rally would be zero.
1897260	1898780	You can't get away with saying,
1898780	1902540	well, only some of us were Nazis, so how could you judge us as a group?
1903100	1905740	You know, the event was called Unite the Right.
1906300	1909500	If you're tolerant of any Nazis being there at all,
1909500	1913180	you're talking about uniting the Nazis with everyone else.
1913180	1916380	Secondly, swastikas aside, as we've just seen,
1916380	1919260	other Nazi imagery was everywhere.
1919260	1921180	It was impossible to miss.
1921180	1926380	So either James is so naive that he does not recognize the meaning of group names like
1926380	1928780	the National Socialist Movement,
1928780	1933500	and he thinks the swastika is the only permissible identifier of Nazi sympathies,
1933500	1937260	or he's attempting to twist the truth to mislead his audience.
1937260	1938940	Anyway, back to the symbols.
1939500	1944540	Besides the explicit Nazi flags, there was all the usual white supremacist stuff,
1944540	1949100	Crusader imagery, deus vult shields, iron crosses, and so on,
1949100	1954300	and more appropriation of Norse symbols and runes like this Falknot flag.
1954300	1957340	Of course, the Kekistan flag was out and about,
1957340	1959580	seen here on one of the streamer's helmets.
1960220	1960860	What a dork.
1961660	1966620	The Kekistan flag is not much more than a green recoloring of a Nazi flag.
1966620	1968780	Proponents, of course, claim it's all a joke,
1968780	1973020	but there comes a point when if neo-Nazis like your joke flag
1973020	1978060	and start waving your joke flag alongside their other completely not a joke flags,
1978780	1981340	maybe it's time to come up with a better joke.
1981340	1983900	There were also flags for various, quote,
1983900	1986460	Identitarian groups present at the rally,
1986460	1989500	such as the previously mentioned Identity Europa.
1990220	1995020	Leaders and members of Identity Europa, such as former leader Eli Mosley,
1995020	1996940	have praised Nazi Germany,
1996940	2001580	and have openly pushed for what they say is the Nazification of America.
2001580	2003900	Is anyone shocked by that at this point?
2004540	2009100	I mean, anyone watching this who has not already worked out what these people are
2009100	2011740	is probably never going to see what these people are.
2012300	2016140	Now, the strangest-seeming flag at the event was this one.
2016140	2021260	The flag of Rhodesia, or rather a flag of Rhodesia,
2021260	2025260	apartheid state Rhodesia, when it existed, of course,
2025260	2028700	which in this crowd kinda resolves that mystery, to be honest.
2029340	2033420	Here it is alongside the apartheid-era flag of South Africa
2033420	2035900	on a jacket worn by Dylann Roof,
2035900	2040140	a white supremacist who in 2015 murdered nine African Americans
2040140	2043820	in a mass shooting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina.
2043820	2047660	Dylann Roof is currently serving a life sentence in prison.
2047660	2052300	I mention Dylann Roof here because it's time to move on to the next section of my video.
2052300	2054700	It's time to hear these people speak.
2055260	2058780	And Dylann Roof comes up a few times in the footage I watched.
2058780	2063100	There's like, there's that line between edgy and advocating
2063100	2065660	bombing of the classroom for the fourth grade.
2065660	2067100	This is self-defense bombing.
2067900	2072380	We need to mass produce, we need to mass produce bowl cut wigs.
2073660	2078700	We really need to not, like, heroize, um...
2078700	2079260	Dylann Roof?
2079900	2081500	Yeah, we need to heroize.
2081500	2085500	The bowl cut mentioned there being a reference to Dylann Roof's haircut.
2086140	2090380	Incidentally, here's Christopher Cantwell over on gab.ai
2090380	2095340	sharing a photograph of himself with Dylann Roof's hair photoshopped on top,
2095340	2098300	fantasizing about shooting children.
2098300	2104780	Making jokes about Roof and his actions, calling him a hero even, is really telling.
2104780	2109260	These people really do support murdering black people, Jewish people,
2109260	2111980	various other minorities they don't like.
2111980	2115180	And again, don't take my word for it.
2115180	2117900	Let's listen to the rest of what they have to say.
2117900	2120700	And we'll start off by hearing a few of their chants.
2120700	2127260	Blood and toil! Blood and toil! Blood and toil!
2127260	2133260	Jews will not replace us! Jews will not replace us!
2133260	2136060	So two chants from the torch rally there.
2136060	2137660	Jews will not replace us.
2138540	2140940	Self-explanatory, that one, I should hope.
2140940	2142540	And blood and soil.
2142540	2147420	Now, blood and soil was a slogan popular in, if you can believe it,
2147420	2150700	surprise, surprise, Nazi Germany.
2150700	2152220	And sticking with that theme...
2152220	2161580	Tomorrow belongs to us! Tomorrow belongs to us! Tomorrow belongs to us!
2161580	2163420	Tomorrow belongs to us.
2163420	2167980	Either an enormous coincidence or a reference to the song Tomorrow Belongs to Me
2167980	2173660	from the 1972 film Cabaret, which is sung by a member of the Hitler Youth.
2173660	2177500	As for the non-Nazi chants, few that they were,
2177500	2179500	well, they were pretty much as you'd expect.
2179500	2188220	Fuck you, faggots! Fuck you, faggots! Fuck you, faggots!
2188220	2192780	As for casual conversation, well, I listened through hours of it.
2192780	2197500	And I'm going to include a series of clips here demonstrating how the rally attendees
2197500	2200860	speak to each other, what they think is funny,
2200860	2204460	and what they think are acceptable opinions to express.
2204460	2207660	And I apologize for having to include all of this in the video,
2207660	2210940	but I do feel it is necessary, so here we go.
2211500	2214060	Ben Shekelman Goldberg said he really likes you.
2214940	2216140	Are you single?
2216140	2216940	No, sorry.
2219420	2220700	Ben Shekelman Goldberg.
2222460	2223580	Not one of them.
2227260	2228940	He's a good boy, boys.
2228940	2230460	Just like J-B-J-B-J-B-E-R-O.
2231660	2232940	Well, I'm just curious.
2232940	2234540	Jell-O, race traitor, no exceptions.
2235660	2236140	Oh, man.
2237260	2238380	The big KK, hold on.
2239100	2241660	Saying that you should have sex with the big black beautiful Negros.
2241660	2244060	That's disgusting.
2244060	2245660	Sorry, I'm not in the bestiality.
2246700	2247820	Base sub-Saharan.
2247820	2250540	We're talking about the non-white stormers.
2252380	2255660	Did you guys see the base abo in the flag jacket or whatever?
2255660	2256700	Wait, there's an abo here?
2256700	2257260	There's an abo.
2257260	2258140	Oh, what the fuck?
2261260	2263020	West melody is a nigger.
2265420	2269260	You know, I don't even give a shit if a little fucking soy boy bitch sees my face.
2269260	2272380	Look, my bosses hate niggers and Jews anyway, you fucking communists,
2272380	2273900	so why don't you go fucking hang yourself?
2275180	2277580	On this stream, you're definitely going to see some people get wrecked.
2279340	2281820	You're going to see some little Jewish kids being suplexed.
2285420	2287100	It's not going to be pretty.
2287100	2290700	We're building an oven and it just got 10 feet taller after yesterday.
2290860	2293580	The Nazis were basically pacifists compared to us.
2295500	2296220	We're back.
2296220	2297180	Me and Matt are back.
2299180	2300060	Hell yeah.
2300060	2301340	You will not replace us.
2302380	2305820	You and your cultural Marxist faggot bullshit.
2305820	2307020	You will not replace us.
2307820	2309740	They thought we wouldn't stand up.
2309740	2310540	Guess what?
2310540	2312540	We're standing up for our rights.
2312540	2314300	We're proud to be white.
2314300	2316140	We're proud to be white, brother.
2316140	2317340	Proud to be white.
2317340	2318460	We're proud to be white.
2318460	2319340	Hail victory.
2319340	2320060	Hell yeah.
2320060	2320620	Thank you.
2350300	2351260	Black lives matter.
2351260	2354620	Today, you'll remember that 40 Antifa stood against...
2354620	2361820	Oh, when 40 Antifa stood up with our Holocaust tattoos against the Nazis yet again.
2362700	2363180	Got some...
2363180	2366540	Oh God, got some big Nazi asses in my face.
2366540	2369100	Oh, my ass neck and my...
2369100	2371820	Oh, my spine and my spleen and scabula.
2371820	2373100	Oh, my hemorrhoids.
2374940	2376220	I got to take some zinc.
2376460	2381020	Oh, look at all these goyim with these nice haircuts.
2382300	2384540	Well, she's our journalist, I think.
2384540	2386700	We haven't seen any journalists here yet.
2386700	2388460	Some actual accredited people.
2389820	2391180	New York Times.
2391180	2397500	Oh, they're from the New York Times and the New York Daily News and all these red bagels.
2397500	2399500	Oh, no, I'm Jewish.
2399500	2400220	I'm not a Nazi.
2400220	2400780	I'm Jewish.
2402300	2404780	I just had a lipshoot asking if I was Jewish.
2404780	2406460	I was like, oh, oh, goodness.
2406460	2407820	She found me out.
2407820	2408700	Oh, shit.
2409580	2410620	Oh, God.
2410620	2412540	I hope the Nazis don't beat me up.
2412540	2413180	What are you doing?
2413180	2413980	Where are you, dude?
2415180	2417340	You're going to your fucking Proud Boy meetup?
2417340	2418140	That's another thing.
2418140	2420060	Fuck you, Gavin McInnes.
2420060	2421020	You're a faggot, too.
2422140	2424140	You and your fucking Proud Boys are all faggots.
2424140	2424640	All of them.
2425740	2426220	Where are you?
2427420	2428380	You're fucking nowhere.
2429100	2431340	You're going to be at a fucking rally in Boston next week.
2431340	2432620	You're fucking faggots.
2432620	2433820	You're fucking losers.
2433820	2434940	Your movement's done.
2434940	2436060	You have no movement.
2436060	2437420	This is the fucking movement.
2437420	2439900	Either get on board or get the fuck out of the way.
2439900	2443180	That ranty chap at the end there was Millennial Matt,
2443180	2447340	the person who commandeered Baked Alaska's live stream after he was maced
2447340	2451260	and wondered around saying a bunch of vile shit like what we just heard.
2451260	2453180	He's also probably the main reason
2453180	2457020	Baked Alaska chose to take his stream down after the event.
2457020	2462140	We saw him there being very mad at far-right media figure Gavin McInnes
2462140	2463980	for choosing to skip the event
2463980	2468540	because he didn't want to be associated with a bunch of outright Nazis.
2468540	2472780	So that's how the far-right talk about their own when they break ranks there.
2472780	2476380	We also heard a lot from the alt-right Discord stream.
2476380	2481500	They were the ones who had the cameraman who liked doing that one particular impression.
2481500	2483420	They're also the ones who made the joke,
2483420	2485020	the oven just got bigger,
2485020	2488940	which is a telling mix of their rhetoric with that of Donald Trump there.
2489500	2493580	And I'd like to contrast a couple of particular clips from their video.
2493580	2494780	So here's the first one.
2494780	2507500	So that's the typical deflection offered by far-right groups
2507500	2509100	when they're called Nazis, you know.
2509100	2511100	Nazis don't exist anymore.
2511100	2513980	They haven't existed since the 1930s.
2513980	2518140	It's a childish attempt at using semantics to dodge the charge,
2518700	2519900	it's very silly.
2519900	2524300	So that was them talking to anti-fascist demonstrators outside the rally.
2524300	2528540	And the clip I'd like to contrast that with is from later on inside the rally.
2528540	2531660	The alt-right Discord stream happened to catch a speech
2531660	2535660	being given in front of the Daily Stormer banner I showed earlier.
2535660	2536780	Do you remember that?
2536780	2537740	Let's take a listen.
2538460	2540460	Didn't hit my journey, people!
2540460	2541660	No!
2541660	2542460	Fuck this.
2543500	2543980	Yeah!
2559100	2561260	I love my people!
2561260	2562460	Yeah!
2567740	2575100	One more, one more.
2575100	2578140	I want everybody to take close attention
2578140	2584060	because this is the first preset of the true alt-right.
2584940	2585740	Remember it.
2586940	2589260	Gas the kites race!
2589260	2593260	Gas the kites race!
2598540	2600540	Yeah!
2600540	2601580	Who brought the ovens?
2603500	2606220	And that's how they talk inside the rally.
2606220	2610300	In front of a banner that says end Jewish control over America,
2610300	2611020	they chant,
2611020	2612460	Hitler did nothing wrong.
2613180	2615420	Gas the racial slurs.
2615980	2617500	Race war now.
2617500	2621260	And I'd like to note the complete lack of dissent in this clip.
2621260	2623900	Everybody present joins in and applauds.
2623900	2626060	People shout Sieg Heil.
2626060	2629980	They're all, to a man, completely on board with this happening.
2629980	2632460	Not one person attempts to break ranks.
2633020	2634060	And that's how it goes.
2634620	2638220	Outward facing, the rally attendees will talk about free speech,
2638220	2641340	say they're non-violent, they disavow Nazism,
2641340	2644300	they'll claim there aren't any more Nazis, even.
2644300	2647500	But inside, they're chanting Nazi slogans,
2647500	2649420	and wearing Nazi iconography,
2649420	2652700	and waving Nazi flags, praising Hitler,
2652700	2657420	talking about gassing Jewish people, throwing Hitler salutes and shouting Sieg Heil.
2657980	2661180	These people here are neo-Nazis.
2662060	2663820	I think we can all agree.
2663820	2668060	But does this mean that all the people at the rally were therefore neo-Nazis?
2668860	2671740	Opinions are divided, but the answer is yes.
2672860	2675180	Or, you know, is that fair?
2675180	2676300	I don't know.
2676300	2680300	In my opinion, if you're willing to walk under a Nazi flag with a bunch of Nazis
2680300	2683420	and make no effort to disagree with them or counter the things they say,
2684060	2685660	then you're a Nazi.
2685660	2688860	If I went to a Liverpool match wearing a Liverpool kit,
2688860	2691180	and stood singing You'll Never Walk Alone
2691180	2694860	with all the other Liverpool supporters under a big LFC banner,
2694860	2700300	it would be reasonable to assume I was a supporter of Liverpool Football Club.
2700300	2705820	But oh no, I could say, you know, I'm not really a Liverpool supporter, in my mind.
2705820	2709580	I just really look like one, do all the same things they do.
2709580	2711100	You know, give me a break.
2711100	2713020	We know what these people are.
2713020	2718860	Anyone who wasn't a Nazi would have turned and left the first time they saw a swastika flag.
2718860	2722540	Still though, some people will insist it's all just a joke.
2722540	2727500	Such as this chap who got surrounded by counter protesters and stripped off his clothes,
2727500	2731260	saying he's not really a racist, he's just there for a bit of fun.
2731260	2735260	Now, I'd argue that this doesn't really matter, to be honest.
2735260	2738700	But for those who think it does, how do we tell the difference?
2739580	2741500	The difference between the, quote,
2741500	2745900	real racists and the ones supposedly just there for a bit of a laugh, that is.
2746540	2751100	Well, the only way to tell the difference for sure is in their reactions to events
2751100	2755580	like the murders committed by Dylann Roof and James Alex Fields.
2755580	2759740	Once the ideology goes beyond words and becomes action,
2759740	2764220	fatal action at that, you can no longer claim it's just a joke.
2764220	2766060	You are all in at that point.
2766700	2772220	And with that in mind, let's take a look at a few of the reactions to James Alex Fields' car attack.
2772220	2777740	First up is James Allsup's response to the terror attack from his Truth About Charlottesville video.
2779900	2783100	Oh, wait, no it isn't, because he doesn't mention it.
2783100	2789260	Beyond one passing reference to the car crash, a rather neutral phrasing for a murder there.
2789900	2793260	So that's Allsup's approach, you know, just pretend it didn't happen.
2793900	2798140	He elsewhere claims that all the violence came from the counter-protesters,
2798140	2802460	which I guess is an easy stance to take if you're able to tune out a terror attack
2802460	2804380	originating on your side.
2804380	2807580	You know, if we don't look at it, it didn't happen, I guess.
2807580	2811020	That's the media-savvy alt-right tactic there.
2811020	2816300	Now the other alt-right tactic is to defame the victim, Heather Heyer.
2816300	2820940	Jason Kessler, who early predicted the rally attendees would be non-violent,
2820940	2822220	tweeted out,
2827900	2831900	And he's sharing there a Daily Stormer article which says,
2843420	2848540	Christopher Cantwell was, of course, his usual charming self about the whole affair.
2848540	2853580	The fact that nobody on our side died, I'd go ahead and call that points for us.
2854620	2860300	The fact that none of our people killed anybody unjustly, I think, is a plus for us.
2861260	2864300	Matthew Heimbach also approached reporters to say,
2869100	2873740	So this is what happens when things escalate beyond speech and someone is murdered.
2873740	2878060	They don't disavow the murderer, they rally around them and defend.
2878060	2881740	And there was, of course, also a conspiracy theory
2881740	2884700	that Heather Heyer was not hit by the car at all
2884700	2891420	and instead, coincidentally, died of a heart attack nearby at around the same time.
2891420	2895100	Of course, this ignores both that her death was ruled a homicide
2895100	2897900	and that the medical examiner's office in Richmond, Virginia,
2897900	2901820	determined that Heyer's cause of death was blunt force trauma to the torso.
2902380	2907180	Regardless of the truth, however, the heart attack lie persisted.
2907180	2913020	In neo-Nazi circles, obviously, but also among those seemingly with Nazi sympathies.
2937180	2963020	That's white supremacist millennial woes there, talking to YouTube personality Sargon of Akkad,
2963020	2968540	who is, as usual, mindlessly repeating whatever rubbish he's overheard Nazis say.
2969100	2971900	Is that a random jab at Sargon from me there?
2972540	2973660	Well, a little bit.
2973660	2976380	But I do think there's an important point to be made here
2976380	2981580	about how easily white nationalist lies can spread among the lazy and uneducated.
2982220	2987260	I mention it here because James Field's trial is scheduled for later this year
2987260	2991180	and all the alt-right's lies and deformations will be brought out again.
2991820	2995820	They will lie about the nature of those present at the Charlottesville rally.
2995820	2997900	They will lie about James Fields.
2997900	3000700	They will lie about how Heather Heyer died.
3000700	3004700	And we need to be vigilant in checking and correcting those lies,
3004700	3009580	lest we end up as witless Nazi stooges just like Sargon of Akkad.
3009580	3012140	So that's about it for me today, folks.
3012140	3014700	But I'd like to wrap up with a final thought here.
3015260	3017820	James Allsup, in his Unite the Right video,
3018380	3024460	rather hilariously predicts that Charlottesville would be seen as a PR victory for the alt-right.
3025420	3026700	But where are we today?
3027500	3030860	Well, the alt-right are in disarray, I'm happy to say.
3031420	3035580	Richard Spencer recently posted a video calling off his college tour,
3035580	3038220	citing heavy resistance by anti-fascists
3038220	3042780	as the main reason why he's barely able to draw a double-digit crowd anymore.
3042780	3046860	He also acknowledges Charlottesville as the turning point in the movement,
3046860	3051340	and one can read between the lines and see what he wanted out of Unite the Right.
3051340	3055660	The far right would turn up, pretend to be peaceful, get attacked,
3055660	3058060	and then play it up and act the victim.
3058060	3061660	James Fields ruined that narrative for them, of course.
3061660	3066380	Alt-right figures found instead their Twitter and YouTube accounts being shut down,
3066380	3069340	their web hosting taking their websites offline,
3069340	3071740	their Discord servers being deleted,
3071740	3073980	and the size of the anti-fascist crowds
3073980	3076940	turning out to meet them at their rallies and speeches increasing.
3077580	3080860	Charlottesville exposed them for what they really are,
3080860	3083660	a group of cowardly Nazi thugs.
3083660	3086300	They overestimated their broader support,
3086300	3088140	they overplayed their hand,
3088140	3088860	and they lost.
3089580	3092860	However, this is a somewhat hollow victory,
3092860	3097820	in particular because it took someone being killed in order to turn the tide,
3098460	3101500	and also because we can be sure that the alt-right,
3101500	3107020	neo-Nazis, white nationalists, identitarians, whatever you want to call them,
3107660	3110220	they will lick their wounds and resurface.
3110780	3112460	They will try all this again.
3113020	3116380	So what we need to do is remember who these people are,
3116380	3118300	remember what they stand for,
3118300	3121420	and remember what they do when given a chance.
3121420	3126700	I titled this video the true alt-right because of that particular clip from earlier,
3126700	3132300	in which the speaker urges the crowd to remember the first precept of the true alt-right.
3138940	3142460	And this is exactly how we should remember these people, too.
3143020	3145100	Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.
3145100	3147580	Sorry about the delay getting this video out there.
3147580	3150620	It was a bit of a monster to make, as I'm sure you can imagine,
3150620	3154060	and I got rather sick right in the middle of editing it, which was just terrible.
3154700	3160060	If you feel sorry enough for me and you'd like to see more videos like this or the others on my channel,
3160060	3163260	you can head over to Patreon and send me a dollar or two.
3163260	3168780	And thank you again to all my supporters whose generosity makes it possible for me to keep doing this.
3168780	3172460	You can also follow me on Twitter or send me a question on Curious Cat.
3172460	3174300	I'll put those links below.
3174300	3176220	And as a note here at the end,
3176220	3181260	I half expect this video to possibly be flagged down with a series of false reports.
3181260	3184780	There's obviously several points in it where you could clip someone out of context
3184780	3188700	saying something horrible and then report it to YouTube's algorithm.
3188700	3191980	And I'll take it as a point of pride if it does get flagged down, of course,
3191980	3195260	because it would be far-right chumps flagging their own hate speech.
3195820	3198700	Regardless, if it does get taken down,
3198700	3201900	feel free to mirror this video on whatever platform you like.
3202460	3205500	Mirroring flagged videos has proven to be an excellent counter
3205500	3208940	to the far-right tactic of false flagging criticism.
3208940	3212700	So if it does happen, you're more than welcome to re-host it.
3212700	3214140	Okay, thanks folks.
3214140	3216940	That's all from me today, and I'll see you next time.
