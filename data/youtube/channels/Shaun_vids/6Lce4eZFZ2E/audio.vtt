00:00.000 --> 00:06.320
Hello, everyone. Just a quick video today, but it's a bit of an odd one, so allow me to explain.

00:06.540 --> 00:14.640
And I have to talk about myself a little bit here, so apologies. I did try to write around that, I promise, but it was impossible.

00:15.180 --> 00:20.740
Now, when I started out on YouTube, I was just making rather mediocre, honestly,

00:21.000 --> 00:27.840
Let's Plays with my friend Jen for something to do, and that's what I thought YouTube was for, really.

00:27.840 --> 00:33.440
But Minecraft videos, catch jumping into boxes, and rally crash compilations,

00:34.240 --> 00:39.840
Why would you stand on the corner at a rally? Why are they standing on the corners?

00:40.160 --> 00:40.800
Oh, God.

00:41.360 --> 00:49.760
I didn't really have a clue about any of this political stuff that was going on on YouTube, you know, all of these new media personalities,

00:49.760 --> 00:56.800
or whatever else they like to call themselves, you know, instead of what they actually are, which is someone with a blog.

00:57.600 --> 01:00.640
Someone with a blog who takes it way too seriously.

01:01.360 --> 01:03.840
Of which I am one now, I suppose.

01:04.320 --> 01:11.280
But back when I made the switch from making fun videos to depressing videos, it's fair to say I was a little behind the times.

01:11.760 --> 01:15.600
You see, what I was aware of were the atheist YouTubers in the

01:15.840 --> 01:22.000
were-geniuses-by-virtue-of-knowing-the-earth-is-round vein, like Thunderf00t and TheAmazingAtheist.

01:22.240 --> 01:27.360
And I incorrectly assumed they were still the big fish in the YouTube pond.

01:27.840 --> 01:34.160
Not so anymore, of course. These days, there's a lot of other fish people are watching.

01:34.640 --> 01:40.800
For example, the likes of amateur ufologist and 9-11 truther, Sarkad of Akkad,

01:41.360 --> 01:44.240
Brain pill salesman, Paul Joseph Watson,

01:44.640 --> 01:49.280
that guy whose avatar is like something unusual wearing a suit.

01:50.080 --> 01:52.560
You know the guy. The name escapes me right now.

01:53.120 --> 01:57.360
A Canadian who complains about immigrants despite being one,

01:57.840 --> 02:03.840
the world's greatest living philosopher, Stefan Molyneux, Laura Loomer, and Boxxy.

02:04.320 --> 02:09.600
But I didn't know all that back then, of course, so I decided to make a video about TheAmazingAtheist,

02:09.600 --> 02:12.400
which, if you go and check, isn't there anymore.

02:12.800 --> 02:18.080
You see, making that video, I was still kind of finding my feet somewhat and working out an approach

02:18.480 --> 02:23.760
and all that, and it's no excuse, really, but I said some pretty rude personal things about TJ,

02:23.760 --> 02:28.800
which was a mistake and something I felt uncomfortable with afterwards and sorry about,

02:28.800 --> 02:30.480
so I deleted the video.

02:30.480 --> 02:36.080
I basically attributed TJ's rather racist and offensive views featured in that video

02:36.080 --> 02:40.800
to him being mentally ill, which was unfair not only to him but also, you know,

02:40.800 --> 02:44.480
all the other people who struggle with various mental illnesses without being

02:44.480 --> 02:48.560
racist or terrible people, so I apologize for that.

02:48.560 --> 02:52.880
And I'm grateful, in a sense, that I made that mistake and learned from it

02:52.880 --> 02:55.760
while my channel and audience were still fairly small.

02:55.760 --> 02:58.240
I kind of snuck that one under the radar there.

02:58.960 --> 03:02.240
There were a couple of downsides to deleting that video, though.

03:02.240 --> 03:06.400
The first is that besides being unfairly rude about TJ personally,

03:06.400 --> 03:09.200
I did catch him out on something particularly funny.

03:09.840 --> 03:12.800
The other downside is that ever since I deleted that video,

03:12.800 --> 03:15.120
I've had people asking me if they can see it.

03:15.120 --> 03:18.800
You know, look at all these curious cat questions I have backed up there.

03:18.800 --> 03:23.280
About a tenth of those are about this Amazing Atheist video.

03:23.280 --> 03:25.520
So here you go, folks.

03:25.520 --> 03:29.760
Here's the funny thing I caught TJ out on, and once I've explained this,

03:30.480 --> 03:33.120
hopefully you can all leave me alone about it.

03:33.120 --> 03:35.760
So something I'm going to touch on in my next video

03:35.760 --> 03:39.520
is how starved for material anti-feminist YouTube is,

03:39.520 --> 03:42.560
and you can tell this mainly because they all make the same videos

03:42.560 --> 03:43.840
covering the same topics.

03:44.640 --> 03:49.200
For example, when our old pal Milo Stewart made a bit of a clumsy video

03:49.200 --> 03:52.640
where they explained what they'd learned about subconscious biases,

03:53.280 --> 03:57.920
anti-feminist YouTube pounced and all made the exact same response video

03:57.920 --> 03:59.200
crowing about it.

03:59.200 --> 04:03.280
A young trans person saying something that's easy to clip out of context

04:03.280 --> 04:08.160
was a much-needed gulp of air for that overcrowded, asphyxiating rat cage.

04:09.520 --> 04:14.000
Anyway, one such hack desperate for material was the Amazing Atheist

04:14.000 --> 04:18.080
who made a video entitled Transgender Bigots Hate Speech,

04:18.080 --> 04:19.840
and my video was a response to that.

04:20.560 --> 04:23.520
I was originally going to remake the video in its entirety,

04:23.520 --> 04:25.840
but actually most of it holds up pretty well,

04:25.840 --> 04:30.720
so I'll just include an edited version here following these disclaimers.

04:30.720 --> 04:34.880
So I've excised the regrettable personal insults directed at TJ

04:34.880 --> 04:38.800
from the following clips, but I haven't re-recorded the audio,

04:38.800 --> 04:41.200
and it's a little bit different from how I do it now.

04:42.080 --> 04:45.440
First of all, if you think I speak slowly now,

04:45.440 --> 04:47.120
wait until you get a load of this.

04:47.120 --> 04:51.200
My delivery has definitely improved over the last year, I'd say, watching this.

04:52.480 --> 04:56.160
Secondly, I still call TJ an idiot at one point,

04:56.160 --> 05:00.400
and that word and other words like stupid or moron, for instance,

05:00.400 --> 05:04.160
are things I'm trying more often to avoid lately.

05:04.880 --> 05:09.040
Uh, attributing deliberate actions to just unintelligence

05:09.040 --> 05:11.600
is something that started sitting kinda wrong with me.

05:11.600 --> 05:17.760
I feel like it can erase responsibility and agency in kind of an irresponsible manner.

05:17.760 --> 05:21.360
You know, it kinda lets people off the hook when they do something maliciously

05:21.360 --> 05:23.520
to just chalk it up to idiocy.

05:23.520 --> 05:26.800
So that's something I try to avoid these days.

05:26.800 --> 05:31.600
I also at one point refer to the trans lifestyle, I think I say,

05:31.600 --> 05:37.040
which is honestly just a bit of lazy scripting that would not make it into a video these days,

05:37.040 --> 05:40.080
because it makes it sound kinda trivial in context,

05:40.080 --> 05:45.920
the word lifestyle being more usually associated with choice, as in lifestyle choice,

05:45.920 --> 05:48.880
like deciding to reduce your carb intake or something.

05:49.440 --> 05:53.120
Again, not much of an excuse, but I didn't really have many viewers back then,

05:53.120 --> 05:56.320
and I didn't take as much care with my language as I try to now.

05:57.360 --> 06:00.080
And instead of correcting these errors, I thought I'd leave them in

06:00.080 --> 06:02.880
so I could make these points about how my approach has changed

06:02.880 --> 06:06.800
and how I'm thinking about my language more and trying to be better with it.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.000
With that out the way, here you go.

06:10.960 --> 06:13.360
So anyway, let's get to TJ's arguments.

06:13.920 --> 06:18.480
And I'll give a short summary of the section of Milo's video TJ is responding to,

06:18.480 --> 06:22.800
we'll watch his response, and then we'll respond to his response.

06:22.800 --> 06:23.300
What fun.

06:24.180 --> 06:25.700
So Milo says,

06:25.700 --> 06:31.700
All members of a majority are biased against the members of the minority or oppressed group.

06:32.580 --> 06:34.260
And TJ responds,

06:34.260 --> 06:39.140
The minority is always oppressed by the majority,

06:39.140 --> 06:47.700
just like the 0.1% richest people are all oppressed by the 99% poorest people.

06:47.700 --> 06:50.420
That's how that works, right? Oh yeah!

06:51.300 --> 06:56.900
Now, where TJ's went wrong there is that he's only thinking of the minority and the majority

06:56.900 --> 06:59.220
in a strictly numeric sense.

06:59.220 --> 07:02.820
He's only considering the mathematical use of the words.

07:02.820 --> 07:04.900
And when we're talking about societies,

07:04.900 --> 07:10.980
the minority refers to a group that has a minority of that society's power.

07:11.540 --> 07:17.380
For instance, black people in the United States are both a statistical and social minority.

07:18.020 --> 07:22.100
Women, on the other hand, are a statistical majority,

07:22.100 --> 07:24.980
but still considered a social minority,

07:24.980 --> 07:30.500
because compared to men, they hold a minority of power, influence, and privilege.

07:30.500 --> 07:34.660
In TJ's example, the rich are a statistical minority,

07:34.660 --> 07:39.940
but they're not a social minority because they have a majority of the power.

07:39.940 --> 07:40.440
Yeah?

07:41.220 --> 07:41.720
Yeah.

07:42.520 --> 07:43.720
Milo says,

07:43.720 --> 07:48.840
Imperialism created cisnormativity and heteronormativity.

07:48.840 --> 07:50.440
And TJ responds,

07:50.440 --> 07:56.680
Then why have these been the norm in every human culture that we've ever heard about?

07:57.400 --> 07:59.320
Now, I'll interrupt TJ there.

07:59.320 --> 08:02.360
My understanding of the word heteronormativity

08:02.360 --> 08:08.920
is the belief that heterosexuality is the only normal or natural sexual orientation.

08:08.920 --> 08:15.480
And TJ says that this applies to all human cultures that we have ever heard about.

08:15.480 --> 08:21.000
So all we have to do to disprove this point is name one human society ever

08:21.640 --> 08:27.160
that considered same-sex sexual relations a normal part of life.

08:27.160 --> 08:29.880
And one obvious one should immediately spring to mind.

08:30.520 --> 08:33.880
And now, I don't actually know too much about ancient Greece.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.880
I'm more of an ancient Rome guy.

08:35.880 --> 08:42.200
And the Romans had an interesting attitude towards what we would call homosexuality.

08:42.200 --> 08:47.880
You see, the Romans didn't see things in terms of our modern notions of gay and straight.

08:47.880 --> 08:52.200
They looked at sexual relations as either active or passive.

08:52.200 --> 08:56.200
You know, a Roman man could have sex with other men without stigma

08:56.200 --> 09:00.520
so long as he was considered the dominant partner in the relationship.

09:00.520 --> 09:05.000
And all British schoolchildren will at some point learn about Hadrian's Wall,

09:05.000 --> 09:06.920
which was built by Emperor Hadrian.

09:07.720 --> 09:13.400
And he loved everything Greek and was what we would consider to be an openly gay man.

09:14.040 --> 09:19.400
Not every culture has had the same attitude towards sexual orientations.

09:19.400 --> 09:24.040
They haven't even had the same definitions of sexual orientations.

09:24.040 --> 09:29.080
And since Milo specifically mentioned imperialism, the point's obvious.

09:29.080 --> 09:34.120
There were lots of different cultures with a lot of different attitudes towards sex and gender.

09:34.120 --> 09:37.560
And then as empires spread and took over those territories,

09:37.560 --> 09:40.680
they impose their understanding of what's normal.

09:41.240 --> 09:43.800
So either TJ has never heard of ancient Greece,

09:43.800 --> 09:48.920
or he's misunderstood Milo's point and is actually arguing against something else.

09:48.920 --> 09:53.720
And if we watch the second part of TJ's response, we'll see that this is, in fact, the case.

09:54.280 --> 09:55.800
Hell, why is this the norm?

09:56.600 --> 10:02.920
In animal cultures, a male lion is different than a female lion.

10:03.480 --> 10:07.000
Not only physically, but in their roles.

10:08.040 --> 10:11.320
You know, a male gorilla is different than a female gorilla.

10:11.320 --> 10:16.600
Not just in terms of their physicality, but in terms of their roles in gorilla society.

10:16.600 --> 10:21.400
And you can go all the way down the evolutionary line to most species that sexually reproduce,

10:21.400 --> 10:26.120
and you're going to find that there are delineated roles for the genders.

10:26.840 --> 10:29.560
So it's not some human construct.

10:29.560 --> 10:31.400
It's not, ooh, imperialism!

10:32.280 --> 10:37.560
You see, Milo said imperialism created cisnormativity and heteronormativity.

10:38.280 --> 10:40.840
What TJ is arguing against is this.

10:41.480 --> 10:45.160
Imperialism created the concept of gender roles,

10:45.160 --> 10:48.040
and that's why he started talking about animals.

10:48.040 --> 10:54.040
You see, cisnormativity and heteronormativity are to do with societal attitudes towards things,

10:54.040 --> 10:57.240
and they can't really be translated into the animal kingdom,

10:57.800 --> 11:02.120
because non-human animals aren't capable of having opinions.

11:02.760 --> 11:05.240
So even though TJ got the wrong end of the stick

11:05.240 --> 11:09.240
and is arguing against something that Milo didn't actually say,

11:09.240 --> 11:11.400
let's briefly address his point anyway.

11:11.400 --> 11:13.240
So to start with, TJ is right.

11:13.240 --> 11:16.840
Animals do have physical differences between males and females,

11:16.840 --> 11:20.680
and males and females do often serve different roles.

11:20.680 --> 11:24.440
Now what he missed is that these roles are capable of change.

11:25.080 --> 11:26.840
They're not set in stone.

11:26.840 --> 11:31.320
You know, lots of different animals have evolved in a lot of interesting ways.

11:31.320 --> 11:33.080
And we know the obvious ones.

11:33.080 --> 11:35.480
Male seahorses give birth.

11:35.480 --> 11:40.280
A clownfish can change from male to female should the need arise.

11:40.280 --> 11:42.600
And now I know someone's sitting there saying,

11:42.600 --> 11:47.160
ah, TJ didn't mention fish or insects or anything, he mentioned mammals.

11:47.720 --> 11:51.240
A male lion is different than a female lion.

11:51.800 --> 11:55.240
Not only physically, but in their roles.

11:56.200 --> 11:58.680
So, okay, let's look at lions, you know.

11:58.680 --> 12:03.080
There's clearly a physical difference between male and female lions.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.720
For instance, here's a picture of a male lion.

12:06.280 --> 12:09.240
No it isn't, it's a picture of a female lion.

12:09.240 --> 12:12.120
Now apparently some female lions are growing manes

12:12.120 --> 12:16.520
and taking on the traditionally male role of frightening away competitors.

12:16.520 --> 12:18.120
Gender fluid lions, eh?

12:18.680 --> 12:19.180
Who knew?

12:20.200 --> 12:23.480
Milo says he mainly talks about western societies

12:23.560 --> 12:26.680
because that's what he personally has experience of.

12:27.560 --> 12:28.760
And TJ responds.

12:29.320 --> 12:32.280
Yeah, well, maybe you should visit those other societies

12:32.280 --> 12:34.840
just so you have a better basis of understanding.

12:34.840 --> 12:37.800
In western culture, here's how the conversation goes.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.880
Hey guys, I may appear female,

12:39.880 --> 12:44.760
but I am in fact a non-binary trans person who prefers male pronouns.

12:44.760 --> 12:46.520
Some of us do not agree.

12:46.520 --> 12:48.040
I am oppressed!

12:48.040 --> 12:48.540
Ah!

12:48.540 --> 12:56.220
And wouldn't it be nice if the worst that western trans people had to face was polite disagreement?

12:56.220 --> 13:02.060
Now I'm not going to go through a bunch of news reports about murdered and abused trans people

13:02.060 --> 13:06.300
just to prove a point to an idiot in a YouTube video.

13:06.300 --> 13:12.220
You can google transgender hate crimes on your own time if you feel like depressing yourself.

13:12.220 --> 13:14.860
But even aside from the horrible violent stuff,

13:14.860 --> 13:19.420
there's still a lot of institutional bias against trans people in the west.

13:19.420 --> 13:25.020
There's still a lot of trans people living in states or countries without equal legal protections,

13:25.580 --> 13:31.340
and a lot of places don't count trans people as a protected group under hate crime legislation.

13:31.340 --> 13:36.460
And of course, trans people still have little direct representation in government.

13:36.460 --> 13:39.660
You see, TJ, sometimes the people who say,

13:40.220 --> 13:43.340
I do not agree, go on to say,

13:49.580 --> 13:53.100
You know, pretending that the worst trans people have to deal with

13:53.100 --> 13:56.860
is some people politely not agreeing with their lifestyle,

13:56.860 --> 13:59.020
that itself is transphobic.

13:59.020 --> 14:01.260
You know, by my estimate anyway.

14:01.820 --> 14:08.380
So let's watch the rest of TJ's response, and fair warning, it's about to get a little weird.

14:08.460 --> 14:10.540
Meanwhile, in Middle Eastern society,

14:10.540 --> 14:16.460
Hey guys, I may appear female, but I am in fact a non-binary trans person who prefers male pronouns!

14:16.460 --> 14:18.140
Behead the infidel!

14:18.140 --> 14:22.300
But first, let us rape her to remind her that she is female!

14:22.300 --> 14:23.580
African society,

14:23.580 --> 14:29.260
Hey guys, I may appear female, but I am in fact a non-binary trans person who prefers male pronouns!

14:29.980 --> 14:32.860
She is a witch! She eats at a poo-poo!

14:32.860 --> 14:35.740
Let's chop her up into pieces, then burn the pieces!

14:36.700 --> 14:42.380
So, it'd be easy to just dismiss that bit as nothing but lazy racist jokes

14:42.380 --> 14:44.220
made by a lazy racist man.

14:44.940 --> 14:46.060
Because that's what it was.

14:46.700 --> 14:48.860
But let's talk about it anyway.

14:48.860 --> 14:51.020
So first off, I'm white.

14:51.660 --> 14:55.660
And if I were trying to disprove that all white people were racist,

14:56.460 --> 15:01.500
my first priority would be to ensure that while I was arguing my case,

15:01.500 --> 15:05.100
I didn't start doing a bunch of racist impressions.

15:06.060 --> 15:08.860
TJ really fell at the first hurdle there.

15:09.420 --> 15:11.660
So I've been making videos for a while now,

15:11.660 --> 15:16.620
and one thing that happens is you start to notice certain things in other people's videos

15:16.620 --> 15:19.260
that maybe you didn't pay attention to before.

15:19.260 --> 15:23.420
You know, for instance, before I went through the process of making videos myself,

15:23.420 --> 15:27.340
I never used to notice or think about stray frames.

15:27.340 --> 15:29.660
And there's one earlier in TJ's video.

15:29.660 --> 15:31.820
It's right... here.

15:31.820 --> 15:34.780
And that happens when you make a cut at the wrong time,

15:34.860 --> 15:38.540
and accidentally leave in one or two frames that shouldn't be there.

15:38.540 --> 15:40.780
And I'm certainly guilty of that too.

15:40.780 --> 15:45.180
And I'm also thinking more about how certain visuals are created.

15:45.180 --> 15:47.900
You know, for those of you that don't make videos,

15:47.900 --> 15:52.940
I want you to go through the process of how you'd go about creating this image.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.500
So let's think it through, okay.

15:55.500 --> 16:01.180
You're a lazy racist, and you want to do a lazy racist impression of some African men.

16:01.740 --> 16:06.460
Now first things first, you need a photograph of some African men.

16:06.460 --> 16:07.580
So what do you do?

16:07.580 --> 16:13.100
You go to Google image search, you type in African men, and it's right there.

16:13.100 --> 16:14.300
And I'm not kidding.

16:14.300 --> 16:19.340
When I decided to find this image, it took me approximately four seconds.

16:19.340 --> 16:21.340
That's how lazy TJ is.

16:21.900 --> 16:24.540
Now because you're a lazy racist, you don't think,

16:25.180 --> 16:27.900
I wonder who these people actually are.

16:29.180 --> 16:30.940
Where did this image come from?

16:31.980 --> 16:36.940
Are the people in the image anything at all, like my stereotype?

16:36.940 --> 16:37.740
Who cares, right?

16:37.740 --> 16:41.020
You just download the image, you shove it in your video, and you're good to go.

16:41.740 --> 16:45.900
However, and I realize I have a somewhat monotone voice,

16:45.900 --> 16:49.100
but what you're hearing right now is excitement.

16:49.100 --> 16:52.060
If we click on the image, we can see where it came from.

16:52.780 --> 16:56.620
And excuse my language, it's a fucking screencap

16:56.620 --> 17:01.260
from a YouTube video about stereotypes of African men.

17:01.260 --> 17:03.180
I shit you not.

17:03.180 --> 17:04.940
We are likeable and friendly guys.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.620
And we are even on Facebook.

17:07.180 --> 17:09.340
We are more than a stereotype.

17:09.340 --> 17:10.620
Let's change the perception.

17:16.940 --> 17:17.580
TJ?

17:18.860 --> 17:20.060
You dumb fuck.

17:20.060 --> 17:23.020
There are a bunch of university students talking about

17:23.020 --> 17:26.220
how they're stereotyped as violent and stupid.

17:26.940 --> 17:28.300
And what did you say?

17:28.300 --> 17:29.580
She is a witch!

17:29.580 --> 17:31.100
She eats at a poo-poo!

17:31.100 --> 17:33.980
Let's chop her up into pieces, then burn the pieces!

17:38.380 --> 17:40.460
But you don't really think of us that way, do you?

17:42.380 --> 17:45.660
Oh, I'm sorry, seemingly friendly African man.

17:45.660 --> 17:49.820
Apparently we do think of you that way, because we're racist.

17:49.820 --> 17:53.500
And too lazy to do even the bare minimum amount of research.

17:54.300 --> 17:57.740
Maybe making fun of TJ is shooting fish in a barrel.

17:58.300 --> 17:59.100
He's a joke.

17:59.660 --> 18:00.620
Obviously.

18:00.620 --> 18:01.660
I get it.

18:01.660 --> 18:04.620
But the person who told me to take a look at this video

18:04.620 --> 18:08.540
described the amazing atheist as not that mean,

18:09.180 --> 18:10.860
and as having a brain.

18:11.500 --> 18:14.700
And I'm sorry, I am not seeing that here.

18:14.700 --> 18:18.620
You know, just because someone presents as rational and intelligent

18:18.620 --> 18:19.740
doesn't mean they are.

18:20.380 --> 18:24.060
And to be honest, sometimes shooting fish in a barrel's just fun.

18:24.620 --> 18:27.100
And even if he is a joke, there's enough people out there

18:27.100 --> 18:29.500
who think he isn't a joke that he's worth correcting.

18:30.140 --> 18:32.460
You know, you only have to look at his YouTube comments

18:32.460 --> 18:38.700
to see people agreeing with his incorrect, lazy, racist opinions.

18:38.700 --> 18:41.100
Speaking of looking at his YouTube comments,

18:41.100 --> 18:44.220
and would you believe it, people are still saying this.

18:44.940 --> 18:46.380
They're still saying that.

18:46.380 --> 18:48.140
You know the really sad thing here?

18:48.140 --> 18:51.900
TJ actually included a clip of Milo calling himself racist,

18:52.540 --> 18:58.620
which means the people commenting this here didn't watch Milo's video or TJ's response.

18:58.620 --> 19:02.300
So it looks like TJ's fans are dumber than Leafy's fans even,

19:02.300 --> 19:05.020
which, quite the accomplishment, lads.

19:05.900 --> 19:06.540
Well done.

19:07.500 --> 19:08.860
So there you go, folks.

19:08.860 --> 19:10.700
Apologies about my language again.

19:10.700 --> 19:13.500
It's an evolving process, this video thing,

19:13.500 --> 19:16.460
and I'm sure a year down the line I'll probably be apologizing

19:16.460 --> 19:18.140
about something I said in this video.

19:18.780 --> 19:21.740
Thanks as always to my supporters over on Patreon.

19:21.740 --> 19:24.620
This video was a reward for hitting a new tier on there.

19:25.180 --> 19:29.020
The other reward for hitting that tier is a 24-hour live stream

19:29.020 --> 19:31.580
of the very good computer game Bad Rats,

19:31.580 --> 19:34.860
which will be taking place next month around Christmas time.

19:35.580 --> 19:39.340
Any donations I receive during that stream will be going to charity.

19:39.340 --> 19:42.300
Now, I don't actually know a good charity for this sort of thing,

19:43.180 --> 19:45.260
so please send me a message on Curious Cat

19:45.260 --> 19:47.020
if you have any advice there.

19:47.020 --> 19:49.260
And head over and check out my Patreon if you like,

19:49.260 --> 19:52.380
because some new gold rewards will be going up fairly soon.

19:52.380 --> 19:53.580
How exciting.

19:53.580 --> 19:56.140
Anyway, thanks a lot, folks, and I'll see you next time.
