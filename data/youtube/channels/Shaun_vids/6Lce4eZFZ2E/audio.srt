00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
Hello, everyone. Just a quick video today, but it's a bit of an odd one, so allow me to explain.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:14,640
And I have to talk about myself a little bit here, so apologies. I did try to write around that, I promise, but it was impossible.

3
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:20,740
Now, when I started out on YouTube, I was just making rather mediocre, honestly,

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,840
Let's Plays with my friend Jen for something to do, and that's what I thought YouTube was for, really.

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,440
But Minecraft videos, catch jumping into boxes, and rally crash compilations,

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,840
Why would you stand on the corner at a rally? Why are they standing on the corners?

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:40,800
Oh, God.

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:49,760
I didn't really have a clue about any of this political stuff that was going on on YouTube, you know, all of these new media personalities,

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,800
or whatever else they like to call themselves, you know, instead of what they actually are, which is someone with a blog.

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,640
Someone with a blog who takes it way too seriously.

11
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,840
Of which I am one now, I suppose.

12
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:11,280
But back when I made the switch from making fun videos to depressing videos, it's fair to say I was a little behind the times.

13
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,600
You see, what I was aware of were the atheist YouTubers in the

14
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,000
were-geniuses-by-virtue-of-knowing-the-earth-is-round vein, like Thunderf00t and TheAmazingAtheist.

15
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,360
And I incorrectly assumed they were still the big fish in the YouTube pond.

16
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,160
Not so anymore, of course. These days, there's a lot of other fish people are watching.

17
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,800
For example, the likes of amateur ufologist and 9-11 truther, Sarkad of Akkad,

18
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,240
Brain pill salesman, Paul Joseph Watson,

19
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,280
that guy whose avatar is like something unusual wearing a suit.

20
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,560
You know the guy. The name escapes me right now.

21
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,360
A Canadian who complains about immigrants despite being one,

22
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,840
the world's greatest living philosopher, Stefan Molyneux, Laura Loomer, and Boxxy.

23
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,600
But I didn't know all that back then, of course, so I decided to make a video about TheAmazingAtheist,

24
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,400
which, if you go and check, isn't there anymore.

25
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,080
You see, making that video, I was still kind of finding my feet somewhat and working out an approach

26
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,760
and all that, and it's no excuse, really, but I said some pretty rude personal things about TJ,

27
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,800
which was a mistake and something I felt uncomfortable with afterwards and sorry about,

28
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,480
so I deleted the video.

29
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,080
I basically attributed TJ's rather racist and offensive views featured in that video

30
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,800
to him being mentally ill, which was unfair not only to him but also, you know,

31
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,480
all the other people who struggle with various mental illnesses without being

32
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,560
racist or terrible people, so I apologize for that.

33
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,880
And I'm grateful, in a sense, that I made that mistake and learned from it

34
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,760
while my channel and audience were still fairly small.

35
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,240
I kind of snuck that one under the radar there.

36
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,240
There were a couple of downsides to deleting that video, though.

37
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,400
The first is that besides being unfairly rude about TJ personally,

38
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,200
I did catch him out on something particularly funny.

39
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,800
The other downside is that ever since I deleted that video,

40
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,120
I've had people asking me if they can see it.

41
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,800
You know, look at all these curious cat questions I have backed up there.

42
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,280
About a tenth of those are about this Amazing Atheist video.

43
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,520
So here you go, folks.

44
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,760
Here's the funny thing I caught TJ out on, and once I've explained this,

45
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,120
hopefully you can all leave me alone about it.

46
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,760
So something I'm going to touch on in my next video

47
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,520
is how starved for material anti-feminist YouTube is,

48
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,560
and you can tell this mainly because they all make the same videos

49
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,840
covering the same topics.

50
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,200
For example, when our old pal Milo Stewart made a bit of a clumsy video

51
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,640
where they explained what they'd learned about subconscious biases,

52
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,920
anti-feminist YouTube pounced and all made the exact same response video

53
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,200
crowing about it.

54
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,280
A young trans person saying something that's easy to clip out of context

55
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,160
was a much-needed gulp of air for that overcrowded, asphyxiating rat cage.

56
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,000
Anyway, one such hack desperate for material was the Amazing Atheist

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,080
who made a video entitled Transgender Bigots Hate Speech,

58
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,840
and my video was a response to that.

59
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,520
I was originally going to remake the video in its entirety,

60
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,840
but actually most of it holds up pretty well,

61
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,720
so I'll just include an edited version here following these disclaimers.

62
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,880
So I've excised the regrettable personal insults directed at TJ

63
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,800
from the following clips, but I haven't re-recorded the audio,

64
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,200
and it's a little bit different from how I do it now.

65
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,440
First of all, if you think I speak slowly now,

66
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,120
wait until you get a load of this.

67
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,200
My delivery has definitely improved over the last year, I'd say, watching this.

68
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,160
Secondly, I still call TJ an idiot at one point,

69
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,400
and that word and other words like stupid or moron, for instance,

70
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,160
are things I'm trying more often to avoid lately.

71
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,040
Uh, attributing deliberate actions to just unintelligence

72
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,600
is something that started sitting kinda wrong with me.

73
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,760
I feel like it can erase responsibility and agency in kind of an irresponsible manner.

74
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,360
You know, it kinda lets people off the hook when they do something maliciously

75
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,520
to just chalk it up to idiocy.

76
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,800
So that's something I try to avoid these days.

77
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,600
I also at one point refer to the trans lifestyle, I think I say,

78
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,040
which is honestly just a bit of lazy scripting that would not make it into a video these days,

79
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,080
because it makes it sound kinda trivial in context,

80
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,920
the word lifestyle being more usually associated with choice, as in lifestyle choice,

81
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,880
like deciding to reduce your carb intake or something.

82
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,120
Again, not much of an excuse, but I didn't really have many viewers back then,

83
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,320
and I didn't take as much care with my language as I try to now.

84
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,080
And instead of correcting these errors, I thought I'd leave them in

85
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,880
so I could make these points about how my approach has changed

86
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,800
and how I'm thinking about my language more and trying to be better with it.

87
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,000
With that out the way, here you go.

88
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,360
So anyway, let's get to TJ's arguments.

89
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,480
And I'll give a short summary of the section of Milo's video TJ is responding to,

90
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,800
we'll watch his response, and then we'll respond to his response.

91
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,300
What fun.

92
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,700
So Milo says,

93
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:31,700
All members of a majority are biased against the members of the minority or oppressed group.

94
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,260
And TJ responds,

95
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:39,140
The minority is always oppressed by the majority,

96
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:47,700
just like the 0.1% richest people are all oppressed by the 99% poorest people.

97
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,420
That's how that works, right? Oh yeah!

98
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,900
Now, where TJ's went wrong there is that he's only thinking of the minority and the majority

99
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,220
in a strictly numeric sense.

100
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,820
He's only considering the mathematical use of the words.

101
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,900
And when we're talking about societies,

102
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:10,980
the minority refers to a group that has a minority of that society's power.

103
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:17,380
For instance, black people in the United States are both a statistical and social minority.

104
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,100
Women, on the other hand, are a statistical majority,

105
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,980
but still considered a social minority,

106
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:30,500
because compared to men, they hold a minority of power, influence, and privilege.

107
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,660
In TJ's example, the rich are a statistical minority,

108
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:39,940
but they're not a social minority because they have a majority of the power.

109
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,440
Yeah?

110
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:41,720
Yeah.

111
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,720
Milo says,

112
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,840
Imperialism created cisnormativity and heteronormativity.

113
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,440
And TJ responds,

114
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:56,680
Then why have these been the norm in every human culture that we've ever heard about?

115
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,320
Now, I'll interrupt TJ there.

116
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,360
My understanding of the word heteronormativity

117
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:08,920
is the belief that heterosexuality is the only normal or natural sexual orientation.

118
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:15,480
And TJ says that this applies to all human cultures that we have ever heard about.

119
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:21,000
So all we have to do to disprove this point is name one human society ever

120
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:27,160
that considered same-sex sexual relations a normal part of life.

121
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,880
And one obvious one should immediately spring to mind.

122
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,880
And now, I don't actually know too much about ancient Greece.

123
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,880
I'm more of an ancient Rome guy.

124
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:42,200
And the Romans had an interesting attitude towards what we would call homosexuality.

125
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,880
You see, the Romans didn't see things in terms of our modern notions of gay and straight.

126
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,200
They looked at sexual relations as either active or passive.

127
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,200
You know, a Roman man could have sex with other men without stigma

128
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,520
so long as he was considered the dominant partner in the relationship.

129
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,000
And all British schoolchildren will at some point learn about Hadrian's Wall,

130
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,920
which was built by Emperor Hadrian.

131
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,400
And he loved everything Greek and was what we would consider to be an openly gay man.

132
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:19,400
Not every culture has had the same attitude towards sexual orientations.

133
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,040
They haven't even had the same definitions of sexual orientations.

134
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:29,080
And since Milo specifically mentioned imperialism, the point's obvious.

135
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,120
There were lots of different cultures with a lot of different attitudes towards sex and gender.

136
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,560
And then as empires spread and took over those territories,

137
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,680
they impose their understanding of what's normal.

138
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,800
So either TJ has never heard of ancient Greece,

139
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,920
or he's misunderstood Milo's point and is actually arguing against something else.

140
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,720
And if we watch the second part of TJ's response, we'll see that this is, in fact, the case.

141
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,800
Hell, why is this the norm?

142
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:02,920
In animal cultures, a male lion is different than a female lion.

143
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,000
Not only physically, but in their roles.

144
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,320
You know, a male gorilla is different than a female gorilla.

145
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,600
Not just in terms of their physicality, but in terms of their roles in gorilla society.

146
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,400
And you can go all the way down the evolutionary line to most species that sexually reproduce,

147
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,120
and you're going to find that there are delineated roles for the genders.

148
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,560
So it's not some human construct.

149
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,400
It's not, ooh, imperialism!

150
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:37,560
You see, Milo said imperialism created cisnormativity and heteronormativity.

151
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,840
What TJ is arguing against is this.

152
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,160
Imperialism created the concept of gender roles,

153
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,040
and that's why he started talking about animals.

154
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:54,040
You see, cisnormativity and heteronormativity are to do with societal attitudes towards things,

155
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,240
and they can't really be translated into the animal kingdom,

156
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,120
because non-human animals aren't capable of having opinions.

157
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,240
So even though TJ got the wrong end of the stick

158
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,240
and is arguing against something that Milo didn't actually say,

159
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,400
let's briefly address his point anyway.

160
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,240
So to start with, TJ is right.

161
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,840
Animals do have physical differences between males and females,

162
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,680
and males and females do often serve different roles.

163
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,440
Now what he missed is that these roles are capable of change.

164
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,840
They're not set in stone.

165
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,320
You know, lots of different animals have evolved in a lot of interesting ways.

166
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,080
And we know the obvious ones.

167
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,480
Male seahorses give birth.

168
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,280
A clownfish can change from male to female should the need arise.

169
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,600
And now I know someone's sitting there saying,

170
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,160
ah, TJ didn't mention fish or insects or anything, he mentioned mammals.

171
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,240
A male lion is different than a female lion.

172
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,240
Not only physically, but in their roles.

173
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,680
So, okay, let's look at lions, you know.

174
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,080
There's clearly a physical difference between male and female lions.

175
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,720
For instance, here's a picture of a male lion.

176
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,240
No it isn't, it's a picture of a female lion.

177
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,120
Now apparently some female lions are growing manes

178
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,520
and taking on the traditionally male role of frightening away competitors.

179
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,120
Gender fluid lions, eh?

180
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,180
Who knew?

181
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,480
Milo says he mainly talks about western societies

182
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,680
because that's what he personally has experience of.

183
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,760
And TJ responds.

184
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,280
Yeah, well, maybe you should visit those other societies

185
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,840
just so you have a better basis of understanding.

186
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,800
In western culture, here's how the conversation goes.

187
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,880
Hey guys, I may appear female,

188
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,760
but I am in fact a non-binary trans person who prefers male pronouns.

189
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,520
Some of us do not agree.

190
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,040
I am oppressed!

191
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,540
Ah!

192
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:56,220
And wouldn't it be nice if the worst that western trans people had to face was polite disagreement?

193
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:02,060
Now I'm not going to go through a bunch of news reports about murdered and abused trans people

194
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:06,300
just to prove a point to an idiot in a YouTube video.

195
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:12,220
You can google transgender hate crimes on your own time if you feel like depressing yourself.

196
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,860
But even aside from the horrible violent stuff,

197
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,420
there's still a lot of institutional bias against trans people in the west.

198
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:25,020
There's still a lot of trans people living in states or countries without equal legal protections,

199
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:31,340
and a lot of places don't count trans people as a protected group under hate crime legislation.

200
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:36,460
And of course, trans people still have little direct representation in government.

201
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,660
You see, TJ, sometimes the people who say,

202
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,340
I do not agree, go on to say,

203
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:53,100
You know, pretending that the worst trans people have to deal with

204
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,860
is some people politely not agreeing with their lifestyle,

205
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,020
that itself is transphobic.

206
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,260
You know, by my estimate anyway.

207
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:08,380
So let's watch the rest of TJ's response, and fair warning, it's about to get a little weird.

208
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,540
Meanwhile, in Middle Eastern society,

209
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:16,460
Hey guys, I may appear female, but I am in fact a non-binary trans person who prefers male pronouns!

210
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,140
Behead the infidel!

211
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:22,300
But first, let us rape her to remind her that she is female!

212
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,580
African society,

213
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:29,260
Hey guys, I may appear female, but I am in fact a non-binary trans person who prefers male pronouns!

214
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,860
She is a witch! She eats at a poo-poo!

215
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,740
Let's chop her up into pieces, then burn the pieces!

216
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:42,380
So, it'd be easy to just dismiss that bit as nothing but lazy racist jokes

217
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,220
made by a lazy racist man.

218
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,060
Because that's what it was.

219
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,860
But let's talk about it anyway.

220
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,020
So first off, I'm white.

221
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,660
And if I were trying to disprove that all white people were racist,

222
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:01,500
my first priority would be to ensure that while I was arguing my case,

223
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,100
I didn't start doing a bunch of racist impressions.

224
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,860
TJ really fell at the first hurdle there.

225
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,660
So I've been making videos for a while now,

226
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,620
and one thing that happens is you start to notice certain things in other people's videos

227
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,260
that maybe you didn't pay attention to before.

228
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,420
You know, for instance, before I went through the process of making videos myself,

229
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,340
I never used to notice or think about stray frames.

230
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,660
And there's one earlier in TJ's video.

231
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,820
It's right... here.

232
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,780
And that happens when you make a cut at the wrong time,

233
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,540
and accidentally leave in one or two frames that shouldn't be there.

234
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,780
And I'm certainly guilty of that too.

235
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:45,180
And I'm also thinking more about how certain visuals are created.

236
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,900
You know, for those of you that don't make videos,

237
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:52,940
I want you to go through the process of how you'd go about creating this image.

238
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,500
So let's think it through, okay.

239
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:01,180
You're a lazy racist, and you want to do a lazy racist impression of some African men.

240
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:06,460
Now first things first, you need a photograph of some African men.

241
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,580
So what do you do?

242
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:13,100
You go to Google image search, you type in African men, and it's right there.

243
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,300
And I'm not kidding.

244
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:19,340
When I decided to find this image, it took me approximately four seconds.

245
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,340
That's how lazy TJ is.

246
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,540
Now because you're a lazy racist, you don't think,

247
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,900
I wonder who these people actually are.

248
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,940
Where did this image come from?

249
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,940
Are the people in the image anything at all, like my stereotype?

250
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,740
Who cares, right?

251
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,020
You just download the image, you shove it in your video, and you're good to go.

252
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,900
However, and I realize I have a somewhat monotone voice,

253
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,100
but what you're hearing right now is excitement.

254
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,060
If we click on the image, we can see where it came from.

255
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,620
And excuse my language, it's a fucking screencap

256
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:01,260
from a YouTube video about stereotypes of African men.

257
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,180
I shit you not.

258
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,940
We are likeable and friendly guys.

259
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,620
And we are even on Facebook.

260
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,340
We are more than a stereotype.

261
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,620
Let's change the perception.

262
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,580
TJ?

263
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,060
You dumb fuck.

264
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,020
There are a bunch of university students talking about

265
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,220
how they're stereotyped as violent and stupid.

266
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,300
And what did you say?

267
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,580
She is a witch!

268
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,100
She eats at a poo-poo!

269
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,980
Let's chop her up into pieces, then burn the pieces!

270
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,460
But you don't really think of us that way, do you?

271
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,660
Oh, I'm sorry, seemingly friendly African man.

272
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,820
Apparently we do think of you that way, because we're racist.

273
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,500
And too lazy to do even the bare minimum amount of research.

274
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,740
Maybe making fun of TJ is shooting fish in a barrel.

275
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,100
He's a joke.

276
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,620
Obviously.

277
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,660
I get it.

278
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,620
But the person who told me to take a look at this video

279
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,540
described the amazing atheist as not that mean,

280
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,860
and as having a brain.

281
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,700
And I'm sorry, I am not seeing that here.

282
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,620
You know, just because someone presents as rational and intelligent

283
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,740
doesn't mean they are.

284
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:24,060
And to be honest, sometimes shooting fish in a barrel's just fun.

285
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,100
And even if he is a joke, there's enough people out there

286
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,500
who think he isn't a joke that he's worth correcting.

287
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,460
You know, you only have to look at his YouTube comments

288
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:38,700
to see people agreeing with his incorrect, lazy, racist opinions.

289
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,100
Speaking of looking at his YouTube comments,

290
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,220
and would you believe it, people are still saying this.

291
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,380
They're still saying that.

292
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,140
You know the really sad thing here?

293
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,900
TJ actually included a clip of Milo calling himself racist,

294
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:58,620
which means the people commenting this here didn't watch Milo's video or TJ's response.

295
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,300
So it looks like TJ's fans are dumber than Leafy's fans even,

296
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,020
which, quite the accomplishment, lads.

297
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,540
Well done.

298
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,860
So there you go, folks.

299
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,700
Apologies about my language again.

300
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,500
It's an evolving process, this video thing,

301
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,460
and I'm sure a year down the line I'll probably be apologizing

302
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,140
about something I said in this video.

303
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,740
Thanks as always to my supporters over on Patreon.

304
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,620
This video was a reward for hitting a new tier on there.

305
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:29,020
The other reward for hitting that tier is a 24-hour live stream

306
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,580
of the very good computer game Bad Rats,

307
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,860
which will be taking place next month around Christmas time.

308
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,340
Any donations I receive during that stream will be going to charity.

309
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,300
Now, I don't actually know a good charity for this sort of thing,

310
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,260
so please send me a message on Curious Cat

311
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,020
if you have any advice there.

312
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,260
And head over and check out my Patreon if you like,

313
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,380
because some new gold rewards will be going up fairly soon.

314
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,580
How exciting.

315
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,140
Anyway, thanks a lot, folks, and I'll see you next time.
