0	6320	Hello, everyone. Just a quick video today, but it's a bit of an odd one, so allow me to explain.
6540	14640	And I have to talk about myself a little bit here, so apologies. I did try to write around that, I promise, but it was impossible.
15180	20740	Now, when I started out on YouTube, I was just making rather mediocre, honestly,
21000	27840	Let's Plays with my friend Jen for something to do, and that's what I thought YouTube was for, really.
27840	33440	But Minecraft videos, catch jumping into boxes, and rally crash compilations,
34240	39840	Why would you stand on the corner at a rally? Why are they standing on the corners?
40160	40800	Oh, God.
41360	49760	I didn't really have a clue about any of this political stuff that was going on on YouTube, you know, all of these new media personalities,
49760	56800	or whatever else they like to call themselves, you know, instead of what they actually are, which is someone with a blog.
57600	60640	Someone with a blog who takes it way too seriously.
61360	63840	Of which I am one now, I suppose.
64320	71280	But back when I made the switch from making fun videos to depressing videos, it's fair to say I was a little behind the times.
71760	75600	You see, what I was aware of were the atheist YouTubers in the
75840	82000	were-geniuses-by-virtue-of-knowing-the-earth-is-round vein, like Thunderf00t and TheAmazingAtheist.
82240	87360	And I incorrectly assumed they were still the big fish in the YouTube pond.
87840	94160	Not so anymore, of course. These days, there's a lot of other fish people are watching.
94640	100800	For example, the likes of amateur ufologist and 9-11 truther, Sarkad of Akkad,
101360	104240	Brain pill salesman, Paul Joseph Watson,
104640	109280	that guy whose avatar is like something unusual wearing a suit.
110080	112560	You know the guy. The name escapes me right now.
113120	117360	A Canadian who complains about immigrants despite being one,
117840	123840	the world's greatest living philosopher, Stefan Molyneux, Laura Loomer, and Boxxy.
124320	129600	But I didn't know all that back then, of course, so I decided to make a video about TheAmazingAtheist,
129600	132400	which, if you go and check, isn't there anymore.
132800	138080	You see, making that video, I was still kind of finding my feet somewhat and working out an approach
138480	143760	and all that, and it's no excuse, really, but I said some pretty rude personal things about TJ,
143760	148800	which was a mistake and something I felt uncomfortable with afterwards and sorry about,
148800	150480	so I deleted the video.
150480	156080	I basically attributed TJ's rather racist and offensive views featured in that video
156080	160800	to him being mentally ill, which was unfair not only to him but also, you know,
160800	164480	all the other people who struggle with various mental illnesses without being
164480	168560	racist or terrible people, so I apologize for that.
168560	172880	And I'm grateful, in a sense, that I made that mistake and learned from it
172880	175760	while my channel and audience were still fairly small.
175760	178240	I kind of snuck that one under the radar there.
178960	182240	There were a couple of downsides to deleting that video, though.
182240	186400	The first is that besides being unfairly rude about TJ personally,
186400	189200	I did catch him out on something particularly funny.
189840	192800	The other downside is that ever since I deleted that video,
192800	195120	I've had people asking me if they can see it.
195120	198800	You know, look at all these curious cat questions I have backed up there.
198800	203280	About a tenth of those are about this Amazing Atheist video.
203280	205520	So here you go, folks.
205520	209760	Here's the funny thing I caught TJ out on, and once I've explained this,
210480	213120	hopefully you can all leave me alone about it.
213120	215760	So something I'm going to touch on in my next video
215760	219520	is how starved for material anti-feminist YouTube is,
219520	222560	and you can tell this mainly because they all make the same videos
222560	223840	covering the same topics.
224640	229200	For example, when our old pal Milo Stewart made a bit of a clumsy video
229200	232640	where they explained what they'd learned about subconscious biases,
233280	237920	anti-feminist YouTube pounced and all made the exact same response video
237920	239200	crowing about it.
239200	243280	A young trans person saying something that's easy to clip out of context
243280	248160	was a much-needed gulp of air for that overcrowded, asphyxiating rat cage.
249520	254000	Anyway, one such hack desperate for material was the Amazing Atheist
254000	258080	who made a video entitled Transgender Bigots Hate Speech,
258080	259840	and my video was a response to that.
260560	263520	I was originally going to remake the video in its entirety,
263520	265840	but actually most of it holds up pretty well,
265840	270720	so I'll just include an edited version here following these disclaimers.
270720	274880	So I've excised the regrettable personal insults directed at TJ
274880	278800	from the following clips, but I haven't re-recorded the audio,
278800	281200	and it's a little bit different from how I do it now.
282080	285440	First of all, if you think I speak slowly now,
285440	287120	wait until you get a load of this.
287120	291200	My delivery has definitely improved over the last year, I'd say, watching this.
292480	296160	Secondly, I still call TJ an idiot at one point,
296160	300400	and that word and other words like stupid or moron, for instance,
300400	304160	are things I'm trying more often to avoid lately.
304880	309040	Uh, attributing deliberate actions to just unintelligence
309040	311600	is something that started sitting kinda wrong with me.
311600	317760	I feel like it can erase responsibility and agency in kind of an irresponsible manner.
317760	321360	You know, it kinda lets people off the hook when they do something maliciously
321360	323520	to just chalk it up to idiocy.
323520	326800	So that's something I try to avoid these days.
326800	331600	I also at one point refer to the trans lifestyle, I think I say,
331600	337040	which is honestly just a bit of lazy scripting that would not make it into a video these days,
337040	340080	because it makes it sound kinda trivial in context,
340080	345920	the word lifestyle being more usually associated with choice, as in lifestyle choice,
345920	348880	like deciding to reduce your carb intake or something.
349440	353120	Again, not much of an excuse, but I didn't really have many viewers back then,
353120	356320	and I didn't take as much care with my language as I try to now.
357360	360080	And instead of correcting these errors, I thought I'd leave them in
360080	362880	so I could make these points about how my approach has changed
362880	366800	and how I'm thinking about my language more and trying to be better with it.
367600	370000	With that out the way, here you go.
370960	373360	So anyway, let's get to TJ's arguments.
373920	378480	And I'll give a short summary of the section of Milo's video TJ is responding to,
378480	382800	we'll watch his response, and then we'll respond to his response.
382800	383300	What fun.
384180	385700	So Milo says,
385700	391700	All members of a majority are biased against the members of the minority or oppressed group.
392580	394260	And TJ responds,
394260	399140	The minority is always oppressed by the majority,
399140	407700	just like the 0.1% richest people are all oppressed by the 99% poorest people.
407700	410420	That's how that works, right? Oh yeah!
411300	416900	Now, where TJ's went wrong there is that he's only thinking of the minority and the majority
416900	419220	in a strictly numeric sense.
419220	422820	He's only considering the mathematical use of the words.
422820	424900	And when we're talking about societies,
424900	430980	the minority refers to a group that has a minority of that society's power.
431540	437380	For instance, black people in the United States are both a statistical and social minority.
438020	442100	Women, on the other hand, are a statistical majority,
442100	444980	but still considered a social minority,
444980	450500	because compared to men, they hold a minority of power, influence, and privilege.
450500	454660	In TJ's example, the rich are a statistical minority,
454660	459940	but they're not a social minority because they have a majority of the power.
459940	460440	Yeah?
461220	461720	Yeah.
462520	463720	Milo says,
463720	468840	Imperialism created cisnormativity and heteronormativity.
468840	470440	And TJ responds,
470440	476680	Then why have these been the norm in every human culture that we've ever heard about?
477400	479320	Now, I'll interrupt TJ there.
479320	482360	My understanding of the word heteronormativity
482360	488920	is the belief that heterosexuality is the only normal or natural sexual orientation.
488920	495480	And TJ says that this applies to all human cultures that we have ever heard about.
495480	501000	So all we have to do to disprove this point is name one human society ever
501640	507160	that considered same-sex sexual relations a normal part of life.
507160	509880	And one obvious one should immediately spring to mind.
510520	513880	And now, I don't actually know too much about ancient Greece.
513880	515880	I'm more of an ancient Rome guy.
515880	522200	And the Romans had an interesting attitude towards what we would call homosexuality.
522200	527880	You see, the Romans didn't see things in terms of our modern notions of gay and straight.
527880	532200	They looked at sexual relations as either active or passive.
532200	536200	You know, a Roman man could have sex with other men without stigma
536200	540520	so long as he was considered the dominant partner in the relationship.
540520	545000	And all British schoolchildren will at some point learn about Hadrian's Wall,
545000	546920	which was built by Emperor Hadrian.
547720	553400	And he loved everything Greek and was what we would consider to be an openly gay man.
554040	559400	Not every culture has had the same attitude towards sexual orientations.
559400	564040	They haven't even had the same definitions of sexual orientations.
564040	569080	And since Milo specifically mentioned imperialism, the point's obvious.
569080	574120	There were lots of different cultures with a lot of different attitudes towards sex and gender.
574120	577560	And then as empires spread and took over those territories,
577560	580680	they impose their understanding of what's normal.
581240	583800	So either TJ has never heard of ancient Greece,
583800	588920	or he's misunderstood Milo's point and is actually arguing against something else.
588920	593720	And if we watch the second part of TJ's response, we'll see that this is, in fact, the case.
594280	595800	Hell, why is this the norm?
596600	602920	In animal cultures, a male lion is different than a female lion.
603480	607000	Not only physically, but in their roles.
608040	611320	You know, a male gorilla is different than a female gorilla.
611320	616600	Not just in terms of their physicality, but in terms of their roles in gorilla society.
616600	621400	And you can go all the way down the evolutionary line to most species that sexually reproduce,
621400	626120	and you're going to find that there are delineated roles for the genders.
626840	629560	So it's not some human construct.
629560	631400	It's not, ooh, imperialism!
632280	637560	You see, Milo said imperialism created cisnormativity and heteronormativity.
638280	640840	What TJ is arguing against is this.
641480	645160	Imperialism created the concept of gender roles,
645160	648040	and that's why he started talking about animals.
648040	654040	You see, cisnormativity and heteronormativity are to do with societal attitudes towards things,
654040	657240	and they can't really be translated into the animal kingdom,
657800	662120	because non-human animals aren't capable of having opinions.
662760	665240	So even though TJ got the wrong end of the stick
665240	669240	and is arguing against something that Milo didn't actually say,
669240	671400	let's briefly address his point anyway.
671400	673240	So to start with, TJ is right.
673240	676840	Animals do have physical differences between males and females,
676840	680680	and males and females do often serve different roles.
680680	684440	Now what he missed is that these roles are capable of change.
685080	686840	They're not set in stone.
686840	691320	You know, lots of different animals have evolved in a lot of interesting ways.
691320	693080	And we know the obvious ones.
693080	695480	Male seahorses give birth.
695480	700280	A clownfish can change from male to female should the need arise.
700280	702600	And now I know someone's sitting there saying,
702600	707160	ah, TJ didn't mention fish or insects or anything, he mentioned mammals.
707720	711240	A male lion is different than a female lion.
711800	715240	Not only physically, but in their roles.
716200	718680	So, okay, let's look at lions, you know.
718680	723080	There's clearly a physical difference between male and female lions.
723080	725720	For instance, here's a picture of a male lion.
726280	729240	No it isn't, it's a picture of a female lion.
729240	732120	Now apparently some female lions are growing manes
732120	736520	and taking on the traditionally male role of frightening away competitors.
736520	738120	Gender fluid lions, eh?
738680	739180	Who knew?
740200	743480	Milo says he mainly talks about western societies
743560	746680	because that's what he personally has experience of.
747560	748760	And TJ responds.
749320	752280	Yeah, well, maybe you should visit those other societies
752280	754840	just so you have a better basis of understanding.
754840	757800	In western culture, here's how the conversation goes.
757800	759880	Hey guys, I may appear female,
759880	764760	but I am in fact a non-binary trans person who prefers male pronouns.
764760	766520	Some of us do not agree.
766520	768040	I am oppressed!
768040	768540	Ah!
768540	776220	And wouldn't it be nice if the worst that western trans people had to face was polite disagreement?
776220	782060	Now I'm not going to go through a bunch of news reports about murdered and abused trans people
782060	786300	just to prove a point to an idiot in a YouTube video.
786300	792220	You can google transgender hate crimes on your own time if you feel like depressing yourself.
792220	794860	But even aside from the horrible violent stuff,
794860	799420	there's still a lot of institutional bias against trans people in the west.
799420	805020	There's still a lot of trans people living in states or countries without equal legal protections,
805580	811340	and a lot of places don't count trans people as a protected group under hate crime legislation.
811340	816460	And of course, trans people still have little direct representation in government.
816460	819660	You see, TJ, sometimes the people who say,
820220	823340	I do not agree, go on to say,
829580	833100	You know, pretending that the worst trans people have to deal with
833100	836860	is some people politely not agreeing with their lifestyle,
836860	839020	that itself is transphobic.
839020	841260	You know, by my estimate anyway.
841820	848380	So let's watch the rest of TJ's response, and fair warning, it's about to get a little weird.
848460	850540	Meanwhile, in Middle Eastern society,
850540	856460	Hey guys, I may appear female, but I am in fact a non-binary trans person who prefers male pronouns!
856460	858140	Behead the infidel!
858140	862300	But first, let us rape her to remind her that she is female!
862300	863580	African society,
863580	869260	Hey guys, I may appear female, but I am in fact a non-binary trans person who prefers male pronouns!
869980	872860	She is a witch! She eats at a poo-poo!
872860	875740	Let's chop her up into pieces, then burn the pieces!
876700	882380	So, it'd be easy to just dismiss that bit as nothing but lazy racist jokes
882380	884220	made by a lazy racist man.
884940	886060	Because that's what it was.
886700	888860	But let's talk about it anyway.
888860	891020	So first off, I'm white.
891660	895660	And if I were trying to disprove that all white people were racist,
896460	901500	my first priority would be to ensure that while I was arguing my case,
901500	905100	I didn't start doing a bunch of racist impressions.
906060	908860	TJ really fell at the first hurdle there.
909420	911660	So I've been making videos for a while now,
911660	916620	and one thing that happens is you start to notice certain things in other people's videos
916620	919260	that maybe you didn't pay attention to before.
919260	923420	You know, for instance, before I went through the process of making videos myself,
923420	927340	I never used to notice or think about stray frames.
927340	929660	And there's one earlier in TJ's video.
929660	931820	It's right... here.
931820	934780	And that happens when you make a cut at the wrong time,
934860	938540	and accidentally leave in one or two frames that shouldn't be there.
938540	940780	And I'm certainly guilty of that too.
940780	945180	And I'm also thinking more about how certain visuals are created.
945180	947900	You know, for those of you that don't make videos,
947900	952940	I want you to go through the process of how you'd go about creating this image.
953500	955500	So let's think it through, okay.
955500	961180	You're a lazy racist, and you want to do a lazy racist impression of some African men.
961740	966460	Now first things first, you need a photograph of some African men.
966460	967580	So what do you do?
967580	973100	You go to Google image search, you type in African men, and it's right there.
973100	974300	And I'm not kidding.
974300	979340	When I decided to find this image, it took me approximately four seconds.
979340	981340	That's how lazy TJ is.
981900	984540	Now because you're a lazy racist, you don't think,
985180	987900	I wonder who these people actually are.
989180	990940	Where did this image come from?
991980	996940	Are the people in the image anything at all, like my stereotype?
996940	997740	Who cares, right?
997740	1001020	You just download the image, you shove it in your video, and you're good to go.
1001740	1005900	However, and I realize I have a somewhat monotone voice,
1005900	1009100	but what you're hearing right now is excitement.
1009100	1012060	If we click on the image, we can see where it came from.
1012780	1016620	And excuse my language, it's a fucking screencap
1016620	1021260	from a YouTube video about stereotypes of African men.
1021260	1023180	I shit you not.
1023180	1024940	We are likeable and friendly guys.
1024940	1026620	And we are even on Facebook.
1027180	1029340	We are more than a stereotype.
1029340	1030620	Let's change the perception.
1036940	1037580	TJ?
1038860	1040060	You dumb fuck.
1040060	1043020	There are a bunch of university students talking about
1043020	1046220	how they're stereotyped as violent and stupid.
1046940	1048300	And what did you say?
1048300	1049580	She is a witch!
1049580	1051100	She eats at a poo-poo!
1051100	1053980	Let's chop her up into pieces, then burn the pieces!
1058380	1060460	But you don't really think of us that way, do you?
1062380	1065660	Oh, I'm sorry, seemingly friendly African man.
1065660	1069820	Apparently we do think of you that way, because we're racist.
1069820	1073500	And too lazy to do even the bare minimum amount of research.
1074300	1077740	Maybe making fun of TJ is shooting fish in a barrel.
1078300	1079100	He's a joke.
1079660	1080620	Obviously.
1080620	1081660	I get it.
1081660	1084620	But the person who told me to take a look at this video
1084620	1088540	described the amazing atheist as not that mean,
1089180	1090860	and as having a brain.
1091500	1094700	And I'm sorry, I am not seeing that here.
1094700	1098620	You know, just because someone presents as rational and intelligent
1098620	1099740	doesn't mean they are.
1100380	1104060	And to be honest, sometimes shooting fish in a barrel's just fun.
1104620	1107100	And even if he is a joke, there's enough people out there
1107100	1109500	who think he isn't a joke that he's worth correcting.
1110140	1112460	You know, you only have to look at his YouTube comments
1112460	1118700	to see people agreeing with his incorrect, lazy, racist opinions.
1118700	1121100	Speaking of looking at his YouTube comments,
1121100	1124220	and would you believe it, people are still saying this.
1124940	1126380	They're still saying that.
1126380	1128140	You know the really sad thing here?
1128140	1131900	TJ actually included a clip of Milo calling himself racist,
1132540	1138620	which means the people commenting this here didn't watch Milo's video or TJ's response.
1138620	1142300	So it looks like TJ's fans are dumber than Leafy's fans even,
1142300	1145020	which, quite the accomplishment, lads.
1145900	1146540	Well done.
1147500	1148860	So there you go, folks.
1148860	1150700	Apologies about my language again.
1150700	1153500	It's an evolving process, this video thing,
1153500	1156460	and I'm sure a year down the line I'll probably be apologizing
1156460	1158140	about something I said in this video.
1158780	1161740	Thanks as always to my supporters over on Patreon.
1161740	1164620	This video was a reward for hitting a new tier on there.
1165180	1169020	The other reward for hitting that tier is a 24-hour live stream
1169020	1171580	of the very good computer game Bad Rats,
1171580	1174860	which will be taking place next month around Christmas time.
1175580	1179340	Any donations I receive during that stream will be going to charity.
1179340	1182300	Now, I don't actually know a good charity for this sort of thing,
1183180	1185260	so please send me a message on Curious Cat
1185260	1187020	if you have any advice there.
1187020	1189260	And head over and check out my Patreon if you like,
1189260	1192380	because some new gold rewards will be going up fairly soon.
1192380	1193580	How exciting.
1193580	1196140	Anyway, thanks a lot, folks, and I'll see you next time.
