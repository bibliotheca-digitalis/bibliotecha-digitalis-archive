1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Hello, everyone. Today we're going to be talking about transphobia and particularly British transphobia,

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,400
and even more particularly, transphobia in the British press.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,200
That's right, the UK press seems to have a problem with trans people.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,200
Now, the tabloid press obviously does, but since those papers are seemingly written by and for

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:28,000
the absolute worst, most vile people ever to have existed on planet Earth, that's to be somewhat expected.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
No, today I'd like to talk about that bastion of fair-weather progressivism, The Guardian,

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
which, for all the blessedly non-British viewers out there, is our leading centre-left newspaper.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Surely, The Guardian can be counted on to stand up for minority rights.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A wrong person might say.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And I'll quote here from an article written on the 2nd of November of last year, entitled

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Why We Take Issue with The Guardian's Stance on Trans Rights in the UK.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The Trump administration is trying to define transgender people out of existence.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Last month, the New York Times reported that the US government is seeking to deny trans people

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
the most basic recognition by claiming that gender is determined by the genitals that a person is born with.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The leaked memo sparked outrage and fear about a policy that could cost lives

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and prevent millions of Americans from existing in public spaces.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The Guardian in the US is committed to covering this important civil rights fight,

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
but when the time came for us to report on Trump's attacks, we encountered problems.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Some trans people wouldn't talk to us.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's because days earlier, The Guardian published an editorial that we believe promoted transphobic viewpoints,

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
including some of the same assertions about gender that US politicians are citing in their push to eliminate trans rights.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Guardian journalists in the US had no input in the editorial, which we felt was misplaced and misguided,

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and nearly all reporters and editors from our New York, Washington DC, and California offices wrote to UK editors with our concerns.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So then, the UK Guardian has been very naughty and has had to be told off by the Americans. How shameful.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Now, the editorial that inspired this response is from the 17th of October and is titled

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The Guardian View on the Gender Recognition Act Where Rights Collide,

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and is actually only one in a recent series of fairly rubbish, to put it lightly, articles about trans people from The Guardian.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But we'll get to those in a little while.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This particular article makes the case that, quote,

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Transphobia must be opposed, but misogyny, too, must be challenged.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Gender identity does not cancel out sex.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Women's oppression by men has a physical basis, and to deny the relevance of biology when considering sexual inequality is a mistake.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The struggle for women's empowerment is ongoing.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Reproductive freedoms are under threat, and the Me Too campaign faces a backlash.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Women's concerns about sharing dormitories or changing rooms with male-bodied people must be taken seriously.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
These are not just questions of safety, but of dignity and fairness.

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Now, we're going to talk more about this article later, so I won't dwell on it too much right now,

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
but with regards to the argument that cis women's concerns about sharing spaces with trans women must be taken seriously,

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
one possible line of response does immediately jump to mind, and that's historical comparison.

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Consider an article that, discussing desegregation, say, made the case that

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
white people's concerns about sharing spaces with black people must be taken seriously.

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Or responding to a gay rights issue with

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
straight people's concerns about sharing spaces with gay people must be taken seriously.

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Now, I realize that there are people around today still making those arguments.

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I don't mean to make it seem like those issues are solely in the distant past, because they aren't.

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Anyone old enough to remember the Don't Ask, Don't Tell debates in the United States

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
might remember a fair bit of fearmongering about gay people in showers and locker rooms, for instance.

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
However, it is hard to imagine our liberal pals over at The Guardian making those kinds of arguments today.

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
They would, in fact, rightly condemn any politician that made those remarks.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So why do we see them making the same arguments with regards to trans people?

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Is there something unique about the current situation, or is the comparison there a valid one?

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And that's what we're going to be talking about today.

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Before we get to that, though, I'd just like to make a few things clear.

54
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Firstly, I'm a cis man, and I am by no means an expert on trans issues, or anything else, actually,

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and nor am I trying to present myself as such.

56
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
If I know anything at all, it's from listening to trans people, reading the things they've written,

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
watching videos they've made, and talking to my trans friends, some of whom helped me write this video, actually.

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What I'm providing here is a platform and a voice.

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm not trying to speak for anyone or claim I'm some authority on anything, because I'm not.

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And I'll include a list of videos by trans people in the description of this video

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
that cover similar topics to what I'm going to be discussing today, but better than I can.

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So go and check those out.

63
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
My aim with this video is to reach out to some of my fellow cis folk who might have,

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
unconsciously even, absorbed some transphobic rhetoric from the bigoted mess that is the British press,

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
or anyone who might have encountered some of these concerns about trans people out in the wild.

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You know, the people who might watch me, but who haven't heard a trans person say these things before

67
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
is a guess who I'm aiming this video at.

68
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Now, to understand the conversation surrounding the Guardian's concerns about gendered spaces, however,

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
and to avoid getting lost somewhere later and having to double back,

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
we're gonna have to start out with some basic concepts here.

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And so we'll begin by asking a simple question.

72
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What makes someone a particular gender?

73
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And there's a lot of bad answers to this question, so let's take a look at some of those.

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And first up is the most basic and crude of answers.

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What bits they've got.

76
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That's right, if you've got a penis and testicles, you're a man.

77
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
If you've got a vagina and ovaries, you're a woman.

78
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So that's a direct one-to-one sex and gender correlation there.

79
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Nothing could be simpler than that, right?

80
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Now, my response to this genital-based answer is twofold.

81
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Firstly, it isn't particularly helpful.

82
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Speaking for myself here, but genitals tend not to come into play

83
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
in the majority of my interactions with other people day-to-day,

84
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
if you can believe such a thing.

85
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I don't know what kind of lives you're all leading, of course,

86
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
but I'm personally not peeking down people's trousers to confirm what they've got in there.

87
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's an inconsequential, unknown quantity.

88
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The vast majority of the time, anyway, and thus not much use to us.

89
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The other problem with this answer, in addition to it being unhelpful,

90
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
is that it isn't actually true.

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Before we even talk about trans people or questions of self-identification,

92
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
conflating gender with genitalia in an exclusively binary way simply doesn't work.

93
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And let's do a thought experiment here.

94
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Now, I personally have a penis.

95
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And you're just gonna have to take my word for that, I'm afraid.

96
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Okay, so let's assume I have a penis.

97
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Say I'm out and about one day and get into some sort of unfortunate situation

98
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
and it comes off, you know, a car accident, say, or some sort of misjudged boast.

99
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So now I've no longer got a penis, or testicles even, let's say.

100
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But that doesn't change my gender, does it?

101
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'd still be a man, you know.

102
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We wouldn't all start calling me she because of that, would we?

103
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'd still identify as and present as a man.

104
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I wouldn't have grown ovaries or something.

105
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You know, you hopefully see my point here.

106
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Accidents, injuries, diseases.

107
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You know, there's plenty of reasons why someone might have to, for instance, have something removed.

108
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And if that's the something we're using to determine which binary gender they belong to,

109
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
we're kinda screwed there.

110
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Okay, so we'll leave that argument behind and we'll go on to the next level.

111
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So, someone might say in response,

112
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I acknowledge that what genitals someone has currently doesn't actually determine their gender,

113
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
but what if we say it's what genitals someone was born with that determines your gender?

114
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Gender is still tied to genitals, just not necessarily your current genitals, you see.

115
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
This is the worrisome definition that we saw the US Guardian staff be rightfully concerned about earlier.

116
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Now, this argument shares a problem with the previous one.

117
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Outside of the person in question, their parents, and their doctors,

118
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
not many other people day to day are gonna know what genitals someone was born with.

119
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So with regards to access to gendered spaces,

120
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
unless you're planning to have people submit a full medical history in order to go into a public restroom, say,

121
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
this way of defining things is similarly unhelpful.

122
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Another problem with this argument is that it completely ignores the experience of intersex people.

123
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Not everyone is born with sexual characteristics that neatly fall into one of two camps.

124
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
There are some people born with ambiguous genitalia.

125
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
There are people with both testicular and ovarian tissue.

126
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And on a genetic level, there are female people with chromosomes normally associated with being male, and vice versa.

127
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Now, obviously, this is a video talking about trans people and not intersex people,

128
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
but I mention them here to show an example of another group of people who would be hurt by legislative attempts

129
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
to define gender as a strictly biological, binary thing.

130
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Now, the response to mentioning intersex people is usually dismissive.

131
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You know, well, there aren't many of those people, are there?

132
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Which is wrong, for a start, because there's actually a lot more intersex people than you might expect.

133
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There's that fun statistic that estimates intersex people are about as common as people with red hair.

134
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Regardless, though, it wouldn't matter if there was just one intersex person on the planet.

135
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It'd still be a valid way of being a person.

136
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Ignoring intersex people or trying to downplay their existence is, in our case,

137
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
a way to enforce a binary system where one does not apply.

138
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Because here's the thing about binary systems.

139
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
There's only two things.

140
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Not usually two things, but also the occasional other thing.

141
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You know, binary code is called that because there's just ones and zeros.

142
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
There isn't, like, a five or an eight from time to time, is there?

143
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I believe bimodal is a more accurate term when talking about sex.

144
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You know, there's two general peaks, but there's fuzzy edges and outliers and so on.

145
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
This intentional ignorance with regards to intersex people, you know,

146
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
thinking that humans are supposed to fall into one of two binary camps

147
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and that anyone who doesn't is some sort of mistake who we can ignore for the sake of convenience,

148
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
actually reminds me of the old creationist misunderstanding of evolution, oddly enough.

149
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
As if there's some will that must be consciously designing humans to fit an ideal standard or something.

150
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Also, even if there were a practical way to use what genitals someone was born with

151
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
to determine which gendered restroom they should go into today,

152
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
efforts to enforce this rule would quickly lead to situations like the following.

153
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So, this chap here is Michael Hughes, a trans man from Minnesota.

154
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Now, in response to so-called bathroom bills designed to force people to only use facilities

155
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
that match their assigned gender at birth, Michael Hughes posted a series of photographs of himself

156
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
looking very out of place in the women's toilets.

157
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Now, this is ridiculous, clearly.

158
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Legislation designed to allay bigoted fears about, quote,

159
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,000
men going into the ladies' toilets would lead to this guy having to go into the ladies' toilets.

160
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Because if he went into the men's, he could be arrested.

161
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Now, this is a poorly thought-out hypocrisy, clearly.

162
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
However, there's a fair bit more to be said about trans men's restroom issues here,

163
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
issues I didn't really know about until I started writing this video, actually.

164
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It is easy to point to pictures of a big bearded tattooed guy in a women's restroom and say,

165
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Ha, ha, there you go, transphobes, your hysteria about trans women has led to this situation.

166
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
How silly and hypocritical of you.

167
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And that can be fun, you know, pointing out hypocrisy often is.

168
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But we can find ourselves playing into a harmful narrative here,

169
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
and it's one of masculinity being inherently dangerous.

170
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
How we do public restrooms is often rather rubbish.

171
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
There can be facilities in women's restrooms, say, places to dispose of menstrual products,

172
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
or an adequate number of doored stalls for people who can't urinate standing up,

173
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
that often don't exist in the men's bathrooms.

174
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Women aren't the only people to menstruate,

175
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
but their bathrooms are the places we as a society are expecting menstruation to be dealt with.

176
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And that puts trans men here in a very awkward and unfortunate situation.

177
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Their needs aren't being accommodated there.

178
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So, you know, it's still okay to highlight the hypocrisy, I reckon,

179
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
but we should be careful to do it in a way that doesn't present masculinity as being inherently harmful.

180
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
There could be completely legitimate reasons that someone who looks masculine to you

181
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
could need to use a particular restroom.

182
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And this brings us to the next argument.

183
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Genitals are out, I think we can all agree,

184
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
so let's consider what a particular person looks like to you.

185
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
We can't usually see genitals,

186
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,000
but we can see gendered clothing, makeup, fashion choices, jewelry, hairstyles, and so on.

187
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So someone might say,

188
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,000
okay, well, if I reckon someone looks enough like my idea of what a particular gender should look like,

189
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
then they're cool to go into that gender's spaces.

190
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So you might say Michael Hughes gets to use the man's toilets because he looks like a man to me.

191
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I guess this is an example of what Philosophy Tube might call a your dad opinion right there.

192
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You know, it's an attempt at being reasonable that falls apart once you start to actually think about it.

193
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You see, the big issue with this line of thinking is that it's so subjective.

194
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Each person's understanding of what a particular gender looks like is unique to them, to some extent, anyway,

195
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
and it also varies culture to culture and over time within those cultures.

196
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,000
In certain places and times in history, for instance, a woman wearing trousers would be considered a ludicrous, ridiculous thing,

197
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
whereas today, in the West, it's a completely normal, uninteresting thing.

198
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You know, being objective is an impossible task here.

199
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Any imagined attempt to lock in a single society-wide idea of what a particular gender looks like

200
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
would quickly fall afoul of changing fashions and gender roles.

201
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Denying access to gendered spaces based on what amounts to fashion choices would, in effect, be by proxy

202
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,000
legislating what clothes people of particular genders are allowed to wear, which seems like kind of a step backwards there.

203
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
The inescapably subjective nature of this way of determining gender doesn't just hurt trans people either.

204
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
There's all kinds of folks out there with all kinds of body shapes and haircuts and fashions

205
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
who shouldn't have to deal with the indignity of some random twerp deciding they don't look right

206
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
and kicking up a fuss, you know, when they're just trying to use the bathroom or whatever else.

207
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And there's various news stories I could mention here.

208
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
A Connecticut cis woman was mistaken for a trans woman in a Walmart bathroom and was then verbally abused.

209
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
In Texas, a man followed a cis woman into the women's bathroom

210
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
because, according to him, she dresses like a man.

211
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You know, a man following a woman into the women's toilets

212
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
because he's concerned about men going into the women's toilets. That makes sense, doesn't it?

213
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:57,000
In Florida, of course, a cis grandmother was mistaken as trans and accidentally jailed in an all-male prison.

214
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And I say mistaken there, but it appears from reading that news story

215
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
to be a case of someone being deliberately mistaken in order to hurt someone else.

216
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Sort of weaponized misgendering there, which is something we need to be concerned about happening, clearly.

217
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Now, I don't want these chumps to be the ones deciding which gendered spaces other people should be using

218
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
because they're clearly terrible at it.

219
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
However, if we say that judging people based on genitals comes with a ton of problems

220
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
and judging people based on appearances comes with a ton of problems,

221
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
how are we supposed to determine what gender someone is with regards to them accessing gendered spaces?

222
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
All our answers thus far have been flawed.

223
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Well, how about we consider going by what they tell you they are?

224
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You know, consider respecting what you're told when someone tells you what gender they are.

225
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Now, this is my actual opinion of what is both the correct and most sensible thing to do, for the record,

226
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
but let's have a talk about it all the same.

227
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
So, the question of self-identification has been discussed a fair bit in the UK of late.

228
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,000
There was recently a consultation on possible reforms that could be made to the Gender Recognition Act of 2004.

229
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Currently, the UK legally recognises trans people as their gender if they have a gender recognition certificate,

230
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
which requires a long and difficult bureaucratic process to acquire.

231
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It involves living as the gender for two years, medical diagnoses for gender dysphoria,

232
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
and, amazingly, for someone who's married, spousal approval.

233
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So, it seems sensible to want to maybe streamline this process a little bit,

234
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
make it like changing your name or something like that, you know.

235
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That's something we should all have the right to determine ourselves, after all.

236
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You pay a small fee, hopefully small, anyway.

237
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You file a thing with a court, you wait a minute, and there you go, you've got a new name.

238
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Why shouldn't changing your legal gender be at least as easy as that?

239
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You know, is there anything we need to be concerned about here?

240
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
That's the segue into the concerns section of my video, folks.

241
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And for examples of said concerns, we're gonna take a look at those Guardian articles here.

242
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
First off, on the 14th of October of last year,

243
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
the Guardian published an article titled,

244
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Women's Groups Claim Silencing on Transgender Concerns.

245
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So, here we are then.

246
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Let's read some relevant sections of this article and get at those concerns.

247
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Nearly 200 prominent figures have signed an open letter raising concerns

248
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
that public and private bodies are helping close down discussion about government plans

249
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
and make it easier for trans people to have their preferred gender legally recognized.

250
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
A government consultation on reforming the 2004 Gender Recognition Act closes at the end of the week.

251
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
When she launched it last month, the Minister for Women and Equality, Penny Mordant,

252
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
said the government particularly wanted to hear from women's groups

253
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
who we know have expressed some concerns about the implications of our proposals.

254
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But according to the letter's signatories,

255
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
there have been a series of attempts to close down discussion among women about GRA reform.

256
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Those campaigning for greater transgender rights say that the reforms to the act are long overdue.

257
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,000
But Woman's Place UK has a number of concerns, including how they might affect women-only spaces.

258
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
The group calls for a respectful and evidence-based discussion about the impact of the proposed changes.

259
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So, okay.

260
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
This article, despite having transgender concerns in the title and mentioning them several times,

261
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
doesn't actually contain any of those concerns.

262
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It just alludes to the fact that there are concerns that exist without saying exactly what they are.

263
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And this should be a red flag.

264
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
But let's leave that there for a moment and move on to the next article,

265
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
from the 17th of October, three days after the previous article.

266
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And this is, transgender law reform has overlooked women's rights, say MPs.

267
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So perhaps we'll find our concerns in here.

268
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Senior MPs have called on the government to reconsider plans to make it easier for trans people

269
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
to have their preferred gender legally recognized to ensure the reforms are not detrimental to women's rights.

270
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Detrimental how, you might be wondering?

271
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Well, this article doesn't say.

272
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
The MP for Luz, who sat on the inquiry, said she was writing to the Minister for Women and Equality, Penny Mordant,

273
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
to ask her to extend the consultation on the Gender Recognition Act to ensure that women's voices were heard.

274
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
What were those women's voices saying?

275
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Something, presumably, but we're not gonna say here.

276
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
She said MPs should have more time to assess the concerns of women's groups about the changes,

277
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
such as how they might affect women-only spaces.

278
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And how exactly are they going to affect the women-only spaces?

279
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Again, we're not gonna say.

280
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I think it's a fair comment that women's groups do not feel that they've had their voice heard.

281
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And what are they saying, though?

282
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
We don't know.

283
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Do you see the pattern here?

284
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Nowhere in either of these articles, which are not news articles, by the way,

285
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
they're proxy opinion pieces written by transphobes using the Guardian as a mouthpiece,

286
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,000
nowhere in these articles are these supposedly very important concerns just, like, said.

287
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
These are articles about the fact that concerns exist, that don't mention what they are.

288
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And we have to wonder, why not?

289
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You know, if I had a lot of very important concerns, and also the ear of a national newspaper,

290
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I'd be using that platform to get those concerns out there.

291
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You know, nobody will let me express my concerns, I said to the reporter,

292
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
who reported it in the national newspaper.

293
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
This doesn't make sense on the surface.

294
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Now, spoilers. The truth is, their concerns are a load of hateful shite and make them look like bigots.

295
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So instead of arguing those concerns, they just repeatedly state that there are concerns that exist,

296
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
which, by virtue of being completely indistinct, are therefore possibly valid.

297
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You know, you can't get proven wrong if you never actually say what you think. Taps forehead.

298
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,000
This is a tactic used to slow down discussions and ensure there is drawn out and unproductive as possible.

299
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You know, I've got concerns about desegregation, I've got concerns about marriage equality,

300
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I've got concerns about trans people. What are those concerns?

301
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Well, it doesn't really matter, does it? And I'd rather not say, honestly.

302
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
All that matters is that I have concerns, and that you get told about that constantly.

303
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And if you get sick of my bullshit time-wasting tactics and tell me to shut up, well, you're harassing me.

304
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Just for having possibly legitimate concerns.

305
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And you know, I was just about to say my concerns as well, but then I got harassed.

306
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And now the conversation is about how toxic the conversation has become.

307
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
That should kill fifteen minutes. Filibuster bigotry, this is.

308
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Now, the closest the Guardian comes to stating an actual concern comes in the When Rights Collide article

309
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
that earned them a scolding from their US colleagues.

310
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And it's where they say,

311
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:04,000
"'Women's concerns about sharing dormitories or changing rooms with male-bodied people must be taken seriously.

312
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
These are not just questions of safety, but of dignity and fairness.'"

313
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Again, what the actual concern is here is fairly indistinct.

314
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
But it seems to be that if women, and read cis women there, of course,

315
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
are forced to share spaces with what are described here as male-bodied people,

316
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
then something unsafe or undignified or unfair will happen.

317
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And there's a fair bit to talk about here.

318
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
First off, though the Guardian puts quotation marks around the term male-bodied,

319
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
they're not actually quoting a real person or organization here.

320
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
They're just trying to say it without saying it, you know.

321
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
We wouldn't say this, of course,

322
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
but a hypothetical concerned woman we just made up might say it,

323
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
and she must be taken seriously.

324
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
This concern has at its root the belief that men are naturally and intrinsically dangerous,

325
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
and also the belief that trans women aren't really women and are in fact men,

326
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
and therefore are dangerous.

327
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
These opinions are just being expressed here in language which is being gauged

328
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
as more socially acceptable than just stating it outright.

329
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
The rights of cis women are being ranked as more important than the rights of trans women here.

330
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Because someone might be concerned that something unsafe may occur

331
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
if trans women share spaces with cis women,

332
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
that's apparently enough justification to engage in collective punishment of all trans women

333
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
by denying them access to the spaces and services they need.

334
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And not just trans women, but other trans people too, who exist, you know.

335
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Now the Guardian dodges around discussing the rights of trans men in particular

336
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
with the following sentence in brackets.

337
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
The rights of trans men are far less controversial because they do not, while transitioning,

338
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
gain access to spaces designed to protect a disadvantaged group.

339
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And trans men are not mentioned again in the article.

340
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Now, this is a terrible oversight, because trans men's rights and trans women's rights

341
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
are not entirely separate entities.

342
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
It doesn't matter how controversial or not the Guardian has decided that the rights of trans men are.

343
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
They will be equally affected by any proposed changes to laws relating to gender identity.

344
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Also, there's something else to be mentioned here.

345
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
The Guardian article mainly talks about trans women,

346
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
and only mentions trans men in that rather dismissive aside,

347
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
but it doesn't consider other trans people.

348
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It's enforcing a binary system there, a trans binary system, to reflect a cis binary system.

349
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
However, for example, there are non-binary people,

350
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
some of whom consider themselves trans and some who don't, I understand,

351
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,000
but all of whom would also be hurt by any new law designed to hurt trans women specifically.

352
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
No change to a law is going to say trans women aren't allowed in women's spaces,

353
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,000
but other trans and non-gender conforming people, you can do whatever you want, is it?

354
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Another concern possibly alluded to in the Guardian with the phrase questions of safety there,

355
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
is the idea that if we allow people to legally self-identify their gender,

356
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
certain cis men will start deceptively declaring themselves trans in order to go into women's spaces,

357
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
and then go on to sexually harass or assault someone or something.

358
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:23,000
It means any man who says he is a woman can enter a woman's locker room, dressing room, or bathroom at any time.

359
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Even convicted sex offenders.

360
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And I've seen this brought up a few times in conversations about bathroom bills in the States,

361
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
and it's never made much sense to me.

362
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Firstly, there are already laws against harassing or assaulting someone,

363
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
and I doubt that any criminal who is willing to risk breaking those

364
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
is going to be all that put off by the comparatively minor crime of using the wrong bathroom.

365
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
It doesn't seem very realistic, does it?

366
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Secondly, even if there was a creepy guy planning to use gender identity deceptively in order to access women's spaces,

367
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
he could do so no matter what the laws relating to gender identity actually were.

368
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Consider a society which determines access to gendered spaces by genitals, for instance.

369
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
A creepy cis guy there could simply go into the women's bathroom and say,

370
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Again, unless you're planning to have a doctor checking medical records posted outside the door of every toilet,

371
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
there will be no way to know.

372
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Also, we don't even have to consider trans people at all here.

373
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,000
We can simply imagine a cis man who declares himself to not be a trans woman, but a cis woman,

374
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
and then going into a woman's restroom and doing whatever creepy thing.

375
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
That is a possibility regardless of what the laws are.

376
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Not that anyone who is sneaking into toilets to do creepy things is concerned about breaking laws either way, of course.

377
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
You know, any extra used the wrong bathroom charge is going to appear inconsequential next to the charge

378
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
for whatever creepy thing they were doing that got them arrested in the first place.

379
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
So, considering all that, I don't think this concern makes much sense personally.

380
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,000
The theoretical possibility of someone being harmed is being used here as a tactic to halt action,

381
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:20,000
even though the way in which they would be harmed is already illegal and entirely possible regardless of any proposed changes to the law.

382
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
And we can counter it by hypothesizing the opposite.

383
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Consider a trans woman who is prevented from entering a gendered space, like a woman's shelter or something,

384
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
and then suffers abuse or harm because of that.

385
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
That's entirely possible, isn't it?

386
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And it seems a lot more likely than our imagined creepy trickster, to be honest.

387
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I'd like to consider a variant of the trolley problem here. We all know that, right?

388
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
There's a runaway trolley moving towards some people tied up on the tracks.

389
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
You're standing next to a lever that can divert the train onto a track with one person on it.

390
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Do you pull the lever?

391
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And then follows a philosophical conversation about one's responsibility to reduce harm, and so on.

392
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So, here's my variant. Consider a trolley that's moving towards some people tied up on the tracks.

393
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,000
You're standing next to a lever that can divert the train onto an empty track with no one on it.

394
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Now, pulling the lever seems like the sensible option, obviously.

395
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
However, before you can pull the lever, someone comes up to you and says,

396
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Hold up there a second. I've got some concerns about your course of action.

397
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:32,000
What if we divert the train onto the empty track, but then afterwards, down the line, a murderer pushes someone in front of it?

398
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Now, that is a possibility there.

399
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,000
That's a theoretical possibility of harm as an indirect result of your actions, to some extent.

400
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
No matter how well-intentioned your actions were.

401
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Now, this concerned citizen would say, I have nothing against those people tied up on the tracks.

402
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I don't want them hurt. I just want to have a conversation.

403
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I want to make sure we fully consider all options here.

404
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I want to ensure all voices are listened to.

405
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Every concern must be heard.

406
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,000
You know, at which point the trolley has long run over the people on the other track because of their delaying tactics.

407
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
You can't stop the trolley of reality.

408
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Delaying, or even rolling back, trans rights ensures people are definitely going to get hurt.

409
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And they're real, not theoretical people who will definitely, not maybe, be hurt by a direct, not indirect, result of your actions

410
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
because of you, not an imagined, ill-intentioned criminal we had to cynically invent

411
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,000
in order to make the logical and sensible cause of action seem more dangerous than it actually is.

412
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So, it's about time for me to wrap up here, but I'd like to mention a few things before I go.

413
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Firstly, what we've done today is not, I feel I should mention, prove trans people are valid by some sort of logical process.

414
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:05,000
The purpose of going through these arguments was to prove that the arguments were flawed, not to pass some sort of moral judgement.

415
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
You should respect trans people even if you disagree with everything I've said today.

416
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
So, there's that.

417
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And next up, I've avoided talking about what lies behind all of the delaying tactics, concern trolling, and vague euphemisms.

418
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And that's outright hateful bigotry, which exists and is happening.

419
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Beyond the day-to-day, individual-level harassment that trans people have to deal with,

420
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:38,000
there are organized groups working on campaigns aimed at making their lives harder on a larger scale.

421
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
In Liverpool, where I live, there was a campaign to put up a bunch of penis stickers for some reason.

422
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Images were also shared on Twitter of these stickers being put on the sign for a Scottish feminist organization.

423
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Topshop, for some reason.

424
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And also above the sign for Stonewall, which is an LGBT charity with the slogan,

425
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Acceptance Without Exception.

426
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And that's a revealing contrast of slogans there.

427
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:11,000
The transphobe community in the UK has recently found something of a champion in TV comedy writer Graham Linehan,

428
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
who I won't dwell on personally here because he frankly isn't worth the time.

429
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I mention him only because he provides a good example of how organized transphobic hatred in the UK can have real damaging effects.

430
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:31,000
There's a UK charity called Mermaids that, among other things, provides support for young trans people and their families.

431
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:38,000
It does important work and was recognized for that recently by being awarded a grant from the UK's Big Lottery Fund.

432
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Now, Graham Linehan wasn't too happy about that, apparently, because he took to Mumsnet to complain about it,

433
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
and encouraged that community to write to the Big Lottery Fund in an effort to have their grant rescinded.

434
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
In response to this, the Big Lottery Fund decided to undertake a review of the grant,

435
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:02,000
and it's unclear at this time whether the Mermaids grant will still be awarded, though I, of course, hope it will be.

436
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Now, this sort of terrible thing, you know, campaigning to defund the children's charity,

437
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
is what lies behind all of the bullshit concern trolling.

438
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:19,000
And speaking just as a UK resident, I guess, I am disgusted that this sort of thing is going on in my country.

439
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
It's shameful, completely.

440
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:29,000
With that in mind, and also because I'm uncomfortable with the idea of solely benefiting financially from talking about trans issues as a cis man,

441
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I'm gonna be donating half of the proceeds from this video to Mermaids.

442
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I'll be making that donation in around four weeks' time, in early February,

443
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
once everything's been processed and I can get an exact amount for how much this video made.

444
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I'll also put a link to their website below if you feel like donating yourself,

445
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
to spite all of those horrible people trying to get their funding pulled.

446
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
And also to help the kids, I guess.

447
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:03,000
So best case scenario is, Mermaids hopefully still get the grant, and they also get a little extra on top from us.

448
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Let's show all the transphobes out there that we are capable of caring more than they do.

449
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Thanks a lot for watching, folks.

450
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And thank you in particular today to the kind people who proofread this script for me and provided very useful notes.

451
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,000
If I said anything clever in here at all, you can probably safely assume it was a suggestion from one of them.

452
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Thanks, as always, to all of my supporters over on Patreon.

453
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Now then, there was a bit of an issue with the credits of the first version of this video.

454
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I usually release an early version of a video for patrons, you see.

455
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Anyway, the credits were messed up on that one, and we left some people out.

456
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Now hopefully that issue has been fixed for this version,

457
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
and everyone who should be in the credits should now be in the credits.

458
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
So crisis averted, hopefully.

459
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And if you'd like to check out my Patreon and possibly be witness to future errors I make, I'll put a link below.

460
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
There's also links to my Twitter and Curious Cat accounts if you'd like to give me a follow or ask me a question.

461
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Righty-o, folks. I'll see you next time.
