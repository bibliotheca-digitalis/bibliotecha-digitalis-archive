0	6400	Hello, everyone. Today we're going to be talking about transphobia and particularly British transphobia,
6400	10400	and even more particularly, transphobia in the British press.
10400	15200	That's right, the UK press seems to have a problem with trans people.
15200	21200	Now, the tabloid press obviously does, but since those papers are seemingly written by and for
21200	28000	the absolute worst, most vile people ever to have existed on planet Earth, that's to be somewhat expected.
28000	34000	No, today I'd like to talk about that bastion of fair-weather progressivism, The Guardian,
34000	40000	which, for all the blessedly non-British viewers out there, is our leading centre-left newspaper.
40000	45000	Surely, The Guardian can be counted on to stand up for minority rights.
45000	47000	A wrong person might say.
47000	52000	And I'll quote here from an article written on the 2nd of November of last year, entitled
52000	57000	Why We Take Issue with The Guardian's Stance on Trans Rights in the UK.
57000	62000	The Trump administration is trying to define transgender people out of existence.
62000	66000	Last month, the New York Times reported that the US government is seeking to deny trans people
66000	73000	the most basic recognition by claiming that gender is determined by the genitals that a person is born with.
73000	77000	The leaked memo sparked outrage and fear about a policy that could cost lives
77000	81000	and prevent millions of Americans from existing in public spaces.
81000	85000	The Guardian in the US is committed to covering this important civil rights fight,
85000	90000	but when the time came for us to report on Trump's attacks, we encountered problems.
90000	92000	Some trans people wouldn't talk to us.
92000	99000	That's because days earlier, The Guardian published an editorial that we believe promoted transphobic viewpoints,
99000	105000	including some of the same assertions about gender that US politicians are citing in their push to eliminate trans rights.
105000	112000	Guardian journalists in the US had no input in the editorial, which we felt was misplaced and misguided,
112000	120000	and nearly all reporters and editors from our New York, Washington DC, and California offices wrote to UK editors with our concerns.
120000	127000	So then, the UK Guardian has been very naughty and has had to be told off by the Americans. How shameful.
127000	132000	Now, the editorial that inspired this response is from the 17th of October and is titled
132000	137000	The Guardian View on the Gender Recognition Act Where Rights Collide,
137000	145000	and is actually only one in a recent series of fairly rubbish, to put it lightly, articles about trans people from The Guardian.
145000	147000	But we'll get to those in a little while.
147000	150000	This particular article makes the case that, quote,
150000	155000	Transphobia must be opposed, but misogyny, too, must be challenged.
155000	158000	Gender identity does not cancel out sex.
158000	166000	Women's oppression by men has a physical basis, and to deny the relevance of biology when considering sexual inequality is a mistake.
166000	169000	The struggle for women's empowerment is ongoing.
169000	173000	Reproductive freedoms are under threat, and the Me Too campaign faces a backlash.
173000	182000	Women's concerns about sharing dormitories or changing rooms with male-bodied people must be taken seriously.
182000	187000	These are not just questions of safety, but of dignity and fairness.
187000	192000	Now, we're going to talk more about this article later, so I won't dwell on it too much right now,
192000	199000	but with regards to the argument that cis women's concerns about sharing spaces with trans women must be taken seriously,
199000	205000	one possible line of response does immediately jump to mind, and that's historical comparison.
205000	211000	Consider an article that, discussing desegregation, say, made the case that
211000	216000	white people's concerns about sharing spaces with black people must be taken seriously.
216000	219000	Or responding to a gay rights issue with
219000	224000	straight people's concerns about sharing spaces with gay people must be taken seriously.
224000	228000	Now, I realize that there are people around today still making those arguments.
228000	233000	I don't mean to make it seem like those issues are solely in the distant past, because they aren't.
233000	238000	Anyone old enough to remember the Don't Ask, Don't Tell debates in the United States
238000	244000	might remember a fair bit of fearmongering about gay people in showers and locker rooms, for instance.
244000	251000	However, it is hard to imagine our liberal pals over at The Guardian making those kinds of arguments today.
251000	256000	They would, in fact, rightly condemn any politician that made those remarks.
256000	261000	So why do we see them making the same arguments with regards to trans people?
261000	266000	Is there something unique about the current situation, or is the comparison there a valid one?
266000	269000	And that's what we're going to be talking about today.
269000	272000	Before we get to that, though, I'd just like to make a few things clear.
272000	279000	Firstly, I'm a cis man, and I am by no means an expert on trans issues, or anything else, actually,
279000	282000	and nor am I trying to present myself as such.
282000	287000	If I know anything at all, it's from listening to trans people, reading the things they've written,
287000	294000	watching videos they've made, and talking to my trans friends, some of whom helped me write this video, actually.
294000	297000	What I'm providing here is a platform and a voice.
297000	302000	I'm not trying to speak for anyone or claim I'm some authority on anything, because I'm not.
302000	306000	And I'll include a list of videos by trans people in the description of this video
306000	311000	that cover similar topics to what I'm going to be discussing today, but better than I can.
311000	313000	So go and check those out.
313000	318000	My aim with this video is to reach out to some of my fellow cis folk who might have,
318000	324000	unconsciously even, absorbed some transphobic rhetoric from the bigoted mess that is the British press,
325000	330000	or anyone who might have encountered some of these concerns about trans people out in the wild.
330000	335000	You know, the people who might watch me, but who haven't heard a trans person say these things before
335000	337000	is a guess who I'm aiming this video at.
337000	343000	Now, to understand the conversation surrounding the Guardian's concerns about gendered spaces, however,
343000	347000	and to avoid getting lost somewhere later and having to double back,
347000	350000	we're gonna have to start out with some basic concepts here.
350000	353000	And so we'll begin by asking a simple question.
353000	356000	What makes someone a particular gender?
356000	361000	And there's a lot of bad answers to this question, so let's take a look at some of those.
361000	365000	And first up is the most basic and crude of answers.
365000	367000	What bits they've got.
367000	371000	That's right, if you've got a penis and testicles, you're a man.
371000	374000	If you've got a vagina and ovaries, you're a woman.
374000	378000	So that's a direct one-to-one sex and gender correlation there.
378000	381000	Nothing could be simpler than that, right?
381000	385000	Now, my response to this genital-based answer is twofold.
385000	388000	Firstly, it isn't particularly helpful.
388000	392000	Speaking for myself here, but genitals tend not to come into play
392000	395000	in the majority of my interactions with other people day-to-day,
395000	398000	if you can believe such a thing.
398000	401000	I don't know what kind of lives you're all leading, of course,
401000	406000	but I'm personally not peeking down people's trousers to confirm what they've got in there.
406000	409000	It's an inconsequential, unknown quantity.
409000	414000	The vast majority of the time, anyway, and thus not much use to us.
414000	417000	The other problem with this answer, in addition to it being unhelpful,
417000	420000	is that it isn't actually true.
420000	424000	Before we even talk about trans people or questions of self-identification,
424000	430000	conflating gender with genitalia in an exclusively binary way simply doesn't work.
430000	432000	And let's do a thought experiment here.
432000	435000	Now, I personally have a penis.
435000	438000	And you're just gonna have to take my word for that, I'm afraid.
438000	442000	Okay, so let's assume I have a penis.
442000	447000	Say I'm out and about one day and get into some sort of unfortunate situation
447000	453000	and it comes off, you know, a car accident, say, or some sort of misjudged boast.
453000	457000	So now I've no longer got a penis, or testicles even, let's say.
457000	460000	But that doesn't change my gender, does it?
460000	462000	I'd still be a man, you know.
462000	465000	We wouldn't all start calling me she because of that, would we?
465000	468000	I'd still identify as and present as a man.
468000	471000	I wouldn't have grown ovaries or something.
471000	473000	You know, you hopefully see my point here.
473000	476000	Accidents, injuries, diseases.
476000	482000	You know, there's plenty of reasons why someone might have to, for instance, have something removed.
482000	487000	And if that's the something we're using to determine which binary gender they belong to,
487000	489000	we're kinda screwed there.
489000	493000	Okay, so we'll leave that argument behind and we'll go on to the next level.
493000	495000	So, someone might say in response,
495000	501000	I acknowledge that what genitals someone has currently doesn't actually determine their gender,
501000	506000	but what if we say it's what genitals someone was born with that determines your gender?
506000	512000	Gender is still tied to genitals, just not necessarily your current genitals, you see.
512000	518000	This is the worrisome definition that we saw the US Guardian staff be rightfully concerned about earlier.
518000	521000	Now, this argument shares a problem with the previous one.
521000	525000	Outside of the person in question, their parents, and their doctors,
525000	530000	not many other people day to day are gonna know what genitals someone was born with.
530000	533000	So with regards to access to gendered spaces,
533000	539000	unless you're planning to have people submit a full medical history in order to go into a public restroom, say,
539000	542000	this way of defining things is similarly unhelpful.
542000	547000	Another problem with this argument is that it completely ignores the experience of intersex people.
548000	553000	Not everyone is born with sexual characteristics that neatly fall into one of two camps.
553000	556000	There are some people born with ambiguous genitalia.
556000	560000	There are people with both testicular and ovarian tissue.
560000	567000	And on a genetic level, there are female people with chromosomes normally associated with being male, and vice versa.
567000	571000	Now, obviously, this is a video talking about trans people and not intersex people,
571000	577000	but I mention them here to show an example of another group of people who would be hurt by legislative attempts
577000	580000	to define gender as a strictly biological, binary thing.
580000	584000	Now, the response to mentioning intersex people is usually dismissive.
584000	588000	You know, well, there aren't many of those people, are there?
588000	593000	Which is wrong, for a start, because there's actually a lot more intersex people than you might expect.
593000	598000	There's that fun statistic that estimates intersex people are about as common as people with red hair.
598000	603000	Regardless, though, it wouldn't matter if there was just one intersex person on the planet.
603000	606000	It'd still be a valid way of being a person.
606000	610000	Ignoring intersex people or trying to downplay their existence is, in our case,
610000	614000	a way to enforce a binary system where one does not apply.
614000	617000	Because here's the thing about binary systems.
617000	619000	There's only two things.
619000	624000	Not usually two things, but also the occasional other thing.
624000	628000	You know, binary code is called that because there's just ones and zeros.
628000	633000	There isn't, like, a five or an eight from time to time, is there?
633000	637000	I believe bimodal is a more accurate term when talking about sex.
637000	643000	You know, there's two general peaks, but there's fuzzy edges and outliers and so on.
643000	647000	This intentional ignorance with regards to intersex people, you know,
647000	651000	thinking that humans are supposed to fall into one of two binary camps
651000	656000	and that anyone who doesn't is some sort of mistake who we can ignore for the sake of convenience,
656000	661000	actually reminds me of the old creationist misunderstanding of evolution, oddly enough.
661000	667000	As if there's some will that must be consciously designing humans to fit an ideal standard or something.
667000	672000	Also, even if there were a practical way to use what genitals someone was born with
672000	676000	to determine which gendered restroom they should go into today,
676000	680000	efforts to enforce this rule would quickly lead to situations like the following.
680000	685000	So, this chap here is Michael Hughes, a trans man from Minnesota.
685000	690000	Now, in response to so-called bathroom bills designed to force people to only use facilities
690000	696000	that match their assigned gender at birth, Michael Hughes posted a series of photographs of himself
696000	699000	looking very out of place in the women's toilets.
699000	701000	Now, this is ridiculous, clearly.
701000	705000	Legislation designed to allay bigoted fears about, quote,
705000	712000	men going into the ladies' toilets would lead to this guy having to go into the ladies' toilets.
712000	715000	Because if he went into the men's, he could be arrested.
715000	719000	Now, this is a poorly thought-out hypocrisy, clearly.
719000	723000	However, there's a fair bit more to be said about trans men's restroom issues here,
723000	728000	issues I didn't really know about until I started writing this video, actually.
728000	733000	It is easy to point to pictures of a big bearded tattooed guy in a women's restroom and say,
733000	740000	Ha, ha, there you go, transphobes, your hysteria about trans women has led to this situation.
740000	742000	How silly and hypocritical of you.
742000	746000	And that can be fun, you know, pointing out hypocrisy often is.
746000	750000	But we can find ourselves playing into a harmful narrative here,
750000	754000	and it's one of masculinity being inherently dangerous.
754000	758000	How we do public restrooms is often rather rubbish.
758000	764000	There can be facilities in women's restrooms, say, places to dispose of menstrual products,
764000	769000	or an adequate number of doored stalls for people who can't urinate standing up,
769000	772000	that often don't exist in the men's bathrooms.
772000	775000	Women aren't the only people to menstruate,
775000	781000	but their bathrooms are the places we as a society are expecting menstruation to be dealt with.
781000	785000	And that puts trans men here in a very awkward and unfortunate situation.
785000	787000	Their needs aren't being accommodated there.
787000	790000	So, you know, it's still okay to highlight the hypocrisy, I reckon,
790000	796000	but we should be careful to do it in a way that doesn't present masculinity as being inherently harmful.
796000	801000	There could be completely legitimate reasons that someone who looks masculine to you
801000	803000	could need to use a particular restroom.
803000	806000	And this brings us to the next argument.
806000	808000	Genitals are out, I think we can all agree,
808000	812000	so let's consider what a particular person looks like to you.
812000	814000	We can't usually see genitals,
814000	821000	but we can see gendered clothing, makeup, fashion choices, jewelry, hairstyles, and so on.
821000	822000	So someone might say,
822000	829000	okay, well, if I reckon someone looks enough like my idea of what a particular gender should look like,
829000	832000	then they're cool to go into that gender's spaces.
832000	838000	So you might say Michael Hughes gets to use the man's toilets because he looks like a man to me.
838000	844000	I guess this is an example of what Philosophy Tube might call a your dad opinion right there.
844000	850000	You know, it's an attempt at being reasonable that falls apart once you start to actually think about it.
850000	854000	You see, the big issue with this line of thinking is that it's so subjective.
854000	861000	Each person's understanding of what a particular gender looks like is unique to them, to some extent, anyway,
861000	866000	and it also varies culture to culture and over time within those cultures.
866000	873000	In certain places and times in history, for instance, a woman wearing trousers would be considered a ludicrous, ridiculous thing,
873000	878000	whereas today, in the West, it's a completely normal, uninteresting thing.
878000	881000	You know, being objective is an impossible task here.
881000	887000	Any imagined attempt to lock in a single society-wide idea of what a particular gender looks like
887000	891000	would quickly fall afoul of changing fashions and gender roles.
891000	897000	Denying access to gendered spaces based on what amounts to fashion choices would, in effect, be by proxy
897000	904000	legislating what clothes people of particular genders are allowed to wear, which seems like kind of a step backwards there.
904000	910000	The inescapably subjective nature of this way of determining gender doesn't just hurt trans people either.
910000	915000	There's all kinds of folks out there with all kinds of body shapes and haircuts and fashions
915000	920000	who shouldn't have to deal with the indignity of some random twerp deciding they don't look right
920000	924000	and kicking up a fuss, you know, when they're just trying to use the bathroom or whatever else.
924000	927000	And there's various news stories I could mention here.
927000	933000	A Connecticut cis woman was mistaken for a trans woman in a Walmart bathroom and was then verbally abused.
933000	937000	In Texas, a man followed a cis woman into the women's bathroom
937000	940000	because, according to him, she dresses like a man.
940000	944000	You know, a man following a woman into the women's toilets
944000	949000	because he's concerned about men going into the women's toilets. That makes sense, doesn't it?
949000	957000	In Florida, of course, a cis grandmother was mistaken as trans and accidentally jailed in an all-male prison.
957000	961000	And I say mistaken there, but it appears from reading that news story
961000	965000	to be a case of someone being deliberately mistaken in order to hurt someone else.
965000	972000	Sort of weaponized misgendering there, which is something we need to be concerned about happening, clearly.
972000	978000	Now, I don't want these chumps to be the ones deciding which gendered spaces other people should be using
978000	980000	because they're clearly terrible at it.
980000	984000	However, if we say that judging people based on genitals comes with a ton of problems
984000	988000	and judging people based on appearances comes with a ton of problems,
988000	994000	how are we supposed to determine what gender someone is with regards to them accessing gendered spaces?
994000	997000	All our answers thus far have been flawed.
997000	1003000	Well, how about we consider going by what they tell you they are?
1003000	1009000	You know, consider respecting what you're told when someone tells you what gender they are.
1009000	1015000	Now, this is my actual opinion of what is both the correct and most sensible thing to do, for the record,
1015000	1018000	but let's have a talk about it all the same.
1018000	1022000	So, the question of self-identification has been discussed a fair bit in the UK of late.
1022000	1029000	There was recently a consultation on possible reforms that could be made to the Gender Recognition Act of 2004.
1029000	1036000	Currently, the UK legally recognises trans people as their gender if they have a gender recognition certificate,
1036000	1040000	which requires a long and difficult bureaucratic process to acquire.
1040000	1046000	It involves living as the gender for two years, medical diagnoses for gender dysphoria,
1046000	1050000	and, amazingly, for someone who's married, spousal approval.
1050000	1055000	So, it seems sensible to want to maybe streamline this process a little bit,
1055000	1058000	make it like changing your name or something like that, you know.
1058000	1062000	That's something we should all have the right to determine ourselves, after all.
1062000	1065000	You pay a small fee, hopefully small, anyway.
1065000	1070000	You file a thing with a court, you wait a minute, and there you go, you've got a new name.
1070000	1075000	Why shouldn't changing your legal gender be at least as easy as that?
1075000	1078000	You know, is there anything we need to be concerned about here?
1078000	1082000	That's the segue into the concerns section of my video, folks.
1082000	1087000	And for examples of said concerns, we're gonna take a look at those Guardian articles here.
1087000	1090000	First off, on the 14th of October of last year,
1090000	1092000	the Guardian published an article titled,
1092000	1097000	Women's Groups Claim Silencing on Transgender Concerns.
1097000	1098000	So, here we are then.
1098000	1102000	Let's read some relevant sections of this article and get at those concerns.
1102000	1106000	Nearly 200 prominent figures have signed an open letter raising concerns
1106000	1111000	that public and private bodies are helping close down discussion about government plans
1111000	1116000	and make it easier for trans people to have their preferred gender legally recognized.
1116000	1122000	A government consultation on reforming the 2004 Gender Recognition Act closes at the end of the week.
1122000	1126000	When she launched it last month, the Minister for Women and Equality, Penny Mordant,
1126000	1129000	said the government particularly wanted to hear from women's groups
1129000	1134000	who we know have expressed some concerns about the implications of our proposals.
1134000	1136000	But according to the letter's signatories,
1136000	1141000	there have been a series of attempts to close down discussion among women about GRA reform.
1141000	1146000	Those campaigning for greater transgender rights say that the reforms to the act are long overdue.
1146000	1153000	But Woman's Place UK has a number of concerns, including how they might affect women-only spaces.
1153000	1159000	The group calls for a respectful and evidence-based discussion about the impact of the proposed changes.
1159000	1160000	So, okay.
1160000	1165000	This article, despite having transgender concerns in the title and mentioning them several times,
1165000	1168000	doesn't actually contain any of those concerns.
1168000	1175000	It just alludes to the fact that there are concerns that exist without saying exactly what they are.
1175000	1177000	And this should be a red flag.
1177000	1180000	But let's leave that there for a moment and move on to the next article,
1180000	1184000	from the 17th of October, three days after the previous article.
1184000	1189000	And this is, transgender law reform has overlooked women's rights, say MPs.
1189000	1192000	So perhaps we'll find our concerns in here.
1192000	1196000	Senior MPs have called on the government to reconsider plans to make it easier for trans people
1196000	1202000	to have their preferred gender legally recognized to ensure the reforms are not detrimental to women's rights.
1202000	1205000	Detrimental how, you might be wondering?
1205000	1207000	Well, this article doesn't say.
1207000	1213000	The MP for Luz, who sat on the inquiry, said she was writing to the Minister for Women and Equality, Penny Mordant,
1213000	1219000	to ask her to extend the consultation on the Gender Recognition Act to ensure that women's voices were heard.
1219000	1221000	What were those women's voices saying?
1221000	1225000	Something, presumably, but we're not gonna say here.
1225000	1230000	She said MPs should have more time to assess the concerns of women's groups about the changes,
1230000	1233000	such as how they might affect women-only spaces.
1233000	1237000	And how exactly are they going to affect the women-only spaces?
1237000	1239000	Again, we're not gonna say.
1239000	1244000	I think it's a fair comment that women's groups do not feel that they've had their voice heard.
1244000	1246000	And what are they saying, though?
1246000	1247000	We don't know.
1247000	1249000	Do you see the pattern here?
1249000	1254000	Nowhere in either of these articles, which are not news articles, by the way,
1254000	1259000	they're proxy opinion pieces written by transphobes using the Guardian as a mouthpiece,
1259000	1266000	nowhere in these articles are these supposedly very important concerns just, like, said.
1266000	1272000	These are articles about the fact that concerns exist, that don't mention what they are.
1272000	1274000	And we have to wonder, why not?
1274000	1279000	You know, if I had a lot of very important concerns, and also the ear of a national newspaper,
1279000	1283000	I'd be using that platform to get those concerns out there.
1283000	1288000	You know, nobody will let me express my concerns, I said to the reporter,
1288000	1291000	who reported it in the national newspaper.
1291000	1294000	This doesn't make sense on the surface.
1294000	1300000	Now, spoilers. The truth is, their concerns are a load of hateful shite and make them look like bigots.
1300000	1306000	So instead of arguing those concerns, they just repeatedly state that there are concerns that exist,
1306000	1311000	which, by virtue of being completely indistinct, are therefore possibly valid.
1311000	1316000	You know, you can't get proven wrong if you never actually say what you think. Taps forehead.
1316000	1323000	This is a tactic used to slow down discussions and ensure there is drawn out and unproductive as possible.
1323000	1328000	You know, I've got concerns about desegregation, I've got concerns about marriage equality,
1328000	1333000	I've got concerns about trans people. What are those concerns?
1333000	1337000	Well, it doesn't really matter, does it? And I'd rather not say, honestly.
1337000	1343000	All that matters is that I have concerns, and that you get told about that constantly.
1343000	1349000	And if you get sick of my bullshit time-wasting tactics and tell me to shut up, well, you're harassing me.
1349000	1353000	Just for having possibly legitimate concerns.
1353000	1357000	And you know, I was just about to say my concerns as well, but then I got harassed.
1357000	1361000	And now the conversation is about how toxic the conversation has become.
1361000	1366000	That should kill fifteen minutes. Filibuster bigotry, this is.
1366000	1372000	Now, the closest the Guardian comes to stating an actual concern comes in the When Rights Collide article
1372000	1375000	that earned them a scolding from their US colleagues.
1375000	1377000	And it's where they say,
1377000	1384000	"'Women's concerns about sharing dormitories or changing rooms with male-bodied people must be taken seriously.
1384000	1388000	These are not just questions of safety, but of dignity and fairness.'"
1388000	1392000	Again, what the actual concern is here is fairly indistinct.
1392000	1397000	But it seems to be that if women, and read cis women there, of course,
1397000	1402000	are forced to share spaces with what are described here as male-bodied people,
1402000	1407000	then something unsafe or undignified or unfair will happen.
1407000	1409000	And there's a fair bit to talk about here.
1409000	1414000	First off, though the Guardian puts quotation marks around the term male-bodied,
1414000	1418000	they're not actually quoting a real person or organization here.
1418000	1421000	They're just trying to say it without saying it, you know.
1421000	1423000	We wouldn't say this, of course,
1423000	1427000	but a hypothetical concerned woman we just made up might say it,
1427000	1429000	and she must be taken seriously.
1429000	1434000	This concern has at its root the belief that men are naturally and intrinsically dangerous,
1434000	1438000	and also the belief that trans women aren't really women and are in fact men,
1438000	1440000	and therefore are dangerous.
1440000	1444000	These opinions are just being expressed here in language which is being gauged
1444000	1448000	as more socially acceptable than just stating it outright.
1448000	1453000	The rights of cis women are being ranked as more important than the rights of trans women here.
1453000	1457000	Because someone might be concerned that something unsafe may occur
1457000	1459000	if trans women share spaces with cis women,
1459000	1465000	that's apparently enough justification to engage in collective punishment of all trans women
1465000	1469000	by denying them access to the spaces and services they need.
1469000	1475000	And not just trans women, but other trans people too, who exist, you know.
1475000	1479000	Now the Guardian dodges around discussing the rights of trans men in particular
1479000	1482000	with the following sentence in brackets.
1482000	1487000	The rights of trans men are far less controversial because they do not, while transitioning,
1487000	1491000	gain access to spaces designed to protect a disadvantaged group.
1491000	1493000	And trans men are not mentioned again in the article.
1493000	1499000	Now, this is a terrible oversight, because trans men's rights and trans women's rights
1499000	1501000	are not entirely separate entities.
1501000	1507000	It doesn't matter how controversial or not the Guardian has decided that the rights of trans men are.
1507000	1512000	They will be equally affected by any proposed changes to laws relating to gender identity.
1512000	1515000	Also, there's something else to be mentioned here.
1515000	1518000	The Guardian article mainly talks about trans women,
1518000	1521000	and only mentions trans men in that rather dismissive aside,
1521000	1524000	but it doesn't consider other trans people.
1524000	1531000	It's enforcing a binary system there, a trans binary system, to reflect a cis binary system.
1531000	1534000	However, for example, there are non-binary people,
1534000	1538000	some of whom consider themselves trans and some who don't, I understand,
1538000	1544000	but all of whom would also be hurt by any new law designed to hurt trans women specifically.
1544000	1549000	No change to a law is going to say trans women aren't allowed in women's spaces,
1549000	1555000	but other trans and non-gender conforming people, you can do whatever you want, is it?
1555000	1560000	Another concern possibly alluded to in the Guardian with the phrase questions of safety there,
1560000	1565000	is the idea that if we allow people to legally self-identify their gender,
1565000	1571000	certain cis men will start deceptively declaring themselves trans in order to go into women's spaces,
1571000	1576000	and then go on to sexually harass or assault someone or something.
1576000	1583000	It means any man who says he is a woman can enter a woman's locker room, dressing room, or bathroom at any time.
1583000	1585000	Even convicted sex offenders.
1585000	1590000	And I've seen this brought up a few times in conversations about bathroom bills in the States,
1590000	1592000	and it's never made much sense to me.
1592000	1596000	Firstly, there are already laws against harassing or assaulting someone,
1596000	1600000	and I doubt that any criminal who is willing to risk breaking those
1600000	1605000	is going to be all that put off by the comparatively minor crime of using the wrong bathroom.
1605000	1607000	It doesn't seem very realistic, does it?
1607000	1614000	Secondly, even if there was a creepy guy planning to use gender identity deceptively in order to access women's spaces,
1614000	1619000	he could do so no matter what the laws relating to gender identity actually were.
1619000	1625000	Consider a society which determines access to gendered spaces by genitals, for instance.
1625000	1629000	A creepy cis guy there could simply go into the women's bathroom and say,
1629000	1643000	Again, unless you're planning to have a doctor checking medical records posted outside the door of every toilet,
1643000	1645000	there will be no way to know.
1645000	1649000	Also, we don't even have to consider trans people at all here.
1649000	1656000	We can simply imagine a cis man who declares himself to not be a trans woman, but a cis woman,
1656000	1660000	and then going into a woman's restroom and doing whatever creepy thing.
1660000	1664000	That is a possibility regardless of what the laws are.
1664000	1671000	Not that anyone who is sneaking into toilets to do creepy things is concerned about breaking laws either way, of course.
1671000	1677000	You know, any extra used the wrong bathroom charge is going to appear inconsequential next to the charge
1677000	1681000	for whatever creepy thing they were doing that got them arrested in the first place.
1681000	1686000	So, considering all that, I don't think this concern makes much sense personally.
1686000	1692000	The theoretical possibility of someone being harmed is being used here as a tactic to halt action,
1692000	1700000	even though the way in which they would be harmed is already illegal and entirely possible regardless of any proposed changes to the law.
1700000	1703000	And we can counter it by hypothesizing the opposite.
1703000	1709000	Consider a trans woman who is prevented from entering a gendered space, like a woman's shelter or something,
1709000	1712000	and then suffers abuse or harm because of that.
1712000	1714000	That's entirely possible, isn't it?
1714000	1718000	And it seems a lot more likely than our imagined creepy trickster, to be honest.
1718000	1723000	I'd like to consider a variant of the trolley problem here. We all know that, right?
1723000	1727000	There's a runaway trolley moving towards some people tied up on the tracks.
1727000	1732000	You're standing next to a lever that can divert the train onto a track with one person on it.
1732000	1734000	Do you pull the lever?
1734000	1740000	And then follows a philosophical conversation about one's responsibility to reduce harm, and so on.
1740000	1746000	So, here's my variant. Consider a trolley that's moving towards some people tied up on the tracks.
1746000	1752000	You're standing next to a lever that can divert the train onto an empty track with no one on it.
1752000	1755000	Now, pulling the lever seems like the sensible option, obviously.
1755000	1760000	However, before you can pull the lever, someone comes up to you and says,
1760000	1765000	Hold up there a second. I've got some concerns about your course of action.
1765000	1772000	What if we divert the train onto the empty track, but then afterwards, down the line, a murderer pushes someone in front of it?
1772000	1774000	Now, that is a possibility there.
1774000	1781000	That's a theoretical possibility of harm as an indirect result of your actions, to some extent.
1781000	1784000	No matter how well-intentioned your actions were.
1784000	1790000	Now, this concerned citizen would say, I have nothing against those people tied up on the tracks.
1790000	1794000	I don't want them hurt. I just want to have a conversation.
1794000	1798000	I want to make sure we fully consider all options here.
1798000	1801000	I want to ensure all voices are listened to.
1801000	1804000	Every concern must be heard.
1804000	1810000	You know, at which point the trolley has long run over the people on the other track because of their delaying tactics.
1810000	1814000	You can't stop the trolley of reality.
1814000	1820000	Delaying, or even rolling back, trans rights ensures people are definitely going to get hurt.
1820000	1830000	And they're real, not theoretical people who will definitely, not maybe, be hurt by a direct, not indirect, result of your actions
1830000	1836000	because of you, not an imagined, ill-intentioned criminal we had to cynically invent
1836000	1842000	in order to make the logical and sensible cause of action seem more dangerous than it actually is.
1842000	1848000	So, it's about time for me to wrap up here, but I'd like to mention a few things before I go.
1848000	1857000	Firstly, what we've done today is not, I feel I should mention, prove trans people are valid by some sort of logical process.
1857000	1865000	The purpose of going through these arguments was to prove that the arguments were flawed, not to pass some sort of moral judgement.
1865000	1870000	You should respect trans people even if you disagree with everything I've said today.
1870000	1872000	So, there's that.
1872000	1880000	And next up, I've avoided talking about what lies behind all of the delaying tactics, concern trolling, and vague euphemisms.
1880000	1886000	And that's outright hateful bigotry, which exists and is happening.
1886000	1891000	Beyond the day-to-day, individual-level harassment that trans people have to deal with,
1891000	1898000	there are organized groups working on campaigns aimed at making their lives harder on a larger scale.
1898000	1904000	In Liverpool, where I live, there was a campaign to put up a bunch of penis stickers for some reason.
1904000	1910000	Images were also shared on Twitter of these stickers being put on the sign for a Scottish feminist organization.
1910000	1913000	Topshop, for some reason.
1913000	1918000	And also above the sign for Stonewall, which is an LGBT charity with the slogan,
1918000	1920000	Acceptance Without Exception.
1920000	1923000	And that's a revealing contrast of slogans there.
1923000	1931000	The transphobe community in the UK has recently found something of a champion in TV comedy writer Graham Linehan,
1931000	1935000	who I won't dwell on personally here because he frankly isn't worth the time.
1935000	1944000	I mention him only because he provides a good example of how organized transphobic hatred in the UK can have real damaging effects.
1944000	1951000	There's a UK charity called Mermaids that, among other things, provides support for young trans people and their families.
1951000	1958000	It does important work and was recognized for that recently by being awarded a grant from the UK's Big Lottery Fund.
1958000	1964000	Now, Graham Linehan wasn't too happy about that, apparently, because he took to Mumsnet to complain about it,
1964000	1970000	and encouraged that community to write to the Big Lottery Fund in an effort to have their grant rescinded.
1970000	1975000	In response to this, the Big Lottery Fund decided to undertake a review of the grant,
1975000	1982000	and it's unclear at this time whether the Mermaids grant will still be awarded, though I, of course, hope it will be.
1982000	1988000	Now, this sort of terrible thing, you know, campaigning to defund the children's charity,
1988000	1992000	is what lies behind all of the bullshit concern trolling.
1992000	1999000	And speaking just as a UK resident, I guess, I am disgusted that this sort of thing is going on in my country.
1999000	2001000	It's shameful, completely.
2001000	2009000	With that in mind, and also because I'm uncomfortable with the idea of solely benefiting financially from talking about trans issues as a cis man,
2009000	2014000	I'm gonna be donating half of the proceeds from this video to Mermaids.
2014000	2018000	I'll be making that donation in around four weeks' time, in early February,
2018000	2023000	once everything's been processed and I can get an exact amount for how much this video made.
2024000	2028000	I'll also put a link to their website below if you feel like donating yourself,
2028000	2032000	to spite all of those horrible people trying to get their funding pulled.
2032000	2035000	And also to help the kids, I guess.
2035000	2043000	So best case scenario is, Mermaids hopefully still get the grant, and they also get a little extra on top from us.
2043000	2048000	Let's show all the transphobes out there that we are capable of caring more than they do.
2048000	2050000	Thanks a lot for watching, folks.
2050000	2057000	And thank you in particular today to the kind people who proofread this script for me and provided very useful notes.
2057000	2063000	If I said anything clever in here at all, you can probably safely assume it was a suggestion from one of them.
2063000	2067000	Thanks, as always, to all of my supporters over on Patreon.
2067000	2072000	Now then, there was a bit of an issue with the credits of the first version of this video.
2072000	2076000	I usually release an early version of a video for patrons, you see.
2076000	2080000	Anyway, the credits were messed up on that one, and we left some people out.
2080000	2083000	Now hopefully that issue has been fixed for this version,
2083000	2087000	and everyone who should be in the credits should now be in the credits.
2087000	2090000	So crisis averted, hopefully.
2090000	2096000	And if you'd like to check out my Patreon and possibly be witness to future errors I make, I'll put a link below.
2096000	2102000	There's also links to my Twitter and Curious Cat accounts if you'd like to give me a follow or ask me a question.
2102000	2105000	Righty-o, folks. I'll see you next time.
