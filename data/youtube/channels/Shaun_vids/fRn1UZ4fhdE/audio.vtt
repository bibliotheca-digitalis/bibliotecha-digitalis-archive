00:00.000 --> 00:01.520
Hello, everyone.

00:01.520 --> 00:04.800
This video is a follow-up to my previous two videos

00:04.800 --> 00:10.920
about a particularly transphobic article published by BBC News on the 26th of October.

00:10.920 --> 00:14.600
If you haven't seen those, I'd encourage you to go and watch them first.

00:14.600 --> 00:20.600
But, before you go, in the second video, you'll see me say that the deadline to submit complaints

00:20.600 --> 00:23.960
about the article is about to pass, which it now has.

00:23.960 --> 00:27.160
But don't worry, anyone would still like to get involved.

00:27.400 --> 00:31.080
Do come back and watch this video afterwards, because, as it turns out,

00:31.080 --> 00:33.400
there's something new to complain about.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.360
How fun.

00:34.360 --> 00:39.760
So, then, the BBC has been sending out responses to various complaints that were escalated,

00:39.760 --> 00:44.120
and I'll say thank you again to everyone who shared those responses with me.

00:44.120 --> 00:47.400
Now, I've got a few news items to discuss today,

00:47.400 --> 00:50.520
but before we get to those, we should cover the BBC response

00:50.520 --> 00:53.480
and the next step in their complaints process.

00:53.480 --> 00:57.320
And allow me to share with you the response that they sent to me,

00:57.320 --> 01:01.400
which, amazingly enough, is even lazier than the last one they sent.

01:01.400 --> 01:05.880
And let me first quote from my escalated complaint, just to refresh our memories here.

01:05.880 --> 01:07.720
So, I said,

01:23.480 --> 01:30.120
and claims in the article that no high-profile trans women who have spoken about sex and relationships

01:30.120 --> 01:31.880
wanted to speak to her.

01:31.880 --> 01:35.400
This is not true, because she spoke to Chelsea Poe.

01:35.400 --> 01:40.920
I understand fully that the author can include or not include whoever she likes in her article

01:40.920 --> 01:43.560
and do not need this explained to me.

01:43.560 --> 01:45.560
I was getting a little snippy there.

01:45.560 --> 01:49.560
What she cannot do is make false claims about who was interviewed.

01:49.560 --> 01:54.680
The article's claim that no high-profile trans women who have spoken about sex and relationships

01:54.680 --> 01:57.480
wanted to speak to the author is provably false,

01:57.480 --> 02:01.240
and that is what I require a response from the BBC about.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.920
And, in response to this, the BBC replied,

02:05.400 --> 02:08.760
Thank you for getting in touch again to restate your complaint

02:08.760 --> 02:13.080
that an interview with Chelsea Poe did not feature in the article

02:13.080 --> 02:15.640
we're being pressured into sex by some trans women.

02:17.240 --> 02:20.440
They're just taking the piss at this point, aren't they?

02:20.440 --> 02:25.080
We can only reiterate that the choice of interviews which feature in the final version of an article

02:25.080 --> 02:28.440
is the legitimate expression of the editorial judgments, etc.

02:28.440 --> 02:32.520
So, they have again deliberately misunderstood what my complaint was.

02:32.520 --> 02:37.080
Because they have no way to respond legitimately without admitting fault,

02:37.080 --> 02:41.240
they've simply pretended I said something else and are responding to that instead.

02:41.960 --> 02:48.920
Now, the next step involves escalating complaints to the BBC's Executive Complaints Unit, or ECU.

02:48.920 --> 02:54.840
The email response you get from the BBC at this stage should include a link to contact the ECU,

02:54.840 --> 02:58.600
which will take you to a page where you can escalate your complaint again.

02:58.600 --> 03:02.920
Now, there isn't too much for me to add here in terms of arguments that could be made,

03:02.920 --> 03:07.560
as the BBC's overall tactic at this last stage has been to dig in their heels and

03:07.560 --> 03:12.440
repeat what they said in the first stage, even when it doesn't make any sense to do so,

03:12.440 --> 03:14.600
like with the response they sent to me.

03:14.600 --> 03:20.360
So, my ECU complaint is going to largely be me just restating what I said the last time

03:20.360 --> 03:24.680
and explaining why the BBC's response is, again, completely inadequate.

03:24.680 --> 03:27.720
And I'm sure your response will be generally similar to this,

03:27.720 --> 03:31.640
just tailored to statements made in your own individual complaint.

03:31.640 --> 03:35.560
Now, I'd advise that you draft these ECU complaints offline,

03:35.560 --> 03:38.280
because the webpage you reach with the link in the email

03:38.280 --> 03:41.720
will not let you edit your complaint once it's been submitted.

03:41.720 --> 03:45.000
Also, the first time I tried to submit my ECU complaint,

03:45.000 --> 03:47.720
I got an error message saying that something went wrong,

03:47.720 --> 03:51.960
so I had to start the process over by clicking the link in the email again,

03:51.960 --> 03:55.880
and it worked the second time, so watch out for that, I guess.

03:55.880 --> 03:58.920
So then, on to article news, I guess.

03:59.560 --> 04:03.800
Firstly, Chelsea Poe submitted a formal request to the BBC

04:03.800 --> 04:08.600
asking for the footage of her interview with the author of the article, Carolyn Lowbridge,

04:08.600 --> 04:11.880
but the BBC is choosing to withhold that footage,

04:11.880 --> 04:16.040
and it's not hard to imagine why they wouldn't want that interview out there.

04:16.040 --> 04:19.800
Right now, the BBC can just barely plausibly deny

04:19.800 --> 04:22.760
that they knew about the allegations against Lily Cade,

04:22.760 --> 04:25.160
assuming that we believe that Carolyn Lowbridge

04:25.160 --> 04:28.360
never did a basic internet search for Lily Cade's name,

04:28.360 --> 04:31.560
and that the BBC's very rigorous editorial process

04:31.560 --> 04:34.280
just so happened to miss her inclusion.

04:34.280 --> 04:37.320
The much worse story for the BBC would be that Lowbridge

04:37.320 --> 04:40.840
definitely knew about the allegations before publishing the article

04:40.840 --> 04:45.160
and chose to ignore them, which I believe is almost certainly true,

04:45.160 --> 04:49.960
but it is hard to prove definitively without footage of her being told, anyway.

04:49.960 --> 04:55.240
In other news, there was recently a protest held in front of the BBC's London headquarters

04:55.240 --> 04:59.320
in opposition to the BBC's recent transphobic news coverage,

04:59.320 --> 05:03.400
and it had a pretty amazing turnout, considering that it's winter,

05:03.400 --> 05:06.120
it was raining, and there's an ongoing pandemic.

05:06.760 --> 05:10.360
Various folks gave speeches criticizing the BBC's conduct,

05:10.360 --> 05:13.880
including, of course, the article that we've been concerned with.

05:13.880 --> 05:19.880
This protest was covered by several news websites, but it was not covered by the BBC.

05:19.880 --> 05:24.280
Now, if you haven't been paying attention, you might find that rather odd, right?

05:24.280 --> 05:27.080
A big part of the BBC's defense of the article

05:27.080 --> 05:31.800
and its wider coverage of trans issues is their claim of impartiality.

05:31.800 --> 05:37.160
Our commitment to impartiality means we have to cover every angle of a debate,

05:37.160 --> 05:41.240
even if it's unpopular, and even if people don't want to hear it.

05:41.240 --> 05:45.720
And this extends even to the point of platforming absurd conspiracy theorists

05:45.720 --> 05:48.040
like people who believe the Earth is flat.

05:48.040 --> 05:50.120
And this isn't me exaggerating here.

05:50.120 --> 05:53.880
The BBC's director of editorial policy recently stated that

05:53.880 --> 05:56.920
platforming flat Earth as is occasionally appropriate,

05:56.920 --> 06:01.640
and that, quote, if a lot of people believed in flat Earth, we'd need to address it more.

06:02.280 --> 06:08.600
Now, this is an outright abdication of what should be the most basic of journalistic principles,

06:08.600 --> 06:10.200
to report the truth.

06:10.760 --> 06:15.000
The BBC cannot be an impartial observer of public opinion here,

06:15.000 --> 06:18.200
because they also affect public opinion.

06:18.200 --> 06:21.640
If, just because some people believe the Earth is flat,

06:21.640 --> 06:26.600
the BBC started running flat Earth coverage, whatever that would look like,

06:26.600 --> 06:29.480
then they would cause more people to believe it.

06:29.480 --> 06:32.200
Because by being platformed on the BBC,

06:32.200 --> 06:36.600
flat Earth arguments would be given a weight that they otherwise are not.

06:36.600 --> 06:40.840
You can't be impartial when it comes to what is true.

06:40.840 --> 06:45.880
The Earth is not flat, regardless of how many people believe it to be.

06:45.880 --> 06:48.440
That's my hot take for the day there.

06:48.440 --> 06:52.280
And how far does this principle go, exactly?

06:52.280 --> 06:54.920
Some people think the Holocaust was a hoax.

06:54.920 --> 06:59.800
Some people think COVID vaccines contain microchips that control your brain.

06:59.800 --> 07:04.440
You know, is the BBC going to write articles uncritically sharing those views,

07:04.440 --> 07:07.160
just because some people believe them?

07:07.160 --> 07:12.440
Anyway, all that aside, we're left with the BBC's claim of impartiality.

07:12.440 --> 07:15.720
They cover every angle of a debate, so they say.

07:16.360 --> 07:22.280
So where, we can ask, is the coverage of the protest that took place right on their doorstep?

07:22.280 --> 07:27.800
After all, an anonymous self-selecting social media poll of less than a hundred people

07:27.800 --> 07:33.320
was considered important enough to get a several thousand word article on the BBC website.

07:33.320 --> 07:38.040
But a protest right outside their headquarters doesn't get mentioned at all.

07:38.040 --> 07:41.320
So what happened to showing every side of a debate?

07:41.320 --> 07:45.720
Because right now it looks like that excuse only runs in one direction.

07:45.720 --> 07:51.160
It looks like the BBC want to use impartiality as a smokescreen to platform bigotry,

07:51.160 --> 07:55.240
whereas protests against that bigotry get ignored.

07:55.240 --> 08:00.360
Now, I don't like this very much, and I want to do something about it.

08:00.360 --> 08:05.960
And what I'm going to do is, and we all know where this is going by now, don't we?

08:05.960 --> 08:08.520
I'm going to submit a complaint.

08:08.520 --> 08:11.800
Now, the deadline to complain about the article has passed,

08:11.800 --> 08:17.560
but the deadline to complain about the lack of BBC coverage of the protest has not passed.

08:17.560 --> 08:22.200
So here's what I, or we, if you feel so inclined, are going to do.

08:22.840 --> 08:26.280
I'm going to go to the BBC complaints page, linked below,

08:26.280 --> 08:30.120
click on make a complaint, where it says what is your complaint about.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.280
I'm going to select general BBC.

08:32.920 --> 08:35.720
Are you contacting us about a previous complaint?

08:35.720 --> 08:36.360
No.

08:36.360 --> 08:40.280
On the next page, where it says select the best category to describe your complaint,

08:40.280 --> 08:42.920
I'm going to select not enough coverage.

08:42.920 --> 08:45.160
And then I'm going to paste the text of my complaint

08:45.160 --> 08:48.760
about the lack of coverage of the protest, which I'll also share below.

08:49.560 --> 08:52.920
Now, I can't tell you what to do with your own time, of course,

08:52.920 --> 08:55.400
but here's a fun fact for you.

08:55.400 --> 09:00.600
The BBC's current complaint record is 110,000 complaints,

09:00.600 --> 09:04.760
which they received in response to their coverage of Prince Philip's death.

09:04.760 --> 09:08.840
Now, this video will probably get over that number of views,

09:08.840 --> 09:12.680
which means if everyone who's hearing this right now goes to the link below

09:12.680 --> 09:18.360
and submits a complaint, we'd break the BBC's all-time complaint record.

09:18.360 --> 09:21.240
Again, I'm not telling you what to do at all.

09:21.240 --> 09:22.280
It's up to you.

09:22.280 --> 09:24.840
I just thought that was kind of interesting.

09:25.480 --> 09:27.800
Anyway, that's all from me today, folks.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.240
I'll see you next time.
