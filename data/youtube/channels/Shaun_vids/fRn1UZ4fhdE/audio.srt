1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,800
This video is a follow-up to my previous two videos

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,920
about a particularly transphobic article published by BBC News on the 26th of October.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,600
If you haven't seen those, I'd encourage you to go and watch them first.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:20,600
But, before you go, in the second video, you'll see me say that the deadline to submit complaints

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,960
about the article is about to pass, which it now has.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,160
But don't worry, anyone would still like to get involved.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,080
Do come back and watch this video afterwards, because, as it turns out,

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,400
there's something new to complain about.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,360
How fun.

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,760
So, then, the BBC has been sending out responses to various complaints that were escalated,

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,120
and I'll say thank you again to everyone who shared those responses with me.

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,400
Now, I've got a few news items to discuss today,

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,520
but before we get to those, we should cover the BBC response

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,480
and the next step in their complaints process.

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,320
And allow me to share with you the response that they sent to me,

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,400
which, amazingly enough, is even lazier than the last one they sent.

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,880
And let me first quote from my escalated complaint, just to refresh our memories here.

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,720
So, I said,

20
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:30,120
and claims in the article that no high-profile trans women who have spoken about sex and relationships

21
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,880
wanted to speak to her.

22
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,400
This is not true, because she spoke to Chelsea Poe.

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,920
I understand fully that the author can include or not include whoever she likes in her article

24
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,560
and do not need this explained to me.

25
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,560
I was getting a little snippy there.

26
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,560
What she cannot do is make false claims about who was interviewed.

27
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,680
The article's claim that no high-profile trans women who have spoken about sex and relationships

28
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,480
wanted to speak to the author is provably false,

29
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,240
and that is what I require a response from the BBC about.

30
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,920
And, in response to this, the BBC replied,

31
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,760
Thank you for getting in touch again to restate your complaint

32
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,080
that an interview with Chelsea Poe did not feature in the article

33
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,640
we're being pressured into sex by some trans women.

34
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,440
They're just taking the piss at this point, aren't they?

35
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,080
We can only reiterate that the choice of interviews which feature in the final version of an article

36
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,440
is the legitimate expression of the editorial judgments, etc.

37
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,520
So, they have again deliberately misunderstood what my complaint was.

38
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,080
Because they have no way to respond legitimately without admitting fault,

39
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,240
they've simply pretended I said something else and are responding to that instead.

40
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:48,920
Now, the next step involves escalating complaints to the BBC's Executive Complaints Unit, or ECU.

41
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,840
The email response you get from the BBC at this stage should include a link to contact the ECU,

42
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,600
which will take you to a page where you can escalate your complaint again.

43
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,920
Now, there isn't too much for me to add here in terms of arguments that could be made,

44
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,560
as the BBC's overall tactic at this last stage has been to dig in their heels and

45
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,440
repeat what they said in the first stage, even when it doesn't make any sense to do so,

46
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,600
like with the response they sent to me.

47
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:20,360
So, my ECU complaint is going to largely be me just restating what I said the last time

48
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,680
and explaining why the BBC's response is, again, completely inadequate.

49
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,720
And I'm sure your response will be generally similar to this,

50
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,640
just tailored to statements made in your own individual complaint.

51
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,560
Now, I'd advise that you draft these ECU complaints offline,

52
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,280
because the webpage you reach with the link in the email

53
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,720
will not let you edit your complaint once it's been submitted.

54
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,000
Also, the first time I tried to submit my ECU complaint,

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,720
I got an error message saying that something went wrong,

56
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,960
so I had to start the process over by clicking the link in the email again,

57
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,880
and it worked the second time, so watch out for that, I guess.

58
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,920
So then, on to article news, I guess.

59
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,800
Firstly, Chelsea Poe submitted a formal request to the BBC

60
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,600
asking for the footage of her interview with the author of the article, Carolyn Lowbridge,

61
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,880
but the BBC is choosing to withhold that footage,

62
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,040
and it's not hard to imagine why they wouldn't want that interview out there.

63
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,800
Right now, the BBC can just barely plausibly deny

64
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,760
that they knew about the allegations against Lily Cade,

65
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,160
assuming that we believe that Carolyn Lowbridge

66
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,360
never did a basic internet search for Lily Cade's name,

67
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,560
and that the BBC's very rigorous editorial process

68
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,280
just so happened to miss her inclusion.

69
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,320
The much worse story for the BBC would be that Lowbridge

70
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,840
definitely knew about the allegations before publishing the article

71
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,160
and chose to ignore them, which I believe is almost certainly true,

72
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,960
but it is hard to prove definitively without footage of her being told, anyway.

73
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:55,240
In other news, there was recently a protest held in front of the BBC's London headquarters

74
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,320
in opposition to the BBC's recent transphobic news coverage,

75
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,400
and it had a pretty amazing turnout, considering that it's winter,

76
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,120
it was raining, and there's an ongoing pandemic.

77
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,360
Various folks gave speeches criticizing the BBC's conduct,

78
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,880
including, of course, the article that we've been concerned with.

79
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,880
This protest was covered by several news websites, but it was not covered by the BBC.

80
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,280
Now, if you haven't been paying attention, you might find that rather odd, right?

81
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,080
A big part of the BBC's defense of the article

82
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,800
and its wider coverage of trans issues is their claim of impartiality.

83
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,160
Our commitment to impartiality means we have to cover every angle of a debate,

84
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,240
even if it's unpopular, and even if people don't want to hear it.

85
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,720
And this extends even to the point of platforming absurd conspiracy theorists

86
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,040
like people who believe the Earth is flat.

87
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,120
And this isn't me exaggerating here.

88
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,880
The BBC's director of editorial policy recently stated that

89
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,920
platforming flat Earth as is occasionally appropriate,

90
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,640
and that, quote, if a lot of people believed in flat Earth, we'd need to address it more.

91
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,600
Now, this is an outright abdication of what should be the most basic of journalistic principles,

92
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,200
to report the truth.

93
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,000
The BBC cannot be an impartial observer of public opinion here,

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,200
because they also affect public opinion.

95
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,640
If, just because some people believe the Earth is flat,

96
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:26,600
the BBC started running flat Earth coverage, whatever that would look like,

97
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,480
then they would cause more people to believe it.

98
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,200
Because by being platformed on the BBC,

99
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,600
flat Earth arguments would be given a weight that they otherwise are not.

100
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,840
You can't be impartial when it comes to what is true.

101
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,880
The Earth is not flat, regardless of how many people believe it to be.

102
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,440
That's my hot take for the day there.

103
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,280
And how far does this principle go, exactly?

104
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,920
Some people think the Holocaust was a hoax.

105
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,800
Some people think COVID vaccines contain microchips that control your brain.

106
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,440
You know, is the BBC going to write articles uncritically sharing those views,

107
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,160
just because some people believe them?

108
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,440
Anyway, all that aside, we're left with the BBC's claim of impartiality.

109
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,720
They cover every angle of a debate, so they say.

110
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:22,280
So where, we can ask, is the coverage of the protest that took place right on their doorstep?

111
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,800
After all, an anonymous self-selecting social media poll of less than a hundred people

112
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,320
was considered important enough to get a several thousand word article on the BBC website.

113
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:38,040
But a protest right outside their headquarters doesn't get mentioned at all.

114
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,320
So what happened to showing every side of a debate?

115
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,720
Because right now it looks like that excuse only runs in one direction.

116
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,160
It looks like the BBC want to use impartiality as a smokescreen to platform bigotry,

117
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,240
whereas protests against that bigotry get ignored.

118
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,360
Now, I don't like this very much, and I want to do something about it.

119
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,960
And what I'm going to do is, and we all know where this is going by now, don't we?

120
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,520
I'm going to submit a complaint.

121
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,800
Now, the deadline to complain about the article has passed,

122
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,560
but the deadline to complain about the lack of BBC coverage of the protest has not passed.

123
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,200
So here's what I, or we, if you feel so inclined, are going to do.

124
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,280
I'm going to go to the BBC complaints page, linked below,

125
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,120
click on make a complaint, where it says what is your complaint about.

126
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,280
I'm going to select general BBC.

127
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,720
Are you contacting us about a previous complaint?

128
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,360
No.

129
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,280
On the next page, where it says select the best category to describe your complaint,

130
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,920
I'm going to select not enough coverage.

131
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,160
And then I'm going to paste the text of my complaint

132
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,760
about the lack of coverage of the protest, which I'll also share below.

133
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,920
Now, I can't tell you what to do with your own time, of course,

134
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,400
but here's a fun fact for you.

135
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,600
The BBC's current complaint record is 110,000 complaints,

136
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,760
which they received in response to their coverage of Prince Philip's death.

137
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,840
Now, this video will probably get over that number of views,

138
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,680
which means if everyone who's hearing this right now goes to the link below

139
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:18,360
and submits a complaint, we'd break the BBC's all-time complaint record.

140
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,240
Again, I'm not telling you what to do at all.

141
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,280
It's up to you.

142
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,840
I just thought that was kind of interesting.

143
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,800
Anyway, that's all from me today, folks.

144
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,240
I'll see you next time.
