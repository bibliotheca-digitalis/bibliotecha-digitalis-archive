0	1520	Hello, everyone.
1520	4800	This video is a follow-up to my previous two videos
4800	10920	about a particularly transphobic article published by BBC News on the 26th of October.
10920	14600	If you haven't seen those, I'd encourage you to go and watch them first.
14600	20600	But, before you go, in the second video, you'll see me say that the deadline to submit complaints
20600	23960	about the article is about to pass, which it now has.
23960	27160	But don't worry, anyone would still like to get involved.
27400	31080	Do come back and watch this video afterwards, because, as it turns out,
31080	33400	there's something new to complain about.
33400	34360	How fun.
34360	39760	So, then, the BBC has been sending out responses to various complaints that were escalated,
39760	44120	and I'll say thank you again to everyone who shared those responses with me.
44120	47400	Now, I've got a few news items to discuss today,
47400	50520	but before we get to those, we should cover the BBC response
50520	53480	and the next step in their complaints process.
53480	57320	And allow me to share with you the response that they sent to me,
57320	61400	which, amazingly enough, is even lazier than the last one they sent.
61400	65880	And let me first quote from my escalated complaint, just to refresh our memories here.
65880	67720	So, I said,
83480	90120	and claims in the article that no high-profile trans women who have spoken about sex and relationships
90120	91880	wanted to speak to her.
91880	95400	This is not true, because she spoke to Chelsea Poe.
95400	100920	I understand fully that the author can include or not include whoever she likes in her article
100920	103560	and do not need this explained to me.
103560	105560	I was getting a little snippy there.
105560	109560	What she cannot do is make false claims about who was interviewed.
109560	114680	The article's claim that no high-profile trans women who have spoken about sex and relationships
114680	117480	wanted to speak to the author is provably false,
117480	121240	and that is what I require a response from the BBC about.
122040	124920	And, in response to this, the BBC replied,
125400	128760	Thank you for getting in touch again to restate your complaint
128760	133080	that an interview with Chelsea Poe did not feature in the article
133080	135640	we're being pressured into sex by some trans women.
137240	140440	They're just taking the piss at this point, aren't they?
140440	145080	We can only reiterate that the choice of interviews which feature in the final version of an article
145080	148440	is the legitimate expression of the editorial judgments, etc.
148440	152520	So, they have again deliberately misunderstood what my complaint was.
152520	157080	Because they have no way to respond legitimately without admitting fault,
157080	161240	they've simply pretended I said something else and are responding to that instead.
161960	168920	Now, the next step involves escalating complaints to the BBC's Executive Complaints Unit, or ECU.
168920	174840	The email response you get from the BBC at this stage should include a link to contact the ECU,
174840	178600	which will take you to a page where you can escalate your complaint again.
178600	182920	Now, there isn't too much for me to add here in terms of arguments that could be made,
182920	187560	as the BBC's overall tactic at this last stage has been to dig in their heels and
187560	192440	repeat what they said in the first stage, even when it doesn't make any sense to do so,
192440	194600	like with the response they sent to me.
194600	200360	So, my ECU complaint is going to largely be me just restating what I said the last time
200360	204680	and explaining why the BBC's response is, again, completely inadequate.
204680	207720	And I'm sure your response will be generally similar to this,
207720	211640	just tailored to statements made in your own individual complaint.
211640	215560	Now, I'd advise that you draft these ECU complaints offline,
215560	218280	because the webpage you reach with the link in the email
218280	221720	will not let you edit your complaint once it's been submitted.
221720	225000	Also, the first time I tried to submit my ECU complaint,
225000	227720	I got an error message saying that something went wrong,
227720	231960	so I had to start the process over by clicking the link in the email again,
231960	235880	and it worked the second time, so watch out for that, I guess.
235880	238920	So then, on to article news, I guess.
239560	243800	Firstly, Chelsea Poe submitted a formal request to the BBC
243800	248600	asking for the footage of her interview with the author of the article, Carolyn Lowbridge,
248600	251880	but the BBC is choosing to withhold that footage,
251880	256040	and it's not hard to imagine why they wouldn't want that interview out there.
256040	259800	Right now, the BBC can just barely plausibly deny
259800	262760	that they knew about the allegations against Lily Cade,
262760	265160	assuming that we believe that Carolyn Lowbridge
265160	268360	never did a basic internet search for Lily Cade's name,
268360	271560	and that the BBC's very rigorous editorial process
271560	274280	just so happened to miss her inclusion.
274280	277320	The much worse story for the BBC would be that Lowbridge
277320	280840	definitely knew about the allegations before publishing the article
280840	285160	and chose to ignore them, which I believe is almost certainly true,
285160	289960	but it is hard to prove definitively without footage of her being told, anyway.
289960	295240	In other news, there was recently a protest held in front of the BBC's London headquarters
295240	299320	in opposition to the BBC's recent transphobic news coverage,
299320	303400	and it had a pretty amazing turnout, considering that it's winter,
303400	306120	it was raining, and there's an ongoing pandemic.
306760	310360	Various folks gave speeches criticizing the BBC's conduct,
310360	313880	including, of course, the article that we've been concerned with.
313880	319880	This protest was covered by several news websites, but it was not covered by the BBC.
319880	324280	Now, if you haven't been paying attention, you might find that rather odd, right?
324280	327080	A big part of the BBC's defense of the article
327080	331800	and its wider coverage of trans issues is their claim of impartiality.
331800	337160	Our commitment to impartiality means we have to cover every angle of a debate,
337160	341240	even if it's unpopular, and even if people don't want to hear it.
341240	345720	And this extends even to the point of platforming absurd conspiracy theorists
345720	348040	like people who believe the Earth is flat.
348040	350120	And this isn't me exaggerating here.
350120	353880	The BBC's director of editorial policy recently stated that
353880	356920	platforming flat Earth as is occasionally appropriate,
356920	361640	and that, quote, if a lot of people believed in flat Earth, we'd need to address it more.
362280	368600	Now, this is an outright abdication of what should be the most basic of journalistic principles,
368600	370200	to report the truth.
370760	375000	The BBC cannot be an impartial observer of public opinion here,
375000	378200	because they also affect public opinion.
378200	381640	If, just because some people believe the Earth is flat,
381640	386600	the BBC started running flat Earth coverage, whatever that would look like,
386600	389480	then they would cause more people to believe it.
389480	392200	Because by being platformed on the BBC,
392200	396600	flat Earth arguments would be given a weight that they otherwise are not.
396600	400840	You can't be impartial when it comes to what is true.
400840	405880	The Earth is not flat, regardless of how many people believe it to be.
405880	408440	That's my hot take for the day there.
408440	412280	And how far does this principle go, exactly?
412280	414920	Some people think the Holocaust was a hoax.
414920	419800	Some people think COVID vaccines contain microchips that control your brain.
419800	424440	You know, is the BBC going to write articles uncritically sharing those views,
424440	427160	just because some people believe them?
427160	432440	Anyway, all that aside, we're left with the BBC's claim of impartiality.
432440	435720	They cover every angle of a debate, so they say.
436360	442280	So where, we can ask, is the coverage of the protest that took place right on their doorstep?
442280	447800	After all, an anonymous self-selecting social media poll of less than a hundred people
447800	453320	was considered important enough to get a several thousand word article on the BBC website.
453320	458040	But a protest right outside their headquarters doesn't get mentioned at all.
458040	461320	So what happened to showing every side of a debate?
461320	465720	Because right now it looks like that excuse only runs in one direction.
465720	471160	It looks like the BBC want to use impartiality as a smokescreen to platform bigotry,
471160	475240	whereas protests against that bigotry get ignored.
475240	480360	Now, I don't like this very much, and I want to do something about it.
480360	485960	And what I'm going to do is, and we all know where this is going by now, don't we?
485960	488520	I'm going to submit a complaint.
488520	491800	Now, the deadline to complain about the article has passed,
491800	497560	but the deadline to complain about the lack of BBC coverage of the protest has not passed.
497560	502200	So here's what I, or we, if you feel so inclined, are going to do.
502840	506280	I'm going to go to the BBC complaints page, linked below,
506280	510120	click on make a complaint, where it says what is your complaint about.
510120	512280	I'm going to select general BBC.
512920	515720	Are you contacting us about a previous complaint?
515720	516360	No.
516360	520280	On the next page, where it says select the best category to describe your complaint,
520280	522920	I'm going to select not enough coverage.
522920	525160	And then I'm going to paste the text of my complaint
525160	528760	about the lack of coverage of the protest, which I'll also share below.
529560	532920	Now, I can't tell you what to do with your own time, of course,
532920	535400	but here's a fun fact for you.
535400	540600	The BBC's current complaint record is 110,000 complaints,
540600	544760	which they received in response to their coverage of Prince Philip's death.
544760	548840	Now, this video will probably get over that number of views,
548840	552680	which means if everyone who's hearing this right now goes to the link below
552680	558360	and submits a complaint, we'd break the BBC's all-time complaint record.
558360	561240	Again, I'm not telling you what to do at all.
561240	562280	It's up to you.
562280	564840	I just thought that was kind of interesting.
565480	567800	Anyway, that's all from me today, folks.
567800	569240	I'll see you next time.
