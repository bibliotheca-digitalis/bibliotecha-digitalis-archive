00:00.000 --> 00:06.420
Hello, everyone. Today, we're gonna be talking about the British monarchy and why I think it should be abolished.

00:07.120 --> 00:10.400
That's right. I want to fire the Queen and

00:10.920 --> 00:15.520
him and him and all the little children royals as well.

00:15.520 --> 00:22.800
They're all fired. Pack up your things so long your services are no longer required, sort of thing.

00:23.040 --> 00:28.000
So I guess I should make my case for that opinion, and it's a rather simple one, to be honest.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.040
I don't like hereditary hierarchies.

00:31.040 --> 00:37.260
I don't think it's right that someone should be born into a position of power over other people.

00:37.260 --> 00:42.280
Now, you might say, well, the Royals don't actually have any real political power anymore,

00:42.280 --> 00:45.800
and this is kind of true to an extent,

00:45.920 --> 00:52.440
but they still inherit at birth a position of enormous privilege and wealth, and this is in a country where the

00:52.640 --> 00:57.120
conservative's austerity politics have led to continued increases in food bank usage,

00:57.520 --> 01:03.120
cuts to child welfare have led to an increase in the number of children living in poverty, and so on.

01:03.120 --> 01:07.560
And it is completely indefensible to me that one child could be born into a

01:08.160 --> 01:12.740
manufactured poverty while another could be born into the wealthy royal family.

01:12.760 --> 01:17.600
Now, one of the ways the Royals do still have some political power is via the Queen's

01:17.920 --> 01:24.260
speeches, such as the State Opening of Parliament, in which she reads a statement outlining government policy.

01:25.080 --> 01:31.960
My ministers will continue to bring the public finances under control, so that Britain lives within its means,

01:32.960 --> 01:38.480
and to move to a higher wage and lower welfare economy, where work is rewarded.

01:38.920 --> 01:43.400
That's a clip from the State Opening of Parliament 2016 there,

01:43.400 --> 01:49.880
where the Queen read out a pro-austerity speech while sitting on a golden throne and wearing a hat with

01:51.240 --> 01:56.200
2,900 precious gems in it, including one of the largest diamonds in the world.

01:56.560 --> 02:04.120
Now, nobody wearing this hat should be able to say Britain should have to live within its means without getting sucked into an

02:04.120 --> 02:10.280
irony black hole. The Royals are wealthy and privileged not because of anything they've done to earn it,

02:10.280 --> 02:14.920
but because they were born into it at the expense of others, and this is wrong.

02:15.520 --> 02:21.240
Now, okay, if you're a regular viewer of my channel, I'm probably preaching to the choir here.

02:21.360 --> 02:27.560
You're probably on board with me being outraged about the country having to bear the enormous cost of this one

02:27.820 --> 02:33.560
particular family who did nothing whatsoever to earn it. Well, this video is not really aimed at you,

02:33.560 --> 02:39.960
I'm sorry to say. This video is aimed at people who, when I mentioned the enormous cost of the royal family,

02:40.120 --> 02:43.080
scrolled down to the comment box and started typing,

02:43.960 --> 02:51.540
actually, I think you'll find the Royals bring in more money than they cost us. Yeah, they're a benefit to the economy, it turns out.

02:52.000 --> 02:59.000
Haven't you seen that CGP Grey video? The true cost of the royal family explained. It's really interesting,

02:59.000 --> 03:06.400
you should check it out. So, this video. This is what I want to talk about today. Now, before we get into it,

03:06.560 --> 03:12.560
I just want to state that I'm not attacking old CGP Grey here. Often on my YouTube channel,

03:12.560 --> 03:19.360
I talk about Nazis and alt-righters and fascists and racists, and I just want to make a note here to say

03:19.560 --> 03:26.780
CGP Grey is to the best of my knowledge anyway, not that. I have in the past enjoyed several of his videos,

03:26.780 --> 03:33.800
and I've often shared his video on gerrymandering in particular, which is a really useful, easy-to-follow visual explanation.

03:33.840 --> 03:36.920
And I'd actually encourage you all to give it a look, so I'll link it below.

03:37.360 --> 03:44.320
So, why am I responding to this video today? Well, the fake answer is that it's got 4.5 million views,

03:44.320 --> 03:51.800
it's the top hit on YouTube if you search for royal family cost, and it's spreading a bunch of easily disprovable lies and

03:52.640 --> 03:58.720
oversimplifications. The true reason, though, is that back in my pre-YouTube days, when I was reduced to arguing

03:59.120 --> 04:06.840
unseen on dying internet debate forums, any mention of the cost of the monarchy would inevitably see someone post this video,

04:06.840 --> 04:12.640
and then we'd all have to argue about whether it was right or wrong all over again. These days, though,

04:12.640 --> 04:16.420
I have a YouTube channel and a platform, and I'm gonna use it

04:17.000 --> 04:22.280
self-servingly to get the last word in and retroactively win all of those arguments.

04:22.280 --> 04:25.520
I'm in mad scientist mode here, full disclosure.

04:25.840 --> 04:29.040
They'll see, they'll all see, and all that.

04:29.040 --> 04:33.640
Back to the present day, let's compare the profits and losses by using a tenner to represent 10 million pounds.

04:33.720 --> 04:37.000
The cost to maintain the royal family today is 40 million pounds per year,

04:37.120 --> 04:41.720
but the revenue paid to the UK from the royal lands is 200 million pounds per year.

04:42.680 --> 04:48.100
200 million in revenue subtract 40 million in salary costs equals 160 million pounds in profit.

04:48.260 --> 04:50.820
That's right, the United Kingdom earns

04:51.940 --> 04:55.900
160 million pounds in profit every year from the royal family.

04:55.900 --> 05:02.000
So then first off here, I'd like to admit a bit of bias. Even if these numbers were remotely true,

05:02.020 --> 05:07.740
I'd still support abolishing the monarchy, such as my disdain for hereditary positions of power.

05:08.560 --> 05:14.820
Luckily for me, though, they're not remotely true. There are massive problems on both sides of this equation.

05:15.140 --> 05:16.740
Let's start with the quote

05:16.740 --> 05:21.220
salary cost of the royal family, which CGP Grey puts at 40 million pounds.

05:21.220 --> 05:26.420
And I should note here that this video came out in 2011 prior to the Sovereign Grant Act,

05:26.420 --> 05:29.380
which reformed the way the monarchy is paid by the government.

05:29.380 --> 05:33.260
These days they're paid a percentage of the revenues from the Crown Estate.

05:33.260 --> 05:37.580
The Sovereign Grant for the last year was 76.1 million.

05:37.580 --> 05:43.460
So they've had quite the increase in the last few years, but since CGP Grey uses the 40 million figure,

05:43.500 --> 05:44.860
let's talk about that.

05:44.860 --> 05:50.580
Now the problem is, this salary cost is only a fraction of the actual cost of the monarchy.

05:51.100 --> 05:57.820
CGP Grey fails to include lots of other costs that are separate to any money that is paid directly to the Queen,

05:58.100 --> 06:02.180
such as security costs. If the royals travel somewhere,

06:02.180 --> 06:06.460
they do so with a security detail, and this is paid for by the state.

06:06.620 --> 06:11.560
The security costs for big events like Prince Harry's wedding to Meghan Markle earlier this year

06:11.760 --> 06:15.480
run into the millions, and that's all paid for by the taxpayer.

06:15.880 --> 06:18.960
The travel costs themselves are also not mentioned.

06:18.960 --> 06:22.560
If the royals go and visit somewhere to cut a ribbon or whatever,

06:22.560 --> 06:26.960
the costs for the trip fall on the local government of wherever they went.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.120
The refurbishment of royal properties is not mentioned.

06:30.120 --> 06:35.760
Buckingham Palace's ongoing renovation is estimated to cost 369 million pounds,

06:35.760 --> 06:39.720
and is the justification given for the recent large increase in the Sovereign Grant.

06:40.000 --> 06:46.120
So since their house needs fixing, we gave them a raise to pay for it, i.e.

06:46.600 --> 06:52.160
we're paying for it. And after all that, this 40 million figure here seems fairly ridiculous.

06:52.800 --> 06:58.680
Most estimates I've seen for the true cost of the monarchy are in the low hundreds of millions annually,

06:58.680 --> 07:05.560
and I'm being intentionally fuzzy with the figure here, because when it comes to this sum, none of what I just said actually

07:05.720 --> 07:10.080
matters. Because the real problem here isn't the 40 million in costs,

07:10.080 --> 07:12.280
it's the 200 million in quote,

07:12.640 --> 07:19.360
revenue from Crown land. Because here's the thing, if tomorrow all the royals just

07:19.800 --> 07:22.640
evaporated or fell off the earth or something,

07:23.160 --> 07:27.600
that land would still exist. It's not going anywhere, is it?

07:27.600 --> 07:31.360
It doesn't need the royals around to be present in our dimension.

07:31.360 --> 07:34.120
You know, it's not tied to their spirits or something.

07:34.480 --> 07:39.160
Without a monarch on the throne, all the trees would wither and die or something.

07:39.440 --> 07:47.320
No, the land and our ability to do profitable things with it would still be there without the monarchy. A more accurate sum here is

07:47.600 --> 07:53.840
40 million pounds against nothing. You know, why not kick the royals out and keep

07:54.560 --> 07:57.160
100% of the revenue, you might ask.

07:57.760 --> 08:00.400
But perhaps that's not enough for you because you're a real greedy geezer.

08:00.640 --> 08:05.040
Why not kick the royals out and keep 100% of the revenue? Because it's still their land.

08:05.360 --> 08:09.000
King George the crazy wasn't crazy enough to give up everything, just the profits.

08:09.280 --> 08:12.600
But it wasn't only him. Every monarch since King George the third has

08:12.840 --> 08:15.920
voluntarily turned over the profits from their land to the United Kingdom.

08:16.200 --> 08:21.440
If the government stopped paying the royal families living and state expenses, the royals would be forced to take back the profits from their land

08:21.440 --> 08:24.800
and your taxes, dear monarchy haters, would go up, not down.

08:25.320 --> 08:31.360
So there's a lot going on in this clip. First off, I'd like to note the backing away from the initial question,

08:31.360 --> 08:39.520
which was why not kick the royals out, to the much softer scenario of the government simply stopping paying for their expenses,

08:40.160 --> 08:45.320
after which the royals would apparently be forced to stop turning over the revenue from the crown estate.

08:45.360 --> 08:50.900
My first issue with this is that CGP Grey's version of kicking the royals out appears to

08:51.140 --> 08:58.820
arbitrarily leave them with all their land and wealth, and also the apparent ability to negotiate from a position of power with the British government.

08:59.020 --> 09:03.660
And I have to ask why he's imposing these measures. You see, although

09:04.180 --> 09:10.660
CGP Grey says it's still their land, the crown estate is not actually the monarch's private property.

09:10.700 --> 09:15.020
They cannot do with it as they wish. If they were to be able to quote

09:15.300 --> 09:19.820
take back the revenue from the property overseen by the crown estate, this would involve

09:20.580 --> 09:24.940
renegotiating the arrangement with the government and coming away with private ownership of

09:25.700 --> 09:31.700
everything, which is ludicrous. Although to be fair, given how the Brexit negotiations are going,

09:31.700 --> 09:36.460
maybe it's not. You see, my version of kicking the royals out involves

09:36.980 --> 09:42.100
confiscating all their stuff, because it's not really their stuff at the end of the day.

09:42.100 --> 09:46.500
They inherited it from someone who inherited it from someone, et cetera,

09:47.060 --> 09:51.580
who claimed ownership of it by killing everyone who disagreed with them.

09:51.580 --> 09:59.140
It wouldn't exactly be kicking the royals out if we left them with sole ownership of huge parts of the country, would it?

09:59.500 --> 10:06.500
CGP Grey is basically saying, after we abolish the monarchy, the monarchy will then respond by saying, et cetera.

10:06.860 --> 10:10.560
And no, after we've abolished the monarchy, they've been abolished.

10:10.720 --> 10:16.240
They don't get a turn. This is a particular sort of bad faith argument that I've seen a few times.

10:16.280 --> 10:18.280
Let me give you another example.

10:18.280 --> 10:22.040
Do you support an increase in green renewable energy?

10:22.040 --> 10:27.000
And I imagine most of you would say yes, unless you happen to be oil barons or something.

10:27.000 --> 10:33.800
Now, what I'm going to do is fixate on that one opinion of yours and extrapolate from that way more than is logical or necessary.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.460
So you support an increase in green energy, which means you support the decrease of the use of fossil fuels,

10:39.700 --> 10:45.140
which means you support the current employees of the fossil fuel industry being made unemployed.

10:45.140 --> 10:50.100
And how cruel of you, just before Christmas and everything, you classist monster.

10:50.100 --> 10:56.900
And before you can protest that you also support, I don't know, job guarantees for fossil fuel workers or

10:57.100 --> 11:01.460
various welfare systems or a universal basic income or something like that,

11:01.460 --> 11:08.500
I've already run away with my fingers in my ears saying, la la la, I can't hear you, you classist monster.

11:08.540 --> 11:11.940
Now, I'm speaking from experience here because I've had this happen to me.

11:12.460 --> 11:18.820
Reality isn't turn-based, however. We can support and do multiple things at the same time.

11:18.820 --> 11:25.460
So in this case, my bill to abolish the monarchy would say, we're no longer paying for the royal family's expenses and

11:26.060 --> 11:29.220
also, the crown estate will henceforth be publicly owned and

11:29.660 --> 11:37.420
also, the Royals will lose all hereditary positions and powers and also, if you don't like that, you can go and sit on your crown,

11:37.700 --> 11:39.140
which is now ours.

11:39.140 --> 11:41.140
So anyway, that's the land

11:41.140 --> 11:48.120
argument dealt with there. Now, the other common response to the argument that the Royals cost the country is the tourism argument.

11:48.740 --> 11:52.380
Tourists come here just to see the Queen, apparently.

11:52.620 --> 11:57.300
Plus, 160 million is just the easily measurable money the United Kingdom makes from the royal family.

11:57.300 --> 12:00.020
Don't forget their huge indirect golden goose, tourists.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.900
Annoying though they might be to the locals by blocking the tube and refusing to stand on the right,

12:03.900 --> 12:10.740
they dump buckets of money on the UK to see the sights, travel ludicrously short distances by public transport, and generally act silly a long

12:10.740 --> 12:13.340
way from home. Sure, not everything they come to see is royal,

12:13.340 --> 12:17.560
but the most expensive stuff is. And who are the biggest spenders? The Yanks.

12:18.100 --> 12:24.860
After they finish buying maple syrup and cheap pharmaceuticals, T1 and professional services and illegal pharmaceuticals, where do they go next? The United Kingdom.

12:25.460 --> 12:29.380
Americans fly across an ocean to see a land filled with castles that aren't plastic.

12:29.460 --> 12:36.420
And why do the Americans think France's castles are so boring and stinky and the UK's castles are so awesome? Because real monarchs still use them.

12:36.740 --> 12:41.100
The Tower of London is so stunning to visitors because the royal crest on the Yeoman Warders uniform is real.

12:41.100 --> 12:46.240
It's not a lame historical reenactment or a modern LARPing quest. It's the embodiment of the living, breathing Queen.

12:46.820 --> 12:53.900
Everywhere you look she sprinkled fairy dust on banal objects to make them magically attractive to tourists, 12 million of whom visit every year spending

12:54.420 --> 12:59.180
7,000 million pounds, which suddenly makes those direct profits look like rather small change.

12:59.380 --> 13:01.780
So there's a lot to talk about right here.

13:03.260 --> 13:04.660
Where to start?

13:04.660 --> 13:12.320
So the comparison with France is particularly audacious and cheeky here because as you might know France makes a lot more money off

13:12.420 --> 13:17.680
tourism than the UK. In 2017 France was the number one tourist destination in the world,

13:17.680 --> 13:22.060
whereas the United Kingdom was seventh with less than half of the number of

13:22.420 --> 13:28.080
individual tourists. The Palace of Versailles gets vastly more visitors each year than Buckingham Palace.

13:28.380 --> 13:33.860
According to a CNN travel report, in 2013 Versailles had over 7 million visitors and

13:34.260 --> 13:40.400
Buckingham Palace had less than 1 million. So living monarchs don't seem to be that big of a tourist attraction.

13:40.500 --> 13:44.600
So how does CGP Grey get away with this France comparison?

13:44.600 --> 13:52.280
Well, he needlessly limits himself to talking about just one group of people that happen to visit the UK modern France and that's

13:52.600 --> 14:00.380
Americans. And there is absolutely no reason to do this except to give the false impression that the UK attracts more visitors than France,

14:00.480 --> 14:04.060
when if you consider all tourists, it's not even close.

14:04.460 --> 14:07.680
Also as a little aside here, when CGP Grey says,

14:07.680 --> 14:13.880
why do Americans think France's castles are so boring and stinky and the UK's castles are so awesome,

14:13.920 --> 14:19.760
he shows pictures of two castles. Now the boring and stinky castle is the fortress of

14:19.920 --> 14:27.400
Najac in France and the awesome castle is Mont Saint-Michel in, no prizes for guessing, this one,

14:27.920 --> 14:35.280
France. They're both French castles. Well, actually this one isn't a castle, but you know, whatever, they're both in France.

14:35.640 --> 14:41.400
What CGP Grey has done is mix up this place with this place, Saint Michael's Mount,

14:41.400 --> 14:47.220
which has a similar name and appearance but is actually in the UK. Now given that CGP Grey, an

14:47.340 --> 14:53.620
American, can't tell the difference between a French castle and an English one, that kind of disproves this point there.

14:53.940 --> 14:57.100
Hardy ha. An error was made on the internet.

14:58.220 --> 15:04.840
Regardless, tourists don't get a cup of tea and a chat with the Queen or anything when they go to see a royal property.

15:05.100 --> 15:07.860
Whether the Royals are around or not doesn't matter.

15:08.020 --> 15:14.140
The buildings are still gonna be there and again, as we've seen, more people go to see France's

15:14.260 --> 15:22.020
palaces and they got all choppy with their monarchs. And that's the thing, even if the actual monarchy was officially abolished, the people,

15:22.020 --> 15:24.400
you know, the family, would still exist.

15:24.620 --> 15:31.980
They'd still live in the country. If they're meant to be a draw by themselves, they'd be nothing stopping them from being, you know.

15:32.020 --> 15:37.300
I'm sure they'd still be invited to events and to open buildings and whatever else, you know.

15:37.300 --> 15:43.540
The difference is that they'd have to pay their own way and I don't even imagine that would be particularly difficult for them.

15:43.540 --> 15:47.800
They'd still be a celebrity family regardless of official status.

15:47.800 --> 15:52.200
I imagine there'd be a lot of monarchists around who'd be willing to send them their money.

15:52.420 --> 15:55.480
You know, maybe they could do a GoFundMe or something.

15:55.480 --> 16:03.380
To sum up here, without the monarchy, the land would still exist, the royal estates would still exist, and the people who are

16:03.460 --> 16:09.140
currently the Royals would still exist. All that would change is that our government would stop

16:09.300 --> 16:15.340
funneling millions of pounds into the pockets of one particular, already rich family.

16:15.340 --> 16:17.540
Now, what else haven't I mentioned here?

16:17.540 --> 16:23.660
Well, very quickly, CGP Grey gives the impression that the Royals turn over the income from all of their lands,

16:23.660 --> 16:25.660
but this isn't actually true.

16:25.740 --> 16:33.520
The duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall are administered separately from the Crown Estate and the Royals don't have to turn over the revenue from those,

16:33.520 --> 16:37.780
and they're not subject to tax. The Royals voluntarily,

16:37.780 --> 16:45.140
how nice of them, pay income tax on the income generated by the duchies. Less official expenditures, of course.

16:45.140 --> 16:48.380
However, they remain exempt from corporation tax.

16:48.580 --> 16:56.420
The duchies have been valued together at more than a billion pounds, and this is, of course, not mentioned by CGP Grey.

16:56.860 --> 17:01.000
That's about it for me today, folks. That's a short one, isn't it, from me?

17:01.000 --> 17:04.260
I usually make longer videos than this, but to be honest,

17:04.300 --> 17:09.620
I just needed to get this one out of my system. If you're desperate for more content,

17:09.620 --> 17:15.420
I have a little announcement to make. Today is the two-year anniversary of me joining Patreon.

17:16.220 --> 17:21.620
Patreon. And I thought I'd do a little something fun and special for all my backers over there.

17:21.860 --> 17:27.800
But then I couldn't think of anything, so I waffled into a microphone about YouTube for 20 minutes.

17:27.860 --> 17:33.860
So if you'd like to hear me talking a bunch of nonsense for a while, head over there and take a look.

17:34.620 --> 17:41.780
Right, remember to like and subscribe and all that, and follow me on Twitter or ask me a question on Curious Cat, if you fancy.

17:42.540 --> 17:44.540
Brackets. Links below.

17:44.900 --> 17:46.900
Righty-ho, folks. See you next time.
