00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,420
Hello, everyone. Today, we're gonna be talking about the British monarchy and why I think it should be abolished.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,400
That's right. I want to fire the Queen and

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,520
him and him and all the little children royals as well.

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:22,800
They're all fired. Pack up your things so long your services are no longer required, sort of thing.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,000
So I guess I should make my case for that opinion, and it's a rather simple one, to be honest.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,040
I don't like hereditary hierarchies.

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:37,260
I don't think it's right that someone should be born into a position of power over other people.

8
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,280
Now, you might say, well, the Royals don't actually have any real political power anymore,

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,800
and this is kind of true to an extent,

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,440
but they still inherit at birth a position of enormous privilege and wealth, and this is in a country where the

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,120
conservative's austerity politics have led to continued increases in food bank usage,

12
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,120
cuts to child welfare have led to an increase in the number of children living in poverty, and so on.

13
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,560
And it is completely indefensible to me that one child could be born into a

14
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,740
manufactured poverty while another could be born into the wealthy royal family.

15
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,600
Now, one of the ways the Royals do still have some political power is via the Queen's

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,260
speeches, such as the State Opening of Parliament, in which she reads a statement outlining government policy.

17
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:31,960
My ministers will continue to bring the public finances under control, so that Britain lives within its means,

18
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,480
and to move to a higher wage and lower welfare economy, where work is rewarded.

19
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,400
That's a clip from the State Opening of Parliament 2016 there,

20
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:49,880
where the Queen read out a pro-austerity speech while sitting on a golden throne and wearing a hat with

21
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,200
2,900 precious gems in it, including one of the largest diamonds in the world.

22
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:04,120
Now, nobody wearing this hat should be able to say Britain should have to live within its means without getting sucked into an

23
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:10,280
irony black hole. The Royals are wealthy and privileged not because of anything they've done to earn it,

24
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,920
but because they were born into it at the expense of others, and this is wrong.

25
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,240
Now, okay, if you're a regular viewer of my channel, I'm probably preaching to the choir here.

26
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,560
You're probably on board with me being outraged about the country having to bear the enormous cost of this one

27
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:33,560
particular family who did nothing whatsoever to earn it. Well, this video is not really aimed at you,

28
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,960
I'm sorry to say. This video is aimed at people who, when I mentioned the enormous cost of the royal family,

29
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,080
scrolled down to the comment box and started typing,

30
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:51,540
actually, I think you'll find the Royals bring in more money than they cost us. Yeah, they're a benefit to the economy, it turns out.

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Haven't you seen that CGP Grey video? The true cost of the royal family explained. It's really interesting,

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,400
you should check it out. So, this video. This is what I want to talk about today. Now, before we get into it,

33
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,560
I just want to state that I'm not attacking old CGP Grey here. Often on my YouTube channel,

34
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,360
I talk about Nazis and alt-righters and fascists and racists, and I just want to make a note here to say

35
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:26,780
CGP Grey is to the best of my knowledge anyway, not that. I have in the past enjoyed several of his videos,

36
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:33,800
and I've often shared his video on gerrymandering in particular, which is a really useful, easy-to-follow visual explanation.

37
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,920
And I'd actually encourage you all to give it a look, so I'll link it below.

38
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,320
So, why am I responding to this video today? Well, the fake answer is that it's got 4.5 million views,

39
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:51,800
it's the top hit on YouTube if you search for royal family cost, and it's spreading a bunch of easily disprovable lies and

40
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,720
oversimplifications. The true reason, though, is that back in my pre-YouTube days, when I was reduced to arguing

41
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,840
unseen on dying internet debate forums, any mention of the cost of the monarchy would inevitably see someone post this video,

42
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,640
and then we'd all have to argue about whether it was right or wrong all over again. These days, though,

43
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,420
I have a YouTube channel and a platform, and I'm gonna use it

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,280
self-servingly to get the last word in and retroactively win all of those arguments.

45
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,520
I'm in mad scientist mode here, full disclosure.

46
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,040
They'll see, they'll all see, and all that.

47
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,640
Back to the present day, let's compare the profits and losses by using a tenner to represent 10 million pounds.

48
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,000
The cost to maintain the royal family today is 40 million pounds per year,

49
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,720
but the revenue paid to the UK from the royal lands is 200 million pounds per year.

50
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,100
200 million in revenue subtract 40 million in salary costs equals 160 million pounds in profit.

51
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,820
That's right, the United Kingdom earns

52
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,900
160 million pounds in profit every year from the royal family.

53
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:02,000
So then first off here, I'd like to admit a bit of bias. Even if these numbers were remotely true,

54
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,740
I'd still support abolishing the monarchy, such as my disdain for hereditary positions of power.

55
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,820
Luckily for me, though, they're not remotely true. There are massive problems on both sides of this equation.

56
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,740
Let's start with the quote

57
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,220
salary cost of the royal family, which CGP Grey puts at 40 million pounds.

58
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,420
And I should note here that this video came out in 2011 prior to the Sovereign Grant Act,

59
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,380
which reformed the way the monarchy is paid by the government.

60
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,260
These days they're paid a percentage of the revenues from the Crown Estate.

61
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,580
The Sovereign Grant for the last year was 76.1 million.

62
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:43,460
So they've had quite the increase in the last few years, but since CGP Grey uses the 40 million figure,

63
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,860
let's talk about that.

64
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:50,580
Now the problem is, this salary cost is only a fraction of the actual cost of the monarchy.

65
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:57,820
CGP Grey fails to include lots of other costs that are separate to any money that is paid directly to the Queen,

66
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,180
such as security costs. If the royals travel somewhere,

67
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,460
they do so with a security detail, and this is paid for by the state.

68
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,560
The security costs for big events like Prince Harry's wedding to Meghan Markle earlier this year

69
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,480
run into the millions, and that's all paid for by the taxpayer.

70
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,960
The travel costs themselves are also not mentioned.

71
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,560
If the royals go and visit somewhere to cut a ribbon or whatever,

72
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,960
the costs for the trip fall on the local government of wherever they went.

73
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,120
The refurbishment of royal properties is not mentioned.

74
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,760
Buckingham Palace's ongoing renovation is estimated to cost 369 million pounds,

75
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,720
and is the justification given for the recent large increase in the Sovereign Grant.

76
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,120
So since their house needs fixing, we gave them a raise to pay for it, i.e.

77
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:52,160
we're paying for it. And after all that, this 40 million figure here seems fairly ridiculous.

78
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,680
Most estimates I've seen for the true cost of the monarchy are in the low hundreds of millions annually,

79
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:05,560
and I'm being intentionally fuzzy with the figure here, because when it comes to this sum, none of what I just said actually

80
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,080
matters. Because the real problem here isn't the 40 million in costs,

81
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,280
it's the 200 million in quote,

82
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:19,360
revenue from Crown land. Because here's the thing, if tomorrow all the royals just

83
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,640
evaporated or fell off the earth or something,

84
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,600
that land would still exist. It's not going anywhere, is it?

85
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,360
It doesn't need the royals around to be present in our dimension.

86
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,120
You know, it's not tied to their spirits or something.

87
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,160
Without a monarch on the throne, all the trees would wither and die or something.

88
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:47,320
No, the land and our ability to do profitable things with it would still be there without the monarchy. A more accurate sum here is

89
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:53,840
40 million pounds against nothing. You know, why not kick the royals out and keep

90
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,160
100% of the revenue, you might ask.

91
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,400
But perhaps that's not enough for you because you're a real greedy geezer.

92
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,040
Why not kick the royals out and keep 100% of the revenue? Because it's still their land.

93
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,000
King George the crazy wasn't crazy enough to give up everything, just the profits.

94
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,600
But it wasn't only him. Every monarch since King George the third has

95
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,920
voluntarily turned over the profits from their land to the United Kingdom.

96
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,440
If the government stopped paying the royal families living and state expenses, the royals would be forced to take back the profits from their land

97
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,800
and your taxes, dear monarchy haters, would go up, not down.

98
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:31,360
So there's a lot going on in this clip. First off, I'd like to note the backing away from the initial question,

99
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:39,520
which was why not kick the royals out, to the much softer scenario of the government simply stopping paying for their expenses,

100
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:45,320
after which the royals would apparently be forced to stop turning over the revenue from the crown estate.

101
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,900
My first issue with this is that CGP Grey's version of kicking the royals out appears to

102
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:58,820
arbitrarily leave them with all their land and wealth, and also the apparent ability to negotiate from a position of power with the British government.

103
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,660
And I have to ask why he's imposing these measures. You see, although

104
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:10,660
CGP Grey says it's still their land, the crown estate is not actually the monarch's private property.

105
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:15,020
They cannot do with it as they wish. If they were to be able to quote

106
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,820
take back the revenue from the property overseen by the crown estate, this would involve

107
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,940
renegotiating the arrangement with the government and coming away with private ownership of

108
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:31,700
everything, which is ludicrous. Although to be fair, given how the Brexit negotiations are going,

109
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,460
maybe it's not. You see, my version of kicking the royals out involves

110
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:42,100
confiscating all their stuff, because it's not really their stuff at the end of the day.

111
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,500
They inherited it from someone who inherited it from someone, et cetera,

112
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,580
who claimed ownership of it by killing everyone who disagreed with them.

113
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:59,140
It wouldn't exactly be kicking the royals out if we left them with sole ownership of huge parts of the country, would it?

114
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:06,500
CGP Grey is basically saying, after we abolish the monarchy, the monarchy will then respond by saying, et cetera.

115
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,560
And no, after we've abolished the monarchy, they've been abolished.

116
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,240
They don't get a turn. This is a particular sort of bad faith argument that I've seen a few times.

117
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,280
Let me give you another example.

118
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,040
Do you support an increase in green renewable energy?

119
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:27,000
And I imagine most of you would say yes, unless you happen to be oil barons or something.

120
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,800
Now, what I'm going to do is fixate on that one opinion of yours and extrapolate from that way more than is logical or necessary.

121
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,460
So you support an increase in green energy, which means you support the decrease of the use of fossil fuels,

122
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:45,140
which means you support the current employees of the fossil fuel industry being made unemployed.

123
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:50,100
And how cruel of you, just before Christmas and everything, you classist monster.

124
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:56,900
And before you can protest that you also support, I don't know, job guarantees for fossil fuel workers or

125
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,460
various welfare systems or a universal basic income or something like that,

126
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:08,500
I've already run away with my fingers in my ears saying, la la la, I can't hear you, you classist monster.

127
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,940
Now, I'm speaking from experience here because I've had this happen to me.

128
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:18,820
Reality isn't turn-based, however. We can support and do multiple things at the same time.

129
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:25,460
So in this case, my bill to abolish the monarchy would say, we're no longer paying for the royal family's expenses and

130
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,220
also, the crown estate will henceforth be publicly owned and

131
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:37,420
also, the Royals will lose all hereditary positions and powers and also, if you don't like that, you can go and sit on your crown,

132
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,140
which is now ours.

133
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,140
So anyway, that's the land

134
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:48,120
argument dealt with there. Now, the other common response to the argument that the Royals cost the country is the tourism argument.

135
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,380
Tourists come here just to see the Queen, apparently.

136
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,300
Plus, 160 million is just the easily measurable money the United Kingdom makes from the royal family.

137
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,020
Don't forget their huge indirect golden goose, tourists.

138
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,900
Annoying though they might be to the locals by blocking the tube and refusing to stand on the right,

139
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:10,740
they dump buckets of money on the UK to see the sights, travel ludicrously short distances by public transport, and generally act silly a long

140
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,340
way from home. Sure, not everything they come to see is royal,

141
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,560
but the most expensive stuff is. And who are the biggest spenders? The Yanks.

142
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:24,860
After they finish buying maple syrup and cheap pharmaceuticals, T1 and professional services and illegal pharmaceuticals, where do they go next? The United Kingdom.

143
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,380
Americans fly across an ocean to see a land filled with castles that aren't plastic.

144
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:36,420
And why do the Americans think France's castles are so boring and stinky and the UK's castles are so awesome? Because real monarchs still use them.

145
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,100
The Tower of London is so stunning to visitors because the royal crest on the Yeoman Warders uniform is real.

146
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,240
It's not a lame historical reenactment or a modern LARPing quest. It's the embodiment of the living, breathing Queen.

147
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:53,900
Everywhere you look she sprinkled fairy dust on banal objects to make them magically attractive to tourists, 12 million of whom visit every year spending

148
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,180
7,000 million pounds, which suddenly makes those direct profits look like rather small change.

149
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,780
So there's a lot to talk about right here.

150
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,660
Where to start?

151
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:12,320
So the comparison with France is particularly audacious and cheeky here because as you might know France makes a lot more money off

152
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:17,680
tourism than the UK. In 2017 France was the number one tourist destination in the world,

153
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,060
whereas the United Kingdom was seventh with less than half of the number of

154
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:28,080
individual tourists. The Palace of Versailles gets vastly more visitors each year than Buckingham Palace.

155
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:33,860
According to a CNN travel report, in 2013 Versailles had over 7 million visitors and

156
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:40,400
Buckingham Palace had less than 1 million. So living monarchs don't seem to be that big of a tourist attraction.

157
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,600
So how does CGP Grey get away with this France comparison?

158
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:52,280
Well, he needlessly limits himself to talking about just one group of people that happen to visit the UK modern France and that's

159
00:13:52,600 --> 00:14:00,380
Americans. And there is absolutely no reason to do this except to give the false impression that the UK attracts more visitors than France,

160
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,060
when if you consider all tourists, it's not even close.

161
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,680
Also as a little aside here, when CGP Grey says,

162
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,880
why do Americans think France's castles are so boring and stinky and the UK's castles are so awesome,

163
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,760
he shows pictures of two castles. Now the boring and stinky castle is the fortress of

164
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:27,400
Najac in France and the awesome castle is Mont Saint-Michel in, no prizes for guessing, this one,

165
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:35,280
France. They're both French castles. Well, actually this one isn't a castle, but you know, whatever, they're both in France.

166
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:41,400
What CGP Grey has done is mix up this place with this place, Saint Michael's Mount,

167
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:47,220
which has a similar name and appearance but is actually in the UK. Now given that CGP Grey, an

168
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:53,620
American, can't tell the difference between a French castle and an English one, that kind of disproves this point there.

169
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,100
Hardy ha. An error was made on the internet.

170
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:04,840
Regardless, tourists don't get a cup of tea and a chat with the Queen or anything when they go to see a royal property.

171
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,860
Whether the Royals are around or not doesn't matter.

172
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:14,140
The buildings are still gonna be there and again, as we've seen, more people go to see France's

173
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:22,020
palaces and they got all choppy with their monarchs. And that's the thing, even if the actual monarchy was officially abolished, the people,

174
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,400
you know, the family, would still exist.

175
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:31,980
They'd still live in the country. If they're meant to be a draw by themselves, they'd be nothing stopping them from being, you know.

176
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:37,300
I'm sure they'd still be invited to events and to open buildings and whatever else, you know.

177
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:43,540
The difference is that they'd have to pay their own way and I don't even imagine that would be particularly difficult for them.

178
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,800
They'd still be a celebrity family regardless of official status.

179
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,200
I imagine there'd be a lot of monarchists around who'd be willing to send them their money.

180
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,480
You know, maybe they could do a GoFundMe or something.

181
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:03,380
To sum up here, without the monarchy, the land would still exist, the royal estates would still exist, and the people who are

182
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:09,140
currently the Royals would still exist. All that would change is that our government would stop

183
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:15,340
funneling millions of pounds into the pockets of one particular, already rich family.

184
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,540
Now, what else haven't I mentioned here?

185
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:23,660
Well, very quickly, CGP Grey gives the impression that the Royals turn over the income from all of their lands,

186
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,660
but this isn't actually true.

187
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:33,520
The duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall are administered separately from the Crown Estate and the Royals don't have to turn over the revenue from those,

188
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,780
and they're not subject to tax. The Royals voluntarily,

189
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:45,140
how nice of them, pay income tax on the income generated by the duchies. Less official expenditures, of course.

190
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,380
However, they remain exempt from corporation tax.

191
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:56,420
The duchies have been valued together at more than a billion pounds, and this is, of course, not mentioned by CGP Grey.

192
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:01,000
That's about it for me today, folks. That's a short one, isn't it, from me?

193
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,260
I usually make longer videos than this, but to be honest,

194
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:09,620
I just needed to get this one out of my system. If you're desperate for more content,

195
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:15,420
I have a little announcement to make. Today is the two-year anniversary of me joining Patreon.

196
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:21,620
Patreon. And I thought I'd do a little something fun and special for all my backers over there.

197
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:27,800
But then I couldn't think of anything, so I waffled into a microphone about YouTube for 20 minutes.

198
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:33,860
So if you'd like to hear me talking a bunch of nonsense for a while, head over there and take a look.

199
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:41,780
Right, remember to like and subscribe and all that, and follow me on Twitter or ask me a question on Curious Cat, if you fancy.

201
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,900
Righty-ho, folks. See you next time.
