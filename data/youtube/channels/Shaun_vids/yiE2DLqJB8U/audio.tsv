0	6420	Hello, everyone. Today, we're gonna be talking about the British monarchy and why I think it should be abolished.
7120	10400	That's right. I want to fire the Queen and
10920	15520	him and him and all the little children royals as well.
15520	22800	They're all fired. Pack up your things so long your services are no longer required, sort of thing.
23040	28000	So I guess I should make my case for that opinion, and it's a rather simple one, to be honest.
28000	31040	I don't like hereditary hierarchies.
31040	37260	I don't think it's right that someone should be born into a position of power over other people.
37260	42280	Now, you might say, well, the Royals don't actually have any real political power anymore,
42280	45800	and this is kind of true to an extent,
45920	52440	but they still inherit at birth a position of enormous privilege and wealth, and this is in a country where the
52640	57120	conservative's austerity politics have led to continued increases in food bank usage,
57520	63120	cuts to child welfare have led to an increase in the number of children living in poverty, and so on.
63120	67560	And it is completely indefensible to me that one child could be born into a
68160	72740	manufactured poverty while another could be born into the wealthy royal family.
72760	77600	Now, one of the ways the Royals do still have some political power is via the Queen's
77920	84260	speeches, such as the State Opening of Parliament, in which she reads a statement outlining government policy.
85080	91960	My ministers will continue to bring the public finances under control, so that Britain lives within its means,
92960	98480	and to move to a higher wage and lower welfare economy, where work is rewarded.
98920	103400	That's a clip from the State Opening of Parliament 2016 there,
103400	109880	where the Queen read out a pro-austerity speech while sitting on a golden throne and wearing a hat with
111240	116200	2,900 precious gems in it, including one of the largest diamonds in the world.
116560	124120	Now, nobody wearing this hat should be able to say Britain should have to live within its means without getting sucked into an
124120	130280	irony black hole. The Royals are wealthy and privileged not because of anything they've done to earn it,
130280	134920	but because they were born into it at the expense of others, and this is wrong.
135520	141240	Now, okay, if you're a regular viewer of my channel, I'm probably preaching to the choir here.
141360	147560	You're probably on board with me being outraged about the country having to bear the enormous cost of this one
147820	153560	particular family who did nothing whatsoever to earn it. Well, this video is not really aimed at you,
153560	159960	I'm sorry to say. This video is aimed at people who, when I mentioned the enormous cost of the royal family,
160120	163080	scrolled down to the comment box and started typing,
163960	171540	actually, I think you'll find the Royals bring in more money than they cost us. Yeah, they're a benefit to the economy, it turns out.
172000	179000	Haven't you seen that CGP Grey video? The true cost of the royal family explained. It's really interesting,
179000	186400	you should check it out. So, this video. This is what I want to talk about today. Now, before we get into it,
186560	192560	I just want to state that I'm not attacking old CGP Grey here. Often on my YouTube channel,
192560	199360	I talk about Nazis and alt-righters and fascists and racists, and I just want to make a note here to say
199560	206780	CGP Grey is to the best of my knowledge anyway, not that. I have in the past enjoyed several of his videos,
206780	213800	and I've often shared his video on gerrymandering in particular, which is a really useful, easy-to-follow visual explanation.
213840	216920	And I'd actually encourage you all to give it a look, so I'll link it below.
217360	224320	So, why am I responding to this video today? Well, the fake answer is that it's got 4.5 million views,
224320	231800	it's the top hit on YouTube if you search for royal family cost, and it's spreading a bunch of easily disprovable lies and
232640	238720	oversimplifications. The true reason, though, is that back in my pre-YouTube days, when I was reduced to arguing
239120	246840	unseen on dying internet debate forums, any mention of the cost of the monarchy would inevitably see someone post this video,
246840	252640	and then we'd all have to argue about whether it was right or wrong all over again. These days, though,
252640	256420	I have a YouTube channel and a platform, and I'm gonna use it
257000	262280	self-servingly to get the last word in and retroactively win all of those arguments.
262280	265520	I'm in mad scientist mode here, full disclosure.
265840	269040	They'll see, they'll all see, and all that.
269040	273640	Back to the present day, let's compare the profits and losses by using a tenner to represent 10 million pounds.
273720	277000	The cost to maintain the royal family today is 40 million pounds per year,
277120	281720	but the revenue paid to the UK from the royal lands is 200 million pounds per year.
282680	288100	200 million in revenue subtract 40 million in salary costs equals 160 million pounds in profit.
288260	290820	That's right, the United Kingdom earns
291940	295900	160 million pounds in profit every year from the royal family.
295900	302000	So then first off here, I'd like to admit a bit of bias. Even if these numbers were remotely true,
302020	307740	I'd still support abolishing the monarchy, such as my disdain for hereditary positions of power.
308560	314820	Luckily for me, though, they're not remotely true. There are massive problems on both sides of this equation.
315140	316740	Let's start with the quote
316740	321220	salary cost of the royal family, which CGP Grey puts at 40 million pounds.
321220	326420	And I should note here that this video came out in 2011 prior to the Sovereign Grant Act,
326420	329380	which reformed the way the monarchy is paid by the government.
329380	333260	These days they're paid a percentage of the revenues from the Crown Estate.
333260	337580	The Sovereign Grant for the last year was 76.1 million.
337580	343460	So they've had quite the increase in the last few years, but since CGP Grey uses the 40 million figure,
343500	344860	let's talk about that.
344860	350580	Now the problem is, this salary cost is only a fraction of the actual cost of the monarchy.
351100	357820	CGP Grey fails to include lots of other costs that are separate to any money that is paid directly to the Queen,
358100	362180	such as security costs. If the royals travel somewhere,
362180	366460	they do so with a security detail, and this is paid for by the state.
366620	371560	The security costs for big events like Prince Harry's wedding to Meghan Markle earlier this year
371760	375480	run into the millions, and that's all paid for by the taxpayer.
375880	378960	The travel costs themselves are also not mentioned.
378960	382560	If the royals go and visit somewhere to cut a ribbon or whatever,
382560	386960	the costs for the trip fall on the local government of wherever they went.
386960	390120	The refurbishment of royal properties is not mentioned.
390120	395760	Buckingham Palace's ongoing renovation is estimated to cost 369 million pounds,
395760	399720	and is the justification given for the recent large increase in the Sovereign Grant.
400000	406120	So since their house needs fixing, we gave them a raise to pay for it, i.e.
406600	412160	we're paying for it. And after all that, this 40 million figure here seems fairly ridiculous.
412800	418680	Most estimates I've seen for the true cost of the monarchy are in the low hundreds of millions annually,
418680	425560	and I'm being intentionally fuzzy with the figure here, because when it comes to this sum, none of what I just said actually
425720	430080	matters. Because the real problem here isn't the 40 million in costs,
430080	432280	it's the 200 million in quote,
432640	439360	revenue from Crown land. Because here's the thing, if tomorrow all the royals just
439800	442640	evaporated or fell off the earth or something,
443160	447600	that land would still exist. It's not going anywhere, is it?
447600	451360	It doesn't need the royals around to be present in our dimension.
451360	454120	You know, it's not tied to their spirits or something.
454480	459160	Without a monarch on the throne, all the trees would wither and die or something.
459440	467320	No, the land and our ability to do profitable things with it would still be there without the monarchy. A more accurate sum here is
467600	473840	40 million pounds against nothing. You know, why not kick the royals out and keep
474560	477160	100% of the revenue, you might ask.
477760	480400	But perhaps that's not enough for you because you're a real greedy geezer.
480640	485040	Why not kick the royals out and keep 100% of the revenue? Because it's still their land.
485360	489000	King George the crazy wasn't crazy enough to give up everything, just the profits.
489280	492600	But it wasn't only him. Every monarch since King George the third has
492840	495920	voluntarily turned over the profits from their land to the United Kingdom.
496200	501440	If the government stopped paying the royal families living and state expenses, the royals would be forced to take back the profits from their land
501440	504800	and your taxes, dear monarchy haters, would go up, not down.
505320	511360	So there's a lot going on in this clip. First off, I'd like to note the backing away from the initial question,
511360	519520	which was why not kick the royals out, to the much softer scenario of the government simply stopping paying for their expenses,
520160	525320	after which the royals would apparently be forced to stop turning over the revenue from the crown estate.
525360	530900	My first issue with this is that CGP Grey's version of kicking the royals out appears to
531140	538820	arbitrarily leave them with all their land and wealth, and also the apparent ability to negotiate from a position of power with the British government.
539020	543660	And I have to ask why he's imposing these measures. You see, although
544180	550660	CGP Grey says it's still their land, the crown estate is not actually the monarch's private property.
550700	555020	They cannot do with it as they wish. If they were to be able to quote
555300	559820	take back the revenue from the property overseen by the crown estate, this would involve
560580	564940	renegotiating the arrangement with the government and coming away with private ownership of
565700	571700	everything, which is ludicrous. Although to be fair, given how the Brexit negotiations are going,
571700	576460	maybe it's not. You see, my version of kicking the royals out involves
576980	582100	confiscating all their stuff, because it's not really their stuff at the end of the day.
582100	586500	They inherited it from someone who inherited it from someone, et cetera,
587060	591580	who claimed ownership of it by killing everyone who disagreed with them.
591580	599140	It wouldn't exactly be kicking the royals out if we left them with sole ownership of huge parts of the country, would it?
599500	606500	CGP Grey is basically saying, after we abolish the monarchy, the monarchy will then respond by saying, et cetera.
606860	610560	And no, after we've abolished the monarchy, they've been abolished.
610720	616240	They don't get a turn. This is a particular sort of bad faith argument that I've seen a few times.
616280	618280	Let me give you another example.
618280	622040	Do you support an increase in green renewable energy?
622040	627000	And I imagine most of you would say yes, unless you happen to be oil barons or something.
627000	633800	Now, what I'm going to do is fixate on that one opinion of yours and extrapolate from that way more than is logical or necessary.
634000	639460	So you support an increase in green energy, which means you support the decrease of the use of fossil fuels,
639700	645140	which means you support the current employees of the fossil fuel industry being made unemployed.
645140	650100	And how cruel of you, just before Christmas and everything, you classist monster.
650100	656900	And before you can protest that you also support, I don't know, job guarantees for fossil fuel workers or
657100	661460	various welfare systems or a universal basic income or something like that,
661460	668500	I've already run away with my fingers in my ears saying, la la la, I can't hear you, you classist monster.
668540	671940	Now, I'm speaking from experience here because I've had this happen to me.
672460	678820	Reality isn't turn-based, however. We can support and do multiple things at the same time.
678820	685460	So in this case, my bill to abolish the monarchy would say, we're no longer paying for the royal family's expenses and
686060	689220	also, the crown estate will henceforth be publicly owned and
689660	697420	also, the Royals will lose all hereditary positions and powers and also, if you don't like that, you can go and sit on your crown,
697700	699140	which is now ours.
699140	701140	So anyway, that's the land
701140	708120	argument dealt with there. Now, the other common response to the argument that the Royals cost the country is the tourism argument.
708740	712380	Tourists come here just to see the Queen, apparently.
712620	717300	Plus, 160 million is just the easily measurable money the United Kingdom makes from the royal family.
717300	720020	Don't forget their huge indirect golden goose, tourists.
720420	723900	Annoying though they might be to the locals by blocking the tube and refusing to stand on the right,
723900	730740	they dump buckets of money on the UK to see the sights, travel ludicrously short distances by public transport, and generally act silly a long
730740	733340	way from home. Sure, not everything they come to see is royal,
733340	737560	but the most expensive stuff is. And who are the biggest spenders? The Yanks.
738100	744860	After they finish buying maple syrup and cheap pharmaceuticals, T1 and professional services and illegal pharmaceuticals, where do they go next? The United Kingdom.
745460	749380	Americans fly across an ocean to see a land filled with castles that aren't plastic.
749460	756420	And why do the Americans think France's castles are so boring and stinky and the UK's castles are so awesome? Because real monarchs still use them.
756740	761100	The Tower of London is so stunning to visitors because the royal crest on the Yeoman Warders uniform is real.
761100	766240	It's not a lame historical reenactment or a modern LARPing quest. It's the embodiment of the living, breathing Queen.
766820	773900	Everywhere you look she sprinkled fairy dust on banal objects to make them magically attractive to tourists, 12 million of whom visit every year spending
774420	779180	7,000 million pounds, which suddenly makes those direct profits look like rather small change.
779380	781780	So there's a lot to talk about right here.
783260	784660	Where to start?
784660	792320	So the comparison with France is particularly audacious and cheeky here because as you might know France makes a lot more money off
792420	797680	tourism than the UK. In 2017 France was the number one tourist destination in the world,
797680	802060	whereas the United Kingdom was seventh with less than half of the number of
802420	808080	individual tourists. The Palace of Versailles gets vastly more visitors each year than Buckingham Palace.
808380	813860	According to a CNN travel report, in 2013 Versailles had over 7 million visitors and
814260	820400	Buckingham Palace had less than 1 million. So living monarchs don't seem to be that big of a tourist attraction.
820500	824600	So how does CGP Grey get away with this France comparison?
824600	832280	Well, he needlessly limits himself to talking about just one group of people that happen to visit the UK modern France and that's
832600	840380	Americans. And there is absolutely no reason to do this except to give the false impression that the UK attracts more visitors than France,
840480	844060	when if you consider all tourists, it's not even close.
844460	847680	Also as a little aside here, when CGP Grey says,
847680	853880	why do Americans think France's castles are so boring and stinky and the UK's castles are so awesome,
853920	859760	he shows pictures of two castles. Now the boring and stinky castle is the fortress of
859920	867400	Najac in France and the awesome castle is Mont Saint-Michel in, no prizes for guessing, this one,
867920	875280	France. They're both French castles. Well, actually this one isn't a castle, but you know, whatever, they're both in France.
875640	881400	What CGP Grey has done is mix up this place with this place, Saint Michael's Mount,
881400	887220	which has a similar name and appearance but is actually in the UK. Now given that CGP Grey, an
887340	893620	American, can't tell the difference between a French castle and an English one, that kind of disproves this point there.
893940	897100	Hardy ha. An error was made on the internet.
898220	904840	Regardless, tourists don't get a cup of tea and a chat with the Queen or anything when they go to see a royal property.
905100	907860	Whether the Royals are around or not doesn't matter.
908020	914140	The buildings are still gonna be there and again, as we've seen, more people go to see France's
914260	922020	palaces and they got all choppy with their monarchs. And that's the thing, even if the actual monarchy was officially abolished, the people,
922020	924400	you know, the family, would still exist.
924620	931980	They'd still live in the country. If they're meant to be a draw by themselves, they'd be nothing stopping them from being, you know.
932020	937300	I'm sure they'd still be invited to events and to open buildings and whatever else, you know.
937300	943540	The difference is that they'd have to pay their own way and I don't even imagine that would be particularly difficult for them.
943540	947800	They'd still be a celebrity family regardless of official status.
947800	952200	I imagine there'd be a lot of monarchists around who'd be willing to send them their money.
952420	955480	You know, maybe they could do a GoFundMe or something.
955480	963380	To sum up here, without the monarchy, the land would still exist, the royal estates would still exist, and the people who are
963460	969140	currently the Royals would still exist. All that would change is that our government would stop
969300	975340	funneling millions of pounds into the pockets of one particular, already rich family.
975340	977540	Now, what else haven't I mentioned here?
977540	983660	Well, very quickly, CGP Grey gives the impression that the Royals turn over the income from all of their lands,
983660	985660	but this isn't actually true.
985740	993520	The duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall are administered separately from the Crown Estate and the Royals don't have to turn over the revenue from those,
993520	997780	and they're not subject to tax. The Royals voluntarily,
997780	1005140	how nice of them, pay income tax on the income generated by the duchies. Less official expenditures, of course.
1005140	1008380	However, they remain exempt from corporation tax.
1008580	1016420	The duchies have been valued together at more than a billion pounds, and this is, of course, not mentioned by CGP Grey.
1016860	1021000	That's about it for me today, folks. That's a short one, isn't it, from me?
1021000	1024260	I usually make longer videos than this, but to be honest,
1024300	1029620	I just needed to get this one out of my system. If you're desperate for more content,
1029620	1035420	I have a little announcement to make. Today is the two-year anniversary of me joining Patreon.
1036220	1041620	Patreon. And I thought I'd do a little something fun and special for all my backers over there.
1041860	1047800	But then I couldn't think of anything, so I waffled into a microphone about YouTube for 20 minutes.
1047860	1053860	So if you'd like to hear me talking a bunch of nonsense for a while, head over there and take a look.
1054620	1061780	Right, remember to like and subscribe and all that, and follow me on Twitter or ask me a question on Curious Cat, if you fancy.
1062540	1064540	Brackets. Links below.
1064900	1066900	Righty-ho, folks. See you next time.
