00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Hello there, guys. This is just a short video that I need to make to get out of my system

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,200
so that I can get back to doing something actually productive.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,040
I'm going to be talking about a video on the TED-Ed channel.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,720
And now they put out little animations explaining different scientific and philosophical ideas,

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,600
and sometimes they'll do a video explaining some mathematical or logical puzzle.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,600
It's a neat channel and I generally really like it.

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,960
But the video I want to talk about is one I watched recently called

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,080
Can You Solve the Frog Riddle? by Derek Abbott.

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,080
And if you haven't seen it, I'd advise you pause this video here and go watch it.

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,640
It's only four minutes long, so off you go. I'll see you in four minutes.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:49,960
["Can You Solve the Frog Riddle?" by Derek Abbott plays in the background.]

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,000
Welcome back.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,480
Now, before I get started here, I just want to clarify that I am completely mathematically inept.

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,640
I have no clue what I'm talking about generally when it comes to maths.

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,000
I can't even remember the order of operations.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,800
And I understand the person who wrote the Frog Riddle is a university professor

17
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,400
with a whole alphabet's worth of letters before his name,

18
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,880
so if you're betting on this, I'd honestly go with me being wrong here.

19
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,160
And a little disclaimer before we get started.

20
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,960
When I got the sense this riddle was wrong, I googled,

21
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,600
Is Ted Edd's Frog Riddle Wrong? and found pages and pages of discussion,

22
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,440
all of which look like this, and none of which I understood.

23
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,200
But I did find a video by the channel Mind Your Decisions,

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,160
which again, it does look like this, but I think I understood enough of it

25
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,320
to maybe get a mathematical understanding of why the riddle's wrong.

26
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,920
So, full props to the Mind Your Decisions channel for doing what I'm going to assume and hope

27
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:57,240
is the correct mathematical legwork, um, although I understand it's somewhat contentious.

28
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:04,840
Now, all I can do with my video is try to translate this into something understandable

29
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,320
by me and the rest of the mathematically inept people out there.

30
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,840
So let's look at the riddle.

31
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,840
You need to find a female frog or you'll die.

32
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,240
And you're aware of a unique croak that only males of the species do.

33
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,080
Otherwise, the males and females are indistinguishable.

34
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,480
Now, if you see one frog alone on a stump and you don't hear it croak,

35
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,680
that's a 50-50 chance of it being male or female.

36
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,240
I'm with the riddle's reasoning so far.

37
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,160
Then you hear a croak behind you.

38
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,040
You turn around and you see two frogs.

39
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,480
So you know that at least one frog of the pair is male, but you don't know which one.

40
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,000
What's the chance that the pair contains a female?

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So the gut feeling on this is obviously, well, 50%.

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,760
It doesn't matter which frog croaked,

43
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,160
because the other one has a 50-50 chance of being male or female regardless.

44
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,120
This is what the TED-Ed video calls wrong answer number one,

45
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,280
and I actually accept their reasoning as to why it's wrong.

46
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,120
You see, they write out the sample space of possible combinations.

47
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,920
And they say hearing a croak eliminates the possibility of two females,

48
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,200
so they end up with this.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,800
Now, I don't know why the male and female combination is counted twice here,

50
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,920
but whatever.

51
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,200
Enough people seem to accept that those are different possibilities,

52
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,120
that I'm just gonna concede that point.

53
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,560
I'm ignorant and I don't get why they're different,

54
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,480
but okay, they're different.

55
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,440
Now, my problem with the riddle is how we find out the additional information.

56
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,440
The croaking.

57
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,760
You see, I'd be willing to accept the riddle's logic if there was no croaking,

58
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,440
but maybe, like, a sign near the frogs that said,

59
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,600
at least one of these two frogs is male.

60
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,280
You know, if we could trust a random sign in the jungle.

61
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,920
But the croaking changes things.

62
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,320
And here's my problem with it.

63
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,760
We're not told why the frogs croak or how often,

64
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,520
so we'll just assume that all male frogs croak, on average, at a similar rate.

65
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,160
Now, logically, two male frogs will croak around twice as much

66
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,680
over a given time period as one male frog.

67
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,960
Which means if hearing a croak over a short time period

68
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,680
is your only way of identifying a male,

69
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,520
the middle possibility here becomes twice as likely,

70
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,920
because either frog could have croaked.

71
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,160
These are the only three possibilities,

72
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,640
but because of how we find out the information,

73
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,520
you know, a behavior which would occur twice as much with two males,

74
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,720
they're not all equally likely possibilities.

75
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,040
And if we account for the increased likelihood of the middle possibility occurring,

76
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,560
I'd put the odds of surviving back down at around 50%.

77
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,080
And why only around and not exactly?

78
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,160
Again, this is a gut feeling here,

79
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,920
but I guess you need to account for the odds of hearing one male croak

80
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,960
and not hearing the other male croak.

81
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,680
But I am rapidly getting out of my depth here

82
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,160
and sort of wandering back into this territory,

83
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,040
so I'm just gonna leave that alone.

84
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,280
So there we go.

85
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,360
That's my take on the frog riddle.

86
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,560
Do you agree?

87
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,760
Am I wrong?

88
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,200
If you think I'm wrong, please leave a comment explaining why I'm wrong

89
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,520
so I can hopefully agree with you

90
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,600
and then stop thinking about this entirely,

91
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,680
because I've got things to do.
