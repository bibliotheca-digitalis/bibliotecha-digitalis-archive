00:00.000 --> 00:05.760
Hello there, guys. This is just a short video that I need to make to get out of my system

00:05.760 --> 00:09.200
so that I can get back to doing something actually productive.

00:09.200 --> 00:13.040
I'm going to be talking about a video on the TED-Ed channel.

00:13.040 --> 00:18.720
And now they put out little animations explaining different scientific and philosophical ideas,

00:18.720 --> 00:23.600
and sometimes they'll do a video explaining some mathematical or logical puzzle.

00:23.600 --> 00:26.600
It's a neat channel and I generally really like it.

00:26.680 --> 00:29.960
But the video I want to talk about is one I watched recently called

00:29.960 --> 00:33.080
Can You Solve the Frog Riddle? by Derek Abbott.

00:33.080 --> 00:37.080
And if you haven't seen it, I'd advise you pause this video here and go watch it.

00:37.080 --> 00:41.640
It's only four minutes long, so off you go. I'll see you in four minutes.

00:41.640 --> 00:49.960
["Can You Solve the Frog Riddle?" by Derek Abbott plays in the background.]

00:49.960 --> 00:51.000
Welcome back.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.480
Now, before I get started here, I just want to clarify that I am completely mathematically inept.

00:57.480 --> 01:01.640
I have no clue what I'm talking about generally when it comes to maths.

01:01.640 --> 01:05.000
I can't even remember the order of operations.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.800
And I understand the person who wrote the Frog Riddle is a university professor

01:09.800 --> 01:13.400
with a whole alphabet's worth of letters before his name,

01:13.400 --> 01:17.880
so if you're betting on this, I'd honestly go with me being wrong here.

01:17.880 --> 01:21.160
And a little disclaimer before we get started.

01:21.160 --> 01:23.960
When I got the sense this riddle was wrong, I googled,

01:23.960 --> 01:28.600
Is Ted Edd's Frog Riddle Wrong? and found pages and pages of discussion,

01:28.600 --> 01:32.440
all of which look like this, and none of which I understood.

01:32.440 --> 01:36.200
But I did find a video by the channel Mind Your Decisions,

01:36.200 --> 01:41.160
which again, it does look like this, but I think I understood enough of it

01:41.160 --> 01:45.320
to maybe get a mathematical understanding of why the riddle's wrong.

01:45.320 --> 01:50.920
So, full props to the Mind Your Decisions channel for doing what I'm going to assume and hope

01:50.920 --> 01:57.240
is the correct mathematical legwork, um, although I understand it's somewhat contentious.

01:57.240 --> 02:04.840
Now, all I can do with my video is try to translate this into something understandable

02:04.840 --> 02:09.320
by me and the rest of the mathematically inept people out there.

02:09.320 --> 02:10.840
So let's look at the riddle.

02:10.840 --> 02:14.840
You need to find a female frog or you'll die.

02:14.840 --> 02:19.240
And you're aware of a unique croak that only males of the species do.

02:19.240 --> 02:23.080
Otherwise, the males and females are indistinguishable.

02:23.080 --> 02:27.480
Now, if you see one frog alone on a stump and you don't hear it croak,

02:27.480 --> 02:30.680
that's a 50-50 chance of it being male or female.

02:30.680 --> 02:33.240
I'm with the riddle's reasoning so far.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.160
Then you hear a croak behind you.

02:35.160 --> 02:38.040
You turn around and you see two frogs.

02:38.040 --> 02:43.480
So you know that at least one frog of the pair is male, but you don't know which one.

02:44.120 --> 02:47.000
What's the chance that the pair contains a female?

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
So the gut feeling on this is obviously, well, 50%.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.760
It doesn't matter which frog croaked,

02:52.760 --> 02:57.160
because the other one has a 50-50 chance of being male or female regardless.

02:58.280 --> 03:02.120
This is what the TED-Ed video calls wrong answer number one,

03:02.120 --> 03:06.280
and I actually accept their reasoning as to why it's wrong.

03:06.280 --> 03:10.120
You see, they write out the sample space of possible combinations.

03:10.840 --> 03:14.920
And they say hearing a croak eliminates the possibility of two females,

03:14.920 --> 03:16.200
so they end up with this.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.800
Now, I don't know why the male and female combination is counted twice here,

03:21.800 --> 03:22.920
but whatever.

03:22.920 --> 03:26.200
Enough people seem to accept that those are different possibilities,

03:26.200 --> 03:28.120
that I'm just gonna concede that point.

03:28.760 --> 03:31.560
I'm ignorant and I don't get why they're different,

03:31.560 --> 03:33.480
but okay, they're different.

03:34.040 --> 03:38.440
Now, my problem with the riddle is how we find out the additional information.

03:39.160 --> 03:40.440
The croaking.

03:40.440 --> 03:44.760
You see, I'd be willing to accept the riddle's logic if there was no croaking,

03:44.760 --> 03:48.440
but maybe, like, a sign near the frogs that said,

03:48.440 --> 03:50.600
at least one of these two frogs is male.

03:51.400 --> 03:54.280
You know, if we could trust a random sign in the jungle.

03:54.840 --> 03:56.920
But the croaking changes things.

03:57.560 --> 03:59.320
And here's my problem with it.

03:59.320 --> 04:02.760
We're not told why the frogs croak or how often,

04:02.760 --> 04:08.520
so we'll just assume that all male frogs croak, on average, at a similar rate.

04:08.520 --> 04:13.160
Now, logically, two male frogs will croak around twice as much

04:13.160 --> 04:16.680
over a given time period as one male frog.

04:16.680 --> 04:19.960
Which means if hearing a croak over a short time period

04:19.960 --> 04:22.680
is your only way of identifying a male,

04:22.680 --> 04:26.520
the middle possibility here becomes twice as likely,

04:26.520 --> 04:28.920
because either frog could have croaked.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.160
These are the only three possibilities,

04:31.160 --> 04:33.640
but because of how we find out the information,

04:34.200 --> 04:38.520
you know, a behavior which would occur twice as much with two males,

04:38.520 --> 04:41.720
they're not all equally likely possibilities.

04:41.720 --> 04:46.040
And if we account for the increased likelihood of the middle possibility occurring,

04:46.040 --> 04:49.560
I'd put the odds of surviving back down at around 50%.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.080
And why only around and not exactly?

04:53.080 --> 04:55.160
Again, this is a gut feeling here,

04:55.160 --> 04:58.920
but I guess you need to account for the odds of hearing one male croak

04:59.560 --> 05:01.960
and not hearing the other male croak.

05:01.960 --> 05:04.680
But I am rapidly getting out of my depth here

05:04.680 --> 05:07.160
and sort of wandering back into this territory,

05:07.160 --> 05:10.040
so I'm just gonna leave that alone.

05:11.160 --> 05:12.280
So there we go.

05:12.280 --> 05:14.360
That's my take on the frog riddle.

05:14.360 --> 05:15.560
Do you agree?

05:15.560 --> 05:16.760
Am I wrong?

05:16.760 --> 05:20.200
If you think I'm wrong, please leave a comment explaining why I'm wrong

05:20.200 --> 05:22.520
so I can hopefully agree with you

05:22.520 --> 05:24.600
and then stop thinking about this entirely,

05:24.600 --> 05:26.680
because I've got things to do.
