0	5760	Hello there, guys. This is just a short video that I need to make to get out of my system
5760	9200	so that I can get back to doing something actually productive.
9200	13040	I'm going to be talking about a video on the TED-Ed channel.
13040	18720	And now they put out little animations explaining different scientific and philosophical ideas,
18720	23600	and sometimes they'll do a video explaining some mathematical or logical puzzle.
23600	26600	It's a neat channel and I generally really like it.
26680	29960	But the video I want to talk about is one I watched recently called
29960	33080	Can You Solve the Frog Riddle? by Derek Abbott.
33080	37080	And if you haven't seen it, I'd advise you pause this video here and go watch it.
37080	41640	It's only four minutes long, so off you go. I'll see you in four minutes.
41640	49960	["Can You Solve the Frog Riddle?" by Derek Abbott plays in the background.]
49960	51000	Welcome back.
51000	57480	Now, before I get started here, I just want to clarify that I am completely mathematically inept.
57480	61640	I have no clue what I'm talking about generally when it comes to maths.
61640	65000	I can't even remember the order of operations.
65000	69800	And I understand the person who wrote the Frog Riddle is a university professor
69800	73400	with a whole alphabet's worth of letters before his name,
73400	77880	so if you're betting on this, I'd honestly go with me being wrong here.
77880	81160	And a little disclaimer before we get started.
81160	83960	When I got the sense this riddle was wrong, I googled,
83960	88600	Is Ted Edd's Frog Riddle Wrong? and found pages and pages of discussion,
88600	92440	all of which look like this, and none of which I understood.
92440	96200	But I did find a video by the channel Mind Your Decisions,
96200	101160	which again, it does look like this, but I think I understood enough of it
101160	105320	to maybe get a mathematical understanding of why the riddle's wrong.
105320	110920	So, full props to the Mind Your Decisions channel for doing what I'm going to assume and hope
110920	117240	is the correct mathematical legwork, um, although I understand it's somewhat contentious.
117240	124840	Now, all I can do with my video is try to translate this into something understandable
124840	129320	by me and the rest of the mathematically inept people out there.
129320	130840	So let's look at the riddle.
130840	134840	You need to find a female frog or you'll die.
134840	139240	And you're aware of a unique croak that only males of the species do.
139240	143080	Otherwise, the males and females are indistinguishable.
143080	147480	Now, if you see one frog alone on a stump and you don't hear it croak,
147480	150680	that's a 50-50 chance of it being male or female.
150680	153240	I'm with the riddle's reasoning so far.
153240	155160	Then you hear a croak behind you.
155160	158040	You turn around and you see two frogs.
158040	163480	So you know that at least one frog of the pair is male, but you don't know which one.
164120	167000	What's the chance that the pair contains a female?
167000	171000	So the gut feeling on this is obviously, well, 50%.
171000	172760	It doesn't matter which frog croaked,
172760	177160	because the other one has a 50-50 chance of being male or female regardless.
178280	182120	This is what the TED-Ed video calls wrong answer number one,
182120	186280	and I actually accept their reasoning as to why it's wrong.
186280	190120	You see, they write out the sample space of possible combinations.
190840	194920	And they say hearing a croak eliminates the possibility of two females,
194920	196200	so they end up with this.
197000	201800	Now, I don't know why the male and female combination is counted twice here,
201800	202920	but whatever.
202920	206200	Enough people seem to accept that those are different possibilities,
206200	208120	that I'm just gonna concede that point.
208760	211560	I'm ignorant and I don't get why they're different,
211560	213480	but okay, they're different.
214040	218440	Now, my problem with the riddle is how we find out the additional information.
219160	220440	The croaking.
220440	224760	You see, I'd be willing to accept the riddle's logic if there was no croaking,
224760	228440	but maybe, like, a sign near the frogs that said,
228440	230600	at least one of these two frogs is male.
231400	234280	You know, if we could trust a random sign in the jungle.
234840	236920	But the croaking changes things.
237560	239320	And here's my problem with it.
239320	242760	We're not told why the frogs croak or how often,
242760	248520	so we'll just assume that all male frogs croak, on average, at a similar rate.
248520	253160	Now, logically, two male frogs will croak around twice as much
253160	256680	over a given time period as one male frog.
256680	259960	Which means if hearing a croak over a short time period
259960	262680	is your only way of identifying a male,
262680	266520	the middle possibility here becomes twice as likely,
266520	268920	because either frog could have croaked.
268920	271160	These are the only three possibilities,
271160	273640	but because of how we find out the information,
274200	278520	you know, a behavior which would occur twice as much with two males,
278520	281720	they're not all equally likely possibilities.
281720	286040	And if we account for the increased likelihood of the middle possibility occurring,
286040	289560	I'd put the odds of surviving back down at around 50%.
290600	293080	And why only around and not exactly?
293080	295160	Again, this is a gut feeling here,
295160	298920	but I guess you need to account for the odds of hearing one male croak
299560	301960	and not hearing the other male croak.
301960	304680	But I am rapidly getting out of my depth here
304680	307160	and sort of wandering back into this territory,
307160	310040	so I'm just gonna leave that alone.
311160	312280	So there we go.
312280	314360	That's my take on the frog riddle.
314360	315560	Do you agree?
315560	316760	Am I wrong?
316760	320200	If you think I'm wrong, please leave a comment explaining why I'm wrong
320200	322520	so I can hopefully agree with you
322520	324600	and then stop thinking about this entirely,
324600	326680	because I've got things to do.
