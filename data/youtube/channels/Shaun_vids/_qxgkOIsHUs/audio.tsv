0	3500	So here we are again, talking about CinemaSins again.
3500	9500	And undoubtedly, some of you out there who've seen my other videos on this subject are saying,
9500	12800	again, isn't this just beating a dead horse at this point?
12800	16600	I mean, we've already said everything that needs to be said about CinemaSins,
16600	19800	anything else is just gonna be retreading old ground.
20400	25400	And to you people, I say, uh, correct.
25900	32400	But to tell you the truth, I just can't get CinemaSins out of my head, for whatever reason that is.
32400	40400	I see the CinemaSins logo in my sleep, I hear Jeremy's voice in my dreams.
40400	47900	When I wake up, I say, oh, waking up from being asleep, cliche.
48900	56400	When I go into the bathroom, I say, oh, here's my toothbrush, Ex Machina.
57400	64400	And at this point, I think the safe thing to do is to just keep pushing forward
64400	66900	until I've got it all out of my system.
67400	71900	So I've watched a few more CinemaSins videos, and a thought struck me.
71900	76400	Someone, probably a crueler person than me with more time on his hands,
76400	81900	could make a fairly good CinemaSins parody video where they were incredibly nitpicky,
82400	86400	and pick CinemaSins up on all of their minor errors that they make.
86400	90400	You know, just little things like saying there's no gravity in space,
90400	96900	or, for instance, in Alien they complain that the spaceship isn't aerodynamic or streamlined,
96900	102900	even though we understand why spaceships in space don't have to be aerodynamic.
102900	106900	They get the Roman numeral for seven wrong and accidentally write twelve.
107400	110900	In Ant-Man, they're confused when they see the ants making a raft
110900	113900	and think there's ants under the surface drowning,
113900	119900	but they've just apparently never seen that happen, like in a nature documentary or anything.
120400	124900	CinemaSins seem to struggle with animal knowledge in general here.
124900	129900	Watch this following clip from the video about the movie Tarzan.
129900	131900	I'll be the best ape ever!
131900	134900	Wait a second, I've been nervous all video about how to refer to these primates.
134900	136400	Apes, gorillas, monkeys, et cetera.
136400	140900	And I assumed, by the inclusion of a silverback alpha male, this movie was telling me they were gorillas.
140900	144400	But this f***ing kid casually calls them all apes, basically, and the movie does not object.
144900	148900	Now, we know that they can be both gorillas and apes,
149400	156400	because an ape is a classification of certain types of animals, which includes gorillas,
156400	160400	and I can't really fault CinemaSins for just not knowing something like that.
160400	163400	That's just something which you either know or you don't.
163900	167400	I will say, though, if I was making a YouTube video about it
167400	170900	that was potentially gonna be watched by millions of people,
170900	174400	I would probably have a quick Google of that first.
175900	178400	But whatever, you know, that's a minor point.
178900	183900	And there's the usual typos, minor spelling and grammatical errors,
183900	189400	which, I mean, they're to be expected, you know, worn out instead of worn out.
189900	193400	They accidentally call Woody Andy in a scene.
194400	196400	They spell Shia Khan's name wrong.
196900	199400	They spell Sacha Baron Cohen's name wrong.
199900	202900	And they pronounce George Takei's name wrong.
203400	204400	Ah, George Takei!
204400	208400	And of course, there's just the minor misunderstandings, things like that.
209400	214400	They think that the antagonist in Kung Fu Panda is a tiger when it's actually a leopard.
215400	221400	In one of the Fast and Furious films, they think that the character Brian drives a Scion when he's driving a Subaru.
221900	225400	In Casino Royale, they call this finger a raccoon.
226900	228900	I'm actually not sure if they're joking here,
228900	233900	because it's so obviously not a raccoon that I think, well, they must just be taking the piss.
234400	237400	In Rocky IV, they call a wristwatch a necklace.
238400	242900	In one of the Turtles films, they call this chocolate bar a breadstick.
243400	245900	They call this thing an iPad when it isn't.
246900	251400	They think Snape's Patronus is a stag when it's actually a dough.
251900	257900	In Wrath of Khan, they think that these Flintlock pistols are revolvers.
258400	262900	And there's other minor points, it's not really fair to pull CinemaSins up on them.
263400	265900	Like this clip from their video on The Jungle Book.
266400	268900	Ten times the rains had come and gone.
269400	273400	So? What the f*** kind of measurement of time is counting the rains? Do you even count?
273900	279400	You see, the rains doesn't mean it's been raining ten times, it means the rainy season.
279900	284400	You see, The Jungle Book's set in India, and they have a monsoon season,
284900	290400	so it's basically saying there's been ten monsoon seasons, which means there's been ten years.
290900	292900	It's just the same as saying ten years later.
293400	296400	But, um, that's a minor misunderstanding.
296900	298400	There's this one from The Incredibles.
305400	311400	You see, Mr. Incredible did break the plate, but he also cut into the table beneath the plate.
311900	317400	That's what he was talking about there, you can actually see the knife sticking up out of the table in the shot.
317900	322900	See if you can spot the mistake in the following clip from, uh, their video on cars.
331400	336900	You see, the problem there was that wasn't Jeremy Piven talking, that was Jeremy Clarkson.
337400	343400	You see, uh, Jeremy Piven did the voice of that character in the US release,
343900	346900	and Jeremy Clarkson did the voice in the UK release.
347400	352400	CinemaSins just mixed up the two, uh, when they were putting the video together, probably.
352900	356900	One guy called Jeremy mixing up two other guys called Jeremy.
357900	361400	It kind of feels like there should be a joke there, but I can't think of one,
361900	367400	so please leave your favorite one guy called Jeremy mixing up other Jeremy's jokes in the comments.
367900	373900	There's also the occasional video editing or audio problem, and again, these are to be expected.
377400	381400	Take one step back, three more.
387400	390400	Also, mine has got to be the clumsiest ninja I've ever heard,
390900	393900	because those who can light three lanterns in one move should get laid no matter what.
394400	399400	There's even the occasional misread line, like in the following clip from their video on Jaws.
399900	402400	But the real problem should be that after one or two shark attacks,
402900	404900	absolutely no one would be coming to these beaches.
405400	407900	Hehe, shark-a-tanks.
408900	409400	Shark-a-tanks.
409900	414900	And see if you can spot the mistake in this next clip, which is also from their video on Jaws.
415400	416900	You may not have heard it, but someone's yelling,
417400	419900	Does anybody have a gun? Amazingly, this is America, and no one does.
421900	422900	What a f***ing baby.
423400	424900	Ah, the days you could smoke in a hospital.
425400	426400	Wait a minute, what am I saying?
426900	428900	Oh, you've got a keen eye if you saw that one.
429400	433400	You see, they gave the movie a sin, they did the ding sound effect,
433400	435400	but the sin counter didn't go up.
436400	439400	And they have trouble with the sin counter in a few different videos.
440400	443400	If you watched their video for Pitch Perfect 2,
444400	449400	the final sin count on that movie gets updated to 144,
450400	453400	just a few frames before the video ends,
454400	460400	and goes into the final sin tally, but that tally says it's 143.
461400	466400	They really lose control of the sin counter in their video for The Hateful Eight.
467400	469400	It jumps from 29 to 31,
470400	472400	from 31 to 33,
473400	475400	from 34 to 36,
476400	478400	from 38 to 40,
479400	481400	from 51 to 48,
482400	485400	then from 48 back up to 54,
486400	489400	and then when it gets to 59, it jumps back down to 55.
490400	494400	So let's leave the unfair minor nitpicks behind for a while,
495400	499400	and move on to the real substantive problems,
500400	503400	in a little segment that I'm going to call
504400	506400	Hey, Cinema Sins.
507400	511400	Maybe try watching the movie, you know, for a change? Yeah?
512400	514400	Why the hell does Quill care if Gamora's being led to her death?
515400	517400	It's not like they've had time to get to know each other,
517400	519400	and before that, there was all that fighting over an orb,
520400	523400	so there's not much in the way of I'll save you from a prison shanking kind of relationship here.
524400	526400	I could care less whether you live or whether you die.
527400	528400	Then why stop the big guy?
529400	531400	Simple. You know where to sell my orb.
532400	536400	When you, why would I put my finger on his throat?
537400	540400	Right, because that of all gestures is unique to Earth, somehow.
541400	543400	It's just a metaphor, dude. His people are completely literal.
544400	545400	Metaphors are going to go over his head.
546400	548400	Oh, the old fake orb trick. Got him.
549400	551400	What the f*** did you get a spare orb from?
552400	554400	And how long have you been carrying it around waiting to pull this little trick?
555400	558400	Once Ronan is dead, we will retrieve the stone.
559400	561400	Use these devices to contain it.
563400	565400	They fail to take the time at any point in this movie to explain why this happens.
566400	567400	It wouldn't take a lot of effort.
568400	569400	They could say that R.L. has a magic typewriter.
570400	571400	I need my typewriter.
572400	573400	What?
573400	575400	That typewriter is on that Smith Corona. It's not just me.
576400	578400	That typewriter is special.
579400	581400	It has a soul of its own.
582400	584400	Also, I know this is a universe filled with monsters,
585400	588400	but this is the only giant we've seen between both of the films Pixar's made about the monster world.
589400	591400	Hey, Ted! Good morning!
592400	593400	You gotta stay away from Katie now.
594400	597400	Okay, so Katie said she talked to this guy Razul and that his story broke her heart,
598400	601400	but she didn't say anything about him being a problem or that he was hurting her or anything.
601400	607400	She didn't want the money back that she'd given him or an apology for the black eye he'd given her.
608400	612400	Well, at least that guy shared his thoughts about there possibly being light beyond the wall before he got shot.
613400	617400	Hello again. I'm just going to be popping in every now and then from now on
618400	623400	to explain all of the ones that can't be shown with just a clip from the movie.
624400	628400	For instance, this clip from the movie Insurgent.
628400	633400	Now, the problem here is CinemaSins seem to think that this guy who got shot
634400	638400	is the one who shared his thoughts about there being life beyond the wall.
639400	643400	The problem is the character who actually shared those thoughts looks like this,
644400	646400	and he is not this guy.
647400	652400	In fact, in this shot you can actually see both characters on screen at the same time.
653400	655400	Now, you think they would have picked up on this
655400	658400	because the character that they fought got shot in the head,
659400	663400	carries on being in the movie after that scene, because he survives.
664400	669400	For example, here he is walking away from that location after the scene ends.
670400	671400	The mystery princess.
672400	674400	There are a lot of unbelievable things I can accept in Cinderella,
675400	677400	but these people not recognizing her at the ball is definitely one I cannot.
678400	679400	Thank God, Mother.
679400	680400	What is it?
681400	682400	My stepmother and the girls.
682400	685400	Don't worry, I'll make sure they don't recognize you.
687400	688400	Now off you go.
689400	693400	Disney, in their all-knowing wisdom, realized a cutaway establishing shot close up on a couple random lizards
694400	696400	would thoroughly add to your enjoyment of the film, and so it was done.
697400	702400	Now, I agree, an establishing shot of just two random lizards in a garden is a bit of a weird one,
703400	704400	and it's worth pointing out.
705400	707400	The problem is, shortly thereafter,
707400	712400	the Fairy Godmother turns those lizards into footmen,
713400	717400	and it's at that point, if I were writing the CinemaSins video, I'd say,
718400	722400	Oh, right, so that's what was up with the establishing shot of the lizards,
723400	726400	because they then become important to the movie after the fact,
727400	729400	and I would have went back and deleted the first one,
730400	733400	but apparently CinemaSins don't have time for that.
733400	738400	And actually, a few sins later, CinemaSins think that the footmen are made out of mice,
739400	741400	and a few sins after that, they think they're made out of frogs,
742400	744400	so I don't- I don't know.
745400	747400	I don't even know what's happening anymore.
750400	752400	Does anyone else want to shoot this guy since he's only one person?
753400	755400	I will never understand these monster warrior guys and their techniques.
757400	759400	We need to find the leader. Mangalores won't fight without the leader.
759400	762400	One more shot. Must start killing hostages.
763400	764400	That's the leader.
765400	766400	It ends tonight.
767400	769400	I know it does. I've seen it.
770400	773400	That's why the rest of me is just going to enjoy the show.
774400	776400	A couple problems here. First off, how is Smith getting visions now?
777400	782400	Now, where would Agent Smith have possibly gained the ability to see into the future?
783400	788400	We all know the character in the Matrix films who can see into the future
789400	795400	is the Oracle, and Agent Smith and the Oracle are different characters, obviously.
796400	803400	So, where on earth does Agent Smith get the ability to see into the future?
805400	806400	When did that happen?
808400	813400	I believe it was Snape in the earlier movie who somehow knew Harry was eavesdropping on the teachers outside Dumbledore's office, right?
814400	815400	And said this conversation is no longer private, right?
816400	819400	It may interest you to know this conversation is no longer private.
821400	823400	Closed? What the ever-loving f**k?
824400	827400	First off, Robert opened the door freely. Second off, it's broad daylight outside.
828400	831400	And third, the hours posted clearly state that you're closed at 9pm, not when Wheel of Fortune is on.
832400	837400	Oh, uh, my mom had a little accident here last night. There was a fire.
838400	839400	I see.
840400	843400	Stealing is bad, kids, so if you take something that doesn't belong to you, leave a few bucks behind.
843400	848400	So here, CinemaSins think that the Turtles steal pizzas off this pizza delivery man.
849400	856400	The problem is, he was delivering pizzas to them, but ended up in a fight which the Turtles then rescue him from.
857400	865400	Now, the only reason they were looking for him in the first place is because he was delivering their pizzas, and this is actually established earlier on.
866400	868400	We got another warning for that O'Neill woman.
869400	870400	Are you kidding me? Hell?
871400	873400	This happened during the Civil War?
874400	875400	I was the youngest major in the Texas Cavalry.
876400	882400	Okay, f**k, did the first movie not say he was recently turned, or at least new, and that's why he was so compulsively drawn to bite Bella?
883400	884400	Or did I dream that s**t?
885400	889400	If he was turned during the Civil War, there should be no reason he was more tempted to bite Bella than any of the others in the first movie.
890400	894400	Sorry, Jasper's our newest vegetarian. It's a little difficult for him.
895400	896400	It's a pleasure to meet you.
896400	903400	Now, vegetarian is kind of a stupid term here, and doesn't really make any sense in context, and I will grant CinemaSins that.
904400	912400	But what the vampires mean here is, Jasper is the newest convert to the group of vampires who only prey on animals and don't prey on humans.
913400	915400	That's why he has a hard time being around humans.
916400	919400	It doesn't mean that he was only just recently turned into a vampire.
920400	921400	Didn't they blow up this dam in the last movie?
921400	927400	I guess it's a different dam, but since I have no idea where the other dam was or why it was important, I reserve the right to claim the filmmakers didn't either.
928400	939400	So, CinemaSins gives the final Hunger Games movie a sin for having a dam in it, which is one of the weirder sins I think they've ever done.
940400	945400	And it's a good example of a time in which CinemaSins just needs to pad out the runtime of a video.
946400	952400	So, basically anything that the movie shows them, they give a sin to.
953400	960400	They try and get a laugh here because they pretend not to remember if this dam is the same dam that got destroyed in the last movie.
961400	970400	The problem is, in a previous sin in that video, they correctly identified the location of the dam, that they're now pretending not to know where it is.
971400	972400	I understand why.
973400	974400	Why I did it.
974400	978400	How on earth was she able to contact them? She must have sent a carrier pigeon in a deleted scene.
978400	982400	So fuck me, I guess, for saying that I'd never watched The Scorch Trials.
983400	987400	So how does this character contact the antagonist?
988400	990400	Well, this is a really subtle one, actually.
990400	998400	So earlier in the film, the main characters meet this guy, who has a radio that he's using to communicate with the antagonists.
998400	1003400	There's a short fight scene, and that guy gets shot, and he drops the radio.
1004400	1009400	And we see, just for a split second, that character looking at the radio on the floor.
1009400	1014400	And this radio is how she was able to contact the antagonists later on in the film.
1014400	1018400	Now that's a very subtle one, and I don't blame anyone at all for missing it.
1019400	1025400	Am I still gonna do the stamp and the horn sound effect for missing such a minor moment?
1026400	1028400	I'll go on, then.
1033400	1038400	Even if you're clearly stupid, like Bumper and his team is, I don't see how you think that What's Love Got To Do With It has anything to do with John Mayer.
1038400	1039400	But let's rewind for a second.
1040400	1047400	What does A Thousand Miles have to do with John Mayer, or that Taylor Swift song that was supposed to be about Jake Gyllenhaal?
1047400	1049400	This is actually a stupid-ass category when it comes down to it.
1050400	1057400	Thanks a lot, CinemaSins, for making me watch Pitch Perfect 2. I will never forgive you.
1058400	1067400	But in that scene, the category is I Dated John Mayer, and the three songs are What's Love Got To Do With It by Tina Turner.
1067400	1073400	Now that gets the group who sing it eliminated because that doesn't have anything at all to do with John Mayer.
1074400	1087400	The other two songs, though, A Thousand Miles is sung by Vanessa Carlton, and We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together or whatever that's called, is sung by Taylor Swift.
1087400	1092400	And now Vanessa Carlton and Taylor Swift both dated John Mayer.
1092400	1099400	The category is songs by people who dated John Mayer, not just something to do with John Mayer.
1123400	1126400	Well, obviously, she wanted to have the party before the move.
1129400	1132400	You will, because when Bob walked out a bit ago, it shut just fine.
1149400	1150400	Are we getting close?
1152400	1154400	Why is Sadness pretending to know which way to go?
1166400	1170400	Just a little aside about the movie inside out here.
1170400	1179400	CinemaSins, a couple of times, give the movie a sin for having four negative emotions and one positive one.
1179400	1184400	And this isn't something that can really be contradicted exactly, because it's a matter of opinion,
1184400	1192400	but the message of Inside Out was that the other four emotions, particularly Sadness, aren't negative emotions,
1192400	1198400	and Joy isn't necessarily a good emotion or a positive one.
1198400	1205400	The, you know, the conclusion of the film is about how useful Sadness can be.
1205400	1209400	It makes other people empathize with the main character.
1209400	1214400	It's the standard, you can't really have happiness without Sadness story.
1214400	1222400	And it's aimed at little kids, and it's kind of stressing me out a little that CinemaSins missed it.
1223400	1224400	Um...
1226400	1228400	I need to calm down.
1235400	1241400	So, CinemaSins think that Elektra was paid for this assassination on site.
1241400	1244400	Now, here is the assassination.
1244400	1249400	You can see the room she's in, you can see the clothes that she's wearing.
1249400	1252400	Then there's a transition to a completely different location,
1252400	1261400	and there's a long conversation between a bunch of Japanese men that I didn't really pay attention to.
1261400	1266400	But then, after that, there's another transition with another establishing shot of a different building.
1266400	1273400	And this is the building that Elektra gets paid in, which I'm just gonna presume is her house.
1273400	1277400	And, of course, she's wearing a completely different outfit.
1277400	1279400	So, I have no idea what happened here.
1279400	1283400	I think, um, CinemaSins sort of nodded off at the wheel there,
1283400	1287400	and missed that entire scene with all of the Japanese men.
1288400	1292400	Oh man, Stargate. Where to even start with this one?
1292400	1296400	CinemaSins get the basic premise of the movie wrong?
1296400	1302400	Do you remember that episode of The Simpsons where Sideshow Bob just kept on stepping on rakes over and over?
1302400	1304400	They do the equivalent of that.
1304400	1309400	So, in Stargate, an alien comes to Earth thousands of years ago,
1309400	1313400	takes a bunch of humans prisoner, takes them through the Stargate.
1313400	1320400	So, when modern day humans go through, they find humans on the planet that they go to.
1320400	1326400	They're not aliens. They are humans taken from Earth, from ancient Egypt.
1326400	1330400	And that's why they look human and all their architecture is ancient Egyptian.
1330400	1335400	CinemaSins get this completely backwards and think that aliens came here through the Stargate,
1335400	1341400	just happened to look human, and then built the pyramids and such on Earth.
1341400	1346400	And then they just faceplant over and over again, not understanding this.
1346400	1348400	It really worked out that these aliens look exactly like humans,
1348400	1351400	and the ruler guy's daughter is hot, or this would have been really awkward.
1352400	1354400	This is a replica of the Great Pyramid of Giza.
1354400	1357400	Isn't the whole point that the Great Pyramid of Giza is a replica of this?
1358400	1362400	You see, if you don't turn it on from here, we're screwed.
1362400	1365400	But why though? Does the Stargate only work in the direction where it's activated?
1366400	1373400	CinemaSins also seem to think that not only did the Stargate take the characters to another planet,
1373400	1379400	it also took them to another dimension, and this is, of course, not true.
1379400	1386400	Also, the reason that Jackson thinks that he can control the animal is because it's wearing a harness.
1386400	1390400	You see, which means it's probably domesticated.
1390400	1394400	And this is subtly pointed out in the following dialogue exchange.
1395400	1399400	I wouldn't feed that thing. It's got a harness!
1400400	1409400	Finally then, let's talk about Zootopia, and in particular, the first sin in the video.
1409400	1411400	50 goddamn seconds of Disney-related logo s***.
1411400	1414400	Now this is something CinemaSins always do.
1415400	1421400	They give a movie a sin for having logos at the start of it.
1421400	1427400	And they go, 45 seconds of logos, 50 seconds of logos, blah blah blah.
1427400	1432400	Like, that's the worst thing in the world.
1432400	1437400	Now, I actually don't mind these logos at the start of movies.
1438400	1446400	Some studios, particularly animation studios, you know, they can do something a little unique with each one that sets the mood.
1446400	1453400	Usually they might have music behind the logos also setting the mood.
1453400	1460400	Now, the reason I picked Zootopia to talk about here is because of a sin later on in the video.
1460400	1462400	Let's take a look at that.
1462400	1464400	They're all sloths?
1464400	1470400	Hilarious DMV is slow joke from Pixar. It's only about 12 years too late to be timely, but whatever. Good slowest slow joke, y'all.
1470400	1476400	Now the problem here is, Zootopia isn't a Pixar movie.
1476400	1478400	It wasn't made by Pixar.
1478400	1489400	And if CinemaSins had actually bothered to watch the 50 goddamn seconds of Disney-related logo s***, they would have noticed this.
1489400	1496400	Sharkatanks.
