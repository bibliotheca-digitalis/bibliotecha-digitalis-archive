1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
So here we are again, talking about CinemaSins again.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:09,500
And undoubtedly, some of you out there who've seen my other videos on this subject are saying,

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,800
again, isn't this just beating a dead horse at this point?

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,600
I mean, we've already said everything that needs to be said about CinemaSins,

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,800
anything else is just gonna be retreading old ground.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,400
And to you people, I say, uh, correct.

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:32,400
But to tell you the truth, I just can't get CinemaSins out of my head, for whatever reason that is.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:40,400
I see the CinemaSins logo in my sleep, I hear Jeremy's voice in my dreams.

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:47,900
When I wake up, I say, oh, waking up from being asleep, cliche.

10
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:56,400
When I go into the bathroom, I say, oh, here's my toothbrush, Ex Machina.

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:04,400
And at this point, I think the safe thing to do is to just keep pushing forward

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,900
until I've got it all out of my system.

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,900
So I've watched a few more CinemaSins videos, and a thought struck me.

14
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,400
Someone, probably a crueler person than me with more time on his hands,

15
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,900
could make a fairly good CinemaSins parody video where they were incredibly nitpicky,

16
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,400
and pick CinemaSins up on all of their minor errors that they make.

17
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,400
You know, just little things like saying there's no gravity in space,

18
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,900
or, for instance, in Alien they complain that the spaceship isn't aerodynamic or streamlined,

19
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,900
even though we understand why spaceships in space don't have to be aerodynamic.

20
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,900
They get the Roman numeral for seven wrong and accidentally write twelve.

21
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,900
In Ant-Man, they're confused when they see the ants making a raft

22
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,900
and think there's ants under the surface drowning,

23
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:59,900
but they've just apparently never seen that happen, like in a nature documentary or anything.

24
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,900
CinemaSins seem to struggle with animal knowledge in general here.

25
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,900
Watch this following clip from the video about the movie Tarzan.

26
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,900
I'll be the best ape ever!

27
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,900
Wait a second, I've been nervous all video about how to refer to these primates.

28
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,400
Apes, gorillas, monkeys, et cetera.

29
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,900
And I assumed, by the inclusion of a silverback alpha male, this movie was telling me they were gorillas.

30
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,400
But this f***ing kid casually calls them all apes, basically, and the movie does not object.

31
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,900
Now, we know that they can be both gorillas and apes,

32
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:36,400
because an ape is a classification of certain types of animals, which includes gorillas,

33
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,400
and I can't really fault CinemaSins for just not knowing something like that.

34
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,400
That's just something which you either know or you don't.

35
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,400
I will say, though, if I was making a YouTube video about it

36
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,900
that was potentially gonna be watched by millions of people,

37
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,400
I would probably have a quick Google of that first.

38
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,400
But whatever, you know, that's a minor point.

39
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,900
And there's the usual typos, minor spelling and grammatical errors,

40
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,400
which, I mean, they're to be expected, you know, worn out instead of worn out.

41
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,400
They accidentally call Woody Andy in a scene.

42
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
They spell Shia Khan's name wrong.

43
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,400
They spell Sacha Baron Cohen's name wrong.

44
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,900
And they pronounce George Takei's name wrong.

45
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,400
Ah, George Takei!

46
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,400
And of course, there's just the minor misunderstandings, things like that.

47
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,400
They think that the antagonist in Kung Fu Panda is a tiger when it's actually a leopard.

48
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,400
In one of the Fast and Furious films, they think that the character Brian drives a Scion when he's driving a Subaru.

49
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,400
In Casino Royale, they call this finger a raccoon.

50
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,900
I'm actually not sure if they're joking here,

51
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,900
because it's so obviously not a raccoon that I think, well, they must just be taking the piss.

52
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,400
In Rocky IV, they call a wristwatch a necklace.

53
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,900
In one of the Turtles films, they call this chocolate bar a breadstick.

54
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,900
They call this thing an iPad when it isn't.

55
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,400
They think Snape's Patronus is a stag when it's actually a dough.

56
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:17,900
In Wrath of Khan, they think that these Flintlock pistols are revolvers.

57
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,900
And there's other minor points, it's not really fair to pull CinemaSins up on them.

58
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,900
Like this clip from their video on The Jungle Book.

59
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,900
Ten times the rains had come and gone.

60
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,400
So? What the f*** kind of measurement of time is counting the rains? Do you even count?

61
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:39,400
You see, the rains doesn't mean it's been raining ten times, it means the rainy season.

62
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,400
You see, The Jungle Book's set in India, and they have a monsoon season,

63
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:50,400
so it's basically saying there's been ten monsoon seasons, which means there's been ten years.

64
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,900
It's just the same as saying ten years later.

65
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,400
But, um, that's a minor misunderstanding.

66
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,400
There's this one from The Incredibles.

67
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,400
You see, Mr. Incredible did break the plate, but he also cut into the table beneath the plate.

68
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:17,400
That's what he was talking about there, you can actually see the knife sticking up out of the table in the shot.

69
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,900
See if you can spot the mistake in the following clip from, uh, their video on cars.

70
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,900
You see, the problem there was that wasn't Jeremy Piven talking, that was Jeremy Clarkson.

71
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,400
You see, uh, Jeremy Piven did the voice of that character in the US release,

72
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,900
and Jeremy Clarkson did the voice in the UK release.

73
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,400
CinemaSins just mixed up the two, uh, when they were putting the video together, probably.

74
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,900
One guy called Jeremy mixing up two other guys called Jeremy.

75
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,400
It kind of feels like there should be a joke there, but I can't think of one,

76
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:07,400
so please leave your favorite one guy called Jeremy mixing up other Jeremy's jokes in the comments.

77
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:13,900
There's also the occasional video editing or audio problem, and again, these are to be expected.

78
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Take one step back, three more.

79
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,400
Also, mine has got to be the clumsiest ninja I've ever heard,

80
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,900
because those who can light three lanterns in one move should get laid no matter what.

81
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,400
There's even the occasional misread line, like in the following clip from their video on Jaws.

82
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,400
But the real problem should be that after one or two shark attacks,

83
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,900
absolutely no one would be coming to these beaches.

84
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,900
Hehe, shark-a-tanks.

85
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,400
Shark-a-tanks.

86
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,900
And see if you can spot the mistake in this next clip, which is also from their video on Jaws.

87
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,900
You may not have heard it, but someone's yelling,

88
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,900
Does anybody have a gun? Amazingly, this is America, and no one does.

89
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,900
What a f***ing baby.

90
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,900
Ah, the days you could smoke in a hospital.

91
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
Wait a minute, what am I saying?

92
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,900
Oh, you've got a keen eye if you saw that one.

93
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,400
You see, they gave the movie a sin, they did the ding sound effect,

94
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,400
but the sin counter didn't go up.

95
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,400
And they have trouble with the sin counter in a few different videos.

96
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,400
If you watched their video for Pitch Perfect 2,

97
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,400
the final sin count on that movie gets updated to 144,

98
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,400
just a few frames before the video ends,

99
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,400
and goes into the final sin tally, but that tally says it's 143.

100
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,400
They really lose control of the sin counter in their video for The Hateful Eight.

101
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,400
It jumps from 29 to 31,

102
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
from 31 to 33,

103
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,400
from 34 to 36,

104
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
from 38 to 40,

105
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,400
from 51 to 48,

106
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,400
then from 48 back up to 54,

107
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,400
and then when it gets to 59, it jumps back down to 55.

108
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,400
So let's leave the unfair minor nitpicks behind for a while,

109
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,400
and move on to the real substantive problems,

110
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,400
in a little segment that I'm going to call

111
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Hey, Cinema Sins.

112
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,400
Maybe try watching the movie, you know, for a change? Yeah?

113
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,400
Why the hell does Quill care if Gamora's being led to her death?

114
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,400
It's not like they've had time to get to know each other,

115
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,400
and before that, there was all that fighting over an orb,

116
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,400
so there's not much in the way of I'll save you from a prison shanking kind of relationship here.

117
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,400
I could care less whether you live or whether you die.

118
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
Then why stop the big guy?

119
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,400
Simple. You know where to sell my orb.

120
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,400
When you, why would I put my finger on his throat?

121
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,400
Right, because that of all gestures is unique to Earth, somehow.

122
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,400
It's just a metaphor, dude. His people are completely literal.

123
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,400
Metaphors are going to go over his head.

124
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Oh, the old fake orb trick. Got him.

125
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,400
What the f*** did you get a spare orb from?

126
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
And how long have you been carrying it around waiting to pull this little trick?

127
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,400
Once Ronan is dead, we will retrieve the stone.

128
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,400
Use these devices to contain it.

129
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,400
They fail to take the time at any point in this movie to explain why this happens.

130
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
It wouldn't take a lot of effort.

131
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
They could say that R.L. has a magic typewriter.

132
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
I need my typewriter.

133
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
What?

134
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,400
That typewriter is on that Smith Corona. It's not just me.

135
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,400
That typewriter is special.

136
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,400
It has a soul of its own.

137
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
Also, I know this is a universe filled with monsters,

138
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,400
but this is the only giant we've seen between both of the films Pixar's made about the monster world.

139
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,400
Hey, Ted! Good morning!

140
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
You gotta stay away from Katie now.

141
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,400
Okay, so Katie said she talked to this guy Razul and that his story broke her heart,

142
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,400
but she didn't say anything about him being a problem or that he was hurting her or anything.

143
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:07,400
She didn't want the money back that she'd given him or an apology for the black eye he'd given her.

144
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,400
Well, at least that guy shared his thoughts about there possibly being light beyond the wall before he got shot.

145
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,400
Hello again. I'm just going to be popping in every now and then from now on

146
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,400
to explain all of the ones that can't be shown with just a clip from the movie.

147
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,400
For instance, this clip from the movie Insurgent.

148
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,400
Now, the problem here is CinemaSins seem to think that this guy who got shot

149
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,400
is the one who shared his thoughts about there being life beyond the wall.

150
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,400
The problem is the character who actually shared those thoughts looks like this,

151
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
and he is not this guy.

152
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:52,400
In fact, in this shot you can actually see both characters on screen at the same time.

153
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Now, you think they would have picked up on this

154
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,400
because the character that they fought got shot in the head,

155
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,400
carries on being in the movie after that scene, because he survives.

156
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,400
For example, here he is walking away from that location after the scene ends.

157
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,400
The mystery princess.

158
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
There are a lot of unbelievable things I can accept in Cinderella,

159
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
but these people not recognizing her at the ball is definitely one I cannot.

160
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,400
Thank God, Mother.

161
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,400
What is it?

162
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
My stepmother and the girls.

163
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,400
Don't worry, I'll make sure they don't recognize you.

164
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,400
Now off you go.

165
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,400
Disney, in their all-knowing wisdom, realized a cutaway establishing shot close up on a couple random lizards

166
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
would thoroughly add to your enjoyment of the film, and so it was done.

167
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:42,400
Now, I agree, an establishing shot of just two random lizards in a garden is a bit of a weird one,

168
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
and it's worth pointing out.

169
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,400
The problem is, shortly thereafter,

170
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:52,400
the Fairy Godmother turns those lizards into footmen,

171
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,400
and it's at that point, if I were writing the CinemaSins video, I'd say,

172
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,400
Oh, right, so that's what was up with the establishing shot of the lizards,

173
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,400
because they then become important to the movie after the fact,

174
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,400
and I would have went back and deleted the first one,

175
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,400
but apparently CinemaSins don't have time for that.

176
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,400
And actually, a few sins later, CinemaSins think that the footmen are made out of mice,

177
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
and a few sins after that, they think they're made out of frogs,

178
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
so I don't- I don't know.

179
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,400
I don't even know what's happening anymore.

180
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
Does anyone else want to shoot this guy since he's only one person?

181
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,400
I will never understand these monster warrior guys and their techniques.

182
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,400
We need to find the leader. Mangalores won't fight without the leader.

183
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,400
One more shot. Must start killing hostages.

184
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
That's the leader.

185
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,400
It ends tonight.

186
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,400
I know it does. I've seen it.

187
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,400
That's why the rest of me is just going to enjoy the show.

188
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,400
A couple problems here. First off, how is Smith getting visions now?

189
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,400
Now, where would Agent Smith have possibly gained the ability to see into the future?

190
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,400
We all know the character in the Matrix films who can see into the future

191
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:15,400
is the Oracle, and Agent Smith and the Oracle are different characters, obviously.

192
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:23,400
So, where on earth does Agent Smith get the ability to see into the future?

193
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
When did that happen?

194
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,400
I believe it was Snape in the earlier movie who somehow knew Harry was eavesdropping on the teachers outside Dumbledore's office, right?

195
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,400
And said this conversation is no longer private, right?

196
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,400
It may interest you to know this conversation is no longer private.

197
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
Closed? What the ever-loving f**k?

198
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,400
First off, Robert opened the door freely. Second off, it's broad daylight outside.

199
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,400
And third, the hours posted clearly state that you're closed at 9pm, not when Wheel of Fortune is on.

200
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Oh, uh, my mom had a little accident here last night. There was a fire.

201
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,400
I see.

202
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,400
Stealing is bad, kids, so if you take something that doesn't belong to you, leave a few bucks behind.

203
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,400
So here, CinemaSins think that the Turtles steal pizzas off this pizza delivery man.

204
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:16,400
The problem is, he was delivering pizzas to them, but ended up in a fight which the Turtles then rescue him from.

205
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:25,400
Now, the only reason they were looking for him in the first place is because he was delivering their pizzas, and this is actually established earlier on.

206
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
We got another warning for that O'Neill woman.

207
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,400
Are you kidding me? Hell?

208
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,400
This happened during the Civil War?

209
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,400
I was the youngest major in the Texas Cavalry.

210
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:42,400
Okay, f**k, did the first movie not say he was recently turned, or at least new, and that's why he was so compulsively drawn to bite Bella?

211
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Or did I dream that s**t?

212
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,400
If he was turned during the Civil War, there should be no reason he was more tempted to bite Bella than any of the others in the first movie.

213
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,400
Sorry, Jasper's our newest vegetarian. It's a little difficult for him.

214
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,400
It's a pleasure to meet you.

215
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:03,400
Now, vegetarian is kind of a stupid term here, and doesn't really make any sense in context, and I will grant CinemaSins that.

216
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:12,400
But what the vampires mean here is, Jasper is the newest convert to the group of vampires who only prey on animals and don't prey on humans.

217
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,400
That's why he has a hard time being around humans.

218
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,400
It doesn't mean that he was only just recently turned into a vampire.

219
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Didn't they blow up this dam in the last movie?

220
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:27,400
I guess it's a different dam, but since I have no idea where the other dam was or why it was important, I reserve the right to claim the filmmakers didn't either.

221
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:39,400
So, CinemaSins gives the final Hunger Games movie a sin for having a dam in it, which is one of the weirder sins I think they've ever done.

222
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,400
And it's a good example of a time in which CinemaSins just needs to pad out the runtime of a video.

223
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:52,400
So, basically anything that the movie shows them, they give a sin to.

224
00:15:53,400 --> 00:16:00,400
They try and get a laugh here because they pretend not to remember if this dam is the same dam that got destroyed in the last movie.

225
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:10,400
The problem is, in a previous sin in that video, they correctly identified the location of the dam, that they're now pretending not to know where it is.

226
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
I understand why.

227
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,400
Why I did it.

228
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,400
How on earth was she able to contact them? She must have sent a carrier pigeon in a deleted scene.

229
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,400
So fuck me, I guess, for saying that I'd never watched The Scorch Trials.

230
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,400
So how does this character contact the antagonist?

231
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,400
Well, this is a really subtle one, actually.

232
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:38,400
So earlier in the film, the main characters meet this guy, who has a radio that he's using to communicate with the antagonists.

233
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,400
There's a short fight scene, and that guy gets shot, and he drops the radio.

234
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:49,400
And we see, just for a split second, that character looking at the radio on the floor.

235
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:54,400
And this radio is how she was able to contact the antagonists later on in the film.

236
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,400
Now that's a very subtle one, and I don't blame anyone at all for missing it.

237
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:05,400
Am I still gonna do the stamp and the horn sound effect for missing such a minor moment?

238
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
I'll go on, then.

239
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,400
Even if you're clearly stupid, like Bumper and his team is, I don't see how you think that What's Love Got To Do With It has anything to do with John Mayer.

240
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,400
But let's rewind for a second.

241
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:27,400
What does A Thousand Miles have to do with John Mayer, or that Taylor Swift song that was supposed to be about Jake Gyllenhaal?

242
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,400
This is actually a stupid-ass category when it comes down to it.

243
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:37,400
Thanks a lot, CinemaSins, for making me watch Pitch Perfect 2. I will never forgive you.

244
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:47,400
But in that scene, the category is I Dated John Mayer, and the three songs are What's Love Got To Do With It by Tina Turner.

245
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:53,400
Now that gets the group who sing it eliminated because that doesn't have anything at all to do with John Mayer.

246
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:07,400
The other two songs, though, A Thousand Miles is sung by Vanessa Carlton, and We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together or whatever that's called, is sung by Taylor Swift.

247
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:12,400
And now Vanessa Carlton and Taylor Swift both dated John Mayer.

248
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:19,400
The category is songs by people who dated John Mayer, not just something to do with John Mayer.

249
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,400
Well, obviously, she wanted to have the party before the move.

250
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,400
You will, because when Bob walked out a bit ago, it shut just fine.

251
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
Are we getting close?

252
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400
Why is Sadness pretending to know which way to go?

253
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,400
Just a little aside about the movie inside out here.

254
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:39,400
CinemaSins, a couple of times, give the movie a sin for having four negative emotions and one positive one.

255
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,400
And this isn't something that can really be contradicted exactly, because it's a matter of opinion,

256
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:52,400
but the message of Inside Out was that the other four emotions, particularly Sadness, aren't negative emotions,

257
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,400
and Joy isn't necessarily a good emotion or a positive one.

258
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:05,400
The, you know, the conclusion of the film is about how useful Sadness can be.

259
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,400
It makes other people empathize with the main character.

260
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,400
It's the standard, you can't really have happiness without Sadness story.

261
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:22,400
And it's aimed at little kids, and it's kind of stressing me out a little that CinemaSins missed it.

262
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Um...

263
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
I need to calm down.

264
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:41,400
So, CinemaSins think that Elektra was paid for this assassination on site.

265
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,400
Now, here is the assassination.

266
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,400
You can see the room she's in, you can see the clothes that she's wearing.

267
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,400
Then there's a transition to a completely different location,

268
00:20:52,400 --> 00:21:01,400
and there's a long conversation between a bunch of Japanese men that I didn't really pay attention to.

269
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,400
But then, after that, there's another transition with another establishing shot of a different building.

270
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:13,400
And this is the building that Elektra gets paid in, which I'm just gonna presume is her house.

271
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,400
And, of course, she's wearing a completely different outfit.

272
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,400
So, I have no idea what happened here.

273
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,400
I think, um, CinemaSins sort of nodded off at the wheel there,

274
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,400
and missed that entire scene with all of the Japanese men.

275
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,400
Oh man, Stargate. Where to even start with this one?

276
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,400
CinemaSins get the basic premise of the movie wrong?

277
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:42,400
Do you remember that episode of The Simpsons where Sideshow Bob just kept on stepping on rakes over and over?

278
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
They do the equivalent of that.

279
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,400
So, in Stargate, an alien comes to Earth thousands of years ago,

280
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,400
takes a bunch of humans prisoner, takes them through the Stargate.

281
00:21:53,400 --> 00:22:00,400
So, when modern day humans go through, they find humans on the planet that they go to.

282
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:06,400
They're not aliens. They are humans taken from Earth, from ancient Egypt.

283
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,400
And that's why they look human and all their architecture is ancient Egyptian.

284
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,400
CinemaSins get this completely backwards and think that aliens came here through the Stargate,

285
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:21,400
just happened to look human, and then built the pyramids and such on Earth.

286
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,400
And then they just faceplant over and over again, not understanding this.

287
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
It really worked out that these aliens look exactly like humans,

288
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,400
and the ruler guy's daughter is hot, or this would have been really awkward.

289
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
This is a replica of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

290
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,400
Isn't the whole point that the Great Pyramid of Giza is a replica of this?

291
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,400
You see, if you don't turn it on from here, we're screwed.

292
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,400
But why though? Does the Stargate only work in the direction where it's activated?

293
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:53,400
CinemaSins also seem to think that not only did the Stargate take the characters to another planet,

294
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:59,400
it also took them to another dimension, and this is, of course, not true.

295
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:06,400
Also, the reason that Jackson thinks that he can control the animal is because it's wearing a harness.

296
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,400
You see, which means it's probably domesticated.

297
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,400
And this is subtly pointed out in the following dialogue exchange.

298
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,400
I wouldn't feed that thing. It's got a harness!

299
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:29,400
Finally then, let's talk about Zootopia, and in particular, the first sin in the video.

300
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,400
50 goddamn seconds of Disney-related logo s***.

301
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Now this is something CinemaSins always do.

302
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,400
They give a movie a sin for having logos at the start of it.

303
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:47,400
And they go, 45 seconds of logos, 50 seconds of logos, blah blah blah.

304
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,400
Like, that's the worst thing in the world.

305
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,400
Now, I actually don't mind these logos at the start of movies.

306
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:06,400
Some studios, particularly animation studios, you know, they can do something a little unique with each one that sets the mood.

307
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:13,400
Usually they might have music behind the logos also setting the mood.

308
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:20,400
Now, the reason I picked Zootopia to talk about here is because of a sin later on in the video.

309
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,400
Let's take a look at that.

310
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
They're all sloths?

311
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,400
Hilarious DMV is slow joke from Pixar. It's only about 12 years too late to be timely, but whatever. Good slowest slow joke, y'all.

312
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:36,400
Now the problem here is, Zootopia isn't a Pixar movie.

313
