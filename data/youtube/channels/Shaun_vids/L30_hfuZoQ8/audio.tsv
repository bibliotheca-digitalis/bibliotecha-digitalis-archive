0	5000	Hello, everyone. Today, we're going to be talking about the death penalty, or capital punishment.
5000	6600	And we all know what that is, right?
6600	10900	When someone is killed by the state as punishment for a criminal act.
10900	13500	And I want to talk about this for a few reasons.
13500	18300	Firstly, while most countries around the world have either abolished capital punishment outright,
18300	22000	or only use it in very specific and rare circumstances,
22000	26400	much of the world's population still lives in countries that retain the death penalty.
26400	30500	Also, in countries that have abolished the death penalty, it can remain popular,
30500	33000	and its reintroduction is often argued for.
33000	39400	A 2017 YouGov survey found that more than half of Brexit Leave voters in the UK, for instance,
39400	42100	think that the death penalty should be brought back.
42100	46800	Another reason I want to talk about the death penalty today is because I've noticed that frequently,
46800	52100	when discussing the pros and cons of the death penalty, people tend to have the wrong argument.
52100	56700	And for an example of this, we're going to take a look at a typical pro-death penalty argument,
56700	61100	such as the one offered by Dennis Prager of PragerU in his video,
61100	65900	Is the Death Penalty Ever Moral, which I will link below in the video description.
65900	72300	In this video, Dennis Prager argues that criminals who do sufficiently horrible things should be put to death.
72300	77900	And he uses as an example the 2007 Cheshire, Connecticut home invasion murders,
77900	84400	during which two criminals broke into a family's house and murdered three people in a particularly brutal manner.
84400	89000	Dennis Prager's argument in favor of executing these men is an emotional argument,
89000	95100	and he appeals directly to the feelings of his audience, talking about things like a sense of justice,
95100	98400	the pain inflicted on the loved ones of those murdered,
98400	105200	and asks whether torturers, rapists, murderers, and evil men like them deserve to keep their lives.
105200	111000	And this sort of appeal to emotion is the main thrust of many pro-death penalty arguments.
111000	117200	Now, whether someone can forfeit the right to life with a sufficiently horrible action or series of actions
117200	124600	is a moral question, it's a philosophical question, and it's not a question that I'm going to be answering today.
124600	129300	If you believe that people who commit terrible crimes, such as Dennis Prager describes,
129300	134700	deserve in turn to lose their lives, I am not going to argue with you here.
134700	138700	In fact, we can proceed as if that is definitely true, if you like,
138700	145700	because regardless of how you feel about that question, it doesn't actually have anything to do with what we'll be talking about today,
145700	151200	which is whether the death penalty, as a practical process, should actually be carried out.
151200	159500	Is it possible for someone to lose the right to life is a different question to should society have the death penalty.
159500	163500	And I'm going to be arguing that no matter how you feel about the former question,
163500	166600	the answer to the latter question is no.
166600	173200	And if you disagree with that right now, all I ask is that you stick around for the rest of the video and hear me out.
173200	179200	Now, before we start, it is worth pointing out that many anti-death penalty arguments also appeal to emotion,
179200	182700	and I'm going to be trying to avoid those arguments going forward.
182700	187400	Reading or watching anti-death penalty arguments, you will often hear about, for example,
187400	193300	how the difficulty of securing the chemicals for lethal injections means that inferior chemicals can be used,
193300	197900	which can lead to drawn-out and painful or botched executions and so on.
197900	200800	Now, regardless of how any individual feels about that,
200800	206600	I don't see it being all that much of a convincing argument to someone who is currently in favor of the death penalty.
206600	210500	Since if you think a criminal did something so bad that they should be killed,
210500	214900	you probably don't care too much if they get hurt on the way out, right?
214900	221300	So as much as possible today, I'm going to be trying to avoid the emotional arguments and stick to the facts.
221300	225300	And to begin with here, let's stay with Dennis Prager's video for a while.
225300	231300	He opens his video by asserting that he just doesn't understand people who oppose the death penalty.
231300	237400	The gulf is unbridgeable, he says, between those of us who believe that some murderers should be put to death,
237400	240900	and those who believe that no murderer should ever be put to death.
240900	245500	Later, at the end of the video, he calls back to this opening paragraph, stating,
245500	251300	But if you really do believe these people deserve to keep their lives, well, as I said at the outset,
251300	253100	I don't understand you.
253100	258500	Now, these two quotes illustrate perfectly the disconnect I talked about a minute ago.
258500	263100	In the opening, Dennis Prager is talking about the process of people being put to death,
263100	269500	but at the end, he's talking about the philosophical question of whether those people deserve to keep their lives.
269500	273300	Two different questions, which he's treating as if they're the same.
273300	279100	In doing this, what Dennis Prager is missing is the possibility that someone could believe that criminals
279100	283900	who do the sorts of evil things he describes do deserve to lose their lives,
283900	288700	but that the death penalty is, separately to that, still a bad idea.
289300	294700	Oh! Well, the first thing is, there's crimes that the proper penalty is obviously death.
295100	298900	Obviously. Like, and I've read a lot about serial killers, for example.
298900	301300	I've read a lot of brutal material, you know.
301300	306100	I was very interested in criminology and antisocial behaviour, as well as political pathology.
306100	311100	It's like, there are guys like, I think it was John Wayne Gacy, who, yeah, you don't want to know about him.
311700	314500	I think he begged the judge for the death penalty.
314500	317500	He knew himself as like, there was no coming back from where he went.
317500	318100	Hmm.
318100	320700	So, but that's not the issue for me.
320700	324900	The issue is, do you give the state that much power?
324900	328100	And I would say, practically, no.
328100	330300	I think this is a very callous way of looking.
330300	333500	I think, in the United States, it costs $20 million to put someone to death.
333500	334900	It's like, why?
334900	338500	Well, because the state shouldn't just be able to do that easily.
338500	341300	And they make mistakes. Like, a lot of mistakes.
341900	345300	And so, maybe you just never want the state to have that much power.
345300	347100	And I think that's a reasonable argument.
347100	348100	Yeah, that's where...
348100	348900	I'm not comfortable with that.
348900	352100	That's where I'm at with it. I just don't want to give the state that power.
352100	358500	That was Jordan Peterson there, expressing to Dave Rubin his opinion that people can deserve to be killed,
358700	362500	but that he just doesn't trust the state to wield that much power.
362500	368100	And this is a common anti-death penalty argument made by anti-big government folks.
368100	373900	I picked a clip of Jordan Peterson there because he has been the narrator of multiple PragerU videos.
373900	378300	So if Dennis Prager would like to understand an anti-death penalty argument,
378300	381100	I suppose he could just ask Jordan Peterson.
381100	385700	Peterson's argument also reveals a contradiction in Prager's position,
385700	389100	and it's to do with the size and role of the government.
389100	392900	We all know how PragerU feels about the government, right?
392900	397500	And by the way, when does the government do a good job at fixing anything?
397500	400900	The bigger the government, the smaller the citizen.
400900	403300	Why is the government so bad at healthcare?
403300	405700	The government is killing small businesses.
405700	410300	Killing them with excessive taxes, over-regulation, and complicated compliance.
410300	415500	The worst environmental offenders have been big, repressive, socialist governments.
415700	420300	People in government will sell government influence for personal and political gain.
420300	423300	It's mired in bureaucracy, and it's fraught with waste.
423300	427300	The more a government tightens its grip, the less an economy grows.
427300	429300	So what's the solution?
429300	431300	Less government, not more.
431300	437700	Yes, the government is big, bloated, slow, corrupt, mired in red tape and regulations.
437700	442300	It's not fit to run the DMV, let alone a healthcare system.
442300	448500	And this is the government that Dennis Prager trusts to competently decide who deserves to live and die?
449100	450300	Why?
450300	455300	The same state bureaucracy that his other videos describe as inefficient and corrupt
455300	459700	is suddenly perfectly competent when it comes to sentencing the death penalty.
459700	466100	Is having the power to end the lives of its citizens not the ultimate example of big government?
466100	468100	Not to wonder off-topic too much here,
468100	473500	but this is an example of how most of the time, when people complain about the size of the government,
473500	478700	their arguments usually have very little to do with the actual size of the government.
478700	483100	In a less silly world, if someone claimed to be against big government,
483100	487700	we might assume that they support things like decreasing military spending,
487700	493300	ending wars, demilitarizing the police, reducing the number of people in prison,
493300	497100	and relevant for us here, being against the death penalty.
497100	500300	If you don't trust the government and want it to be smaller,
500300	503900	you probably shouldn't also want it to have an enormous army,
503900	508500	an armed police force, and power of life and death over its citizens.
508500	513300	Too often, though, people who complain about big government love all that stuff,
513300	520100	and what they actually mean when they say big government is solely government healthcare and welfare programs.
520100	521900	Anyway, to get back on track,
521900	525300	Dennis Prager has decided to break with PragerU tradition
525300	531900	and now totally trusts the government to judge and implement the death penalty fairly and accurately.
531900	537700	He says the number of innocent people who might be wrongly executed is infinitesimally small
537700	541700	thanks to DNA testing and other advanced forensic tools,
541700	545700	which make executing an innocent person virtually impossible.
545700	548700	The chance of executing an innocent person is, of course,
548700	553500	one of the most common and strongest arguments against the death penalty.
553500	558100	Because, obviously, if it comes to light that someone was wrongfully imprisoned,
558100	559900	they can be let out of prison,
559900	563300	but if it comes to light that someone was wrongfully executed,
563300	565300	that's it. They're dead.
565300	569700	Dennis Prager steps around this argument by saying our modern forensic tools
569700	573900	make it virtually impossible to execute an innocent person,
573900	575900	but he's missing something there.
575900	578500	He's making a rather big assumption.
578500	581900	Now, before we get into exactly what he is missing here,
581900	585500	let's first imagine an airtight murder case.
585500	588700	Let's say a husband and wife are walking down the street
588700	591700	when they're approached by a mugger armed with a gun.
591700	596100	And in the process of robbing the couple, he shoots and kills the wife.
596100	601100	The police are called, and based upon the description of the criminal given to the police by the husband,
601100	604300	they pick up a suspect near the scene of the crime.
604300	608500	When they bring the suspect to the husband, he says yes, that's him.
608500	611100	He's the person who shot my wife.
611100	614700	The police then arrest the suspect, and when they later question him,
614700	618300	he admits to the crime and signs a written confession saying,
618300	621700	yes, I did it. I'm the person who shot that woman.
622300	624300	So, case closed, right?
624300	627100	We have a positive identification of the murderer
627100	629900	from a witness who was a foot away when the crime was committed,
629900	634500	and a signed written confession from the murderer saying that they did it.
634500	637100	Few cases get more clear-cut than that.
637100	639500	So this case was an actual case.
639500	642300	The crime happened in May of the year 2000.
642300	646500	Two tourists from Georgia, that's the state, not the country,
646500	649700	were staying at a Ramada Inn in Jacksonville, Florida.
649700	652700	Outside of their hotel, they were approached by a criminal
652700	657300	who, in the process of mugging them, shot and killed Mary Ann Stevens.
657300	660900	Her husband, James Stevens, identified Brenton Butler,
660900	663700	who was picked up nearby by the police as the killer,
663700	666900	and Butler confessed to the murder during questioning.
666900	669700	However, as I imagine many of you already suspect,
669700	672500	there is more to this case than meets the eye.
672500	675500	Firstly, the husband of the victim was mistaken
675500	677500	in his identification of the criminal.
677500	679300	He just got the wrong guy.
679300	680700	And this is a thing that happens.
680700	682500	Witnesses make mistakes,
682500	686900	particularly witnesses who were just involved in a very traumatic experience.
686900	691300	But why, you might wonder, did the wrong guy confess to the crime?
691300	693900	Well, during the trial, Brenton Butler alleged
693900	697100	that the police physically abused him into confessing.
697100	701700	They allegedly, again, my lawyers reminding me to say,
701700	704700	physically intimidated him and hit him several times
704700	706700	until he confessed to the crime.
706700	709700	This is all the subject of a very interesting documentary
709700	711700	called Murder on a Sunday Morning,
711700	715300	which I would highly recommend if you want to know more about this case.
715300	717500	The film follows Butler's defense team,
717500	721100	two public defenders called Patrick McGinnis and Ann Finnell,
721100	723900	as they put together the case for Butler's innocence.
723900	726700	And they rarely tear the police apart in the courtroom
726700	730100	and expose their awful and incompetent investigation,
730100	732100	which is very satisfying to watch.
732100	735700	The police, for example, didn't even search Brenton Butler's house
735700	738100	looking for the items he supposedly stole
738100	741500	or interview his family members with regards to his whereabouts
741500	743500	at the time of the crime.
743500	746100	You knew you didn't have a gun.
746100	748300	You knew you didn't have a purse.
748300	750300	You knew you didn't have any money.
750300	753300	You knew you didn't have a fisherman's hat, right?
753300	754500	That's all correct.
754500	756500	Okay.
756500	758500	Did you ask Brent,
758500	760500	can I go search your house, your room?
760500	762300	No, sir, I did not.
762300	764300	Did you get a search warrant for his house?
764300	766300	No, sir, I did not.
766300	768300	You wanted to find a gun and a purse
768300	770300	and bloody clothes and everything else, right?
770300	772300	Yes, sir, it would have been nice.
772300	775300	So why not get a search warrant?
775300	777300	Well, we just didn't get a search warrant.
777300	779300	And it's not that hard to imagine
779300	782300	what allegedly happened here.
782300	785300	A tourist was shot and killed outside a hotel.
785300	789300	That is not a great headline for attracting more tourists to your town.
789300	791300	So there's a lot of pressure on the police
791300	794300	to solve that particular crime very quickly.
794300	797300	And here you have an eyewitness who has already identified someone
797300	800300	in your custody who they say did the crime.
800300	802300	And that someone is a teenager
802300	805300	who you just need to get to sign a piece of paper
805300	807300	to put this case away quickly.
807300	810300	So you make him sign the paper.
810300	812300	Allegedly.
812300	814300	And you don't go around investigating other things
814300	817300	that you know will make the case against him weaker.
817300	819300	So you don't search his house for the stolen items
819300	821300	that you know aren't there.
821300	823300	You don't interview potential alibis
823300	825300	who could get him off the hook.
825300	827300	You just pin everything on the witness ID
827300	829300	and the confession and hope that that's enough
829300	831300	to get the case across the line.
831300	834300	So you might ask why I'm talking about this particular case
834300	836300	in a video about the death penalty.
836300	839300	Butler was too young to be given the death penalty anyway,
839300	841300	even if he was found guilty,
841300	843300	so that wouldn't apply here.
843300	845300	And even if he was found guilty,
845300	847300	the real killer was later caught
847300	849300	when someone tipped the police off to who it was.
849300	852300	So Butler probably would have been let out anyway,
852300	854300	even if he was wrongly convicted.
854300	856300	But my point here is to show a case
856300	858300	in which the criminal justice system, or part of it,
858300	860300	in this case the police force,
860300	863300	could have a motivation to deliberately allow
863300	865300	an innocent person to be convicted
865300	867300	of a crime they did not commit.
867300	869300	This is what Dennis Prager misses
869300	871300	when discussing investigative techniques
871300	872300	and forensic tools.
872300	874300	Because yes, in many cases
874300	876300	we do have very powerful forensic tools.
876300	878300	But you also have to be able to trust
878300	880300	the people with those tools
880300	882300	not to lie.
882300	886300	And also to actually use the tools, I suppose.
886300	889300	What Prager leaves out is the human element.
889300	891300	The police will sometimes,
891300	893300	for example, plant evidence.
893300	895300	There was a case just recently in New York
895300	897300	where an officer was caught on camera
897300	899300	appearing to plant drugs in a car.
899300	901300	And this is similar to a case from last year
901300	903300	when a Florida police officer was arrested
903300	905300	after an investigation showed he repeatedly
905300	908300	planted meth on people during traffic stops.
908300	911300	Police will sometimes take bribes from criminals.
911300	913300	They will lie in court,
913300	915300	cover up for the crimes of other officers,
915300	918300	beat confessions out of innocent people, and so on.
918300	920300	Even if all cops are bastards
920300	922300	is a little too absolutist for you,
922300	924300	you have to admit that sometimes
924300	926300	some cops are bastards,
926300	929300	and some judges are bastards,
929300	931300	and some lawyers,
931300	933300	a lot of lawyers, are bastards.
933300	937300	Or incompetent, or lazy, or corrupt,
937300	939300	or just apathetic.
939300	941300	The accuracy of a particular
941300	943300	investigative technique or forensic method
943300	945300	is only one part of the calculation
945300	947300	we have to do when determining odds
947300	949300	of someone being innocent.
949300	951300	We also have to trust the justice system
951300	953300	not to lie, or cheat,
953300	955300	or just have made a mistake.
955300	958300	You can say DNA analysis of a piece of evidence
958300	960300	is almost perfectly accurate,
960300	962300	but it cannot tell you whether or not
962300	964300	that piece of evidence was planted
964300	965300	at the scene of a crime.
965300	967300	Now I'm not saying that's necessarily
967300	969300	going to be a very common occurrence,
969300	972300	don't get me wrong, but it is a possibility.
972300	974300	We have an imperfect justice system
974300	976300	run by imperfect people.
976300	980300	No one type of evidence is ever going to be flawless.
980300	982300	Even video evidence.
982300	984300	Dennis Prager in his video says
984300	986300	opponents of capital punishment
986300	988300	oppose the death penalty even when
988300	991300	there is absolute proof of the murderer's guilt.
991300	993300	If there were a video of a man
993300	994300	burning a family alive,
994300	996300	opponents of capital punishment
996300	998300	would still oppose taking that man's life.
998300	1000300	Now the implication there is that
1000300	1002300	a video would be absolute proof of guilt.
1002300	1004300	But is it really?
1004300	1006300	This is a statement that's going to be
1006300	1008300	less and less true over time,
1008300	1010300	and that's simply because technological
1010300	1012300	advances mean that video is getting
1012300	1014300	easier and easier to fake.
1014300	1016300	It is getting harder to spot videos
1016300	1018300	that are authentic and videos
1018300	1020300	that were created in a computer.
1020300	1022300	Many of you will remember this video
1022300	1025300	from a few years ago of a fake Barack Obama
1025300	1027300	that was created in a computer
1027300	1029300	using an AI video tool.
1029300	1032300	Now the more observant folks in the audience
1032300	1035300	might still be able to tell this is fake,
1035300	1038300	you can see something seems a little off about it, right?
1038300	1043300	However, it is already eerily similar to the real thing, is it not?
1043300	1046300	And before long, it's going to be very difficult indeed
1046300	1048300	to tell the difference between authentic videos
1048300	1051300	and fake videos like this one.
1051300	1053300	And if you were led by my prompting there
1053300	1056300	to believe that this is a fake video of Barack Obama,
1056300	1058300	then we are already at that moment
1058300	1061300	because this is not a fake video of Barack Obama.
1061300	1063300	This is a real video of Barack Obama.
1063300	1067300	I just put a real video under the headline describing the fake one.
1067300	1070300	Anyway, me being a smart-ass aside,
1070300	1072300	while faked videos aren't a huge problem
1072300	1074300	for the legal system right now,
1074300	1078300	as the technology gets both more advanced and easier to use,
1078300	1081300	it very well could be a problem in the future.
1081300	1084300	And even with a non-fake video,
1084300	1087300	we can still imagine perfectly possible scenarios
1087300	1089300	in which executing a man based on video evidence
1089300	1093300	of him committing a crime would be a bad idea.
1093300	1096300	What if the man had off-screen accomplices in his crime?
1096300	1100300	If you kill him, you've got less of a chance of finding them, right?
1100300	1103300	What if the person doing the crime was someone who was coerced
1103300	1106300	or forced into it by some other person?
1106300	1108300	What if someone threatened to murder his family
1108300	1111300	unless he did the horrible thing on their behalf?
1111300	1114300	Again, as with a bribed judge or planted evidence,
1114300	1117300	I'm not saying that these things would be happening every day,
1117300	1119300	just that it is a possibility.
1119300	1123300	And no matter how unlikely, if you execute enough people,
1123300	1125300	you will eventually kill an innocent person.
1125300	1128300	So the pro-death penalty argument has to be
1128300	1133300	that killing the occasional innocent person is an acceptable risk,
1133300	1135300	because that risk is outweighed by the positives
1135300	1138300	that come from having the death penalty.
1138300	1142300	So, what are the positives to having the death penalty?
1142300	1145300	One you will often see proposed is cost.
1145300	1149300	Why should the taxpayer pay to feed and clothe some horrible murderer
1149300	1152300	who might live for another however many decades, right?
1152300	1156300	It would be better and cheaper to just kill them outright.
1156300	1159300	Well, in practice, this isn't actually true.
1159300	1161300	In the United States, for instance,
1161300	1165300	it is vastly more expensive to execute people than to imprison them for life.
1165300	1170300	Executing someone is a very complicated and slow legal process.
1170300	1174300	Some inmates spend more than 20 years on death row before being executed.
1174300	1178300	It's so slow because there are various stages of review and appeal
1178300	1181300	before the death penalty can actually be carried out.
1181300	1184300	Now, the obvious counterargument to this is to say,
1184300	1187300	well, what if we just sped that process up a little?
1187300	1191300	If we just executed people right after they were found guilty,
1191300	1193300	that massive expense would not exist, right?
1193300	1196300	And execution would be the cheaper option.
1196300	1199300	And the counterargument to this counterargument is that
1199300	1203300	the slow appeal and review process exists for a very good reason.
1203300	1206300	If you thought my proposed scenarios a minute ago
1206300	1209300	as to how an innocent person could end up being executed
1209300	1212300	sounded like ridiculous million-to-one shots,
1212300	1216300	then what you need is a real-life example.
1216300	1220300	So let's talk about the rather infamous case of Timothy Evans,
1220300	1223300	something I imagine some of you will know about already.
1223300	1228300	So, Timothy Evans was a Welshman who lived in London in 1949
1228300	1230300	with his wife and child.
1230300	1233300	And in November of 1949, he went to the police
1233300	1237300	and informed them that his wife, Beryl Evans, had died.
1237300	1240300	And the story he told police was that his wife was pregnant,
1240300	1244300	but since the couple thought they could not support another child,
1244300	1247300	they had taken up the proposal of their downstairs neighbor,
1247300	1251300	John Christie, who had offered to perform an abortion.
1251300	1253300	Christie apparently botched the abortion
1253300	1255300	and accidentally killed Beryl Evans.
1255300	1258300	Christie then persuaded Timothy Evans
1258300	1260300	to go and stay with relatives in Wales
1260300	1262300	while he disposed of Beryl Evans' body
1262300	1266300	and made arrangements for a couple to look after their daughter.
1266300	1268300	So, Timothy Evans went to Wales,
1268300	1271300	only to a few weeks later decide to go to the police
1271300	1274300	and tell them what had happened.
1274300	1277300	Only, when he first told the story to the police,
1277300	1279300	he left Christie out of it,
1279300	1282300	saying that he himself had been the one to dispose of his wife's body
1282300	1286300	and the one who arranged for his daughter to be looked after.
1286300	1289300	In response to this account, the police searched the place
1289300	1291300	where Evans said he had disposed of the body,
1291300	1294300	which was in a sewer drain, only to find there was no body there
1294300	1296300	and that lifting the drain cover
1296300	1299300	would have been physically impossible for a single man.
1299300	1302300	So Evans, when re-questioned, changed his story
1302300	1304300	and this time included Christie,
1304300	1307300	stating that he had previously been trying to protect Christie
1307300	1309300	by not mentioning him.
1309300	1312300	So Evans told the police that Christie was the one who hid the body
1312300	1315300	and arranged for his daughter to be looked after.
1315300	1317300	In response to this new account,
1317300	1320300	police searched the building where both Evans and Christie lived
1320300	1323300	and discovered in the wash house in the back garden
1323300	1325300	the bodies of not just Beryl Evans,
1325300	1328300	but also her daughter with Timothy Evans.
1328300	1330300	Both had been strangled to death.
1330300	1333300	When he was informed that his wife and daughter had been strangled,
1333300	1337300	Timothy Evans confessed to the crime.
1337300	1339300	Or... did he?
1339300	1342300	His questioning by the police produced a confession,
1342300	1345300	though he later stated in court that this confession was made
1345300	1348300	because he feared being subjected to violence by the police.
1348300	1351300	So, from the perspective of the police here,
1351300	1353300	a man came in and said his wife was dead
1353300	1357300	and then he told them multiple contradictory accounts of how it happened.
1357300	1360300	Most of the time, he is going to be the killer.
1360300	1363300	However, Timothy Evans was not the killer.
1363300	1366300	His wife and daughter were killed by John Christie.
1366300	1369300	There was no botched abortion or arranging for the daughter
1369300	1371300	to be sent elsewhere to be looked after.
1371300	1375300	John Christie murdered them both because he was a serial killer.
1375300	1379300	The things he told Timothy Evans about what had happened were lies.
1379300	1385300	However, John Christie was also a former War Reserve police officer.
1385300	1390300	This, coupled with the police clearly believing that Timothy Evans was obviously the killer,
1390300	1394300	led them to carry out an incredibly lazy investigation.
1394300	1396300	They know it's Timothy Evans,
1396300	1400300	so there's no need to investigate the crime scene all that well,
1400300	1405300	and we can take John Christie at his word since he used to be a copper just like us.
1405300	1408300	And if Timothy Evans won't confess to the crime,
1408300	1412300	we can just persuade him to confess to the crime,
1412300	1414300	if you know what I mean.
1414300	1415300	Wink.
1415300	1420300	This led the police to missing that John Christie had bodies of his prior victims
1420300	1424300	buried in shallow graves in his back garden,
1424300	1428300	so shallow that a dog was able to dig up one of the skulls,
1428300	1432300	and a thigh bone was later apparently found propping up his fence.
1432300	1436300	He also had multiple criminal convictions for theft and assault,
1436300	1439300	including attacking a woman with a cricket bat,
1439300	1442300	which was seemingly overlooked by the police.
1442300	1445300	Because of the police's rubbish investigation
1445300	1448300	and Timothy Evans' temporary confession to the crime,
1448300	1450300	however that came about,
1450300	1454300	Evans was put on trial for murder on the 11th of January 1950,
1454300	1456300	and was found guilty.
1456300	1460300	Executed on the 9th of March, less than three months later.
1460300	1463300	So the state executed an innocent man.
1463300	1467300	And this sounds like a ridiculous million-to-one shot, right?
1467300	1469300	What if it wasn't the husband,
1469300	1473300	and the downstairs neighbor is actually a scheming serial killer?
1473300	1478300	It sounds like paranoid fiction, and it is incredibly unlikely.
1478300	1480300	But things like this do happen,
1480300	1484300	and there are multiple things we should take into account regarding this case.
1484300	1490300	Firstly, it is a very good example of why it is an incredibly bad idea to execute people quickly.
1490300	1496300	All those slow reviews and appeals exist to catch exactly these sorts of mistakes.
1496300	1500300	Christie was caught three years later in 1953, for instance,
1500300	1504300	at which point, if Timothy Evans had not already been executed,
1504300	1506300	he could have been let out of prison.
1506300	1510300	So yes, the justice system could kill people faster,
1510300	1513300	but if you do that, you're going to make more mistakes.
1513300	1516300	So you have to be okay with killing more innocent people,
1516300	1519300	in order to make the process cheaper, I guess.
1519300	1524300	So you're basically killing innocent people for money at that point,
1524300	1528300	which sounds like the opposite of something the justice system should be doing.
1528300	1533300	Next up, killing an innocent person is only half the crime here.
1533300	1535300	Because the justice system got the wrong guy,
1535300	1537300	the actual killer was still out there,
1537300	1541300	and John Christie killed four more people before he was caught.
1542300	1544300	Timothy Evans could have been a witness
1544300	1548300	that helped to bring Christie to justice years earlier than he was.
1548300	1553300	Instead, he was wrongfully executed, and Christie went on to kill again.
1553300	1556300	So this is my answer to the cost of the death penalty.
1556300	1559300	You can do it quick, cheap, and bad,
1559300	1562300	or you can do it slow and expensive.
1562300	1567300	The question is how many innocent people you're willing to risk accidentally killing.
1567300	1570300	According to the Death Penalty Information Center,
1570300	1572300	in the United States, for instance,
1572300	1575300	more than 160 people on death row
1575300	1579300	were later found to be wrongfully convicted and were exonerated.
1579300	1581300	And they're just the ones who have been found.
1581300	1584300	Remember, the actual number of wrongfully convicted people
1584300	1586300	is likely much higher than that.
1586300	1589300	And let's look at some of the reasons for those exonerations.
1589300	1592300	False or misleading forensic evidence,
1592300	1596300	official misconduct, perjury or false accusation,
1596300	1600300	inadequate legal defense, mistaken witness identification,
1600300	1606300	these supposedly very unlikely scenarios happen much more often than we might like to admit.
1606300	1612300	Anyway, the next pro-death penalty argument I want to take a look at is deterrence.
1612300	1615300	The death penalty is worth its various downsides.
1615300	1617300	It's argued because it deters crime.
1617300	1622300	Now, the big problem with this argument is that there isn't any evidence for it.
1622300	1627300	For instance, comparing between states within the US that have the death penalty and those that don't,
1627300	1633300	there is no positive correlation between having the death penalty and a lowered rate of crime.
1633300	1636300	And for countries that have abolished the death penalty,
1636300	1640300	there is no evidence that doing so caused the crime rate to rise.
1640300	1644300	So that's it for this argument, right? There's no evidence.
1644300	1647300	However, leaving things there would be a bit of a mistake.
1647300	1653300	There is a relatively good death penalty argument to be made here with regard to deterrence.
1653300	1655300	And I compiled this from various sources,
1655300	1661300	but primarily from the pro-death penalty arguments contained within the book debating the death penalty.
1661300	1665300	So let's do the relatively good death penalty argument.
1665300	1668300	And if I appeared on camera during these videos,
1668300	1674300	this is the point where I'd burst through the door wearing a hat and a fake mustache and proceed to argue with myself in character.
1675300	1679300	But since I'm not much of an actor, we'll all just have to use our imaginations.
1679300	1681300	So, the argument goes like this.
1681300	1685300	The death penalty deters crime, to which the response is,
1685300	1688300	no it doesn't, there's no evidence for that.
1688300	1696300	But, we respond, the death penalty would deter crime, it would, had it not been so weakened.
1696300	1700300	There's no evidence of deterrence under our current system, sure,
1700300	1705300	but under our current system, only very small amounts of crimes are eligible for the death penalty,
1705300	1710300	only a very small number of those cases actually result in a death penalty sentence,
1710300	1712300	many of those are later overturned,
1712300	1716300	and the legal process between arrest and execution takes years.
1716300	1719300	Of course, that system isn't deterring anyone,
1719300	1727300	because the odds of getting executed are too low, it happens too slowly, it's too abstract to be a good deterrent.
1727300	1735300	If we want the death penalty to discourage anyone, it needs to be used more often, faster, and for a wider variety of crimes.
1735300	1739300	For instance, we'll execute someone for killing one other person in a robbery,
1739300	1742300	but not a banker who defrauds thousands of people,
1742300	1746300	or a politician who starts a war that kills hundreds of thousands.
1746300	1751300	Now, the obvious response to increased use of the death penalty, as we talked about just previously,
1751300	1754300	is that you're gonna execute more innocent people,
1754300	1756300	and to that, we say,
1756300	1759300	the state accidentally kills innocent people all the time.
1759300	1766300	If we build a new fire station, then on a long enough timescale, someone is eventually gonna be hit by one of its fire trucks and killed.
1766300	1771300	If we build a new motorway between two cities, there will inevitably be a fatal traffic accident on it.
1771300	1775300	The innocent people killed by the death penalty are no different,
1775300	1780300	to which the response is that those things provide useful societal benefits.
1780300	1784300	We accept the downsides because they're outweighed by the positives,
1784300	1787300	to which we say, so will the death penalty.
1787300	1794300	With all the crime, it will definitely deter if only you loosen up a little and start using it appropriately,
1794300	1796300	by which we mean a lot.
1796300	1803300	I like this argument because it's at least honest about the fact that the death penalty will kill innocent people,
1803300	1806300	and I find the bit about the bankers particularly persuasive.
1807300	1812300	Unfortunately, it falls apart upon examination, so here's why I don't agree with it.
1812300	1817300	The more substantial response to the accidental societal deaths argument is that,
1817300	1821300	with regards to the potential benefits of the death penalty,
1821300	1825300	the burden of proof is on the people arguing for it.
1825300	1831300	It's easy to prove that having a fire department, for instance, is a good idea with obvious societal benefits.
1831300	1835300	If we want the death penalty to be seen in the same way, it's on us to prove it.
1835300	1839300	With something so final as the state killing a person,
1839300	1844300	you can't just say it might have benefits without the evidence to back that up.
1844300	1850300	And faced with a lack of evidence, we may as well take the course of action that is later reversible,
1850300	1852300	rather than the one that is permanent.
1852300	1857300	We can let innocent people out of prison, but we can't raise the dead.
1857300	1863300	Additionally, another big problem with the deterrence argument is that it assumes a lucid murderer.
1863300	1870300	The sort of calculating criminals you see killing for personal profits in shows like Columbo and so on.
1870300	1874300	In reality, though, not many would-be killers are sitting in front of a spreadsheet
1874300	1878300	working out the odds of getting caught and the punishment they're likely to face
1878300	1881300	versus the benefits of doing a murder.
1881300	1885300	Hitmen, maybe, but they're not actually all that common.
1885300	1891300	Most murders are unplanned and carried out impulsively without thought for the future.
1891300	1896300	And for many of the worst criminals, say mass killers, serial killers and the likes,
1896300	1900300	they either fully expect to be killed by the police or themselves,
1900300	1905300	or they think they'll never be caught, or they don't care about being caught.
1905300	1908300	No legal punishment is going to deter those people.
1908300	1912300	If we do assume a lucid calculating criminal, though,
1912300	1914300	the sort of criminal who would think,
1914300	1918300	well, I don't mind doing life in prison, but I really don't want the death penalty,
1918300	1924300	then we run into a contradiction when we propose expanding the death penalty to crimes other than murder.
1924300	1927300	And it's a rather dangerous contradiction.
1927300	1932300	You see, the problem is, if we make the penalty for robbery, say, the same as for murder,
1932300	1935300	then our calculating criminal who just rubbed someone will think,
1935300	1941300	well, since the punishment is the same either way, I may as well just murder them now
1941300	1947300	because I have less chance of getting caught if the witness can't identify me on account of being dead.
1947300	1952300	Expanding the death penalty to other crimes will turn a lot of those crimes into murders,
1952300	1955300	assuming our calculating criminals exist anyway.
1955300	1958300	Hardly anyone thinks like this, of course,
1958300	1964300	but the fact that hardly anyone thinks like this is why the deterrence argument doesn't really work.
1964300	1971300	Most murderers aren't thinking logically about the future, because most murderers aren't thinking logically.
1971300	1974300	If they were, they probably wouldn't be murdering someone.
1974300	1980300	There is also a problem with the idea of expanding the death penalty to financial and corporate crimes,
1980300	1982300	as nice as that might sound.
1982300	1984300	And the problem is wealth inequality.
1984300	1987300	Money can buy better legal representation.
1987300	1990300	You can say this or that crime should have the death penalty,
1990300	1995300	but it's still the poor who are gonna be the ones receiving the majority of the death penalties.
1995300	1999300	Remedying that problem would take doing away with economic inequality,
1999300	2005300	which funnily enough would definitely do a lot more to lower the crime rate than any possible punishment would do.
2005300	2010300	More equal societies have a lower crime rate, after all.
2010300	2013300	Anyway, to loop back to Dennis Prager here,
2013300	2018300	he doesn't make the cost argument in his video, nor does he make the deterrence argument,
2018300	2021300	and that is a smart decision on his part.
2021300	2026300	Both of those arguments are easily countered with evidence, after all.
2026300	2031300	The death penalty is very expensive, and there is no evidence of it deterring crime.
2031300	2035300	These are things that you can show with, like, statistics.
2035300	2043300	So Dennis Prager wisely pins his whole case for the death penalty on the one argument which is difficult to disprove with statistics,
2043300	2046300	which is, how do you feel about it?
2046300	2053300	When someone does something terrible, don't you feel like they should face some equally terrible consequence?
2053300	2057300	And what about the pain inflicted on the loved ones of those murdered?
2057300	2062300	For most people, their suffering is immeasurably increased,
2062300	2065300	knowing that the person who murdered their family member or friend,
2065300	2073300	and who in many cases inflicted unimaginable terror, is alive and being cared for.
2073300	2077300	Of course, putting the murderer to death doesn't bring back their loved one,
2077300	2080300	but it sure does provide some sense of justice.
2080300	2085300	So, this is the other argument for the death penalty, the closure argument.
2085300	2092300	The death penalty provides the victim's loved ones with a sense of justice, or closure, or healing, or so on.
2092300	2094300	But is this actually true?
2094300	2097300	Now, you can't speak for every victim's family and friends, of course.
2097300	2099300	Different people are going to react differently.
2099300	2106300	Dennis Prager uses the example of one man who wants the death penalty for the men who killed his family members, for instance.
2106300	2112300	On the other hand, it is trivial to find examples of murder victims' families who oppose the death penalty.
2112300	2118300	For instance, the organization Murder Victims' Families for Human Rights, who...
2118300	2120300	Well, you know, you get it from the title, I imagine.
2120300	2124300	They're family members of murder victims who oppose the death penalty.
2124300	2126300	And that organization's website says,
2127300	2129300	Having all suffered a tragic loss,
2129300	2133300	murder victims' families for human rights members have come in different ways and times
2133300	2137300	to the understanding that the death penalty does not help us heal,
2137300	2140300	and is not the way to pursue justice for victims.
2140300	2145300	The death penalty, as a sentence, does not provide closure.
2145300	2149300	It's not carried out for a very long time, for a start.
2149300	2153300	Someone sentenced today might not be killed until 2040.
2153300	2158300	That's decades of them being alive and cared for, as Dennis Prager put it.
2158300	2161300	And rather than providing a sense of finality,
2161300	2166300	it is easier to imagine a death penalty sentence giving a sense of uncertainty.
2166300	2170300	Because it isn't a certain thing that the murderer will be executed.
2170300	2174300	Many sentences are later changed to life imprisonment, after all.
2174300	2181300	And remember that lengthy review and appeal process where the case is reexamined and often retried?
2181300	2185300	How would you imagine loved ones of murder victims are gonna feel about that?
2185300	2191300	Particularly if they were witnesses to the crime, which means they're gonna have to be directly involved in that whole process.
2191300	2195300	Having all the details brought up over and over again and so on.
2195300	2201300	With a sentence of life in prison, the families of victims know where they're at immediately.
2201300	2204300	But with the death penalty, they really don't.
2204300	2208300	They're in for years of wondering what's actually going to happen.
2208300	2213300	Rather than providing a sense of closure, the death penalty actually delays that closure.
2213300	2217300	And I'd like to briefly mention a study just to back this up somewhat.
2217300	2224300	Assessing the impact of the ultimate penal sanction on homicide survivors, a two-state comparison.
2224300	2227300	And let's briefly read the summary of that study.
2227300	2231300	Numerous studies have examined the psychological...
2233300	2237300	...ramifications that result from the murder of a loved one.
2237300	2245300	Except for the death penalty, however, sparse attention has been paid to the impact of the murderous sentence on homicide survivors' well-being.
2245300	2251300	Given the steadfastness of the public's opinion that the death penalty brings satisfaction and closure to survivors,
2251300	2259300	it is surprising that there has been no systematic inquiry directly with survivors about whether obtaining the ultimate punishment affects their healing.
2259300	2271300	This study used in-person interviews with a randomly selected sample of survivors from four time periods to examine the totality of the ultimate penal sanction process and its longitudinal impact on their lives.
2271300	2283300	Moreover, it assessed the differential effect of two types of UPS by comparing survivors' experiences in Texas, a death penalty state, and Minnesota, a life without the possibility of parole state.
2283300	2292300	Comparing states highlights differences primarily during the post-conviction stage, specifically with respect to the appeals process and in regard to survivor well-being.
2292300	2299300	In Minnesota, survivors of adjudicated cases showed higher levels of physical, psychological, and behavioral health.
2299300	2303300	This study's findings have implications for trial strategy and policy development.
2303300	2311300	So, at least in the case of this study, it looks like the death penalty is not providing the sense of closure that people might expect it to.
2311300	2315300	And I'll post a link to this below in case anyone wants to read it in more detail.
2315300	2322300	Dennis Prager ends his video by saying that he does not understand the other side of the death penalty argument,
2322300	2325300	which, you know, should have gone without saying, really.
2325300	2330300	But I'd like to end today by saying that I do understand the pro-death penalty argument.
2330300	2338300	I understand the desire for some sense of ultimate justice with regards to the sorts of awful murderers we've been talking about.
2338300	2341300	I live in England, where we do not have the death penalty.
2341300	2351300	But I imagine that if someone murdered my family or friends, I would, in that moment, want that person to suffer every possible punishment, up to and including the death penalty.
2351300	2354300	But that's just what I would personally want in the moment.
2354300	2359300	Nothing would have changed with regards to anything else we've been talking about today.
2360300	2369300	Instituting the death penalty because I want it in the one case would set the precedent for the state to execute people for other reasons that I might not agree with.
2369300	2375300	And it would reopen the door to the possibility of innocent people being wrongfully executed.
2375300	2381300	And that is ultimately a worse crime than me, as an individual, not getting what I want.
2382300	2384300	Thanks a lot for watching, folks.
