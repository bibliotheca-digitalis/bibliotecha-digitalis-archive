00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone. Today, we're going to be talking about the death penalty, or capital punishment.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,600
And we all know what that is, right?

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,900
When someone is killed by the state as punishment for a criminal act.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,500
And I want to talk about this for a few reasons.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,300
Firstly, while most countries around the world have either abolished capital punishment outright,

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,000
or only use it in very specific and rare circumstances,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,400
much of the world's population still lives in countries that retain the death penalty.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,500
Also, in countries that have abolished the death penalty, it can remain popular,

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,000
and its reintroduction is often argued for.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,400
A 2017 YouGov survey found that more than half of Brexit Leave voters in the UK, for instance,

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,100
think that the death penalty should be brought back.

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,800
Another reason I want to talk about the death penalty today is because I've noticed that frequently,

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,100
when discussing the pros and cons of the death penalty, people tend to have the wrong argument.

14
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,700
And for an example of this, we're going to take a look at a typical pro-death penalty argument,

15
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,100
such as the one offered by Dennis Prager of PragerU in his video,

16
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,900
Is the Death Penalty Ever Moral, which I will link below in the video description.

17
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:12,300
In this video, Dennis Prager argues that criminals who do sufficiently horrible things should be put to death.

18
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:17,900
And he uses as an example the 2007 Cheshire, Connecticut home invasion murders,

19
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:24,400
during which two criminals broke into a family's house and murdered three people in a particularly brutal manner.

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,000
Dennis Prager's argument in favor of executing these men is an emotional argument,

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,100
and he appeals directly to the feelings of his audience, talking about things like a sense of justice,

22
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,400
the pain inflicted on the loved ones of those murdered,

23
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,200
and asks whether torturers, rapists, murderers, and evil men like them deserve to keep their lives.

24
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,000
And this sort of appeal to emotion is the main thrust of many pro-death penalty arguments.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,200
Now, whether someone can forfeit the right to life with a sufficiently horrible action or series of actions

26
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,600
is a moral question, it's a philosophical question, and it's not a question that I'm going to be answering today.

27
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,300
If you believe that people who commit terrible crimes, such as Dennis Prager describes,

28
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,700
deserve in turn to lose their lives, I am not going to argue with you here.

29
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,700
In fact, we can proceed as if that is definitely true, if you like,

30
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:25,700
because regardless of how you feel about that question, it doesn't actually have anything to do with what we'll be talking about today,

31
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:31,200
which is whether the death penalty, as a practical process, should actually be carried out.

32
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:39,500
Is it possible for someone to lose the right to life is a different question to should society have the death penalty.

33
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,500
And I'm going to be arguing that no matter how you feel about the former question,

34
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,600
the answer to the latter question is no.

35
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:53,200
And if you disagree with that right now, all I ask is that you stick around for the rest of the video and hear me out.

36
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,200
Now, before we start, it is worth pointing out that many anti-death penalty arguments also appeal to emotion,

37
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,700
and I'm going to be trying to avoid those arguments going forward.

38
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,400
Reading or watching anti-death penalty arguments, you will often hear about, for example,

39
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,300
how the difficulty of securing the chemicals for lethal injections means that inferior chemicals can be used,

40
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,900
which can lead to drawn-out and painful or botched executions and so on.

41
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,800
Now, regardless of how any individual feels about that,

42
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,600
I don't see it being all that much of a convincing argument to someone who is currently in favor of the death penalty.

43
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,500
Since if you think a criminal did something so bad that they should be killed,

44
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,900
you probably don't care too much if they get hurt on the way out, right?

45
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:41,300
So as much as possible today, I'm going to be trying to avoid the emotional arguments and stick to the facts.

46
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,300
And to begin with here, let's stay with Dennis Prager's video for a while.

47
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:51,300
He opens his video by asserting that he just doesn't understand people who oppose the death penalty.

48
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:57,400
The gulf is unbridgeable, he says, between those of us who believe that some murderers should be put to death,

49
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,900
and those who believe that no murderer should ever be put to death.

50
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,500
Later, at the end of the video, he calls back to this opening paragraph, stating,

51
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:11,300
But if you really do believe these people deserve to keep their lives, well, as I said at the outset,

52
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,100
I don't understand you.

53
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:18,500
Now, these two quotes illustrate perfectly the disconnect I talked about a minute ago.

54
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,100
In the opening, Dennis Prager is talking about the process of people being put to death,

55
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:29,500
but at the end, he's talking about the philosophical question of whether those people deserve to keep their lives.

56
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,300
Two different questions, which he's treating as if they're the same.

57
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:39,100
In doing this, what Dennis Prager is missing is the possibility that someone could believe that criminals

58
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,900
who do the sorts of evil things he describes do deserve to lose their lives,

59
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,700
but that the death penalty is, separately to that, still a bad idea.

60
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:54,700
Oh! Well, the first thing is, there's crimes that the proper penalty is obviously death.

61
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,900
Obviously. Like, and I've read a lot about serial killers, for example.

62
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,300
I've read a lot of brutal material, you know.

63
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,100
I was very interested in criminology and antisocial behaviour, as well as political pathology.

64
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:11,100
It's like, there are guys like, I think it was John Wayne Gacy, who, yeah, you don't want to know about him.

65
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,500
I think he begged the judge for the death penalty.

66
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,500
He knew himself as like, there was no coming back from where he went.

67
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,100
Hmm.

68
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,700
So, but that's not the issue for me.

69
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,900
The issue is, do you give the state that much power?

70
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,100
And I would say, practically, no.

71
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,300
I think this is a very callous way of looking.

72
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,500
I think, in the United States, it costs $20 million to put someone to death.

73
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,900
It's like, why?

74
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,500
Well, because the state shouldn't just be able to do that easily.

75
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,300
And they make mistakes. Like, a lot of mistakes.

76
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,300
And so, maybe you just never want the state to have that much power.

77
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,100
And I think that's a reasonable argument.

78
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,100
Yeah, that's where...

79
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,900
I'm not comfortable with that.

80
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,100
That's where I'm at with it. I just don't want to give the state that power.

81
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:58,500
That was Jordan Peterson there, expressing to Dave Rubin his opinion that people can deserve to be killed,

82
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,500
but that he just doesn't trust the state to wield that much power.

83
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:08,100
And this is a common anti-death penalty argument made by anti-big government folks.

84
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:13,900
I picked a clip of Jordan Peterson there because he has been the narrator of multiple PragerU videos.

85
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,300
So if Dennis Prager would like to understand an anti-death penalty argument,

86
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,100
I suppose he could just ask Jordan Peterson.

87
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,700
Peterson's argument also reveals a contradiction in Prager's position,

88
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,100
and it's to do with the size and role of the government.

89
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,900
We all know how PragerU feels about the government, right?

90
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,500
And by the way, when does the government do a good job at fixing anything?

91
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,900
The bigger the government, the smaller the citizen.

92
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,300
Why is the government so bad at healthcare?

93
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,700
The government is killing small businesses.

94
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,300
Killing them with excessive taxes, over-regulation, and complicated compliance.

95
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,500
The worst environmental offenders have been big, repressive, socialist governments.

96
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,300
People in government will sell government influence for personal and political gain.

97
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,300
It's mired in bureaucracy, and it's fraught with waste.

98
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,300
The more a government tightens its grip, the less an economy grows.

99
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,300
So what's the solution?

100
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,300
Less government, not more.

101
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:17,700
Yes, the government is big, bloated, slow, corrupt, mired in red tape and regulations.

102
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,300
It's not fit to run the DMV, let alone a healthcare system.

103
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:28,500
And this is the government that Dennis Prager trusts to competently decide who deserves to live and die?

104
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,300
Why?

105
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,300
The same state bureaucracy that his other videos describe as inefficient and corrupt

106
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,700
is suddenly perfectly competent when it comes to sentencing the death penalty.

107
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:46,100
Is having the power to end the lives of its citizens not the ultimate example of big government?

108
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,100
Not to wonder off-topic too much here,

109
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,500
but this is an example of how most of the time, when people complain about the size of the government,

110
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,700
their arguments usually have very little to do with the actual size of the government.

111
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:03,100
In a less silly world, if someone claimed to be against big government,

112
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,700
we might assume that they support things like decreasing military spending,

113
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:13,300
ending wars, demilitarizing the police, reducing the number of people in prison,

114
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,100
and relevant for us here, being against the death penalty.

115
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,300
If you don't trust the government and want it to be smaller,

116
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,900
you probably shouldn't also want it to have an enormous army,

117
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,500
an armed police force, and power of life and death over its citizens.

118
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,300
Too often, though, people who complain about big government love all that stuff,

119
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:40,100
and what they actually mean when they say big government is solely government healthcare and welfare programs.

120
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,900
Anyway, to get back on track,

121
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,300
Dennis Prager has decided to break with PragerU tradition

122
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:51,900
and now totally trusts the government to judge and implement the death penalty fairly and accurately.

123
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:57,700
He says the number of innocent people who might be wrongly executed is infinitesimally small

124
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,700
thanks to DNA testing and other advanced forensic tools,

125
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,700
which make executing an innocent person virtually impossible.

126
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,700
The chance of executing an innocent person is, of course,

127
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,500
one of the most common and strongest arguments against the death penalty.

128
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,100
Because, obviously, if it comes to light that someone was wrongfully imprisoned,

129
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,900
they can be let out of prison,

130
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,300
but if it comes to light that someone was wrongfully executed,

131
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,300
that's it. They're dead.

132
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,700
Dennis Prager steps around this argument by saying our modern forensic tools

133
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,900
make it virtually impossible to execute an innocent person,

134
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,900
but he's missing something there.

135
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,500
He's making a rather big assumption.

136
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,900
Now, before we get into exactly what he is missing here,

137
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,500
let's first imagine an airtight murder case.

138
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,700
Let's say a husband and wife are walking down the street

139
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,700
when they're approached by a mugger armed with a gun.

140
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,100
And in the process of robbing the couple, he shoots and kills the wife.

141
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:01,100
The police are called, and based upon the description of the criminal given to the police by the husband,

142
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,300
they pick up a suspect near the scene of the crime.

143
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,500
When they bring the suspect to the husband, he says yes, that's him.

144
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,100
He's the person who shot my wife.

145
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,700
The police then arrest the suspect, and when they later question him,

146
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,300
he admits to the crime and signs a written confession saying,

147
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,700
yes, I did it. I'm the person who shot that woman.

148
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,300
So, case closed, right?

149
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,100
We have a positive identification of the murderer

150
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,900
from a witness who was a foot away when the crime was committed,

151
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,500
and a signed written confession from the murderer saying that they did it.

152
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,100
Few cases get more clear-cut than that.

153
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,500
So this case was an actual case.

154
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,300
The crime happened in May of the year 2000.

155
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,500
Two tourists from Georgia, that's the state, not the country,

156
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,700
were staying at a Ramada Inn in Jacksonville, Florida.

157
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,700
Outside of their hotel, they were approached by a criminal

158
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:57,300
who, in the process of mugging them, shot and killed Mary Ann Stevens.

159
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,900
Her husband, James Stevens, identified Brenton Butler,

160
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,700
who was picked up nearby by the police as the killer,

161
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,900
and Butler confessed to the murder during questioning.

162
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,700
However, as I imagine many of you already suspect,

163
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,500
there is more to this case than meets the eye.

164
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,500
Firstly, the husband of the victim was mistaken

165
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
in his identification of the criminal.

166
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,300
He just got the wrong guy.

167
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,700
And this is a thing that happens.

168
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,500
Witnesses make mistakes,

169
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,900
particularly witnesses who were just involved in a very traumatic experience.

170
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:31,300
But why, you might wonder, did the wrong guy confess to the crime?

171
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,900
Well, during the trial, Brenton Butler alleged

172
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,100
that the police physically abused him into confessing.

173
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:41,700
They allegedly, again, my lawyers reminding me to say,

174
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,700
physically intimidated him and hit him several times

175
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,700
until he confessed to the crime.

176
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,700
This is all the subject of a very interesting documentary

177
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,700
called Murder on a Sunday Morning,

178
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,300
which I would highly recommend if you want to know more about this case.

179
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,500
The film follows Butler's defense team,

180
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,100
two public defenders called Patrick McGinnis and Ann Finnell,

181
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,900
as they put together the case for Butler's innocence.

182
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,700
And they rarely tear the police apart in the courtroom

183
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,100
and expose their awful and incompetent investigation,

184
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,100
which is very satisfying to watch.

185
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,700
The police, for example, didn't even search Brenton Butler's house

186
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,100
looking for the items he supposedly stole

187
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,500
or interview his family members with regards to his whereabouts

188
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
at the time of the crime.

189
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,100
You knew you didn't have a gun.

190
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,300
You knew you didn't have a purse.

191
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,300
You knew you didn't have any money.

192
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,300
You knew you didn't have a fisherman's hat, right?

193
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,500
That's all correct.

194
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,500
Okay.

195
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,500
Did you ask Brent,

196
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,500
can I go search your house, your room?

197
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,300
No, sir, I did not.

198
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,300
Did you get a search warrant for his house?

199
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,300
No, sir, I did not.

200
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,300
You wanted to find a gun and a purse

201
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,300
and bloody clothes and everything else, right?

202
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,300
Yes, sir, it would have been nice.

203
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,300
So why not get a search warrant?

204
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,300
Well, we just didn't get a search warrant.

205
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,300
And it's not that hard to imagine

206
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,300
what allegedly happened here.

207
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,300
A tourist was shot and killed outside a hotel.

208
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,300
That is not a great headline for attracting more tourists to your town.

209
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,300
So there's a lot of pressure on the police

210
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,300
to solve that particular crime very quickly.

211
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,300
And here you have an eyewitness who has already identified someone

212
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,300
in your custody who they say did the crime.

213
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,300
And that someone is a teenager

214
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,300
who you just need to get to sign a piece of paper

215
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,300
to put this case away quickly.

216
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,300
So you make him sign the paper.

217
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,300
Allegedly.

218
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,300
And you don't go around investigating other things

219
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,300
that you know will make the case against him weaker.

220
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,300
So you don't search his house for the stolen items

221
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,300
that you know aren't there.

222
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,300
You don't interview potential alibis

223
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,300
who could get him off the hook.

224
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,300
You just pin everything on the witness ID

225
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,300
and the confession and hope that that's enough

226
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,300
to get the case across the line.

227
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,300
So you might ask why I'm talking about this particular case

228
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,300
in a video about the death penalty.

229
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,300
Butler was too young to be given the death penalty anyway,

230
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,300
even if he was found guilty,

231
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,300
so that wouldn't apply here.

232
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,300
And even if he was found guilty,

233
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,300
the real killer was later caught

234
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,300
when someone tipped the police off to who it was.

235
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,300
So Butler probably would have been let out anyway,

236
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,300
even if he was wrongly convicted.

237
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,300
But my point here is to show a case

238
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,300
in which the criminal justice system, or part of it,

239
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,300
in this case the police force,

240
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,300
could have a motivation to deliberately allow

241
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,300
an innocent person to be convicted

242
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,300
of a crime they did not commit.

243
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,300
This is what Dennis Prager misses

244
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,300
when discussing investigative techniques

245
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,300
and forensic tools.

246
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,300
Because yes, in many cases

247
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,300
we do have very powerful forensic tools.

248
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,300
But you also have to be able to trust

249
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,300
the people with those tools

250
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,300
not to lie.

251
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,300
And also to actually use the tools, I suppose.

252
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,300
What Prager leaves out is the human element.

253
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,300
The police will sometimes,

254
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,300
for example, plant evidence.

255
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,300
There was a case just recently in New York

256
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,300
where an officer was caught on camera

257
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,300
appearing to plant drugs in a car.

258
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,300
And this is similar to a case from last year

259
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,300
when a Florida police officer was arrested

260
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,300
after an investigation showed he repeatedly

261
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,300
planted meth on people during traffic stops.

262
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,300
Police will sometimes take bribes from criminals.

263
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,300
They will lie in court,

264
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,300
cover up for the crimes of other officers,

265
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,300
beat confessions out of innocent people, and so on.

266
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,300
Even if all cops are bastards

267
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,300
is a little too absolutist for you,

268
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,300
you have to admit that sometimes

269
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,300
some cops are bastards,

270
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,300
and some judges are bastards,

271
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,300
and some lawyers,

272
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,300
a lot of lawyers, are bastards.

273
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,300
Or incompetent, or lazy, or corrupt,

274
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,300
or just apathetic.

275
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,300
The accuracy of a particular

276
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,300
investigative technique or forensic method

277
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,300
is only one part of the calculation

278
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,300
we have to do when determining odds

279
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,300
of someone being innocent.

280
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,300
We also have to trust the justice system

281
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,300
not to lie, or cheat,

282
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,300
or just have made a mistake.

283
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,300
You can say DNA analysis of a piece of evidence

284
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,300
is almost perfectly accurate,

285
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,300
but it cannot tell you whether or not

286
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,300
that piece of evidence was planted

287
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,300
at the scene of a crime.

288
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,300
Now I'm not saying that's necessarily

289
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,300
going to be a very common occurrence,

290
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,300
don't get me wrong, but it is a possibility.

291
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,300
We have an imperfect justice system

292
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,300
run by imperfect people.

293
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,300
No one type of evidence is ever going to be flawless.

294
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,300
Even video evidence.

295
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,300
Dennis Prager in his video says

296
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,300
opponents of capital punishment

297
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,300
oppose the death penalty even when

298
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,300
there is absolute proof of the murderer's guilt.

299
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,300
If there were a video of a man

300
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,300
burning a family alive,

301
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,300
opponents of capital punishment

302
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,300
would still oppose taking that man's life.

303
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,300
Now the implication there is that

304
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,300
a video would be absolute proof of guilt.

305
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,300
But is it really?

306
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,300
This is a statement that's going to be

307
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,300
less and less true over time,

308
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,300
and that's simply because technological

309
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,300
advances mean that video is getting

310
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,300
easier and easier to fake.

311
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,300
It is getting harder to spot videos

312
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,300
that are authentic and videos

313
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,300
that were created in a computer.

314
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,300
Many of you will remember this video

315
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,300
from a few years ago of a fake Barack Obama

316
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,300
that was created in a computer

317
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,300
using an AI video tool.

318
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,300
Now the more observant folks in the audience

319
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,300
might still be able to tell this is fake,

320
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,300
you can see something seems a little off about it, right?

321
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:23,300
However, it is already eerily similar to the real thing, is it not?

322
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,300
And before long, it's going to be very difficult indeed

323
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,300
to tell the difference between authentic videos

324
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,300
and fake videos like this one.

325
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,300
And if you were led by my prompting there

326
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,300
to believe that this is a fake video of Barack Obama,

327
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,300
then we are already at that moment

328
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,300
because this is not a fake video of Barack Obama.

329
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,300
This is a real video of Barack Obama.

330
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,300
I just put a real video under the headline describing the fake one.

331
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,300
Anyway, me being a smart-ass aside,

332
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,300
while faked videos aren't a huge problem

333
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,300
for the legal system right now,

334
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,300
as the technology gets both more advanced and easier to use,

335
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,300
it very well could be a problem in the future.

336
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,300
And even with a non-fake video,

337
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,300
we can still imagine perfectly possible scenarios

338
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,300
in which executing a man based on video evidence

339
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,300
of him committing a crime would be a bad idea.

340
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,300
What if the man had off-screen accomplices in his crime?

341
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,300
If you kill him, you've got less of a chance of finding them, right?

342
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,300
What if the person doing the crime was someone who was coerced

343
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,300
or forced into it by some other person?

344
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,300
What if someone threatened to murder his family

345
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,300
unless he did the horrible thing on their behalf?

346
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,300
Again, as with a bribed judge or planted evidence,

347
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,300
I'm not saying that these things would be happening every day,

348
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,300
just that it is a possibility.

349
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,300
And no matter how unlikely, if you execute enough people,

350
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,300
you will eventually kill an innocent person.

351
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,300
So the pro-death penalty argument has to be

352
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:53,300
that killing the occasional innocent person is an acceptable risk,

353
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,300
because that risk is outweighed by the positives

354
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,300
that come from having the death penalty.

355
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:02,300
So, what are the positives to having the death penalty?

356
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,300
One you will often see proposed is cost.

357
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,300
Why should the taxpayer pay to feed and clothe some horrible murderer

358
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,300
who might live for another however many decades, right?

359
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,300
It would be better and cheaper to just kill them outright.

360
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,300
Well, in practice, this isn't actually true.

361
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,300
In the United States, for instance,

362
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:25,300
it is vastly more expensive to execute people than to imprison them for life.

363
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:30,300
Executing someone is a very complicated and slow legal process.

364
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,300
Some inmates spend more than 20 years on death row before being executed.

365
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:38,300
It's so slow because there are various stages of review and appeal

366
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,300
before the death penalty can actually be carried out.

367
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,300
Now, the obvious counterargument to this is to say,

368
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,300
well, what if we just sped that process up a little?

369
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,300
If we just executed people right after they were found guilty,

370
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,300
that massive expense would not exist, right?

371
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,300
And execution would be the cheaper option.

372
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,300
And the counterargument to this counterargument is that

373
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,300
the slow appeal and review process exists for a very good reason.

374
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,300
If you thought my proposed scenarios a minute ago

375
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,300
as to how an innocent person could end up being executed

376
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,300
sounded like ridiculous million-to-one shots,

377
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,300
then what you need is a real-life example.

378
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,300
So let's talk about the rather infamous case of Timothy Evans,

379
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,300
something I imagine some of you will know about already.

380
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:28,300
So, Timothy Evans was a Welshman who lived in London in 1949

381
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,300
with his wife and child.

382
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,300
And in November of 1949, he went to the police

383
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,300
and informed them that his wife, Beryl Evans, had died.

384
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,300
And the story he told police was that his wife was pregnant,

385
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,300
but since the couple thought they could not support another child,

386
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,300
they had taken up the proposal of their downstairs neighbor,

387
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,300
John Christie, who had offered to perform an abortion.

388
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,300
Christie apparently botched the abortion

389
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,300
and accidentally killed Beryl Evans.

390
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,300
Christie then persuaded Timothy Evans

391
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,300
to go and stay with relatives in Wales

392
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,300
while he disposed of Beryl Evans' body

393
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,300
and made arrangements for a couple to look after their daughter.

394
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,300
So, Timothy Evans went to Wales,

395
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,300
only to a few weeks later decide to go to the police

396
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,300
and tell them what had happened.

397
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,300
Only, when he first told the story to the police,

398
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,300
he left Christie out of it,

399
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,300
saying that he himself had been the one to dispose of his wife's body

400
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,300
and the one who arranged for his daughter to be looked after.

401
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,300
In response to this account, the police searched the place

402
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,300
where Evans said he had disposed of the body,

403
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,300
which was in a sewer drain, only to find there was no body there

404
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,300
and that lifting the drain cover

405
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,300
would have been physically impossible for a single man.

406
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,300
So Evans, when re-questioned, changed his story

407
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,300
and this time included Christie,

408
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,300
stating that he had previously been trying to protect Christie

409
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
by not mentioning him.

410
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,300
So Evans told the police that Christie was the one who hid the body

411
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,300
and arranged for his daughter to be looked after.

412
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,300
In response to this new account,

413
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,300
police searched the building where both Evans and Christie lived

414
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,300
and discovered in the wash house in the back garden

415
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,300
the bodies of not just Beryl Evans,

416
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,300
but also her daughter with Timothy Evans.

417
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,300
Both had been strangled to death.

418
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,300
When he was informed that his wife and daughter had been strangled,

419
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,300
Timothy Evans confessed to the crime.

420
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,300
Or... did he?

421
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,300
His questioning by the police produced a confession,

422
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,300
though he later stated in court that this confession was made

423
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,300
because he feared being subjected to violence by the police.

424
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,300
So, from the perspective of the police here,

425
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,300
a man came in and said his wife was dead

426
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,300
and then he told them multiple contradictory accounts of how it happened.

427
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,300
Most of the time, he is going to be the killer.

428
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,300
However, Timothy Evans was not the killer.

429
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,300
His wife and daughter were killed by John Christie.

430
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,300
There was no botched abortion or arranging for the daughter

431
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,300
to be sent elsewhere to be looked after.

432
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,300
John Christie murdered them both because he was a serial killer.

433
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,300
The things he told Timothy Evans about what had happened were lies.

434
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:05,300
However, John Christie was also a former War Reserve police officer.

435
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:10,300
This, coupled with the police clearly believing that Timothy Evans was obviously the killer,

436
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:14,300
led them to carry out an incredibly lazy investigation.

437
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,300
They know it's Timothy Evans,

438
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,300
so there's no need to investigate the crime scene all that well,

439
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:25,300
and we can take John Christie at his word since he used to be a copper just like us.

440
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,300
And if Timothy Evans won't confess to the crime,

441
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:32,300
we can just persuade him to confess to the crime,

442
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,300
if you know what I mean.

443
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,300
Wink.

444
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:40,300
This led the police to missing that John Christie had bodies of his prior victims

445
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,300
buried in shallow graves in his back garden,

446
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:48,300
so shallow that a dog was able to dig up one of the skulls,

447
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:52,300
and a thigh bone was later apparently found propping up his fence.

448
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,300
He also had multiple criminal convictions for theft and assault,

449
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,300
including attacking a woman with a cricket bat,

450
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,300
which was seemingly overlooked by the police.

451
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,300
Because of the police's rubbish investigation

452
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,300
and Timothy Evans' temporary confession to the crime,

453
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,300
however that came about,

454
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:14,300
Evans was put on trial for murder on the 11th of January 1950,

455
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,300
and was found guilty.

456
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,300
Executed on the 9th of March, less than three months later.

457
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,300
So the state executed an innocent man.

458
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,300
And this sounds like a ridiculous million-to-one shot, right?

459
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,300
What if it wasn't the husband,

460
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,300
and the downstairs neighbor is actually a scheming serial killer?

461
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:38,300
It sounds like paranoid fiction, and it is incredibly unlikely.

462
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,300
But things like this do happen,

463
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:44,300
and there are multiple things we should take into account regarding this case.

464
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:50,300
Firstly, it is a very good example of why it is an incredibly bad idea to execute people quickly.

465
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:56,300
All those slow reviews and appeals exist to catch exactly these sorts of mistakes.

466
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,300
Christie was caught three years later in 1953, for instance,

467
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,300
at which point, if Timothy Evans had not already been executed,

468
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,300
he could have been let out of prison.

469
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:10,300
So yes, the justice system could kill people faster,

470
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,300
but if you do that, you're going to make more mistakes.

471
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,300
So you have to be okay with killing more innocent people,

472
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,300
in order to make the process cheaper, I guess.

473
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:24,300
So you're basically killing innocent people for money at that point,

474
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,300
which sounds like the opposite of something the justice system should be doing.

475
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:33,300
Next up, killing an innocent person is only half the crime here.

476
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,300
Because the justice system got the wrong guy,

477
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,300
the actual killer was still out there,

478
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:41,300
and John Christie killed four more people before he was caught.

479
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,300
Timothy Evans could have been a witness

480
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:48,300
that helped to bring Christie to justice years earlier than he was.

481
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:53,300
Instead, he was wrongfully executed, and Christie went on to kill again.

482
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,300
So this is my answer to the cost of the death penalty.

483
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,300
You can do it quick, cheap, and bad,

484
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,300
or you can do it slow and expensive.

485
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:07,300
The question is how many innocent people you're willing to risk accidentally killing.

486
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,300
According to the Death Penalty Information Center,

487
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,300
in the United States, for instance,

488
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,300
more than 160 people on death row

489
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:19,300
were later found to be wrongfully convicted and were exonerated.

490
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,300
And they're just the ones who have been found.

491
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,300
Remember, the actual number of wrongfully convicted people

492
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,300
is likely much higher than that.

493
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,300
And let's look at some of the reasons for those exonerations.

494
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,300
False or misleading forensic evidence,

495
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,300
official misconduct, perjury or false accusation,

496
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:40,300
inadequate legal defense, mistaken witness identification,

497
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:46,300
these supposedly very unlikely scenarios happen much more often than we might like to admit.

498
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:52,300
Anyway, the next pro-death penalty argument I want to take a look at is deterrence.

499
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,300
The death penalty is worth its various downsides.

500
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,300
It's argued because it deters crime.

501
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:02,300
Now, the big problem with this argument is that there isn't any evidence for it.

502
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:07,300
For instance, comparing between states within the US that have the death penalty and those that don't,

503
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:13,300
there is no positive correlation between having the death penalty and a lowered rate of crime.

504
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,300
And for countries that have abolished the death penalty,

505
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:20,300
there is no evidence that doing so caused the crime rate to rise.

506
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,300
So that's it for this argument, right? There's no evidence.

507
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,300
However, leaving things there would be a bit of a mistake.

508
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:33,300
There is a relatively good death penalty argument to be made here with regard to deterrence.

509
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,300
And I compiled this from various sources,

510
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:41,300
but primarily from the pro-death penalty arguments contained within the book debating the death penalty.

511
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:45,300
So let's do the relatively good death penalty argument.

512
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,300
And if I appeared on camera during these videos,

513
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:54,300
this is the point where I'd burst through the door wearing a hat and a fake mustache and proceed to argue with myself in character.

514
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:59,300
But since I'm not much of an actor, we'll all just have to use our imaginations.

515
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,300
So, the argument goes like this.

516
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:05,300
The death penalty deters crime, to which the response is,

517
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,300
no it doesn't, there's no evidence for that.

518
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:16,300
But, we respond, the death penalty would deter crime, it would, had it not been so weakened.

519
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:20,300
There's no evidence of deterrence under our current system, sure,

520
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:25,300
but under our current system, only very small amounts of crimes are eligible for the death penalty,

521
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:30,300
only a very small number of those cases actually result in a death penalty sentence,

522
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,300
many of those are later overturned,

523
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:36,300
and the legal process between arrest and execution takes years.

524
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,300
Of course, that system isn't deterring anyone,

525
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:47,300
because the odds of getting executed are too low, it happens too slowly, it's too abstract to be a good deterrent.

526
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:55,300
If we want the death penalty to discourage anyone, it needs to be used more often, faster, and for a wider variety of crimes.

527
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,300
For instance, we'll execute someone for killing one other person in a robbery,

528
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,300
but not a banker who defrauds thousands of people,

529
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:06,300
or a politician who starts a war that kills hundreds of thousands.

530
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:11,300
Now, the obvious response to increased use of the death penalty, as we talked about just previously,

531
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,300
is that you're gonna execute more innocent people,

532
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,300
and to that, we say,

533
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,300
the state accidentally kills innocent people all the time.

534
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:26,300
If we build a new fire station, then on a long enough timescale, someone is eventually gonna be hit by one of its fire trucks and killed.

535
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:31,300
If we build a new motorway between two cities, there will inevitably be a fatal traffic accident on it.

536
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:35,300
The innocent people killed by the death penalty are no different,

537
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:40,300
to which the response is that those things provide useful societal benefits.

538
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,300
We accept the downsides because they're outweighed by the positives,

539
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,300
to which we say, so will the death penalty.

540
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:54,300
With all the crime, it will definitely deter if only you loosen up a little and start using it appropriately,

541
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,300
by which we mean a lot.

542
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:03,300
I like this argument because it's at least honest about the fact that the death penalty will kill innocent people,

543
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,300
and I find the bit about the bankers particularly persuasive.

544
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:12,300
Unfortunately, it falls apart upon examination, so here's why I don't agree with it.

545
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:17,300
The more substantial response to the accidental societal deaths argument is that,

546
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:21,300
with regards to the potential benefits of the death penalty,

547
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:25,300
the burden of proof is on the people arguing for it.

548
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:31,300
It's easy to prove that having a fire department, for instance, is a good idea with obvious societal benefits.

549
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:35,300
If we want the death penalty to be seen in the same way, it's on us to prove it.

550
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:39,300
With something so final as the state killing a person,

551
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:44,300
you can't just say it might have benefits without the evidence to back that up.

552
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:50,300
And faced with a lack of evidence, we may as well take the course of action that is later reversible,

553
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,300
rather than the one that is permanent.

554
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:57,300
We can let innocent people out of prison, but we can't raise the dead.

555
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:03,300
Additionally, another big problem with the deterrence argument is that it assumes a lucid murderer.

556
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:10,300
The sort of calculating criminals you see killing for personal profits in shows like Columbo and so on.

557
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:14,300
In reality, though, not many would-be killers are sitting in front of a spreadsheet

558
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:18,300
working out the odds of getting caught and the punishment they're likely to face

559
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,300
versus the benefits of doing a murder.

560
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:25,300
Hitmen, maybe, but they're not actually all that common.

561
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:31,300
Most murders are unplanned and carried out impulsively without thought for the future.

562
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:36,300
And for many of the worst criminals, say mass killers, serial killers and the likes,

563
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:40,300
they either fully expect to be killed by the police or themselves,

564
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:45,300
or they think they'll never be caught, or they don't care about being caught.

565
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,300
No legal punishment is going to deter those people.

566
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:52,300
If we do assume a lucid calculating criminal, though,

567
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,300
the sort of criminal who would think,

568
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:58,300
well, I don't mind doing life in prison, but I really don't want the death penalty,

569
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:04,300
then we run into a contradiction when we propose expanding the death penalty to crimes other than murder.

570
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,300
And it's a rather dangerous contradiction.

571
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:12,300
You see, the problem is, if we make the penalty for robbery, say, the same as for murder,

572
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,300
then our calculating criminal who just rubbed someone will think,

573
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:21,300
well, since the punishment is the same either way, I may as well just murder them now

574
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:27,300
because I have less chance of getting caught if the witness can't identify me on account of being dead.

575
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:32,300
Expanding the death penalty to other crimes will turn a lot of those crimes into murders,

576
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,300
assuming our calculating criminals exist anyway.

577
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,300
Hardly anyone thinks like this, of course,

578
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:44,300
but the fact that hardly anyone thinks like this is why the deterrence argument doesn't really work.

579
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:51,300
Most murderers aren't thinking logically about the future, because most murderers aren't thinking logically.

580
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,300
If they were, they probably wouldn't be murdering someone.

581
00:32:54,300 --> 00:33:00,300
There is also a problem with the idea of expanding the death penalty to financial and corporate crimes,

582
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,300
as nice as that might sound.

583
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,300
And the problem is wealth inequality.

584
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,300
Money can buy better legal representation.

585
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,300
You can say this or that crime should have the death penalty,

586
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:15,300
but it's still the poor who are gonna be the ones receiving the majority of the death penalties.

587
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:19,300
Remedying that problem would take doing away with economic inequality,

588
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:25,300
which funnily enough would definitely do a lot more to lower the crime rate than any possible punishment would do.

589
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:30,300
More equal societies have a lower crime rate, after all.

590
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,300
Anyway, to loop back to Dennis Prager here,

591
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:38,300
he doesn't make the cost argument in his video, nor does he make the deterrence argument,

592
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,300
and that is a smart decision on his part.

593
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:46,300
Both of those arguments are easily countered with evidence, after all.

594
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:51,300
The death penalty is very expensive, and there is no evidence of it deterring crime.

595
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:55,300
These are things that you can show with, like, statistics.

596
00:33:55,300 --> 00:34:03,300
So Dennis Prager wisely pins his whole case for the death penalty on the one argument which is difficult to disprove with statistics,

597
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,300
which is, how do you feel about it?

598
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:13,300
When someone does something terrible, don't you feel like they should face some equally terrible consequence?

599
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:17,300
And what about the pain inflicted on the loved ones of those murdered?

600
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:22,300
For most people, their suffering is immeasurably increased,

601
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,300
knowing that the person who murdered their family member or friend,

602
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:33,300
and who in many cases inflicted unimaginable terror, is alive and being cared for.

603
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,300
Of course, putting the murderer to death doesn't bring back their loved one,

604
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,300
but it sure does provide some sense of justice.

605
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:45,300
So, this is the other argument for the death penalty, the closure argument.

606
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:52,300
The death penalty provides the victim's loved ones with a sense of justice, or closure, or healing, or so on.

607
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,300
But is this actually true?

608
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,300
Now, you can't speak for every victim's family and friends, of course.

609
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,300
Different people are going to react differently.

610
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:06,300
Dennis Prager uses the example of one man who wants the death penalty for the men who killed his family members, for instance.

611
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:12,300
On the other hand, it is trivial to find examples of murder victims' families who oppose the death penalty.

612
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:18,300
For instance, the organization Murder Victims' Families for Human Rights, who...

613
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,300
Well, you know, you get it from the title, I imagine.

614
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:24,300
They're family members of murder victims who oppose the death penalty.

615
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,300
And that organization's website says,

616
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,300
Having all suffered a tragic loss,

617
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:33,300
murder victims' families for human rights members have come in different ways and times

618
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:37,300
to the understanding that the death penalty does not help us heal,

619
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,300
and is not the way to pursue justice for victims.

620
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:45,300
The death penalty, as a sentence, does not provide closure.

621
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:49,300
It's not carried out for a very long time, for a start.

622
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:53,300
Someone sentenced today might not be killed until 2040.

623
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:58,300
That's decades of them being alive and cared for, as Dennis Prager put it.

624
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,300
And rather than providing a sense of finality,

625
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:06,300
it is easier to imagine a death penalty sentence giving a sense of uncertainty.

626
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:10,300
Because it isn't a certain thing that the murderer will be executed.

627
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,300
Many sentences are later changed to life imprisonment, after all.

628
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:21,300
And remember that lengthy review and appeal process where the case is reexamined and often retried?

629
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,300
How would you imagine loved ones of murder victims are gonna feel about that?

630
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:31,300
Particularly if they were witnesses to the crime, which means they're gonna have to be directly involved in that whole process.

631
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:35,300
Having all the details brought up over and over again and so on.

632
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:41,300
With a sentence of life in prison, the families of victims know where they're at immediately.

633
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,300
But with the death penalty, they really don't.

634
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:48,300
They're in for years of wondering what's actually going to happen.

635
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:53,300
Rather than providing a sense of closure, the death penalty actually delays that closure.

636
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:57,300
And I'd like to briefly mention a study just to back this up somewhat.

637
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:04,300
Assessing the impact of the ultimate penal sanction on homicide survivors, a two-state comparison.

638
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,300
And let's briefly read the summary of that study.

639
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,300
Numerous studies have examined the psychological...

640
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:17,300
...ramifications that result from the murder of a loved one.

641
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:25,300
Except for the death penalty, however, sparse attention has been paid to the impact of the murderous sentence on homicide survivors' well-being.

642
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:31,300
Given the steadfastness of the public's opinion that the death penalty brings satisfaction and closure to survivors,

643
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:39,300
it is surprising that there has been no systematic inquiry directly with survivors about whether obtaining the ultimate punishment affects their healing.

644
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:51,300
This study used in-person interviews with a randomly selected sample of survivors from four time periods to examine the totality of the ultimate penal sanction process and its longitudinal impact on their lives.

645
00:37:51,300 --> 00:38:03,300
Moreover, it assessed the differential effect of two types of UPS by comparing survivors' experiences in Texas, a death penalty state, and Minnesota, a life without the possibility of parole state.

646
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:12,300
Comparing states highlights differences primarily during the post-conviction stage, specifically with respect to the appeals process and in regard to survivor well-being.

647
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:19,300
In Minnesota, survivors of adjudicated cases showed higher levels of physical, psychological, and behavioral health.

648
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:23,300
This study's findings have implications for trial strategy and policy development.

649
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:31,300
So, at least in the case of this study, it looks like the death penalty is not providing the sense of closure that people might expect it to.

650
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:35,300
And I'll post a link to this below in case anyone wants to read it in more detail.

651
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:42,300
Dennis Prager ends his video by saying that he does not understand the other side of the death penalty argument,

652
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,300
which, you know, should have gone without saying, really.

653
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:50,300
But I'd like to end today by saying that I do understand the pro-death penalty argument.

654
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:58,300
I understand the desire for some sense of ultimate justice with regards to the sorts of awful murderers we've been talking about.

655
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,300
I live in England, where we do not have the death penalty.

656
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:11,300
But I imagine that if someone murdered my family or friends, I would, in that moment, want that person to suffer every possible punishment, up to and including the death penalty.

657
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,300
But that's just what I would personally want in the moment.

658
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:19,300
Nothing would have changed with regards to anything else we've been talking about today.

659
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:29,300
Instituting the death penalty because I want it in the one case would set the precedent for the state to execute people for other reasons that I might not agree with.

660
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:35,300
And it would reopen the door to the possibility of innocent people being wrongfully executed.
