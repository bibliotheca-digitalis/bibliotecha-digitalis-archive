00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Hello, everyone. Today, we're going to be talking about the death penalty, or capital punishment.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.600
And we all know what that is, right?

00:06.600 --> 00:10.900
When someone is killed by the state as punishment for a criminal act.

00:10.900 --> 00:13.500
And I want to talk about this for a few reasons.

00:13.500 --> 00:18.300
Firstly, while most countries around the world have either abolished capital punishment outright,

00:18.300 --> 00:22.000
or only use it in very specific and rare circumstances,

00:22.000 --> 00:26.400
much of the world's population still lives in countries that retain the death penalty.

00:26.400 --> 00:30.500
Also, in countries that have abolished the death penalty, it can remain popular,

00:30.500 --> 00:33.000
and its reintroduction is often argued for.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.400
A 2017 YouGov survey found that more than half of Brexit Leave voters in the UK, for instance,

00:39.400 --> 00:42.100
think that the death penalty should be brought back.

00:42.100 --> 00:46.800
Another reason I want to talk about the death penalty today is because I've noticed that frequently,

00:46.800 --> 00:52.100
when discussing the pros and cons of the death penalty, people tend to have the wrong argument.

00:52.100 --> 00:56.700
And for an example of this, we're going to take a look at a typical pro-death penalty argument,

00:56.700 --> 01:01.100
such as the one offered by Dennis Prager of PragerU in his video,

01:01.100 --> 01:05.900
Is the Death Penalty Ever Moral, which I will link below in the video description.

01:05.900 --> 01:12.300
In this video, Dennis Prager argues that criminals who do sufficiently horrible things should be put to death.

01:12.300 --> 01:17.900
And he uses as an example the 2007 Cheshire, Connecticut home invasion murders,

01:17.900 --> 01:24.400
during which two criminals broke into a family's house and murdered three people in a particularly brutal manner.

01:24.400 --> 01:29.000
Dennis Prager's argument in favor of executing these men is an emotional argument,

01:29.000 --> 01:35.100
and he appeals directly to the feelings of his audience, talking about things like a sense of justice,

01:35.100 --> 01:38.400
the pain inflicted on the loved ones of those murdered,

01:38.400 --> 01:45.200
and asks whether torturers, rapists, murderers, and evil men like them deserve to keep their lives.

01:45.200 --> 01:51.000
And this sort of appeal to emotion is the main thrust of many pro-death penalty arguments.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.200
Now, whether someone can forfeit the right to life with a sufficiently horrible action or series of actions

01:57.200 --> 02:04.600
is a moral question, it's a philosophical question, and it's not a question that I'm going to be answering today.

02:04.600 --> 02:09.300
If you believe that people who commit terrible crimes, such as Dennis Prager describes,

02:09.300 --> 02:14.700
deserve in turn to lose their lives, I am not going to argue with you here.

02:14.700 --> 02:18.700
In fact, we can proceed as if that is definitely true, if you like,

02:18.700 --> 02:25.700
because regardless of how you feel about that question, it doesn't actually have anything to do with what we'll be talking about today,

02:25.700 --> 02:31.200
which is whether the death penalty, as a practical process, should actually be carried out.

02:31.200 --> 02:39.500
Is it possible for someone to lose the right to life is a different question to should society have the death penalty.

02:39.500 --> 02:43.500
And I'm going to be arguing that no matter how you feel about the former question,

02:43.500 --> 02:46.600
the answer to the latter question is no.

02:46.600 --> 02:53.200
And if you disagree with that right now, all I ask is that you stick around for the rest of the video and hear me out.

02:53.200 --> 02:59.200
Now, before we start, it is worth pointing out that many anti-death penalty arguments also appeal to emotion,

02:59.200 --> 03:02.700
and I'm going to be trying to avoid those arguments going forward.

03:02.700 --> 03:07.400
Reading or watching anti-death penalty arguments, you will often hear about, for example,

03:07.400 --> 03:13.300
how the difficulty of securing the chemicals for lethal injections means that inferior chemicals can be used,

03:13.300 --> 03:17.900
which can lead to drawn-out and painful or botched executions and so on.

03:17.900 --> 03:20.800
Now, regardless of how any individual feels about that,

03:20.800 --> 03:26.600
I don't see it being all that much of a convincing argument to someone who is currently in favor of the death penalty.

03:26.600 --> 03:30.500
Since if you think a criminal did something so bad that they should be killed,

03:30.500 --> 03:34.900
you probably don't care too much if they get hurt on the way out, right?

03:34.900 --> 03:41.300
So as much as possible today, I'm going to be trying to avoid the emotional arguments and stick to the facts.

03:41.300 --> 03:45.300
And to begin with here, let's stay with Dennis Prager's video for a while.

03:45.300 --> 03:51.300
He opens his video by asserting that he just doesn't understand people who oppose the death penalty.

03:51.300 --> 03:57.400
The gulf is unbridgeable, he says, between those of us who believe that some murderers should be put to death,

03:57.400 --> 04:00.900
and those who believe that no murderer should ever be put to death.

04:00.900 --> 04:05.500
Later, at the end of the video, he calls back to this opening paragraph, stating,

04:05.500 --> 04:11.300
But if you really do believe these people deserve to keep their lives, well, as I said at the outset,

04:11.300 --> 04:13.100
I don't understand you.

04:13.100 --> 04:18.500
Now, these two quotes illustrate perfectly the disconnect I talked about a minute ago.

04:18.500 --> 04:23.100
In the opening, Dennis Prager is talking about the process of people being put to death,

04:23.100 --> 04:29.500
but at the end, he's talking about the philosophical question of whether those people deserve to keep their lives.

04:29.500 --> 04:33.300
Two different questions, which he's treating as if they're the same.

04:33.300 --> 04:39.100
In doing this, what Dennis Prager is missing is the possibility that someone could believe that criminals

04:39.100 --> 04:43.900
who do the sorts of evil things he describes do deserve to lose their lives,

04:43.900 --> 04:48.700
but that the death penalty is, separately to that, still a bad idea.

04:49.300 --> 04:54.700
Oh! Well, the first thing is, there's crimes that the proper penalty is obviously death.

04:55.100 --> 04:58.900
Obviously. Like, and I've read a lot about serial killers, for example.

04:58.900 --> 05:01.300
I've read a lot of brutal material, you know.

05:01.300 --> 05:06.100
I was very interested in criminology and antisocial behaviour, as well as political pathology.

05:06.100 --> 05:11.100
It's like, there are guys like, I think it was John Wayne Gacy, who, yeah, you don't want to know about him.

05:11.700 --> 05:14.500
I think he begged the judge for the death penalty.

05:14.500 --> 05:17.500
He knew himself as like, there was no coming back from where he went.

05:17.500 --> 05:18.100
Hmm.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.700
So, but that's not the issue for me.

05:20.700 --> 05:24.900
The issue is, do you give the state that much power?

05:24.900 --> 05:28.100
And I would say, practically, no.

05:28.100 --> 05:30.300
I think this is a very callous way of looking.

05:30.300 --> 05:33.500
I think, in the United States, it costs $20 million to put someone to death.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.900
It's like, why?

05:34.900 --> 05:38.500
Well, because the state shouldn't just be able to do that easily.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.300
And they make mistakes. Like, a lot of mistakes.

05:41.900 --> 05:45.300
And so, maybe you just never want the state to have that much power.

05:45.300 --> 05:47.100
And I think that's a reasonable argument.

05:47.100 --> 05:48.100
Yeah, that's where...

05:48.100 --> 05:48.900
I'm not comfortable with that.

05:48.900 --> 05:52.100
That's where I'm at with it. I just don't want to give the state that power.

05:52.100 --> 05:58.500
That was Jordan Peterson there, expressing to Dave Rubin his opinion that people can deserve to be killed,

05:58.700 --> 06:02.500
but that he just doesn't trust the state to wield that much power.

06:02.500 --> 06:08.100
And this is a common anti-death penalty argument made by anti-big government folks.

06:08.100 --> 06:13.900
I picked a clip of Jordan Peterson there because he has been the narrator of multiple PragerU videos.

06:13.900 --> 06:18.300
So if Dennis Prager would like to understand an anti-death penalty argument,

06:18.300 --> 06:21.100
I suppose he could just ask Jordan Peterson.

06:21.100 --> 06:25.700
Peterson's argument also reveals a contradiction in Prager's position,

06:25.700 --> 06:29.100
and it's to do with the size and role of the government.

06:29.100 --> 06:32.900
We all know how PragerU feels about the government, right?

06:32.900 --> 06:37.500
And by the way, when does the government do a good job at fixing anything?

06:37.500 --> 06:40.900
The bigger the government, the smaller the citizen.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.300
Why is the government so bad at healthcare?

06:43.300 --> 06:45.700
The government is killing small businesses.

06:45.700 --> 06:50.300
Killing them with excessive taxes, over-regulation, and complicated compliance.

06:50.300 --> 06:55.500
The worst environmental offenders have been big, repressive, socialist governments.

06:55.700 --> 07:00.300
People in government will sell government influence for personal and political gain.

07:00.300 --> 07:03.300
It's mired in bureaucracy, and it's fraught with waste.

07:03.300 --> 07:07.300
The more a government tightens its grip, the less an economy grows.

07:07.300 --> 07:09.300
So what's the solution?

07:09.300 --> 07:11.300
Less government, not more.

07:11.300 --> 07:17.700
Yes, the government is big, bloated, slow, corrupt, mired in red tape and regulations.

07:17.700 --> 07:22.300
It's not fit to run the DMV, let alone a healthcare system.

07:22.300 --> 07:28.500
And this is the government that Dennis Prager trusts to competently decide who deserves to live and die?

07:29.100 --> 07:30.300
Why?

07:30.300 --> 07:35.300
The same state bureaucracy that his other videos describe as inefficient and corrupt

07:35.300 --> 07:39.700
is suddenly perfectly competent when it comes to sentencing the death penalty.

07:39.700 --> 07:46.100
Is having the power to end the lives of its citizens not the ultimate example of big government?

07:46.100 --> 07:48.100
Not to wonder off-topic too much here,

07:48.100 --> 07:53.500
but this is an example of how most of the time, when people complain about the size of the government,

07:53.500 --> 07:58.700
their arguments usually have very little to do with the actual size of the government.

07:58.700 --> 08:03.100
In a less silly world, if someone claimed to be against big government,

08:03.100 --> 08:07.700
we might assume that they support things like decreasing military spending,

08:07.700 --> 08:13.300
ending wars, demilitarizing the police, reducing the number of people in prison,

08:13.300 --> 08:17.100
and relevant for us here, being against the death penalty.

08:17.100 --> 08:20.300
If you don't trust the government and want it to be smaller,

08:20.300 --> 08:23.900
you probably shouldn't also want it to have an enormous army,

08:23.900 --> 08:28.500
an armed police force, and power of life and death over its citizens.

08:28.500 --> 08:33.300
Too often, though, people who complain about big government love all that stuff,

08:33.300 --> 08:40.100
and what they actually mean when they say big government is solely government healthcare and welfare programs.

08:40.100 --> 08:41.900
Anyway, to get back on track,

08:41.900 --> 08:45.300
Dennis Prager has decided to break with PragerU tradition

08:45.300 --> 08:51.900
and now totally trusts the government to judge and implement the death penalty fairly and accurately.

08:51.900 --> 08:57.700
He says the number of innocent people who might be wrongly executed is infinitesimally small

08:57.700 --> 09:01.700
thanks to DNA testing and other advanced forensic tools,

09:01.700 --> 09:05.700
which make executing an innocent person virtually impossible.

09:05.700 --> 09:08.700
The chance of executing an innocent person is, of course,

09:08.700 --> 09:13.500
one of the most common and strongest arguments against the death penalty.

09:13.500 --> 09:18.100
Because, obviously, if it comes to light that someone was wrongfully imprisoned,

09:18.100 --> 09:19.900
they can be let out of prison,

09:19.900 --> 09:23.300
but if it comes to light that someone was wrongfully executed,

09:23.300 --> 09:25.300
that's it. They're dead.

09:25.300 --> 09:29.700
Dennis Prager steps around this argument by saying our modern forensic tools

09:29.700 --> 09:33.900
make it virtually impossible to execute an innocent person,

09:33.900 --> 09:35.900
but he's missing something there.

09:35.900 --> 09:38.500
He's making a rather big assumption.

09:38.500 --> 09:41.900
Now, before we get into exactly what he is missing here,

09:41.900 --> 09:45.500
let's first imagine an airtight murder case.

09:45.500 --> 09:48.700
Let's say a husband and wife are walking down the street

09:48.700 --> 09:51.700
when they're approached by a mugger armed with a gun.

09:51.700 --> 09:56.100
And in the process of robbing the couple, he shoots and kills the wife.

09:56.100 --> 10:01.100
The police are called, and based upon the description of the criminal given to the police by the husband,

10:01.100 --> 10:04.300
they pick up a suspect near the scene of the crime.

10:04.300 --> 10:08.500
When they bring the suspect to the husband, he says yes, that's him.

10:08.500 --> 10:11.100
He's the person who shot my wife.

10:11.100 --> 10:14.700
The police then arrest the suspect, and when they later question him,

10:14.700 --> 10:18.300
he admits to the crime and signs a written confession saying,

10:18.300 --> 10:21.700
yes, I did it. I'm the person who shot that woman.

10:22.300 --> 10:24.300
So, case closed, right?

10:24.300 --> 10:27.100
We have a positive identification of the murderer

10:27.100 --> 10:29.900
from a witness who was a foot away when the crime was committed,

10:29.900 --> 10:34.500
and a signed written confession from the murderer saying that they did it.

10:34.500 --> 10:37.100
Few cases get more clear-cut than that.

10:37.100 --> 10:39.500
So this case was an actual case.

10:39.500 --> 10:42.300
The crime happened in May of the year 2000.

10:42.300 --> 10:46.500
Two tourists from Georgia, that's the state, not the country,

10:46.500 --> 10:49.700
were staying at a Ramada Inn in Jacksonville, Florida.

10:49.700 --> 10:52.700
Outside of their hotel, they were approached by a criminal

10:52.700 --> 10:57.300
who, in the process of mugging them, shot and killed Mary Ann Stevens.

10:57.300 --> 11:00.900
Her husband, James Stevens, identified Brenton Butler,

11:00.900 --> 11:03.700
who was picked up nearby by the police as the killer,

11:03.700 --> 11:06.900
and Butler confessed to the murder during questioning.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.700
However, as I imagine many of you already suspect,

11:09.700 --> 11:12.500
there is more to this case than meets the eye.

11:12.500 --> 11:15.500
Firstly, the husband of the victim was mistaken

11:15.500 --> 11:17.500
in his identification of the criminal.

11:17.500 --> 11:19.300
He just got the wrong guy.

11:19.300 --> 11:20.700
And this is a thing that happens.

11:20.700 --> 11:22.500
Witnesses make mistakes,

11:22.500 --> 11:26.900
particularly witnesses who were just involved in a very traumatic experience.

11:26.900 --> 11:31.300
But why, you might wonder, did the wrong guy confess to the crime?

11:31.300 --> 11:33.900
Well, during the trial, Brenton Butler alleged

11:33.900 --> 11:37.100
that the police physically abused him into confessing.

11:37.100 --> 11:41.700
They allegedly, again, my lawyers reminding me to say,

11:41.700 --> 11:44.700
physically intimidated him and hit him several times

11:44.700 --> 11:46.700
until he confessed to the crime.

11:46.700 --> 11:49.700
This is all the subject of a very interesting documentary

11:49.700 --> 11:51.700
called Murder on a Sunday Morning,

11:51.700 --> 11:55.300
which I would highly recommend if you want to know more about this case.

11:55.300 --> 11:57.500
The film follows Butler's defense team,

11:57.500 --> 12:01.100
two public defenders called Patrick McGinnis and Ann Finnell,

12:01.100 --> 12:03.900
as they put together the case for Butler's innocence.

12:03.900 --> 12:06.700
And they rarely tear the police apart in the courtroom

12:06.700 --> 12:10.100
and expose their awful and incompetent investigation,

12:10.100 --> 12:12.100
which is very satisfying to watch.

12:12.100 --> 12:15.700
The police, for example, didn't even search Brenton Butler's house

12:15.700 --> 12:18.100
looking for the items he supposedly stole

12:18.100 --> 12:21.500
or interview his family members with regards to his whereabouts

12:21.500 --> 12:23.500
at the time of the crime.

12:23.500 --> 12:26.100
You knew you didn't have a gun.

12:26.100 --> 12:28.300
You knew you didn't have a purse.

12:28.300 --> 12:30.300
You knew you didn't have any money.

12:30.300 --> 12:33.300
You knew you didn't have a fisherman's hat, right?

12:33.300 --> 12:34.500
That's all correct.

12:34.500 --> 12:36.500
Okay.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.500
Did you ask Brent,

12:38.500 --> 12:40.500
can I go search your house, your room?

12:40.500 --> 12:42.300
No, sir, I did not.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.300
Did you get a search warrant for his house?

12:44.300 --> 12:46.300
No, sir, I did not.

12:46.300 --> 12:48.300
You wanted to find a gun and a purse

12:48.300 --> 12:50.300
and bloody clothes and everything else, right?

12:50.300 --> 12:52.300
Yes, sir, it would have been nice.

12:52.300 --> 12:55.300
So why not get a search warrant?

12:55.300 --> 12:57.300
Well, we just didn't get a search warrant.

12:57.300 --> 12:59.300
And it's not that hard to imagine

12:59.300 --> 13:02.300
what allegedly happened here.

13:02.300 --> 13:05.300
A tourist was shot and killed outside a hotel.

13:05.300 --> 13:09.300
That is not a great headline for attracting more tourists to your town.

13:09.300 --> 13:11.300
So there's a lot of pressure on the police

13:11.300 --> 13:14.300
to solve that particular crime very quickly.

13:14.300 --> 13:17.300
And here you have an eyewitness who has already identified someone

13:17.300 --> 13:20.300
in your custody who they say did the crime.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.300
And that someone is a teenager

13:22.300 --> 13:25.300
who you just need to get to sign a piece of paper

13:25.300 --> 13:27.300
to put this case away quickly.

13:27.300 --> 13:30.300
So you make him sign the paper.

13:30.300 --> 13:32.300
Allegedly.

13:32.300 --> 13:34.300
And you don't go around investigating other things

13:34.300 --> 13:37.300
that you know will make the case against him weaker.

13:37.300 --> 13:39.300
So you don't search his house for the stolen items

13:39.300 --> 13:41.300
that you know aren't there.

13:41.300 --> 13:43.300
You don't interview potential alibis

13:43.300 --> 13:45.300
who could get him off the hook.

13:45.300 --> 13:47.300
You just pin everything on the witness ID

13:47.300 --> 13:49.300
and the confession and hope that that's enough

13:49.300 --> 13:51.300
to get the case across the line.

13:51.300 --> 13:54.300
So you might ask why I'm talking about this particular case

13:54.300 --> 13:56.300
in a video about the death penalty.

13:56.300 --> 13:59.300
Butler was too young to be given the death penalty anyway,

13:59.300 --> 14:01.300
even if he was found guilty,

14:01.300 --> 14:03.300
so that wouldn't apply here.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.300
And even if he was found guilty,

14:05.300 --> 14:07.300
the real killer was later caught

14:07.300 --> 14:09.300
when someone tipped the police off to who it was.

14:09.300 --> 14:12.300
So Butler probably would have been let out anyway,

14:12.300 --> 14:14.300
even if he was wrongly convicted.

14:14.300 --> 14:16.300
But my point here is to show a case

14:16.300 --> 14:18.300
in which the criminal justice system, or part of it,

14:18.300 --> 14:20.300
in this case the police force,

14:20.300 --> 14:23.300
could have a motivation to deliberately allow

14:23.300 --> 14:25.300
an innocent person to be convicted

14:25.300 --> 14:27.300
of a crime they did not commit.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.300
This is what Dennis Prager misses

14:29.300 --> 14:31.300
when discussing investigative techniques

14:31.300 --> 14:32.300
and forensic tools.

14:32.300 --> 14:34.300
Because yes, in many cases

14:34.300 --> 14:36.300
we do have very powerful forensic tools.

14:36.300 --> 14:38.300
But you also have to be able to trust

14:38.300 --> 14:40.300
the people with those tools

14:40.300 --> 14:42.300
not to lie.

14:42.300 --> 14:46.300
And also to actually use the tools, I suppose.

14:46.300 --> 14:49.300
What Prager leaves out is the human element.

14:49.300 --> 14:51.300
The police will sometimes,

14:51.300 --> 14:53.300
for example, plant evidence.

14:53.300 --> 14:55.300
There was a case just recently in New York

14:55.300 --> 14:57.300
where an officer was caught on camera

14:57.300 --> 14:59.300
appearing to plant drugs in a car.

14:59.300 --> 15:01.300
And this is similar to a case from last year

15:01.300 --> 15:03.300
when a Florida police officer was arrested

15:03.300 --> 15:05.300
after an investigation showed he repeatedly

15:05.300 --> 15:08.300
planted meth on people during traffic stops.

15:08.300 --> 15:11.300
Police will sometimes take bribes from criminals.

15:11.300 --> 15:13.300
They will lie in court,

15:13.300 --> 15:15.300
cover up for the crimes of other officers,

15:15.300 --> 15:18.300
beat confessions out of innocent people, and so on.

15:18.300 --> 15:20.300
Even if all cops are bastards

15:20.300 --> 15:22.300
is a little too absolutist for you,

15:22.300 --> 15:24.300
you have to admit that sometimes

15:24.300 --> 15:26.300
some cops are bastards,

15:26.300 --> 15:29.300
and some judges are bastards,

15:29.300 --> 15:31.300
and some lawyers,

15:31.300 --> 15:33.300
a lot of lawyers, are bastards.

15:33.300 --> 15:37.300
Or incompetent, or lazy, or corrupt,

15:37.300 --> 15:39.300
or just apathetic.

15:39.300 --> 15:41.300
The accuracy of a particular

15:41.300 --> 15:43.300
investigative technique or forensic method

15:43.300 --> 15:45.300
is only one part of the calculation

15:45.300 --> 15:47.300
we have to do when determining odds

15:47.300 --> 15:49.300
of someone being innocent.

15:49.300 --> 15:51.300
We also have to trust the justice system

15:51.300 --> 15:53.300
not to lie, or cheat,

15:53.300 --> 15:55.300
or just have made a mistake.

15:55.300 --> 15:58.300
You can say DNA analysis of a piece of evidence

15:58.300 --> 16:00.300
is almost perfectly accurate,

16:00.300 --> 16:02.300
but it cannot tell you whether or not

16:02.300 --> 16:04.300
that piece of evidence was planted

16:04.300 --> 16:05.300
at the scene of a crime.

16:05.300 --> 16:07.300
Now I'm not saying that's necessarily

16:07.300 --> 16:09.300
going to be a very common occurrence,

16:09.300 --> 16:12.300
don't get me wrong, but it is a possibility.

16:12.300 --> 16:14.300
We have an imperfect justice system

16:14.300 --> 16:16.300
run by imperfect people.

16:16.300 --> 16:20.300
No one type of evidence is ever going to be flawless.

16:20.300 --> 16:22.300
Even video evidence.

16:22.300 --> 16:24.300
Dennis Prager in his video says

16:24.300 --> 16:26.300
opponents of capital punishment

16:26.300 --> 16:28.300
oppose the death penalty even when

16:28.300 --> 16:31.300
there is absolute proof of the murderer's guilt.

16:31.300 --> 16:33.300
If there were a video of a man

16:33.300 --> 16:34.300
burning a family alive,

16:34.300 --> 16:36.300
opponents of capital punishment

16:36.300 --> 16:38.300
would still oppose taking that man's life.

16:38.300 --> 16:40.300
Now the implication there is that

16:40.300 --> 16:42.300
a video would be absolute proof of guilt.

16:42.300 --> 16:44.300
But is it really?

16:44.300 --> 16:46.300
This is a statement that's going to be

16:46.300 --> 16:48.300
less and less true over time,

16:48.300 --> 16:50.300
and that's simply because technological

16:50.300 --> 16:52.300
advances mean that video is getting

16:52.300 --> 16:54.300
easier and easier to fake.

16:54.300 --> 16:56.300
It is getting harder to spot videos

16:56.300 --> 16:58.300
that are authentic and videos

16:58.300 --> 17:00.300
that were created in a computer.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.300
Many of you will remember this video

17:02.300 --> 17:05.300
from a few years ago of a fake Barack Obama

17:05.300 --> 17:07.300
that was created in a computer

17:07.300 --> 17:09.300
using an AI video tool.

17:09.300 --> 17:12.300
Now the more observant folks in the audience

17:12.300 --> 17:15.300
might still be able to tell this is fake,

17:15.300 --> 17:18.300
you can see something seems a little off about it, right?

17:18.300 --> 17:23.300
However, it is already eerily similar to the real thing, is it not?

17:23.300 --> 17:26.300
And before long, it's going to be very difficult indeed

17:26.300 --> 17:28.300
to tell the difference between authentic videos

17:28.300 --> 17:31.300
and fake videos like this one.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.300
And if you were led by my prompting there

17:33.300 --> 17:36.300
to believe that this is a fake video of Barack Obama,

17:36.300 --> 17:38.300
then we are already at that moment

17:38.300 --> 17:41.300
because this is not a fake video of Barack Obama.

17:41.300 --> 17:43.300
This is a real video of Barack Obama.

17:43.300 --> 17:47.300
I just put a real video under the headline describing the fake one.

17:47.300 --> 17:50.300
Anyway, me being a smart-ass aside,

17:50.300 --> 17:52.300
while faked videos aren't a huge problem

17:52.300 --> 17:54.300
for the legal system right now,

17:54.300 --> 17:58.300
as the technology gets both more advanced and easier to use,

17:58.300 --> 18:01.300
it very well could be a problem in the future.

18:01.300 --> 18:04.300
And even with a non-fake video,

18:04.300 --> 18:07.300
we can still imagine perfectly possible scenarios

18:07.300 --> 18:09.300
in which executing a man based on video evidence

18:09.300 --> 18:13.300
of him committing a crime would be a bad idea.

18:13.300 --> 18:16.300
What if the man had off-screen accomplices in his crime?

18:16.300 --> 18:20.300
If you kill him, you've got less of a chance of finding them, right?

18:20.300 --> 18:23.300
What if the person doing the crime was someone who was coerced

18:23.300 --> 18:26.300
or forced into it by some other person?

18:26.300 --> 18:28.300
What if someone threatened to murder his family

18:28.300 --> 18:31.300
unless he did the horrible thing on their behalf?

18:31.300 --> 18:34.300
Again, as with a bribed judge or planted evidence,

18:34.300 --> 18:37.300
I'm not saying that these things would be happening every day,

18:37.300 --> 18:39.300
just that it is a possibility.

18:39.300 --> 18:43.300
And no matter how unlikely, if you execute enough people,

18:43.300 --> 18:45.300
you will eventually kill an innocent person.

18:45.300 --> 18:48.300
So the pro-death penalty argument has to be

18:48.300 --> 18:53.300
that killing the occasional innocent person is an acceptable risk,

18:53.300 --> 18:55.300
because that risk is outweighed by the positives

18:55.300 --> 18:58.300
that come from having the death penalty.

18:58.300 --> 19:02.300
So, what are the positives to having the death penalty?

19:02.300 --> 19:05.300
One you will often see proposed is cost.

19:05.300 --> 19:09.300
Why should the taxpayer pay to feed and clothe some horrible murderer

19:09.300 --> 19:12.300
who might live for another however many decades, right?

19:12.300 --> 19:16.300
It would be better and cheaper to just kill them outright.

19:16.300 --> 19:19.300
Well, in practice, this isn't actually true.

19:19.300 --> 19:21.300
In the United States, for instance,

19:21.300 --> 19:25.300
it is vastly more expensive to execute people than to imprison them for life.

19:25.300 --> 19:30.300
Executing someone is a very complicated and slow legal process.

19:30.300 --> 19:34.300
Some inmates spend more than 20 years on death row before being executed.

19:34.300 --> 19:38.300
It's so slow because there are various stages of review and appeal

19:38.300 --> 19:41.300
before the death penalty can actually be carried out.

19:41.300 --> 19:44.300
Now, the obvious counterargument to this is to say,

19:44.300 --> 19:47.300
well, what if we just sped that process up a little?

19:47.300 --> 19:51.300
If we just executed people right after they were found guilty,

19:51.300 --> 19:53.300
that massive expense would not exist, right?

19:53.300 --> 19:56.300
And execution would be the cheaper option.

19:56.300 --> 19:59.300
And the counterargument to this counterargument is that

19:59.300 --> 20:03.300
the slow appeal and review process exists for a very good reason.

20:03.300 --> 20:06.300
If you thought my proposed scenarios a minute ago

20:06.300 --> 20:09.300
as to how an innocent person could end up being executed

20:09.300 --> 20:12.300
sounded like ridiculous million-to-one shots,

20:12.300 --> 20:16.300
then what you need is a real-life example.

20:16.300 --> 20:20.300
So let's talk about the rather infamous case of Timothy Evans,

20:20.300 --> 20:23.300
something I imagine some of you will know about already.

20:23.300 --> 20:28.300
So, Timothy Evans was a Welshman who lived in London in 1949

20:28.300 --> 20:30.300
with his wife and child.

20:30.300 --> 20:33.300
And in November of 1949, he went to the police

20:33.300 --> 20:37.300
and informed them that his wife, Beryl Evans, had died.

20:37.300 --> 20:40.300
And the story he told police was that his wife was pregnant,

20:40.300 --> 20:44.300
but since the couple thought they could not support another child,

20:44.300 --> 20:47.300
they had taken up the proposal of their downstairs neighbor,

20:47.300 --> 20:51.300
John Christie, who had offered to perform an abortion.

20:51.300 --> 20:53.300
Christie apparently botched the abortion

20:53.300 --> 20:55.300
and accidentally killed Beryl Evans.

20:55.300 --> 20:58.300
Christie then persuaded Timothy Evans

20:58.300 --> 21:00.300
to go and stay with relatives in Wales

21:00.300 --> 21:02.300
while he disposed of Beryl Evans' body

21:02.300 --> 21:06.300
and made arrangements for a couple to look after their daughter.

21:06.300 --> 21:08.300
So, Timothy Evans went to Wales,

21:08.300 --> 21:11.300
only to a few weeks later decide to go to the police

21:11.300 --> 21:14.300
and tell them what had happened.

21:14.300 --> 21:17.300
Only, when he first told the story to the police,

21:17.300 --> 21:19.300
he left Christie out of it,

21:19.300 --> 21:22.300
saying that he himself had been the one to dispose of his wife's body

21:22.300 --> 21:26.300
and the one who arranged for his daughter to be looked after.

21:26.300 --> 21:29.300
In response to this account, the police searched the place

21:29.300 --> 21:31.300
where Evans said he had disposed of the body,

21:31.300 --> 21:34.300
which was in a sewer drain, only to find there was no body there

21:34.300 --> 21:36.300
and that lifting the drain cover

21:36.300 --> 21:39.300
would have been physically impossible for a single man.

21:39.300 --> 21:42.300
So Evans, when re-questioned, changed his story

21:42.300 --> 21:44.300
and this time included Christie,

21:44.300 --> 21:47.300
stating that he had previously been trying to protect Christie

21:47.300 --> 21:49.300
by not mentioning him.

21:49.300 --> 21:52.300
So Evans told the police that Christie was the one who hid the body

21:52.300 --> 21:55.300
and arranged for his daughter to be looked after.

21:55.300 --> 21:57.300
In response to this new account,

21:57.300 --> 22:00.300
police searched the building where both Evans and Christie lived

22:00.300 --> 22:03.300
and discovered in the wash house in the back garden

22:03.300 --> 22:05.300
the bodies of not just Beryl Evans,

22:05.300 --> 22:08.300
but also her daughter with Timothy Evans.

22:08.300 --> 22:10.300
Both had been strangled to death.

22:10.300 --> 22:13.300
When he was informed that his wife and daughter had been strangled,

22:13.300 --> 22:17.300
Timothy Evans confessed to the crime.

22:17.300 --> 22:19.300
Or... did he?

22:19.300 --> 22:22.300
His questioning by the police produced a confession,

22:22.300 --> 22:25.300
though he later stated in court that this confession was made

22:25.300 --> 22:28.300
because he feared being subjected to violence by the police.

22:28.300 --> 22:31.300
So, from the perspective of the police here,

22:31.300 --> 22:33.300
a man came in and said his wife was dead

22:33.300 --> 22:37.300
and then he told them multiple contradictory accounts of how it happened.

22:37.300 --> 22:40.300
Most of the time, he is going to be the killer.

22:40.300 --> 22:43.300
However, Timothy Evans was not the killer.

22:43.300 --> 22:46.300
His wife and daughter were killed by John Christie.

22:46.300 --> 22:49.300
There was no botched abortion or arranging for the daughter

22:49.300 --> 22:51.300
to be sent elsewhere to be looked after.

22:51.300 --> 22:55.300
John Christie murdered them both because he was a serial killer.

22:55.300 --> 22:59.300
The things he told Timothy Evans about what had happened were lies.

22:59.300 --> 23:05.300
However, John Christie was also a former War Reserve police officer.

23:05.300 --> 23:10.300
This, coupled with the police clearly believing that Timothy Evans was obviously the killer,

23:10.300 --> 23:14.300
led them to carry out an incredibly lazy investigation.

23:14.300 --> 23:16.300
They know it's Timothy Evans,

23:16.300 --> 23:20.300
so there's no need to investigate the crime scene all that well,

23:20.300 --> 23:25.300
and we can take John Christie at his word since he used to be a copper just like us.

23:25.300 --> 23:28.300
And if Timothy Evans won't confess to the crime,

23:28.300 --> 23:32.300
we can just persuade him to confess to the crime,

23:32.300 --> 23:34.300
if you know what I mean.

23:34.300 --> 23:35.300
Wink.

23:35.300 --> 23:40.300
This led the police to missing that John Christie had bodies of his prior victims

23:40.300 --> 23:44.300
buried in shallow graves in his back garden,

23:44.300 --> 23:48.300
so shallow that a dog was able to dig up one of the skulls,

23:48.300 --> 23:52.300
and a thigh bone was later apparently found propping up his fence.

23:52.300 --> 23:56.300
He also had multiple criminal convictions for theft and assault,

23:56.300 --> 23:59.300
including attacking a woman with a cricket bat,

23:59.300 --> 24:02.300
which was seemingly overlooked by the police.

24:02.300 --> 24:05.300
Because of the police's rubbish investigation

24:05.300 --> 24:08.300
and Timothy Evans' temporary confession to the crime,

24:08.300 --> 24:10.300
however that came about,

24:10.300 --> 24:14.300
Evans was put on trial for murder on the 11th of January 1950,

24:14.300 --> 24:16.300
and was found guilty.

24:16.300 --> 24:20.300
Executed on the 9th of March, less than three months later.

24:20.300 --> 24:23.300
So the state executed an innocent man.

24:23.300 --> 24:27.300
And this sounds like a ridiculous million-to-one shot, right?

24:27.300 --> 24:29.300
What if it wasn't the husband,

24:29.300 --> 24:33.300
and the downstairs neighbor is actually a scheming serial killer?

24:33.300 --> 24:38.300
It sounds like paranoid fiction, and it is incredibly unlikely.

24:38.300 --> 24:40.300
But things like this do happen,

24:40.300 --> 24:44.300
and there are multiple things we should take into account regarding this case.

24:44.300 --> 24:50.300
Firstly, it is a very good example of why it is an incredibly bad idea to execute people quickly.

24:50.300 --> 24:56.300
All those slow reviews and appeals exist to catch exactly these sorts of mistakes.

24:56.300 --> 25:00.300
Christie was caught three years later in 1953, for instance,

25:00.300 --> 25:04.300
at which point, if Timothy Evans had not already been executed,

25:04.300 --> 25:06.300
he could have been let out of prison.

25:06.300 --> 25:10.300
So yes, the justice system could kill people faster,

25:10.300 --> 25:13.300
but if you do that, you're going to make more mistakes.

25:13.300 --> 25:16.300
So you have to be okay with killing more innocent people,

25:16.300 --> 25:19.300
in order to make the process cheaper, I guess.

25:19.300 --> 25:24.300
So you're basically killing innocent people for money at that point,

25:24.300 --> 25:28.300
which sounds like the opposite of something the justice system should be doing.

25:28.300 --> 25:33.300
Next up, killing an innocent person is only half the crime here.

25:33.300 --> 25:35.300
Because the justice system got the wrong guy,

25:35.300 --> 25:37.300
the actual killer was still out there,

25:37.300 --> 25:41.300
and John Christie killed four more people before he was caught.

25:42.300 --> 25:44.300
Timothy Evans could have been a witness

25:44.300 --> 25:48.300
that helped to bring Christie to justice years earlier than he was.

25:48.300 --> 25:53.300
Instead, he was wrongfully executed, and Christie went on to kill again.

25:53.300 --> 25:56.300
So this is my answer to the cost of the death penalty.

25:56.300 --> 25:59.300
You can do it quick, cheap, and bad,

25:59.300 --> 26:02.300
or you can do it slow and expensive.

26:02.300 --> 26:07.300
The question is how many innocent people you're willing to risk accidentally killing.

26:07.300 --> 26:10.300
According to the Death Penalty Information Center,

26:10.300 --> 26:12.300
in the United States, for instance,

26:12.300 --> 26:15.300
more than 160 people on death row

26:15.300 --> 26:19.300
were later found to be wrongfully convicted and were exonerated.

26:19.300 --> 26:21.300
And they're just the ones who have been found.

26:21.300 --> 26:24.300
Remember, the actual number of wrongfully convicted people

26:24.300 --> 26:26.300
is likely much higher than that.

26:26.300 --> 26:29.300
And let's look at some of the reasons for those exonerations.

26:29.300 --> 26:32.300
False or misleading forensic evidence,

26:32.300 --> 26:36.300
official misconduct, perjury or false accusation,

26:36.300 --> 26:40.300
inadequate legal defense, mistaken witness identification,

26:40.300 --> 26:46.300
these supposedly very unlikely scenarios happen much more often than we might like to admit.

26:46.300 --> 26:52.300
Anyway, the next pro-death penalty argument I want to take a look at is deterrence.

26:52.300 --> 26:55.300
The death penalty is worth its various downsides.

26:55.300 --> 26:57.300
It's argued because it deters crime.

26:57.300 --> 27:02.300
Now, the big problem with this argument is that there isn't any evidence for it.

27:02.300 --> 27:07.300
For instance, comparing between states within the US that have the death penalty and those that don't,

27:07.300 --> 27:13.300
there is no positive correlation between having the death penalty and a lowered rate of crime.

27:13.300 --> 27:16.300
And for countries that have abolished the death penalty,

27:16.300 --> 27:20.300
there is no evidence that doing so caused the crime rate to rise.

27:20.300 --> 27:24.300
So that's it for this argument, right? There's no evidence.

27:24.300 --> 27:27.300
However, leaving things there would be a bit of a mistake.

27:27.300 --> 27:33.300
There is a relatively good death penalty argument to be made here with regard to deterrence.

27:33.300 --> 27:35.300
And I compiled this from various sources,

27:35.300 --> 27:41.300
but primarily from the pro-death penalty arguments contained within the book debating the death penalty.

27:41.300 --> 27:45.300
So let's do the relatively good death penalty argument.

27:45.300 --> 27:48.300
And if I appeared on camera during these videos,

27:48.300 --> 27:54.300
this is the point where I'd burst through the door wearing a hat and a fake mustache and proceed to argue with myself in character.

27:55.300 --> 27:59.300
But since I'm not much of an actor, we'll all just have to use our imaginations.

27:59.300 --> 28:01.300
So, the argument goes like this.

28:01.300 --> 28:05.300
The death penalty deters crime, to which the response is,

28:05.300 --> 28:08.300
no it doesn't, there's no evidence for that.

28:08.300 --> 28:16.300
But, we respond, the death penalty would deter crime, it would, had it not been so weakened.

28:16.300 --> 28:20.300
There's no evidence of deterrence under our current system, sure,

28:20.300 --> 28:25.300
but under our current system, only very small amounts of crimes are eligible for the death penalty,

28:25.300 --> 28:30.300
only a very small number of those cases actually result in a death penalty sentence,

28:30.300 --> 28:32.300
many of those are later overturned,

28:32.300 --> 28:36.300
and the legal process between arrest and execution takes years.

28:36.300 --> 28:39.300
Of course, that system isn't deterring anyone,

28:39.300 --> 28:47.300
because the odds of getting executed are too low, it happens too slowly, it's too abstract to be a good deterrent.

28:47.300 --> 28:55.300
If we want the death penalty to discourage anyone, it needs to be used more often, faster, and for a wider variety of crimes.

28:55.300 --> 28:59.300
For instance, we'll execute someone for killing one other person in a robbery,

28:59.300 --> 29:02.300
but not a banker who defrauds thousands of people,

29:02.300 --> 29:06.300
or a politician who starts a war that kills hundreds of thousands.

29:06.300 --> 29:11.300
Now, the obvious response to increased use of the death penalty, as we talked about just previously,

29:11.300 --> 29:14.300
is that you're gonna execute more innocent people,

29:14.300 --> 29:16.300
and to that, we say,

29:16.300 --> 29:19.300
the state accidentally kills innocent people all the time.

29:19.300 --> 29:26.300
If we build a new fire station, then on a long enough timescale, someone is eventually gonna be hit by one of its fire trucks and killed.

29:26.300 --> 29:31.300
If we build a new motorway between two cities, there will inevitably be a fatal traffic accident on it.

29:31.300 --> 29:35.300
The innocent people killed by the death penalty are no different,

29:35.300 --> 29:40.300
to which the response is that those things provide useful societal benefits.

29:40.300 --> 29:44.300
We accept the downsides because they're outweighed by the positives,

29:44.300 --> 29:47.300
to which we say, so will the death penalty.

29:47.300 --> 29:54.300
With all the crime, it will definitely deter if only you loosen up a little and start using it appropriately,

29:54.300 --> 29:56.300
by which we mean a lot.

29:56.300 --> 30:03.300
I like this argument because it's at least honest about the fact that the death penalty will kill innocent people,

30:03.300 --> 30:06.300
and I find the bit about the bankers particularly persuasive.

30:07.300 --> 30:12.300
Unfortunately, it falls apart upon examination, so here's why I don't agree with it.

30:12.300 --> 30:17.300
The more substantial response to the accidental societal deaths argument is that,

30:17.300 --> 30:21.300
with regards to the potential benefits of the death penalty,

30:21.300 --> 30:25.300
the burden of proof is on the people arguing for it.

30:25.300 --> 30:31.300
It's easy to prove that having a fire department, for instance, is a good idea with obvious societal benefits.

30:31.300 --> 30:35.300
If we want the death penalty to be seen in the same way, it's on us to prove it.

30:35.300 --> 30:39.300
With something so final as the state killing a person,

30:39.300 --> 30:44.300
you can't just say it might have benefits without the evidence to back that up.

30:44.300 --> 30:50.300
And faced with a lack of evidence, we may as well take the course of action that is later reversible,

30:50.300 --> 30:52.300
rather than the one that is permanent.

30:52.300 --> 30:57.300
We can let innocent people out of prison, but we can't raise the dead.

30:57.300 --> 31:03.300
Additionally, another big problem with the deterrence argument is that it assumes a lucid murderer.

31:03.300 --> 31:10.300
The sort of calculating criminals you see killing for personal profits in shows like Columbo and so on.

31:10.300 --> 31:14.300
In reality, though, not many would-be killers are sitting in front of a spreadsheet

31:14.300 --> 31:18.300
working out the odds of getting caught and the punishment they're likely to face

31:18.300 --> 31:21.300
versus the benefits of doing a murder.

31:21.300 --> 31:25.300
Hitmen, maybe, but they're not actually all that common.

31:25.300 --> 31:31.300
Most murders are unplanned and carried out impulsively without thought for the future.

31:31.300 --> 31:36.300
And for many of the worst criminals, say mass killers, serial killers and the likes,

31:36.300 --> 31:40.300
they either fully expect to be killed by the police or themselves,

31:40.300 --> 31:45.300
or they think they'll never be caught, or they don't care about being caught.

31:45.300 --> 31:48.300
No legal punishment is going to deter those people.

31:48.300 --> 31:52.300
If we do assume a lucid calculating criminal, though,

31:52.300 --> 31:54.300
the sort of criminal who would think,

31:54.300 --> 31:58.300
well, I don't mind doing life in prison, but I really don't want the death penalty,

31:58.300 --> 32:04.300
then we run into a contradiction when we propose expanding the death penalty to crimes other than murder.

32:04.300 --> 32:07.300
And it's a rather dangerous contradiction.

32:07.300 --> 32:12.300
You see, the problem is, if we make the penalty for robbery, say, the same as for murder,

32:12.300 --> 32:15.300
then our calculating criminal who just rubbed someone will think,

32:15.300 --> 32:21.300
well, since the punishment is the same either way, I may as well just murder them now

32:21.300 --> 32:27.300
because I have less chance of getting caught if the witness can't identify me on account of being dead.

32:27.300 --> 32:32.300
Expanding the death penalty to other crimes will turn a lot of those crimes into murders,

32:32.300 --> 32:35.300
assuming our calculating criminals exist anyway.

32:35.300 --> 32:38.300
Hardly anyone thinks like this, of course,

32:38.300 --> 32:44.300
but the fact that hardly anyone thinks like this is why the deterrence argument doesn't really work.

32:44.300 --> 32:51.300
Most murderers aren't thinking logically about the future, because most murderers aren't thinking logically.

32:51.300 --> 32:54.300
If they were, they probably wouldn't be murdering someone.

32:54.300 --> 33:00.300
There is also a problem with the idea of expanding the death penalty to financial and corporate crimes,

33:00.300 --> 33:02.300
as nice as that might sound.

33:02.300 --> 33:04.300
And the problem is wealth inequality.

33:04.300 --> 33:07.300
Money can buy better legal representation.

33:07.300 --> 33:10.300
You can say this or that crime should have the death penalty,

33:10.300 --> 33:15.300
but it's still the poor who are gonna be the ones receiving the majority of the death penalties.

33:15.300 --> 33:19.300
Remedying that problem would take doing away with economic inequality,

33:19.300 --> 33:25.300
which funnily enough would definitely do a lot more to lower the crime rate than any possible punishment would do.

33:25.300 --> 33:30.300
More equal societies have a lower crime rate, after all.

33:30.300 --> 33:33.300
Anyway, to loop back to Dennis Prager here,

33:33.300 --> 33:38.300
he doesn't make the cost argument in his video, nor does he make the deterrence argument,

33:38.300 --> 33:41.300
and that is a smart decision on his part.

33:41.300 --> 33:46.300
Both of those arguments are easily countered with evidence, after all.

33:46.300 --> 33:51.300
The death penalty is very expensive, and there is no evidence of it deterring crime.

33:51.300 --> 33:55.300
These are things that you can show with, like, statistics.

33:55.300 --> 34:03.300
So Dennis Prager wisely pins his whole case for the death penalty on the one argument which is difficult to disprove with statistics,

34:03.300 --> 34:06.300
which is, how do you feel about it?

34:06.300 --> 34:13.300
When someone does something terrible, don't you feel like they should face some equally terrible consequence?

34:13.300 --> 34:17.300
And what about the pain inflicted on the loved ones of those murdered?

34:17.300 --> 34:22.300
For most people, their suffering is immeasurably increased,

34:22.300 --> 34:25.300
knowing that the person who murdered their family member or friend,

34:25.300 --> 34:33.300
and who in many cases inflicted unimaginable terror, is alive and being cared for.

34:33.300 --> 34:37.300
Of course, putting the murderer to death doesn't bring back their loved one,

34:37.300 --> 34:40.300
but it sure does provide some sense of justice.

34:40.300 --> 34:45.300
So, this is the other argument for the death penalty, the closure argument.

34:45.300 --> 34:52.300
The death penalty provides the victim's loved ones with a sense of justice, or closure, or healing, or so on.

34:52.300 --> 34:54.300
But is this actually true?

34:54.300 --> 34:57.300
Now, you can't speak for every victim's family and friends, of course.

34:57.300 --> 34:59.300
Different people are going to react differently.

34:59.300 --> 35:06.300
Dennis Prager uses the example of one man who wants the death penalty for the men who killed his family members, for instance.

35:06.300 --> 35:12.300
On the other hand, it is trivial to find examples of murder victims' families who oppose the death penalty.

35:12.300 --> 35:18.300
For instance, the organization Murder Victims' Families for Human Rights, who...

35:18.300 --> 35:20.300
Well, you know, you get it from the title, I imagine.

35:20.300 --> 35:24.300
They're family members of murder victims who oppose the death penalty.

35:24.300 --> 35:26.300
And that organization's website says,

35:27.300 --> 35:29.300
Having all suffered a tragic loss,

35:29.300 --> 35:33.300
murder victims' families for human rights members have come in different ways and times

35:33.300 --> 35:37.300
to the understanding that the death penalty does not help us heal,

35:37.300 --> 35:40.300
and is not the way to pursue justice for victims.

35:40.300 --> 35:45.300
The death penalty, as a sentence, does not provide closure.

35:45.300 --> 35:49.300
It's not carried out for a very long time, for a start.

35:49.300 --> 35:53.300
Someone sentenced today might not be killed until 2040.

35:53.300 --> 35:58.300
That's decades of them being alive and cared for, as Dennis Prager put it.

35:58.300 --> 36:01.300
And rather than providing a sense of finality,

36:01.300 --> 36:06.300
it is easier to imagine a death penalty sentence giving a sense of uncertainty.

36:06.300 --> 36:10.300
Because it isn't a certain thing that the murderer will be executed.

36:10.300 --> 36:14.300
Many sentences are later changed to life imprisonment, after all.

36:14.300 --> 36:21.300
And remember that lengthy review and appeal process where the case is reexamined and often retried?

36:21.300 --> 36:25.300
How would you imagine loved ones of murder victims are gonna feel about that?

36:25.300 --> 36:31.300
Particularly if they were witnesses to the crime, which means they're gonna have to be directly involved in that whole process.

36:31.300 --> 36:35.300
Having all the details brought up over and over again and so on.

36:35.300 --> 36:41.300
With a sentence of life in prison, the families of victims know where they're at immediately.

36:41.300 --> 36:44.300
But with the death penalty, they really don't.

36:44.300 --> 36:48.300
They're in for years of wondering what's actually going to happen.

36:48.300 --> 36:53.300
Rather than providing a sense of closure, the death penalty actually delays that closure.

36:53.300 --> 36:57.300
And I'd like to briefly mention a study just to back this up somewhat.

36:57.300 --> 37:04.300
Assessing the impact of the ultimate penal sanction on homicide survivors, a two-state comparison.

37:04.300 --> 37:07.300
And let's briefly read the summary of that study.

37:07.300 --> 37:11.300
Numerous studies have examined the psychological...

37:13.300 --> 37:17.300
...ramifications that result from the murder of a loved one.

37:17.300 --> 37:25.300
Except for the death penalty, however, sparse attention has been paid to the impact of the murderous sentence on homicide survivors' well-being.

37:25.300 --> 37:31.300
Given the steadfastness of the public's opinion that the death penalty brings satisfaction and closure to survivors,

37:31.300 --> 37:39.300
it is surprising that there has been no systematic inquiry directly with survivors about whether obtaining the ultimate punishment affects their healing.

37:39.300 --> 37:51.300
This study used in-person interviews with a randomly selected sample of survivors from four time periods to examine the totality of the ultimate penal sanction process and its longitudinal impact on their lives.

37:51.300 --> 38:03.300
Moreover, it assessed the differential effect of two types of UPS by comparing survivors' experiences in Texas, a death penalty state, and Minnesota, a life without the possibility of parole state.

38:03.300 --> 38:12.300
Comparing states highlights differences primarily during the post-conviction stage, specifically with respect to the appeals process and in regard to survivor well-being.

38:12.300 --> 38:19.300
In Minnesota, survivors of adjudicated cases showed higher levels of physical, psychological, and behavioral health.

38:19.300 --> 38:23.300
This study's findings have implications for trial strategy and policy development.

38:23.300 --> 38:31.300
So, at least in the case of this study, it looks like the death penalty is not providing the sense of closure that people might expect it to.

38:31.300 --> 38:35.300
And I'll post a link to this below in case anyone wants to read it in more detail.

38:35.300 --> 38:42.300
Dennis Prager ends his video by saying that he does not understand the other side of the death penalty argument,

38:42.300 --> 38:45.300
which, you know, should have gone without saying, really.

38:45.300 --> 38:50.300
But I'd like to end today by saying that I do understand the pro-death penalty argument.

38:50.300 --> 38:58.300
I understand the desire for some sense of ultimate justice with regards to the sorts of awful murderers we've been talking about.

38:58.300 --> 39:01.300
I live in England, where we do not have the death penalty.

39:01.300 --> 39:11.300
But I imagine that if someone murdered my family or friends, I would, in that moment, want that person to suffer every possible punishment, up to and including the death penalty.

39:11.300 --> 39:14.300
But that's just what I would personally want in the moment.

39:14.300 --> 39:19.300
Nothing would have changed with regards to anything else we've been talking about today.

39:20.300 --> 39:29.300
Instituting the death penalty because I want it in the one case would set the precedent for the state to execute people for other reasons that I might not agree with.

39:29.300 --> 39:35.300
And it would reopen the door to the possibility of innocent people being wrongfully executed.

39:35.300 --> 39:41.300
And that is ultimately a worse crime than me, as an individual, not getting what I want.

39:42.300 --> 39:44.300
Thanks a lot for watching, folks.

39:44.300 --> 39:46.300
What do you think about the death penalty?

39:46.300 --> 39:54.300

Thanks, as always, to my backers over on Patreon, some of whom should be scrolling by right now.

40:00.300 --> 40:06.300
Thanks to them not only for their financial support, but also for all of their very useful feedback.
