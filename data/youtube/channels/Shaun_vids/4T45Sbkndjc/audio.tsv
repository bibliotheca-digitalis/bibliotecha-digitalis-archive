0	1180	Hello, everyone.
1180	4880	This is a video responding to a recent PragerU video titled,
4880	6280	The Charlottesville Lie.
6280	10840	That video is discussing the media's response to President Trump's controversial comments
10840	14740	in the wake of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville back in 2017.
14740	18260	And the description to that video on the PragerU website reads,
18260	23260	"...did President Trump call neo-Nazis very fine people during a famous press conference
23260	26360	following the Charlottesville riots of 2017?
26360	29020	The major media reported that he did.
29140	31140	But what if their reporting is wrong?
31680	35520	Worse, what if their reporting is wrong, and they know it's wrong?
35520	38860	A straight exploration of the facts should reveal the truth."
38860	44140	That's what CNN political analyst Steve Cortez does in this critically important video.
44860	49200	As always, I would suggest you watch that video first. It is only five minutes long.
49200	53380	Also, I'm not going to be going through the events of the Unite the Right rally in detail here,
53380	55620	as I've already done that in my video titled,
55620	57980	Charlottesville, the true alt-right.
57980	61500	So if you need a refresher, I'd advise you also go and watch that first.
61500	65200	It's only, uh, fifty-three minutes long, right?
65700	70620	So then, PragerU's main argument is that the mainstream media lied about Trump's comments
70620	75700	with regards to the Unite the Right rally by omitting that he distinguished between the neo-Nazis
75700	81800	and white supremacists at the rally, and those apparently there to merely protest the removal of Confederate statues.
82160	84420	By apparently omitting this information,
84460	90680	various media outlets were then free to allegedly claim that Trump was calling the Nazis fine people.
90680	96860	In typical PragerU fashion, however, they provide absolutely no evidence of their main claim.
96860	101780	They just tell you that it's true, and expect you to take their word on the matter.
101780	106160	Now, instead of citing any actual news articles to back up their claims,
106160	111220	they instead show this cartoon newspaper that they made up, remember,
111260	112060	which says,
115760	117680	And then they argue with that.
117680	122860	So we have to ask, uh, why no actual non-cartoon sources here?
122860	127860	They elsewhere cite an actual New York Times article when attempting to back up a different claim,
127860	132800	so I don't believe that this refusal to cite articles as evidence is a stylistic choice.
132800	136640	There must be another reason why they don't want to show you the evidence.
136680	139560	Now, PragerU don't cite any specific articles,
139560	145720	but they do mention several news networks and newspapers as being the ones that supposedly spread the lie.
145720	147440	Uh, here, where they say,
158560	160720	So we have our list of culprits here.
160720	166920	These are the vile organizations that neglected to mention Trump differentiated between the groups of protesters,
166920	169560	and that he condemned the Nazis.
169560	172560	How allegedly manipulative of them.
172560	175080	Only, here's the thing.
175080	180000	And you had people, and I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists,
180000	182320	because they should be condemned totally.
182320	188320	But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists, okay?
188400	194000	That's ABC News there, reposting the clip of Trump condemning neo-Nazis to their Twitter feed,
194000	196400	and linking to a story in which they say,
212040	214840	So, ABC didn't spread the lie there.
214880	217680	They spread Trump's condemnation of neo-Nazis,
217680	222960	and made clear that Trump thought some people were there simply to protest the removal of the statue.
222960	225280	So, PragerU got that one wrong.
225280	227160	Uh, how about CBS?
227160	229920	I've condemned neo-Nazis.
229920	232800	I've condemned many different groups,
232800	236440	but not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me.
236440	240760	That's CBS showing a clip of Trump condemning neo-Nazis above a news story,
240760	245880	which also contains quotes showing that Trump distinguished between the groups of protesters.
245880	249000	NBC put out an article that quotes Trump as saying,
271720	273920	Next up, NPR.
273920	280000	He ultimately did criticize as neo-Nazis and Klansmen and white supremacists,
280000	284600	but he said that description didn't fit everyone who was taking part in these demonstrations.
284600	288280	Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me.
288280	292080	Not all of those people were white supremacists, by any stretch.
292080	298760	He went on to say that some of the demonstrators were there to protest the taking down of a statue of Robert E. Lee.
299000	305320	That's a clip of NPR taken from the same day as Trump's comments there, so that's them off the hook as well.
305320	307720	Next up is the New York Times.
307720	309320	They put out an article that says,
322760	327560	There's one more thing to be said about this singling out of the New York Times by PragerU here.
327560	330040	Elsewhere in the video, they say the following,
341560	342920	And then they quote someone who says,
345800	350360	Now, the thing to note here is that PragerU cite the New York Times as their only evidence
350360	353160	that some good people were at the Unite the Right rally,
353160	358040	then later criticized the New York Times for lying about the Unite the Right rally.
358040	363400	I mean, if the New York Times were apparently so dedicated to pushing this anti-Trump lie,
363400	366360	why would they release an article that contradicts it?
366360	369800	You know, can we trust the New York Times or not, PragerU?
370360	374280	Just when they agree with what you're saying, I guess. Probably that, yeah.
375320	377240	Lastly, the Washington Post.
383160	395160	Every single news organization that PragerU names as having participated in the so-called
395160	399800	Charlottesville lie reported exactly what PragerU claims they didn't.
400360	404760	They all made clear in their reporting following the press conference that Trump
404760	407720	distinguished between the groups of protesters.
407720	411160	PragerU is lying about these news organizations.
411160	414920	They all reported exactly what Donald Trump said,
414920	418760	and I will leave links to these news stories below if you'd like to check them out.
418760	420360	So, what happened here, then?
420360	425400	Well, the media did criticize Trump for his fine people on both sides' statements,
425400	428760	but this was not because they were lying about what he said.
428760	433080	They actually criticized Trump for two different, valid reasons.
433080	436360	The first reason was because of his previous comments on the matter,
436360	439000	which PragerU omit from their narrative here.
439000	443000	They present an incorrect version of the timeline of events.
443000	446760	You see, the press conference at which President Trump made those statements was not,
446760	451080	as PragerU implied, the first time that Trump addressed violence at the rally.
451080	454440	He'd actually made prior statements to the press about the incident.
454440	456840	And let's use PragerU's little calendar here.
456840	459960	So, we have the rally on the 11th and the 12th there.
459960	463720	Their little cartoon Trump on August 15th here might give you the impression
463720	468440	that he didn't say anything on the matter until that point, but that's not true.
468440	472440	Trump's first comments to the press came on August 12th, shortly after the rally,
472440	473080	when he said,
473080	475080	"...we condemn, in the strongest possible terms,
475080	480120	this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides."
480120	482600	So, Trump is drawing a moral equivalence there,
482600	486280	much like his later, fine people on both sides comment.
486280	488280	Only here, on August 12th,
488280	492440	Trump did not distinguish between groups of Unite the Right attendees,
492440	496680	nor did he name or condemn the white supremacists or neo-Nazis.
496680	501400	In fact, he specifically ignored journalists asking him questions on the matter,
501400	503160	and just wanders off.
503160	506200	"...Mr. President, do you want the support of these white nationalist groups
506200	507800	who say they support you, Mr. President?"
507800	508440	"...Mr. President..."
508440	510200	"...have you denounced them strongly enough?"
510200	512840	"...a car planning a group of people, would you call that terrorism, sir?"
517320	520600	Now, this refusal to condemn the white supremacists earned Trump
520600	523640	very harsh criticism from various places.
523640	527720	Not just the liberal news organizations that PragerU doesn't like, mind,
527720	530600	but also from the Republican Party.
530600	532120	Senator Cory Gardner said,
532120	534920	"...Mr. President, we must call evil by its name.
534920	538200	These were white supremacists, and this was domestic terrorism."
538840	540200	Marco Rubio said,
540200	544200	"...very important for the nation to hear the president describe events in Charlottesville
544200	548120	for what they are, a terror attack by white supremacists."
548120	551160	Senator Orrin Hatch's office tweeted his statement,
551160	554360	"...my brother didn't give his life fighting Hitler for Nazi ideas
554360	556040	to go unchallenged here at home."
556040	558280	And John McCain also gave a statement,
558280	561800	specifically calling out white supremacists and neo-Nazis.
561800	564200	And all of this was much reported in the press,
564200	565960	so what's the takeaway from this?
565960	569240	Well, Trump's refusal to condemn neo-Nazis
569240	574120	was already a huge news story before his comments on August 15th,
574120	577720	and he had not, at that point, made clear that he was distinguishing
577720	580680	between different groups of Unite the Right attendees.
580680	584360	PragerU act like this controversy started on August 15th,
584360	588040	but it actually started three days earlier, on August 12th.
588040	590120	They are lying by omission here.
590120	592520	Now, two days later, on August 14th,
592520	595480	Trump was forced by the negative reaction in the press
595480	601080	and his own political party to back down and condemn racism, finally.
601720	603720	He read a prepared statement to the press,
603720	608360	saying that the KKK and neo-Nazis' ETC are bad.
608360	610440	So, well done to President Trump,
610440	614200	therefore eventually clearing that incredibly low bar.
614200	617080	Now, this brings us to Trump's comments on August 15th
617080	619960	at the press conference that PragerU is concerned with.
619960	625160	His comments here actually reignited the controversy which already existed,
625160	628360	because Trump defends his first comments on the matter
628360	631240	when he's asked about them by saying things like,
631240	633960	"'Yes, I think there's blame on both sides.'"
633960	637640	So this press conference was seen as a backpedal by Trump.
637640	640520	First, he refused to condemn white supremacy,
640520	643880	and then he was forced to read a prepared statement doing so,
643880	649160	but then here, off script again, he's back to saying this both sides rubbish.
649160	652360	This is the first reason for Trump being criticized here.
652360	655880	He defended his earlier decision to both spread the blame
655880	660520	and declined to mention or condemn the white supremacists and Nazis.
660520	663880	The second reason that Trump was criticized after this press conference
663880	667320	is that the claim that there were some fine people at the Unite the Right rally
667320	672840	peacefully protesting the removal of the statue is ridiculous and incorrect.
672840	675560	There were not fine people at the rally.
675560	680360	It was explicitly organized as a white supremacist neo-Nazi rally.
680360	683160	Nazi iconography was everywhere.
683160	687320	The listed speakers were white supremacists and neo-Nazis.
687320	691400	It was organized by white supremacists and neo-Nazis.
691400	696360	There was absolutely no confusion about who these people are or what they believe.
696600	698840	Gas the kites, race the kites!
698840	700520	Gas the kites, race the kites!
700520	702200	There's war now!
702200	710040	C.O.! C.O.!
710040	713640	And here's something else that PragerU leave out of the narrative here.
713640	718440	When Trump says there were people at the rally to quietly protest the removal of the statue,
718440	721800	he lets us know exactly who he's talking about.
721800	723320	Trump at one point says,
723320	726760	But they were there to protest, excuse me, if you take a look,
726760	732600	the night before they were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.
732600	734280	And then later he says,
734280	738600	No, no, there were people in that rally, and I looked the night before.
738600	744520	If you look, there were people protesting very quietly the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.
744520	747160	I'm sure in that group there were some bad ones.
747160	750360	The following day it looked like they had some rough bad people.
750360	753880	Neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them.
753880	757960	So Trump is saying that on August 12th there were some rough bad people,
757960	761720	but the night before at the August 11th torch rally,
761720	765000	that was the quiet protest against the removal of the statue,
765000	769240	which contained the fine people, as well as some bad ones.
769240	772760	This graphic that PragerU uses in their video to show the president
772760	777720	condemning the white nationalists at the torch rally is therefore a ridiculous lie,
777720	782520	because it was exactly this group that he was saying was a mix of good and bad people.
782520	785240	So let's take a look at that torch rally very briefly,
785240	789560	and we'll see if we can spot the difference between the fine people and the bad ones.
796440	798760	Jews will not replace us!
799640	802280	Jews will not replace us!
802280	805000	This is the reason that Trump was criticized.
805000	809080	His distinguishing between the good and bad people here is a lie.
809720	812120	All these people are neo-Nazis.
812120	813800	They were all chanting,
813800	818280	Jews will not replace us, and blood and soil, which is a Nazi slogan.
818280	823320	If Trump meant any of these people when he said there were some fine people at the rally,
823320	826280	he was calling neo-Nazis fine people.
826280	829720	The trick PragerU are attempting to pull is this.
829720	834760	The president was criticized for his reluctance to condemn neo-Nazis and white supremacists.
834760	837320	He at first refused to do so,
837320	842920	only backing down after first waiting multiple days and being criticized by his own political party.
842920	846920	Then the next day, he backpedaled to his initial claim that there were some good people
846920	851160	at the explicitly neo-Nazi organized torch rally,
851160	855000	despite the clearly available counter-evidence to that.
855000	858360	This true version of events is indefensible,
858360	862120	so PragerU simply pretend that something different happened.
862120	867080	They pretend that the president openly and eagerly condemned white supremacists
867080	869560	and that the media reported that he did not.
870280	871640	This did not happen.
872280	878680	The media reported Trump's comments in full, including his condemnation of the neo-Nazis.
878680	882360	The Charlottesville lie is itself a lie.
882360	886280	I actually suspect this video title is a work-in-progress title
886280	890600	that they forgot to change later, like snakes on a plane or something.
890600	894360	Lying about a neo-Nazi rally and pretending some good people were there
894360	900360	in order to attack various news organizations they don't like is awful and dangerous,
900360	902200	and PragerU should be ashamed.
903000	904520	Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.
904520	908680	It's just a short video, this one, that I wanted to get out as quickly as possible.
908680	912200	I thought it was better to interrupt my work on my next very long video
912200	914280	in order to get this one out promptly.
914280	917560	And such is my haste here that I'm not even doing the credits properly.
917560	919160	So thank you to all my patrons.
919720	922760	Everyone who has signed up to the credits tier over on Patreon
922760	924920	will be in the credits of my next video.
924920	927160	I hope you understand why I'm rushing with this one,
927160	929560	so apologies to my patrons for that.
929560	933240	And for all you non-patrons out there, there is a link to my Patreon below
933240	936360	if you'd like to be party to future disappointments.
937160	940520	That's all from me today, folks, and I'll see you next time.
