1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,180
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:04,880
This is a video responding to a recent PragerU video titled,

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,280
The Charlottesville Lie.

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,840
That video is discussing the media's response to President Trump's controversial comments

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,740
in the wake of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville back in 2017.

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,260
And the description to that video on the PragerU website reads,

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:23,260
"...did President Trump call neo-Nazis very fine people during a famous press conference

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,360
following the Charlottesville riots of 2017?

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,020
The major media reported that he did.

10
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,140
But what if their reporting is wrong?

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,520
Worse, what if their reporting is wrong, and they know it's wrong?

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,860
A straight exploration of the facts should reveal the truth."

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:44,140
That's what CNN political analyst Steve Cortez does in this critically important video.

14
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,200
As always, I would suggest you watch that video first. It is only five minutes long.

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,380
Also, I'm not going to be going through the events of the Unite the Right rally in detail here,

16
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,620
as I've already done that in my video titled,

17
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,980
Charlottesville, the true alt-right.

18
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,500
So if you need a refresher, I'd advise you also go and watch that first.

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,200
It's only, uh, fifty-three minutes long, right?

20
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,620
So then, PragerU's main argument is that the mainstream media lied about Trump's comments

21
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,700
with regards to the Unite the Right rally by omitting that he distinguished between the neo-Nazis

22
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:21,800
and white supremacists at the rally, and those apparently there to merely protest the removal of Confederate statues.

23
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,420
By apparently omitting this information,

24
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:30,680
various media outlets were then free to allegedly claim that Trump was calling the Nazis fine people.

25
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,860
In typical PragerU fashion, however, they provide absolutely no evidence of their main claim.

26
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,780
They just tell you that it's true, and expect you to take their word on the matter.

27
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,160
Now, instead of citing any actual news articles to back up their claims,

28
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:51,220
they instead show this cartoon newspaper that they made up, remember,

29
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,060
which says,

30
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,680
And then they argue with that.

31
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,860
So we have to ask, uh, why no actual non-cartoon sources here?

32
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,860
They elsewhere cite an actual New York Times article when attempting to back up a different claim,

33
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,800
so I don't believe that this refusal to cite articles as evidence is a stylistic choice.

34
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,640
There must be another reason why they don't want to show you the evidence.

35
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,560
Now, PragerU don't cite any specific articles,

36
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,720
but they do mention several news networks and newspapers as being the ones that supposedly spread the lie.

37
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,440
Uh, here, where they say,

38
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,720
So we have our list of culprits here.

39
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,920
These are the vile organizations that neglected to mention Trump differentiated between the groups of protesters,

40
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,560
and that he condemned the Nazis.

41
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,560
How allegedly manipulative of them.

42
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,080
Only, here's the thing.

43
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,000
And you had people, and I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists,

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,320
because they should be condemned totally.

45
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:08,320
But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists, okay?

46
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,000
That's ABC News there, reposting the clip of Trump condemning neo-Nazis to their Twitter feed,

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,400
and linking to a story in which they say,

48
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,840
So, ABC didn't spread the lie there.

49
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,680
They spread Trump's condemnation of neo-Nazis,

50
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,960
and made clear that Trump thought some people were there simply to protest the removal of the statue.

51
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,280
So, PragerU got that one wrong.

52
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,160
Uh, how about CBS?

53
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,920
I've condemned neo-Nazis.

54
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,800
I've condemned many different groups,

55
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,440
but not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me.

56
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,760
That's CBS showing a clip of Trump condemning neo-Nazis above a news story,

57
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,880
which also contains quotes showing that Trump distinguished between the groups of protesters.

58
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,000
NBC put out an article that quotes Trump as saying,

59
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,920
Next up, NPR.

60
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:40,000
He ultimately did criticize as neo-Nazis and Klansmen and white supremacists,

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,600
but he said that description didn't fit everyone who was taking part in these demonstrations.

62
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,280
Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me.

63
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,080
Not all of those people were white supremacists, by any stretch.

64
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,760
He went on to say that some of the demonstrators were there to protest the taking down of a statue of Robert E. Lee.

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,320
That's a clip of NPR taken from the same day as Trump's comments there, so that's them off the hook as well.

66
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,720
Next up is the New York Times.

67
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,320
They put out an article that says,

68
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,560
There's one more thing to be said about this singling out of the New York Times by PragerU here.

69
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,040
Elsewhere in the video, they say the following,

70
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,920
And then they quote someone who says,

71
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,360
Now, the thing to note here is that PragerU cite the New York Times as their only evidence

72
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,160
that some good people were at the Unite the Right rally,

73
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,040
then later criticized the New York Times for lying about the Unite the Right rally.

74
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,400
I mean, if the New York Times were apparently so dedicated to pushing this anti-Trump lie,

75
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,360
why would they release an article that contradicts it?

76
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,800
You know, can we trust the New York Times or not, PragerU?

77
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,280
Just when they agree with what you're saying, I guess. Probably that, yeah.

78
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,240
Lastly, the Washington Post.

79
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:35,160
Every single news organization that PragerU names as having participated in the so-called

80
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,800
Charlottesville lie reported exactly what PragerU claims they didn't.

81
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,760
They all made clear in their reporting following the press conference that Trump

82
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,720
distinguished between the groups of protesters.

83
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,160
PragerU is lying about these news organizations.

84
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,920
They all reported exactly what Donald Trump said,

85
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,760
and I will leave links to these news stories below if you'd like to check them out.

86
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,360
So, what happened here, then?

87
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,400
Well, the media did criticize Trump for his fine people on both sides' statements,

88
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,760
but this was not because they were lying about what he said.

89
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:13,080
They actually criticized Trump for two different, valid reasons.

90
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,360
The first reason was because of his previous comments on the matter,

91
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,000
which PragerU omit from their narrative here.

92
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
They present an incorrect version of the timeline of events.

93
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,760
You see, the press conference at which President Trump made those statements was not,

94
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,080
as PragerU implied, the first time that Trump addressed violence at the rally.

95
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,440
He'd actually made prior statements to the press about the incident.

96
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,840
And let's use PragerU's little calendar here.

97
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,960
So, we have the rally on the 11th and the 12th there.

98
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,720
Their little cartoon Trump on August 15th here might give you the impression

99
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,440
that he didn't say anything on the matter until that point, but that's not true.

100
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,440
Trump's first comments to the press came on August 12th, shortly after the rally,

101
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,080
when he said,

102
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,080
"...we condemn, in the strongest possible terms,

103
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,120
this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides."

104
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,600
So, Trump is drawing a moral equivalence there,

105
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,280
much like his later, fine people on both sides comment.

106
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,280
Only here, on August 12th,

107
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,440
Trump did not distinguish between groups of Unite the Right attendees,

108
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,680
nor did he name or condemn the white supremacists or neo-Nazis.

109
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,400
In fact, he specifically ignored journalists asking him questions on the matter,

110
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,160
and just wanders off.

111
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,200
"...Mr. President, do you want the support of these white nationalist groups

112
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,800
who say they support you, Mr. President?"

113
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,440
"...Mr. President..."

114
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,200
"...have you denounced them strongly enough?"

115
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,840
"...a car planning a group of people, would you call that terrorism, sir?"

116
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,600
Now, this refusal to condemn the white supremacists earned Trump

117
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,640
very harsh criticism from various places.

118
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,720
Not just the liberal news organizations that PragerU doesn't like, mind,

119
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,600
but also from the Republican Party.

120
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,120
Senator Cory Gardner said,

121
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,920
"...Mr. President, we must call evil by its name.

122
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,200
These were white supremacists, and this was domestic terrorism."

123
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,200
Marco Rubio said,

124
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,200
"...very important for the nation to hear the president describe events in Charlottesville

125
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,120
for what they are, a terror attack by white supremacists."

126
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,160
Senator Orrin Hatch's office tweeted his statement,

127
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,360
"...my brother didn't give his life fighting Hitler for Nazi ideas

128
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,040
to go unchallenged here at home."

129
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,280
And John McCain also gave a statement,

130
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,800
specifically calling out white supremacists and neo-Nazis.

131
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,200
And all of this was much reported in the press,

132
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,960
so what's the takeaway from this?

133
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,240
Well, Trump's refusal to condemn neo-Nazis

134
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,120
was already a huge news story before his comments on August 15th,

135
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,720
and he had not, at that point, made clear that he was distinguishing

136
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,680
between different groups of Unite the Right attendees.

137
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,360
PragerU act like this controversy started on August 15th,

138
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,040
but it actually started three days earlier, on August 12th.

139
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,120
They are lying by omission here.

140
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,520
Now, two days later, on August 14th,

141
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,480
Trump was forced by the negative reaction in the press

142
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:01,080
and his own political party to back down and condemn racism, finally.

143
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,720
He read a prepared statement to the press,

144
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,360
saying that the KKK and neo-Nazis' ETC are bad.

145
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,440
So, well done to President Trump,

146
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,200
therefore eventually clearing that incredibly low bar.

147
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,080
Now, this brings us to Trump's comments on August 15th

148
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,960
at the press conference that PragerU is concerned with.

149
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:25,160
His comments here actually reignited the controversy which already existed,

150
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,360
because Trump defends his first comments on the matter

151
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,240
when he's asked about them by saying things like,

152
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,960
"'Yes, I think there's blame on both sides.'"

153
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,640
So this press conference was seen as a backpedal by Trump.

154
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,520
First, he refused to condemn white supremacy,

155
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,880
and then he was forced to read a prepared statement doing so,

156
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:49,160
but then here, off script again, he's back to saying this both sides rubbish.

157
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,360
This is the first reason for Trump being criticized here.

158
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,880
He defended his earlier decision to both spread the blame

159
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,520
and declined to mention or condemn the white supremacists and Nazis.

160
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,880
The second reason that Trump was criticized after this press conference

161
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,320
is that the claim that there were some fine people at the Unite the Right rally

162
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,840
peacefully protesting the removal of the statue is ridiculous and incorrect.

163
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,560
There were not fine people at the rally.

164
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,360
It was explicitly organized as a white supremacist neo-Nazi rally.

165
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,160
Nazi iconography was everywhere.

166
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,320
The listed speakers were white supremacists and neo-Nazis.

167
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,400
It was organized by white supremacists and neo-Nazis.

168
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:36,360
There was absolutely no confusion about who these people are or what they believe.

169
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,840
Gas the kites, race the kites!

170
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,520
Gas the kites, race the kites!

171
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,200
There's war now!

172
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:50,040
C.O.! C.O.!

173
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,640
And here's something else that PragerU leave out of the narrative here.

174
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,440
When Trump says there were people at the rally to quietly protest the removal of the statue,

175
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,800
he lets us know exactly who he's talking about.

176
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,320
Trump at one point says,

177
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,760
But they were there to protest, excuse me, if you take a look,

178
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:12,600
the night before they were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.

179
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,280
And then later he says,

180
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,600
No, no, there were people in that rally, and I looked the night before.

181
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,520
If you look, there were people protesting very quietly the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.

182
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,160
I'm sure in that group there were some bad ones.

183
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,360
The following day it looked like they had some rough bad people.

184
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,880
Neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them.

185
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,960
So Trump is saying that on August 12th there were some rough bad people,

186
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,720
but the night before at the August 11th torch rally,

187
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,000
that was the quiet protest against the removal of the statue,

188
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,240
which contained the fine people, as well as some bad ones.

189
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,760
This graphic that PragerU uses in their video to show the president

190
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,720
condemning the white nationalists at the torch rally is therefore a ridiculous lie,

191
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,520
because it was exactly this group that he was saying was a mix of good and bad people.

192
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,240
So let's take a look at that torch rally very briefly,

193
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,560
and we'll see if we can spot the difference between the fine people and the bad ones.

194
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,760
Jews will not replace us!

195
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,280
Jews will not replace us!

196
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,000
This is the reason that Trump was criticized.

197
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,080
His distinguishing between the good and bad people here is a lie.

198
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,120
All these people are neo-Nazis.

199
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,800
They were all chanting,

200
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,280
Jews will not replace us, and blood and soil, which is a Nazi slogan.

201
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:43,320
If Trump meant any of these people when he said there were some fine people at the rally,

202
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,280
he was calling neo-Nazis fine people.

203
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,720
The trick PragerU are attempting to pull is this.

204
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,760
The president was criticized for his reluctance to condemn neo-Nazis and white supremacists.

205
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,320
He at first refused to do so,

206
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,920
only backing down after first waiting multiple days and being criticized by his own political party.

207
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,920
Then the next day, he backpedaled to his initial claim that there were some good people

208
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,160
at the explicitly neo-Nazi organized torch rally,

209
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,000
despite the clearly available counter-evidence to that.

210
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,360
This true version of events is indefensible,

211
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,120
so PragerU simply pretend that something different happened.

212
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,080
They pretend that the president openly and eagerly condemned white supremacists

213
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,560
and that the media reported that he did not.

214
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,640
This did not happen.

215
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:38,680
The media reported Trump's comments in full, including his condemnation of the neo-Nazis.

216
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,360
The Charlottesville lie is itself a lie.

217
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,280
I actually suspect this video title is a work-in-progress title

218
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,600
that they forgot to change later, like snakes on a plane or something.

219
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,360
Lying about a neo-Nazi rally and pretending some good people were there

220
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,360
in order to attack various news organizations they don't like is awful and dangerous,

221
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,200
and PragerU should be ashamed.

222
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,520
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

223
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,680
It's just a short video, this one, that I wanted to get out as quickly as possible.

224
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,200
I thought it was better to interrupt my work on my next very long video

225
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,280
in order to get this one out promptly.

226
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,560
And such is my haste here that I'm not even doing the credits properly.

227
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,160

228
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,760

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,560
