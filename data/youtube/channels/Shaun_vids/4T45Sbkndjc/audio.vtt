00:00.000 --> 00:01.180
Hello, everyone.

00:01.180 --> 00:04.880
This is a video responding to a recent PragerU video titled,

00:04.880 --> 00:06.280
The Charlottesville Lie.

00:06.280 --> 00:10.840
That video is discussing the media's response to President Trump's controversial comments

00:10.840 --> 00:14.740
in the wake of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville back in 2017.

00:14.740 --> 00:18.260
And the description to that video on the PragerU website reads,

00:18.260 --> 00:23.260
"...did President Trump call neo-Nazis very fine people during a famous press conference

00:23.260 --> 00:26.360
following the Charlottesville riots of 2017?

00:26.360 --> 00:29.020
The major media reported that he did.

00:29.140 --> 00:31.140
But what if their reporting is wrong?

00:31.680 --> 00:35.520
Worse, what if their reporting is wrong, and they know it's wrong?

00:35.520 --> 00:38.860
A straight exploration of the facts should reveal the truth."

00:38.860 --> 00:44.140
That's what CNN political analyst Steve Cortez does in this critically important video.

00:44.860 --> 00:49.200
As always, I would suggest you watch that video first. It is only five minutes long.

00:49.200 --> 00:53.380
Also, I'm not going to be going through the events of the Unite the Right rally in detail here,

00:53.380 --> 00:55.620
as I've already done that in my video titled,

00:55.620 --> 00:57.980
Charlottesville, the true alt-right.

00:57.980 --> 01:01.500
So if you need a refresher, I'd advise you also go and watch that first.

01:01.500 --> 01:05.200
It's only, uh, fifty-three minutes long, right?

01:05.700 --> 01:10.620
So then, PragerU's main argument is that the mainstream media lied about Trump's comments

01:10.620 --> 01:15.700
with regards to the Unite the Right rally by omitting that he distinguished between the neo-Nazis

01:15.700 --> 01:21.800
and white supremacists at the rally, and those apparently there to merely protest the removal of Confederate statues.

01:22.160 --> 01:24.420
By apparently omitting this information,

01:24.460 --> 01:30.680
various media outlets were then free to allegedly claim that Trump was calling the Nazis fine people.

01:30.680 --> 01:36.860
In typical PragerU fashion, however, they provide absolutely no evidence of their main claim.

01:36.860 --> 01:41.780
They just tell you that it's true, and expect you to take their word on the matter.

01:41.780 --> 01:46.160
Now, instead of citing any actual news articles to back up their claims,

01:46.160 --> 01:51.220
they instead show this cartoon newspaper that they made up, remember,

01:51.260 --> 01:52.060
which says,

01:55.760 --> 01:57.680
And then they argue with that.

01:57.680 --> 02:02.860
So we have to ask, uh, why no actual non-cartoon sources here?

02:02.860 --> 02:07.860
They elsewhere cite an actual New York Times article when attempting to back up a different claim,

02:07.860 --> 02:12.800
so I don't believe that this refusal to cite articles as evidence is a stylistic choice.

02:12.800 --> 02:16.640
There must be another reason why they don't want to show you the evidence.

02:16.680 --> 02:19.560
Now, PragerU don't cite any specific articles,

02:19.560 --> 02:25.720
but they do mention several news networks and newspapers as being the ones that supposedly spread the lie.

02:25.720 --> 02:27.440
Uh, here, where they say,

02:38.560 --> 02:40.720
So we have our list of culprits here.

02:40.720 --> 02:46.920
These are the vile organizations that neglected to mention Trump differentiated between the groups of protesters,

02:46.920 --> 02:49.560
and that he condemned the Nazis.

02:49.560 --> 02:52.560
How allegedly manipulative of them.

02:52.560 --> 02:55.080
Only, here's the thing.

02:55.080 --> 03:00.000
And you had people, and I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists,

03:00.000 --> 03:02.320
because they should be condemned totally.

03:02.320 --> 03:08.320
But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists, okay?

03:08.400 --> 03:14.000
That's ABC News there, reposting the clip of Trump condemning neo-Nazis to their Twitter feed,

03:14.000 --> 03:16.400
and linking to a story in which they say,

03:32.040 --> 03:34.840
So, ABC didn't spread the lie there.

03:34.880 --> 03:37.680
They spread Trump's condemnation of neo-Nazis,

03:37.680 --> 03:42.960
and made clear that Trump thought some people were there simply to protest the removal of the statue.

03:42.960 --> 03:45.280
So, PragerU got that one wrong.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.160
Uh, how about CBS?

03:47.160 --> 03:49.920
I've condemned neo-Nazis.

03:49.920 --> 03:52.800
I've condemned many different groups,

03:52.800 --> 03:56.440
but not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me.

03:56.440 --> 04:00.760
That's CBS showing a clip of Trump condemning neo-Nazis above a news story,

04:00.760 --> 04:05.880
which also contains quotes showing that Trump distinguished between the groups of protesters.

04:05.880 --> 04:09.000
NBC put out an article that quotes Trump as saying,

04:31.720 --> 04:33.920
Next up, NPR.

04:33.920 --> 04:40.000
He ultimately did criticize as neo-Nazis and Klansmen and white supremacists,

04:40.000 --> 04:44.600
but he said that description didn't fit everyone who was taking part in these demonstrations.

04:44.600 --> 04:48.280
Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me.

04:48.280 --> 04:52.080
Not all of those people were white supremacists, by any stretch.

04:52.080 --> 04:58.760
He went on to say that some of the demonstrators were there to protest the taking down of a statue of Robert E. Lee.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.320
That's a clip of NPR taken from the same day as Trump's comments there, so that's them off the hook as well.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.720
Next up is the New York Times.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.320
They put out an article that says,

05:22.760 --> 05:27.560
There's one more thing to be said about this singling out of the New York Times by PragerU here.

05:27.560 --> 05:30.040
Elsewhere in the video, they say the following,

05:41.560 --> 05:42.920
And then they quote someone who says,

05:45.800 --> 05:50.360
Now, the thing to note here is that PragerU cite the New York Times as their only evidence

05:50.360 --> 05:53.160
that some good people were at the Unite the Right rally,

05:53.160 --> 05:58.040
then later criticized the New York Times for lying about the Unite the Right rally.

05:58.040 --> 06:03.400
I mean, if the New York Times were apparently so dedicated to pushing this anti-Trump lie,

06:03.400 --> 06:06.360
why would they release an article that contradicts it?

06:06.360 --> 06:09.800
You know, can we trust the New York Times or not, PragerU?

06:10.360 --> 06:14.280
Just when they agree with what you're saying, I guess. Probably that, yeah.

06:15.320 --> 06:17.240
Lastly, the Washington Post.

06:23.160 --> 06:35.160
Every single news organization that PragerU names as having participated in the so-called

06:35.160 --> 06:39.800
Charlottesville lie reported exactly what PragerU claims they didn't.

06:40.360 --> 06:44.760
They all made clear in their reporting following the press conference that Trump

06:44.760 --> 06:47.720
distinguished between the groups of protesters.

06:47.720 --> 06:51.160
PragerU is lying about these news organizations.

06:51.160 --> 06:54.920
They all reported exactly what Donald Trump said,

06:54.920 --> 06:58.760
and I will leave links to these news stories below if you'd like to check them out.

06:58.760 --> 07:00.360
So, what happened here, then?

07:00.360 --> 07:05.400
Well, the media did criticize Trump for his fine people on both sides' statements,

07:05.400 --> 07:08.760
but this was not because they were lying about what he said.

07:08.760 --> 07:13.080
They actually criticized Trump for two different, valid reasons.

07:13.080 --> 07:16.360
The first reason was because of his previous comments on the matter,

07:16.360 --> 07:19.000
which PragerU omit from their narrative here.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
They present an incorrect version of the timeline of events.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.760
You see, the press conference at which President Trump made those statements was not,

07:26.760 --> 07:31.080
as PragerU implied, the first time that Trump addressed violence at the rally.

07:31.080 --> 07:34.440
He'd actually made prior statements to the press about the incident.

07:34.440 --> 07:36.840
And let's use PragerU's little calendar here.

07:36.840 --> 07:39.960
So, we have the rally on the 11th and the 12th there.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.720
Their little cartoon Trump on August 15th here might give you the impression

07:43.720 --> 07:48.440
that he didn't say anything on the matter until that point, but that's not true.

07:48.440 --> 07:52.440
Trump's first comments to the press came on August 12th, shortly after the rally,

07:52.440 --> 07:53.080
when he said,

07:53.080 --> 07:55.080
"...we condemn, in the strongest possible terms,

07:55.080 --> 08:00.120
this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides."

08:00.120 --> 08:02.600
So, Trump is drawing a moral equivalence there,

08:02.600 --> 08:06.280
much like his later, fine people on both sides comment.

08:06.280 --> 08:08.280
Only here, on August 12th,

08:08.280 --> 08:12.440
Trump did not distinguish between groups of Unite the Right attendees,

08:12.440 --> 08:16.680
nor did he name or condemn the white supremacists or neo-Nazis.

08:16.680 --> 08:21.400
In fact, he specifically ignored journalists asking him questions on the matter,

08:21.400 --> 08:23.160
and just wanders off.

08:23.160 --> 08:26.200
"...Mr. President, do you want the support of these white nationalist groups

08:26.200 --> 08:27.800
who say they support you, Mr. President?"

08:27.800 --> 08:28.440
"...Mr. President..."

08:28.440 --> 08:30.200
"...have you denounced them strongly enough?"

08:30.200 --> 08:32.840
"...a car planning a group of people, would you call that terrorism, sir?"

08:37.320 --> 08:40.600
Now, this refusal to condemn the white supremacists earned Trump

08:40.600 --> 08:43.640
very harsh criticism from various places.

08:43.640 --> 08:47.720
Not just the liberal news organizations that PragerU doesn't like, mind,

08:47.720 --> 08:50.600
but also from the Republican Party.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.120
Senator Cory Gardner said,

08:52.120 --> 08:54.920
"...Mr. President, we must call evil by its name.

08:54.920 --> 08:58.200
These were white supremacists, and this was domestic terrorism."

08:58.840 --> 09:00.200
Marco Rubio said,

09:00.200 --> 09:04.200
"...very important for the nation to hear the president describe events in Charlottesville

09:04.200 --> 09:08.120
for what they are, a terror attack by white supremacists."

09:08.120 --> 09:11.160
Senator Orrin Hatch's office tweeted his statement,

09:11.160 --> 09:14.360
"...my brother didn't give his life fighting Hitler for Nazi ideas

09:14.360 --> 09:16.040
to go unchallenged here at home."

09:16.040 --> 09:18.280
And John McCain also gave a statement,

09:18.280 --> 09:21.800
specifically calling out white supremacists and neo-Nazis.

09:21.800 --> 09:24.200
And all of this was much reported in the press,

09:24.200 --> 09:25.960
so what's the takeaway from this?

09:25.960 --> 09:29.240
Well, Trump's refusal to condemn neo-Nazis

09:29.240 --> 09:34.120
was already a huge news story before his comments on August 15th,

09:34.120 --> 09:37.720
and he had not, at that point, made clear that he was distinguishing

09:37.720 --> 09:40.680
between different groups of Unite the Right attendees.

09:40.680 --> 09:44.360
PragerU act like this controversy started on August 15th,

09:44.360 --> 09:48.040
but it actually started three days earlier, on August 12th.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.120
They are lying by omission here.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.520
Now, two days later, on August 14th,

09:52.520 --> 09:55.480
Trump was forced by the negative reaction in the press

09:55.480 --> 10:01.080
and his own political party to back down and condemn racism, finally.

10:01.720 --> 10:03.720
He read a prepared statement to the press,

10:03.720 --> 10:08.360
saying that the KKK and neo-Nazis' ETC are bad.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.440
So, well done to President Trump,

10:10.440 --> 10:14.200
therefore eventually clearing that incredibly low bar.

10:14.200 --> 10:17.080
Now, this brings us to Trump's comments on August 15th

10:17.080 --> 10:19.960
at the press conference that PragerU is concerned with.

10:19.960 --> 10:25.160
His comments here actually reignited the controversy which already existed,

10:25.160 --> 10:28.360
because Trump defends his first comments on the matter

10:28.360 --> 10:31.240
when he's asked about them by saying things like,

10:31.240 --> 10:33.960
"'Yes, I think there's blame on both sides.'"

10:33.960 --> 10:37.640
So this press conference was seen as a backpedal by Trump.

10:37.640 --> 10:40.520
First, he refused to condemn white supremacy,

10:40.520 --> 10:43.880
and then he was forced to read a prepared statement doing so,

10:43.880 --> 10:49.160
but then here, off script again, he's back to saying this both sides rubbish.

10:49.160 --> 10:52.360
This is the first reason for Trump being criticized here.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.880
He defended his earlier decision to both spread the blame

10:55.880 --> 11:00.520
and declined to mention or condemn the white supremacists and Nazis.

11:00.520 --> 11:03.880
The second reason that Trump was criticized after this press conference

11:03.880 --> 11:07.320
is that the claim that there were some fine people at the Unite the Right rally

11:07.320 --> 11:12.840
peacefully protesting the removal of the statue is ridiculous and incorrect.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.560
There were not fine people at the rally.

11:15.560 --> 11:20.360
It was explicitly organized as a white supremacist neo-Nazi rally.

11:20.360 --> 11:23.160
Nazi iconography was everywhere.

11:23.160 --> 11:27.320
The listed speakers were white supremacists and neo-Nazis.

11:27.320 --> 11:31.400
It was organized by white supremacists and neo-Nazis.

11:31.400 --> 11:36.360
There was absolutely no confusion about who these people are or what they believe.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.840
Gas the kites, race the kites!

11:38.840 --> 11:40.520
Gas the kites, race the kites!

11:40.520 --> 11:42.200
There's war now!

11:42.200 --> 11:50.040
C.O.! C.O.!

11:50.040 --> 11:53.640
And here's something else that PragerU leave out of the narrative here.

11:53.640 --> 11:58.440
When Trump says there were people at the rally to quietly protest the removal of the statue,

11:58.440 --> 12:01.800
he lets us know exactly who he's talking about.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.320
Trump at one point says,

12:03.320 --> 12:06.760
But they were there to protest, excuse me, if you take a look,

12:06.760 --> 12:12.600
the night before they were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.280
And then later he says,

12:14.280 --> 12:18.600
No, no, there were people in that rally, and I looked the night before.

12:18.600 --> 12:24.520
If you look, there were people protesting very quietly the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.

12:24.520 --> 12:27.160
I'm sure in that group there were some bad ones.

12:27.160 --> 12:30.360
The following day it looked like they had some rough bad people.

12:30.360 --> 12:33.880
Neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them.

12:33.880 --> 12:37.960
So Trump is saying that on August 12th there were some rough bad people,

12:37.960 --> 12:41.720
but the night before at the August 11th torch rally,

12:41.720 --> 12:45.000
that was the quiet protest against the removal of the statue,

12:45.000 --> 12:49.240
which contained the fine people, as well as some bad ones.

12:49.240 --> 12:52.760
This graphic that PragerU uses in their video to show the president

12:52.760 --> 12:57.720
condemning the white nationalists at the torch rally is therefore a ridiculous lie,

12:57.720 --> 13:02.520
because it was exactly this group that he was saying was a mix of good and bad people.

13:02.520 --> 13:05.240
So let's take a look at that torch rally very briefly,

13:05.240 --> 13:09.560
and we'll see if we can spot the difference between the fine people and the bad ones.

13:16.440 --> 13:18.760
Jews will not replace us!

13:19.640 --> 13:22.280
Jews will not replace us!

13:22.280 --> 13:25.000
This is the reason that Trump was criticized.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.080
His distinguishing between the good and bad people here is a lie.

13:29.720 --> 13:32.120
All these people are neo-Nazis.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.800
They were all chanting,

13:33.800 --> 13:38.280
Jews will not replace us, and blood and soil, which is a Nazi slogan.

13:38.280 --> 13:43.320
If Trump meant any of these people when he said there were some fine people at the rally,

13:43.320 --> 13:46.280
he was calling neo-Nazis fine people.

13:46.280 --> 13:49.720
The trick PragerU are attempting to pull is this.

13:49.720 --> 13:54.760
The president was criticized for his reluctance to condemn neo-Nazis and white supremacists.

13:54.760 --> 13:57.320
He at first refused to do so,

13:57.320 --> 14:02.920
only backing down after first waiting multiple days and being criticized by his own political party.

14:02.920 --> 14:06.920
Then the next day, he backpedaled to his initial claim that there were some good people

14:06.920 --> 14:11.160
at the explicitly neo-Nazi organized torch rally,

14:11.160 --> 14:15.000
despite the clearly available counter-evidence to that.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.360
This true version of events is indefensible,

14:18.360 --> 14:22.120
so PragerU simply pretend that something different happened.

14:22.120 --> 14:27.080
They pretend that the president openly and eagerly condemned white supremacists

14:27.080 --> 14:29.560
and that the media reported that he did not.

14:30.280 --> 14:31.640
This did not happen.

14:32.280 --> 14:38.680
The media reported Trump's comments in full, including his condemnation of the neo-Nazis.

14:38.680 --> 14:42.360
The Charlottesville lie is itself a lie.

14:42.360 --> 14:46.280
I actually suspect this video title is a work-in-progress title

14:46.280 --> 14:50.600
that they forgot to change later, like snakes on a plane or something.

14:50.600 --> 14:54.360
Lying about a neo-Nazi rally and pretending some good people were there

14:54.360 --> 15:00.360
in order to attack various news organizations they don't like is awful and dangerous,

15:00.360 --> 15:02.200
and PragerU should be ashamed.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.520
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

15:04.520 --> 15:08.680
It's just a short video, this one, that I wanted to get out as quickly as possible.

15:08.680 --> 15:12.200
I thought it was better to interrupt my work on my next very long video

15:12.200 --> 15:14.280
in order to get this one out promptly.

15:14.280 --> 15:17.560
And such is my haste here that I'm not even doing the credits properly.

15:17.560 --> 15:19.160
So thank you to all my patrons.

15:19.720 --> 15:22.760
Everyone who has signed up to the credits tier over on Patreon

15:22.760 --> 15:24.920
will be in the credits of my next video.

15:24.920 --> 15:27.160
I hope you understand why I'm rushing with this one,

15:27.160 --> 15:29.560
so apologies to my patrons for that.

15:29.560 --> 15:33.240
And for all you non-patrons out there, there is a link to my Patreon below

15:33.240 --> 15:36.360
if you'd like to be party to future disappointments.

15:37.160 --> 15:40.520
That's all from me today, folks, and I'll see you next time.
