1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
So I recently watched a YouTube video about the movie Mad Max Fury Road.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,800
It was the Comic-Con trailer, which is a really good trailer, by the way.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,960
But this made YouTube decide that all I ever want to watch is Mad Max videos, and...

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,320
Well, to their credit, that's right.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,440
But one video it recommended to me was

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,720
Everything Wrong with Mad Max Fury Road by a channel called CinemaSins.

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,480
Now, I've never watched a video by CinemaSins before, but I watched this one,

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,280
and the first thing I noticed was that their audio seems a little weird.

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,360
My name is Max. My world is fire and blood.

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,800
And then they complain about Tom Hardy sounding unintelligible.

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,440
Also, Tom Hardy is forced to speak unintelligibly, cliche.

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,080
And I thought, that's odd, I don't remember him sounding like that in the actual movie,

13
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,200
so I went and checked.

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,880
My name is Max. My world is fire and blood.

15
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,800
My name is Max. My world is fire and blood.

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,960
I am the one who runs from both the living and the dead.

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,320
I am the one who runs from both the living and the dead.

18
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,480
Now, I don't know if this is something CinemaSins does for all of their videos,

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,920
but, you know, it's kind of unfair to edit the audio

20
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,880
and then complain about it sounding unintelligible.

21
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,560
So I thought, whatever, I'll watch the rest of the video,

22
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,720
and holy shit, these guys are wrong about nearly everything.

23
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,760
I don't understand it. Is it a joke that I'm not getting?

24
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,320
Is it, like, their gimmick?

25
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,320
Like, where CinemaSins, we get everything wrong on purpose?

26
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,440
I don't know, but I'll be honest, the video annoyed me.

27
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:55,760
It annoyed me that they were frequently wrong in very lazy ways.

28
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,640
It annoyed me that they often edited the footage

29
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,520
to obscure the fact that they were incorrect in a point they were making,

30
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,880
and it annoyed me enough to make this video.

31
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,720
Max is a dick to two-headed lizard things.

32
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,880
Max isn't being a dick to the lizard.

33
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,480
He doesn't stand on it because he thinks it's funny or whatever.

34
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,280
He actually eats the lizard in the next shot.

35
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,720
These cars made no sound until they made an appearance in the film.

36
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,080
This isn't a mistake.

37
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,960
The cars are supposed to surprise the audience,

38
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,560
and the sudden roar of the engine is a contrast to the silence of the desert.

39
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,840
If you watch the full scene, that's a lot more apparent.

40
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:59,840
So this is one of the weirder types of sins that CinemaSins like to do.

41
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,360
They just say what is happening on the screen and then give the movie a sin.

42
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,360
I don't get it.

43
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,480
They do it all the time.

44
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,360
Here's another one.

45
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,200
What's... what's that?

46
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,720
That's just what was happening?

47
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,400
What's... what's wrong with that?

48
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,520
Is that meant to be bad?

49
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:26,480
The guy's got the brand right there in front of Max's face.

50
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,000
How is that the mere distant idea of being branded?

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,360
It's... the branding is imminent.

52
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,680
Why are all these guys bald and painted white?

53
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,360
Movie has zero interest in explaining.

54
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,560
So the reason the movie never tells us why these guys are bald and painted white is because

55
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,000
it doesn't really matter.

56
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,280
What matters is that they're all part of a cult and they all look the same.

57
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,400
They could paint themselves red or blue and the effect would be the same.

58
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,000
At a stretch, you could say that they paint themselves white because Joe needs that white

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,240
powder blown on himself to stop from getting sick or whatever that was.

60
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,400
But that's just guessing.

61
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,000
The real reason the movie doesn't get bogged down in a lot of unnecessary exposition is

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,800
that it's really, really good.

63
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,440
Wait, when did these guys get crane hook pulling hooks?

64
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,160
Did they know they need them while they were mindlessly chasing after Max?

65
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,480
Or maybe they just keep it behind that door because that's where they need to use it to

66
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,600
grab the crane hook.

67
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,320
In fact, you can actually see the hooks behind the door in a previous shot.

68
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,120
Okay, first of all, how's the region's water somehow located and contained a dozen stories

69
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,080
up on a rock thingy?

70
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,160
Doesn't this defy all science and gravity knowledge?

71
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,640
Well, since the water's coming out of pipes, I think it's safe to assume that it's being

72
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,720
pumped there from somewhere else.

73
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,520
It's safe to assume this from now all the way until a later scene when the movie just

74
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,080
tells you how the water gets there.

75
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,120
Where does the water come from?

76
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,880
He pumps it up from deep in the earth.

77
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,000
Second of all, this is the least efficient water gifting system ever invented.

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,600
I realize he's a dickhead, but he's literally wasting 90% of the water he's releasing right

79
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,160
now.

80
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,360
Okay, so Joe is wasting the water on purpose.

81
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:14,800
This scene is meant to show us that he's cruel, he's a tyrant, he's got no respect for the

82
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,560
people who depend on him to live, and no respect for water.

83
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,360
And this is spelled out quite explicitly in Joe's dialogue in the scene.

84
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,120
Do not, my friends, become addicted to water.

85
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,640
It will take hold of you, and you will resent its absence.

86
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:41,280
The point of this scene is to establish Joe as the antagonist, and that really wouldn't

87
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,080
work for the audience if they saw him being a kind and considerate person.

88
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,240
Your produce ain't turnin' to Gastown.

89
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,760
Why didn't Furiosa wait until she was completely out of view before she made that turn?

90
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,480
If you watch literally the next five seconds of the movie, you get to see through that

91
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,120
telescope, and you can see all the way to Gastown from Joe's Citadel.

92
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,200
Whoa, this society of criminal assholes takes one of the few universal donors they come

93
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,040
across and straps him to the spiky front of a war vehicle headed into battle, because

94
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,000
why again?

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,960
Okay, so first of all, there's absolutely no indication in the film how many universal

96
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,320
donors these guys have.

97
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,400
They might have a dozen of them, all tied up in cages back at the Citadel.

98
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,680
Who knows?

99
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,720
Second of all, they're all crazy, and it would be completely in character for them to do

100
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,880
something as irrational as tie one of their universal donors.

101
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,080
To the front of a car.

102
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:39,840
Max is specifically there, though, to give blood to Nux, and the shot makes this very

103
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,240
clear.

104
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,720
It follows the tube from Max's neck, down the chain, and into Nux's arm.

105
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,000
These flames would definitely have already killed this back riding asshole, if only due

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,560
to wind.

107
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,720
Not to mention how hot all the metal he's touching would be.

108
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,880
If you watch the full shot, you can see that the flames have only been on for about one

109
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,280
second.

110
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,720
He's positioned in front of them, and the wind is blowing them backwards away from him.

111
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,960
This porcupine car is useful only if attacked by stabable flesh-based human things.

112
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,920
Otherwise, just throw a gasoline water balloon at it and set the fire.

113
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,560
I mean, right?

114
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,840
How many times do we see one person jump from a moving vehicle onto another in this film?

115
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:22,320
It seems like defending yourself against stabable flesh-based human things would be a priority.

116
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,840
This semi is able to drive close enough to a sand lightning tornado to push this other

117
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,840
nearby vehicle into oblivion, without somehow getting sucked into the tornado itself.

118
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,160
So I had no idea about this at all.

119
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:40,720
So I went on Google, I read a few articles, I did a few hours of research, and it turns

120
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,600
out that the big semi trucks, they're heavier than cars.

121
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,440
Cars are a lot smaller.

122
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,880
Also, since these women were all locked up in a harem vault, why was there ever a need

123
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,760
for such things?

124
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,880
Well, the women were all locked up in the vault, and then they escaped.

125
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:09,920
So one example for an instance of such things being needed, at least in Joe's mind, is the

126
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,520
events that are currently occurring in the film.

127
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,040
How the f*** did these assholes find them?

128
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,920
They just went through a sandstorm where everybody who chased them either died or got knocked

129
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,480
unconscious.

130
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,400
What kind of tracks did they leave that led them here?

131
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,840
They haven't left any tracks because they actually haven't moved.

132
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,760
If you remember when Max wakes up at the crash site, he can see the war rig from where he

133
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,240
is, implying that no one's really went very far.

134
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,080
All that's changed is that the storm has begun to lift.

135
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,120
You know, just in case I'm hanging around outside my trunk with no weapons, I've got

136
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,440
this hide-a-gun thing here in case of emergencies.

137
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,160
For instance, an emergency like right now when I'm being attacked outside the truck.

138
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,440
I mean, Furiosa has hidden guns all over the truck.

139
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,520
What's the problem with having one on the outside?

140
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,040
That's the second time since he took possession of this gun that he's fired three shots to

141
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,320
stop someone in their tracks.

142
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,600
How many does he have left?

143
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,400
And why is he so f***ing wasteful of the precious few bullets he has?

144
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,280
Does he need to fire three times as a warning twice?

145
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:12,720
Okay, so Max was run off the road, taken prisoner, forcibly tattooed, locked in a cage, tied

146
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,920
to the front of a car.

147
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:23,280
He was in another car crash, and then he was just in a fight, and he's a little bit, sort

148
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,400
of, I guess he's irrational.

149
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,720
Maybe he's a little bit, he's, you know, it-

150
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,560
All the legs you had to shoot, that one was attached to his favorite.

151
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,120
What, are you going to tell him Max was the one responsible for it?

152
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,080
Why would you do that?

153
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,640
And why is he in any more danger than he was in already?

154
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,400
Such an odd, odd thing to say.

155
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:47,440
Okay, so initially, Max didn't want to let Furiosa and the wives into the truck, and

156
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,600
he was going to just wait and hand them over to Joe in exchange for his freedom.

157
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,960
So we wait.

158
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,680
Then Furiosa hops onto the truck and tries to convince Max to let them in.

159
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,120
You're relying on the gratitude of a very bad man.

160
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,080
You've already damaged one of his wives, how grateful do you think he's gonna be?

161
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,560
So yes, the wives are going to tell Joe.

162
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,880
Max was the one responsible for it.

163
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,000
It's a threat.

164
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,560
He's in danger because the wives are saying,

165
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,200
if you hand us over, we'll tell Joe you shot one of us and he'll kill you.

166
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,760
Yeah, but don't you now leave all the women alone up here with all those weapons you meticulously

167
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,120
took out of their reach a minute ago?

168
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,320
Yeah, how stupid is Max for leaving all the guns in the cab?

169
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,680
I mean, if it were me, I'd probably put the guns in some sort of bag and then take that

170
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,680
bag with me when I left the cab.

171
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,400
Luckily, Nux has a soft sand dune to land on when pushed out of a speeding war machine.

172
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,520
Is there in the desert?

173
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,160
What the fuck else is he supposed to land on?

174
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,680
Whatever you do, you can't be seen.

175
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,080
I'm supposed to be alone.

176
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,120
Didn't you just say,

177
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,000
I need you here.

178
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,280
You may have to drive the rig.

179
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,720
Those sound like contradictory statements.

180
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,720
They're not contradictory.

181
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,320
Furiosa's saying, stay here, but stay out of sight, which is exactly what Max does.

182
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,800
Lots of gunfire at this mostly fuel-carrying big rig result in a bunch of ricochets.

183
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,360
So if CinemaSins have been paying attention to the film,

184
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,640
they'd know that the tank itself is actually filled with milk.

185
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,280
What is this?

186
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,840
It's mother's milk.

187
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,600
At the start of the movie, Furiosa was supposed to go to Gas Town to trade.

188
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,760
Why would she be delivering a shipment of fuel to somewhere called Gas Town?

189
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,840
Guy who has dedicated his entire life to impressing Joe gives up totally and joins

190
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,720
the good guys because the power of sand boners is super strong.

191
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,720
So Nux has dedicated his entire life to impressing Joe,

192
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,200
and then he completely fails in front of Joe and Joe rejects him.

193
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,720
He saw it.

194
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,640
He saw it all.

195
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,320
This is the real reason that he changes sides,

196
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,920
not whatever the hell a sand boner is supposed to be.

197
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,680
This movie makes it seem like they drive way

198
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,160
further than a semi should be able to drive on one tank of gas.

199
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,520
So it's actually possible for semi trucks to drive for hundreds of miles on one tank of gas.

200
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,320
Now there's nothing wrong with not knowing that,

201
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,080
but remember CinemaSins think that the war rig is filled with fuel.

202
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,320
Lots of gunfire at this mostly fuel-carrying big rig result in a bunch of ricochets.

203
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,640
One tank of gas, mostly fuel-carrying big rig, those sound like contradictory statements.

204
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,680
Lead cars explode and the rest of the convoy immediately stops,

205
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,880
instead of going around or avoiding the semis tracks altogether.

206
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,800
I mean, you guys do realize there are no boundaries keeping you from going left or right, right?

207
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,480
So this scene is set in a swamp, and the reason

208
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:46,480
that the cars can't just drive around is because they will sink into the swamp.

209
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,520
Tiny tree has the ability to withstand... what was it, Furiosa?

210
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,640
You're sitting on 2000 horsepower of nitro-boosted war machine.

211
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,360
Sounds like a vehicle that needs that kind of power is probably super heavy.

212
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,320
The tree doesn't withstand the weight of the truck,

213
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,720
it gets torn out of the ground and falls over.

214
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,880
Not only that, the shot CinemaSins used to complain about it actually shows it falling over.

215
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,600
Tiny tree has the ability to withstand... what was it, Furiosa?

216
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,040
...without somehow getting sucked into the tornado itself.

217
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,840
Sounds like a vehicle that needs that kind of power is probably super heavy.

218
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,760
Those sound like contradictory statements.

219
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,480
Truck that was just struggling to drive in this sh** on a flat surface

220
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,320
is suddenly climbing sand hills with ease.

221
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,360
Okay, so the flat surface is actually a swamp,

222
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,760
and the reason that the truck can drive uphill is because it's driving to higher ground

223
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,560
that's drier than the swamp.

224
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,800
I don't think CinemaSins know what a swamp is.

225
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,480
There's high ground just beyond that thing.

226
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,840
He means the tree.

227
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,200
Yeah, tree.

228
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,960
Um, why the hell is this lookout naked?

229
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,480
Is there one good reason for that?

230
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,360
I'm not complaining, I'm just trying to figure out how that benefits the cause.

231
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,240
So this lookout isn't actually a lookout.

232
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,520
She's a trap.

233
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,840
Max spots this and comments on it as the war rig is driving up to the tower.

234
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,520
That's bait.

235
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,920
Max's flashbacks don't matter much to me or the film.

236
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,280
So the flashbacks are actually the key to understanding Max's character in the film.

237
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,240
At the beginning, he's haunted by these visions who say things like,

238
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,240
You let us die.

239
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,080
Where were you, Max?

240
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,280
You promised to help us.

241
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:27,040
Then later on, when Max is watching Furiosa drive away across the salt flats,

242
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,760
he hears one of these voices again.

243
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,240
Where are you?

244
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,320
And he sees a vision of somebody walking out into the desert,

245
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,720
and this is what changes his mind and makes him decide to help Furiosa,

246
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,320
because he sees it as a way to redeem himself for all the people that he hasn't helped in his past.

247
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,040
At least that way, you know, we might be able to,

248
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:57,940
together,

249
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,920
come across some kind of redemption.

250
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,360
There's also a flash forward or a premonition, I guess.

251
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,120
That's quite interesting.

252
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:32,160
But I guess none of that actually matters, eh, CinemaSins?

253
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:40,240
All completely, totally random, pointless decisions made for no reason.

254
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,160
So look, I totally agree that their decision to go back to the Citadel is something they needed to do,

255
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,440
but couldn't they have tried to be a little bit more discreet when they drove back the other way?

256
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,120
Maybe try to avoid being seen? Maybe even, I don't know, take a circular route?

257
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,760
They don't just want to go back to the Citadel,

258
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,040
they have to beat Joe back to the Citadel to take it,

259
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,080
and it's going to take weeks to take a circular route,

260
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,960
because the only direct path is back where they came.

261
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,640
It'll take two weeks to skirt the Wall of Mountains.

262
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,840
No, I suggest we go back the same way we came.

263
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,960
Through the canyon.

264
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,280
Now, in some respects, I completely sympathize with CinemaSins.

265
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,200
It is not easy to do what they do.

266
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,440
You have to watch the whole, the entire movie.

267
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,200
Gotta watch all of it.

268
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,040
You gotta pay attention to all the characters.

269
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,240
All these different characters all saying things and doing things.

270
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,640
These pogo assassins are really cool.

271
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,040
Why didn't they have these things earlier when they attacked the War Rig?

272
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,560
If you've been watching the movie, you'd know that the Polecats

273
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,800
all got trapped at the Canyon Pass when the pass gets blocked,

274
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,400
and they often had an opportunity to attack the War Rig until they caught up with it,

275
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,840
which is right now.

276
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,360
Wait, are you sure?

277
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,600
Is she strong enough to catch a falling Tom Hardy with one hand

278
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,200
while driving this massive war machine?

279
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,320
Well, since Furiosa catches Max with a robotic arm,

280
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,480
it doesn't really matter if she's strong enough.

281
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,400
All that matters is if her arm is attached to her tightly enough.

282
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,560
Also, if you look, you can see that Furiosa isn't actually the only character to catch Max,

283
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,120
because one of the wives is holding his other leg.

284
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,040
Good thing Poe left his jacket behind for no reason,

285
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,520
so that Finn could pick it up and be seen by BB-8 later.

286
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,800
If you watch the scene where Poe and Finn steal the TIE fighter,

287
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,080
Poe takes his jacket off shortly before they take off,

288
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,280
so it makes perfect sense for it to still be in the TIE fighter.

289
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:45,840
Thanks for watching!
