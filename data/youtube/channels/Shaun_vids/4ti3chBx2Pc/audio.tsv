0	5440	So I recently watched a YouTube video about the movie Mad Max Fury Road.
5440	10800	It was the Comic-Con trailer, which is a really good trailer, by the way.
10800	16960	But this made YouTube decide that all I ever want to watch is Mad Max videos, and...
16960	20320	Well, to their credit, that's right.
20320	23440	But one video it recommended to me was
23440	28720	Everything Wrong with Mad Max Fury Road by a channel called CinemaSins.
28720	34480	Now, I've never watched a video by CinemaSins before, but I watched this one,
34480	39280	and the first thing I noticed was that their audio seems a little weird.
39280	43360	My name is Max. My world is fire and blood.
43360	46800	And then they complain about Tom Hardy sounding unintelligible.
46800	49440	Also, Tom Hardy is forced to speak unintelligibly, cliche.
49440	54080	And I thought, that's odd, I don't remember him sounding like that in the actual movie,
54080	55200	so I went and checked.
55920	60880	My name is Max. My world is fire and blood.
60880	64800	My name is Max. My world is fire and blood.
64800	68960	I am the one who runs from both the living and the dead.
69600	74320	I am the one who runs from both the living and the dead.
74320	78480	Now, I don't know if this is something CinemaSins does for all of their videos,
78480	81920	but, you know, it's kind of unfair to edit the audio
81920	84880	and then complain about it sounding unintelligible.
85280	88560	So I thought, whatever, I'll watch the rest of the video,
88560	92720	and holy shit, these guys are wrong about nearly everything.
94640	97760	I don't understand it. Is it a joke that I'm not getting?
97760	100320	Is it, like, their gimmick?
100320	104320	Like, where CinemaSins, we get everything wrong on purpose?
105360	109440	I don't know, but I'll be honest, the video annoyed me.
109440	115760	It annoyed me that they were frequently wrong in very lazy ways.
115760	118640	It annoyed me that they often edited the footage
119520	123520	to obscure the fact that they were incorrect in a point they were making,
124480	126880	and it annoyed me enough to make this video.
136640	138720	Max is a dick to two-headed lizard things.
138720	140880	Max isn't being a dick to the lizard.
140880	144480	He doesn't stand on it because he thinks it's funny or whatever.
144480	147280	He actually eats the lizard in the next shot.
149680	152720	These cars made no sound until they made an appearance in the film.
152720	154080	This isn't a mistake.
154080	156960	The cars are supposed to surprise the audience,
156960	162560	and the sudden roar of the engine is a contrast to the silence of the desert.
162560	165840	If you watch the full scene, that's a lot more apparent.
168720	179840	So this is one of the weirder types of sins that CinemaSins like to do.
179840	185360	They just say what is happening on the screen and then give the movie a sin.
186240	187360	I don't get it.
187360	188480	They do it all the time.
188480	189360	Here's another one.
191520	193200	What's... what's that?
193200	194720	That's just what was happening?
194720	196400	What's... what's wrong with that?
196400	197520	Is that meant to be bad?
198720	206480	The guy's got the brand right there in front of Max's face.
206480	210000	How is that the mere distant idea of being branded?
210000	213360	It's... the branding is imminent.
213360	215680	Why are all these guys bald and painted white?
215680	217360	Movie has zero interest in explaining.
217920	222560	So the reason the movie never tells us why these guys are bald and painted white is because
222560	224000	it doesn't really matter.
224880	229280	What matters is that they're all part of a cult and they all look the same.
229280	234400	They could paint themselves red or blue and the effect would be the same.
235760	240000	At a stretch, you could say that they paint themselves white because Joe needs that white
240000	244240	powder blown on himself to stop from getting sick or whatever that was.
244960	246400	But that's just guessing.
246960	252000	The real reason the movie doesn't get bogged down in a lot of unnecessary exposition is
252000	254800	that it's really, really good.
254800	257440	Wait, when did these guys get crane hook pulling hooks?
257440	260160	Did they know they need them while they were mindlessly chasing after Max?
260160	264480	Or maybe they just keep it behind that door because that's where they need to use it to
264480	265600	grab the crane hook.
266400	270320	In fact, you can actually see the hooks behind the door in a previous shot.
271360	275120	Okay, first of all, how's the region's water somehow located and contained a dozen stories
275120	276080	up on a rock thingy?
276080	278160	Doesn't this defy all science and gravity knowledge?
278160	282640	Well, since the water's coming out of pipes, I think it's safe to assume that it's being
282640	284720	pumped there from somewhere else.
285520	291520	It's safe to assume this from now all the way until a later scene when the movie just
291520	294080	tells you how the water gets there.
294080	295120	Where does the water come from?
295120	296880	He pumps it up from deep in the earth.
296880	300000	Second of all, this is the least efficient water gifting system ever invented.
300000	303600	I realize he's a dickhead, but he's literally wasting 90% of the water he's releasing right
303600	304160	now.
304160	307360	Okay, so Joe is wasting the water on purpose.
307920	314800	This scene is meant to show us that he's cruel, he's a tyrant, he's got no respect for the
314800	318560	people who depend on him to live, and no respect for water.
318560	323360	And this is spelled out quite explicitly in Joe's dialogue in the scene.
325120	329120	Do not, my friends, become addicted to water.
329760	334640	It will take hold of you, and you will resent its absence.
334640	341280	The point of this scene is to establish Joe as the antagonist, and that really wouldn't
341280	346080	work for the audience if they saw him being a kind and considerate person.
346080	348240	Your produce ain't turnin' to Gastown.
348240	351760	Why didn't Furiosa wait until she was completely out of view before she made that turn?
351760	356480	If you watch literally the next five seconds of the movie, you get to see through that
356480	361120	telescope, and you can see all the way to Gastown from Joe's Citadel.
361120	365200	Whoa, this society of criminal assholes takes one of the few universal donors they come
365200	369040	across and straps him to the spiky front of a war vehicle headed into battle, because
369040	370000	why again?
370000	374960	Okay, so first of all, there's absolutely no indication in the film how many universal
374960	376320	donors these guys have.
376320	380400	They might have a dozen of them, all tied up in cages back at the Citadel.
381120	381680	Who knows?
382400	386720	Second of all, they're all crazy, and it would be completely in character for them to do
386720	390880	something as irrational as tie one of their universal donors.
391120	392080	To the front of a car.
392640	399840	Max is specifically there, though, to give blood to Nux, and the shot makes this very
399840	400240	clear.
400240	406720	It follows the tube from Max's neck, down the chain, and into Nux's arm.
406720	410000	These flames would definitely have already killed this back riding asshole, if only due
410000	410560	to wind.
410560	412720	Not to mention how hot all the metal he's touching would be.
412720	416880	If you watch the full shot, you can see that the flames have only been on for about one
416880	417280	second.
418000	422720	He's positioned in front of them, and the wind is blowing them backwards away from him.
422720	426960	This porcupine car is useful only if attacked by stabable flesh-based human things.
426960	429920	Otherwise, just throw a gasoline water balloon at it and set the fire.
429920	430560	I mean, right?
430560	435840	How many times do we see one person jump from a moving vehicle onto another in this film?
435840	442320	It seems like defending yourself against stabable flesh-based human things would be a priority.
442320	445840	This semi is able to drive close enough to a sand lightning tornado to push this other
445840	449840	nearby vehicle into oblivion, without somehow getting sucked into the tornado itself.
449840	452160	So I had no idea about this at all.
452160	460720	So I went on Google, I read a few articles, I did a few hours of research, and it turns
460720	465600	out that the big semi trucks, they're heavier than cars.
466160	467440	Cars are a lot smaller.
469680	472880	Also, since these women were all locked up in a harem vault, why was there ever a need
472880	473760	for such things?
473760	478880	Well, the women were all locked up in the vault, and then they escaped.
479840	489920	So one example for an instance of such things being needed, at least in Joe's mind, is the
489920	493520	events that are currently occurring in the film.
493520	495040	How the f*** did these assholes find them?
495040	497920	They just went through a sandstorm where everybody who chased them either died or got knocked
497920	498480	unconscious.
498480	500400	What kind of tracks did they leave that led them here?
500400	503840	They haven't left any tracks because they actually haven't moved.
504800	509760	If you remember when Max wakes up at the crash site, he can see the war rig from where he
509760	512240	is, implying that no one's really went very far.
512880	516080	All that's changed is that the storm has begun to lift.
516080	519120	You know, just in case I'm hanging around outside my trunk with no weapons, I've got
519120	521440	this hide-a-gun thing here in case of emergencies.
521440	526160	For instance, an emergency like right now when I'm being attacked outside the truck.
526160	529440	I mean, Furiosa has hidden guns all over the truck.
529440	531520	What's the problem with having one on the outside?
533600	537040	That's the second time since he took possession of this gun that he's fired three shots to
537040	538320	stop someone in their tracks.
538320	539600	How many does he have left?
539600	542400	And why is he so f***ing wasteful of the precious few bullets he has?
542400	545280	Does he need to fire three times as a warning twice?
545280	552720	Okay, so Max was run off the road, taken prisoner, forcibly tattooed, locked in a cage, tied
552720	553920	to the front of a car.
553920	563280	He was in another car crash, and then he was just in a fight, and he's a little bit, sort
563280	566400	of, I guess he's irrational.
566400	570720	Maybe he's a little bit, he's, you know, it-
570720	574560	All the legs you had to shoot, that one was attached to his favorite.
574560	577120	What, are you going to tell him Max was the one responsible for it?
577120	578080	Why would you do that?
578080	580640	And why is he in any more danger than he was in already?
580640	582400	Such an odd, odd thing to say.
582400	587440	Okay, so initially, Max didn't want to let Furiosa and the wives into the truck, and
587440	591600	he was going to just wait and hand them over to Joe in exchange for his freedom.
592320	592960	So we wait.
595600	599680	Then Furiosa hops onto the truck and tries to convince Max to let them in.
602400	605120	You're relying on the gratitude of a very bad man.
605120	608080	You've already damaged one of his wives, how grateful do you think he's gonna be?
608720	612560	So yes, the wives are going to tell Joe.
612560	614880	Max was the one responsible for it.
614880	616000	It's a threat.
616000	618560	He's in danger because the wives are saying,
618560	623200	if you hand us over, we'll tell Joe you shot one of us and he'll kill you.
624160	627760	Yeah, but don't you now leave all the women alone up here with all those weapons you meticulously
627760	629120	took out of their reach a minute ago?
629120	632320	Yeah, how stupid is Max for leaving all the guns in the cab?
632320	637680	I mean, if it were me, I'd probably put the guns in some sort of bag and then take that
637680	639680	bag with me when I left the cab.
642560	646400	Luckily, Nux has a soft sand dune to land on when pushed out of a speeding war machine.
646400	647520	Is there in the desert?
647520	650160	What the fuck else is he supposed to land on?
650160	651680	Whatever you do, you can't be seen.
652880	654080	I'm supposed to be alone.
654080	655120	Didn't you just say,
655120	656000	I need you here.
656000	657280	You may have to drive the rig.
657280	658720	Those sound like contradictory statements.
659280	660720	They're not contradictory.
660720	666320	Furiosa's saying, stay here, but stay out of sight, which is exactly what Max does.
666400	670800	Lots of gunfire at this mostly fuel-carrying big rig result in a bunch of ricochets.
670800	673360	So if CinemaSins have been paying attention to the film,
673360	676640	they'd know that the tank itself is actually filled with milk.
676640	677280	What is this?
678960	679840	It's mother's milk.
682800	687600	At the start of the movie, Furiosa was supposed to go to Gas Town to trade.
687600	691760	Why would she be delivering a shipment of fuel to somewhere called Gas Town?
691760	695840	Guy who has dedicated his entire life to impressing Joe gives up totally and joins
695840	698720	the good guys because the power of sand boners is super strong.
698720	702720	So Nux has dedicated his entire life to impressing Joe,
702720	707200	and then he completely fails in front of Joe and Joe rejects him.
710000	710720	He saw it.
711840	712640	He saw it all.
713600	716320	This is the real reason that he changes sides,
716320	719920	not whatever the hell a sand boner is supposed to be.
719920	721680	This movie makes it seem like they drive way
721680	724160	further than a semi should be able to drive on one tank of gas.
724720	729520	So it's actually possible for semi trucks to drive for hundreds of miles on one tank of gas.
730320	732320	Now there's nothing wrong with not knowing that,
732320	736080	but remember CinemaSins think that the war rig is filled with fuel.
736080	740320	Lots of gunfire at this mostly fuel-carrying big rig result in a bunch of ricochets.
740320	744640	One tank of gas, mostly fuel-carrying big rig, those sound like contradictory statements.
744640	747680	Lead cars explode and the rest of the convoy immediately stops,
747680	750880	instead of going around or avoiding the semis tracks altogether.
750960	754800	I mean, you guys do realize there are no boundaries keeping you from going left or right, right?
755520	758480	So this scene is set in a swamp, and the reason
760080	766480	that the cars can't just drive around is because they will sink into the swamp.
768720	771520	Tiny tree has the ability to withstand... what was it, Furiosa?
771520	774640	You're sitting on 2000 horsepower of nitro-boosted war machine.
774640	777360	Sounds like a vehicle that needs that kind of power is probably super heavy.
777920	780320	The tree doesn't withstand the weight of the truck,
780320	782720	it gets torn out of the ground and falls over.
783600	788880	Not only that, the shot CinemaSins used to complain about it actually shows it falling over.
788880	791600	Tiny tree has the ability to withstand... what was it, Furiosa?
792880	795040	...without somehow getting sucked into the tornado itself.
795040	797840	Sounds like a vehicle that needs that kind of power is probably super heavy.
797840	799760	Those sound like contradictory statements.
799760	802480	Truck that was just struggling to drive in this sh** on a flat surface
802480	804320	is suddenly climbing sand hills with ease.
804320	807360	Okay, so the flat surface is actually a swamp,
807360	813760	and the reason that the truck can drive uphill is because it's driving to higher ground
816080	818560	that's drier than the swamp.
818560	820800	I don't think CinemaSins know what a swamp is.
822560	824480	There's high ground just beyond that thing.
824480	825840	He means the tree.
825840	827200	Yeah, tree.
827200	828960	Um, why the hell is this lookout naked?
828960	830480	Is there one good reason for that?
830480	833360	I'm not complaining, I'm just trying to figure out how that benefits the cause.
833360	836240	So this lookout isn't actually a lookout.
836240	837520	She's a trap.
837520	841840	Max spots this and comments on it as the war rig is driving up to the tower.
842560	843520	That's bait.
843520	845920	Max's flashbacks don't matter much to me or the film.
845920	851280	So the flashbacks are actually the key to understanding Max's character in the film.
851280	856240	At the beginning, he's haunted by these visions who say things like,
857280	858240	You let us die.
859040	860080	Where were you, Max?
860080	861280	You promised to help us.
861840	867040	Then later on, when Max is watching Furiosa drive away across the salt flats,
867040	869760	he hears one of these voices again.
875520	876240	Where are you?
877360	882320	And he sees a vision of somebody walking out into the desert,
882320	886720	and this is what changes his mind and makes him decide to help Furiosa,
886720	892320	because he sees it as a way to redeem himself for all the people that he hasn't helped in his past.
893040	895040	At least that way, you know, we might be able to,
897440	897940	together,
900160	901920	come across some kind of redemption.
904320	909360	There's also a flash forward or a premonition, I guess.
909920	911120	That's quite interesting.
911120	932160	But I guess none of that actually matters, eh, CinemaSins?
933200	940240	All completely, totally random, pointless decisions made for no reason.
940240	944160	So look, I totally agree that their decision to go back to the Citadel is something they needed to do,
944160	947440	but couldn't they have tried to be a little bit more discreet when they drove back the other way?
947440	951120	Maybe try to avoid being seen? Maybe even, I don't know, take a circular route?
951120	953760	They don't just want to go back to the Citadel,
953760	957040	they have to beat Joe back to the Citadel to take it,
957040	960080	and it's going to take weeks to take a circular route,
960080	962960	because the only direct path is back where they came.
964000	966640	It'll take two weeks to skirt the Wall of Mountains.
966640	969840	No, I suggest we go back the same way we came.
970240	972960	Through the canyon.
973600	977280	Now, in some respects, I completely sympathize with CinemaSins.
977280	979200	It is not easy to do what they do.
980160	983440	You have to watch the whole, the entire movie.
984160	985200	Gotta watch all of it.
985840	989040	You gotta pay attention to all the characters.
990400	994240	All these different characters all saying things and doing things.
994800	996640	These pogo assassins are really cool.
996640	999040	Why didn't they have these things earlier when they attacked the War Rig?
999040	1002560	If you've been watching the movie, you'd know that the Polecats
1002560	1006800	all got trapped at the Canyon Pass when the pass gets blocked,
1006800	1010400	and they often had an opportunity to attack the War Rig until they caught up with it,
1010400	1011840	which is right now.
1011840	1013360	Wait, are you sure?
1013360	1015600	Is she strong enough to catch a falling Tom Hardy with one hand
1015600	1017200	while driving this massive war machine?
1017200	1020320	Well, since Furiosa catches Max with a robotic arm,
1020320	1022480	it doesn't really matter if she's strong enough.
1022480	1026400	All that matters is if her arm is attached to her tightly enough.
1026400	1032560	Also, if you look, you can see that Furiosa isn't actually the only character to catch Max,
1032560	1035120	because one of the wives is holding his other leg.
1035120	1037040	Good thing Poe left his jacket behind for no reason,
1037040	1039520	so that Finn could pick it up and be seen by BB-8 later.
1039520	1042800	If you watch the scene where Poe and Finn steal the TIE fighter,
1042800	1046080	Poe takes his jacket off shortly before they take off,
1046080	1049280	so it makes perfect sense for it to still be in the TIE fighter.
1056400	1065840	Thanks for watching!
