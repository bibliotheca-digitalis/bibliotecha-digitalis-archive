00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
So I recently watched a YouTube video about the movie Mad Max Fury Road.

00:05.440 --> 00:10.800
It was the Comic-Con trailer, which is a really good trailer, by the way.

00:10.800 --> 00:16.960
But this made YouTube decide that all I ever want to watch is Mad Max videos, and...

00:16.960 --> 00:20.320
Well, to their credit, that's right.

00:20.320 --> 00:23.440
But one video it recommended to me was

00:23.440 --> 00:28.720
Everything Wrong with Mad Max Fury Road by a channel called CinemaSins.

00:28.720 --> 00:34.480
Now, I've never watched a video by CinemaSins before, but I watched this one,

00:34.480 --> 00:39.280
and the first thing I noticed was that their audio seems a little weird.

00:39.280 --> 00:43.360
My name is Max. My world is fire and blood.

00:43.360 --> 00:46.800
And then they complain about Tom Hardy sounding unintelligible.

00:46.800 --> 00:49.440
Also, Tom Hardy is forced to speak unintelligibly, cliche.

00:49.440 --> 00:54.080
And I thought, that's odd, I don't remember him sounding like that in the actual movie,

00:54.080 --> 00:55.200
so I went and checked.

00:55.920 --> 01:00.880
My name is Max. My world is fire and blood.

01:00.880 --> 01:04.800
My name is Max. My world is fire and blood.

01:04.800 --> 01:08.960
I am the one who runs from both the living and the dead.

01:09.600 --> 01:14.320
I am the one who runs from both the living and the dead.

01:14.320 --> 01:18.480
Now, I don't know if this is something CinemaSins does for all of their videos,

01:18.480 --> 01:21.920
but, you know, it's kind of unfair to edit the audio

01:21.920 --> 01:24.880
and then complain about it sounding unintelligible.

01:25.280 --> 01:28.560
So I thought, whatever, I'll watch the rest of the video,

01:28.560 --> 01:32.720
and holy shit, these guys are wrong about nearly everything.

01:34.640 --> 01:37.760
I don't understand it. Is it a joke that I'm not getting?

01:37.760 --> 01:40.320
Is it, like, their gimmick?

01:40.320 --> 01:44.320
Like, where CinemaSins, we get everything wrong on purpose?

01:45.360 --> 01:49.440
I don't know, but I'll be honest, the video annoyed me.

01:49.440 --> 01:55.760
It annoyed me that they were frequently wrong in very lazy ways.

01:55.760 --> 01:58.640
It annoyed me that they often edited the footage

01:59.520 --> 02:03.520
to obscure the fact that they were incorrect in a point they were making,

02:04.480 --> 02:06.880
and it annoyed me enough to make this video.

02:16.640 --> 02:18.720
Max is a dick to two-headed lizard things.

02:18.720 --> 02:20.880
Max isn't being a dick to the lizard.

02:20.880 --> 02:24.480
He doesn't stand on it because he thinks it's funny or whatever.

02:24.480 --> 02:27.280
He actually eats the lizard in the next shot.

02:29.680 --> 02:32.720
These cars made no sound until they made an appearance in the film.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.080
This isn't a mistake.

02:34.080 --> 02:36.960
The cars are supposed to surprise the audience,

02:36.960 --> 02:42.560
and the sudden roar of the engine is a contrast to the silence of the desert.

02:42.560 --> 02:45.840
If you watch the full scene, that's a lot more apparent.

02:48.720 --> 02:59.840
So this is one of the weirder types of sins that CinemaSins like to do.

02:59.840 --> 03:05.360
They just say what is happening on the screen and then give the movie a sin.

03:06.240 --> 03:07.360
I don't get it.

03:07.360 --> 03:08.480
They do it all the time.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.360
Here's another one.

03:11.520 --> 03:13.200
What's... what's that?

03:13.200 --> 03:14.720
That's just what was happening?

03:14.720 --> 03:16.400
What's... what's wrong with that?

03:16.400 --> 03:17.520
Is that meant to be bad?

03:18.720 --> 03:26.480
The guy's got the brand right there in front of Max's face.

03:26.480 --> 03:30.000
How is that the mere distant idea of being branded?

03:30.000 --> 03:33.360
It's... the branding is imminent.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.680
Why are all these guys bald and painted white?

03:35.680 --> 03:37.360
Movie has zero interest in explaining.

03:37.920 --> 03:42.560
So the reason the movie never tells us why these guys are bald and painted white is because

03:42.560 --> 03:44.000
it doesn't really matter.

03:44.880 --> 03:49.280
What matters is that they're all part of a cult and they all look the same.

03:49.280 --> 03:54.400
They could paint themselves red or blue and the effect would be the same.

03:55.760 --> 04:00.000
At a stretch, you could say that they paint themselves white because Joe needs that white

04:00.000 --> 04:04.240
powder blown on himself to stop from getting sick or whatever that was.

04:04.960 --> 04:06.400
But that's just guessing.

04:06.960 --> 04:12.000
The real reason the movie doesn't get bogged down in a lot of unnecessary exposition is

04:12.000 --> 04:14.800
that it's really, really good.

04:14.800 --> 04:17.440
Wait, when did these guys get crane hook pulling hooks?

04:17.440 --> 04:20.160
Did they know they need them while they were mindlessly chasing after Max?

04:20.160 --> 04:24.480
Or maybe they just keep it behind that door because that's where they need to use it to

04:24.480 --> 04:25.600
grab the crane hook.

04:26.400 --> 04:30.320
In fact, you can actually see the hooks behind the door in a previous shot.

04:31.360 --> 04:35.120
Okay, first of all, how's the region's water somehow located and contained a dozen stories

04:35.120 --> 04:36.080
up on a rock thingy?

04:36.080 --> 04:38.160
Doesn't this defy all science and gravity knowledge?

04:38.160 --> 04:42.640
Well, since the water's coming out of pipes, I think it's safe to assume that it's being

04:42.640 --> 04:44.720
pumped there from somewhere else.

04:45.520 --> 04:51.520
It's safe to assume this from now all the way until a later scene when the movie just

04:51.520 --> 04:54.080
tells you how the water gets there.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.120
Where does the water come from?

04:55.120 --> 04:56.880
He pumps it up from deep in the earth.

04:56.880 --> 05:00.000
Second of all, this is the least efficient water gifting system ever invented.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.600
I realize he's a dickhead, but he's literally wasting 90% of the water he's releasing right

05:03.600 --> 05:04.160
now.

05:04.160 --> 05:07.360
Okay, so Joe is wasting the water on purpose.

05:07.920 --> 05:14.800
This scene is meant to show us that he's cruel, he's a tyrant, he's got no respect for the

05:14.800 --> 05:18.560
people who depend on him to live, and no respect for water.

05:18.560 --> 05:23.360
And this is spelled out quite explicitly in Joe's dialogue in the scene.

05:25.120 --> 05:29.120
Do not, my friends, become addicted to water.

05:29.760 --> 05:34.640
It will take hold of you, and you will resent its absence.

05:34.640 --> 05:41.280
The point of this scene is to establish Joe as the antagonist, and that really wouldn't

05:41.280 --> 05:46.080
work for the audience if they saw him being a kind and considerate person.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.240
Your produce ain't turnin' to Gastown.

05:48.240 --> 05:51.760
Why didn't Furiosa wait until she was completely out of view before she made that turn?

05:51.760 --> 05:56.480
If you watch literally the next five seconds of the movie, you get to see through that

05:56.480 --> 06:01.120
telescope, and you can see all the way to Gastown from Joe's Citadel.

06:01.120 --> 06:05.200
Whoa, this society of criminal assholes takes one of the few universal donors they come

06:05.200 --> 06:09.040
across and straps him to the spiky front of a war vehicle headed into battle, because

06:09.040 --> 06:10.000
why again?

06:10.000 --> 06:14.960
Okay, so first of all, there's absolutely no indication in the film how many universal

06:14.960 --> 06:16.320
donors these guys have.

06:16.320 --> 06:20.400
They might have a dozen of them, all tied up in cages back at the Citadel.

06:21.120 --> 06:21.680
Who knows?

06:22.400 --> 06:26.720
Second of all, they're all crazy, and it would be completely in character for them to do

06:26.720 --> 06:30.880
something as irrational as tie one of their universal donors.

06:31.120 --> 06:32.080
To the front of a car.

06:32.640 --> 06:39.840
Max is specifically there, though, to give blood to Nux, and the shot makes this very

06:39.840 --> 06:40.240
clear.

06:40.240 --> 06:46.720
It follows the tube from Max's neck, down the chain, and into Nux's arm.

06:46.720 --> 06:50.000
These flames would definitely have already killed this back riding asshole, if only due

06:50.000 --> 06:50.560
to wind.

06:50.560 --> 06:52.720
Not to mention how hot all the metal he's touching would be.

06:52.720 --> 06:56.880
If you watch the full shot, you can see that the flames have only been on for about one

06:56.880 --> 06:57.280
second.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.720
He's positioned in front of them, and the wind is blowing them backwards away from him.

07:02.720 --> 07:06.960
This porcupine car is useful only if attacked by stabable flesh-based human things.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.920
Otherwise, just throw a gasoline water balloon at it and set the fire.

07:09.920 --> 07:10.560
I mean, right?

07:10.560 --> 07:15.840
How many times do we see one person jump from a moving vehicle onto another in this film?

07:15.840 --> 07:22.320
It seems like defending yourself against stabable flesh-based human things would be a priority.

07:22.320 --> 07:25.840
This semi is able to drive close enough to a sand lightning tornado to push this other

07:25.840 --> 07:29.840
nearby vehicle into oblivion, without somehow getting sucked into the tornado itself.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.160
So I had no idea about this at all.

07:32.160 --> 07:40.720
So I went on Google, I read a few articles, I did a few hours of research, and it turns

07:40.720 --> 07:45.600
out that the big semi trucks, they're heavier than cars.

07:46.160 --> 07:47.440
Cars are a lot smaller.

07:49.680 --> 07:52.880
Also, since these women were all locked up in a harem vault, why was there ever a need

07:52.880 --> 07:53.760
for such things?

07:53.760 --> 07:58.880
Well, the women were all locked up in the vault, and then they escaped.

07:59.840 --> 08:09.920
So one example for an instance of such things being needed, at least in Joe's mind, is the

08:09.920 --> 08:13.520
events that are currently occurring in the film.

08:13.520 --> 08:15.040
How the f*** did these assholes find them?

08:15.040 --> 08:17.920
They just went through a sandstorm where everybody who chased them either died or got knocked

08:17.920 --> 08:18.480
unconscious.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.400
What kind of tracks did they leave that led them here?

08:20.400 --> 08:23.840
They haven't left any tracks because they actually haven't moved.

08:24.800 --> 08:29.760
If you remember when Max wakes up at the crash site, he can see the war rig from where he

08:29.760 --> 08:32.240
is, implying that no one's really went very far.

08:32.880 --> 08:36.080
All that's changed is that the storm has begun to lift.

08:36.080 --> 08:39.120
You know, just in case I'm hanging around outside my trunk with no weapons, I've got

08:39.120 --> 08:41.440
this hide-a-gun thing here in case of emergencies.

08:41.440 --> 08:46.160
For instance, an emergency like right now when I'm being attacked outside the truck.

08:46.160 --> 08:49.440
I mean, Furiosa has hidden guns all over the truck.

08:49.440 --> 08:51.520
What's the problem with having one on the outside?

08:53.600 --> 08:57.040
That's the second time since he took possession of this gun that he's fired three shots to

08:57.040 --> 08:58.320
stop someone in their tracks.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.600
How many does he have left?

08:59.600 --> 09:02.400
And why is he so f***ing wasteful of the precious few bullets he has?

09:02.400 --> 09:05.280
Does he need to fire three times as a warning twice?

09:05.280 --> 09:12.720
Okay, so Max was run off the road, taken prisoner, forcibly tattooed, locked in a cage, tied

09:12.720 --> 09:13.920
to the front of a car.

09:13.920 --> 09:23.280
He was in another car crash, and then he was just in a fight, and he's a little bit, sort

09:23.280 --> 09:26.400
of, I guess he's irrational.

09:26.400 --> 09:30.720
Maybe he's a little bit, he's, you know, it-

09:30.720 --> 09:34.560
All the legs you had to shoot, that one was attached to his favorite.

09:34.560 --> 09:37.120
What, are you going to tell him Max was the one responsible for it?

09:37.120 --> 09:38.080
Why would you do that?

09:38.080 --> 09:40.640
And why is he in any more danger than he was in already?

09:40.640 --> 09:42.400
Such an odd, odd thing to say.

09:42.400 --> 09:47.440
Okay, so initially, Max didn't want to let Furiosa and the wives into the truck, and

09:47.440 --> 09:51.600
he was going to just wait and hand them over to Joe in exchange for his freedom.

09:52.320 --> 09:52.960
So we wait.

09:55.600 --> 09:59.680
Then Furiosa hops onto the truck and tries to convince Max to let them in.

10:02.400 --> 10:05.120
You're relying on the gratitude of a very bad man.

10:05.120 --> 10:08.080
You've already damaged one of his wives, how grateful do you think he's gonna be?

10:08.720 --> 10:12.560
So yes, the wives are going to tell Joe.

10:12.560 --> 10:14.880
Max was the one responsible for it.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.000
It's a threat.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.560
He's in danger because the wives are saying,

10:18.560 --> 10:23.200
if you hand us over, we'll tell Joe you shot one of us and he'll kill you.

10:24.160 --> 10:27.760
Yeah, but don't you now leave all the women alone up here with all those weapons you meticulously

10:27.760 --> 10:29.120
took out of their reach a minute ago?

10:29.120 --> 10:32.320
Yeah, how stupid is Max for leaving all the guns in the cab?

10:32.320 --> 10:37.680
I mean, if it were me, I'd probably put the guns in some sort of bag and then take that

10:37.680 --> 10:39.680
bag with me when I left the cab.

10:42.560 --> 10:46.400
Luckily, Nux has a soft sand dune to land on when pushed out of a speeding war machine.

10:46.400 --> 10:47.520
Is there in the desert?

10:47.520 --> 10:50.160
What the fuck else is he supposed to land on?

10:50.160 --> 10:51.680
Whatever you do, you can't be seen.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.080
I'm supposed to be alone.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.120
Didn't you just say,

10:55.120 --> 10:56.000
I need you here.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.280
You may have to drive the rig.

10:57.280 --> 10:58.720
Those sound like contradictory statements.

10:59.280 --> 11:00.720
They're not contradictory.

11:00.720 --> 11:06.320
Furiosa's saying, stay here, but stay out of sight, which is exactly what Max does.

11:06.400 --> 11:10.800
Lots of gunfire at this mostly fuel-carrying big rig result in a bunch of ricochets.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.360
So if CinemaSins have been paying attention to the film,

11:13.360 --> 11:16.640
they'd know that the tank itself is actually filled with milk.

11:16.640 --> 11:17.280
What is this?

11:18.960 --> 11:19.840
It's mother's milk.

11:22.800 --> 11:27.600
At the start of the movie, Furiosa was supposed to go to Gas Town to trade.

11:27.600 --> 11:31.760
Why would she be delivering a shipment of fuel to somewhere called Gas Town?

11:31.760 --> 11:35.840
Guy who has dedicated his entire life to impressing Joe gives up totally and joins

11:35.840 --> 11:38.720
the good guys because the power of sand boners is super strong.

11:38.720 --> 11:42.720
So Nux has dedicated his entire life to impressing Joe,

11:42.720 --> 11:47.200
and then he completely fails in front of Joe and Joe rejects him.

11:50.000 --> 11:50.720
He saw it.

11:51.840 --> 11:52.640
He saw it all.

11:53.600 --> 11:56.320
This is the real reason that he changes sides,

11:56.320 --> 11:59.920
not whatever the hell a sand boner is supposed to be.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.680
This movie makes it seem like they drive way

12:01.680 --> 12:04.160
further than a semi should be able to drive on one tank of gas.

12:04.720 --> 12:09.520
So it's actually possible for semi trucks to drive for hundreds of miles on one tank of gas.

12:10.320 --> 12:12.320
Now there's nothing wrong with not knowing that,

12:12.320 --> 12:16.080
but remember CinemaSins think that the war rig is filled with fuel.

12:16.080 --> 12:20.320
Lots of gunfire at this mostly fuel-carrying big rig result in a bunch of ricochets.

12:20.320 --> 12:24.640
One tank of gas, mostly fuel-carrying big rig, those sound like contradictory statements.

12:24.640 --> 12:27.680
Lead cars explode and the rest of the convoy immediately stops,

12:27.680 --> 12:30.880
instead of going around or avoiding the semis tracks altogether.

12:30.960 --> 12:34.800
I mean, you guys do realize there are no boundaries keeping you from going left or right, right?

12:35.520 --> 12:38.480
So this scene is set in a swamp, and the reason

12:40.080 --> 12:46.480
that the cars can't just drive around is because they will sink into the swamp.

12:48.720 --> 12:51.520
Tiny tree has the ability to withstand... what was it, Furiosa?

12:51.520 --> 12:54.640
You're sitting on 2000 horsepower of nitro-boosted war machine.

12:54.640 --> 12:57.360
Sounds like a vehicle that needs that kind of power is probably super heavy.

12:57.920 --> 13:00.320
The tree doesn't withstand the weight of the truck,

13:00.320 --> 13:02.720
it gets torn out of the ground and falls over.

13:03.600 --> 13:08.880
Not only that, the shot CinemaSins used to complain about it actually shows it falling over.

13:08.880 --> 13:11.600
Tiny tree has the ability to withstand... what was it, Furiosa?

13:12.880 --> 13:15.040
...without somehow getting sucked into the tornado itself.

13:15.040 --> 13:17.840
Sounds like a vehicle that needs that kind of power is probably super heavy.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.760
Those sound like contradictory statements.

13:19.760 --> 13:22.480
Truck that was just struggling to drive in this sh** on a flat surface

13:22.480 --> 13:24.320
is suddenly climbing sand hills with ease.

13:24.320 --> 13:27.360
Okay, so the flat surface is actually a swamp,

13:27.360 --> 13:33.760
and the reason that the truck can drive uphill is because it's driving to higher ground

13:36.080 --> 13:38.560
that's drier than the swamp.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.800
I don't think CinemaSins know what a swamp is.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.480
There's high ground just beyond that thing.

13:44.480 --> 13:45.840
He means the tree.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.200
Yeah, tree.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.960
Um, why the hell is this lookout naked?

13:48.960 --> 13:50.480
Is there one good reason for that?

13:50.480 --> 13:53.360
I'm not complaining, I'm just trying to figure out how that benefits the cause.

13:53.360 --> 13:56.240
So this lookout isn't actually a lookout.

13:56.240 --> 13:57.520
She's a trap.

13:57.520 --> 14:01.840
Max spots this and comments on it as the war rig is driving up to the tower.

14:02.560 --> 14:03.520
That's bait.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.920
Max's flashbacks don't matter much to me or the film.

14:05.920 --> 14:11.280
So the flashbacks are actually the key to understanding Max's character in the film.

14:11.280 --> 14:16.240
At the beginning, he's haunted by these visions who say things like,

14:17.280 --> 14:18.240
You let us die.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.080
Where were you, Max?

14:20.080 --> 14:21.280
You promised to help us.

14:21.840 --> 14:27.040
Then later on, when Max is watching Furiosa drive away across the salt flats,

14:27.040 --> 14:29.760
he hears one of these voices again.

14:35.520 --> 14:36.240
Where are you?

14:37.360 --> 14:42.320
And he sees a vision of somebody walking out into the desert,

14:42.320 --> 14:46.720
and this is what changes his mind and makes him decide to help Furiosa,

14:46.720 --> 14:52.320
because he sees it as a way to redeem himself for all the people that he hasn't helped in his past.

14:53.040 --> 14:55.040
At least that way, you know, we might be able to,

14:57.440 --> 14:57.940
together,

15:00.160 --> 15:01.920
come across some kind of redemption.

15:04.320 --> 15:09.360
There's also a flash forward or a premonition, I guess.

15:09.920 --> 15:11.120
That's quite interesting.

15:11.120 --> 15:32.160
But I guess none of that actually matters, eh, CinemaSins?

15:33.200 --> 15:40.240
All completely, totally random, pointless decisions made for no reason.

15:40.240 --> 15:44.160
So look, I totally agree that their decision to go back to the Citadel is something they needed to do,

15:44.160 --> 15:47.440
but couldn't they have tried to be a little bit more discreet when they drove back the other way?

15:47.440 --> 15:51.120
Maybe try to avoid being seen? Maybe even, I don't know, take a circular route?

15:51.120 --> 15:53.760
They don't just want to go back to the Citadel,

15:53.760 --> 15:57.040
they have to beat Joe back to the Citadel to take it,

15:57.040 --> 16:00.080
and it's going to take weeks to take a circular route,

16:00.080 --> 16:02.960
because the only direct path is back where they came.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.640
It'll take two weeks to skirt the Wall of Mountains.

16:06.640 --> 16:09.840
No, I suggest we go back the same way we came.

16:10.240 --> 16:12.960
Through the canyon.

16:13.600 --> 16:17.280
Now, in some respects, I completely sympathize with CinemaSins.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.200
It is not easy to do what they do.

16:20.160 --> 16:23.440
You have to watch the whole, the entire movie.

16:24.160 --> 16:25.200
Gotta watch all of it.

16:25.840 --> 16:29.040
You gotta pay attention to all the characters.

16:30.400 --> 16:34.240
All these different characters all saying things and doing things.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.640
These pogo assassins are really cool.

16:36.640 --> 16:39.040
Why didn't they have these things earlier when they attacked the War Rig?

16:39.040 --> 16:42.560
If you've been watching the movie, you'd know that the Polecats

16:42.560 --> 16:46.800
all got trapped at the Canyon Pass when the pass gets blocked,

16:46.800 --> 16:50.400
and they often had an opportunity to attack the War Rig until they caught up with it,

16:50.400 --> 16:51.840
which is right now.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.360
Wait, are you sure?

16:53.360 --> 16:55.600
Is she strong enough to catch a falling Tom Hardy with one hand

16:55.600 --> 16:57.200
while driving this massive war machine?

16:57.200 --> 17:00.320
Well, since Furiosa catches Max with a robotic arm,

17:00.320 --> 17:02.480
it doesn't really matter if she's strong enough.

17:02.480 --> 17:06.400
All that matters is if her arm is attached to her tightly enough.

17:06.400 --> 17:12.560
Also, if you look, you can see that Furiosa isn't actually the only character to catch Max,

17:12.560 --> 17:15.120
because one of the wives is holding his other leg.

17:15.120 --> 17:17.040
Good thing Poe left his jacket behind for no reason,

17:17.040 --> 17:19.520
so that Finn could pick it up and be seen by BB-8 later.

17:19.520 --> 17:22.800
If you watch the scene where Poe and Finn steal the TIE fighter,

17:22.800 --> 17:26.080
Poe takes his jacket off shortly before they take off,

17:26.080 --> 17:29.280
so it makes perfect sense for it to still be in the TIE fighter.

17:36.400 --> 17:45.840
Thanks for watching!
