0	4920	Hello, everyone. Today, we're gonna take a look at a Lauren Southern video entitled
4920	7240	What Every Girl Needs to Hear,
7240	13240	which features Lauren speaking into a camera, saying things that she apparently thinks every girl needs to hear.
13240	17040	So, I guess you should all go and watch that video first, then.
17040	20080	Well, the ones of you who haven't seen it already, anyway,
20080	26640	some of you will have come to this video directly from that one, probably via the suggested video thing YouTube has,
26640	29600	so welcome to all of you, nice to meet you.
29760	33920	Everyone else, off you go. The link is in the description below.
33920	40800	It's only 12 minutes long, or 6 if you click on that little cog in the bottom right and speed her up two times.
40800	44800	And welcome back. So then, what do we think about this video?
44800	48640	What was Lauren trying to argue? What points was she making?
48640	53120	Well, marriage good, sex bad, basically, when you boil it down.
53120	60120	This video is based on your standard conservative religious abstinence argument, just delivered in a vlogger style.
60120	66120	And at first glance, it appears to be the sort of video that I personally find it rather difficult to argue against.
66120	72120	You know, how can you respond to someone simply speaking their subjective opinions into a webcam?
72120	76120	You know, just say your equally subjective counter-opinions, I guess.
76120	80120	And I mean, I could do that. Let's do that, in fact, for a little bit.
80120	83120	Just as an example, so this is how that would go.
83120	86120	I'd show a statement of Lauren's, like this one.
86120	92120	A stable marriage and children are statistically one of the highest predictors of happiness in a woman's life.
92120	96120	And then I'd say, ah, did you notice her thumb was on the scale there?
96120	100120	She said, a stable marriage is a predictor of happiness.
100120	105120	That's biasing the results there, because of course, a lot of marriages are unstable.
105120	108120	A lot of marriages make people unhappy.
108120	112120	But if we just ignore those, you know, add that stable qualifier,
112120	115120	suddenly marriages are a much better predictor of happiness.
115120	117120	It's very tricksy there.
117120	124120	Another statement of Lauren's is, women love strength and resources, men value youth and fertility.
124120	131120	Of course, the problem here is that if this were the inescapable biological certainty that Lauren makes it out to be,
131120	133120	her video wouldn't need to exist.
133120	137120	You know, if people really did seek out partners according to these values,
137120	140120	then for Lauren, there wouldn't be a problem, would there?
140120	143120	You know, what every girl needed to hear would be nothing, wouldn't it?
143120	147120	Because they could just follow their hard-wired biological impulses.
147120	152120	No, Lauren's problem is that people aren't acting according to these values.
152120	155120	This is simply how Lauren wants people to act.
155120	161120	Lauren has an idea of what people are supposed to be like, but they keep acting differently.
161120	168120	Which means that there must therefore be some nefarious liberal plot to corrupt people into acting counter to biology.
168120	172120	You know, rather than the simpler answer, which is that she's just wrong.
172120	174120	Another quote of Lauren's is,
174120	181120	you don't want to be competing with 20-year-old girls for 30-year-old guys when you hit the age of 30 because you won't win.
181120	186120	Another subjective opinion, and my equally subjective counter,
186120	193120	is that I'm a 30-year-old guy, and I, for one, would much rather go out with someone around my own age
193120	196120	than someone a decade younger than me.
196120	199120	You know, chances are we'd have a lot more in common,
199120	202120	and in general, this appears to be how most other people are.
202120	207120	FiveThirtyEight.com reports that data from the United States Current Population Survey
207120	214120	shows that the average age difference for a heterosexual couple in the United States is only 2.3 years,
214120	218120	which is not quite so dramatic as the 10 years in Lauren's example.
218120	225120	I guess, you don't want to be competing with 28-year-old girls when you hit the age of 30, wasn't quite as catchy.
225120	232120	And then I'd just carry on like that, really, showing something Lauren said, and then saying the opposite thing.
232120	236120	I could point out that she never once mentions LGBT people.
236120	241120	You know, the existence of gay couples, for instance, really throws a wrench into her argument there.
241120	246120	You know, maybe those 20-year-old girls don't want to be competing for guys at all, Lauren.
246120	250120	Maybe some guys would be more than happy to get married, but they can't,
250120	253120	because they're not allowed to marry their boyfriends.
253120	256120	You know, what would Lauren say to those people?
256120	259120	And then I'd wrap it up by saying all people are different.
259120	261120	Get married and or have kids if you want.
261120	264120	If you don't, don't. That's cool, too.
264120	267120	You know, different things make different people happy.
267120	269120	Farewell, folks.
269120	271120	And it'd be alright, that video.
271120	273120	You know, it wouldn't be terrible, would it?
273120	275120	But I want to do something a little different today.
275120	280120	You see, what I'm mostly interested in here is this particular quote from Lauren.
280120	286120	If you want to dig into the research surrounding all of this, I've put all the sources in the description.
286120	290120	And if we take a look, we see a section in her video description titled,
291120	294120	Links to studies, followed by ten links.
294120	296120	And make your bets now, folks.
296120	301120	How many of these links would you guess actually link to studies?
301120	304120	Hmm. We shall see.
304120	310120	So let's go through these sources now and take a peek at where Lauren got her ideas from.
310120	315120	So first up is this link to a WordPress blog with sections titled,
316120	321120	written by a happily married man living with his sexy wife
321120	325120	and their two wonderful kids in the Dallas-For-Worth area.
325120	327120	This is an article titled,
331120	336120	in which the author with the sexy wife has used US census data to make some charts
336120	341120	showing that the average age of unmarried women has been going up over the decades.
342120	346120	You know, people who are getting married are getting married later, generally.
346120	349120	Now, so what, you might think?
349120	353120	You know, what does that have to do with Lauren's points about happiness and fulfilment and all that?
353120	358120	You know, there's no data here that goes into how happy these women are or anything like that.
358120	363120	You know, on average, women who are getting married are older. That's all these charts say.
363120	370120	Any negative implications here are guesswork based on the assumption that these women want to get married but can't.
370120	374120	You know, for a counter assumption, we could say maybe, increasingly,
374120	378120	people just don't view marriage as that important anymore.
378120	381120	And so fewer people are making marriage a priority in their lives.
381120	385120	You know, what does the author of this article have to say about that?
385120	386120	And I quote,
400120	404120	Oh, well, you know, he believes it, so there we go.
404120	408120	Why does he believe it? I don't know.
408120	411120	So that's our first study there.
411120	417120	Some guy with a blog believes something. Off to a good start.
417120	420120	Let's move on and look at the next link.
420120	427120	So this link goes to a website titled Statistic Brain, and this post is female infidelity statistics.
427120	430120	There they are there. All the statistics.
430120	433120	So which study did these statistics come from?
433120	439120	Well, if we scroll down a little, we can see that the source is the Statistic Brain Research Institute,
439120	445120	and the content author is Statistic Brain, which is this website.
445120	449120	No study is linked. No actual author is listed.
449120	454120	A website just typed some numbers and then cited themselves as the source.
454120	460120	Now, not to attack Statistic Brain or anything here, they appear to be just some stat posting outfit.
460120	467120	If you want a list of countries by amount of cheese eaten in pounds per capita, they've got you covered.
467120	469120	You know, maybe.
469120	476120	But they're unconvincing as a source that's supposed to inform opinions about the fundamentals of human nature.
476120	483120	Apologies to Statistic Brain here, but this isn't a study. It's some numbers on a website.
483120	487120	I'm not even saying they're wrong numbers necessarily. They might be right.
487120	492120	But there's no way to check. You know, how many people were surveyed?
492120	496120	How were they contacted? How old were they? Where do they live?
496120	502120	I don't know. You know, did Statistic Brain just make all these numbers up?
502120	506120	Again, I don't know, and nor do you, and nor does Lauren.
506120	510120	But there it is anyway in her list of studies.
510120	513120	So let's look at the next study, which is this link.
513120	518120	And it's a very interesting study, this one, as it appears to be laid out like a Wikipedia page,
518120	525120	and also is somehow hosted by Wikipedia on their servers. I'm not sure how Lauren managed to pull that off.
525120	531120	So then, joking aside, this is the Wikipedia page for J.D. Unwin.
531120	535120	And if you don't know who that is, I would encourage you to watch my video titled
535120	539120	Do Women Destroy Civilizations? A Response to Black Pigeon Speaks,
539120	545120	who is another YouTube video maker who pretended to have understood the works of J.D. Unwin.
545120	550120	I won't subject you to all that again here. I'll just link that video in the description.
550120	555120	What I will say here, though, is that this link, it's not a study, is it, Lauren?
555120	559120	I mean, I hope you didn't do that in college if you went.
559120	563120	You know, if you just cite Wikipedia in an essay, they shout at you.
563120	567120	So that's three studies down, seven to go.
567120	574120	Now, five of these remaining seven are links to different pages of the blog The Social Pathologist, hosted on Blogspot.
574120	576120	So let's take a look at each of those.
576120	583120	First up is this article, Sexual Partner Divorce Risk Posted by The Social Pathologist.
583120	591120	This article is not a study, however, it is at least talking about a study, so that is a significant step up there.
591120	596120	The paper the article is talking about is Premarital Sex, Premarital Cohabitation,
596120	600120	and the Risk of Subsequent Marital Dissolution Among Women by Jay Teachman.
600120	603120	How's that for nominative determinism there?
603120	608120	Now, if we click this link in the article, it goes nowhere. The study's gone.
608120	612120	However, it is on JSTOR, so I purchased access to it.
612120	617120	Right then, we're going to read this article and this study and see what they say.
617120	619120	And I'll quote from the article first.
629120	635120	So that's the first claim in this Blogspot post, and now let's head over to the study and see what that has to say.
636120	641120	Using nationally representative data from the 1995 National Survey of Family Growth,
641120	645120	I estimate the association between intimate premarital relationships,
645120	650120	premarital sex and premarital cohabitation, and subsequent marital dissolution.
650120	657120	I extend previous research by considering relationship histories pertaining to both premarital sex and premarital cohabitation.
657120	662120	I find that premarital sex or premarital cohabitation that is limited to a woman's husband
662120	669120	is not associated with an elevated risk of marital disruption. End quote.
669120	671120	So, uh-huh.
671120	678120	Cohabitation before marriage has been shown to increase the risk of subsequent divorce of a couple,
678120	685120	was the claim on The Social Pathologist, but the study they cite claims the opposite in the first three sentences.
685120	687120	So, what's going on there?
687120	696120	Well, what Teachman's study actually found is that cohabitation before marriage is not indicative of a divorce risk to the couple involved,
696120	700120	but previous cohabitations with different people are.
700120	705120	So, if you're a woman who has been in several long-term relationships where you lived with someone else,
705120	712120	you're more likely to later be divorced if you get married than someone who has only lived with their husband prior to marriage.
712120	716120	So, that's the correlation there, but what's the cause?
716120	723120	You know, is there something about living with multiple different partners that causes one to be more likely to divorce once married?
723120	726120	Or is the data simply selective?
726120	734120	For instance, very conservative people who take marriage more seriously than others would be both less likely to cohabitate before marriage,
734120	737120	and less likely to divorce once married.
737120	744120	And conversely, people with a more liberal attitude to dating and relationships would be more likely to cohabitate before marriage,
744120	748120	and also more likely to divorce once married.
748120	750120	To quote Teachman's study here,
750120	758120	Unfortunately, this study does not provide any information that allows us to better determine whether the effect of having multiple premarital relationships
758120	763120	is based on differences on pre-existing characteristics that are tied to the risk of divorce,
763120	772120	or whether having multiple relationships generates environments where relationship skills or attitudes and values about the permanency of marriage are somehow altered.
772120	777120	It remains the task of subsequent research to consider these alternatives more fully.
777120	781120	So there we go. Teachman just notes the correlation.
781120	789120	The causation was outside the bounds of his study, and he recommends further research before any conclusions can be drawn there.
789120	794120	So then, back to blogspot. Let's read a little more of this article.
794120	801120	Many investigators have felt that the practice of cohabitation is selective for people who don't value marriage highly,
801120	805120	and hence are more likely to divorce when stress is put on the marriage.
805120	811120	In essence, it was thought that cohabitors' more liberal values placed them at higher risk of divorce.
811120	816120	An editorial note here, that's true. That's the true thing.
816120	824120	The social pathologist then introduces the study we've just read and posts a part of Teachman's conclusion before typing,
824120	831120	Executive summary, it's not the liberal values, it's the number of partners that matter.
831120	836120	Now, I'm sorry, social pathologist, but you misread that study.
836120	844120	It doesn't say anything about liberal values in there. In fact, in a section titled Limitations, Teachman writes,
844120	853120	the data contain no information about relationship skills or attitudes, values, or beliefs that can be used to distinguish between groups of women.
853120	861120	And indeed, if we look at the variables used in the analysis, there is nothing in there about personal values or beliefs pertaining to relationships.
861120	869120	So when the social pathologist says it's not the liberal values, it's the number of partners, that's a leap of logic.
869120	874120	It's nothing better than a guess. You know, that wasn't what the cited paper was about.
875120	885120	It's also a contradiction, because of course, someone's liberal values, or lack thereof, may very well influence the number of partners they have, if you follow.
885120	888120	Which would make it about the values, ultimately.
888120	898120	I mean, one could argue that having multiple serious relationships could change one's attitude to relationships in some way that could make divorce a greater possibility.
898120	903120	And indeed, another study we'll read in a little while leans towards that conclusion.
903120	913120	However, we can still make the case that people with more liberal values to relationships are more likely to enter into multiple serious relationships in the first place.
913120	918120	So one's values would still be important there. It's complicated, basically.
918120	922120	And this quote is a drastic oversimplification.
922120	928120	So for this link, then, someone on Blogspot misread a study.
928120	933120	I will point out here, though, that this article also mentions two noteworthy things.
933120	940120	The National Survey of Family Growth, 1995, and the Heritage Foundation study.
940120	953120	And we'll be hearing a lot more about both of those things going forward, starting right now with the second social pathologist link, which is titled 2002 Male and Female Statistical Data.
953120	954120	And I quote,
970120	976120	Then there's a bunch of other rubbish and eventually they get to the point of their article, this graph they came up with.
976120	983120	Number of lifetime sexual partners versus percent ever married who are not divorced.
983120	989120	And reminder, if you're in your second marriage, you count as divorced in this graph.
989120	995120	So, for example, if you were married for 18 months in your 20s, say, and then got a divorce,
995120	1002120	then remarried and have been married for 40 years steady since then, you count as divorced here.
1002120	1009120	Your four-decade marriage will count for less in this graph than a newlywed couple who've been together for eight weeks.
1009120	1013120	So this graph is nonsense, clearly.
1013120	1025120	Besides the bizarre only the first marriage counts rule, this says number of lifetime sexual partners, not number of premarital sexual partners.
1025120	1027120	And why is that important?
1027120	1035120	Well, divorcees don't drop off the planet once they get divorced, do they? They keep entering into relationships and having sex.
1035120	1040120	So if you get divorced and then have sex with, say, five people in the next few years,
1040120	1049120	your postmarital relationships are here being counted as a divorce risk for a marriage which is already over.
1049120	1052120	You know, what a Gordian knot that is.
1052120	1060120	So all that and, of course, this data is self-reported and people tend to misrepresent the number of sexual partners when asked.
1060120	1064120	Men aim high and women aim low, typically.
1064120	1069120	The only other thing to say about this graph is, to return to Lauren Southern for a moment,
1069120	1076120	when she says a woman with just one previous sexual partner is an equivalent divorce risk to a man with 19,
1076120	1078120	I think she got that from here.
1078120	1085120	Because one previous would be the two column here and 19 previous partners would be the 20 column.
1085120	1090120	So that's 57% and 54%, which is roughly equivalent.
1090120	1098120	I couldn't find this claim anywhere else in these sources, so my best guess is that she got it from this completely ridiculous graph.
1098120	1100120	Anyway, on to the next link.
1100120	1107120	This blog post is titled The Virgin Bride and is talking about a study from the Journal of Marriage and the Family
1107120	1113120	by Joan R. Kahn and Katherine A. London entitled Premarital Sex and the Risk of Divorce,
1113120	1120120	which examines the relationship between premarital sexual activity and the long-term risk of divorce among U.S. women married
1120120	1125120	between 1965 and 1985.
1125120	1129120	1965, so quite a while ago there.
1129120	1136120	Now, obviously, attitudes towards sex and marriage have changed rather a lot since the 1960s.
1136120	1145120	So to see this source in Lauren Southern's video in 2017, with her doing her kids these days routine, is a bit odd.
1145120	1151120	Women getting married in 1965 would have been growing up in the 40s and 50s.
1151120	1158120	And are we really supposed to be able to trust self-reported data here, given the vastly different social stigmas
1158120	1162120	towards premarital sex among people who grew up in that time period?
1162120	1168120	I don't know. Anyway, let's move on and quote a little of the study's findings here.
1168120	1174120	We interpret the results of our analysis to mean that women who continue to hold traditional attitudes about marriage
1174120	1180120	are less likely than other women to consider both premarital sex and divorce as acceptable options for themselves.
1180120	1185120	It's likely that people who feel constrained by traditional expectations early in life will maintain
1185120	1191120	this orientation throughout their lives, predisposing them to wait until marriage to begin sexual activity
1191120	1196120	and to reject divorce as an option if they should become unhappy with their marriage.
1196120	1201120	And it goes on. So different sorts of people raised in different environments with different values
1201120	1205120	are acting differently with regards to relationships.
1205120	1210120	That's what the authors of the study are saying is the likely thing here.
1210120	1214120	The social pathologist doesn't care about all that rubbish, of course.
1214120	1219120	To them, the number of someone's sexual partners is all that matters.
1219120	1224120	They'll strip the data out of the studies in order to make graphs, as they've done for this study,
1224120	1231120	which measures divorce probabilities of virgins with non-vrijins, whatever they are.
1231120	1238120	But as for the interpretations of the authors of the studies, the social pathologist seemingly isn't interested.
1238120	1245120	And there needs to be a word for appealing to authority while rejecting the findings of that authority.
1245120	1249120	You know, look at this very academic graph I made. It's sourced.
1249120	1257120	It's using real data from a real academic study written by university professors who I think are wrong.
1257120	1261120	And there's kind of a weird relationship going on there, you know?
1261120	1267120	I believe the university professors were on point with their data collection and methodology and calculations,
1267120	1275120	but when it comes to their interpretations of their study, well, I've got a blog and I believe they're wrong.
1275120	1281120	Anyway, the next social pathologist link is a guest post by a user named Intrepid.
1281120	1285120	Now this post is examining National Survey of Family Growth Data,
1285120	1291120	the same National Survey of Family Growth Data as in the Heritage Foundation study.
1291120	1293120	So there's those two things again.
1293120	1298120	Now, we'll be getting to that study fairly soon, so I won't say too much about this post,
1298120	1301120	except for one thing that I can't help mentioning.
1302120	1305120	In her video, Lauren Southern states that statistically,
1305120	1312120	every man or woman sleeps with past one adds to the chances her marriage will later end in divorce.
1312120	1315120	Now this statement is not true.
1315120	1321120	And this particular post, which is in Lauren's sources for some reason, explains why.
1321120	1325120	So let's take a look at Intrepid's charts.
1325120	1328120	So chart two, which is titled,
1328120	1334120	Women who have more non-marital partners are more likely to have a first marriage ending in divorce.
1334120	1336120	And that's what it shows.
1336120	1342120	The more non-marital partners a woman has had, the likelier her first marriage ends in divorce.
1342120	1344120	But we've seen this trick before.
1344120	1349120	This is non-marital partners, not pre-marital partners.
1349120	1356120	This data is being distorted by including the post-marital sexual relationships of divorcees.
1356120	1359120	So what happens if we look at the same data,
1359120	1366120	but instead consider the number of pre-marital partners instead of the number of non-marital partners?
1366120	1370120	Well, as you can see, it tells a very different story.
1370120	1375120	In this chart, women who have had five to nine pre-marital sexual partners
1375120	1380120	are less likely to divorce once married than people who have only had two.
1380120	1382120	And to quote Intrepid here,
1382120	1387120	My own hypothesis is that a higher partner count, up to five to nine or so partners,
1387120	1391120	is correlated with age and maturity in dating experience.
1391120	1395120	Older women and women with more dating experience are more likely to have learned
1395120	1399120	which personal qualities will work best for them in a marriage partner.
1399120	1405120	As a result, such women choose more wisely and tend to experience lower divorce rates.
1405120	1408120	So then, do you see what's wrong with Lauren Southern's statement?
1408120	1415120	She fell for the non-marital slash pre-marital switcheroo and got her tenses wrong.
1415120	1421120	Every man a woman sleeps with past one adds to the chance her marriage will later end in divorce.
1421120	1426120	This claim is completely contradicted by one of her own sources.
1426120	1429120	So then, onto the last Blogspot link.
1429120	1435120	This one titled, More Promiscuity Data, and again written by the social pathologist.
1435120	1438120	This blog post is concerned with yet another study.
1438120	1443120	This one titled, Adolescent Sexuality and the Risk of Marital Dissolution,
1443120	1447120	offered by Anthony Paik for the Journal of Marriage and Family.
1447120	1449120	And let's read a little of that.
1449120	1453120	This research investigates whether first sexual intercourse during adolescence
1453120	1457120	is associated with an increased risk of first marriage dissolution
1457120	1462120	and tests whether the results are consistent with causal or selection explanations.
1462120	1470120	Drawing on a sample of 3,793 ever-married women from the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth,
1470120	1474120	this study estimated event history models of first marriage dissolution.
1474120	1478120	Results indicated that wanted sexual debut in later adolescence
1478120	1482120	does not directly increase the risk of marital dissolution
1482120	1487120	but is linked indirectly as a result of subsequent premarital sexual outcomes.
1487120	1492120	Sexual debut that is not completely wanted or that occurs before age 16
1492120	1497120	is associated with increased risk of marital dissolution.
1497120	1501120	The results suggest that the timing and context of adolescent sexual debut
1501120	1504120	have important implications for marital stability.
1504120	1510120	So, similar to what we've seen thus far in the other papers, however, with an important distinction here.
1510120	1516120	This paper considers whether the adolescent sexual activity was wanted or unwanted,
1516120	1518120	and that's something we haven't seen so far.
1518120	1524120	It's an important point because, of course, sadly, sexual activity isn't always a choice.
1524120	1529120	Someone could be taken advantage of, pressured, or forced into sex,
1529120	1533120	and it's not hard to think of negative effects upon their later relationships
1533120	1535120	that might occur as a result of that.
1535120	1540120	The selectivity argument doesn't apply here, of course, as the author points out.
1540120	1542120	The conclusion to the paper reads,
1542120	1548120	Adolescent sexual debut that is not completely wanted is both directly and indirectly linked to marital dissolution.
1548120	1554120	Because these decisions are not completely voluntary, a choice framework does not apply,
1554120	1560120	which highlights the need for greater attention to the consequences of unwanted sexual experiences among girls.
1560120	1565120	Now, we need to be careful when handling this particular data set.
1565120	1569120	For instance, for an example of what you shouldn't do,
1569120	1575120	you shouldn't title a blog post about the data more promiscuity data.
1575120	1581120	You also shouldn't refer to the field of study as the science of slutology.
1581120	1587120	I mean, you shouldn't do that anyway, but especially not when you're talking about adolescents,
1587120	1589120	some of whom were sexually assaulted.
1589120	1594120	You also shouldn't wonder if promiscuity is a mechanism of desolvent,
1594120	1602120	as in, they've lost their souls as a result of the unwanted, remember, sexual experiences.
1602120	1608120	You know, what sort of vile, horrible person would say something like that?
1608120	1613120	Anyway, that's kind of an odd word we just saw there, desolvent.
1613120	1618120	Now, if you remember, Lauren Southern mentions desolvent in her video.
1618120	1625120	She says the path of promiscuity and desolvent around eight and a half minutes in.
1625120	1631120	Phrasing, which is very close to this blog post here, so I'm just gonna assume that this is where she got it from.
1631120	1634120	Now, we'll leave the social pathologist there for now,
1634120	1639120	but I will note the final paragraph of that last post starts out with this sentence.
1639120	1644120	I know that correlation is not causation, but...
1644120	1649120	Which, wow. I mean, they should make that the new title of their blog, I think.
1649120	1654120	So that's eight studies down, two studies to go.
1654120	1659120	Now, there's a reason that none of the links so far have been to actual studies,
1659120	1663120	and it's because the actual studies keep saying awkward things like,
1663120	1670120	this is inconclusive, and this needs further research, and this correlates, but we don't know the cause,
1670120	1674120	and things like that, which would be a bit embarrassing for Lauren.
1674120	1681120	So she has to link instead to religious conservative blog post reinterpretations of the studies,
1681120	1686120	blog posts that call adolescent women sluts who've lost their souls.
1686120	1689120	It's kind of pathetic, really, isn't it?
1689120	1694120	Anyway, on to the next link, which is a Stefan Molyneux video.
1694120	1697120	Oh my god. This video is titled,
1697120	1703120	The Truth About Sex, Facts You Won't Believe Are True, which... yeah, no shit.
1703120	1710120	So the majority of this video is Stefan reposting a bunch of graphs from the top link in his source list,
1710120	1713120	which is also the last remaining link in Lauren's source list,
1713120	1718120	The Harmful Effects of Early Sexual Activity and Multiple Sexual Partners Among Women,
1718120	1721120	a book of charts from the Heritage Foundation.
1721120	1725120	So here it is finally. We've been hearing about this for a while.
1725120	1728120	So who are the Heritage Foundation?
1728120	1730120	Well, from their website,
1730120	1736120	the mission of the Heritage Foundation is to formulate and promote conservative public policies
1736120	1741120	based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, etc.
1741120	1745120	And it's nice when places just admit they have a bias up front, you know.
1745120	1748120	So the Heritage Foundation is a conservative think tank,
1748120	1752120	which, by the way, promotes abstinence-only sex education.
1752120	1756120	And there are many articles advocating abstinence on their website,
1756120	1760120	such as this one, Teenage Sexual Abstinence and Academic Achievement,
1760120	1764120	which was written by Kirk Johnson and Robert Rector,
1764120	1770120	who are two of the listed authors of The Harmful Effects of Early Sexual Activity study.
1770120	1772120	So what is in this study, then?
1772120	1776120	Well, it's just a lot of graphs, really, some of which we've seen already.
1776120	1780120	Here's them pulling the non-marital slash premarital trick,
1780120	1783120	and here's that same graph in Stefan's video.
1783120	1786120	And there's another trick in this particular graph, actually.
1786120	1790120	It's to do with the Heritage Foundation's definition of a stable marriage,
1790120	1795120	which they define as a couple being married for at least five years.
1795120	1801120	Now, the average length of a first marriage that ends in divorce in the United States is eight years.
1801120	1805120	So a lot of these so-called stable marriages ain't.
1805120	1810120	You know, why did the Heritage Foundation pick five years to define a stable marriage
1810120	1812120	when that's below the national average?
1812120	1817120	Well, I don't know. I suppose five is a nice round number, isn't it?
1817120	1822120	So the air quotes mistake the Heritage Foundation makes over and over again in this study
1822120	1828120	is the by now very familiar correlation-slash-causation misunderstanding.
1828120	1831120	For example, below this graph, which is titled,
1832120	1836120	is linked to lower levels of child and maternal poverty.
1836120	1838120	The Heritage Foundation writes,
1844120	1849120	Now, the problem here is that linked to doesn't mean causes.
1849120	1853120	And this is the most basic type of logical misunderstanding.
1853120	1857120	You know, every time the streets are wet outside, it's raining.
1857120	1860120	Wet streets are linked to rain.
1860120	1864120	So therefore, the wet streets must be causing the rain.
1864120	1868120	Early sexual activity is linked to poverty.
1868120	1873120	But of course, none of the brain geniuses who wrote this paper bothered to consider the reverse,
1873120	1878120	that poverty could be causing higher levels of early sexual activity.
1878120	1882120	For example, kids in poverty are less likely to live in a stable home,
1882120	1887120	less likely to have supportive parents or guardians who can provide guidance for and supervise them.
1887120	1891120	You know, maybe the poverty is the problem.
1891120	1894120	Of course, the Heritage Foundation would respond by saying,
1894120	1900120	hey, we never said sexual activity was the cause of poverty, we just said it was linked to it.
1900120	1904120	To which I would respond, but you put it in a paper entitled,
1904120	1908120	The Harmful Effects of Early Sexual Activity.
1908120	1914120	You know, their attempts to come across as academically neutral didn't extend to titling their paper.
1914120	1917120	They gave away their bias in the first sentence.
1917120	1920120	And they make this mistake over and over.
1920120	1924120	Delay in sexual activity is linked to greater happiness.
1924120	1930120	Earlier onset of sexual activity is linked to higher turnover rates among sexual partners.
1930120	1933120	But these are just correlations.
1933120	1936120	The cause remains unproven here.
1936120	1940120	This study is a biased hack job.
1940120	1944120	They took the National Survey of Family Growth Data and routed around in it
1944120	1949120	looking for particular correlations in order to push an abstinence-only agenda.
1949120	1952120	Now speaking of that National Survey of Family Growth Data,
1952120	1957120	it's all available on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.
1957120	1960120	And I can't help but notice that the National Survey of Family Growth questionnaires
1960120	1964120	included questions about sex education.
1964120	1970120	For example, the Cycle 6 questionnaire from 2002 specifically asks about abstinence education.
1970120	1976120	And one can imagine a study which uses this data to measure the effects of abstinence education
1976120	1980120	versus the effects of a comprehensive sex education.
1980120	1988120	It might be titled, Abstinence-Only and Comprehensive Sex Education and the Initiation of Sexual Activity in Teen Pregnancy.
1988120	1990120	And it might find that,
1990120	1996120	Adolescents who received comprehensive sex education were significantly less likely to report teen pregnancy
1996120	1999120	than those who received no formal sex education,
1999120	2003120	whereas there was no significant effect of abstinence-only education.
2003120	2008120	Abstinence-only education did not reduce the likelihood of engaging in vaginal intercourse,
2008120	2016120	but comprehensive sex education was marginally associated with a lower likelihood of reporting having engaged in vaginal intercourse.
2016120	2021120	Teaching about contraception was not associated with increased risk of adolescent sexual activity.
2021120	2026120	Adolescents who received comprehensive sex education had a lower risk of pregnancy
2026120	2030120	than adolescents who received abstinence-only or no sex education.
2030120	2033120	Imagine if such a study existed.
2033120	2040120	I wonder what the Heritage Foundation would think about the same source they're attempting to use to push an abstinence-only agenda,
2040120	2045120	instead being used to prove abstinence-only education is a waste of time.
2045120	2052120	Now, one last point I'd like to make about this Heritage Foundation study is that it examines data prior to 1995.
2052120	2059120	And it's the main source in Lauren's video, which she opens with a reality-these-days-is-being-twisted speech.
2059120	2068120	Now, not to get too personal or anything, but Lauren Southern was born in 1995, after this data was collected.
2068120	2072120	She has no idea what she's talking about on a personal level.
2072120	2076120	You know, she's using sources from before she was born.
2076120	2082120	She's just repeating the opinions of old, crusty white guys from places like the Heritage Foundation.
2082120	2087120	And that's probably why her references to popular culture are so outdated, too.
2087120	2090120	You know, Cosmo Magazine and Sex and the City.
2090120	2094120	I mean, that stopped airing over a decade ago, Lauren.
2094120	2099120	Now, I bring up Lauren using old data here to mention that there is newer data available.
2099120	2102120	The National Survey of Family Growth has kept going.
2102120	2107120	They have up-to-date statistics and studies freely available on their website.
2107120	2112120	So, why are Lauren's sources so rubbish? I'm forced to wonder.
2112120	2119120	To recap, there's a bunch of blogspot posts by a conservative Christian who doesn't understand how to read studies properly,
2119120	2126120	an unsourced listicle, the Wikipedia page of an author who died in 1936 and isn't even mentioned,
2126120	2132120	a Stefan Molyneux video, and a conservative think tank's abstinence propaganda.
2132120	2136120	Including this list of sources was a mistake.
2136120	2137120	Obviously.
2137120	2142120	Lauren claims that her video isn't a bunch of weirdo religious propaganda,
2142120	2147120	but looking at the sources, we can see... yes, it is.
2147120	2154120	Lauren Southern is repeating the same tired, old, debunked conservative talking points that we've all heard a thousand times.
2155120	2158120	It's an attempt to sell conservatism to young people.
2158120	2164120	And, of course, because conservatism usually screws over young people, she has to lie.
2164120	2170120	Now, I'll end here with a plea to any young person who was directed to this video after watching Lauren's
2170120	2174120	and somehow has managed to stick around through the whole thing.
2174120	2176120	So, hello.
2176120	2180120	Please don't take anything Lauren Southern said seriously.
2180120	2182120	She's a bullshitter.
2182120	2187120	It's up to you to determine what's gonna make you happy in your own life, not anyone else.
2187120	2192120	Please don't make life decisions based on a list of statistical likelihoods.
2192120	2195120	Incorrect statistical likelihoods at that.
2195120	2199120	You know, you don't want to end up as some sort of robot thinking,
2199120	2208120	well, I can't have sex with one extra person because then my possible future marriage will have a 4% greater chance of ending in divorce or whatever.
2208120	2214120	I mean, if that's how you live your life, you'll never be happy regardless of whether you get married or not.
2214120	2220120	So, live your own life and make your own decisions. That's my advice for you today.
