00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
Hello, everyone. Today, we're gonna take a look at a Lauren Southern video entitled

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,240
What Every Girl Needs to Hear,

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:13,240
which features Lauren speaking into a camera, saying things that she apparently thinks every girl needs to hear.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,040
So, I guess you should all go and watch that video first, then.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,080
Well, the ones of you who haven't seen it already, anyway,

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,640
some of you will have come to this video directly from that one, probably via the suggested video thing YouTube has,

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,600
so welcome to all of you, nice to meet you.

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,920
Everyone else, off you go. The link is in the description below.

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,800
It's only 12 minutes long, or 6 if you click on that little cog in the bottom right and speed her up two times.

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,800
And welcome back. So then, what do we think about this video?

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,640
What was Lauren trying to argue? What points was she making?

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,120
Well, marriage good, sex bad, basically, when you boil it down.

13
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:00,120
This video is based on your standard conservative religious abstinence argument, just delivered in a vlogger style.

14
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,120
And at first glance, it appears to be the sort of video that I personally find it rather difficult to argue against.

15
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:12,120
You know, how can you respond to someone simply speaking their subjective opinions into a webcam?

16
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,120
You know, just say your equally subjective counter-opinions, I guess.

17
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,120
And I mean, I could do that. Let's do that, in fact, for a little bit.

18
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,120
Just as an example, so this is how that would go.

19
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,120
I'd show a statement of Lauren's, like this one.

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:32,120
A stable marriage and children are statistically one of the highest predictors of happiness in a woman's life.

21
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,120
And then I'd say, ah, did you notice her thumb was on the scale there?

22
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,120
She said, a stable marriage is a predictor of happiness.

23
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:45,120
That's biasing the results there, because of course, a lot of marriages are unstable.

24
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,120
A lot of marriages make people unhappy.

25
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,120
But if we just ignore those, you know, add that stable qualifier,

26
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,120
suddenly marriages are a much better predictor of happiness.

27
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,120
It's very tricksy there.

28
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:04,120
Another statement of Lauren's is, women love strength and resources, men value youth and fertility.

29
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:11,120
Of course, the problem here is that if this were the inescapable biological certainty that Lauren makes it out to be,

30
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,120
her video wouldn't need to exist.

31
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,120
You know, if people really did seek out partners according to these values,

32
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,120
then for Lauren, there wouldn't be a problem, would there?

33
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,120
You know, what every girl needed to hear would be nothing, wouldn't it?

34
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,120
Because they could just follow their hard-wired biological impulses.

35
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,120
No, Lauren's problem is that people aren't acting according to these values.

36
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,120
This is simply how Lauren wants people to act.

37
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,120
Lauren has an idea of what people are supposed to be like, but they keep acting differently.

38
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:48,120
Which means that there must therefore be some nefarious liberal plot to corrupt people into acting counter to biology.

39
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,120
You know, rather than the simpler answer, which is that she's just wrong.

40
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,120
Another quote of Lauren's is,

41
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:01,120
you don't want to be competing with 20-year-old girls for 30-year-old guys when you hit the age of 30 because you won't win.

42
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,120
Another subjective opinion, and my equally subjective counter,

43
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:13,120
is that I'm a 30-year-old guy, and I, for one, would much rather go out with someone around my own age

44
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,120
than someone a decade younger than me.

45
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,120
You know, chances are we'd have a lot more in common,

46
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,120
and in general, this appears to be how most other people are.

47
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,120
FiveThirtyEight.com reports that data from the United States Current Population Survey

48
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,120
shows that the average age difference for a heterosexual couple in the United States is only 2.3 years,

49
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,120
which is not quite so dramatic as the 10 years in Lauren's example.

50
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:45,120
I guess, you don't want to be competing with 28-year-old girls when you hit the age of 30, wasn't quite as catchy.

51
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:52,120
And then I'd just carry on like that, really, showing something Lauren said, and then saying the opposite thing.

52
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,120
I could point out that she never once mentions LGBT people.

53
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,120
You know, the existence of gay couples, for instance, really throws a wrench into her argument there.

54
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,120
You know, maybe those 20-year-old girls don't want to be competing for guys at all, Lauren.

55
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,120
Maybe some guys would be more than happy to get married, but they can't,

56
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,120
because they're not allowed to marry their boyfriends.

57
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,120
You know, what would Lauren say to those people?

58
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,120
And then I'd wrap it up by saying all people are different.

59
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,120
Get married and or have kids if you want.

60
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,120
If you don't, don't. That's cool, too.

61
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,120
You know, different things make different people happy.

62
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,120
Farewell, folks.

63
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,120
And it'd be alright, that video.

64
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,120
You know, it wouldn't be terrible, would it?

65
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,120
But I want to do something a little different today.

66
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,120
You see, what I'm mostly interested in here is this particular quote from Lauren.

67
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:46,120
If you want to dig into the research surrounding all of this, I've put all the sources in the description.

68
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,120
And if we take a look, we see a section in her video description titled,

69
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,120
Links to studies, followed by ten links.

70
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,120
And make your bets now, folks.

71
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,120
How many of these links would you guess actually link to studies?

72
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,120
Hmm. We shall see.

73
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:10,120
So let's go through these sources now and take a peek at where Lauren got her ideas from.

74
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,120
So first up is this link to a WordPress blog with sections titled,

75
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,120
written by a happily married man living with his sexy wife

76
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,120
and their two wonderful kids in the Dallas-For-Worth area.

77
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,120
This is an article titled,

78
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,120
in which the author with the sexy wife has used US census data to make some charts

79
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,120
showing that the average age of unmarried women has been going up over the decades.

80
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,120
You know, people who are getting married are getting married later, generally.

81
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,120
Now, so what, you might think?

82
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,120
You know, what does that have to do with Lauren's points about happiness and fulfilment and all that?

83
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,120
You know, there's no data here that goes into how happy these women are or anything like that.

84
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,120
You know, on average, women who are getting married are older. That's all these charts say.

85
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:10,120
Any negative implications here are guesswork based on the assumption that these women want to get married but can't.

86
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,120
You know, for a counter assumption, we could say maybe, increasingly,

87
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,120
people just don't view marriage as that important anymore.

88
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,120
And so fewer people are making marriage a priority in their lives.

89
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,120
You know, what does the author of this article have to say about that?

90
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,120
And I quote,

91
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,120
Oh, well, you know, he believes it, so there we go.

92
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,120
Why does he believe it? I don't know.

93
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,120
So that's our first study there.

94
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,120
Some guy with a blog believes something. Off to a good start.

95
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,120
Let's move on and look at the next link.

96
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:07,120
So this link goes to a website titled Statistic Brain, and this post is female infidelity statistics.

97
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,120
There they are there. All the statistics.

98
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,120
So which study did these statistics come from?

99
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,120
Well, if we scroll down a little, we can see that the source is the Statistic Brain Research Institute,

100
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,120
and the content author is Statistic Brain, which is this website.

101
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,120
No study is linked. No actual author is listed.

102
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,120
A website just typed some numbers and then cited themselves as the source.

103
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:40,120
Now, not to attack Statistic Brain or anything here, they appear to be just some stat posting outfit.

104
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:47,120
If you want a list of countries by amount of cheese eaten in pounds per capita, they've got you covered.

105
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,120
You know, maybe.

106
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:56,120
But they're unconvincing as a source that's supposed to inform opinions about the fundamentals of human nature.

107
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:03,120
Apologies to Statistic Brain here, but this isn't a study. It's some numbers on a website.

108
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,120
I'm not even saying they're wrong numbers necessarily. They might be right.

109
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,120
But there's no way to check. You know, how many people were surveyed?

110
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,120
How were they contacted? How old were they? Where do they live?

111
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:22,120
I don't know. You know, did Statistic Brain just make all these numbers up?

112
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,120
Again, I don't know, and nor do you, and nor does Lauren.

113
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,120
But there it is anyway in her list of studies.

114
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,120
So let's look at the next study, which is this link.

115
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,120
And it's a very interesting study, this one, as it appears to be laid out like a Wikipedia page,

116
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:45,120
and also is somehow hosted by Wikipedia on their servers. I'm not sure how Lauren managed to pull that off.

117
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,120
So then, joking aside, this is the Wikipedia page for J.D. Unwin.

118
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,120
And if you don't know who that is, I would encourage you to watch my video titled

119
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,120
Do Women Destroy Civilizations? A Response to Black Pigeon Speaks,

120
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,120
who is another YouTube video maker who pretended to have understood the works of J.D. Unwin.

121
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,120
I won't subject you to all that again here. I'll just link that video in the description.

122
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,120
What I will say here, though, is that this link, it's not a study, is it, Lauren?

123
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,120
I mean, I hope you didn't do that in college if you went.

124
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,120
You know, if you just cite Wikipedia in an essay, they shout at you.

125
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,120
So that's three studies down, seven to go.

126
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:34,120
Now, five of these remaining seven are links to different pages of the blog The Social Pathologist, hosted on Blogspot.

127
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,120
So let's take a look at each of those.

128
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:43,120
First up is this article, Sexual Partner Divorce Risk Posted by The Social Pathologist.

129
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:51,120
This article is not a study, however, it is at least talking about a study, so that is a significant step up there.

130
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,120
The paper the article is talking about is Premarital Sex, Premarital Cohabitation,

131
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,120
and the Risk of Subsequent Marital Dissolution Among Women by Jay Teachman.

132
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,120
How's that for nominative determinism there?

133
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,120
Now, if we click this link in the article, it goes nowhere. The study's gone.

134
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,120
However, it is on JSTOR, so I purchased access to it.

135
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,120
Right then, we're going to read this article and this study and see what they say.

136
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
And I'll quote from the article first.

137
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:35,120
So that's the first claim in this Blogspot post, and now let's head over to the study and see what that has to say.

138
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,120
Using nationally representative data from the 1995 National Survey of Family Growth,

139
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,120
I estimate the association between intimate premarital relationships,

140
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,120
premarital sex and premarital cohabitation, and subsequent marital dissolution.

141
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:57,120
I extend previous research by considering relationship histories pertaining to both premarital sex and premarital cohabitation.

142
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,120
I find that premarital sex or premarital cohabitation that is limited to a woman's husband

143
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:09,120
is not associated with an elevated risk of marital disruption. End quote.

144
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
So, uh-huh.

145
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:18,120
Cohabitation before marriage has been shown to increase the risk of subsequent divorce of a couple,

146
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:25,120
was the claim on The Social Pathologist, but the study they cite claims the opposite in the first three sentences.

147
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,120
So, what's going on there?

148
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:36,120
Well, what Teachman's study actually found is that cohabitation before marriage is not indicative of a divorce risk to the couple involved,

149
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,120
but previous cohabitations with different people are.

150
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,120
So, if you're a woman who has been in several long-term relationships where you lived with someone else,

151
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:52,120
you're more likely to later be divorced if you get married than someone who has only lived with their husband prior to marriage.

152
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,120
So, that's the correlation there, but what's the cause?

153
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:03,120
You know, is there something about living with multiple different partners that causes one to be more likely to divorce once married?

154
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,120
Or is the data simply selective?

155
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:14,120
For instance, very conservative people who take marriage more seriously than others would be both less likely to cohabitate before marriage,

156
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,120
and less likely to divorce once married.

157
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:24,120
And conversely, people with a more liberal attitude to dating and relationships would be more likely to cohabitate before marriage,

158
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,120
and also more likely to divorce once married.

159
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,120
To quote Teachman's study here,

160
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:38,120
Unfortunately, this study does not provide any information that allows us to better determine whether the effect of having multiple premarital relationships

161
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,120
is based on differences on pre-existing characteristics that are tied to the risk of divorce,

162
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:52,120
or whether having multiple relationships generates environments where relationship skills or attitudes and values about the permanency of marriage are somehow altered.

163
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,120
It remains the task of subsequent research to consider these alternatives more fully.

164
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,120
So there we go. Teachman just notes the correlation.

165
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:09,120
The causation was outside the bounds of his study, and he recommends further research before any conclusions can be drawn there.

166
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,120
So then, back to blogspot. Let's read a little more of this article.

167
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:21,120
Many investigators have felt that the practice of cohabitation is selective for people who don't value marriage highly,

168
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,120
and hence are more likely to divorce when stress is put on the marriage.

169
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,120
In essence, it was thought that cohabitors' more liberal values placed them at higher risk of divorce.

170
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,120
An editorial note here, that's true. That's the true thing.

171
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:44,120
The social pathologist then introduces the study we've just read and posts a part of Teachman's conclusion before typing,

172
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:51,120
Executive summary, it's not the liberal values, it's the number of partners that matter.

173
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,120
Now, I'm sorry, social pathologist, but you misread that study.

174
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:04,120
It doesn't say anything about liberal values in there. In fact, in a section titled Limitations, Teachman writes,

175
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:13,120
the data contain no information about relationship skills or attitudes, values, or beliefs that can be used to distinguish between groups of women.

176
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:21,120
And indeed, if we look at the variables used in the analysis, there is nothing in there about personal values or beliefs pertaining to relationships.

177
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:29,120
So when the social pathologist says it's not the liberal values, it's the number of partners, that's a leap of logic.

178
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,120
It's nothing better than a guess. You know, that wasn't what the cited paper was about.

179
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:45,120
It's also a contradiction, because of course, someone's liberal values, or lack thereof, may very well influence the number of partners they have, if you follow.

180
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,120
Which would make it about the values, ultimately.

181
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:58,120
I mean, one could argue that having multiple serious relationships could change one's attitude to relationships in some way that could make divorce a greater possibility.

182
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,120
And indeed, another study we'll read in a little while leans towards that conclusion.

183
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:13,120
However, we can still make the case that people with more liberal values to relationships are more likely to enter into multiple serious relationships in the first place.

184
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,120
So one's values would still be important there. It's complicated, basically.

185
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,120
And this quote is a drastic oversimplification.

186
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:28,120
So for this link, then, someone on Blogspot misread a study.

187
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,120
I will point out here, though, that this article also mentions two noteworthy things.

188
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:40,120
The National Survey of Family Growth, 1995, and the Heritage Foundation study.

189
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:53,120
And we'll be hearing a lot more about both of those things going forward, starting right now with the second social pathologist link, which is titled 2002 Male and Female Statistical Data.

190
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,120
And I quote,

191
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:16,120
Then there's a bunch of other rubbish and eventually they get to the point of their article, this graph they came up with.

192
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:23,120
Number of lifetime sexual partners versus percent ever married who are not divorced.

193
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:29,120
And reminder, if you're in your second marriage, you count as divorced in this graph.

194
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,120
So, for example, if you were married for 18 months in your 20s, say, and then got a divorce,

195
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:42,120
then remarried and have been married for 40 years steady since then, you count as divorced here.

196
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:49,120
Your four-decade marriage will count for less in this graph than a newlywed couple who've been together for eight weeks.

197
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,120
So this graph is nonsense, clearly.

198
00:16:53,120 --> 00:17:05,120
Besides the bizarre only the first marriage counts rule, this says number of lifetime sexual partners, not number of premarital sexual partners.

199
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,120
And why is that important?

200
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:15,120
Well, divorcees don't drop off the planet once they get divorced, do they? They keep entering into relationships and having sex.

201
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,120
So if you get divorced and then have sex with, say, five people in the next few years,

202
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:29,120
your postmarital relationships are here being counted as a divorce risk for a marriage which is already over.

203
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,120
You know, what a Gordian knot that is.

204
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:40,120
So all that and, of course, this data is self-reported and people tend to misrepresent the number of sexual partners when asked.

205
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,120
Men aim high and women aim low, typically.

206
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:49,120
The only other thing to say about this graph is, to return to Lauren Southern for a moment,

207
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:56,120
when she says a woman with just one previous sexual partner is an equivalent divorce risk to a man with 19,

208
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,120
I think she got that from here.

209
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:05,120
Because one previous would be the two column here and 19 previous partners would be the 20 column.

210
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,120
So that's 57% and 54%, which is roughly equivalent.

211
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:18,120
I couldn't find this claim anywhere else in these sources, so my best guess is that she got it from this completely ridiculous graph.

212
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,120
Anyway, on to the next link.

213
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:27,120
This blog post is titled The Virgin Bride and is talking about a study from the Journal of Marriage and the Family

214
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:33,120
by Joan R. Kahn and Katherine A. London entitled Premarital Sex and the Risk of Divorce,

215
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:40,120
which examines the relationship between premarital sexual activity and the long-term risk of divorce among U.S. women married

216
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:45,120
between 1965 and 1985.

217
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,120
1965, so quite a while ago there.

218
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:56,120
Now, obviously, attitudes towards sex and marriage have changed rather a lot since the 1960s.

219
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:05,120
So to see this source in Lauren Southern's video in 2017, with her doing her kids these days routine, is a bit odd.

220
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,120
Women getting married in 1965 would have been growing up in the 40s and 50s.

221
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:18,120
And are we really supposed to be able to trust self-reported data here, given the vastly different social stigmas

222
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,120
towards premarital sex among people who grew up in that time period?

223
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:28,120
I don't know. Anyway, let's move on and quote a little of the study's findings here.

224
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:34,120
We interpret the results of our analysis to mean that women who continue to hold traditional attitudes about marriage

225
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:40,120
are less likely than other women to consider both premarital sex and divorce as acceptable options for themselves.

226
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:45,120
It's likely that people who feel constrained by traditional expectations early in life will maintain

227
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:51,120
this orientation throughout their lives, predisposing them to wait until marriage to begin sexual activity

228
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,120
and to reject divorce as an option if they should become unhappy with their marriage.

229
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:01,120
And it goes on. So different sorts of people raised in different environments with different values

230
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,120
are acting differently with regards to relationships.

231
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,120
That's what the authors of the study are saying is the likely thing here.

232
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,120
The social pathologist doesn't care about all that rubbish, of course.

233
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:19,120
To them, the number of someone's sexual partners is all that matters.

234
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,120
They'll strip the data out of the studies in order to make graphs, as they've done for this study,

235
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:31,120
which measures divorce probabilities of virgins with non-vrijins, whatever they are.

236
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:38,120
But as for the interpretations of the authors of the studies, the social pathologist seemingly isn't interested.

237
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:45,120
And there needs to be a word for appealing to authority while rejecting the findings of that authority.

238
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,120
You know, look at this very academic graph I made. It's sourced.

239
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:57,120
It's using real data from a real academic study written by university professors who I think are wrong.

240
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,120
And there's kind of a weird relationship going on there, you know?

241
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:07,120
I believe the university professors were on point with their data collection and methodology and calculations,

242
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:15,120
but when it comes to their interpretations of their study, well, I've got a blog and I believe they're wrong.

243
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,120
Anyway, the next social pathologist link is a guest post by a user named Intrepid.

244
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,120
Now this post is examining National Survey of Family Growth Data,

245
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,120
the same National Survey of Family Growth Data as in the Heritage Foundation study.

246
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,120
So there's those two things again.

247
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,120
Now, we'll be getting to that study fairly soon, so I won't say too much about this post,

248
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,120
except for one thing that I can't help mentioning.

249
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,120
In her video, Lauren Southern states that statistically,

250
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:52,120
every man or woman sleeps with past one adds to the chances her marriage will later end in divorce.

251
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,120
Now this statement is not true.

252
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:01,120
And this particular post, which is in Lauren's sources for some reason, explains why.

253
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,120
So let's take a look at Intrepid's charts.

254
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,120
So chart two, which is titled,

255
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:14,120
Women who have more non-marital partners are more likely to have a first marriage ending in divorce.

256
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,120
And that's what it shows.

257
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:22,120
The more non-marital partners a woman has had, the likelier her first marriage ends in divorce.

258
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,120
But we've seen this trick before.

259
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:29,120
This is non-marital partners, not pre-marital partners.

260
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:36,120
This data is being distorted by including the post-marital sexual relationships of divorcees.

261
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,120
So what happens if we look at the same data,

262
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:46,120
but instead consider the number of pre-marital partners instead of the number of non-marital partners?

263
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,120
Well, as you can see, it tells a very different story.

264
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:55,120
In this chart, women who have had five to nine pre-marital sexual partners

265
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,120
are less likely to divorce once married than people who have only had two.

266
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,120
And to quote Intrepid here,

267
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:07,120
My own hypothesis is that a higher partner count, up to five to nine or so partners,

268
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,120
is correlated with age and maturity in dating experience.

269
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,120
Older women and women with more dating experience are more likely to have learned

270
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,120
which personal qualities will work best for them in a marriage partner.

271
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:25,120
As a result, such women choose more wisely and tend to experience lower divorce rates.

272
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,120
So then, do you see what's wrong with Lauren Southern's statement?

273
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:35,120
She fell for the non-marital slash pre-marital switcheroo and got her tenses wrong.

274
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:41,120
Every man a woman sleeps with past one adds to the chance her marriage will later end in divorce.

275
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,120
This claim is completely contradicted by one of her own sources.

276
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,120
So then, onto the last Blogspot link.

277
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:55,120
This one titled, More Promiscuity Data, and again written by the social pathologist.

278
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,120
This blog post is concerned with yet another study.

279
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:03,120
This one titled, Adolescent Sexuality and the Risk of Marital Dissolution,

280
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,120
offered by Anthony Paik for the Journal of Marriage and Family.

281
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,120
And let's read a little of that.

282
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,120
This research investigates whether first sexual intercourse during adolescence

283
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,120
is associated with an increased risk of first marriage dissolution

284
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,120
and tests whether the results are consistent with causal or selection explanations.

285
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:30,120
Drawing on a sample of 3,793 ever-married women from the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth,

286
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,120
this study estimated event history models of first marriage dissolution.

287
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,120
Results indicated that wanted sexual debut in later adolescence

288
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,120
does not directly increase the risk of marital dissolution

289
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:47,120
but is linked indirectly as a result of subsequent premarital sexual outcomes.

290
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,120
Sexual debut that is not completely wanted or that occurs before age 16

291
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:57,120
is associated with increased risk of marital dissolution.

292
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,120
The results suggest that the timing and context of adolescent sexual debut

293
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,120
have important implications for marital stability.

294
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:10,120
So, similar to what we've seen thus far in the other papers, however, with an important distinction here.

295
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:16,120
This paper considers whether the adolescent sexual activity was wanted or unwanted,

296
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,120
and that's something we haven't seen so far.

297
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:24,120
It's an important point because, of course, sadly, sexual activity isn't always a choice.

298
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:29,120
Someone could be taken advantage of, pressured, or forced into sex,

299
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,120
and it's not hard to think of negative effects upon their later relationships

300
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,120
that might occur as a result of that.

301
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,120
The selectivity argument doesn't apply here, of course, as the author points out.

302
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,120
The conclusion to the paper reads,

303
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:48,120
Adolescent sexual debut that is not completely wanted is both directly and indirectly linked to marital dissolution.

304
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:54,120
Because these decisions are not completely voluntary, a choice framework does not apply,

305
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:00,120
which highlights the need for greater attention to the consequences of unwanted sexual experiences among girls.

306
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:05,120
Now, we need to be careful when handling this particular data set.

307
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,120
For instance, for an example of what you shouldn't do,

308
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:15,120
you shouldn't title a blog post about the data more promiscuity data.

309
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:21,120
You also shouldn't refer to the field of study as the science of slutology.

310
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:27,120
I mean, you shouldn't do that anyway, but especially not when you're talking about adolescents,

311
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,120
some of whom were sexually assaulted.

312
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,120
You also shouldn't wonder if promiscuity is a mechanism of desolvent,

313
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:42,120
as in, they've lost their souls as a result of the unwanted, remember, sexual experiences.

314
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:48,120
You know, what sort of vile, horrible person would say something like that?

315
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,120
Anyway, that's kind of an odd word we just saw there, desolvent.

316
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,120
Now, if you remember, Lauren Southern mentions desolvent in her video.

317
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:05,120
She says the path of promiscuity and desolvent around eight and a half minutes in.

318
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:11,120
Phrasing, which is very close to this blog post here, so I'm just gonna assume that this is where she got it from.

319
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,120
Now, we'll leave the social pathologist there for now,

320
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:19,120
but I will note the final paragraph of that last post starts out with this sentence.

321
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,120
I know that correlation is not causation, but...

322
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,120
Which, wow. I mean, they should make that the new title of their blog, I think.

323
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,120
So that's eight studies down, two studies to go.

324
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:39,120
Now, there's a reason that none of the links so far have been to actual studies,

325
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,120
and it's because the actual studies keep saying awkward things like,

326
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:50,120
this is inconclusive, and this needs further research, and this correlates, but we don't know the cause,

327
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:54,120
and things like that, which would be a bit embarrassing for Lauren.

328
00:27:54,120 --> 00:28:01,120
So she has to link instead to religious conservative blog post reinterpretations of the studies,

329
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,120
blog posts that call adolescent women sluts who've lost their souls.

330
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,120
It's kind of pathetic, really, isn't it?

331
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,120
Anyway, on to the next link, which is a Stefan Molyneux video.

332
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,120
Oh my god. This video is titled,

333
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:23,120
The Truth About Sex, Facts You Won't Believe Are True, which... yeah, no shit.

334
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:30,120
So the majority of this video is Stefan reposting a bunch of graphs from the top link in his source list,

335
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,120
which is also the last remaining link in Lauren's source list,

336
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:38,120
The Harmful Effects of Early Sexual Activity and Multiple Sexual Partners Among Women,

337
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,120
a book of charts from the Heritage Foundation.

338
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,120
So here it is finally. We've been hearing about this for a while.

339
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,120
So who are the Heritage Foundation?

340
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,120
Well, from their website,

341
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:56,120
the mission of the Heritage Foundation is to formulate and promote conservative public policies

342
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:01,120
based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, etc.

343
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,120
And it's nice when places just admit they have a bias up front, you know.

344
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,120
So the Heritage Foundation is a conservative think tank,

345
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,120
which, by the way, promotes abstinence-only sex education.

346
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:16,120
And there are many articles advocating abstinence on their website,

347
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,120
such as this one, Teenage Sexual Abstinence and Academic Achievement,

348
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,120
which was written by Kirk Johnson and Robert Rector,

349
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:30,120
who are two of the listed authors of The Harmful Effects of Early Sexual Activity study.

350
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,120
So what is in this study, then?

351
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,120
Well, it's just a lot of graphs, really, some of which we've seen already.

352
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,120
Here's them pulling the non-marital slash premarital trick,

353
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,120
and here's that same graph in Stefan's video.

354
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,120
And there's another trick in this particular graph, actually.

355
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,120
It's to do with the Heritage Foundation's definition of a stable marriage,

356
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,120
which they define as a couple being married for at least five years.

357
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:01,120
Now, the average length of a first marriage that ends in divorce in the United States is eight years.

358
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,120
So a lot of these so-called stable marriages ain't.

359
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,120
You know, why did the Heritage Foundation pick five years to define a stable marriage

360
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,120
when that's below the national average?

361
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:17,120
Well, I don't know. I suppose five is a nice round number, isn't it?

362
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,120
So the air quotes mistake the Heritage Foundation makes over and over again in this study

363
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:28,120
is the by now very familiar correlation-slash-causation misunderstanding.

364
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,120
For example, below this graph, which is titled,

365
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:36,120
is linked to lower levels of child and maternal poverty.

366
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,120
The Heritage Foundation writes,

367
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:49,120
Now, the problem here is that linked to doesn't mean causes.

368
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,120
And this is the most basic type of logical misunderstanding.

369
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,120
You know, every time the streets are wet outside, it's raining.

370
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,120
Wet streets are linked to rain.

371
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:04,120
So therefore, the wet streets must be causing the rain.

372
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:08,120
Early sexual activity is linked to poverty.

373
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:13,120
But of course, none of the brain geniuses who wrote this paper bothered to consider the reverse,

374
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,120
that poverty could be causing higher levels of early sexual activity.

375
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:22,120
For example, kids in poverty are less likely to live in a stable home,

376
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:27,120
less likely to have supportive parents or guardians who can provide guidance for and supervise them.

377
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,120
You know, maybe the poverty is the problem.

378
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,120
Of course, the Heritage Foundation would respond by saying,

379
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:40,120
hey, we never said sexual activity was the cause of poverty, we just said it was linked to it.

380
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,120
To which I would respond, but you put it in a paper entitled,

381
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:48,120
The Harmful Effects of Early Sexual Activity.

382
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:54,120
You know, their attempts to come across as academically neutral didn't extend to titling their paper.

383
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,120
They gave away their bias in the first sentence.

384
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,120
And they make this mistake over and over.

385
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,120
Delay in sexual activity is linked to greater happiness.

386
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:10,120
Earlier onset of sexual activity is linked to higher turnover rates among sexual partners.

387
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,120
But these are just correlations.

388
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,120
The cause remains unproven here.

389
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,120
This study is a biased hack job.

390
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,120
They took the National Survey of Family Growth Data and routed around in it

391
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:29,120
looking for particular correlations in order to push an abstinence-only agenda.

392
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,120
Now speaking of that National Survey of Family Growth Data,

393
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:37,120
it's all available on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.

394
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,120
And I can't help but notice that the National Survey of Family Growth questionnaires

395
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:44,120
included questions about sex education.

396
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:50,120
For example, the Cycle 6 questionnaire from 2002 specifically asks about abstinence education.

397
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:56,120
And one can imagine a study which uses this data to measure the effects of abstinence education

398
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:00,120
versus the effects of a comprehensive sex education.

399
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:08,120
It might be titled, Abstinence-Only and Comprehensive Sex Education and the Initiation of Sexual Activity in Teen Pregnancy.

400
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,120
And it might find that,

401
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:16,120
Adolescents who received comprehensive sex education were significantly less likely to report teen pregnancy

402
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,120
than those who received no formal sex education,

403
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,120
whereas there was no significant effect of abstinence-only education.

404
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:28,120
Abstinence-only education did not reduce the likelihood of engaging in vaginal intercourse,

405
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:36,120
but comprehensive sex education was marginally associated with a lower likelihood of reporting having engaged in vaginal intercourse.

406
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:41,120
Teaching about contraception was not associated with increased risk of adolescent sexual activity.

407
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,120
Adolescents who received comprehensive sex education had a lower risk of pregnancy

408
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,120
than adolescents who received abstinence-only or no sex education.

409
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,120
Imagine if such a study existed.

410
00:33:53,120 --> 00:34:00,120
I wonder what the Heritage Foundation would think about the same source they're attempting to use to push an abstinence-only agenda,

411
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:05,120
instead being used to prove abstinence-only education is a waste of time.

412
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:12,120
Now, one last point I'd like to make about this Heritage Foundation study is that it examines data prior to 1995.

413
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:19,120
And it's the main source in Lauren's video, which she opens with a reality-these-days-is-being-twisted speech.

414
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:28,120
Now, not to get too personal or anything, but Lauren Southern was born in 1995, after this data was collected.

415
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:32,120
She has no idea what she's talking about on a personal level.

416
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:36,120
You know, she's using sources from before she was born.

417
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:42,120
She's just repeating the opinions of old, crusty white guys from places like the Heritage Foundation.

418
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:47,120
And that's probably why her references to popular culture are so outdated, too.

419
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,120
You know, Cosmo Magazine and Sex and the City.

420
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:54,120
I mean, that stopped airing over a decade ago, Lauren.

421
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:59,120
Now, I bring up Lauren using old data here to mention that there is newer data available.

422
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,120
The National Survey of Family Growth has kept going.

423
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:07,120
They have up-to-date statistics and studies freely available on their website.

424
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:12,120
So, why are Lauren's sources so rubbish? I'm forced to wonder.

425
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:19,120
To recap, there's a bunch of blogspot posts by a conservative Christian who doesn't understand how to read studies properly,

426
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:26,120
an unsourced listicle, the Wikipedia page of an author who died in 1936 and isn't even mentioned,

427
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:32,120
a Stefan Molyneux video, and a conservative think tank's abstinence propaganda.

428
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:36,120
Including this list of sources was a mistake.

429
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,120
Obviously.

430
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:42,120
Lauren claims that her video isn't a bunch of weirdo religious propaganda,

431
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:47,120
but looking at the sources, we can see... yes, it is.

432
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:54,120
Lauren Southern is repeating the same tired, old, debunked conservative talking points that we've all heard a thousand times.

433
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,120
It's an attempt to sell conservatism to young people.

434
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:04,120
And, of course, because conservatism usually screws over young people, she has to lie.

435
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:10,120
Now, I'll end here with a plea to any young person who was directed to this video after watching Lauren's

436
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:14,120
and somehow has managed to stick around through the whole thing.

437
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,120
So, hello.

438
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,120
Please don't take anything Lauren Southern said seriously.

439
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,120
She's a bullshitter.

440
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:27,120
It's up to you to determine what's gonna make you happy in your own life, not anyone else.

441
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:32,120
Please don't make life decisions based on a list of statistical likelihoods.

442
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,120
Incorrect statistical likelihoods at that.

443
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,120
You know, you don't want to end up as some sort of robot thinking,

444
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:48,120
well, I can't have sex with one extra person because then my possible future marriage will have a 4% greater chance of ending in divorce or whatever.

445
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:54,120
I mean, if that's how you live your life, you'll never be happy regardless of whether you get married or not.

446
00:36:54,120 --> 00:37:00,120
So, live your own life and make your own decisions. That's my advice for you today.
