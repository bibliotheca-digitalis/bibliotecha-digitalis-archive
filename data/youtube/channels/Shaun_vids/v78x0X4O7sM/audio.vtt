00:00.000 --> 00:04.920
Hello, everyone. Today, we're gonna take a look at a Lauren Southern video entitled

00:04.920 --> 00:07.240
What Every Girl Needs to Hear,

00:07.240 --> 00:13.240
which features Lauren speaking into a camera, saying things that she apparently thinks every girl needs to hear.

00:13.240 --> 00:17.040
So, I guess you should all go and watch that video first, then.

00:17.040 --> 00:20.080
Well, the ones of you who haven't seen it already, anyway,

00:20.080 --> 00:26.640
some of you will have come to this video directly from that one, probably via the suggested video thing YouTube has,

00:26.640 --> 00:29.600
so welcome to all of you, nice to meet you.

00:29.760 --> 00:33.920
Everyone else, off you go. The link is in the description below.

00:33.920 --> 00:40.800
It's only 12 minutes long, or 6 if you click on that little cog in the bottom right and speed her up two times.

00:40.800 --> 00:44.800
And welcome back. So then, what do we think about this video?

00:44.800 --> 00:48.640
What was Lauren trying to argue? What points was she making?

00:48.640 --> 00:53.120
Well, marriage good, sex bad, basically, when you boil it down.

00:53.120 --> 01:00.120
This video is based on your standard conservative religious abstinence argument, just delivered in a vlogger style.

01:00.120 --> 01:06.120
And at first glance, it appears to be the sort of video that I personally find it rather difficult to argue against.

01:06.120 --> 01:12.120
You know, how can you respond to someone simply speaking their subjective opinions into a webcam?

01:12.120 --> 01:16.120
You know, just say your equally subjective counter-opinions, I guess.

01:16.120 --> 01:20.120
And I mean, I could do that. Let's do that, in fact, for a little bit.

01:20.120 --> 01:23.120
Just as an example, so this is how that would go.

01:23.120 --> 01:26.120
I'd show a statement of Lauren's, like this one.

01:26.120 --> 01:32.120
A stable marriage and children are statistically one of the highest predictors of happiness in a woman's life.

01:32.120 --> 01:36.120
And then I'd say, ah, did you notice her thumb was on the scale there?

01:36.120 --> 01:40.120
She said, a stable marriage is a predictor of happiness.

01:40.120 --> 01:45.120
That's biasing the results there, because of course, a lot of marriages are unstable.

01:45.120 --> 01:48.120
A lot of marriages make people unhappy.

01:48.120 --> 01:52.120
But if we just ignore those, you know, add that stable qualifier,

01:52.120 --> 01:55.120
suddenly marriages are a much better predictor of happiness.

01:55.120 --> 01:57.120
It's very tricksy there.

01:57.120 --> 02:04.120
Another statement of Lauren's is, women love strength and resources, men value youth and fertility.

02:04.120 --> 02:11.120
Of course, the problem here is that if this were the inescapable biological certainty that Lauren makes it out to be,

02:11.120 --> 02:13.120
her video wouldn't need to exist.

02:13.120 --> 02:17.120
You know, if people really did seek out partners according to these values,

02:17.120 --> 02:20.120
then for Lauren, there wouldn't be a problem, would there?

02:20.120 --> 02:23.120
You know, what every girl needed to hear would be nothing, wouldn't it?

02:23.120 --> 02:27.120
Because they could just follow their hard-wired biological impulses.

02:27.120 --> 02:32.120
No, Lauren's problem is that people aren't acting according to these values.

02:32.120 --> 02:35.120
This is simply how Lauren wants people to act.

02:35.120 --> 02:41.120
Lauren has an idea of what people are supposed to be like, but they keep acting differently.

02:41.120 --> 02:48.120
Which means that there must therefore be some nefarious liberal plot to corrupt people into acting counter to biology.

02:48.120 --> 02:52.120
You know, rather than the simpler answer, which is that she's just wrong.

02:52.120 --> 02:54.120
Another quote of Lauren's is,

02:54.120 --> 03:01.120
you don't want to be competing with 20-year-old girls for 30-year-old guys when you hit the age of 30 because you won't win.

03:01.120 --> 03:06.120
Another subjective opinion, and my equally subjective counter,

03:06.120 --> 03:13.120
is that I'm a 30-year-old guy, and I, for one, would much rather go out with someone around my own age

03:13.120 --> 03:16.120
than someone a decade younger than me.

03:16.120 --> 03:19.120
You know, chances are we'd have a lot more in common,

03:19.120 --> 03:22.120
and in general, this appears to be how most other people are.

03:22.120 --> 03:27.120
FiveThirtyEight.com reports that data from the United States Current Population Survey

03:27.120 --> 03:34.120
shows that the average age difference for a heterosexual couple in the United States is only 2.3 years,

03:34.120 --> 03:38.120
which is not quite so dramatic as the 10 years in Lauren's example.

03:38.120 --> 03:45.120
I guess, you don't want to be competing with 28-year-old girls when you hit the age of 30, wasn't quite as catchy.

03:45.120 --> 03:52.120
And then I'd just carry on like that, really, showing something Lauren said, and then saying the opposite thing.

03:52.120 --> 03:56.120
I could point out that she never once mentions LGBT people.

03:56.120 --> 04:01.120
You know, the existence of gay couples, for instance, really throws a wrench into her argument there.

04:01.120 --> 04:06.120
You know, maybe those 20-year-old girls don't want to be competing for guys at all, Lauren.

04:06.120 --> 04:10.120
Maybe some guys would be more than happy to get married, but they can't,

04:10.120 --> 04:13.120
because they're not allowed to marry their boyfriends.

04:13.120 --> 04:16.120
You know, what would Lauren say to those people?

04:16.120 --> 04:19.120
And then I'd wrap it up by saying all people are different.

04:19.120 --> 04:21.120
Get married and or have kids if you want.

04:21.120 --> 04:24.120
If you don't, don't. That's cool, too.

04:24.120 --> 04:27.120
You know, different things make different people happy.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.120
Farewell, folks.

04:29.120 --> 04:31.120
And it'd be alright, that video.

04:31.120 --> 04:33.120
You know, it wouldn't be terrible, would it?

04:33.120 --> 04:35.120
But I want to do something a little different today.

04:35.120 --> 04:40.120
You see, what I'm mostly interested in here is this particular quote from Lauren.

04:40.120 --> 04:46.120
If you want to dig into the research surrounding all of this, I've put all the sources in the description.

04:46.120 --> 04:50.120
And if we take a look, we see a section in her video description titled,

04:51.120 --> 04:54.120
Links to studies, followed by ten links.

04:54.120 --> 04:56.120
And make your bets now, folks.

04:56.120 --> 05:01.120
How many of these links would you guess actually link to studies?

05:01.120 --> 05:04.120
Hmm. We shall see.

05:04.120 --> 05:10.120
So let's go through these sources now and take a peek at where Lauren got her ideas from.

05:10.120 --> 05:15.120
So first up is this link to a WordPress blog with sections titled,

05:16.120 --> 05:21.120
written by a happily married man living with his sexy wife

05:21.120 --> 05:25.120
and their two wonderful kids in the Dallas-For-Worth area.

05:25.120 --> 05:27.120
This is an article titled,

05:31.120 --> 05:36.120
in which the author with the sexy wife has used US census data to make some charts

05:36.120 --> 05:41.120
showing that the average age of unmarried women has been going up over the decades.

05:42.120 --> 05:46.120
You know, people who are getting married are getting married later, generally.

05:46.120 --> 05:49.120
Now, so what, you might think?

05:49.120 --> 05:53.120
You know, what does that have to do with Lauren's points about happiness and fulfilment and all that?

05:53.120 --> 05:58.120
You know, there's no data here that goes into how happy these women are or anything like that.

05:58.120 --> 06:03.120
You know, on average, women who are getting married are older. That's all these charts say.

06:03.120 --> 06:10.120
Any negative implications here are guesswork based on the assumption that these women want to get married but can't.

06:10.120 --> 06:14.120
You know, for a counter assumption, we could say maybe, increasingly,

06:14.120 --> 06:18.120
people just don't view marriage as that important anymore.

06:18.120 --> 06:21.120
And so fewer people are making marriage a priority in their lives.

06:21.120 --> 06:25.120
You know, what does the author of this article have to say about that?

06:25.120 --> 06:26.120
And I quote,

06:40.120 --> 06:44.120
Oh, well, you know, he believes it, so there we go.

06:44.120 --> 06:48.120
Why does he believe it? I don't know.

06:48.120 --> 06:51.120
So that's our first study there.

06:51.120 --> 06:57.120
Some guy with a blog believes something. Off to a good start.

06:57.120 --> 07:00.120
Let's move on and look at the next link.

07:00.120 --> 07:07.120
So this link goes to a website titled Statistic Brain, and this post is female infidelity statistics.

07:07.120 --> 07:10.120
There they are there. All the statistics.

07:10.120 --> 07:13.120
So which study did these statistics come from?

07:13.120 --> 07:19.120
Well, if we scroll down a little, we can see that the source is the Statistic Brain Research Institute,

07:19.120 --> 07:25.120
and the content author is Statistic Brain, which is this website.

07:25.120 --> 07:29.120
No study is linked. No actual author is listed.

07:29.120 --> 07:34.120
A website just typed some numbers and then cited themselves as the source.

07:34.120 --> 07:40.120
Now, not to attack Statistic Brain or anything here, they appear to be just some stat posting outfit.

07:40.120 --> 07:47.120
If you want a list of countries by amount of cheese eaten in pounds per capita, they've got you covered.

07:47.120 --> 07:49.120
You know, maybe.

07:49.120 --> 07:56.120
But they're unconvincing as a source that's supposed to inform opinions about the fundamentals of human nature.

07:56.120 --> 08:03.120
Apologies to Statistic Brain here, but this isn't a study. It's some numbers on a website.

08:03.120 --> 08:07.120
I'm not even saying they're wrong numbers necessarily. They might be right.

08:07.120 --> 08:12.120
But there's no way to check. You know, how many people were surveyed?

08:12.120 --> 08:16.120
How were they contacted? How old were they? Where do they live?

08:16.120 --> 08:22.120
I don't know. You know, did Statistic Brain just make all these numbers up?

08:22.120 --> 08:26.120
Again, I don't know, and nor do you, and nor does Lauren.

08:26.120 --> 08:30.120
But there it is anyway in her list of studies.

08:30.120 --> 08:33.120
So let's look at the next study, which is this link.

08:33.120 --> 08:38.120
And it's a very interesting study, this one, as it appears to be laid out like a Wikipedia page,

08:38.120 --> 08:45.120
and also is somehow hosted by Wikipedia on their servers. I'm not sure how Lauren managed to pull that off.

08:45.120 --> 08:51.120
So then, joking aside, this is the Wikipedia page for J.D. Unwin.

08:51.120 --> 08:55.120
And if you don't know who that is, I would encourage you to watch my video titled

08:55.120 --> 08:59.120
Do Women Destroy Civilizations? A Response to Black Pigeon Speaks,

08:59.120 --> 09:05.120
who is another YouTube video maker who pretended to have understood the works of J.D. Unwin.

09:05.120 --> 09:10.120
I won't subject you to all that again here. I'll just link that video in the description.

09:10.120 --> 09:15.120
What I will say here, though, is that this link, it's not a study, is it, Lauren?

09:15.120 --> 09:19.120
I mean, I hope you didn't do that in college if you went.

09:19.120 --> 09:23.120
You know, if you just cite Wikipedia in an essay, they shout at you.

09:23.120 --> 09:27.120
So that's three studies down, seven to go.

09:27.120 --> 09:34.120
Now, five of these remaining seven are links to different pages of the blog The Social Pathologist, hosted on Blogspot.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.120
So let's take a look at each of those.

09:36.120 --> 09:43.120
First up is this article, Sexual Partner Divorce Risk Posted by The Social Pathologist.

09:43.120 --> 09:51.120
This article is not a study, however, it is at least talking about a study, so that is a significant step up there.

09:51.120 --> 09:56.120
The paper the article is talking about is Premarital Sex, Premarital Cohabitation,

09:56.120 --> 10:00.120
and the Risk of Subsequent Marital Dissolution Among Women by Jay Teachman.

10:00.120 --> 10:03.120
How's that for nominative determinism there?

10:03.120 --> 10:08.120
Now, if we click this link in the article, it goes nowhere. The study's gone.

10:08.120 --> 10:12.120
However, it is on JSTOR, so I purchased access to it.

10:12.120 --> 10:17.120
Right then, we're going to read this article and this study and see what they say.

10:17.120 --> 10:19.120
And I'll quote from the article first.

10:29.120 --> 10:35.120
So that's the first claim in this Blogspot post, and now let's head over to the study and see what that has to say.

10:36.120 --> 10:41.120
Using nationally representative data from the 1995 National Survey of Family Growth,

10:41.120 --> 10:45.120
I estimate the association between intimate premarital relationships,

10:45.120 --> 10:50.120
premarital sex and premarital cohabitation, and subsequent marital dissolution.

10:50.120 --> 10:57.120
I extend previous research by considering relationship histories pertaining to both premarital sex and premarital cohabitation.

10:57.120 --> 11:02.120
I find that premarital sex or premarital cohabitation that is limited to a woman's husband

11:02.120 --> 11:09.120
is not associated with an elevated risk of marital disruption. End quote.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.120
So, uh-huh.

11:11.120 --> 11:18.120
Cohabitation before marriage has been shown to increase the risk of subsequent divorce of a couple,

11:18.120 --> 11:25.120
was the claim on The Social Pathologist, but the study they cite claims the opposite in the first three sentences.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.120
So, what's going on there?

11:27.120 --> 11:36.120
Well, what Teachman's study actually found is that cohabitation before marriage is not indicative of a divorce risk to the couple involved,

11:36.120 --> 11:40.120
but previous cohabitations with different people are.

11:40.120 --> 11:45.120
So, if you're a woman who has been in several long-term relationships where you lived with someone else,

11:45.120 --> 11:52.120
you're more likely to later be divorced if you get married than someone who has only lived with their husband prior to marriage.

11:52.120 --> 11:56.120
So, that's the correlation there, but what's the cause?

11:56.120 --> 12:03.120
You know, is there something about living with multiple different partners that causes one to be more likely to divorce once married?

12:03.120 --> 12:06.120
Or is the data simply selective?

12:06.120 --> 12:14.120
For instance, very conservative people who take marriage more seriously than others would be both less likely to cohabitate before marriage,

12:14.120 --> 12:17.120
and less likely to divorce once married.

12:17.120 --> 12:24.120
And conversely, people with a more liberal attitude to dating and relationships would be more likely to cohabitate before marriage,

12:24.120 --> 12:28.120
and also more likely to divorce once married.

12:28.120 --> 12:30.120
To quote Teachman's study here,

12:30.120 --> 12:38.120
Unfortunately, this study does not provide any information that allows us to better determine whether the effect of having multiple premarital relationships

12:38.120 --> 12:43.120
is based on differences on pre-existing characteristics that are tied to the risk of divorce,

12:43.120 --> 12:52.120
or whether having multiple relationships generates environments where relationship skills or attitudes and values about the permanency of marriage are somehow altered.

12:52.120 --> 12:57.120
It remains the task of subsequent research to consider these alternatives more fully.

12:57.120 --> 13:01.120
So there we go. Teachman just notes the correlation.

13:01.120 --> 13:09.120
The causation was outside the bounds of his study, and he recommends further research before any conclusions can be drawn there.

13:09.120 --> 13:14.120
So then, back to blogspot. Let's read a little more of this article.

13:14.120 --> 13:21.120
Many investigators have felt that the practice of cohabitation is selective for people who don't value marriage highly,

13:21.120 --> 13:25.120
and hence are more likely to divorce when stress is put on the marriage.

13:25.120 --> 13:31.120
In essence, it was thought that cohabitors' more liberal values placed them at higher risk of divorce.

13:31.120 --> 13:36.120
An editorial note here, that's true. That's the true thing.

13:36.120 --> 13:44.120
The social pathologist then introduces the study we've just read and posts a part of Teachman's conclusion before typing,

13:44.120 --> 13:51.120
Executive summary, it's not the liberal values, it's the number of partners that matter.

13:51.120 --> 13:56.120
Now, I'm sorry, social pathologist, but you misread that study.

13:56.120 --> 14:04.120
It doesn't say anything about liberal values in there. In fact, in a section titled Limitations, Teachman writes,

14:04.120 --> 14:13.120
the data contain no information about relationship skills or attitudes, values, or beliefs that can be used to distinguish between groups of women.

14:13.120 --> 14:21.120
And indeed, if we look at the variables used in the analysis, there is nothing in there about personal values or beliefs pertaining to relationships.

14:21.120 --> 14:29.120
So when the social pathologist says it's not the liberal values, it's the number of partners, that's a leap of logic.

14:29.120 --> 14:34.120
It's nothing better than a guess. You know, that wasn't what the cited paper was about.

14:35.120 --> 14:45.120
It's also a contradiction, because of course, someone's liberal values, or lack thereof, may very well influence the number of partners they have, if you follow.

14:45.120 --> 14:48.120
Which would make it about the values, ultimately.

14:48.120 --> 14:58.120
I mean, one could argue that having multiple serious relationships could change one's attitude to relationships in some way that could make divorce a greater possibility.

14:58.120 --> 15:03.120
And indeed, another study we'll read in a little while leans towards that conclusion.

15:03.120 --> 15:13.120
However, we can still make the case that people with more liberal values to relationships are more likely to enter into multiple serious relationships in the first place.

15:13.120 --> 15:18.120
So one's values would still be important there. It's complicated, basically.

15:18.120 --> 15:22.120
And this quote is a drastic oversimplification.

15:22.120 --> 15:28.120
So for this link, then, someone on Blogspot misread a study.

15:28.120 --> 15:33.120
I will point out here, though, that this article also mentions two noteworthy things.

15:33.120 --> 15:40.120
The National Survey of Family Growth, 1995, and the Heritage Foundation study.

15:40.120 --> 15:53.120
And we'll be hearing a lot more about both of those things going forward, starting right now with the second social pathologist link, which is titled 2002 Male and Female Statistical Data.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.120
And I quote,

16:10.120 --> 16:16.120
Then there's a bunch of other rubbish and eventually they get to the point of their article, this graph they came up with.

16:16.120 --> 16:23.120
Number of lifetime sexual partners versus percent ever married who are not divorced.

16:23.120 --> 16:29.120
And reminder, if you're in your second marriage, you count as divorced in this graph.

16:29.120 --> 16:35.120
So, for example, if you were married for 18 months in your 20s, say, and then got a divorce,

16:35.120 --> 16:42.120
then remarried and have been married for 40 years steady since then, you count as divorced here.

16:42.120 --> 16:49.120
Your four-decade marriage will count for less in this graph than a newlywed couple who've been together for eight weeks.

16:49.120 --> 16:53.120
So this graph is nonsense, clearly.

16:53.120 --> 17:05.120
Besides the bizarre only the first marriage counts rule, this says number of lifetime sexual partners, not number of premarital sexual partners.

17:05.120 --> 17:07.120
And why is that important?

17:07.120 --> 17:15.120
Well, divorcees don't drop off the planet once they get divorced, do they? They keep entering into relationships and having sex.

17:15.120 --> 17:20.120
So if you get divorced and then have sex with, say, five people in the next few years,

17:20.120 --> 17:29.120
your postmarital relationships are here being counted as a divorce risk for a marriage which is already over.

17:29.120 --> 17:32.120
You know, what a Gordian knot that is.

17:32.120 --> 17:40.120
So all that and, of course, this data is self-reported and people tend to misrepresent the number of sexual partners when asked.

17:40.120 --> 17:44.120
Men aim high and women aim low, typically.

17:44.120 --> 17:49.120
The only other thing to say about this graph is, to return to Lauren Southern for a moment,

17:49.120 --> 17:56.120
when she says a woman with just one previous sexual partner is an equivalent divorce risk to a man with 19,

17:56.120 --> 17:58.120
I think she got that from here.

17:58.120 --> 18:05.120
Because one previous would be the two column here and 19 previous partners would be the 20 column.

18:05.120 --> 18:10.120
So that's 57% and 54%, which is roughly equivalent.

18:10.120 --> 18:18.120
I couldn't find this claim anywhere else in these sources, so my best guess is that she got it from this completely ridiculous graph.

18:18.120 --> 18:20.120
Anyway, on to the next link.

18:20.120 --> 18:27.120
This blog post is titled The Virgin Bride and is talking about a study from the Journal of Marriage and the Family

18:27.120 --> 18:33.120
by Joan R. Kahn and Katherine A. London entitled Premarital Sex and the Risk of Divorce,

18:33.120 --> 18:40.120
which examines the relationship between premarital sexual activity and the long-term risk of divorce among U.S. women married

18:40.120 --> 18:45.120
between 1965 and 1985.

18:45.120 --> 18:49.120
1965, so quite a while ago there.

18:49.120 --> 18:56.120
Now, obviously, attitudes towards sex and marriage have changed rather a lot since the 1960s.

18:56.120 --> 19:05.120
So to see this source in Lauren Southern's video in 2017, with her doing her kids these days routine, is a bit odd.

19:05.120 --> 19:11.120
Women getting married in 1965 would have been growing up in the 40s and 50s.

19:11.120 --> 19:18.120
And are we really supposed to be able to trust self-reported data here, given the vastly different social stigmas

19:18.120 --> 19:22.120
towards premarital sex among people who grew up in that time period?

19:22.120 --> 19:28.120
I don't know. Anyway, let's move on and quote a little of the study's findings here.

19:28.120 --> 19:34.120
We interpret the results of our analysis to mean that women who continue to hold traditional attitudes about marriage

19:34.120 --> 19:40.120
are less likely than other women to consider both premarital sex and divorce as acceptable options for themselves.

19:40.120 --> 19:45.120
It's likely that people who feel constrained by traditional expectations early in life will maintain

19:45.120 --> 19:51.120
this orientation throughout their lives, predisposing them to wait until marriage to begin sexual activity

19:51.120 --> 19:56.120
and to reject divorce as an option if they should become unhappy with their marriage.

19:56.120 --> 20:01.120
And it goes on. So different sorts of people raised in different environments with different values

20:01.120 --> 20:05.120
are acting differently with regards to relationships.

20:05.120 --> 20:10.120
That's what the authors of the study are saying is the likely thing here.

20:10.120 --> 20:14.120
The social pathologist doesn't care about all that rubbish, of course.

20:14.120 --> 20:19.120
To them, the number of someone's sexual partners is all that matters.

20:19.120 --> 20:24.120
They'll strip the data out of the studies in order to make graphs, as they've done for this study,

20:24.120 --> 20:31.120
which measures divorce probabilities of virgins with non-vrijins, whatever they are.

20:31.120 --> 20:38.120
But as for the interpretations of the authors of the studies, the social pathologist seemingly isn't interested.

20:38.120 --> 20:45.120
And there needs to be a word for appealing to authority while rejecting the findings of that authority.

20:45.120 --> 20:49.120
You know, look at this very academic graph I made. It's sourced.

20:49.120 --> 20:57.120
It's using real data from a real academic study written by university professors who I think are wrong.

20:57.120 --> 21:01.120
And there's kind of a weird relationship going on there, you know?

21:01.120 --> 21:07.120
I believe the university professors were on point with their data collection and methodology and calculations,

21:07.120 --> 21:15.120
but when it comes to their interpretations of their study, well, I've got a blog and I believe they're wrong.

21:15.120 --> 21:21.120
Anyway, the next social pathologist link is a guest post by a user named Intrepid.

21:21.120 --> 21:25.120
Now this post is examining National Survey of Family Growth Data,

21:25.120 --> 21:31.120
the same National Survey of Family Growth Data as in the Heritage Foundation study.

21:31.120 --> 21:33.120
So there's those two things again.

21:33.120 --> 21:38.120
Now, we'll be getting to that study fairly soon, so I won't say too much about this post,

21:38.120 --> 21:41.120
except for one thing that I can't help mentioning.

21:42.120 --> 21:45.120
In her video, Lauren Southern states that statistically,

21:45.120 --> 21:52.120
every man or woman sleeps with past one adds to the chances her marriage will later end in divorce.

21:52.120 --> 21:55.120
Now this statement is not true.

21:55.120 --> 22:01.120
And this particular post, which is in Lauren's sources for some reason, explains why.

22:01.120 --> 22:05.120
So let's take a look at Intrepid's charts.

22:05.120 --> 22:08.120
So chart two, which is titled,

22:08.120 --> 22:14.120
Women who have more non-marital partners are more likely to have a first marriage ending in divorce.

22:14.120 --> 22:16.120
And that's what it shows.

22:16.120 --> 22:22.120
The more non-marital partners a woman has had, the likelier her first marriage ends in divorce.

22:22.120 --> 22:24.120
But we've seen this trick before.

22:24.120 --> 22:29.120
This is non-marital partners, not pre-marital partners.

22:29.120 --> 22:36.120
This data is being distorted by including the post-marital sexual relationships of divorcees.

22:36.120 --> 22:39.120
So what happens if we look at the same data,

22:39.120 --> 22:46.120
but instead consider the number of pre-marital partners instead of the number of non-marital partners?

22:46.120 --> 22:50.120
Well, as you can see, it tells a very different story.

22:50.120 --> 22:55.120
In this chart, women who have had five to nine pre-marital sexual partners

22:55.120 --> 23:00.120
are less likely to divorce once married than people who have only had two.

23:00.120 --> 23:02.120
And to quote Intrepid here,

23:02.120 --> 23:07.120
My own hypothesis is that a higher partner count, up to five to nine or so partners,

23:07.120 --> 23:11.120
is correlated with age and maturity in dating experience.

23:11.120 --> 23:15.120
Older women and women with more dating experience are more likely to have learned

23:15.120 --> 23:19.120
which personal qualities will work best for them in a marriage partner.

23:19.120 --> 23:25.120
As a result, such women choose more wisely and tend to experience lower divorce rates.

23:25.120 --> 23:28.120
So then, do you see what's wrong with Lauren Southern's statement?

23:28.120 --> 23:35.120
She fell for the non-marital slash pre-marital switcheroo and got her tenses wrong.

23:35.120 --> 23:41.120
Every man a woman sleeps with past one adds to the chance her marriage will later end in divorce.

23:41.120 --> 23:46.120
This claim is completely contradicted by one of her own sources.

23:46.120 --> 23:49.120
So then, onto the last Blogspot link.

23:49.120 --> 23:55.120
This one titled, More Promiscuity Data, and again written by the social pathologist.

23:55.120 --> 23:58.120
This blog post is concerned with yet another study.

23:58.120 --> 24:03.120
This one titled, Adolescent Sexuality and the Risk of Marital Dissolution,

24:03.120 --> 24:07.120
offered by Anthony Paik for the Journal of Marriage and Family.

24:07.120 --> 24:09.120
And let's read a little of that.

24:09.120 --> 24:13.120
This research investigates whether first sexual intercourse during adolescence

24:13.120 --> 24:17.120
is associated with an increased risk of first marriage dissolution

24:17.120 --> 24:22.120
and tests whether the results are consistent with causal or selection explanations.

24:22.120 --> 24:30.120
Drawing on a sample of 3,793 ever-married women from the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth,

24:30.120 --> 24:34.120
this study estimated event history models of first marriage dissolution.

24:34.120 --> 24:38.120
Results indicated that wanted sexual debut in later adolescence

24:38.120 --> 24:42.120
does not directly increase the risk of marital dissolution

24:42.120 --> 24:47.120
but is linked indirectly as a result of subsequent premarital sexual outcomes.

24:47.120 --> 24:52.120
Sexual debut that is not completely wanted or that occurs before age 16

24:52.120 --> 24:57.120
is associated with increased risk of marital dissolution.

24:57.120 --> 25:01.120
The results suggest that the timing and context of adolescent sexual debut

25:01.120 --> 25:04.120
have important implications for marital stability.

25:04.120 --> 25:10.120
So, similar to what we've seen thus far in the other papers, however, with an important distinction here.

25:10.120 --> 25:16.120
This paper considers whether the adolescent sexual activity was wanted or unwanted,

25:16.120 --> 25:18.120
and that's something we haven't seen so far.

25:18.120 --> 25:24.120
It's an important point because, of course, sadly, sexual activity isn't always a choice.

25:24.120 --> 25:29.120
Someone could be taken advantage of, pressured, or forced into sex,

25:29.120 --> 25:33.120
and it's not hard to think of negative effects upon their later relationships

25:33.120 --> 25:35.120
that might occur as a result of that.

25:35.120 --> 25:40.120
The selectivity argument doesn't apply here, of course, as the author points out.

25:40.120 --> 25:42.120
The conclusion to the paper reads,

25:42.120 --> 25:48.120
Adolescent sexual debut that is not completely wanted is both directly and indirectly linked to marital dissolution.

25:48.120 --> 25:54.120
Because these decisions are not completely voluntary, a choice framework does not apply,

25:54.120 --> 26:00.120
which highlights the need for greater attention to the consequences of unwanted sexual experiences among girls.

26:00.120 --> 26:05.120
Now, we need to be careful when handling this particular data set.

26:05.120 --> 26:09.120
For instance, for an example of what you shouldn't do,

26:09.120 --> 26:15.120
you shouldn't title a blog post about the data more promiscuity data.

26:15.120 --> 26:21.120
You also shouldn't refer to the field of study as the science of slutology.

26:21.120 --> 26:27.120
I mean, you shouldn't do that anyway, but especially not when you're talking about adolescents,

26:27.120 --> 26:29.120
some of whom were sexually assaulted.

26:29.120 --> 26:34.120
You also shouldn't wonder if promiscuity is a mechanism of desolvent,

26:34.120 --> 26:42.120
as in, they've lost their souls as a result of the unwanted, remember, sexual experiences.

26:42.120 --> 26:48.120
You know, what sort of vile, horrible person would say something like that?

26:48.120 --> 26:53.120
Anyway, that's kind of an odd word we just saw there, desolvent.

26:53.120 --> 26:58.120
Now, if you remember, Lauren Southern mentions desolvent in her video.

26:58.120 --> 27:05.120
She says the path of promiscuity and desolvent around eight and a half minutes in.

27:05.120 --> 27:11.120
Phrasing, which is very close to this blog post here, so I'm just gonna assume that this is where she got it from.

27:11.120 --> 27:14.120
Now, we'll leave the social pathologist there for now,

27:14.120 --> 27:19.120
but I will note the final paragraph of that last post starts out with this sentence.

27:19.120 --> 27:24.120
I know that correlation is not causation, but...

27:24.120 --> 27:29.120
Which, wow. I mean, they should make that the new title of their blog, I think.

27:29.120 --> 27:34.120
So that's eight studies down, two studies to go.

27:34.120 --> 27:39.120
Now, there's a reason that none of the links so far have been to actual studies,

27:39.120 --> 27:43.120
and it's because the actual studies keep saying awkward things like,

27:43.120 --> 27:50.120
this is inconclusive, and this needs further research, and this correlates, but we don't know the cause,

27:50.120 --> 27:54.120
and things like that, which would be a bit embarrassing for Lauren.

27:54.120 --> 28:01.120
So she has to link instead to religious conservative blog post reinterpretations of the studies,

28:01.120 --> 28:06.120
blog posts that call adolescent women sluts who've lost their souls.

28:06.120 --> 28:09.120
It's kind of pathetic, really, isn't it?

28:09.120 --> 28:14.120
Anyway, on to the next link, which is a Stefan Molyneux video.

28:14.120 --> 28:17.120
Oh my god. This video is titled,

28:17.120 --> 28:23.120
The Truth About Sex, Facts You Won't Believe Are True, which... yeah, no shit.

28:23.120 --> 28:30.120
So the majority of this video is Stefan reposting a bunch of graphs from the top link in his source list,

28:30.120 --> 28:33.120
which is also the last remaining link in Lauren's source list,

28:33.120 --> 28:38.120
The Harmful Effects of Early Sexual Activity and Multiple Sexual Partners Among Women,

28:38.120 --> 28:41.120
a book of charts from the Heritage Foundation.

28:41.120 --> 28:45.120
So here it is finally. We've been hearing about this for a while.

28:45.120 --> 28:48.120
So who are the Heritage Foundation?

28:48.120 --> 28:50.120
Well, from their website,

28:50.120 --> 28:56.120
the mission of the Heritage Foundation is to formulate and promote conservative public policies

28:56.120 --> 29:01.120
based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, etc.

29:01.120 --> 29:05.120
And it's nice when places just admit they have a bias up front, you know.

29:05.120 --> 29:08.120
So the Heritage Foundation is a conservative think tank,

29:08.120 --> 29:12.120
which, by the way, promotes abstinence-only sex education.

29:12.120 --> 29:16.120
And there are many articles advocating abstinence on their website,

29:16.120 --> 29:20.120
such as this one, Teenage Sexual Abstinence and Academic Achievement,

29:20.120 --> 29:24.120
which was written by Kirk Johnson and Robert Rector,

29:24.120 --> 29:30.120
who are two of the listed authors of The Harmful Effects of Early Sexual Activity study.

29:30.120 --> 29:32.120
So what is in this study, then?

29:32.120 --> 29:36.120
Well, it's just a lot of graphs, really, some of which we've seen already.

29:36.120 --> 29:40.120
Here's them pulling the non-marital slash premarital trick,

29:40.120 --> 29:43.120
and here's that same graph in Stefan's video.

29:43.120 --> 29:46.120
And there's another trick in this particular graph, actually.

29:46.120 --> 29:50.120
It's to do with the Heritage Foundation's definition of a stable marriage,

29:50.120 --> 29:55.120
which they define as a couple being married for at least five years.

29:55.120 --> 30:01.120
Now, the average length of a first marriage that ends in divorce in the United States is eight years.

30:01.120 --> 30:05.120
So a lot of these so-called stable marriages ain't.

30:05.120 --> 30:10.120
You know, why did the Heritage Foundation pick five years to define a stable marriage

30:10.120 --> 30:12.120
when that's below the national average?

30:12.120 --> 30:17.120
Well, I don't know. I suppose five is a nice round number, isn't it?

30:17.120 --> 30:22.120
So the air quotes mistake the Heritage Foundation makes over and over again in this study

30:22.120 --> 30:28.120
is the by now very familiar correlation-slash-causation misunderstanding.

30:28.120 --> 30:31.120
For example, below this graph, which is titled,

30:32.120 --> 30:36.120
is linked to lower levels of child and maternal poverty.

30:36.120 --> 30:38.120
The Heritage Foundation writes,

30:44.120 --> 30:49.120
Now, the problem here is that linked to doesn't mean causes.

30:49.120 --> 30:53.120
And this is the most basic type of logical misunderstanding.

30:53.120 --> 30:57.120
You know, every time the streets are wet outside, it's raining.

30:57.120 --> 31:00.120
Wet streets are linked to rain.

31:00.120 --> 31:04.120
So therefore, the wet streets must be causing the rain.

31:04.120 --> 31:08.120
Early sexual activity is linked to poverty.

31:08.120 --> 31:13.120
But of course, none of the brain geniuses who wrote this paper bothered to consider the reverse,

31:13.120 --> 31:18.120
that poverty could be causing higher levels of early sexual activity.

31:18.120 --> 31:22.120
For example, kids in poverty are less likely to live in a stable home,

31:22.120 --> 31:27.120
less likely to have supportive parents or guardians who can provide guidance for and supervise them.

31:27.120 --> 31:31.120
You know, maybe the poverty is the problem.

31:31.120 --> 31:34.120
Of course, the Heritage Foundation would respond by saying,

31:34.120 --> 31:40.120
hey, we never said sexual activity was the cause of poverty, we just said it was linked to it.

31:40.120 --> 31:44.120
To which I would respond, but you put it in a paper entitled,

31:44.120 --> 31:48.120
The Harmful Effects of Early Sexual Activity.

31:48.120 --> 31:54.120
You know, their attempts to come across as academically neutral didn't extend to titling their paper.

31:54.120 --> 31:57.120
They gave away their bias in the first sentence.

31:57.120 --> 32:00.120
And they make this mistake over and over.

32:00.120 --> 32:04.120
Delay in sexual activity is linked to greater happiness.

32:04.120 --> 32:10.120
Earlier onset of sexual activity is linked to higher turnover rates among sexual partners.

32:10.120 --> 32:13.120
But these are just correlations.

32:13.120 --> 32:16.120
The cause remains unproven here.

32:16.120 --> 32:20.120
This study is a biased hack job.

32:20.120 --> 32:24.120
They took the National Survey of Family Growth Data and routed around in it

32:24.120 --> 32:29.120
looking for particular correlations in order to push an abstinence-only agenda.

32:29.120 --> 32:32.120
Now speaking of that National Survey of Family Growth Data,

32:32.120 --> 32:37.120
it's all available on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.

32:37.120 --> 32:40.120
And I can't help but notice that the National Survey of Family Growth questionnaires

32:40.120 --> 32:44.120
included questions about sex education.

32:44.120 --> 32:50.120
For example, the Cycle 6 questionnaire from 2002 specifically asks about abstinence education.

32:50.120 --> 32:56.120
And one can imagine a study which uses this data to measure the effects of abstinence education

32:56.120 --> 33:00.120
versus the effects of a comprehensive sex education.

33:00.120 --> 33:08.120
It might be titled, Abstinence-Only and Comprehensive Sex Education and the Initiation of Sexual Activity in Teen Pregnancy.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.120
And it might find that,

33:10.120 --> 33:16.120
Adolescents who received comprehensive sex education were significantly less likely to report teen pregnancy

33:16.120 --> 33:19.120
than those who received no formal sex education,

33:19.120 --> 33:23.120
whereas there was no significant effect of abstinence-only education.

33:23.120 --> 33:28.120
Abstinence-only education did not reduce the likelihood of engaging in vaginal intercourse,

33:28.120 --> 33:36.120
but comprehensive sex education was marginally associated with a lower likelihood of reporting having engaged in vaginal intercourse.

33:36.120 --> 33:41.120
Teaching about contraception was not associated with increased risk of adolescent sexual activity.

33:41.120 --> 33:46.120
Adolescents who received comprehensive sex education had a lower risk of pregnancy

33:46.120 --> 33:50.120
than adolescents who received abstinence-only or no sex education.

33:50.120 --> 33:53.120
Imagine if such a study existed.

33:53.120 --> 34:00.120
I wonder what the Heritage Foundation would think about the same source they're attempting to use to push an abstinence-only agenda,

34:00.120 --> 34:05.120
instead being used to prove abstinence-only education is a waste of time.

34:05.120 --> 34:12.120
Now, one last point I'd like to make about this Heritage Foundation study is that it examines data prior to 1995.

34:12.120 --> 34:19.120
And it's the main source in Lauren's video, which she opens with a reality-these-days-is-being-twisted speech.

34:19.120 --> 34:28.120
Now, not to get too personal or anything, but Lauren Southern was born in 1995, after this data was collected.

34:28.120 --> 34:32.120
She has no idea what she's talking about on a personal level.

34:32.120 --> 34:36.120
You know, she's using sources from before she was born.

34:36.120 --> 34:42.120
She's just repeating the opinions of old, crusty white guys from places like the Heritage Foundation.

34:42.120 --> 34:47.120
And that's probably why her references to popular culture are so outdated, too.

34:47.120 --> 34:50.120
You know, Cosmo Magazine and Sex and the City.

34:50.120 --> 34:54.120
I mean, that stopped airing over a decade ago, Lauren.

34:54.120 --> 34:59.120
Now, I bring up Lauren using old data here to mention that there is newer data available.

34:59.120 --> 35:02.120
The National Survey of Family Growth has kept going.

35:02.120 --> 35:07.120
They have up-to-date statistics and studies freely available on their website.

35:07.120 --> 35:12.120
So, why are Lauren's sources so rubbish? I'm forced to wonder.

35:12.120 --> 35:19.120
To recap, there's a bunch of blogspot posts by a conservative Christian who doesn't understand how to read studies properly,

35:19.120 --> 35:26.120
an unsourced listicle, the Wikipedia page of an author who died in 1936 and isn't even mentioned,

35:26.120 --> 35:32.120
a Stefan Molyneux video, and a conservative think tank's abstinence propaganda.

35:32.120 --> 35:36.120
Including this list of sources was a mistake.

35:36.120 --> 35:37.120
Obviously.

35:37.120 --> 35:42.120
Lauren claims that her video isn't a bunch of weirdo religious propaganda,

35:42.120 --> 35:47.120
but looking at the sources, we can see... yes, it is.

35:47.120 --> 35:54.120
Lauren Southern is repeating the same tired, old, debunked conservative talking points that we've all heard a thousand times.

35:55.120 --> 35:58.120
It's an attempt to sell conservatism to young people.

35:58.120 --> 36:04.120
And, of course, because conservatism usually screws over young people, she has to lie.

36:04.120 --> 36:10.120
Now, I'll end here with a plea to any young person who was directed to this video after watching Lauren's

36:10.120 --> 36:14.120
and somehow has managed to stick around through the whole thing.

36:14.120 --> 36:16.120
So, hello.

36:16.120 --> 36:20.120
Please don't take anything Lauren Southern said seriously.

36:20.120 --> 36:22.120
She's a bullshitter.

36:22.120 --> 36:27.120
It's up to you to determine what's gonna make you happy in your own life, not anyone else.

36:27.120 --> 36:32.120
Please don't make life decisions based on a list of statistical likelihoods.

36:32.120 --> 36:35.120
Incorrect statistical likelihoods at that.

36:35.120 --> 36:39.120
You know, you don't want to end up as some sort of robot thinking,

36:39.120 --> 36:48.120
well, I can't have sex with one extra person because then my possible future marriage will have a 4% greater chance of ending in divorce or whatever.

36:48.120 --> 36:54.120
I mean, if that's how you live your life, you'll never be happy regardless of whether you get married or not.

36:54.120 --> 37:00.120
So, live your own life and make your own decisions. That's my advice for you today.
