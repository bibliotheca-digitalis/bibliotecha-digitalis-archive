0	7500	Hello, everyone. This is just a short video to mark the fact that I hit 300,000 subscribers here on YouTube recently,
7500	9200	which is exceedingly neat.
9200	14700	And to celebrate that, I thought I'd answer some questions that were posted at me on Twitter.
14700	16500	And let's just get straight to it.
16500	21000	"@Matrayer underscore asks, what are your thoughts on vanilla Coke?
21000	27000	I'm aware you've tried it, but ever since your 100k Q&A, I've been up at night thinking about this one."
27000	31500	Well, Matrayer underscore, I don't really like vanilla Coke.
31500	38300	I don't hate it or anything, but I can't really foresee myself wanting to drink it over, say, water.
38300	40300	So, I never do.
40300	41160	Right.
41160	48000	"@uliamfuhustle asks, is there a video you'd love to remake slash do over if you got the opportunity to?"
48000	51700	And the answer to that is yes. All of them.
51700	59100	I can only see the mistakes or things I left out or could have phrased better and so on when I watch my old videos,
59100	63400	and I'd like to go back and just take everything down and redo it to be better.
63400	66100	But that can be kind of a black hole, you know?
66100	70500	Just endlessly tinkering with one topic, trying to get it perfect.
70500	74500	I find it helps to focus on trying to make the next thing better.
74500	76900	Not that I have much success.
76900	84000	"@mistandsuch says, being a white-haired cis British man, you do a good job acknowledging your various privilege."
84000	85500	Oh, thank you very much.
85500	91500	Do you ever reach out to groups of people that are not these things, and if so, how do they generally respond to your curiosity?
91500	94200	How do you avoid threatening that space?
94200	96400	Well, I do this occasionally when writing.
96400	102500	I reach out to people for help with a script if I think they'll have more first-hand experience with the topic.
102500	105500	And this is one thing I'd change about my old videos, actually,
105500	109900	since getting this sort of help is a lot easier if you have a bigger platform.
109900	116300	Outside of work, though, I tend to just follow a range of people on Twitter and read what they say.
116300	118300	Can you hear that drilling upstairs?
118300	120700	I don't know if that's picked up on the microphone.
120700	129100	They're like drilling screws into a metal plate, is what it sounds like, and it's been going on for hours.
129100	129800	Anyway.
129800	135400	At Caspian, I suppose, says Bernie or Bust or Blue No Matter Who.
135400	140000	And I have a lot of opinions about this, but I will try to keep it short.
140000	144000	First off, nobody is really blue no matter who.
144000	151000	If David Duke ran as a Democrat for some reason, and then every other candidate spontaneously combusted or whatever,
151000	153100	no Democrats are gonna be like,
153100	156900	blue no matter who, hashtag VoteDuke.
156900	158400	I hope not, anyway.
158400	163000	Also, we should really draw a distinction between the primary and the general.
163000	168200	In the primary, I understand the actions of the My Candidate or Busters,
168200	172200	and I think the Blue No Matter Who folks are jumping the gun a bit.
172200	176100	Threatening to withhold your vote, even if you wouldn't, really,
176100	180200	is a fair tactic to influence the primary, in my opinion, anyway.
180200	187300	When Bernie Sanders wins the primary, though, then I will be 100% blue no matter who.
187300	191600	At Zachary27636551 says,
191600	194400	Why are you so into Bernie when you're a Brit?
194400	197300	And the answer to that is, I'm not, really.
197300	202000	Sanders just represents the best available compromise between my opinions
202000	205100	and what is possible within mainstream politics.
205100	209600	Plus, a Sanders win would be very energizing for the left internationally.
209600	216200	It'd show that even in the United States, with the media and political establishment lined up against the left,
216200	219600	it's still possible to make progress in that system.
219600	223100	And an additional reason for why I care about this when I'm British
223100	229400	is that my country is currently doing everything it can to reduce itself to an American vassal state.
229400	231900	So I don't really have a choice, unfortunately.
231900	233900	At Nini Pins says,
233900	235900	Which political parties do you support?
235900	238900	By that, I mean what? British, American party, and so on.
238900	243200	Well, I don't support political parties unconditionally.
243200	246800	I support them if they support policies that I agree with.
246800	250500	And I think the impulse to identify personally with a party,
250500	255200	as in, I am a Democrat, I am a Republican, I am a Lib Dem, and so on,
255200	258000	I think that's harmful and limiting.
258000	263200	That said, though, I'll support Labour and the Democrats when they're being sensible,
263200	267900	which is, you know, every so often... occasionally.
267900	270100	At Thomas Lock Music says,
270100	273800	In your opinion, what are the biggest reasons for Labour's defeat,
273800	278900	and do you think a socialist Labour could win in the next, or any, future election?
278900	282800	Well, helpfully, in answering this question, there was another general election
282800	286700	just a couple of years before the last one, in which Labour gained seats.
286700	291300	So we can ask what was different between those two elections to lead to the worst performance,
291300	295100	and the big obvious answer is Brexit, right?
295100	302000	So, Brexit's imminence, the way it cut across party lines in a way that hurt Labour more than the Tories,
302000	308700	Labour's changing and unclear policy on Brexit, relative to the Conservatives, anyway,
308700	311200	those were probably the biggest factors.
311200	315200	Labour were in a very tricky position with regards to Brexit,
315200	319000	and it would be easy to say they should have not tried to appeal to both sides
319000	322400	and just picked a hard pro or anti-Brexit stance,
322500	326000	but all of their options would have ended up appealing to some voters,
326000	330600	while still also probably turning off enough other voters to lose the election.
330600	334200	It's very hard to see a path to victory for them at all, to be honest.
334200	338600	It would also be easy to dismiss Corbyn's popularity as a factor here,
338600	343000	since he was also the leader in the previous election, when they did much better.
343000	344900	But that might be too hasty.
344900	348800	It's possible that the constant smearing in the press just took that long
348800	352200	to really penetrate into the opinions of most voters,
352200	356800	maybe the extra two years of negative press really had that much of an effect.
356800	360300	As for whether a socialist Labour could win a future election,
360300	361500	of course they could.
361500	366400	Labour's policies remain popular, we just have to figure out how to get them into government
366400	368500	and get those policies enacted.
368500	370300	At Erwegwert says,
373300	377600	Uh, I don't know, and if you figure it out, please tell me.
377600	379200	At Chrisiosity says,
382400	386600	Well, I've previously answered this question by saying ginger nuts,
386600	391900	but I think they've fallen to second place behind Bourbons, at least for the time being.
391900	393800	Chrisiosity also asks,
402000	403500	What are American biscuits?
403500	406600	Again, they're just like... bread, right?
406600	409400	Just like... bread circles?
409400	411700	I don't know. We call it bread.
411700	413300	At Lacking Saint says,
416100	418500	Okay, I get asked this a lot,
418500	424000	so I think it's time to officially announce the next CinemaSins debunking video.
424000	430400	The next CinemaSins video will be made when I hit one million YouTube subscribers.
430400	432600	Which will never happen.
432600	433900	So never.
433900	436400	At... oh, Caspian again.
436400	441900	Well, you got an extra question. I didn't read who actually asked these until now.
441900	444700	What's your opinion on the dirtbag left?
444700	448900	This is one of those terms that I never quite know what it means,
448900	451600	because I see it used in so many contexts.
451600	459500	If it means leftists who are rude online to blue-check journalists who supported the Iraq War,
459500	462300	then the dirtbag left are good.
462300	466600	If it's being used to mean leftists who like to say racial slurs,
466600	469600	then the dirtbag left are bad, you know?
469600	473400	So, I'm not really sure. It's relative, I suppose.
473400	475100	At Voidburger asks,
476500	481400	Well, I'm sure I will have to go to the United States at some point, right?
481400	483400	When I'm there, we should hang out.
483400	485200	At CaseyExplosion says,
485200	489100	Which do you prefer, my sloth or cow for Sona?
489100	493800	Um, the cow was all right, but I'm a sloth purist, I think.
493800	495400	At CubMoth says,
495400	497100	How many worms?
497100	501400	Just one, but a really big one with a human face.
501400	504300	At waddie underscore 311 says,
504300	508500	Why are a lot of videos from yourself, HarrisNatTC, so long now?
508500	511800	I'm sure it has something to do with YouTube metrics that I don't understand,
511800	515000	but honestly, it just means I have several hours of content in my watch later
515000	517700	and no time to sit around and absorb it.
517700	520100	Well, I can only really speak for myself here,
520100	523000	but one reason is that when your channel is smaller,
523000	526300	you work on projects you know you can get out faster,
526300	529200	because you have to pay rent and bills and the like.
529200	534100	I could have made several videos in the time it took me to make the video about the bell curve, for instance,
534100	537100	and combined, they would have received more views.
537100	541500	And that's a compromise I can afford to make now with a larger channel,
541500	544400	whereas a couple of years ago, I wouldn't have been able to.
544400	547500	So as a smaller channel growing to a larger one,
547500	552600	you sort of sideline all of your longer projects that you're not able to work on right then,
552600	556900	but then when you can work on them, you've got a bunch of very long projects to make, you know.
556900	561500	At Cecilia84379486 says,
561500	567000	Do you think a UBI in the next couple of decades is feasible and desirable?
567000	573200	Feasible, yes. Desirable only if it doesn't come at the expense of other social programs.
573200	576500	I mean, it's no good saying we're gonna give everyone a thousand a month
576500	580500	if we're gonna cut a thousand a month per person at the same time.
580500	582700	At Lily Tranakist says,
582700	588600	Are you planning on doing any more pseudo-response videos like you had for people like Sargon and BPS in the past?
588600	590900	And sure thing, I don't see why not.
590900	596200	All that's really changed in this regard is that I have a rule to only go after really big videos
596200	598500	or channels with more reach than mine has.
598500	604300	So that's usually channels with more subs than me, or particular videos that got a lot of views.
604300	610000	So as my channel grows, the list of available people I can make responses to shrinks.
610000	615300	So if you want to see me go after some tiny channels, you'll all just have to unsubscribe, I suppose.
615300	619900	At Ferilov, the rule of law. I get it.
619900	622700	When will you go on Chappo, Sean?
622700	627000	Uh... never. I will never go on Chappo.
627000	632600	Not because I have any particular antipathy for Chappo, I've never listened to Chappo.
632600	637400	But the number of people who ask me when I'm gonna go on Chappo...
637400	642500	I mean, every time I'm asked, it's an extra week before I'd ever consider it.
642500	645500	I don't even know if they want me to go on there.
645500	647800	Or would know who I was.
647800	649300	Thanks for the question.
650300	652400	At Myopicduck says,
652400	657000	If you could visit any period or event in history, when and where would you go?
657000	657900	Ugh.
657900	664400	Thinking about this, I would probably be incredibly boring and go and look around Rome.
664400	667300	At, say, the height of the Roman Empire.
667300	669000	Jesus Christ.
669000	671100	How uninteresting.
671100	672600	But that is what I would do.
672600	675000	At Flaval97 says,
675000	678100	When will God still your sinful hands?
679700	680700	Jeez.
680700	687200	At Meta Underscore M3 wants to know my thoughts about some responses to my bell curve video.
687200	694900	And my main thought is that so little of the response to the video actually focuses on defending the bell curve.
694900	697000	Mostly from what I've seen, anyway.
697000	703700	They spend their time attacking me and guessing at my motivations and trying to have different arguments.
703700	708300	And I get that it is very difficult to actually defend the book itself.
708300	711400	So you have to pivot to talking about something else.
711400	717600	And once I saw those sorts of responses coming in, I knew I'd stuck the landing with the video.
717600	719600	At Ludo Sivis says,
719600	723300	Will you make a video on refuting the new Charles Murray book?
723300	724300	Um...
724300	725600	Hopefully not.
725600	732200	I mean, I made a video about the bell curve because decades after it was published, people still talk about it.
732200	736800	Charles Murray's new book is called Human Diversity, I think.
736800	742100	And it's possible that in six months no one will ever talk about that book ever again.
742100	745500	And therefore, me reading it would be a huge waste of my time.
745500	747000	So I'm- I'll see.
747000	748600	It depends how well it does.
748600	750400	At Wobbu5 says,
750400	752700	Still water or sparkling water?
752700	754100	Still, obviously.
754100	756000	At RodsRodsRods says,
756000	758600	Your favorite album of all time?
758600	759600	Uh...
759600	763200	I consider music to be kind of a personal thing to talk about.
763200	767400	It's like letting someone read my diary or s- I don't actually have a diary,
767400	773500	but if I did have a diary, I'd feel similarly about sharing that with someone as my musical taste.
773500	774300	Um...
774300	775400	That said,
775400	778500	the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 video game soundtrack.
778500	780700	At NotCecilia,
780700	785600	Seklia84379486 says,
785600	790900	How do we successfully integrate migrants, or is that even a necessity at all?
790900	795100	Well, there's two types of migrants to over-generalize.
795100	799100	There's people who want to move to a place because they like it there,
799100	804900	and the integration mostly takes care of itself on that one over a long enough time period anyway,
804900	806600	although there can still be problems.
806600	810000	And there's people who don't want to go to a place and have to,
810000	812700	you know, either refugees fleeing somewhere dangerous
812700	816800	or economic migrants who move looking for work or a decent wage and so on.
816800	820100	So the best way to successfully integrate migrants
820100	825400	would be to first make there be fewer migrants who would be difficult to integrate.
825400	829200	And that's not through misguided bans or wall building,
829200	835000	but by not bombing and exploiting the areas people are moving away from in the first place.
835000	839500	You don't get to complain that refugees are fleeing a country if you're bombing it
839500	844300	or destabilizing its government or seizing all of its natural resources.
844300	848500	You know, we ousted a government and imposed crushing economic sanctions,
848500	853300	and now that country's in chaos, and people want to leave it, and also they hate us.
853300	854900	Who could have seen that coming?
854900	856900	At Butling...
856900	858900	Butlington Boots.
858900	861500	At Butlington Boots asks,
861500	865800	what accounts for the rise in anti-BreadTube sentiment on the left,
865800	869400	and is there something BreadTube could have done to avoid it?
869400	874400	Well, the thing to remember here is that BreadTube is a label applied from the outside,
874400	876200	by outside observers.
876200	880900	There's no BreadTube Club where we set the BreadTube agenda, you know.
880900	884200	And as for a rise in anti-BreadTube sentiment,
884200	886700	I'm not sure there is one, to be honest.
886700	889300	Things look pretty much the same to me, anyway.
889300	893800	If there are more people who don't like the various lefty content creators on YouTube,
893800	898400	that just seems to me to mainly be because the overall audience is growing.
898400	900800	You know, the more people become aware of you,
900800	904900	the greater number of people are gonna dislike you, unfortunately.
904900	907400	At Sock underscore Womble says,
907400	911000	are you planning on making more videos like your one on privatization?
911000	913800	You rarely have a knack for explaining topics like that.
913800	914600	Thank you very much.
914600	918000	I'd love to see one on Marx's Theory of Labor, for example.
918000	921800	Yes, I had a whole series of videos like that one planned,
921800	924900	but for various reasons it got put on the back burner.
924900	928200	It is still something I'm thinking about returning to, though.
928200	930600	I've learned not to make promises,
930600	934700	but yes, at some unspecified point in the future,
934700	937100	more videos like that one will be made.
937100	938900	At Zoe Brugg says,
938900	943000	how do you feel about the current state of internet discourse?
943000	946800	If you had to critique the way people go about it, what would your big takeaway be?
946800	947500	Thanks.
947500	950100	Well, the main point I would like to make
950100	954800	would be to tell people who argue about the most effective leftist tactics
954800	958700	that there's usually more than one way to skin a cat.
958700	960100	Which is a horrible saying.
960100	963900	So there's usually more than one way to solve a problem.
963900	966300	Different approaches work with different people.
966300	970300	If someone is out there doing something to bring people over to the left,
970300	973900	even if it isn't the exact way you would do it yourself,
973900	976700	I would just live and let live on that.
976700	980800	Instead of arguing about the single best tactic we should all do,
980800	983300	we should instead be doing lots of different things.
983300	986700	You know, this town is big enough for the two of us.
986700	988800	At Cameron Scallman says,
988800	993200	do you think we should censor the alt-right on social media?
993200	993900	Yes.
995900	1003000	Well, it depends exactly what the words we, should, and censor mean in this sentence.
1003000	1007200	Should private companies ban the far right from using their services?
1007200	1008300	Absolutely.
1008300	1012800	Should we as individuals work to deplatform and defund them?
1012800	1013700	Of course.
1013700	1016500	Should the government arrest them, though?
1016500	1020100	Well, if they haven't broken a law, then no.
1020100	1022000	At John Allen Devoe says,
1022000	1023400	how do you like your toast?
1023400	1025000	Very lightly toasted.
1025000	1027300	I basically just like warm bread.
1027300	1030700	At Oatmeal in Leetspeak says,
1030700	1033900	how do you feel about incel ideology or the black pill?
1033900	1035900	Will you ever make a video about it?
1035900	1039400	Well, ContraPoints made a video about this, which was very good.
1039400	1042600	I do have a video about the same thing planned, though,
1042600	1046700	although I had a slightly different angle I was gonna comment it from, so we'll see.
1046700	1049900	Again, no promises on timeframe for that one.
1049900	1052500	But that is something I'm working on, yes.
1052500	1055700	At Nicholas underscore A underscore Cook says,
1055700	1056900	the rule is generally,
1056900	1060700	BS takes ten times as much effort to debunk as it does to create.
1060700	1063200	Have you found any ways to bring that ratio down,
1063200	1067500	or strategies to streamline the process of debunking reactionary nonsense?
1067500	1069100	What's the first step?
1069100	1073300	Well, rather than trying to match the pace and volume of the nonsense,
1073300	1075100	which would be impossible,
1075100	1080000	I found that you can instead use particular approaches to make the instance of debunking
1080000	1083500	much more effective than any individual lie would be.
1083500	1087600	This is something Free Arrows does in his recent video about Black Pigeon Speaks,
1087600	1091100	which is very good, and I'll put a link below so you can check that out.
1091100	1093900	Rather than just point out someone is lying,
1093900	1099000	you can use that lie as a foundation to explain the motivations behind it.
1099000	1104700	And that hopefully will show the audience how to spot similar lies with similar motivations in the future,
1104700	1108800	or at least prompt them to be much more questioning of similar nonsense.
1108800	1111400	At Real Kongo Otto says,
1111400	1116100	do you sometimes feel like there's no point in debunking alt-right myths slash conspiracies,
1116100	1121100	since the people who take them seriously will most likely dismiss you based on your political views?
1121100	1124600	Well, a lot of them will, but a few of them won't.
1124600	1130300	And if a few of them change their minds because of it, then I've won as far as I'm concerned.
1130300	1132600	At A Underscore Googly says,
1132600	1135200	when are you making more video game content?
1135200	1138100	On YouTube, probably never.
1138100	1141600	However, I stream three times a week on Twitch,
1141600	1145100	and I'll put a link to my channel below so you can go and check that out.
1145100	1148100	At Tango Pianista says,
1148100	1150700	how do you define being a leftist for yourself?
1150700	1152800	Is it a term you can gatekeep at all?
1152800	1157900	What are views you think any leftist categorically must have and or not have?
1157900	1162500	Well, this is another video topic I have in mind that I've made a few notes for, actually.
1162500	1168500	Obviously, there's a lot of subjectivity involved with the terminology here, and there are many different factors.
1168500	1173200	But for me, the first thing that jumps to mind when placing someone on the political spectrum
1173200	1176900	is to what extent they have a hierarchical worldview.
1176900	1180700	So people on the right tend to have a more fixed hierarchical worldview
1180700	1184100	with regards to both social issues and economics.
1184100	1187100	Liberals tend to favor a hierarchy,
1187100	1191300	but with air quotes, opportunities for people to move within it.
1191300	1196100	So affordable healthcare and means-tested benefits
1196100	1201500	and student loan debt forgiveness programs for Pell Grant recipients
1201500	1207700	who start a business that operate for three years in disadvantaged communities and other rubbish like that.
1207700	1213300	Conditional equality, basically. You've got the opportunity for equality. How nice.
1213300	1219900	And leftists tend to favor actual equality, so the eradication of the hierarchy.
1219900	1225400	Of course, that's just one aspect of a complicated issue, using terms with different meanings to different people.
1225400	1227600	That's just how I happen to see it.
1227600	1229100	And it's all relative, really.
1229100	1233300	My positions on certain issues see me getting called a centrist by some people
1233300	1236400	and a communist by others at the same time.
1236400	1238800	At Berb on the Internet says,
1238800	1242200	Which non-politically focused YouTubers do you enjoy?
1242200	1246000	And I've paired this with another question from At Hardy Roach,
1246000	1250600	which is, who's the best YouTuber and why is it Jenny Nicholson?
1250600	1256000	And yes, I've been watching a lot of Jenny Nicholson's videos lately and they are excellent.
1256000	1260500	So go and subscribe to Jenny Nicholson's channel if you haven't already.
1260500	1263500	I'll put a link below for you and everything.
1263500	1265800	At SpiderMantiffer says,
1265800	1271900	Would you recommend any cool NB YouTubers with pink hair who make good videos?
1271900	1277500	Well, SpiderMantiffer, it sounds like you should take a peek at the channel named Curio,
1277500	1280200	as I believe they check all your boxes there.
1280200	1286600	I'll again put a link below in the description so that you, or anyone else who wants to see some good Internet videos,
1286600	1288100	can check that channel out.
1288100	1291200	At OneMailA1 says,
1291200	1294100	What are smaller creators you recommend?
1294100	1299700	Well, beyond Curio there, something I've been meaning to do for a while is a little shout-out video
1299700	1302900	pointing people towards some channels that make good content,
1302900	1305800	but maybe don't have the recognition they deserve.
1305800	1309100	I've asked on Twitter a few times for video recommendations,
1309100	1314500	and in further preparation for that eventual video, I will throw it open to the comments here.
1314500	1319800	So, who are some smaller YouTubers who make good content that needs more views?
1319800	1323200	I'd really appreciate all of your input on this.
1323200	1328700	And I've just realized I'm gonna have to read some YouTube comments at some point in the future,
1328700	1331000	which is never a fun experience.
1331000	1336100	Anyway, thank you all so much for watching and subscribing and all that jazz.
1336100	1339000	Free- oh, fucking neighbors, Jesus Christ.
