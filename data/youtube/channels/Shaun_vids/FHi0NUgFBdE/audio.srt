00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,500
Hello, everyone. This is just a short video to mark the fact that I hit 300,000 subscribers here on YouTube recently,

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,200
which is exceedingly neat.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,700
And to celebrate that, I thought I'd answer some questions that were posted at me on Twitter.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,500
And let's just get straight to it.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,000
"@Matrayer underscore asks, what are your thoughts on vanilla Coke?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm aware you've tried it, but ever since your 100k Q&A, I've been up at night thinking about this one."

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,500
Well, Matrayer underscore, I don't really like vanilla Coke.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,300
I don't hate it or anything, but I can't really foresee myself wanting to drink it over, say, water.

9
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,300
So, I never do.

10
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,160
Right.

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:48,000
"@uliamfuhustle asks, is there a video you'd love to remake slash do over if you got the opportunity to?"

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,700
And the answer to that is yes. All of them.

13
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:59,100
I can only see the mistakes or things I left out or could have phrased better and so on when I watch my old videos,

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,400
and I'd like to go back and just take everything down and redo it to be better.

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,100
But that can be kind of a black hole, you know?

16
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,500
Just endlessly tinkering with one topic, trying to get it perfect.

17
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,500
I find it helps to focus on trying to make the next thing better.

18
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,900
Not that I have much success.

19
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:24,000
"@mistandsuch says, being a white-haired cis British man, you do a good job acknowledging your various privilege."

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,500
Oh, thank you very much.

21
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,500
Do you ever reach out to groups of people that are not these things, and if so, how do they generally respond to your curiosity?

22
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,200
How do you avoid threatening that space?

23
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,400
Well, I do this occasionally when writing.

24
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,500
I reach out to people for help with a script if I think they'll have more first-hand experience with the topic.

25
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,500
And this is one thing I'd change about my old videos, actually,

26
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,900
since getting this sort of help is a lot easier if you have a bigger platform.

27
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:56,300
Outside of work, though, I tend to just follow a range of people on Twitter and read what they say.

28
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,300
Can you hear that drilling upstairs?

29
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,700
I don't know if that's picked up on the microphone.

30
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:09,100
They're like drilling screws into a metal plate, is what it sounds like, and it's been going on for hours.

31
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:09,800
Anyway.

32
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,400
At Caspian, I suppose, says Bernie or Bust or Blue No Matter Who.

33
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,000
And I have a lot of opinions about this, but I will try to keep it short.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
First off, nobody is really blue no matter who.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
If David Duke ran as a Democrat for some reason, and then every other candidate spontaneously combusted or whatever,

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,100
no Democrats are gonna be like,

37
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,900
blue no matter who, hashtag VoteDuke.

38
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,400
I hope not, anyway.

39
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,000
Also, we should really draw a distinction between the primary and the general.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,200
In the primary, I understand the actions of the My Candidate or Busters,

41
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,200
and I think the Blue No Matter Who folks are jumping the gun a bit.

42
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,100
Threatening to withhold your vote, even if you wouldn't, really,

43
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,200
is a fair tactic to influence the primary, in my opinion, anyway.

44
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:07,300
When Bernie Sanders wins the primary, though, then I will be 100% blue no matter who.

45
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,600
At Zachary27636551 says,

46
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,400
Why are you so into Bernie when you're a Brit?

47
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,300
And the answer to that is, I'm not, really.

48
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:22,000
Sanders just represents the best available compromise between my opinions

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,100
and what is possible within mainstream politics.

50
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,600
Plus, a Sanders win would be very energizing for the left internationally.

51
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:36,200
It'd show that even in the United States, with the media and political establishment lined up against the left,

52
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,600
it's still possible to make progress in that system.

53
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,100
And an additional reason for why I care about this when I'm British

54
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:49,400
is that my country is currently doing everything it can to reduce itself to an American vassal state.

55
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,900
So I don't really have a choice, unfortunately.

56
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,900
At Nini Pins says,

57
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,900
Which political parties do you support?

58
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,900
By that, I mean what? British, American party, and so on.

59
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,200
Well, I don't support political parties unconditionally.

60
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,800
I support them if they support policies that I agree with.

61
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,500
And I think the impulse to identify personally with a party,

62
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,200
as in, I am a Democrat, I am a Republican, I am a Lib Dem, and so on,

63
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,000
I think that's harmful and limiting.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,200
That said, though, I'll support Labour and the Democrats when they're being sensible,

65
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,900
which is, you know, every so often... occasionally.

66
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,100
At Thomas Lock Music says,

67
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,800
In your opinion, what are the biggest reasons for Labour's defeat,

68
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,900
and do you think a socialist Labour could win in the next, or any, future election?

69
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,800
Well, helpfully, in answering this question, there was another general election

70
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,700
just a couple of years before the last one, in which Labour gained seats.

71
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:51,300
So we can ask what was different between those two elections to lead to the worst performance,

72
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,100
and the big obvious answer is Brexit, right?

73
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:02,000
So, Brexit's imminence, the way it cut across party lines in a way that hurt Labour more than the Tories,

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,700
Labour's changing and unclear policy on Brexit, relative to the Conservatives, anyway,

75
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,200
those were probably the biggest factors.

76
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,200
Labour were in a very tricky position with regards to Brexit,

77
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,000
and it would be easy to say they should have not tried to appeal to both sides

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,400
and just picked a hard pro or anti-Brexit stance,

79
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,000
but all of their options would have ended up appealing to some voters,

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,600
while still also probably turning off enough other voters to lose the election.

81
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,200
It's very hard to see a path to victory for them at all, to be honest.

82
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,600
It would also be easy to dismiss Corbyn's popularity as a factor here,

83
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,000
since he was also the leader in the previous election, when they did much better.

84
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,900
But that might be too hasty.

85
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,800
It's possible that the constant smearing in the press just took that long

86
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,200
to really penetrate into the opinions of most voters,

87
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,800
maybe the extra two years of negative press really had that much of an effect.

88
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,300
As for whether a socialist Labour could win a future election,

89
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,500
of course they could.

90
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,400
Labour's policies remain popular, we just have to figure out how to get them into government

91
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,500
and get those policies enacted.

92
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,300
At Erwegwert says,

93
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,600
Uh, I don't know, and if you figure it out, please tell me.

94
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,200
At Chrisiosity says,

95
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,600
Well, I've previously answered this question by saying ginger nuts,

96
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,900
but I think they've fallen to second place behind Bourbons, at least for the time being.

97
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,800
Chrisiosity also asks,

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,500
What are American biscuits?

99
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,600
Again, they're just like... bread, right?

100
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,400
Just like... bread circles?

101
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,700
I don't know. We call it bread.

102
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,300
At Lacking Saint says,

103
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,500
Okay, I get asked this a lot,

104
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,000
so I think it's time to officially announce the next CinemaSins debunking video.

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,400
The next CinemaSins video will be made when I hit one million YouTube subscribers.

106
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,600
Which will never happen.

107
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,900
So never.

108
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,400
At... oh, Caspian again.

109
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,900
Well, you got an extra question. I didn't read who actually asked these until now.

110
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,700
What's your opinion on the dirtbag left?

111
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,900
This is one of those terms that I never quite know what it means,

112
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,600
because I see it used in so many contexts.

113
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:39,500
If it means leftists who are rude online to blue-check journalists who supported the Iraq War,

114
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,300
then the dirtbag left are good.

115
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,600
If it's being used to mean leftists who like to say racial slurs,

116
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,600
then the dirtbag left are bad, you know?

117
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,400
So, I'm not really sure. It's relative, I suppose.

118
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,100
At Voidburger asks,

119
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,400
Well, I'm sure I will have to go to the United States at some point, right?

120
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,400
When I'm there, we should hang out.

121
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,200
At CaseyExplosion says,

122
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,100
Which do you prefer, my sloth or cow for Sona?

123
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,800
Um, the cow was all right, but I'm a sloth purist, I think.

124
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,400
At CubMoth says,

125
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,100
How many worms?

126
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,400
Just one, but a really big one with a human face.

127
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,300
At waddie underscore 311 says,

128
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,500
Why are a lot of videos from yourself, HarrisNatTC, so long now?

129
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,800
I'm sure it has something to do with YouTube metrics that I don't understand,

130
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,000
but honestly, it just means I have several hours of content in my watch later

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,700
and no time to sit around and absorb it.

132
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,100
Well, I can only really speak for myself here,

133
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,000
but one reason is that when your channel is smaller,

134
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,300
you work on projects you know you can get out faster,

135
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,200
because you have to pay rent and bills and the like.

136
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,100
I could have made several videos in the time it took me to make the video about the bell curve, for instance,

137
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,100
and combined, they would have received more views.

138
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,500
And that's a compromise I can afford to make now with a larger channel,

139
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,400
whereas a couple of years ago, I wouldn't have been able to.

140
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,500
So as a smaller channel growing to a larger one,

141
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,600
you sort of sideline all of your longer projects that you're not able to work on right then,

142
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,900
but then when you can work on them, you've got a bunch of very long projects to make, you know.

143
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,500
At Cecilia84379486 says,

144
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:27,000
Do you think a UBI in the next couple of decades is feasible and desirable?

145
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,200
Feasible, yes. Desirable only if it doesn't come at the expense of other social programs.

146
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,500
I mean, it's no good saying we're gonna give everyone a thousand a month

147
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,500
if we're gonna cut a thousand a month per person at the same time.

148
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,700
At Lily Tranakist says,

149
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:48,600
Are you planning on doing any more pseudo-response videos like you had for people like Sargon and BPS in the past?

150
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,900
And sure thing, I don't see why not.

151
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:56,200
All that's really changed in this regard is that I have a rule to only go after really big videos

152
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,500
or channels with more reach than mine has.

153
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:04,300
So that's usually channels with more subs than me, or particular videos that got a lot of views.

154
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:10,000
So as my channel grows, the list of available people I can make responses to shrinks.

155
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,300
So if you want to see me go after some tiny channels, you'll all just have to unsubscribe, I suppose.

156
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,900
At Ferilov, the rule of law. I get it.

157
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,700
When will you go on Chappo, Sean?

158
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:27,000
Uh... never. I will never go on Chappo.

159
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,600
Not because I have any particular antipathy for Chappo, I've never listened to Chappo.

160
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,400
But the number of people who ask me when I'm gonna go on Chappo...

161
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,500
I mean, every time I'm asked, it's an extra week before I'd ever consider it.

162
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,500
I don't even know if they want me to go on there.

163
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,800
Or would know who I was.

164
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,300
Thanks for the question.

165
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,400
At Myopicduck says,

166
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,000
If you could visit any period or event in history, when and where would you go?

167
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,900
Ugh.

168
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:04,400
Thinking about this, I would probably be incredibly boring and go and look around Rome.

169
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,300
At, say, the height of the Roman Empire.

170
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,000
Jesus Christ.

171
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,100
How uninteresting.

172
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,600
But that is what I would do.

173
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,000
At Flaval97 says,

174
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,100
When will God still your sinful hands?

175
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,700
Jeez.

176
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:27,200
At Meta Underscore M3 wants to know my thoughts about some responses to my bell curve video.

177
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:34,900
And my main thought is that so little of the response to the video actually focuses on defending the bell curve.

178
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,000
Mostly from what I've seen, anyway.

179
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,700
They spend their time attacking me and guessing at my motivations and trying to have different arguments.

180
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,300
And I get that it is very difficult to actually defend the book itself.

181
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,400
So you have to pivot to talking about something else.

182
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:57,600
And once I saw those sorts of responses coming in, I knew I'd stuck the landing with the video.

183
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
At Ludo Sivis says,

184
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,300
Will you make a video on refuting the new Charles Murray book?

185
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,300
Um...

186
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,600
Hopefully not.

187
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:12,200
I mean, I made a video about the bell curve because decades after it was published, people still talk about it.

188
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,800
Charles Murray's new book is called Human Diversity, I think.

189
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,100
And it's possible that in six months no one will ever talk about that book ever again.

190
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,500
And therefore, me reading it would be a huge waste of my time.

191
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,000
So I'm- I'll see.

192
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,600
It depends how well it does.

193
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,400
At Wobbu5 says,

194
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,700
Still water or sparkling water?

195
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,100
Still, obviously.

196
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,000
At RodsRodsRods says,

197
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,600
Your favorite album of all time?

198
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,600
Uh...

199
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,200
I consider music to be kind of a personal thing to talk about.

200
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,400
It's like letting someone read my diary or s- I don't actually have a diary,

201
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:53,500
but if I did have a diary, I'd feel similarly about sharing that with someone as my musical taste.

202
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,300
Um...

203
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,400
That said,

204
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,500
the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 video game soundtrack.

205
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,700
At NotCecilia,

206
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:05,600
Seklia84379486 says,

207
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,900
How do we successfully integrate migrants, or is that even a necessity at all?

208
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:15,100
Well, there's two types of migrants to over-generalize.

209
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,100
There's people who want to move to a place because they like it there,

210
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:24,900
and the integration mostly takes care of itself on that one over a long enough time period anyway,

211
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,600
although there can still be problems.

212
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,000
And there's people who don't want to go to a place and have to,

213
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,700
you know, either refugees fleeing somewhere dangerous

214
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,800
or economic migrants who move looking for work or a decent wage and so on.

215
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,100
So the best way to successfully integrate migrants

216
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:45,400
would be to first make there be fewer migrants who would be difficult to integrate.

217
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,200
And that's not through misguided bans or wall building,

218
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:55,000
but by not bombing and exploiting the areas people are moving away from in the first place.

219
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,500
You don't get to complain that refugees are fleeing a country if you're bombing it

220
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,300
or destabilizing its government or seizing all of its natural resources.

221
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,500
You know, we ousted a government and imposed crushing economic sanctions,

222
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:13,300
and now that country's in chaos, and people want to leave it, and also they hate us.

223
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,900
Who could have seen that coming?

224
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,900
At Butling...

225
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,900
Butlington Boots.

226
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,500
At Butlington Boots asks,

227
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,800
what accounts for the rise in anti-BreadTube sentiment on the left,

228
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,400
and is there something BreadTube could have done to avoid it?

229
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:34,400
Well, the thing to remember here is that BreadTube is a label applied from the outside,

230
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,200
by outside observers.

231
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,900
There's no BreadTube Club where we set the BreadTube agenda, you know.

232
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,200
And as for a rise in anti-BreadTube sentiment,

233
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,700
I'm not sure there is one, to be honest.

234
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,300
Things look pretty much the same to me, anyway.

235
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,800
If there are more people who don't like the various lefty content creators on YouTube,

236
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,400
that just seems to me to mainly be because the overall audience is growing.

237
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,800
You know, the more people become aware of you,

238
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,900
the greater number of people are gonna dislike you, unfortunately.

239
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,400
At Sock underscore Womble says,

240
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,000
are you planning on making more videos like your one on privatization?

241
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,800
You rarely have a knack for explaining topics like that.

242
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,600
Thank you very much.

243
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,000
I'd love to see one on Marx's Theory of Labor, for example.

244
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,800
Yes, I had a whole series of videos like that one planned,

245
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,900
but for various reasons it got put on the back burner.

246
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,200
It is still something I'm thinking about returning to, though.

247
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,600
I've learned not to make promises,

248
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,700
but yes, at some unspecified point in the future,

249
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,100
more videos like that one will be made.

250
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,900
At Zoe Brugg says,

251
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:43,000
how do you feel about the current state of internet discourse?

252
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,800
If you had to critique the way people go about it, what would your big takeaway be?

253
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,500
Thanks.

254
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,100
Well, the main point I would like to make

255
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,800
would be to tell people who argue about the most effective leftist tactics

256
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,700
that there's usually more than one way to skin a cat.

257
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,100
Which is a horrible saying.

258
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,900
So there's usually more than one way to solve a problem.

259
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,300
Different approaches work with different people.

260
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,300
If someone is out there doing something to bring people over to the left,

261
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,900
even if it isn't the exact way you would do it yourself,

262
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,700
I would just live and let live on that.

263
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,800
Instead of arguing about the single best tactic we should all do,

264
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,300
we should instead be doing lots of different things.

265
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,700
You know, this town is big enough for the two of us.

266
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,800
At Cameron Scallman says,

267
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,200
do you think we should censor the alt-right on social media?

268
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:33,900
Yes.

269
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:43,000
Well, it depends exactly what the words we, should, and censor mean in this sentence.

270
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,200
Should private companies ban the far right from using their services?

271
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,300
Absolutely.

272
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,800
Should we as individuals work to deplatform and defund them?

273
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,700
Of course.

274
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,500
Should the government arrest them, though?

275
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,100
Well, if they haven't broken a law, then no.

276
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,000
At John Allen Devoe says,

277
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,400
how do you like your toast?

278
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,000
Very lightly toasted.

279
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,300
I basically just like warm bread.

280
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,700
At Oatmeal in Leetspeak says,

281
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,900
how do you feel about incel ideology or the black pill?

282
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,900
Will you ever make a video about it?

283
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,400
Well, ContraPoints made a video about this, which was very good.

284
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,600
I do have a video about the same thing planned, though,

285
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,700
although I had a slightly different angle I was gonna comment it from, so we'll see.

286
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,900
Again, no promises on timeframe for that one.

287
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,500
But that is something I'm working on, yes.

288
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,700
At Nicholas underscore A underscore Cook says,

289
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,900
the rule is generally,

290
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,700
BS takes ten times as much effort to debunk as it does to create.

291
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,200
Have you found any ways to bring that ratio down,

292
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,500
or strategies to streamline the process of debunking reactionary nonsense?

293
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,100
What's the first step?

294
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,300
Well, rather than trying to match the pace and volume of the nonsense,

295
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,100
which would be impossible,

296
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:00,000
I found that you can instead use particular approaches to make the instance of debunking

297
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,500
much more effective than any individual lie would be.

298
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,600
This is something Free Arrows does in his recent video about Black Pigeon Speaks,

299
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,100
which is very good, and I'll put a link below so you can check that out.

300
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,900
Rather than just point out someone is lying,

301
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:19,000
you can use that lie as a foundation to explain the motivations behind it.

302
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,700
And that hopefully will show the audience how to spot similar lies with similar motivations in the future,

303
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,800
or at least prompt them to be much more questioning of similar nonsense.

304
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,400
At Real Kongo Otto says,

305
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,100
do you sometimes feel like there's no point in debunking alt-right myths slash conspiracies,

306
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:41,100
since the people who take them seriously will most likely dismiss you based on your political views?

307
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,600
Well, a lot of them will, but a few of them won't.

308
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:50,300
And if a few of them change their minds because of it, then I've won as far as I'm concerned.

309
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,600
At A Underscore Googly says,

310
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,200
when are you making more video game content?

311
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,100
On YouTube, probably never.

312
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,600
However, I stream three times a week on Twitch,

313
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,100
and I'll put a link to my channel below so you can go and check that out.

314
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,100
At Tango Pianista says,

315
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,700
how do you define being a leftist for yourself?

316
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,800
Is it a term you can gatekeep at all?

317
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,900
What are views you think any leftist categorically must have and or not have?

318
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,500
Well, this is another video topic I have in mind that I've made a few notes for, actually.

319
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:28,500
Obviously, there's a lot of subjectivity involved with the terminology here, and there are many different factors.

320
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,200
But for me, the first thing that jumps to mind when placing someone on the political spectrum

321
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,900
is to what extent they have a hierarchical worldview.

322
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,700
So people on the right tend to have a more fixed hierarchical worldview

323
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,100
with regards to both social issues and economics.

324
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,100
Liberals tend to favor a hierarchy,

325
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,300
but with air quotes, opportunities for people to move within it.

326
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:56,100
So affordable healthcare and means-tested benefits

327
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:01,500
and student loan debt forgiveness programs for Pell Grant recipients

328
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:07,700
who start a business that operate for three years in disadvantaged communities and other rubbish like that.

329
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:13,300
Conditional equality, basically. You've got the opportunity for equality. How nice.

330
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:19,900
And leftists tend to favor actual equality, so the eradication of the hierarchy.

331
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:25,400
Of course, that's just one aspect of a complicated issue, using terms with different meanings to different people.

332
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,600
That's just how I happen to see it.

333
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,100
And it's all relative, really.

334
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:33,300
My positions on certain issues see me getting called a centrist by some people

335
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,400
and a communist by others at the same time.

336
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,800
At Berb on the Internet says,

337
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,200
Which non-politically focused YouTubers do you enjoy?

338
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,000
And I've paired this with another question from At Hardy Roach,

339
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,600
which is, who's the best YouTuber and why is it Jenny Nicholson?

340
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:56,000
And yes, I've been watching a lot of Jenny Nicholson's videos lately and they are excellent.

341
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,500
So go and subscribe to Jenny Nicholson's channel if you haven't already.

342
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,500
I'll put a link below for you and everything.

343
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,800
At SpiderMantiffer says,

344
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,900
Would you recommend any cool NB YouTubers with pink hair who make good videos?

345
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:17,500
Well, SpiderMantiffer, it sounds like you should take a peek at the channel named Curio,

346
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,200
as I believe they check all your boxes there.

347
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:26,600
I'll again put a link below in the description so that you, or anyone else who wants to see some good Internet videos,

348
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,100
can check that channel out.

349
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,200
At OneMailA1 says,

350
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,100
What are smaller creators you recommend?

351
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:39,700
Well, beyond Curio there, something I've been meaning to do for a while is a little shout-out video

352
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,900
pointing people towards some channels that make good content,

353
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,800
but maybe don't have the recognition they deserve.

354
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,100
I've asked on Twitter a few times for video recommendations,

355
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:54,500
and in further preparation for that eventual video, I will throw it open to the comments here.

356
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:59,800
So, who are some smaller YouTubers who make good content that needs more views?

357
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,200
I'd really appreciate all of your input on this.

358
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,700
And I've just realized I'm gonna have to read some YouTube comments at some point in the future,

359
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,000
which is never a fun experience.

360
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,100
Anyway, thank you all so much for watching and subscribing and all that jazz.

361
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,000
Free- oh, fucking neighbors, Jesus Christ.
