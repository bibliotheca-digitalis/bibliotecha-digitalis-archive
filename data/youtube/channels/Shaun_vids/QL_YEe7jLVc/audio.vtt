00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
Hello everyone. Today we're going to be talking about statistics and studies.

00:04.560 --> 00:06.160
And doesn't that sound fun?

00:06.160 --> 00:11.360
And specifically, I'd like to have a bit of a think about how traditional news media reports on studies,

00:11.360 --> 00:13.760
as well as what you see here on YouTube.

00:13.760 --> 00:19.600
And our lab rat who's going to be helping us out today is YouTuber BlackPigeonSpeaks, and why him?

00:19.600 --> 00:27.200
Well, in my opinion, BlackPigeonSpeaks is consistently among the most shameless in his misuse of sources and statistics.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.120
And the video I'm going to feature here,

00:29.120 --> 00:34.000
Something is Rotten in the State Denmark, is particularly bad for it.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.520
So then, this video.

00:35.520 --> 00:41.840
Well, first of all, I'd like to apologize to Denmark on behalf of my fellow countrymen, William Shakespeare,

00:41.840 --> 00:45.040
for how often I imagine they have to hear that sentence.

00:45.040 --> 00:46.640
It must be terrifically annoying.

00:46.640 --> 00:51.760
I imagine scarcely anything can happen in Denmark without some chump quoting that line.

00:52.240 --> 00:54.640
But anyway, what is this video about?

00:54.640 --> 00:57.040
Well, it doesn't really matter, to be honest.

00:57.040 --> 01:00.960
It's just another in BlackPigeonSpeaks' long line of anti-immigrant videos,

01:00.960 --> 01:07.200
where he explains how if you let a single non-white person into your country, it turns into Mordor or something.

01:07.200 --> 01:12.240
Today's country is Denmark, but he's made similar videos proclaiming the imminent downfall of Sweden,

01:12.240 --> 01:15.200
the UK, Germany, the United States, etc.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.560
You know, the same old rubbish.

01:17.200 --> 01:23.280
What I am interested in in this video are the statistics and sources that BlackPigeon cites at the start of the video.

01:23.280 --> 01:24.880
And let's take a look at that.

01:53.280 --> 01:57.520
But are they true?

01:57.520 --> 02:02.320
There are many examples of studies that refute not only these common assertions,

02:02.320 --> 02:08.080
but in fact demonstrate that not only does mass immigration not help destination countries,

02:08.080 --> 02:14.080
but in fact becomes a major financial burden for the native tax-paying population.

02:14.080 --> 02:17.440
In Canada, for example, a recent long-term study has shown that

02:17.440 --> 02:22.080
immigrants impose a huge fiscal burden on Canadian taxpayers.

02:22.080 --> 02:26.720
This is the result of immigrants paying about half as much in income tax as other Canadians,

02:26.720 --> 02:29.760
but absorbing nearly the same value of government services,

02:29.760 --> 02:34.000
costing taxpayers roughly $6,051 per immigrant,

02:34.000 --> 02:43.040
and amounting to a total annual cost of somewhere between $16.3 billion and $23.6 billion dollars.

02:43.040 --> 02:45.360
These findings are also mirrored in the US,

02:45.360 --> 02:50.480
where an authoritative study by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine

02:50.480 --> 02:59.040
found that immigration drains the government, sapping as much as $296 billion dollars a year

02:59.040 --> 03:05.840
from the federal, state, and local taxpayers, while depressing wages, at least in the short run.

03:05.840 --> 03:10.000
The data shows that immigrants take more in benefits than they pay in taxes.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
Although immigrants do boost the size of the economy, the gains are heavily skewed

03:14.000 --> 03:17.680
toward the immigrants themselves and to wealthy investors,

03:17.680 --> 03:22.400
not to native-born workers who end up competing with the new arrivals.

03:22.400 --> 03:25.520
The same can be said in the UK, where a recent report concluded that

03:25.520 --> 03:29.840
migrants contributed much less in taxes than they used in government services,

03:29.840 --> 03:36.800
and like in Canada and the US, immigrants on the whole are a negative drain upon the countries they enter.

03:36.800 --> 03:42.240
The crippling £17 billion annual shortfall in the UK is pretty much replicated

03:42.240 --> 03:46.320
in every country that is targeted with mass immigration.

03:46.320 --> 03:50.160
The problem with these studies is that regardless of being non-partisan,

03:50.160 --> 03:54.160
regardless of being bulletproof in terms of statistics and conclusions,

03:54.160 --> 04:01.040
there will always be those on the left that want to continue to import new dependent voter blocks,

04:01.040 --> 04:05.920
and those on the right that want to import a more malleable and cheaper workforce

04:05.920 --> 04:10.560
that drives down wages, that somehow the numbers are being skewed.

04:10.560 --> 04:15.200
So Black Pigeon rattles off a few pro-immigrant arguments and then says they're invalid

04:15.200 --> 04:18.640
because they're refuted by the stats, and he cites three studies

04:18.640 --> 04:22.240
which are supposedly non-partisan and statistically bulletproof.

04:22.240 --> 04:27.040
Those studies being, in America, the Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration

04:27.040 --> 04:30.800
by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine,

04:30.800 --> 04:36.560
in Canada, Immigration and the Canadian Welfare State 2011 by the Fraser Institute,

04:36.560 --> 04:41.520
and in the UK, the Fiscal Effects of Immigration to the UK 2014-15

04:41.520 --> 04:44.880
by the very non-partisan Migration Watch UK.

04:45.680 --> 04:46.320
Hmm.

04:46.320 --> 04:51.600
So let's take a look at these three papers and test out just how statistically bulletproof they are,

04:51.600 --> 04:56.640
and we'll do the most fun one first, which is the American one, because why not?

04:56.640 --> 04:59.760
Now I like this one the most because in his introduction there,

04:59.760 --> 05:03.520
Black Pigeon railed against the supposed pro-immigrant narrative

05:03.520 --> 05:06.640
of Western governments' academia and, quote,

05:06.640 --> 05:12.240
But then to counter that narrative, he cites a Washington Times article

05:12.240 --> 05:16.800
talking about an academic research paper put out by the National Academies.

05:16.800 --> 05:20.800
So if the press, governments and academics want to push a pro-immigrant message,

05:20.800 --> 05:23.360
they seemingly shot themselves in the foot this time.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.760
Or have they?

05:25.760 --> 05:29.760
You see, the other fun thing here is that Black Pigeon shows the results of this study

05:29.760 --> 05:33.600
via a stupid headline on a biased conservative news website.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.200
Now, we're not gonna do that.

05:35.200 --> 05:38.000
We're gonna cut out the middleman and go right to the source

05:38.000 --> 05:42.240
and read the press release that the authors of the report put out alongside it.

05:42.240 --> 05:45.280
And I'm gonna read the whole summary of this report's conclusions here,

05:45.280 --> 05:47.760
just so you can be sure I'm not missing anything out.

06:03.600 --> 06:08.400
...who are often the closest substitutes for immigrant workers with low skills.

06:08.400 --> 06:11.200
There is little evidence that immigration significantly affects

06:11.200 --> 06:14.000
the overall employment levels of native-born workers.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.040
As with wage impacts, there is some evidence that recent immigrants

06:17.040 --> 06:19.280
reduce the employment rate of prior immigrants.

06:19.280 --> 06:23.280
In addition, recent research finds that immigration reduces the numbers of hours

06:23.280 --> 06:26.560
worked by native teens, but not their employment levels.

06:26.560 --> 06:30.160
Some evidence on inflow of skilled immigrants suggests that there may be

06:30.160 --> 06:33.280
positive wage effects for some subgroups of native-born workers,

06:33.360 --> 06:36.000
and other benefits to the economy more broadly.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.440
Immigration has an overall positive impact on long-run economic growth in the US.

06:41.440 --> 06:45.760
In terms of fiscal impacts, first-generation immigrants are more costly to governments,

06:45.760 --> 06:48.720
mainly at the state and local levels, than are the native-born,

06:48.720 --> 06:51.840
in large part due to the costs of educating their children.

06:51.840 --> 06:55.760
However, as adults, the children of immigrants, the second generation,

06:55.760 --> 06:59.600
are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the US population,

06:59.600 --> 07:02.480
contributing more in taxes than either their parents,

07:02.480 --> 07:05.120
or the rest of the native-born population.

07:05.120 --> 07:08.560
Over the long term, the impacts of immigrants on government budgets

07:08.560 --> 07:10.480
are generally positive at the federal level,

07:10.480 --> 07:12.720
but remain negative at the state and local level,

07:12.720 --> 07:16.480
but these generalizations are subject to a number of important assumptions.

07:16.480 --> 07:20.240
Immigration's fiscal effects vary tremendously across states.

07:21.120 --> 07:21.920
I'm done.

07:21.920 --> 07:24.240
So, to summarize the summary there,

07:24.240 --> 07:27.680
immigration has an overall positive impact on the economy,

07:27.680 --> 07:30.880
although there can be short-term negative effects on a local level,

07:30.880 --> 07:32.640
depending on various factors.

07:32.640 --> 07:34.400
And I'm not an expert by any means,

07:34.400 --> 07:38.320
but I have had to read a few similar studies in the course of my time here on the internet,

07:38.320 --> 07:40.640
and this is the result they generally all come to.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.560
Well, the reputable ones anyway,

07:42.560 --> 07:46.480
the ones that aren't put out by think tanks with names like Migration Watch.

07:46.480 --> 07:49.680
So then, Black Pigeon, there's your first bulletproof source,

07:49.680 --> 07:54.400
the one that came to the conclusion that immigration is a net positive for the economy.

07:55.280 --> 07:56.880
However, you might be wondering,

07:56.880 --> 07:59.280
how did the Washington Times read all this,

07:59.280 --> 08:01.440
and then put out a story with the headline,

08:01.440 --> 08:07.840
Mass Immigration Costs Government $296 Billion a Year Depresses Wages?

08:07.840 --> 08:08.880
You know, why not?

08:08.880 --> 08:12.320
New study finds immigrants have positive impact on economy.

08:12.320 --> 08:15.120
Well, that's because they're very, very sneaky.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.160
You see, at one point,

08:16.160 --> 08:19.920
the paper in question examines the spread of eight alternate scenarios

08:19.920 --> 08:23.040
for measuring the fiscal impact of immigration in 2013,

08:23.040 --> 08:26.800
and controlling for various factors, they get eight different results.

08:26.960 --> 08:29.120
And I'm gonna read you something right now from that section.

08:29.120 --> 08:31.920
That probably isn't gonna make much sense, but here we go.

08:31.920 --> 08:36.080
Most, but not all, of the increase in the fiscal ratio for the first generation group

08:36.080 --> 08:38.880
is linked to the change in the public goods assumption

08:38.880 --> 08:42.160
that results in vastly reduced federal spending on this group,

08:42.160 --> 08:46.080
from an estimate of $9,000 per individual in Scenario 1,

08:46.080 --> 08:49.120
down to $6,000 in Scenario 5,

08:49.120 --> 08:54.800
a reduction that raises the ratio of receipts to outlays from 0.7 to 1.1.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.720
Now, to translate,

08:56.720 --> 08:59.200
depending on how you measure the impact of immigration,

08:59.200 --> 09:00.960
you can wind up with different results,

09:00.960 --> 09:02.640
and in the best case scenarios,

09:02.640 --> 09:06.000
immigrants pay more to the federal government than they receive back,

09:06.000 --> 09:08.960
and in the worst case scenarios, the opposite is true.

09:08.960 --> 09:10.240
So, a question.

09:10.240 --> 09:13.920
Where do you imagine The Washington Times got this figure from?

09:13.920 --> 09:17.120
Was it from the worst possible projected scenario?

09:18.000 --> 09:19.440
Yes, it was.

09:19.440 --> 09:20.560
Of course it was.

09:20.560 --> 09:24.000
So, the study came up with a range of eight different possibilities,

09:24.000 --> 09:26.640
and The Washington Times cherry-picked the worst one,

09:26.640 --> 09:28.480
and then wrote a headline that made it look like

09:28.480 --> 09:31.120
that was the overall result of the study.

09:31.120 --> 09:32.800
Highly sneaky behavior there.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.920
However, as awful as it is,

09:35.920 --> 09:38.320
The Washington Times at least divulges

09:38.320 --> 09:40.800
that this is how it came up with the figure in the headline,

09:40.800 --> 09:44.160
and also quotes the leader of the panel that wrote the study,

09:44.160 --> 09:44.720
saying,

09:44.720 --> 09:48.560
Francine D. Blough, the Cornell University economics professor

09:48.560 --> 09:49.920
who led the academic panel,

09:50.000 --> 09:52.240
insisted the findings showed American workers

09:52.240 --> 09:54.480
had little to fear from immigration.

09:54.480 --> 09:58.160
And the article also ends with a quote from the Center for American Progress,

09:58.160 --> 10:02.240
arguing that deporting immigrants would harm the economy more than it would help.

10:02.240 --> 10:05.200
And this is something that a lot of these newspaper pieces do, you know,

10:05.200 --> 10:07.200
end with a quote from an opposing viewpoint

10:07.200 --> 10:11.040
as a pretense of neutrality or bipartisanship or something.

10:11.040 --> 10:13.440
So, you know, they've still got the misleading headline in there

10:13.440 --> 10:14.400
with a clear bias,

10:14.400 --> 10:18.800
but at the very least, the text itself does quote some opposing voices.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.560
Not so for Black Pigeon, though,

10:20.560 --> 10:24.480
who doesn't mention how The Washington Times came up with the figure in the headline,

10:24.480 --> 10:27.440
or quote the head of the panel that created the paper.

10:27.440 --> 10:30.240
No doubt Black Pigeon would disagree with her conclusion

10:30.240 --> 10:32.880
that Americans have little to fear from immigration.

10:32.880 --> 10:35.280
You know, she is an academic, after all.

10:35.280 --> 10:36.640
And it's amazing, really.

10:36.640 --> 10:39.920
Black Pigeon will appeal to the authority of academics one minute,

10:39.920 --> 10:43.760
and then dismiss them as out of touch, over-educated progressives the next.

10:43.760 --> 10:46.640
And it's a tricky thing to bash ivory tower academics

10:46.640 --> 10:50.480
as having a pro-immigrant bias while simultaneously using their research

10:50.480 --> 10:52.160
to make an anti-immigrant point,

10:52.160 --> 10:54.240
but props to Black Pigeon.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.080
The madman actually did it.

10:56.080 --> 10:58.160
Anyway, that's enough of the US study for now.

10:58.160 --> 11:01.600
Let's move on to the other two, the ones from Canada and the UK.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.440
And these two actually come to conclusions

11:03.440 --> 11:06.560
that support Black Pigeon's arguments, amazingly enough.

11:06.560 --> 11:11.120
They do say immigrants cost the economy relative to the native population.

11:11.120 --> 11:12.480
But before we get to those,

11:12.480 --> 11:15.760
let's take a minute to think about the various mathematical hurdles

11:15.760 --> 11:18.560
one might face where one attempting to write a report

11:18.560 --> 11:22.080
that comes to the conclusion that immigrants are a drain on the economy.

11:22.080 --> 11:23.440
And here's the first thing.

11:23.440 --> 11:27.840
Let's consider a 20-year-old immigrant into the UK from France, say,

11:27.840 --> 11:32.160
and compare him to a 20-year-old British citizen who was born here.

11:32.160 --> 11:35.840
Now, let's imagine that from then on, they live the exact same life.

11:35.840 --> 11:38.160
They get the same jobs on the same day.

11:38.160 --> 11:40.480
They live in the same house in the same town.

11:40.480 --> 11:44.800
They work the same hours for the same wages for the same period of time.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.240
And then they die.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.560
RIP to those two imaginary people I just made up.

11:50.560 --> 11:52.320
So a question, then.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.880
Of those two people over their lifetimes,

11:54.880 --> 11:57.920
which one was more beneficial to the British economy?

11:57.920 --> 12:00.160
Now, you might think they're exactly the same.

12:00.160 --> 12:02.800
The only difference is that one of them was born in France.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.800
Everything else was identical.

12:04.800 --> 12:08.720
But that's overlooking something, and that's the British guy's childhood.

12:08.720 --> 12:11.840
For two decades, while he wasn't working because he was too young,

12:11.840 --> 12:13.840
he was supported by taxes.

12:13.840 --> 12:17.440
His education, his healthcare, welfare payments,

12:17.440 --> 12:19.600
wear and tear on infrastructure, whatever.

12:20.160 --> 12:22.320
All paid for by the taxpayer.

12:22.960 --> 12:25.520
For the first however many years of his working life,

12:25.520 --> 12:28.960
he's essentially paying back the cost of his childhood.

12:28.960 --> 12:30.880
Not so for the French guy.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.680
France paid to keep him alive for 20 years.

12:33.680 --> 12:34.720
The chumps.

12:34.720 --> 12:38.480
And then he came over here and started working and paying taxes in our country.

12:38.480 --> 12:42.800
You know, unlike the British guy, he's an immediate benefit to the economy.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.640
So that's the first hurdle there.

12:44.640 --> 12:49.280
If we consider lifetime costs when comparing immigrants to the native population,

12:49.280 --> 12:51.440
immigrants have a big head start.

12:51.440 --> 12:53.040
And here's the next hurdle.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.200
As noted in the study we just looked at,

12:55.200 --> 12:59.280
immigration can have short-term negative effects on a local level.

12:59.280 --> 13:03.120
Let's imagine a town in the UK that has exactly enough builders,

13:03.120 --> 13:06.000
say, to do all the building work required.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.080
And then a bunch of immigrants move to that town,

13:08.080 --> 13:10.320
most of whom are builders themselves.

13:10.320 --> 13:14.000
Now, that's going to have the effect of driving down wages for builders there,

13:14.000 --> 13:16.560
as well as probably reducing their hours worked.

13:16.560 --> 13:19.920
Now, the reason we say this is a short-term negative effect

13:19.920 --> 13:23.760
is because over time this situation remedies itself, you see.

13:23.760 --> 13:27.360
All of those extra immigrant builders need clothes,

13:27.360 --> 13:31.680
food, housing, entertainment, transportation, etc.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.840
And the increased demand for all of those things

13:33.840 --> 13:37.040
leads to those areas expanding and taking on more people.

13:37.040 --> 13:39.280
So for every job an immigrant takes,

13:39.280 --> 13:43.680
they create a job by way of their increasing the demand for various goods and services.

13:43.680 --> 13:45.600
So we come to the hurdle.

13:45.600 --> 13:48.000
If considered over a long enough period of time,

13:48.000 --> 13:53.360
any localized short-term negative effects of immigration average out and disappear.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.120
But as a side note here,

13:55.120 --> 13:58.720
this still sucks for the original builders who were put out of work, of course.

13:58.720 --> 14:00.800
And I'm sure it wouldn't be much solace to tell them,

14:00.800 --> 14:03.760
oh, don't worry, you know, you might be out of a job right now,

14:03.760 --> 14:06.800
but trust me, it's good for the economy in the long run.

14:07.120 --> 14:10.400
Certain people, depending on where they live and what they work as,

14:10.400 --> 14:13.680
it can have perfectly legitimate worries about immigration

14:13.680 --> 14:18.800
and these worries probably do too often get dismissed as just working-class racism.

14:18.800 --> 14:23.440
And to be fair, a lot of the time there is a lot of racism mixed in there as well

14:23.440 --> 14:28.000
and it can be hard to see past that, but there is often a real economic worry there.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.040
Now the trick is to recognize who is at fault here

14:31.040 --> 14:35.680
and blame the system and the government for lying about the effects of immigration

14:35.680 --> 14:39.440
and not having adequate protections for people who are put out of work,

14:39.440 --> 14:42.000
you know, rather than blaming the immigrants themselves,

14:42.000 --> 14:45.200
who, well, they didn't set up society this way,

14:45.200 --> 14:48.400
you know, they're just individuals trying to get by like anyone else.

14:48.400 --> 14:51.200
Anyway, now a third hurdle is this.

14:51.200 --> 14:55.520
In times of recession, the native non-immigrant population of a country

14:55.520 --> 15:00.080
also take out more than they put in, because it's a recession.

15:00.080 --> 15:03.440
So if the years you choose to measure the cost of immigration

15:03.440 --> 15:06.080
are the years immediately following a recession,

15:06.080 --> 15:10.160
you might end up with figures that say immigrants are a net loss for the economy.

15:10.160 --> 15:14.720
But that might also be true for the non-immigrant population for that time period too.

15:15.360 --> 15:18.640
But we'll talk more about this when we get to the UK report.

15:18.640 --> 15:21.840
So how would someone trying to deliberately come up with numbers

15:21.840 --> 15:26.000
that say immigration is a net loss for the economy get around all of these problems?

15:26.640 --> 15:31.440
And to be clear here, the authors of the next two reports are the Fraser Institute,

15:31.440 --> 15:34.240
which is a libertarian think tank in Canada,

15:34.240 --> 15:38.320
and Migration Watch UK, which is a right-wing pressure group in the UK.

15:39.040 --> 15:43.360
They want to come up with stats that say immigration is a drain on the economy,

15:43.360 --> 15:46.320
so they can get all those juicy tabloid headlines.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.640
So how would one go about it?

15:48.640 --> 15:52.320
Well, the main tactic is something that I like to call stat cropping,

15:52.320 --> 15:55.840
which I'm sure there's an actual term for, but I don't know it.

15:55.840 --> 16:00.880
It's the same tactic used by climate change deniers to, quote, debunk global warming.

16:00.880 --> 16:06.400
For example, if we look at this NASA graph of global surface temperature change in its entirety,

16:06.400 --> 16:09.280
the overall upwards trend is quite clear,

16:09.280 --> 16:15.680
but we can cherry-pick specific date ranges contained within it to show instead a cooling trend.

16:15.680 --> 16:18.800
So the Earth either showed no temperature change,

16:18.800 --> 16:24.080
or actually got cooler between the years of 1970 to 77,

16:24.080 --> 16:28.080
77 to 86, 87 to 96,

16:28.080 --> 16:32.640
97 to 2002, 2003 to 2012,

16:32.640 --> 16:35.520
and 2012 to 2014.

16:35.520 --> 16:39.360
Uh, big thanks to SkepticalScience.com for the graphs there.

16:39.360 --> 16:41.040
So what's my point here?

16:41.040 --> 16:46.400
Well, by examining only very specific date ranges and not looking at the whole picture,

16:46.400 --> 16:48.720
you can come up with whatever results you like,

16:48.720 --> 16:52.800
and the same holds true for examining the economic impact of migration.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.120
So with this stat cropping concept in mind,

16:55.120 --> 16:58.480
let's go to Canada and check out the Fraser Institute report.

16:59.040 --> 17:06.800
So this report is Immigration and the Canadian Welfare State 2011 by Herbert Grubel and Patrick Grady.

17:06.800 --> 17:11.280
And it's worth noting here that Black Pigeon Speaks again shows the findings of the report

17:11.280 --> 17:14.480
via a news headline, this time from the National Post.

17:14.480 --> 17:17.280
And this article starts out by saying the report was

17:17.280 --> 17:20.800
immediately criticized as telling only part of the story.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.760
And it also quotes Herbert Grubel, the report's author,

17:23.760 --> 17:24.560
as saying,

17:24.560 --> 17:28.240
"...we're not here as a country to do charity for the rest of the world."

17:28.800 --> 17:30.560
Sounds like a lovely chap.

17:30.560 --> 17:34.800
So why was this report criticized as only telling part of the story?

17:34.800 --> 17:38.240
Well, let's read a report about this report.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.240
It's Reportception.

17:41.440 --> 17:49.200
So this is Fiscal Transfers to Immigrants in Canada by Mohsen Javedani and Krishna Pendekar.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.600
I'm sorry for butchering those names there, probably.

17:52.560 --> 17:54.720
And this report starts out as follows.

17:54.720 --> 17:58.320
One of the common issues contested by analysts and policymakers

17:58.320 --> 18:03.280
is whether immigrants fully pay in terms of taxes for the public services they use.

18:03.280 --> 18:07.600
The Fraser Institute recently released a study that estimates the fiscal burden

18:07.600 --> 18:12.400
created by immigrants arriving in Canada between 1987 and 2004.

18:12.960 --> 18:17.680
The central finding in this study is that, in the fiscal year 2005-2006,

18:17.680 --> 18:22.640
immigrants on average received an excess of $6,000 in benefits over taxes paid,

18:22.640 --> 18:29.440
or as high as $23 billion per year for the nearly $4 million post-1986 immigrants to Canada.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.920
This brief report identifies some of the issues

18:31.920 --> 18:36.640
related to the internal and external validity of the study performed by Grady and Grubel.

18:36.640 --> 18:40.080
There are a number of errors and inconsistencies in their analysis,

18:40.080 --> 18:45.440
and this report presents a corrected estimate of the fiscal transfer that they sought to estimate.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.520
And let's read a few of their conclusions.

18:47.520 --> 18:50.480
Grady and Grubel present results on the fiscal transfer

18:50.480 --> 18:54.000
between all Canadian residents and recent immigrants,

18:54.000 --> 18:57.520
as defined as the difference in taxes paid between these groups,

18:57.520 --> 18:59.440
lest the difference in benefits received.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.640
They find essentially no difference in benefits received

19:02.640 --> 19:04.880
between all Canadian residents and immigrants.

19:04.880 --> 19:08.800
We also find that immigrants who arrived between 1987 and 2004

19:08.800 --> 19:13.680
received similar benefits on average to those received by all Canadian residents.

19:13.680 --> 19:16.240
Since benefits are found to be similar between groups,

19:16.240 --> 19:20.640
their results hinges on the large estimate of the difference in taxes paid,

19:20.640 --> 19:23.920
which is $6,000 and change per immigrant.

19:23.920 --> 19:28.800
However, the results presented by Grady and Grubel on taxes paid have arithmetic errors,

19:28.800 --> 19:31.040
apparently typographical in origin.

19:31.040 --> 19:37.680
Correcting these arithmetic errors results in the difference of $5,473 in taxes paid per immigrant.

19:37.680 --> 19:40.240
So, off to a good start there.

19:40.240 --> 19:43.520
Grady and Grubel investigate only recent immigrants

19:43.520 --> 19:46.560
who are younger than the immigrant population as a whole.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.280
To the extent that their youth results in lower incomes

19:49.280 --> 19:52.400
and their lower incomes result in lower tax revenues,

19:52.400 --> 19:55.840
it would be revealing to examine the entire immigrant population,

19:55.840 --> 19:58.960
so as to capture their entire life cycle of incomes.

19:58.960 --> 20:04.880
If one investigates the taxes paid by immigrants who entered Canada between 1970 and 2004,

20:04.880 --> 20:07.680
instead of between 1987 and 2004,

20:07.680 --> 20:12.320
we see a difference of $2,470 per immigrant.

20:12.320 --> 20:16.800
We also find that immigrants who entered Canada between 1970 and 2004

20:16.800 --> 20:22.800
receive an average of $345 less in benefits than do all Canadian residents.

20:22.800 --> 20:25.280
And here's why I mentioned stat-cropping earlier.

20:25.280 --> 20:27.920
The authors are only considering recent immigrants

20:27.920 --> 20:31.840
who are generally younger and poorer and therefore pay less tax.

20:31.840 --> 20:35.120
When you consider the whole immigrant population, as this report does,

20:35.120 --> 20:36.960
you get a very different number.

20:36.960 --> 20:40.400
But that isn't Grady and Grubel's only trick with the numbers there.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.880
The next one is particularly shocking.

20:42.880 --> 20:45.920
We also argue that comparing the taxes paid by immigrants

20:45.920 --> 20:49.440
to those of all Canadian residents and computing a fiscal transfer

20:49.440 --> 20:54.720
is somewhat misleading because the group of all Canadian residents includes immigrants.

20:55.280 --> 20:58.320
Therefore, it's not a transfer from one group to another.

20:58.320 --> 21:03.600
Apart from the Canadian-born residents and immigrants who entered Canada between 87 and 2004,

21:03.600 --> 21:08.560
the sample of all Canadian residents also includes non-immigrant residents,

21:08.560 --> 21:15.360
immigrants who entered Canada before 1987, and immigrants who entered Canada in 2005.

21:15.360 --> 21:18.880
These people are irrelevant to the calculation of fiscal transfer

21:18.880 --> 21:21.280
and serve only to bias the results.

21:21.280 --> 21:25.840
A more relevant comparison would be between taxes paid by Canadian-born people

21:25.840 --> 21:27.520
and those paid by immigrants.

21:27.520 --> 21:31.040
For immigrants who entered Canada between 1970 and 2004,

21:31.040 --> 21:35.280
the difference is $2,696 per immigrant.

21:35.280 --> 21:36.800
Turning to the benefit received,

21:36.800 --> 21:43.520
we find that these immigrants received an average of $554 less in benefit

21:43.520 --> 21:45.520
than did the Canadian-born.

21:45.520 --> 21:46.880
So what does all that mean?

21:46.880 --> 21:50.480
Well, Grady and Grubel aren't measuring the immigrant population

21:50.480 --> 21:52.400
against the native-born population.

21:52.400 --> 21:55.920
They're measuring the recent young immigrant population

21:55.920 --> 21:58.720
against the population of Canadian residents as a whole,

21:59.360 --> 22:02.320
which includes the older, richer immigrants.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.800
So once immigrants become sufficiently old and rich,

22:04.800 --> 22:06.880
they count as non-immigrants in this study

22:06.880 --> 22:09.680
for purposes of making the more recent immigrants

22:09.680 --> 22:12.320
look like more of an economic burden.

22:12.320 --> 22:14.400
It's highly deceptive there.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.760
And this trick worked.

22:15.760 --> 22:17.840
The National Post article starts out,

22:17.840 --> 22:23.680
immigrants to Canada impose a huge fiscal burden on Canadian taxpayers,

22:23.680 --> 22:28.960
while failing to mention that those Canadian taxpayers also include immigrants.

22:28.960 --> 22:33.440
And the report goes on, pointing out Grady and Grubel's other calculation errors

22:33.520 --> 22:35.920
and misleadingly cropped sample sizes,

22:35.920 --> 22:38.800
and comes to the conclusion that they were off in their estimation

22:38.800 --> 22:42.400
of the cost of immigration by about a factor of ten.

22:42.960 --> 22:44.960
So, well done, lads.

22:44.960 --> 22:48.960
And it's worth noting here that this report by Jav Darni and Penderker

22:48.960 --> 22:51.840
got significantly less exposure in the press

22:51.840 --> 22:55.280
than did the original report by Grady and Grubel,

22:55.280 --> 22:57.440
which, of course, was the point.

22:57.440 --> 23:00.400
Once they've got the headline, they've won, basically.

23:01.120 --> 23:06.640
So there's your second bulletproof source, Black Pigeon,

23:06.640 --> 23:08.400
the one with the mathematical errors

23:08.400 --> 23:11.840
that reclassifies richer immigrants as non-immigrants

23:11.840 --> 23:13.440
and has since been torn apart.

23:14.000 --> 23:14.500
Brilliant.

23:15.200 --> 23:19.040
Now let's go to the UK and check out the Migration Watch report,

23:19.040 --> 23:23.200
and let's play a game with this one that I'm gonna call Reverse Telephone.

23:23.200 --> 23:26.080
So this headline featured in Black Pigeon's video,

23:26.080 --> 23:31.120
Bombshell Report, Mass Immigration is Costing Britain $17 Billion Each Year,

23:31.120 --> 23:32.800
comes from the Express website,

23:32.800 --> 23:37.280
reporting on a Migration Watch UK press release about a study they wrote,

23:37.280 --> 23:43.040
The Fiscal Effects of Immigration to the UK, 2014-15, which opens,

23:43.040 --> 23:48.240
This paper extends the original research by Christian Dustmann and Tommaso Frattini,

23:48.880 --> 23:51.120
Dustmann and Frattini, 2014,

23:51.120 --> 23:53.520
on the fiscal impact of immigration to the UK

23:53.520 --> 23:57.200
in individual years from 1995 to 2011,

23:57.200 --> 24:01.200
by applying the same methodological principles to the most recent year

24:01.200 --> 24:06.000
for which equivalent data is available, fiscal 2014-15.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.040
So this paper is an extension of the 2014 paper,

24:09.040 --> 24:11.360
The Fiscal Effects of Immigration to the UK,

24:11.360 --> 24:12.880
authored by Dustmann and Frattini,

24:12.880 --> 24:16.800
and put out by UCL's Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration.

24:17.440 --> 24:19.360
Right, do you have all that?

24:19.360 --> 24:19.860
Okay.

24:20.240 --> 24:22.640
So let's first take a look at the original report,

24:22.720 --> 24:24.640
and then we'll work backwards from there.

24:24.640 --> 24:26.720
And the organisation that released the report,

24:27.440 --> 24:30.880
reported on the release of the report in the following way.

24:30.880 --> 24:32.400
That was an awkward sentence, wasn't it?

24:32.960 --> 24:37.360
European immigrants to the UK have paid more in taxes than they received in benefits,

24:37.360 --> 24:40.240
helping to relieve the fiscal burden on UK-born workers,

24:40.240 --> 24:43.120
and contributing to the financing of public services,

24:43.120 --> 24:49.360
according to new research by the UCL Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration, CREAM.

24:49.360 --> 24:52.800
European immigrants who arrived in the UK since the year 2000

24:52.800 --> 24:59.280
have contributed more than £20 billion to the UK public finances between 2001 and 2011.

24:59.280 --> 25:02.720
Moreover, they have endowed the country with productive human capital

25:02.720 --> 25:07.440
that would have cost the UK £6.8 billion in spending on education.

25:07.440 --> 25:11.120
Hey, that's the point I made earlier about the cost of education.

25:11.120 --> 25:12.000
Isn't that neat?

25:12.000 --> 25:12.500
Anyway.

25:12.960 --> 25:17.600
This report also contains several graphs that measure immigrants' impact on the economy

25:17.600 --> 25:23.120
relative to natives, and you can see the big drop around 2008 there due to the financial crisis,

25:23.120 --> 25:27.200
and indeed, the native population is contributing less than they receive.

25:27.200 --> 25:30.320
So we have a University College London report there

25:30.320 --> 25:34.880
that came to the conclusion that immigration is a net positive for the economy.

25:35.520 --> 25:40.320
Now, the report in Black Pigeon's video put out by Migration Watch UK

25:40.320 --> 25:44.320
claims to be an extension of Dusman and Frattini 2014

25:44.320 --> 25:47.520
that applies their methodology to a more recent year,

25:47.680 --> 25:50.080
but somehow comes to the opposite result,

25:50.080 --> 25:52.640
that migrants are a drain on the economy.

25:52.640 --> 25:54.560
So how did they manage that?

25:54.560 --> 25:57.120
Well, quoting from their abstract, they say,

25:57.680 --> 26:02.960
"...some slight differences in assumptions have been made in the interests of greater accuracy."

26:03.760 --> 26:04.260
Hmm.

26:04.720 --> 26:08.080
So what were these slight differences, you might be wondering?

26:08.080 --> 26:12.560
Well, we can read the Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration's response

26:12.560 --> 26:16.400
to the Migration Watch report and see exactly what they think of it.

26:16.400 --> 26:21.280
Migration Watch has extended our analysis of the fiscal impact of immigration to the UK

26:21.280 --> 26:27.040
to fiscal year 2014, a year for which the data were not available when we wrote our paper.

26:27.040 --> 26:31.040
However, while they claim to replicate our analysis in most points,

26:31.040 --> 26:33.280
they only consider that specific year,

26:33.280 --> 26:37.280
rather than computing the cumulative fiscal contributions of all immigrants

26:37.280 --> 26:40.320
who arrived since the year 2000, as we did.

26:40.320 --> 26:44.400
What Migration Watch did was just choose one year only, 2014.

26:44.400 --> 26:50.480
This tells us the rate at which the cumulative contribution of immigrants is growing in 2014 only.

26:50.480 --> 26:54.160
This is certainly a less interesting question than the one we posed.

26:54.160 --> 26:58.720
For that particular year, they show that EEA immigrants who arrived since the year 2000

26:58.720 --> 27:01.600
make a roughly neutral net contribution.

27:01.600 --> 27:07.280
It would remain true that the cumulative contribution over the last 15 years must be positive.

27:07.280 --> 27:11.680
It should also be noted that the net fiscal contribution of EEA immigrants,

27:11.680 --> 27:15.280
even for that one year, is still higher than that of natives.

27:15.280 --> 27:18.160
In fact, Migration Watch estimates that in 2014,

27:18.160 --> 27:22.400
natives contribute to the exchequer about 85% of what they cost,

27:22.400 --> 27:26.080
thus making a substantial negative fiscal contribution.

27:26.080 --> 27:28.400
A couple of additional points are worth noting.

27:28.400 --> 27:31.120
The central scenario analyzed by Migration Watch

27:31.120 --> 27:36.400
is one where recent immigrants are assumed to make no contribution to corporate taxes.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.160
However, as we discussed in our study,

27:38.160 --> 27:43.280
the allocation of corporate taxes and business rates raises complicated questions of incidence.

27:43.280 --> 27:45.040
The fact that businesses write the cheques

27:45.040 --> 27:49.200
does not mean that the burdens do not ultimately fall on consumers or workers.

27:49.200 --> 27:53.120
In fact, there is a literature in economics that suggests it is workers and consumers

27:53.120 --> 27:56.960
who ultimately pay the major share of such taxes, if not all.

27:56.960 --> 28:00.000
Our analysis was taking no stance on this debate,

28:00.000 --> 28:03.840
apportioning capital and corporate tax payments net of the percentage

28:03.840 --> 28:09.360
likely to be paid by foreign shareholders on a per capita basis among the adult population.

28:09.360 --> 28:11.520
When Migration Watch adopts this assumption,

28:11.520 --> 28:15.120
which we believe is more realistic and grounded in economic evidence,

28:15.120 --> 28:20.320
they find that recent EEA immigrants have made an overall fiscal contribution

28:20.320 --> 28:23.840
of £1.5 million in 2014.

28:23.840 --> 28:25.840
So, what did we just learn there?

28:25.840 --> 28:29.680
Well, firstly, Migration Watch aped the methodology of a study

28:29.680 --> 28:32.160
that was designed to measure the impact of immigration

28:32.160 --> 28:34.560
over the decade since the year 2000,

28:34.560 --> 28:38.160
and applied it to study just one year in particular.

28:38.160 --> 28:42.160
And this is, strictly academically speaking, very silly.

28:42.160 --> 28:48.400
Next, they worked from the assumption that immigrants do not contribute to corporation tax at all.

28:48.400 --> 28:52.240
And it turns out, when you make the assumption that immigrants don't pay taxes,

28:52.240 --> 28:54.480
it skews the numbers somewhat.

28:54.480 --> 28:59.440
Some slight differences in assumptions have been made indeed.

28:59.440 --> 29:01.840
This one is just sad, to be honest.

29:01.840 --> 29:07.360
Migration Watch UK is trying to ride the coattails of an actual legitimate academic paper

29:07.360 --> 29:11.200
by twisting its methodology and making heavily biased assumptions

29:11.200 --> 29:13.600
in order to come to the opposite conclusion.

29:14.160 --> 29:19.840
It's the old appeal to authority while rejecting that authority's conclusions game again.

29:19.840 --> 29:23.440
The Migration Watch report doesn't even have a listed author.

29:23.440 --> 29:25.280
It's embarrassing, frankly.

29:25.280 --> 29:28.480
So there's your third bulletproof source, Black Pigeon.

29:28.480 --> 29:31.200
The pressure group study without an author

29:31.200 --> 29:35.280
that makes the small assumption that immigrants don't pay any taxes.

29:35.280 --> 29:37.760
But hey, they got the headline.

29:37.760 --> 29:39.840
And that's all that counts, really, isn't it?

29:39.840 --> 29:42.080
So have you noticed the pattern here?

29:42.080 --> 29:46.000
The studies released by government or university academic researchers

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
come to the conclusion that migration is generally positive for the economy.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.760
Studies released by right-wing think tanks and pressure groups, on the other hand,

29:53.760 --> 29:57.520
come to the conclusion that migration is negative for the economy,

29:57.520 --> 30:00.880
but only by deliberately selecting certain date ranges

30:00.880 --> 30:05.440
and particular immigrant demographics that allow them to come to that conclusion.

30:05.440 --> 30:08.560
And I'd like to ask, can we not reverse the logic

30:08.560 --> 30:11.520
of Black Pigeon Speaks' introduction to his video?

30:11.520 --> 30:15.840
He says these bulletproof sources prove pro-immigration arguments wrong,

30:15.840 --> 30:20.480
but far from being bulletproof, these sources are actually riddled with bullet holes.

30:20.480 --> 30:22.560
You know, they're rubbish.

30:22.560 --> 30:26.320
So can we therefore conclude that the pro-immigration arguments check out?

30:28.080 --> 30:30.560
Yes. Yes, we can.

30:30.560 --> 30:32.400
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

30:32.400 --> 30:35.200
This video wasn't about ancient Rome.

30:35.200 --> 30:38.320
I'm sorry, I promised my next video was gonna be about Rome.

30:38.880 --> 30:43.440
But that one was taken a while, you see, so what I did was I made this one instead.

30:44.240 --> 30:46.640
Expect the Rome video in the next few weeks, probably.

30:47.200 --> 30:50.800
Thanks, as always, to all my supporters over on Patreon.

30:50.800 --> 30:53.360
I couldn't keep making these videos without your support,

30:53.360 --> 30:57.280
and I am incredibly grateful and genuinely thank you all.

30:57.760 --> 31:01.360
And for anyone else, if you'd like to help support more videos like this,

31:01.360 --> 31:03.760
head over to Patreon and send me a dollar or two.

31:03.760 --> 31:05.760
The link will be in the description there.

31:05.760 --> 31:09.120
Also follow me on Twitter and all that jazz, if you like.

31:09.760 --> 31:12.320
Right, thanks a lot, everyone. See you next time.
