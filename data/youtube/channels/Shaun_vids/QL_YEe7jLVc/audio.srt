00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
Hello everyone. Today we're going to be talking about statistics and studies.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,160
And doesn't that sound fun?

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,360
And specifically, I'd like to have a bit of a think about how traditional news media reports on studies,

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,760
as well as what you see here on YouTube.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,600
And our lab rat who's going to be helping us out today is YouTuber BlackPigeonSpeaks, and why him?

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:27,200
Well, in my opinion, BlackPigeonSpeaks is consistently among the most shameless in his misuse of sources and statistics.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,120
And the video I'm going to feature here,

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,000
Something is Rotten in the State Denmark, is particularly bad for it.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,520
So then, this video.

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,840
Well, first of all, I'd like to apologize to Denmark on behalf of my fellow countrymen, William Shakespeare,

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,040
for how often I imagine they have to hear that sentence.

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,640
It must be terrifically annoying.

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,760
I imagine scarcely anything can happen in Denmark without some chump quoting that line.

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,640
But anyway, what is this video about?

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,040
Well, it doesn't really matter, to be honest.

16
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,960
It's just another in BlackPigeonSpeaks' long line of anti-immigrant videos,

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,200
where he explains how if you let a single non-white person into your country, it turns into Mordor or something.

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,240
Today's country is Denmark, but he's made similar videos proclaiming the imminent downfall of Sweden,

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,200
the UK, Germany, the United States, etc.

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,560
You know, the same old rubbish.

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,280
What I am interested in in this video are the statistics and sources that BlackPigeon cites at the start of the video.

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,880
And let's take a look at that.

23
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,520
But are they true?

24
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,320
There are many examples of studies that refute not only these common assertions,

25
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,080
but in fact demonstrate that not only does mass immigration not help destination countries,

26
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,080
but in fact becomes a major financial burden for the native tax-paying population.

27
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,440
In Canada, for example, a recent long-term study has shown that

28
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,080
immigrants impose a huge fiscal burden on Canadian taxpayers.

29
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,720
This is the result of immigrants paying about half as much in income tax as other Canadians,

30
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,760
but absorbing nearly the same value of government services,

31
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,000
costing taxpayers roughly $6,051 per immigrant,

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:43,040
and amounting to a total annual cost of somewhere between $16.3 billion and $23.6 billion dollars.

33
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,360
These findings are also mirrored in the US,

34
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,480
where an authoritative study by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine

35
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:59,040
found that immigration drains the government, sapping as much as $296 billion dollars a year

36
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,840
from the federal, state, and local taxpayers, while depressing wages, at least in the short run.

37
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,000
The data shows that immigrants take more in benefits than they pay in taxes.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Although immigrants do boost the size of the economy, the gains are heavily skewed

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,680
toward the immigrants themselves and to wealthy investors,

40
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,400
not to native-born workers who end up competing with the new arrivals.

41
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,520
The same can be said in the UK, where a recent report concluded that

42
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,840
migrants contributed much less in taxes than they used in government services,

43
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,800
and like in Canada and the US, immigrants on the whole are a negative drain upon the countries they enter.

44
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,240
The crippling £17 billion annual shortfall in the UK is pretty much replicated

45
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,320
in every country that is targeted with mass immigration.

46
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,160
The problem with these studies is that regardless of being non-partisan,

47
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,160
regardless of being bulletproof in terms of statistics and conclusions,

48
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:01,040
there will always be those on the left that want to continue to import new dependent voter blocks,

49
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,920
and those on the right that want to import a more malleable and cheaper workforce

50
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,560
that drives down wages, that somehow the numbers are being skewed.

51
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,200
So Black Pigeon rattles off a few pro-immigrant arguments and then says they're invalid

52
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,640
because they're refuted by the stats, and he cites three studies

53
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,240
which are supposedly non-partisan and statistically bulletproof.

54
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,040
Those studies being, in America, the Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration

55
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,800
by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine,

56
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,560
in Canada, Immigration and the Canadian Welfare State 2011 by the Fraser Institute,

57
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,520
and in the UK, the Fiscal Effects of Immigration to the UK 2014-15

58
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,880
by the very non-partisan Migration Watch UK.

59
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,320
Hmm.

60
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,600
So let's take a look at these three papers and test out just how statistically bulletproof they are,

61
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,640
and we'll do the most fun one first, which is the American one, because why not?

62
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,760
Now I like this one the most because in his introduction there,

63
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,520
Black Pigeon railed against the supposed pro-immigrant narrative

64
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,640
of Western governments' academia and, quote,

65
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:12,240
But then to counter that narrative, he cites a Washington Times article

66
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,800
talking about an academic research paper put out by the National Academies.

67
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,800
So if the press, governments and academics want to push a pro-immigrant message,

68
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,360
they seemingly shot themselves in the foot this time.

69
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,760
Or have they?

70
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,760
You see, the other fun thing here is that Black Pigeon shows the results of this study

71
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,600
via a stupid headline on a biased conservative news website.

72
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,200
Now, we're not gonna do that.

73
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,000
We're gonna cut out the middleman and go right to the source

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,240
and read the press release that the authors of the report put out alongside it.

75
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,280
And I'm gonna read the whole summary of this report's conclusions here,

76
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,760
just so you can be sure I'm not missing anything out.

77
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,400
...who are often the closest substitutes for immigrant workers with low skills.

78
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,200
There is little evidence that immigration significantly affects

79
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,000
the overall employment levels of native-born workers.

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,040
As with wage impacts, there is some evidence that recent immigrants

81
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,280
reduce the employment rate of prior immigrants.

82
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,280
In addition, recent research finds that immigration reduces the numbers of hours

83
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,560
worked by native teens, but not their employment levels.

84
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,160
Some evidence on inflow of skilled immigrants suggests that there may be

85
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,280
positive wage effects for some subgroups of native-born workers,

86
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,000
and other benefits to the economy more broadly.

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,440
Immigration has an overall positive impact on long-run economic growth in the US.

88
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,760
In terms of fiscal impacts, first-generation immigrants are more costly to governments,

89
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,720
mainly at the state and local levels, than are the native-born,

90
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,840
in large part due to the costs of educating their children.

91
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,760
However, as adults, the children of immigrants, the second generation,

92
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,600
are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the US population,

93
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,480
contributing more in taxes than either their parents,

94
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,120
or the rest of the native-born population.

95
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,560
Over the long term, the impacts of immigrants on government budgets

96
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,480
are generally positive at the federal level,

97
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,720
but remain negative at the state and local level,

98
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,480
but these generalizations are subject to a number of important assumptions.

99
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,240
Immigration's fiscal effects vary tremendously across states.

100
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,920
I'm done.

101
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,240
So, to summarize the summary there,

102
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,680
immigration has an overall positive impact on the economy,

103
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,880
although there can be short-term negative effects on a local level,

104
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,640
depending on various factors.

105
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,400
And I'm not an expert by any means,

106
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,320
but I have had to read a few similar studies in the course of my time here on the internet,

107
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,640
and this is the result they generally all come to.

108
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,560
Well, the reputable ones anyway,

109
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,480
the ones that aren't put out by think tanks with names like Migration Watch.

110
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,680
So then, Black Pigeon, there's your first bulletproof source,

111
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,400
the one that came to the conclusion that immigration is a net positive for the economy.

112
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,880
However, you might be wondering,

113
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,280
how did the Washington Times read all this,

114
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,440
and then put out a story with the headline,

115
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:07,840
Mass Immigration Costs Government $296 Billion a Year Depresses Wages?

116
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,880
You know, why not?

117
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,320
New study finds immigrants have positive impact on economy.

118
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,120
Well, that's because they're very, very sneaky.

119
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,160
You see, at one point,

120
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,920
the paper in question examines the spread of eight alternate scenarios

121
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,040
for measuring the fiscal impact of immigration in 2013,

122
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,800
and controlling for various factors, they get eight different results.

123
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,120
And I'm gonna read you something right now from that section.

124
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,920
That probably isn't gonna make much sense, but here we go.

125
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,080
Most, but not all, of the increase in the fiscal ratio for the first generation group

126
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,880
is linked to the change in the public goods assumption

127
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,160
that results in vastly reduced federal spending on this group,

128
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:46,080
from an estimate of $9,000 per individual in Scenario 1,

129
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,120
down to $6,000 in Scenario 5,

130
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,800
a reduction that raises the ratio of receipts to outlays from 0.7 to 1.1.

131
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,720
Now, to translate,

132
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,200
depending on how you measure the impact of immigration,

133
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,960
you can wind up with different results,

134
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,640
and in the best case scenarios,

135
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,000
immigrants pay more to the federal government than they receive back,

136
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,960
and in the worst case scenarios, the opposite is true.

137
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,240
So, a question.

138
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,920
Where do you imagine The Washington Times got this figure from?

139
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,120
Was it from the worst possible projected scenario?

140
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,440
Yes, it was.

141
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,560
Of course it was.

142
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,000
So, the study came up with a range of eight different possibilities,

143
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,640
and The Washington Times cherry-picked the worst one,

144
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,480
and then wrote a headline that made it look like

145
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,120
that was the overall result of the study.

146
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,800
Highly sneaky behavior there.

147
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,920
However, as awful as it is,

148
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,320
The Washington Times at least divulges

149
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,800
that this is how it came up with the figure in the headline,

150
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,160
and also quotes the leader of the panel that wrote the study,

151
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,720
saying,

152
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,560
Francine D. Blough, the Cornell University economics professor

153
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,920
who led the academic panel,

154
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,240
insisted the findings showed American workers

155
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,480
had little to fear from immigration.

156
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,160
And the article also ends with a quote from the Center for American Progress,

157
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,240
arguing that deporting immigrants would harm the economy more than it would help.

158
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,200
And this is something that a lot of these newspaper pieces do, you know,

159
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
end with a quote from an opposing viewpoint

160
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,040
as a pretense of neutrality or bipartisanship or something.

161
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,440
So, you know, they've still got the misleading headline in there

162
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,400
with a clear bias,

163
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,800
but at the very least, the text itself does quote some opposing voices.

164
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,560
Not so for Black Pigeon, though,

165
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,480
who doesn't mention how The Washington Times came up with the figure in the headline,

166
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,440
or quote the head of the panel that created the paper.

167
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,240
No doubt Black Pigeon would disagree with her conclusion

168
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,880
that Americans have little to fear from immigration.

169
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,280
You know, she is an academic, after all.

170
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,640
And it's amazing, really.

171
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,920
Black Pigeon will appeal to the authority of academics one minute,

172
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,760
and then dismiss them as out of touch, over-educated progressives the next.

173
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,640
And it's a tricky thing to bash ivory tower academics

174
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,480
as having a pro-immigrant bias while simultaneously using their research

175
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,160
to make an anti-immigrant point,

176
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,240
but props to Black Pigeon.

177
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,080
The madman actually did it.

178
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,160
Anyway, that's enough of the US study for now.

179
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,600
Let's move on to the other two, the ones from Canada and the UK.

180
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,440
And these two actually come to conclusions

181
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,560
that support Black Pigeon's arguments, amazingly enough.

182
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,120
They do say immigrants cost the economy relative to the native population.

183
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,480
But before we get to those,

184
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,760
let's take a minute to think about the various mathematical hurdles

185
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,560
one might face where one attempting to write a report

186
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,080
that comes to the conclusion that immigrants are a drain on the economy.

187
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,440
And here's the first thing.

188
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,840
Let's consider a 20-year-old immigrant into the UK from France, say,

189
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,160
and compare him to a 20-year-old British citizen who was born here.

190
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,840
Now, let's imagine that from then on, they live the exact same life.

191
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,160
They get the same jobs on the same day.

192
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,480
They live in the same house in the same town.

193
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,800
They work the same hours for the same wages for the same period of time.

194
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,240
And then they die.

195
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,560
RIP to those two imaginary people I just made up.

196
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,320
So a question, then.

197
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,880
Of those two people over their lifetimes,

198
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,920
which one was more beneficial to the British economy?

199
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,160
Now, you might think they're exactly the same.

200
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,800
The only difference is that one of them was born in France.

201
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Everything else was identical.

202
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,720
But that's overlooking something, and that's the British guy's childhood.

203
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,840
For two decades, while he wasn't working because he was too young,

204
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,840
he was supported by taxes.

205
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,440
His education, his healthcare, welfare payments,

206
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,600
wear and tear on infrastructure, whatever.

207
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,320
All paid for by the taxpayer.

208
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,520
For the first however many years of his working life,

209
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,960
he's essentially paying back the cost of his childhood.

210
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,880
Not so for the French guy.

211
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,680
France paid to keep him alive for 20 years.

212
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,720
The chumps.

213
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,480
And then he came over here and started working and paying taxes in our country.

214
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,800
You know, unlike the British guy, he's an immediate benefit to the economy.

215
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,640
So that's the first hurdle there.

216
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,280
If we consider lifetime costs when comparing immigrants to the native population,

217
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,440
immigrants have a big head start.

218
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,040
And here's the next hurdle.

219
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,200
As noted in the study we just looked at,

220
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,280
immigration can have short-term negative effects on a local level.

221
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,120
Let's imagine a town in the UK that has exactly enough builders,

222
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,000
say, to do all the building work required.

223
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,080
And then a bunch of immigrants move to that town,

224
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,320
most of whom are builders themselves.

225
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,000
Now, that's going to have the effect of driving down wages for builders there,

226
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,560
as well as probably reducing their hours worked.

227
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,920
Now, the reason we say this is a short-term negative effect

228
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,760
is because over time this situation remedies itself, you see.

229
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,360
All of those extra immigrant builders need clothes,

230
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,680
food, housing, entertainment, transportation, etc.

231
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,840
And the increased demand for all of those things

232
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,040
leads to those areas expanding and taking on more people.

233
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,280
So for every job an immigrant takes,

234
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,680
they create a job by way of their increasing the demand for various goods and services.

235
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,600
So we come to the hurdle.

236
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,000
If considered over a long enough period of time,

237
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,360
any localized short-term negative effects of immigration average out and disappear.

238
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,120
But as a side note here,

239
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,720
this still sucks for the original builders who were put out of work, of course.

240
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,800
And I'm sure it wouldn't be much solace to tell them,

241
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,760
oh, don't worry, you know, you might be out of a job right now,

242
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,800
but trust me, it's good for the economy in the long run.

243
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,400
Certain people, depending on where they live and what they work as,

244
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,680
it can have perfectly legitimate worries about immigration

245
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,800
and these worries probably do too often get dismissed as just working-class racism.

246
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,440
And to be fair, a lot of the time there is a lot of racism mixed in there as well

247
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,000
and it can be hard to see past that, but there is often a real economic worry there.

248
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,040
Now the trick is to recognize who is at fault here

249
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,680
and blame the system and the government for lying about the effects of immigration

250
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,440
and not having adequate protections for people who are put out of work,

251
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,000
you know, rather than blaming the immigrants themselves,

252
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,200
who, well, they didn't set up society this way,

253
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,400
you know, they're just individuals trying to get by like anyone else.

254
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,200
Anyway, now a third hurdle is this.

255
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,520
In times of recession, the native non-immigrant population of a country

256
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,080
also take out more than they put in, because it's a recession.

257
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,440
So if the years you choose to measure the cost of immigration

258
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,080
are the years immediately following a recession,

259
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,160
you might end up with figures that say immigrants are a net loss for the economy.

260
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,720
But that might also be true for the non-immigrant population for that time period too.

261
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,640
But we'll talk more about this when we get to the UK report.

262
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,840
So how would someone trying to deliberately come up with numbers

263
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:26,000
that say immigration is a net loss for the economy get around all of these problems?

264
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:31,440
And to be clear here, the authors of the next two reports are the Fraser Institute,

265
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,240
which is a libertarian think tank in Canada,

266
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,320
and Migration Watch UK, which is a right-wing pressure group in the UK.

267
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,360
They want to come up with stats that say immigration is a drain on the economy,

268
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,320
so they can get all those juicy tabloid headlines.

269
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,640
So how would one go about it?

270
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,320
Well, the main tactic is something that I like to call stat cropping,

271
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,840
which I'm sure there's an actual term for, but I don't know it.

272
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,880
It's the same tactic used by climate change deniers to, quote, debunk global warming.

273
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,400
For example, if we look at this NASA graph of global surface temperature change in its entirety,

274
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,280
the overall upwards trend is quite clear,

275
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:15,680
but we can cherry-pick specific date ranges contained within it to show instead a cooling trend.

276
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,800
So the Earth either showed no temperature change,

277
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,080
or actually got cooler between the years of 1970 to 77,

278
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,080
77 to 86, 87 to 96,

279
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,640
97 to 2002, 2003 to 2012,

280
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,520
and 2012 to 2014.

281
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,360
Uh, big thanks to SkepticalScience.com for the graphs there.

282
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,040
So what's my point here?

283
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,400
Well, by examining only very specific date ranges and not looking at the whole picture,

284
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,720
you can come up with whatever results you like,

285
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,800
and the same holds true for examining the economic impact of migration.

286
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,120
So with this stat cropping concept in mind,

287
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,480
let's go to Canada and check out the Fraser Institute report.

288
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:06,800
So this report is Immigration and the Canadian Welfare State 2011 by Herbert Grubel and Patrick Grady.

289
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,280
And it's worth noting here that Black Pigeon Speaks again shows the findings of the report

290
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,480
via a news headline, this time from the National Post.

291
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,280
And this article starts out by saying the report was

292
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,800
immediately criticized as telling only part of the story.

293
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,760
And it also quotes Herbert Grubel, the report's author,

294
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,560
as saying,

295
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,240
"...we're not here as a country to do charity for the rest of the world."

296
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,560
Sounds like a lovely chap.

297
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,800
So why was this report criticized as only telling part of the story?

298
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,240
Well, let's read a report about this report.

299
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,240
It's Reportception.

300
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:49,200
So this is Fiscal Transfers to Immigrants in Canada by Mohsen Javedani and Krishna Pendekar.

301
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,600
I'm sorry for butchering those names there, probably.

302
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,720
And this report starts out as follows.

303
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,320
One of the common issues contested by analysts and policymakers

304
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,280
is whether immigrants fully pay in terms of taxes for the public services they use.

305
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,600
The Fraser Institute recently released a study that estimates the fiscal burden

306
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,400
created by immigrants arriving in Canada between 1987 and 2004.

307
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,680
The central finding in this study is that, in the fiscal year 2005-2006,

308
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:22,640
immigrants on average received an excess of $6,000 in benefits over taxes paid,

309
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:29,440
or as high as $23 billion per year for the nearly $4 million post-1986 immigrants to Canada.

310
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,920
This brief report identifies some of the issues

311
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,640
related to the internal and external validity of the study performed by Grady and Grubel.

312
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,080
There are a number of errors and inconsistencies in their analysis,

313
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,440
and this report presents a corrected estimate of the fiscal transfer that they sought to estimate.

314
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,520
And let's read a few of their conclusions.

315
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,480
Grady and Grubel present results on the fiscal transfer

316
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,000
between all Canadian residents and recent immigrants,

317
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,520
as defined as the difference in taxes paid between these groups,

318
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,440
lest the difference in benefits received.

319
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,640
They find essentially no difference in benefits received

320
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,880
between all Canadian residents and immigrants.

321
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,800
We also find that immigrants who arrived between 1987 and 2004

322
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,680
received similar benefits on average to those received by all Canadian residents.

323
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,240
Since benefits are found to be similar between groups,

324
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,640
their results hinges on the large estimate of the difference in taxes paid,

325
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,920
which is $6,000 and change per immigrant.

326
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,800
However, the results presented by Grady and Grubel on taxes paid have arithmetic errors,

327
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,040
apparently typographical in origin.

328
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:37,680
Correcting these arithmetic errors results in the difference of $5,473 in taxes paid per immigrant.

329
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,240
So, off to a good start there.

330
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,520
Grady and Grubel investigate only recent immigrants

331
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,560
who are younger than the immigrant population as a whole.

332
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,280
To the extent that their youth results in lower incomes

333
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,400
and their lower incomes result in lower tax revenues,

334
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,840
it would be revealing to examine the entire immigrant population,

335
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,960
so as to capture their entire life cycle of incomes.

336
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,880
If one investigates the taxes paid by immigrants who entered Canada between 1970 and 2004,

337
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,680
instead of between 1987 and 2004,

338
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,320
we see a difference of $2,470 per immigrant.

339
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,800
We also find that immigrants who entered Canada between 1970 and 2004

340
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:22,800
receive an average of $345 less in benefits than do all Canadian residents.

341
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,280
And here's why I mentioned stat-cropping earlier.

342
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,920
The authors are only considering recent immigrants

343
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,840
who are generally younger and poorer and therefore pay less tax.

344
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,120
When you consider the whole immigrant population, as this report does,

345
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,960
you get a very different number.

346
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,400
But that isn't Grady and Grubel's only trick with the numbers there.

347
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,880
The next one is particularly shocking.

348
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,920
We also argue that comparing the taxes paid by immigrants

349
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,440
to those of all Canadian residents and computing a fiscal transfer

350
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,720
is somewhat misleading because the group of all Canadian residents includes immigrants.

351
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,320
Therefore, it's not a transfer from one group to another.

352
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,600
Apart from the Canadian-born residents and immigrants who entered Canada between 87 and 2004,

353
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,560
the sample of all Canadian residents also includes non-immigrant residents,

354
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:15,360
immigrants who entered Canada before 1987, and immigrants who entered Canada in 2005.

355
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,880
These people are irrelevant to the calculation of fiscal transfer

356
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,280
and serve only to bias the results.

357
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,840
A more relevant comparison would be between taxes paid by Canadian-born people

358
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,520
and those paid by immigrants.

359
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,040
For immigrants who entered Canada between 1970 and 2004,

360
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,280
the difference is $2,696 per immigrant.

361
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,800
Turning to the benefit received,

362
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:43,520
we find that these immigrants received an average of $554 less in benefit

363
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,520
than did the Canadian-born.

364
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,880
So what does all that mean?

365
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,480
Well, Grady and Grubel aren't measuring the immigrant population

366
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,400
against the native-born population.

367
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,920
They're measuring the recent young immigrant population

368
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,720
against the population of Canadian residents as a whole,

369
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,320
which includes the older, richer immigrants.

370
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,800
So once immigrants become sufficiently old and rich,

371
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,880
they count as non-immigrants in this study

372
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,680
for purposes of making the more recent immigrants

373
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,320
look like more of an economic burden.

374
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,400
It's highly deceptive there.

375
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,760
And this trick worked.

376
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,840
The National Post article starts out,

377
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,680
immigrants to Canada impose a huge fiscal burden on Canadian taxpayers,

378
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,960
while failing to mention that those Canadian taxpayers also include immigrants.

379
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,440
And the report goes on, pointing out Grady and Grubel's other calculation errors

380
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,920
and misleadingly cropped sample sizes,

381
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,800
and comes to the conclusion that they were off in their estimation

382
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,400
of the cost of immigration by about a factor of ten.

383
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,960
So, well done, lads.

384
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,960
And it's worth noting here that this report by Jav Darni and Penderker

385
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,840
got significantly less exposure in the press

386
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,280
than did the original report by Grady and Grubel,

387
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,440
which, of course, was the point.

388
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,400
Once they've got the headline, they've won, basically.

389
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,640
So there's your second bulletproof source, Black Pigeon,

390
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,400
the one with the mathematical errors

391
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,840
that reclassifies richer immigrants as non-immigrants

392
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,440
and has since been torn apart.

393
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,500
Brilliant.

394
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,040
Now let's go to the UK and check out the Migration Watch report,

395
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,200
and let's play a game with this one that I'm gonna call Reverse Telephone.

396
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,080
So this headline featured in Black Pigeon's video,

397
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,120
Bombshell Report, Mass Immigration is Costing Britain $17 Billion Each Year,

398
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,800
comes from the Express website,

399
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,280
reporting on a Migration Watch UK press release about a study they wrote,

400
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:43,040
The Fiscal Effects of Immigration to the UK, 2014-15, which opens,

401
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:48,240
This paper extends the original research by Christian Dustmann and Tommaso Frattini,

402
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,120
Dustmann and Frattini, 2014,

403
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,520
on the fiscal impact of immigration to the UK

404
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,200
in individual years from 1995 to 2011,

405
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,200
by applying the same methodological principles to the most recent year

406
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,000
for which equivalent data is available, fiscal 2014-15.

407
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,040
So this paper is an extension of the 2014 paper,

408
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,360
The Fiscal Effects of Immigration to the UK,

409
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,880
authored by Dustmann and Frattini,

410
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,800
and put out by UCL's Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration.

411
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,360
Right, do you have all that?

412
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:19,860
Okay.

413
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,640
So let's first take a look at the original report,

414
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,640
and then we'll work backwards from there.

415
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,720
And the organisation that released the report,

416
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,880
reported on the release of the report in the following way.

417
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,400
That was an awkward sentence, wasn't it?

418
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,360
European immigrants to the UK have paid more in taxes than they received in benefits,

419
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,240
helping to relieve the fiscal burden on UK-born workers,

420
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,120
and contributing to the financing of public services,

421
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:49,360
according to new research by the UCL Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration, CREAM.

422
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,800
European immigrants who arrived in the UK since the year 2000

423
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:59,280
have contributed more than £20 billion to the UK public finances between 2001 and 2011.

424
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,720
Moreover, they have endowed the country with productive human capital

425
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,440
that would have cost the UK £6.8 billion in spending on education.

426
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,120
Hey, that's the point I made earlier about the cost of education.

427
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,000
Isn't that neat?

428
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,500
Anyway.

429
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,600
This report also contains several graphs that measure immigrants' impact on the economy

430
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:23,120
relative to natives, and you can see the big drop around 2008 there due to the financial crisis,

431
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,200
and indeed, the native population is contributing less than they receive.

432
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,320
So we have a University College London report there

433
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,880
that came to the conclusion that immigration is a net positive for the economy.

434
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,320
Now, the report in Black Pigeon's video put out by Migration Watch UK

435
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,320
claims to be an extension of Dusman and Frattini 2014

436
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,520
that applies their methodology to a more recent year,

437
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,080
but somehow comes to the opposite result,

438
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,640
that migrants are a drain on the economy.

439
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,560
So how did they manage that?

440
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,120
Well, quoting from their abstract, they say,

441
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,960
"...some slight differences in assumptions have been made in the interests of greater accuracy."

442
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,260
Hmm.

443
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,080
So what were these slight differences, you might be wondering?

444
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,560
Well, we can read the Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration's response

445
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,400
to the Migration Watch report and see exactly what they think of it.

446
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,280
Migration Watch has extended our analysis of the fiscal impact of immigration to the UK

447
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:27,040
to fiscal year 2014, a year for which the data were not available when we wrote our paper.

448
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,040
However, while they claim to replicate our analysis in most points,

449
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,280
they only consider that specific year,

450
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,280
rather than computing the cumulative fiscal contributions of all immigrants

451
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,320
who arrived since the year 2000, as we did.

452
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,400
What Migration Watch did was just choose one year only, 2014.

453
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,480
This tells us the rate at which the cumulative contribution of immigrants is growing in 2014 only.

454
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,160
This is certainly a less interesting question than the one we posed.

455
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,720
For that particular year, they show that EEA immigrants who arrived since the year 2000

456
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,600
make a roughly neutral net contribution.

457
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:07,280
It would remain true that the cumulative contribution over the last 15 years must be positive.

458
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,680
It should also be noted that the net fiscal contribution of EEA immigrants,

459
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,280
even for that one year, is still higher than that of natives.

460
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,160
In fact, Migration Watch estimates that in 2014,

461
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,400
natives contribute to the exchequer about 85% of what they cost,

462
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,080
thus making a substantial negative fiscal contribution.

463
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,400
A couple of additional points are worth noting.

464
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,120
The central scenario analyzed by Migration Watch

465
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,400
is one where recent immigrants are assumed to make no contribution to corporate taxes.

466
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,160
However, as we discussed in our study,

467
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:43,280
the allocation of corporate taxes and business rates raises complicated questions of incidence.

468
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,040
The fact that businesses write the cheques

469
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:49,200
does not mean that the burdens do not ultimately fall on consumers or workers.

470
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,120
In fact, there is a literature in economics that suggests it is workers and consumers

471
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,960
who ultimately pay the major share of such taxes, if not all.

472
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,000
Our analysis was taking no stance on this debate,

473
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,840
apportioning capital and corporate tax payments net of the percentage

474
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,360
likely to be paid by foreign shareholders on a per capita basis among the adult population.

475
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,520
When Migration Watch adopts this assumption,

476
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,120
which we believe is more realistic and grounded in economic evidence,

477
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,320
they find that recent EEA immigrants have made an overall fiscal contribution

478
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,840
of £1.5 million in 2014.

479
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,840
So, what did we just learn there?

480
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,680
Well, firstly, Migration Watch aped the methodology of a study

481
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,160
that was designed to measure the impact of immigration

482
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,560
over the decade since the year 2000,

483
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,160
and applied it to study just one year in particular.

484
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,160
And this is, strictly academically speaking, very silly.

485
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:48,400
Next, they worked from the assumption that immigrants do not contribute to corporation tax at all.

486
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,240
And it turns out, when you make the assumption that immigrants don't pay taxes,

487
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,480
it skews the numbers somewhat.

488
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,440
Some slight differences in assumptions have been made indeed.

489
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,840
This one is just sad, to be honest.

490
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:07,360
Migration Watch UK is trying to ride the coattails of an actual legitimate academic paper

491
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,200
by twisting its methodology and making heavily biased assumptions

492
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,600
in order to come to the opposite conclusion.

493
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:19,840
It's the old appeal to authority while rejecting that authority's conclusions game again.

494
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,440
The Migration Watch report doesn't even have a listed author.

495
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,280
It's embarrassing, frankly.

496
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,480
So there's your third bulletproof source, Black Pigeon.

497
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,200
The pressure group study without an author

498
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,280
that makes the small assumption that immigrants don't pay any taxes.

499
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,760
But hey, they got the headline.

500
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,840
And that's all that counts, really, isn't it?

501
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,080
So have you noticed the pattern here?

502
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,000
The studies released by government or university academic researchers

503
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
come to the conclusion that migration is generally positive for the economy.

504
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,760
Studies released by right-wing think tanks and pressure groups, on the other hand,

505
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,520
come to the conclusion that migration is negative for the economy,

506
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,880
but only by deliberately selecting certain date ranges

507
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,440
and particular immigrant demographics that allow them to come to that conclusion.

508
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,560
And I'd like to ask, can we not reverse the logic

509
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,520
of Black Pigeon Speaks' introduction to his video?

510
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,840
He says these bulletproof sources prove pro-immigration arguments wrong,

511
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,480
but far from being bulletproof, these sources are actually riddled with bullet holes.

512
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,560
You know, they're rubbish.

513
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,320
So can we therefore conclude that the pro-immigration arguments check out?

514
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,560
Yes. Yes, we can.

515
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,400
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

516
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,200
This video wasn't about ancient Rome.

517
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,320
I'm sorry, I promised my next video was gonna be about Rome.

518
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,440
But that one was taken a while, you see, so what I did was I made this one instead.

519
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,640
Expect the Rome video in the next few weeks, probably.

520
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,800
Thanks, as always, to all my supporters over on Patreon.

521
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,360
I couldn't keep making these videos without your support,

522
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,280
and I am incredibly grateful and genuinely thank you all.

523
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,360
And for anyone else, if you'd like to help support more videos like this,

524
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,760
head over to Patreon and send me a dollar or two.

525
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,760
The link will be in the description there.

526
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,120
Also follow me on Twitter and all that jazz, if you like.

527
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,320
Right, thanks a lot, everyone. See you next time.
