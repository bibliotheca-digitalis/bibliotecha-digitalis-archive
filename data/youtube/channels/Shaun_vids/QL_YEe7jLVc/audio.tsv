0	4560	Hello everyone. Today we're going to be talking about statistics and studies.
4560	6160	And doesn't that sound fun?
6160	11360	And specifically, I'd like to have a bit of a think about how traditional news media reports on studies,
11360	13760	as well as what you see here on YouTube.
13760	19600	And our lab rat who's going to be helping us out today is YouTuber BlackPigeonSpeaks, and why him?
19600	27200	Well, in my opinion, BlackPigeonSpeaks is consistently among the most shameless in his misuse of sources and statistics.
27360	29120	And the video I'm going to feature here,
29120	34000	Something is Rotten in the State Denmark, is particularly bad for it.
34000	35520	So then, this video.
35520	41840	Well, first of all, I'd like to apologize to Denmark on behalf of my fellow countrymen, William Shakespeare,
41840	45040	for how often I imagine they have to hear that sentence.
45040	46640	It must be terrifically annoying.
46640	51760	I imagine scarcely anything can happen in Denmark without some chump quoting that line.
52240	54640	But anyway, what is this video about?
54640	57040	Well, it doesn't really matter, to be honest.
57040	60960	It's just another in BlackPigeonSpeaks' long line of anti-immigrant videos,
60960	67200	where he explains how if you let a single non-white person into your country, it turns into Mordor or something.
67200	72240	Today's country is Denmark, but he's made similar videos proclaiming the imminent downfall of Sweden,
72240	75200	the UK, Germany, the United States, etc.
75200	76560	You know, the same old rubbish.
77200	83280	What I am interested in in this video are the statistics and sources that BlackPigeon cites at the start of the video.
83280	84880	And let's take a look at that.
113280	117520	But are they true?
117520	122320	There are many examples of studies that refute not only these common assertions,
122320	128080	but in fact demonstrate that not only does mass immigration not help destination countries,
128080	134080	but in fact becomes a major financial burden for the native tax-paying population.
134080	137440	In Canada, for example, a recent long-term study has shown that
137440	142080	immigrants impose a huge fiscal burden on Canadian taxpayers.
142080	146720	This is the result of immigrants paying about half as much in income tax as other Canadians,
146720	149760	but absorbing nearly the same value of government services,
149760	154000	costing taxpayers roughly $6,051 per immigrant,
154000	163040	and amounting to a total annual cost of somewhere between $16.3 billion and $23.6 billion dollars.
163040	165360	These findings are also mirrored in the US,
165360	170480	where an authoritative study by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine
170480	179040	found that immigration drains the government, sapping as much as $296 billion dollars a year
179040	185840	from the federal, state, and local taxpayers, while depressing wages, at least in the short run.
185840	190000	The data shows that immigrants take more in benefits than they pay in taxes.
190000	194000	Although immigrants do boost the size of the economy, the gains are heavily skewed
194000	197680	toward the immigrants themselves and to wealthy investors,
197680	202400	not to native-born workers who end up competing with the new arrivals.
202400	205520	The same can be said in the UK, where a recent report concluded that
205520	209840	migrants contributed much less in taxes than they used in government services,
209840	216800	and like in Canada and the US, immigrants on the whole are a negative drain upon the countries they enter.
216800	222240	The crippling £17 billion annual shortfall in the UK is pretty much replicated
222240	226320	in every country that is targeted with mass immigration.
226320	230160	The problem with these studies is that regardless of being non-partisan,
230160	234160	regardless of being bulletproof in terms of statistics and conclusions,
234160	241040	there will always be those on the left that want to continue to import new dependent voter blocks,
241040	245920	and those on the right that want to import a more malleable and cheaper workforce
245920	250560	that drives down wages, that somehow the numbers are being skewed.
250560	255200	So Black Pigeon rattles off a few pro-immigrant arguments and then says they're invalid
255200	258640	because they're refuted by the stats, and he cites three studies
258640	262240	which are supposedly non-partisan and statistically bulletproof.
262240	267040	Those studies being, in America, the Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration
267040	270800	by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine,
270800	276560	in Canada, Immigration and the Canadian Welfare State 2011 by the Fraser Institute,
276560	281520	and in the UK, the Fiscal Effects of Immigration to the UK 2014-15
281520	284880	by the very non-partisan Migration Watch UK.
285680	286320	Hmm.
286320	291600	So let's take a look at these three papers and test out just how statistically bulletproof they are,
291600	296640	and we'll do the most fun one first, which is the American one, because why not?
296640	299760	Now I like this one the most because in his introduction there,
299760	303520	Black Pigeon railed against the supposed pro-immigrant narrative
303520	306640	of Western governments' academia and, quote,
306640	312240	But then to counter that narrative, he cites a Washington Times article
312240	316800	talking about an academic research paper put out by the National Academies.
316800	320800	So if the press, governments and academics want to push a pro-immigrant message,
320800	323360	they seemingly shot themselves in the foot this time.
324240	325760	Or have they?
325760	329760	You see, the other fun thing here is that Black Pigeon shows the results of this study
329760	333600	via a stupid headline on a biased conservative news website.
333600	335200	Now, we're not gonna do that.
335200	338000	We're gonna cut out the middleman and go right to the source
338000	342240	and read the press release that the authors of the report put out alongside it.
342240	345280	And I'm gonna read the whole summary of this report's conclusions here,
345280	347760	just so you can be sure I'm not missing anything out.
363600	368400	...who are often the closest substitutes for immigrant workers with low skills.
368400	371200	There is little evidence that immigration significantly affects
371200	374000	the overall employment levels of native-born workers.
374000	377040	As with wage impacts, there is some evidence that recent immigrants
377040	379280	reduce the employment rate of prior immigrants.
379280	383280	In addition, recent research finds that immigration reduces the numbers of hours
383280	386560	worked by native teens, but not their employment levels.
386560	390160	Some evidence on inflow of skilled immigrants suggests that there may be
390160	393280	positive wage effects for some subgroups of native-born workers,
393360	396000	and other benefits to the economy more broadly.
396000	401440	Immigration has an overall positive impact on long-run economic growth in the US.
401440	405760	In terms of fiscal impacts, first-generation immigrants are more costly to governments,
405760	408720	mainly at the state and local levels, than are the native-born,
408720	411840	in large part due to the costs of educating their children.
411840	415760	However, as adults, the children of immigrants, the second generation,
415760	419600	are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the US population,
419600	422480	contributing more in taxes than either their parents,
422480	425120	or the rest of the native-born population.
425120	428560	Over the long term, the impacts of immigrants on government budgets
428560	430480	are generally positive at the federal level,
430480	432720	but remain negative at the state and local level,
432720	436480	but these generalizations are subject to a number of important assumptions.
436480	440240	Immigration's fiscal effects vary tremendously across states.
441120	441920	I'm done.
441920	444240	So, to summarize the summary there,
444240	447680	immigration has an overall positive impact on the economy,
447680	450880	although there can be short-term negative effects on a local level,
450880	452640	depending on various factors.
452640	454400	And I'm not an expert by any means,
454400	458320	but I have had to read a few similar studies in the course of my time here on the internet,
458320	460640	and this is the result they generally all come to.
460640	462560	Well, the reputable ones anyway,
462560	466480	the ones that aren't put out by think tanks with names like Migration Watch.
466480	469680	So then, Black Pigeon, there's your first bulletproof source,
469680	474400	the one that came to the conclusion that immigration is a net positive for the economy.
475280	476880	However, you might be wondering,
476880	479280	how did the Washington Times read all this,
479280	481440	and then put out a story with the headline,
481440	487840	Mass Immigration Costs Government $296 Billion a Year Depresses Wages?
487840	488880	You know, why not?
488880	492320	New study finds immigrants have positive impact on economy.
492320	495120	Well, that's because they're very, very sneaky.
495120	496160	You see, at one point,
496160	499920	the paper in question examines the spread of eight alternate scenarios
499920	503040	for measuring the fiscal impact of immigration in 2013,
503040	506800	and controlling for various factors, they get eight different results.
506960	509120	And I'm gonna read you something right now from that section.
509120	511920	That probably isn't gonna make much sense, but here we go.
511920	516080	Most, but not all, of the increase in the fiscal ratio for the first generation group
516080	518880	is linked to the change in the public goods assumption
518880	522160	that results in vastly reduced federal spending on this group,
522160	526080	from an estimate of $9,000 per individual in Scenario 1,
526080	529120	down to $6,000 in Scenario 5,
529120	534800	a reduction that raises the ratio of receipts to outlays from 0.7 to 1.1.
534800	536720	Now, to translate,
536720	539200	depending on how you measure the impact of immigration,
539200	540960	you can wind up with different results,
540960	542640	and in the best case scenarios,
542640	546000	immigrants pay more to the federal government than they receive back,
546000	548960	and in the worst case scenarios, the opposite is true.
548960	550240	So, a question.
550240	553920	Where do you imagine The Washington Times got this figure from?
553920	557120	Was it from the worst possible projected scenario?
558000	559440	Yes, it was.
559440	560560	Of course it was.
560560	564000	So, the study came up with a range of eight different possibilities,
564000	566640	and The Washington Times cherry-picked the worst one,
566640	568480	and then wrote a headline that made it look like
568480	571120	that was the overall result of the study.
571120	572800	Highly sneaky behavior there.
574000	575920	However, as awful as it is,
575920	578320	The Washington Times at least divulges
578320	580800	that this is how it came up with the figure in the headline,
580800	584160	and also quotes the leader of the panel that wrote the study,
584160	584720	saying,
584720	588560	Francine D. Blough, the Cornell University economics professor
588560	589920	who led the academic panel,
590000	592240	insisted the findings showed American workers
592240	594480	had little to fear from immigration.
594480	598160	And the article also ends with a quote from the Center for American Progress,
598160	602240	arguing that deporting immigrants would harm the economy more than it would help.
602240	605200	And this is something that a lot of these newspaper pieces do, you know,
605200	607200	end with a quote from an opposing viewpoint
607200	611040	as a pretense of neutrality or bipartisanship or something.
611040	613440	So, you know, they've still got the misleading headline in there
613440	614400	with a clear bias,
614400	618800	but at the very least, the text itself does quote some opposing voices.
618800	620560	Not so for Black Pigeon, though,
620560	624480	who doesn't mention how The Washington Times came up with the figure in the headline,
624480	627440	or quote the head of the panel that created the paper.
627440	630240	No doubt Black Pigeon would disagree with her conclusion
630240	632880	that Americans have little to fear from immigration.
632880	635280	You know, she is an academic, after all.
635280	636640	And it's amazing, really.
636640	639920	Black Pigeon will appeal to the authority of academics one minute,
639920	643760	and then dismiss them as out of touch, over-educated progressives the next.
643760	646640	And it's a tricky thing to bash ivory tower academics
646640	650480	as having a pro-immigrant bias while simultaneously using their research
650480	652160	to make an anti-immigrant point,
652160	654240	but props to Black Pigeon.
654240	656080	The madman actually did it.
656080	658160	Anyway, that's enough of the US study for now.
658160	661600	Let's move on to the other two, the ones from Canada and the UK.
661600	663440	And these two actually come to conclusions
663440	666560	that support Black Pigeon's arguments, amazingly enough.
666560	671120	They do say immigrants cost the economy relative to the native population.
671120	672480	But before we get to those,
672480	675760	let's take a minute to think about the various mathematical hurdles
675760	678560	one might face where one attempting to write a report
678560	682080	that comes to the conclusion that immigrants are a drain on the economy.
682080	683440	And here's the first thing.
683440	687840	Let's consider a 20-year-old immigrant into the UK from France, say,
687840	692160	and compare him to a 20-year-old British citizen who was born here.
692160	695840	Now, let's imagine that from then on, they live the exact same life.
695840	698160	They get the same jobs on the same day.
698160	700480	They live in the same house in the same town.
700480	704800	They work the same hours for the same wages for the same period of time.
704800	706240	And then they die.
707040	710560	RIP to those two imaginary people I just made up.
710560	712320	So a question, then.
712320	714880	Of those two people over their lifetimes,
714880	717920	which one was more beneficial to the British economy?
717920	720160	Now, you might think they're exactly the same.
720160	722800	The only difference is that one of them was born in France.
722800	724800	Everything else was identical.
724800	728720	But that's overlooking something, and that's the British guy's childhood.
728720	731840	For two decades, while he wasn't working because he was too young,
731840	733840	he was supported by taxes.
733840	737440	His education, his healthcare, welfare payments,
737440	739600	wear and tear on infrastructure, whatever.
740160	742320	All paid for by the taxpayer.
742960	745520	For the first however many years of his working life,
745520	748960	he's essentially paying back the cost of his childhood.
748960	750880	Not so for the French guy.
750880	753680	France paid to keep him alive for 20 years.
753680	754720	The chumps.
754720	758480	And then he came over here and started working and paying taxes in our country.
758480	762800	You know, unlike the British guy, he's an immediate benefit to the economy.
762800	764640	So that's the first hurdle there.
764640	769280	If we consider lifetime costs when comparing immigrants to the native population,
769280	771440	immigrants have a big head start.
771440	773040	And here's the next hurdle.
773040	775200	As noted in the study we just looked at,
775200	779280	immigration can have short-term negative effects on a local level.
779280	783120	Let's imagine a town in the UK that has exactly enough builders,
783120	786000	say, to do all the building work required.
786000	788080	And then a bunch of immigrants move to that town,
788080	790320	most of whom are builders themselves.
790320	794000	Now, that's going to have the effect of driving down wages for builders there,
794000	796560	as well as probably reducing their hours worked.
796560	799920	Now, the reason we say this is a short-term negative effect
799920	803760	is because over time this situation remedies itself, you see.
803760	807360	All of those extra immigrant builders need clothes,
807360	811680	food, housing, entertainment, transportation, etc.
811680	813840	And the increased demand for all of those things
813840	817040	leads to those areas expanding and taking on more people.
817040	819280	So for every job an immigrant takes,
819280	823680	they create a job by way of their increasing the demand for various goods and services.
823680	825600	So we come to the hurdle.
825600	828000	If considered over a long enough period of time,
828000	833360	any localized short-term negative effects of immigration average out and disappear.
833360	835120	But as a side note here,
835120	838720	this still sucks for the original builders who were put out of work, of course.
838720	840800	And I'm sure it wouldn't be much solace to tell them,
840800	843760	oh, don't worry, you know, you might be out of a job right now,
843760	846800	but trust me, it's good for the economy in the long run.
847120	850400	Certain people, depending on where they live and what they work as,
850400	853680	it can have perfectly legitimate worries about immigration
853680	858800	and these worries probably do too often get dismissed as just working-class racism.
858800	863440	And to be fair, a lot of the time there is a lot of racism mixed in there as well
863440	868000	and it can be hard to see past that, but there is often a real economic worry there.
868000	871040	Now the trick is to recognize who is at fault here
871040	875680	and blame the system and the government for lying about the effects of immigration
875680	879440	and not having adequate protections for people who are put out of work,
879440	882000	you know, rather than blaming the immigrants themselves,
882000	885200	who, well, they didn't set up society this way,
885200	888400	you know, they're just individuals trying to get by like anyone else.
888400	891200	Anyway, now a third hurdle is this.
891200	895520	In times of recession, the native non-immigrant population of a country
895520	900080	also take out more than they put in, because it's a recession.
900080	903440	So if the years you choose to measure the cost of immigration
903440	906080	are the years immediately following a recession,
906080	910160	you might end up with figures that say immigrants are a net loss for the economy.
910160	914720	But that might also be true for the non-immigrant population for that time period too.
915360	918640	But we'll talk more about this when we get to the UK report.
918640	921840	So how would someone trying to deliberately come up with numbers
921840	926000	that say immigration is a net loss for the economy get around all of these problems?
926640	931440	And to be clear here, the authors of the next two reports are the Fraser Institute,
931440	934240	which is a libertarian think tank in Canada,
934240	938320	and Migration Watch UK, which is a right-wing pressure group in the UK.
939040	943360	They want to come up with stats that say immigration is a drain on the economy,
943360	946320	so they can get all those juicy tabloid headlines.
946320	948640	So how would one go about it?
948640	952320	Well, the main tactic is something that I like to call stat cropping,
952320	955840	which I'm sure there's an actual term for, but I don't know it.
955840	960880	It's the same tactic used by climate change deniers to, quote, debunk global warming.
960880	966400	For example, if we look at this NASA graph of global surface temperature change in its entirety,
966400	969280	the overall upwards trend is quite clear,
969280	975680	but we can cherry-pick specific date ranges contained within it to show instead a cooling trend.
975680	978800	So the Earth either showed no temperature change,
978800	984080	or actually got cooler between the years of 1970 to 77,
984080	988080	77 to 86, 87 to 96,
988080	992640	97 to 2002, 2003 to 2012,
992640	995520	and 2012 to 2014.
995520	999360	Uh, big thanks to SkepticalScience.com for the graphs there.
999360	1001040	So what's my point here?
1001040	1006400	Well, by examining only very specific date ranges and not looking at the whole picture,
1006400	1008720	you can come up with whatever results you like,
1008720	1012800	and the same holds true for examining the economic impact of migration.
1012800	1015120	So with this stat cropping concept in mind,
1015120	1018480	let's go to Canada and check out the Fraser Institute report.
1019040	1026800	So this report is Immigration and the Canadian Welfare State 2011 by Herbert Grubel and Patrick Grady.
1026800	1031280	And it's worth noting here that Black Pigeon Speaks again shows the findings of the report
1031280	1034480	via a news headline, this time from the National Post.
1034480	1037280	And this article starts out by saying the report was
1037280	1040800	immediately criticized as telling only part of the story.
1040800	1043760	And it also quotes Herbert Grubel, the report's author,
1043760	1044560	as saying,
1044560	1048240	"...we're not here as a country to do charity for the rest of the world."
1048800	1050560	Sounds like a lovely chap.
1050560	1054800	So why was this report criticized as only telling part of the story?
1054800	1058240	Well, let's read a report about this report.
1058880	1060240	It's Reportception.
1061440	1069200	So this is Fiscal Transfers to Immigrants in Canada by Mohsen Javedani and Krishna Pendekar.
1069200	1071600	I'm sorry for butchering those names there, probably.
1072560	1074720	And this report starts out as follows.
1074720	1078320	One of the common issues contested by analysts and policymakers
1078320	1083280	is whether immigrants fully pay in terms of taxes for the public services they use.
1083280	1087600	The Fraser Institute recently released a study that estimates the fiscal burden
1087600	1092400	created by immigrants arriving in Canada between 1987 and 2004.
1092960	1097680	The central finding in this study is that, in the fiscal year 2005-2006,
1097680	1102640	immigrants on average received an excess of $6,000 in benefits over taxes paid,
1102640	1109440	or as high as $23 billion per year for the nearly $4 million post-1986 immigrants to Canada.
1109440	1111920	This brief report identifies some of the issues
1111920	1116640	related to the internal and external validity of the study performed by Grady and Grubel.
1116640	1120080	There are a number of errors and inconsistencies in their analysis,
1120080	1125440	and this report presents a corrected estimate of the fiscal transfer that they sought to estimate.
1125440	1127520	And let's read a few of their conclusions.
1127520	1130480	Grady and Grubel present results on the fiscal transfer
1130480	1134000	between all Canadian residents and recent immigrants,
1134000	1137520	as defined as the difference in taxes paid between these groups,
1137520	1139440	lest the difference in benefits received.
1140000	1142640	They find essentially no difference in benefits received
1142640	1144880	between all Canadian residents and immigrants.
1144880	1148800	We also find that immigrants who arrived between 1987 and 2004
1148800	1153680	received similar benefits on average to those received by all Canadian residents.
1153680	1156240	Since benefits are found to be similar between groups,
1156240	1160640	their results hinges on the large estimate of the difference in taxes paid,
1160640	1163920	which is $6,000 and change per immigrant.
1163920	1168800	However, the results presented by Grady and Grubel on taxes paid have arithmetic errors,
1168800	1171040	apparently typographical in origin.
1171040	1177680	Correcting these arithmetic errors results in the difference of $5,473 in taxes paid per immigrant.
1177680	1180240	So, off to a good start there.
1180240	1183520	Grady and Grubel investigate only recent immigrants
1183520	1186560	who are younger than the immigrant population as a whole.
1186560	1189280	To the extent that their youth results in lower incomes
1189280	1192400	and their lower incomes result in lower tax revenues,
1192400	1195840	it would be revealing to examine the entire immigrant population,
1195840	1198960	so as to capture their entire life cycle of incomes.
1198960	1204880	If one investigates the taxes paid by immigrants who entered Canada between 1970 and 2004,
1204880	1207680	instead of between 1987 and 2004,
1207680	1212320	we see a difference of $2,470 per immigrant.
1212320	1216800	We also find that immigrants who entered Canada between 1970 and 2004
1216800	1222800	receive an average of $345 less in benefits than do all Canadian residents.
1222800	1225280	And here's why I mentioned stat-cropping earlier.
1225280	1227920	The authors are only considering recent immigrants
1227920	1231840	who are generally younger and poorer and therefore pay less tax.
1231840	1235120	When you consider the whole immigrant population, as this report does,
1235120	1236960	you get a very different number.
1236960	1240400	But that isn't Grady and Grubel's only trick with the numbers there.
1240400	1242880	The next one is particularly shocking.
1242880	1245920	We also argue that comparing the taxes paid by immigrants
1245920	1249440	to those of all Canadian residents and computing a fiscal transfer
1249440	1254720	is somewhat misleading because the group of all Canadian residents includes immigrants.
1255280	1258320	Therefore, it's not a transfer from one group to another.
1258320	1263600	Apart from the Canadian-born residents and immigrants who entered Canada between 87 and 2004,
1263600	1268560	the sample of all Canadian residents also includes non-immigrant residents,
1268560	1275360	immigrants who entered Canada before 1987, and immigrants who entered Canada in 2005.
1275360	1278880	These people are irrelevant to the calculation of fiscal transfer
1278880	1281280	and serve only to bias the results.
1281280	1285840	A more relevant comparison would be between taxes paid by Canadian-born people
1285840	1287520	and those paid by immigrants.
1287520	1291040	For immigrants who entered Canada between 1970 and 2004,
1291040	1295280	the difference is $2,696 per immigrant.
1295280	1296800	Turning to the benefit received,
1296800	1303520	we find that these immigrants received an average of $554 less in benefit
1303520	1305520	than did the Canadian-born.
1305520	1306880	So what does all that mean?
1306880	1310480	Well, Grady and Grubel aren't measuring the immigrant population
1310480	1312400	against the native-born population.
1312400	1315920	They're measuring the recent young immigrant population
1315920	1318720	against the population of Canadian residents as a whole,
1319360	1322320	which includes the older, richer immigrants.
1322320	1324800	So once immigrants become sufficiently old and rich,
1324800	1326880	they count as non-immigrants in this study
1326880	1329680	for purposes of making the more recent immigrants
1329680	1332320	look like more of an economic burden.
1332320	1334400	It's highly deceptive there.
1334400	1335760	And this trick worked.
1335760	1337840	The National Post article starts out,
1337840	1343680	immigrants to Canada impose a huge fiscal burden on Canadian taxpayers,
1343680	1348960	while failing to mention that those Canadian taxpayers also include immigrants.
1348960	1353440	And the report goes on, pointing out Grady and Grubel's other calculation errors
1353520	1355920	and misleadingly cropped sample sizes,
1355920	1358800	and comes to the conclusion that they were off in their estimation
1358800	1362400	of the cost of immigration by about a factor of ten.
1362960	1364960	So, well done, lads.
1364960	1368960	And it's worth noting here that this report by Jav Darni and Penderker
1368960	1371840	got significantly less exposure in the press
1371840	1375280	than did the original report by Grady and Grubel,
1375280	1377440	which, of course, was the point.
1377440	1380400	Once they've got the headline, they've won, basically.
1381120	1386640	So there's your second bulletproof source, Black Pigeon,
1386640	1388400	the one with the mathematical errors
1388400	1391840	that reclassifies richer immigrants as non-immigrants
1391840	1393440	and has since been torn apart.
1394000	1394500	Brilliant.
1395200	1399040	Now let's go to the UK and check out the Migration Watch report,
1399040	1403200	and let's play a game with this one that I'm gonna call Reverse Telephone.
1403200	1406080	So this headline featured in Black Pigeon's video,
1406080	1411120	Bombshell Report, Mass Immigration is Costing Britain $17 Billion Each Year,
1411120	1412800	comes from the Express website,
1412800	1417280	reporting on a Migration Watch UK press release about a study they wrote,
1417280	1423040	The Fiscal Effects of Immigration to the UK, 2014-15, which opens,
1423040	1428240	This paper extends the original research by Christian Dustmann and Tommaso Frattini,
1428880	1431120	Dustmann and Frattini, 2014,
1431120	1433520	on the fiscal impact of immigration to the UK
1433520	1437200	in individual years from 1995 to 2011,
1437200	1441200	by applying the same methodological principles to the most recent year
1441200	1446000	for which equivalent data is available, fiscal 2014-15.
1446000	1449040	So this paper is an extension of the 2014 paper,
1449040	1451360	The Fiscal Effects of Immigration to the UK,
1451360	1452880	authored by Dustmann and Frattini,
1452880	1456800	and put out by UCL's Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration.
1457440	1459360	Right, do you have all that?
1459360	1459860	Okay.
1460240	1462640	So let's first take a look at the original report,
1462720	1464640	and then we'll work backwards from there.
1464640	1466720	And the organisation that released the report,
1467440	1470880	reported on the release of the report in the following way.
1470880	1472400	That was an awkward sentence, wasn't it?
1472960	1477360	European immigrants to the UK have paid more in taxes than they received in benefits,
1477360	1480240	helping to relieve the fiscal burden on UK-born workers,
1480240	1483120	and contributing to the financing of public services,
1483120	1489360	according to new research by the UCL Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration, CREAM.
1489360	1492800	European immigrants who arrived in the UK since the year 2000
1492800	1499280	have contributed more than £20 billion to the UK public finances between 2001 and 2011.
1499280	1502720	Moreover, they have endowed the country with productive human capital
1502720	1507440	that would have cost the UK £6.8 billion in spending on education.
1507440	1511120	Hey, that's the point I made earlier about the cost of education.
1511120	1512000	Isn't that neat?
1512000	1512500	Anyway.
1512960	1517600	This report also contains several graphs that measure immigrants' impact on the economy
1517600	1523120	relative to natives, and you can see the big drop around 2008 there due to the financial crisis,
1523120	1527200	and indeed, the native population is contributing less than they receive.
1527200	1530320	So we have a University College London report there
1530320	1534880	that came to the conclusion that immigration is a net positive for the economy.
1535520	1540320	Now, the report in Black Pigeon's video put out by Migration Watch UK
1540320	1544320	claims to be an extension of Dusman and Frattini 2014
1544320	1547520	that applies their methodology to a more recent year,
1547680	1550080	but somehow comes to the opposite result,
1550080	1552640	that migrants are a drain on the economy.
1552640	1554560	So how did they manage that?
1554560	1557120	Well, quoting from their abstract, they say,
1557680	1562960	"...some slight differences in assumptions have been made in the interests of greater accuracy."
1563760	1564260	Hmm.
1564720	1568080	So what were these slight differences, you might be wondering?
1568080	1572560	Well, we can read the Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration's response
1572560	1576400	to the Migration Watch report and see exactly what they think of it.
1576400	1581280	Migration Watch has extended our analysis of the fiscal impact of immigration to the UK
1581280	1587040	to fiscal year 2014, a year for which the data were not available when we wrote our paper.
1587040	1591040	However, while they claim to replicate our analysis in most points,
1591040	1593280	they only consider that specific year,
1593280	1597280	rather than computing the cumulative fiscal contributions of all immigrants
1597280	1600320	who arrived since the year 2000, as we did.
1600320	1604400	What Migration Watch did was just choose one year only, 2014.
1604400	1610480	This tells us the rate at which the cumulative contribution of immigrants is growing in 2014 only.
1610480	1614160	This is certainly a less interesting question than the one we posed.
1614160	1618720	For that particular year, they show that EEA immigrants who arrived since the year 2000
1618720	1621600	make a roughly neutral net contribution.
1621600	1627280	It would remain true that the cumulative contribution over the last 15 years must be positive.
1627280	1631680	It should also be noted that the net fiscal contribution of EEA immigrants,
1631680	1635280	even for that one year, is still higher than that of natives.
1635280	1638160	In fact, Migration Watch estimates that in 2014,
1638160	1642400	natives contribute to the exchequer about 85% of what they cost,
1642400	1646080	thus making a substantial negative fiscal contribution.
1646080	1648400	A couple of additional points are worth noting.
1648400	1651120	The central scenario analyzed by Migration Watch
1651120	1656400	is one where recent immigrants are assumed to make no contribution to corporate taxes.
1656400	1658160	However, as we discussed in our study,
1658160	1663280	the allocation of corporate taxes and business rates raises complicated questions of incidence.
1663280	1665040	The fact that businesses write the cheques
1665040	1669200	does not mean that the burdens do not ultimately fall on consumers or workers.
1669200	1673120	In fact, there is a literature in economics that suggests it is workers and consumers
1673120	1676960	who ultimately pay the major share of such taxes, if not all.
1676960	1680000	Our analysis was taking no stance on this debate,
1680000	1683840	apportioning capital and corporate tax payments net of the percentage
1683840	1689360	likely to be paid by foreign shareholders on a per capita basis among the adult population.
1689360	1691520	When Migration Watch adopts this assumption,
1691520	1695120	which we believe is more realistic and grounded in economic evidence,
1695120	1700320	they find that recent EEA immigrants have made an overall fiscal contribution
1700320	1703840	of £1.5 million in 2014.
1703840	1705840	So, what did we just learn there?
1705840	1709680	Well, firstly, Migration Watch aped the methodology of a study
1709680	1712160	that was designed to measure the impact of immigration
1712160	1714560	over the decade since the year 2000,
1714560	1718160	and applied it to study just one year in particular.
1718160	1722160	And this is, strictly academically speaking, very silly.
1722160	1728400	Next, they worked from the assumption that immigrants do not contribute to corporation tax at all.
1728400	1732240	And it turns out, when you make the assumption that immigrants don't pay taxes,
1732240	1734480	it skews the numbers somewhat.
1734480	1739440	Some slight differences in assumptions have been made indeed.
1739440	1741840	This one is just sad, to be honest.
1741840	1747360	Migration Watch UK is trying to ride the coattails of an actual legitimate academic paper
1747360	1751200	by twisting its methodology and making heavily biased assumptions
1751200	1753600	in order to come to the opposite conclusion.
1754160	1759840	It's the old appeal to authority while rejecting that authority's conclusions game again.
1759840	1763440	The Migration Watch report doesn't even have a listed author.
1763440	1765280	It's embarrassing, frankly.
1765280	1768480	So there's your third bulletproof source, Black Pigeon.
1768480	1771200	The pressure group study without an author
1771200	1775280	that makes the small assumption that immigrants don't pay any taxes.
1775280	1777760	But hey, they got the headline.
1777760	1779840	And that's all that counts, really, isn't it?
1779840	1782080	So have you noticed the pattern here?
1782080	1786000	The studies released by government or university academic researchers
1786000	1790000	come to the conclusion that migration is generally positive for the economy.
1790000	1793760	Studies released by right-wing think tanks and pressure groups, on the other hand,
1793760	1797520	come to the conclusion that migration is negative for the economy,
1797520	1800880	but only by deliberately selecting certain date ranges
1800880	1805440	and particular immigrant demographics that allow them to come to that conclusion.
1805440	1808560	And I'd like to ask, can we not reverse the logic
1808560	1811520	of Black Pigeon Speaks' introduction to his video?
1811520	1815840	He says these bulletproof sources prove pro-immigration arguments wrong,
1815840	1820480	but far from being bulletproof, these sources are actually riddled with bullet holes.
1820480	1822560	You know, they're rubbish.
1822560	1826320	So can we therefore conclude that the pro-immigration arguments check out?
1828080	1830560	Yes. Yes, we can.
1830560	1832400	Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.
1832400	1835200	This video wasn't about ancient Rome.
1835200	1838320	I'm sorry, I promised my next video was gonna be about Rome.
1838880	1843440	But that one was taken a while, you see, so what I did was I made this one instead.
1844240	1846640	Expect the Rome video in the next few weeks, probably.
1847200	1850800	Thanks, as always, to all my supporters over on Patreon.
1850800	1853360	I couldn't keep making these videos without your support,
1853360	1857280	and I am incredibly grateful and genuinely thank you all.
1857760	1861360	And for anyone else, if you'd like to help support more videos like this,
1861360	1863760	head over to Patreon and send me a dollar or two.
1863760	1865760	The link will be in the description there.
1865760	1869120	Also follow me on Twitter and all that jazz, if you like.
1869760	1872320	Right, thanks a lot, everyone. See you next time.
