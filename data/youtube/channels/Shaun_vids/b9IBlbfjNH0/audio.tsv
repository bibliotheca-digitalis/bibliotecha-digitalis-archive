0	3400	Hello everyone, so as you may be aware a while back
3400	8240	I made a few videos about the YouTube channel CinemaSins laying out various mistakes
8240	15840	They've made and criticizing their general approach to movie criticism. A response to those videos has been uniformly positive
16520	23040	YouTube users are still leaving me plenty of supportive messages on those videos. For example, Patrick Harris says
23380	26480	Thanks for the video. Like many CinemaSins viewers
26480	31720	I had previously not understood the word satire, but after watching your videos
31720	38140	I now realize that I was using it incorrectly and CinemaSins is not in fact satirical.
38360	40760	Another commenter says keep up the good work
40760	48440	I can't believe CinemaSins conditioned me into laughing at their repetitive unfunny jokes. A humorous intent is no defense
48440	53080	if the joke unfairly denigrates other people's hard work through deception and
53760	55280	falsehood and
55280	57840	John Doe says oh I get it
58200	65360	CinemaSins watches movies and finds things in them to nitpick and you did the same thing to their videos. That's very clever
66320	68320	Although I'm not a fan of yours
68640	76000	Attaching my ego to a clickbait YouTube channel would be ridiculous and thus I will not get mad at you and leave you a nasty message
76440	84520	Anyway, after making those videos I did the sensible thing and stopped watching CinemaSins entirely for more than a year and it was wonderful
84560	89280	I've never known such peace to be honest. It's been the best year of my life so far
91600	92800	However
92800	95300	Recently a friend linked me to this video
96000	103200	Everything wrong with Blade Runner in 17 minutes or less put out by CinemaSins to coincide with the release of the recent
103440	106320	Blade Runner sequel and I thought oh
107080	111440	Go on then, you know, I can handle just one. It's been a while
111640	115960	Maybe they aren't as bad as I remember. Maybe I was exaggerating back then
115960	119760	So I gave it a watch and I saw this
120600	124820	CinemaSins gave Blade Runner a sin for being quote
125680	130360	Super advanced and super dilapidated all at the same time
131360	134480	You know like it's a mistake. Oh
135400	140720	God I'm even getting mad looking at it right now now Blade Runner is of course a
141240	147520	Cyberpunk film and the juxtaposition of advanced technology and societal problems like inequality
147920	154240	Is by design, you know rather than technology leading to a utopian post scarcity future
154640	160320	Films and other works of art in the sub-genre typically ask what if technology keeps advancing?
160320	163800	But we're unable to solve our various societal problems
163800	170180	You know, what if we still have things like inequality class divides crime police?
170800	172200	Slavery and all that, you know
172200	178480	how will the advance of technology interact with and even possibly exacerbate those problems a
178760	183720	Blade Runner being set in the future that is super advanced and super dilapidated at the same time
184120	186760	It's the whole point a point that is
187160	191880	Completely missed by CinemaSins who give the movie a sin and ding it as if it were a mistake
192240	195240	Akin to the boom mic showing in the shot or something
195460	198480	Anyway after thinking about this sin for about four seconds
198480	203080	I realized I was gonna have to make another CinemaSins video, but then I thought
203780	205780	Skipping all the way to the present day
205960	207960	Wouldn't really be right would it?
207960	214220	CinemaSins have put out over a hundred videos in the past year and I bet they've made some really gratuitous mistakes in those
214660	221560	So that's what we're gonna do today pick up where we left off with CinemaSins and catalog just a portion of everything
221560	223440	They've got wrong in the past year
223440	230980	Let's show them how to nitpick properly and let's start off with a sin from their video on the movie 10 Cloverfield Lane
231100	234860	You're the only one small enough to reach it. It's what the filtration system
234860	240180	This guy is the king of over preparedness for disasters and did not know this girl or anyone other than him would be down here
240180	245060	When he built this shelter, but still made the air filtration system accessible to only people one-fifth his size
245360	252580	So why would John Goodman's character build an air filtration system that he was unable to access what a buffoon he is
253220	256040	But let's take a peek at the movie real quick
258780	260780	Your filtration system
260780	262780	Ah
265840	271820	You see he could reach it but something was blocking the hatch and why would something be blocking the hatch
271860	274460	well a minute earlier in the movie a
274760	282040	Then unknown force caused the bunker to shake and that damaged the air filtration system and blocked the hatch to it
282380	289560	Also here when CinemaSins say that John Goodman's character Howard didn't know that anyone else would be down here with him
289640	295300	And that's not true either as there are various clues in the bunker pointing to the fact that Howard had
295600	301280	Previously kept someone else there such as the word help scratched into the glass on the inside of the exit hatch
301280	307200	I also like this sin from later in the video where CinemaSins call a Molotov cocktail a
307920	310660	makeshift Molotov cocktail, you know as
311280	316340	Opposed to the official line of Molotov cocktails that you'd buy in the store
316340	322940	I guess in their video for the rock CinemaSins call these helicopters Blackhawk helicopters
322940	329500	But they're not this is a Blackhawk helicopter, which as you can see doesn't really look anything like what they showed
329980	332900	You know beyond being a helicopter
332900	337100	Let's take a look at a sin from Star Trek 3 the search for Spock
337100	343940	There are your life forms these were microbes on the tube surface microbes by their very definition are microscopic living organisms
343940	347460	I hate to be nitpicky, but these seem way more visible without a microscope than usual
347820	351740	Well, I love to be nitpicky and the line was they were
352260	358220	Microbes in the past tense implying that they are no longer microbes and indeed if we look at the movie
358220	361620	These were microbes on the tube surface. We shot them here from Enterprise
361620	375140	Let's take a look at a sin from their video for the movie The Bourne Supremacy now from near the end of the movie
375140	378200	Somehow with all these witnesses Bourne still escapes into the ether after this
378260	381960	So a lot of witnesses saw Bourne after his car crash in the tunnel
381960	387380	So how did he possibly escape and you might be wondering well, what's wrong with this?
387620	393940	Well, let's now watch us in from the start of their video for the next movie in the series The Bourne Ultimatum
393940	396740	Which continues the story after this car crash?
396780	400940	So the Moscow police are coming after Bourne because of that tunnel chase scene from the last movie
400940	402860	How the fuck did Bourne get spotted in the first place?
402860	407300	And how is he identified by anyone in that dark ass tunnel and that's unbelievable, isn't it?
407300	411820	How did Bourne get away with all these witnesses there and then the next movie?
411960	415420	How did any of those witnesses see Bourne in that dark tunnel?
416060	417020	Shameful
417020	420500	These videos came out only two days apart, by the way
421300	424540	Similar to that. Let's look at a sin from their video about Ghost in the Shell
425020	428340	Earlier we saw that the major is heavy and dense enough to bend a metal roof tile
428340	431580	But here she's buoyant enough to float on water instead of sinking like a rock
431660	434960	So how can the major float when she's so heavy?
435180	435700	Well
435700	440700	The shot CinemaSins used is taken from the end of the diving scene after we've already seen the
440780	443900	flotation device on the majors back carry her to the surface
444420	449780	CinemaSins neglect to show that obviously what they also don't mention here is the following
450020	455740	conversation on the boat where Batou talks to the major about how dangerous it is for cyborgs to go swimming and
455980	461360	Specifically mentions the majors flotation equipment, you know, how did CinemaSins miss this scene?
461820	468720	Well, it turns out they didn't major is swimming in this scene much like she does in the original only the original brings up
468720	472720	How dangerous it is for cybernetic humans to go deep in the water like this because you know
472760	476840	They're made of heavy machinery, but this movie doesn't mention it once since this scenes compress so much
476840	478840	It feels like it's in gif format. So
479440	481440	CinemaSins did see that scene
481700	487460	They must have in order to use it to criticize the live-action remake and that's pretty shady, isn't it?
487800	494720	This just confirms my suspicions that CinemaSins write their scripts while watching the movie for the first time and don't go back to do
494720	501900	Any editing when the movie provides them with additional information that proves them wrong at the start of their video for Citizen Kane?
502900	504300	Citizen Kane
504300	506300	They call these gondolas
506420	509420	Viking canoes and then go on to say this
509580	514900	rich guys castle has a drivable par-4 on hole 16 just so he can feel good about himself toward the end of the round a
515340	517340	drivable par-4 at
518020	519420	365 yards
519420	521200	Well that seemed a little off to me
521200	528420	So I went to check and found a page on golf week.com that lists the average PGA Tour driving distances for recent years
528500	536180	And they have never averaged over 300 yards and they're professional golfers. So is this a drivable par-4?
536660	539380	Well, maybe for about 30 people on the planet
539380	546780	But that's it and I'd like to thank CinemaSins for getting two obvious things wrong in the first minute of their video about Citizen Kane
546900	553980	So that I didn't have to force myself to watch the rest of it from Citizen Kane to the Lego Batman movie now
554020	556500	This is where the movie loses me and starts to just be noise
556780	563900	tossing in the Wicked Witch from Wizard of Oz Sauron Bremlins agents from the matrix King Kong Voldemort Daleks Daleks
565660	566880	Daleks
566880	570060	What's that? Oh, it's a day look isn't it?
570660	571900	incredible
571900	579100	In their video about blade they criticized the distance between the bite marks of the quotes vampire incisors
579460	585420	But vampires are usually depicted not with sharp incisors, but with sharp canines as indeed
585420	586780	They are in blade
586780	593140	That's a canine right there in their video for the jungle book remake CinemaSins call Shere Khan a quote
593580	601640	African tiger, which is odd both because the jungle book is set in India and African tigers don't exist
602620	608280	CinemaSins still don't know too much about animals. I see let's do a few more animal examples here
608860	614800	Starting with their video for Saw 2 where they say that this person is wearing a horse mask
615280	620600	That's a horse snout there. I guess and in their video for Pocahontas
620600	626920	They call this raccoon a rodent but raccoons aren't rodents in finding Dory
626920	631880	They think that the octopus characters camouflage automatically blends in with the background
632240	634240	But this is not the case in
634240	641200	Reality the mimic octopus for example is able to control its camouflage ability at will not only to blend in with its surroundings
641200	646480	But also to mimic other animals and in their video for the movie split they call these mice
647120	655480	Gerbils so where does one learn about animals because CinemaSins need to go and be there in their video for
655600	660160	Shrek they say that the DreamWorks logo has two letter E's in it
660960	663300	And I'm not too sure about this to be honest
663300	670160	I mean I I see the first one sure between the R and the a there and with them on that but after that
670560	676540	I'm lost I'm afraid in how to train your dragon to they refer to a character called Doba
677400	681000	However, there isn't a character called Doba in this movie
681320	686240	There's a character called gober, so I'd guess they meant him is probably a safe bet
687040	690800	Similar to that in Jack Reacher they refer to a character named Stacy
691440	695080	However, there is no character called Stacy in Jack Reacher
695680	699520	Who is Stacy CinemaSins? I have no idea
700280	705240	Watch the following sin from Captain America Civil War. What was her name again?
705240	709800	The Loras you called her Doc. Steve remembers the name of some random redhead buck
709800	716040	He tried to impress more than 70 years ago. How can Captain America remember things that happened 70 years ago?
716440	716960	well
716960	718960	If you remember CinemaSins
719160	725560	Captain America fell into a coma sometime in the Second World War and woke up in the present day so for him
726000	728720	Consciously, it's a relatively recent event
729040	734160	Let's do another superhero one this from early in their video for Batman vs Superman
734640	739760	Dawn of Justice all it takes to get the most precious element on earth is a couple of free divers with a motorboat and a
739760	744400	Dream is it ever explained how this Kryptonian vessel full of kryptonite crash-landed in the Indian fucking ocean
744640	750920	So that's some people finding kryptonite in the Indian Ocean there, that's odd, isn't it? Where did that come from?
751640	756240	Well, if you recall CinemaSins, there was a movie called Man of Steel
756240	762240	Which I know you've seen because you did a video about it in which the plan of the antagonist in that movie was to
762400	766900	Terraform the earth into a new Krypton using a large terraforming machine
767560	771120	Located above the Indian Ocean and that's how the kryptonite got there
771120	779560	It was the big kryptonian terraforming machine from the previous movie in the series and there's even an establishing shot of it earlier in the movie
779560	782060	And CinemaSins used that in their video
782840	788880	Look at this following nonsense from their video about Gone Girl the morning of what the morning of what? Yeah
788880	794040	Yeah, we know it means this is the morning of her disappearance, but won't her disappearance. Tell us that the morning of what?
794560	797080	the morning of July 5th
797800	800120	It says it right there on the screen
801040	803960	Next movie, let's do The Conjuring 2
804400	809680	So, okay at the start of this movie a character relives the events of November 13th
810360	815440	1974 when Ronald DeFeo jr. Shot and killed six members of his family in Amityville
816720	820760	CinemaSins criticized the movie for showing the family sleeping through the gunshots
820760	823480	But this is actually faithful to the account of the case
823760	828640	Police were puzzled by the fact that nobody appeared to have gotten out of bed to investigate the gunshots
828880	834500	As all the victims were found face down in bed, so plus one to the movie for accuracy
834500	837400	I guess but that's not what I want to talk about here
837400	843720	I want to talk about this in movie proves Vera Farmiga has a way better imaginary dream shotgun than you do a dream
844200	849400	Shotgun. Hey, well, you see the murders were actually carried out with a lever action rifle
849600	856800	Not a shotgun and is that unfair of me, you know criticizing CinemaSins for not recognizing an invisible gun
857320	860540	Well, no because later in that scene the character
861060	865680	Experiencing the vision walks in front of a mirror and the rifle is briefly visible
865680	870240	and I know CinemaSins saw it because they featured it in a sin, so
870960	877800	Near in their video about I am legend CinemaSins say the following the viral zombie apocalypse somehow
877800	882040	Destroyed two-thirds of all the most famous bridges in New York. The bridges were destroyed
882760	886440	Somehow I wonder how any ideas movie
886800	894800	...
894800	899600	That's right, the military destroyed the bridges. How did CinemaSins miss that?
899600	906240	Well, they give the movie a sin for having the broken bridges at about 25 minutes into the movie and the bridges aren't shown
906240	909720	Being blown up until a flashback that happens over 30 minutes later
910240	914760	CinemaSins just didn't go back to edit the bridge sin out when they were shown to be wrong
914960	921120	Because they're lazy and their videos are bad. This next sin is from their video for the movie Krampus
921200	923080	Back when Howard handed Tom this gun
923080	928160	He didn't give him any more ammo and when Howard got attacked by the gopher from Caddyshack Tom fired off two rounds
928160	930040	So where the hell did these extra rounds come from?
930040	937480	Well, that's because revolvers don't auto-eject casings. The cylinder would still look like that even with all of the shots fired
937600	943500	You'd have to eject the casings manually. Now, here's an annoying one from their video for John Wick
944260	950840	Every umbrella at a funeral is black cliche and this is something they're repeating their video for Justice League
951300	956700	Flashpoint Paradox. Now depicting umbrellas at a funeral being black isn't a cliche
956700	962780	It's an accurate representation of a behavior that actually happens in reality and this worries me a little
962780	966720	it makes me think the CinemaSins guys have been turning up to funerals with like
967260	971220	This and not understanding that that is generally considered inappropriate
972220	980040	Anyway, let's move on. Now CinemaSins have previously taken some heat for their assertion that there is no gravity in space
980260	985100	And in their video about the animated Transformers movie, they repeat that mistake
985840	989400	Sarcastically saying this is how gravity works in space kids
989860	995520	When the character Unicron drops another character into their mouth. The thing here though
995520	997820	Is that Unicron is the size of a planet?
997820	1000400	So that's exactly how gravity quote
1000820	1007660	Works because if the character has the mass of a planet then it will attract other objects of mass in the same manner as a
1007660	1008660	planet
1008660	1011160	CinemaSins seem to think there's some sort of difference
1011940	1018900	Gravitationally speaking between being quote in space and the inferred opposite state not in space
1018980	1022460	Whatever that means but no we're in space now
1022740	1027960	CinemaSins all the time as far as gravity is concerned. Anyway, the earth doesn't like
1029020	1031720	Generate gravity for us or something
1032720	1034940	These guys need to go and read their Albert Einstein
1035540	1040420	Kind of Logan to carry professor X to his bed for some rest and I'd be calling by this imagery if he wasn't also leaving
1040420	1044480	The wheelchair so far away from the bed is to render Charles immobile until further human assistance arrives
1044760	1051320	So why would Logan leave the chair so far from the bed instead of moving it closer? That's rather mean, isn't it?
1052040	1054040	Anything to say for yourself movie?
1055080	1062520	Forces forces glad you're not in that business anymore. They don't want me. They want you. Oh
1063260	1064120	Look at that
1064120	1071260	He does move it closer and you can even see it closer to the bed in the CinemaSins video a few sins later
1072140	1077400	Shameful stuff there their video about the movie in time is quite droll
1077820	1085400	The second sin in that video is complaining about how the movie never explains its premise and the third sin in that video is complaining
1085400	1086720	about the movie
1086720	1092480	Overexplaining itself fire an expositional monologue that gives away the conceit now the conceit of that movie by the way
1092480	1098040	It's that people stop aging at 25 and then use remaining lifetime as a currency
1098040	1103080	So you have poor people with only a few hours on the clock and rich people with hundreds of years, you know
1103080	1108540	You get it. Now. I mention it here because CinemaSins later give the movie a sin for the characters being
1109320	1111320	motivated by currency and
1112080	1118040	Yes, I'd imagine the ticking death clocks they have in their arms that will kill them when they run out of time would be
1118560	1124000	Pretty big motivators actually in their video for the movie the purge election year
1124520	1131640	CinemaSins are surprised to see somebody stab through a bulletproof vest and this is a mistake. They repeat in their video for the rock
1132240	1135960	Now the thing about bulletproof vests is they're bulletproof
1136840	1144320	What you'd wear to protect against knives is a stab proof vest and they're different things designed and constructed in different ways for different
1144760	1146040	purposes
1146040	1149880	Bulletproof vests are built to disperse the kinetic energy of a projectile
1149920	1155800	Throughout the material and aren't really built to stop something sharp and pointed that can pierce through the material
1156080	1159660	The more, you know, hey in their video for I robot
1159660	1165800	they think that the characters are driving a hover car and give the movie a sin when they hear the wheels screech on the ground and
1166200	1171980	But it's actually a prototype car with spherical wheels and not a hover car their video for the movie
1171980	1175160	Moana is pretty offensive at several points
1175600	1179760	CinemaSins refusal to do any research or look anything up comes off really badly
1180120	1185680	When they're watching a movie based on the mythology and culture of a people at CinemaSins have no idea about
1185880	1190080	For example, they give the movie a sin for featuring a fish hook constellation
1190080	1195080	Which they call fictional but in reality is an actual Polynesian constellation
1195480	1199580	Better recognized in the West as the tail of the constellation Scorpio
1199640	1204880	They also give the movie a sin for featuring this thing which is a Polynesian slit drum
1205000	1208160	Which CinemaSins say looks nothing like a drum
1208760	1213220	Apparently they were expecting one of these in the ancient cave or something
1213280	1217720	Watch the following sin from their video about the movie battle Los Angeles
1220400	1225560	First off can you be a little more specific wouldn't you want to know the exact time left before the rescue helicopter arrives?
1225600	1228160	Also ten minutes ago random marine number four yelled
1231040	1236800	So I'd synchronize those swatches if I were you now the mistake CinemaSins made there was that the soldier was actually shouting
1237200	1241840	25 meters not 25 minutes to indicate distance and not time
1242040	1248700	So that explains that supposed discrepancy there in their video for now you see me too. They make a rather funny mistake
1248720	1250920	This is what we've been waiting for now
1250920	1256800	It's time to get the work since when do the world's best magicians blindly sign up to be basically MacGyver going after wrongdoers and corporate
1256800	1257620	Stooges also
1257620	1262520	Why are they all shining their flashlights on these blueprints in the shot as though flashlight activated blueprints are an actual thing?
1262520	1265780	You see those aren't flashlights. They're black lights
1265840	1270120	They're revealing something that was drawn in ink that only shows up under a black light
1270400	1274840	There's also this sin from later in the movie. This is my twin brother chase
1274840	1279900	What the actual movie also character has a twin brother or any kind of sibling that they never mentioned before?
1280240	1283480	So has that character's brother never been mentioned before?
1283960	1287400	Well about half an hour into the previous movie in that series
1287400	1293680	This is said two TV specials slowly days then your brother slash manager disappeared with all your hard-earned money
1294240	1295680	Did you research?
1295680	1299840	So that character's brother was mentioned before hardy-ha
1300920	1306280	Similar to this sin is the following one from their video about home alone. Why do the McAllisters have a doggy door?
1306280	1308840	There's no mention of a dog or cat throughout this entire movie
1308840	1314720	Is it sole purpose shooting bad guys in the crotch with bb's no mention of a dog throughout the entire movie?
1315440	1318520	However two minutes into the movie this happens
1323360	1326200	Let's do another similar one from the movie trolls
1326200	1330900	I'll just get my worthless scullery made to get another place setting ready for the lovely lady
1331920	1333520	glitter sparkles
1333520	1335720	Crystal only introduced Bridget as his plus one
1335720	1340500	So the only way chef could know her name is if the screenwriters were committed to seeing Christine Baranski chew the hell out of this
1340620	1345540	So, how did this character know this character's name when they weren't introduced
1345540	1352540	Well ten seconds previously in the movie this happens meet the lovely lady glitter sparkles
1354300	1359400	So what happened to their cinema sins was it so hard to find things to criticize about
1359700	1365320	Trolls that you had to lie about something that just happened in the movie. I don't know
1366320	1370800	Take the gloves off sugar Ray that's like a 30 year old boxing reference at this point
1370800	1372400	This is movie taking place in the 70s
1372400	1376200	Or is it just a dated boxing reference worst thing is the movie will never answer this question
1376280	1379880	So what time period is the nutjob set?
1380440	1383320	Apparently the movie never answers this question
1383320	1389780	Well, we as viewers can infer the general time period of the movie from several contextual clues
1390140	1395100	For example the opening of the movie shows these old-fashioned cars driving on the roads
1395100	1398580	And there's this guy wearing suspenders and a flat cap
1399220	1406540	There's this 50s mobster looking guy sitting on a bench this newspaper that displays the date as October 21st
1407340	1414020	1959 and combined from all these contextual hints. I'm able to estimate the general date that the movie set as
1414540	1416540	October 21st
1417100	1419740	1959 the movie will never answer this question
1420500	1428020	My foot cinema sins were confused there by the sugar Ray reference probably mistaking it to mean sugar Ray Leonard
1428360	1434200	Who was only three years old in 1959 and thus probably not yet a well-known boxer
1434580	1440820	More likely though the characters were referencing sugar Ray Robinson who was a boxer active throughout the 1950s
1441180	1447060	Some more time period shenanigans now first from their video about Pirates of the Caribbean on
1447820	1452420	Stranger Tides which cinema sins say takes place in the late 17th century
1453300	1457620	The movie is actually set in 1750 which isn't in the 17th century
1458420	1459900	Just trust me
1459900	1466780	And I've got no clue where cinema sins got the late part from I think that was just a random guess really in their video
1466780	1470820	For the movie King Arthur they refer to a medieval battle happening
1470820	1476220	even though the movies set during the late Roman occupation of Britain making medieval an
1476780	1481460	Incorrect descriptor there. They also elsewhere refer to England's army
1481460	1488580	Even though England didn't even exist at that point and watch the following sin from their video about Alice through the looking-glass
1489140	1495160	In Hollywood doctors do not squirt out part of the medicine to fucking test if a syringe is working how you ever got started on
1495160	1498200	This troop I will never know but not get the off rather
1498760	1506040	Angry about syringes that so yes doctors don't squirt out a bit of the medicine in order to test if the syringe is working
1506120	1511000	But they do squirt out a bit of the medicine to ensure there are no air bubbles in the syringe
1512040	1514240	Injecting air into someone can be very dangerous
1514760	1520400	So what they do is tap the syringe a few times and then squirt a bit out to force any air out of the syringe
1520400	1521840	before use
1521840	1527800	Isn't learning fun watch the following sin from Fantastic Beasts and where to find them
1528240	1532600	Legilimens yeah, but I always have trouble with your kind Brits
1532760	1534440	That's British also
1534440	1539520	Legilimens is someone who can read minds someone that was never once introduced in the entire world of Harry Potter before now
1539560	1545680	So this Legilimens thing is something that was never introduced in the entire world of Harry Potter
1545680	1549760	Well that's not true because it's in the books for a start
1549760	1555640	But maybe CinemaSins just meant the movies and so has it been mentioned in the movies before
1556120	1559020	Well if we watch Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1566560	1572320	That's right Snape says it let's take a look at a sin from their video about the movie Central Intelligence
1573040	1575360	It's 6 p.m.. And they're in the Eastern time zone
1575360	1580680	So there's no way there's a football game on unless this bar is showing reruns because the NFL never plays games that start at 6 p.m.
1580680	1581800	Eastern
1581800	1588480	Okay, so there's a lot wrong with this and so the NFL never plays games that start at 6 p.m.. Eastern
1588680	1594000	Well the first problem here is that there's nothing in the movie to indicate that this game has just started
1594000	1596360	It could be a game that started earlier
1596360	1601120	And is still playing at the next problem here is if we do a little zoom and enhance
1601120	1604180	We can make out the team logo on the field which is this
1604520	1612280	The Tiger Eye logo of the team the LSU Tigers which is a college team and thus wouldn't be playing in an NFL game anyway
1612320	1619080	So this sin is wrong twice in two completely different ways well done CinemaSins in their video for the movie
1619080	1625280	Don't Breathe they tried a character for urinating at a crime scene for leaving his DNA there
1625560	1631720	Although actually urine doesn't contain DNA that's a fun biology factor for you there
1632360	1634480	in their video for Toy Story 3
1634480	1638400	They spell the character Sid's name wrong and refer to him as a serial killer
1638760	1646080	And not noticing that Sid is actually featured in the movie as a garbage man also from this movie is the following sin
1648360	1653840	Then why did you take it out in the first place also didn't previous movie show us your organs still work even when not attached
1653840	1656920	So why not just look through that eye to figure out where it is, right?
1656960	1662940	Yeah, why didn't she just look through the eye to find where it was that I'd be clever wouldn't it oh wait
1663460	1668900	She does do that in blade 2 they incorrectly refers to the mutated vampires as
1669280	1675960	Creepers when they're actually called Reapers in the ring too. They think the town the characters move to Astoria
1676000	1680160	It's in Washington and when it's actually in Oregon in
1680580	1684160	Ghostbusters they refer to this thing as a bicycle, but it isn't
1684960	1689520	In Hellboy they're confused when a character pulls the pins on two grenades
1689520	1693840	But throws them one at a time and not understanding how grenades work
1693840	1700640	I guess pulling the pin doesn't actually do anything by itself the pin is just there to hold the strike lever in place
1700640	1704920	It's releasing this lever that causes the grenade to explode after a short delay
1705240	1710400	You can actually put the pin back in a grenade safely assuming the leaf has been held down the whole time
1711200	1715040	Although I'd advise against trying it in that video for unbreakable
1715040	1719920	They give the movie a sin for having train seats that face backwards as well as forwards
1720440	1726180	I don't know. Why is that an unusual thing in the States like over here pretty much all the trains
1726180	1733600	I like that in their video for suicide squad they claim the character dr. Moon explored a cave featured earlier by herself
1734320	1740420	But if you watch the movie you can see someone else with her in that flashback implying there were other people with her on the
1740420	1747880	Trip unless that person is just someone she bumped into in passing in the middle of a jungle which while possible would be kind of weird
1748320	1750320	In the original planet of the Apes
1750440	1757300	There's a scene where the Apes flush some humans out of a cornfield using sticks and when cinema sins watch it
1757300	1759560	They think the Apes are cutting the corn down
1760080	1762080	With blunt sticks
1762080	1765040	Above course, they're not they're just flushing people out
1765040	1768140	I mean you can obviously see they're not cutting down the corn
1768140	1773000	So I haven't got a clue what cinema sins were on about here in their video for the movie contact
1773000	1779200	They mock the appearance of this nebula, but that's actually a real nebula. It's called the pillars of creation
1779420	1784480	They also say that the moon is quote nowhere near that size relative to the earth
1785120	1788720	But without a reference for where the camera is located here
1789160	1791040	That's a silly statement
1791040	1794800	After all, if you're very close to the moon, it would appear larger than the earth
1795040	1799200	You'd need to know exactly where the camera was located in order to make that judgment
1799560	1803680	Let's watch a sin from their video about the movie kung fu panda free
1805560	1810460	If no one could find you pink on the down I've got this but yeah, he's right
1810560	1814600	So let's watch the clip from the movie to give us a little bit more context here
1818720	1820400	Wow
1820400	1825320	But how did you know where I was I received a message that led me here
1825320	1832040	How could you receive a message if no one could find you sounds suspicious to me. So, okay
1832040	1840440	How did pose biological father get a message telling him where Poe was if he lives in a secret village any ideas movie?
1841280	1844160	No, it was a message from the universe
1845680	1847680	That's grown
1849200	1856440	As I hope you would when I sent the message to your father, huh, you sent the universe mail, whoa
1857080	1858560	Yes
1858560	1865600	But again, that's a reveal from the end of the movie and cinema sins couldn't be bothered going back to correct their earlier mistake
1865840	1867940	Let's watch a sin from their video about the
1868560	1875200	2017 live-action remake of beauty and the Beast since this movie suffers from the exact issue about the castle being in plain sight
1875200	1876640	I'll just repeat the same sin
1876640	1879600	I gave the last movie the Beast has only been secretly beasting for 10 years
1879600	1882120	But Maurice is somehow unaware of this very nearby castle
1882120	1887200	Also, it's super weird that the villagers wouldn't be at all disturbed that the prince of the very nearby castle hasn't been seen or heard
1887200	1893200	From in years and even if this prince is habitually reclusive you'd think that someone would know one of the 300 live-in servants and wonder
1893200	1894920	Where they are, right, right?
1894920	1900840	No, I wouldn't think that was weird because I watched the movie as days bled into years
1901320	1904200	The prince and his servants were forgotten by the world
1904840	1909660	For the Enchantress had erased all memory of them from the minds of the people they loved
1910160	1915800	Now that clip occurs during the opening narration. So how did cinema sins missed that?
1915920	1922400	Well, check this out for the Enchantress had erased all memory of them from the minds of the people they loved
1922520	1925580	That's an excellent attempt to close a plot hole opened by the animated movie
1925580	1930620	But it leaves me with a whole new set of questions. Yeah, that's right. They gave it a sin
1930660	1933060	So what happened here then?
1933060	1939940	You know at some point between writing this sin and the one from later in the video cinema sins somehow forgot the details of the
1939940	1942500	Opening narration that they watched, you know
1942500	1948140	That or these videos are a collaborative effort written by several people who don't talk to each other or something
1948700	1952340	Let's watch a sin from their video about Star Wars the Clone Wars
1953020	1959540	Crime Lord Jabba the Hudson has been kidnapped by a rival band of pirates. Excuse me. What his son
1959540	1962340	Are you serious funny? We're only hearing about this guy just now
1965220	1971140	This warlord reaches out to the federal government to help him find his captured son instead of simply taking matters into his own hands and
1971140	1972540	Sending a bunch of bounty hunters to do it
1972540	1979480	So why didn't Jabba the Hutt hire some bounty hunters to find his son that seems like the sort of thing he'd do, right?
1980020	1984460	Well 15 minutes into the movie this happens. Yes commander
1984500	1988560	We've discovered that Jabba the Hutt has also hired bounty hunters to track down his son
1988740	1995980	It turns out Jabba did hire some bounty hunters cinema sins just lied about it in their video for the movie sing
1995980	2002180	They wonder if the shrimp act need a handler to push their tank around but later when they're dismissed from the show
2002420	2007300	We see that they do in fact have a handler with them in their video for Star Trek Beyond
2007300	2013560	They give the movie a sin because the alien planet has air that humans can breathe. What a coincidence, eh?
2014000	2017300	What they missed was this scene 18 minutes into the movie
2018000	2019880	approaching ultimate
2019880	2023680	Class M planet now an M class planet
2023680	2028460	There is the Star Trek universe's designation for a planet suitable for human life
2028460	2033340	And now you might say well that's still an unlikely narrative convenience, isn't it?
2033340	2040680	Even if they did establish it earlier in the story and you would nearly be right except for the fact that the antagonist is later
2040680	2047260	Revealed to actually be a human Starfleet captain played by Idris Elba who crash-landed on that planet long ago
2047260	2047800	and
2047800	2053600	Thus the planet would have to be able to support human life or he would have died when he crashed and none of the events
2053600	2055500	Of the film would have taken place
2055500	2060800	So there now do you want to see possibly the worst cinema sin I have ever encountered
2061280	2067120	This really gets me this one from their video about the movie too fast too furious
2067120	2072100	If slapjack is only going over 100 then seconds later Brian hits the nos and is blasting past 160
2072100	2076500	How is slapjack not eating Brian's dust, right? So this is
2077800	2079280	annoying
2079280	2085220	So the characters slapjack and Brian are engaged in some sort of illegal
2085520	2089640	Street race and though both cars appear to be going at a similar speed
2090080	2094500	When we see close-ups of their speedometer as we see that Brian is doing 160
2095020	2097540	Whereas slapjack is doing about a hundred
2098220	2104500	What a silly movie mistake you might think if you were some sort of utter
2104780	2110320	Buffoon who had never seen a car you see Brian's speedometer is in kilometers per hour
2111140	2113140	That's why it says 160
2113740	2120860	Slapjack's speedometer on the other hand is primarily in miles per hour. So it shows him doing 100. But what are these other?
2121620	2124620	Smaller numbers in red on the inside there
2124660	2129780	Well, that's the speed of slapjacks car in kilometers per hour. And would you look at that?
2130060	2137180	He's doing about 160 which is how fast Brian is going and that's why the cars appear to be going the same
2138060	2140060	goddamn speed
2140700	2147420	At cinema sins don't seem to have much of a clue when it comes to cars in their video for the movie
2147540	2153060	Jason Bourne, they incorrectly identify this Dodge Charger as a Dodge Challenger
2153620	2157980	And in their video for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles out of the shadows
2157980	2161560	They jokingly expect this SRT to turn into bumblebee
2162080	2164820	Except of course, we all know that bumblebee is a Camaro
2165240	2168860	Let's take a look at a sin from their video about the movie angry birds
2169140	2172420	movie has mine birds because it's super funny and you just didn't realize it
2173100	2178780	Is going on here is he in school and if so, why is he hireable as a clown? Why is he painting?
2178780	2181740	Why was there a mime hanging out a second ago? Where the fuck is this village?
2181740	2185820	This is the one time I'd welcome a little fucking narration. So what's going on here then?
2185860	2193540	Well, this section of the movie is actually a montage of various scenes from the main characters life showing situations in which he's been
2193540	2198500	Angry, I guess and this particular scene is a flashback to his time in school
2198500	2201940	I mean, here's how he looked just five seconds ago
2201940	2207340	and then it cuts to him in school and he looks like this a little kid version of himself and
2207620	2214620	I guess the filmmakers trusted in the ability of their audience to recognize a series of flashbacks and not try to
2214780	2220600	Interpret it as a linear narrative in which the character rapidly changes age appearance and location
2220980	2227500	But I guess they didn't account for the cinema sins guys who need to be led by the hand through absolutely everything
2227620	2230820	Let's watch the first few sins from their video about the movie
2231060	2237660	Warcraft there has been a war between orcs and humans for as long as can be remembered or as long as it's been since Tolkien
2237660	2240820	Created the orcs were blatantly stealing for this game movie also narration
2240820	2244620	But there was once a time when we did not even know who our enemy was
2244820	2247940	We just said you've been fighting with humans as long as you can remember
2247940	2252420	So, how do you remember the time before that when you didn't even know your enemy but in the beginning?
2252660	2258420	How could we have known know what you've given me three statements so far two about knowing one about wondering how you could have known
2258420	2260460	And already I think I see the problem with this movie
2260540	2261020	Okay
2261020	2262860	So there's a few problems here
2262860	2267820	Firstly the orc voiceover says we've been fighting humans as long as we can remember
2267900	2274620	But there was once a time when we did not know who our enemy was now, that's not actually a contradiction
2275580	2281380	Knowledge of the existence of a time before your memory begins does not mean you personally remember it
2281540	2284300	Just that you know about it for example
2284300	2290220	I have knowledge of the existence of ancient Rome, but that doesn't mean I personally remember it does it?
2291300	2297020	Secondly here where cinema sins say known what you've given me three statements so far etc
2297940	2302940	That's not true cinema sins cut a line out of the opening narration here
2302980	2308040	Let's have a listen, but there was once a time when we did not even know who our enemy was
2312220	2323940	So the following line, but in the beginning how could we have known is referring to this previous line about what the green fell magic did to them
2324420	2329860	Cinema sins just cut that line out to make the narration seem worse than it actually is I mean
2330180	2335240	It's still pretty bad, so I don't know why cinema sins bothered to misrepresent it really
2335560	2338240	But they did in the Lego movie
2338240	2343760	They point out this Lego bike and say the minifigures couldn't ride it because it only has one stud at the back
2344160	2349680	But actually they can ride those they stand over the middle. That's not a seat back there
2349680	2356800	That's just a rear wheel guard in Die Hard 2. There's the following sin recalibrate sea level recalibrate sea level
2356800	2362560	Don't the planes have independent meters and gauges that are not reliant upon control towers to determine how far they are up in the air
2363520	2370080	No, actually one of the purposes of the control tower is to transmit to the planes a code based on atmospheric pressure
2370680	2376760	That the planes need to calculate their altitude above sea level not all planes can do that independently
2377080	2378880	Here's a fun one next it
2378880	2383120	Do you know how cinema sins like to do this in case you confused it for Bruce go, Kentucky?
2383120	2389000	You know hardy ha we obviously know the country who would need to be told what country we were in
2389220	2391620	You know certainly not us at cinema sins
2392560	2399260	Well, that's in there is from their video about x-men apocalypse, and now here's a sin from later in the video
2402040	2408360	Because someone decided to wake up apocalypse right now an earthquake in Egypt was felt all the way to Germany they think they're in Germany
2408900	2413880	Even with the word Poland appearing on the screen in the movie. They still got the country wrong
2414100	2421320	They also think that Andalusia is a city in Spain instead of a region in Spain and they confuse Goa India with the non-existent
2422040	2429200	Gao India, so we'll just add geography to the list of things cinema sins doesn't understand alongside animals
2429960	2431960	history cars guns
2432380	2439200	Movies and whatever else oh this video is getting on a bit isn't it and let's double time a few minor errors here
2440440	2446120	In peach dragon they type 3 minutes and 15 minutes instead of 3 minutes and 15 seconds
2446120	2448980	They here type spirit instead of spirit
2449120	2454400	They forget the space between in and 15 in the title of their video for the boss, baby
2454460	2458780	They leave out the word to in this sentence from there the mummy returns video
2459420	2461860	everything wrong with Deadpool in 16 minutes
2462580	2467100	Everything wrong with Deadpool in 15 minutes in the secret life of pets
2467100	2471840	They use the wrong ending template for the video the one from their music sins channel a mistake
2471840	2474880	They repeat several times in other videos before correcting it
2474880	2480320	I mean I could keep going this video contains just a portion of the mistakes
2480320	2486880	I found watching through cinema sins offerings from the past year. I've got 10 a4 pages filled with this
2487400	2491080	Both sides this video could have been three times as long
2491800	2495360	Easily, but I think I should probably arbitrarily stop here
2495880	2497880	So what have we learned today?
2498220	2504480	Well, nothing new the cinema sin still hasn't improved at all if anything they've gotten worse
2504880	2512600	And they're still incapable of following along with even the simplest stories unless they're held by the hand the whole time with on-screen text and narration
2513000	2516800	Which they'll then complain about anyway, and then probably forget
2517000	2524000	They'll still lie about and misrepresent the content of movies in order to provide their audience with an unearned smug feeling of superiority
2524560	2527280	Over something and they still don't know anything
2527880	2533080	At all about anything and the worst of all they're not funny
2533520	2540840	The cinema sins YouTube channel is probably the only human creation to which I would deny the title art
2541880	2545960	Thanks a lot for watching everyone if you'd like to see more videos like this
2546960	2554320	Well, don't support me on on patreon. I'm not gonna be making more videos like this. I mean once a year max
2555000	2561840	Every cinema sins video is a Gordian knot of wrongness and untangling it costs a part of your soul
2562440	2566700	Thanks to all my patrons anyway, I mean I couldn't continue to do this without them
2566960	2572040	So I should probably be blaming them here rather than thanking them thinking about it
2572720	2574720	How dare you support me?
2575240	2578720	Honestly, I take it as an insult. I'm supported in this
2581200	2588080	Anyway see you next year, I guess and we'll look at everything they got wrong between now and then bye
