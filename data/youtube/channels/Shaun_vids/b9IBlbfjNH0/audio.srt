00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
Hello everyone, so as you may be aware a while back

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:08,240
I made a few videos about the YouTube channel CinemaSins laying out various mistakes

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:15,840
They've made and criticizing their general approach to movie criticism. A response to those videos has been uniformly positive

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:23,040
YouTube users are still leaving me plenty of supportive messages on those videos. For example, Patrick Harris says

5
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,480
Thanks for the video. Like many CinemaSins viewers

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,720
I had previously not understood the word satire, but after watching your videos

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:38,140
I now realize that I was using it incorrectly and CinemaSins is not in fact satirical.

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,760
Another commenter says keep up the good work

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:48,440
I can't believe CinemaSins conditioned me into laughing at their repetitive unfunny jokes. A humorous intent is no defense

10
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,080
if the joke unfairly denigrates other people's hard work through deception and

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,280
falsehood and

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,840
John Doe says oh I get it

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:05,360
CinemaSins watches movies and finds things in them to nitpick and you did the same thing to their videos. That's very clever

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,320
Although I'm not a fan of yours

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,000
Attaching my ego to a clickbait YouTube channel would be ridiculous and thus I will not get mad at you and leave you a nasty message

16
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:24,520
Anyway, after making those videos I did the sensible thing and stopped watching CinemaSins entirely for more than a year and it was wonderful

17
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,280
I've never known such peace to be honest. It's been the best year of my life so far

18
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,800
However

19
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,300
Recently a friend linked me to this video

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,200
Everything wrong with Blade Runner in 17 minutes or less put out by CinemaSins to coincide with the release of the recent

21
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,320
Blade Runner sequel and I thought oh

22
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,440
Go on then, you know, I can handle just one. It's been a while

23
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,960
Maybe they aren't as bad as I remember. Maybe I was exaggerating back then

24
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,760
So I gave it a watch and I saw this

25
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,820
CinemaSins gave Blade Runner a sin for being quote

26
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,360
Super advanced and super dilapidated all at the same time

27
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,480
You know like it's a mistake. Oh

28
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,720
God I'm even getting mad looking at it right now now Blade Runner is of course a

29
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:27,520
Cyberpunk film and the juxtaposition of advanced technology and societal problems like inequality

30
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:34,240
Is by design, you know rather than technology leading to a utopian post scarcity future

31
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,320
Films and other works of art in the sub-genre typically ask what if technology keeps advancing?

32
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,800
But we're unable to solve our various societal problems

33
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:50,180
You know, what if we still have things like inequality class divides crime police?

34
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,200
Slavery and all that, you know

35
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:58,480
how will the advance of technology interact with and even possibly exacerbate those problems a

36
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,720
Blade Runner being set in the future that is super advanced and super dilapidated at the same time

37
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,760
It's the whole point a point that is

38
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,880
Completely missed by CinemaSins who give the movie a sin and ding it as if it were a mistake

39
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,240
Akin to the boom mic showing in the shot or something

40
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,480
Anyway after thinking about this sin for about four seconds

41
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,080
I realized I was gonna have to make another CinemaSins video, but then I thought

42
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,780
Skipping all the way to the present day

43
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,960
Wouldn't really be right would it?

44
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:34,220
CinemaSins have put out over a hundred videos in the past year and I bet they've made some really gratuitous mistakes in those

45
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:41,560
So that's what we're gonna do today pick up where we left off with CinemaSins and catalog just a portion of everything

46
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,440
They've got wrong in the past year

47
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:50,980
Let's show them how to nitpick properly and let's start off with a sin from their video on the movie 10 Cloverfield Lane

48
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,860
You're the only one small enough to reach it. It's what the filtration system

49
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:00,180
This guy is the king of over preparedness for disasters and did not know this girl or anyone other than him would be down here

50
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,060
When he built this shelter, but still made the air filtration system accessible to only people one-fifth his size

51
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:12,580
So why would John Goodman's character build an air filtration system that he was unable to access what a buffoon he is

52
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,040
But let's take a peek at the movie real quick

53
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,780
Your filtration system

54
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,780
Ah

55
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,820
You see he could reach it but something was blocking the hatch and why would something be blocking the hatch

56
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,460
well a minute earlier in the movie a

57
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:42,040
Then unknown force caused the bunker to shake and that damaged the air filtration system and blocked the hatch to it

58
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:49,560
Also here when CinemaSins say that John Goodman's character Howard didn't know that anyone else would be down here with him

59
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:55,300
And that's not true either as there are various clues in the bunker pointing to the fact that Howard had

60
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,280
Previously kept someone else there such as the word help scratched into the glass on the inside of the exit hatch

61
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,200
I also like this sin from later in the video where CinemaSins call a Molotov cocktail a

62
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,660
makeshift Molotov cocktail, you know as

63
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,340
Opposed to the official line of Molotov cocktails that you'd buy in the store

64
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:22,940
I guess in their video for the rock CinemaSins call these helicopters Blackhawk helicopters

65
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:29,500
But they're not this is a Blackhawk helicopter, which as you can see doesn't really look anything like what they showed

66
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,900
You know beyond being a helicopter

67
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,100
Let's take a look at a sin from Star Trek 3 the search for Spock

68
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:43,940
There are your life forms these were microbes on the tube surface microbes by their very definition are microscopic living organisms

69
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,460
I hate to be nitpicky, but these seem way more visible without a microscope than usual

70
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,740
Well, I love to be nitpicky and the line was they were

71
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:58,220
Microbes in the past tense implying that they are no longer microbes and indeed if we look at the movie

72
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,620
These were microbes on the tube surface. We shot them here from Enterprise

73
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:15,140
Let's take a look at a sin from their video for the movie The Bourne Supremacy now from near the end of the movie

74
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,200
Somehow with all these witnesses Bourne still escapes into the ether after this

75
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,960
So a lot of witnesses saw Bourne after his car crash in the tunnel

76
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:27,380
So how did he possibly escape and you might be wondering well, what's wrong with this?

77
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:33,940
Well, let's now watch us in from the start of their video for the next movie in the series The Bourne Ultimatum

78
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,740
Which continues the story after this car crash?

79
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,940
So the Moscow police are coming after Bourne because of that tunnel chase scene from the last movie

80
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,860
How the fuck did Bourne get spotted in the first place?

81
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,300
And how is he identified by anyone in that dark ass tunnel and that's unbelievable, isn't it?

82
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,820
How did Bourne get away with all these witnesses there and then the next movie?

83
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,420
How did any of those witnesses see Bourne in that dark tunnel?

84
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,020
Shameful

85
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,500
These videos came out only two days apart, by the way

86
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,540
Similar to that. Let's look at a sin from their video about Ghost in the Shell

87
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,340
Earlier we saw that the major is heavy and dense enough to bend a metal roof tile

88
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,580
But here she's buoyant enough to float on water instead of sinking like a rock

89
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,960
So how can the major float when she's so heavy?

90
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,700
Well

91
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:20,700
The shot CinemaSins used is taken from the end of the diving scene after we've already seen the

92
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,900
flotation device on the majors back carry her to the surface

93
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:29,780
CinemaSins neglect to show that obviously what they also don't mention here is the following

94
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:35,740
conversation on the boat where Batou talks to the major about how dangerous it is for cyborgs to go swimming and

95
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:41,360
Specifically mentions the majors flotation equipment, you know, how did CinemaSins miss this scene?

96
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:48,720
Well, it turns out they didn't major is swimming in this scene much like she does in the original only the original brings up

97
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,720
How dangerous it is for cybernetic humans to go deep in the water like this because you know

98
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,840
They're made of heavy machinery, but this movie doesn't mention it once since this scenes compress so much

99
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,840
It feels like it's in gif format. So

100
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,440
CinemaSins did see that scene

101
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:07,460
They must have in order to use it to criticize the live-action remake and that's pretty shady, isn't it?

102
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:14,720
This just confirms my suspicions that CinemaSins write their scripts while watching the movie for the first time and don't go back to do

103
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,900
Any editing when the movie provides them with additional information that proves them wrong at the start of their video for Citizen Kane?

104
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,300
Citizen Kane

105
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,300
They call these gondolas

106
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,420
Viking canoes and then go on to say this

107
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:34,900
rich guys castle has a drivable par-4 on hole 16 just so he can feel good about himself toward the end of the round a

108
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,340
drivable par-4 at

109
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,420
365 yards

110
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,200
Well that seemed a little off to me

111
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:48,420
So I went to check and found a page on golf week.com that lists the average PGA Tour driving distances for recent years

112
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:56,180
And they have never averaged over 300 yards and they're professional golfers. So is this a drivable par-4?

113
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,380
Well, maybe for about 30 people on the planet

114
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:06,780
But that's it and I'd like to thank CinemaSins for getting two obvious things wrong in the first minute of their video about Citizen Kane

115
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:13,980
So that I didn't have to force myself to watch the rest of it from Citizen Kane to the Lego Batman movie now

116
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,500
This is where the movie loses me and starts to just be noise

117
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:23,900
tossing in the Wicked Witch from Wizard of Oz Sauron Bremlins agents from the matrix King Kong Voldemort Daleks Daleks

118
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,880
Daleks

119
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,060
What's that? Oh, it's a day look isn't it?

120
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,900
incredible

121
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:39,100
In their video about blade they criticized the distance between the bite marks of the quotes vampire incisors

122
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:45,420
But vampires are usually depicted not with sharp incisors, but with sharp canines as indeed

123
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,780
They are in blade

124
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:53,140
That's a canine right there in their video for the jungle book remake CinemaSins call Shere Khan a quote

125
00:09:53,580 --> 00:10:01,640
African tiger, which is odd both because the jungle book is set in India and African tigers don't exist

126
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:08,280
CinemaSins still don't know too much about animals. I see let's do a few more animal examples here

127
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:14,800
Starting with their video for Saw 2 where they say that this person is wearing a horse mask

128
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,600
That's a horse snout there. I guess and in their video for Pocahontas

129
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,920
They call this raccoon a rodent but raccoons aren't rodents in finding Dory

130
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,880
They think that the octopus characters camouflage automatically blends in with the background

131
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,240
But this is not the case in

132
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:41,200
Reality the mimic octopus for example is able to control its camouflage ability at will not only to blend in with its surroundings

133
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,480
But also to mimic other animals and in their video for the movie split they call these mice

134
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:55,480
Gerbils so where does one learn about animals because CinemaSins need to go and be there in their video for

135
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,160
Shrek they say that the DreamWorks logo has two letter E's in it

136
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,300
And I'm not too sure about this to be honest

137
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:10,160
I mean I I see the first one sure between the R and the a there and with them on that but after that

138
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,540
I'm lost I'm afraid in how to train your dragon to they refer to a character called Doba

139
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,000
However, there isn't a character called Doba in this movie

140
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,240
There's a character called gober, so I'd guess they meant him is probably a safe bet

141
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,800
Similar to that in Jack Reacher they refer to a character named Stacy

142
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,080
However, there is no character called Stacy in Jack Reacher

143
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,520
Who is Stacy CinemaSins? I have no idea

144
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:45,240
Watch the following sin from Captain America Civil War. What was her name again?

145
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,800
The Loras you called her Doc. Steve remembers the name of some random redhead buck

146
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:56,040
He tried to impress more than 70 years ago. How can Captain America remember things that happened 70 years ago?

147
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:56,960
well

148
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,960
If you remember CinemaSins

149
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:05,560
Captain America fell into a coma sometime in the Second World War and woke up in the present day so for him

150
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,720
Consciously, it's a relatively recent event

151
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,160
Let's do another superhero one this from early in their video for Batman vs Superman

152
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:19,760
Dawn of Justice all it takes to get the most precious element on earth is a couple of free divers with a motorboat and a

153
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,400
Dream is it ever explained how this Kryptonian vessel full of kryptonite crash-landed in the Indian fucking ocean

154
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:30,920
So that's some people finding kryptonite in the Indian Ocean there, that's odd, isn't it? Where did that come from?

155
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:36,240
Well, if you recall CinemaSins, there was a movie called Man of Steel

156
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,240
Which I know you've seen because you did a video about it in which the plan of the antagonist in that movie was to

157
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,900
Terraform the earth into a new Krypton using a large terraforming machine

158
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,120
Located above the Indian Ocean and that's how the kryptonite got there

159
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:59,560
It was the big kryptonian terraforming machine from the previous movie in the series and there's even an establishing shot of it earlier in the movie

160
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,060
And CinemaSins used that in their video

161
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:08,880
Look at this following nonsense from their video about Gone Girl the morning of what the morning of what? Yeah

162
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,040
Yeah, we know it means this is the morning of her disappearance, but won't her disappearance. Tell us that the morning of what?

163
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,080
the morning of July 5th

164
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,120
It says it right there on the screen

165
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,960
Next movie, let's do The Conjuring 2

166
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,680
So, okay at the start of this movie a character relives the events of November 13th

167
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,440
1974 when Ronald DeFeo jr. Shot and killed six members of his family in Amityville

168
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,760
CinemaSins criticized the movie for showing the family sleeping through the gunshots

169
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,480
But this is actually faithful to the account of the case

170
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,640
Police were puzzled by the fact that nobody appeared to have gotten out of bed to investigate the gunshots

171
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,500
As all the victims were found face down in bed, so plus one to the movie for accuracy

172
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,400
I guess but that's not what I want to talk about here

173
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:03,720
I want to talk about this in movie proves Vera Farmiga has a way better imaginary dream shotgun than you do a dream

174
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,400
Shotgun. Hey, well, you see the murders were actually carried out with a lever action rifle

175
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,800
Not a shotgun and is that unfair of me, you know criticizing CinemaSins for not recognizing an invisible gun

176
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,540
Well, no because later in that scene the character

177
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,680
Experiencing the vision walks in front of a mirror and the rifle is briefly visible

178
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,240
and I know CinemaSins saw it because they featured it in a sin, so

179
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:37,800
Near in their video about I am legend CinemaSins say the following the viral zombie apocalypse somehow

180
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,040
Destroyed two-thirds of all the most famous bridges in New York. The bridges were destroyed

181
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,440
Somehow I wonder how any ideas movie

182
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:54,800
...

183
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,600
That's right, the military destroyed the bridges. How did CinemaSins miss that?

184
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:06,240
Well, they give the movie a sin for having the broken bridges at about 25 minutes into the movie and the bridges aren't shown

185
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,720
Being blown up until a flashback that happens over 30 minutes later

186
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,760
CinemaSins just didn't go back to edit the bridge sin out when they were shown to be wrong

187
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:21,120
Because they're lazy and their videos are bad. This next sin is from their video for the movie Krampus

188
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,080
Back when Howard handed Tom this gun

189
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:28,160
He didn't give him any more ammo and when Howard got attacked by the gopher from Caddyshack Tom fired off two rounds

190
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,040
So where the hell did these extra rounds come from?

191
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:37,480
Well, that's because revolvers don't auto-eject casings. The cylinder would still look like that even with all of the shots fired

192
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,500
You'd have to eject the casings manually. Now, here's an annoying one from their video for John Wick

193
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:50,840
Every umbrella at a funeral is black cliche and this is something they're repeating their video for Justice League

194
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,700
Flashpoint Paradox. Now depicting umbrellas at a funeral being black isn't a cliche

195
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:02,780
It's an accurate representation of a behavior that actually happens in reality and this worries me a little

196
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:06,720
it makes me think the CinemaSins guys have been turning up to funerals with like

197
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,220
This and not understanding that that is generally considered inappropriate

198
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:20,040
Anyway, let's move on. Now CinemaSins have previously taken some heat for their assertion that there is no gravity in space

199
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:25,100
And in their video about the animated Transformers movie, they repeat that mistake

200
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,400
Sarcastically saying this is how gravity works in space kids

201
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:35,520
When the character Unicron drops another character into their mouth. The thing here though

202
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,820
Is that Unicron is the size of a planet?

203
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,400
So that's exactly how gravity quote

204
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:47,660
Works because if the character has the mass of a planet then it will attract other objects of mass in the same manner as a

205
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,660
planet

206
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,160
CinemaSins seem to think there's some sort of difference

207
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:58,900
Gravitationally speaking between being quote in space and the inferred opposite state not in space

208
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,460
Whatever that means but no we're in space now

209
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:07,960
CinemaSins all the time as far as gravity is concerned. Anyway, the earth doesn't like

210
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,720
Generate gravity for us or something

211
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,940
These guys need to go and read their Albert Einstein

212
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:20,420
Kind of Logan to carry professor X to his bed for some rest and I'd be calling by this imagery if he wasn't also leaving

213
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,480
The wheelchair so far away from the bed is to render Charles immobile until further human assistance arrives

214
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:31,320
So why would Logan leave the chair so far from the bed instead of moving it closer? That's rather mean, isn't it?

215
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,040
Anything to say for yourself movie?

216
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:42,520
Forces forces glad you're not in that business anymore. They don't want me. They want you. Oh

217
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,120
Look at that

218
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:51,260
He does move it closer and you can even see it closer to the bed in the CinemaSins video a few sins later

219
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:57,400
Shameful stuff there their video about the movie in time is quite droll

220
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:05,400
The second sin in that video is complaining about how the movie never explains its premise and the third sin in that video is complaining

221
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,720
about the movie

222
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,480
Overexplaining itself fire an expositional monologue that gives away the conceit now the conceit of that movie by the way

223
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,040
It's that people stop aging at 25 and then use remaining lifetime as a currency

224
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:23,080
So you have poor people with only a few hours on the clock and rich people with hundreds of years, you know

225
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:28,540
You get it. Now. I mention it here because CinemaSins later give the movie a sin for the characters being

226
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,320
motivated by currency and

227
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,040
Yes, I'd imagine the ticking death clocks they have in their arms that will kill them when they run out of time would be

228
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:44,000
Pretty big motivators actually in their video for the movie the purge election year

229
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:51,640
CinemaSins are surprised to see somebody stab through a bulletproof vest and this is a mistake. They repeat in their video for the rock

230
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,960
Now the thing about bulletproof vests is they're bulletproof

231
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:04,320
What you'd wear to protect against knives is a stab proof vest and they're different things designed and constructed in different ways for different

232
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,040
purposes

233
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,880
Bulletproof vests are built to disperse the kinetic energy of a projectile

234
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:15,800
Throughout the material and aren't really built to stop something sharp and pointed that can pierce through the material

235
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,660
The more, you know, hey in their video for I robot

236
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:25,800
they think that the characters are driving a hover car and give the movie a sin when they hear the wheels screech on the ground and

237
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,980
But it's actually a prototype car with spherical wheels and not a hover car their video for the movie

238
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,160
Moana is pretty offensive at several points

239
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,760
CinemaSins refusal to do any research or look anything up comes off really badly

240
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:45,680
When they're watching a movie based on the mythology and culture of a people at CinemaSins have no idea about

241
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,080
For example, they give the movie a sin for featuring a fish hook constellation

242
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,080
Which they call fictional but in reality is an actual Polynesian constellation

243
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,580
Better recognized in the West as the tail of the constellation Scorpio

244
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,880
They also give the movie a sin for featuring this thing which is a Polynesian slit drum

245
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,160
Which CinemaSins say looks nothing like a drum

246
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,220
Apparently they were expecting one of these in the ancient cave or something

247
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,720
Watch the following sin from their video about the movie battle Los Angeles

248
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,560
First off can you be a little more specific wouldn't you want to know the exact time left before the rescue helicopter arrives?

249
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,160
Also ten minutes ago random marine number four yelled

250
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:36,800
So I'd synchronize those swatches if I were you now the mistake CinemaSins made there was that the soldier was actually shouting

251
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,840
25 meters not 25 minutes to indicate distance and not time

252
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:48,700
So that explains that supposed discrepancy there in their video for now you see me too. They make a rather funny mistake

253
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,920
This is what we've been waiting for now

254
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:56,800
It's time to get the work since when do the world's best magicians blindly sign up to be basically MacGyver going after wrongdoers and corporate

255
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,620
Stooges also

256
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:02,520
Why are they all shining their flashlights on these blueprints in the shot as though flashlight activated blueprints are an actual thing?

257
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,780
You see those aren't flashlights. They're black lights

258
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,120
They're revealing something that was drawn in ink that only shows up under a black light

259
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,840
There's also this sin from later in the movie. This is my twin brother chase

260
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,900
What the actual movie also character has a twin brother or any kind of sibling that they never mentioned before?

261
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,480
So has that character's brother never been mentioned before?

262
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,400
Well about half an hour into the previous movie in that series

263
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:33,680
This is said two TV specials slowly days then your brother slash manager disappeared with all your hard-earned money

264
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,680
Did you research?

265
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,840
So that character's brother was mentioned before hardy-ha

266
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:46,280
Similar to this sin is the following one from their video about home alone. Why do the McAllisters have a doggy door?

267
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,840
There's no mention of a dog or cat throughout this entire movie

268
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:54,720
Is it sole purpose shooting bad guys in the crotch with bb's no mention of a dog throughout the entire movie?

269
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,520
However two minutes into the movie this happens

270
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,200
Let's do another similar one from the movie trolls

271
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,900
I'll just get my worthless scullery made to get another place setting ready for the lovely lady

272
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,520
glitter sparkles

273
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,720
Crystal only introduced Bridget as his plus one

274
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,500
So the only way chef could know her name is if the screenwriters were committed to seeing Christine Baranski chew the hell out of this

275
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,540
So, how did this character know this character's name when they weren't introduced

276
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:32,540
Well ten seconds previously in the movie this happens meet the lovely lady glitter sparkles

277
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:39,400
So what happened to their cinema sins was it so hard to find things to criticize about

278
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:45,320
Trolls that you had to lie about something that just happened in the movie. I don't know

279
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,800
Take the gloves off sugar Ray that's like a 30 year old boxing reference at this point

280
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,400
This is movie taking place in the 70s

281
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,200
Or is it just a dated boxing reference worst thing is the movie will never answer this question

282
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,880
So what time period is the nutjob set?

283
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,320
Apparently the movie never answers this question

284
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:09,780
Well, we as viewers can infer the general time period of the movie from several contextual clues

285
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:15,100
For example the opening of the movie shows these old-fashioned cars driving on the roads

286
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,580
And there's this guy wearing suspenders and a flat cap

287
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:26,540
There's this 50s mobster looking guy sitting on a bench this newspaper that displays the date as October 21st

288
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:34,020
1959 and combined from all these contextual hints. I'm able to estimate the general date that the movie set as

289
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,540
October 21st

290
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,740
1959 the movie will never answer this question

291
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:48,020
My foot cinema sins were confused there by the sugar Ray reference probably mistaking it to mean sugar Ray Leonard

292
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:54,200
Who was only three years old in 1959 and thus probably not yet a well-known boxer

293
00:23:54,580 --> 00:24:00,820
More likely though the characters were referencing sugar Ray Robinson who was a boxer active throughout the 1950s

294
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:07,060
Some more time period shenanigans now first from their video about Pirates of the Caribbean on

295
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:12,420
Stranger Tides which cinema sins say takes place in the late 17th century

296
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:17,620
The movie is actually set in 1750 which isn't in the 17th century

297
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,900
Just trust me

298
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:26,780
And I've got no clue where cinema sins got the late part from I think that was just a random guess really in their video

299
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,820
For the movie King Arthur they refer to a medieval battle happening

300
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:36,220
even though the movies set during the late Roman occupation of Britain making medieval an

301
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:41,460
Incorrect descriptor there. They also elsewhere refer to England's army

302
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:48,580
Even though England didn't even exist at that point and watch the following sin from their video about Alice through the looking-glass

303
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:55,160
In Hollywood doctors do not squirt out part of the medicine to fucking test if a syringe is working how you ever got started on

304
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,200
This troop I will never know but not get the off rather

305
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:06,040
Angry about syringes that so yes doctors don't squirt out a bit of the medicine in order to test if the syringe is working

306
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:11,000
But they do squirt out a bit of the medicine to ensure there are no air bubbles in the syringe

307
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,240
Injecting air into someone can be very dangerous

308
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:20,400
So what they do is tap the syringe a few times and then squirt a bit out to force any air out of the syringe

309
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,840
before use

310
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,800
Isn't learning fun watch the following sin from Fantastic Beasts and where to find them

311
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,600
Legilimens yeah, but I always have trouble with your kind Brits

312
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,440
That's British also

313
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:39,520
Legilimens is someone who can read minds someone that was never once introduced in the entire world of Harry Potter before now

314
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:45,680
So this Legilimens thing is something that was never introduced in the entire world of Harry Potter

315
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,760
Well that's not true because it's in the books for a start

316
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:55,640
But maybe CinemaSins just meant the movies and so has it been mentioned in the movies before

317
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,020
Well if we watch Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

318
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:12,320
That's right Snape says it let's take a look at a sin from their video about the movie Central Intelligence

319
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,360
It's 6 p.m.. And they're in the Eastern time zone

320
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,680
So there's no way there's a football game on unless this bar is showing reruns because the NFL never plays games that start at 6 p.m.

321
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,800
Eastern

322
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:28,480
Okay, so there's a lot wrong with this and so the NFL never plays games that start at 6 p.m.. Eastern

323
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:34,000
Well the first problem here is that there's nothing in the movie to indicate that this game has just started

324
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,360
It could be a game that started earlier

325
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:41,120
And is still playing at the next problem here is if we do a little zoom and enhance

326
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,180
We can make out the team logo on the field which is this

327
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:52,280
The Tiger Eye logo of the team the LSU Tigers which is a college team and thus wouldn't be playing in an NFL game anyway

328
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:59,080
So this sin is wrong twice in two completely different ways well done CinemaSins in their video for the movie

329
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:05,280
Don't Breathe they tried a character for urinating at a crime scene for leaving his DNA there

330
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:11,720
Although actually urine doesn't contain DNA that's a fun biology factor for you there

331
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,480
in their video for Toy Story 3

332
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,400
They spell the character Sid's name wrong and refer to him as a serial killer

333
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:26,080
And not noticing that Sid is actually featured in the movie as a garbage man also from this movie is the following sin

334
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:33,840
Then why did you take it out in the first place also didn't previous movie show us your organs still work even when not attached

335
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,920
So why not just look through that eye to figure out where it is, right?

336
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,940
Yeah, why didn't she just look through the eye to find where it was that I'd be clever wouldn't it oh wait

337
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:48,900
She does do that in blade 2 they incorrectly refers to the mutated vampires as

338
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:55,960
Creepers when they're actually called Reapers in the ring too. They think the town the characters move to Astoria

339
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,160
It's in Washington and when it's actually in Oregon in

340
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:04,160
Ghostbusters they refer to this thing as a bicycle, but it isn't

341
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,520
In Hellboy they're confused when a character pulls the pins on two grenades

342
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,840
But throws them one at a time and not understanding how grenades work

343
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:20,640
I guess pulling the pin doesn't actually do anything by itself the pin is just there to hold the strike lever in place

344
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,920
It's releasing this lever that causes the grenade to explode after a short delay

345
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:30,400
You can actually put the pin back in a grenade safely assuming the leaf has been held down the whole time

346
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,040
Although I'd advise against trying it in that video for unbreakable

347
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,920
They give the movie a sin for having train seats that face backwards as well as forwards

348
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:46,180
I don't know. Why is that an unusual thing in the States like over here pretty much all the trains

349
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:53,600
I like that in their video for suicide squad they claim the character dr. Moon explored a cave featured earlier by herself

350
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,420
But if you watch the movie you can see someone else with her in that flashback implying there were other people with her on the

351
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:07,880
Trip unless that person is just someone she bumped into in passing in the middle of a jungle which while possible would be kind of weird

352
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
In the original planet of the Apes

353
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:17,300
There's a scene where the Apes flush some humans out of a cornfield using sticks and when cinema sins watch it

354
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,560
They think the Apes are cutting the corn down

355
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,080
With blunt sticks

356
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,040
Above course, they're not they're just flushing people out

357
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,140
I mean you can obviously see they're not cutting down the corn

358
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:33,000
So I haven't got a clue what cinema sins were on about here in their video for the movie contact

359
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,200
They mock the appearance of this nebula, but that's actually a real nebula. It's called the pillars of creation

360
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:44,480
They also say that the moon is quote nowhere near that size relative to the earth

361
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,720
But without a reference for where the camera is located here

362
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,040
That's a silly statement

363
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,800
After all, if you're very close to the moon, it would appear larger than the earth

364
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:59,200
You'd need to know exactly where the camera was located in order to make that judgment

365
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,680
Let's watch a sin from their video about the movie kung fu panda free

366
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:10,460
If no one could find you pink on the down I've got this but yeah, he's right

367
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,600
So let's watch the clip from the movie to give us a little bit more context here

368
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,400
Wow

369
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:25,320
But how did you know where I was I received a message that led me here

370
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:32,040
How could you receive a message if no one could find you sounds suspicious to me. So, okay

371
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:40,440
How did pose biological father get a message telling him where Poe was if he lives in a secret village any ideas movie?

372
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,160
No, it was a message from the universe

373
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,680
That's grown

374
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:56,440
As I hope you would when I sent the message to your father, huh, you sent the universe mail, whoa

375
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,560
Yes

376
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:05,600
But again, that's a reveal from the end of the movie and cinema sins couldn't be bothered going back to correct their earlier mistake

377
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,940
Let's watch a sin from their video about the

378
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:15,200
2017 live-action remake of beauty and the Beast since this movie suffers from the exact issue about the castle being in plain sight

379
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,640
I'll just repeat the same sin

380
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,600
I gave the last movie the Beast has only been secretly beasting for 10 years

381
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,120
But Maurice is somehow unaware of this very nearby castle

382
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:27,200
Also, it's super weird that the villagers wouldn't be at all disturbed that the prince of the very nearby castle hasn't been seen or heard

383
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:33,200
From in years and even if this prince is habitually reclusive you'd think that someone would know one of the 300 live-in servants and wonder

384
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,920
Where they are, right, right?

385
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:40,840
No, I wouldn't think that was weird because I watched the movie as days bled into years

386
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,200
The prince and his servants were forgotten by the world

387
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,660
For the Enchantress had erased all memory of them from the minds of the people they loved

388
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:55,800
Now that clip occurs during the opening narration. So how did cinema sins missed that?

389
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:02,400
Well, check this out for the Enchantress had erased all memory of them from the minds of the people they loved

390
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,580
That's an excellent attempt to close a plot hole opened by the animated movie

391
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:10,620
But it leaves me with a whole new set of questions. Yeah, that's right. They gave it a sin

392
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,060
So what happened here then?

393
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:19,940
You know at some point between writing this sin and the one from later in the video cinema sins somehow forgot the details of the

394
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,500
Opening narration that they watched, you know

395
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:28,140
That or these videos are a collaborative effort written by several people who don't talk to each other or something

396
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,340
Let's watch a sin from their video about Star Wars the Clone Wars

397
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:39,540
Crime Lord Jabba the Hudson has been kidnapped by a rival band of pirates. Excuse me. What his son

398
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,340
Are you serious funny? We're only hearing about this guy just now

399
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:51,140
This warlord reaches out to the federal government to help him find his captured son instead of simply taking matters into his own hands and

400
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,540
Sending a bunch of bounty hunters to do it

401
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:59,480
So why didn't Jabba the Hutt hire some bounty hunters to find his son that seems like the sort of thing he'd do, right?

402
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,460
Well 15 minutes into the movie this happens. Yes commander

403
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,560
We've discovered that Jabba the Hutt has also hired bounty hunters to track down his son

404
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:15,980
It turns out Jabba did hire some bounty hunters cinema sins just lied about it in their video for the movie sing

405
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:22,180
They wonder if the shrimp act need a handler to push their tank around but later when they're dismissed from the show

406
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:27,300
We see that they do in fact have a handler with them in their video for Star Trek Beyond

407
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:33,560
They give the movie a sin because the alien planet has air that humans can breathe. What a coincidence, eh?

408
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,300
What they missed was this scene 18 minutes into the movie

409
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,880
approaching ultimate

410
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,680
Class M planet now an M class planet

411
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:48,460
There is the Star Trek universe's designation for a planet suitable for human life

412
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:53,340
And now you might say well that's still an unlikely narrative convenience, isn't it?

413
00:33:53,340 --> 00:34:00,680
Even if they did establish it earlier in the story and you would nearly be right except for the fact that the antagonist is later

414
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:07,260
Revealed to actually be a human Starfleet captain played by Idris Elba who crash-landed on that planet long ago

415
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:07,800
and

416
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:13,600
Thus the planet would have to be able to support human life or he would have died when he crashed and none of the events

417
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,500
Of the film would have taken place

418
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:20,800
So there now do you want to see possibly the worst cinema sin I have ever encountered

419
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,120
This really gets me this one from their video about the movie too fast too furious

420
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:32,100
If slapjack is only going over 100 then seconds later Brian hits the nos and is blasting past 160

421
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:36,500
How is slapjack not eating Brian's dust, right? So this is

422
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,280
annoying

423
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,220
So the characters slapjack and Brian are engaged in some sort of illegal

424
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,640
Street race and though both cars appear to be going at a similar speed

425
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:54,500
When we see close-ups of their speedometer as we see that Brian is doing 160

426
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,540
Whereas slapjack is doing about a hundred

427
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:04,500
What a silly movie mistake you might think if you were some sort of utter

428
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:10,320
Buffoon who had never seen a car you see Brian's speedometer is in kilometers per hour

429
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,140
That's why it says 160

430
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:20,860
Slapjack's speedometer on the other hand is primarily in miles per hour. So it shows him doing 100. But what are these other?

431
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,620
Smaller numbers in red on the inside there

432
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:29,780
Well, that's the speed of slapjacks car in kilometers per hour. And would you look at that?

433
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:37,180
He's doing about 160 which is how fast Brian is going and that's why the cars appear to be going the same

434
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,060
goddamn speed

435
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:47,420
At cinema sins don't seem to have much of a clue when it comes to cars in their video for the movie

436
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:53,060
Jason Bourne, they incorrectly identify this Dodge Charger as a Dodge Challenger

437
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:57,980
And in their video for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles out of the shadows

438
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,560
They jokingly expect this SRT to turn into bumblebee

439
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,820
Except of course, we all know that bumblebee is a Camaro

440
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,860
Let's take a look at a sin from their video about the movie angry birds

441
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:12,420
movie has mine birds because it's super funny and you just didn't realize it

442
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:18,780
Is going on here is he in school and if so, why is he hireable as a clown? Why is he painting?

443
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,740
Why was there a mime hanging out a second ago? Where the fuck is this village?

444
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:25,820
This is the one time I'd welcome a little fucking narration. So what's going on here then?

445
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:33,540
Well, this section of the movie is actually a montage of various scenes from the main characters life showing situations in which he's been

446
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:38,500
Angry, I guess and this particular scene is a flashback to his time in school

447
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,940
I mean, here's how he looked just five seconds ago

448
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:47,340
and then it cuts to him in school and he looks like this a little kid version of himself and

449
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:54,620
I guess the filmmakers trusted in the ability of their audience to recognize a series of flashbacks and not try to

450
00:36:54,780 --> 00:37:00,600
Interpret it as a linear narrative in which the character rapidly changes age appearance and location

451
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:07,500
But I guess they didn't account for the cinema sins guys who need to be led by the hand through absolutely everything

452
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,820
Let's watch the first few sins from their video about the movie

453
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:17,660
Warcraft there has been a war between orcs and humans for as long as can be remembered or as long as it's been since Tolkien

454
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,820
Created the orcs were blatantly stealing for this game movie also narration

455
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:24,620
But there was once a time when we did not even know who our enemy was

456
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:27,940
We just said you've been fighting with humans as long as you can remember

457
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:32,420
So, how do you remember the time before that when you didn't even know your enemy but in the beginning?

458
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:38,420
How could we have known know what you've given me three statements so far two about knowing one about wondering how you could have known

459
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,460
And already I think I see the problem with this movie

460
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,020
Okay

461
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,860
So there's a few problems here

462
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:47,820
Firstly the orc voiceover says we've been fighting humans as long as we can remember

463
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:54,620
But there was once a time when we did not know who our enemy was now, that's not actually a contradiction

464
00:37:55,580 --> 00:38:01,380
Knowledge of the existence of a time before your memory begins does not mean you personally remember it

465
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,300
Just that you know about it for example

466
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:10,220
I have knowledge of the existence of ancient Rome, but that doesn't mean I personally remember it does it?

467
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:17,020
Secondly here where cinema sins say known what you've given me three statements so far etc

468
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:22,940
That's not true cinema sins cut a line out of the opening narration here

469
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:28,040
Let's have a listen, but there was once a time when we did not even know who our enemy was

470
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:43,940
So the following line, but in the beginning how could we have known is referring to this previous line about what the green fell magic did to them

471
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:49,860
Cinema sins just cut that line out to make the narration seem worse than it actually is I mean

472
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:55,240
It's still pretty bad, so I don't know why cinema sins bothered to misrepresent it really

473
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,240
But they did in the Lego movie

474
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,760
They point out this Lego bike and say the minifigures couldn't ride it because it only has one stud at the back

475
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:09,680
But actually they can ride those they stand over the middle. That's not a seat back there

476
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:16,800
That's just a rear wheel guard in Die Hard 2. There's the following sin recalibrate sea level recalibrate sea level

477
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,560
Don't the planes have independent meters and gauges that are not reliant upon control towers to determine how far they are up in the air

478
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:30,080
No, actually one of the purposes of the control tower is to transmit to the planes a code based on atmospheric pressure

479
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:36,760
That the planes need to calculate their altitude above sea level not all planes can do that independently

480
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,880
Here's a fun one next it

481
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,120
Do you know how cinema sins like to do this in case you confused it for Bruce go, Kentucky?

482
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:49,000
You know hardy ha we obviously know the country who would need to be told what country we were in

483
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,620
You know certainly not us at cinema sins

484
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:59,260
Well, that's in there is from their video about x-men apocalypse, and now here's a sin from later in the video

485
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:08,360
Because someone decided to wake up apocalypse right now an earthquake in Egypt was felt all the way to Germany they think they're in Germany

486
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:13,880
Even with the word Poland appearing on the screen in the movie. They still got the country wrong

487
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:21,320
They also think that Andalusia is a city in Spain instead of a region in Spain and they confuse Goa India with the non-existent

488
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:29,200
Gao India, so we'll just add geography to the list of things cinema sins doesn't understand alongside animals

489
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,960
history cars guns

490
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:39,200
Movies and whatever else oh this video is getting on a bit isn't it and let's double time a few minor errors here

491
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:46,120
In peach dragon they type 3 minutes and 15 minutes instead of 3 minutes and 15 seconds

492
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,980
They here type spirit instead of spirit

493
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:54,400
They forget the space between in and 15 in the title of their video for the boss, baby

494
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:58,780
They leave out the word to in this sentence from there the mummy returns video

495
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,860
everything wrong with Deadpool in 16 minutes

496
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:07,100
Everything wrong with Deadpool in 15 minutes in the secret life of pets

497
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:11,840
They use the wrong ending template for the video the one from their music sins channel a mistake

498
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,880
They repeat several times in other videos before correcting it

499
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:20,320
I mean I could keep going this video contains just a portion of the mistakes

500
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:26,880
I found watching through cinema sins offerings from the past year. I've got 10 a4 pages filled with this

501
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,080
Both sides this video could have been three times as long

502
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:35,360
Easily, but I think I should probably arbitrarily stop here

503
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,880
So what have we learned today?

504
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:44,480
Well, nothing new the cinema sin still hasn't improved at all if anything they've gotten worse

505
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:52,600
And they're still incapable of following along with even the simplest stories unless they're held by the hand the whole time with on-screen text and narration

506
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,800
Which they'll then complain about anyway, and then probably forget

507
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,000
They'll still lie about and misrepresent the content of movies in order to provide their audience with an unearned smug feeling of superiority

508
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,280
Over something and they still don't know anything

509
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:13,080
At all about anything and the worst of all they're not funny

510
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:20,840
The cinema sins YouTube channel is probably the only human creation to which I would deny the title art

511
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:25,960
Thanks a lot for watching everyone if you'd like to see more videos like this

512
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:34,320
Well, don't support me on on patreon. I'm not gonna be making more videos like this. I mean once a year max

513
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:41,840
Every cinema sins video is a Gordian knot of wrongness and untangling it costs a part of your soul

514
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,700
Thanks to all my patrons anyway, I mean I couldn't continue to do this without them

515
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,040
So I should probably be blaming them here rather than thanking them thinking about it

516
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,720
How dare you support me?

517
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,720
Honestly, I take it as an insult. I'm supported in this

518
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:08,080
Anyway see you next year, I guess and we'll look at everything they got wrong between now and then bye
