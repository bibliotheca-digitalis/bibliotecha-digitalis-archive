00:00.000 --> 00:03.400
Hello everyone, so as you may be aware a while back

00:03.400 --> 00:08.240
I made a few videos about the YouTube channel CinemaSins laying out various mistakes

00:08.240 --> 00:15.840
They've made and criticizing their general approach to movie criticism. A response to those videos has been uniformly positive

00:16.520 --> 00:23.040
YouTube users are still leaving me plenty of supportive messages on those videos. For example, Patrick Harris says

00:23.380 --> 00:26.480
Thanks for the video. Like many CinemaSins viewers

00:26.480 --> 00:31.720
I had previously not understood the word satire, but after watching your videos

00:31.720 --> 00:38.140
I now realize that I was using it incorrectly and CinemaSins is not in fact satirical.

00:38.360 --> 00:40.760
Another commenter says keep up the good work

00:40.760 --> 00:48.440
I can't believe CinemaSins conditioned me into laughing at their repetitive unfunny jokes. A humorous intent is no defense

00:48.440 --> 00:53.080
if the joke unfairly denigrates other people's hard work through deception and

00:53.760 --> 00:55.280
falsehood and

00:55.280 --> 00:57.840
John Doe says oh I get it

00:58.200 --> 01:05.360
CinemaSins watches movies and finds things in them to nitpick and you did the same thing to their videos. That's very clever

01:06.320 --> 01:08.320
Although I'm not a fan of yours

01:08.640 --> 01:16.000
Attaching my ego to a clickbait YouTube channel would be ridiculous and thus I will not get mad at you and leave you a nasty message

01:16.440 --> 01:24.520
Anyway, after making those videos I did the sensible thing and stopped watching CinemaSins entirely for more than a year and it was wonderful

01:24.560 --> 01:29.280
I've never known such peace to be honest. It's been the best year of my life so far

01:31.600 --> 01:32.800
However

01:32.800 --> 01:35.300
Recently a friend linked me to this video

01:36.000 --> 01:43.200
Everything wrong with Blade Runner in 17 minutes or less put out by CinemaSins to coincide with the release of the recent

01:43.440 --> 01:46.320
Blade Runner sequel and I thought oh

01:47.080 --> 01:51.440
Go on then, you know, I can handle just one. It's been a while

01:51.640 --> 01:55.960
Maybe they aren't as bad as I remember. Maybe I was exaggerating back then

01:55.960 --> 01:59.760
So I gave it a watch and I saw this

02:00.600 --> 02:04.820
CinemaSins gave Blade Runner a sin for being quote

02:05.680 --> 02:10.360
Super advanced and super dilapidated all at the same time

02:11.360 --> 02:14.480
You know like it's a mistake. Oh

02:15.400 --> 02:20.720
God I'm even getting mad looking at it right now now Blade Runner is of course a

02:21.240 --> 02:27.520
Cyberpunk film and the juxtaposition of advanced technology and societal problems like inequality

02:27.920 --> 02:34.240
Is by design, you know rather than technology leading to a utopian post scarcity future

02:34.640 --> 02:40.320
Films and other works of art in the sub-genre typically ask what if technology keeps advancing?

02:40.320 --> 02:43.800
But we're unable to solve our various societal problems

02:43.800 --> 02:50.180
You know, what if we still have things like inequality class divides crime police?

02:50.800 --> 02:52.200
Slavery and all that, you know

02:52.200 --> 02:58.480
how will the advance of technology interact with and even possibly exacerbate those problems a

02:58.760 --> 03:03.720
Blade Runner being set in the future that is super advanced and super dilapidated at the same time

03:04.120 --> 03:06.760
It's the whole point a point that is

03:07.160 --> 03:11.880
Completely missed by CinemaSins who give the movie a sin and ding it as if it were a mistake

03:12.240 --> 03:15.240
Akin to the boom mic showing in the shot or something

03:15.460 --> 03:18.480
Anyway after thinking about this sin for about four seconds

03:18.480 --> 03:23.080
I realized I was gonna have to make another CinemaSins video, but then I thought

03:23.780 --> 03:25.780
Skipping all the way to the present day

03:25.960 --> 03:27.960
Wouldn't really be right would it?

03:27.960 --> 03:34.220
CinemaSins have put out over a hundred videos in the past year and I bet they've made some really gratuitous mistakes in those

03:34.660 --> 03:41.560
So that's what we're gonna do today pick up where we left off with CinemaSins and catalog just a portion of everything

03:41.560 --> 03:43.440
They've got wrong in the past year

03:43.440 --> 03:50.980
Let's show them how to nitpick properly and let's start off with a sin from their video on the movie 10 Cloverfield Lane

03:51.100 --> 03:54.860
You're the only one small enough to reach it. It's what the filtration system

03:54.860 --> 04:00.180
This guy is the king of over preparedness for disasters and did not know this girl or anyone other than him would be down here

04:00.180 --> 04:05.060
When he built this shelter, but still made the air filtration system accessible to only people one-fifth his size

04:05.360 --> 04:12.580
So why would John Goodman's character build an air filtration system that he was unable to access what a buffoon he is

04:13.220 --> 04:16.040
But let's take a peek at the movie real quick

04:18.780 --> 04:20.780
Your filtration system

04:20.780 --> 04:22.780
Ah

04:25.840 --> 04:31.820
You see he could reach it but something was blocking the hatch and why would something be blocking the hatch

04:31.860 --> 04:34.460
well a minute earlier in the movie a

04:34.760 --> 04:42.040
Then unknown force caused the bunker to shake and that damaged the air filtration system and blocked the hatch to it

04:42.380 --> 04:49.560
Also here when CinemaSins say that John Goodman's character Howard didn't know that anyone else would be down here with him

04:49.640 --> 04:55.300
And that's not true either as there are various clues in the bunker pointing to the fact that Howard had

04:55.600 --> 05:01.280
Previously kept someone else there such as the word help scratched into the glass on the inside of the exit hatch

05:01.280 --> 05:07.200
I also like this sin from later in the video where CinemaSins call a Molotov cocktail a

05:07.920 --> 05:10.660
makeshift Molotov cocktail, you know as

05:11.280 --> 05:16.340
Opposed to the official line of Molotov cocktails that you'd buy in the store

05:16.340 --> 05:22.940
I guess in their video for the rock CinemaSins call these helicopters Blackhawk helicopters

05:22.940 --> 05:29.500
But they're not this is a Blackhawk helicopter, which as you can see doesn't really look anything like what they showed

05:29.980 --> 05:32.900
You know beyond being a helicopter

05:32.900 --> 05:37.100
Let's take a look at a sin from Star Trek 3 the search for Spock

05:37.100 --> 05:43.940
There are your life forms these were microbes on the tube surface microbes by their very definition are microscopic living organisms

05:43.940 --> 05:47.460
I hate to be nitpicky, but these seem way more visible without a microscope than usual

05:47.820 --> 05:51.740
Well, I love to be nitpicky and the line was they were

05:52.260 --> 05:58.220
Microbes in the past tense implying that they are no longer microbes and indeed if we look at the movie

05:58.220 --> 06:01.620
These were microbes on the tube surface. We shot them here from Enterprise

06:01.620 --> 06:15.140
Let's take a look at a sin from their video for the movie The Bourne Supremacy now from near the end of the movie

06:15.140 --> 06:18.200
Somehow with all these witnesses Bourne still escapes into the ether after this

06:18.260 --> 06:21.960
So a lot of witnesses saw Bourne after his car crash in the tunnel

06:21.960 --> 06:27.380
So how did he possibly escape and you might be wondering well, what's wrong with this?

06:27.620 --> 06:33.940
Well, let's now watch us in from the start of their video for the next movie in the series The Bourne Ultimatum

06:33.940 --> 06:36.740
Which continues the story after this car crash?

06:36.780 --> 06:40.940
So the Moscow police are coming after Bourne because of that tunnel chase scene from the last movie

06:40.940 --> 06:42.860
How the fuck did Bourne get spotted in the first place?

06:42.860 --> 06:47.300
And how is he identified by anyone in that dark ass tunnel and that's unbelievable, isn't it?

06:47.300 --> 06:51.820
How did Bourne get away with all these witnesses there and then the next movie?

06:51.960 --> 06:55.420
How did any of those witnesses see Bourne in that dark tunnel?

06:56.060 --> 06:57.020
Shameful

06:57.020 --> 07:00.500
These videos came out only two days apart, by the way

07:01.300 --> 07:04.540
Similar to that. Let's look at a sin from their video about Ghost in the Shell

07:05.020 --> 07:08.340
Earlier we saw that the major is heavy and dense enough to bend a metal roof tile

07:08.340 --> 07:11.580
But here she's buoyant enough to float on water instead of sinking like a rock

07:11.660 --> 07:14.960
So how can the major float when she's so heavy?

07:15.180 --> 07:15.700
Well

07:15.700 --> 07:20.700
The shot CinemaSins used is taken from the end of the diving scene after we've already seen the

07:20.780 --> 07:23.900
flotation device on the majors back carry her to the surface

07:24.420 --> 07:29.780
CinemaSins neglect to show that obviously what they also don't mention here is the following

07:30.020 --> 07:35.740
conversation on the boat where Batou talks to the major about how dangerous it is for cyborgs to go swimming and

07:35.980 --> 07:41.360
Specifically mentions the majors flotation equipment, you know, how did CinemaSins miss this scene?

07:41.820 --> 07:48.720
Well, it turns out they didn't major is swimming in this scene much like she does in the original only the original brings up

07:48.720 --> 07:52.720
How dangerous it is for cybernetic humans to go deep in the water like this because you know

07:52.760 --> 07:56.840
They're made of heavy machinery, but this movie doesn't mention it once since this scenes compress so much

07:56.840 --> 07:58.840
It feels like it's in gif format. So

07:59.440 --> 08:01.440
CinemaSins did see that scene

08:01.700 --> 08:07.460
They must have in order to use it to criticize the live-action remake and that's pretty shady, isn't it?

08:07.800 --> 08:14.720
This just confirms my suspicions that CinemaSins write their scripts while watching the movie for the first time and don't go back to do

08:14.720 --> 08:21.900
Any editing when the movie provides them with additional information that proves them wrong at the start of their video for Citizen Kane?

08:22.900 --> 08:24.300
Citizen Kane

08:24.300 --> 08:26.300
They call these gondolas

08:26.420 --> 08:29.420
Viking canoes and then go on to say this

08:29.580 --> 08:34.900
rich guys castle has a drivable par-4 on hole 16 just so he can feel good about himself toward the end of the round a

08:35.340 --> 08:37.340
drivable par-4 at

08:38.020 --> 08:39.420
365 yards

08:39.420 --> 08:41.200
Well that seemed a little off to me

08:41.200 --> 08:48.420
So I went to check and found a page on golf week.com that lists the average PGA Tour driving distances for recent years

08:48.500 --> 08:56.180
And they have never averaged over 300 yards and they're professional golfers. So is this a drivable par-4?

08:56.660 --> 08:59.380
Well, maybe for about 30 people on the planet

08:59.380 --> 09:06.780
But that's it and I'd like to thank CinemaSins for getting two obvious things wrong in the first minute of their video about Citizen Kane

09:06.900 --> 09:13.980
So that I didn't have to force myself to watch the rest of it from Citizen Kane to the Lego Batman movie now

09:14.020 --> 09:16.500
This is where the movie loses me and starts to just be noise

09:16.780 --> 09:23.900
tossing in the Wicked Witch from Wizard of Oz Sauron Bremlins agents from the matrix King Kong Voldemort Daleks Daleks

09:25.660 --> 09:26.880
Daleks

09:26.880 --> 09:30.060
What's that? Oh, it's a day look isn't it?

09:30.660 --> 09:31.900
incredible

09:31.900 --> 09:39.100
In their video about blade they criticized the distance between the bite marks of the quotes vampire incisors

09:39.460 --> 09:45.420
But vampires are usually depicted not with sharp incisors, but with sharp canines as indeed

09:45.420 --> 09:46.780
They are in blade

09:46.780 --> 09:53.140
That's a canine right there in their video for the jungle book remake CinemaSins call Shere Khan a quote

09:53.580 --> 10:01.640
African tiger, which is odd both because the jungle book is set in India and African tigers don't exist

10:02.620 --> 10:08.280
CinemaSins still don't know too much about animals. I see let's do a few more animal examples here

10:08.860 --> 10:14.800
Starting with their video for Saw 2 where they say that this person is wearing a horse mask

10:15.280 --> 10:20.600
That's a horse snout there. I guess and in their video for Pocahontas

10:20.600 --> 10:26.920
They call this raccoon a rodent but raccoons aren't rodents in finding Dory

10:26.920 --> 10:31.880
They think that the octopus characters camouflage automatically blends in with the background

10:32.240 --> 10:34.240
But this is not the case in

10:34.240 --> 10:41.200
Reality the mimic octopus for example is able to control its camouflage ability at will not only to blend in with its surroundings

10:41.200 --> 10:46.480
But also to mimic other animals and in their video for the movie split they call these mice

10:47.120 --> 10:55.480
Gerbils so where does one learn about animals because CinemaSins need to go and be there in their video for

10:55.600 --> 11:00.160
Shrek they say that the DreamWorks logo has two letter E's in it

11:00.960 --> 11:03.300
And I'm not too sure about this to be honest

11:03.300 --> 11:10.160
I mean I I see the first one sure between the R and the a there and with them on that but after that

11:10.560 --> 11:16.540
I'm lost I'm afraid in how to train your dragon to they refer to a character called Doba

11:17.400 --> 11:21.000
However, there isn't a character called Doba in this movie

11:21.320 --> 11:26.240
There's a character called gober, so I'd guess they meant him is probably a safe bet

11:27.040 --> 11:30.800
Similar to that in Jack Reacher they refer to a character named Stacy

11:31.440 --> 11:35.080
However, there is no character called Stacy in Jack Reacher

11:35.680 --> 11:39.520
Who is Stacy CinemaSins? I have no idea

11:40.280 --> 11:45.240
Watch the following sin from Captain America Civil War. What was her name again?

11:45.240 --> 11:49.800
The Loras you called her Doc. Steve remembers the name of some random redhead buck

11:49.800 --> 11:56.040
He tried to impress more than 70 years ago. How can Captain America remember things that happened 70 years ago?

11:56.440 --> 11:56.960
well

11:56.960 --> 11:58.960
If you remember CinemaSins

11:59.160 --> 12:05.560
Captain America fell into a coma sometime in the Second World War and woke up in the present day so for him

12:06.000 --> 12:08.720
Consciously, it's a relatively recent event

12:09.040 --> 12:14.160
Let's do another superhero one this from early in their video for Batman vs Superman

12:14.640 --> 12:19.760
Dawn of Justice all it takes to get the most precious element on earth is a couple of free divers with a motorboat and a

12:19.760 --> 12:24.400
Dream is it ever explained how this Kryptonian vessel full of kryptonite crash-landed in the Indian fucking ocean

12:24.640 --> 12:30.920
So that's some people finding kryptonite in the Indian Ocean there, that's odd, isn't it? Where did that come from?

12:31.640 --> 12:36.240
Well, if you recall CinemaSins, there was a movie called Man of Steel

12:36.240 --> 12:42.240
Which I know you've seen because you did a video about it in which the plan of the antagonist in that movie was to

12:42.400 --> 12:46.900
Terraform the earth into a new Krypton using a large terraforming machine

12:47.560 --> 12:51.120
Located above the Indian Ocean and that's how the kryptonite got there

12:51.120 --> 12:59.560
It was the big kryptonian terraforming machine from the previous movie in the series and there's even an establishing shot of it earlier in the movie

12:59.560 --> 13:02.060
And CinemaSins used that in their video

13:02.840 --> 13:08.880
Look at this following nonsense from their video about Gone Girl the morning of what the morning of what? Yeah

13:08.880 --> 13:14.040
Yeah, we know it means this is the morning of her disappearance, but won't her disappearance. Tell us that the morning of what?

13:14.560 --> 13:17.080
the morning of July 5th

13:17.800 --> 13:20.120
It says it right there on the screen

13:21.040 --> 13:23.960
Next movie, let's do The Conjuring 2

13:24.400 --> 13:29.680
So, okay at the start of this movie a character relives the events of November 13th

13:30.360 --> 13:35.440
1974 when Ronald DeFeo jr. Shot and killed six members of his family in Amityville

13:36.720 --> 13:40.760
CinemaSins criticized the movie for showing the family sleeping through the gunshots

13:40.760 --> 13:43.480
But this is actually faithful to the account of the case

13:43.760 --> 13:48.640
Police were puzzled by the fact that nobody appeared to have gotten out of bed to investigate the gunshots

13:48.880 --> 13:54.500
As all the victims were found face down in bed, so plus one to the movie for accuracy

13:54.500 --> 13:57.400
I guess but that's not what I want to talk about here

13:57.400 --> 14:03.720
I want to talk about this in movie proves Vera Farmiga has a way better imaginary dream shotgun than you do a dream

14:04.200 --> 14:09.400
Shotgun. Hey, well, you see the murders were actually carried out with a lever action rifle

14:09.600 --> 14:16.800
Not a shotgun and is that unfair of me, you know criticizing CinemaSins for not recognizing an invisible gun

14:17.320 --> 14:20.540
Well, no because later in that scene the character

14:21.060 --> 14:25.680
Experiencing the vision walks in front of a mirror and the rifle is briefly visible

14:25.680 --> 14:30.240
and I know CinemaSins saw it because they featured it in a sin, so

14:30.960 --> 14:37.800
Near in their video about I am legend CinemaSins say the following the viral zombie apocalypse somehow

14:37.800 --> 14:42.040
Destroyed two-thirds of all the most famous bridges in New York. The bridges were destroyed

14:42.760 --> 14:46.440
Somehow I wonder how any ideas movie

14:46.800 --> 14:54.800
...

14:54.800 --> 14:59.600
That's right, the military destroyed the bridges. How did CinemaSins miss that?

14:59.600 --> 15:06.240
Well, they give the movie a sin for having the broken bridges at about 25 minutes into the movie and the bridges aren't shown

15:06.240 --> 15:09.720
Being blown up until a flashback that happens over 30 minutes later

15:10.240 --> 15:14.760
CinemaSins just didn't go back to edit the bridge sin out when they were shown to be wrong

15:14.960 --> 15:21.120
Because they're lazy and their videos are bad. This next sin is from their video for the movie Krampus

15:21.200 --> 15:23.080
Back when Howard handed Tom this gun

15:23.080 --> 15:28.160
He didn't give him any more ammo and when Howard got attacked by the gopher from Caddyshack Tom fired off two rounds

15:28.160 --> 15:30.040
So where the hell did these extra rounds come from?

15:30.040 --> 15:37.480
Well, that's because revolvers don't auto-eject casings. The cylinder would still look like that even with all of the shots fired

15:37.600 --> 15:43.500
You'd have to eject the casings manually. Now, here's an annoying one from their video for John Wick

15:44.260 --> 15:50.840
Every umbrella at a funeral is black cliche and this is something they're repeating their video for Justice League

15:51.300 --> 15:56.700
Flashpoint Paradox. Now depicting umbrellas at a funeral being black isn't a cliche

15:56.700 --> 16:02.780
It's an accurate representation of a behavior that actually happens in reality and this worries me a little

16:02.780 --> 16:06.720
it makes me think the CinemaSins guys have been turning up to funerals with like

16:07.260 --> 16:11.220
This and not understanding that that is generally considered inappropriate

16:12.220 --> 16:20.040
Anyway, let's move on. Now CinemaSins have previously taken some heat for their assertion that there is no gravity in space

16:20.260 --> 16:25.100
And in their video about the animated Transformers movie, they repeat that mistake

16:25.840 --> 16:29.400
Sarcastically saying this is how gravity works in space kids

16:29.860 --> 16:35.520
When the character Unicron drops another character into their mouth. The thing here though

16:35.520 --> 16:37.820
Is that Unicron is the size of a planet?

16:37.820 --> 16:40.400
So that's exactly how gravity quote

16:40.820 --> 16:47.660
Works because if the character has the mass of a planet then it will attract other objects of mass in the same manner as a

16:47.660 --> 16:48.660
planet

16:48.660 --> 16:51.160
CinemaSins seem to think there's some sort of difference

16:51.940 --> 16:58.900
Gravitationally speaking between being quote in space and the inferred opposite state not in space

16:58.980 --> 17:02.460
Whatever that means but no we're in space now

17:02.740 --> 17:07.960
CinemaSins all the time as far as gravity is concerned. Anyway, the earth doesn't like

17:09.020 --> 17:11.720
Generate gravity for us or something

17:12.720 --> 17:14.940
These guys need to go and read their Albert Einstein

17:15.540 --> 17:20.420
Kind of Logan to carry professor X to his bed for some rest and I'd be calling by this imagery if he wasn't also leaving

17:20.420 --> 17:24.480
The wheelchair so far away from the bed is to render Charles immobile until further human assistance arrives

17:24.760 --> 17:31.320
So why would Logan leave the chair so far from the bed instead of moving it closer? That's rather mean, isn't it?

17:32.040 --> 17:34.040
Anything to say for yourself movie?

17:35.080 --> 17:42.520
Forces forces glad you're not in that business anymore. They don't want me. They want you. Oh

17:43.260 --> 17:44.120
Look at that

17:44.120 --> 17:51.260
He does move it closer and you can even see it closer to the bed in the CinemaSins video a few sins later

17:52.140 --> 17:57.400
Shameful stuff there their video about the movie in time is quite droll

17:57.820 --> 18:05.400
The second sin in that video is complaining about how the movie never explains its premise and the third sin in that video is complaining

18:05.400 --> 18:06.720
about the movie

18:06.720 --> 18:12.480
Overexplaining itself fire an expositional monologue that gives away the conceit now the conceit of that movie by the way

18:12.480 --> 18:18.040
It's that people stop aging at 25 and then use remaining lifetime as a currency

18:18.040 --> 18:23.080
So you have poor people with only a few hours on the clock and rich people with hundreds of years, you know

18:23.080 --> 18:28.540
You get it. Now. I mention it here because CinemaSins later give the movie a sin for the characters being

18:29.320 --> 18:31.320
motivated by currency and

18:32.080 --> 18:38.040
Yes, I'd imagine the ticking death clocks they have in their arms that will kill them when they run out of time would be

18:38.560 --> 18:44.000
Pretty big motivators actually in their video for the movie the purge election year

18:44.520 --> 18:51.640
CinemaSins are surprised to see somebody stab through a bulletproof vest and this is a mistake. They repeat in their video for the rock

18:52.240 --> 18:55.960
Now the thing about bulletproof vests is they're bulletproof

18:56.840 --> 19:04.320
What you'd wear to protect against knives is a stab proof vest and they're different things designed and constructed in different ways for different

19:04.760 --> 19:06.040
purposes

19:06.040 --> 19:09.880
Bulletproof vests are built to disperse the kinetic energy of a projectile

19:09.920 --> 19:15.800
Throughout the material and aren't really built to stop something sharp and pointed that can pierce through the material

19:16.080 --> 19:19.660
The more, you know, hey in their video for I robot

19:19.660 --> 19:25.800
they think that the characters are driving a hover car and give the movie a sin when they hear the wheels screech on the ground and

19:26.200 --> 19:31.980
But it's actually a prototype car with spherical wheels and not a hover car their video for the movie

19:31.980 --> 19:35.160
Moana is pretty offensive at several points

19:35.600 --> 19:39.760
CinemaSins refusal to do any research or look anything up comes off really badly

19:40.120 --> 19:45.680
When they're watching a movie based on the mythology and culture of a people at CinemaSins have no idea about

19:45.880 --> 19:50.080
For example, they give the movie a sin for featuring a fish hook constellation

19:50.080 --> 19:55.080
Which they call fictional but in reality is an actual Polynesian constellation

19:55.480 --> 19:59.580
Better recognized in the West as the tail of the constellation Scorpio

19:59.640 --> 20:04.880
They also give the movie a sin for featuring this thing which is a Polynesian slit drum

20:05.000 --> 20:08.160
Which CinemaSins say looks nothing like a drum

20:08.760 --> 20:13.220
Apparently they were expecting one of these in the ancient cave or something

20:13.280 --> 20:17.720
Watch the following sin from their video about the movie battle Los Angeles

20:20.400 --> 20:25.560
First off can you be a little more specific wouldn't you want to know the exact time left before the rescue helicopter arrives?

20:25.600 --> 20:28.160
Also ten minutes ago random marine number four yelled

20:31.040 --> 20:36.800
So I'd synchronize those swatches if I were you now the mistake CinemaSins made there was that the soldier was actually shouting

20:37.200 --> 20:41.840
25 meters not 25 minutes to indicate distance and not time

20:42.040 --> 20:48.700
So that explains that supposed discrepancy there in their video for now you see me too. They make a rather funny mistake

20:48.720 --> 20:50.920
This is what we've been waiting for now

20:50.920 --> 20:56.800
It's time to get the work since when do the world's best magicians blindly sign up to be basically MacGyver going after wrongdoers and corporate

20:56.800 --> 20:57.620
Stooges also

20:57.620 --> 21:02.520
Why are they all shining their flashlights on these blueprints in the shot as though flashlight activated blueprints are an actual thing?

21:02.520 --> 21:05.780
You see those aren't flashlights. They're black lights

21:05.840 --> 21:10.120
They're revealing something that was drawn in ink that only shows up under a black light

21:10.400 --> 21:14.840
There's also this sin from later in the movie. This is my twin brother chase

21:14.840 --> 21:19.900
What the actual movie also character has a twin brother or any kind of sibling that they never mentioned before?

21:20.240 --> 21:23.480
So has that character's brother never been mentioned before?

21:23.960 --> 21:27.400
Well about half an hour into the previous movie in that series

21:27.400 --> 21:33.680
This is said two TV specials slowly days then your brother slash manager disappeared with all your hard-earned money

21:34.240 --> 21:35.680
Did you research?

21:35.680 --> 21:39.840
So that character's brother was mentioned before hardy-ha

21:40.920 --> 21:46.280
Similar to this sin is the following one from their video about home alone. Why do the McAllisters have a doggy door?

21:46.280 --> 21:48.840
There's no mention of a dog or cat throughout this entire movie

21:48.840 --> 21:54.720
Is it sole purpose shooting bad guys in the crotch with bb's no mention of a dog throughout the entire movie?

21:55.440 --> 21:58.520
However two minutes into the movie this happens

22:03.360 --> 22:06.200
Let's do another similar one from the movie trolls

22:06.200 --> 22:10.900
I'll just get my worthless scullery made to get another place setting ready for the lovely lady

22:11.920 --> 22:13.520
glitter sparkles

22:13.520 --> 22:15.720
Crystal only introduced Bridget as his plus one

22:15.720 --> 22:20.500
So the only way chef could know her name is if the screenwriters were committed to seeing Christine Baranski chew the hell out of this

22:20.620 --> 22:25.540
So, how did this character know this character's name when they weren't introduced

22:25.540 --> 22:32.540
Well ten seconds previously in the movie this happens meet the lovely lady glitter sparkles

22:34.300 --> 22:39.400
So what happened to their cinema sins was it so hard to find things to criticize about

22:39.700 --> 22:45.320
Trolls that you had to lie about something that just happened in the movie. I don't know

22:46.320 --> 22:50.800
Take the gloves off sugar Ray that's like a 30 year old boxing reference at this point

22:50.800 --> 22:52.400
This is movie taking place in the 70s

22:52.400 --> 22:56.200
Or is it just a dated boxing reference worst thing is the movie will never answer this question

22:56.280 --> 22:59.880
So what time period is the nutjob set?

23:00.440 --> 23:03.320
Apparently the movie never answers this question

23:03.320 --> 23:09.780
Well, we as viewers can infer the general time period of the movie from several contextual clues

23:10.140 --> 23:15.100
For example the opening of the movie shows these old-fashioned cars driving on the roads

23:15.100 --> 23:18.580
And there's this guy wearing suspenders and a flat cap

23:19.220 --> 23:26.540
There's this 50s mobster looking guy sitting on a bench this newspaper that displays the date as October 21st

23:27.340 --> 23:34.020
1959 and combined from all these contextual hints. I'm able to estimate the general date that the movie set as

23:34.540 --> 23:36.540
October 21st

23:37.100 --> 23:39.740
1959 the movie will never answer this question

23:40.500 --> 23:48.020
My foot cinema sins were confused there by the sugar Ray reference probably mistaking it to mean sugar Ray Leonard

23:48.360 --> 23:54.200
Who was only three years old in 1959 and thus probably not yet a well-known boxer

23:54.580 --> 24:00.820
More likely though the characters were referencing sugar Ray Robinson who was a boxer active throughout the 1950s

24:01.180 --> 24:07.060
Some more time period shenanigans now first from their video about Pirates of the Caribbean on

24:07.820 --> 24:12.420
Stranger Tides which cinema sins say takes place in the late 17th century

24:13.300 --> 24:17.620
The movie is actually set in 1750 which isn't in the 17th century

24:18.420 --> 24:19.900
Just trust me

24:19.900 --> 24:26.780
And I've got no clue where cinema sins got the late part from I think that was just a random guess really in their video

24:26.780 --> 24:30.820
For the movie King Arthur they refer to a medieval battle happening

24:30.820 --> 24:36.220
even though the movies set during the late Roman occupation of Britain making medieval an

24:36.780 --> 24:41.460
Incorrect descriptor there. They also elsewhere refer to England's army

24:41.460 --> 24:48.580
Even though England didn't even exist at that point and watch the following sin from their video about Alice through the looking-glass

24:49.140 --> 24:55.160
In Hollywood doctors do not squirt out part of the medicine to fucking test if a syringe is working how you ever got started on

24:55.160 --> 24:58.200
This troop I will never know but not get the off rather

24:58.760 --> 25:06.040
Angry about syringes that so yes doctors don't squirt out a bit of the medicine in order to test if the syringe is working

25:06.120 --> 25:11.000
But they do squirt out a bit of the medicine to ensure there are no air bubbles in the syringe

25:12.040 --> 25:14.240
Injecting air into someone can be very dangerous

25:14.760 --> 25:20.400
So what they do is tap the syringe a few times and then squirt a bit out to force any air out of the syringe

25:20.400 --> 25:21.840
before use

25:21.840 --> 25:27.800
Isn't learning fun watch the following sin from Fantastic Beasts and where to find them

25:28.240 --> 25:32.600
Legilimens yeah, but I always have trouble with your kind Brits

25:32.760 --> 25:34.440
That's British also

25:34.440 --> 25:39.520
Legilimens is someone who can read minds someone that was never once introduced in the entire world of Harry Potter before now

25:39.560 --> 25:45.680
So this Legilimens thing is something that was never introduced in the entire world of Harry Potter

25:45.680 --> 25:49.760
Well that's not true because it's in the books for a start

25:49.760 --> 25:55.640
But maybe CinemaSins just meant the movies and so has it been mentioned in the movies before

25:56.120 --> 25:59.020
Well if we watch Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

26:06.560 --> 26:12.320
That's right Snape says it let's take a look at a sin from their video about the movie Central Intelligence

26:13.040 --> 26:15.360
It's 6 p.m.. And they're in the Eastern time zone

26:15.360 --> 26:20.680
So there's no way there's a football game on unless this bar is showing reruns because the NFL never plays games that start at 6 p.m.

26:20.680 --> 26:21.800
Eastern

26:21.800 --> 26:28.480
Okay, so there's a lot wrong with this and so the NFL never plays games that start at 6 p.m.. Eastern

26:28.680 --> 26:34.000
Well the first problem here is that there's nothing in the movie to indicate that this game has just started

26:34.000 --> 26:36.360
It could be a game that started earlier

26:36.360 --> 26:41.120
And is still playing at the next problem here is if we do a little zoom and enhance

26:41.120 --> 26:44.180
We can make out the team logo on the field which is this

26:44.520 --> 26:52.280
The Tiger Eye logo of the team the LSU Tigers which is a college team and thus wouldn't be playing in an NFL game anyway

26:52.320 --> 26:59.080
So this sin is wrong twice in two completely different ways well done CinemaSins in their video for the movie

26:59.080 --> 27:05.280
Don't Breathe they tried a character for urinating at a crime scene for leaving his DNA there

27:05.560 --> 27:11.720
Although actually urine doesn't contain DNA that's a fun biology factor for you there

27:12.360 --> 27:14.480
in their video for Toy Story 3

27:14.480 --> 27:18.400
They spell the character Sid's name wrong and refer to him as a serial killer

27:18.760 --> 27:26.080
And not noticing that Sid is actually featured in the movie as a garbage man also from this movie is the following sin

27:28.360 --> 27:33.840
Then why did you take it out in the first place also didn't previous movie show us your organs still work even when not attached

27:33.840 --> 27:36.920
So why not just look through that eye to figure out where it is, right?

27:36.960 --> 27:42.940
Yeah, why didn't she just look through the eye to find where it was that I'd be clever wouldn't it oh wait

27:43.460 --> 27:48.900
She does do that in blade 2 they incorrectly refers to the mutated vampires as

27:49.280 --> 27:55.960
Creepers when they're actually called Reapers in the ring too. They think the town the characters move to Astoria

27:56.000 --> 28:00.160
It's in Washington and when it's actually in Oregon in

28:00.580 --> 28:04.160
Ghostbusters they refer to this thing as a bicycle, but it isn't

28:04.960 --> 28:09.520
In Hellboy they're confused when a character pulls the pins on two grenades

28:09.520 --> 28:13.840
But throws them one at a time and not understanding how grenades work

28:13.840 --> 28:20.640
I guess pulling the pin doesn't actually do anything by itself the pin is just there to hold the strike lever in place

28:20.640 --> 28:24.920
It's releasing this lever that causes the grenade to explode after a short delay

28:25.240 --> 28:30.400
You can actually put the pin back in a grenade safely assuming the leaf has been held down the whole time

28:31.200 --> 28:35.040
Although I'd advise against trying it in that video for unbreakable

28:35.040 --> 28:39.920
They give the movie a sin for having train seats that face backwards as well as forwards

28:40.440 --> 28:46.180
I don't know. Why is that an unusual thing in the States like over here pretty much all the trains

28:46.180 --> 28:53.600
I like that in their video for suicide squad they claim the character dr. Moon explored a cave featured earlier by herself

28:54.320 --> 29:00.420
But if you watch the movie you can see someone else with her in that flashback implying there were other people with her on the

29:00.420 --> 29:07.880
Trip unless that person is just someone she bumped into in passing in the middle of a jungle which while possible would be kind of weird

29:08.320 --> 29:10.320
In the original planet of the Apes

29:10.440 --> 29:17.300
There's a scene where the Apes flush some humans out of a cornfield using sticks and when cinema sins watch it

29:17.300 --> 29:19.560
They think the Apes are cutting the corn down

29:20.080 --> 29:22.080
With blunt sticks

29:22.080 --> 29:25.040
Above course, they're not they're just flushing people out

29:25.040 --> 29:28.140
I mean you can obviously see they're not cutting down the corn

29:28.140 --> 29:33.000
So I haven't got a clue what cinema sins were on about here in their video for the movie contact

29:33.000 --> 29:39.200
They mock the appearance of this nebula, but that's actually a real nebula. It's called the pillars of creation

29:39.420 --> 29:44.480
They also say that the moon is quote nowhere near that size relative to the earth

29:45.120 --> 29:48.720
But without a reference for where the camera is located here

29:49.160 --> 29:51.040
That's a silly statement

29:51.040 --> 29:54.800
After all, if you're very close to the moon, it would appear larger than the earth

29:55.040 --> 29:59.200
You'd need to know exactly where the camera was located in order to make that judgment

29:59.560 --> 30:03.680
Let's watch a sin from their video about the movie kung fu panda free

30:05.560 --> 30:10.460
If no one could find you pink on the down I've got this but yeah, he's right

30:10.560 --> 30:14.600
So let's watch the clip from the movie to give us a little bit more context here

30:18.720 --> 30:20.400
Wow

30:20.400 --> 30:25.320
But how did you know where I was I received a message that led me here

30:25.320 --> 30:32.040
How could you receive a message if no one could find you sounds suspicious to me. So, okay

30:32.040 --> 30:40.440
How did pose biological father get a message telling him where Poe was if he lives in a secret village any ideas movie?

30:41.280 --> 30:44.160
No, it was a message from the universe

30:45.680 --> 30:47.680
That's grown

30:49.200 --> 30:56.440
As I hope you would when I sent the message to your father, huh, you sent the universe mail, whoa

30:57.080 --> 30:58.560
Yes

30:58.560 --> 31:05.600
But again, that's a reveal from the end of the movie and cinema sins couldn't be bothered going back to correct their earlier mistake

31:05.840 --> 31:07.940
Let's watch a sin from their video about the

31:08.560 --> 31:15.200
2017 live-action remake of beauty and the Beast since this movie suffers from the exact issue about the castle being in plain sight

31:15.200 --> 31:16.640
I'll just repeat the same sin

31:16.640 --> 31:19.600
I gave the last movie the Beast has only been secretly beasting for 10 years

31:19.600 --> 31:22.120
But Maurice is somehow unaware of this very nearby castle

31:22.120 --> 31:27.200
Also, it's super weird that the villagers wouldn't be at all disturbed that the prince of the very nearby castle hasn't been seen or heard

31:27.200 --> 31:33.200
From in years and even if this prince is habitually reclusive you'd think that someone would know one of the 300 live-in servants and wonder

31:33.200 --> 31:34.920
Where they are, right, right?

31:34.920 --> 31:40.840
No, I wouldn't think that was weird because I watched the movie as days bled into years

31:41.320 --> 31:44.200
The prince and his servants were forgotten by the world

31:44.840 --> 31:49.660
For the Enchantress had erased all memory of them from the minds of the people they loved

31:50.160 --> 31:55.800
Now that clip occurs during the opening narration. So how did cinema sins missed that?

31:55.920 --> 32:02.400
Well, check this out for the Enchantress had erased all memory of them from the minds of the people they loved

32:02.520 --> 32:05.580
That's an excellent attempt to close a plot hole opened by the animated movie

32:05.580 --> 32:10.620
But it leaves me with a whole new set of questions. Yeah, that's right. They gave it a sin

32:10.660 --> 32:13.060
So what happened here then?

32:13.060 --> 32:19.940
You know at some point between writing this sin and the one from later in the video cinema sins somehow forgot the details of the

32:19.940 --> 32:22.500
Opening narration that they watched, you know

32:22.500 --> 32:28.140
That or these videos are a collaborative effort written by several people who don't talk to each other or something

32:28.700 --> 32:32.340
Let's watch a sin from their video about Star Wars the Clone Wars

32:33.020 --> 32:39.540
Crime Lord Jabba the Hudson has been kidnapped by a rival band of pirates. Excuse me. What his son

32:39.540 --> 32:42.340
Are you serious funny? We're only hearing about this guy just now

32:45.220 --> 32:51.140
This warlord reaches out to the federal government to help him find his captured son instead of simply taking matters into his own hands and

32:51.140 --> 32:52.540
Sending a bunch of bounty hunters to do it

32:52.540 --> 32:59.480
So why didn't Jabba the Hutt hire some bounty hunters to find his son that seems like the sort of thing he'd do, right?

33:00.020 --> 33:04.460
Well 15 minutes into the movie this happens. Yes commander

33:04.500 --> 33:08.560
We've discovered that Jabba the Hutt has also hired bounty hunters to track down his son

33:08.740 --> 33:15.980
It turns out Jabba did hire some bounty hunters cinema sins just lied about it in their video for the movie sing

33:15.980 --> 33:22.180
They wonder if the shrimp act need a handler to push their tank around but later when they're dismissed from the show

33:22.420 --> 33:27.300
We see that they do in fact have a handler with them in their video for Star Trek Beyond

33:27.300 --> 33:33.560
They give the movie a sin because the alien planet has air that humans can breathe. What a coincidence, eh?

33:34.000 --> 33:37.300
What they missed was this scene 18 minutes into the movie

33:38.000 --> 33:39.880
approaching ultimate

33:39.880 --> 33:43.680
Class M planet now an M class planet

33:43.680 --> 33:48.460
There is the Star Trek universe's designation for a planet suitable for human life

33:48.460 --> 33:53.340
And now you might say well that's still an unlikely narrative convenience, isn't it?

33:53.340 --> 34:00.680
Even if they did establish it earlier in the story and you would nearly be right except for the fact that the antagonist is later

34:00.680 --> 34:07.260
Revealed to actually be a human Starfleet captain played by Idris Elba who crash-landed on that planet long ago

34:07.260 --> 34:07.800
and

34:07.800 --> 34:13.600
Thus the planet would have to be able to support human life or he would have died when he crashed and none of the events

34:13.600 --> 34:15.500
Of the film would have taken place

34:15.500 --> 34:20.800
So there now do you want to see possibly the worst cinema sin I have ever encountered

34:21.280 --> 34:27.120
This really gets me this one from their video about the movie too fast too furious

34:27.120 --> 34:32.100
If slapjack is only going over 100 then seconds later Brian hits the nos and is blasting past 160

34:32.100 --> 34:36.500
How is slapjack not eating Brian's dust, right? So this is

34:37.800 --> 34:39.280
annoying

34:39.280 --> 34:45.220
So the characters slapjack and Brian are engaged in some sort of illegal

34:45.520 --> 34:49.640
Street race and though both cars appear to be going at a similar speed

34:50.080 --> 34:54.500
When we see close-ups of their speedometer as we see that Brian is doing 160

34:55.020 --> 34:57.540
Whereas slapjack is doing about a hundred

34:58.220 --> 35:04.500
What a silly movie mistake you might think if you were some sort of utter

35:04.780 --> 35:10.320
Buffoon who had never seen a car you see Brian's speedometer is in kilometers per hour

35:11.140 --> 35:13.140
That's why it says 160

35:13.740 --> 35:20.860
Slapjack's speedometer on the other hand is primarily in miles per hour. So it shows him doing 100. But what are these other?

35:21.620 --> 35:24.620
Smaller numbers in red on the inside there

35:24.660 --> 35:29.780
Well, that's the speed of slapjacks car in kilometers per hour. And would you look at that?

35:30.060 --> 35:37.180
He's doing about 160 which is how fast Brian is going and that's why the cars appear to be going the same

35:38.060 --> 35:40.060
goddamn speed

35:40.700 --> 35:47.420
At cinema sins don't seem to have much of a clue when it comes to cars in their video for the movie

35:47.540 --> 35:53.060
Jason Bourne, they incorrectly identify this Dodge Charger as a Dodge Challenger

35:53.620 --> 35:57.980
And in their video for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles out of the shadows

35:57.980 --> 36:01.560
They jokingly expect this SRT to turn into bumblebee

36:02.080 --> 36:04.820
Except of course, we all know that bumblebee is a Camaro

36:05.240 --> 36:08.860
Let's take a look at a sin from their video about the movie angry birds

36:09.140 --> 36:12.420
movie has mine birds because it's super funny and you just didn't realize it

36:13.100 --> 36:18.780
Is going on here is he in school and if so, why is he hireable as a clown? Why is he painting?

36:18.780 --> 36:21.740
Why was there a mime hanging out a second ago? Where the fuck is this village?

36:21.740 --> 36:25.820
This is the one time I'd welcome a little fucking narration. So what's going on here then?

36:25.860 --> 36:33.540
Well, this section of the movie is actually a montage of various scenes from the main characters life showing situations in which he's been

36:33.540 --> 36:38.500
Angry, I guess and this particular scene is a flashback to his time in school

36:38.500 --> 36:41.940
I mean, here's how he looked just five seconds ago

36:41.940 --> 36:47.340
and then it cuts to him in school and he looks like this a little kid version of himself and

36:47.620 --> 36:54.620
I guess the filmmakers trusted in the ability of their audience to recognize a series of flashbacks and not try to

36:54.780 --> 37:00.600
Interpret it as a linear narrative in which the character rapidly changes age appearance and location

37:00.980 --> 37:07.500
But I guess they didn't account for the cinema sins guys who need to be led by the hand through absolutely everything

37:07.620 --> 37:10.820
Let's watch the first few sins from their video about the movie

37:11.060 --> 37:17.660
Warcraft there has been a war between orcs and humans for as long as can be remembered or as long as it's been since Tolkien

37:17.660 --> 37:20.820
Created the orcs were blatantly stealing for this game movie also narration

37:20.820 --> 37:24.620
But there was once a time when we did not even know who our enemy was

37:24.820 --> 37:27.940
We just said you've been fighting with humans as long as you can remember

37:27.940 --> 37:32.420
So, how do you remember the time before that when you didn't even know your enemy but in the beginning?

37:32.660 --> 37:38.420
How could we have known know what you've given me three statements so far two about knowing one about wondering how you could have known

37:38.420 --> 37:40.460
And already I think I see the problem with this movie

37:40.540 --> 37:41.020
Okay

37:41.020 --> 37:42.860
So there's a few problems here

37:42.860 --> 37:47.820
Firstly the orc voiceover says we've been fighting humans as long as we can remember

37:47.900 --> 37:54.620
But there was once a time when we did not know who our enemy was now, that's not actually a contradiction

37:55.580 --> 38:01.380
Knowledge of the existence of a time before your memory begins does not mean you personally remember it

38:01.540 --> 38:04.300
Just that you know about it for example

38:04.300 --> 38:10.220
I have knowledge of the existence of ancient Rome, but that doesn't mean I personally remember it does it?

38:11.300 --> 38:17.020
Secondly here where cinema sins say known what you've given me three statements so far etc

38:17.940 --> 38:22.940
That's not true cinema sins cut a line out of the opening narration here

38:22.980 --> 38:28.040
Let's have a listen, but there was once a time when we did not even know who our enemy was

38:32.220 --> 38:43.940
So the following line, but in the beginning how could we have known is referring to this previous line about what the green fell magic did to them

38:44.420 --> 38:49.860
Cinema sins just cut that line out to make the narration seem worse than it actually is I mean

38:50.180 --> 38:55.240
It's still pretty bad, so I don't know why cinema sins bothered to misrepresent it really

38:55.560 --> 38:58.240
But they did in the Lego movie

38:58.240 --> 39:03.760
They point out this Lego bike and say the minifigures couldn't ride it because it only has one stud at the back

39:04.160 --> 39:09.680
But actually they can ride those they stand over the middle. That's not a seat back there

39:09.680 --> 39:16.800
That's just a rear wheel guard in Die Hard 2. There's the following sin recalibrate sea level recalibrate sea level

39:16.800 --> 39:22.560
Don't the planes have independent meters and gauges that are not reliant upon control towers to determine how far they are up in the air

39:23.520 --> 39:30.080
No, actually one of the purposes of the control tower is to transmit to the planes a code based on atmospheric pressure

39:30.680 --> 39:36.760
That the planes need to calculate their altitude above sea level not all planes can do that independently

39:37.080 --> 39:38.880
Here's a fun one next it

39:38.880 --> 39:43.120
Do you know how cinema sins like to do this in case you confused it for Bruce go, Kentucky?

39:43.120 --> 39:49.000
You know hardy ha we obviously know the country who would need to be told what country we were in

39:49.220 --> 39:51.620
You know certainly not us at cinema sins

39:52.560 --> 39:59.260
Well, that's in there is from their video about x-men apocalypse, and now here's a sin from later in the video

40:02.040 --> 40:08.360
Because someone decided to wake up apocalypse right now an earthquake in Egypt was felt all the way to Germany they think they're in Germany

40:08.900 --> 40:13.880
Even with the word Poland appearing on the screen in the movie. They still got the country wrong

40:14.100 --> 40:21.320
They also think that Andalusia is a city in Spain instead of a region in Spain and they confuse Goa India with the non-existent

40:22.040 --> 40:29.200
Gao India, so we'll just add geography to the list of things cinema sins doesn't understand alongside animals

40:29.960 --> 40:31.960
history cars guns

40:32.380 --> 40:39.200
Movies and whatever else oh this video is getting on a bit isn't it and let's double time a few minor errors here

40:40.440 --> 40:46.120
In peach dragon they type 3 minutes and 15 minutes instead of 3 minutes and 15 seconds

40:46.120 --> 40:48.980
They here type spirit instead of spirit

40:49.120 --> 40:54.400
They forget the space between in and 15 in the title of their video for the boss, baby

40:54.460 --> 40:58.780
They leave out the word to in this sentence from there the mummy returns video

40:59.420 --> 41:01.860
everything wrong with Deadpool in 16 minutes

41:02.580 --> 41:07.100
Everything wrong with Deadpool in 15 minutes in the secret life of pets

41:07.100 --> 41:11.840
They use the wrong ending template for the video the one from their music sins channel a mistake

41:11.840 --> 41:14.880
They repeat several times in other videos before correcting it

41:14.880 --> 41:20.320
I mean I could keep going this video contains just a portion of the mistakes

41:20.320 --> 41:26.880
I found watching through cinema sins offerings from the past year. I've got 10 a4 pages filled with this

41:27.400 --> 41:31.080
Both sides this video could have been three times as long

41:31.800 --> 41:35.360
Easily, but I think I should probably arbitrarily stop here

41:35.880 --> 41:37.880
So what have we learned today?

41:38.220 --> 41:44.480
Well, nothing new the cinema sin still hasn't improved at all if anything they've gotten worse

41:44.880 --> 41:52.600
And they're still incapable of following along with even the simplest stories unless they're held by the hand the whole time with on-screen text and narration

41:53.000 --> 41:56.800
Which they'll then complain about anyway, and then probably forget

41:57.000 --> 42:04.000
They'll still lie about and misrepresent the content of movies in order to provide their audience with an unearned smug feeling of superiority

42:04.560 --> 42:07.280
Over something and they still don't know anything

42:07.880 --> 42:13.080
At all about anything and the worst of all they're not funny

42:13.520 --> 42:20.840
The cinema sins YouTube channel is probably the only human creation to which I would deny the title art

42:21.880 --> 42:25.960
Thanks a lot for watching everyone if you'd like to see more videos like this

42:26.960 --> 42:34.320
Well, don't support me on on patreon. I'm not gonna be making more videos like this. I mean once a year max

42:35.000 --> 42:41.840
Every cinema sins video is a Gordian knot of wrongness and untangling it costs a part of your soul

42:42.440 --> 42:46.700
Thanks to all my patrons anyway, I mean I couldn't continue to do this without them

42:46.960 --> 42:52.040
So I should probably be blaming them here rather than thanking them thinking about it

42:52.720 --> 42:54.720
How dare you support me?

42:55.240 --> 42:58.720
Honestly, I take it as an insult. I'm supported in this

43:01.200 --> 43:08.080
Anyway see you next year, I guess and we'll look at everything they got wrong between now and then bye
