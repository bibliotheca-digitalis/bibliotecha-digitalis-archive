00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,500
Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about a narrative, the narrative of the snowflake generation,

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,000
which actually has a Wikipedia page, I was surprised to learn,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,500
a term used to characterize the young adults of the 2010s as being more prone to taking offense

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,500
and less resilient than previous generations, or as being too emotionally vulnerable

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,500
to cope with views that challenge their own.

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,500
Now, in this video, I'll explain why this characterization is not true.

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,500
Sort of almost completely made up, actually,

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,500
and assisting me today by providing a textbook example of this argument is 42,

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,500
a YouTube talky man with 2.4 million subscribers.

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,500
I'll be taking a look at his video entitled,

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,500
Why Is Everyone Getting So Offended, currently with close to 650,000 views.

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,500
Now, as always, I'd encourage you to watch his video first,

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,500
so you can be sure I don't misrepresent his argument,

14
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,500
which I understand goes as follows.

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,500
So 42's video starts off with him identifying the Snowflake Generation,

16
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,500
a group of, quote,

17
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,500
He then gives an example of a time when he says political correctness had fatal consequences

18
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,500
by talking about the 2009 Fort Hood shooting,

19
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,500
arguing that the attack could have been prevented,

20
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,500
but that political correctness stopped the US Army from taking action.

21
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,500
He then moves on to talk censorship of comedians and comedy shows,

22
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,500
such as Monty Python and Faulty Towers.

23
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
He then argues that comedy should have no bounds,

24
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,500
and that criticizing offensive comedians amounts to censoring their freedom of speech.

25
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,500
42 then talks about how, due to the Snowflake Generation's social media use,

26
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,500
advertisers don't want to advertise on shows that are deemed too offensive,

27
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,500
citing YouTube as an example,

28
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:00,500
and mentioning his own channel as one that's had videos demonetized for not being advertiser-friendly.

29
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,500
He then moves on to say that being offended is natural,

30
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,500
and people have always been offended by things,

31
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,500
but the difference today is that the Snowflake Generation millennials are acting entitled.

32
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,500
You see, they've apparently grown up in a time free of violent war, oppression, and poverty,

33
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,500
and as a result, they don't know what it's like to not get everything they want.

34
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,500
He then moves on to talk about how he's offended by instant coffee,

35
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,500
but it would be ridiculous of him to campaign against it or try to get it banned.

36
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,500
Then 42 spends a while talking about the recent court case in Scotland,

37
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,500
where Internet personality Count Dankula

38
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,500
– I will never get tired of saying that –

39
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,500
was fined for making an offensive YouTube video.

40
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:48,500
Then he closes out with a rousing speech about standing up for yourself against the evils of political correctness,

41
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,500
set to footage of a man running on a beach and punching the air triumphantly.

42
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
Like, what's with that? What's he doing?

43
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,500
He just hates political correctness so much.

44
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,500
That's 42's video.

45
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,500
Anyway, sorry, I don't know his name, so I'm just gonna have to call him 42.

46
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
So what do we think?

47
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,500
Well, I have two points to make in response, essentially,

48
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,500
and I can just tell you them both right now.

49
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,500
So firstly, as 42 points out, people have always been offended,

50
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,500
but his point about the millennial snowflake left being more entitled than previous generations?

51
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,500
That doesn't hold any water, I'm afraid.

52
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,500
The previous generations were just as prone to acting entitled as millennials,

53
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,500
sometimes more so, I'd argue.

54
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Secondly, 42 attributing this offended, entitled behaviour to people on the quote

55
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:44,500
far left is at best totally arbitrary and at worst betrays a severe bias.

56
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,500
As we'll see, it's incredibly easy to find a counterexample on the right wing

57
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,500
for every behaviour that he attributes to the left.

58
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,500
So, spoiler alert, that's my counterargument there.

59
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,500
It isn't just people on the left, and it isn't just the current generation.

60
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,500
But don't take my word for it, of course, let's go back through 42's video now

61
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,500
and make those same two counterarguments repeatedly and slower.

62
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,500
So we'll start with a minor point, admittedly here.

63
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,500
42 leads out by saying he doesn't usually make this kind of opinion-based video

64
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,500
being more used to making fact-based videos like

65
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,500
what Facebook really does with your data,

66
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,500
the strange habits that will make you a billionaire,

67
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,500
how one man sold the Eiffel Tower twice,

68
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,500
the ugly truth about tipping, and so on.

69
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,500
I trust you noticed the thumbnail theme.

70
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
So why do I mention that here?

71
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,500
Well, at the start of his video, while 42 is introducing the topic of discussion,

72
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:46,500
the snowflake generation who are dominating social media with their incessant entitlement,

73
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,500
he shows a series of flashing images of scrolling social media feeds,

74
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,500
which you might imagine would display the sort of thing he's talking about.

75
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,500
But if we do a little freeze-framing, we can see it's actually things like

76
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,500
the Twitter page of a camera gear company, a Finnish film production company,

77
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,500
what appears to be a search for the word awesome.

78
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,500
You know, innocuous, random things like that.

79
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,500
Now, the point you might make here is

80
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,500
if these offended snowflakes are so ubiquitous on social media,

81
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,500
why not show some of them to evidence the claim?

82
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,500
You know, why instead use unrelated stock footage

83
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,500
like you would in a video where you weren't making a serious political point, for instance?

84
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,500
Now, I get it. He's talking about social media,

85
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,500
so he includes some social media stock footage.

86
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:38,500
It's not directly relevant to his point, but it sort of suggests itself to be relevant.

87
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,500
It goes by too quickly for the viewer to notice, anyway.

88
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
It's just a little video editing trick.

89
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,500
I'm not even complaining about it, really, and it's not a point worth making by itself.

90
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,500
But stick with me, I am going somewhere with it, I promise.

91
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,500
I want now to talk about the following two clips that 42 includes in his video.

92
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,500
As he's describing the ultra-PC far-left militants,

93
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,500
he shows this clip of some sort of rally or protest in London.

94
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,500
So are these our offended snowflake generation?

95
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Well, let's take a look.

96
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Zooming in on this image, we can make out the flags of Unite and Unison,

97
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,500
which are the two largest UK trade unions.

98
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Now, they organize for workers' rights, among a whole bunch of other things.

99
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Unison were founded in the early 90s,

100
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:31,500
and mainly represent public sector workers like teachers, NHS workers, and so on.

101
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,500
Elsewhere in this march, we see a Guy Fawkes mask and signs that say,

102
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,500
we are the 99%, things associated with the Occupy movement,

103
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,500
which was itself largely a reaction to increasing economic inequality.

104
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,500
So what's my point here?

105
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,500
Well, it's telling that when 42 later tries to provide his own example

106
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
of something he could get offended about,

107
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,500
he picks something totally inconsequential, that people drink instant coffee.

108
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,500
But all of his actual examples in the video of so-called far-left millennials

109
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,500
are actually people being offended, if you can even call them that,

110
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,500
about things that are anything but inconsequential.

111
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,500
You know, these people are marching for their rights as workers.

112
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,500
They're marching against economic inequality.

113
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Those are hardly trivial topics.

114
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:23,500
So there's two video clips there that don't quite line up with what 42 is saying.

115
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,500
So let's look at the next one.

116
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,500
Is the third time a charm? Let's see.

117
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,500
So as 42 is explaining how the far-left militants are, quote,

118
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,500
hell-bent on campaigning for a cause for people they've never even met,

119
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,500
he shows this clip of a crowd at a rally.

120
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
Again, it goes by fairly quickly.

121
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,500
About all you have time to notice is the Palestinian flag in the center,

122
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:50,500
so naturally, you assume this was some sort of far-left rally in support of Palestine or suchlike.

123
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,500
And that must be what 42 is criticizing.

124
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:59,500
However, if we pause the video, we can see a few other interesting things in this crowd.

125
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:05,500
Who am I kidding? We can see one other interesting thing in this crowd, the speaker.

126
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,500
Now, most of you will have noticed by now, yes, it is.

127
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
That is Alex Jones.

128
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,500
Noted far-left millennial snowflake, Alex Jones.

129
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:23,500
No, of course, this is far-right conspiracy theorist Infowars 9-11 truther Alex Jones.

130
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,500
And I love when I find something like this.

131
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,500
You know, when I saw it was Alex Jones speaking there, I wanted to open a bottle of champagne.

132
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:37,500
So this clip is from a speech that Alex Jones gave at the 2013 Bilderberg Fringe Festival,

133
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,500
where he denounces globalists, whatever that means.

134
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:48,500
A fellow speaker was David Icke, a British conspiracy theorist who believes

135
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:55,500
that an interdimensional race of reptilian beings called the Archons have hijacked the Earth,

136
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:02,500
and that a genetically modified human-Archon hybrid race of shape-shifting reptilians,

137
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,500
also known as the Babylonian Brotherhood, you get the point?

138
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
So what does this mean?

139
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,500
Well, 42's error in evidencing his claim actually disproved his claim.

140
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,500
This isn't a far-left rally populated by people offended about something insignificant.

141
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:25,500
It's actually a far-right rally populated with people offended about the reptilian takeover of our planet.

142
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,500
So hardy-har, a mistake was made.

143
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:35,500
Again, not that big of a problem by itself, but it fits into a larger trend of 42 not providing evidence

144
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,500
of this supposedly ubiquitous snowflake generation.

145
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:45,500
And this is true of the first example of the negative effects of political correctness that he talks about,

146
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
the Fort Hood shooting.

147
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,500
So on November 5, 2009, a U.S. Army major named Nidal Hassan

148
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,500
carried out a mass shooting on a military base in Texas, killing 13 people.

149
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,500
Now, following the attack, there were investigations into how Hassan's radicalization

150
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,500
was not acted upon earlier, and the attack prevented.

151
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,500
For example, Hassan had exchanged emails with a known radical Islamist and was investigated by the FBI,

152
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,500
but they concluded that there wasn't enough information to warrant a larger investigation of him.

153
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:21,500
42 lays the blame for this failure to prevent the attack at the feet of political correctness, of course.

154
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,500
Now, I'd be skeptical of that myself, given that the U.S. Army has in recent decades

155
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,500
invaded and occupied Muslim-majority countries in the Middle East.

156
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,500
So not offending Muslims doesn't seem to be all that high on their list of priorities.

157
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,500
But whatever the reason for the FBI or Department of Defense failing to prevent the attack,

158
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:47,500
what, I would like to ask, does the attack have to do with the people 42 has been talking about thus far,

159
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,500
the snowflake millennial lefty crowd?

160
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,500
Because I don't know if 42's noticed, but those people tend not to join the military or the FBI,

161
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,500
and they certainly don't run the military or the FBI.

162
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,500
I mean, are you telling me a bunch of army generals are like,

163
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:08,500
well, we can't fire the Muslim, can we? Imagine what they'll say about us on Tumblr.

164
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:15,500
And 42 elsewhere says that the power of the snowflake generation lies in their ability to appeal to advertisers

165
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,500
to not associate with people or brands that aren't politically correct.

166
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,500
But that pressure doesn't really apply to the Department of Defense, does it?

167
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,500
You know, hashtag boycott the U.S. armed forces doesn't really work.

168
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:34,500
If you want to blame political correctness for this, you can't pin that blame on millennials or the left,

169
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,500
because they're not dictating FBI or DOD policy.

170
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Now this also holds true for the arrest and trial of Count Dankula, so let's talk about that for a little while.

171
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,500
First off, I've never liked how this was reported, this case.

172
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:55,500
Everyone always puts the pug front and center, which, you know, why wouldn't you? I get that.

173
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,500
But at Wager, it was more likely that Meachin was arrested because he put out a video in which he repeatedly says

174
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,500
see Kyle and gas the Jews while giggling.

175
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:10,500
That's the offensive part of that video, you know, not anything he taught the dog to do.

176
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,500
Anyway, I don't personally agree with Meachin being arrested.

177
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:20,500
I think there's enough people online saying gas the Jews completely seriously for the justice system to occupy its day.

178
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,500
You know, arresting Meachin was a waste of time and resources, if you ask me.

179
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,500
I also don't agree with him receiving an 800 pound fine,

180
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:36,500
though the fact that he received 100,000 pounds in donations afterwards means that I'm probably not gonna be losing any sleep about it.

181
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:43,500
Anyway, in isolation, me and 42 agree here about the Nazi pug trial, so why am I talking about it?

182
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:50,500
Well, it's because the fault lies with the justice system, the police that arrested Meachin and the courts that prosecuted him.

183
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,500
And again, a little something about millennial far-left militants.

184
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,500
They tend not to like the police very much, and they certainly don't run the court system.

185
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:07,500
You know, this incident has no place in a video about the quote, snowflake generation, because they didn't have anything to do with it.

186
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,500
If anything, this is an example of the opposite.

187
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:16,500
Meachin, himself a millennial, was prosecuted by members of the previous generation.

188
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,500
Censorship by governments is the problem, not censorship by young leftists.

189
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,500
There's no examples of those people censoring anyone in the video.

190
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,500
Let's look at this Starbucks example.

191
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:37,500
So as Mr. 42 is talking about the power of the snowflake crowd, which he says is the ability to rant and rave on social media about brands not being politically correct,

192
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,500
he shows this article from the mail online.

193
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Starbucks hit by a cascade of negativity after ordering staff to talk racism with customers,

194
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,500
vice president forced off Twitter, etc.

195
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,500
Now this article concerns Starbucks' much ridiculed Race Together campaign,

196
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:00,500
where store workers were asked to discuss race relations with customers ordering coffee.

197
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:07,500
Now, this isn't an example of a brand doing something not politically correct and offending millennial sensibilities.

198
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:16,500
This is an example of a brand attempting to market itself to those sensibilities and failing because its idea was incredibly lame.

199
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:21,500
You know, people on social media made fun of it because it was ridiculous.

200
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
So what's 42's point here?

201
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:31,500
Does he think that the Race Together campaign was a good idea and that social media users shouldn't have mocked Starbucks for it?

202
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,500
Also, I mean, it's Starbucks. I think they'll probably be okay.

203
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,500
You know, they were criticized, but they weren't censored.

204
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,500
If they self-censored in response to criticism, that's their decision.

205
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,500
Freedom of speech goes both ways.

206
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:52,500
They're free to say whatever silly thing they like, but we can't expect them to be free from being criticized for it.

207
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,500
And also, 42 is doing the exact same thing he's complaining about here.

208
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,500
He's criticizing millennials for criticizing Starbucks.

209
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,500
So if he thinks Starbucks are being censored by that criticism,

210
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:11,500
then I claim that the people censoring Starbucks are themselves being censored in turn by 42,

211
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:17,500
who I am now censoring because I'm criticizing him, one could argue,

212
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:23,500
and if you criticize me for that, then you're censoring me. It's all terrifically confusing.

213
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,500
It's just a rather odd point to defend some megacorporation against online mockery.

214
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,500
You know, why would 42 get offended on behalf of Starbucks?

215
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
They never asked him to do that.

216
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:40,500
It seems his delicate sensibilities can't handle a little light online mockery.

217
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:45,500
It's just like a millennial to take to social media to complain about comedy, eh?

218
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:50,500
It's just some jokes, 42. Comedy should have no bounds, after all.

219
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,500
Speaking of comedy, let's carry on talking about comedy.

220
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
42 says that, quote,

221
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
42 mentions Ricky Gervais here.

222
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,500
Now, I don't remember Ofcom ever censoring Ricky Gervais.

223
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,500
I remember him being under investigation for calling Susan Boyle a, quote,

224
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,500
which he was cleared by Ofcom for.

225
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,500
Now, I disagree with Ofcom there, but that doesn't really matter here, does it?

226
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
The point is that Gervais wasn't censored.

227
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,500
The government's communication regulator cleared him.

228
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,500
Now, because I'm a very old man, I also remember back in 2002,

229
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,500
when the precursor to Ofcom, the Broadcasting Standards Commission,

230
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,500
upheld a complaint about Gervais for doing a routine about genitals

231
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,500
on a lunchtime radio show on a Saturday.

232
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,500
Which, you know, is fair enough, isn't it?

233
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,500
You know, I'd imagine even Mr. Comedy Should Have No Bounds over here

234
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,500
would agree that actually, comedy should have some bounds.

235
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,500
Like, I shouldn't be able to go and play a Louis C.K. routine

236
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,500
to a classroom of five-year-olds, I think we'd all agree.

237
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,500
There does need to be some standards there.

238
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,500
42 also mentions the Pythons,

239
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,500
and particularly John Cleese's sitcom, Faulty Towers,

240
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
for having a section of its episode, The Germans,

241
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:35,500
edited out of earlier broadcasts for containing a bunch of racial slurs.

242
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,500
Now, whatever you think about that, the Pythons are an odd choice to mention

243
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,500
in a section where you claim comedians are today more censored than ever.

244
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:50,500
For example here, when Monty Python's movie, Life of Brian, came out in 1979,

245
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:55,500
it was banned outright in several countries, including parts of the UK.

246
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,500
John Cleese and Michael Palin engaged in a debate on the show

247
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,500
Friday night, Saturday morning in 1979,

248
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,500
where they defended the movie from charges of offensiveness and blasphemy.

249
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,500
So how old exactly is the Snowflake generation?

250
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,500
You know, were they around getting movies banned in the 70s?

251
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,500
Is this guy part of the Snowflake generation?

252
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,500
This is why 42's point about millennial entitlement doesn't make any sense.

253
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,500
There's absolutely nothing new about this entitled behavior.

254
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,500
Lots of people felt entitled to try to get the movie banned, and they did.

255
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:34,500
And it's another example of 42 artificially aiming his criticisms

256
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,500
at just one political wing at the expense of the other.

257
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,500
He also mentions YouTube demonetization, citing himself as an example.

258
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:49,500
But one particularly hard-hit section of YouTube is people who make content for an LGBT audience.

259
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:55,500
Videos about trans issues, for instance, are notorious for being demonetized quickly.

260
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,500
And they're hardly something you'd expect the ultra-PC millennial left to be protesting, are they?

261
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,500
A similar point can be made about stand-up comedians.

262
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:10,500
Now, when noted left-leaning British comedian Stuart Lee wrote a musical called Jerry Springer the Opera,

263
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,500
offended religious groups took to the streets to protest it.

264
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:19,500
And when the BBC broadcast the show, it received 55,000 complaints,

265
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,500
and Lee and the BBC were threatened with prosecution.

266
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:29,500
So again, acting entitled and trying to get offensive things banned is not a behavior exclusive to the young,

267
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,500
nor is it a behavior exclusive to the left.

268
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,500
If you've noticed, I'm basically just making the same two points over and over again here.

269
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,500
You're gonna have to deal with it, I'm afraid.

270
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,500
I do have a question to ask, though, following on from that last point.

271
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,500
When you hear someone refer to people who are supposedly too easily offended,

272
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:54,500
why don't we think of people like this? Or like this? Or like this?

273
00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:00,500
Why don't we mean people who call the police on a black person for having a barbecue?

274
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,500
Or sitting in a coffee shop? Or selling water? Or mowing a lawn?

275
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:11,500
Why don't we mean gamers who blow their tops about seeing a woman or a gay character in a video game trailer?

276
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:17,500
You know, why do we give bigotry a pass in the narrative of the easily offended?

277
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:23,500
We say, that's just a racist. That's just someone who hates LGBT people. That's just a misogynist.

278
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:28,500
That's just a religious fundamentalist. But the millennial snowflake left.

279
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:34,500
They're offended for no reason whatsoever. And I don't like this for a few reasons.

280
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:39,500
Firstly, it implies that there's some rational, unemotional basis for bigotry.

281
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:46,500
And second of all, it implies that the left have nothing rational to say, being driven purely by random emotional outbursts.

282
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,500
Which is, of course, the reason why this narrative exists.

283
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:56,500
To push that idea as far and wide as possible, utilizing hapless chaps like 42 here.

284
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:03,500
But when you look at what the supposed snowflake generation are actually talking about, it's workers' rights.

285
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:08,500
It's minority representation, economic equality, and so on.

286
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:14,500
There's nothing in this video on the level of triviality as being offended by instant coffee.

287
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:21,500
42 closes out his video with speculation as to why the current generation are apparently so offended and entitled.

288
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,500
And he says it's because they've never known what it's like to not have everything.

289
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:31,500
They've never known war, or oppression, or poverty. They're spoiled, basically.

290
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:37,500
Now I imagine there's plenty of young soldiers in the military who disagree readily with this YouTube chap,

291
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:43,500
telling them that they've never known war, given, you know, all of recent history.

292
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:50,500
But even besides them, this idea that the current generation has everything too easy is just complete rubbish.

293
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:57,500
Compared to their parents, millennials have lower average wages, they work longer hours, they have less stable jobs,

294
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:03,500
they're in more debt, they pay more in rent, they pay more for houses, they're less likely to be promoted.

295
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:09,500
They entered the workforce around the time of the worst economic downturn in a century.

296
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,500
If they're angry, if they're emotional, they've got reasons for that.

297
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:19,500
Even the person that was unflatteringly screen-capped for the thumbnail of this video

298
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:24,500
in order to represent the typical offended millennial, well, I went and found where that's from.

299
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,500
And they're arguing at a rally with a Trump supporter who's just called immigrants rapists.

300
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:35,500
Now that's a political argument. It's a valid reason to be offended and to get angry.

301
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,500
Just like your rights as a worker being threatened, or your reproductive rights being threatened,

302
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:47,500
or your rights as an LGBT person being threatened, or the reptilian Illuminati who control the banking system.

303
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:53,500
If you dismiss political activism as belonging solely to the easily offended and overly emotional,

304
00:22:53,500 --> 00:23:00,500
you've been sold a false narrative designed to neutralize you by someone, probably an older and richer person than you,

305
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,500
who'd prefer it if you just kept quiet and did what you were told.

306
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:10,500
So that's about it from me today, folks. Am I really gonna close out with a callback to the lizard men thing?

307
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,500
Yes, I am gonna do that. I hope you enjoyed this video.

308
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:21,500
If you didn't, that's because you're offended by what I have to say and maybe you should work on being a little more rational.

309
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:27,500
Thanks as always to all my supporters over on Patreon who pay for these videos, even though they're free.

310
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:32,500
No one tell them that though, please. I'm kind of dependent on the income at this point.

311
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,500
