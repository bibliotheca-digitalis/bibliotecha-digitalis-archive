0	7500	Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about a narrative, the narrative of the snowflake generation,
7500	11000	which actually has a Wikipedia page, I was surprised to learn,
11000	17500	a term used to characterize the young adults of the 2010s as being more prone to taking offense
17500	22500	and less resilient than previous generations, or as being too emotionally vulnerable
22500	25500	to cope with views that challenge their own.
25500	29500	Now, in this video, I'll explain why this characterization is not true.
29500	32500	Sort of almost completely made up, actually,
32500	37500	and assisting me today by providing a textbook example of this argument is 42,
37500	42500	a YouTube talky man with 2.4 million subscribers.
42500	45500	I'll be taking a look at his video entitled,
45500	51500	Why Is Everyone Getting So Offended, currently with close to 650,000 views.
51500	55500	Now, as always, I'd encourage you to watch his video first,
55500	58500	so you can be sure I don't misrepresent his argument,
58500	61500	which I understand goes as follows.
61500	66500	So 42's video starts off with him identifying the Snowflake Generation,
66500	67500	a group of, quote,
73500	78500	He then gives an example of a time when he says political correctness had fatal consequences
78500	82500	by talking about the 2009 Fort Hood shooting,
82500	84500	arguing that the attack could have been prevented,
84500	88500	but that political correctness stopped the US Army from taking action.
88500	92500	He then moves on to talk censorship of comedians and comedy shows,
92500	95500	such as Monty Python and Faulty Towers.
95500	97500	He then argues that comedy should have no bounds,
97500	102500	and that criticizing offensive comedians amounts to censoring their freedom of speech.
102500	107500	42 then talks about how, due to the Snowflake Generation's social media use,
107500	112500	advertisers don't want to advertise on shows that are deemed too offensive,
112500	114500	citing YouTube as an example,
114500	120500	and mentioning his own channel as one that's had videos demonetized for not being advertiser-friendly.
120500	123500	He then moves on to say that being offended is natural,
123500	125500	and people have always been offended by things,
125500	130500	but the difference today is that the Snowflake Generation millennials are acting entitled.
130500	136500	You see, they've apparently grown up in a time free of violent war, oppression, and poverty,
136500	140500	and as a result, they don't know what it's like to not get everything they want.
140500	144500	He then moves on to talk about how he's offended by instant coffee,
144500	149500	but it would be ridiculous of him to campaign against it or try to get it banned.
149500	153500	Then 42 spends a while talking about the recent court case in Scotland,
153500	156500	where Internet personality Count Dankula
156500	158500	– I will never get tired of saying that –
158500	162500	was fined for making an offensive YouTube video.
162500	168500	Then he closes out with a rousing speech about standing up for yourself against the evils of political correctness,
168500	173500	set to footage of a man running on a beach and punching the air triumphantly.
173500	176500	Like, what's with that? What's he doing?
176500	179500	He just hates political correctness so much.
179500	181500	That's 42's video.
181500	185500	Anyway, sorry, I don't know his name, so I'm just gonna have to call him 42.
185500	187500	So what do we think?
187500	190500	Well, I have two points to make in response, essentially,
190500	192500	and I can just tell you them both right now.
192500	196500	So firstly, as 42 points out, people have always been offended,
197500	202500	but his point about the millennial snowflake left being more entitled than previous generations?
202500	205500	That doesn't hold any water, I'm afraid.
205500	209500	The previous generations were just as prone to acting entitled as millennials,
209500	212500	sometimes more so, I'd argue.
212500	218500	Secondly, 42 attributing this offended, entitled behaviour to people on the quote
218500	224500	far left is at best totally arbitrary and at worst betrays a severe bias.
224500	228500	As we'll see, it's incredibly easy to find a counterexample on the right wing
228500	231500	for every behaviour that he attributes to the left.
231500	235500	So, spoiler alert, that's my counterargument there.
235500	239500	It isn't just people on the left, and it isn't just the current generation.
239500	243500	But don't take my word for it, of course, let's go back through 42's video now
243500	248500	and make those same two counterarguments repeatedly and slower.
248500	251500	So we'll start with a minor point, admittedly here.
252500	256500	42 leads out by saying he doesn't usually make this kind of opinion-based video
256500	259500	being more used to making fact-based videos like
259500	262500	what Facebook really does with your data,
262500	265500	the strange habits that will make you a billionaire,
265500	268500	how one man sold the Eiffel Tower twice,
268500	271500	the ugly truth about tipping, and so on.
271500	274500	I trust you noticed the thumbnail theme.
274500	276500	So why do I mention that here?
276500	280500	Well, at the start of his video, while 42 is introducing the topic of discussion,
280500	286500	the snowflake generation who are dominating social media with their incessant entitlement,
286500	290500	he shows a series of flashing images of scrolling social media feeds,
290500	295500	which you might imagine would display the sort of thing he's talking about.
295500	298500	But if we do a little freeze-framing, we can see it's actually things like
298500	303500	the Twitter page of a camera gear company, a Finnish film production company,
303500	306500	what appears to be a search for the word awesome.
306500	309500	You know, innocuous, random things like that.
309500	311500	Now, the point you might make here is
311500	315500	if these offended snowflakes are so ubiquitous on social media,
315500	319500	why not show some of them to evidence the claim?
319500	322500	You know, why instead use unrelated stock footage
322500	327500	like you would in a video where you weren't making a serious political point, for instance?
327500	330500	Now, I get it. He's talking about social media,
330500	332500	so he includes some social media stock footage.
332500	338500	It's not directly relevant to his point, but it sort of suggests itself to be relevant.
338500	341500	It goes by too quickly for the viewer to notice, anyway.
341500	343500	It's just a little video editing trick.
343500	348500	I'm not even complaining about it, really, and it's not a point worth making by itself.
348500	352500	But stick with me, I am going somewhere with it, I promise.
352500	357500	I want now to talk about the following two clips that 42 includes in his video.
357500	361500	As he's describing the ultra-PC far-left militants,
361500	365500	he shows this clip of some sort of rally or protest in London.
365500	369500	So are these our offended snowflake generation?
369500	370500	Well, let's take a look.
370500	375500	Zooming in on this image, we can make out the flags of Unite and Unison,
375500	378500	which are the two largest UK trade unions.
378500	383500	Now, they organize for workers' rights, among a whole bunch of other things.
383500	385500	Unison were founded in the early 90s,
385500	391500	and mainly represent public sector workers like teachers, NHS workers, and so on.
391500	395500	Elsewhere in this march, we see a Guy Fawkes mask and signs that say,
395500	400500	we are the 99%, things associated with the Occupy movement,
400500	405500	which was itself largely a reaction to increasing economic inequality.
405500	406500	So what's my point here?
406500	410500	Well, it's telling that when 42 later tries to provide his own example
410500	412500	of something he could get offended about,
412500	417500	he picks something totally inconsequential, that people drink instant coffee.
417500	422500	But all of his actual examples in the video of so-called far-left millennials
422500	426500	are actually people being offended, if you can even call them that,
426500	429500	about things that are anything but inconsequential.
429500	432500	You know, these people are marching for their rights as workers.
432500	435500	They're marching against economic inequality.
435500	437500	Those are hardly trivial topics.
437500	443500	So there's two video clips there that don't quite line up with what 42 is saying.
443500	444500	So let's look at the next one.
444500	447500	Is the third time a charm? Let's see.
447500	451500	So as 42 is explaining how the far-left militants are, quote,
451500	455500	hell-bent on campaigning for a cause for people they've never even met,
455500	458500	he shows this clip of a crowd at a rally.
458500	460500	Again, it goes by fairly quickly.
460500	464500	About all you have time to notice is the Palestinian flag in the center,
464500	470500	so naturally, you assume this was some sort of far-left rally in support of Palestine or suchlike.
470500	473500	And that must be what 42 is criticizing.
473500	479500	However, if we pause the video, we can see a few other interesting things in this crowd.
479500	485500	Who am I kidding? We can see one other interesting thing in this crowd, the speaker.
485500	489500	Now, most of you will have noticed by now, yes, it is.
489500	491500	That is Alex Jones.
491500	496500	Noted far-left millennial snowflake, Alex Jones.
496500	503500	No, of course, this is far-right conspiracy theorist Infowars 9-11 truther Alex Jones.
503500	506500	And I love when I find something like this.
506500	511500	You know, when I saw it was Alex Jones speaking there, I wanted to open a bottle of champagne.
511500	517500	So this clip is from a speech that Alex Jones gave at the 2013 Bilderberg Fringe Festival,
517500	522500	where he denounces globalists, whatever that means.
522500	528500	A fellow speaker was David Icke, a British conspiracy theorist who believes
528500	535500	that an interdimensional race of reptilian beings called the Archons have hijacked the Earth,
535500	542500	and that a genetically modified human-Archon hybrid race of shape-shifting reptilians,
542500	546500	also known as the Babylonian Brotherhood, you get the point?
546500	548500	So what does this mean?
548500	553500	Well, 42's error in evidencing his claim actually disproved his claim.
553500	558500	This isn't a far-left rally populated by people offended about something insignificant.
558500	565500	It's actually a far-right rally populated with people offended about the reptilian takeover of our planet.
565500	568500	So hardy-har, a mistake was made.
568500	575500	Again, not that big of a problem by itself, but it fits into a larger trend of 42 not providing evidence
575500	579500	of this supposedly ubiquitous snowflake generation.
579500	585500	And this is true of the first example of the negative effects of political correctness that he talks about,
585500	587500	the Fort Hood shooting.
587500	592500	So on November 5, 2009, a U.S. Army major named Nidal Hassan
592500	596500	carried out a mass shooting on a military base in Texas, killing 13 people.
596500	601500	Now, following the attack, there were investigations into how Hassan's radicalization
601500	604500	was not acted upon earlier, and the attack prevented.
604500	610500	For example, Hassan had exchanged emails with a known radical Islamist and was investigated by the FBI,
610500	615500	but they concluded that there wasn't enough information to warrant a larger investigation of him.
615500	621500	42 lays the blame for this failure to prevent the attack at the feet of political correctness, of course.
621500	626500	Now, I'd be skeptical of that myself, given that the U.S. Army has in recent decades
626500	630500	invaded and occupied Muslim-majority countries in the Middle East.
630500	635500	So not offending Muslims doesn't seem to be all that high on their list of priorities.
635500	640500	But whatever the reason for the FBI or Department of Defense failing to prevent the attack,
640500	647500	what, I would like to ask, does the attack have to do with the people 42 has been talking about thus far,
647500	650500	the snowflake millennial lefty crowd?
650500	655500	Because I don't know if 42's noticed, but those people tend not to join the military or the FBI,
655500	659500	and they certainly don't run the military or the FBI.
659500	662500	I mean, are you telling me a bunch of army generals are like,
662500	668500	well, we can't fire the Muslim, can we? Imagine what they'll say about us on Tumblr.
668500	675500	And 42 elsewhere says that the power of the snowflake generation lies in their ability to appeal to advertisers
675500	679500	to not associate with people or brands that aren't politically correct.
679500	683500	But that pressure doesn't really apply to the Department of Defense, does it?
683500	688500	You know, hashtag boycott the U.S. armed forces doesn't really work.
688500	694500	If you want to blame political correctness for this, you can't pin that blame on millennials or the left,
694500	698500	because they're not dictating FBI or DOD policy.
698500	705500	Now this also holds true for the arrest and trial of Count Dankula, so let's talk about that for a little while.
705500	709500	First off, I've never liked how this was reported, this case.
709500	715500	Everyone always puts the pug front and center, which, you know, why wouldn't you? I get that.
715500	721500	But at Wager, it was more likely that Meachin was arrested because he put out a video in which he repeatedly says
721500	725500	see Kyle and gas the Jews while giggling.
725500	730500	That's the offensive part of that video, you know, not anything he taught the dog to do.
730500	733500	Anyway, I don't personally agree with Meachin being arrested.
733500	740500	I think there's enough people online saying gas the Jews completely seriously for the justice system to occupy its day.
740500	745500	You know, arresting Meachin was a waste of time and resources, if you ask me.
745500	748500	I also don't agree with him receiving an 800 pound fine,
748500	756500	though the fact that he received 100,000 pounds in donations afterwards means that I'm probably not gonna be losing any sleep about it.
756500	763500	Anyway, in isolation, me and 42 agree here about the Nazi pug trial, so why am I talking about it?
763500	770500	Well, it's because the fault lies with the justice system, the police that arrested Meachin and the courts that prosecuted him.
770500	774500	And again, a little something about millennial far-left militants.
774500	779500	They tend not to like the police very much, and they certainly don't run the court system.
779500	787500	You know, this incident has no place in a video about the quote, snowflake generation, because they didn't have anything to do with it.
787500	790500	If anything, this is an example of the opposite.
790500	796500	Meachin, himself a millennial, was prosecuted by members of the previous generation.
796500	801500	Censorship by governments is the problem, not censorship by young leftists.
801500	805500	There's no examples of those people censoring anyone in the video.
805500	807500	Let's look at this Starbucks example.
808500	817500	So as Mr. 42 is talking about the power of the snowflake crowd, which he says is the ability to rant and rave on social media about brands not being politically correct,
817500	820500	he shows this article from the mail online.
820500	826500	Starbucks hit by a cascade of negativity after ordering staff to talk racism with customers,
826500	829500	vice president forced off Twitter, etc.
829500	834500	Now this article concerns Starbucks' much ridiculed Race Together campaign,
834500	840500	where store workers were asked to discuss race relations with customers ordering coffee.
840500	847500	Now, this isn't an example of a brand doing something not politically correct and offending millennial sensibilities.
847500	856500	This is an example of a brand attempting to market itself to those sensibilities and failing because its idea was incredibly lame.
856500	861500	You know, people on social media made fun of it because it was ridiculous.
861500	863500	So what's 42's point here?
863500	871500	Does he think that the Race Together campaign was a good idea and that social media users shouldn't have mocked Starbucks for it?
871500	875500	Also, I mean, it's Starbucks. I think they'll probably be okay.
875500	879500	You know, they were criticized, but they weren't censored.
879500	883500	If they self-censored in response to criticism, that's their decision.
883500	886500	Freedom of speech goes both ways.
886500	892500	They're free to say whatever silly thing they like, but we can't expect them to be free from being criticized for it.
892500	897500	And also, 42 is doing the exact same thing he's complaining about here.
897500	901500	He's criticizing millennials for criticizing Starbucks.
902500	905500	So if he thinks Starbucks are being censored by that criticism,
905500	911500	then I claim that the people censoring Starbucks are themselves being censored in turn by 42,
911500	917500	who I am now censoring because I'm criticizing him, one could argue,
917500	923500	and if you criticize me for that, then you're censoring me. It's all terrifically confusing.
923500	928500	It's just a rather odd point to defend some megacorporation against online mockery.
928500	932500	You know, why would 42 get offended on behalf of Starbucks?
932500	934500	They never asked him to do that.
934500	940500	It seems his delicate sensibilities can't handle a little light online mockery.
940500	945500	It's just like a millennial to take to social media to complain about comedy, eh?
945500	950500	It's just some jokes, 42. Comedy should have no bounds, after all.
950500	954500	Speaking of comedy, let's carry on talking about comedy.
954500	956500	42 says that, quote,
970500	972500	42 mentions Ricky Gervais here.
972500	975500	Now, I don't remember Ofcom ever censoring Ricky Gervais.
975500	980500	I remember him being under investigation for calling Susan Boyle a, quote,
981500	984500	which he was cleared by Ofcom for.
998500	1002500	Now, I disagree with Ofcom there, but that doesn't really matter here, does it?
1002500	1004500	The point is that Gervais wasn't censored.
1004500	1007500	The government's communication regulator cleared him.
1007500	1011500	Now, because I'm a very old man, I also remember back in 2002,
1011500	1015500	when the precursor to Ofcom, the Broadcasting Standards Commission,
1015500	1019500	upheld a complaint about Gervais for doing a routine about genitals
1019500	1023500	on a lunchtime radio show on a Saturday.
1023500	1026500	Which, you know, is fair enough, isn't it?
1026500	1029500	You know, I'd imagine even Mr. Comedy Should Have No Bounds over here
1029500	1033500	would agree that actually, comedy should have some bounds.
1033500	1036500	Like, I shouldn't be able to go and play a Louis C.K. routine
1036500	1039500	to a classroom of five-year-olds, I think we'd all agree.
1039500	1042500	There does need to be some standards there.
1042500	1045500	42 also mentions the Pythons,
1045500	1048500	and particularly John Cleese's sitcom, Faulty Towers,
1048500	1050500	for having a section of its episode, The Germans,
1050500	1055500	edited out of earlier broadcasts for containing a bunch of racial slurs.
1055500	1059500	Now, whatever you think about that, the Pythons are an odd choice to mention
1059500	1064500	in a section where you claim comedians are today more censored than ever.
1064500	1070500	For example here, when Monty Python's movie, Life of Brian, came out in 1979,
1070500	1075500	it was banned outright in several countries, including parts of the UK.
1075500	1078500	John Cleese and Michael Palin engaged in a debate on the show
1078500	1082500	Friday night, Saturday morning in 1979,
1082500	1086500	where they defended the movie from charges of offensiveness and blasphemy.
1086500	1089500	So how old exactly is the Snowflake generation?
1089500	1093500	You know, were they around getting movies banned in the 70s?
1093500	1096500	Is this guy part of the Snowflake generation?
1096500	1101500	This is why 42's point about millennial entitlement doesn't make any sense.
1101500	1105500	There's absolutely nothing new about this entitled behavior.
1105500	1109500	Lots of people felt entitled to try to get the movie banned, and they did.
1109500	1114500	And it's another example of 42 artificially aiming his criticisms
1114500	1118500	at just one political wing at the expense of the other.
1118500	1123500	He also mentions YouTube demonetization, citing himself as an example.
1123500	1129500	But one particularly hard-hit section of YouTube is people who make content for an LGBT audience.
1129500	1135500	Videos about trans issues, for instance, are notorious for being demonetized quickly.
1135500	1140500	And they're hardly something you'd expect the ultra-PC millennial left to be protesting, are they?
1140500	1143500	A similar point can be made about stand-up comedians.
1143500	1150500	Now, when noted left-leaning British comedian Stuart Lee wrote a musical called Jerry Springer the Opera,
1150500	1154500	offended religious groups took to the streets to protest it.
1154500	1159500	And when the BBC broadcast the show, it received 55,000 complaints,
1159500	1162500	and Lee and the BBC were threatened with prosecution.
1162500	1169500	So again, acting entitled and trying to get offensive things banned is not a behavior exclusive to the young,
1169500	1172500	nor is it a behavior exclusive to the left.
1172500	1176500	If you've noticed, I'm basically just making the same two points over and over again here.
1176500	1179500	You're gonna have to deal with it, I'm afraid.
1179500	1183500	I do have a question to ask, though, following on from that last point.
1183500	1188500	When you hear someone refer to people who are supposedly too easily offended,
1188500	1194500	why don't we think of people like this? Or like this? Or like this?
1194500	1200500	Why don't we mean people who call the police on a black person for having a barbecue?
1200500	1205500	Or sitting in a coffee shop? Or selling water? Or mowing a lawn?
1205500	1211500	Why don't we mean gamers who blow their tops about seeing a woman or a gay character in a video game trailer?
1211500	1217500	You know, why do we give bigotry a pass in the narrative of the easily offended?
1217500	1223500	We say, that's just a racist. That's just someone who hates LGBT people. That's just a misogynist.
1223500	1228500	That's just a religious fundamentalist. But the millennial snowflake left.
1228500	1234500	They're offended for no reason whatsoever. And I don't like this for a few reasons.
1234500	1239500	Firstly, it implies that there's some rational, unemotional basis for bigotry.
1239500	1246500	And second of all, it implies that the left have nothing rational to say, being driven purely by random emotional outbursts.
1246500	1250500	Which is, of course, the reason why this narrative exists.
1250500	1256500	To push that idea as far and wide as possible, utilizing hapless chaps like 42 here.
1256500	1263500	But when you look at what the supposed snowflake generation are actually talking about, it's workers' rights.
1263500	1268500	It's minority representation, economic equality, and so on.
1268500	1274500	There's nothing in this video on the level of triviality as being offended by instant coffee.
1274500	1281500	42 closes out his video with speculation as to why the current generation are apparently so offended and entitled.
1281500	1286500	And he says it's because they've never known what it's like to not have everything.
1286500	1291500	They've never known war, or oppression, or poverty. They're spoiled, basically.
1291500	1297500	Now I imagine there's plenty of young soldiers in the military who disagree readily with this YouTube chap,
1297500	1303500	telling them that they've never known war, given, you know, all of recent history.
1303500	1310500	But even besides them, this idea that the current generation has everything too easy is just complete rubbish.
1310500	1317500	Compared to their parents, millennials have lower average wages, they work longer hours, they have less stable jobs,
1317500	1323500	they're in more debt, they pay more in rent, they pay more for houses, they're less likely to be promoted.
1323500	1329500	They entered the workforce around the time of the worst economic downturn in a century.
1329500	1334500	If they're angry, if they're emotional, they've got reasons for that.
1334500	1339500	Even the person that was unflatteringly screen-capped for the thumbnail of this video
1339500	1344500	in order to represent the typical offended millennial, well, I went and found where that's from.
1344500	1349500	And they're arguing at a rally with a Trump supporter who's just called immigrants rapists.
1349500	1355500	Now that's a political argument. It's a valid reason to be offended and to get angry.
1355500	1360500	Just like your rights as a worker being threatened, or your reproductive rights being threatened,
1360500	1367500	or your rights as an LGBT person being threatened, or the reptilian Illuminati who control the banking system.
1367500	1373500	If you dismiss political activism as belonging solely to the easily offended and overly emotional,
1373500	1380500	you've been sold a false narrative designed to neutralize you by someone, probably an older and richer person than you,
1380500	1384500	who'd prefer it if you just kept quiet and did what you were told.
1384500	1390500	So that's about it from me today, folks. Am I really gonna close out with a callback to the lizard men thing?
1390500	1394500	Yes, I am gonna do that. I hope you enjoyed this video.
1394500	1401500	If you didn't, that's because you're offended by what I have to say and maybe you should work on being a little more rational.
1401500	1407500	Thanks as always to all my supporters over on Patreon who pay for these videos, even though they're free.
1407500	1412500	No one tell them that though, please. I'm kind of dependent on the income at this point.
1412500	1415500	If you'd like to join them, please feel free.
1415500	1421500	The feeling of triumph after signing up is akin to running along a beach and punching the air in joy,
1421500	1423500	if that goes any way to persuading you.
1423500	1428500	I also have a Twitter and a curious cat if you fancy sending me a question.
1428500	1432500	Also, yes, I know this video isn't the video I said I was gonna make next,
1432500	1436500	but I changed my mind because I saw Alex Jones in the clip earlier and I was like,
1436500	1443500	Oh, I have to make that video. The other video is on the way though. I promise. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm such a failure.
