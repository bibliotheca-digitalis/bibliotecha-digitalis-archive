0	4000	Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about Harry Potter.
4000	8600	Now, I could do the standard video essay introduction for Harry Potter, you know?
8600	14800	It's a series of books, a series of films, video games, a stage play, a whole bunch of merchandise and all that,
14800	18000	but we all know who Harry Potter is, right?
18000	23000	It'd be better if I started by explaining why I want to talk about Harry Potter today.
23000	24600	And there's a few reasons.
24600	29900	Firstly, there was recently another round of discussion about J.K. Rowling's goblins.
29900	36500	In recent years, there's a few different types of discourse relating to Harry Potter that come and go on social media.
36500	41700	People talk about Rowling's goblins being possibly similar to anti-Semitic stereotypes.
41700	46700	People talk about the problematic natural slave race who like their slavery,
46700	53500	the queer baiting with characters who were stated by Rowling to be gay but never explicitly depicted as gay,
53500	59800	her attempts to retroactively add more diversity to the Harry Potter world than she initially depicted,
59800	61800	and a whole host of other topics.
61800	70500	This drive to re-examine and criticize Harry Potter is undoubtedly fueled, to some extent, by the actions of the author in recent years.
70500	77000	J.K. Rowling is a committed and very vocal opponent of trans rights and, well, I'm not gonna rehash all that here.
77000	83300	There are several videos on YouTube which thoroughly cover J.K. Rowling's transphobia, and I'll link some of those below.
83300	92600	But for our purposes today, all we need to know is that J.K. Rowling's statements on trans rights have put her at odds with a lot of people who previously enjoyed her work.
92600	95600	And people naturally want to work that out, right?
95600	101100	How could a children's book author who wrote such a beloved series go on to be such a bigot?
101100	104100	Perhaps the signs were there all along.
104100	109800	Now, whenever it comes time to re-examine the Harry Potter series, I confess I feel very left out.
109800	115600	I read the first three, maybe four books as a young lad, but then I guess I got too old for them.
115600	119300	Or maybe they just got too long. She really got away from the editors at some point.
119300	121600	Those later books can be a real slog.
121600	127600	But still, I wanted to know how fair are these criticisms of Harry Potter? Do they hold water?
127600	132300	Now, it wouldn't be exactly fair for me to start offering opinions having not read the books.
132300	140300	So, I went and read the Harry Potter books, I watched the movies, I watched the Fantastic Beasts movies, which were rubbish and weird.
140300	146800	I read a whole bunch of Pottermore articles, the short stories from Hogwarts, the script of the stage play.
146800	151800	I even read the casual vacancy and a few bits here and there of Rowling's detective series.
151800	159800	What all this means is I am now a certified Harry Potter expert, and I can get involved in the discourse entirely guilt-free.
159800	164300	So, I'm going to do my own Harry Potter discourse retrospective today.
164300	169800	There's a lot to talk about, and I think it's only fitting that we begin at the beginning.
169800	177300	So, at the beginning of the first Harry Potter novel, The Philosopher's Stone, we are introduced to Harry's aunt and uncle, the Dursleys.
177300	187300	And we follow his uncle Vernon Dursley as he goes about his day, noticing various magical folk celebrating the apparent demise of series antagonist Lord Voldemort.
187300	191800	Now, what do we learn about Vernon Dursley in the opening chapters of the first Harry Potter book?
191800	198800	Well, he's quick to anger, he is narrow-minded, he dislikes anything out of the ordinary or improper,
198800	202800	and he's bigoted towards people he sees as being different from himself.
202800	209800	He's a conservative, basically. He and his wife are Rowling's liberal skewering of typical conservatives.
209800	213800	She even has Vernon reading the Daily Mail in a later book.
213800	220800	Vernon is verbally and physically abusive to Harry because Harry is a little magical lad, and Vernon hates magic.
220800	227800	He wants the magical and non-magical worlds to stay far apart, and he's willing to go to extremes to keep them that way.
227800	233800	We're also introduced to Harry's cousin Dudley, who is a spoiled bully who is also abusive to Harry.
233800	241300	Dudley is going to a fancy private school, Smeltings, whereas Harry is going to Stonewall High, the local comprehensive,
241300	244300	which Dudley implies is rough and full of bullies.
244300	251300	Now, do I think it was intentional that Rowling called the scary school for paws that Harry is worried about attending Stonewall?
251300	254300	Probably not, but it is funny now.
254300	259300	Now, Harry's first contact with the wizarding world, once he's older than a baby, that is,
259300	263800	is Hagrid, who turns up to deliver Harry's invitation to attend Hogwarts.
263800	270300	Now, as he's introduced to us here, Hagrid is, in many regards, exactly the same as Vernon Dursley.
270300	277800	Now, if any Harry Potter fans are listening, I'm sure you just raised an eyebrow at me comparing lovable old Hagrid to Harry's uncle, Vernon.
277800	282800	But if we examine their actions and their beliefs, they are, in many ways, a mirror of each other.
282800	288800	Hagrid is quick to anger. He threatens Vernon physically after he insults Albus Dumbledore.
288800	296300	Hagrid is physically abusive. He uses magic to disfigure a child because he's having an argument with his father.
296300	300300	He gives Dudley a pig's tail, which has to be removed with surgery.
300300	303300	Hagrid doesn't like people who are different from him.
303300	308800	Muggles. He uses the word muggle not just as a descriptor, but as an insult.
308800	312300	It means mundane, dull, and unspecial.
312300	318800	Hagrid wants the magical and non-magical worlds to stay far apart, and he's willing to support extremes to keep it that way.
318800	323800	When Harry asks why the Ministry of Magic works to keep the existence of magic a secret,
323800	324800	Hagrid responds,
331800	337300	One of Hagrid's functions in his introduction to Harry here is to serve as comeuppance for the Dursleys,
337300	339800	to give them a taste of their own medicine.
339800	343800	Hagrid and his magic are divine retribution.
343800	347800	Dudley likes to bully people, so he gets bullied by Hagrid.
347800	353300	Dudley was going to a fancier school than Harry, now Harry is going to a fancier school than him.
353300	359800	Vernon likes to other those different to him, and so he gets othered by Hagrid, made into a muggle.
359800	364300	Now, while it might be satisfying from the audience's perspective to watch Dudley,
364300	367800	who they know is a bully, be treated the way he treats others,
367800	372800	from Hagrid's perspective, he's just disfiguring a child he just met, you know?
372800	380800	A similar scene happens in the fourth book, when Fred and George Weasley poison Dudley with a sweep that makes his tongue grow to be a foot long.
380800	385300	And then the next chapter opens with Harry and the Weasleys all laughing at Dudley.
385300	387300	Now, this is strange.
387300	393300	Firstly, the Weasley twins have never met Dudley before, so they poison him off second-hand information, basically.
393300	399800	But also it's strange because Rowling forgets to have Dudley do anything bad in the opening of the fourth book.
399800	402800	He doesn't do anything to Harry or anyone else.
402800	407300	Rowling's just coasting off his previous bad behavior in the earlier books.
407300	409300	Well, actually, I tell a lie.
409300	415300	Dudley does do one thing that J.K. Rowling considers to be very bad and worthy of punishment,
415300	417800	and that is be overweight.
417800	424300	Just in Goblet of Fire, for instance, we're treated to descriptions of Dudley being as big as a young killer whale,
424300	428800	being wider than he is tall, too fat to hide behind his parents.
428800	434800	We hear about his porky hands, his piggy eyes, his massive backside.
434800	439300	And the comic relief of the opening chapters is that Dudley is struggling to stay on a diet.
439300	444800	Harry even mocks him about this before sneaking off to eat some cakes that he's concealed.
444800	449300	This is all why it's funny that Dudley later eats a poisoned sweet.
449300	450800	I suppose.
450800	454300	This is one of the things that really jumped out at me reading the Harry Potter books,
454300	461300	just how much time is devoted early on in each story to making fun of Dudley for being overweight.
461300	464800	Rowling just really seems to have it in for fat people,
464800	469300	and she gets worse in the casual vacancy published after the Harry Potter books
469300	472800	when one unsympathetic character is introduced in the following way.
472800	475800	He was an extravagantly obese man of 64.
475800	479800	A great apron of stomach fell so far down in front of his thighs
479800	484300	that most people thought instantly of his penis when they first clapped eyes on him,
484300	487800	wondering when he had last seen it, how he washed it,
487800	491800	how he managed to perform any of the acts for which a penis is designed.
491800	497300	Now, I think it's very telling that Rowling would write that most people think things like this when,
497300	501300	well, I can only speak for myself here, but if I see an obese guy,
501300	504800	I don't immediately start thinking about him washing his penis.
504800	509300	But JK Rowling does, so we know that now.
509300	512300	Rowling has defended her presentation of fat characters
512300	515800	by pointing to characters like Molly Weasley, who is overweight,
515800	518300	but this is rubbish, honestly.
518300	522300	There's a big difference between presenting a disgusting fat character
522300	525800	greedily stuffing their piggy face like Dudley,
525800	529800	and presenting a jolly plump character, which is what Molly is.
529800	532800	Molly is described as plump.
532800	536800	One of the things I much preferred about the way the movies tell the Harry Potter story
536800	542300	is that they cut out a lot of the general meanness and cruelty that exist in the books.
542300	545300	Rowling doesn't just mock overweight characters.
545300	548300	If a character's supposed to be unsympathetic in the books,
548300	551800	the gloves come off with regards to physical descriptions.
551800	554800	For instance, consider the Slytherin girl who, quote,
554800	558800	"...reminded Harry of a picture he'd seen in Holidays with hags.
558800	562800	She was large and square, and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively."
562800	568800	Reporter Rita Skeeter also has hair that contrasts oddly with her heavy-jawed face,
568800	572300	and we elsewhere hear about her large, mannish hands.
572300	574300	Vernon's sister Marge is, quote,
574300	578300	"...large, beefy, purple-faced, and even had a moustache."
578300	580800	If a character is supposed to be bad,
580800	584300	then Rowling usually presents them as being physically ugly,
584300	588800	and for women, the way she makes them ugly is to make them large and masculine.
588800	592800	And if this all sounds misogynistic, it's because it is.
592800	597800	Even beyond physical descriptions, the characters themselves, even Harry and his friends,
597800	602800	have a real mean streak in the books that was largely excised in the movies.
602800	604800	And let's look at one example of this.
604800	606800	There's a scene in The Order of the Phoenix
606800	612300	where the evil Dolores Umbridge fires the Hogwarts divination teacher, Professor Trelawney,
612300	614300	and tries to have her evicted from the school.
614300	618300	This scene is depicted rather differently in the book than in the movie.
618300	621300	In the movie, Trelawney is more of a sympathetic figure.
621300	624300	She's supposed to come across as helpless and frail,
624300	626800	someone who it would be especially cruel to bully,
626800	629800	to highlight just how awful Umbridge is being.
629800	633300	In this scene in the books, Trelawney is ranting, drunk,
633300	635800	and waving a sherry bottle around her head,
635800	637800	because in the books, she's an alcoholic,
637800	640800	because that's funny, isn't it? Alcoholism.
640800	645300	The movie has Harry and Hermione looking on all sad at this obvious injustice,
645300	647800	whereas in the books, they don't really care.
647800	649300	They don't like Trelawney.
649300	651300	Hermione even outright states,
651300	655300	I don't care if she throws out Trelawney, but she's not taking Hagrid.
655300	660300	The movies take the approach that while Trelawney might be annoying and a bit of a fraud,
660300	663300	she isn't evil. She isn't a bad person.
663300	666300	She doesn't actually deserve to be humiliated.
666300	669300	She's still part of Hogwarts, right?
669300	674300	The movies understand that the audience will still have sympathy for her if she's treated unfairly,
674300	676800	even if she happens to be annoying.
676800	682800	In the books, however, Trelawney mostly just pops up whenever J.K. Rowling wants to make fun of alcoholism.
682800	686800	Rowling does not expect the audience to have sympathy for Trelawney.
686800	691800	She's annoying and a bit of a fraud, so it's open season to be as cruel as you like.
691800	696300	Movie Hermione looks like she's about to cry when she sees Trelawney get fired.
696300	701300	Book Hermione could watch Professor Trelawney be slowly beaten to death by a Bludger,
701300	703300	and she wouldn't feel a single thing.
703300	705800	Anyway, let's move on by asking a question.
705800	711300	Is it wrong in the Harry Potter series to make fun of someone for being overweight?
711300	714300	Now, the obvious answer, you might think, is no,
714300	717300	because Harry makes fun of Dudley for being overweight,
717300	720300	Hagrid makes fun of Dudley for being overweight,
720300	724800	the narration makes fun of Dudley for being overweight, and this is all played for laughs.
724800	729300	It's not presented as the same type of bullying as Dudley's bullying.
729300	732300	It's not considered deserving of retribution.
732800	739300	However, we also see both Draco Malfoy and Vernon Dursley make fun of Molly Weasley for being overweight,
739300	742300	something which outrages Harry and his friends.
742300	746300	It's understood that it's wrong to make fun of Molly for being overweight.
746300	749800	When Draco insults Molly's weight, it isn't played for laughs.
749800	753300	It's used to illustrate how rude and insulting Draco is.
753300	756300	So is it wrong to make fun of someone for being overweight?
756300	760300	And the answer is, it depends on if you're a good or a bad person,
760300	763300	and whether your target is a good or a bad person.
763300	769300	But whether you're a good or a bad person is totally divorced from whether or not you mock people for their weight.
769300	771300	Now, this is just one example, obviously,
771300	776300	but this disconnect is typical for most actions in the Harry Potter stories.
776300	780800	What is done isn't so important compared to who is doing it.
780800	784300	Outside of extreme examples, like murdering a bunch of people,
784300	787800	there aren't really good or bad actions in the Harry Potter universe.
787800	793800	There are only good and bad teams, sometimes literal good and bad teams.
793800	796800	Characters are assigned good or bad as labels,
796800	800300	and whether their actions are considered good or bad follows from that.
800300	802300	As another example, we could ask,
802300	807300	is owning slaves wrong, as it's presented to us in the Harry Potter stories?
807300	810300	Which, again, we have to answer with, it depends.
810300	814300	Are you a good slave owner or a bad slave owner?
814300	816800	Now, just to head off a potential criticism here,
816800	821300	you might say, Sean, what are you expecting here, morality-wise,
821300	824800	from the children's book series written for little babies?
824800	828300	Aren't you taking this a little bit too seriously?
828300	831800	And the answer to that is that I don't really like the assumption
831800	836300	that stories are unable to be criticized because they're for children.
836300	839800	After all, you can have stories for children that are executed very well,
839800	842800	and stories for children that are executed very poorly.
842800	846800	Also, while the first stories are written for little babies,
846800	851300	the later Harry Potter novels are intended for increasingly older audiences.
851300	854800	Rowling tried to increase the target reading age of the novels
854800	858300	along with the main characters, and she did this in a few ways.
858300	862300	Firstly, the novels get more complicated, they get much longer.
862300	865300	Much longer than they have to be, I'd add.
865300	869300	They get much more violent, minors start getting killed.
869300	873800	That's minors with an O, not, like, minors.
873800	877800	Beloved characters like Sirius and Dumbledore start getting murdered.
877800	879300	Spoiler warning.
879300	884300	The main character's cute pet owl gets murdered, and then it explodes.
884300	885300	It's rough.
885300	889300	The stories also get more sexualized as the characters age through their teens
889300	892300	and start experiencing all of those teenage hormones,
892300	894800	and it also gets increasingly political.
894800	898800	In the early novels, politics is something that children occasionally glimpse
898800	904300	adults doing, but it's largely above their ability to influence, because they're 12.
904300	908800	Later, however, the politics of the wizarding world become a key component of the stories.
908800	911800	The Ministry of Magic becomes an important setting,
911800	914800	the Minister of Magic an important character,
914800	919800	and the actual non-wizarding Prime Minister is a point of view character in Book 6.
919800	922800	So how does this aging up and complicating of the series
922800	925800	relate to the presentation of good and evil?
925800	928300	Well, when the series starts, things are very simplistic.
928300	931800	Basically, all evil in the wizarding world stems from Voldemort.
931800	935300	If someone is bad, it's because they're a follower of Voldemort,
935300	937800	or the child of a follower of Voldemort.
937800	941300	Everyone in Slytherin is bad because they're the bad team.
941300	943300	Things are very black and white.
943300	946800	Now, despite attempting to mature other aspects of the series,
946800	951800	Rowling never gets away from this overly simplistic presentation of morality.
951800	955300	She makes a few attempts, but they prove to be false starts.
955300	958800	She always ends up right back here in the first novel,
958800	963800	where all evil stems from Voldemort, who murders people because he's bad.
963800	966300	And it makes for rather frustrating reading.
966300	970300	Rowling frequently threatens to make the series more interesting,
970300	974800	introducing several ideas that seem very much like setups for a later payoff,
974800	977300	but then that payoff just never comes.
977300	982300	As an example here, let's talk about the fountain in the main hall of the Ministry of Magic.
982300	985800	This is introduced in the Order of the Phoenix and described as follows.
1005800	1010300	Now, if you get wizard-supremacist vibes from this statue, you're supposed to.
1010300	1016800	This is all a conscious reference to real-world statues that give off white supremacist colonialist vibes,
1016800	1022300	featuring usually white men in positions of power, lording over their presumed inferiors.
1022300	1026800	So in this statue, you've got a wizard holding up his wand, the symbol of his power,
1026800	1031800	above the lesser races, who were forbidden by the Ministry of Magic to use wands themselves.
1031800	1034300	That's an idea introduced in Book 4.
1034300	1036300	The House Elves are a slave race.
1036300	1040800	The centaurs are classified as beasts and restricted to particular territories.
1040800	1045800	Even the goblins who run the wizard banking system don't have equal rights.
1045800	1051300	This statue is important later on, as it's the site of the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort.
1051300	1055800	The statues either get destroyed or are brought to life to participate in the duel,
1055800	1058800	and Voldemort ends up standing on the statue's plinth.
1058800	1064300	And this is the site of the reveal of Voldemort's return to wider wizarding society, right?
1064300	1067300	So this is a very simple metaphor, you would think.
1067300	1072800	This statue is a literal monument to the hypocrisies and inequalities in the wizarding world.
1072800	1079300	And it's here that Voldemort is revealed to the world because it's from this inequality and hypocrisy that he draws his power.
1079300	1082800	It turns out that not all evil in the world stems from Voldemort.
1082800	1084800	Quite the opposite, in fact.
1084800	1092300	Voldemort's authoritarian violence and desire for control is merely an extension of the systems that already exist in the world.
1092300	1096300	The ministry has no argument against Voldemort on an ethical level.
1096300	1102300	The wizards own slaves, they run a torture prison, they deny equal rights to non-wizards.
1102300	1108300	There are actually repeated worries in the novels that Voldemort will draw various races of creatures to his side,
1108300	1115300	specifically because he might be able to offer them a better life than what the wizard supremacist ministry is currently imposing upon them.
1115300	1121300	We even learn later that Voldemort was able to literally get away with a murder he committed by framing a house elf,
1121300	1126300	something he knew would not be investigated due to discrimination against house elves.
1126300	1131300	So the systemic inequalities and discrimination in the wizarding world enforced by the Ministry of Magic
1131300	1137300	are providing both the opportunity and ideological groundwork for Voldemort to rise to power.
1137300	1144300	Crucially, Voldemort's ideal world isn't fundamentally different to the one currently enforced by the ministry.
1144300	1150300	He just wants to extend the persecution to also include muggles and non-pureblood wizards.
1150300	1158300	He wants to discriminate against certain humans, like the wizards as a whole already discriminate against the other races.
1158300	1162300	This is seen when Voldemort gets to redecorate the ministry in the last novel,
1162300	1167300	and he puts his own statue in place which has a witch and a wizard sitting on a throne of muggles.
1167300	1170300	Unless you think I'm reading into these statues too much,
1170300	1174300	Dumbledore explicitly states after his duel with Voldemort,
1174300	1177300	The fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie.
1177300	1183300	We wizards have mistreated and abused our fellows for too long, and we are now reaping our reward.
1183300	1189300	Now, having set all of this up, you might expect Rowling to then do something with it.
1189300	1195300	You know, go on to tell a story in which the various systemic problems in the wizarding world are resolved,
1195300	1197300	or at least addressed in some way.
1197300	1203300	After the addition of all of these elements, the story can't simply be about defeating Voldemort anymore.
1203300	1208300	Defeating Voldemort at this point should mean defeating his supremacist ideology,
1208300	1214300	which by necessity means defeating the supremacist ideology inherent to the wider wizarding world.
1214300	1219300	Merely defeating Voldemort in a contest of power can't be a satisfying ending anymore,
1219300	1223300	because after how horrible the status quo has been made to seem,
1223300	1229300	simply beating Voldemort in a fight and then returning to the status quo must be seen as a failure.
1229300	1232300	Anyway, spoiler alert, none of this gets resolved.
1232300	1236300	Voldemort's defeated despite it all, and the final sentence of the novels is,
1236300	1238300	All was well.
1238300	1242300	All is well, but yes, we are keeping the slaves.
1242300	1244300	We're the good guys.
1244300	1248300	So you might be asking, why put in all of these elements if they're not going to be utilized?
1248300	1254300	You know, why attempt to complicate your story beyond a simplistic tale of good versus evil
1254300	1258300	if you're just gonna unceremoniously drop all that to write an ending that contradicts it all?
1258300	1261300	You know, what is J.K. Rowling doing?
1261300	1265300	One of Rowling's flaws as a writer relates to her not planning ahead,
1265300	1269300	not just with the politics and morality of the series, but with everything.
1269300	1275300	She often introduces elements to her world with apparently no thought as to the later consequences,
1275300	1279300	and for a very fun example of this, let's talk about time turners.
1279300	1284300	So time turners are little portable time machines that enable the user to go back in time.
1284300	1286300	They're introduced in The Prisoner of Azkaban,
1287300	1292300	and Harry and Hermione use one at the climax of the story to save and free Buckbeak the Hippogriff
1292300	1294300	and Harry's godfather Sirius Black,
1294300	1297300	which, you know, is fine in and of itself.
1297300	1302300	However, the potential problem with introducing time travel to your fantasy series
1302300	1305300	is that your fantasy series has time travel in it now.
1305300	1311300	So going forward, you have to account for the fact that characters can travel through time to resolve problems.
1311300	1314300	Otherwise, any time anything unfortunate happens,
1314300	1318300	everyone will be asking why the characters aren't using their time machine to fix it.
1318300	1322300	One way to do this is to make time travel difficult to accomplish somehow.
1322300	1328300	So thinking ahead, you impose limits on the way the time travel mechanism can be used.
1328300	1331300	So you have a time machine that only works in certain circumstances,
1331300	1334300	or requires a certain object or fuel to function.
1334300	1340300	Or the Disquelt novel Nightwatch, for instance, features time travel as the result of a magical accident,
1340300	1343300	so it's not easily repeatable going forward.
1343300	1349300	Rowling's time machines, on the other hand, are small, easily portable, apparently infinitely usable,
1349300	1354300	and they're introduced because one is handed out to a 13-year-old so she can do extra homework.
1354300	1358300	And you know what? If they were just used as a comedic bit, that's fine.
1358300	1364300	You could say they only work on trivial things, like Hermione can take extra classes at wizard school, say,
1364300	1368300	but you couldn't use them to save a life or anything dramatic like that.
1368300	1373300	But then the time turner is used in the conclusion of the story to save Sirius and Buckbeak,
1373300	1379300	so now you've got an indeterminate amount of these little time machines in your stories that have no limits on their use.
1379300	1383300	They can apparently do anything, and they're handing them out to actual children.
1383300	1386300	Now, the next novel in the series, The Goblet of Fire,
1386300	1391300	features the death at the end of the book of beloved character Cedric Diggory.
1391300	1395300	I'm assuming he was beloved. Somebody probably loved him.
1395300	1399300	So anyway, Cedric dies, and readers at the time probably wondered,
1399300	1405300	what happened to all of those time machines, right? Just give one of those a twist and prevent Cedric from dying.
1405300	1410300	But there is no mention of time turners in The Goblet of Fire. It's like Rowling just forgot about them.
1410300	1414300	And you know what? I'm not even gonna criticize that necessarily.
1414300	1419300	Rowling thought of one story with time machines in it, and then she didn't want to deal with them anymore, so she didn't.
1419300	1424300	And if she left it there, I'd actually kind of respect that. That's what the movies did, after all.
1424300	1427300	Because ultimately, it doesn't really matter, does it?
1427300	1432300	It's not a fatal flaw if your fun fantasy series isn't that coherently planned out.
1432300	1435300	These aren't killer criticisms.
1435300	1440300	If Rowling just never addressed the time turners again, most of her audience wouldn't care too much.
1440300	1446300	Cinema sins would ding it. You'd maybe have a few YouTube videos or BuzzFeed articles called, like,
1446300	1452300	The Dark Side of Harry Potter, Why Didn't the Wizards Use a Time Machine to Stop Hitler, or whatever.
1452300	1456300	But again, that's just for fun criticism. It wouldn't really matter.
1456300	1462300	Why didn't the eagles fly the ring into Mount Doom? Because they didn't. You know, whatever.
1462300	1471300	Plus, setting your story in a magic school gives you very generous space for literal, a wizard did it, plot hole explanations, right?
1471300	1477300	It would be very easy for Rowling to say, time turners can't undo the killing curse, or whatever.
1477300	1483300	If you use a time machine to save someone who gets killing cursed, they just die anyway, so it would be pointless to save Cedric.
1483300	1490300	There you go. Simple explanation based on magical rules of which she is the master, so there'd be no way to argue with that.
1490300	1496300	The problem is, JK Rowling can't leave well enough alone when it comes to the time turners,
1496300	1500300	and she did a series of very strange and funny things.
1500300	1504300	Now, the first funny thing she did was, in Book 5, the one after Cedric dies,
1504300	1511300	in a move that feels very much like a response to people asking about the time turners, she destroys all of the time turners.
1511300	1515300	So Neville Longbottom is fighting a Death Eater in the Ministry of Magic,
1515300	1521300	and they accidentally destroy a cabinet which has all of the time turners in it.
1521300	1527300	All of them. They're all just on the same shelf, and then they all get knocked over, and they're gone.
1527300	1529300	That's unfortunate, isn't it?
1530300	1540300	I love this. This is the clumsiest, literally the clumsiest, most lazy way of getting time travel out of your story.
1540300	1547300	Sorry, everyone. Neville knocked time travel over, so we can't do that anymore. It's brilliant.
1547300	1554300	Now, the next funny thing she did, again, in a move that feels very much like a response to people asking about Cedric Diggory,
1554300	1560300	is show us just how horrible the world would be if Cedric Diggory survived.
1560300	1566300	So Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a stage play which is based on a story written by Rowling.
1566300	1573300	In that play, Harry Potter's son goes back in time using a time turner in order to save the life of Cedric Diggory,
1573300	1577300	and he saves Cedric's life by making him lose the Triwizard Tournament,
1577300	1584300	meaning he doesn't touch the port key at the end and so isn't present at the end of the Goblet of Fire for Voldemort to order his death.
1584300	1592300	And as a result of losing the Triwizard Tournament, Cedric is so embarrassed that he becomes a Death Eater.
1592300	1596300	Really?
1596300	1599300	And he fights on Voldemort's side in the Battle of Hogwarts.
1599300	1607300	He kills Neville Longbottom, which ensures that Voldemort wins, who then goes on to be the dictator of the Wizarding World.
1607300	1612300	Now, this is amazing. It's like it's a wonderful life, but in reverse.
1612300	1616300	You know, look how awful it would be if you survived, Cedric.
1616300	1621300	Cedric Diggory. It's a horrible life. That's what they should have called it.
1621300	1627300	And what this all means is when Dumbledore eulogizes Cedric in the Goblet of Fire, you know, he was a good and loyal friend,
1627300	1632300	a hard worker, he valued fair play, he was good and kind and brave.
1632300	1641300	No, sorry Dumbledore, he wasn't. He was actually only one bad day away from becoming a fascist murderer, and it's good he died.
1641300	1643300	Jesus Christ.
1643300	1647300	You see, it isn't so much that Rowling doesn't plan ahead that is the problem here.
1647300	1652300	It's her later attempts to go back and fill plot holes that really damages the story.
1652300	1658300	I actually have my own theory about what happened with the Time-Turners, and it's called the One-Book Lag Theory.
1658300	1662300	It's something I noticed with a few other elements in the Harry Potter novels.
1662300	1667300	What happens is Rowling will introduce some element to a story that seems like a big deal,
1667300	1672300	and that you would expect to still exist in the next novel, only it doesn't. It just vanishes.
1672300	1675300	And this may have led to readers inquiring as to where it went.
1675300	1681300	So then, in the next novel, as a reaction to criticism of the missing element, Rowling will knock it off the shelf.
1681300	1688300	So we get time travel introduced in book three, it vanishes for book four, then falls off the shelf in book five.
1688300	1692300	And there's another of these in the second book, The Chamber of Secrets.
1692300	1696300	In that novel, the poverty of the Weasley family is a repeated theme.
1696300	1701300	We see the Weasley children wondering how their parents are going to pay for all of their school things.
1701300	1707300	The Weasley boys get hand-me-downs, but the parents need to buy all new things for their daughter Ginny.
1707300	1714300	There's a heartbreaking scene where we see Molly Weasley reaching into the corners of her bank vault looking for more coins.
1714300	1720300	And through all this, Harry feels embarrassed and guilty because not only are the Weasley family keeping him as a guest,
1720300	1725300	he's rich. He's got a huge pile of gold that his parents left for him.
1725300	1730300	Then, to make matters worse, Ron and Harry steal the Weasleys' car and not only lose it,
1730300	1734300	Ron's dad gets a huge fine for owning it illegally.
1734300	1739300	So on the one hand, Harry has a guilty conscience about costing the Weasleys so much gold.
1739300	1742300	And on the other hand, he has a giant pile of gold.
1742300	1747300	Now, the repeated mentions of both the poverty of the Weasley family and of Harry's guilt
1747300	1752300	creates an expectation for the audience that this will be resolved in some way.
1752300	1757300	And the payoff to this seeming setup is nothing. There just isn't one.
1757300	1762300	The Weasleys are poor, Harry is rich and costs them a whole bunch of money and feels bad about it.
1762300	1765300	And that's it. No conclusion.
1765300	1769300	Now, technically, he saves Ginny's life at the end of the story,
1769300	1773300	so you can see that as a payoff to what Harry owes the Weasleys if you like,
1773300	1775300	but I find that unsatisfying.
1775300	1781300	I don't believe that if a different student, say Neville, had been kidnapped by an evil book,
1781300	1782300	Harry would have been like,
1782300	1786300	Well, I don't owe Neville's family any money, so I'm not getting involved.
1786300	1788300	No, he would have saved the day anyway.
1788300	1791300	This ending has nothing to do with the poverty theme.
1791300	1796300	And I find this all a little frustrating in light of something which happens in the very first novel,
1796300	1798300	the first time that Harry meets Ron.
1798300	1803300	In this initial meeting on the train to Hogwarts, Ron can't afford to buy food from the trolley,
1803300	1807300	and he's got some horrible sandwiches his mum made for him that he doesn't even like.
1807300	1811300	Harry can afford to buy food from the trolley and wants to share it with Ron,
1811300	1815300	so he offers to trade for some of Ron's sandwiches.
1815300	1817300	Now, I like this scene. It's nice.
1817300	1820300	We're learning about our main characters, right?
1820300	1822300	Ron is poor and embarrassed about that.
1822300	1827300	Harry was poor, but then was suddenly made very rich, and he's embarrassed about that.
1827300	1829300	Harry wants to share with Ron.
1829300	1831300	He values friendship more than money,
1831300	1837300	but he's also emotionally intelligent enough to navigate doing so without hurting Ron's feelings,
1837300	1840300	hence pretending he wants some of Ron's horrible sandwiches.
1840300	1845300	And if you liked this early instance of the characters managing to overcome their social embarrassment
1845300	1847300	in order to share with each other,
1847300	1851300	I hope you got your fill, because it's not going to be happening again.
1851300	1853300	A case in point here.
1853300	1855300	Ron's wand in the Chamber of Secrets.
1855300	1858300	Ron's wand gets broken early on in the story.
1858300	1861300	He needs a new wand, but he doesn't want to write home asking for one
1861300	1864300	because he doesn't want his parents to be mad at him for breaking it,
1864300	1867300	and it's not like they can afford the expense anyway.
1867300	1871300	Every time Ron's broken wand came up in the story, I was thinking,
1871300	1874300	why doesn't Harry just buy Ron a new wand?
1874300	1877300	You know, he can afford it, Ron can't,
1877300	1882300	and Harry's just watching his best friend all year try to use this broken wand
1882300	1887300	that backfires and injures him, and he's not doing anything.
1887300	1889300	Why isn't he doing anything?
1889300	1893300	So we can say maybe it's embarrassing to buy your friend a wand,
1893300	1895300	but as shown in the previous novel,
1895300	1900300	Harry is supposed to be emotionally intelligent enough to navigate these sorts of interactions.
1900300	1903300	So the sort of thing he could do is give Ron a wand on an occasion
1903300	1906300	that it's appropriate to get other people presents, right?
1906300	1909300	Say, Ron's birthday or Christmas.
1909300	1914300	Hogwarts celebrates Christmas, you see, and the characters give each other presents.
1914300	1918300	For instance, in the Chamber of Secrets, Harry gets a tin of fudge from Hagrid,
1918300	1921300	Hermione gives him a new quill, Ron gives him a book,
1921300	1924300	and Harry gives them, in return, nothing.
1924300	1927300	Harry doesn't give his friends any Christmas presents.
1927300	1931300	And this is one paragraph after the Dursleys give Harry a toothpick for Christmas
1931300	1935300	in what is supposed to be a display of Scrooge-like miserliness,
1935300	1938300	but Harry doesn't even manage a toothpick for his friends.
1938300	1941300	He even gets a hand-knitted sweater from Molly Weasley,
1941300	1945300	which, again, makes him feel guilty because he stole her car,
1945300	1948300	but not guilty enough to actually do anything, though.
1948300	1951300	Of course, the plot reason Harry can't get Ron a new wand
1951300	1955300	is that Rowling wants Gilderoy Lockhart to later use the broken wand
1955300	1957300	in an attempt to wipe the memories of Ron and Harry,
1957300	1961300	only to have his spell bounce back at him and wipe his memory instead.
1961300	1965300	But all this requires is to get the broken wand into Lockhart's hands somehow.
1965300	1970300	You could write it so that Ron had a new wand and his old broken one,
1970300	1973300	then he's somehow forced by Lockhart to hand over his wand,
1973300	1976300	and so Ron intentionally hands the broken one over.
1976300	1978300	Now, I think that would be better.
1978300	1982300	It would give Ron something active to do with the conclusion of the story,
1982300	1986300	and it would make defeating Lockhart something at least partially intentional.
1986300	1990300	Oh, no. Look, I'm writing Harry Potter fanfiction.
1990300	1994300	While I'm writing fanfiction, though, I'll say that if J.K. Rowling had asked me for notes
1994300	1996300	on the end of The Chamber of Secrets,
1996300	2000300	I would have told her to have Harry find something valuable in The Chamber of Secrets.
2000300	2004300	Salazar Slytherin's lost gems or something,
2004300	2008300	and then force that on the Weasleys at the end of the story.
2008300	2010300	Now, they would refuse, of course,
2010300	2013300	but he could tell them it was repayment for the car he stole.
2013300	2017300	That would be a cap to everything in the novel about the Weasleys' poverty.
2017300	2020300	It would assuage Harry's guilt over costing them money.
2020300	2025300	And also, the beginning of the next novel features Ron's family going on holiday in Egypt,
2025300	2027300	which is later an important plot point.
2027300	2031300	Now, how can Rowling send the Weasleys on holiday when they're so poor?
2031300	2037300	Well, they just win a lottery between the books, which feels a bit random and convenient.
2037300	2041300	You know, wouldn't it be nicer to see the Weasleys on holiday at the beginning of the next book
2041300	2046300	because the poverty theme was adequately concluded in the preceding book?
2046300	2048300	Yes, probably.
2048300	2052300	Anyway, Ron's broken wand isn't the only example in The Chamber of Secrets
2052300	2058300	of dramatic tension only existing because Harry's too much of a tight git to spend any money on anyone.
2058300	2063300	In that novel, Draco Malfoy's father, Lucius, outfits the Slytherin Quidditch team
2063300	2069300	with a set of fancy new brooms, Nimbus 2001s, that are much better than the brooms used by the Gryffindor team
2069300	2073300	and especially better than the older brooms used by Fred and George Weasley.
2073300	2078300	And Draco taunts the Gryffindors about not being able to afford better brooms.
2078300	2082300	So the Gryffindor team are set up as the poor underdogs to the rich Slytherin team
2082300	2084300	who can afford the best equipment.
2084300	2090300	And a despondent Harry is later seen wishing he could somehow get seven free Nimbus 2001s
2090300	2092300	for their match against Slytherin.
2092300	2096300	You know, if only the Gryffindor team also had a rich benefactor
2096300	2100300	with a huge pile of gold and a desire to get them some new brooms.
2101300	2102300	Alas.
2102300	2105300	Now, reading this, I was thinking, obviously,
2105300	2110300	Harry, mate, you're rich. Why do you want free brooms?
2110300	2112300	Just buy some brooms.
2112300	2114300	Harry didn't even buy his own broom.
2114300	2118300	That was gifted to him by Professor McGonagall, the head of Gryffindor House.
2118300	2120300	And that's a point, actually.
2120300	2122300	When Lucius buys new brooms for the Slytherins,
2122300	2126300	or Snape is seen helping the Slytherin team out by letting them train
2126300	2129300	when the Gryffindors had the field booked or whatever,
2129300	2132300	it's presented as a sneaky, unfair thing to do.
2132300	2136300	But when McGonagall tips the scales in the favour of Hare House's Quidditch team
2136300	2140300	by anonymously buying their seeker a professional racing broom,
2140300	2142300	it's like, oh, what a lovely gift.
2142300	2146300	Because, remember, there are no good or bad actions in Harry Potter.
2146300	2148300	There are only good and bad teams.
2148300	2154300	And you can tell the bad team because they're ugly and fat and covered in snakes.
2154300	2157300	Now, the payoff to Harry being such a cheap bastard in Chamber of Secrets
2157300	2160300	comes two books later in Goblet of Fire,
2160300	2163300	where Harry gives Fred and George Weasley a big pile of gold
2163300	2165300	so they can start their joke show.
2165300	2167300	So, there we go, a couple of books late,
2167300	2171300	but Harry has finally found a way to give the Weasleys some of his vast fortune.
2171300	2173300	He got there in the end.
2173300	2175300	Except, not really.
2175300	2178300	You see, the money that Harry gives to Fred and George Weasley
2178300	2180300	is his winnings from the Triwizard Tournament,
2180300	2183300	and that wasn't really his money, was it?
2183300	2187300	The tournament was rigged in Harry's favour by one of Voldemort's followers.
2187300	2189300	Harry never would have won it by himself.
2189300	2192300	Now, it's still fine for Harry to give the money to Fred and George,
2192300	2194300	but this isn't really him being generous,
2194300	2197300	because keeping the money at all would be wrong here.
2197300	2202300	And this reminds me of when we see Harry giving Ginny a set of Gilderoy Lockhart's books,
2202300	2207300	except those were gifted to Harry by Lockhart as part of a self-serving promotional stunt,
2207300	2209300	so they didn't cost him anything either.
2209300	2213300	When it comes to Harry's money, Rowling wants it two ways.
2213300	2216300	She wants the wish-fulfillment Cinderella fantasy
2216300	2219300	of the main character being whisked away from poverty
2219300	2222300	to a world in which they're rich and famous and important,
2222300	2226300	and she also wants to have dramatic story elements centred around poverty,
2226300	2229300	story elements that could be easily solved by Harry's wealth.
2229300	2231300	And the result of trying to have it both ways here
2231300	2235300	is to just make Harry Potter look like kind of a selfish jerk.
2235300	2240300	Now, I confess I might be off in assigning these disappointing two-bucks-late payoffs
2240300	2244300	to Rowling's adversarial relationship with feedback,
2244300	2246300	but that's just how it reads to me.
2246300	2248300	You know, you brats keep asking about the Time-Turners.
2248300	2250300	Well, there you go, they've all been destroyed.
2250300	2254300	You brats keep asking why Harry doesn't give the Weasleys gold.
2254300	2256300	Well, there you go, he gave Fred and George a bag of gold.
2256300	2257300	Now leave me alone.
2257300	2259300	But the worst instance of this,
2259300	2264300	the point where it seems like Rowling is most obviously going on the offensive against her own audience,
2264300	2268300	is on the issue of slavery, which is what we're going to talk about next.
2268300	2273300	Now, if you read the Harry Potter books as a child and haven't returned to them as an adult,
2273300	2276300	or if you've only seen the movies and have never read the books,
2276300	2282300	be prepared for an experience, because the slavery stuff in the Harry Potter books gets really weird.
2282300	2286300	So Rowling introduces slavery in the second book, The Chamber of Secrets.
2286300	2292300	We're introduced early on to Dobby, a house elf, who is a slave owned by Draco Malfoy's family.
2292300	2296300	He's treated very poorly, and if he disobeys the orders of his master,
2296300	2299300	he's forced to physically abuse himself as punishment.
2299300	2304300	Harry is shocked by all this and responds by sympathizing with Dobby,
2304300	2307300	using his experience of being treated poorly by the Dursleys.
2307300	2312300	He wonders why Dobby doesn't escape. He offers to do something to help.
2312300	2318300	This is all a normal reaction to suddenly finding out that slavery exists in the Wizarding World.
2318300	2323300	Now, the end of the novel sees Harry trick Lucius Malfoy into releasing Dobby,
2323300	2326300	and key here is that Dobby is happy to be released.
2326300	2329300	It was set up that Dobby does not like being enslaved,
2329300	2333300	and then at the end of the novel, the payoff is that Harry frees him.
2333300	2337300	See, Rowling can do the setup and payoff sometimes.
2337300	2340300	And that's all fine for a single story.
2340300	2345300	Only, like the Time-Turners, Rowling has now introduced a rather large element into her world
2345300	2350300	that you would expect to feature going forward, that being racial slavery.
2350300	2356300	But in the next novel, The Prisoner of Azkaban, apart from one passing reference to Dobby made by Malfoy,
2356300	2359300	slavery is completely absent from the story.
2359300	2364300	And this might lead an audience to wonder, what's the deal with all the slaves?
2364300	2366300	You know, Harry freed Dobby.
2366300	2369300	But Dobby isn't the only slave in the world, is he?
2369300	2371300	So what's going on there?
2371300	2376300	Can we get a follow-up, please, JK, to the fact that the wizards keep slaves?
2376300	2381300	And what Rowling decided to do here was, to put it lightly, ill-advised.
2381300	2385300	So in The Goblet of Fire, two books after The Chamber of Secrets,
2385300	2389300	she introduces the positive aspects of slavery.
2389300	2395300	You see, the house elves actually like being enslaved, and it would be bad, even cruel, to free them.
2395300	2401300	We're introduced early on to Winky, another house elf slave who is, again, treated very poorly,
2401300	2403300	but she doesn't want to be freed.
2403300	2409300	And when she is freed, as a punishment, she falls into a state of depressed, listless alcoholism.
2409300	2414300	And that's it, that's the conclusion to Winky's story.
2414300	2418300	She was a slave, she was freed, she becomes a depressed addict.
2418300	2423300	And having shown us the evils of ending slavery,
2423300	2430300	Rowling then takes aim at those who would seek to force this horrible state of freedom upon the slaves.
2430300	2435300	You see, Hermione gets a bee in her bonnet about the existence of slavery in the wizard world,
2435300	2440300	and she's particularly irked by the fact that Hogwarts runs on slave labor.
2440300	2445300	The cooking and housekeeping is carried out by a whole bunch of unseen house elf slaves.
2445300	2450300	Hermione creates an organization to campaign for the freedom of the slaves,
2450300	2457300	which is given a silly name, Spew, and for the trouble she's roundly mocked by basically everyone, including her friends.
2457300	2465300	Hermione trying to free the slaves in a very haughty way, she's very haughty about slavery, is played for laughs.
2465300	2469300	It's an ongoing element of supposed comic relief.
2469300	2476300	And what comes to mind first here is that tweet from Rowling where she tries to bullshit that Hermione was never canonically white,
2476300	2479300	and says Rowling loves black Hermione.
2479300	2483300	Can you imagine if Hermione was black for this whole subplot?
2483300	2490300	You know, haughtily arguing for the end of slavery and being made fun of by her closest friends for it.
2490300	2494300	Winky and Spew were cut from the movies, unsurprisingly.
2494300	2501300	It is rather weird for the comic relief in your children's story to be someone attempts to end the slave trade.
2502300	2511300	Now, being charitable, we can say that this whole bit with Hermione and the slaves is supposed to be a criticism of a particular type of overzealous activism,
2511300	2516300	where someone inserts themselves into a political situation unnecessarily,
2516300	2522300	and tries to organize action that is actually counter to the wishes of the people they're trying to help, right?
2522300	2527300	Rowling's taking aim at only a particular type of activist, we can say.
2528300	2531300	But there are many, many problems with this.
2531300	2535300	Firstly is that if this is a criticism of political activism done wrongly,
2535300	2541300	there are no examples of what Rowling considers political activism done correctly in the Harry Potter novels.
2541300	2548300	So Spew reads as a criticism of all political activism, not merely one particular type of activism.
2548300	2556300	Next, this is all built on top of the audience's singular previous encounter with slavery prior to the fourth book, which is Dobby.
2556300	2561300	Now Dobby didn't like being enslaved, and he was happy to be freed,
2561300	2567300	which becomes confusing once Rowling tries to backpedal and say, actually, the elves like slavery,
2567300	2571300	because Dobby's an elf, and he doesn't like slavery.
2571300	2575300	And she deals with this by saying that Dobby's just weird.
2575300	2580300	And I want to talk about the scene in which we find out that Dobby is weird for not wanting to be a slave,
2580300	2585300	because it really highlights just how poorly thought out this whole slavery bit is.
2585300	2591300	So Hermione asks Hagrid to join her elf activism group, to which Hagrid responds,
2603300	2608300	But Harry set Dobby free and he was over the moon about it, said Hermione,
2608300	2610300	and we hear he's asking for wages now.
2610300	2614300	Yeah, well, you get weirdos in every breed.
2614300	2620300	I'm not saying there isn't the odd elf who'd take freedom, but you'll never persuade most of them to do it.
2620300	2623300	So this is probably my favorite retcon ever.
2623300	2628300	What, you thought Dobby was happy to be freed because slavery's bad?
2628300	2629300	Well, guess what, nerd?
2629300	2634300	Actually, slavery rules, and Dobby's just weird for not liking it.
2634300	2639300	And on the one hand, this is funny, but on the other, it's rather frustrating, right?
2639300	2645300	This scene is set in Hagrid's hut, and Hagrid, Ron, Harry, and Hermione are present.
2645300	2653300	And all of these characters should know what it's like to be discriminated against based on what are assumed to be innate characteristics.
2653300	2659300	Hagrid is half-giant and has been persecuted because he's assumed to therefore be violent and dangerous.
2659300	2663300	Hermione is muggle-born and is subjected to racial abuse because of that.
2663300	2669300	Ron's family is pureblood but is looked down upon for associating with muggle-borns like Hermione.
2669300	2674300	And Harry not only has his whole chosen one special destiny thing going on,
2674300	2679300	he has a history of being abused by the Dursleys on account of being born a wizard, right?
2679300	2687300	All of the characters should have a point of reference for questioning the logic that the house elves want to be slaves because it's just in their nature.
2687300	2691300	But with the exception of Hermione, they aren't questioning it.
2691300	2702300	Actually, even when it comes to Hermione, there is nothing in the text that directly states she is so invested in campaigning for the elves because of her own experience of suffering racial discrimination.
2702300	2707300	I doubt Rowling would have intended or even noticed that possibility.
2707300	2713300	Hermione is supposed to be functioning here solely as a haughty busybody who is the punchline of a joke.
2713300	2721300	So, as Rowling writes it, we're to understand that it's wrong, for instance, for people to assume Hagrid is violent because he is a giant,
2721300	2725300	because it's wrong to judge him on the basis of his race rather than his actions.
2725300	2734300	But it's okay to assume the house elves, on the basis of their race, want to be slaves, even though some of them demonstrably do not want to be.
2734300	2741300	It's in their nature to look after humans, and if they say otherwise, they're just being weird.
2741300	2744300	So, time for an obvious statement here.
2744300	2751300	This assumption that the elves should be naturally subservient because of their race is racist, right?
2751300	2754300	I mean, that's what racism is, isn't it?
2754300	2758300	So, are the characters who make that argument just racists?
2758300	2762300	Now, the Harry Potter series has something of a limited understanding of racism,
2762300	2770300	and I don't mean intentionally limited in that it's a series aimed at children and teens and therefore isn't going to be that complicated.
2770300	2774300	No, I mean limited in that the author just doesn't really understand racism.
2774300	2778300	Now, don't get me wrong, Rowling understands that racism is bad,
2778300	2782300	and she often makes her characters who are the bad guys be racists,
2782300	2787300	but where she trips up is when she tries to understand and counter that racism.
2787300	2792300	And to show you what I mean, let's talk through a couple of instances of racism in the books.
2792300	2798300	So, Harry's first encounter with racism in the wizard world is when he meets Malfoy in Diagon Alley in Book 1,
2798300	2803300	and Malfoy states that he thinks Hogwarts shouldn't admit witches and wizards from muggle families.
2803300	2807300	An upset Harry tells Hagrid about this later, and Hagrid says,
2813300	2818300	Hagrid is saying, basically, don't worry, that racist wasn't talking about you.
2818300	2824300	Now, that's not too great of a reply, obviously, but Hagrid has another up his sleeve, he says.
2828300	2834300	Look at your mum. Look at what she had for a sister.
2834300	2839300	And a similar scene takes place in Book 2, after Hermione is called a Mudblood by Malfoy.
2839300	2842300	Ron, explaining what Mudblood means, says,
2842300	2848300	There are some wizards, like Malfoy's family, who think they're better than everyone else because they're what people call pure blood.
2848300	2851300	The rest of us know it doesn't make any difference at all.
2851300	2856300	Look at Neville Longbottom. He's pure blood and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way up.
2856300	2858300	And then Hagrid chimes in, saying,
2862300	2865300	This is Rowling's counterargument to the racism in her books.
2865300	2871300	Racists are technically incorrect on the facts, which is weak by itself.
2871300	2878300	You see, when racists say they're better than other people, they don't actually mean more skilled.
2878300	2883300	They mean fundamentally better. They are worth more, as people, by default.
2883300	2892300	To a wizard world racist, Neville Longbottom is worth more than a thousand Hermione's because he is pure blood, so he is better.
2893300	2901300	Whatever reasons racists give for their racism are not the actual reasons at all. They're the excuses for their racism.
2901300	2906300	Racism, as presented by the Harry Potter series, is a conscious decision people make.
2906300	2911300	A character will choose to be racist because they believe in some flawed idea.
2911300	2914300	They have an incorrect belief about the world.
2914300	2923300	Racists say muggle-borns are worse at magic, but look, Hermione is really good at magic, and Neville is rubbish. Therefore, racism is wrong.
2923300	2930300	Now, this is a poor counterargument because it accepts the logic of the racists. It just disagrees with their conclusion.
2930300	2937300	And what does this say to Hermione, exactly? You know, if you were bad at magic, Malfoy would be right to be racist about you.
2937300	2940300	It's a good job you do your homework, Hermione.
2940300	2950300	And in fact, when the good characters do agree with the logic of the racism, i.e. house elves are naturally subservient and slavery is the best thing for them,
2950300	2954300	then it's not considered to be racism at all. It's just common sense.
2954300	2963300	In J.K. Rowling's writing, the real bigotry is not, for example, believing in a hierarchical worldview with a natural slave race.
2963300	2970300	Bigotry is more just being rudely incorrect. Racism is first and foremost a bad attitude.
2970300	2980300	And I'd argue that this view of racism, in which it's a thing consciously engaged in with intentional rudeness, is why Rowling is ignorant of her own racism.
2980300	2986300	Now, J.K. Rowling gets to racism not by conscious, rude hatred, but by way of arrogant laziness.
2986300	2996300	She writes about groups of people that she doesn't know anything about, she doesn't do any research or talk to anyone who knows more than her, and so she gets herself into trouble.
2996300	3003300	For instance, a few years ago, Rowling came under fire for writing an article about Navajo skinwalkers on the website Pottermore,
3003300	3014300	which was a site owned by J.K. Rowling that published supplementary material and news related to the Harry Potter universe, before being rebranded to WizardingWorld.com in 2019.
3014300	3026300	Anyway, in this article, Rowling states that the legend of the skinwalker was made up by Native American medicine men in order to demonize real wizards, and this is something that she repeated on Twitter.
3026300	3035300	And Rowling was widely criticized for appropriating a real people's cultural and spiritual traditions to use as props in her wizard stories.
3035300	3043300	And the way she uses them is basically to say that their historical beliefs were made up by people who were jealous of her real wizards.
3043300	3050300	Rowling's laziness really takes center stage in the series of articles introducing the other schools of the Wizarding World.
3050300	3054300	For instance, the Japanese school is called Mahutakoro.
3054300	3059300	Now that might not sound right to you, but that is the pronunciation guide given on the website.
3059300	3070300	So this name is what you would get if you used Google to translate the Japanese word for magic and the Japanese word for place, and then combined them with no regard for grammar and then pronounced it wrong.
3070300	3072300	This article starts out,
3080300	3088300	About twice as many people live in Japan than in the UK, which also has its own wizard school, so why does their school have fewer students?
3088300	3094300	Are Japanese people just genetically less magic than British people in Rowling's world?
3094300	3106300	The South American wizard school is in Brazil and its name is what you would get if you used Google to translate the Portuguese word for castle and the Portuguese word for wizard and then combined them with no regard for grammar.
3106300	3115300	The resulting word, castle wizard, sounds less like it's describing a castle for wizards and more as though the castle itself is a wizard.
3115300	3122300	It's also named in Portuguese despite the school predating the Portuguese colonization of the Americas, so what happened there?
3123300	3131300	All this might seem nitpicky, but these are the sorts of questions you need to think about if you want to write about other people's cultures and histories.
3131300	3136300	Rowling gets herself into trouble here because she just lazily makes it up as she goes along.
3136300	3149300	Case in point from the Harry Potter series, the Scottish-Chinese character Cho Chang, whose name is made up of two Asian surnames, which depending on how you translate them are possibly from different countries even.
3149300	3154300	It'd be like calling a European character Lopez Schneider or something.
3154300	3163300	Now there's been a lot of criticism of Cho Chang and a lot of wondering about how Rowling came up with the name exactly, but I know. I can solve that mystery today.
3163300	3173300	You see, Rowling often names things in her books using word association, so she comes up with some words associated with the thing she's trying to name and then constructs a name out of those.
3173300	3182300	So what do I call this grim old place? Grim old place. Where do the goblins keep the ingots in gringots?
3182300	3190300	Where do the Dursleys live? Well, they're very private and Dudley is always whinging, so they live in Privet Drive. Little whinging, right?
3190300	3195300	She also names some of her characters this way. So what do I call the werewolf?
3195300	3208300	Well, Remus raised by wolves, Lupin from the Latin for wolf, right? This character is always taking umbrage with things, so I'll just call her Umbrage. That one was easy.
3208300	3222300	But now here's where it gets awkward. What do I call the black guy? Well, what comes to mind when I think of a black guy? Martin Luther King, a slave in shackles, right? Kingsley Shacklebolt.
3222300	3228300	Now what do I call the Asian character? What comes to mind when I think of an Asian person?
3228300	3239300	And now, I don't even want to say what I would bet JK Rowling thought of here, but she thought a two-word phrase and then just changed it a little bit to get to Cho Chang.
3239300	3247300	That's how she came up with that name. She used Lazy Racist Word Association. Probably. I mean, I can't prove it.
3248300	3256300	To Rowling though, because none of this is consciously aggressive, because it isn't intentionally racist, it doesn't really count.
3256300	3265300	And so it goes in the novels with those who support the slavery of the house elves. Hagrid, for instance, can argue in favour of slavery perfectly politely.
3265300	3272300	On the other hand, it's Hermione who is presented as obnoxious and rude. She is the one with the bad attitude.
3272300	3281300	Now, in all of the scenes discussing the slavery of the house elves, readers might note the lack of opinions held by our own point-of-view character, Harry Potter.
3281300	3288300	The Harry Potter novels are written from a limited third-person perspective that is closely tied to a single point-of-view character,
3288300	3293300	which is usually Harry Potter, although there are a few chapters written from the point of view of other characters.
3293300	3299300	What this means is that the narration and therefore the reader has access to Harry's inner thoughts and feelings.
3300300	3307300	If Harry is embarrassed, we can just be told he was feeling embarrassed, but if Ron is embarrassed, the narration has to say something like
3307300	3315300	Ron looked embarrassed, because the narration doesn't have direct access to the other characters' thoughts and feelings like it does for Harry.
3315300	3322300	I mention this here to highlight how, after his initial surprised outburst about Dobby's slavery in the Chamber of Secrets,
3322300	3325300	Harry Potter doesn't really have any opinions about slavery.
3325300	3331300	In the slavery debates in the books, Harry is mostly just a passive, thoughtless observer.
3331300	3337300	Hermione obviously opposes slavery very strongly, and Ron finds this laughable and mocks her for it,
3337300	3341300	and claims that slavery is acceptable because the elves like it.
3341300	3348300	But Harry, our point-of-view character, just sits there silently, not thinking anything for the most part.
3348300	3353300	When he does voice an opinion, it's only to wonder when Hermione is gonna give up on the activism thing.
3354300	3359300	He doesn't appear to have any strong opinions other than Hermione should stop talking about it.
3359300	3367300	Even when Harry finds out that Professor Slughorn has been using a Hogwarts house elf to test his drinks for deadly poison
3367300	3370300	– this is after one of his drinks was actually poisoned, by the way –
3370300	3375300	Harry's only thought is how outraged Hermione would be if she heard about that.
3375300	3382300	When our hero, Harry Potter, hears that his teacher is testing what is potentially fatal poison,
3382300	3391300	on slaves, he just thinks, wow, it's a good job Hermione isn't here, because she'd probably be really annoying about this.
3391300	3398300	Now, the other major house elf character in the books is Creature, who Harry inherits after the death of Sirius Black,
3398300	3402300	so our main character becomes a slave owner. That's nice.
3402300	3409300	Creature is depicted as miserable and insulting. He's horrible to everyone, and everyone is horrible to him in return.
3409300	3416300	Harry also inherits Sirius' house, Twelve Grimmauld Place, which is decorated with decapitated slave heads.
3416300	3422300	And in the novel where this house first appears, The Order of the Phoenix, at Christmas time our main characters
3422300	3430300	decorate the house for Christmas, which involves putting Little Father Christmas hats and beards on the slave heads.
3430300	3437300	So our heroes decide to decorate their decapitated slave heads with little Christmas hats.
3437300	3446300	Now, I'm gonna need to hit pause here next to the Christmas slave heads and ask, what is happening right now?
3446300	3452300	Why are the Harry Potter books like this? And we're gonna have to go on a few tangents here, but stick with me.
3452300	3458300	So, say you're an author and you want to put slavery as a theme into your children's fantasy series.
3458300	3462300	Now, how do we do that? Well, there's a few ways to go about it.
3462300	3466300	The first is to just make the only slave owners bad people, right?
3466300	3472300	So only the bad characters like the Malfoy's own slaves, and all the good characters oppose it.
3472300	3480300	Maybe there's a political effort to free the slaves, but the old racist pureblood families keep using their wealth and power to block it, right?
3480300	3488300	So you've got a very clear good-bad dividing line on the issue of slavery. That's the simplistic, straightforward way to do it.
3488300	3494300	The more complicated way to do it is have slavery be a systemic issue inherent to the whole wizarding society.
3494300	3498300	And at first glance, it seems that this is what Rowling is going for.
3498300	3503300	Characters who are otherwise presented as good people defend slavery.
3503300	3514300	Hagrid argues it's in their nature, Ron says they like being slaves, Molly wishes she had a slave to do the laundry even though she can do housework by magic, and so on.
3514300	3520300	And this systemic problem is even explicitly tied to the rise of the main antagonist of the series.
3520300	3527300	Now, you might expect the main character of this story to be an outsider, freshly introduced into the wizarding world,
3527300	3533300	who can see through the inequalities that they take for granted, who can introduce a new perspective.
3533300	3540300	But Harry is not given that role. It's given instead to Hermione, and only to mock how silly it is.
3540300	3550300	Now, the real issue comes at the end of this story, because if you want to have a happy ending where your characters triumph, where evil is conquered, where all is well,
3550300	3559300	then the systemic problem of slavery requires a systemic resolution, i.e. the slaves have to be freed, or all is not well, is it?
3559300	3565300	But what we need to understand here is that J.K. Rowling can't free the slaves in her story.
3565300	3573300	This is the reason she has to backpedal slavery into not being that bad, because after she introduces it, she can't fundamentally change it,
3573300	3577300	and she can't do that because of her real-world political beliefs.
3577300	3581300	And to understand those, we need to talk about neoliberalism.
3581300	3588300	Now, whenever the politics of Harry Potter are brought up online, someone will post this screencap from an image board,
3588300	3595300	where the author of the post lays what they see as the failings of the Harry Potter story at the feet of J.K. Rowling being, quote,
3595300	3599300	a liberal, centrist Blairite who doesn't really believe in anything.
3599300	3602300	But is this accurate, and what does it mean exactly?
3602300	3610300	So, very quick, in 1979, Margaret Thatcher came to power in the UK. Yes, sorry we're doing this.
3610300	3617300	Her government was in power throughout the 80s and enforced and oversaw a national political realignment.
3617300	3623300	Previously, in the period after World War II, the UK instituted various welfare reforms paid for by high taxes,
3623300	3628300	a national healthcare service was established, there was wide support for trade unions,
3628300	3633300	and various industries and services were nationalized, that is, brought into public ownership.
3633300	3638300	Now, Thatcher's government can be characterized as a total shift away from all of this.
3638300	3643300	Unions were broken up, national industries and services were privatized and sold off,
3643300	3648300	there were tax cuts for the rich, and there was a whole bunch of financial deregulation.
3648300	3656300	This was a philosophy of smaller government, of diminishing collective action, and a greater emphasis on individual responsibility.
3656300	3658300	Thatcher even once stated, quote,
3658300	3664300	There is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women, and there are families.
3664300	3667300	Which, of course, doesn't make any sense.
3667300	3672300	Now, after Thatcher came to power, there were 18 years of conservative rule in the UK,
3672300	3677300	and this led to Tony Blair rebranding the Labour Party to New Labour,
3677300	3681300	and shifting the party to the right to appeal to conservative voters.
3681300	3687300	So Blair abandoned Labour's previous support for renationalization and embraced the free market.
3687300	3695300	He moved away from seeking an equality of outcome and towards a supposedly meritocratic equality of opportunity.
3695300	3698300	Everyone should have the opportunity to succeed.
3698300	3700300	He basically said to the Conservatives,
3700300	3705300	We are not going to fight you on how the economy should fundamentally be organized.
3705300	3710300	You win. We give up. We now have the same aims in that regard.
3710300	3714300	We're no longer going to be seeking any serious structural change.
3714300	3717300	We're going to keep things organized as they are.
3717300	3721300	We're just going to argue that we can run things more competently than you can.
3721300	3728300	Thatcher is said to have later claimed that the rebranding of Labour to New Labour was her greatest political accomplishment.
3728300	3733300	Now, I don't know if she actually said that, but if she did, she was right.
3733300	3736300	Now, if you're from the US and want to understand all this,
3736300	3741300	you can swap Thatcher out for Reagan and Blair for Bill Clinton, and you'll have a rough outline.
3741300	3748300	So, anyway, this support for free market capitalism and associated policies of deregulation, privatization,
3748300	3754300	the reduction of government welfare spending, and a greater focus on individualism is known as neoliberalism.
3754300	3759300	Neo meaning new, because it was a resurgence of economic liberalism.
3759300	3761300	So what does all this have to do with JK Rowling?
3761300	3766300	Well, JK Rowling is an enormous fan of Tony Blair and New Labour.
3766300	3770300	She is actually personal friends with Blair's successor, Gordon Brown,
3770300	3776300	who, before becoming Prime Minister himself, served as Blair's Chancellor of the Exchequer for a decade.
3776300	3780300	For non-UK folks, the Chancellor is basically our Chief Finance Minister.
3780300	3784300	Rowling was present for the birth of Gordon Brown's son,
3784300	3787300	and she donated very large amounts of money to his government,
3787300	3791300	and has subsequently sung its praises on her social media accounts.
3792300	3797300	She has also been harshly critical of those within Labour who would seek to move the party back to the left.
3797300	3802300	JK Rowling's political philosophy is that of New Labour's neoliberalism,
3802300	3808300	with its focus on individual instead of collective action, its promise of no serious systemic change,
3808300	3812300	its push for equality of opportunity over equality of outcome,
3812300	3818300	and, most importantly, for a billionaire, its pledge not to raise taxes.
3818300	3821300	Now, with this worldview in mind, back to Harry Potter.
3821300	3826300	So, in the Harry Potter series, while individual actions can be good or bad,
3826300	3831300	systemic actions that threaten the status quo are always wrong.
3831300	3834300	Systemic change is always wrong.
3834300	3838300	This is why it can be seen as good for Harry to free one slave,
3838300	3841300	but bad for Hermione to want to free all the slaves,
3841300	3845300	because one is an individual change and one is a systemic change.
3846300	3851300	From the time Harry enters Hogwarts to the epilogue two decades after he leaves,
3851300	3857300	there are no examples in any of the Harry Potter novels of a positive systemic change.
3857300	3861300	Above an individual level, nothing changes for the better.
3861300	3869300	Flawed systems are portrayed, but the answer to those flaws is always to replace the individual assumed to be responsible for them.
3869300	3872300	The system itself is above being questioned.
3872300	3876300	Now, this attitude can be seen in Harry's interactions with the ministers of magic,
3876300	3880300	first Cornelius Fudge, and later Rufus Scrimjaw.
3880300	3884300	Scrimjaw? I have no idea if I'm saying that right.
3884300	3890300	Fudge is portrayed as an incompetent coward, someone too terrified of Voldemort to take any action,
3890300	3898300	whereas Scrimjaw is the opposite, so keen to be seen to be taking action that he abuses his authority to arrest and imprison the wrong people.
3898300	3904300	The authority of the ministry is carried out by their Aurors, who are basically the wizard police force.
3904300	3908300	And it's interesting to note what Harry sees this authority used to do.
3908300	3913300	Aside from the more general racial discrimination enforced by the ministry,
3913300	3919300	Harry sees them falsely imprison his godfather in their torture prison, Azkaban, then later hunt him.
3919300	3925300	They falsely imprison his friend Hagrid. They attack Dumbledore in his office in an attempt to arrest him.
3925300	3932300	And Harry later sees the whole apparatus of the ministry fall under Voldemort's control and be used to carry out his bidding.
3932300	3939300	But throughout all this, Harry never, at any point, questions the ministry's right to rule.
3939300	3944300	He never questions whether or not they should have the authority to do what they're doing.
3944300	3947300	He only ever questions their competency.
3947300	3954300	Even after everything he witnesses the ministry do, Harry's main ambition in life remains to become an Auror.
3954300	3958300	He wants to be a cop working for this government.
3958300	3963300	This is the result of an automatic, unthinking respect given to the status quo.
3963300	3972300	The political and social systems that currently exist are treated as fundamental forces that are inherent to the world, like gravity.
3972300	3978300	They can persecute you and your friends, they can even try to kill you, but they must never be questioned.
3978300	3985300	For a very clear example of this in Rowling's writing, let's briefly talk about the first Fantastic Beasts movie.
3985300	3988300	So these movies are a complete tonal mess.
3988300	3992300	They're trying to appeal to the little kids with the Fantastic Beasts angle.
3992300	3994300	You know, all the magical animals escaped.
3994300	3999300	Can Newt the zookeeper track them down and get them back into his magical suitcase?
3999300	4003300	You know, that's a nice low-stakes kids story, right?
4003300	4006300	But they're also trying to appeal to the older Harry Potter fans.
4006300	4012300	So the movies are also awkwardly about the conflict between Dumbledore and Grindelwald.
4012300	4017300	So as well as Newt Scamander trying to catch his mischievous escaped Niffler,
4017300	4021300	we also get to see a fascist execute an actual baby.
4021300	4024300	It's just all over the place with the tone.
4024300	4031300	Anyway, midway through the first movie, which, keep in mind, is supposed to be about a magical zookeeper,
4031300	4037300	we're treated to a horrific execution scene as Newt and his friend, the ex-aura Tina,
4037300	4040300	are sentenced to death by the American Ministry of Magic.
4040300	4043300	So there's suddenly much higher stakes than you'd expect.
4043300	4046300	So they're taken to a place called a death cell.
4046300	4055300	They've got a death cell to be summarily executed by being submerged into a death potion, which also exists.
4055300	4058300	And Newt and Tina have to stage an escape.
4058300	4061300	Now notable here is that Tina works with these people.
4061300	4067300	She's on first-name terms with the executioner, even, and they just take her off to be killed.
4067300	4073300	Anyway, at the end of the film, after Newt and Tina are back on good terms with the American Ministry,
4073300	4079300	Tina thanks Newt for putting in a good word for her and getting her her job back.
4079300	4084300	And you might be wondering, she still wants to work at the Ministry?
4084300	4092300	They just, like, just right now, tried to actually execute her, and she has nothing to say about that.
4092300	4098300	You know, should the wizards have a death cell? Should they be able to execute people without a trial?
4098300	4102300	Doesn't really matter, I guess. Water under the bridge now, eh?
4102300	4107300	The Harry Potter stories are sometimes mischaracterized as anti-authority,
4107300	4114300	even by Rowling herself, who has stated that she wants readers to take away the message that they should question authority.
4114300	4121300	She even has Harry laugh at Vernon for wondering why the Ministry of Magic can't protect them from Voldemort.
4121300	4125300	It was so very typical of his uncle to put his hopes in the establishment.
4125300	4130300	You see, Harry's laughing at Vernon here for not questioning the competency of authority.
4130300	4136300	But what Harry and Rowling do not realize is that Harry is not much different from his uncle here.
4136300	4142300	Because while Harry will question the competency of authority, he never questions its legitimacy.
4142300	4149300	He and the series as a whole are not anti-authority. They are anti the wrong people having authority.
4149300	4159300	One fun scene here is in the Half-Blood Prince, when a frustrated Harry wishes he had the power of the Minister of Magic to have his secret police follow Malfoy around.
4159300	4162300	And then Harry remembers that he does actually have that power.
4162300	4168300	He has the power of slavery, and then he orders Kreacher to follow Malfoy.
4168300	4173300	Now, written by anyone else, this might be a funny commentary on how police serve those in power,
4173300	4180300	but no, this is just our main character who wishes he was a cop ordering his slave around.
4180300	4183300	No, Harry Potter is not anti-authority.
4183300	4190300	Even when Harry breaks the rules, like when he sets up a secret organization for learning defense against the Dark Arts,
4190300	4196300	it's in service to the ultimate authority in the wizarding world, the status quo.
4196300	4205300	Harry sets up this club while Hogwarts is under the rule of Dolores Umbridge, who insists practical defense against the Dark Arts is unnecessary.
4205300	4210300	Umbridge is presented as a strict authoritarian who ruthlessly punishes rule breakers,
4210300	4215300	but of course the stealth real problem with Umbridge is that she represents change.
4215300	4221300	Her real evil is that she is changing Hogwarts from how it was when Harry first encountered it,
4221300	4227300	and so Harry and his pals have to break the rules in order to do what they were supposed to be doing anyway,
4227300	4230300	studying practical defense against the Dark Arts.
4230300	4235300	Harry and his friends oppose the authority of Umbridge, not because they are anti-authority,
4235300	4237300	but because they are anti-Umbridge.
4237300	4244300	And of course the solution to Umbridge's abuse of authority is simply to replace her with a good authoritarian,
4244300	4250300	swapping a bad individual for a good individual, but leaving the system unchanged.
4250300	4255300	This is the problem injected into the Harry Potter series by Rowling's political philosophy.
4255300	4263300	While she can portray societal problems, she cannot even conceive of societal solutions to those problems.
4263300	4269300	The problems might be systemic, but the solutions must always be individual.
4269300	4274300	Allow me to go on another tangent within this tangent and talk about The Casual Vacancy.
4274300	4280300	So The Casual Vacancy is the first novel written by Rowling after the publication of the Harry Potter novels,
4280300	4283300	and is very useful for us here for a couple of reasons.
4283300	4290300	Firstly, it's an explicitly political novel set in the real world. It is centered around local council politics.
4290300	4295300	Secondly, it is explicitly a novel for adults. It contains depictions of domestic violence,
4295300	4300300	sexual assault, child abuse and neglect, suicide, self-harm, and so on.
4300300	4306300	So if your response to any of my criticisms of Rowling's writing in Harry Potter is that Harry Potter is for children,
4306300	4311300	well, that doesn't apply to The Casual Vacancy, which is very much not meant for kids.
4311300	4318300	The Casual Vacancy is set in Pagford, a fictional, stereotypical, picturesque English village.
4318300	4324300	And the political plot of the novel is concerned with the border between Pagford and a nearby larger city.
4324300	4328300	There is currently a council estate full of poor people on Pagford's side of the border,
4328300	4334300	and there's a plot in the local council to change the border so that the estate will fall on the other side.
4334300	4339300	This would mean that the council estate will fall outside the catchment area of Pagford's school,
4339300	4342300	so the poor children will no longer be able to attend.
4342300	4349300	And the council also seek to close down a drug rehabilitation clinic in use by the inhabitants of the council estate.
4349300	4352300	Those seeking this change are presented unsympathetically.
4352300	4355300	They are conservative, they're small-minded, they're cruel,
4355300	4361300	and their response to social problems is to sweep them under the rug to make them someone else's responsibility.
4361300	4367300	Now, on the other side of the debate, we have the members of the Pagford council who argue against the border change,
4367300	4370300	who want things to remain as they are.
4370300	4373300	Now, principal among these is Barry Fairbrother,
4373300	4378300	who himself was born on the council estate before attending Pagford's fancy school,
4378300	4381300	studying hard, and becoming a bank manager.
4381300	4387300	So he is a living example of the opportunity he's trying to preserve for the other inhabitants of the estate.
4387300	4393300	So Rowling portrays several serious social problems caused by poverty and inequality,
4393300	4400300	but in response to these problems, the best her characters can imagine to do is to perpetuate the status quo.
4400300	4406300	The political conflict in the novel is between a side who want to actively change society for the worse,
4406300	4409300	and a side who want to keep things as they are.
4409300	4413300	There is no one who argues that the system should be changed for the better.
4413300	4420300	Even if the more sympathetic characters win, all they will achieve is a continuation of the current state of affairs,
4420300	4423300	along with its rampant poverty and inequality.
4423300	4427300	But in Rowling's world, there can be no systemic solution to poverty,
4427300	4431300	because poverty is unchangeable, it's simply a fact of life.
4431300	4435300	There can only be the individual opportunity to escape it.
4435300	4440300	Nobody is arguing that the poor residents of the council estate deserve a better life.
4440300	4445300	They only deserve the opportunity to prove themselves worthy of a better life.
4445300	4450300	We muggles have no sorting hat to simply tell us who is good and bad.
4450300	4454300	Instead, we have meritocracy to sort the deserving from the undeserving.
4454300	4458300	Will you become a depressed drug addict, or will you go to school and work hard?
4458300	4464300	And if you work hard enough, even the poorest among us can become a bank manager.
4464300	4466300	How inspiring.
4466300	4471300	You too can ascend the financial system that's causing the poverty you escaped from.
4471300	4478300	Now, I'm not saying stories with social problems necessarily have to fully resolve those social problems by the end,
4478300	4479300	because they don't.
4479300	4484300	But if you're trying to tell a societal story, then your society should be a living thing.
4484300	4490300	It should be at least potentially flexible, contain at least the possibility for change, both good and bad.
4490300	4494300	But Rowling's worlds are set in stone. They're dead.
4494300	4501300	The good in Rowling's story seeks only to cancel out evil, to undo evil's changes.
4501300	4507300	The solution to systemic problems is never to seek systemic change, but to be individually nicer,
4507300	4512300	to have nicer bank managers, to have nicer slave owners.
4512300	4517300	Which brings us back to the slaveheads in the little Christmas hats.
4517300	4525300	The solution to the systemic problem of slavery in the Harry Potter novels is for individuals to be nicer to their slaves.
4525300	4529300	I'm not kidding. That is the cap to the slavery theme.
4529300	4535300	Creature betrays Sirius because Sirius was mean to him, but Harry and friends learn to be nice to Creature,
4535300	4538300	after which he serves them loyally.
4538300	4542300	This is the payoff here. Be nice to your slaves.
4542300	4547300	This is laid out explicitly in an article about slavery on the Pottermore website.
4547300	4549300	So this article is titled,
4555300	4559300	If Hogwarts had a debate in club, what might it say on the subject of elf rights?
4559300	4564300	We explored both sides of the argument, spurred by Hermione and Spew.
4564300	4569300	So that's right, we're going to debate the pros and cons of slavery.
4569300	4575300	Firstly, the article covers Hermione's argument against slavery, but crucially, it gets it wrong.
4575300	4579300	After witnessing the mistreatment of Winky at the Quidditch World Cup,
4579300	4585300	Hermione discovered there were house elves at Hogwarts cooking and cleaning for zero pay, and yet nobody seemed to care.
4585300	4591300	Horrified to the point where she couldn't stomach the Hogwarts feast, she described the situation in two words.
4591300	4593300	Slave labour.
4593300	4597300	While it sounds heavy-handed, no it doesn't, that's just what it is,
4597300	4599300	Hermione does have a point.
4599300	4607300	No matter how you slice it, house elves are unpaid labourers, magically bound to serve, left at the mercy of their respective owners.
4607300	4610300	The system is ripe for abuse.
4610300	4617300	Now, this is where the article really goes wrong, because the system is not ripe for abuse, it is abuse.
4617300	4623300	The problem is not that slave owners might be mean to their slaves, it's that they own slaves at all.
4623300	4627300	This is one thing Rowling and her books don't get about slavery.
4627300	4629300	Slavery is wrong.
4629300	4638300	Slavery is wrong, regardless of what the slaves think, because it's wrong to benefit from slavery at all.
4638300	4644300	The article then goes on to list the arguments in favour of slavery, and it says,
4644300	4649300	Miss Granger is at best overzealous, and her goals are, at worst, unattainable.
4649300	4656300	Hermione may have meant well, but at the same time did end up dragging a peaceful group into a political battlefield,
4656300	4658300	just because she felt that's what they should want.
4658300	4663300	Was she helping, or interfering in a culture she didn't understand?
4663300	4671300	Oh boy, haughty old Hermione bringing politics into everything, even our peaceful system of slavery.
4671300	4677300	On the subject of Winky, the freed slave who becomes a depressed alcoholic, the article says,
4690300	4697300	Now, I don't know what to say here about this article arguing that it's irresponsible to free slaves, so I'm just gonna move on.
4697300	4700300	The article summarises its arguments by saying that,
4714300	4720300	This article doesn't exist anymore, by the way. They took it down, for what I hope are obvious reasons.
4720300	4725300	Anyway, the article concludes with its message about being nice to your slaves.
4725300	4734300	Before we go, let's consider Kreacher. Think of how he changed when treated with kindness by his new master, Harry Potter.
4734300	4737300	Previously, he'd been bitter and unpleasant.
4737300	4742300	Not to mention a liability to his previous owner.
4742300	4746300	Had Sirius treated him a little better, things might have worked out differently.
4746300	4752300	Dumbledore was right. Being kind to Kreacher was in everyone's best interests.
4753300	4759300	I think we need a palate cleanser after that, so allow me to briefly tell you a different story.
4759300	4766300	So, the Discworld novel Snuff is part of the City Watch series, which are like fantasy crime novels, basically.
4766300	4771300	In that book, Sam Vimes, the commander of the City Watch, is on holiday in the countryside
4771300	4777300	when he uncovers evidence of a plot to enslave goblins and force them to work on tobacco plantations.
4777300	4783300	So the crime to be solved in this crime novel is the slavery of a sapient magical race.
4783300	4788300	Now, most people on the Discworld think of the goblins more as pests than as people.
4788300	4795300	Goblins are small and weird, and they have cultural and spiritual practices that are difficult for outsiders to understand.
4795300	4800300	For instance, they store all of their bodily secretions in little pots that they carry around.
4800300	4805300	The dominant society of the Discworld is undergoing a change akin to our Industrial Revolution,
4805300	4809300	with the advent of technologies like trains and wireless communication.
4809300	4817300	And this society does not see goblins as useful. It sees them as outsiders, as savages, and they're treated like vermin.
4817300	4823300	So when Vimes arrives in the countryside for his holiday and finds that the local pub is called the Goblin's Head,
4823300	4829300	and that there is an actual stuffed goblin head mounted on the wall, he doesn't think too much of it.
4829300	4832300	After all, it's only a goblin, isn't it?
4832300	4838300	If there's a hierarchy of cultures on the Discworld in terms of power they have and respect they receive,
4838300	4841300	the goblins are very much on the bottom.
4841300	4846300	And intelligently here, Pratchett shows how the attitude that the goblins are somehow lesser beings
4846300	4849300	has even been accepted to a degree by the goblins themselves.
4849300	4856300	Notably, we're told that when a group of goblins was rounded up to be enslaved, they went passively and did not fight back.
4856300	4862300	As Vimes begins investigating the murder of a goblin and then later the slavery of the goblins, however,
4862300	4864300	he has cause to interact with them.
4864300	4872300	And in the course of these interactions, he realizes that rather than being vermin, they are thinking and feeling beings just like him.
4872300	4878300	He speaks to a goblin who is air quotes, civilized. She can speak his language and play the harp.
4878300	4883300	And on talking to this goblin, on coming to the realization that they are people,
4883300	4888300	Vimes remembers the goblin head mounted on the wall of the pub and he thinks to himself,
4888300	4891300	someone is going to burn.
4891300	4896300	And then just a few pages later, Vimes goes to the pub, puts the landlord in a headlock,
4896300	4901300	and tells him that if he doesn't take the goblin head off the wall, then he's going to set the building on fire.
4901300	4907300	And I can't tell you how cathartic this was to read after slogging through seven novels
4907300	4913300	of Harry Potter's passive, uninterested acceptance of the world as it is.
4913300	4921300	Imagine a hero who gets actually angry at injustice and then does something about it. What a treat.
4921300	4924300	Also, goblins don't have rights in the Discworld.
4924300	4929300	There's nothing illegal about rounding up goblins and shipping them off somewhere, but that doesn't matter.
4929300	4934300	It doesn't matter if it's legal or not, and it doesn't matter if the goblins protest or not.
4934300	4937300	Snuff says slavery is still a crime.
4937300	4943300	Now, Snuff ends, spoiler alert, with goblins being granted rights and protections under the law.
4943300	4950300	Because obviously, if your story is about a systemic injustice and you want your heroes to triumph and have a happy ending,
4950300	4953300	then that injustice needs a systemic correction.
4953300	4957300	And, of course, the goblin's head comes off the wall of the pub.
4957300	4962300	Now, I don't know if Snuff was intended to be a response to Rowling's house elves at all,
4962300	4967300	but the bit with the stuffed head mounted on the wall certainly makes it read as though it is.
4967300	4972300	If Rowling had written Snuff, Vimes would save the one goblin he met who could play the harp,
4972300	4976300	and the rest of them would still be on the tobacco plantation.
4976300	4980300	Actually, the first Fantastic Beasts movie has just such an ending.
4980300	4986300	In that movie, Newt Scamander makes a muggle friend, Jacob, who works in a canning factory.
4986300	4990300	It's the only work he can find, and he hates it, and it's miserable.
4990300	4994300	Him and his fellow workers are, as he states, dying in there.
4994300	4996300	Working in the factory, quote,
5005300	5012300	Then, at the end of the movie, Newt Scamander gives Jacob a bunch of magical silver eggs, which he uses to set up his bakery.
5012300	5016300	He also leaves him a note saying he's wasted in a canning factory.
5016300	5023300	But I was thinking during these scenes, what about these other guys still working at the canning factory?
5023300	5030300	Don't they have dreams? Don't they have things they'd rather be doing than toiling away in the canning factory?
5030300	5033300	Where are their magic eggs, exactly?
5033300	5039300	I guess it's their fault, really, for not also making a magical friend who can give them some magical money.
5040300	5044300	And ultimately, the world still needs things canned, doesn't it?
5044300	5046300	So back in the factory, you lot.
5046300	5052300	We've already selected the one special person among you who is worthy of a better life.
5052300	5054300	Anyway, I want now to ask a question.
5054300	5059300	The excuses that Rowling's characters give for keeping the elves in slavery,
5059300	5065300	they like it, it's the best thing for them, if we set them free, they'd just become troublesome drunks.
5065300	5071300	These are obviously similar to real-world excuses for the continued enslavement of groups of humans.
5071300	5078300	These were arguments once made about the supposed dangers of freeing enslaved black people in the United States, for instance.
5078300	5085300	Now, Rowling would argue that the elves in her books are not supposed to be a commentary on any real-world instances of slavery,
5085300	5089300	but my question is, does it matter what the intention was here?
5089300	5091300	And I'd argue no, it doesn't.
5092300	5097300	If the similarities exist, they exist, regardless of what the author's intent was.
5097300	5102300	And with that said, I think it's time to talk about Rowling's goblins.
5102300	5106300	Now, Rowling's goblins have been widely criticized as antisemitic,
5106300	5111300	appearing as they do, similar to antisemitic stereotypes of Jewish people.
5111300	5115300	They're greedy, they're untrustworthy, they run the banking system,
5115300	5124300	and the Harry Potter people didn't do themselves any favors in this regard by having a large six-pointed star appear on the floor of Gringotts in the first movie.
5124300	5132300	That was, uh, unfortunate, wasn't it? You didn't want to edit that out? No? Throw a rug over it or something?
5132300	5138300	Now, of course, many fantasy stories use fantasy races as stand-ins for groups of real humans.
5138300	5145300	I talked in a recent video about the Discworld's dwarves, for instance, being used to both explore LGBT issues
5145300	5150300	and conflicts between the moderately religious and the more hardline religious.
5150300	5156300	Star Trek, as another example, uses fantasy races to comment on particular real-world issues.
5156300	5161300	Think of the alien race who are half white and half black but still discriminate against one another
5161300	5167300	and are used in a rather heavy-handed way to highlight the absurdity of racism.
5167300	5172300	Star Trek also uses real-world cultures as a basis for many of its races.
5172300	5175300	The Romulans are based on ancient Rome, for example.
5175300	5179300	The Klingons, in their various incarnations, draw from several cultures.
5179300	5184300	The Mongol Empire, there's some ancient Japan, there's some Vikings.
5184300	5190300	But I want to talk about the Ferengi here. I want to compare the Ferengi to Rowling's goblins.
5190300	5197300	Now, the Ferengi are portrayed as a culture driven primarily by material wealth, profit, and exploitation.
5197300	5205300	They are capitalists, basically. They're used to represent and parody us, you know, humans as we exist now,
5205300	5208300	before we became utopian space communists.
5208300	5214300	But it's also not hard to imagine the same criticisms aimed at Rowling's goblins being also aimed at the Ferengi,
5214300	5218300	with their oversized facial features and obsessive greed.
5218300	5224300	And indeed, over the years, people have accused the Ferengi of being similar to antisemitic stereotypes.
5224300	5226300	So, is there a difference here?
5226300	5234300	Now, to start, I should say that it's not my place to say whether or not anyone can or cannot get offended by the way the Ferengi are depicted.
5234300	5235300	That's not up to me.
5235300	5241300	But I think we can use the Ferengi here to show what I'd argue is a big problem with not only Rowling's goblins,
5241300	5244300	but her handling of fantasy races in general.
5244300	5250300	So, in their first few appearances on The Next Generation, the Ferengi were used as recurring villains, essentially.
5250300	5257300	They're a contrast to the humans of the Federation in that they're greedy and duplicitous and very misogynistic.
5257300	5263300	And if this is how the Ferengi remained, I'd have nothing more to say here. They would be like Rowling's goblins.
5263300	5269300	What complicates the Ferengi is their later appearances, particularly on the show Deep Space Nine,
5269300	5272300	which introduces several Ferengi characters to the main cast.
5272300	5277300	Principal among these being Quark, the owner of the Space Station's bar.
5277300	5284300	And what we see in this show are Ferengi who grow to differ from their society's expectation of what a good Ferengi should be.
5284300	5290300	We see Quark's nephew Nog insisting he wants to join Starfleet rather than go into business.
5290300	5295300	We see Quark's brother Rom organize a labor strike in protest of how he treats his employees.
5295300	5301300	Even Quark himself occasionally passes up profit in favor of doing the right thing.
5301300	5305300	And we see that wider Ferengi society is also subject to change.
5305300	5314300	Ferengi women, previously forbidden from even wearing clothes, are granted rights over the course of the series, among other political changes.
5314300	5323300	What this all means is that we now know that though the Ferengi are typically greedy and selfish and opportunistic and sexist, they do not have to be.
5324300	5332300	These traits are the cultural and social traits of a particular society, a society that is alive and is subject to change.
5332300	5338300	Over time, the Ferengi become less arguably a stand-in for any one particular group of humans,
5338300	5344300	and more arguably a representation of how people behave under certain societal and cultural conditions.
5344300	5351300	After we witness the existence of Ferengi who defy societal norms and the flexibility of Ferengi society itself,
5351300	5355300	these traits can no longer be construed as simply racial traits.
5355300	5364300	But J.K. Rowling, as we've seen, cannot write flexible societies, so she cannot give any of this additional characterization to her fantasy races.
5364300	5369300	There is none of the depth to Rowling's goblins like there comes to be for the Ferengi.
5369300	5373300	They simply are the way they are because they are goblins.
5374300	5379300	Their different beliefs and behaviors stem from the fact that they are, as Bill Weasley puts it,
5386300	5392300	Now, there's an ongoing conversation about the presentation of fixed racial traits in fantasy races,
5392300	5398300	particularly when it comes to questions of morality, of a race being inherently good or evil.
5398300	5404300	Wizards of the Coast recently removed the racial alignments from the fantasy races of Dungeons and Dragons, for instance,
5404300	5407300	and I agree with that move. I think it's a good one.
5407300	5411300	Not only does it create the opportunity for more interesting stories,
5411300	5420300	a fantasy world having certain races who are just evil by default obviously has some problematic real-world parallels.
5420300	5422300	But back to Rowling's goblins.
5422300	5426300	The principal goblin character in the Harry Potter story is Griphook,
5426300	5431300	who is the goblin from book one who takes Harry to see his giant pile of gulp for the first time.
5431300	5439300	And then he returns in the final book to help Harry and his friends break into Gringotts in order to retrieve one of Voldemort's Horcruxes.
5439300	5444300	Potentially troublesome for this alliance is the history of animosity between wizards and goblins.
5444300	5451300	Goblins are remaining neutral in the conflict with Voldemort. They see it as a wizard matter for wizards to deal with.
5451300	5458300	Griphook and Ron have an argument. Griphook complains about the fact that wizards treat goblins as second-class citizens,
5458300	5466300	and Ron counters that the goblins aren't perfect either and have metalworking secrets they refuse to share with the wizards or whatever.
5466300	5473300	Also complicating things is that goblins have a different idea about the concept of ownership than wizards do.
5473300	5480300	For goblins, whoever first creates an object is the owner, and subsequent purchases are basically rentals,
5480300	5486300	meaning the goblins see goblin-made objects like the sword of Gryffindor as belonging to the goblins.
5486300	5490300	So, what a tricky situation our heroes find themselves in.
5490300	5499300	However, are they going to convince Griphook to ally with them, considering all their differences and the history of division between goblins and wizards?
5499300	5501300	And the answer is, they don't.
5501300	5506300	Harry gets Griphook to work with them temporarily by promising to give him the sword of Gryffindor,
5506300	5510300	but intends to betray him and keep the sword until Voldemort is gone.
5510300	5516300	Griphook likewise betrays Harry and steals the sword midway through the mission before abandoning him.
5516300	5522300	And then despite that, Harry and his friends successfully attain the Horcrux and escape anyway.
5522300	5528300	So, what was the point, we might wonder, of all that stuff about the division between goblins and wizards?
5528300	5534300	You know, here's a history of racial conflict, some racial differences that proved to be irreconcilable,
5534300	5536300	and then it doesn't matter anyway.
5536300	5542300	It's set up like Harry and his friends are going to have to find some way to navigate this conflict in their world,
5542300	5544300	but then they don't. They fail at that.
5544300	5548300	But then they still succeed at their ultimate goal anyway, so it didn't matter.
5548300	5554300	It's almost like Rowling's in two minds about the politics of the fantasy races in her novels.
5554300	5558300	She clearly wants those elements in there, otherwise they wouldn't be in there,
5558300	5563300	but she doesn't want them to actually mean anything or affect the plot in any significant way.
5563300	5568300	What Harry Potter is really missing is a good old council scene, right?
5568300	5574300	So there's a big evil threat to the world, once thought defeated but recently resurgent,
5574300	5577300	and to defeat it is going to take unity and cooperation.
5577300	5580300	However, the peoples of the world are divided.
5580300	5588300	They bicker amongst themselves, and their divisions are exploited by the evil antagonist in order to facilitate his return to power.
5588300	5595300	Now, in Lord of the Rings, Sauron is defeated in a strictly mechanical sense by throwing the ring into Mount Doom,
5595300	5601300	but that act is only possible after the story resolves those previous divisions that it set up.
5601300	5604300	So Rohan needs to be saved.
5604300	5607300	Rohan needs to answer Gondor's call for aid.
5607300	5610300	Legolas and Gimli need to become friends.
5610300	5615300	The Alliance needs to mount a last stand to draw Sauron's forces out of Mordor.
5615300	5619300	Only then is it actually possible to defeat Sauron.
5619300	5625300	In Harry Potter, similar elements are set up in their conflict with Voldemort, but then they just don't pay off.
5625300	5627300	The slaves aren't freed.
5627300	5630300	Non-human races aren't given equal rights.
5630300	5632300	The goblins remain neutral.
5632300	5634300	Harry and Griphook betray each other.
5634300	5636300	Nothing changes in the world.
5636300	5638300	But then they just win anyway.
5638300	5643300	A lot's been said about the disappointing ending of Harry Potter, but like a lot of disappointing endings,
5643300	5648300	it's not that the author was writing a good story and then just messed up at the conclusion.
5648300	5654300	Rather, it's the point at which you're forced to realize that you're never getting a payoff to a lot of what was set up.
5654300	5659300	It's where you have to realize that you've just been reading a disappointing story.
5659300	5663300	There's a scene at the end of the last Harry Potter book after the defeat of Voldemort,
5663300	5668300	which is like a peek into an alternate universe where the story was actually good.
5668300	5673300	McGonagall had replaced the house tables, but nobody was sitting according to house anymore.
5673300	5675300	All were jumbled together.
5675300	5679300	Teachers and pupils, ghosts and parents, centaurs and house elves.
5679300	5682300	Now, this could have been a very powerful image.
5682300	5688300	If defeating Voldemort had meant defeating his supremacist ideology and achieving equality,
5688300	5695300	this scene with all the different people and races sitting where they like un-segregated would have been a fitting conclusion.
5695300	5700300	But the Harry Potter series we have never earns this ending.
5700300	5705300	None of these themes end up being important at all in Harry's final confrontation with Voldemort.
5705300	5712300	The centaurs join the final battle not because anything has changed for them, but because Hagrid nags them, basically.
5712300	5717300	The house elves join the final battle led by Creature not because anything has changed for them,
5717300	5720300	but because Harry is just such a nice slave owner.
5720300	5726300	And as for Harry and Voldemort, Rowling has them talking primarily about wand mechanics.
5726300	5732300	You see, Voldemort previously couldn't kill Harry because their wands share a core or something,
5732300	5739300	so he sought out the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand in the world, in order to finish Harry off for good.
5739300	5745300	The problem is the Elder Wand will only obey its master, and that isn't the person who's holding it,
5745300	5748300	that's the person who defeated its previous owner.
5748300	5756300	Voldemort thinks he is the master of the wand because he killed Snape, who killed Dumbledore, who was the previous master of the wand.
5756300	5762300	Harry thinks he is the master of the wand because before Dumbledore was killed, he was disarmed by Draco,
5762300	5769300	who was in turn later disarmed by Harry at Malfoy Manor, an event for which the Elder Wand was not present.
5769300	5771300	So, the question is this.
5771300	5778300	Does the Elder Wand somehow know that Harry took Draco's wand from him even though it wasn't there?
5778300	5784300	And will the Elder Wand therefore not work when Voldemort uses it to try to cast a killing curse at Harry?
5784300	5788300	And the answer is, of course, who cares?
5788300	5792300	Why is this what Harry and Voldemort are talking about in their final showdown?
5792300	5803300	You know, seven novels of conflict, and their final fight is decided upon by the inscrutable, just-introduced mechanics of a sentient magical stick.
5803300	5807300	They may as well have flipped a coin to decide who wins the final fight.
5807300	5812300	So, the stick decides in Harry's favor, and Voldemort's spell bounces back at him and kills him.
5812300	5820300	He goes out pretty much the same as Gilderoy Lockhart, trying to use a broken wand that backfires and hits him instead.
5820300	5828300	Harry has no active part in any of this, he's just a prop off which Voldemort bounces a spell exactly the same as when he was a baby.
5828300	5835300	Now, not only does the Harry Potter series not earn the scene with all the Hogwarts houses and races sitting wherever they please,
5835300	5841300	it actually undermines it in the actual ending of Harry Potter, the epilogue set 19 years in the future,
5841300	5847300	which shows Harry sending his son off to Hogwarts, with his son worrying that he'll be sorted into Slytherin.
5847300	5851300	So, they've kept Slytherin. They've still kept Slytherin there.
5851300	5856300	Now, I know it's an old joke, why doesn't Hogwarts just get rid of the evil house?
5857300	5866300	But they definitely should have after the fall of Voldemort, when the entirety, all of the Slytherin student body either fled or joined Voldemort.
5866300	5871300	But more than just Slytherin, they've kept the segregation of the school children.
5871300	5874300	The desegregation was just a one-day affair, I guess.
5874300	5881300	And I suppose the house elves got a 15-minute break after Voldemort was killed, and then it was back to work.
5881300	5885300	Actually, the final sentence of the final novel, prior to the epilogue,
5885300	5891300	is Harry wondering if he can get Creature, his slave, to bring him a sandwich.
5891300	5896300	Anyway, this epilogue, where all the characters have paired off and had a dozen kids,
5896300	5901300	all named after the characters who died in the series, is embarrassing to start.
5901300	5904300	It's worse than the cringiest fanfiction.
5904300	5909300	But it's also depressing, because it reveals to us that nothing has changed in this world.
5909300	5912300	This is presented by Rowling as though it's a good thing.
5912300	5918300	But in reality, the ending of Harry Potter is even more dismal an ending than in 1984.
5918300	5920300	Slavery was not ended.
5920300	5922300	Equality was not achieved.
5922300	5928300	We're still segregating the school children according to supposedly innate characteristics.
5928300	5930300	We learned nothing, basically.
5930300	5936300	But now it's 19 years later, and my scar is not hurting, so all is well.
5936300	5941300	Harry Potter is ultimately not the right character for the story he's in.
5941300	5946300	Harry, as a mostly passive audience point of view, works in the first few novels,
5946300	5952300	but as the series goes on and Rowling fully reveals all the problems inherent to the wizarding world,
5952300	5956300	Harry's passivity becomes an unintentional, tragic flaw.
5956300	5962300	We learn in The Cursed Child that an adult Harry has become the head of magical law enforcement.
5962300	5965300	He is the top cop in the wizarding world.
5965300	5970300	It's now his day job to ensure that nothing changes in his society.
5970300	5974300	And he's friends with Hermione, who is now the minister for magic.
5974300	5978300	Hermione did the most homework, which means she gets to be the prime minister,
5978300	5984300	because you see, the real magic in Harry Potter is a functional neoliberal meritocracy.
5984300	5991300	Harry Potter is not just a Cinderella fantasy, it's a liberal fantasy, one in which conservatives get bullied,
5991300	5998300	evil defeats itself, and societal change is unnecessary because the slaves like it where they are.
5998300	5999300	Harry Potter asks,
6005300	6010300	Now, before I leave today, there's still one very pressing question that we haven't answered.
6010300	6013300	Why didn't the wizards stop Hitler?
6013300	6018300	Why didn't the wizards use their magic to prevent the various atrocities of World War II?
6018300	6022300	Now, you might say, it doesn't matter. It's a joke question.
6022300	6026300	There is absolutely no reason we need an actual answer to it.
6026300	6033300	But I feel like I know what's been happening inside J.K. Rowling's mind post the main Harry Potter series.
6033300	6037300	You brats keep asking why the wizards didn't stop World War II.
6037300	6040300	Well, I'll show you.
6040300	6044300	So the Fantastic Beasts movies are set in the decade prior to World War II,
6044300	6051300	and one of antagonist Gellert Grindelwald's stated motivations for his actions is to prevent World War II.
6051300	6055300	Not cause it, but prevent it.
6055300	6059300	At a rally, he shows prophecies of images from World War II.
6059300	6065300	We see the Blitz, a nuclear bomb going off, and a column of people marching beside a series of train cars.
6065300	6067300	So, very classy.
6067300	6070300	Thank you, Fantastic Beasts movies.
6070300	6073300	Come for the whimsical, magical animals.
6073300	6076300	Stay for the grim portrayals of the Holocaust.
6076300	6082300	Now, you might say Grindelwald is being disingenuous in his stated desire to prevent World War II,
6082300	6086300	and is just using it as an excuse to attract people to his cause.
6086300	6090300	But as an audience watching it today, we know that he was right.
6090300	6092300	His prophecies were accurate.
6092300	6094300	These things did happen.
6094300	6098300	And we also know that the wizards didn't stop World War II.
6098300	6103300	And this isn't some dangerous butterfly effect messing about with the time machine stuff.
6103300	6106300	These events are future events for the characters in the story.
6106300	6109300	There's no reason they shouldn't want to prevent this,
6109300	6114300	but the only person who even claims to want to prevent it is the bad guy.
6114300	6122300	Now, what this means is that when Dumbledore and Newt Scamander and their Fantastic Beasts are fighting against Grindelwald,
6122300	6127300	they're fighting to save World War II and make sure that it happens.
6127300	6134300	This is the anti-change ideology of the Harry Potter series taken to its logical end point, right?
6134300	6139300	The wizards didn't stop Hitler, because stopping Hitler is wrong.
6139300	6145300	Now, I've no idea how close the Fantastic Beasts movies are actually going to get to World War II,
6145300	6150300	but Rowling once stated on Twitter that the series is supposed to end in 1945,
6150300	6152300	which would mean that they cover all of it.
6152300	6156300	Now, I'll end with a plea from me to J.K. Rowling today.
6156300	6160300	So, listen, Joanne, please don't.
6160300	6162300	This isn't something we need to see.
6162300	6167300	There's no good answer to the question, why didn't the wizards stop Hitler?
6167300	6173300	You can't write your way out of this. You're not good enough. Just accept it.
6173300	6179300	The best case scenario here is that this series gets cancelled before we see what you're planning.
6179300	6184300	Now, before I go today, I'm going to wrap up with a few clarifications.
6184300	6189300	Firstly, this video is not meant to be an exhaustive list of everything wrong with Harry Potter.
6189300	6191300	There's plenty I didn't mention.
6191300	6197300	For instance, Rowling once stated that her werewolves were supposed to be a metaphor for having HIV,
6197300	6204300	and then she made one of her main werewolf characters a predator who attacks children to purposely infect them with werewolfism.
6204300	6206300	I didn't mention that.
6206300	6211300	Well, I did right now as an example of something I didn't mention, but you know what I mean.
6211300	6217300	I'd also like to make clear that Harry Potter's anti-change problem is by no means unique.
6217300	6222300	Think of all the Hollywood blockbusters in which the good side are those seeking to preserve the status quo,
6222300	6228300	and the antagonists are people with legitimate grievances about the world and a desire to change it,
6228300	6235300	and then they pull a cheap trick and have the antagonists just murder a baby or something so the audience knows that they're the bad guys.
6235300	6241300	This is art produced by the rich, people who have done very well under capitalism, thank you very much,
6241300	6248300	and therefore see all systemic change as inherently evil, no matter how reasonable it might seem on the surface.
6248300	6257300	Next, I'd like to clarify that my criticisms of Harry Potter aren't a moral condemnation of anyone who still finds things to enjoy about the books.
6257300	6260300	I've compared Harry Potter to a bunch of other stories today,
6260300	6264300	and I'd like to make clear that I'm not saying Harry Potter is the wrong way to do things,
6264300	6270300	and those other stories are the right way, necessarily, because it's more complicated than that.
6270300	6276300	In the specific instances I compared them to Harry Potter, I believe they are better or more interesting,
6276300	6279300	but that obviously doesn't mean they're without problems themselves.
6279300	6283300	Lord of the Rings obviously has issues with its evil fantasy races.
6283300	6290300	Deep Space Nine, while excellent a lot of the time, has also broadcast some of the worst episodes of television ever created,
6290300	6293300	and the Discworld novel Snuff has its own problems.
6293300	6299300	Now, I'd argue it is to a degree aware of some of its problems and does investigate them in the text,
6299300	6306300	but at the end of the day, it still is a story about a powerful white guy turning up and solving a bunch of other people's problems.
6306300	6314300	Now, while that's still very much more satisfying to read than Harry Potter's complete refusal to engage with his society's problems,
6314300	6317300	that's not a trope that is without its harmful aspects.
6317300	6320300	We have had a lot of those stories, haven't we?
6320300	6326300	So, yes, if you still like Harry Potter, don't worry, I'm not saying you're a Slytherin.
