00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about Harry Potter.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,600
Now, I could do the standard video essay introduction for Harry Potter, you know?

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:14,800
It's a series of books, a series of films, video games, a stage play, a whole bunch of merchandise and all that,

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,000
but we all know who Harry Potter is, right?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It'd be better if I started by explaining why I want to talk about Harry Potter today.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,600
And there's a few reasons.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,900
Firstly, there was recently another round of discussion about J.K. Rowling's goblins.

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:36,500
In recent years, there's a few different types of discourse relating to Harry Potter that come and go on social media.

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,700
People talk about Rowling's goblins being possibly similar to anti-Semitic stereotypes.

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,700
People talk about the problematic natural slave race who like their slavery,

11
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:53,500
the queer baiting with characters who were stated by Rowling to be gay but never explicitly depicted as gay,

12
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:59,800
her attempts to retroactively add more diversity to the Harry Potter world than she initially depicted,

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,800
and a whole host of other topics.

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:10,500
This drive to re-examine and criticize Harry Potter is undoubtedly fueled, to some extent, by the actions of the author in recent years.

15
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:17,000
J.K. Rowling is a committed and very vocal opponent of trans rights and, well, I'm not gonna rehash all that here.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,300
There are several videos on YouTube which thoroughly cover J.K. Rowling's transphobia, and I'll link some of those below.

17
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:32,600
But for our purposes today, all we need to know is that J.K. Rowling's statements on trans rights have put her at odds with a lot of people who previously enjoyed her work.

18
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,600
And people naturally want to work that out, right?

19
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,100
How could a children's book author who wrote such a beloved series go on to be such a bigot?

20
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,100
Perhaps the signs were there all along.

21
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,800
Now, whenever it comes time to re-examine the Harry Potter series, I confess I feel very left out.

22
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:55,600
I read the first three, maybe four books as a young lad, but then I guess I got too old for them.

23
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,300
Or maybe they just got too long. She really got away from the editors at some point.

24
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,600
Those later books can be a real slog.

25
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,600
But still, I wanted to know how fair are these criticisms of Harry Potter? Do they hold water?

26
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,300
Now, it wouldn't be exactly fair for me to start offering opinions having not read the books.

27
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:20,300
So, I went and read the Harry Potter books, I watched the movies, I watched the Fantastic Beasts movies, which were rubbish and weird.

28
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:26,800
I read a whole bunch of Pottermore articles, the short stories from Hogwarts, the script of the stage play.

29
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,800
I even read the casual vacancy and a few bits here and there of Rowling's detective series.

30
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:39,800
What all this means is I am now a certified Harry Potter expert, and I can get involved in the discourse entirely guilt-free.

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,300
So, I'm going to do my own Harry Potter discourse retrospective today.

32
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,800
There's a lot to talk about, and I think it's only fitting that we begin at the beginning.

33
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:57,300
So, at the beginning of the first Harry Potter novel, The Philosopher's Stone, we are introduced to Harry's aunt and uncle, the Dursleys.

34
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:07,300
And we follow his uncle Vernon Dursley as he goes about his day, noticing various magical folk celebrating the apparent demise of series antagonist Lord Voldemort.

35
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,800
Now, what do we learn about Vernon Dursley in the opening chapters of the first Harry Potter book?

36
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Well, he's quick to anger, he is narrow-minded, he dislikes anything out of the ordinary or improper,

37
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,800
and he's bigoted towards people he sees as being different from himself.

38
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,800
He's a conservative, basically. He and his wife are Rowling's liberal skewering of typical conservatives.

39
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,800
She even has Vernon reading the Daily Mail in a later book.

40
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Vernon is verbally and physically abusive to Harry because Harry is a little magical lad, and Vernon hates magic.

41
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:47,800
He wants the magical and non-magical worlds to stay far apart, and he's willing to go to extremes to keep them that way.

42
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,800
We're also introduced to Harry's cousin Dudley, who is a spoiled bully who is also abusive to Harry.

43
00:03:53,800 --> 00:04:01,300
Dudley is going to a fancy private school, Smeltings, whereas Harry is going to Stonewall High, the local comprehensive,

44
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,300
which Dudley implies is rough and full of bullies.

45
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:11,300
Now, do I think it was intentional that Rowling called the scary school for paws that Harry is worried about attending Stonewall?

46
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,300
Probably not, but it is funny now.

47
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,300
Now, Harry's first contact with the wizarding world, once he's older than a baby, that is,

48
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,800
is Hagrid, who turns up to deliver Harry's invitation to attend Hogwarts.

49
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:30,300
Now, as he's introduced to us here, Hagrid is, in many regards, exactly the same as Vernon Dursley.

50
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:37,800
Now, if any Harry Potter fans are listening, I'm sure you just raised an eyebrow at me comparing lovable old Hagrid to Harry's uncle, Vernon.

51
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,800
But if we examine their actions and their beliefs, they are, in many ways, a mirror of each other.

52
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Hagrid is quick to anger. He threatens Vernon physically after he insults Albus Dumbledore.

53
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:56,300
Hagrid is physically abusive. He uses magic to disfigure a child because he's having an argument with his father.

54
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,300
He gives Dudley a pig's tail, which has to be removed with surgery.

55
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,300
Hagrid doesn't like people who are different from him.

56
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,800
Muggles. He uses the word muggle not just as a descriptor, but as an insult.

57
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,300
It means mundane, dull, and unspecial.

58
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:18,800
Hagrid wants the magical and non-magical worlds to stay far apart, and he's willing to support extremes to keep it that way.

59
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,800
When Harry asks why the Ministry of Magic works to keep the existence of magic a secret,

60
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Hagrid responds,

61
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,300
One of Hagrid's functions in his introduction to Harry here is to serve as comeuppance for the Dursleys,

62
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,800
to give them a taste of their own medicine.

63
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Hagrid and his magic are divine retribution.

64
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,800
Dudley likes to bully people, so he gets bullied by Hagrid.

65
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,300
Dudley was going to a fancier school than Harry, now Harry is going to a fancier school than him.

66
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:59,800
Vernon likes to other those different to him, and so he gets othered by Hagrid, made into a muggle.

67
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,300
Now, while it might be satisfying from the audience's perspective to watch Dudley,

68
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,800
who they know is a bully, be treated the way he treats others,

69
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,800
from Hagrid's perspective, he's just disfiguring a child he just met, you know?

70
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:20,800
A similar scene happens in the fourth book, when Fred and George Weasley poison Dudley with a sweep that makes his tongue grow to be a foot long.

71
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,300
And then the next chapter opens with Harry and the Weasleys all laughing at Dudley.

72
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,300
Now, this is strange.

73
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:33,300
Firstly, the Weasley twins have never met Dudley before, so they poison him off second-hand information, basically.

74
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:39,800
But also it's strange because Rowling forgets to have Dudley do anything bad in the opening of the fourth book.

75
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,800
He doesn't do anything to Harry or anyone else.

76
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,300
Rowling's just coasting off his previous bad behavior in the earlier books.

77
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,300
Well, actually, I tell a lie.

78
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:55,300
Dudley does do one thing that J.K. Rowling considers to be very bad and worthy of punishment,

79
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,800
and that is be overweight.

80
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:04,300
Just in Goblet of Fire, for instance, we're treated to descriptions of Dudley being as big as a young killer whale,

81
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,800
being wider than he is tall, too fat to hide behind his parents.

82
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,800
We hear about his porky hands, his piggy eyes, his massive backside.

83
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,300
And the comic relief of the opening chapters is that Dudley is struggling to stay on a diet.

84
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:24,800
Harry even mocks him about this before sneaking off to eat some cakes that he's concealed.

85
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,300
This is all why it's funny that Dudley later eats a poisoned sweet.

86
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,800
I suppose.

87
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,300
This is one of the things that really jumped out at me reading the Harry Potter books,

88
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:41,300
just how much time is devoted early on in each story to making fun of Dudley for being overweight.

89
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,800
Rowling just really seems to have it in for fat people,

90
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,300
and she gets worse in the casual vacancy published after the Harry Potter books

91
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,800
when one unsympathetic character is introduced in the following way.

92
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,800
He was an extravagantly obese man of 64.

93
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,800
A great apron of stomach fell so far down in front of his thighs

94
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,300
that most people thought instantly of his penis when they first clapped eyes on him,

95
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,800
wondering when he had last seen it, how he washed it,

96
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,800
how he managed to perform any of the acts for which a penis is designed.

97
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,300
Now, I think it's very telling that Rowling would write that most people think things like this when,

98
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,300
well, I can only speak for myself here, but if I see an obese guy,

99
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,800
I don't immediately start thinking about him washing his penis.

100
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,300
But JK Rowling does, so we know that now.

101
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,300
Rowling has defended her presentation of fat characters

102
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,800
by pointing to characters like Molly Weasley, who is overweight,

103
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,300
but this is rubbish, honestly.

104
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,300
There's a big difference between presenting a disgusting fat character

105
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,800
greedily stuffing their piggy face like Dudley,

106
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,800
and presenting a jolly plump character, which is what Molly is.

107
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Molly is described as plump.

108
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,800
One of the things I much preferred about the way the movies tell the Harry Potter story

109
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,300
is that they cut out a lot of the general meanness and cruelty that exist in the books.

110
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,300
Rowling doesn't just mock overweight characters.

111
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,300
If a character's supposed to be unsympathetic in the books,

112
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,800
the gloves come off with regards to physical descriptions.

113
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,800
For instance, consider the Slytherin girl who, quote,

114
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,800
"...reminded Harry of a picture he'd seen in Holidays with hags.

115
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,800
She was large and square, and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively."

116
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Reporter Rita Skeeter also has hair that contrasts oddly with her heavy-jawed face,

117
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,300
and we elsewhere hear about her large, mannish hands.

118
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,300
Vernon's sister Marge is, quote,

119
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,300
"...large, beefy, purple-faced, and even had a moustache."

120
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,800
If a character is supposed to be bad,

121
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,300
then Rowling usually presents them as being physically ugly,

122
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,800
and for women, the way she makes them ugly is to make them large and masculine.

123
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,800
And if this all sounds misogynistic, it's because it is.

124
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,800
Even beyond physical descriptions, the characters themselves, even Harry and his friends,

125
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,800
have a real mean streak in the books that was largely excised in the movies.

126
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
And let's look at one example of this.

127
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
There's a scene in The Order of the Phoenix

128
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,300
where the evil Dolores Umbridge fires the Hogwarts divination teacher, Professor Trelawney,

129
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,300
and tries to have her evicted from the school.

130
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,300
This scene is depicted rather differently in the book than in the movie.

131
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,300
In the movie, Trelawney is more of a sympathetic figure.

132
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,300
She's supposed to come across as helpless and frail,

133
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,800
someone who it would be especially cruel to bully,

134
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,800
to highlight just how awful Umbridge is being.

135
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,300
In this scene in the books, Trelawney is ranting, drunk,

136
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,800
and waving a sherry bottle around her head,

137
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
because in the books, she's an alcoholic,

138
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,800
because that's funny, isn't it? Alcoholism.

139
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,300
The movie has Harry and Hermione looking on all sad at this obvious injustice,

140
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,800
whereas in the books, they don't really care.

141
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,300
They don't like Trelawney.

142
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,300
Hermione even outright states,

143
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,300
I don't care if she throws out Trelawney, but she's not taking Hagrid.

144
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:00,300
The movies take the approach that while Trelawney might be annoying and a bit of a fraud,

145
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,300
she isn't evil. She isn't a bad person.

146
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,300
She doesn't actually deserve to be humiliated.

147
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,300
She's still part of Hogwarts, right?

148
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:14,300
The movies understand that the audience will still have sympathy for her if she's treated unfairly,

149
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,800
even if she happens to be annoying.

150
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,800
In the books, however, Trelawney mostly just pops up whenever J.K. Rowling wants to make fun of alcoholism.

151
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,800
Rowling does not expect the audience to have sympathy for Trelawney.

152
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,800
She's annoying and a bit of a fraud, so it's open season to be as cruel as you like.

153
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,300
Movie Hermione looks like she's about to cry when she sees Trelawney get fired.

154
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,300
Book Hermione could watch Professor Trelawney be slowly beaten to death by a Bludger,

155
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,300
and she wouldn't feel a single thing.

156
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,800
Anyway, let's move on by asking a question.

157
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:51,300
Is it wrong in the Harry Potter series to make fun of someone for being overweight?

158
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,300
Now, the obvious answer, you might think, is no,

159
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,300
because Harry makes fun of Dudley for being overweight,

160
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,300
Hagrid makes fun of Dudley for being overweight,

161
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,800
the narration makes fun of Dudley for being overweight, and this is all played for laughs.

162
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,300
It's not presented as the same type of bullying as Dudley's bullying.

163
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,300
It's not considered deserving of retribution.

164
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:19,300
However, we also see both Draco Malfoy and Vernon Dursley make fun of Molly Weasley for being overweight,

165
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,300
something which outrages Harry and his friends.

166
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,300
It's understood that it's wrong to make fun of Molly for being overweight.

167
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,800
When Draco insults Molly's weight, it isn't played for laughs.

168
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,300
It's used to illustrate how rude and insulting Draco is.

169
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,300
So is it wrong to make fun of someone for being overweight?

170
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,300
And the answer is, it depends on if you're a good or a bad person,

171
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,300
and whether your target is a good or a bad person.

172
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:49,300
But whether you're a good or a bad person is totally divorced from whether or not you mock people for their weight.

173
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,300
Now, this is just one example, obviously,

174
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:56,300
but this disconnect is typical for most actions in the Harry Potter stories.

175
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,800
What is done isn't so important compared to who is doing it.

176
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,300
Outside of extreme examples, like murdering a bunch of people,

177
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,800
there aren't really good or bad actions in the Harry Potter universe.

178
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:13,800
There are only good and bad teams, sometimes literal good and bad teams.

179
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,800
Characters are assigned good or bad as labels,

180
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,300
and whether their actions are considered good or bad follows from that.

181
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,300
As another example, we could ask,

182
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:27,300
is owning slaves wrong, as it's presented to us in the Harry Potter stories?

183
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,300
Which, again, we have to answer with, it depends.

184
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,300
Are you a good slave owner or a bad slave owner?

185
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,800
Now, just to head off a potential criticism here,

186
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,300
you might say, Sean, what are you expecting here, morality-wise,

187
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,800
from the children's book series written for little babies?

188
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,300
Aren't you taking this a little bit too seriously?

189
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,800
And the answer to that is that I don't really like the assumption

190
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,300
that stories are unable to be criticized because they're for children.

191
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,800
After all, you can have stories for children that are executed very well,

192
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,800
and stories for children that are executed very poorly.

193
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,800
Also, while the first stories are written for little babies,

194
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,300
the later Harry Potter novels are intended for increasingly older audiences.

195
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,800
Rowling tried to increase the target reading age of the novels

196
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,300
along with the main characters, and she did this in a few ways.

197
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,300
Firstly, the novels get more complicated, they get much longer.

198
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,300
Much longer than they have to be, I'd add.

199
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,300
They get much more violent, minors start getting killed.

200
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,800
That's minors with an O, not, like, minors.

201
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,800
Beloved characters like Sirius and Dumbledore start getting murdered.

202
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,300
Spoiler warning.

203
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,300
The main character's cute pet owl gets murdered, and then it explodes.

204
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,300
It's rough.

205
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,300
The stories also get more sexualized as the characters age through their teens

206
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,300
and start experiencing all of those teenage hormones,

207
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,800
and it also gets increasingly political.

208
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,800
In the early novels, politics is something that children occasionally glimpse

209
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,300
adults doing, but it's largely above their ability to influence, because they're 12.

210
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,800
Later, however, the politics of the wizarding world become a key component of the stories.

211
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,800
The Ministry of Magic becomes an important setting,

212
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,800
the Minister of Magic an important character,

213
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,800
and the actual non-wizarding Prime Minister is a point of view character in Book 6.

214
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,800
So how does this aging up and complicating of the series

215
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,800
relate to the presentation of good and evil?

216
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,300
Well, when the series starts, things are very simplistic.

217
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,800
Basically, all evil in the wizarding world stems from Voldemort.

218
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,300
If someone is bad, it's because they're a follower of Voldemort,

219
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,800
or the child of a follower of Voldemort.

220
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,300
Everyone in Slytherin is bad because they're the bad team.

221
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,300
Things are very black and white.

222
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,800
Now, despite attempting to mature other aspects of the series,

223
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Rowling never gets away from this overly simplistic presentation of morality.

224
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,300
She makes a few attempts, but they prove to be false starts.

225
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,800
She always ends up right back here in the first novel,

226
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,800
where all evil stems from Voldemort, who murders people because he's bad.

227
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,300
And it makes for rather frustrating reading.

228
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,300
Rowling frequently threatens to make the series more interesting,

229
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,800
introducing several ideas that seem very much like setups for a later payoff,

230
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,300
but then that payoff just never comes.

231
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:22,300
As an example here, let's talk about the fountain in the main hall of the Ministry of Magic.

232
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,800
This is introduced in the Order of the Phoenix and described as follows.

233
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,300
Now, if you get wizard-supremacist vibes from this statue, you're supposed to.

234
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:56,800
This is all a conscious reference to real-world statues that give off white supremacist colonialist vibes,

235
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,300
featuring usually white men in positions of power, lording over their presumed inferiors.

236
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,800
So in this statue, you've got a wizard holding up his wand, the symbol of his power,

237
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,800
above the lesser races, who were forbidden by the Ministry of Magic to use wands themselves.

238
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,300
That's an idea introduced in Book 4.

239
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,300
The House Elves are a slave race.

240
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,800
The centaurs are classified as beasts and restricted to particular territories.

241
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:25,800
Even the goblins who run the wizard banking system don't have equal rights.

242
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:31,300
This statue is important later on, as it's the site of the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort.

243
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,800
The statues either get destroyed or are brought to life to participate in the duel,

244
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,800
and Voldemort ends up standing on the statue's plinth.

245
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:44,300
And this is the site of the reveal of Voldemort's return to wider wizarding society, right?

246
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,300
So this is a very simple metaphor, you would think.

247
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:52,800
This statue is a literal monument to the hypocrisies and inequalities in the wizarding world.

248
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:59,300
And it's here that Voldemort is revealed to the world because it's from this inequality and hypocrisy that he draws his power.

249
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,800
It turns out that not all evil in the world stems from Voldemort.

250
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,800
Quite the opposite, in fact.

251
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:12,300
Voldemort's authoritarian violence and desire for control is merely an extension of the systems that already exist in the world.

252
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,300
The ministry has no argument against Voldemort on an ethical level.

253
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:22,300
The wizards own slaves, they run a torture prison, they deny equal rights to non-wizards.

254
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:28,300
There are actually repeated worries in the novels that Voldemort will draw various races of creatures to his side,

255
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:35,300
specifically because he might be able to offer them a better life than what the wizard supremacist ministry is currently imposing upon them.

256
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:41,300
We even learn later that Voldemort was able to literally get away with a murder he committed by framing a house elf,

257
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:46,300
something he knew would not be investigated due to discrimination against house elves.

258
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:51,300
So the systemic inequalities and discrimination in the wizarding world enforced by the Ministry of Magic

259
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:57,300
are providing both the opportunity and ideological groundwork for Voldemort to rise to power.

260
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:04,300
Crucially, Voldemort's ideal world isn't fundamentally different to the one currently enforced by the ministry.

261
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:10,300
He just wants to extend the persecution to also include muggles and non-pureblood wizards.

262
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:18,300
He wants to discriminate against certain humans, like the wizards as a whole already discriminate against the other races.

263
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,300
This is seen when Voldemort gets to redecorate the ministry in the last novel,

264
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:27,300
and he puts his own statue in place which has a witch and a wizard sitting on a throne of muggles.

265
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,300
Unless you think I'm reading into these statues too much,

266
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,300
Dumbledore explicitly states after his duel with Voldemort,

267
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,300
The fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie.

268
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:43,300
We wizards have mistreated and abused our fellows for too long, and we are now reaping our reward.

269
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:49,300
Now, having set all of this up, you might expect Rowling to then do something with it.

270
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:55,300
You know, go on to tell a story in which the various systemic problems in the wizarding world are resolved,

271
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,300
or at least addressed in some way.

272
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:03,300
After the addition of all of these elements, the story can't simply be about defeating Voldemort anymore.

273
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:08,300
Defeating Voldemort at this point should mean defeating his supremacist ideology,

274
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:14,300
which by necessity means defeating the supremacist ideology inherent to the wider wizarding world.

275
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:19,300
Merely defeating Voldemort in a contest of power can't be a satisfying ending anymore,

276
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,300
because after how horrible the status quo has been made to seem,

277
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:29,300
simply beating Voldemort in a fight and then returning to the status quo must be seen as a failure.

278
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,300
Anyway, spoiler alert, none of this gets resolved.

279
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,300
Voldemort's defeated despite it all, and the final sentence of the novels is,

280
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,300
All was well.

281
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:42,300
All is well, but yes, we are keeping the slaves.

282
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,300
We're the good guys.

283
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,300
So you might be asking, why put in all of these elements if they're not going to be utilized?

284
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:54,300
You know, why attempt to complicate your story beyond a simplistic tale of good versus evil

285
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:58,300
if you're just gonna unceremoniously drop all that to write an ending that contradicts it all?

286
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,300
You know, what is J.K. Rowling doing?

287
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:05,300
One of Rowling's flaws as a writer relates to her not planning ahead,

288
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,300
not just with the politics and morality of the series, but with everything.

289
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:15,300
She often introduces elements to her world with apparently no thought as to the later consequences,

290
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:19,300
and for a very fun example of this, let's talk about time turners.

291
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:24,300
So time turners are little portable time machines that enable the user to go back in time.

292
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,300
They're introduced in The Prisoner of Azkaban,

293
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:32,300
and Harry and Hermione use one at the climax of the story to save and free Buckbeak the Hippogriff

294
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,300
and Harry's godfather Sirius Black,

295
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,300
which, you know, is fine in and of itself.

296
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:42,300
However, the potential problem with introducing time travel to your fantasy series

297
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,300
is that your fantasy series has time travel in it now.

298
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:51,300
So going forward, you have to account for the fact that characters can travel through time to resolve problems.

299
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,300
Otherwise, any time anything unfortunate happens,

300
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:58,300
everyone will be asking why the characters aren't using their time machine to fix it.

301
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,300
One way to do this is to make time travel difficult to accomplish somehow.

302
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:08,300
So thinking ahead, you impose limits on the way the time travel mechanism can be used.

303
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,300
So you have a time machine that only works in certain circumstances,

304
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,300
or requires a certain object or fuel to function.

305
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:20,300
Or the Disquelt novel Nightwatch, for instance, features time travel as the result of a magical accident,

306
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,300
so it's not easily repeatable going forward.

307
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:29,300
Rowling's time machines, on the other hand, are small, easily portable, apparently infinitely usable,

308
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:34,300
and they're introduced because one is handed out to a 13-year-old so she can do extra homework.

309
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,300
And you know what? If they were just used as a comedic bit, that's fine.

310
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:44,300
You could say they only work on trivial things, like Hermione can take extra classes at wizard school, say,

311
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,300
but you couldn't use them to save a life or anything dramatic like that.

312
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:53,300
But then the time turner is used in the conclusion of the story to save Sirius and Buckbeak,

313
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:59,300
so now you've got an indeterminate amount of these little time machines in your stories that have no limits on their use.

314
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:03,300
They can apparently do anything, and they're handing them out to actual children.

315
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,300
Now, the next novel in the series, The Goblet of Fire,

316
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:11,300
features the death at the end of the book of beloved character Cedric Diggory.

317
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,300
I'm assuming he was beloved. Somebody probably loved him.

318
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,300
So anyway, Cedric dies, and readers at the time probably wondered,

319
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:25,300
what happened to all of those time machines, right? Just give one of those a twist and prevent Cedric from dying.

320
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:30,300
But there is no mention of time turners in The Goblet of Fire. It's like Rowling just forgot about them.

321
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,300
And you know what? I'm not even gonna criticize that necessarily.

322
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:39,300
Rowling thought of one story with time machines in it, and then she didn't want to deal with them anymore, so she didn't.

323
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:44,300
And if she left it there, I'd actually kind of respect that. That's what the movies did, after all.

324
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,300
Because ultimately, it doesn't really matter, does it?

325
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:52,300
It's not a fatal flaw if your fun fantasy series isn't that coherently planned out.

326
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,300
These aren't killer criticisms.

327
00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:00,300
If Rowling just never addressed the time turners again, most of her audience wouldn't care too much.

328
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:06,300
Cinema sins would ding it. You'd maybe have a few YouTube videos or BuzzFeed articles called, like,

329
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:12,300
The Dark Side of Harry Potter, Why Didn't the Wizards Use a Time Machine to Stop Hitler, or whatever.

330
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,300
But again, that's just for fun criticism. It wouldn't really matter.

331
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:22,300
Why didn't the eagles fly the ring into Mount Doom? Because they didn't. You know, whatever.

332
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:31,300
Plus, setting your story in a magic school gives you very generous space for literal, a wizard did it, plot hole explanations, right?

333
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:37,300
It would be very easy for Rowling to say, time turners can't undo the killing curse, or whatever.

334
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:43,300
If you use a time machine to save someone who gets killing cursed, they just die anyway, so it would be pointless to save Cedric.

335
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:50,300
There you go. Simple explanation based on magical rules of which she is the master, so there'd be no way to argue with that.

336
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:56,300
The problem is, JK Rowling can't leave well enough alone when it comes to the time turners,

337
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,300
and she did a series of very strange and funny things.

338
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,300
Now, the first funny thing she did was, in Book 5, the one after Cedric dies,

339
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:11,300
in a move that feels very much like a response to people asking about the time turners, she destroys all of the time turners.

340
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,300
So Neville Longbottom is fighting a Death Eater in the Ministry of Magic,

341
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:21,300
and they accidentally destroy a cabinet which has all of the time turners in it.

342
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:27,300
All of them. They're all just on the same shelf, and then they all get knocked over, and they're gone.

343
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,300
That's unfortunate, isn't it?

344
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:40,300
I love this. This is the clumsiest, literally the clumsiest, most lazy way of getting time travel out of your story.

345
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:47,300
Sorry, everyone. Neville knocked time travel over, so we can't do that anymore. It's brilliant.

346
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:54,300
Now, the next funny thing she did, again, in a move that feels very much like a response to people asking about Cedric Diggory,

347
00:25:54,300 --> 00:26:00,300
is show us just how horrible the world would be if Cedric Diggory survived.

348
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:06,300
So Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a stage play which is based on a story written by Rowling.

349
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:13,300
In that play, Harry Potter's son goes back in time using a time turner in order to save the life of Cedric Diggory,

350
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:17,300
and he saves Cedric's life by making him lose the Triwizard Tournament,

351
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:24,300
meaning he doesn't touch the port key at the end and so isn't present at the end of the Goblet of Fire for Voldemort to order his death.

352
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:32,300
And as a result of losing the Triwizard Tournament, Cedric is so embarrassed that he becomes a Death Eater.

353
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,300
Really?

354
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,300
And he fights on Voldemort's side in the Battle of Hogwarts.

355
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:47,300
He kills Neville Longbottom, which ensures that Voldemort wins, who then goes on to be the dictator of the Wizarding World.

356
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:52,300
Now, this is amazing. It's like it's a wonderful life, but in reverse.

357
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:56,300
You know, look how awful it would be if you survived, Cedric.

358
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:01,300
Cedric Diggory. It's a horrible life. That's what they should have called it.

359
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:07,300
And what this all means is when Dumbledore eulogizes Cedric in the Goblet of Fire, you know, he was a good and loyal friend,

360
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:12,300
a hard worker, he valued fair play, he was good and kind and brave.

361
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:21,300
No, sorry Dumbledore, he wasn't. He was actually only one bad day away from becoming a fascist murderer, and it's good he died.

362
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,300
Jesus Christ.

363
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:27,300
You see, it isn't so much that Rowling doesn't plan ahead that is the problem here.

364
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:32,300
It's her later attempts to go back and fill plot holes that really damages the story.

365
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:38,300
I actually have my own theory about what happened with the Time-Turners, and it's called the One-Book Lag Theory.

366
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:42,300
It's something I noticed with a few other elements in the Harry Potter novels.

367
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:47,300
What happens is Rowling will introduce some element to a story that seems like a big deal,

368
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:52,300
and that you would expect to still exist in the next novel, only it doesn't. It just vanishes.

369
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,300
And this may have led to readers inquiring as to where it went.

370
00:27:55,300 --> 00:28:01,300
So then, in the next novel, as a reaction to criticism of the missing element, Rowling will knock it off the shelf.

371
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:08,300
So we get time travel introduced in book three, it vanishes for book four, then falls off the shelf in book five.

372
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:12,300
And there's another of these in the second book, The Chamber of Secrets.

373
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:16,300
In that novel, the poverty of the Weasley family is a repeated theme.

374
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:21,300
We see the Weasley children wondering how their parents are going to pay for all of their school things.

375
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:27,300
The Weasley boys get hand-me-downs, but the parents need to buy all new things for their daughter Ginny.

376
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:34,300
There's a heartbreaking scene where we see Molly Weasley reaching into the corners of her bank vault looking for more coins.

377
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:40,300
And through all this, Harry feels embarrassed and guilty because not only are the Weasley family keeping him as a guest,

378
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:45,300
he's rich. He's got a huge pile of gold that his parents left for him.

379
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:50,300
Then, to make matters worse, Ron and Harry steal the Weasleys' car and not only lose it,

380
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:54,300
Ron's dad gets a huge fine for owning it illegally.

381
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:59,300
So on the one hand, Harry has a guilty conscience about costing the Weasleys so much gold.

382
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,300
And on the other hand, he has a giant pile of gold.

383
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:07,300
Now, the repeated mentions of both the poverty of the Weasley family and of Harry's guilt

384
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:12,300
creates an expectation for the audience that this will be resolved in some way.

385
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:17,300
And the payoff to this seeming setup is nothing. There just isn't one.

386
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:22,300
The Weasleys are poor, Harry is rich and costs them a whole bunch of money and feels bad about it.

387
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,300
And that's it. No conclusion.

388
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:29,300
Now, technically, he saves Ginny's life at the end of the story,

389
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,300
so you can see that as a payoff to what Harry owes the Weasleys if you like,

390
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,300
but I find that unsatisfying.

391
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:41,300
I don't believe that if a different student, say Neville, had been kidnapped by an evil book,

392
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,300
Harry would have been like,

393
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:46,300
Well, I don't owe Neville's family any money, so I'm not getting involved.

394
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,300
No, he would have saved the day anyway.

395
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,300
This ending has nothing to do with the poverty theme.

396
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:56,300
And I find this all a little frustrating in light of something which happens in the very first novel,

397
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,300
the first time that Harry meets Ron.

398
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:03,300
In this initial meeting on the train to Hogwarts, Ron can't afford to buy food from the trolley,

399
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:07,300
and he's got some horrible sandwiches his mum made for him that he doesn't even like.

400
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,300
Harry can afford to buy food from the trolley and wants to share it with Ron,

401
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:15,300
so he offers to trade for some of Ron's sandwiches.

402
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,300
Now, I like this scene. It's nice.

403
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,300
We're learning about our main characters, right?

404
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,300
Ron is poor and embarrassed about that.

405
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:27,300
Harry was poor, but then was suddenly made very rich, and he's embarrassed about that.

406
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,300
Harry wants to share with Ron.

407
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,300
He values friendship more than money,

408
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:37,300
but he's also emotionally intelligent enough to navigate doing so without hurting Ron's feelings,

409
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,300
hence pretending he wants some of Ron's horrible sandwiches.

410
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:45,300
And if you liked this early instance of the characters managing to overcome their social embarrassment

411
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,300
in order to share with each other,

412
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:51,300
I hope you got your fill, because it's not going to be happening again.

413
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,300
A case in point here.

414
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,300
Ron's wand in the Chamber of Secrets.

415
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,300
Ron's wand gets broken early on in the story.

416
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,300
He needs a new wand, but he doesn't want to write home asking for one

417
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,300
because he doesn't want his parents to be mad at him for breaking it,

418
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,300
and it's not like they can afford the expense anyway.

419
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:11,300
Every time Ron's broken wand came up in the story, I was thinking,

420
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,300
why doesn't Harry just buy Ron a new wand?

421
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,300
You know, he can afford it, Ron can't,

422
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:22,300
and Harry's just watching his best friend all year try to use this broken wand

423
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:27,300
that backfires and injures him, and he's not doing anything.

424
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,300
Why isn't he doing anything?

425
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:33,300
So we can say maybe it's embarrassing to buy your friend a wand,

426
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,300
but as shown in the previous novel,

427
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:40,300
Harry is supposed to be emotionally intelligent enough to navigate these sorts of interactions.

428
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,300
So the sort of thing he could do is give Ron a wand on an occasion

429
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,300
that it's appropriate to get other people presents, right?

430
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,300
Say, Ron's birthday or Christmas.

431
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:54,300
Hogwarts celebrates Christmas, you see, and the characters give each other presents.

432
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:58,300
For instance, in the Chamber of Secrets, Harry gets a tin of fudge from Hagrid,

433
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,300
Hermione gives him a new quill, Ron gives him a book,

434
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,300
and Harry gives them, in return, nothing.

435
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,300
Harry doesn't give his friends any Christmas presents.

436
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,300
And this is one paragraph after the Dursleys give Harry a toothpick for Christmas

437
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:15,300
in what is supposed to be a display of Scrooge-like miserliness,

438
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,300
but Harry doesn't even manage a toothpick for his friends.

439
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,300
He even gets a hand-knitted sweater from Molly Weasley,

440
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:25,300
which, again, makes him feel guilty because he stole her car,

441
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,300
but not guilty enough to actually do anything, though.

442
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,300
Of course, the plot reason Harry can't get Ron a new wand

443
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:35,300
is that Rowling wants Gilderoy Lockhart to later use the broken wand

444
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,300
in an attempt to wipe the memories of Ron and Harry,

445
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:41,300
only to have his spell bounce back at him and wipe his memory instead.

446
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:45,300
But all this requires is to get the broken wand into Lockhart's hands somehow.

447
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:50,300
You could write it so that Ron had a new wand and his old broken one,

448
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,300
then he's somehow forced by Lockhart to hand over his wand,

449
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,300
and so Ron intentionally hands the broken one over.

450
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,300
Now, I think that would be better.

451
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:02,300
It would give Ron something active to do with the conclusion of the story,

452
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:06,300
and it would make defeating Lockhart something at least partially intentional.

453
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:10,300
Oh, no. Look, I'm writing Harry Potter fanfiction.

454
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:14,300
While I'm writing fanfiction, though, I'll say that if J.K. Rowling had asked me for notes

455
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,300
on the end of The Chamber of Secrets,

456
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,300
I would have told her to have Harry find something valuable in The Chamber of Secrets.

457
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:24,300
Salazar Slytherin's lost gems or something,

458
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:28,300
and then force that on the Weasleys at the end of the story.

459
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,300
Now, they would refuse, of course,

460
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,300
but he could tell them it was repayment for the car he stole.

461
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:37,300
That would be a cap to everything in the novel about the Weasleys' poverty.

462
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,300
It would assuage Harry's guilt over costing them money.

463
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:45,300
And also, the beginning of the next novel features Ron's family going on holiday in Egypt,

464
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,300
which is later an important plot point.

465
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:51,300
Now, how can Rowling send the Weasleys on holiday when they're so poor?

466
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:57,300
Well, they just win a lottery between the books, which feels a bit random and convenient.

467
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:01,300
You know, wouldn't it be nicer to see the Weasleys on holiday at the beginning of the next book

468
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:06,300
because the poverty theme was adequately concluded in the preceding book?

469
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,300
Yes, probably.

470
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,300
Anyway, Ron's broken wand isn't the only example in The Chamber of Secrets

471
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:18,300
of dramatic tension only existing because Harry's too much of a tight git to spend any money on anyone.

472
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:23,300
In that novel, Draco Malfoy's father, Lucius, outfits the Slytherin Quidditch team

473
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:29,300
with a set of fancy new brooms, Nimbus 2001s, that are much better than the brooms used by the Gryffindor team

474
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,300
and especially better than the older brooms used by Fred and George Weasley.

475
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:38,300
And Draco taunts the Gryffindors about not being able to afford better brooms.

476
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:42,300
So the Gryffindor team are set up as the poor underdogs to the rich Slytherin team

477
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,300
who can afford the best equipment.

478
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:50,300
And a despondent Harry is later seen wishing he could somehow get seven free Nimbus 2001s

479
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,300
for their match against Slytherin.

480
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,300
You know, if only the Gryffindor team also had a rich benefactor

481
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,300
with a huge pile of gold and a desire to get them some new brooms.

482
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,300
Alas.

483
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,300
Now, reading this, I was thinking, obviously,

484
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:10,300
Harry, mate, you're rich. Why do you want free brooms?

485
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,300
Just buy some brooms.

486
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,300
Harry didn't even buy his own broom.

487
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:18,300
That was gifted to him by Professor McGonagall, the head of Gryffindor House.

488
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,300
And that's a point, actually.

489
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,300
When Lucius buys new brooms for the Slytherins,

490
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:26,300
or Snape is seen helping the Slytherin team out by letting them train

491
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,300
when the Gryffindors had the field booked or whatever,

492
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,300
it's presented as a sneaky, unfair thing to do.

493
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:36,300
But when McGonagall tips the scales in the favour of Hare House's Quidditch team

494
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:40,300
by anonymously buying their seeker a professional racing broom,

495
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,300
it's like, oh, what a lovely gift.

496
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:46,300
Because, remember, there are no good or bad actions in Harry Potter.

497
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,300
There are only good and bad teams.

498
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:54,300
And you can tell the bad team because they're ugly and fat and covered in snakes.

499
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,300
Now, the payoff to Harry being such a cheap bastard in Chamber of Secrets

500
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,300
comes two books later in Goblet of Fire,

501
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,300
where Harry gives Fred and George Weasley a big pile of gold

502
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,300
so they can start their joke show.

503
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,300
So, there we go, a couple of books late,

504
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,300
but Harry has finally found a way to give the Weasleys some of his vast fortune.

505
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,300
He got there in the end.

506
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,300
Except, not really.

507
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,300
You see, the money that Harry gives to Fred and George Weasley

508
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,300
is his winnings from the Triwizard Tournament,

509
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,300
and that wasn't really his money, was it?

510
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:27,300
The tournament was rigged in Harry's favour by one of Voldemort's followers.

511
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,300
Harry never would have won it by himself.

512
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,300
Now, it's still fine for Harry to give the money to Fred and George,

513
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,300
but this isn't really him being generous,

514
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,300
because keeping the money at all would be wrong here.

515
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:42,300
And this reminds me of when we see Harry giving Ginny a set of Gilderoy Lockhart's books,

516
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:47,300
except those were gifted to Harry by Lockhart as part of a self-serving promotional stunt,

517
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,300
so they didn't cost him anything either.

518
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:53,300
When it comes to Harry's money, Rowling wants it two ways.

519
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,300
She wants the wish-fulfillment Cinderella fantasy

520
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,300
of the main character being whisked away from poverty

521
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,300
to a world in which they're rich and famous and important,

522
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:06,300
and she also wants to have dramatic story elements centred around poverty,

523
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,300
story elements that could be easily solved by Harry's wealth.

524
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,300
And the result of trying to have it both ways here

525
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:15,300
is to just make Harry Potter look like kind of a selfish jerk.

526
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:20,300
Now, I confess I might be off in assigning these disappointing two-bucks-late payoffs

527
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,300
to Rowling's adversarial relationship with feedback,

528
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,300
but that's just how it reads to me.

529
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,300
You know, you brats keep asking about the Time-Turners.

530
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,300
Well, there you go, they've all been destroyed.

531
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:34,300
You brats keep asking why Harry doesn't give the Weasleys gold.

532
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,300
Well, there you go, he gave Fred and George a bag of gold.

533
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,300
Now leave me alone.

534
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,300
But the worst instance of this,

535
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:44,300
the point where it seems like Rowling is most obviously going on the offensive against her own audience,

536
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:48,300
is on the issue of slavery, which is what we're going to talk about next.

537
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:53,300
Now, if you read the Harry Potter books as a child and haven't returned to them as an adult,

538
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,300
or if you've only seen the movies and have never read the books,

539
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:02,300
be prepared for an experience, because the slavery stuff in the Harry Potter books gets really weird.

540
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:06,300
So Rowling introduces slavery in the second book, The Chamber of Secrets.

541
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:12,300
We're introduced early on to Dobby, a house elf, who is a slave owned by Draco Malfoy's family.

542
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,300
He's treated very poorly, and if he disobeys the orders of his master,

543
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,300
he's forced to physically abuse himself as punishment.

544
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:24,300
Harry is shocked by all this and responds by sympathizing with Dobby,

545
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,300
using his experience of being treated poorly by the Dursleys.

546
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:32,300
He wonders why Dobby doesn't escape. He offers to do something to help.

547
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:38,300
This is all a normal reaction to suddenly finding out that slavery exists in the Wizarding World.

548
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:43,300
Now, the end of the novel sees Harry trick Lucius Malfoy into releasing Dobby,

549
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,300
and key here is that Dobby is happy to be released.

550
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,300
It was set up that Dobby does not like being enslaved,

551
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:53,300
and then at the end of the novel, the payoff is that Harry frees him.

552
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,300
See, Rowling can do the setup and payoff sometimes.

553
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,300
And that's all fine for a single story.

554
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:05,300
Only, like the Time-Turners, Rowling has now introduced a rather large element into her world

555
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:10,300
that you would expect to feature going forward, that being racial slavery.

556
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:16,300
But in the next novel, The Prisoner of Azkaban, apart from one passing reference to Dobby made by Malfoy,

557
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,300
slavery is completely absent from the story.

558
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:24,300
And this might lead an audience to wonder, what's the deal with all the slaves?

559
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,300
You know, Harry freed Dobby.

560
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,300
But Dobby isn't the only slave in the world, is he?

561
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,300
So what's going on there?

562
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:36,300
Can we get a follow-up, please, JK, to the fact that the wizards keep slaves?

563
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:41,300
And what Rowling decided to do here was, to put it lightly, ill-advised.

564
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:45,300
So in The Goblet of Fire, two books after The Chamber of Secrets,

565
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,300
she introduces the positive aspects of slavery.

566
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:55,300
You see, the house elves actually like being enslaved, and it would be bad, even cruel, to free them.

567
00:39:55,300 --> 00:40:01,300
We're introduced early on to Winky, another house elf slave who is, again, treated very poorly,

568
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,300
but she doesn't want to be freed.

569
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:09,300
And when she is freed, as a punishment, she falls into a state of depressed, listless alcoholism.

570
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:14,300
And that's it, that's the conclusion to Winky's story.

571
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:18,300
She was a slave, she was freed, she becomes a depressed addict.

572
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:23,300
And having shown us the evils of ending slavery,

573
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:30,300
Rowling then takes aim at those who would seek to force this horrible state of freedom upon the slaves.

574
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:35,300
You see, Hermione gets a bee in her bonnet about the existence of slavery in the wizard world,

575
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:40,300
and she's particularly irked by the fact that Hogwarts runs on slave labor.

576
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:45,300
The cooking and housekeeping is carried out by a whole bunch of unseen house elf slaves.

577
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:50,300
Hermione creates an organization to campaign for the freedom of the slaves,

578
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:57,300
which is given a silly name, Spew, and for the trouble she's roundly mocked by basically everyone, including her friends.

579
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:05,300
Hermione trying to free the slaves in a very haughty way, she's very haughty about slavery, is played for laughs.

580
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:09,300
It's an ongoing element of supposed comic relief.

581
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:16,300
And what comes to mind first here is that tweet from Rowling where she tries to bullshit that Hermione was never canonically white,

582
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,300
and says Rowling loves black Hermione.

583
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:23,300
Can you imagine if Hermione was black for this whole subplot?

584
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:30,300
You know, haughtily arguing for the end of slavery and being made fun of by her closest friends for it.

585
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:34,300
Winky and Spew were cut from the movies, unsurprisingly.

586
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:41,300
It is rather weird for the comic relief in your children's story to be someone attempts to end the slave trade.

587
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:51,300
Now, being charitable, we can say that this whole bit with Hermione and the slaves is supposed to be a criticism of a particular type of overzealous activism,

588
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:56,300
where someone inserts themselves into a political situation unnecessarily,

589
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:02,300
and tries to organize action that is actually counter to the wishes of the people they're trying to help, right?

590
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:07,300
Rowling's taking aim at only a particular type of activist, we can say.

591
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,300
But there are many, many problems with this.

592
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:15,300
Firstly is that if this is a criticism of political activism done wrongly,

593
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:21,300
there are no examples of what Rowling considers political activism done correctly in the Harry Potter novels.

594
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:28,300
So Spew reads as a criticism of all political activism, not merely one particular type of activism.

595
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:36,300
Next, this is all built on top of the audience's singular previous encounter with slavery prior to the fourth book, which is Dobby.

596
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:41,300
Now Dobby didn't like being enslaved, and he was happy to be freed,

597
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:47,300
which becomes confusing once Rowling tries to backpedal and say, actually, the elves like slavery,

598
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:51,300
because Dobby's an elf, and he doesn't like slavery.

599
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,300
And she deals with this by saying that Dobby's just weird.

600
00:42:55,300 --> 00:43:00,300
And I want to talk about the scene in which we find out that Dobby is weird for not wanting to be a slave,

601
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:05,300
because it really highlights just how poorly thought out this whole slavery bit is.

602
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:11,300
So Hermione asks Hagrid to join her elf activism group, to which Hagrid responds,

603
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:28,300
But Harry set Dobby free and he was over the moon about it, said Hermione,

604
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,300
and we hear he's asking for wages now.

605
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:34,300
Yeah, well, you get weirdos in every breed.

606
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:40,300
I'm not saying there isn't the odd elf who'd take freedom, but you'll never persuade most of them to do it.

607
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:43,300
So this is probably my favorite retcon ever.

608
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:48,300
What, you thought Dobby was happy to be freed because slavery's bad?

609
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,300
Well, guess what, nerd?

610
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:54,300
Actually, slavery rules, and Dobby's just weird for not liking it.

611
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:59,300
And on the one hand, this is funny, but on the other, it's rather frustrating, right?

612
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:05,300
This scene is set in Hagrid's hut, and Hagrid, Ron, Harry, and Hermione are present.

613
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:13,300
And all of these characters should know what it's like to be discriminated against based on what are assumed to be innate characteristics.

614
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:19,300
Hagrid is half-giant and has been persecuted because he's assumed to therefore be violent and dangerous.

615
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:23,300
Hermione is muggle-born and is subjected to racial abuse because of that.

616
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:29,300
Ron's family is pureblood but is looked down upon for associating with muggle-borns like Hermione.

617
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:34,300
And Harry not only has his whole chosen one special destiny thing going on,

618
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:39,300
he has a history of being abused by the Dursleys on account of being born a wizard, right?

619
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:47,300
All of the characters should have a point of reference for questioning the logic that the house elves want to be slaves because it's just in their nature.

620
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:51,300
But with the exception of Hermione, they aren't questioning it.

621
00:44:51,300 --> 00:45:02,300
Actually, even when it comes to Hermione, there is nothing in the text that directly states she is so invested in campaigning for the elves because of her own experience of suffering racial discrimination.

622
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:07,300
I doubt Rowling would have intended or even noticed that possibility.

623
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:13,300
Hermione is supposed to be functioning here solely as a haughty busybody who is the punchline of a joke.

624
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:21,300
So, as Rowling writes it, we're to understand that it's wrong, for instance, for people to assume Hagrid is violent because he is a giant,

625
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:25,300
because it's wrong to judge him on the basis of his race rather than his actions.

626
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:34,300
But it's okay to assume the house elves, on the basis of their race, want to be slaves, even though some of them demonstrably do not want to be.

627
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:41,300
It's in their nature to look after humans, and if they say otherwise, they're just being weird.

628
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,300
So, time for an obvious statement here.

629
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:51,300
This assumption that the elves should be naturally subservient because of their race is racist, right?

630
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,300
I mean, that's what racism is, isn't it?

631
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:58,300
So, are the characters who make that argument just racists?

632
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:02,300
Now, the Harry Potter series has something of a limited understanding of racism,

633
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:10,300
and I don't mean intentionally limited in that it's a series aimed at children and teens and therefore isn't going to be that complicated.

634
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:14,300
No, I mean limited in that the author just doesn't really understand racism.

635
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:18,300
Now, don't get me wrong, Rowling understands that racism is bad,

636
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:22,300
and she often makes her characters who are the bad guys be racists,

637
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:27,300
but where she trips up is when she tries to understand and counter that racism.

638
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:32,300
And to show you what I mean, let's talk through a couple of instances of racism in the books.

639
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:38,300
So, Harry's first encounter with racism in the wizard world is when he meets Malfoy in Diagon Alley in Book 1,

640
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:43,300
and Malfoy states that he thinks Hogwarts shouldn't admit witches and wizards from muggle families.

641
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:47,300
An upset Harry tells Hagrid about this later, and Hagrid says,

642
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:58,300
Hagrid is saying, basically, don't worry, that racist wasn't talking about you.

643
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:04,300
Now, that's not too great of a reply, obviously, but Hagrid has another up his sleeve, he says.

644
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:14,300
Look at your mum. Look at what she had for a sister.

645
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:19,300
And a similar scene takes place in Book 2, after Hermione is called a Mudblood by Malfoy.

646
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,300
Ron, explaining what Mudblood means, says,

647
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:28,300
There are some wizards, like Malfoy's family, who think they're better than everyone else because they're what people call pure blood.

648
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:31,300
The rest of us know it doesn't make any difference at all.

649
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:36,300
Look at Neville Longbottom. He's pure blood and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way up.

650
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,300
And then Hagrid chimes in, saying,

651
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,300
This is Rowling's counterargument to the racism in her books.

652
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:51,300
Racists are technically incorrect on the facts, which is weak by itself.

653
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:58,300
You see, when racists say they're better than other people, they don't actually mean more skilled.

654
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:03,300
They mean fundamentally better. They are worth more, as people, by default.

655
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:12,300
To a wizard world racist, Neville Longbottom is worth more than a thousand Hermione's because he is pure blood, so he is better.

656
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:21,300
Whatever reasons racists give for their racism are not the actual reasons at all. They're the excuses for their racism.

657
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:26,300
Racism, as presented by the Harry Potter series, is a conscious decision people make.

658
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:31,300
A character will choose to be racist because they believe in some flawed idea.

659
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:34,300
They have an incorrect belief about the world.

660
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:43,300
Racists say muggle-borns are worse at magic, but look, Hermione is really good at magic, and Neville is rubbish. Therefore, racism is wrong.

661
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:50,300
Now, this is a poor counterargument because it accepts the logic of the racists. It just disagrees with their conclusion.

662
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:57,300
And what does this say to Hermione, exactly? You know, if you were bad at magic, Malfoy would be right to be racist about you.

663
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,300
It's a good job you do your homework, Hermione.

664
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:10,300
And in fact, when the good characters do agree with the logic of the racism, i.e. house elves are naturally subservient and slavery is the best thing for them,

665
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:14,300
then it's not considered to be racism at all. It's just common sense.

666
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:23,300
In J.K. Rowling's writing, the real bigotry is not, for example, believing in a hierarchical worldview with a natural slave race.

667
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:30,300
Bigotry is more just being rudely incorrect. Racism is first and foremost a bad attitude.

668
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:40,300
And I'd argue that this view of racism, in which it's a thing consciously engaged in with intentional rudeness, is why Rowling is ignorant of her own racism.

669
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:46,300
Now, J.K. Rowling gets to racism not by conscious, rude hatred, but by way of arrogant laziness.

670
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:56,300
She writes about groups of people that she doesn't know anything about, she doesn't do any research or talk to anyone who knows more than her, and so she gets herself into trouble.

671
00:49:56,300 --> 00:50:03,300
For instance, a few years ago, Rowling came under fire for writing an article about Navajo skinwalkers on the website Pottermore,

672
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:14,300
which was a site owned by J.K. Rowling that published supplementary material and news related to the Harry Potter universe, before being rebranded to WizardingWorld.com in 2019.

673
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:26,300
Anyway, in this article, Rowling states that the legend of the skinwalker was made up by Native American medicine men in order to demonize real wizards, and this is something that she repeated on Twitter.

674
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:35,300
And Rowling was widely criticized for appropriating a real people's cultural and spiritual traditions to use as props in her wizard stories.

675
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:43,300
And the way she uses them is basically to say that their historical beliefs were made up by people who were jealous of her real wizards.

676
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:50,300
Rowling's laziness really takes center stage in the series of articles introducing the other schools of the Wizarding World.

677
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:54,300
For instance, the Japanese school is called Mahutakoro.

678
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:59,300
Now that might not sound right to you, but that is the pronunciation guide given on the website.

679
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:10,300
So this name is what you would get if you used Google to translate the Japanese word for magic and the Japanese word for place, and then combined them with no regard for grammar and then pronounced it wrong.

680
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,300
This article starts out,

681
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:28,300
About twice as many people live in Japan than in the UK, which also has its own wizard school, so why does their school have fewer students?

682
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:34,300
Are Japanese people just genetically less magic than British people in Rowling's world?

683
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:46,300
The South American wizard school is in Brazil and its name is what you would get if you used Google to translate the Portuguese word for castle and the Portuguese word for wizard and then combined them with no regard for grammar.

684
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:55,300
The resulting word, castle wizard, sounds less like it's describing a castle for wizards and more as though the castle itself is a wizard.

685
00:51:55,300 --> 00:52:02,300
It's also named in Portuguese despite the school predating the Portuguese colonization of the Americas, so what happened there?

686
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:11,300
All this might seem nitpicky, but these are the sorts of questions you need to think about if you want to write about other people's cultures and histories.

687
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:16,300
Rowling gets herself into trouble here because she just lazily makes it up as she goes along.

688
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:29,300
Case in point from the Harry Potter series, the Scottish-Chinese character Cho Chang, whose name is made up of two Asian surnames, which depending on how you translate them are possibly from different countries even.

689
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:34,300
It'd be like calling a European character Lopez Schneider or something.

690
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:43,300
Now there's been a lot of criticism of Cho Chang and a lot of wondering about how Rowling came up with the name exactly, but I know. I can solve that mystery today.

691
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:53,300
You see, Rowling often names things in her books using word association, so she comes up with some words associated with the thing she's trying to name and then constructs a name out of those.

692
00:52:53,300 --> 00:53:02,300
So what do I call this grim old place? Grim old place. Where do the goblins keep the ingots in gringots?

693
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:10,300
Where do the Dursleys live? Well, they're very private and Dudley is always whinging, so they live in Privet Drive. Little whinging, right?

694
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:15,300
She also names some of her characters this way. So what do I call the werewolf?

695
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:28,300
Well, Remus raised by wolves, Lupin from the Latin for wolf, right? This character is always taking umbrage with things, so I'll just call her Umbrage. That one was easy.

696
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:42,300
But now here's where it gets awkward. What do I call the black guy? Well, what comes to mind when I think of a black guy? Martin Luther King, a slave in shackles, right? Kingsley Shacklebolt.

697
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:48,300
Now what do I call the Asian character? What comes to mind when I think of an Asian person?

698
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:59,300
And now, I don't even want to say what I would bet JK Rowling thought of here, but she thought a two-word phrase and then just changed it a little bit to get to Cho Chang.

699
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:07,300
That's how she came up with that name. She used Lazy Racist Word Association. Probably. I mean, I can't prove it.

700
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:16,300
To Rowling though, because none of this is consciously aggressive, because it isn't intentionally racist, it doesn't really count.

701
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:25,300
And so it goes in the novels with those who support the slavery of the house elves. Hagrid, for instance, can argue in favour of slavery perfectly politely.

702
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:32,300
On the other hand, it's Hermione who is presented as obnoxious and rude. She is the one with the bad attitude.

703
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:41,300
Now, in all of the scenes discussing the slavery of the house elves, readers might note the lack of opinions held by our own point-of-view character, Harry Potter.

704
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:48,300
The Harry Potter novels are written from a limited third-person perspective that is closely tied to a single point-of-view character,

705
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:53,300
which is usually Harry Potter, although there are a few chapters written from the point of view of other characters.

706
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:59,300
What this means is that the narration and therefore the reader has access to Harry's inner thoughts and feelings.

707
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:07,300
If Harry is embarrassed, we can just be told he was feeling embarrassed, but if Ron is embarrassed, the narration has to say something like

708
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:15,300
Ron looked embarrassed, because the narration doesn't have direct access to the other characters' thoughts and feelings like it does for Harry.

709
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:22,300
I mention this here to highlight how, after his initial surprised outburst about Dobby's slavery in the Chamber of Secrets,

710
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:25,300
Harry Potter doesn't really have any opinions about slavery.

711
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:31,300
In the slavery debates in the books, Harry is mostly just a passive, thoughtless observer.

712
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:37,300
Hermione obviously opposes slavery very strongly, and Ron finds this laughable and mocks her for it,

713
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:41,300
and claims that slavery is acceptable because the elves like it.

714
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:48,300
But Harry, our point-of-view character, just sits there silently, not thinking anything for the most part.

715
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:53,300
When he does voice an opinion, it's only to wonder when Hermione is gonna give up on the activism thing.

716
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:59,300
He doesn't appear to have any strong opinions other than Hermione should stop talking about it.

717
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:07,300
Even when Harry finds out that Professor Slughorn has been using a Hogwarts house elf to test his drinks for deadly poison

718
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:10,300
– this is after one of his drinks was actually poisoned, by the way –

719
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:15,300
Harry's only thought is how outraged Hermione would be if she heard about that.

720
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:22,300
When our hero, Harry Potter, hears that his teacher is testing what is potentially fatal poison,

721
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:31,300
on slaves, he just thinks, wow, it's a good job Hermione isn't here, because she'd probably be really annoying about this.

722
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:38,300
Now, the other major house elf character in the books is Creature, who Harry inherits after the death of Sirius Black,

723
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:42,300
so our main character becomes a slave owner. That's nice.

724
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:49,300
Creature is depicted as miserable and insulting. He's horrible to everyone, and everyone is horrible to him in return.

725
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:56,300
Harry also inherits Sirius' house, Twelve Grimmauld Place, which is decorated with decapitated slave heads.

726
00:56:56,300 --> 00:57:02,300
And in the novel where this house first appears, The Order of the Phoenix, at Christmas time our main characters

727
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:10,300
decorate the house for Christmas, which involves putting Little Father Christmas hats and beards on the slave heads.

728
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:17,300
So our heroes decide to decorate their decapitated slave heads with little Christmas hats.

729
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:26,300
Now, I'm gonna need to hit pause here next to the Christmas slave heads and ask, what is happening right now?

730
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:32,300
Why are the Harry Potter books like this? And we're gonna have to go on a few tangents here, but stick with me.

731
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:38,300
So, say you're an author and you want to put slavery as a theme into your children's fantasy series.

732
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:42,300
Now, how do we do that? Well, there's a few ways to go about it.

733
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:46,300
The first is to just make the only slave owners bad people, right?

734
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:52,300
So only the bad characters like the Malfoy's own slaves, and all the good characters oppose it.

735
00:57:52,300 --> 00:58:00,300
Maybe there's a political effort to free the slaves, but the old racist pureblood families keep using their wealth and power to block it, right?

736
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:08,300
So you've got a very clear good-bad dividing line on the issue of slavery. That's the simplistic, straightforward way to do it.

737
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:14,300
The more complicated way to do it is have slavery be a systemic issue inherent to the whole wizarding society.

738
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:18,300
And at first glance, it seems that this is what Rowling is going for.

739
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:23,300
Characters who are otherwise presented as good people defend slavery.

740
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:34,300
Hagrid argues it's in their nature, Ron says they like being slaves, Molly wishes she had a slave to do the laundry even though she can do housework by magic, and so on.

741
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:40,300
And this systemic problem is even explicitly tied to the rise of the main antagonist of the series.

742
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:47,300
Now, you might expect the main character of this story to be an outsider, freshly introduced into the wizarding world,

743
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:53,300
who can see through the inequalities that they take for granted, who can introduce a new perspective.

744
00:58:53,300 --> 00:59:00,300
But Harry is not given that role. It's given instead to Hermione, and only to mock how silly it is.

745
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:10,300
Now, the real issue comes at the end of this story, because if you want to have a happy ending where your characters triumph, where evil is conquered, where all is well,

746
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:19,300
then the systemic problem of slavery requires a systemic resolution, i.e. the slaves have to be freed, or all is not well, is it?

747
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:25,300
But what we need to understand here is that J.K. Rowling can't free the slaves in her story.

748
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:33,300
This is the reason she has to backpedal slavery into not being that bad, because after she introduces it, she can't fundamentally change it,

749
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:37,300
and she can't do that because of her real-world political beliefs.

750
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:41,300
And to understand those, we need to talk about neoliberalism.

751
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:48,300
Now, whenever the politics of Harry Potter are brought up online, someone will post this screencap from an image board,

752
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:55,300
where the author of the post lays what they see as the failings of the Harry Potter story at the feet of J.K. Rowling being, quote,

753
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:59,300
a liberal, centrist Blairite who doesn't really believe in anything.

754
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:02,300
But is this accurate, and what does it mean exactly?

755
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:10,300
So, very quick, in 1979, Margaret Thatcher came to power in the UK. Yes, sorry we're doing this.

756
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:17,300
Her government was in power throughout the 80s and enforced and oversaw a national political realignment.

757
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:23,300
Previously, in the period after World War II, the UK instituted various welfare reforms paid for by high taxes,

758
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:28,300
a national healthcare service was established, there was wide support for trade unions,

759
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:33,300
and various industries and services were nationalized, that is, brought into public ownership.

760
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:38,300
Now, Thatcher's government can be characterized as a total shift away from all of this.

761
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:43,300
Unions were broken up, national industries and services were privatized and sold off,

762
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:48,300
there were tax cuts for the rich, and there was a whole bunch of financial deregulation.

763
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:56,300
This was a philosophy of smaller government, of diminishing collective action, and a greater emphasis on individual responsibility.

764
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,300
Thatcher even once stated, quote,

765
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:04,300
There is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women, and there are families.

766
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:07,300
Which, of course, doesn't make any sense.

767
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:12,300
Now, after Thatcher came to power, there were 18 years of conservative rule in the UK,

768
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:17,300
and this led to Tony Blair rebranding the Labour Party to New Labour,

769
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:21,300
and shifting the party to the right to appeal to conservative voters.

770
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:27,300
So Blair abandoned Labour's previous support for renationalization and embraced the free market.

771
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:35,300
He moved away from seeking an equality of outcome and towards a supposedly meritocratic equality of opportunity.

772
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:38,300
Everyone should have the opportunity to succeed.

773
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,300
He basically said to the Conservatives,

774
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:45,300
We are not going to fight you on how the economy should fundamentally be organized.

775
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:50,300
You win. We give up. We now have the same aims in that regard.

776
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:54,300
We're no longer going to be seeking any serious structural change.

777
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:57,300
We're going to keep things organized as they are.

778
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:01,300
We're just going to argue that we can run things more competently than you can.

779
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:08,300
Thatcher is said to have later claimed that the rebranding of Labour to New Labour was her greatest political accomplishment.

780
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:13,300
Now, I don't know if she actually said that, but if she did, she was right.

781
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:16,300
Now, if you're from the US and want to understand all this,

782
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:21,300
you can swap Thatcher out for Reagan and Blair for Bill Clinton, and you'll have a rough outline.

783
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:28,300
So, anyway, this support for free market capitalism and associated policies of deregulation, privatization,

784
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:34,300
the reduction of government welfare spending, and a greater focus on individualism is known as neoliberalism.

785
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:39,300
Neo meaning new, because it was a resurgence of economic liberalism.

786
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:41,300
So what does all this have to do with JK Rowling?

787
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:46,300
Well, JK Rowling is an enormous fan of Tony Blair and New Labour.

788
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:50,300
She is actually personal friends with Blair's successor, Gordon Brown,

789
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:56,300
who, before becoming Prime Minister himself, served as Blair's Chancellor of the Exchequer for a decade.

790
01:02:56,300 --> 01:03:00,300
For non-UK folks, the Chancellor is basically our Chief Finance Minister.

791
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:04,300
Rowling was present for the birth of Gordon Brown's son,

792
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:07,300
and she donated very large amounts of money to his government,

793
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:11,300
and has subsequently sung its praises on her social media accounts.

794
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:17,300
She has also been harshly critical of those within Labour who would seek to move the party back to the left.

795
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:22,300
JK Rowling's political philosophy is that of New Labour's neoliberalism,

796
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:28,300
with its focus on individual instead of collective action, its promise of no serious systemic change,

797
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:32,300
its push for equality of opportunity over equality of outcome,

798
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:38,300
and, most importantly, for a billionaire, its pledge not to raise taxes.

799
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:41,300
Now, with this worldview in mind, back to Harry Potter.

800
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:46,300
So, in the Harry Potter series, while individual actions can be good or bad,

801
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:51,300
systemic actions that threaten the status quo are always wrong.

802
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:54,300
Systemic change is always wrong.

803
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:58,300
This is why it can be seen as good for Harry to free one slave,

804
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:01,300
but bad for Hermione to want to free all the slaves,

805
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:05,300
because one is an individual change and one is a systemic change.

806
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:11,300
From the time Harry enters Hogwarts to the epilogue two decades after he leaves,

807
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:17,300
there are no examples in any of the Harry Potter novels of a positive systemic change.

808
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:21,300
Above an individual level, nothing changes for the better.

809
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:29,300
Flawed systems are portrayed, but the answer to those flaws is always to replace the individual assumed to be responsible for them.

810
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:32,300
The system itself is above being questioned.

811
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:36,300
Now, this attitude can be seen in Harry's interactions with the ministers of magic,

812
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:40,300
first Cornelius Fudge, and later Rufus Scrimjaw.

813
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:44,300
Scrimjaw? I have no idea if I'm saying that right.

814
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:50,300
Fudge is portrayed as an incompetent coward, someone too terrified of Voldemort to take any action,

815
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:58,300
whereas Scrimjaw is the opposite, so keen to be seen to be taking action that he abuses his authority to arrest and imprison the wrong people.

816
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:04,300
The authority of the ministry is carried out by their Aurors, who are basically the wizard police force.

817
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:08,300
And it's interesting to note what Harry sees this authority used to do.

818
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:13,300
Aside from the more general racial discrimination enforced by the ministry,

819
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:19,300
Harry sees them falsely imprison his godfather in their torture prison, Azkaban, then later hunt him.

820
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:25,300
They falsely imprison his friend Hagrid. They attack Dumbledore in his office in an attempt to arrest him.

821
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:32,300
And Harry later sees the whole apparatus of the ministry fall under Voldemort's control and be used to carry out his bidding.

822
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:39,300
But throughout all this, Harry never, at any point, questions the ministry's right to rule.

823
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:44,300
He never questions whether or not they should have the authority to do what they're doing.

824
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:47,300
He only ever questions their competency.

825
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:54,300
Even after everything he witnesses the ministry do, Harry's main ambition in life remains to become an Auror.

826
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:58,300
He wants to be a cop working for this government.

827
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:03,300
This is the result of an automatic, unthinking respect given to the status quo.

828
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:12,300
The political and social systems that currently exist are treated as fundamental forces that are inherent to the world, like gravity.

829
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:18,300
They can persecute you and your friends, they can even try to kill you, but they must never be questioned.

830
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:25,300
For a very clear example of this in Rowling's writing, let's briefly talk about the first Fantastic Beasts movie.

831
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:28,300
So these movies are a complete tonal mess.

832
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:32,300
They're trying to appeal to the little kids with the Fantastic Beasts angle.

833
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:34,300
You know, all the magical animals escaped.

834
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:39,300
Can Newt the zookeeper track them down and get them back into his magical suitcase?

835
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:43,300
You know, that's a nice low-stakes kids story, right?

836
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:46,300
But they're also trying to appeal to the older Harry Potter fans.

837
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:52,300
So the movies are also awkwardly about the conflict between Dumbledore and Grindelwald.

838
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:57,300
So as well as Newt Scamander trying to catch his mischievous escaped Niffler,

839
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:01,300
we also get to see a fascist execute an actual baby.

840
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:04,300
It's just all over the place with the tone.

841
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:11,300
Anyway, midway through the first movie, which, keep in mind, is supposed to be about a magical zookeeper,

842
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:17,300
we're treated to a horrific execution scene as Newt and his friend, the ex-aura Tina,

843
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:20,300
are sentenced to death by the American Ministry of Magic.

844
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:23,300
So there's suddenly much higher stakes than you'd expect.

845
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:26,300
So they're taken to a place called a death cell.

846
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:35,300
They've got a death cell to be summarily executed by being submerged into a death potion, which also exists.

847
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:38,300
And Newt and Tina have to stage an escape.

848
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:41,300
Now notable here is that Tina works with these people.

849
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:47,300
She's on first-name terms with the executioner, even, and they just take her off to be killed.

850
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:53,300
Anyway, at the end of the film, after Newt and Tina are back on good terms with the American Ministry,

851
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:59,300
Tina thanks Newt for putting in a good word for her and getting her her job back.

852
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:04,300
And you might be wondering, she still wants to work at the Ministry?

853
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:12,300
They just, like, just right now, tried to actually execute her, and she has nothing to say about that.

854
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:18,300
You know, should the wizards have a death cell? Should they be able to execute people without a trial?

855
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:22,300
Doesn't really matter, I guess. Water under the bridge now, eh?

856
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:27,300
The Harry Potter stories are sometimes mischaracterized as anti-authority,

857
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:34,300
even by Rowling herself, who has stated that she wants readers to take away the message that they should question authority.

858
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:41,300
She even has Harry laugh at Vernon for wondering why the Ministry of Magic can't protect them from Voldemort.

859
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:45,300
It was so very typical of his uncle to put his hopes in the establishment.

860
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:50,300
You see, Harry's laughing at Vernon here for not questioning the competency of authority.

861
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:56,300
But what Harry and Rowling do not realize is that Harry is not much different from his uncle here.

862
01:08:56,300 --> 01:09:02,300
Because while Harry will question the competency of authority, he never questions its legitimacy.

863
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:09,300
He and the series as a whole are not anti-authority. They are anti the wrong people having authority.

864
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:19,300
One fun scene here is in the Half-Blood Prince, when a frustrated Harry wishes he had the power of the Minister of Magic to have his secret police follow Malfoy around.

865
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:22,300
And then Harry remembers that he does actually have that power.

866
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:28,300
He has the power of slavery, and then he orders Kreacher to follow Malfoy.

867
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:33,300
Now, written by anyone else, this might be a funny commentary on how police serve those in power,

868
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:40,300
but no, this is just our main character who wishes he was a cop ordering his slave around.

869
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:43,300
No, Harry Potter is not anti-authority.

870
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:50,300
Even when Harry breaks the rules, like when he sets up a secret organization for learning defense against the Dark Arts,

871
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:56,300
it's in service to the ultimate authority in the wizarding world, the status quo.

872
01:09:56,300 --> 01:10:05,300
Harry sets up this club while Hogwarts is under the rule of Dolores Umbridge, who insists practical defense against the Dark Arts is unnecessary.

873
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:10,300
Umbridge is presented as a strict authoritarian who ruthlessly punishes rule breakers,

874
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:15,300
but of course the stealth real problem with Umbridge is that she represents change.

875
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:21,300
Her real evil is that she is changing Hogwarts from how it was when Harry first encountered it,

876
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:27,300
and so Harry and his pals have to break the rules in order to do what they were supposed to be doing anyway,

877
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:30,300
studying practical defense against the Dark Arts.

878
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:35,300
Harry and his friends oppose the authority of Umbridge, not because they are anti-authority,

879
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:37,300
but because they are anti-Umbridge.

880
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:44,300
And of course the solution to Umbridge's abuse of authority is simply to replace her with a good authoritarian,

881
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:50,300
swapping a bad individual for a good individual, but leaving the system unchanged.

882
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:55,300
This is the problem injected into the Harry Potter series by Rowling's political philosophy.

883
01:10:55,300 --> 01:11:03,300
While she can portray societal problems, she cannot even conceive of societal solutions to those problems.

884
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:09,300
The problems might be systemic, but the solutions must always be individual.

885
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:14,300
Allow me to go on another tangent within this tangent and talk about The Casual Vacancy.

886
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:20,300
So The Casual Vacancy is the first novel written by Rowling after the publication of the Harry Potter novels,

887
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:23,300
and is very useful for us here for a couple of reasons.

888
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:30,300
Firstly, it's an explicitly political novel set in the real world. It is centered around local council politics.

889
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:35,300
Secondly, it is explicitly a novel for adults. It contains depictions of domestic violence,

890
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:40,300
sexual assault, child abuse and neglect, suicide, self-harm, and so on.

891
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:46,300
So if your response to any of my criticisms of Rowling's writing in Harry Potter is that Harry Potter is for children,

892
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:51,300
well, that doesn't apply to The Casual Vacancy, which is very much not meant for kids.

893
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:58,300
The Casual Vacancy is set in Pagford, a fictional, stereotypical, picturesque English village.

894
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:04,300
And the political plot of the novel is concerned with the border between Pagford and a nearby larger city.

895
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:08,300
There is currently a council estate full of poor people on Pagford's side of the border,

896
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:14,300
and there's a plot in the local council to change the border so that the estate will fall on the other side.

897
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:19,300
This would mean that the council estate will fall outside the catchment area of Pagford's school,

898
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:22,300
so the poor children will no longer be able to attend.

899
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:29,300
And the council also seek to close down a drug rehabilitation clinic in use by the inhabitants of the council estate.

900
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:32,300
Those seeking this change are presented unsympathetically.

901
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:35,300
They are conservative, they're small-minded, they're cruel,

902
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:41,300
and their response to social problems is to sweep them under the rug to make them someone else's responsibility.

903
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:47,300
Now, on the other side of the debate, we have the members of the Pagford council who argue against the border change,

904
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:50,300
who want things to remain as they are.

905
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:53,300
Now, principal among these is Barry Fairbrother,

906
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:58,300
who himself was born on the council estate before attending Pagford's fancy school,

907
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:01,300
studying hard, and becoming a bank manager.

908
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:07,300
So he is a living example of the opportunity he's trying to preserve for the other inhabitants of the estate.

909
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:13,300
So Rowling portrays several serious social problems caused by poverty and inequality,

910
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:20,300
but in response to these problems, the best her characters can imagine to do is to perpetuate the status quo.

911
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:26,300
The political conflict in the novel is between a side who want to actively change society for the worse,

912
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:29,300
and a side who want to keep things as they are.

913
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:33,300
There is no one who argues that the system should be changed for the better.

914
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:40,300
Even if the more sympathetic characters win, all they will achieve is a continuation of the current state of affairs,

915
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:43,300
along with its rampant poverty and inequality.

916
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:47,300
But in Rowling's world, there can be no systemic solution to poverty,

917
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:51,300
because poverty is unchangeable, it's simply a fact of life.

918
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:55,300
There can only be the individual opportunity to escape it.

919
01:13:55,300 --> 01:14:00,300
Nobody is arguing that the poor residents of the council estate deserve a better life.

920
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:05,300
They only deserve the opportunity to prove themselves worthy of a better life.

921
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:10,300
We muggles have no sorting hat to simply tell us who is good and bad.

922
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:14,300
Instead, we have meritocracy to sort the deserving from the undeserving.

923
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:18,300
Will you become a depressed drug addict, or will you go to school and work hard?

924
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:24,300
And if you work hard enough, even the poorest among us can become a bank manager.

925
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:26,300
How inspiring.

926
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:31,300
You too can ascend the financial system that's causing the poverty you escaped from.

927
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:38,300
Now, I'm not saying stories with social problems necessarily have to fully resolve those social problems by the end,

928
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:39,300
because they don't.

929
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:44,300
But if you're trying to tell a societal story, then your society should be a living thing.

930
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:50,300
It should be at least potentially flexible, contain at least the possibility for change, both good and bad.

931
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:54,300
But Rowling's worlds are set in stone. They're dead.

932
01:14:54,300 --> 01:15:01,300
The good in Rowling's story seeks only to cancel out evil, to undo evil's changes.

933
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:07,300
The solution to systemic problems is never to seek systemic change, but to be individually nicer,

934
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:12,300
to have nicer bank managers, to have nicer slave owners.

935
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:17,300
Which brings us back to the slaveheads in the little Christmas hats.

936
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:25,300
The solution to the systemic problem of slavery in the Harry Potter novels is for individuals to be nicer to their slaves.

937
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:29,300
I'm not kidding. That is the cap to the slavery theme.

938
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:35,300
Creature betrays Sirius because Sirius was mean to him, but Harry and friends learn to be nice to Creature,

939
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:38,300
after which he serves them loyally.

940
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:42,300
This is the payoff here. Be nice to your slaves.

941
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:47,300
This is laid out explicitly in an article about slavery on the Pottermore website.

942
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:49,300
So this article is titled,

943
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:59,300
If Hogwarts had a debate in club, what might it say on the subject of elf rights?

944
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:04,300
We explored both sides of the argument, spurred by Hermione and Spew.

945
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:09,300
So that's right, we're going to debate the pros and cons of slavery.

946
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:15,300
Firstly, the article covers Hermione's argument against slavery, but crucially, it gets it wrong.

947
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:19,300
After witnessing the mistreatment of Winky at the Quidditch World Cup,

948
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:25,300
Hermione discovered there were house elves at Hogwarts cooking and cleaning for zero pay, and yet nobody seemed to care.

949
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:31,300
Horrified to the point where she couldn't stomach the Hogwarts feast, she described the situation in two words.

950
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,300
Slave labour.

951
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:37,300
While it sounds heavy-handed, no it doesn't, that's just what it is,

952
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:39,300
Hermione does have a point.

953
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:47,300
No matter how you slice it, house elves are unpaid labourers, magically bound to serve, left at the mercy of their respective owners.

954
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:50,300
The system is ripe for abuse.

955
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:57,300
Now, this is where the article really goes wrong, because the system is not ripe for abuse, it is abuse.

956
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:03,300
The problem is not that slave owners might be mean to their slaves, it's that they own slaves at all.

957
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:07,300
This is one thing Rowling and her books don't get about slavery.

958
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:09,300
Slavery is wrong.

959
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:18,300
Slavery is wrong, regardless of what the slaves think, because it's wrong to benefit from slavery at all.

960
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:24,300
The article then goes on to list the arguments in favour of slavery, and it says,

961
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:29,300
Miss Granger is at best overzealous, and her goals are, at worst, unattainable.

962
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:36,300
Hermione may have meant well, but at the same time did end up dragging a peaceful group into a political battlefield,

963
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:38,300
just because she felt that's what they should want.

964
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:43,300
Was she helping, or interfering in a culture she didn't understand?

965
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:51,300
Oh boy, haughty old Hermione bringing politics into everything, even our peaceful system of slavery.

966
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:57,300
On the subject of Winky, the freed slave who becomes a depressed alcoholic, the article says,

967
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:17,300
Now, I don't know what to say here about this article arguing that it's irresponsible to free slaves, so I'm just gonna move on.

968
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:20,300
The article summarises its arguments by saying that,

969
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:40,300
This article doesn't exist anymore, by the way. They took it down, for what I hope are obvious reasons.

970
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:45,300
Anyway, the article concludes with its message about being nice to your slaves.

971
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:54,300
Before we go, let's consider Kreacher. Think of how he changed when treated with kindness by his new master, Harry Potter.

972
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:57,300
Previously, he'd been bitter and unpleasant.

973
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:02,300
Not to mention a liability to his previous owner.

974
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:06,300
Had Sirius treated him a little better, things might have worked out differently.

975
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:12,300
Dumbledore was right. Being kind to Kreacher was in everyone's best interests.

976
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:19,300
I think we need a palate cleanser after that, so allow me to briefly tell you a different story.

977
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:26,300
So, the Discworld novel Snuff is part of the City Watch series, which are like fantasy crime novels, basically.

978
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:31,300
In that book, Sam Vimes, the commander of the City Watch, is on holiday in the countryside

979
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:37,300
when he uncovers evidence of a plot to enslave goblins and force them to work on tobacco plantations.

980
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:43,300
So the crime to be solved in this crime novel is the slavery of a sapient magical race.

981
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:48,300
Now, most people on the Discworld think of the goblins more as pests than as people.

982
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:55,300
Goblins are small and weird, and they have cultural and spiritual practices that are difficult for outsiders to understand.

983
01:19:55,300 --> 01:20:00,300
For instance, they store all of their bodily secretions in little pots that they carry around.

984
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:05,300
The dominant society of the Discworld is undergoing a change akin to our Industrial Revolution,

985
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:09,300
with the advent of technologies like trains and wireless communication.

986
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:17,300
And this society does not see goblins as useful. It sees them as outsiders, as savages, and they're treated like vermin.

987
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:23,300
So when Vimes arrives in the countryside for his holiday and finds that the local pub is called the Goblin's Head,

988
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:29,300
and that there is an actual stuffed goblin head mounted on the wall, he doesn't think too much of it.

989
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:32,300
After all, it's only a goblin, isn't it?

990
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:38,300
If there's a hierarchy of cultures on the Discworld in terms of power they have and respect they receive,

991
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:41,300
the goblins are very much on the bottom.

992
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:46,300
And intelligently here, Pratchett shows how the attitude that the goblins are somehow lesser beings

993
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:49,300
has even been accepted to a degree by the goblins themselves.

994
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:56,300
Notably, we're told that when a group of goblins was rounded up to be enslaved, they went passively and did not fight back.

995
01:20:56,300 --> 01:21:02,300
As Vimes begins investigating the murder of a goblin and then later the slavery of the goblins, however,

996
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:04,300
he has cause to interact with them.

997
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:12,300
And in the course of these interactions, he realizes that rather than being vermin, they are thinking and feeling beings just like him.

998
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:18,300
He speaks to a goblin who is air quotes, civilized. She can speak his language and play the harp.

999
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:23,300
And on talking to this goblin, on coming to the realization that they are people,

1000
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:28,300
Vimes remembers the goblin head mounted on the wall of the pub and he thinks to himself,

1001
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:31,300
someone is going to burn.

1002
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:36,300
And then just a few pages later, Vimes goes to the pub, puts the landlord in a headlock,

1003
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:41,300
and tells him that if he doesn't take the goblin head off the wall, then he's going to set the building on fire.

1004
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:47,300
And I can't tell you how cathartic this was to read after slogging through seven novels

1005
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:53,300
of Harry Potter's passive, uninterested acceptance of the world as it is.

1006
01:21:53,300 --> 01:22:01,300
Imagine a hero who gets actually angry at injustice and then does something about it. What a treat.

1007
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:04,300
Also, goblins don't have rights in the Discworld.

1008
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:09,300
There's nothing illegal about rounding up goblins and shipping them off somewhere, but that doesn't matter.

1009
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:14,300
It doesn't matter if it's legal or not, and it doesn't matter if the goblins protest or not.

1010
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:17,300
Snuff says slavery is still a crime.

1011
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:23,300
Now, Snuff ends, spoiler alert, with goblins being granted rights and protections under the law.

1012
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:30,300
Because obviously, if your story is about a systemic injustice and you want your heroes to triumph and have a happy ending,

1013
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:33,300
then that injustice needs a systemic correction.

1014
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:37,300
And, of course, the goblin's head comes off the wall of the pub.

1015
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:42,300
Now, I don't know if Snuff was intended to be a response to Rowling's house elves at all,

1016
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:47,300
but the bit with the stuffed head mounted on the wall certainly makes it read as though it is.

1017
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:52,300
If Rowling had written Snuff, Vimes would save the one goblin he met who could play the harp,

1018
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:56,300
and the rest of them would still be on the tobacco plantation.

1019
01:22:56,300 --> 01:23:00,300
Actually, the first Fantastic Beasts movie has just such an ending.

1020
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:06,300
In that movie, Newt Scamander makes a muggle friend, Jacob, who works in a canning factory.

1021
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:10,300
It's the only work he can find, and he hates it, and it's miserable.

1022
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:14,300
Him and his fellow workers are, as he states, dying in there.

1023
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:16,300
Working in the factory, quote,

1024
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:32,300
Then, at the end of the movie, Newt Scamander gives Jacob a bunch of magical silver eggs, which he uses to set up his bakery.

1025
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:36,300
He also leaves him a note saying he's wasted in a canning factory.

1026
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:43,300
But I was thinking during these scenes, what about these other guys still working at the canning factory?

1027
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:50,300
Don't they have dreams? Don't they have things they'd rather be doing than toiling away in the canning factory?

1028
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:53,300
Where are their magic eggs, exactly?

1029
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:59,300
I guess it's their fault, really, for not also making a magical friend who can give them some magical money.

1030
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:04,300
And ultimately, the world still needs things canned, doesn't it?

1031
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:06,300
So back in the factory, you lot.

1032
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:12,300
We've already selected the one special person among you who is worthy of a better life.

1033
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:14,300
Anyway, I want now to ask a question.

1034
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:19,300
The excuses that Rowling's characters give for keeping the elves in slavery,

1035
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:25,300
they like it, it's the best thing for them, if we set them free, they'd just become troublesome drunks.

1036
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:31,300
These are obviously similar to real-world excuses for the continued enslavement of groups of humans.

1037
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:38,300
These were arguments once made about the supposed dangers of freeing enslaved black people in the United States, for instance.

1038
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:45,300
Now, Rowling would argue that the elves in her books are not supposed to be a commentary on any real-world instances of slavery,

1039
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:49,300
but my question is, does it matter what the intention was here?

1040
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:51,300
And I'd argue no, it doesn't.

1041
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:57,300
If the similarities exist, they exist, regardless of what the author's intent was.

1042
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:02,300
And with that said, I think it's time to talk about Rowling's goblins.

1043
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:06,300
Now, Rowling's goblins have been widely criticized as antisemitic,

1044
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:11,300
appearing as they do, similar to antisemitic stereotypes of Jewish people.

1045
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:15,300
They're greedy, they're untrustworthy, they run the banking system,

1046
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:24,300
and the Harry Potter people didn't do themselves any favors in this regard by having a large six-pointed star appear on the floor of Gringotts in the first movie.

1047
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:32,300
That was, uh, unfortunate, wasn't it? You didn't want to edit that out? No? Throw a rug over it or something?

1048
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:38,300
Now, of course, many fantasy stories use fantasy races as stand-ins for groups of real humans.

1049
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:45,300
I talked in a recent video about the Discworld's dwarves, for instance, being used to both explore LGBT issues

1050
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:50,300
and conflicts between the moderately religious and the more hardline religious.

1051
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:56,300
Star Trek, as another example, uses fantasy races to comment on particular real-world issues.

1052
01:25:56,300 --> 01:26:01,300
Think of the alien race who are half white and half black but still discriminate against one another

1053
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:07,300
and are used in a rather heavy-handed way to highlight the absurdity of racism.

1054
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:12,300
Star Trek also uses real-world cultures as a basis for many of its races.

1055
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:15,300
The Romulans are based on ancient Rome, for example.

1056
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:19,300
The Klingons, in their various incarnations, draw from several cultures.

1057
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:24,300
The Mongol Empire, there's some ancient Japan, there's some Vikings.

1058
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:30,300
But I want to talk about the Ferengi here. I want to compare the Ferengi to Rowling's goblins.

1059
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:37,300
Now, the Ferengi are portrayed as a culture driven primarily by material wealth, profit, and exploitation.

1060
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:45,300
They are capitalists, basically. They're used to represent and parody us, you know, humans as we exist now,

1061
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:48,300
before we became utopian space communists.

1062
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:54,300
But it's also not hard to imagine the same criticisms aimed at Rowling's goblins being also aimed at the Ferengi,

1063
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:58,300
with their oversized facial features and obsessive greed.

1064
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:04,300
And indeed, over the years, people have accused the Ferengi of being similar to antisemitic stereotypes.

1065
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:06,300
So, is there a difference here?

1066
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:14,300
Now, to start, I should say that it's not my place to say whether or not anyone can or cannot get offended by the way the Ferengi are depicted.

1067
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:15,300
That's not up to me.

1068
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:21,300
But I think we can use the Ferengi here to show what I'd argue is a big problem with not only Rowling's goblins,

1069
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:24,300
but her handling of fantasy races in general.

1070
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:30,300
So, in their first few appearances on The Next Generation, the Ferengi were used as recurring villains, essentially.

1071
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:37,300
They're a contrast to the humans of the Federation in that they're greedy and duplicitous and very misogynistic.

1072
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:43,300
And if this is how the Ferengi remained, I'd have nothing more to say here. They would be like Rowling's goblins.

1073
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:49,300
What complicates the Ferengi is their later appearances, particularly on the show Deep Space Nine,

1074
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:52,300
which introduces several Ferengi characters to the main cast.

1075
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:57,300
Principal among these being Quark, the owner of the Space Station's bar.

1076
01:27:57,300 --> 01:28:04,300
And what we see in this show are Ferengi who grow to differ from their society's expectation of what a good Ferengi should be.

1077
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:10,300
We see Quark's nephew Nog insisting he wants to join Starfleet rather than go into business.

1078
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:15,300
We see Quark's brother Rom organize a labor strike in protest of how he treats his employees.

1079
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:21,300
Even Quark himself occasionally passes up profit in favor of doing the right thing.

1080
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:25,300
And we see that wider Ferengi society is also subject to change.

1081
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:34,300
Ferengi women, previously forbidden from even wearing clothes, are granted rights over the course of the series, among other political changes.

1082
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:43,300
What this all means is that we now know that though the Ferengi are typically greedy and selfish and opportunistic and sexist, they do not have to be.

1083
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:52,300
These traits are the cultural and social traits of a particular society, a society that is alive and is subject to change.

1084
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:58,300
Over time, the Ferengi become less arguably a stand-in for any one particular group of humans,

1085
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:04,300
and more arguably a representation of how people behave under certain societal and cultural conditions.

1086
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:11,300
After we witness the existence of Ferengi who defy societal norms and the flexibility of Ferengi society itself,

1087
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:15,300
these traits can no longer be construed as simply racial traits.

1088
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:24,300
But J.K. Rowling, as we've seen, cannot write flexible societies, so she cannot give any of this additional characterization to her fantasy races.

1089
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:29,300
There is none of the depth to Rowling's goblins like there comes to be for the Ferengi.

1090
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:33,300
They simply are the way they are because they are goblins.

1091
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:39,300
Their different beliefs and behaviors stem from the fact that they are, as Bill Weasley puts it,

1092
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:52,300
Now, there's an ongoing conversation about the presentation of fixed racial traits in fantasy races,

1093
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:58,300
particularly when it comes to questions of morality, of a race being inherently good or evil.

1094
01:29:58,300 --> 01:30:04,300
Wizards of the Coast recently removed the racial alignments from the fantasy races of Dungeons and Dragons, for instance,

1095
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:07,300
and I agree with that move. I think it's a good one.

1096
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:11,300
Not only does it create the opportunity for more interesting stories,

1097
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:20,300
a fantasy world having certain races who are just evil by default obviously has some problematic real-world parallels.

1098
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:22,300
But back to Rowling's goblins.

1099
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:26,300
The principal goblin character in the Harry Potter story is Griphook,

1100
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:31,300
who is the goblin from book one who takes Harry to see his giant pile of gulp for the first time.

1101
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:39,300
And then he returns in the final book to help Harry and his friends break into Gringotts in order to retrieve one of Voldemort's Horcruxes.

1102
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:44,300
Potentially troublesome for this alliance is the history of animosity between wizards and goblins.

1103
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:51,300
Goblins are remaining neutral in the conflict with Voldemort. They see it as a wizard matter for wizards to deal with.

1104
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:58,300
Griphook and Ron have an argument. Griphook complains about the fact that wizards treat goblins as second-class citizens,

1105
01:30:58,300 --> 01:31:06,300
and Ron counters that the goblins aren't perfect either and have metalworking secrets they refuse to share with the wizards or whatever.

1106
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:13,300
Also complicating things is that goblins have a different idea about the concept of ownership than wizards do.

1107
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:20,300
For goblins, whoever first creates an object is the owner, and subsequent purchases are basically rentals,

1108
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:26,300
meaning the goblins see goblin-made objects like the sword of Gryffindor as belonging to the goblins.

1109
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:30,300
So, what a tricky situation our heroes find themselves in.

1110
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:39,300
However, are they going to convince Griphook to ally with them, considering all their differences and the history of division between goblins and wizards?

1111
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:41,300
And the answer is, they don't.

1112
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:46,300
Harry gets Griphook to work with them temporarily by promising to give him the sword of Gryffindor,

1113
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:50,300
but intends to betray him and keep the sword until Voldemort is gone.

1114
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:56,300
Griphook likewise betrays Harry and steals the sword midway through the mission before abandoning him.

1115
01:31:56,300 --> 01:32:02,300
And then despite that, Harry and his friends successfully attain the Horcrux and escape anyway.

1116
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:08,300
So, what was the point, we might wonder, of all that stuff about the division between goblins and wizards?

1117
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:14,300
You know, here's a history of racial conflict, some racial differences that proved to be irreconcilable,

1118
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:16,300
and then it doesn't matter anyway.

1119
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:22,300
It's set up like Harry and his friends are going to have to find some way to navigate this conflict in their world,

1120
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:24,300
but then they don't. They fail at that.

1121
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:28,300
But then they still succeed at their ultimate goal anyway, so it didn't matter.

1122
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:34,300
It's almost like Rowling's in two minds about the politics of the fantasy races in her novels.

1123
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:38,300
She clearly wants those elements in there, otherwise they wouldn't be in there,

1124
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:43,300
but she doesn't want them to actually mean anything or affect the plot in any significant way.

1125
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:48,300
What Harry Potter is really missing is a good old council scene, right?

1126
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:54,300
So there's a big evil threat to the world, once thought defeated but recently resurgent,

1127
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:57,300
and to defeat it is going to take unity and cooperation.

1128
01:32:57,300 --> 01:33:00,300
However, the peoples of the world are divided.

1129
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:08,300
They bicker amongst themselves, and their divisions are exploited by the evil antagonist in order to facilitate his return to power.

1130
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:15,300
Now, in Lord of the Rings, Sauron is defeated in a strictly mechanical sense by throwing the ring into Mount Doom,

1131
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:21,300
but that act is only possible after the story resolves those previous divisions that it set up.

1132
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:24,300
So Rohan needs to be saved.

1133
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:27,300
Rohan needs to answer Gondor's call for aid.

1134
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:30,300
Legolas and Gimli need to become friends.

1135
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:35,300
The Alliance needs to mount a last stand to draw Sauron's forces out of Mordor.

1136
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:39,300
Only then is it actually possible to defeat Sauron.

1137
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:45,300
In Harry Potter, similar elements are set up in their conflict with Voldemort, but then they just don't pay off.

1138
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:47,300
The slaves aren't freed.

1139
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:50,300
Non-human races aren't given equal rights.

1140
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:52,300
The goblins remain neutral.

1141
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:54,300
Harry and Griphook betray each other.

1142
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:56,300
Nothing changes in the world.

1143
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:58,300
But then they just win anyway.

1144
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:03,300
A lot's been said about the disappointing ending of Harry Potter, but like a lot of disappointing endings,

1145
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:08,300
it's not that the author was writing a good story and then just messed up at the conclusion.

1146
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:14,300
Rather, it's the point at which you're forced to realize that you're never getting a payoff to a lot of what was set up.

1147
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:19,300
It's where you have to realize that you've just been reading a disappointing story.

1148
01:34:19,300 --> 01:34:23,300
There's a scene at the end of the last Harry Potter book after the defeat of Voldemort,

1149
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:28,300
which is like a peek into an alternate universe where the story was actually good.

1150
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:33,300
McGonagall had replaced the house tables, but nobody was sitting according to house anymore.

1151
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:35,300
All were jumbled together.

1152
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:39,300
Teachers and pupils, ghosts and parents, centaurs and house elves.

1153
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:42,300
Now, this could have been a very powerful image.

1154
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:48,300
If defeating Voldemort had meant defeating his supremacist ideology and achieving equality,

1155
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:55,300
this scene with all the different people and races sitting where they like un-segregated would have been a fitting conclusion.

1156
01:34:55,300 --> 01:35:00,300
But the Harry Potter series we have never earns this ending.

1157
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:05,300
None of these themes end up being important at all in Harry's final confrontation with Voldemort.

1158
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:12,300
The centaurs join the final battle not because anything has changed for them, but because Hagrid nags them, basically.

1159
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:17,300
The house elves join the final battle led by Creature not because anything has changed for them,

1160
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:20,300
but because Harry is just such a nice slave owner.

1161
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:26,300
And as for Harry and Voldemort, Rowling has them talking primarily about wand mechanics.

1162
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:32,300
You see, Voldemort previously couldn't kill Harry because their wands share a core or something,

1163
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:39,300
so he sought out the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand in the world, in order to finish Harry off for good.

1164
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:45,300
The problem is the Elder Wand will only obey its master, and that isn't the person who's holding it,

1165
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:48,300
that's the person who defeated its previous owner.

1166
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:56,300
Voldemort thinks he is the master of the wand because he killed Snape, who killed Dumbledore, who was the previous master of the wand.

1167
01:35:56,300 --> 01:36:02,300
Harry thinks he is the master of the wand because before Dumbledore was killed, he was disarmed by Draco,

1168
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:09,300
who was in turn later disarmed by Harry at Malfoy Manor, an event for which the Elder Wand was not present.

1169
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:11,300
So, the question is this.

1170
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:18,300
Does the Elder Wand somehow know that Harry took Draco's wand from him even though it wasn't there?

1171
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:24,300
And will the Elder Wand therefore not work when Voldemort uses it to try to cast a killing curse at Harry?

1172
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:28,300
And the answer is, of course, who cares?

1173
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:32,300
Why is this what Harry and Voldemort are talking about in their final showdown?

1174
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:43,300
You know, seven novels of conflict, and their final fight is decided upon by the inscrutable, just-introduced mechanics of a sentient magical stick.

1175
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:47,300
They may as well have flipped a coin to decide who wins the final fight.

1176
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:52,300
So, the stick decides in Harry's favor, and Voldemort's spell bounces back at him and kills him.

1177
01:36:52,300 --> 01:37:00,300
He goes out pretty much the same as Gilderoy Lockhart, trying to use a broken wand that backfires and hits him instead.

1178
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:08,300
Harry has no active part in any of this, he's just a prop off which Voldemort bounces a spell exactly the same as when he was a baby.

1179
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:15,300
Now, not only does the Harry Potter series not earn the scene with all the Hogwarts houses and races sitting wherever they please,

1180
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:21,300
it actually undermines it in the actual ending of Harry Potter, the epilogue set 19 years in the future,

1181
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:27,300
which shows Harry sending his son off to Hogwarts, with his son worrying that he'll be sorted into Slytherin.

1182
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:31,300
So, they've kept Slytherin. They've still kept Slytherin there.

1183
01:37:31,300 --> 01:37:36,300
Now, I know it's an old joke, why doesn't Hogwarts just get rid of the evil house?

1184
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:46,300
But they definitely should have after the fall of Voldemort, when the entirety, all of the Slytherin student body either fled or joined Voldemort.

1185
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:51,300
But more than just Slytherin, they've kept the segregation of the school children.

1186
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:54,300
The desegregation was just a one-day affair, I guess.

1187
01:37:54,300 --> 01:38:01,300
And I suppose the house elves got a 15-minute break after Voldemort was killed, and then it was back to work.

1188
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:05,300
Actually, the final sentence of the final novel, prior to the epilogue,

1189
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:11,300
is Harry wondering if he can get Creature, his slave, to bring him a sandwich.

1190
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:16,300
Anyway, this epilogue, where all the characters have paired off and had a dozen kids,

1191
01:38:16,300 --> 01:38:21,300
all named after the characters who died in the series, is embarrassing to start.

1192
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:24,300
It's worse than the cringiest fanfiction.

1193
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:29,300
But it's also depressing, because it reveals to us that nothing has changed in this world.

1194
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:32,300
This is presented by Rowling as though it's a good thing.

1195
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:38,300
But in reality, the ending of Harry Potter is even more dismal an ending than in 1984.

1196
01:38:38,300 --> 01:38:40,300
Slavery was not ended.

1197
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:42,300
Equality was not achieved.

1198
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:48,300
We're still segregating the school children according to supposedly innate characteristics.

1199
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:50,300
We learned nothing, basically.

1200
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:56,300
But now it's 19 years later, and my scar is not hurting, so all is well.

1201
01:38:56,300 --> 01:39:01,300
Harry Potter is ultimately not the right character for the story he's in.

1202
01:39:01,300 --> 01:39:06,300
Harry, as a mostly passive audience point of view, works in the first few novels,

1203
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:12,300
but as the series goes on and Rowling fully reveals all the problems inherent to the wizarding world,

1204
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:16,300
Harry's passivity becomes an unintentional, tragic flaw.

1205
01:39:16,300 --> 01:39:22,300
We learn in The Cursed Child that an adult Harry has become the head of magical law enforcement.

1206
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:25,300
He is the top cop in the wizarding world.

1207
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:30,300
It's now his day job to ensure that nothing changes in his society.

1208
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:34,300
And he's friends with Hermione, who is now the minister for magic.

1209
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:38,300
Hermione did the most homework, which means she gets to be the prime minister,

1210
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:44,300
because you see, the real magic in Harry Potter is a functional neoliberal meritocracy.

1211
01:39:44,300 --> 01:39:51,300
Harry Potter is not just a Cinderella fantasy, it's a liberal fantasy, one in which conservatives get bullied,

1212
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:58,300
evil defeats itself, and societal change is unnecessary because the slaves like it where they are.

1213
01:39:58,300 --> 01:39:59,300
Harry Potter asks,

1214
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:10,300
Now, before I leave today, there's still one very pressing question that we haven't answered.

1215
01:40:10,300 --> 01:40:13,300
Why didn't the wizards stop Hitler?

1216
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:18,300
Why didn't the wizards use their magic to prevent the various atrocities of World War II?

1217
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:22,300
Now, you might say, it doesn't matter. It's a joke question.

1218
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:26,300
There is absolutely no reason we need an actual answer to it.

1219
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:33,300
But I feel like I know what's been happening inside J.K. Rowling's mind post the main Harry Potter series.

1220
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:37,300
You brats keep asking why the wizards didn't stop World War II.

1221
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:40,300
Well, I'll show you.

1222
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:44,300
So the Fantastic Beasts movies are set in the decade prior to World War II,

1223
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:51,300
and one of antagonist Gellert Grindelwald's stated motivations for his actions is to prevent World War II.

1224
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:55,300
Not cause it, but prevent it.

1225
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:59,300
At a rally, he shows prophecies of images from World War II.

1226
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:05,300
We see the Blitz, a nuclear bomb going off, and a column of people marching beside a series of train cars.

1227
01:41:05,300 --> 01:41:07,300
So, very classy.

1228
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:10,300
Thank you, Fantastic Beasts movies.

1229
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:13,300
Come for the whimsical, magical animals.

1230
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:16,300
Stay for the grim portrayals of the Holocaust.

1231
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:22,300
Now, you might say Grindelwald is being disingenuous in his stated desire to prevent World War II,

1232
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:26,300
and is just using it as an excuse to attract people to his cause.

1233
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:30,300
But as an audience watching it today, we know that he was right.

1234
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:32,300
His prophecies were accurate.

1235
01:41:32,300 --> 01:41:34,300
These things did happen.

1236
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:38,300
And we also know that the wizards didn't stop World War II.

1237
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:43,300
And this isn't some dangerous butterfly effect messing about with the time machine stuff.

1238
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:46,300
These events are future events for the characters in the story.

1239
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:49,300
There's no reason they shouldn't want to prevent this,

1240
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:54,300
but the only person who even claims to want to prevent it is the bad guy.

1241
01:41:54,300 --> 01:42:02,300
Now, what this means is that when Dumbledore and Newt Scamander and their Fantastic Beasts are fighting against Grindelwald,

1242
01:42:02,300 --> 01:42:07,300
they're fighting to save World War II and make sure that it happens.

1243
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:14,300
This is the anti-change ideology of the Harry Potter series taken to its logical end point, right?

1244
01:42:14,300 --> 01:42:19,300
The wizards didn't stop Hitler, because stopping Hitler is wrong.

1245
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:25,300
Now, I've no idea how close the Fantastic Beasts movies are actually going to get to World War II,

1246
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:30,300
but Rowling once stated on Twitter that the series is supposed to end in 1945,

1247
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:32,300
which would mean that they cover all of it.

1248
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:36,300
Now, I'll end with a plea from me to J.K. Rowling today.

1249
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:40,300
So, listen, Joanne, please don't.

1250
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:42,300
This isn't something we need to see.

1251
01:42:42,300 --> 01:42:47,300
There's no good answer to the question, why didn't the wizards stop Hitler?

1252
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:53,300
You can't write your way out of this. You're not good enough. Just accept it.

1253
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:59,300
The best case scenario here is that this series gets cancelled before we see what you're planning.

1254
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:04,300
Now, before I go today, I'm going to wrap up with a few clarifications.

1255
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:09,300
Firstly, this video is not meant to be an exhaustive list of everything wrong with Harry Potter.

1256
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:11,300
There's plenty I didn't mention.

1257
01:43:11,300 --> 01:43:17,300
For instance, Rowling once stated that her werewolves were supposed to be a metaphor for having HIV,

1258
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:24,300
and then she made one of her main werewolf characters a predator who attacks children to purposely infect them with werewolfism.

1259
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:26,300
I didn't mention that.

1260
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:31,300
Well, I did right now as an example of something I didn't mention, but you know what I mean.

1261
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:37,300
I'd also like to make clear that Harry Potter's anti-change problem is by no means unique.

1262
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:42,300
Think of all the Hollywood blockbusters in which the good side are those seeking to preserve the status quo,

1263
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:48,300
and the antagonists are people with legitimate grievances about the world and a desire to change it,

1264
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:55,300
and then they pull a cheap trick and have the antagonists just murder a baby or something so the audience knows that they're the bad guys.

1265
01:43:55,300 --> 01:44:01,300
This is art produced by the rich, people who have done very well under capitalism, thank you very much,

1266
01:44:01,300 --> 01:44:08,300
and therefore see all systemic change as inherently evil, no matter how reasonable it might seem on the surface.

1267
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:17,300
Next, I'd like to clarify that my criticisms of Harry Potter aren't a moral condemnation of anyone who still finds things to enjoy about the books.

1268
01:44:17,300 --> 01:44:20,300
I've compared Harry Potter to a bunch of other stories today,

1269
01:44:20,300 --> 01:44:24,300
and I'd like to make clear that I'm not saying Harry Potter is the wrong way to do things,

1270
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:30,300
and those other stories are the right way, necessarily, because it's more complicated than that.

1271
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:36,300
In the specific instances I compared them to Harry Potter, I believe they are better or more interesting,

1272
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:39,300
but that obviously doesn't mean they're without problems themselves.

1273
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:43,300
Lord of the Rings obviously has issues with its evil fantasy races.

1274
01:44:43,300 --> 01:44:50,300
Deep Space Nine, while excellent a lot of the time, has also broadcast some of the worst episodes of television ever created,

1275
01:44:50,300 --> 01:44:53,300
and the Discworld novel Snuff has its own problems.

1276
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:59,300
Now, I'd argue it is to a degree aware of some of its problems and does investigate them in the text,

1277
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:06,300
but at the end of the day, it still is a story about a powerful white guy turning up and solving a bunch of other people's problems.

1278
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:14,300
Now, while that's still very much more satisfying to read than Harry Potter's complete refusal to engage with his society's problems,

1279
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:17,300
that's not a trope that is without its harmful aspects.

1280
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:20,300
We have had a lot of those stories, haven't we?

1281
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:26,300
So, yes, if you still like Harry Potter, don't worry, I'm not saying you're a Slytherin.

1282
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:32,300
