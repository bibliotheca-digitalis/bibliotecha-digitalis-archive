00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
Hello, everyone. This is a video responding to a Prager University video titled

00:05.040 --> 00:08.000
If You Live in Freedom, Thank the British Empire,

00:08.000 --> 00:12.640
hosted on the PragerU YouTube channel, currently with about one million views.

00:12.640 --> 00:16.160
The video is narrated by H. W. Crocker III,

00:16.160 --> 00:21.040
described by PragerU as a military historian and best-selling author.

00:21.040 --> 00:26.320
So a few months ago, I made a video about PragerU titled How PragerU Lies to You,

00:26.320 --> 00:32.560
where I put forward the radical, shocking idea that Prager University isn't actually a university,

00:32.560 --> 00:36.640
but is instead a YouTube channel funded by fossil fuel billionaires

00:36.640 --> 00:41.520
with the aim of promoting a biased and factually incorrect far-right worldview.

00:42.160 --> 00:46.800
All of which, I think you'll find, is undeniably true and beyond dispute.

00:47.440 --> 00:52.080
Now, in that video, I mentioned that there were a few PragerU courses,

00:52.080 --> 00:57.600
and remember, by courses, I mean YouTube videos, that were worthy of a more in-depth look.

00:57.600 --> 01:02.480
And so I've decided to take a peek at what is probably the worst of the bunch today.

01:02.480 --> 01:07.680
In fact, it is to me the most blatant propaganda PragerU have ever published.

01:07.680 --> 01:11.760
Before we get to it, though, I should mention that there are several other YouTube channels

01:11.760 --> 01:14.320
who have produced their own responses to this video,

01:14.320 --> 01:19.280
which you'll find if you do a YouTube search for PragerU British Empire Response.

01:19.280 --> 01:24.080
Now, usually, seeing this sort of thing dissuades me from making my own video on the subject,

01:24.080 --> 01:26.720
as I consider the topic covered ground.

01:26.720 --> 01:30.640
But with this video, I just couldn't help getting in on the action myself.

01:30.640 --> 01:32.320
It is just that bad.

01:32.320 --> 01:35.600
As always, I'd recommend that you watch PragerU's video first,

01:35.600 --> 01:38.400
so you can be sure I'm not misrepresenting them,

01:38.400 --> 01:41.360
although I will be showing short clips here as I go.

01:42.080 --> 01:43.920
Right then, let's get to it.

01:43.920 --> 01:49.360
Freedom was an Englishman's right, and wherever he went, he took that right with him.

01:49.360 --> 01:52.400
Whether he was an English colonist in America,

01:52.400 --> 01:55.360
governing himself through a locally elected assembly...

01:55.360 --> 01:57.840
Okay, so I'll have to stop it there.

01:57.840 --> 02:00.640
That was quick. Doesn't bode well, does it?

02:00.640 --> 02:07.680
Now, I have to ask if this guy, H. W. Crocker, knows about the American Revolutionary War.

02:07.680 --> 02:12.320
And I ask this not just because of that brief clip describing the American colonists

02:12.320 --> 02:16.960
enjoying all that freedom they had, but also because of this later clip.

02:16.960 --> 02:43.600
So the United States should thank the great,

02:43.600 --> 02:48.720
liberty-loving empire that gave it its sense of inalienable rights.

02:48.720 --> 02:53.760
Now, nowhere in this video has it ever mentioned how the United States came to be,

02:53.760 --> 02:58.480
or that they fought a war against that great, liberty-loving empire

02:58.480 --> 03:01.280
in order to be free of its control.

03:01.280 --> 03:04.000
I mean, that doesn't really make any sense, does it?

03:04.000 --> 03:09.040
If your only information about the United States or the British Empire came from this video,

03:09.120 --> 03:14.720
you would conclude that the British Empire peacefully passed the freedom baton to the United States,

03:14.720 --> 03:19.040
appointing them the new defenders of justice and freedom and liberty,

03:19.040 --> 03:23.360
and all the other words that are used completely meaninglessly.

03:23.360 --> 03:28.400
The British always thought of themselves as liberators, as bringers of freedom.

03:29.360 --> 03:35.440
The British believed the final and necessary justification of their empire was a moral one.

03:35.440 --> 03:40.400
Now, here I'm afraid Mr. Crocker has fallen, perhaps deliberately,

03:40.400 --> 03:43.520
for some very out-of-date propaganda there.

03:43.520 --> 03:47.840
Claiming not to be conquerors or invaders, but actually liberators,

03:47.840 --> 03:51.920
has been a tactic of aggressors all through human history.

03:51.920 --> 03:57.920
The Roman Empire, for instance, disguised various aggressive campaigns as merely acts of defense.

03:57.920 --> 04:02.960
They exaggerated minor threats to justify overwhelming force, and so on.

04:02.960 --> 04:07.520
Even Nazi Germany claimed to be acting in self-defense when they invaded Poland,

04:07.520 --> 04:13.520
staging a series of false flag attacks carried out by the SS in what was called Operation Himmler.

04:13.520 --> 04:17.760
Hitler declared in response to the attacks that he faked

04:17.760 --> 04:25.440
that he was mobilizing his defense forces until the safety of the Reich and its rights are secured.

04:25.440 --> 04:29.760
The British Empire may have claimed at times to be liberating and freeing people,

04:29.760 --> 04:32.880
but that was just a smokescreen for its real aims.

04:32.960 --> 04:40.640
Territorial expansion, access to resources, power, glory, all the usual rubbish.

04:40.640 --> 04:45.760
I'd advise looking into the events preceding the 1879 Anglo-Zulu War,

04:45.760 --> 04:48.720
fought between the British Empire and the Zulu Kingdom,

04:48.720 --> 04:54.000
if you'd like a handy example of the British Empire's use of extremely flimsy pretexts

04:54.000 --> 04:58.240
for provoking and justifying wars with people it was just invading.

04:58.880 --> 05:03.120
Speaking of flimsy pretexts, how's that for a link there?

05:03.120 --> 05:07.520
Even Gandhi praised the British Empire, paraphrasing Jefferson,

05:07.520 --> 05:11.520
saying that he believed that the best government was the government that governed least,

05:11.520 --> 05:17.040
and that he found that the British Empire guaranteed his freedom and governed him least of all.

05:17.680 --> 05:19.760
Now, this is really amazing, this bit.

05:19.760 --> 05:25.440
I think it's probably the slimiest, most deceptive argument PragerU has ever uploaded,

05:25.440 --> 05:28.000
and that's a field with some pretty stiff competition.

05:28.080 --> 05:30.320
So, what's wrong with this quote?

05:30.320 --> 05:32.080
Did Gandhi say this?

05:32.080 --> 05:34.080
Well, kind of.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.160
This quote is actually a paraphrase,

05:36.160 --> 05:40.160
and I consider the tactic of writing it alongside a little cartoon Gandhi,

05:40.160 --> 05:44.960
as if he said those exact words, to be rather shady, to say the least.

05:44.960 --> 05:48.880
However, he did express that sentiment in 1915,

05:48.880 --> 05:54.080
as quoted in the speeches and writings of M.K. Gandhi, published in 1922.

05:54.080 --> 05:56.880
Now, in the West, if Gandhi is known for anything,

05:56.880 --> 06:01.280
it's being a proponent of non-violent resistance to the British rule of India.

06:01.280 --> 06:06.240
So, why would Gandhi, who thought that the British Empire was the best government ever,

06:06.240 --> 06:08.640
according to this PragerU video, at least,

06:08.640 --> 06:14.720
also be leading a resistance movement against it and asking that it leave India?

06:14.720 --> 06:16.880
What a puzzle we have here.

06:16.880 --> 06:20.800
Now, that quote from the PragerU video is from 1915.

06:20.800 --> 06:25.280
As I said, however, their little cartoon there is actually traced from a photograph

06:25.280 --> 06:29.200
of Gandhi outside Downing Street 15 years later,

06:29.200 --> 06:31.280
which is a little deceptive there.

06:31.280 --> 06:34.640
What could have happened in those intervening 15 years?

06:35.280 --> 06:37.440
Anything that could have perhaps altered

06:37.440 --> 06:40.800
Gandhi's appraisal of the British Empire's governing abilities?

06:41.440 --> 06:42.800
Well, we'll see.

06:42.800 --> 06:48.560
A content warning for particularly nasty descriptions of violence in this next section, folks.

06:48.560 --> 06:50.480
And we'll start with the Rowlett Act,

06:50.480 --> 06:55.440
otherwise known as the Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act of 1919,

06:55.440 --> 07:00.000
which was a legislative act passed by the Imperial Legislative Council in Delhi

07:00.000 --> 07:02.240
on the 10th of March 1919,

07:02.240 --> 07:07.360
indefinitely extending the emergency measures of preventative indefinite detention,

07:07.360 --> 07:10.720
incarceration without trial and judicial review,

07:10.720 --> 07:15.360
enacted in the Defense of India Act 1915 during the First World War.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.040
To quote Wikipedia there,

07:17.040 --> 07:19.600
indefinite detention without trial.

07:19.600 --> 07:23.120
That's the great liberty-loving empire at work there.

07:23.760 --> 07:26.960
Now, Gandhi responded to the passing of the Rowlett Act

07:26.960 --> 07:30.160
by promoting nonviolent civil disobedience,

07:30.160 --> 07:32.640
an act for which he himself was arrested.

07:33.360 --> 07:36.240
Gandhi's later resistance against the British Empire,

07:36.240 --> 07:39.120
the Salt March, the Quit India movement, and so on,

07:39.120 --> 07:41.120
are a little beyond the scope of my video,

07:41.120 --> 07:45.600
so right now we'll limit ourselves to this one particularly horrible event.

07:45.680 --> 07:48.480
So, on the 13th of April 1919,

07:48.480 --> 07:52.800
thousands of civilians gathered at a public garden in Amritsar

07:52.800 --> 07:55.520
to celebrate the Punjabi New Year Festival,

07:55.520 --> 07:59.760
as well as to protest the recent actions of the British Imperial government,

07:59.760 --> 08:02.080
including the passing of the Rowlett Act.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.520
Fearful of a rebellion,

08:03.520 --> 08:08.560
Colonel Reginald Dyer of the British Army ordered the main exits of the garden blocked,

08:08.560 --> 08:12.960
then ordered his troops to open fire without warning on the group of civilians.

08:13.520 --> 08:17.200
He later explained his actions were not to disperse the meeting,

08:17.200 --> 08:20.240
but to punish the Indians for disobedience.

08:20.240 --> 08:25.600
British Indian sources gave a figure of 379 dead with more than a thousand wounded,

08:25.600 --> 08:27.920
whereas the Indian National Congress estimated

08:27.920 --> 08:30.560
that around a thousand people were killed in the massacre.

08:30.560 --> 08:33.200
That's just one of the British Empire's terrible,

08:33.200 --> 08:35.920
violent massacres of innocent people there,

08:35.920 --> 08:38.960
none of which are mentioned in the PragerU video,

08:38.960 --> 08:41.360
and we have to wonder, why not?

08:42.240 --> 08:43.920
Well, not really.

08:43.920 --> 08:46.240
It's because they're shameless propagandists

08:46.240 --> 08:49.680
presenting a biased, one-sided view of history.

08:49.680 --> 08:52.640
PragerU takes the approach of sticking their head in the sand

08:52.640 --> 08:55.440
and pretending such events never took place,

08:55.440 --> 08:57.920
so who knows what they think about it.

08:57.920 --> 09:02.800
However, we do know what this guy in particular, Crocker, thinks about the incident,

09:02.800 --> 09:04.640
as he describes it in his book,

09:04.640 --> 09:07.920
The Politically Incorrect Guide to the British Empire.

09:08.800 --> 09:13.600
And I'd like to note the Free Cheers for Colonialism tagline there.

09:13.600 --> 09:18.720
Also, I'd like to note that his Gandhi-praised to the British Empire non-point

09:18.720 --> 09:22.240
takes top billing among a list of similarly silly ideas.

09:22.880 --> 09:27.920
Anyway, here's how Crocker introduces Daya, the colonel who ordered the massacre.

09:27.920 --> 09:30.800
Daya was a hero of the old school.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.600
He had been born in India and spent his childhood there

09:33.600 --> 09:36.400
before being educated in Ireland and at Sandhurst.

09:36.400 --> 09:41.680
He had a gallant record that extended from service in the northwest frontier to Burma.

09:41.680 --> 09:47.120
Most of all, he was a man who stood by the British imperial principles of justice,

09:47.120 --> 09:52.240
fair play, and decency delivered by force if necessary.

09:53.200 --> 09:53.760
Jesus.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.400
On the massacre, Crocker writes,

09:56.400 --> 10:00.480
Daya ordered his men into line and without delay gave the order to fire.

10:00.480 --> 10:04.880
379 Indians were killed and more than a thousand were wounded.

10:04.880 --> 10:09.600
The mob was dispersed and so was the feared rebellion in the Punjab.

10:09.600 --> 10:12.720
Daya became a hate figure to anti-colonialists.

10:13.600 --> 10:14.800
Imagine that.

10:14.800 --> 10:19.120
And was repudiated by liberal opinion and the British government at home.

10:19.120 --> 10:22.480
And for what? Just for murdering a bunch of people.

10:22.480 --> 10:23.360
Jeez.

10:23.360 --> 10:29.440
Crocker, PragerU's lecturer, is here justifying the deliberate massacre of unarmed civilians

10:29.440 --> 10:33.040
and calling the man who ordered that massacre a hero.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.840
And that's a direct quote. That is his own word.

10:36.400 --> 10:40.800
We see what he really thinks of liberty and justice and freedom here.

10:40.800 --> 10:45.920
They're just words to disguise the only thing he really respects, which is force.

10:45.920 --> 10:51.760
You know, do what we say or we'll shoot you dead and then declare ourselves heroes for it.

10:51.760 --> 10:54.800
It's hard to miss the white supremacist vibe here.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.640
And if you think that's a little too much,

10:56.640 --> 10:59.920
I'd like to point out that the first section of another of Crocker's books,

10:59.920 --> 11:05.520
The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Civil War, is titled Why the South Was Right.

11:05.520 --> 11:08.720
That book is glowing in its praise for the Confederate states,

11:09.280 --> 11:14.720
which, for anyone who doesn't know, fought a civil war against the United States

11:14.720 --> 11:17.440
because they wanted to uphold slavery.

11:17.440 --> 11:23.840
It consists of fawning profiles of southern generals and harsh criticisms of northern ones,

11:24.800 --> 11:30.320
very boring descriptions of battles, which is the worst sort of historical writing,

11:30.320 --> 11:32.720
and it ends with a bizarre bit of fan fiction

11:32.720 --> 11:36.640
talking about how great everything would have been if the South had won the war.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.480
Well, actually, it ultimately ends with these words,

11:40.480 --> 11:44.080
which were the national motto of the Confederate states,

11:44.080 --> 11:48.480
just in case there were any doubts as to where the author's sympathies lie there.

11:48.480 --> 11:52.960
Now, let me just say, I am fine being considered politically correct

11:53.040 --> 11:58.400
if that means thinking slavery and the mass murder of innocents is bad.

11:59.520 --> 12:02.080
By the way, I just thought I'd throw that out there.

12:02.080 --> 12:07.360
You know, if that's what being politically incorrect means, then count me out, you know?

12:08.080 --> 12:12.480
The British did not try to nation-build in the way we think of it now.

12:12.480 --> 12:17.120
They were under no illusions about making Arabs or Afghans or Zulus into Englishmen.

12:17.120 --> 12:23.600
They were more than content to leave people alone, to let them be themselves,

12:23.600 --> 12:26.400
to govern them with the lightest possible hand.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.960
So then, Ireland.

12:28.960 --> 12:31.040
Now, I've used this line of argument before,

12:31.040 --> 12:34.720
but I would really like to see this guy explain to the Irish

12:34.720 --> 12:40.400
that the British were content to leave people alone and let them be themselves.

12:40.400 --> 12:43.600
And there's too many things to even talk about here, of course.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.640
Cromwell's conquest of Ireland,

12:46.640 --> 12:49.440
the mismanagement of the response to the Great Famine,

12:49.440 --> 12:51.920
which led to mass starvation and emigration,

12:52.720 --> 12:55.920
the prohibition of the Irish language being taught in schools,

12:56.720 --> 12:59.200
Margaret Thatcher, generally.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.440
That was sort of a shared burden, that one, though.

13:03.440 --> 13:07.920
And all the problems with the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland

13:07.920 --> 13:13.200
that are currently still now ongoing, thanks to Brexit.

13:13.280 --> 13:15.520
But hold on there a second, Sean.

13:15.520 --> 13:20.480
Say, all ten of you diligent folks who actually go and watch the other video when I suggest it,

13:21.200 --> 13:24.080
PragerU's video actually references Ireland

13:24.080 --> 13:29.840
in the single instance of admitting that the British Empire was not completely perfect.

13:29.840 --> 13:30.640
Let's have a watch.

13:31.200 --> 13:34.960
Even where the British have merited criticism, as in Ireland,

13:35.520 --> 13:37.360
there is more to the Imperial story.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.200
During negotiations to create the Irish Republic, for instance,

13:41.680 --> 13:45.520
British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, who could speak Welsh,

13:45.520 --> 13:50.080
reminded the Irish nationalist and Gaelic extremist Eamon de Valera

13:50.080 --> 13:53.200
that the Celts never had a word for Republic.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.720
It was an idea given to them by the English.

13:57.680 --> 14:00.000
So, what was that?

14:00.560 --> 14:05.040
Crocker admits that the Empire merited criticism in Ireland,

14:05.040 --> 14:06.720
which is putting it rather lightly,

14:06.800 --> 14:08.320
but as a counterargument,

14:08.320 --> 14:12.720
quotes David Lloyd George talking about the origin of the word Republic,

14:13.760 --> 14:17.040
which has nothing to do with anything.

14:17.040 --> 14:19.600
You know, not only is it completely disconnected

14:19.600 --> 14:23.200
from any of the criticisms that the British Empire merited,

14:23.200 --> 14:24.640
it's a misquote.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.840
Now, there are different accounts of this particular conversation,

14:27.840 --> 14:34.160
but none of them are so ludicrous as to credit the English with the concept of the Republic.

14:34.160 --> 14:36.640
That's from the Latin, you know.

14:36.640 --> 14:40.960
As is this Irish word, which has its roots in populace there,

14:40.960 --> 14:45.920
which was one of two competing Irish translations of the word Republic at the time.

14:46.640 --> 14:48.880
Not that any of this matters, of course.

14:48.880 --> 14:54.240
What a really bizarre way to avoid actually mentioning any of the crimes of the Empire.

14:54.880 --> 14:55.840
Never fear, though.

14:55.840 --> 14:58.960
If we want to see exactly what Crocker thinks about the Irish,

14:58.960 --> 15:04.000
we can just once again take a peek at his politically incorrect guide to the British Empire.

15:04.320 --> 15:08.560
Where we see him talking about Ireland's recidivist barbarisms.

15:08.560 --> 15:09.280
He says,

15:09.280 --> 15:11.600
"...there is much to admire about the Irish,

15:11.600 --> 15:16.960
but it is also easy to see why the English, when not regarding them as comical,

15:16.960 --> 15:22.640
tended to see them as shiftless, ignorant, stubborn, concimacious, and cruel."

15:22.640 --> 15:24.080
Crocker concludes that,

15:24.080 --> 15:29.280
"...the English left Ireland language, laws, and parliamentary government,

15:29.280 --> 15:33.760
but did nothing to tame the stubborn pugnacity of Ireland's Celts."

15:34.640 --> 15:35.360
Jeez.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.040
Left Ireland language.

15:37.760 --> 15:40.640
It already had a language, honestly.

15:40.640 --> 15:44.320
If you had to guess when this racist drivel was written,

15:44.320 --> 15:47.760
you'd guess, like, 1910 or something, wouldn't you?

15:47.760 --> 15:51.200
Not 2011, which is when it actually was released.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.240
Now, not mentioned in the PragerU video, of course,

15:54.240 --> 15:56.960
are any of the Empire's various other crimes,

15:56.960 --> 16:00.160
which, again, are too numerous to mention here.

16:00.160 --> 16:04.000
There's nothing about the Empire's use of concentration camps in Africa.

16:04.080 --> 16:08.880
It's massacres of indigenous Australians overseeing a famine in India

16:08.880 --> 16:12.800
that killed and displaced millions of people during the Second World War.

16:12.800 --> 16:16.960
Though I'm sure Crocker could find someone loosely associated with each of those events

16:16.960 --> 16:20.480
who had once said the word republic or liberty or something.

16:21.040 --> 16:23.200
You know, don't look at all the bodies,

16:23.200 --> 16:26.480
just say words like freedom and liberty over and over.

16:26.480 --> 16:29.760
Now, I earlier said that those words were being used meaninglessly,

16:29.760 --> 16:31.040
and just to back that up a bit,

16:31.040 --> 16:35.680
I'd like to quote again from Crocker's politically incorrect guide to the Civil War.

16:35.680 --> 16:36.320
He says,

16:36.320 --> 16:39.120
"...the Confederate States of America, in short,

16:39.120 --> 16:41.840
had formed a republic with a limited government

16:41.840 --> 16:44.880
that guaranteed individual and state rights."

16:46.000 --> 16:47.920
Unless you were a slave, of course.

16:47.920 --> 16:49.840
"...and unlike the republic up north,

16:49.840 --> 16:54.720
didn't insist on subjugating states that didn't want to be a part of it.

16:54.720 --> 16:59.280
The Confederacy might have had slavery, as the United States did,

16:59.280 --> 17:00.880
but it was no tyranny."

17:02.000 --> 17:03.840
Again, unless you were a slave.

17:04.400 --> 17:09.360
Now, the United States of America is presented throughout this book as the aggressor,

17:09.360 --> 17:14.400
as denying the southern states their inalienable rights to own other people.

17:14.400 --> 17:19.040
You know, as being anti all those good words like liberty and freedom and so on.

17:19.040 --> 17:22.080
Crocker's allegiances will change with the conflict.

17:22.080 --> 17:25.520
He'll sing the praises of the United States in the PragerU video,

17:25.520 --> 17:30.720
whereas in his books he writes fanfiction about it being defeated and conquered by an enemy.

17:30.720 --> 17:34.960
It's a bizarre trend among people who claim to love Western civilization

17:34.960 --> 17:38.000
to find themselves praising its greatest enemies.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.880
For instance, new PragerU collaborator Candace Owens recently got herself in some hot water

17:42.880 --> 17:48.960
for claiming that Hitler would have been fine if he kept his ambitions inside Germany.

17:48.960 --> 17:54.720
Now, I'd like to close out today by asking who on earth this video was made for.

17:54.800 --> 18:01.440
You know, anyone in or near a former British colony will immediately recognize it as bullshit.

18:01.440 --> 18:07.440
Maybe it was made for Americans who don't know about the Revolutionary War, I guess.

18:08.480 --> 18:13.360
British nationalists who refuse to admit the empire wasn't purely altruistic.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.240
Maybe just the far right in general.

18:16.960 --> 18:18.560
I don't know, genuinely.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.400
Let me know what you think in the comments.

18:21.360 --> 18:25.680
Maybe it was made for the world's worst homeschooling teachers.

18:25.680 --> 18:29.760
You see, this one has a study guide with questions to answer afterwards as well.

18:30.480 --> 18:33.920
The British were more than content to leave people alone,

18:33.920 --> 18:38.640
to let them be themselves, to govern them with the lightest possible hand.

18:39.280 --> 18:40.640
True, false.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.040
It's fucking ridiculous.

18:44.320 --> 18:46.160
That's all from me today, folks.

18:46.160 --> 18:48.640
Sorry to go back to the PragerU well so soon,

18:48.640 --> 18:51.440
but I saw this video and how many views it had,

18:51.440 --> 18:54.400
and had to start typing a response immediately.

18:54.960 --> 18:58.640
Thanks, as always, to all of my patrons who support me over on Patreon,

18:58.640 --> 19:01.760
whose wonderful names should be on the screen right now.

19:01.760 --> 19:04.080
If you'd like to join them in supporting the channel,

19:04.080 --> 19:07.440
click that Patreon link below the video and go check it out.

19:07.440 --> 19:10.800
I'll also include links to my Twitter and CuriousCat pages

19:10.800 --> 19:13.840
if you fancy giving me a follow or asking me a question.

19:13.840 --> 19:16.640
Also, a quick behind-the-scenes note here.

19:16.640 --> 19:21.360
We're coming up on 200,000 subscribers, which is very exciting.

19:21.920 --> 19:24.880
We'll probably pass that within a couple of days, actually,

19:24.880 --> 19:28.480
and I'll be putting out a quick Q&A video sometime soon to celebrate,

19:28.480 --> 19:30.080
so look forward to that.

19:30.640 --> 19:33.120
Right, thanks folks, and I'll see you next time.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.360
More like crock of shit.

19:39.360 --> 19:40.080
Thank you.
