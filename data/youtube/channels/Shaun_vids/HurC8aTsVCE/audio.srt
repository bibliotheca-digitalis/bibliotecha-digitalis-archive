00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Hello, everyone. This is a video responding to a Prager University video titled

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,000
If You Live in Freedom, Thank the British Empire,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,640
hosted on the PragerU YouTube channel, currently with about one million views.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,160
The video is narrated by H. W. Crocker III,

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,040
described by PragerU as a military historian and best-selling author.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,320
So a few months ago, I made a video about PragerU titled How PragerU Lies to You,

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,560
where I put forward the radical, shocking idea that Prager University isn't actually a university,

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,640
but is instead a YouTube channel funded by fossil fuel billionaires

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,520
with the aim of promoting a biased and factually incorrect far-right worldview.

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,800
All of which, I think you'll find, is undeniably true and beyond dispute.

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,080
Now, in that video, I mentioned that there were a few PragerU courses,

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,600
and remember, by courses, I mean YouTube videos, that were worthy of a more in-depth look.

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,480
And so I've decided to take a peek at what is probably the worst of the bunch today.

14
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,680
In fact, it is to me the most blatant propaganda PragerU have ever published.

15
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,760
Before we get to it, though, I should mention that there are several other YouTube channels

16
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,320
who have produced their own responses to this video,

17
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,280
which you'll find if you do a YouTube search for PragerU British Empire Response.

18
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,080
Now, usually, seeing this sort of thing dissuades me from making my own video on the subject,

19
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,720
as I consider the topic covered ground.

20
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,640
But with this video, I just couldn't help getting in on the action myself.

21
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,320
It is just that bad.

22
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,600
As always, I'd recommend that you watch PragerU's video first,

23
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,400
so you can be sure I'm not misrepresenting them,

24
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,360
although I will be showing short clips here as I go.

25
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,920
Right then, let's get to it.

26
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,360
Freedom was an Englishman's right, and wherever he went, he took that right with him.

27
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,400
Whether he was an English colonist in America,

28
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,360
governing himself through a locally elected assembly...

29
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,840
Okay, so I'll have to stop it there.

30
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,640
That was quick. Doesn't bode well, does it?

31
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,680
Now, I have to ask if this guy, H. W. Crocker, knows about the American Revolutionary War.

32
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,320
And I ask this not just because of that brief clip describing the American colonists

33
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,960
enjoying all that freedom they had, but also because of this later clip.

34
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:43,600
So the United States should thank the great,

35
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,720
liberty-loving empire that gave it its sense of inalienable rights.

36
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,760
Now, nowhere in this video has it ever mentioned how the United States came to be,

37
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,480
or that they fought a war against that great, liberty-loving empire

38
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,280
in order to be free of its control.

39
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,000
I mean, that doesn't really make any sense, does it?

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,040
If your only information about the United States or the British Empire came from this video,

41
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,720
you would conclude that the British Empire peacefully passed the freedom baton to the United States,

42
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,040
appointing them the new defenders of justice and freedom and liberty,

43
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,360
and all the other words that are used completely meaninglessly.

44
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,400
The British always thought of themselves as liberators, as bringers of freedom.

45
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,440
The British believed the final and necessary justification of their empire was a moral one.

46
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,400
Now, here I'm afraid Mr. Crocker has fallen, perhaps deliberately,

47
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,520
for some very out-of-date propaganda there.

48
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,840
Claiming not to be conquerors or invaders, but actually liberators,

49
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,920
has been a tactic of aggressors all through human history.

50
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,920
The Roman Empire, for instance, disguised various aggressive campaigns as merely acts of defense.

51
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,960
They exaggerated minor threats to justify overwhelming force, and so on.

52
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,520
Even Nazi Germany claimed to be acting in self-defense when they invaded Poland,

53
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:13,520
staging a series of false flag attacks carried out by the SS in what was called Operation Himmler.

54
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,760
Hitler declared in response to the attacks that he faked

55
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:25,440
that he was mobilizing his defense forces until the safety of the Reich and its rights are secured.

56
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,760
The British Empire may have claimed at times to be liberating and freeing people,

57
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,880
but that was just a smokescreen for its real aims.

58
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:40,640
Territorial expansion, access to resources, power, glory, all the usual rubbish.

59
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,760
I'd advise looking into the events preceding the 1879 Anglo-Zulu War,

60
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,720
fought between the British Empire and the Zulu Kingdom,

61
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,000
if you'd like a handy example of the British Empire's use of extremely flimsy pretexts

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,240
for provoking and justifying wars with people it was just invading.

63
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,120
Speaking of flimsy pretexts, how's that for a link there?

64
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,520
Even Gandhi praised the British Empire, paraphrasing Jefferson,

65
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,520
saying that he believed that the best government was the government that governed least,

66
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,040
and that he found that the British Empire guaranteed his freedom and governed him least of all.

67
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,760
Now, this is really amazing, this bit.

68
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,440
I think it's probably the slimiest, most deceptive argument PragerU has ever uploaded,

69
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,000
and that's a field with some pretty stiff competition.

70
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,320
So, what's wrong with this quote?

71
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,080
Did Gandhi say this?

72
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,080
Well, kind of.

73
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,160
This quote is actually a paraphrase,

74
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,160
and I consider the tactic of writing it alongside a little cartoon Gandhi,

75
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,960
as if he said those exact words, to be rather shady, to say the least.

76
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,880
However, he did express that sentiment in 1915,

77
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,080
as quoted in the speeches and writings of M.K. Gandhi, published in 1922.

78
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,880
Now, in the West, if Gandhi is known for anything,

79
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,280
it's being a proponent of non-violent resistance to the British rule of India.

80
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,240
So, why would Gandhi, who thought that the British Empire was the best government ever,

81
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,640
according to this PragerU video, at least,

82
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:14,720
also be leading a resistance movement against it and asking that it leave India?

83
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,880
What a puzzle we have here.

84
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,800
Now, that quote from the PragerU video is from 1915.

85
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,280
As I said, however, their little cartoon there is actually traced from a photograph

86
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,200
of Gandhi outside Downing Street 15 years later,

87
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,280
which is a little deceptive there.

88
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,640
What could have happened in those intervening 15 years?

89
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,440
Anything that could have perhaps altered

90
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,800
Gandhi's appraisal of the British Empire's governing abilities?

91
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,800
Well, we'll see.

92
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,560
A content warning for particularly nasty descriptions of violence in this next section, folks.

93
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,480
And we'll start with the Rowlett Act,

94
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,440
otherwise known as the Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act of 1919,

95
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,000
which was a legislative act passed by the Imperial Legislative Council in Delhi

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,240
on the 10th of March 1919,

97
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,360
indefinitely extending the emergency measures of preventative indefinite detention,

98
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,720
incarceration without trial and judicial review,

99
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,360
enacted in the Defense of India Act 1915 during the First World War.

100
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,040
To quote Wikipedia there,

101
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,600
indefinite detention without trial.

102
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,120
That's the great liberty-loving empire at work there.

103
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,960
Now, Gandhi responded to the passing of the Rowlett Act

104
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,160
by promoting nonviolent civil disobedience,

105
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,640
an act for which he himself was arrested.

106
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,240
Gandhi's later resistance against the British Empire,

107
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,120
the Salt March, the Quit India movement, and so on,

108
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,120
are a little beyond the scope of my video,

109
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,600
so right now we'll limit ourselves to this one particularly horrible event.

110
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,480
So, on the 13th of April 1919,

111
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,800
thousands of civilians gathered at a public garden in Amritsar

112
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,520
to celebrate the Punjabi New Year Festival,

113
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,760
as well as to protest the recent actions of the British Imperial government,

114
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,080
including the passing of the Rowlett Act.

115
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,520
Fearful of a rebellion,

116
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,560
Colonel Reginald Dyer of the British Army ordered the main exits of the garden blocked,

117
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,960
then ordered his troops to open fire without warning on the group of civilians.

118
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,200
He later explained his actions were not to disperse the meeting,

119
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,240
but to punish the Indians for disobedience.

120
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,600
British Indian sources gave a figure of 379 dead with more than a thousand wounded,

121
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,920
whereas the Indian National Congress estimated

122
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,560
that around a thousand people were killed in the massacre.

123
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,200
That's just one of the British Empire's terrible,

124
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,920
violent massacres of innocent people there,

125
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,960
none of which are mentioned in the PragerU video,

126
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,360
and we have to wonder, why not?

127
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,920
Well, not really.

128
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,240
It's because they're shameless propagandists

129
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,680
presenting a biased, one-sided view of history.

130
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,640
PragerU takes the approach of sticking their head in the sand

131
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,440
and pretending such events never took place,

132
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,920
so who knows what they think about it.

133
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,800
However, we do know what this guy in particular, Crocker, thinks about the incident,

134
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,640
as he describes it in his book,

135
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,920
The Politically Incorrect Guide to the British Empire.

136
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,600
And I'd like to note the Free Cheers for Colonialism tagline there.

137
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,720
Also, I'd like to note that his Gandhi-praised to the British Empire non-point

138
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,240
takes top billing among a list of similarly silly ideas.

139
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,920
Anyway, here's how Crocker introduces Daya, the colonel who ordered the massacre.

140
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,800
Daya was a hero of the old school.

141
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,600
He had been born in India and spent his childhood there

142
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,400
before being educated in Ireland and at Sandhurst.

143
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,680
He had a gallant record that extended from service in the northwest frontier to Burma.

144
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,120
Most of all, he was a man who stood by the British imperial principles of justice,

145
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,240
fair play, and decency delivered by force if necessary.

146
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,760
Jesus.

147
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,400
On the massacre, Crocker writes,

148
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,480
Daya ordered his men into line and without delay gave the order to fire.

149
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,880
379 Indians were killed and more than a thousand were wounded.

150
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,600
The mob was dispersed and so was the feared rebellion in the Punjab.

151
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,720
Daya became a hate figure to anti-colonialists.

152
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,800
Imagine that.

153
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,120
And was repudiated by liberal opinion and the British government at home.

154
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,480
And for what? Just for murdering a bunch of people.

155
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,360
Jeez.

156
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,440
Crocker, PragerU's lecturer, is here justifying the deliberate massacre of unarmed civilians

157
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,040
and calling the man who ordered that massacre a hero.

158
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,840
And that's a direct quote. That is his own word.

159
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,800
We see what he really thinks of liberty and justice and freedom here.

160
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,920
They're just words to disguise the only thing he really respects, which is force.

161
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,760
You know, do what we say or we'll shoot you dead and then declare ourselves heroes for it.

162
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,800
It's hard to miss the white supremacist vibe here.

163
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,640
And if you think that's a little too much,

164
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,920
I'd like to point out that the first section of another of Crocker's books,

165
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,520
The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Civil War, is titled Why the South Was Right.

166
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,720
That book is glowing in its praise for the Confederate states,

167
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,720
which, for anyone who doesn't know, fought a civil war against the United States

168
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,440
because they wanted to uphold slavery.

169
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,840
It consists of fawning profiles of southern generals and harsh criticisms of northern ones,

170
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,320
very boring descriptions of battles, which is the worst sort of historical writing,

171
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,720
and it ends with a bizarre bit of fan fiction

172
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,640
talking about how great everything would have been if the South had won the war.

173
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,480
Well, actually, it ultimately ends with these words,

174
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,080
which were the national motto of the Confederate states,

175
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,480
just in case there were any doubts as to where the author's sympathies lie there.

176
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,960
Now, let me just say, I am fine being considered politically correct

177
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,400
if that means thinking slavery and the mass murder of innocents is bad.

178
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,080
By the way, I just thought I'd throw that out there.

179
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,360
You know, if that's what being politically incorrect means, then count me out, you know?

180
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,480
The British did not try to nation-build in the way we think of it now.

181
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,120
They were under no illusions about making Arabs or Afghans or Zulus into Englishmen.

182
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,600
They were more than content to leave people alone, to let them be themselves,

183
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,400
to govern them with the lightest possible hand.

184
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,960
So then, Ireland.

185
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,040
Now, I've used this line of argument before,

186
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,720
but I would really like to see this guy explain to the Irish

187
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,400
that the British were content to leave people alone and let them be themselves.

188
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,600
And there's too many things to even talk about here, of course.

189
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,640
Cromwell's conquest of Ireland,

190
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,440
the mismanagement of the response to the Great Famine,

191
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,920
which led to mass starvation and emigration,

192
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,920
the prohibition of the Irish language being taught in schools,

193
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,200
Margaret Thatcher, generally.

194
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,440
That was sort of a shared burden, that one, though.

195
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,920
And all the problems with the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland

196
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,200
that are currently still now ongoing, thanks to Brexit.

197
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,520
But hold on there a second, Sean.

198
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,480
Say, all ten of you diligent folks who actually go and watch the other video when I suggest it,

199
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,080
PragerU's video actually references Ireland

200
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:29,840
in the single instance of admitting that the British Empire was not completely perfect.

201
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,640
Let's have a watch.

202
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,960
Even where the British have merited criticism, as in Ireland,

203
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,360
there is more to the Imperial story.

204
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,200
During negotiations to create the Irish Republic, for instance,

205
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,520
British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, who could speak Welsh,

206
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,080
reminded the Irish nationalist and Gaelic extremist Eamon de Valera

207
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,200
that the Celts never had a word for Republic.

208
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,720
It was an idea given to them by the English.

209
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,000
So, what was that?

210
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,040
Crocker admits that the Empire merited criticism in Ireland,

211
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,720
which is putting it rather lightly,

212
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,320
but as a counterargument,

213
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,720
quotes David Lloyd George talking about the origin of the word Republic,

214
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,040
which has nothing to do with anything.

215
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,600
You know, not only is it completely disconnected

216
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,200
from any of the criticisms that the British Empire merited,

217
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,640
it's a misquote.

218
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,840
Now, there are different accounts of this particular conversation,

219
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:34,160
but none of them are so ludicrous as to credit the English with the concept of the Republic.

220
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,640
That's from the Latin, you know.

221
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,960
As is this Irish word, which has its roots in populace there,

222
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,920
which was one of two competing Irish translations of the word Republic at the time.

223
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,880
Not that any of this matters, of course.

224
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,240
What a really bizarre way to avoid actually mentioning any of the crimes of the Empire.

225
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,840
Never fear, though.

226
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,960
If we want to see exactly what Crocker thinks about the Irish,

227
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:04,000
we can just once again take a peek at his politically incorrect guide to the British Empire.

228
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,560
Where we see him talking about Ireland's recidivist barbarisms.

229
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,280
He says,

230
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,600
"...there is much to admire about the Irish,

231
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,960
but it is also easy to see why the English, when not regarding them as comical,

232
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:22,640
tended to see them as shiftless, ignorant, stubborn, concimacious, and cruel."

233
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,080
Crocker concludes that,

234
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:29,280
"...the English left Ireland language, laws, and parliamentary government,

235
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,760
but did nothing to tame the stubborn pugnacity of Ireland's Celts."

236
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,360
Jeez.

237
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,040
Left Ireland language.

238
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,640
It already had a language, honestly.

239
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,320
If you had to guess when this racist drivel was written,

240
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,760
you'd guess, like, 1910 or something, wouldn't you?

241
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,200
Not 2011, which is when it actually was released.

242
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,240
Now, not mentioned in the PragerU video, of course,

243
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,960
are any of the Empire's various other crimes,

244
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,160
which, again, are too numerous to mention here.

245
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,000
There's nothing about the Empire's use of concentration camps in Africa.

246
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,880
It's massacres of indigenous Australians overseeing a famine in India

247
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,800
that killed and displaced millions of people during the Second World War.

248
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,960
Though I'm sure Crocker could find someone loosely associated with each of those events

249
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,480
who had once said the word republic or liberty or something.

250
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,200
You know, don't look at all the bodies,

251
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,480
just say words like freedom and liberty over and over.

252
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,760
Now, I earlier said that those words were being used meaninglessly,

253
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,040
and just to back that up a bit,

254
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,680
I'd like to quote again from Crocker's politically incorrect guide to the Civil War.

255
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,320
He says,

256
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,120
"...the Confederate States of America, in short,

257
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,840
had formed a republic with a limited government

258
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,880
that guaranteed individual and state rights."

259
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,920
Unless you were a slave, of course.

260
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,840
"...and unlike the republic up north,

261
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,720
didn't insist on subjugating states that didn't want to be a part of it.

262
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,280
The Confederacy might have had slavery, as the United States did,

263
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,880
but it was no tyranny."

264
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,840
Again, unless you were a slave.

265
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,360
Now, the United States of America is presented throughout this book as the aggressor,

266
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,400
as denying the southern states their inalienable rights to own other people.

267
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,040
You know, as being anti all those good words like liberty and freedom and so on.

268
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,080
Crocker's allegiances will change with the conflict.

269
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,520
He'll sing the praises of the United States in the PragerU video,

270
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,720
whereas in his books he writes fanfiction about it being defeated and conquered by an enemy.

271
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,960
It's a bizarre trend among people who claim to love Western civilization

272
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,000
to find themselves praising its greatest enemies.

273
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,880
For instance, new PragerU collaborator Candace Owens recently got herself in some hot water

274
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,960
for claiming that Hitler would have been fine if he kept his ambitions inside Germany.

275
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,720
Now, I'd like to close out today by asking who on earth this video was made for.

276
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:01,440
You know, anyone in or near a former British colony will immediately recognize it as bullshit.

277
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,440
Maybe it was made for Americans who don't know about the Revolutionary War, I guess.

278
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,360
British nationalists who refuse to admit the empire wasn't purely altruistic.

279
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,240
Maybe just the far right in general.

280
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,560
I don't know, genuinely.

281
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,400
Let me know what you think in the comments.

282
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,680
Maybe it was made for the world's worst homeschooling teachers.

283
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,760
You see, this one has a study guide with questions to answer afterwards as well.

284
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,920
The British were more than content to leave people alone,

285
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,640
to let them be themselves, to govern them with the lightest possible hand.

286
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,640
True, false.

287
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,040
It's fucking ridiculous.

288
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,160
That's all from me today, folks.

289
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,640
Sorry to go back to the PragerU well so soon,

290
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,440
but I saw this video and how many views it had,

291
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,400
and had to start typing a response immediately.

292
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,640
Thanks, as always, to all of my patrons who support me over on Patreon,

293
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,760
whose wonderful names should be on the screen right now.

294
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,080
If you'd like to join them in supporting the channel,

295
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,440
click that Patreon link below the video and go check it out.

296
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,800
I'll also include links to my Twitter and CuriousCat pages

297
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,840
if you fancy giving me a follow or asking me a question.

298
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,640
Also, a quick behind-the-scenes note here.

299
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,360
We're coming up on 200,000 subscribers, which is very exciting.

300
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,880
We'll probably pass that within a couple of days, actually,

301
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,480
and I'll be putting out a quick Q&A video sometime soon to celebrate,

302
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,080
so look forward to that.

303
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,120
Right, thanks folks, and I'll see you next time.

304
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,360
More like crock of shit.

305
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,080
Thank you.
