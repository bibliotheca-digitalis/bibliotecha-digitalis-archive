0	5040	Hello, everyone. This is a video responding to a Prager University video titled
5040	8000	If You Live in Freedom, Thank the British Empire,
8000	12640	hosted on the PragerU YouTube channel, currently with about one million views.
12640	16160	The video is narrated by H. W. Crocker III,
16160	21040	described by PragerU as a military historian and best-selling author.
21040	26320	So a few months ago, I made a video about PragerU titled How PragerU Lies to You,
26320	32560	where I put forward the radical, shocking idea that Prager University isn't actually a university,
32560	36640	but is instead a YouTube channel funded by fossil fuel billionaires
36640	41520	with the aim of promoting a biased and factually incorrect far-right worldview.
42160	46800	All of which, I think you'll find, is undeniably true and beyond dispute.
47440	52080	Now, in that video, I mentioned that there were a few PragerU courses,
52080	57600	and remember, by courses, I mean YouTube videos, that were worthy of a more in-depth look.
57600	62480	And so I've decided to take a peek at what is probably the worst of the bunch today.
62480	67680	In fact, it is to me the most blatant propaganda PragerU have ever published.
67680	71760	Before we get to it, though, I should mention that there are several other YouTube channels
71760	74320	who have produced their own responses to this video,
74320	79280	which you'll find if you do a YouTube search for PragerU British Empire Response.
79280	84080	Now, usually, seeing this sort of thing dissuades me from making my own video on the subject,
84080	86720	as I consider the topic covered ground.
86720	90640	But with this video, I just couldn't help getting in on the action myself.
90640	92320	It is just that bad.
92320	95600	As always, I'd recommend that you watch PragerU's video first,
95600	98400	so you can be sure I'm not misrepresenting them,
98400	101360	although I will be showing short clips here as I go.
102080	103920	Right then, let's get to it.
103920	109360	Freedom was an Englishman's right, and wherever he went, he took that right with him.
109360	112400	Whether he was an English colonist in America,
112400	115360	governing himself through a locally elected assembly...
115360	117840	Okay, so I'll have to stop it there.
117840	120640	That was quick. Doesn't bode well, does it?
120640	127680	Now, I have to ask if this guy, H. W. Crocker, knows about the American Revolutionary War.
127680	132320	And I ask this not just because of that brief clip describing the American colonists
132320	136960	enjoying all that freedom they had, but also because of this later clip.
136960	163600	So the United States should thank the great,
163600	168720	liberty-loving empire that gave it its sense of inalienable rights.
168720	173760	Now, nowhere in this video has it ever mentioned how the United States came to be,
173760	178480	or that they fought a war against that great, liberty-loving empire
178480	181280	in order to be free of its control.
181280	184000	I mean, that doesn't really make any sense, does it?
184000	189040	If your only information about the United States or the British Empire came from this video,
189120	194720	you would conclude that the British Empire peacefully passed the freedom baton to the United States,
194720	199040	appointing them the new defenders of justice and freedom and liberty,
199040	203360	and all the other words that are used completely meaninglessly.
203360	208400	The British always thought of themselves as liberators, as bringers of freedom.
209360	215440	The British believed the final and necessary justification of their empire was a moral one.
215440	220400	Now, here I'm afraid Mr. Crocker has fallen, perhaps deliberately,
220400	223520	for some very out-of-date propaganda there.
223520	227840	Claiming not to be conquerors or invaders, but actually liberators,
227840	231920	has been a tactic of aggressors all through human history.
231920	237920	The Roman Empire, for instance, disguised various aggressive campaigns as merely acts of defense.
237920	242960	They exaggerated minor threats to justify overwhelming force, and so on.
242960	247520	Even Nazi Germany claimed to be acting in self-defense when they invaded Poland,
247520	253520	staging a series of false flag attacks carried out by the SS in what was called Operation Himmler.
253520	257760	Hitler declared in response to the attacks that he faked
257760	265440	that he was mobilizing his defense forces until the safety of the Reich and its rights are secured.
265440	269760	The British Empire may have claimed at times to be liberating and freeing people,
269760	272880	but that was just a smokescreen for its real aims.
272960	280640	Territorial expansion, access to resources, power, glory, all the usual rubbish.
280640	285760	I'd advise looking into the events preceding the 1879 Anglo-Zulu War,
285760	288720	fought between the British Empire and the Zulu Kingdom,
288720	294000	if you'd like a handy example of the British Empire's use of extremely flimsy pretexts
294000	298240	for provoking and justifying wars with people it was just invading.
298880	303120	Speaking of flimsy pretexts, how's that for a link there?
303120	307520	Even Gandhi praised the British Empire, paraphrasing Jefferson,
307520	311520	saying that he believed that the best government was the government that governed least,
311520	317040	and that he found that the British Empire guaranteed his freedom and governed him least of all.
317680	319760	Now, this is really amazing, this bit.
319760	325440	I think it's probably the slimiest, most deceptive argument PragerU has ever uploaded,
325440	328000	and that's a field with some pretty stiff competition.
328080	330320	So, what's wrong with this quote?
330320	332080	Did Gandhi say this?
332080	334080	Well, kind of.
334080	336160	This quote is actually a paraphrase,
336160	340160	and I consider the tactic of writing it alongside a little cartoon Gandhi,
340160	344960	as if he said those exact words, to be rather shady, to say the least.
344960	348880	However, he did express that sentiment in 1915,
348880	354080	as quoted in the speeches and writings of M.K. Gandhi, published in 1922.
354080	356880	Now, in the West, if Gandhi is known for anything,
356880	361280	it's being a proponent of non-violent resistance to the British rule of India.
361280	366240	So, why would Gandhi, who thought that the British Empire was the best government ever,
366240	368640	according to this PragerU video, at least,
368640	374720	also be leading a resistance movement against it and asking that it leave India?
374720	376880	What a puzzle we have here.
376880	380800	Now, that quote from the PragerU video is from 1915.
380800	385280	As I said, however, their little cartoon there is actually traced from a photograph
385280	389200	of Gandhi outside Downing Street 15 years later,
389200	391280	which is a little deceptive there.
391280	394640	What could have happened in those intervening 15 years?
395280	397440	Anything that could have perhaps altered
397440	400800	Gandhi's appraisal of the British Empire's governing abilities?
401440	402800	Well, we'll see.
402800	408560	A content warning for particularly nasty descriptions of violence in this next section, folks.
408560	410480	And we'll start with the Rowlett Act,
410480	415440	otherwise known as the Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act of 1919,
415440	420000	which was a legislative act passed by the Imperial Legislative Council in Delhi
420000	422240	on the 10th of March 1919,
422240	427360	indefinitely extending the emergency measures of preventative indefinite detention,
427360	430720	incarceration without trial and judicial review,
430720	435360	enacted in the Defense of India Act 1915 during the First World War.
435360	437040	To quote Wikipedia there,
437040	439600	indefinite detention without trial.
439600	443120	That's the great liberty-loving empire at work there.
443760	446960	Now, Gandhi responded to the passing of the Rowlett Act
446960	450160	by promoting nonviolent civil disobedience,
450160	452640	an act for which he himself was arrested.
453360	456240	Gandhi's later resistance against the British Empire,
456240	459120	the Salt March, the Quit India movement, and so on,
459120	461120	are a little beyond the scope of my video,
461120	465600	so right now we'll limit ourselves to this one particularly horrible event.
465680	468480	So, on the 13th of April 1919,
468480	472800	thousands of civilians gathered at a public garden in Amritsar
472800	475520	to celebrate the Punjabi New Year Festival,
475520	479760	as well as to protest the recent actions of the British Imperial government,
479760	482080	including the passing of the Rowlett Act.
482080	483520	Fearful of a rebellion,
483520	488560	Colonel Reginald Dyer of the British Army ordered the main exits of the garden blocked,
488560	492960	then ordered his troops to open fire without warning on the group of civilians.
493520	497200	He later explained his actions were not to disperse the meeting,
497200	500240	but to punish the Indians for disobedience.
500240	505600	British Indian sources gave a figure of 379 dead with more than a thousand wounded,
505600	507920	whereas the Indian National Congress estimated
507920	510560	that around a thousand people were killed in the massacre.
510560	513200	That's just one of the British Empire's terrible,
513200	515920	violent massacres of innocent people there,
515920	518960	none of which are mentioned in the PragerU video,
518960	521360	and we have to wonder, why not?
522240	523920	Well, not really.
523920	526240	It's because they're shameless propagandists
526240	529680	presenting a biased, one-sided view of history.
529680	532640	PragerU takes the approach of sticking their head in the sand
532640	535440	and pretending such events never took place,
535440	537920	so who knows what they think about it.
537920	542800	However, we do know what this guy in particular, Crocker, thinks about the incident,
542800	544640	as he describes it in his book,
544640	547920	The Politically Incorrect Guide to the British Empire.
548800	553600	And I'd like to note the Free Cheers for Colonialism tagline there.
553600	558720	Also, I'd like to note that his Gandhi-praised to the British Empire non-point
558720	562240	takes top billing among a list of similarly silly ideas.
562880	567920	Anyway, here's how Crocker introduces Daya, the colonel who ordered the massacre.
567920	570800	Daya was a hero of the old school.
570800	573600	He had been born in India and spent his childhood there
573600	576400	before being educated in Ireland and at Sandhurst.
576400	581680	He had a gallant record that extended from service in the northwest frontier to Burma.
581680	587120	Most of all, he was a man who stood by the British imperial principles of justice,
587120	592240	fair play, and decency delivered by force if necessary.
593200	593760	Jesus.
594320	596400	On the massacre, Crocker writes,
596400	600480	Daya ordered his men into line and without delay gave the order to fire.
600480	604880	379 Indians were killed and more than a thousand were wounded.
604880	609600	The mob was dispersed and so was the feared rebellion in the Punjab.
609600	612720	Daya became a hate figure to anti-colonialists.
613600	614800	Imagine that.
614800	619120	And was repudiated by liberal opinion and the British government at home.
619120	622480	And for what? Just for murdering a bunch of people.
622480	623360	Jeez.
623360	629440	Crocker, PragerU's lecturer, is here justifying the deliberate massacre of unarmed civilians
629440	633040	and calling the man who ordered that massacre a hero.
633040	635840	And that's a direct quote. That is his own word.
636400	640800	We see what he really thinks of liberty and justice and freedom here.
640800	645920	They're just words to disguise the only thing he really respects, which is force.
645920	651760	You know, do what we say or we'll shoot you dead and then declare ourselves heroes for it.
651760	654800	It's hard to miss the white supremacist vibe here.
654800	656640	And if you think that's a little too much,
656640	659920	I'd like to point out that the first section of another of Crocker's books,
659920	665520	The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Civil War, is titled Why the South Was Right.
665520	668720	That book is glowing in its praise for the Confederate states,
669280	674720	which, for anyone who doesn't know, fought a civil war against the United States
674720	677440	because they wanted to uphold slavery.
677440	683840	It consists of fawning profiles of southern generals and harsh criticisms of northern ones,
684800	690320	very boring descriptions of battles, which is the worst sort of historical writing,
690320	692720	and it ends with a bizarre bit of fan fiction
692720	696640	talking about how great everything would have been if the South had won the war.
697280	700480	Well, actually, it ultimately ends with these words,
700480	704080	which were the national motto of the Confederate states,
704080	708480	just in case there were any doubts as to where the author's sympathies lie there.
708480	712960	Now, let me just say, I am fine being considered politically correct
713040	718400	if that means thinking slavery and the mass murder of innocents is bad.
719520	722080	By the way, I just thought I'd throw that out there.
722080	727360	You know, if that's what being politically incorrect means, then count me out, you know?
728080	732480	The British did not try to nation-build in the way we think of it now.
732480	737120	They were under no illusions about making Arabs or Afghans or Zulus into Englishmen.
737120	743600	They were more than content to leave people alone, to let them be themselves,
743600	746400	to govern them with the lightest possible hand.
746960	748960	So then, Ireland.
748960	751040	Now, I've used this line of argument before,
751040	754720	but I would really like to see this guy explain to the Irish
754720	760400	that the British were content to leave people alone and let them be themselves.
760400	763600	And there's too many things to even talk about here, of course.
764240	766640	Cromwell's conquest of Ireland,
766640	769440	the mismanagement of the response to the Great Famine,
769440	771920	which led to mass starvation and emigration,
772720	775920	the prohibition of the Irish language being taught in schools,
776720	779200	Margaret Thatcher, generally.
780000	783440	That was sort of a shared burden, that one, though.
783440	787920	And all the problems with the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland
787920	793200	that are currently still now ongoing, thanks to Brexit.
793280	795520	But hold on there a second, Sean.
795520	800480	Say, all ten of you diligent folks who actually go and watch the other video when I suggest it,
801200	804080	PragerU's video actually references Ireland
804080	809840	in the single instance of admitting that the British Empire was not completely perfect.
809840	810640	Let's have a watch.
811200	814960	Even where the British have merited criticism, as in Ireland,
815520	817360	there is more to the Imperial story.
818000	821200	During negotiations to create the Irish Republic, for instance,
821680	825520	British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, who could speak Welsh,
825520	830080	reminded the Irish nationalist and Gaelic extremist Eamon de Valera
830080	833200	that the Celts never had a word for Republic.
833920	836720	It was an idea given to them by the English.
837680	840000	So, what was that?
840560	845040	Crocker admits that the Empire merited criticism in Ireland,
845040	846720	which is putting it rather lightly,
846800	848320	but as a counterargument,
848320	852720	quotes David Lloyd George talking about the origin of the word Republic,
853760	857040	which has nothing to do with anything.
857040	859600	You know, not only is it completely disconnected
859600	863200	from any of the criticisms that the British Empire merited,
863200	864640	it's a misquote.
864640	867840	Now, there are different accounts of this particular conversation,
867840	874160	but none of them are so ludicrous as to credit the English with the concept of the Republic.
874160	876640	That's from the Latin, you know.
876640	880960	As is this Irish word, which has its roots in populace there,
880960	885920	which was one of two competing Irish translations of the word Republic at the time.
886640	888880	Not that any of this matters, of course.
888880	894240	What a really bizarre way to avoid actually mentioning any of the crimes of the Empire.
894880	895840	Never fear, though.
895840	898960	If we want to see exactly what Crocker thinks about the Irish,
898960	904000	we can just once again take a peek at his politically incorrect guide to the British Empire.
904320	908560	Where we see him talking about Ireland's recidivist barbarisms.
908560	909280	He says,
909280	911600	"...there is much to admire about the Irish,
911600	916960	but it is also easy to see why the English, when not regarding them as comical,
916960	922640	tended to see them as shiftless, ignorant, stubborn, concimacious, and cruel."
922640	924080	Crocker concludes that,
924080	929280	"...the English left Ireland language, laws, and parliamentary government,
929280	933760	but did nothing to tame the stubborn pugnacity of Ireland's Celts."
934640	935360	Jeez.
935360	937040	Left Ireland language.
937760	940640	It already had a language, honestly.
940640	944320	If you had to guess when this racist drivel was written,
944320	947760	you'd guess, like, 1910 or something, wouldn't you?
947760	951200	Not 2011, which is when it actually was released.
951200	954240	Now, not mentioned in the PragerU video, of course,
954240	956960	are any of the Empire's various other crimes,
956960	960160	which, again, are too numerous to mention here.
960160	964000	There's nothing about the Empire's use of concentration camps in Africa.
964080	968880	It's massacres of indigenous Australians overseeing a famine in India
968880	972800	that killed and displaced millions of people during the Second World War.
972800	976960	Though I'm sure Crocker could find someone loosely associated with each of those events
976960	980480	who had once said the word republic or liberty or something.
981040	983200	You know, don't look at all the bodies,
983200	986480	just say words like freedom and liberty over and over.
986480	989760	Now, I earlier said that those words were being used meaninglessly,
989760	991040	and just to back that up a bit,
991040	995680	I'd like to quote again from Crocker's politically incorrect guide to the Civil War.
995680	996320	He says,
996320	999120	"...the Confederate States of America, in short,
999120	1001840	had formed a republic with a limited government
1001840	1004880	that guaranteed individual and state rights."
1006000	1007920	Unless you were a slave, of course.
1007920	1009840	"...and unlike the republic up north,
1009840	1014720	didn't insist on subjugating states that didn't want to be a part of it.
1014720	1019280	The Confederacy might have had slavery, as the United States did,
1019280	1020880	but it was no tyranny."
1022000	1023840	Again, unless you were a slave.
1024400	1029360	Now, the United States of America is presented throughout this book as the aggressor,
1029360	1034400	as denying the southern states their inalienable rights to own other people.
1034400	1039040	You know, as being anti all those good words like liberty and freedom and so on.
1039040	1042080	Crocker's allegiances will change with the conflict.
1042080	1045520	He'll sing the praises of the United States in the PragerU video,
1045520	1050720	whereas in his books he writes fanfiction about it being defeated and conquered by an enemy.
1050720	1054960	It's a bizarre trend among people who claim to love Western civilization
1054960	1058000	to find themselves praising its greatest enemies.
1058000	1062880	For instance, new PragerU collaborator Candace Owens recently got herself in some hot water
1062880	1068960	for claiming that Hitler would have been fine if he kept his ambitions inside Germany.
1068960	1074720	Now, I'd like to close out today by asking who on earth this video was made for.
1074800	1081440	You know, anyone in or near a former British colony will immediately recognize it as bullshit.
1081440	1087440	Maybe it was made for Americans who don't know about the Revolutionary War, I guess.
1088480	1093360	British nationalists who refuse to admit the empire wasn't purely altruistic.
1094000	1096240	Maybe just the far right in general.
1096960	1098560	I don't know, genuinely.
1098560	1100400	Let me know what you think in the comments.
1101360	1105680	Maybe it was made for the world's worst homeschooling teachers.
1105680	1109760	You see, this one has a study guide with questions to answer afterwards as well.
1110480	1113920	The British were more than content to leave people alone,
1113920	1118640	to let them be themselves, to govern them with the lightest possible hand.
1119280	1120640	True, false.
1121520	1123040	It's fucking ridiculous.
1124320	1126160	That's all from me today, folks.
1126160	1128640	Sorry to go back to the PragerU well so soon,
1128640	1131440	but I saw this video and how many views it had,
1131440	1134400	and had to start typing a response immediately.
1134960	1138640	Thanks, as always, to all of my patrons who support me over on Patreon,
1138640	1141760	whose wonderful names should be on the screen right now.
1141760	1144080	If you'd like to join them in supporting the channel,
1144080	1147440	click that Patreon link below the video and go check it out.
1147440	1150800	I'll also include links to my Twitter and CuriousCat pages
1150800	1153840	if you fancy giving me a follow or asking me a question.
1153840	1156640	Also, a quick behind-the-scenes note here.
1156640	1161360	We're coming up on 200,000 subscribers, which is very exciting.
1161920	1164880	We'll probably pass that within a couple of days, actually,
1164880	1168480	and I'll be putting out a quick Q&A video sometime soon to celebrate,
1168480	1170080	so look forward to that.
1170640	1173120	Right, thanks folks, and I'll see you next time.
1175200	1177360	More like crock of shit.
1179360	1180080	Thank you.
