0	3680	Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about Cuphead,
3680	10880	and more specifically, a few completely real controversies related to Cuphead that definitely happened and matter.
10880	13680	But first of all, what is Cuphead?
13680	17920	Well, it's a video game. A rather good video game, in my opinion.
17920	25600	It's a side-scrolling run-and-gun game in which players control the titular Cuphead with his pal Mugman in co-op mode.
25760	30560	Now, Cuphead and Mugman are both in trouble after finding themselves on the wrong side of the tracks
30560	33680	and losing a dice in the Devil's Casino.
33680	40160	Indebted to the Devil, the duo have to track down the Devil's runaway debtors and collect their soul contracts for him.
40160	43760	It's a pretty neat game, and I'd recommend playing it if you haven't.
43760	49440	It has a reputation for difficulty, apparently, but I beat it fairly easily, to be honest,
49440	51680	and it didn't even take me that long, either.
51680	57600	But then again, I am brilliant at the computer games, and thus have earned the right to talk about them.
57600	61600	So, given that I'm not a game review channel, you might be wondering,
61600	63840	why am I talking about Cuphead?
63840	70960	And that's because Cuphead is racist, ableist, and out-of-touch elitist games journalists all hate it,
70960	72560	because it's too difficult.
72560	88560	You know, Cuphead is racist! That game is, it's animation styled, it's based around those racist cartoons from the 1930s and 40s,
88560	92320	so clearly the game is the embodiment of racism!
92320	96160	Oh, I can one-up that! It's actually ableist!
96160	103280	That's right, it's ableism, and it's just in its most concentrated form, in a form of interactive entertainment!
103280	109120	And then I had to go and just shut the shit off, and take a couple steps away from my social media feed,
109120	117040	because no matter where I went, every single fucking corner of the internet was caked with shit sticking to a wall,
117040	121520	so fucking bad that even the flies decided, you know what, I can go elsewhere.
121520	125600	This is the kind of stuff that I was seeing all the time, based around Cuphead.
125600	134960	That's a ranty chap called Alpha Omega Sin, telling his half a million subscribers about the hatred Cuphead is apparently receiving all the time,
134960	137840	in every single corner of the internet.
137840	142320	And he certainly seems rather worked up about it, so I'm sure it is actually happening,
142320	148800	but I have to ask, for the sake of argument, who is it who is actually attacking Cuphead?
148800	150800	Who are these scoundrels?
150800	154960	And this is a game that I got to play, and I enjoyed the living fuck out of,
154960	162240	yet now due to the game's difficulty, because it's actually a challenging game, not fucking impossible,
162240	168400	an actual challenging game, they think that, huh, that's ableist!
168400	172080	And they think because of the art style that it is racist,
172080	177280	literally just haphazardly applying fucking labels wherever they see fit,
177280	184720	and this is gamers and journalists that are saying this kind of shit.
184720	190240	You've got to be fucking kidding me that this is what's happening.
190240	196480	A game does not deserve this kind of bullshit, yet it's happening anyway.
196480	199040	It's happening anyway, apparently.
199040	205200	So it's fake gamers and air quotes journalists who've been attacking Cuphead then.
205200	210240	Now, Mr. Alpha Omega-Sen rants for a solid 16 minutes in much the same vein as what you've seen,
210240	215600	but at no point actually identifies who it is specifically he's shouting about.
215600	219600	He does a lot of impressions of imaginary silly people calling Cuphead racist,
219600	225840	and refers to a nebulous they a lot of times, but never actually calls out anyone in particular,
225840	229360	and that makes the comments under his video rather confusing.
229360	231040	Here's a few examples.
231040	232720	Alex Barranco says,
261280	265200	...back into the Dark Ages, and we could just start over.
265200	268880	SJW would not last long in that kind of world.
268880	270480	Fucking Christ.
270480	273280	And Lilith, aka the Firehawk, says,
285840	290320	These people. And this is something you see over and over again in these comments.
290320	294000	These people. These people. These people.
294000	297920	Dude, I didn't know until I saw this video that people were saying this shit.
297920	302000	I totally agree with you, Alpha. These people are dumb.
302000	304800	And, like, who?
304800	308720	Who are they all talking about? You know, who are these people?
308720	310640	How did this happen?
310640	314640	How is it that this guy can whip up his audience into such a rage
314640	320000	that they're wishing for every sort of violence up to and including nuclear annihilation?
320000	323920	Directed at a completely undefined enemy.
323920	326560	Is it me, or is that rather odd?
326560	331520	So what we're gonna do today is try to figure out how Cuphead became the latest battlefield
331520	334880	for capital-G gamers on one side, and quote,
334880	337120	...these people on the other.
337120	340880	And along the way, we'll see if we can find any examples of these people
340880	344160	and see what, if anything, they've actually said about Cuphead.
344720	346480	So to start off here,
346480	349520	back in August at the Gamescom event in Germany,
349520	354080	a VentureBeat writer named Dean Takahashi played a preview version of Cuphead
354080	356160	in order to write an article about it.
356160	359840	The footage of his attempt was uploaded to VentureBeat's YouTube channel,
359840	362880	and his below-average gameplay garnered some...
363920	365920	...attention, shall we say.
365920	369040	Now, Takahashi's article acknowledges his poor performance,
369040	369760	starting out,
369760	372560	"...I suck at Cuphead, let's get this out of the way,"
372560	373600	and later saying,
373600	376800	"...go ahead, laugh your heart out at my expense.
376800	380000	While my performance on the captured video below is quite shameful,
380000	381760	as I never finished the level,
381760	384160	I think it shows quite well why Cuphead is fun,
384160	388240	and why making hard games that depend on skill is like a lost art."
388240	390240	So, you know, what happened here?
390800	393840	A dude was bad at a video game for half an hour.
393840	396480	He blames his own poor play, not the game.
396480	397920	He calls it fun.
397920	400960	He's self-deprecatingly good-natured about it,
400960	402560	you know, posting the video online,
402560	405200	because it's funny that he sucks at the game.
405200	408080	And he's also not reviewing the game, by the way.
408080	411040	He just previewed it for a bit at a games expo.
411040	415600	A different journalist at VentureBeat wrote the actual review of Cuphead on the site,
415600	418000	giving it a score of 85 out of 100,
418000	418480	and saying,
418480	422320	"...these days, beating a game sometimes doesn't feel like much of an actual achievement,
422320	425920	but I was happy and proud when I killed the last boss in Cuphead.
425920	429440	The fact that it was so hard made it so rewarding."
429440	433280	And Dean Takahashi later posted a short video of him playing
433280	436240	and beating the level that he had earlier struggled with,
436240	439360	so well done to Dean for improving, I guess.
440240	442880	So why is this all a thing?
443520	446480	Well, about that attention I mentioned earlier,
446480	452560	lots of folks reacted rather poorly to some guy being bad at a video game.
452560	456720	For example, air quotes journalist Ian Miles Prower Chong
456720	459200	got some ads in his pants about the situation,
459200	459700	saying,
460160	463520	"...games journalists are incredibly bad at video games.
463520	465520	It's painful to watch this.
465520	468480	How do they think they're qualified to write about games?
468480	472560	How can a paid professional games journalist be this bad at video games?
472560	475520	Dean Takahashi spent 26 minutes playing the first level
475520	477680	and never got past the starting area.
477680	481360	I don't know how it's possible to rely on the recommendations of game journalists
481360	484160	when they don't even have basic reflexes needed to play."
484160	487920	It explains why they're all enamored with walking simulators,
487920	491680	no skill necessary, just press W and the game will take care of itself,
491680	493760	and so on and so forth.
493760	496000	So that's quite the extrapolation there.
496000	501440	Dean Takahashi, the singular person being bad at Cuphead for a bit at a games expo,
501440	506240	is now all games journalists being terrible at all games all the time
506240	510160	and engaging in some conspiracy to promote walking simulators or something.
510720	513520	All this despite Takahashi's preview of the game
513520	518400	and the later actual review on the site, both praising Cuphead's difficulty.
518400	520400	Chong's take was popular though,
520400	524720	with more than 12,000 people sharing his tweet mocking Takahashi's gameplay
524720	528080	and detached theorizing about walking simulators.
528080	531120	And so begins the curse of the numbers.
531120	534320	The VentureBeat video received over a million views.
534320	538640	PewDiePie put out a video where he reacts rather obnoxiously to that video,
538640	541760	which has over six million views at the time of writing this
541760	544320	and another one that has over four million.
544320	548000	Some channel called Rags put out the Cuphead Chronicles,
548000	553920	gamers versus journalists mocking Takahashi's gameplay to a couple of hundred thousand viewers.
553920	556800	So Cuphead is the hot topic to argue about,
556800	561120	so we keep talking about it until it doesn't get us attention anymore.
561120	563920	That's how YouTube works, folks.
563920	565360	And not to skip ahead too much,
565360	570080	but if nobody is actually saying anything worthwhile creating a ranty response to,
570080	573520	for example, if nobody is calling Cuphead racist,
573520	577920	you can just pretend they are and your audience will believe you anyway.
577920	579840	But let's get back on track.
579840	581680	So on October 29th,
581680	585760	Ian Miles Chong shared an article on a site called Super Nerd Land
585760	588320	written by Twitter user Cheeky Scrump,
588320	592800	and that's called Postmortem, the Dark Souls of Games Reviews.
592800	596160	And when Cheeky Scrump posted this article to Twitter, they added,
596240	600080	Why are games journalists so dead set on attacking difficult games?
600640	602320	Because it benefits them.
602320	608320	But is it true that games journalists are dead set on attacking difficult games like Cuphead?
608320	610640	Well, I don't know about that, to be honest.
610640	613920	Cuphead has an 88 on Metacritic for a start.
613920	616560	It got five stars on Giant Bomb,
616560	618640	8.5 on Polygon,
618640	620560	8 out of 10 on GameSpot,
620560	621520	and so on.
621520	624480	And all these reviews praise the difficulty level.
625040	628400	Games journalists love Cuphead and its difficulty,
629040	633680	going by what they actually, you know, say about it.
633680	638640	So who are the games journalists who are apparently dead set on attacking difficult games?
638640	640880	You know, who are they?
640880	643440	Are they more of these people?
643440	647680	Well, let's read this article by Cheeky Scrump and see if we can find out.
647680	648320	And I quote,
649040	652480	Most recently, Cuphead, the much-hyped run-and-gun platformer
652480	654800	with a Golden Age-era cartoon aesthetic,
654800	658160	was described as somewhere between Mario and Dark Souls
658160	662080	by now-infamous games journalist Dean Takahashi.
662080	665360	Cuphead and its like have created unexpected controversies
665360	670560	about whether or not games journalists should have basic ability when it comes to playing games.
670560	674000	The long and short of it is that Cuphead has become a jumping-off point
674000	679280	for a full-scale attack on difficult and exclusionary games by the gaming press.
679280	680720	As the argument goes,
680720	685440	games that are difficult rob lesser skilled players of the chance to complete them,
685440	687760	therefore making them exclusionary.
687760	689280	Now, if we click on that link there,
689280	693120	we're taken to a Polygon article written by Ben Kuchira entitled
693120	695680	When is Exclusion a Valid Design Choice?
695680	697440	So, is this it?
697440	698960	Have we found it, finally?
698960	704400	Is this the full-scale attack by games journalists dead set on attacking difficult games?
705040	705540	Well...
706320	706820	No.
707200	711520	Cheeky Scrump is being rather misleading about the content of this Polygon article
711520	713680	in a way that, in my opinion,
713680	719440	perfectly illustrates how a lot of people online simply don't know how to read properly.
719440	723040	So, let's take a look at this Polygon article and how it's written.
723040	726400	It starts out with the headline, which is a question,
726400	728720	When is Exclusion a Valid Design Choice?
729360	732080	And it proposes another in its first paragraph,
732080	735840	Are you owed the act of finishing a game because you bought it?
735840	738960	Now, this article is an attempt to answer those questions,
738960	741360	and it presents multiple viewpoints.
741360	743680	As an example, it at one point states,
743680	748000	The difficulty will turn some people off, and those people never get to see that art.
748000	750480	They will never get to enjoy those animations.
750480	753040	The design of the game itself keeps them out.
753120	755920	When the addition of an easy mode or option to skip the bosses
755920	759120	would allow everyone to see as much or as little as they want.
759120	761920	So why are so many people against this idea?
761920	765360	And following that, it offers an opposing argument.
765360	768880	And yet the difficulty is part of the experience of playing Cuphead.
768880	772000	Difficult games create an emotional reaction in the player,
772000	775040	and that reaction might be the point of the difficulty.
775040	778400	So if a game is designed to be played in a very particular way,
778400	781600	and Cuphead asks you to treat failure as a chance to learn
781600	784160	and rewards repetition and memorization,
784160	789280	aren't you subverting those goals by asking for a mode that removes that method of play?
789280	791520	I hope you're able to see my point here.
791520	794800	This article is discussing something.
794800	800240	It proposes a question, then shows multiple viewpoints and presents arguments for each.
800800	805600	This article isn't attacking Cuphead or difficult games in general.
805600	808720	It's just discussing an issue related to them.
809280	812320	So how would one misread this article?
812320	816160	Well, you'd see the title, which has the word exclusion in it,
816160	821680	and then you'd just smash that into your pre-existing idea of what games journalists want and think,
821680	826880	and come to the conclusion that the point of the article was that Cuphead is ableist trash
826880	831760	and the developers should only make walking simulators about lesbians from now on.
831760	832480	Obviously.
833200	836720	It's silly, but it genuinely is how a lot of folks appear to read.
836720	841440	You know, seeing the headline and then just imagining the rest of the text.
841440	845040	For another example of someone playing the headline guessing game,
845040	849760	let's return to Ian Miles-Chong, who on November 12th posted the following tweet.
850400	854160	Here come the attacks on Cuphead and how it's racist.
854160	856160	And he shows pictures of two articles.
856720	860480	He doesn't link to them, obviously, he just shows screenshots of the headlines,
860480	862960	because after all, that's all you need.
862960	868000	So then, Cuphead is not just ableist, it's also racist, apparently.
868000	871760	Now, the first article is from a site called Kotaku,
871760	872800	and it's entitled,
872800	876880	It's Impossible to Separate Cuphead from the Era That Inspired It,
876880	880240	which is itself mainly just sharing the article in the second image,
880240	883040	which is Cuphead and the Racist Specter of...
884080	886080	Fleischer animation?
886080	887360	I'm gonna go with Fleischer.
888160	891680	That's written by Yusef Kohl from the website Unwinnable.
891680	894560	And that's an interesting article, which I'll link in the description.
895120	896800	I'd encourage you to take a look at it.
896800	903200	But for now, of note here, is that neither of these articles actually call Cuphead racist.
903200	908480	They say that its animation is a recreation of an early 20th century animation style that was,
909040	912240	at the time, frequently very racist.
912240	915840	And they go on to discuss the implications and the meaning of that.
915840	919040	Now, first of all, it's odd that Ian Miles-Chong would say,
919040	922160	Here come the attacks on Cuphead and how it's racist,
922160	927440	considering that concerns about its animation style had been raised as early as 2014,
927440	929840	with one journalist in particular stating that
929840	935200	Cuphead's character designs seem like callbacks to some really problematic racial caricatures
935200	936640	from the 1930s.
937280	939040	Not sure what to think of them.
939040	942640	That journalist there being Ian Miles-Chong.
942640	945040	Twitter user Zach Smith responded,
945040	946560	Disagree completely.
946560	948720	Why do people over-analyze everything?
948720	950400	To which Ian responds,
950400	954480	Because it's important to look at the world with a critical eye.
954480	958560	That was before the ant colony decided to nest in his head, I guess.
958560	962000	So, is 2014 Ian Miles-Chong correct?
962000	964400	Well, I decided to do a little investigating
964400	966960	and watched a bunch of old animations from the time.
966960	971280	Now, fair warning here, I'm about to show some very racist stuff.
971280	974480	I mean, some of this shit is just absolutely dreadful.
974560	978560	Now, okay, a lot of people back then were super racist,
978560	980480	and so was their entertainment.
980480	981520	We know that.
981520	985840	And if the animation style was all that linked Cuphead to these cartoons,
985840	987760	I'd consider this kind of a stretch.
988320	992000	But honestly, the animation is only one part of it.
992000	995440	Cuphead shares a lot of other similarities with these cartoons,
995440	997760	and some of them are rather awkward.
997760	1000160	So let's take a look at a few of these similarities.
1000960	1004240	First of all, Cuphead and Mugman are gamblers,
1004240	1008480	who, tempted by easy riches, play dice with the devil,
1008480	1010160	and then have to be punished.
1010160	1013360	And this gambling motif comes up time and time again
1013360	1016560	in relation to the crude African-American caricatures
1016560	1018400	in these cartoons from the period.
1018960	1022560	For example, all this and rabbit stew features Bugs Bunny
1022560	1025600	using a pair of dice to hypnotize a rabbit hunter.
1025680	1028960	Now, now, now, now, wait a minute, Doc. Relax.
1028960	1030720	Now, now, now, hold it a minute.
1035440	1037040	What's y'all got there, man?
1037680	1041280	It's couldn't be a pair of them.
1043440	1046960	And this is something that's repeated in the cartoon Angel Puss.
1055600	1064800	A supposedly comedic cartoon version of Uncle Tom's Bungalow
1064800	1068080	ends with the titular character purchasing his freedom.
1068080	1069840	And how could he afford to do that?
1070400	1074640	Well, he got rich with a pair of loaded dice, obviously.
1074640	1077840	The cartoon Clean Pastures has a group of angels
1077840	1080800	trying to entice the residents of cartoon Harlem
1080800	1083040	to go to Parodice.
1084080	1087120	Parodice. Get it? It's like paradise.
1087840	1092480	And a cartoon called Coal Black and the Seven Dwarves, get it,
1093360	1095680	has this guy with dice for teeth.
1096480	1097760	What is it with the dice?
1098640	1103040	Anyway, the cartoon I watched that was most relevant to Cuphead here
1103040	1105280	is Sunday Go to Meeting Time,
1105280	1109920	which besides being fucking racist as balls, obviously,
1110480	1114080	features a story that is pretty close to the one in Cuphead.
1114080	1118560	In that cartoon, various caricatured black people are heading to a church.
1119520	1120160	Oh, God.
1120880	1124800	All except the main character, who's playing dice,
1124800	1126880	if you can believe it, behind a fence,
1126880	1130000	before being admonished by a different racist stereotype.
1130640	1133920	Later slipping out of church to steal chickens,
1134640	1137840	the characters hit on the head and experiences a vision
1137840	1141120	of being sent to hell to answer for his various crimes,
1141120	1146240	including playing dice, obviously, and stealing watermelons.
1147200	1147840	Fucking hell.
1148560	1151760	The main character then meets the devil, who sings a song.
1152720	1171680	Now, if you're watching this and you've played Cuphead,
1171680	1174880	you'll have noticed many similarities here.
1174880	1176720	It's not just the animation.
1181760	1192880	You see, what the Cuphead developers have done is watched these cartoons and said,
1192880	1195680	well, we love the music, the dice,
1195680	1199520	the main characters being punished for irresponsible gambling,
1199520	1200960	the cartoon devil.
1200960	1204720	The way the cartoon devil leans in like that is how he gets all big.
1205280	1210560	You know, all these trappings that were designed and utilized at the time to mock black people.
1211120	1212400	We love all them.
1212400	1215120	We just don't like the caricatures themselves.
1215120	1220160	So we'll swap out the stereotype for a little cartoon cup man instead,
1220160	1221200	and we're good to go.
1221760	1226720	Speaking to Kotaku, game designer Chad Moldenhauer said,
1226720	1229920	we went into the game knowing that what we wanted from the era
1229920	1234400	was the technical artistic merit while leaving all the garbage behind.
1235600	1238240	But to what extent can that be done?
1238240	1242640	You know, is it possible to fully extract the caricature from the environment?
1242640	1243680	I guess is the question.
1244320	1248880	Now, to be fair, these cartoons are only a part of Cuphead's design influences.
1248880	1254720	There's some Tom and Jerry in there, some Popeye, Betty Boop, and so on.
1254720	1258240	But the racist cartoons had their influence too.
1258240	1262400	The guy with the dice for a head singing that the devil has his price,
1262400	1265360	he could have stepped right out of one of these cartoons.
1265360	1270400	And that's, well, I don't know, it's worthy of a conversation, isn't it?
1270960	1275600	You know, for someone with knowledge of these racist cartoons to play Cuphead
1275600	1278800	and be reminded of them and made to feel uncomfortable,
1278800	1281920	well, that's a perfectly legitimate reaction, honestly.
1281920	1284800	And I'm certainly not going to argue with those people.
1284800	1288320	Again, I'm not attacking Cuphead here.
1288320	1289760	I like Cuphead.
1289760	1292080	I'm just talking about it.
1292080	1294480	And I feel the need to reiterate that right now
1294480	1296720	because of something else I saw on Twitter.
1297440	1300960	Video game designer Mark Kern is one of the people on the
1300960	1306000	making up things about games journalists to justify hating them bandwagon.
1306000	1311440	And he's tweeted a whole bunch of times about how everyone is calling Cuphead racist.
1311440	1313600	And apparently, he was getting called out for that
1313600	1317120	because on November 12th, he posted the following sarcastic tweet.
1317760	1321520	Yes, nobody is saying Cuphead is racist.
1321520	1323280	I'm making it all up.
1323280	1325840	And let's take a look at the picture he's responding to,
1325840	1329200	which is apparently evidence for him not making it all up.
1329200	1331840	And it's from a Twitter conversation which reads like this.
1332560	1334320	Peter L. Newton says,
1334320	1336480	I'm not personally upset by this game,
1336480	1340880	but the developers can't be naive about the origins of their art style either.
1340880	1342880	They know when it's from and what happened then.
1343440	1346000	Downplaying it is what I find disrespectful.
1346720	1348400	Steven Whittle then responds,
1349120	1351280	This is an issue I have when teaching.
1351280	1354800	Students who ignore context of what they use slash appropriate
1354800	1359040	and don't understand that ignoring a problematic meaning doesn't make it go away.
1359760	1362480	My games don't have a message doesn't fly,
1362480	1365040	especially with regards to procedural rhetoric.
1365680	1366720	That being said,
1366720	1369440	I'm uncertain how they could have used those motifs
1369440	1371920	without it being problematic in some way or another.
1372560	1374320	Then Kay Sheely adds,
1374320	1376960	The thing that bothers me is not the art style itself,
1376960	1379680	but that the developers said they're not even interested
1379680	1382800	in talking about its history, which feels irresponsible to me.
1383440	1383920	Now then,
1384480	1388400	none of these people were attacking Cuphead right here.
1388400	1390400	They weren't calling for it to be banned
1390400	1393120	or saying the developers are terrible people
1393120	1395920	or that you're racist if you like Cuphead
1395920	1399760	or any other ridiculous, extrapolated nonsense.
1399760	1404720	They're just talking about the game and its design elements and its development.
1404720	1405440	And that's all.
1406240	1409200	That someone like Mark Kern can read this discussion
1409200	1414640	and have Cuphead is racist be his only takeaway from it is really disappointing.
1414640	1418960	I'm of the opinion that art is anything that people treat like art,
1418960	1423840	and we, as gamers, should be willing to at least entertain these sorts of discussions,
1423840	1425280	even if we disagree.
1425280	1428560	It's not hurting anyone, is it, to have this conversation.
1429200	1433120	The real divide here isn't between gamers and games journalists,
1433120	1436880	it's between people who are prepared to have conversations about gaming
1436880	1440720	as if it's a real art form deserving of thoughtful criticism,
1440720	1445440	and people who mistake that criticism for insult and overreact to it.
1445440	1450080	To certain folks, though, this polite conversation about Cuphead's art style
1450080	1453920	will always read as an outraged accusation of racism,
1453920	1456960	and this balanced discussion about difficulty levels
1456960	1460080	will be read as an outraged accusation of ableism.
1460640	1462720	And I'm not sure there's anything I could say here
1462720	1465280	to get them to take a more nuanced look, really.
1465280	1468640	It's in their financial interest to imagine outrage
1468640	1470880	in order to be outraged about it.
1470880	1474240	And to loop back around to our pal AlphaOmegaSin for a second,
1474240	1479200	a little sketch he performs in his video illustrates the hypocrisy of this pretty nicely.
1479200	1483680	I would love to see these motherfuckers somehow sit at a table with people
1483680	1487120	that are actually dying of illness,
1487120	1488720	and try to explain to them,
1488720	1493520	oh, man, well, I see that you've only got mere weeks to live because, well,
1493520	1497600	what you're currently dealing with is incurable,
1497600	1500080	but I was playing Cuphead.
1500080	1504000	You know, I'm really sorry that your family's off in a separate room
1504000	1506880	and they're crying their eyes out and they don't know what to do
1506880	1509280	because you were actually the breadwinner of the family,
1509280	1512080	and unfortunately, they aren't going to be able to make ends meet
1512080	1515200	and they're going to have somebody that is kind of the glue of the family
1515200	1519120	is going to end up having to leave them, but Cuphead's really difficult.
1519120	1523440	So he imagines one of these people going up to someone with a terminal
1523920	1527440	and complaining about Cuphead's difficulty to, I suppose,
1527440	1530880	illustrate the relative triviality of that complaint.
1530880	1534560	What he doesn't somehow see is how easily he and his complaints
1534560	1537120	can be inserted into that same sketch.
1537120	1540080	Imagine going up to someone with a terminal illness and saying,
1540080	1543120	sorry, I know you're about to die and your family's sad
1543120	1545200	because you're the breadwinner and everything,
1546240	1548800	but some people called a video game ableist.
1549440	1553120	That's what I'm choosing to spend my time being outraged about.
1553120	1557200	And before wrapping up here, I'd like to highlight this tweet from Cheeky Scrump,
1557200	1560400	the author of the earlier article shared by Ian Miles-Chong.
1560960	1562080	And I quote,
1562080	1566160	The rich kid who used to laugh at you for wearing a Mario t-shirt in high school
1566160	1569600	now rents a two million dollar apartment in San Francisco
1569600	1571120	where they pretend to be poor
1571120	1574080	and write about how they're a real fan of video games,
1574080	1576080	not these toxic gamers.
1576080	1578160	Now, this is obviously a very silly point,
1578160	1581760	but it does expose the thinking behind a part of the gamer side
1581760	1584720	of the gamer-games journalist divide.
1584720	1588080	I've spoken previously about how self-identified gamers
1588080	1591360	have attempted to adopt the language of oppressed groups.
1591360	1593440	Well, what this is right here is an example
1593440	1597120	of gamers clumsily having a go at class concepts.
1597120	1600320	And it reminds me of that amazing Gamergate era image
1600320	1604320	showing the impoverished gamers holding up the rich games journalists
1604320	1607360	and critical theorist social justice warriors,
1607360	1608480	which is just wonderful.
1609120	1612720	Gamers who see games journalists as out-of-touch millionaires
1612720	1615920	ruining games while sipping champagne in their mansions
1615920	1619200	are arguably, in microcosm anyway,
1619200	1621520	carrying out a criticism of capitalism,
1621520	1623440	albeit a deeply flawed one.
1624080	1626320	They're acting as the oppressed workers
1626320	1630080	and have incorrectly positioned journalists, for some reason,
1630080	1631680	as the rich taskmasters.
1632240	1635520	So when Dean Takahashi is shown to be bad at a video game,
1635520	1639440	it's thus a deeply upsetting breach of the natural order.
1639440	1642400	You know, the capital-G gamers react to that much like
1642400	1645120	we would all react to finding out a billionaire banker
1645120	1647360	wasn't paying any taxes or something.
1647360	1648400	How outrageous.
1648400	1650880	You know, that's not how things are supposed to work.
1650880	1654240	And their explanation is the standard liberal failing
1654240	1656160	when criticizing capitalism.
1656160	1658400	You know, the wrong people are at the top.
1658960	1660640	Fire Dean Takahashi.
1661200	1662240	Get rid of him.
1662240	1664960	And fire any other journalists who supported him.
1664960	1667840	You know, there's no such thing as a systemic problem.
1667840	1670160	It's just that the wrong people are in charge.
1671360	1673920	How did they get the idea that games journalists
1673920	1676000	are in charge of anything?
1676000	1678000	No offense to games journalists here.
1678560	1681200	And how many layers of this metaphor are we on now?
1681200	1681920	I've lost track.
1682560	1685360	Let's try and extract ourselves from it, I think.
1686000	1687920	So what's my overall point here?
1688560	1690320	I don't know anymore, to be honest.
1690320	1692880	Maybe it's gamers should learn a bit more
1692880	1694720	about the world outside gaming.
1695920	1696880	Probably.
1696880	1699440	I feel like a lot of capital-G gamers
1699440	1701280	are so threatened by journalism
1701280	1704480	that simply asks questions or sparks debate
1704480	1706960	because they'd rather be totally passive
1706960	1708800	and uncritical consumers
1708800	1711600	of a predictable and unchanging product.
1711600	1713760	And any hint of outside influence
1713760	1717360	possibly interfering with the imagined purity of that product
1717360	1721360	and its creation process is taken as an outraged attack.
1721360	1724080	Or maybe it's simply being reminded of the fact
1724080	1726720	that games even have a creation process at all
1726720	1728640	that's so infuriating for them.
1728640	1732720	You know, games aren't created in a process by artists.
1732720	1733680	They just happen.
1734240	1737120	And we, as gamers, buy them.
1737120	1739360	And games journalists only exist
1739360	1741040	to give every game a high score
1741040	1743760	and provide us with a sense of shared experience
1743760	1746720	and reassurance in our enjoyment of the medium.
1747280	1748800	We don't just want to have fun.
1749360	1751840	We need to be told we're having fun.
1751840	1753840	And anyone theorizing about things
1753840	1755680	possibly being done differently
1755680	1758240	is just ruining the fantasy, really.
1758240	1760080	Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.
1760080	1762000	Now, any sharp-eyed fans out there
1762000	1764480	will have noticed that in my last video that went out,
1764480	1766000	I said in my next video,
1766000	1769040	I was going to be talking about anti-feminist YouTube.
1769040	1771840	And then this video was about Cuphead instead.
1771840	1773120	So what happened there?
1773920	1777120	Well, this video was originally a segment from that video
1777120	1779120	which is about the practice of making up
1779120	1781840	an imaginary enemy to be outraged about.
1781840	1783280	And as such, you'll have noticed
1783280	1784640	quite a lot of that in this video.
1784640	1786240	You know, gamers making up things
1786240	1788080	about games journalists and all that.
1788960	1790480	But as you can tell from the length,
1790480	1792800	this Cuphead section was getting a bit unwieldy,
1792800	1795200	so I decided to make it its own thing.
1795200	1796800	That video is still in the works.
1796800	1799280	It's probably not going to be my next release,
1799280	1802320	but maybe next month or early in January.
1803040	1804080	January?
1804080	1804800	Wow.
1804800	1807040	This year has really flown by, hasn't it?
1807600	1810960	Time flies when everyone is miserable
1810960	1813840	and only terrible things happen, apparently.
1815200	1816800	Thanks as always to my patrons
1816800	1818480	who should be scrolling by right now,
1819120	1820800	possibly for the last time.
1821360	1822800	There's getting a few too many of them
1822800	1825120	to scroll by in a reasonable time lately,
1825120	1827120	so I think I'm going to have to switch it up.
1827760	1830320	I might do a series of static text boxes.
1831040	1832560	That's something I might try out.
1832560	1834960	Or maybe I'll set appearing in the credits
1834960	1837120	as a tier reward or something, I don't know.
1837840	1839840	Having too many patrons to manage
1839840	1843200	is one of those good problems to have, though, I guess.
1843200	1846080	So thank you all again, sincerely,
1846080	1847440	and I'll see you next time.
