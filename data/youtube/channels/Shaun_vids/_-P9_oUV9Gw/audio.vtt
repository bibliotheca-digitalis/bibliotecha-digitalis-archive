00:00.000 --> 00:03.680
Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about Cuphead,

00:03.680 --> 00:10.880
and more specifically, a few completely real controversies related to Cuphead that definitely happened and matter.

00:10.880 --> 00:13.680
But first of all, what is Cuphead?

00:13.680 --> 00:17.920
Well, it's a video game. A rather good video game, in my opinion.

00:17.920 --> 00:25.600
It's a side-scrolling run-and-gun game in which players control the titular Cuphead with his pal Mugman in co-op mode.

00:25.760 --> 00:30.560
Now, Cuphead and Mugman are both in trouble after finding themselves on the wrong side of the tracks

00:30.560 --> 00:33.680
and losing a dice in the Devil's Casino.

00:33.680 --> 00:40.160
Indebted to the Devil, the duo have to track down the Devil's runaway debtors and collect their soul contracts for him.

00:40.160 --> 00:43.760
It's a pretty neat game, and I'd recommend playing it if you haven't.

00:43.760 --> 00:49.440
It has a reputation for difficulty, apparently, but I beat it fairly easily, to be honest,

00:49.440 --> 00:51.680
and it didn't even take me that long, either.

00:51.680 --> 00:57.600
But then again, I am brilliant at the computer games, and thus have earned the right to talk about them.

00:57.600 --> 01:01.600
So, given that I'm not a game review channel, you might be wondering,

01:01.600 --> 01:03.840
why am I talking about Cuphead?

01:03.840 --> 01:10.960
And that's because Cuphead is racist, ableist, and out-of-touch elitist games journalists all hate it,

01:10.960 --> 01:12.560
because it's too difficult.

01:12.560 --> 01:28.560
You know, Cuphead is racist! That game is, it's animation styled, it's based around those racist cartoons from the 1930s and 40s,

01:28.560 --> 01:32.320
so clearly the game is the embodiment of racism!

01:32.320 --> 01:36.160
Oh, I can one-up that! It's actually ableist!

01:36.160 --> 01:43.280
That's right, it's ableism, and it's just in its most concentrated form, in a form of interactive entertainment!

01:43.280 --> 01:49.120
And then I had to go and just shut the shit off, and take a couple steps away from my social media feed,

01:49.120 --> 01:57.040
because no matter where I went, every single fucking corner of the internet was caked with shit sticking to a wall,

01:57.040 --> 02:01.520
so fucking bad that even the flies decided, you know what, I can go elsewhere.

02:01.520 --> 02:05.600
This is the kind of stuff that I was seeing all the time, based around Cuphead.

02:05.600 --> 02:14.960
That's a ranty chap called Alpha Omega Sin, telling his half a million subscribers about the hatred Cuphead is apparently receiving all the time,

02:14.960 --> 02:17.840
in every single corner of the internet.

02:17.840 --> 02:22.320
And he certainly seems rather worked up about it, so I'm sure it is actually happening,

02:22.320 --> 02:28.800
but I have to ask, for the sake of argument, who is it who is actually attacking Cuphead?

02:28.800 --> 02:30.800
Who are these scoundrels?

02:30.800 --> 02:34.960
And this is a game that I got to play, and I enjoyed the living fuck out of,

02:34.960 --> 02:42.240
yet now due to the game's difficulty, because it's actually a challenging game, not fucking impossible,

02:42.240 --> 02:48.400
an actual challenging game, they think that, huh, that's ableist!

02:48.400 --> 02:52.080
And they think because of the art style that it is racist,

02:52.080 --> 02:57.280
literally just haphazardly applying fucking labels wherever they see fit,

02:57.280 --> 03:04.720
and this is gamers and journalists that are saying this kind of shit.

03:04.720 --> 03:10.240
You've got to be fucking kidding me that this is what's happening.

03:10.240 --> 03:16.480
A game does not deserve this kind of bullshit, yet it's happening anyway.

03:16.480 --> 03:19.040
It's happening anyway, apparently.

03:19.040 --> 03:25.200
So it's fake gamers and air quotes journalists who've been attacking Cuphead then.

03:25.200 --> 03:30.240
Now, Mr. Alpha Omega-Sen rants for a solid 16 minutes in much the same vein as what you've seen,

03:30.240 --> 03:35.600
but at no point actually identifies who it is specifically he's shouting about.

03:35.600 --> 03:39.600
He does a lot of impressions of imaginary silly people calling Cuphead racist,

03:39.600 --> 03:45.840
and refers to a nebulous they a lot of times, but never actually calls out anyone in particular,

03:45.840 --> 03:49.360
and that makes the comments under his video rather confusing.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.040
Here's a few examples.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.720
Alex Barranco says,

04:21.280 --> 04:25.200
...back into the Dark Ages, and we could just start over.

04:25.200 --> 04:28.880
SJW would not last long in that kind of world.

04:28.880 --> 04:30.480
Fucking Christ.

04:30.480 --> 04:33.280
And Lilith, aka the Firehawk, says,

04:45.840 --> 04:50.320
These people. And this is something you see over and over again in these comments.

04:50.320 --> 04:54.000
These people. These people. These people.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.920
Dude, I didn't know until I saw this video that people were saying this shit.

04:57.920 --> 05:02.000
I totally agree with you, Alpha. These people are dumb.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.800
And, like, who?

05:04.800 --> 05:08.720
Who are they all talking about? You know, who are these people?

05:08.720 --> 05:10.640
How did this happen?

05:10.640 --> 05:14.640
How is it that this guy can whip up his audience into such a rage

05:14.640 --> 05:20.000
that they're wishing for every sort of violence up to and including nuclear annihilation?

05:20.000 --> 05:23.920
Directed at a completely undefined enemy.

05:23.920 --> 05:26.560
Is it me, or is that rather odd?

05:26.560 --> 05:31.520
So what we're gonna do today is try to figure out how Cuphead became the latest battlefield

05:31.520 --> 05:34.880
for capital-G gamers on one side, and quote,

05:34.880 --> 05:37.120
...these people on the other.

05:37.120 --> 05:40.880
And along the way, we'll see if we can find any examples of these people

05:40.880 --> 05:44.160
and see what, if anything, they've actually said about Cuphead.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.480
So to start off here,

05:46.480 --> 05:49.520
back in August at the Gamescom event in Germany,

05:49.520 --> 05:54.080
a VentureBeat writer named Dean Takahashi played a preview version of Cuphead

05:54.080 --> 05:56.160
in order to write an article about it.

05:56.160 --> 05:59.840
The footage of his attempt was uploaded to VentureBeat's YouTube channel,

05:59.840 --> 06:02.880
and his below-average gameplay garnered some...

06:03.920 --> 06:05.920
...attention, shall we say.

06:05.920 --> 06:09.040
Now, Takahashi's article acknowledges his poor performance,

06:09.040 --> 06:09.760
starting out,

06:09.760 --> 06:12.560
"...I suck at Cuphead, let's get this out of the way,"

06:12.560 --> 06:13.600
and later saying,

06:13.600 --> 06:16.800
"...go ahead, laugh your heart out at my expense.

06:16.800 --> 06:20.000
While my performance on the captured video below is quite shameful,

06:20.000 --> 06:21.760
as I never finished the level,

06:21.760 --> 06:24.160
I think it shows quite well why Cuphead is fun,

06:24.160 --> 06:28.240
and why making hard games that depend on skill is like a lost art."

06:28.240 --> 06:30.240
So, you know, what happened here?

06:30.800 --> 06:33.840
A dude was bad at a video game for half an hour.

06:33.840 --> 06:36.480
He blames his own poor play, not the game.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.920
He calls it fun.

06:37.920 --> 06:40.960
He's self-deprecatingly good-natured about it,

06:40.960 --> 06:42.560
you know, posting the video online,

06:42.560 --> 06:45.200
because it's funny that he sucks at the game.

06:45.200 --> 06:48.080
And he's also not reviewing the game, by the way.

06:48.080 --> 06:51.040
He just previewed it for a bit at a games expo.

06:51.040 --> 06:55.600
A different journalist at VentureBeat wrote the actual review of Cuphead on the site,

06:55.600 --> 06:58.000
giving it a score of 85 out of 100,

06:58.000 --> 06:58.480
and saying,

06:58.480 --> 07:02.320
"...these days, beating a game sometimes doesn't feel like much of an actual achievement,

07:02.320 --> 07:05.920
but I was happy and proud when I killed the last boss in Cuphead.

07:05.920 --> 07:09.440
The fact that it was so hard made it so rewarding."

07:09.440 --> 07:13.280
And Dean Takahashi later posted a short video of him playing

07:13.280 --> 07:16.240
and beating the level that he had earlier struggled with,

07:16.240 --> 07:19.360
so well done to Dean for improving, I guess.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.880
So why is this all a thing?

07:23.520 --> 07:26.480
Well, about that attention I mentioned earlier,

07:26.480 --> 07:32.560
lots of folks reacted rather poorly to some guy being bad at a video game.

07:32.560 --> 07:36.720
For example, air quotes journalist Ian Miles Prower Chong

07:36.720 --> 07:39.200
got some ads in his pants about the situation,

07:39.200 --> 07:39.700
saying,

07:40.160 --> 07:43.520
"...games journalists are incredibly bad at video games.

07:43.520 --> 07:45.520
It's painful to watch this.

07:45.520 --> 07:48.480
How do they think they're qualified to write about games?

07:48.480 --> 07:52.560
How can a paid professional games journalist be this bad at video games?

07:52.560 --> 07:55.520
Dean Takahashi spent 26 minutes playing the first level

07:55.520 --> 07:57.680
and never got past the starting area.

07:57.680 --> 08:01.360
I don't know how it's possible to rely on the recommendations of game journalists

08:01.360 --> 08:04.160
when they don't even have basic reflexes needed to play."

08:04.160 --> 08:07.920
It explains why they're all enamored with walking simulators,

08:07.920 --> 08:11.680
no skill necessary, just press W and the game will take care of itself,

08:11.680 --> 08:13.760
and so on and so forth.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.000
So that's quite the extrapolation there.

08:16.000 --> 08:21.440
Dean Takahashi, the singular person being bad at Cuphead for a bit at a games expo,

08:21.440 --> 08:26.240
is now all games journalists being terrible at all games all the time

08:26.240 --> 08:30.160
and engaging in some conspiracy to promote walking simulators or something.

08:30.720 --> 08:33.520
All this despite Takahashi's preview of the game

08:33.520 --> 08:38.400
and the later actual review on the site, both praising Cuphead's difficulty.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.400
Chong's take was popular though,

08:40.400 --> 08:44.720
with more than 12,000 people sharing his tweet mocking Takahashi's gameplay

08:44.720 --> 08:48.080
and detached theorizing about walking simulators.

08:48.080 --> 08:51.120
And so begins the curse of the numbers.

08:51.120 --> 08:54.320
The VentureBeat video received over a million views.

08:54.320 --> 08:58.640
PewDiePie put out a video where he reacts rather obnoxiously to that video,

08:58.640 --> 09:01.760
which has over six million views at the time of writing this

09:01.760 --> 09:04.320
and another one that has over four million.

09:04.320 --> 09:08.000
Some channel called Rags put out the Cuphead Chronicles,

09:08.000 --> 09:13.920
gamers versus journalists mocking Takahashi's gameplay to a couple of hundred thousand viewers.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.800
So Cuphead is the hot topic to argue about,

09:16.800 --> 09:21.120
so we keep talking about it until it doesn't get us attention anymore.

09:21.120 --> 09:23.920
That's how YouTube works, folks.

09:23.920 --> 09:25.360
And not to skip ahead too much,

09:25.360 --> 09:30.080
but if nobody is actually saying anything worthwhile creating a ranty response to,

09:30.080 --> 09:33.520
for example, if nobody is calling Cuphead racist,

09:33.520 --> 09:37.920
you can just pretend they are and your audience will believe you anyway.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.840
But let's get back on track.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.680
So on October 29th,

09:41.680 --> 09:45.760
Ian Miles Chong shared an article on a site called Super Nerd Land

09:45.760 --> 09:48.320
written by Twitter user Cheeky Scrump,

09:48.320 --> 09:52.800
and that's called Postmortem, the Dark Souls of Games Reviews.

09:52.800 --> 09:56.160
And when Cheeky Scrump posted this article to Twitter, they added,

09:56.240 --> 10:00.080
Why are games journalists so dead set on attacking difficult games?

10:00.640 --> 10:02.320
Because it benefits them.

10:02.320 --> 10:08.320
But is it true that games journalists are dead set on attacking difficult games like Cuphead?

10:08.320 --> 10:10.640
Well, I don't know about that, to be honest.

10:10.640 --> 10:13.920
Cuphead has an 88 on Metacritic for a start.

10:13.920 --> 10:16.560
It got five stars on Giant Bomb,

10:16.560 --> 10:18.640
8.5 on Polygon,

10:18.640 --> 10:20.560
8 out of 10 on GameSpot,

10:20.560 --> 10:21.520
and so on.

10:21.520 --> 10:24.480
And all these reviews praise the difficulty level.

10:25.040 --> 10:28.400
Games journalists love Cuphead and its difficulty,

10:29.040 --> 10:33.680
going by what they actually, you know, say about it.

10:33.680 --> 10:38.640
So who are the games journalists who are apparently dead set on attacking difficult games?

10:38.640 --> 10:40.880
You know, who are they?

10:40.880 --> 10:43.440
Are they more of these people?

10:43.440 --> 10:47.680
Well, let's read this article by Cheeky Scrump and see if we can find out.

10:47.680 --> 10:48.320
And I quote,

10:49.040 --> 10:52.480
Most recently, Cuphead, the much-hyped run-and-gun platformer

10:52.480 --> 10:54.800
with a Golden Age-era cartoon aesthetic,

10:54.800 --> 10:58.160
was described as somewhere between Mario and Dark Souls

10:58.160 --> 11:02.080
by now-infamous games journalist Dean Takahashi.

11:02.080 --> 11:05.360
Cuphead and its like have created unexpected controversies

11:05.360 --> 11:10.560
about whether or not games journalists should have basic ability when it comes to playing games.

11:10.560 --> 11:14.000
The long and short of it is that Cuphead has become a jumping-off point

11:14.000 --> 11:19.280
for a full-scale attack on difficult and exclusionary games by the gaming press.

11:19.280 --> 11:20.720
As the argument goes,

11:20.720 --> 11:25.440
games that are difficult rob lesser skilled players of the chance to complete them,

11:25.440 --> 11:27.760
therefore making them exclusionary.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.280
Now, if we click on that link there,

11:29.280 --> 11:33.120
we're taken to a Polygon article written by Ben Kuchira entitled

11:33.120 --> 11:35.680
When is Exclusion a Valid Design Choice?

11:35.680 --> 11:37.440
So, is this it?

11:37.440 --> 11:38.960
Have we found it, finally?

11:38.960 --> 11:44.400
Is this the full-scale attack by games journalists dead set on attacking difficult games?

11:45.040 --> 11:45.540
Well...

11:46.320 --> 11:46.820
No.

11:47.200 --> 11:51.520
Cheeky Scrump is being rather misleading about the content of this Polygon article

11:51.520 --> 11:53.680
in a way that, in my opinion,

11:53.680 --> 11:59.440
perfectly illustrates how a lot of people online simply don't know how to read properly.

11:59.440 --> 12:03.040
So, let's take a look at this Polygon article and how it's written.

12:03.040 --> 12:06.400
It starts out with the headline, which is a question,

12:06.400 --> 12:08.720
When is Exclusion a Valid Design Choice?

12:09.360 --> 12:12.080
And it proposes another in its first paragraph,

12:12.080 --> 12:15.840
Are you owed the act of finishing a game because you bought it?

12:15.840 --> 12:18.960
Now, this article is an attempt to answer those questions,

12:18.960 --> 12:21.360
and it presents multiple viewpoints.

12:21.360 --> 12:23.680
As an example, it at one point states,

12:23.680 --> 12:28.000
The difficulty will turn some people off, and those people never get to see that art.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.480
They will never get to enjoy those animations.

12:30.480 --> 12:33.040
The design of the game itself keeps them out.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.920
When the addition of an easy mode or option to skip the bosses

12:35.920 --> 12:39.120
would allow everyone to see as much or as little as they want.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.920
So why are so many people against this idea?

12:41.920 --> 12:45.360
And following that, it offers an opposing argument.

12:45.360 --> 12:48.880
And yet the difficulty is part of the experience of playing Cuphead.

12:48.880 --> 12:52.000
Difficult games create an emotional reaction in the player,

12:52.000 --> 12:55.040
and that reaction might be the point of the difficulty.

12:55.040 --> 12:58.400
So if a game is designed to be played in a very particular way,

12:58.400 --> 13:01.600
and Cuphead asks you to treat failure as a chance to learn

13:01.600 --> 13:04.160
and rewards repetition and memorization,

13:04.160 --> 13:09.280
aren't you subverting those goals by asking for a mode that removes that method of play?

13:09.280 --> 13:11.520
I hope you're able to see my point here.

13:11.520 --> 13:14.800
This article is discussing something.

13:14.800 --> 13:20.240
It proposes a question, then shows multiple viewpoints and presents arguments for each.

13:20.800 --> 13:25.600
This article isn't attacking Cuphead or difficult games in general.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.720
It's just discussing an issue related to them.

13:29.280 --> 13:32.320
So how would one misread this article?

13:32.320 --> 13:36.160
Well, you'd see the title, which has the word exclusion in it,

13:36.160 --> 13:41.680
and then you'd just smash that into your pre-existing idea of what games journalists want and think,

13:41.680 --> 13:46.880
and come to the conclusion that the point of the article was that Cuphead is ableist trash

13:46.880 --> 13:51.760
and the developers should only make walking simulators about lesbians from now on.

13:51.760 --> 13:52.480
Obviously.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.720
It's silly, but it genuinely is how a lot of folks appear to read.

13:56.720 --> 14:01.440
You know, seeing the headline and then just imagining the rest of the text.

14:01.440 --> 14:05.040
For another example of someone playing the headline guessing game,

14:05.040 --> 14:09.760
let's return to Ian Miles-Chong, who on November 12th posted the following tweet.

14:10.400 --> 14:14.160
Here come the attacks on Cuphead and how it's racist.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.160
And he shows pictures of two articles.

14:16.720 --> 14:20.480
He doesn't link to them, obviously, he just shows screenshots of the headlines,

14:20.480 --> 14:22.960
because after all, that's all you need.

14:22.960 --> 14:28.000
So then, Cuphead is not just ableist, it's also racist, apparently.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.760
Now, the first article is from a site called Kotaku,

14:31.760 --> 14:32.800
and it's entitled,

14:32.800 --> 14:36.880
It's Impossible to Separate Cuphead from the Era That Inspired It,

14:36.880 --> 14:40.240
which is itself mainly just sharing the article in the second image,

14:40.240 --> 14:43.040
which is Cuphead and the Racist Specter of...

14:44.080 --> 14:46.080
Fleischer animation?

14:46.080 --> 14:47.360
I'm gonna go with Fleischer.

14:48.160 --> 14:51.680
That's written by Yusef Kohl from the website Unwinnable.

14:51.680 --> 14:54.560
And that's an interesting article, which I'll link in the description.

14:55.120 --> 14:56.800
I'd encourage you to take a look at it.

14:56.800 --> 15:03.200
But for now, of note here, is that neither of these articles actually call Cuphead racist.

15:03.200 --> 15:08.480
They say that its animation is a recreation of an early 20th century animation style that was,

15:09.040 --> 15:12.240
at the time, frequently very racist.

15:12.240 --> 15:15.840
And they go on to discuss the implications and the meaning of that.

15:15.840 --> 15:19.040
Now, first of all, it's odd that Ian Miles-Chong would say,

15:19.040 --> 15:22.160
Here come the attacks on Cuphead and how it's racist,

15:22.160 --> 15:27.440
considering that concerns about its animation style had been raised as early as 2014,

15:27.440 --> 15:29.840
with one journalist in particular stating that

15:29.840 --> 15:35.200
Cuphead's character designs seem like callbacks to some really problematic racial caricatures

15:35.200 --> 15:36.640
from the 1930s.

15:37.280 --> 15:39.040
Not sure what to think of them.

15:39.040 --> 15:42.640
That journalist there being Ian Miles-Chong.

15:42.640 --> 15:45.040
Twitter user Zach Smith responded,

15:45.040 --> 15:46.560
Disagree completely.

15:46.560 --> 15:48.720
Why do people over-analyze everything?

15:48.720 --> 15:50.400
To which Ian responds,

15:50.400 --> 15:54.480
Because it's important to look at the world with a critical eye.

15:54.480 --> 15:58.560
That was before the ant colony decided to nest in his head, I guess.

15:58.560 --> 16:02.000
So, is 2014 Ian Miles-Chong correct?

16:02.000 --> 16:04.400
Well, I decided to do a little investigating

16:04.400 --> 16:06.960
and watched a bunch of old animations from the time.

16:06.960 --> 16:11.280
Now, fair warning here, I'm about to show some very racist stuff.

16:11.280 --> 16:14.480
I mean, some of this shit is just absolutely dreadful.

16:14.560 --> 16:18.560
Now, okay, a lot of people back then were super racist,

16:18.560 --> 16:20.480
and so was their entertainment.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.520
We know that.

16:21.520 --> 16:25.840
And if the animation style was all that linked Cuphead to these cartoons,

16:25.840 --> 16:27.760
I'd consider this kind of a stretch.

16:28.320 --> 16:32.000
But honestly, the animation is only one part of it.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.440
Cuphead shares a lot of other similarities with these cartoons,

16:35.440 --> 16:37.760
and some of them are rather awkward.

16:37.760 --> 16:40.160
So let's take a look at a few of these similarities.

16:40.960 --> 16:44.240
First of all, Cuphead and Mugman are gamblers,

16:44.240 --> 16:48.480
who, tempted by easy riches, play dice with the devil,

16:48.480 --> 16:50.160
and then have to be punished.

16:50.160 --> 16:53.360
And this gambling motif comes up time and time again

16:53.360 --> 16:56.560
in relation to the crude African-American caricatures

16:56.560 --> 16:58.400
in these cartoons from the period.

16:58.960 --> 17:02.560
For example, all this and rabbit stew features Bugs Bunny

17:02.560 --> 17:05.600
using a pair of dice to hypnotize a rabbit hunter.

17:05.680 --> 17:08.960
Now, now, now, now, wait a minute, Doc. Relax.

17:08.960 --> 17:10.720
Now, now, now, hold it a minute.

17:15.440 --> 17:17.040
What's y'all got there, man?

17:17.680 --> 17:21.280
It's couldn't be a pair of them.

17:23.440 --> 17:26.960
And this is something that's repeated in the cartoon Angel Puss.

17:35.600 --> 17:44.800
A supposedly comedic cartoon version of Uncle Tom's Bungalow

17:44.800 --> 17:48.080
ends with the titular character purchasing his freedom.

17:48.080 --> 17:49.840
And how could he afford to do that?

17:50.400 --> 17:54.640
Well, he got rich with a pair of loaded dice, obviously.

17:54.640 --> 17:57.840
The cartoon Clean Pastures has a group of angels

17:57.840 --> 18:00.800
trying to entice the residents of cartoon Harlem

18:00.800 --> 18:03.040
to go to Parodice.

18:04.080 --> 18:07.120
Parodice. Get it? It's like paradise.

18:07.840 --> 18:12.480
And a cartoon called Coal Black and the Seven Dwarves, get it,

18:13.360 --> 18:15.680
has this guy with dice for teeth.

18:16.480 --> 18:17.760
What is it with the dice?

18:18.640 --> 18:23.040
Anyway, the cartoon I watched that was most relevant to Cuphead here

18:23.040 --> 18:25.280
is Sunday Go to Meeting Time,

18:25.280 --> 18:29.920
which besides being fucking racist as balls, obviously,

18:30.480 --> 18:34.080
features a story that is pretty close to the one in Cuphead.

18:34.080 --> 18:38.560
In that cartoon, various caricatured black people are heading to a church.

18:39.520 --> 18:40.160
Oh, God.

18:40.880 --> 18:44.800
All except the main character, who's playing dice,

18:44.800 --> 18:46.880
if you can believe it, behind a fence,

18:46.880 --> 18:50.000
before being admonished by a different racist stereotype.

18:50.640 --> 18:53.920
Later slipping out of church to steal chickens,

18:54.640 --> 18:57.840
the characters hit on the head and experiences a vision

18:57.840 --> 19:01.120
of being sent to hell to answer for his various crimes,

19:01.120 --> 19:06.240
including playing dice, obviously, and stealing watermelons.

19:07.200 --> 19:07.840
Fucking hell.

19:08.560 --> 19:11.760
The main character then meets the devil, who sings a song.

19:12.720 --> 19:31.680
Now, if you're watching this and you've played Cuphead,

19:31.680 --> 19:34.880
you'll have noticed many similarities here.

19:34.880 --> 19:36.720
It's not just the animation.

19:41.760 --> 19:52.880
You see, what the Cuphead developers have done is watched these cartoons and said,

19:52.880 --> 19:55.680
well, we love the music, the dice,

19:55.680 --> 19:59.520
the main characters being punished for irresponsible gambling,

19:59.520 --> 20:00.960
the cartoon devil.

20:00.960 --> 20:04.720
The way the cartoon devil leans in like that is how he gets all big.

20:05.280 --> 20:10.560
You know, all these trappings that were designed and utilized at the time to mock black people.

20:11.120 --> 20:12.400
We love all them.

20:12.400 --> 20:15.120
We just don't like the caricatures themselves.

20:15.120 --> 20:20.160
So we'll swap out the stereotype for a little cartoon cup man instead,

20:20.160 --> 20:21.200
and we're good to go.

20:21.760 --> 20:26.720
Speaking to Kotaku, game designer Chad Moldenhauer said,

20:26.720 --> 20:29.920
we went into the game knowing that what we wanted from the era

20:29.920 --> 20:34.400
was the technical artistic merit while leaving all the garbage behind.

20:35.600 --> 20:38.240
But to what extent can that be done?

20:38.240 --> 20:42.640
You know, is it possible to fully extract the caricature from the environment?

20:42.640 --> 20:43.680
I guess is the question.

20:44.320 --> 20:48.880
Now, to be fair, these cartoons are only a part of Cuphead's design influences.

20:48.880 --> 20:54.720
There's some Tom and Jerry in there, some Popeye, Betty Boop, and so on.

20:54.720 --> 20:58.240
But the racist cartoons had their influence too.

20:58.240 --> 21:02.400
The guy with the dice for a head singing that the devil has his price,

21:02.400 --> 21:05.360
he could have stepped right out of one of these cartoons.

21:05.360 --> 21:10.400
And that's, well, I don't know, it's worthy of a conversation, isn't it?

21:10.960 --> 21:15.600
You know, for someone with knowledge of these racist cartoons to play Cuphead

21:15.600 --> 21:18.800
and be reminded of them and made to feel uncomfortable,

21:18.800 --> 21:21.920
well, that's a perfectly legitimate reaction, honestly.

21:21.920 --> 21:24.800
And I'm certainly not going to argue with those people.

21:24.800 --> 21:28.320
Again, I'm not attacking Cuphead here.

21:28.320 --> 21:29.760
I like Cuphead.

21:29.760 --> 21:32.080
I'm just talking about it.

21:32.080 --> 21:34.480
And I feel the need to reiterate that right now

21:34.480 --> 21:36.720
because of something else I saw on Twitter.

21:37.440 --> 21:40.960
Video game designer Mark Kern is one of the people on the

21:40.960 --> 21:46.000
making up things about games journalists to justify hating them bandwagon.

21:46.000 --> 21:51.440
And he's tweeted a whole bunch of times about how everyone is calling Cuphead racist.

21:51.440 --> 21:53.600
And apparently, he was getting called out for that

21:53.600 --> 21:57.120
because on November 12th, he posted the following sarcastic tweet.

21:57.760 --> 22:01.520
Yes, nobody is saying Cuphead is racist.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.280
I'm making it all up.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.840
And let's take a look at the picture he's responding to,

22:05.840 --> 22:09.200
which is apparently evidence for him not making it all up.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.840
And it's from a Twitter conversation which reads like this.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.320
Peter L. Newton says,

22:14.320 --> 22:16.480
I'm not personally upset by this game,

22:16.480 --> 22:20.880
but the developers can't be naive about the origins of their art style either.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.880
They know when it's from and what happened then.

22:23.440 --> 22:26.000
Downplaying it is what I find disrespectful.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.400
Steven Whittle then responds,

22:29.120 --> 22:31.280
This is an issue I have when teaching.

22:31.280 --> 22:34.800
Students who ignore context of what they use slash appropriate

22:34.800 --> 22:39.040
and don't understand that ignoring a problematic meaning doesn't make it go away.

22:39.760 --> 22:42.480
My games don't have a message doesn't fly,

22:42.480 --> 22:45.040
especially with regards to procedural rhetoric.

22:45.680 --> 22:46.720
That being said,

22:46.720 --> 22:49.440
I'm uncertain how they could have used those motifs

22:49.440 --> 22:51.920
without it being problematic in some way or another.

22:52.560 --> 22:54.320
Then Kay Sheely adds,

22:54.320 --> 22:56.960
The thing that bothers me is not the art style itself,

22:56.960 --> 22:59.680
but that the developers said they're not even interested

22:59.680 --> 23:02.800
in talking about its history, which feels irresponsible to me.

23:03.440 --> 23:03.920
Now then,

23:04.480 --> 23:08.400
none of these people were attacking Cuphead right here.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.400
They weren't calling for it to be banned

23:10.400 --> 23:13.120
or saying the developers are terrible people

23:13.120 --> 23:15.920
or that you're racist if you like Cuphead

23:15.920 --> 23:19.760
or any other ridiculous, extrapolated nonsense.

23:19.760 --> 23:24.720
They're just talking about the game and its design elements and its development.

23:24.720 --> 23:25.440
And that's all.

23:26.240 --> 23:29.200
That someone like Mark Kern can read this discussion

23:29.200 --> 23:34.640
and have Cuphead is racist be his only takeaway from it is really disappointing.

23:34.640 --> 23:38.960
I'm of the opinion that art is anything that people treat like art,

23:38.960 --> 23:43.840
and we, as gamers, should be willing to at least entertain these sorts of discussions,

23:43.840 --> 23:45.280
even if we disagree.

23:45.280 --> 23:48.560
It's not hurting anyone, is it, to have this conversation.

23:49.200 --> 23:53.120
The real divide here isn't between gamers and games journalists,

23:53.120 --> 23:56.880
it's between people who are prepared to have conversations about gaming

23:56.880 --> 24:00.720
as if it's a real art form deserving of thoughtful criticism,

24:00.720 --> 24:05.440
and people who mistake that criticism for insult and overreact to it.

24:05.440 --> 24:10.080
To certain folks, though, this polite conversation about Cuphead's art style

24:10.080 --> 24:13.920
will always read as an outraged accusation of racism,

24:13.920 --> 24:16.960
and this balanced discussion about difficulty levels

24:16.960 --> 24:20.080
will be read as an outraged accusation of ableism.

24:20.640 --> 24:22.720
And I'm not sure there's anything I could say here

24:22.720 --> 24:25.280
to get them to take a more nuanced look, really.

24:25.280 --> 24:28.640
It's in their financial interest to imagine outrage

24:28.640 --> 24:30.880
in order to be outraged about it.

24:30.880 --> 24:34.240
And to loop back around to our pal AlphaOmegaSin for a second,

24:34.240 --> 24:39.200
a little sketch he performs in his video illustrates the hypocrisy of this pretty nicely.

24:39.200 --> 24:43.680
I would love to see these motherfuckers somehow sit at a table with people

24:43.680 --> 24:47.120
that are actually dying of illness,

24:47.120 --> 24:48.720
and try to explain to them,

24:48.720 --> 24:53.520
oh, man, well, I see that you've only got mere weeks to live because, well,

24:53.520 --> 24:57.600
what you're currently dealing with is incurable,

24:57.600 --> 25:00.080
but I was playing Cuphead.

25:00.080 --> 25:04.000
You know, I'm really sorry that your family's off in a separate room

25:04.000 --> 25:06.880
and they're crying their eyes out and they don't know what to do

25:06.880 --> 25:09.280
because you were actually the breadwinner of the family,

25:09.280 --> 25:12.080
and unfortunately, they aren't going to be able to make ends meet

25:12.080 --> 25:15.200
and they're going to have somebody that is kind of the glue of the family

25:15.200 --> 25:19.120
is going to end up having to leave them, but Cuphead's really difficult.

25:19.120 --> 25:23.440
So he imagines one of these people going up to someone with a terminal

25:23.920 --> 25:27.440
and complaining about Cuphead's difficulty to, I suppose,

25:27.440 --> 25:30.880
illustrate the relative triviality of that complaint.

25:30.880 --> 25:34.560
What he doesn't somehow see is how easily he and his complaints

25:34.560 --> 25:37.120
can be inserted into that same sketch.

25:37.120 --> 25:40.080
Imagine going up to someone with a terminal illness and saying,

25:40.080 --> 25:43.120
sorry, I know you're about to die and your family's sad

25:43.120 --> 25:45.200
because you're the breadwinner and everything,

25:46.240 --> 25:48.800
but some people called a video game ableist.

25:49.440 --> 25:53.120
That's what I'm choosing to spend my time being outraged about.

25:53.120 --> 25:57.200
And before wrapping up here, I'd like to highlight this tweet from Cheeky Scrump,

25:57.200 --> 26:00.400
the author of the earlier article shared by Ian Miles-Chong.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.080
And I quote,

26:02.080 --> 26:06.160
The rich kid who used to laugh at you for wearing a Mario t-shirt in high school

26:06.160 --> 26:09.600
now rents a two million dollar apartment in San Francisco

26:09.600 --> 26:11.120
where they pretend to be poor

26:11.120 --> 26:14.080
and write about how they're a real fan of video games,

26:14.080 --> 26:16.080
not these toxic gamers.

26:16.080 --> 26:18.160
Now, this is obviously a very silly point,

26:18.160 --> 26:21.760
but it does expose the thinking behind a part of the gamer side

26:21.760 --> 26:24.720
of the gamer-games journalist divide.

26:24.720 --> 26:28.080
I've spoken previously about how self-identified gamers

26:28.080 --> 26:31.360
have attempted to adopt the language of oppressed groups.

26:31.360 --> 26:33.440
Well, what this is right here is an example

26:33.440 --> 26:37.120
of gamers clumsily having a go at class concepts.

26:37.120 --> 26:40.320
And it reminds me of that amazing Gamergate era image

26:40.320 --> 26:44.320
showing the impoverished gamers holding up the rich games journalists

26:44.320 --> 26:47.360
and critical theorist social justice warriors,

26:47.360 --> 26:48.480
which is just wonderful.

26:49.120 --> 26:52.720
Gamers who see games journalists as out-of-touch millionaires

26:52.720 --> 26:55.920
ruining games while sipping champagne in their mansions

26:55.920 --> 26:59.200
are arguably, in microcosm anyway,

26:59.200 --> 27:01.520
carrying out a criticism of capitalism,

27:01.520 --> 27:03.440
albeit a deeply flawed one.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.320
They're acting as the oppressed workers

27:06.320 --> 27:10.080
and have incorrectly positioned journalists, for some reason,

27:10.080 --> 27:11.680
as the rich taskmasters.

27:12.240 --> 27:15.520
So when Dean Takahashi is shown to be bad at a video game,

27:15.520 --> 27:19.440
it's thus a deeply upsetting breach of the natural order.

27:19.440 --> 27:22.400
You know, the capital-G gamers react to that much like

27:22.400 --> 27:25.120
we would all react to finding out a billionaire banker

27:25.120 --> 27:27.360
wasn't paying any taxes or something.

27:27.360 --> 27:28.400
How outrageous.

27:28.400 --> 27:30.880
You know, that's not how things are supposed to work.

27:30.880 --> 27:34.240
And their explanation is the standard liberal failing

27:34.240 --> 27:36.160
when criticizing capitalism.

27:36.160 --> 27:38.400
You know, the wrong people are at the top.

27:38.960 --> 27:40.640
Fire Dean Takahashi.

27:41.200 --> 27:42.240
Get rid of him.

27:42.240 --> 27:44.960
And fire any other journalists who supported him.

27:44.960 --> 27:47.840
You know, there's no such thing as a systemic problem.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.160
It's just that the wrong people are in charge.

27:51.360 --> 27:53.920
How did they get the idea that games journalists

27:53.920 --> 27:56.000
are in charge of anything?

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
No offense to games journalists here.

27:58.560 --> 28:01.200
And how many layers of this metaphor are we on now?

28:01.200 --> 28:01.920
I've lost track.

28:02.560 --> 28:05.360
Let's try and extract ourselves from it, I think.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.920
So what's my overall point here?

28:08.560 --> 28:10.320
I don't know anymore, to be honest.

28:10.320 --> 28:12.880
Maybe it's gamers should learn a bit more

28:12.880 --> 28:14.720
about the world outside gaming.

28:15.920 --> 28:16.880
Probably.

28:16.880 --> 28:19.440
I feel like a lot of capital-G gamers

28:19.440 --> 28:21.280
are so threatened by journalism

28:21.280 --> 28:24.480
that simply asks questions or sparks debate

28:24.480 --> 28:26.960
because they'd rather be totally passive

28:26.960 --> 28:28.800
and uncritical consumers

28:28.800 --> 28:31.600
of a predictable and unchanging product.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.760
And any hint of outside influence

28:33.760 --> 28:37.360
possibly interfering with the imagined purity of that product

28:37.360 --> 28:41.360
and its creation process is taken as an outraged attack.

28:41.360 --> 28:44.080
Or maybe it's simply being reminded of the fact

28:44.080 --> 28:46.720
that games even have a creation process at all

28:46.720 --> 28:48.640
that's so infuriating for them.

28:48.640 --> 28:52.720
You know, games aren't created in a process by artists.

28:52.720 --> 28:53.680
They just happen.

28:54.240 --> 28:57.120
And we, as gamers, buy them.

28:57.120 --> 28:59.360
And games journalists only exist

28:59.360 --> 29:01.040
to give every game a high score

29:01.040 --> 29:03.760
and provide us with a sense of shared experience

29:03.760 --> 29:06.720
and reassurance in our enjoyment of the medium.

29:07.280 --> 29:08.800
We don't just want to have fun.

29:09.360 --> 29:11.840
We need to be told we're having fun.

29:11.840 --> 29:13.840
And anyone theorizing about things

29:13.840 --> 29:15.680
possibly being done differently

29:15.680 --> 29:18.240
is just ruining the fantasy, really.

29:18.240 --> 29:20.080
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

29:20.080 --> 29:22.000
Now, any sharp-eyed fans out there

29:22.000 --> 29:24.480
will have noticed that in my last video that went out,

29:24.480 --> 29:26.000
I said in my next video,

29:26.000 --> 29:29.040
I was going to be talking about anti-feminist YouTube.

29:29.040 --> 29:31.840
And then this video was about Cuphead instead.

29:31.840 --> 29:33.120
So what happened there?

29:33.920 --> 29:37.120
Well, this video was originally a segment from that video

29:37.120 --> 29:39.120
which is about the practice of making up

29:39.120 --> 29:41.840
an imaginary enemy to be outraged about.

29:41.840 --> 29:43.280
And as such, you'll have noticed

29:43.280 --> 29:44.640
quite a lot of that in this video.

29:44.640 --> 29:46.240
You know, gamers making up things

29:46.240 --> 29:48.080
about games journalists and all that.

29:48.960 --> 29:50.480
But as you can tell from the length,

29:50.480 --> 29:52.800
this Cuphead section was getting a bit unwieldy,

29:52.800 --> 29:55.200
so I decided to make it its own thing.

29:55.200 --> 29:56.800
That video is still in the works.

29:56.800 --> 29:59.280
It's probably not going to be my next release,

29:59.280 --> 30:02.320
but maybe next month or early in January.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.080
January?

30:04.080 --> 30:04.800
Wow.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.040
This year has really flown by, hasn't it?

30:07.600 --> 30:10.960
Time flies when everyone is miserable

30:10.960 --> 30:13.840
and only terrible things happen, apparently.

30:15.200 --> 30:16.800
Thanks as always to my patrons

30:16.800 --> 30:18.480
who should be scrolling by right now,

30:19.120 --> 30:20.800
possibly for the last time.

30:21.360 --> 30:22.800
There's getting a few too many of them

30:22.800 --> 30:25.120
to scroll by in a reasonable time lately,

30:25.120 --> 30:27.120
so I think I'm going to have to switch it up.

30:27.760 --> 30:30.320
I might do a series of static text boxes.

30:31.040 --> 30:32.560
That's something I might try out.

30:32.560 --> 30:34.960
Or maybe I'll set appearing in the credits

30:34.960 --> 30:37.120
as a tier reward or something, I don't know.

30:37.840 --> 30:39.840
Having too many patrons to manage

30:39.840 --> 30:43.200
is one of those good problems to have, though, I guess.

30:43.200 --> 30:46.080
So thank you all again, sincerely,

30:46.080 --> 30:47.440
and I'll see you next time.
