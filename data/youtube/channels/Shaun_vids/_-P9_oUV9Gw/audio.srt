00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about Cuphead,

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:10,880
and more specifically, a few completely real controversies related to Cuphead that definitely happened and matter.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,680
But first of all, what is Cuphead?

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,920
Well, it's a video game. A rather good video game, in my opinion.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:25,600
It's a side-scrolling run-and-gun game in which players control the titular Cuphead with his pal Mugman in co-op mode.

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,560
Now, Cuphead and Mugman are both in trouble after finding themselves on the wrong side of the tracks

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,680
and losing a dice in the Devil's Casino.

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,160
Indebted to the Devil, the duo have to track down the Devil's runaway debtors and collect their soul contracts for him.

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,760
It's a pretty neat game, and I'd recommend playing it if you haven't.

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,440
It has a reputation for difficulty, apparently, but I beat it fairly easily, to be honest,

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,680
and it didn't even take me that long, either.

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,600
But then again, I am brilliant at the computer games, and thus have earned the right to talk about them.

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,600
So, given that I'm not a game review channel, you might be wondering,

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,840
why am I talking about Cuphead?

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,960
And that's because Cuphead is racist, ableist, and out-of-touch elitist games journalists all hate it,

16
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,560
because it's too difficult.

17
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:28,560
You know, Cuphead is racist! That game is, it's animation styled, it's based around those racist cartoons from the 1930s and 40s,

18
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,320
so clearly the game is the embodiment of racism!

19
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,160
Oh, I can one-up that! It's actually ableist!

20
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:43,280
That's right, it's ableism, and it's just in its most concentrated form, in a form of interactive entertainment!

21
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,120
And then I had to go and just shut the shit off, and take a couple steps away from my social media feed,

22
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:57,040
because no matter where I went, every single fucking corner of the internet was caked with shit sticking to a wall,

23
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,520
so fucking bad that even the flies decided, you know what, I can go elsewhere.

24
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,600
This is the kind of stuff that I was seeing all the time, based around Cuphead.

25
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:14,960
That's a ranty chap called Alpha Omega Sin, telling his half a million subscribers about the hatred Cuphead is apparently receiving all the time,

26
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,840
in every single corner of the internet.

27
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,320
And he certainly seems rather worked up about it, so I'm sure it is actually happening,

28
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:28,800
but I have to ask, for the sake of argument, who is it who is actually attacking Cuphead?

29
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Who are these scoundrels?

30
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,960
And this is a game that I got to play, and I enjoyed the living fuck out of,

31
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:42,240
yet now due to the game's difficulty, because it's actually a challenging game, not fucking impossible,

32
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:48,400
an actual challenging game, they think that, huh, that's ableist!

33
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,080
And they think because of the art style that it is racist,

34
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,280
literally just haphazardly applying fucking labels wherever they see fit,

35
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,720
and this is gamers and journalists that are saying this kind of shit.

36
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,240
You've got to be fucking kidding me that this is what's happening.

37
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:16,480
A game does not deserve this kind of bullshit, yet it's happening anyway.

38
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,040
It's happening anyway, apparently.

39
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,200
So it's fake gamers and air quotes journalists who've been attacking Cuphead then.

40
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,240
Now, Mr. Alpha Omega-Sen rants for a solid 16 minutes in much the same vein as what you've seen,

41
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,600
but at no point actually identifies who it is specifically he's shouting about.

42
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,600
He does a lot of impressions of imaginary silly people calling Cuphead racist,

43
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,840
and refers to a nebulous they a lot of times, but never actually calls out anyone in particular,

44
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,360
and that makes the comments under his video rather confusing.

45
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,040
Here's a few examples.

46
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,720
Alex Barranco says,

47
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,200
...back into the Dark Ages, and we could just start over.

48
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,880
SJW would not last long in that kind of world.

49
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,480
Fucking Christ.

50
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,280
And Lilith, aka the Firehawk, says,

51
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,320
These people. And this is something you see over and over again in these comments.

52
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,000
These people. These people. These people.

53
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,920
Dude, I didn't know until I saw this video that people were saying this shit.

54
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,000
I totally agree with you, Alpha. These people are dumb.

55
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,800
And, like, who?

56
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,720
Who are they all talking about? You know, who are these people?

57
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,640
How did this happen?

58
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,640
How is it that this guy can whip up his audience into such a rage

59
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:20,000
that they're wishing for every sort of violence up to and including nuclear annihilation?

60
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,920
Directed at a completely undefined enemy.

61
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,560
Is it me, or is that rather odd?

62
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,520
So what we're gonna do today is try to figure out how Cuphead became the latest battlefield

63
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,880
for capital-G gamers on one side, and quote,

64
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,120
...these people on the other.

65
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,880
And along the way, we'll see if we can find any examples of these people

66
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,160
and see what, if anything, they've actually said about Cuphead.

67
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,480
So to start off here,

68
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,520
back in August at the Gamescom event in Germany,

69
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,080
a VentureBeat writer named Dean Takahashi played a preview version of Cuphead

70
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,160
in order to write an article about it.

71
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,840
The footage of his attempt was uploaded to VentureBeat's YouTube channel,

72
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,880
and his below-average gameplay garnered some...

73
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,920
...attention, shall we say.

74
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,040
Now, Takahashi's article acknowledges his poor performance,

75
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,760
starting out,

76
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,560
"...I suck at Cuphead, let's get this out of the way,"

77
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,600
and later saying,

78
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,800
"...go ahead, laugh your heart out at my expense.

79
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,000
While my performance on the captured video below is quite shameful,

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,760
as I never finished the level,

81
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,160
I think it shows quite well why Cuphead is fun,

82
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,240
and why making hard games that depend on skill is like a lost art."

83
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,240
So, you know, what happened here?

84
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,840
A dude was bad at a video game for half an hour.

85
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,480
He blames his own poor play, not the game.

86
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,920
He calls it fun.

87
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,960
He's self-deprecatingly good-natured about it,

88
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,560
you know, posting the video online,

89
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,200
because it's funny that he sucks at the game.

90
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,080
And he's also not reviewing the game, by the way.

91
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,040
He just previewed it for a bit at a games expo.

92
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,600
A different journalist at VentureBeat wrote the actual review of Cuphead on the site,

93
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,000
giving it a score of 85 out of 100,

94
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,480
and saying,

95
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,320
"...these days, beating a game sometimes doesn't feel like much of an actual achievement,

96
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,920
but I was happy and proud when I killed the last boss in Cuphead.

97
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,440
The fact that it was so hard made it so rewarding."

98
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,280
And Dean Takahashi later posted a short video of him playing

99
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,240
and beating the level that he had earlier struggled with,

100
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,360
so well done to Dean for improving, I guess.

101
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,880
So why is this all a thing?

102
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,480
Well, about that attention I mentioned earlier,

103
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:32,560
lots of folks reacted rather poorly to some guy being bad at a video game.

104
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,720
For example, air quotes journalist Ian Miles Prower Chong

105
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,200
got some ads in his pants about the situation,

106
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,700
saying,

107
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,520
"...games journalists are incredibly bad at video games.

108
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,520
It's painful to watch this.

109
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,480
How do they think they're qualified to write about games?

110
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,560
How can a paid professional games journalist be this bad at video games?

111
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,520
Dean Takahashi spent 26 minutes playing the first level

112
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,680
and never got past the starting area.

113
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,360
I don't know how it's possible to rely on the recommendations of game journalists

114
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,160
when they don't even have basic reflexes needed to play."

115
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,920
It explains why they're all enamored with walking simulators,

116
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,680
no skill necessary, just press W and the game will take care of itself,

117
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,760
and so on and so forth.

118
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,000
So that's quite the extrapolation there.

119
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,440
Dean Takahashi, the singular person being bad at Cuphead for a bit at a games expo,

120
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,240
is now all games journalists being terrible at all games all the time

121
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,160
and engaging in some conspiracy to promote walking simulators or something.

122
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,520
All this despite Takahashi's preview of the game

123
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,400
and the later actual review on the site, both praising Cuphead's difficulty.

124
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Chong's take was popular though,

125
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,720
with more than 12,000 people sharing his tweet mocking Takahashi's gameplay

126
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,080
and detached theorizing about walking simulators.

127
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,120
And so begins the curse of the numbers.

128
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,320
The VentureBeat video received over a million views.

129
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,640
PewDiePie put out a video where he reacts rather obnoxiously to that video,

130
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,760
which has over six million views at the time of writing this

131
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,320
and another one that has over four million.

132
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,000
Some channel called Rags put out the Cuphead Chronicles,

133
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,920
gamers versus journalists mocking Takahashi's gameplay to a couple of hundred thousand viewers.

134
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,800
So Cuphead is the hot topic to argue about,

135
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,120
so we keep talking about it until it doesn't get us attention anymore.

136
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,920
That's how YouTube works, folks.

137
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,360
And not to skip ahead too much,

138
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,080
but if nobody is actually saying anything worthwhile creating a ranty response to,

139
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,520
for example, if nobody is calling Cuphead racist,

140
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,920
you can just pretend they are and your audience will believe you anyway.

141
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,840
But let's get back on track.

142
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,680
So on October 29th,

143
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,760
Ian Miles Chong shared an article on a site called Super Nerd Land

144
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,320
written by Twitter user Cheeky Scrump,

145
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,800
and that's called Postmortem, the Dark Souls of Games Reviews.

146
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,160
And when Cheeky Scrump posted this article to Twitter, they added,

147
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,080
Why are games journalists so dead set on attacking difficult games?

148
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,320
Because it benefits them.

149
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,320
But is it true that games journalists are dead set on attacking difficult games like Cuphead?

150
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,640
Well, I don't know about that, to be honest.

151
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,920
Cuphead has an 88 on Metacritic for a start.

152
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,560
It got five stars on Giant Bomb,

153
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,640
8.5 on Polygon,

154
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,560
8 out of 10 on GameSpot,

155
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,520
and so on.

156
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,480
And all these reviews praise the difficulty level.

157
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,400
Games journalists love Cuphead and its difficulty,

158
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,680
going by what they actually, you know, say about it.

159
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,640
So who are the games journalists who are apparently dead set on attacking difficult games?

160
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,880
You know, who are they?

161
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,440
Are they more of these people?

162
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,680
Well, let's read this article by Cheeky Scrump and see if we can find out.

163
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,320
And I quote,

164
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,480
Most recently, Cuphead, the much-hyped run-and-gun platformer

165
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,800
with a Golden Age-era cartoon aesthetic,

166
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,160
was described as somewhere between Mario and Dark Souls

167
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,080
by now-infamous games journalist Dean Takahashi.

168
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,360
Cuphead and its like have created unexpected controversies

169
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,560
about whether or not games journalists should have basic ability when it comes to playing games.

170
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,000
The long and short of it is that Cuphead has become a jumping-off point

171
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,280
for a full-scale attack on difficult and exclusionary games by the gaming press.

172
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,720
As the argument goes,

173
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,440
games that are difficult rob lesser skilled players of the chance to complete them,

174
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,760
therefore making them exclusionary.

175
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,280
Now, if we click on that link there,

176
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,120
we're taken to a Polygon article written by Ben Kuchira entitled

177
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,680
When is Exclusion a Valid Design Choice?

178
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,440
So, is this it?

179
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,960
Have we found it, finally?

180
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:44,400
Is this the full-scale attack by games journalists dead set on attacking difficult games?

181
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,540
Well...

182
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:46,820
No.

183
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,520
Cheeky Scrump is being rather misleading about the content of this Polygon article

184
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,680
in a way that, in my opinion,

185
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,440
perfectly illustrates how a lot of people online simply don't know how to read properly.

186
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,040
So, let's take a look at this Polygon article and how it's written.

187
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,400
It starts out with the headline, which is a question,

188
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,720
When is Exclusion a Valid Design Choice?

189
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,080
And it proposes another in its first paragraph,

190
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,840
Are you owed the act of finishing a game because you bought it?

191
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,960
Now, this article is an attempt to answer those questions,

192
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,360
and it presents multiple viewpoints.

193
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,680
As an example, it at one point states,

194
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,000
The difficulty will turn some people off, and those people never get to see that art.

195
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,480
They will never get to enjoy those animations.

196
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,040
The design of the game itself keeps them out.

197
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,920
When the addition of an easy mode or option to skip the bosses

198
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,120
would allow everyone to see as much or as little as they want.

199
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,920
So why are so many people against this idea?

200
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,360
And following that, it offers an opposing argument.

201
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,880
And yet the difficulty is part of the experience of playing Cuphead.

202
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,000
Difficult games create an emotional reaction in the player,

203
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,040
and that reaction might be the point of the difficulty.

204
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,400
So if a game is designed to be played in a very particular way,

205
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,600
and Cuphead asks you to treat failure as a chance to learn

206
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,160
and rewards repetition and memorization,

207
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,280
aren't you subverting those goals by asking for a mode that removes that method of play?

208
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,520
I hope you're able to see my point here.

209
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,800
This article is discussing something.

210
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,240
It proposes a question, then shows multiple viewpoints and presents arguments for each.

211
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,600
This article isn't attacking Cuphead or difficult games in general.

212
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,720
It's just discussing an issue related to them.

213
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,320
So how would one misread this article?

214
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,160
Well, you'd see the title, which has the word exclusion in it,

215
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,680
and then you'd just smash that into your pre-existing idea of what games journalists want and think,

216
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,880
and come to the conclusion that the point of the article was that Cuphead is ableist trash

217
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,760
and the developers should only make walking simulators about lesbians from now on.

218
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,480
Obviously.

219
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,720
It's silly, but it genuinely is how a lot of folks appear to read.

220
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,440
You know, seeing the headline and then just imagining the rest of the text.

221
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,040
For another example of someone playing the headline guessing game,

222
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,760
let's return to Ian Miles-Chong, who on November 12th posted the following tweet.

223
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,160
Here come the attacks on Cuphead and how it's racist.

224
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,160
And he shows pictures of two articles.

225
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,480
He doesn't link to them, obviously, he just shows screenshots of the headlines,

226
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,960
because after all, that's all you need.

227
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:28,000
So then, Cuphead is not just ableist, it's also racist, apparently.

228
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,760
Now, the first article is from a site called Kotaku,

229
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,800
and it's entitled,

230
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,880
It's Impossible to Separate Cuphead from the Era That Inspired It,

231
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,240
which is itself mainly just sharing the article in the second image,

232
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,040
which is Cuphead and the Racist Specter of...

233
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,080
Fleischer animation?

234
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,360
I'm gonna go with Fleischer.

235
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,680
That's written by Yusef Kohl from the website Unwinnable.

236
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,560
And that's an interesting article, which I'll link in the description.

237
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,800
I'd encourage you to take a look at it.

238
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:03,200
But for now, of note here, is that neither of these articles actually call Cuphead racist.

239
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:08,480
They say that its animation is a recreation of an early 20th century animation style that was,

240
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,240
at the time, frequently very racist.

241
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,840
And they go on to discuss the implications and the meaning of that.

242
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,040
Now, first of all, it's odd that Ian Miles-Chong would say,

243
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,160
Here come the attacks on Cuphead and how it's racist,

244
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,440
considering that concerns about its animation style had been raised as early as 2014,

245
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,840
with one journalist in particular stating that

246
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:35,200
Cuphead's character designs seem like callbacks to some really problematic racial caricatures

247
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,640
from the 1930s.

248
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,040
Not sure what to think of them.

249
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,640
That journalist there being Ian Miles-Chong.

250
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,040
Twitter user Zach Smith responded,

251
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,560
Disagree completely.

252
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,720
Why do people over-analyze everything?

253
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,400
To which Ian responds,

254
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,480
Because it's important to look at the world with a critical eye.

255
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,560
That was before the ant colony decided to nest in his head, I guess.

256
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,000
So, is 2014 Ian Miles-Chong correct?

257
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,400
Well, I decided to do a little investigating

258
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,960
and watched a bunch of old animations from the time.

259
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,280
Now, fair warning here, I'm about to show some very racist stuff.

260
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,480
I mean, some of this shit is just absolutely dreadful.

261
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,560
Now, okay, a lot of people back then were super racist,

262
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,480
and so was their entertainment.

263
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,520
We know that.

264
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,840
And if the animation style was all that linked Cuphead to these cartoons,

265
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,760
I'd consider this kind of a stretch.

266
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,000
But honestly, the animation is only one part of it.

267
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,440
Cuphead shares a lot of other similarities with these cartoons,

268
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,760
and some of them are rather awkward.

269
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,160
So let's take a look at a few of these similarities.

270
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,240
First of all, Cuphead and Mugman are gamblers,

271
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,480
who, tempted by easy riches, play dice with the devil,

272
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,160
and then have to be punished.

273
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,360
And this gambling motif comes up time and time again

274
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,560
in relation to the crude African-American caricatures

275
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,400
in these cartoons from the period.

276
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,560
For example, all this and rabbit stew features Bugs Bunny

277
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,600
using a pair of dice to hypnotize a rabbit hunter.

278
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,960
Now, now, now, now, wait a minute, Doc. Relax.

279
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,720
Now, now, now, hold it a minute.

280
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,040
What's y'all got there, man?

281
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,280
It's couldn't be a pair of them.

282
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,960
And this is something that's repeated in the cartoon Angel Puss.

283
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:44,800
A supposedly comedic cartoon version of Uncle Tom's Bungalow

284
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,080
ends with the titular character purchasing his freedom.

285
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,840
And how could he afford to do that?

286
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,640
Well, he got rich with a pair of loaded dice, obviously.

287
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,840
The cartoon Clean Pastures has a group of angels

288
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,800
trying to entice the residents of cartoon Harlem

289
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,040
to go to Parodice.

290
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,120
Parodice. Get it? It's like paradise.

291
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,480
And a cartoon called Coal Black and the Seven Dwarves, get it,

292
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,680
has this guy with dice for teeth.

293
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,760
What is it with the dice?

294
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,040
Anyway, the cartoon I watched that was most relevant to Cuphead here

295
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,280
is Sunday Go to Meeting Time,

296
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,920
which besides being fucking racist as balls, obviously,

297
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,080
features a story that is pretty close to the one in Cuphead.

298
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,560
In that cartoon, various caricatured black people are heading to a church.

299
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,160
Oh, God.

300
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,800
All except the main character, who's playing dice,

301
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,880
if you can believe it, behind a fence,

302
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,000
before being admonished by a different racist stereotype.

303
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,920
Later slipping out of church to steal chickens,

304
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,840
the characters hit on the head and experiences a vision

305
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,120
of being sent to hell to answer for his various crimes,

306
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,240
including playing dice, obviously, and stealing watermelons.

307
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:07,840
Fucking hell.

308
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,760
The main character then meets the devil, who sings a song.

309
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:31,680
Now, if you're watching this and you've played Cuphead,

310
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,880
you'll have noticed many similarities here.

311
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,720
It's not just the animation.

312
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:52,880
You see, what the Cuphead developers have done is watched these cartoons and said,

313
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,680
well, we love the music, the dice,

314
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,520
the main characters being punished for irresponsible gambling,

315
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,960
the cartoon devil.

316
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,720
The way the cartoon devil leans in like that is how he gets all big.

317
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,560
You know, all these trappings that were designed and utilized at the time to mock black people.

318
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,400
We love all them.

319
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,120
We just don't like the caricatures themselves.

320
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,160
So we'll swap out the stereotype for a little cartoon cup man instead,

321
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,200
and we're good to go.

322
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,720
Speaking to Kotaku, game designer Chad Moldenhauer said,

323
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,920
we went into the game knowing that what we wanted from the era

324
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,400
was the technical artistic merit while leaving all the garbage behind.

325
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,240
But to what extent can that be done?

326
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,640
You know, is it possible to fully extract the caricature from the environment?

327
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,680
I guess is the question.

328
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,880
Now, to be fair, these cartoons are only a part of Cuphead's design influences.

329
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,720
There's some Tom and Jerry in there, some Popeye, Betty Boop, and so on.

330
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,240
But the racist cartoons had their influence too.

331
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,400
The guy with the dice for a head singing that the devil has his price,

332
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,360
he could have stepped right out of one of these cartoons.

333
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,400
And that's, well, I don't know, it's worthy of a conversation, isn't it?

334
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,600
You know, for someone with knowledge of these racist cartoons to play Cuphead

335
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,800
and be reminded of them and made to feel uncomfortable,

336
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,920
well, that's a perfectly legitimate reaction, honestly.

337
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,800
And I'm certainly not going to argue with those people.

338
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,320
Again, I'm not attacking Cuphead here.

339
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,760
I like Cuphead.

340
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,080
I'm just talking about it.

341
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,480
And I feel the need to reiterate that right now

342
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,720
because of something else I saw on Twitter.

343
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,960
Video game designer Mark Kern is one of the people on the

344
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,000
making up things about games journalists to justify hating them bandwagon.

345
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,440
And he's tweeted a whole bunch of times about how everyone is calling Cuphead racist.

346
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,600
And apparently, he was getting called out for that

347
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,120
because on November 12th, he posted the following sarcastic tweet.

348
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,520
Yes, nobody is saying Cuphead is racist.

349
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,280
I'm making it all up.

350
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,840
And let's take a look at the picture he's responding to,

351
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,200
which is apparently evidence for him not making it all up.

352
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,840
And it's from a Twitter conversation which reads like this.

353
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,320
Peter L. Newton says,

354
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,480
I'm not personally upset by this game,

355
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,880
but the developers can't be naive about the origins of their art style either.

356
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,880
They know when it's from and what happened then.

357
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,000
Downplaying it is what I find disrespectful.

358
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,400
Steven Whittle then responds,

359
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,280
This is an issue I have when teaching.

360
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,800
Students who ignore context of what they use slash appropriate

361
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,040
and don't understand that ignoring a problematic meaning doesn't make it go away.

362
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,480
My games don't have a message doesn't fly,

363
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,040
especially with regards to procedural rhetoric.

364
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,720
That being said,

365
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,440
I'm uncertain how they could have used those motifs

366
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,920
without it being problematic in some way or another.

367
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,320
Then Kay Sheely adds,

368
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,960
The thing that bothers me is not the art style itself,

369
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,680
but that the developers said they're not even interested

370
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,800
in talking about its history, which feels irresponsible to me.

371
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:03,920
Now then,

372
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,400
none of these people were attacking Cuphead right here.

373
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,400
They weren't calling for it to be banned

374
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,120
or saying the developers are terrible people

375
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,920
or that you're racist if you like Cuphead

376
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,760
or any other ridiculous, extrapolated nonsense.

377
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,720
They're just talking about the game and its design elements and its development.

378
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,440
And that's all.

379
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,200
That someone like Mark Kern can read this discussion

380
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,640
and have Cuphead is racist be his only takeaway from it is really disappointing.

381
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,960
I'm of the opinion that art is anything that people treat like art,

382
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,840
and we, as gamers, should be willing to at least entertain these sorts of discussions,

383
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,280
even if we disagree.

384
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,560
It's not hurting anyone, is it, to have this conversation.

385
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,120
The real divide here isn't between gamers and games journalists,

386
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,880
it's between people who are prepared to have conversations about gaming

387
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,720
as if it's a real art form deserving of thoughtful criticism,

388
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,440
and people who mistake that criticism for insult and overreact to it.

389
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,080
To certain folks, though, this polite conversation about Cuphead's art style

390
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,920
will always read as an outraged accusation of racism,

391
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,960
and this balanced discussion about difficulty levels

392
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,080
will be read as an outraged accusation of ableism.

393
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,720
And I'm not sure there's anything I could say here

394
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,280
to get them to take a more nuanced look, really.

395
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,640
It's in their financial interest to imagine outrage

396
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,880
in order to be outraged about it.

397
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,240
And to loop back around to our pal AlphaOmegaSin for a second,

398
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,200
a little sketch he performs in his video illustrates the hypocrisy of this pretty nicely.

399
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,680
I would love to see these motherfuckers somehow sit at a table with people

400
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,120
that are actually dying of illness,

401
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,720
and try to explain to them,

402
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,520
oh, man, well, I see that you've only got mere weeks to live because, well,

403
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,600
what you're currently dealing with is incurable,

404
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,080
but I was playing Cuphead.

405
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,000
You know, I'm really sorry that your family's off in a separate room

406
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,880
and they're crying their eyes out and they don't know what to do

407
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,280
because you were actually the breadwinner of the family,

408
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,080
and unfortunately, they aren't going to be able to make ends meet

409
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,200
and they're going to have somebody that is kind of the glue of the family

410
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,120
is going to end up having to leave them, but Cuphead's really difficult.

411
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,440
So he imagines one of these people going up to someone with a terminal

412
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,440
and complaining about Cuphead's difficulty to, I suppose,

413
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,880
illustrate the relative triviality of that complaint.

414
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,560
What he doesn't somehow see is how easily he and his complaints

415
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,120
can be inserted into that same sketch.

416
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,080
Imagine going up to someone with a terminal illness and saying,

417
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,120
sorry, I know you're about to die and your family's sad

418
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,200
because you're the breadwinner and everything,

419
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,800
but some people called a video game ableist.

420
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,120
That's what I'm choosing to spend my time being outraged about.

421
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,200
And before wrapping up here, I'd like to highlight this tweet from Cheeky Scrump,

422
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,400
the author of the earlier article shared by Ian Miles-Chong.

423
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,080
And I quote,

424
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,160
The rich kid who used to laugh at you for wearing a Mario t-shirt in high school

425
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,600
now rents a two million dollar apartment in San Francisco

426
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,120
where they pretend to be poor

427
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,080
and write about how they're a real fan of video games,

428
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,080
not these toxic gamers.

429
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,160
Now, this is obviously a very silly point,

430
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,760
but it does expose the thinking behind a part of the gamer side

431
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,720
of the gamer-games journalist divide.

432
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,080
I've spoken previously about how self-identified gamers

433
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,360
have attempted to adopt the language of oppressed groups.

434
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,440
Well, what this is right here is an example

435
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,120
of gamers clumsily having a go at class concepts.

436
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,320
And it reminds me of that amazing Gamergate era image

437
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,320
showing the impoverished gamers holding up the rich games journalists

438
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,360
and critical theorist social justice warriors,

439
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,480
which is just wonderful.

440
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,720
Gamers who see games journalists as out-of-touch millionaires

441
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,920
ruining games while sipping champagne in their mansions

442
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,200
are arguably, in microcosm anyway,

443
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,520
carrying out a criticism of capitalism,

444
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,440
albeit a deeply flawed one.

445
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,320
They're acting as the oppressed workers

446
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,080
and have incorrectly positioned journalists, for some reason,

447
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,680
as the rich taskmasters.

448
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,520
So when Dean Takahashi is shown to be bad at a video game,

449
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,440
it's thus a deeply upsetting breach of the natural order.

450
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,400
You know, the capital-G gamers react to that much like

451
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,120
we would all react to finding out a billionaire banker

452
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,360
wasn't paying any taxes or something.

453
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,400
How outrageous.

454
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,880
You know, that's not how things are supposed to work.

455
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,240
And their explanation is the standard liberal failing

456
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,160
when criticizing capitalism.

457
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,400
You know, the wrong people are at the top.

458
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,640
Fire Dean Takahashi.

459
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,240
Get rid of him.

460
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,960
And fire any other journalists who supported him.

461
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,840
You know, there's no such thing as a systemic problem.

462
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,160
It's just that the wrong people are in charge.

463
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,920
How did they get the idea that games journalists

464
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,000
are in charge of anything?

465
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
No offense to games journalists here.

466
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,200
And how many layers of this metaphor are we on now?

467
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,920
I've lost track.

468
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,360
Let's try and extract ourselves from it, I think.

469
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,920
So what's my overall point here?

470
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,320
I don't know anymore, to be honest.

471
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,880
Maybe it's gamers should learn a bit more

472
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,720
about the world outside gaming.

473
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,880
Probably.

474
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,440
I feel like a lot of capital-G gamers

475
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,280
are so threatened by journalism

476
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,480
that simply asks questions or sparks debate

477
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,960
because they'd rather be totally passive

478
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,800
and uncritical consumers

479
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,600
of a predictable and unchanging product.

480
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,760
And any hint of outside influence

481
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,360
possibly interfering with the imagined purity of that product

482
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,360
and its creation process is taken as an outraged attack.

483
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,080
Or maybe it's simply being reminded of the fact

484
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,720
that games even have a creation process at all

485
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,640
that's so infuriating for them.

486
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,720
You know, games aren't created in a process by artists.

487
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,680
They just happen.

488
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,120
And we, as gamers, buy them.

489
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,360
And games journalists only exist

490
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,040
to give every game a high score

491
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,760
and provide us with a sense of shared experience

492
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,720
and reassurance in our enjoyment of the medium.

493
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,800
We don't just want to have fun.

494
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,840
We need to be told we're having fun.

495
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,840
And anyone theorizing about things

496
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,680
possibly being done differently

497
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,240
is just ruining the fantasy, really.

498
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,080
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

499
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,000
Now, any sharp-eyed fans out there

500
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,480
will have noticed that in my last video that went out,

501
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,000
I said in my next video,

502
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,040
I was going to be talking about anti-feminist YouTube.

503
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,840
And then this video was about Cuphead instead.

504
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,120
So what happened there?

505
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,120
Well, this video was originally a segment from that video

506
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,120
which is about the practice of making up

507
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,840
an imaginary enemy to be outraged about.

508
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,280
And as such, you'll have noticed

509
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,640
quite a lot of that in this video.

510
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,240
You know, gamers making up things

511
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,080
about games journalists and all that.

512
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,480
But as you can tell from the length,

513
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,800
this Cuphead section was getting a bit unwieldy,

514
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,200
so I decided to make it its own thing.

515
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,800
That video is still in the works.

516
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,280
It's probably not going to be my next release,

517
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,320
but maybe next month or early in January.

518
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,080
January?

519
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,800
Wow.

520
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,040
This year has really flown by, hasn't it?

521
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,960
Time flies when everyone is miserable

522
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,840
and only terrible things happen, apparently.

523
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,800
Thanks as always to my patrons

524
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,480
who should be scrolling by right now,

525
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,800
possibly for the last time.

526
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,800
There's getting a few too many of them

527
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,120
to scroll by in a reasonable time lately,

528
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,120
so I think I'm going to have to switch it up.

529
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,320
I might do a series of static text boxes.

530
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,560
That's something I might try out.

531
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,960
Or maybe I'll set appearing in the credits

532
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,120
as a tier reward or something, I don't know.

533
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,840
Having too many patrons to manage

534
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,200
is one of those good problems to have, though, I guess.

535
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,080
So thank you all again, sincerely,

536
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,440
and I'll see you next time.
