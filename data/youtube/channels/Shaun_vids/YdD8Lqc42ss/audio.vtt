WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.240
You can also go for the treasure chest and stuff.

00:05.240 --> 00:08.760
Treasure chest is worth more than the bag, which is worth more than the single.

00:08.760 --> 00:11.440
Nope, nope, nope, nope.

00:11.440 --> 00:12.440
Back off!

00:12.440 --> 00:14.440
What the fuck is that?

00:14.440 --> 00:16.880
Why would it do that?

00:16.880 --> 00:18.920
What, did it only get one go?

00:18.920 --> 00:21.020
I think I was wiggling pretty good.

00:21.020 --> 00:24.840
But it doesn't, it didn't say anything about me only getting to go once.

00:24.840 --> 00:25.840
Are those results?

00:25.840 --> 00:28.140
This is bullshit.

00:28.140 --> 00:29.140
Fuck this game.

00:29.280 --> 00:32.280
You only have 48 turns to go.

00:32.280 --> 00:33.280
Oh god.

00:33.280 --> 00:34.280
Okay.

00:34.280 --> 00:38.980
Oh, so Mario, wait, oh so now you might, oh but you don't have enough coins, and he lands

00:38.980 --> 00:39.980
on Bowser?

00:39.980 --> 00:40.980
Yeah!

00:40.980 --> 00:43.860
Wait, I'm going to turn you into a fan of this game.

00:43.860 --> 00:44.860
I thought that was the last space.

00:44.860 --> 00:48.660
No, you've got to go past it, so you're going to get screwed and then you might have to,

00:48.660 --> 00:51.660
either way it's bad after that because you don't have enough coins.

00:51.660 --> 00:54.700
No, I want to get there without enough coins.

00:54.700 --> 00:55.700
Because fuck that.

00:55.700 --> 00:57.380
Oh, you're just going to watch the world burn.

00:57.620 --> 01:00.860
I mean, if I can't get it, that's what I want to have happen, because that'll rotate it

01:00.860 --> 01:01.860
to Bowser, right?

01:01.860 --> 01:02.860
You have literally nothing.

01:02.860 --> 01:04.860
Good, I don't fucking need it, man.

01:04.860 --> 01:05.860
Rock bottom.

01:05.860 --> 01:08.860
Okay, I'm using pretty good at this, let me see.

01:08.860 --> 01:09.860
Who do I want to steal from?

01:09.860 --> 01:11.860
Um, are you in second, Drew?

01:11.860 --> 01:12.860
I think so.

01:12.860 --> 01:13.860
Okay.

01:13.860 --> 01:18.860
I want to be here, so I'm at your Yoshi.

01:18.860 --> 01:19.860
Okay.

01:19.860 --> 01:24.860
And I want to receive money, oh this is tough, okay.

01:24.860 --> 01:25.860
What?

01:25.860 --> 01:26.860
What?

01:27.340 --> 01:28.340
Okay, star.

01:28.340 --> 01:29.340
Okay.

01:29.340 --> 01:30.340
Okay.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.340
I'll take it from whoever.

01:31.340 --> 01:32.340
Not Mario.

01:32.340 --> 01:37.340
Damn it, he has no money, yeah!

01:37.340 --> 01:40.340
Oh, my coins go to you, here have my 20 coins.

01:40.340 --> 01:41.340
You broke son of a bitch.

01:41.340 --> 01:43.340
Here comes Mario, totally fucking destitute.

01:43.340 --> 01:49.340
He woke him up from a park bench, stole the newspaper he was using to sleep, and then

01:49.340 --> 01:51.340
said this is worth 20 coins.

01:51.340 --> 01:52.340
Damn it.

01:52.340 --> 01:53.340
My own fucking brother.

01:53.340 --> 01:56.340
Trying to rob my homeless brother.

01:56.820 --> 01:59.820
Queen game, all right.

01:59.820 --> 02:03.820
All right, here we go.

02:03.820 --> 02:06.820
Oh, now you're only two coins short.

02:06.820 --> 02:09.820
So you just got a bunch of money just to lose it immediately?

02:09.820 --> 02:10.820
Probably.

02:10.820 --> 02:14.820
Oh, you're going to get a star anyway, Jeff, look.

02:14.820 --> 02:16.820
He's going to give me one, he's nice.

02:16.820 --> 02:19.820
Oh wait, you don't have enough.

02:19.820 --> 02:23.820
All right, see ya.

02:24.300 --> 02:27.300
That rotates back to Toad, who has nothing to say.

02:27.300 --> 02:29.300
He just dropped you off a cloud.

02:29.300 --> 02:30.300
Sorry, dude.

02:30.300 --> 02:32.300
Yeah, you should have thought about this shit a little more, I guess, I don't know.

02:32.300 --> 02:33.300
Hey, Jeff, get back to the start.

02:33.300 --> 02:36.300
You could have like not even shown up and then like walked in right now.

02:36.300 --> 02:37.300
That's true.

02:37.300 --> 02:38.300
Yeah.

02:38.300 --> 02:39.300
That's true.

02:39.300 --> 02:40.300
And your hand would feel better.

02:40.300 --> 02:43.300
Yeah, that would be it.

02:43.300 --> 02:44.300
Oh, cool.

02:44.300 --> 02:45.300
Great.

02:45.300 --> 02:46.300
I'm having a great time.

02:46.300 --> 02:49.300
This is a real fun part of you guys.

02:49.780 --> 02:50.780
Star!

02:50.780 --> 02:51.780
Mario.

02:51.780 --> 02:55.780
Oh, I thought it was auto-run.

02:55.780 --> 02:59.780
No, I'm still in it.

02:59.780 --> 03:02.780
God damn it.

03:02.780 --> 03:03.780
Fuck.

03:03.780 --> 03:07.780
Damn it, Mario.

03:07.780 --> 03:14.780
What the fuck happened?

03:14.780 --> 03:18.780
I pushed A, it didn't jump.

03:19.260 --> 03:23.260
You got a coin.

03:23.260 --> 03:26.260
Motherfucker.

03:26.260 --> 03:34.260
I guess I need to roll big and get up there right now.

03:34.260 --> 03:35.260
Yeah.

03:35.260 --> 03:36.260
Wait.

03:36.260 --> 03:37.260
Whoa.

03:37.260 --> 03:38.260
Where did that come from?

03:38.260 --> 03:45.260
I think you got a random warp block, which is probably going to turn into spaces.

03:45.260 --> 03:48.260
Hey, Mario Party, am I right?

03:48.740 --> 03:53.740
I forgot in this one that just happens randomly.

03:53.740 --> 03:55.740
Fuck all video games forever.

03:55.740 --> 03:57.740
And it just picked me randomly to swap with?

03:57.740 --> 03:58.740
Yeah.

03:58.740 --> 04:02.740
So, jump across the top, remember where you land, the tower's tilted in a different direction,

04:02.740 --> 04:05.740
move the jump, once the tower teeters over, jump with all you got, then you make it to

04:05.740 --> 04:07.740
the next tower, and to what end?

04:07.740 --> 04:10.740
Just get to the end and get a bunch of coins on the way.

04:10.740 --> 04:12.740
The instructions could say there's an end.

04:12.740 --> 04:14.740
Look at this artsy shit.

04:14.740 --> 04:16.740
Look at that Donkey Kong Country stuff.

04:16.740 --> 04:17.740
Basically like Limbo.

04:18.740 --> 04:19.740
Oh.

04:23.740 --> 04:24.740
Wow.

04:33.740 --> 04:34.740
See, it starts you out.

04:34.740 --> 04:38.740
See, the first one before he jumps out there, I was holding up the whole time, which made

04:38.740 --> 04:41.740
me think that you couldn't run off the edge because it was holding me up.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.740
Like, I appreciate that.

04:43.740 --> 04:46.740
It's just unfortunate that it had to be in this context.

04:46.740 --> 04:48.740
How the fuck do you grab the eyeballs?

04:48.740 --> 04:49.740
You don't.

04:49.740 --> 04:50.740
Oh, you're right.

04:50.740 --> 04:51.740
The cheeks will do it.

04:51.740 --> 04:54.740
Mine has always looked exactly like the fucking picture, and I get like a 72.

04:57.740 --> 04:59.740
Fuck you, you motherfucker!

04:59.740 --> 05:00.740
That's right.

05:00.740 --> 05:01.740
Who are you?

05:01.740 --> 05:02.740
99.

05:02.740 --> 05:03.740
My goodness.

05:03.740 --> 05:06.740
I'm a regular face-stretching artiste over here.

05:09.740 --> 05:10.740
You're doing alright, Mario.

05:10.740 --> 05:11.740
You gotta start.

05:11.740 --> 05:12.740
You gotta start, Mario.

05:12.740 --> 05:13.740
It's okay.

05:13.740 --> 05:14.740
It's not okay.

05:15.740 --> 05:16.740
It would have been kind of funny.

05:18.740 --> 05:20.740
I feel pretty good about what I got going on here.

05:20.740 --> 05:21.740
Oh, I fucked up.

05:26.740 --> 05:27.740
Which one were you?

05:27.740 --> 05:28.740
Fuck this!

05:30.740 --> 05:32.740
Mario, you just lost 30 coins.

05:32.740 --> 05:35.740
Like sunlight hitting a lily.

05:35.740 --> 05:36.740
I just want to know.

05:37.740 --> 05:38.740
That's what you want.

05:39.740 --> 05:40.740
Oh!

05:41.740 --> 05:42.740
Hey!

05:42.740 --> 05:43.740
What do you know?

05:44.740 --> 05:45.740
Oh!

05:48.740 --> 05:50.740
Even when things go my way, they don't go my way.

05:50.740 --> 05:51.740
Wait.

05:51.740 --> 05:52.740
Oh!

05:52.740 --> 05:53.740
I just got that.

05:53.740 --> 05:54.740
Oh, no.

05:55.740 --> 05:56.740
Welcome to my world.

06:00.740 --> 06:01.740
Fuck all coins.

06:01.740 --> 06:02.740
Who needs them?

06:05.740 --> 06:08.740
Hey, if it's who needs them, don't do anything.

06:08.740 --> 06:09.740
That's a good point.

06:09.740 --> 06:10.740
Yeah, I just won't do anything.

06:10.740 --> 06:11.740
Yeah, huh.

06:11.740 --> 06:12.740
Talk the talk.

06:12.740 --> 06:13.740
Yeah.

06:13.740 --> 06:16.740
No, I'm getting these so I can lose them again later.

06:16.740 --> 06:17.740
Okay.

06:17.740 --> 06:18.740
Money.

06:18.740 --> 06:19.740
Fuck.

06:19.740 --> 06:20.740
God damn it.

06:20.740 --> 06:21.740
Shit.

06:21.740 --> 06:22.740
Fuck.

06:22.740 --> 06:23.740
Fuck.

06:23.740 --> 06:24.740
Who's up there?

06:24.740 --> 06:25.740
Fuck.

06:25.740 --> 06:26.740
Is that?

06:26.740 --> 06:27.740
Fuck.

06:27.740 --> 06:28.740
Oh.

06:28.740 --> 06:29.740
That's why you were saying fuck a lot.

06:37.740 --> 06:39.740
Can you burn me a CD?

06:39.740 --> 06:41.740
I threw them at the party.

06:44.740 --> 06:46.740
I'm gonna entertain myself somehow.

06:48.740 --> 06:49.740
I had 38 points.

06:49.740 --> 06:52.740
We had like video game play or something.

06:52.740 --> 06:54.740
I had 38 coins.

06:54.740 --> 06:56.740
I've got zero stars.

06:56.740 --> 06:59.740
I mean, they just didn't maintain security on achievements.

06:59.740 --> 07:02.740
It was too easy to hack them so they could never do anything good with them.

07:02.740 --> 07:03.740
Yeah.

07:03.740 --> 07:04.740
Mine's the best.

07:04.740 --> 07:05.740
Mine's the best.

07:05.740 --> 07:06.740
Mine's the best.

07:06.740 --> 07:07.740
Are you looking at mine?

07:07.740 --> 07:08.740
Mine's the best.

07:08.740 --> 07:09.740
Yeah.

07:09.740 --> 07:10.740
Fuck you.

07:10.740 --> 07:11.740
Mine was seven better than yours.

07:11.740 --> 07:12.740
Why?

07:12.740 --> 07:13.740
How was that?

07:13.740 --> 07:14.740
Did you see it?

07:14.740 --> 07:15.740
Hey, you know what?

07:15.740 --> 07:16.740
We all won though so there.

07:16.740 --> 07:17.740
Wait, who got the highest score?

07:17.740 --> 07:18.740
Me.

07:18.740 --> 07:20.740
But we're all having a good time.

07:20.740 --> 07:21.740
Oh yeah.

07:21.740 --> 07:22.740
No.

07:22.740 --> 07:24.740
It's the most fun I've had in ages.

07:24.740 --> 07:26.740
We all profited.

07:26.740 --> 07:28.740
So none of us profited then.

07:28.740 --> 07:30.740
Here's ten coins to everyone.

07:30.740 --> 07:33.740
You could win them in the next thing.

07:33.740 --> 07:35.740
Very true.

07:38.740 --> 07:39.740
It's me.

07:39.740 --> 07:40.740
It's me.

07:40.740 --> 08:06.740
I'm pretty sure it's me.

08:07.740 --> 08:10.740
Yeah, now that the star has been collected, what will happen on this board?

08:10.740 --> 08:22.740
Oh, it's stupid.

08:22.740 --> 08:26.740
Stop moving.

08:26.740 --> 08:27.740
Is that not it?

08:27.740 --> 08:28.740
Is that it?

08:28.740 --> 08:29.740
That's it, isn't it?

08:29.740 --> 08:30.740
What?

08:30.740 --> 08:31.740
God damn it.

08:31.740 --> 08:32.740
Oh, I was looking at yours and then.

08:32.740 --> 08:33.740
Oh, Yoshi.

08:33.740 --> 08:34.740
Damn it.

08:34.740 --> 08:35.740
Well, you have one that's wrong.

08:35.740 --> 08:37.740
No, no, you do it twice.

08:37.740 --> 08:39.740
If it's like, there's three.

08:39.740 --> 08:41.740
No, I was building the picture.

08:41.740 --> 08:43.740
I think that may have been a colorblind map.

08:43.740 --> 08:44.740
Oh, really?

08:44.740 --> 08:47.740
Yeah, maybe like one of the corner pieces that didn't have any characters on it.

08:47.740 --> 08:50.740
Yeah, your top right one was blue.

08:50.740 --> 08:51.740
Oh, okay.

08:51.740 --> 08:52.740
Huh.

08:52.740 --> 08:53.740
That's really interesting.

08:53.740 --> 08:54.740
Fuck this game.

08:54.740 --> 08:55.740
It's racist.

08:55.740 --> 08:57.740
It might have a colorblind mode.

08:57.740 --> 08:58.740
Fucking kidding me.

08:58.740 --> 08:59.740
How do you climb?

08:59.740 --> 09:00.740
Hey, tap A.

09:00.740 --> 09:01.740
Okay.

09:02.740 --> 09:04.740
Boy, they don't give you any quarter.

09:04.740 --> 09:07.740
No, that's how Drew died immediately last time.

09:07.740 --> 09:08.740
Oh.

09:08.740 --> 09:09.740
Oh, shit.

09:09.740 --> 09:10.740
No.

09:10.740 --> 09:12.740
Fuck this game.

09:19.740 --> 09:21.740
I got it.

09:21.740 --> 09:23.740
Don't tell me I got robbed there.

09:23.740 --> 09:24.740
Yeah.

09:24.740 --> 09:25.740
Wait, what?

09:25.740 --> 09:26.740
What do I have wrong?

09:26.740 --> 09:27.740
Which one did I?

09:27.740 --> 09:28.740
Top right again.

09:28.740 --> 09:29.740
Top right, really?

09:29.740 --> 09:30.740
Yeah, that's right.

09:30.740 --> 09:31.740
Top right, really?

09:31.740 --> 09:32.740
Yeah, it's red.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.740
It had a little hooky corner on it that looked...

09:34.740 --> 09:35.740
Yeah, the color.

09:35.740 --> 09:36.740
Man.

09:36.740 --> 09:37.740
Man, that's crazy.

09:39.740 --> 09:41.740
I want an instant replay of that because I thought I hit it.

09:41.740 --> 09:46.740
I think that this game needs the ability to turn off certain minigames and I'm offended?

09:47.740 --> 09:49.740
This is pretty cool.

09:49.740 --> 09:50.740
Well, good.

09:52.740 --> 09:54.740
You have three more coins than me.

09:54.740 --> 09:56.740
Yeah, that makes me feel better.

09:56.740 --> 09:57.740
That's a good point.

09:57.740 --> 09:58.740
Oh, wait.

09:58.740 --> 09:59.740
I'll get another shot at it.

09:59.740 --> 10:00.740
It'll be fine.

10:00.740 --> 10:01.740
It'll be fine.

10:03.740 --> 10:04.740
We'll roll this again.

10:04.740 --> 10:05.740
I have more time to get the coins.

10:05.740 --> 10:06.740
You can get more coins?

10:06.740 --> 10:07.740
That was a good thing.

10:07.740 --> 10:08.740
That was a blessing.

10:08.740 --> 10:09.740
Yeah, that's what we call it.

10:09.740 --> 10:10.740
A blessing.

10:10.740 --> 10:11.740
For everything in Mario Karting.

10:11.740 --> 10:13.740
Blessings or blessings in disguise.

10:13.740 --> 10:15.740
I'm getting stuffed now.

10:17.740 --> 10:20.740
Oh, and then a blooper comes and takes you off the stage.

10:21.740 --> 10:22.740
Mario win this.

10:22.740 --> 10:24.740
Don't let Mario get more.

10:25.740 --> 10:26.740
Is that a draw?

10:29.740 --> 10:30.740
No.

10:36.740 --> 10:38.740
Hey, Dan, you care to make a friendly wager?

10:38.740 --> 10:39.740
What's that, Brad?

10:39.740 --> 10:40.740
I don't know.

10:40.740 --> 10:44.740
I'm just gauging your interest before I lay any terms down.

10:44.740 --> 10:49.740
On the outcome, the winner of this?

10:49.740 --> 10:50.740
Sure.

10:50.740 --> 10:52.740
Is the wager...

10:52.740 --> 10:54.740
What turn number is this?

10:54.740 --> 10:55.740
Let's see.

10:55.740 --> 10:56.740
16.

10:56.740 --> 10:57.740
God!

11:00.740 --> 11:01.740
Here we go.

11:01.740 --> 11:02.740
Yoshi, take it.

11:02.740 --> 11:04.740
Yeah, he got in the way.

11:04.740 --> 11:06.740
Yeah, blocking him.

11:17.740 --> 11:18.740
I think we won.

11:19.740 --> 11:20.740
I think we won.

11:32.740 --> 11:33.740
Don't you worry.

11:33.740 --> 11:36.740
I think there's too much overlap between Birdo and Yoshi.

11:36.740 --> 11:37.740
Not a whole lot.

11:37.740 --> 11:40.740
Birdo is cool and Yoshi sucks.

11:41.740 --> 11:45.740
Birdo is a dinosaur that looks kind of like Yoshi, right?

11:45.740 --> 11:46.740
I mean...

11:46.740 --> 11:47.740
The mouth thing is totally different.

11:47.740 --> 11:48.740
Look at the mouth and nose.

11:48.740 --> 11:49.740
They're clearly different.

11:49.740 --> 11:50.740
I guess that's true.

11:54.740 --> 11:56.740
I think all Yoshi's are females.

11:56.740 --> 11:57.740
It's only eggs.

11:57.740 --> 11:59.740
I thought it was the other.

11:59.740 --> 12:01.740
Well, so does Birdo.

12:01.740 --> 12:02.740
I don't know.

12:02.740 --> 12:07.740
Birdo is in the ladies bathroom in the new Mario Golf Toadstool Tour.

12:07.740 --> 12:09.740
Or the Game Boy one.

12:09.740 --> 12:11.740
Is that cannon?

12:11.740 --> 12:12.740
Yeah, I think so.

12:17.740 --> 12:18.740
We're all doing real good, guys.

12:20.740 --> 12:21.740
Oh, come on.

12:21.740 --> 12:22.740
I pressed the button.

12:22.740 --> 12:23.740
Nothing happened.

12:23.740 --> 12:25.740
That's what happened.

12:27.740 --> 12:28.740
Oh, boy.

12:28.740 --> 12:29.740
Oh, my God!

12:31.740 --> 12:32.740
This is getting rough.

12:32.740 --> 12:33.740
Oh, my God.

12:33.740 --> 12:34.740
I need this to end quick.

12:38.740 --> 12:40.740
This is just 50 jumps.

12:40.740 --> 12:42.740
Oh, my God.

12:42.740 --> 12:43.740
How are we doing this?

12:43.740 --> 12:44.740
But...

12:44.740 --> 12:45.740
Oh!

12:45.740 --> 12:47.740
This really needs to end.

12:50.740 --> 12:51.740
But...

12:51.740 --> 12:52.740
Okay.

12:57.740 --> 12:59.740
This is unprecedented.

13:01.740 --> 13:02.740
I hit it!

13:02.740 --> 13:03.740
I hit it!

13:11.740 --> 13:12.740
Nothing!

13:12.740 --> 13:14.740
You hit nothing!

13:15.740 --> 13:16.740
Oh, man.

13:17.740 --> 13:19.740
Wow, this leaderboard is flip-flopped.

13:21.740 --> 13:25.740
Anything can happen in this piece of garbage masquerading as a video game.

13:30.740 --> 13:31.740
Too true.

13:35.740 --> 13:36.740
Don't fucking be a star.

13:38.740 --> 13:39.740
Oh, my God!

13:40.740 --> 13:41.740
Oh, my God!

13:43.740 --> 13:44.740
See?

13:44.740 --> 13:45.740
Yes.

13:45.740 --> 13:46.740
Do you see?

13:46.740 --> 13:47.740
Oh, my God.

13:49.740 --> 13:51.740
Do you see what I've been saying this whole time?

13:52.740 --> 13:53.740
This game sucks.

13:56.740 --> 13:57.740
No. What? No. What?

13:57.740 --> 13:59.740
Did he just unrest the dead?

14:02.740 --> 14:04.740
Get the fuck away from my coins.

14:04.740 --> 14:05.740
These are my coins.

14:05.740 --> 14:06.740
This is all I have.

14:07.740 --> 14:08.740
He didn't star.

14:08.740 --> 14:09.740
We shouldn't be grave robbing.

14:09.740 --> 14:10.740
21 coins.

14:11.740 --> 14:12.740
Throw it opposite a grave robbing.

14:12.740 --> 14:13.740
Total BS.

14:13.740 --> 14:14.740
Came out of the grave and robbed you.

14:15.740 --> 14:16.740
That's hot crap.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.740
Still not exactly clear what this does, but whatever.

14:35.740 --> 14:38.740
Game & Watch is worse than 64.

14:43.740 --> 14:44.740
Wait, what?

14:44.740 --> 14:46.740
You're moving the fucking star.

14:46.740 --> 14:47.740
I thought that was the one that...

14:47.740 --> 14:49.740
It was right when Jeff was almost...

14:49.740 --> 14:51.740
Wait, I thought you went the other way around the star.

14:51.740 --> 14:53.740
He was working his way back.

14:53.740 --> 14:54.740
Fuck.

14:54.740 --> 14:55.740
Jesus Christ.

14:55.740 --> 14:57.740
He was really good at basketball, it turns out.

15:00.740 --> 15:01.740
Come on!

15:02.740 --> 15:03.740
Let me just...

15:03.740 --> 15:04.740
Don't...

15:14.740 --> 15:15.740
Yes!

15:19.740 --> 15:20.740
Press the button.

15:20.740 --> 15:21.740
Advance the game.

15:26.740 --> 15:28.740
This game's fucking great.

15:33.740 --> 15:34.740
Oh, another game here.

15:35.740 --> 15:37.740
Oh, no, it's the honesty thing.

15:47.740 --> 15:50.740
I didn't want the other two, so it doesn't matter.

15:50.740 --> 15:51.740
That's harsh.

15:51.740 --> 15:52.740
What a dick.

15:52.740 --> 15:53.740
That's pretty good.

15:53.740 --> 15:54.740
Watoed?

15:56.740 --> 15:58.740
Toad doesn't give a shit about honesty.

15:59.740 --> 16:00.740
Integrity.

16:00.740 --> 16:01.740
Seems to be the case.

16:01.740 --> 16:02.740
Toad's a fucking snake.

16:03.740 --> 16:04.740
No.

16:21.740 --> 16:23.740
Aw, so close.

16:28.740 --> 16:31.740
Oh, and then you gotta play a game by yourself.

16:33.740 --> 16:34.740
Oh.

16:39.740 --> 16:42.740
Coins sucked out of you by the bank.

16:42.740 --> 16:43.740
Who knows?

16:45.740 --> 16:46.740
Jeff, this is it.

16:46.740 --> 16:47.740
Why?

16:47.740 --> 16:48.740
Who cares?

16:50.740 --> 16:52.740
I get a big enough roll and I use my...

16:52.740 --> 16:53.740
Use the item.

16:53.740 --> 16:54.740
20.

16:54.740 --> 16:55.740
What is your item?

16:55.740 --> 16:56.740
Roll 20.

16:56.740 --> 16:58.740
You can use your mushroom.

16:59.740 --> 17:01.740
In fact, you definitely should.

17:02.740 --> 17:03.740
Make use of that.

17:04.740 --> 17:06.740
The new key's got to hang out with you for a while.

17:11.740 --> 17:14.740
Oh, but I got 10 coins out of it, so that's cool.

17:14.740 --> 17:15.740
Oh.

17:30.740 --> 17:31.740
What's happening?

17:34.740 --> 17:35.740
He's got a little wahoo.

17:35.740 --> 17:36.740
He's like, finally.

17:37.740 --> 17:39.740
Satan has come to take me away.

17:41.740 --> 17:43.740
What kind of dash LEDs can you do today?

17:43.740 --> 17:44.740
I'm a genius.

17:44.740 --> 17:45.740
I'll just rub.

17:45.740 --> 17:46.740
That is genius.

17:46.740 --> 17:47.740
Man, who?

17:47.740 --> 17:51.740
I never thought of just a straight jack move.

17:51.740 --> 17:54.740
No, because we have forward controls too, so we probably both have two wars.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.740
We probably just need to cooperate to steer.

17:57.740 --> 17:59.740
You do A, I'll do B.

17:59.740 --> 18:01.740
We'll figure it out as we go.

18:01.740 --> 18:03.740
So A and B at the same time just go forward.

18:03.740 --> 18:05.740
It's fucking silo-y.

18:07.740 --> 18:08.740
Who's on, Jeff?

18:08.740 --> 18:09.740
I am, but I'm hitting A and B.

18:09.740 --> 18:10.740
We're on the right.

18:10.740 --> 18:11.740
And nothing's happening?

18:11.740 --> 18:12.740
And nothing's happening.

18:13.740 --> 18:14.740
B has to go left.

18:14.740 --> 18:15.740
B has to go right.

18:15.740 --> 18:16.740
So yeah, let's do both.

18:16.740 --> 18:17.740
Nothing's happening.

18:17.740 --> 18:18.740
Well, we're fucked.

18:18.740 --> 18:19.740
Nothing's happening.

18:19.740 --> 18:20.740
A and B at the same time.

18:20.740 --> 18:21.740
No, nothing's happening.

18:21.740 --> 18:22.740
I can't do anything.

18:22.740 --> 18:23.740
These buttons are not working.

18:23.740 --> 18:24.740
Man, what a great game.

18:24.740 --> 18:25.740
Can someone unplug my controller?

18:25.740 --> 18:26.740
You gotta kick that.

18:26.740 --> 18:27.740
Uh-oh.

18:27.740 --> 18:28.740
Gotta explain it.

18:28.740 --> 18:30.740
Game of skill.

18:31.740 --> 18:33.740
Fucking game of cheating, more like.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.740
Uh, I don't wanna spoil it.

18:43.740 --> 18:45.740
Is that where you wanted to go?

18:45.740 --> 18:47.740
Oh, did someone already get that other star?

18:47.740 --> 18:48.740
Oh, you're right.

18:48.740 --> 18:49.740
I wanted.

18:49.740 --> 18:50.740
Yeah, well.

18:51.740 --> 18:52.740
Well, whatever.

18:54.740 --> 18:55.740
There was nothing I could do.

18:55.740 --> 18:57.740
I rolled the dice and then I went there.

18:58.740 --> 18:59.740
Oh, god damn it.

18:59.740 --> 19:00.740
I had no choice in the matter.

19:00.740 --> 19:01.740
Making a fatal mistake.

19:01.740 --> 19:04.740
There was no skill that could be used to.

19:04.740 --> 19:05.740
Oh, okay.

19:05.740 --> 19:06.740
Fucking.

19:12.740 --> 19:13.740
Fuck.

19:17.740 --> 19:18.740
Fuck.

19:19.740 --> 19:20.740
You alright?

19:23.740 --> 19:24.740
I thought that was a pretty good roll.

19:24.740 --> 19:26.740
I was a little confused there.

19:30.740 --> 19:32.740
This infinite death trap.

19:37.740 --> 19:38.740
You're rubbing.

19:43.740 --> 19:44.740
I'm up there again.

19:45.740 --> 19:46.740
That's about right.

19:46.740 --> 20:11.740
If you're just joining us, this is Mario Party 4 for the Nintendo GameCube.

20:11.740 --> 20:16.740
Oh, shit.

20:21.740 --> 20:22.740
Anybody.

20:25.740 --> 20:27.740
My fate in the hands of the universe.

20:37.740 --> 20:38.740
It's all fair.

20:38.740 --> 20:40.740
It's war with the battlefield.

20:42.740 --> 20:43.740
Still got some coins.

20:44.740 --> 20:45.740
Ooh.

20:45.740 --> 20:46.740
Again?

20:46.740 --> 20:47.740
Again?

20:47.740 --> 20:48.740
Oh, no.

20:49.740 --> 20:50.740
Oh, no.

20:50.740 --> 20:51.740
Holy shit.

20:51.740 --> 20:52.740
Is it gone?

20:53.740 --> 20:54.740
Holy shit.

20:57.740 --> 20:58.740
Dude.

21:01.740 --> 21:03.740
What triggers that?

21:03.740 --> 21:04.740
It's the question marks.

21:04.740 --> 21:05.740
Any of them?

21:05.740 --> 21:08.740
No, just the question mark green space.

21:08.740 --> 21:10.740
The one, so you landed on the spot right before the start?

21:10.740 --> 21:11.740
Yeah.

21:11.740 --> 21:12.740
Yeah.

21:12.740 --> 21:13.740
Uh-huh.

21:13.740 --> 21:14.740
Man, that's incredible.

21:14.740 --> 21:15.740
Fuck all video games forever.

21:15.740 --> 21:17.740
Fucking what a piece of shit.

21:17.740 --> 21:18.740
God.

21:18.740 --> 21:23.740
Build a time machine, go back in time, find the first pong machine, smash it with a fucking

21:23.740 --> 21:24.740
sledgehammer.

21:24.740 --> 21:27.740
I know it's a little late to start, but I feel like we should end all of these by destroying

21:27.740 --> 21:28.740
the game at the end.

21:28.740 --> 21:30.740
So nobody could ever be cursed with it again.

21:32.740 --> 21:35.740
Take up a spot in your fucking inventory.

21:35.740 --> 21:36.740
It's huge.

21:36.740 --> 21:37.740
It's a huge tent.

21:37.740 --> 21:38.740
Is this star still over here?

21:38.740 --> 21:39.740
I don't even remember.

21:39.740 --> 21:40.740
Yeah.

21:40.740 --> 21:41.740
Whoa.

21:41.740 --> 21:42.740
Okay.

21:42.740 --> 21:43.740
Oh, wait.

21:43.740 --> 21:44.740
My god, man.

21:44.740 --> 21:45.740
Well, fuck everything.

21:45.740 --> 21:46.740

Oh, no.

21:54.740 --> 21:55.740
Oh, no.

21:55.740 --> 21:56.740
Oh, no.

21:56.740 --> 21:57.740
Oh, no.

21:57.740 --> 21:58.740
Oh, no.

21:58.740 --> 21:59.740
Oh, no.

21:59.740 --> 22:00.740
Oh, no.

22:00.740 --> 22:01.740
Oh, no.

22:01.740 --> 22:02.740
Oh, no.

22:02.740 --> 22:03.740
Oh, no.

22:03.740 --> 22:04.740
Oh.

22:04.740 --> 22:05.740
Hey.

22:05.740 --> 22:06.740
Hey,linger anytime anything opens?

22:06.740 --> 22:07.740
Oh yeah.

22:07.740 --> 22:08.740
Come on.

22:08.740 --> 22:09.740
Come on guys.

22:09.740 --> 22:10.740
BOOM.

22:10.740 --> 22:11.740
Come on.

22:11.740 --> 22:12.740
Always the best house.

22:12.740 --> 22:13.740

22:13.740 --> 22:22.740
I'm looking forward to it.

22:22.740 --> 22:23.740
Okay.

22:23.740 --> 22:24.740
Uh.

22:24.740 --> 22:25.740
Adds one dice block.

22:25.740 --> 22:26.740
That might actually be.

22:26.740 --> 22:27.740
That'd be cool.

22:27.740 --> 22:28.740
Wait.

22:28.740 --> 22:29.740
Are you close to the thing?

22:29.740 --> 22:30.740
Save that.

22:30.740 --> 22:31.740
Yeah.

22:31.740 --> 22:32.740
You should save that.

22:32.740 --> 22:33.740
Oh wait.

22:33.740 --> 22:34.740
Yeah.

22:34.740 --> 22:35.740
Do it.

22:35.740 --> 22:36.740
Do it.

22:36.740 --> 22:37.740
Do it.

22:37.740 --> 22:38.740
You feeling lucky?

22:40.740 --> 22:41.740

22:41.740 --> 22:42.740
I'm gonna do that.

22:42.740 --> 22:43.740
Yes.

22:43.740 --> 22:44.740
Let's do that.

22:44.740 --> 22:45.740
Yes.

22:45.740 --> 22:46.740
Okay.

22:46.740 --> 22:47.740
Double ones.

22:47.740 --> 22:48.740
Here we go.

22:48.740 --> 22:49.740
Jeff.

22:49.740 --> 22:50.740
I'm rooting for you.

22:50.740 --> 22:51.740
I know.

22:51.740 --> 22:52.740
Yeah.

22:52.740 --> 22:53.740
I just want somebody to get it.

22:53.740 --> 22:54.740
Okay.

22:54.740 --> 22:55.740
Oh.

22:55.740 --> 22:56.740
You're gonna lose.

22:56.740 --> 22:57.740
No.

22:57.740 --> 22:58.740
No.

22:58.740 --> 22:59.740
He's not.

22:59.740 --> 23:00.740
Aw.

23:00.740 --> 23:01.740
Yeah.

23:01.740 --> 23:02.740
Best Mario boss.

23:02.740 --> 23:03.740
Yeah.

23:03.740 --> 23:04.740
Yeah.

23:04.740 --> 23:05.740
Yeah.

23:05.740 --> 23:06.740
Yeah.

23:06.740 --> 23:07.740
Yeah.

23:07.740 --> 23:08.740
Yeah.

23:08.740 --> 23:09.740
Yeah.

23:09.740 --> 23:10.740
Yeah.

23:11.740 --> 23:12.740
Best Mario party.

23:12.740 --> 23:13.740
Where?

23:13.740 --> 23:15.740
You just go here anyway.

23:15.740 --> 23:16.740
You end up here anyway.

23:16.740 --> 23:19.740
I go to the exact same fucking space.

23:19.740 --> 23:20.740
No matter what I fucking pick.

23:20.740 --> 23:21.740
If you go right.

23:21.740 --> 23:22.740
You don't have to see the animation.

23:22.740 --> 23:23.740
This will be faster.

23:23.740 --> 23:27.740
Cause we don't have to watch the dumb animation of this stupid fucking cannon.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.740
This piece of shit.

23:31.740 --> 23:32.740
Fuck everything.

23:32.740 --> 23:34.740
That seems way too powerful.

23:38.740 --> 23:39.740
This game of skill.

23:39.740 --> 23:40.740
Shit.

23:43.740 --> 23:44.740
So this is like chance time.

23:44.740 --> 23:45.740
Okay.

23:45.740 --> 23:46.740
Oh.

23:46.740 --> 23:47.740
Yeah.

23:47.740 --> 23:48.740
Totally chance time.

23:48.740 --> 23:49.740
Okay.

23:49.740 --> 23:50.740
Fuck.

23:50.740 --> 23:51.740
Oh my god.

23:51.740 --> 23:52.740
Fuck.

23:52.740 --> 23:53.740
Fuck.

23:53.740 --> 23:54.740
Wait.

23:54.740 --> 23:55.740
Is that even bad for you?

23:55.740 --> 23:56.740
Oh wait.

23:56.740 --> 23:57.740
Oh shit.

23:57.740 --> 23:58.740
This could be like ten fucking coins.

23:58.740 --> 23:59.740
Fuck.

23:59.740 --> 24:00.740
Fuck.

24:00.740 --> 24:01.740
Fuck.

24:01.740 --> 24:02.740
Fuck.

24:02.740 --> 24:03.740
Fuck.

24:03.740 --> 24:04.740
Fuck.

24:04.740 --> 24:05.740
Fuck.

24:05.740 --> 24:06.740
Fuck.

24:06.740 --> 24:07.740
Fuck.

24:07.740 --> 24:08.740
Fuck.

24:08.740 --> 24:09.740
Oh.

24:12.740 --> 24:14.780
I'm sorry Jeff.

24:16.780 --> 24:17.780
It's fine.

24:17.780 --> 24:18.780
It's fine.

24:18.780 --> 24:20.780
I didn't want it to be like this.

24:20.780 --> 24:22.780
No it's fine.

24:26.780 --> 24:27.780
No.

24:27.780 --> 24:29.740
I don't even have them at rolling.

24:31.780 --> 24:33.740
Where's the star?

24:36.780 --> 24:37.780
Good.

24:38.740 --> 24:39.740
Three coins.

24:39.740 --> 24:40.740
Enjoy.

24:40.740 --> 24:43.740
Enjoy those three fucking coins if you land on the back of the end.

24:43.740 --> 24:48.740
You could have had like a real nice lunch and then like come in an hour later and just

24:48.740 --> 24:51.740
like join our game and be right in the same spot.

25:01.740 --> 25:02.740
Alright.

25:08.740 --> 25:10.740
What will happen?

25:17.740 --> 25:19.740
Who else it will happen to?

25:19.740 --> 25:20.740
It always calls you.

25:20.740 --> 25:21.740
Okay.

25:22.740 --> 25:23.740
Oh.

25:25.740 --> 25:26.740
Aw shit.

25:28.740 --> 25:29.740
Stars.

25:29.740 --> 25:30.740
Stars.

25:35.740 --> 25:36.740
Aw.

25:38.740 --> 25:39.740
Scale.

25:49.740 --> 25:50.740
Burn it all down.

25:52.740 --> 25:53.740
Man.

25:58.740 --> 25:59.740
Strong turn.

25:59.740 --> 26:00.740
Strong turn.

26:03.740 --> 26:05.740
I'm playing turn one over here.

26:08.740 --> 26:09.740
Let's go.

26:25.740 --> 26:26.740
Why?

26:28.740 --> 26:31.740
So there is a chance that you get all of my stars.

26:31.740 --> 26:32.740
Yeah.

26:32.740 --> 26:33.740
Okay.

26:33.740 --> 26:35.740
Just wanted to make sure that was on the line here.

26:36.740 --> 26:37.740
That's really bullshit.

26:38.740 --> 26:39.740
Yeah.

26:39.740 --> 26:40.740
That's bullshit.

26:42.740 --> 26:43.740
It's the game man.

26:52.740 --> 26:53.740
Aw.

26:55.740 --> 26:56.740
The rich get riches.

26:57.740 --> 26:58.740
Oooh.

27:09.740 --> 27:10.740
Just rotate the lever.

27:10.740 --> 27:11.740
Just rotate the lever.

27:11.740 --> 27:13.740
Just fucking do a thing.

27:23.740 --> 27:24.740
That was hard.

27:27.740 --> 27:28.740
That was hard.

27:40.740 --> 27:42.740
I swear this fucking game.

27:44.740 --> 27:45.740
Wait.

27:45.740 --> 27:46.740
What do we do?

27:46.740 --> 27:47.740
Did I say pull a rope?

27:47.740 --> 27:48.740
I didn't complete random.

27:48.740 --> 27:49.740
What do we do?

27:49.740 --> 27:51.740
Pull a random rope and something fucking dumb happens.

27:51.740 --> 27:52.740
Okay.

27:56.740 --> 27:57.740
What?

27:57.740 --> 27:58.740
What?

27:58.740 --> 27:59.740
Just pick a rope.

27:59.740 --> 28:00.740
You got to pull a rope Brad.

28:00.740 --> 28:01.740
You have to pull a rope.

28:01.740 --> 28:02.740
You have to pull a rope.

28:02.740 --> 28:03.740
How do I pull a rope?

28:03.740 --> 28:04.740
Let's go up and hit A.

28:04.740 --> 28:05.740
I'm hitting A.

28:05.740 --> 28:06.740
You got a rope.

28:06.740 --> 28:07.740
You picked one.

28:07.740 --> 28:08.740
You hit A already.

28:08.740 --> 28:09.740
Oh okay.

28:09.740 --> 28:10.740
You hit that rope.

28:10.740 --> 28:11.740
Ha ha ha ha.

28:11.740 --> 28:12.740

Cool.

28:35.740 --> 28:36.740
Cool.

28:36.740 --> 28:37.740
How many more Mario parties are there?

28:37.740 --> 28:37.740
