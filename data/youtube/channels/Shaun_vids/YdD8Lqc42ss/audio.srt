1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
You can also go for the treasure chest and stuff.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,760
Treasure chest is worth more than the bag, which is worth more than the single.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,440
Nope, nope, nope, nope.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,440
Back off!

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,440
What the fuck is that?

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,880
Why would it do that?

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,920
What, did it only get one go?

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,020
I think I was wiggling pretty good.

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,840
But it doesn't, it didn't say anything about me only getting to go once.

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,840
Are those results?

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,140
This is bullshit.

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,140
Fuck this game.

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,280
You only have 48 turns to go.

14
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,280
Oh god.

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,280
Okay.

16
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,980
Oh, so Mario, wait, oh so now you might, oh but you don't have enough coins, and he lands

17
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:39,980
on Bowser?

18
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:40,980
Yeah!

19
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,860
Wait, I'm going to turn you into a fan of this game.

20
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,860
I thought that was the last space.

21
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,660
No, you've got to go past it, so you're going to get screwed and then you might have to,

22
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,660
either way it's bad after that because you don't have enough coins.

23
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,700
No, I want to get there without enough coins.

24
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,700
Because fuck that.

25
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,380
Oh, you're just going to watch the world burn.

26
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,860
I mean, if I can't get it, that's what I want to have happen, because that'll rotate it

27
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,860
to Bowser, right?

28
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,860
You have literally nothing.

29
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,860
Good, I don't fucking need it, man.

30
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,860
Rock bottom.

31
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,860
Okay, I'm using pretty good at this, let me see.

32
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,860
Who do I want to steal from?

33
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,860
Um, are you in second, Drew?

34
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,860
I think so.

35
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,860
Okay.

36
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,860
I want to be here, so I'm at your Yoshi.

37
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,860
Okay.

38
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,860
And I want to receive money, oh this is tough, okay.

39
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,860
What?

40
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,860
What?

41
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,340
Okay, star.

42
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,340
Okay.

43
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,340
Okay.

44
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,340
I'll take it from whoever.

45
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,340
Not Mario.

46
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,340
Damn it, he has no money, yeah!

47
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,340
Oh, my coins go to you, here have my 20 coins.

48
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,340
You broke son of a bitch.

49
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,340
Here comes Mario, totally fucking destitute.

50
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:49,340
He woke him up from a park bench, stole the newspaper he was using to sleep, and then

51
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,340
said this is worth 20 coins.

52
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,340
Damn it.

53
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,340
My own fucking brother.

54
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,340
Trying to rob my homeless brother.

55
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,820
Queen game, all right.

56
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,820
All right, here we go.

57
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,820
Oh, now you're only two coins short.

58
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,820
So you just got a bunch of money just to lose it immediately?

59
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,820
Probably.

60
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,820
Oh, you're going to get a star anyway, Jeff, look.

61
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,820
He's going to give me one, he's nice.

62
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,820
Oh wait, you don't have enough.

63
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,820
All right, see ya.

64
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,300
That rotates back to Toad, who has nothing to say.

65
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,300
He just dropped you off a cloud.

66
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,300
Sorry, dude.

67
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,300
Yeah, you should have thought about this shit a little more, I guess, I don't know.

68
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,300
Hey, Jeff, get back to the start.

69
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,300
You could have like not even shown up and then like walked in right now.

70
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,300
That's true.

71
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,300
Yeah.

72
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,300
That's true.

73
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,300
And your hand would feel better.

74
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,300
Yeah, that would be it.

75
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,300
Oh, cool.

76
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,300
Great.

77
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,300
I'm having a great time.

78
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,300
This is a real fun part of you guys.

79
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,780
Star!

80
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,780
Mario.

81
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,780
Oh, I thought it was auto-run.

82
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,780
No, I'm still in it.

83
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,780
God damn it.

84
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,780
Fuck.

85
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,780
Damn it, Mario.

86
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:14,780
What the fuck happened?

87
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,780
I pushed A, it didn't jump.

88
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,260
You got a coin.

89
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,260
Motherfucker.

90
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:34,260
I guess I need to roll big and get up there right now.

91
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,260
Yeah.

92
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,260
Wait.

93
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,260
Whoa.

94
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,260
Where did that come from?

95
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:45,260
I think you got a random warp block, which is probably going to turn into spaces.

96
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,260
Hey, Mario Party, am I right?

97
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:53,740
I forgot in this one that just happens randomly.

98
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,740
Fuck all video games forever.

99
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,740
And it just picked me randomly to swap with?

100
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,740
Yeah.

101
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,740
So, jump across the top, remember where you land, the tower's tilted in a different direction,

102
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,740
move the jump, once the tower teeters over, jump with all you got, then you make it to

103
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,740
the next tower, and to what end?

104
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,740
Just get to the end and get a bunch of coins on the way.

105
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,740
The instructions could say there's an end.

106
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,740
Look at this artsy shit.

107
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,740
Look at that Donkey Kong Country stuff.

108
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,740
Basically like Limbo.

109
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,740
Oh.

110
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,740
Wow.

111
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,740
See, it starts you out.

112
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,740
See, the first one before he jumps out there, I was holding up the whole time, which made

113
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,740
me think that you couldn't run off the edge because it was holding me up.

114
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,740
Like, I appreciate that.

115
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,740
It's just unfortunate that it had to be in this context.

116
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,740
How the fuck do you grab the eyeballs?

117
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,740
You don't.

118
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,740
Oh, you're right.

119
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,740
The cheeks will do it.

120
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,740
Mine has always looked exactly like the fucking picture, and I get like a 72.

121
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,740
Fuck you, you motherfucker!

122
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,740
That's right.

123
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,740
Who are you?

124
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,740
99.

125
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,740
My goodness.

126
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,740
I'm a regular face-stretching artiste over here.

127
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,740
You're doing alright, Mario.

128
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,740
You gotta start.

129
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,740
You gotta start, Mario.

130
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,740
It's okay.

131
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,740
It's not okay.

132
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,740
It would have been kind of funny.

133
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,740
I feel pretty good about what I got going on here.

134
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,740
Oh, I fucked up.

135
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,740
Which one were you?

136
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,740
Fuck this!

137
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,740
Mario, you just lost 30 coins.

138
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,740
Like sunlight hitting a lily.

139
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,740
I just want to know.

140
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,740
That's what you want.

141
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,740
Oh!

142
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,740
Hey!

143
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,740
What do you know?

144
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,740
Oh!

145
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,740
Even when things go my way, they don't go my way.

146
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,740
Wait.

147
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,740
Oh!

148
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,740
I just got that.

149
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,740
Oh, no.

150
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,740
Welcome to my world.

151
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,740
Fuck all coins.

152
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,740
Who needs them?

153
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,740
Hey, if it's who needs them, don't do anything.

154
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,740
That's a good point.

155
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,740
Yeah, I just won't do anything.

156
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,740
Yeah, huh.

157
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,740
Talk the talk.

158
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,740
Yeah.

159
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,740
No, I'm getting these so I can lose them again later.

160
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,740
Okay.

161
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,740
Money.

162
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,740
Fuck.

163
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,740
God damn it.

164
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,740
Shit.

165
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,740
Fuck.

166
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,740
Fuck.

167
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,740
Who's up there?

168
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,740
Fuck.

169
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,740
Is that?

170
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,740
Fuck.

171
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,740
Oh.

172
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,740
That's why you were saying fuck a lot.

173
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,740
Can you burn me a CD?

174
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,740
I threw them at the party.

175
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,740
I'm gonna entertain myself somehow.

176
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,740
I had 38 points.

177
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,740
We had like video game play or something.

178
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,740
I had 38 coins.

179
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,740
I've got zero stars.

180
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,740
I mean, they just didn't maintain security on achievements.

181
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,740
It was too easy to hack them so they could never do anything good with them.

182
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,740
Yeah.

183
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,740
Mine's the best.

184
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,740
Mine's the best.

185
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,740
Mine's the best.

186
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,740
Are you looking at mine?

187
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,740
Mine's the best.

188
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,740
Yeah.

189
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,740
Fuck you.

190
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,740
Mine was seven better than yours.

191
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,740
Why?

192
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,740
How was that?

193
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,740
Did you see it?

194
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,740
Hey, you know what?

195
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,740
We all won though so there.

196
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,740
Wait, who got the highest score?

197
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,740
Me.

198
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,740
But we're all having a good time.

199
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,740
Oh yeah.

200
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,740
No.

201
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,740
It's the most fun I've had in ages.

202
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,740
We all profited.

203
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,740
So none of us profited then.

204
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,740
Here's ten coins to everyone.

205
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,740
You could win them in the next thing.

206
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,740
Very true.

207
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,740
It's me.

208
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,740
It's me.

209
00:07:40,740 --> 00:08:06,740
I'm pretty sure it's me.

210
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,740
Yeah, now that the star has been collected, what will happen on this board?

211
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:22,740
Oh, it's stupid.

212
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,740
Stop moving.

213
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,740
Is that not it?

214
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,740
Is that it?

215
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,740
That's it, isn't it?

216
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,740
What?

217
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,740
God damn it.

218
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,740
Oh, I was looking at yours and then.

219
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,740
Oh, Yoshi.

220
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,740
Damn it.

221
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,740
Well, you have one that's wrong.

222
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,740
No, no, you do it twice.

223
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,740
If it's like, there's three.

224
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,740
No, I was building the picture.

225
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,740
I think that may have been a colorblind map.

226
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,740
Oh, really?

227
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,740
Yeah, maybe like one of the corner pieces that didn't have any characters on it.

228
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,740
Yeah, your top right one was blue.

229
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,740
Oh, okay.

230
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,740
Huh.

231
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,740
That's really interesting.

232
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,740
Fuck this game.

233
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,740
It's racist.

234
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,740
It might have a colorblind mode.

235
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,740
Fucking kidding me.

236
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,740
How do you climb?

237
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,740
Hey, tap A.

238
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,740
Okay.

239
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,740
Boy, they don't give you any quarter.

240
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,740
No, that's how Drew died immediately last time.

241
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,740
Oh.

242
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,740
Oh, shit.

243
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,740
No.

244
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,740
Fuck this game.

245
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,740
I got it.

246
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,740
Don't tell me I got robbed there.

247
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,740
Yeah.

248
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,740
Wait, what?

249
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,740
What do I have wrong?

250
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,740
Which one did I?

251
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,740
Top right again.

252
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,740
Top right, really?

253
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,740
Yeah, that's right.

254
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,740
Top right, really?

255
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,740
Yeah, it's red.

256
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,740
It had a little hooky corner on it that looked...

257
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,740
Yeah, the color.

258
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,740
Man.

259
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,740
Man, that's crazy.

260
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,740
I want an instant replay of that because I thought I hit it.

261
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,740
I think that this game needs the ability to turn off certain minigames and I'm offended?

262
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,740
This is pretty cool.

263
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,740
Well, good.

264
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,740
You have three more coins than me.

265
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,740
Yeah, that makes me feel better.

266
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,740
That's a good point.

267
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,740
Oh, wait.

268
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,740
I'll get another shot at it.

269
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,740
It'll be fine.

270
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,740
It'll be fine.

271
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,740
We'll roll this again.

272
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,740
I have more time to get the coins.

273
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,740
You can get more coins?

274
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,740
That was a good thing.

275
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,740
That was a blessing.

276
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,740
Yeah, that's what we call it.

277
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,740
A blessing.

278
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,740
For everything in Mario Karting.

279
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,740
Blessings or blessings in disguise.

280
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,740
I'm getting stuffed now.

281
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,740
Oh, and then a blooper comes and takes you off the stage.

282
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,740
Mario win this.

283
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,740
Don't let Mario get more.

284
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,740
Is that a draw?

285
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,740
No.

286
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,740
Hey, Dan, you care to make a friendly wager?

287
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,740
What's that, Brad?

288
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,740
I don't know.

289
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,740
I'm just gauging your interest before I lay any terms down.

290
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:49,740
On the outcome, the winner of this?

291
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,740
Sure.

292
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,740
Is the wager...

293
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,740
What turn number is this?

294
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,740
Let's see.

295
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,740
16.

296
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,740
God!

297
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,740
Here we go.

298
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,740
Yoshi, take it.

299
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,740
Yeah, he got in the way.

300
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,740
Yeah, blocking him.

301
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,740
I think we won.

302
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,740
I think we won.

303
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,740
Don't you worry.

304
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,740
I think there's too much overlap between Birdo and Yoshi.

305
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,740
Not a whole lot.

306
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,740
Birdo is cool and Yoshi sucks.

307
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,740
Birdo is a dinosaur that looks kind of like Yoshi, right?

308
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,740
I mean...

309
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,740
The mouth thing is totally different.

310
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,740
Look at the mouth and nose.

311
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,740
They're clearly different.

312
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,740
I guess that's true.

313
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,740
I think all Yoshi's are females.

314
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,740
It's only eggs.

315
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,740
I thought it was the other.

316
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,740
Well, so does Birdo.

317
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,740
I don't know.

318
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,740
Birdo is in the ladies bathroom in the new Mario Golf Toadstool Tour.

319
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,740
Or the Game Boy one.

320
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,740
Is that cannon?

321
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,740
Yeah, I think so.

322
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,740
We're all doing real good, guys.

323
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,740
Oh, come on.

324
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,740
I pressed the button.

325
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,740
Nothing happened.

326
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,740
That's what happened.

327
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,740
Oh, boy.

328
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,740
Oh, my God!

329
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,740
This is getting rough.

330
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,740
Oh, my God.

331
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,740
I need this to end quick.

332
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,740
This is just 50 jumps.

333
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,740
Oh, my God.

334
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,740
How are we doing this?

335
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,740
But...

336
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,740
Oh!

337
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,740
This really needs to end.

338
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,740
But...

339
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,740
Okay.

340
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,740
This is unprecedented.

341
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,740
I hit it!

342
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,740
I hit it!

343
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,740
Nothing!

344
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,740
You hit nothing!

345
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,740
Oh, man.

346
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,740
Wow, this leaderboard is flip-flopped.

347
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,740
Anything can happen in this piece of garbage masquerading as a video game.

348
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,740
Too true.

349
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,740
Don't fucking be a star.

350
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,740
Oh, my God!

351
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,740
Oh, my God!

352
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,740
See?

353
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,740
Yes.

354
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,740
Do you see?

355
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,740
Oh, my God.

356
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,740
Do you see what I've been saying this whole time?

357
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,740
This game sucks.

358
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,740
No. What? No. What?

359
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,740
Did he just unrest the dead?

360
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,740
Get the fuck away from my coins.

361
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,740
These are my coins.

362
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,740
This is all I have.

363
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,740
He didn't star.

364
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,740
We shouldn't be grave robbing.

365
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,740
21 coins.

366
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,740
Throw it opposite a grave robbing.

367
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,740
Total BS.

368
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,740
Came out of the grave and robbed you.

369
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,740
That's hot crap.

370
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,740
Still not exactly clear what this does, but whatever.

371
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,740
Game & Watch is worse than 64.

372
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,740
Wait, what?

373
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,740
You're moving the fucking star.

374
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,740
I thought that was the one that...

375
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,740
It was right when Jeff was almost...

376
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,740
Wait, I thought you went the other way around the star.

377
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,740
He was working his way back.

378
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,740
Fuck.

379
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,740
Jesus Christ.

380
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,740
He was really good at basketball, it turns out.

381
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,740
Come on!

382
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,740
Let me just...

383
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,740
Don't...

384
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,740
Yes!

385
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,740
Press the button.

386
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,740
Advance the game.

387
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,740
This game's fucking great.

388
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,740
Oh, another game here.

389
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,740
Oh, no, it's the honesty thing.

390
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,740
I didn't want the other two, so it doesn't matter.

391
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,740
That's harsh.

392
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,740
What a dick.

393
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,740
That's pretty good.

394
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,740
Watoed?

395
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,740
Toad doesn't give a shit about honesty.

396
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,740
Integrity.

397
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,740
Seems to be the case.

398
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,740
Toad's a fucking snake.

399
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,740
No.

400
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,740
Aw, so close.

401
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,740
Oh, and then you gotta play a game by yourself.

402
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,740
Oh.

403
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,740
Coins sucked out of you by the bank.

404
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,740
Who knows?

405
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,740
Jeff, this is it.

406
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,740
Why?

407
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,740
Who cares?

408
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,740
I get a big enough roll and I use my...

409
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,740
Use the item.

410
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,740
20.

411
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,740
What is your item?

412
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,740
Roll 20.

413
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,740
You can use your mushroom.

414
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,740
In fact, you definitely should.

415
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,740
Make use of that.

416
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,740
The new key's got to hang out with you for a while.

417
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,740
Oh, but I got 10 coins out of it, so that's cool.

418
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,740
Oh.

419
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,740
What's happening?

420
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,740
He's got a little wahoo.

421
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,740
He's like, finally.

422
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,740
Satan has come to take me away.

423
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,740
What kind of dash LEDs can you do today?

424
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,740
I'm a genius.

425
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,740
I'll just rub.

426
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,740
That is genius.

427
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,740
Man, who?

428
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,740
I never thought of just a straight jack move.

429
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,740
No, because we have forward controls too, so we probably both have two wars.

430
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,740
We probably just need to cooperate to steer.

431
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,740
You do A, I'll do B.

432
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,740
We'll figure it out as we go.

433
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,740
So A and B at the same time just go forward.

434
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,740
It's fucking silo-y.

435
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,740
Who's on, Jeff?

436
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,740
I am, but I'm hitting A and B.

437
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,740
We're on the right.

438
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,740
And nothing's happening?

439
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,740
And nothing's happening.

440
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,740
B has to go left.

441
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,740
B has to go right.

442
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,740
So yeah, let's do both.

443
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,740
Nothing's happening.

444
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,740
Well, we're fucked.

445
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,740
Nothing's happening.

446
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,740
A and B at the same time.

447
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,740
No, nothing's happening.

448
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,740
I can't do anything.

449
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,740
These buttons are not working.

450
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,740
Man, what a great game.

451
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,740
Can someone unplug my controller?

452
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,740
You gotta kick that.

453
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,740
Uh-oh.

454
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,740
Gotta explain it.

455
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,740
Game of skill.

456
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,740
Fucking game of cheating, more like.

457
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,740
Uh, I don't wanna spoil it.

458
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,740
Is that where you wanted to go?

459
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,740
Oh, did someone already get that other star?

460
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,740
Oh, you're right.

461
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,740
I wanted.

462
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,740
Yeah, well.

463
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,740
Well, whatever.

464
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,740
There was nothing I could do.

465
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,740
I rolled the dice and then I went there.

466
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,740
Oh, god damn it.

467
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,740
I had no choice in the matter.

468
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,740
Making a fatal mistake.

469
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,740
There was no skill that could be used to.

470
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,740
Oh, okay.

471
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,740
Fucking.

472
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,740
Fuck.

473
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,740
Fuck.

474
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,740
You alright?

475
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,740
I thought that was a pretty good roll.

476
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,740
I was a little confused there.

477
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,740
This infinite death trap.

478
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,740
You're rubbing.

479
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,740
I'm up there again.

480
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,740
That's about right.

481
00:19:46,740 --> 00:20:11,740
If you're just joining us, this is Mario Party 4 for the Nintendo GameCube.

482
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:16,740
Oh, shit.

483
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,740
Anybody.

484
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,740
My fate in the hands of the universe.

485
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,740
It's all fair.

486
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,740
It's war with the battlefield.

487
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,740
Still got some coins.

488
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,740
Ooh.

489
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,740
Again?

490
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,740
Again?

491
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,740
Oh, no.

492
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,740
Oh, no.

493
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,740
Holy shit.

494
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,740
Is it gone?

495
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,740
Holy shit.

496
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,740
Dude.

497
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,740
What triggers that?

498
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,740
It's the question marks.

499
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,740
Any of them?

500
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,740
No, just the question mark green space.

501
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,740
The one, so you landed on the spot right before the start?

502
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,740
Yeah.

503
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,740
Yeah.

504
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,740
Uh-huh.

505
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,740
Man, that's incredible.

506
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,740
Fuck all video games forever.

507
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,740
Fucking what a piece of shit.

508
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,740
God.

509
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:23,740
Build a time machine, go back in time, find the first pong machine, smash it with a fucking

510
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,740
sledgehammer.

511
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,740
I know it's a little late to start, but I feel like we should end all of these by destroying

512
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,740
the game at the end.

513
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,740
So nobody could ever be cursed with it again.

514
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,740
Take up a spot in your fucking inventory.

515
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,740
It's huge.

516
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,740
It's a huge tent.

517
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,740
Is this star still over here?

518
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,740
I don't even remember.

519
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,740
Yeah.

520
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,740
Whoa.

521
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,740
Okay.

522
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,740
Oh, wait.

523
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,740
My god, man.

524
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,740
Well, fuck everything.

525
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,740
Oh, no.

526
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,740
Oh, no.

527
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,740
Oh, no.

528
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,740
Oh, no.

529
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,740
Oh, no.

530
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,740
Oh, no.

531
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,740
Oh, no.

532
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,740
Oh, no.

533
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,740
Oh, no.

534
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,740
Oh, no.

535
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,740
Oh, no.

536
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,740
Oh, no.

537
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,740
Oh, no.

538
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,740
Oh, no.

539
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,740
Oh, no.

540
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,740
Oh, no.

541
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,740
Oh, no.

542
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,740
Oh, no.

543
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,740
Oh.

544
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,740
Hey.

545
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,740
Hey,linger anytime anything opens?

546
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,740
Oh yeah.

547
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,740
Come on.

548
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,740
Come on guys.

549
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,740
BOOM.

550
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,740
Come on.

551
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,740
Always the best house.

552
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,740
Yeah.

553
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:22,740
I'm looking forward to it.

554
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,740
Okay.

555
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,740
Uh.

556
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,740
Adds one dice block.

557
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,740
That might actually be.

558
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,740
That'd be cool.

559
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,740
Wait.

560
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,740
Are you close to the thing?

561
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,740
Save that.

562
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,740
Yeah.

563
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,740
You should save that.

564
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,740
Oh wait.

565
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,740
Yeah.

566
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,740
Do it.

567
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,740
Do it.

568
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,740
Do it.

569
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,740
You feeling lucky?

570
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,740
I'm gonna use.

571
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,740
I'm gonna.

572
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,740
I'm gonna do that.

573
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,740
I'm gonna do that.

574
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,740
Yes.

575
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,740
Let's do that.

576
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,740
Yes.

577
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,740
Okay.

578
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,740
Double ones.

579
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,740
Here we go.

580
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,740
Jeff.

581
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,740
I'm rooting for you.

582
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,740
I know.

583
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,740
Yeah.

584
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,740
I just want somebody to get it.

585
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,740
Okay.

586
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,740
Oh.

587
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,740
You're gonna lose.

588
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,740
No.

589
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,740
No.

590
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,740
He's not.

591
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,740
Aw.

592
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,740
Yeah.

593
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,740
Best Mario boss.

594
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,740
Yeah.

595
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,740
Yeah.

596
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,740
Yeah.

597
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,740
Yeah.

598
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,740
Yeah.

599
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,740
Yeah.

600
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,740
Yeah.

601
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,740
Yeah.

602
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,740
Best Mario party.

603
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,740
Where?

604
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,740
You just go here anyway.

605
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,740
You end up here anyway.

606
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,740
I go to the exact same fucking space.

607
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,740
No matter what I fucking pick.

608
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,740
If you go right.

609
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,740
You don't have to see the animation.

610
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,740
This will be faster.

611
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,740
Cause we don't have to watch the dumb animation of this stupid fucking cannon.

612
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,740
This piece of shit.

613
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,740
Fuck everything.

614
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,740
That seems way too powerful.

615
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,740
This game of skill.

616
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,740
Shit.

617
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,740
So this is like chance time.

618
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,740
Okay.

619
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,740
Oh.

620
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,740
Yeah.

621
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,740
Totally chance time.

622
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,740
Okay.

623
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,740
Fuck.

624
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,740
Oh my god.

625
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,740
Fuck.

626
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,740
Fuck.

627
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,740
Wait.

628
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,740
Is that even bad for you?

629
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,740
Oh wait.

630
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,740
Oh shit.

631
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,740
This could be like ten fucking coins.

632
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,740
Fuck.

633
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,740
Fuck.

634
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,740
Fuck.

635
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,740
Fuck.

636
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,740
Fuck.

637
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,740
Fuck.

638
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,740
Fuck.

639
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,740
Fuck.

640
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,740
Fuck.

641
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,740
Fuck.

642
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,740
Oh.

643
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,780
I'm sorry Jeff.

644
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,780
It's fine.

645
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,780
It's fine.

646
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,780
I didn't want it to be like this.

647
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,780
No it's fine.

648
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,780
No.

649
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,740
I don't even have them at rolling.

650
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,740
Where's the star?

651
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,780
Good.

652
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,740
Three coins.

653
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,740
Enjoy.

654
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,740
Enjoy those three fucking coins if you land on the back of the end.

655
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:48,740
You could have had like a real nice lunch and then like come in an hour later and just

656
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,740
like join our game and be right in the same spot.

657
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,740
Alright.

658
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,740
What will happen?

659
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,740
Who else it will happen to?

660
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,740
It always calls you.

661
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,740
Okay.

662
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,740
Oh.

663
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,740
Aw shit.

664
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,740
Stars.

665
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,740
Stars.

666
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,740
Aw.

667
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,740
Scale.

668
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,740
Burn it all down.

669
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,740
Man.

670
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,740
Strong turn.

671
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,740
Strong turn.

672
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,740
I'm playing turn one over here.

673
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,740
Let's go.

674
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,740
Why?

675
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,740
So there is a chance that you get all of my stars.

676
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,740
Yeah.

677
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,740
Okay.

678
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,740
Just wanted to make sure that was on the line here.

679
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,740
That's really bullshit.

680
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,740
Yeah.

681
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,740
That's bullshit.

682
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,740
It's the game man.

683
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,740
Aw.

684
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,740
The rich get riches.

685
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,740
Oooh.

686
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,740
Just rotate the lever.

687
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,740
Just rotate the lever.

688
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,740
Just fucking do a thing.

689
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,740
That was hard.

690
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,740
That was hard.

691
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,740
I swear this fucking game.

692
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,740
Wait.

693
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,740
What do we do?

694
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,740
Did I say pull a rope?

695
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,740
I didn't complete random.

696
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,740
What do we do?

697
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,740
Pull a random rope and something fucking dumb happens.

698
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,740
Okay.

699
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,740
What?

700
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,740
What?

701
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,740
Just pick a rope.

702
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,740
You got to pull a rope Brad.

703
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,740
You have to pull a rope.

704
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,740
You have to pull a rope.

705
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,740
How do I pull a rope?

706
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,740
Let's go up and hit A.

707
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,740
I'm hitting A.

708
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,740
You got a rope.

709
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,740
You picked one.

710
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,740
You hit A already.

711
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,740
Oh okay.

712
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,740
You hit that rope.

713
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,740
Ha ha ha ha.

714
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,740
Woo.

715
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,740
Yeah.

716
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,740
Yeah.

717
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,740
Okay.

718
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,740
Okay.

719
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,740
Okay.

720
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,740
Cool.

721
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,740
Cool.

722
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,740
Cool.

723
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,740
Cool.

724
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,740
Cool.

725
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,740
Cool.

726
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,740
Cool.

727
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,740
Cool.

728
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,740
Cool.

729
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,740
Cool.

730
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,740
Cool.

731
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,740
Cool.

732
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,740
Cool.

733
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,740
Cool.

734
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,740
Cool.

735
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,740
Cool.

736
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,740
Cool.

737
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,740
Cool.

738
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,740
Cool.

739
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,740
How many more Mario parties are there?

740
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:37,740
