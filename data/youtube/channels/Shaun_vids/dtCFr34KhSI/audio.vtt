00:00.000 --> 00:05.720
Hello, everyone. Today we're going to be asking a question, a question that you may have seen elsewhere online.

00:05.720 --> 00:09.800
Why don't moderate Muslims condemn terror attacks?

00:09.800 --> 00:15.400
And we're going to be talking about that question in relation to free terror attacks that have taken place in the UK this year.

00:15.400 --> 00:21.280
The Westminster attack on the 22nd of March, the Manchester Arena bombing on the 22nd of May,

00:21.280 --> 00:24.000
and the London Bridge attack on the 3rd of June.

00:24.080 --> 00:30.080
Three terrible and cowardly attacks that are carried out by five extremist Islamic terrorists.

00:30.080 --> 00:33.120
Attacks which it should be easy for anyone to condemn.

00:33.120 --> 00:40.480
This violence has no place in our society, and anyone who is a part of our society should accept and recognize that, obviously.

00:40.480 --> 00:45.520
So, why don't we see so-called moderate Muslims condemning these attacks?

00:45.520 --> 00:48.880
Could it be that they're all secret terrorist sympathizers?

00:49.280 --> 00:51.760
Well, let's rewind a sec.

00:51.760 --> 00:55.840
To answer this question, we first have to answer another question.

00:55.840 --> 00:59.040
Do moderate Muslims condemn terror attacks?

00:59.040 --> 01:03.200
You see, if we say, why don't moderate Muslims condemn terror attacks?

01:03.200 --> 01:07.040
Well, that's a bit of a, have you stopped beating your wife, type thing.

01:07.040 --> 01:09.200
What we call a loaded question.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.920
It contains within it a presumption of guilt.

01:11.920 --> 01:18.880
So what we're going to do today is go and check and see whether or not moderate Muslims are actually condemning terror attacks.

01:18.960 --> 01:22.000
A brief note about the term moderate Muslim, though.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.080
I'm not too happy with it, personally.

01:24.080 --> 01:29.440
If, with regards to terror attacks, anyway, all you have are extremists and moderates,

01:29.440 --> 01:32.800
that's sort of an artificial cropping of possibilities there,

01:32.800 --> 01:37.280
as if the most that Muslims can be is moderately against terrorism.

01:37.280 --> 01:41.680
The full scale would have a counter to extremists on the other side of the moderates.

01:41.680 --> 01:46.880
Extremely nice Muslims, or something who are extremely against terrorism.

01:46.880 --> 01:52.240
And they're not being taken into consideration if we just talk about Muslims in terms of extremists and moderates.

01:52.240 --> 01:57.520
I'm gonna keep saying moderates in this video, if only because that's the language in the question I'm trying to answer,

01:57.520 --> 02:00.240
but just keep in mind that I'm not too pleased about it.

02:00.240 --> 02:02.880
And one more thing before we get into anything here.

02:02.880 --> 02:07.200
I am aware of the meme of the leftist, liberal, social justice type

02:07.200 --> 02:12.240
who leaps to the defense of Muslims in the aftermath of a terror attack, saying things like,

02:12.320 --> 02:13.840
Not all Muslims are bad.

02:13.840 --> 02:16.800
And making certain YouTubers' brains explode, you know.

02:16.800 --> 02:17.760
How could it be?

02:17.760 --> 02:22.720
They say that you would defend Islam after Muslims did such a terrible thing.

02:22.720 --> 02:30.000
You know, these people are deeply religious, conservative, misogynist, anti-democratic, homophobic, you know.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.200
All the things that you leftists say that you're against,

02:33.200 --> 02:36.720
so why don't you apply those same criticisms to Islam?

02:36.720 --> 02:38.880
And I have an answer for you there, don't worry,

02:38.880 --> 02:42.640
but you're gonna have to stick around to the end of the video to hear it, I'm afraid.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.880
So, that's something to look forward to, anyway.

02:45.520 --> 02:46.880
So, let's get going.

02:46.880 --> 02:53.120
On the 22nd of March 2017, 52-year-old Khalid Masood drove a car onto a pavement

02:53.120 --> 02:57.760
and ran over pedestrians on Westminster Bridge in London, killing four people.

02:57.760 --> 03:03.040
He then exited the car and fatally stabbed the police officer before being shot dead himself.

03:03.040 --> 03:05.840
Masood stated in a text message sent before he died

03:05.840 --> 03:10.160
that his actions were revenge for Western military intervention in the Middle East.

03:10.160 --> 03:13.040
And it wasn't long before people online were wondering,

03:13.040 --> 03:15.680
where are the moderate Muslims condemning this attack?

03:16.240 --> 03:21.840
Twitter user Tony, with regards to the Islamic State praising the attack, asks,

03:21.840 --> 03:24.640
where are the moderate Muslims condemning?

03:24.640 --> 03:26.480
Ana Garz comments,

03:26.480 --> 03:30.960
anybody notice the hordes of moderate Muslims coming out against the Westminster attack?

03:31.600 --> 03:32.400
Me neither.

03:33.040 --> 03:35.840
And at M. Teko Manx asks,

03:35.840 --> 03:38.800
why all terrorists happen to be Muslim?

03:38.800 --> 03:43.120
I haven't seen a single march of moderate Muslims against these scoundrels.

03:43.840 --> 03:49.040
Well, M. Teko Manx, if you'd waited just a few days, that's exactly what you would have seen.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.480
From The Independent,

03:50.480 --> 03:55.360
Muslim women stand in solidarity with London terror attack victims on Westminster Bridge.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.680
Muslim women have gathered on Westminster Bridge

03:57.680 --> 04:00.960
in a show of solidarity with the victims of Wednesday's terror attack.

04:00.960 --> 04:04.560
The group of women spoke of the overwhelming emotion they felt standing on the bridge

04:04.560 --> 04:07.760
where dozens of people were mown down when terrorist Khalid Masood

04:07.760 --> 04:10.080
plowed his car into pedestrians.

04:10.080 --> 04:12.320
And the article quotes several people who were there.

04:12.880 --> 04:16.320
Sarah Waseem, 57, from Surrey, said,

04:16.320 --> 04:19.840
when an attack happens in London, it is an attack on me.

04:19.840 --> 04:21.440
It's an attack on all of us.

04:21.440 --> 04:24.400
Islam totally condemns violence of any sort.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.000
This is abhorrent to us.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.520
Being present for the demonstration shows people in the city are united

04:29.520 --> 04:32.560
in support of democracy, says Ayasha Malik.

04:32.560 --> 04:36.000
The 34-year-old mother of two, also from Surrey, said,

04:36.000 --> 04:41.600
as a visible Muslim, I think it was important to show solidarity with the principles we all hold dear.

04:41.600 --> 04:45.280
The principles of plurality, diversity, and so on.

04:45.280 --> 04:48.560
So that's some Muslims there condemning the terror attack,

04:48.560 --> 04:51.840
but that's just one bunch of people on a bridge, you might say.

04:51.840 --> 04:53.840
What were some other Muslims up to?

04:53.840 --> 04:55.360
Well, let's take a look.

04:55.920 --> 04:59.280
The Muslim Council of Britain put out the following press release.

04:59.280 --> 05:02.000
We are shocked and saddened by the incident at Westminster.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.600
We condemn this attack.

05:03.600 --> 05:06.400
And while it's still too early to speculate on the motives,

05:06.400 --> 05:09.360
our thoughts and prayers are for the victims and those affected.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.720
And they also released a video.

05:11.360 --> 05:17.360
The attack in Westminster on Wednesday was a cowardly, depraved act, and it was wrong.

05:18.800 --> 05:22.560
There is no justification whatsoever for this act of violence,

05:23.200 --> 05:25.200
and we condemn it unequivocally.

05:25.200 --> 05:29.120
So that's the attack condemned over at the Muslim Council of Britain.

05:29.120 --> 05:33.120
But individual mosques around the country were also getting in on the condemning.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.560
The East London Mosque, the oldest in the capital and the largest in the UK, said,

05:38.560 --> 05:41.280
We're saddened by the appalling attack in Westminster

05:41.280 --> 05:43.840
that resulted in tragic deaths and injuries.

05:43.840 --> 05:47.440
Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims and their loved ones.

05:47.440 --> 05:49.760
Such heinous acts of mindless violence

05:49.760 --> 05:53.120
must not be allowed to cause division and hatred among our communities.

05:53.680 --> 05:57.280
We must remain united and stand in solidarity with all.

05:57.360 --> 06:00.480
In Birmingham, 55,000 copies of a booklet,

06:00.480 --> 06:04.960
Terrorism is Not Islam, a 12-page guide produced by the city's central mosque

06:04.960 --> 06:06.560
to answer questions such as,

06:06.560 --> 06:08.720
are suicide attacks lawful in Islam,

06:08.720 --> 06:13.760
and does the foreign policy of the West or other grievances justify killing non-Muslims,

06:13.760 --> 06:18.880
were handed out at mosques, schools, and shops with the support of West Midlands Police.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.560
And I took a peek at that booklet,

06:20.560 --> 06:23.520
and it condemns violence and terrorism throughout,

06:23.520 --> 06:26.960
and at the end it lists all the mosques that supported and endorsed it,

06:26.960 --> 06:28.640
so good stuff there.

06:28.640 --> 06:31.520
They're clearly getting it done down in Birmingham.

06:31.520 --> 06:34.400
And here's another story from the Huffington Post.

06:34.400 --> 06:37.280
London terror attack fundraiser led by Muslims

06:37.280 --> 06:39.920
raises thousands to help victims' families.

06:39.920 --> 06:45.520
I decided to launch this campaign to raise money for victims of yesterday's terrible attack.

06:45.520 --> 06:50.960
I was unfortunately holed up in parliament for around four hours yesterday

06:50.960 --> 06:53.360
and witnessed a lot of terrible carnage.

06:53.360 --> 06:56.880
Saw a number of bodies on the streets, paramedics, police everywhere.

06:57.440 --> 07:00.560
It moved me quite a bit, and when I got home last night

07:00.560 --> 07:02.480
I realised that I'd gone through a terrible experience,

07:02.480 --> 07:04.960
but it must be a lot worse for the victims of the attack.

07:04.960 --> 07:08.880
And this is my city, these are my neighbours,

07:08.880 --> 07:11.040
and I felt that I had to do something,

07:11.040 --> 07:14.720
so I called up a bunch of my friends and we launched this campaign.

07:14.720 --> 07:16.800
We've raised over £5,000 already,

07:17.520 --> 07:20.560
and we'd love for everyone to help us to do something good

07:20.560 --> 07:26.080
and to ensure that at least something positive comes out for the victims of these families.

07:27.680 --> 07:31.120
And by the time the Muslims United for London project closed,

07:31.120 --> 07:35.200
they'd raised over £29,000 for the victims of the attack.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.400
So that's nice.

07:36.400 --> 07:40.800
So we've got Muslims condemning the attack, marching with the victims,

07:40.800 --> 07:42.800
raising thousands of pounds in support,

07:43.680 --> 07:46.640
and, well, I don't want to come to any premature conclusions here,

07:46.640 --> 07:49.040
maybe the Westminster attack was an anomaly,

07:49.040 --> 07:51.040
you know, maybe it's not always like this,

07:51.040 --> 07:53.280
so let's take a look at the other incidents.

07:53.920 --> 07:56.080
On the 22nd of May this year,

07:56.080 --> 08:02.000
a man called Salman Abadi detonated a nail bomb outside the Manchester Arena in Manchester,

08:02.000 --> 08:05.360
killing 23 people, including himself.

08:05.360 --> 08:08.080
So, did Muslims condemn this attack?

08:08.080 --> 08:11.840
Well, here's a vigil for the victims with a bunch of religious leaders,

08:11.840 --> 08:15.520
including Muslims, all holding hands and speaking out against the attack.

08:16.240 --> 08:19.680
Here's a bunch of Muslims doing a march to condemn the attack,

08:19.680 --> 08:23.200
and here's a donation campaign called Muslims for Manchester

08:23.200 --> 08:27.040
that raised over £27,000 for the victims of the attack.

08:27.040 --> 08:31.520
Pretty much exactly the same actions that were taken with the Westminster attack, to be honest.

08:31.520 --> 08:33.360
So that's two out of three.

08:33.920 --> 08:36.960
Let's take a look at the third one, the London Bridge attack.

08:36.960 --> 08:40.080
And I don't really want to belabor the point here, but here we go.

08:40.800 --> 08:44.880
100 Muslim leaders gather on London Bridge to condemn attacks.

08:44.880 --> 08:47.360
ISIS will lose. Love will win.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.800
Your views are not welcome in our mosques or in our communities.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.480
Muslims hand out thousands of roses in solidarity with terror victims.

08:56.480 --> 08:58.800
And there's an interesting one here.

08:58.800 --> 09:03.600
More than 130 British imams refused to bury London attackers.

09:03.600 --> 09:07.680
We will not perform the traditional Islamic funeral prayer for the perpetrators,

09:07.680 --> 09:10.720
and we also urge fellow imams and religious authorities

09:10.720 --> 09:13.440
to withdraw such a privilege, the Muslim leaders said.

09:14.240 --> 09:18.640
These vile murderers seek to divide our society and instill fear.

09:18.640 --> 09:20.320
We will ensure they fail.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.080
We implore everyone to unite.

09:22.080 --> 09:26.240
We are one community in the face of such dastardly cowardice.

09:26.240 --> 09:30.560
Unlike the terrorists, we must uphold love and compassion.

09:30.560 --> 09:34.880
Thousands of Muslims worldwide have likewise condemned terrorism in recent years,

09:34.880 --> 09:41.440
as noted in a 712-page Google document maintained by an American Muslim student.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.880
And I'll put a link to that Google document in the description

09:44.880 --> 09:50.560
if you want easy access to a seemingly never-ending list of Muslims condemning terrorism.

09:50.560 --> 09:53.280
So anyway, in relation to the initial question,

09:53.280 --> 09:55.440
why don't Muslims condemn terror attacks?

09:55.440 --> 09:58.240
Well, I have to conclude, they do.

09:58.960 --> 10:03.280
And if someone asks why they don't, then at best they're just ignorant of the truth,

10:03.280 --> 10:06.480
and at worst, they're actively being malicious.

10:06.480 --> 10:09.040
However, at this point watching this video,

10:09.040 --> 10:11.280
I am aware certain people will be thinking,

10:11.280 --> 10:17.280
well, some Muslims condemning terrorism, or supporting victims, or donating money and time.

10:17.280 --> 10:21.360
That's all very well and good, but the attacks are still happening, aren't they?

10:21.360 --> 10:24.880
These are all reactive measures, let's think proactive.

10:24.880 --> 10:30.480
Why aren't these so-called moderate Muslims putting a stop to terror attacks before they happen?

10:30.480 --> 10:34.720
I'm reminded that this clip of Sargon of Akkad I touched on in another video.

10:34.720 --> 10:39.200
In fact, I would expect moderate Muslims to be, I don't know,

10:39.200 --> 10:43.840
presumably dobbing in these potential terrorists, saying to the authorities,

10:43.840 --> 10:48.080
look, there's a mosque over there where they say some really radical shit,

10:48.080 --> 10:50.640
and I don't like it, because I think a terror attack might come out of it.

10:51.280 --> 10:52.640
That's what we need to be seeing.

10:53.360 --> 10:57.040
If you're a Muslim in Britain, and you abhor terrorist attacks,

10:57.040 --> 10:58.800
if you think this is the worst thing a person can do,

10:59.520 --> 11:02.560
you need to remain vigilant within your own community.

11:03.520 --> 11:07.520
I'm sorry that this is the case, I'm sorry that you have to be the one,

11:07.520 --> 11:12.080
but if you don't, people will think that you are complicit,

11:12.080 --> 11:15.920
that you do not mind that you are in some way permissive of this.

11:16.800 --> 11:21.360
Because I tell you what, if this was English people in my community doing this,

11:21.360 --> 11:24.640
you're fucking damn right I would be reporting them to the cops.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.480
That'd be the first fucking thing I'd do.

11:27.040 --> 11:31.920
So, well done to Karl, he would heroically and nobly stop the attacks

11:31.920 --> 11:35.600
if he knew about them, that is, by contacting the police.

11:35.600 --> 11:38.160
So why hasn't that been happening?

11:38.160 --> 11:42.000
Is it because the moderate Muslims secretly like the terror attacks happening,

11:42.000 --> 11:44.240
or is something else going on?

11:44.240 --> 11:45.360
Well, let's see.

11:45.360 --> 11:49.040
And let's first talk about a recent terror attack that didn't happen.

11:49.680 --> 11:52.080
On the 27th of April of this year,

11:52.080 --> 11:56.960
British national Khalid Ali was arrested on suspicion of planning a terror attack.

11:56.960 --> 12:01.120
He had a backpack with several knives in it when he was arrested by armed police.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.520
And when quoting the Times here,

12:03.520 --> 12:06.960
security sources said the investigation had been running for some time

12:06.960 --> 12:10.480
after a tip-off raising concerns about Mr Ali's behavior.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.840
The tip-off, understood to be from a family member,

12:13.840 --> 12:17.280
had prompted surveillance by police and MI5, it's understood.

12:17.280 --> 12:19.600
And furthermore, in March of this year,

12:19.600 --> 12:23.200
Mark Rowley, Britain's most senior counter-terrorism officer,

12:23.200 --> 12:28.640
said that in 2013, a total of 13 planned terror attacks had been foiled.

12:28.640 --> 12:30.560
Quoting Sky News here,

12:30.640 --> 12:34.400
Information from the public has contributed to stopping some of those attacks,

12:34.400 --> 12:37.600
while figures show it's also helped counter-terrorism police

12:37.600 --> 12:40.720
in a third of the most high-risk investigations.

12:40.720 --> 12:42.800
Mr Rowley told Sky News,

12:42.800 --> 12:45.360
It's my belief that without the public's help,

12:45.360 --> 12:49.200
some of the terror plots which we foiled would have been successful.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.840
So it seems like, in some cases at least,

12:51.840 --> 12:53.920
Muslims are actually contacting the police

12:53.920 --> 12:56.400
and preventing terror attacks from being carried out,

12:56.400 --> 12:59.040
and those people deserve all the praise in the world for that.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.960
They're saving lives.

13:00.960 --> 13:04.560
But you might say, well, what about the three attacks we're talking about?

13:04.560 --> 13:06.080
They didn't stop those, did they?

13:06.080 --> 13:09.040
Nobody contacted the police to inform on those people,

13:09.040 --> 13:11.280
or those attacks would never have happened.

13:11.840 --> 13:14.720
Well, you see, the thing is, that's not the case.

13:15.280 --> 13:17.440
For instance, let's look at the Manchester attack.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.680
He supports terrorism.

13:19.680 --> 13:22.400
Salman Abidi's Muslim peers warned cops about

13:22.400 --> 13:26.000
Manchester suicide bomber Salman Abidi five years ago.

13:26.080 --> 13:29.040
Police were tipped off by members of the Muslim community

13:29.040 --> 13:31.840
that Salman Abidi was a dangerous extremist.

13:31.840 --> 13:35.040
Two members of the public called a special anti-terrorist hotline

13:35.040 --> 13:37.280
to report the ISIS killer's horrific views.

13:37.840 --> 13:41.200
One community worker said two people who knew Abidi at college

13:41.200 --> 13:44.880
made separate calls to the police begging them to take action.

13:44.880 --> 13:48.000
And furthermore, in the case of the London Bridge attack,

13:48.000 --> 13:49.760
well, watch the following clip.

13:49.760 --> 13:58.800
And so that day, I realized that I needed to contact the authorities.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.520
I phoned the anti-terrorist hotline.

14:01.520 --> 14:04.320
I spoke to the gentleman, told him why and how.

14:05.120 --> 14:07.520
I told him about our conversation and how,

14:07.520 --> 14:10.320
and why I think he's been radicalized.

14:10.320 --> 14:12.480
And basically, you know, just doing my bit.

14:13.280 --> 14:14.240
And what claim of that?

14:14.880 --> 14:16.720
Nothing, absolutely nothing.

14:17.280 --> 14:20.560
They didn't get back to me, nor was he arrested or, you know,

14:20.560 --> 14:23.040
just picked up for any kind of questioning.

14:23.040 --> 14:28.000
Were there any other people in the community that tried to object to his views

14:28.000 --> 14:29.840
or to try and put him on another path?

14:29.840 --> 14:34.000
Yes, he was thrown out of a mosque maybe over a year and a half ago.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.640
His local mosque, because of his radical views.

14:37.280 --> 14:39.520
So they were reported to the police.

14:40.080 --> 14:43.040
Like in the cases of the 13 attacks that were prevented,

14:43.120 --> 14:45.120
these attacks, the successful attacks,

14:45.120 --> 14:47.760
are just the ones that slipped through the net.

14:47.760 --> 14:49.200
You know, the police were warned,

14:49.200 --> 14:52.640
but were still ultimately unable to stop them from happening.

14:52.640 --> 14:55.200
And I'm gonna say something not very popular right now,

14:55.200 --> 14:57.840
something you'll never hear a politician say, probably,

14:57.840 --> 14:59.760
because nobody wants to hear it.

14:59.760 --> 15:00.560
But it is true.

15:01.520 --> 15:03.760
You can't stop terrorism,

15:03.760 --> 15:06.400
which is sort of the point of terrorism, really.

15:06.400 --> 15:09.440
It wouldn't be scary if it was easily preventable, would it?

15:10.240 --> 15:12.000
Let me clarify a few things, though.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.720
I'm not saying we shouldn't try to prevent terrorism.

15:14.720 --> 15:17.680
You know, you can obviously prevent individual terror attacks,

15:17.680 --> 15:19.520
and for the ones that were not prevented,

15:19.520 --> 15:23.280
it's always good to examine how and why they were missed by the police.

15:23.280 --> 15:25.760
You know, on that level, on an individual level,

15:25.760 --> 15:27.920
terror attacks can be stopped.

15:27.920 --> 15:30.400
But stopping terrorism entirely?

15:30.400 --> 15:33.920
Well, it's a nice goal in theory, but it's just not possible.

15:33.920 --> 15:36.320
Or, at least if it is possible,

15:36.320 --> 15:39.440
it's not something that can be done quickly and easily.

15:39.440 --> 15:41.280
And in the worst case scenario,

15:41.280 --> 15:46.000
the blind pursuit of this goal will lead us down some very dark roads indeed.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.480
And I want to talk about that for a bit right now.

15:48.480 --> 15:51.360
I occasionally ask folks on Twitter what they would do

15:51.360 --> 15:54.000
to stop terror attacks from happening in this country.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.120
And I'd like to run through a bunch of the more common arguments I see

15:57.120 --> 16:00.000
in relation to the three attacks I've been talking about.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.240
The first argument is nearly always,

16:02.880 --> 16:06.800
restrict or outright prohibit immigration into the UK.

16:07.600 --> 16:11.200
But of course, the Westminster Bridge attacker Khalid Masood

16:11.280 --> 16:12.880
he was born in Kent.

16:12.880 --> 16:15.360
The Manchester bomber was born in Manchester.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.200
You know, they're British citizens.

16:17.200 --> 16:19.360
Unless you happen to have a time machine,

16:19.360 --> 16:22.720
no immigration law you can enact would have prevented these attacks.

16:22.720 --> 16:25.760
And even in cases where attackers aren't British citizens

16:25.760 --> 16:27.360
and weren't born in the UK,

16:27.360 --> 16:29.840
I mean, illegal immigration still exists

16:29.840 --> 16:32.480
and I don't imagine a guy who's fixing to blow himself up

16:32.480 --> 16:35.440
and murder a bunch of people is gonna be that put off

16:35.440 --> 16:37.600
by the thought of breaking immigration laws,

16:37.600 --> 16:38.720
to be perfectly honest.

16:38.720 --> 16:40.400
But, whatever.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.280
Another argument is to lay the blame on Islam.

16:43.280 --> 16:47.360
Islam should be banned and mosques closed down, I see people say.

16:47.360 --> 16:50.560
Now, ignoring that that course of action would involve

16:50.560 --> 16:52.080
breaking a whole shitload of laws

16:52.080 --> 16:54.560
and committing a bunch of human rights abuses,

16:54.560 --> 16:56.240
it doesn't make any practical sense

16:56.240 --> 16:58.800
in regards to our terrorists we're talking about here.

16:59.520 --> 17:02.640
One of the London attackers was confronted by other Muslims

17:02.640 --> 17:04.000
and thrown out of his mosque.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.080
You know, he wasn't radicalized there.

17:06.080 --> 17:09.520
In fact, the frightening truth of it is that anyone today

17:09.520 --> 17:12.560
with an internet connection can radicalize themselves.

17:12.560 --> 17:14.320
They don't need to be physically present

17:14.320 --> 17:16.560
in order to listen to a bunch of hate speech.

17:16.560 --> 17:18.880
They can be reading, watching and listening

17:18.880 --> 17:22.000
to all sorts of terrible stuff without ever leaving the house

17:22.000 --> 17:24.560
and if they don't tell anyone they're doing it,

17:24.560 --> 17:26.080
there's no way to know.

17:26.080 --> 17:28.640
This is why talk of changing immigration laws

17:28.640 --> 17:30.720
doesn't really make any sense to me.

17:30.720 --> 17:33.360
The problem isn't the people we have in the country,

17:33.360 --> 17:36.320
it's the ideologies that lead them to commit attacks

17:36.320 --> 17:37.840
and thanks to the internet,

17:37.840 --> 17:41.200
those ideas permeate borders and can infect anyone.

17:41.200 --> 17:44.320
You know, the Westminster attacker was a Muslim convert.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.640
Before he changed his name to Khalid Masood,

17:46.640 --> 17:50.560
he was called Adrian and he converted to Islam in his 40s.

17:50.560 --> 17:52.640
You know, how do you account for something like that?

17:53.280 --> 17:55.760
Adult British citizens who were born here

17:55.760 --> 17:58.720
converting to Islam and carrying out attacks, you know,

17:58.720 --> 18:01.040
changed the immigration laws to say whatever you want,

18:01.040 --> 18:03.040
you're not going to stop attacks like that.

18:03.040 --> 18:06.240
So how do we stop people who are using the internet

18:06.240 --> 18:07.520
to self-radicalize?

18:07.520 --> 18:11.680
Well, obviously the answer is to enact strict internet usage laws

18:11.680 --> 18:14.560
and give the police, intelligence services and government

18:14.560 --> 18:17.040
free reign to spy on whoever they want, right?

18:17.680 --> 18:20.320
Do you see where chasing the impossible goal

18:20.320 --> 18:23.200
of zero terror attacks immediately can lead?

18:23.200 --> 18:26.160
We've already done away with the separation of church and state

18:26.160 --> 18:28.000
and we're banning religions,

18:28.000 --> 18:31.200
we're censoring the internet and spying on innocent people

18:31.200 --> 18:34.800
all in the name of preventing something that we might not even prevent.

18:34.800 --> 18:39.200
You know, the police aren't perfect, clearly, and they can't catch everyone.

18:39.200 --> 18:42.480
And as a side note here, I'm personally not a huge fan of the police,

18:42.480 --> 18:45.280
or at least the police as they exist currently,

18:45.280 --> 18:49.120
but if the police are the ones who are expecting to deal with terrorism,

18:49.120 --> 18:52.320
then why anyone concerned about terrorism would vote for the party

18:52.320 --> 18:55.120
that's consistently cut police funding and numbers

18:55.120 --> 18:57.200
is a bit beyond me, to be honest.

18:57.200 --> 18:59.600
Anyway, so like Tantalus,

18:59.600 --> 19:03.600
the harder we reach for the goal of zero terror attacks immediately,

19:03.600 --> 19:06.000
the further into the distance it'll move,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.720
if you'll forgive me a slightly pretentious reference there.

19:09.360 --> 19:14.480
For instance, let's say we did go all the way down the path of authoritarian censorship.

19:14.480 --> 19:19.440
Let's say we gave the intelligence services full access to everybody's personal data

19:19.440 --> 19:23.200
and blocked all information from the internet that the government deemed dangerous

19:23.200 --> 19:29.200
and, I don't know, made it so anyone could be detained and tortured for information for any reason.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.720
Say, like, China.

19:30.720 --> 19:33.040
You know, that's how they do it over there.

19:33.040 --> 19:36.880
So that must be why there are no terror attacks in China, right?

19:36.880 --> 19:39.920
Except, of course, that's not true.

19:39.920 --> 19:42.080
There are terror attacks in China.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.080
Lots of terror attacks in China.

19:44.080 --> 19:49.280
And if they can't stop it with their draconian censorship laws and human rights abuses and so on,

19:49.280 --> 19:52.480
then I don't see why we'd fare any differently, to be honest.

19:52.480 --> 19:55.360
And then what happens when people start committing terror attacks

19:55.360 --> 19:57.600
to protest the human rights abuses?

19:57.600 --> 19:59.680
It's kind of a vicious cycle there.

19:59.680 --> 20:03.920
There is no easy fix for terrorism and these sorts of knee-jerk responses

20:03.920 --> 20:08.320
where we ban immigration, ban Islam, censor the internet and so on.

20:08.320 --> 20:12.240
Far from fixing the problem, I'd argue they'd only make it worse.

20:12.240 --> 20:16.560
And this is where I'd like to address the folks who wonder why leftists defend Islam.

20:16.560 --> 20:19.600
And the answer is... we don't, really.

20:19.600 --> 20:20.480
Let me explain.

20:20.480 --> 20:24.800
You know, as an internet guy who doesn't go on about how much he hates Muslims all the time,

20:25.360 --> 20:28.320
I get people sending me a lot of awful pictures.

20:28.320 --> 20:33.040
You know, ISIS executing people, homosexuals being thrown off buildings,

20:33.680 --> 20:37.040
female genital mutilations being performed on children and so on.

20:37.680 --> 20:38.960
All terrible stuff.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.520
And the people who send me these images say,

20:41.520 --> 20:44.560
look, this is what Islam is, this is what you're defending,

20:44.560 --> 20:47.680
these are the people you want immigrating into your country.

20:48.320 --> 20:51.520
And now, what these people seem not to realize

20:51.520 --> 20:54.720
is that there's always two people in the pictures they send me.

20:54.720 --> 20:57.600
There's someone doing something horrible, sure,

20:57.600 --> 21:01.520
but there's also someone having something horrible done to them.

21:01.520 --> 21:06.000
And they're people too, you know, they're not just props to prove how evil Islam is.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.480
Often, they're Muslims themselves.

21:08.480 --> 21:11.680
And I'm concerned about stopping those sorts of behaviors, of course,

21:11.680 --> 21:16.720
but tell me, how would restricting immigration put an end to those sorts of things?

21:17.520 --> 21:18.080
It wouldn't.

21:18.640 --> 21:20.080
They'd still happen.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.000
You know, all restricting immigration would do

21:22.000 --> 21:24.960
would give the people who might want to run away from those sorts of things

21:24.960 --> 21:28.160
the potential victims of those sorts of things

21:28.160 --> 21:30.880
one fewer safe place they could run away to.

21:30.880 --> 21:34.400
So when I seem like I'm defending Islam, I'm not.

21:34.400 --> 21:37.920
I'm certainly not defending the people who carry out terror attacks.

21:37.920 --> 21:42.240
I want to defend the people who oppose terrorism and who oppose extremism

21:42.240 --> 21:46.000
but might themselves be hurt by knee-jerk responses to terrorism

21:46.000 --> 21:49.600
on behalf of idiotic, short-sighted politicians.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.680
And while I was making this video,

21:52.240 --> 21:57.040
on the 19th of June, a van was driven into a crowd of people outside a mosque

21:57.040 --> 22:03.360
in Finsbury Park in London by a 47-year-old man from Cardiff called Darren Osborne

22:03.360 --> 22:05.760
and he was then thankfully restrained by the crowd

22:05.760 --> 22:08.800
before being able to escape or do any further damage.

22:08.800 --> 22:12.320
Just one more horrible incident that happened in London recently.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.120
But what can we learn from this attack?

22:15.120 --> 22:21.040
Well, I'd hope that it proves that any part of society can be targeted by terrorism.

22:21.680 --> 22:25.760
And any type of person can themselves become a terrorist.

22:25.760 --> 22:28.720
It is not a specifically Islamic problem.

22:28.720 --> 22:32.320
And the more focus we put onto extremist Islamic terrorists

22:32.320 --> 22:34.960
the more we will miss people like this guy.

22:34.960 --> 22:37.200
So I'll leave you with a question today.

22:37.200 --> 22:40.400
Why don't we see any Welsh guys condemning this attack?

22:40.400 --> 22:42.720
You know, could it be because all Welsh people

22:42.720 --> 22:45.840
secretly support Darren Osborne and his horrible actions?

22:46.800 --> 22:47.840
I don't know.

22:47.840 --> 22:50.480
I'm just asking questions, of course.

22:50.480 --> 22:53.680
But if they have been condemning it, I certainly haven't seen it.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.680
And I'm not gonna bother to go and look.

22:55.680 --> 22:59.920
But I think that just to be on the safe side in the meantime

22:59.920 --> 23:01.840
we should probably ban Wales.

23:02.880 --> 23:04.480
Thanks for watching, everyone.

23:04.480 --> 23:06.880
It's a bit of a serious video today.

23:06.880 --> 23:08.400
Not too many jokes in this one.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.440
Let me know what you think about that in the comments.

23:12.640 --> 23:14.640
Obligatory Patreon pitch.

23:16.080 --> 23:18.560
Head over to Patreon and pledge me a dollar

23:18.560 --> 23:24.240
and in my next video your name will get onto this increasingly unwieldy list of names.

23:24.240 --> 23:27.280
And I'll probably fall in love with you just a little bit as well.

23:28.160 --> 23:32.560
Also follow me on Twitter and send me a question over on Curious Cat if you like.

23:32.560 --> 23:33.760
Alrighty ho.

23:33.760 --> 23:34.960
See you later, folks.
