0	5720	Hello, everyone. Today we're going to be asking a question, a question that you may have seen elsewhere online.
5720	9800	Why don't moderate Muslims condemn terror attacks?
9800	15400	And we're going to be talking about that question in relation to free terror attacks that have taken place in the UK this year.
15400	21280	The Westminster attack on the 22nd of March, the Manchester Arena bombing on the 22nd of May,
21280	24000	and the London Bridge attack on the 3rd of June.
24080	30080	Three terrible and cowardly attacks that are carried out by five extremist Islamic terrorists.
30080	33120	Attacks which it should be easy for anyone to condemn.
33120	40480	This violence has no place in our society, and anyone who is a part of our society should accept and recognize that, obviously.
40480	45520	So, why don't we see so-called moderate Muslims condemning these attacks?
45520	48880	Could it be that they're all secret terrorist sympathizers?
49280	51760	Well, let's rewind a sec.
51760	55840	To answer this question, we first have to answer another question.
55840	59040	Do moderate Muslims condemn terror attacks?
59040	63200	You see, if we say, why don't moderate Muslims condemn terror attacks?
63200	67040	Well, that's a bit of a, have you stopped beating your wife, type thing.
67040	69200	What we call a loaded question.
69200	71920	It contains within it a presumption of guilt.
71920	78880	So what we're going to do today is go and check and see whether or not moderate Muslims are actually condemning terror attacks.
78960	82000	A brief note about the term moderate Muslim, though.
82000	84080	I'm not too happy with it, personally.
84080	89440	If, with regards to terror attacks, anyway, all you have are extremists and moderates,
89440	92800	that's sort of an artificial cropping of possibilities there,
92800	97280	as if the most that Muslims can be is moderately against terrorism.
97280	101680	The full scale would have a counter to extremists on the other side of the moderates.
101680	106880	Extremely nice Muslims, or something who are extremely against terrorism.
106880	112240	And they're not being taken into consideration if we just talk about Muslims in terms of extremists and moderates.
112240	117520	I'm gonna keep saying moderates in this video, if only because that's the language in the question I'm trying to answer,
117520	120240	but just keep in mind that I'm not too pleased about it.
120240	122880	And one more thing before we get into anything here.
122880	127200	I am aware of the meme of the leftist, liberal, social justice type
127200	132240	who leaps to the defense of Muslims in the aftermath of a terror attack, saying things like,
132320	133840	Not all Muslims are bad.
133840	136800	And making certain YouTubers' brains explode, you know.
136800	137760	How could it be?
137760	142720	They say that you would defend Islam after Muslims did such a terrible thing.
142720	150000	You know, these people are deeply religious, conservative, misogynist, anti-democratic, homophobic, you know.
150000	153200	All the things that you leftists say that you're against,
153200	156720	so why don't you apply those same criticisms to Islam?
156720	158880	And I have an answer for you there, don't worry,
158880	162640	but you're gonna have to stick around to the end of the video to hear it, I'm afraid.
162640	164880	So, that's something to look forward to, anyway.
165520	166880	So, let's get going.
166880	173120	On the 22nd of March 2017, 52-year-old Khalid Masood drove a car onto a pavement
173120	177760	and ran over pedestrians on Westminster Bridge in London, killing four people.
177760	183040	He then exited the car and fatally stabbed the police officer before being shot dead himself.
183040	185840	Masood stated in a text message sent before he died
185840	190160	that his actions were revenge for Western military intervention in the Middle East.
190160	193040	And it wasn't long before people online were wondering,
193040	195680	where are the moderate Muslims condemning this attack?
196240	201840	Twitter user Tony, with regards to the Islamic State praising the attack, asks,
201840	204640	where are the moderate Muslims condemning?
204640	206480	Ana Garz comments,
206480	210960	anybody notice the hordes of moderate Muslims coming out against the Westminster attack?
211600	212400	Me neither.
213040	215840	And at M. Teko Manx asks,
215840	218800	why all terrorists happen to be Muslim?
218800	223120	I haven't seen a single march of moderate Muslims against these scoundrels.
223840	229040	Well, M. Teko Manx, if you'd waited just a few days, that's exactly what you would have seen.
229040	230480	From The Independent,
230480	235360	Muslim women stand in solidarity with London terror attack victims on Westminster Bridge.
235360	237680	Muslim women have gathered on Westminster Bridge
237680	240960	in a show of solidarity with the victims of Wednesday's terror attack.
240960	244560	The group of women spoke of the overwhelming emotion they felt standing on the bridge
244560	247760	where dozens of people were mown down when terrorist Khalid Masood
247760	250080	plowed his car into pedestrians.
250080	252320	And the article quotes several people who were there.
252880	256320	Sarah Waseem, 57, from Surrey, said,
256320	259840	when an attack happens in London, it is an attack on me.
259840	261440	It's an attack on all of us.
261440	264400	Islam totally condemns violence of any sort.
264400	266000	This is abhorrent to us.
266000	269520	Being present for the demonstration shows people in the city are united
269520	272560	in support of democracy, says Ayasha Malik.
272560	276000	The 34-year-old mother of two, also from Surrey, said,
276000	281600	as a visible Muslim, I think it was important to show solidarity with the principles we all hold dear.
281600	285280	The principles of plurality, diversity, and so on.
285280	288560	So that's some Muslims there condemning the terror attack,
288560	291840	but that's just one bunch of people on a bridge, you might say.
291840	293840	What were some other Muslims up to?
293840	295360	Well, let's take a look.
295920	299280	The Muslim Council of Britain put out the following press release.
299280	302000	We are shocked and saddened by the incident at Westminster.
302000	303600	We condemn this attack.
303600	306400	And while it's still too early to speculate on the motives,
306400	309360	our thoughts and prayers are for the victims and those affected.
309360	310720	And they also released a video.
311360	317360	The attack in Westminster on Wednesday was a cowardly, depraved act, and it was wrong.
318800	322560	There is no justification whatsoever for this act of violence,
323200	325200	and we condemn it unequivocally.
325200	329120	So that's the attack condemned over at the Muslim Council of Britain.
329120	333120	But individual mosques around the country were also getting in on the condemning.
334000	338560	The East London Mosque, the oldest in the capital and the largest in the UK, said,
338560	341280	We're saddened by the appalling attack in Westminster
341280	343840	that resulted in tragic deaths and injuries.
343840	347440	Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims and their loved ones.
347440	349760	Such heinous acts of mindless violence
349760	353120	must not be allowed to cause division and hatred among our communities.
353680	357280	We must remain united and stand in solidarity with all.
357360	360480	In Birmingham, 55,000 copies of a booklet,
360480	364960	Terrorism is Not Islam, a 12-page guide produced by the city's central mosque
364960	366560	to answer questions such as,
366560	368720	are suicide attacks lawful in Islam,
368720	373760	and does the foreign policy of the West or other grievances justify killing non-Muslims,
373760	378880	were handed out at mosques, schools, and shops with the support of West Midlands Police.
378880	380560	And I took a peek at that booklet,
380560	383520	and it condemns violence and terrorism throughout,
383520	386960	and at the end it lists all the mosques that supported and endorsed it,
386960	388640	so good stuff there.
388640	391520	They're clearly getting it done down in Birmingham.
391520	394400	And here's another story from the Huffington Post.
394400	397280	London terror attack fundraiser led by Muslims
397280	399920	raises thousands to help victims' families.
399920	405520	I decided to launch this campaign to raise money for victims of yesterday's terrible attack.
405520	410960	I was unfortunately holed up in parliament for around four hours yesterday
410960	413360	and witnessed a lot of terrible carnage.
413360	416880	Saw a number of bodies on the streets, paramedics, police everywhere.
417440	420560	It moved me quite a bit, and when I got home last night
420560	422480	I realised that I'd gone through a terrible experience,
422480	424960	but it must be a lot worse for the victims of the attack.
424960	428880	And this is my city, these are my neighbours,
428880	431040	and I felt that I had to do something,
431040	434720	so I called up a bunch of my friends and we launched this campaign.
434720	436800	We've raised over £5,000 already,
437520	440560	and we'd love for everyone to help us to do something good
440560	446080	and to ensure that at least something positive comes out for the victims of these families.
447680	451120	And by the time the Muslims United for London project closed,
451120	455200	they'd raised over £29,000 for the victims of the attack.
455200	456400	So that's nice.
456400	460800	So we've got Muslims condemning the attack, marching with the victims,
460800	462800	raising thousands of pounds in support,
463680	466640	and, well, I don't want to come to any premature conclusions here,
466640	469040	maybe the Westminster attack was an anomaly,
469040	471040	you know, maybe it's not always like this,
471040	473280	so let's take a look at the other incidents.
473920	476080	On the 22nd of May this year,
476080	482000	a man called Salman Abadi detonated a nail bomb outside the Manchester Arena in Manchester,
482000	485360	killing 23 people, including himself.
485360	488080	So, did Muslims condemn this attack?
488080	491840	Well, here's a vigil for the victims with a bunch of religious leaders,
491840	495520	including Muslims, all holding hands and speaking out against the attack.
496240	499680	Here's a bunch of Muslims doing a march to condemn the attack,
499680	503200	and here's a donation campaign called Muslims for Manchester
503200	507040	that raised over £27,000 for the victims of the attack.
507040	511520	Pretty much exactly the same actions that were taken with the Westminster attack, to be honest.
511520	513360	So that's two out of three.
513920	516960	Let's take a look at the third one, the London Bridge attack.
516960	520080	And I don't really want to belabor the point here, but here we go.
520800	524880	100 Muslim leaders gather on London Bridge to condemn attacks.
524880	527360	ISIS will lose. Love will win.
527360	530800	Your views are not welcome in our mosques or in our communities.
532000	536480	Muslims hand out thousands of roses in solidarity with terror victims.
536480	538800	And there's an interesting one here.
538800	543600	More than 130 British imams refused to bury London attackers.
543600	547680	We will not perform the traditional Islamic funeral prayer for the perpetrators,
547680	550720	and we also urge fellow imams and religious authorities
550720	553440	to withdraw such a privilege, the Muslim leaders said.
554240	558640	These vile murderers seek to divide our society and instill fear.
558640	560320	We will ensure they fail.
560320	562080	We implore everyone to unite.
562080	566240	We are one community in the face of such dastardly cowardice.
566240	570560	Unlike the terrorists, we must uphold love and compassion.
570560	574880	Thousands of Muslims worldwide have likewise condemned terrorism in recent years,
574880	581440	as noted in a 712-page Google document maintained by an American Muslim student.
582080	584880	And I'll put a link to that Google document in the description
584880	590560	if you want easy access to a seemingly never-ending list of Muslims condemning terrorism.
590560	593280	So anyway, in relation to the initial question,
593280	595440	why don't Muslims condemn terror attacks?
595440	598240	Well, I have to conclude, they do.
598960	603280	And if someone asks why they don't, then at best they're just ignorant of the truth,
603280	606480	and at worst, they're actively being malicious.
606480	609040	However, at this point watching this video,
609040	611280	I am aware certain people will be thinking,
611280	617280	well, some Muslims condemning terrorism, or supporting victims, or donating money and time.
617280	621360	That's all very well and good, but the attacks are still happening, aren't they?
621360	624880	These are all reactive measures, let's think proactive.
624880	630480	Why aren't these so-called moderate Muslims putting a stop to terror attacks before they happen?
630480	634720	I'm reminded that this clip of Sargon of Akkad I touched on in another video.
634720	639200	In fact, I would expect moderate Muslims to be, I don't know,
639200	643840	presumably dobbing in these potential terrorists, saying to the authorities,
643840	648080	look, there's a mosque over there where they say some really radical shit,
648080	650640	and I don't like it, because I think a terror attack might come out of it.
651280	652640	That's what we need to be seeing.
653360	657040	If you're a Muslim in Britain, and you abhor terrorist attacks,
657040	658800	if you think this is the worst thing a person can do,
659520	662560	you need to remain vigilant within your own community.
663520	667520	I'm sorry that this is the case, I'm sorry that you have to be the one,
667520	672080	but if you don't, people will think that you are complicit,
672080	675920	that you do not mind that you are in some way permissive of this.
676800	681360	Because I tell you what, if this was English people in my community doing this,
681360	684640	you're fucking damn right I would be reporting them to the cops.
684640	686480	That'd be the first fucking thing I'd do.
687040	691920	So, well done to Karl, he would heroically and nobly stop the attacks
691920	695600	if he knew about them, that is, by contacting the police.
695600	698160	So why hasn't that been happening?
698160	702000	Is it because the moderate Muslims secretly like the terror attacks happening,
702000	704240	or is something else going on?
704240	705360	Well, let's see.
705360	709040	And let's first talk about a recent terror attack that didn't happen.
709680	712080	On the 27th of April of this year,
712080	716960	British national Khalid Ali was arrested on suspicion of planning a terror attack.
716960	721120	He had a backpack with several knives in it when he was arrested by armed police.
721680	723520	And when quoting the Times here,
723520	726960	security sources said the investigation had been running for some time
726960	730480	after a tip-off raising concerns about Mr Ali's behavior.
730480	733840	The tip-off, understood to be from a family member,
733840	737280	had prompted surveillance by police and MI5, it's understood.
737280	739600	And furthermore, in March of this year,
739600	743200	Mark Rowley, Britain's most senior counter-terrorism officer,
743200	748640	said that in 2013, a total of 13 planned terror attacks had been foiled.
748640	750560	Quoting Sky News here,
750640	754400	Information from the public has contributed to stopping some of those attacks,
754400	757600	while figures show it's also helped counter-terrorism police
757600	760720	in a third of the most high-risk investigations.
760720	762800	Mr Rowley told Sky News,
762800	765360	It's my belief that without the public's help,
765360	769200	some of the terror plots which we foiled would have been successful.
769200	771840	So it seems like, in some cases at least,
771840	773920	Muslims are actually contacting the police
773920	776400	and preventing terror attacks from being carried out,
776400	779040	and those people deserve all the praise in the world for that.
779040	780960	They're saving lives.
780960	784560	But you might say, well, what about the three attacks we're talking about?
784560	786080	They didn't stop those, did they?
786080	789040	Nobody contacted the police to inform on those people,
789040	791280	or those attacks would never have happened.
791840	794720	Well, you see, the thing is, that's not the case.
795280	797440	For instance, let's look at the Manchester attack.
798000	799680	He supports terrorism.
799680	802400	Salman Abidi's Muslim peers warned cops about
802400	806000	Manchester suicide bomber Salman Abidi five years ago.
806080	809040	Police were tipped off by members of the Muslim community
809040	811840	that Salman Abidi was a dangerous extremist.
811840	815040	Two members of the public called a special anti-terrorist hotline
815040	817280	to report the ISIS killer's horrific views.
817840	821200	One community worker said two people who knew Abidi at college
821200	824880	made separate calls to the police begging them to take action.
824880	828000	And furthermore, in the case of the London Bridge attack,
828000	829760	well, watch the following clip.
829760	838800	And so that day, I realized that I needed to contact the authorities.
839360	841520	I phoned the anti-terrorist hotline.
841520	844320	I spoke to the gentleman, told him why and how.
845120	847520	I told him about our conversation and how,
847520	850320	and why I think he's been radicalized.
850320	852480	And basically, you know, just doing my bit.
853280	854240	And what claim of that?
854880	856720	Nothing, absolutely nothing.
857280	860560	They didn't get back to me, nor was he arrested or, you know,
860560	863040	just picked up for any kind of questioning.
863040	868000	Were there any other people in the community that tried to object to his views
868000	869840	or to try and put him on another path?
869840	874000	Yes, he was thrown out of a mosque maybe over a year and a half ago.
874000	876640	His local mosque, because of his radical views.
877280	879520	So they were reported to the police.
880080	883040	Like in the cases of the 13 attacks that were prevented,
883120	885120	these attacks, the successful attacks,
885120	887760	are just the ones that slipped through the net.
887760	889200	You know, the police were warned,
889200	892640	but were still ultimately unable to stop them from happening.
892640	895200	And I'm gonna say something not very popular right now,
895200	897840	something you'll never hear a politician say, probably,
897840	899760	because nobody wants to hear it.
899760	900560	But it is true.
901520	903760	You can't stop terrorism,
903760	906400	which is sort of the point of terrorism, really.
906400	909440	It wouldn't be scary if it was easily preventable, would it?
910240	912000	Let me clarify a few things, though.
912000	914720	I'm not saying we shouldn't try to prevent terrorism.
914720	917680	You know, you can obviously prevent individual terror attacks,
917680	919520	and for the ones that were not prevented,
919520	923280	it's always good to examine how and why they were missed by the police.
923280	925760	You know, on that level, on an individual level,
925760	927920	terror attacks can be stopped.
927920	930400	But stopping terrorism entirely?
930400	933920	Well, it's a nice goal in theory, but it's just not possible.
933920	936320	Or, at least if it is possible,
936320	939440	it's not something that can be done quickly and easily.
939440	941280	And in the worst case scenario,
941280	946000	the blind pursuit of this goal will lead us down some very dark roads indeed.
946000	948480	And I want to talk about that for a bit right now.
948480	951360	I occasionally ask folks on Twitter what they would do
951360	954000	to stop terror attacks from happening in this country.
954000	957120	And I'd like to run through a bunch of the more common arguments I see
957120	960000	in relation to the three attacks I've been talking about.
960000	962240	The first argument is nearly always,
962880	966800	restrict or outright prohibit immigration into the UK.
967600	971200	But of course, the Westminster Bridge attacker Khalid Masood
971280	972880	he was born in Kent.
972880	975360	The Manchester bomber was born in Manchester.
975360	977200	You know, they're British citizens.
977200	979360	Unless you happen to have a time machine,
979360	982720	no immigration law you can enact would have prevented these attacks.
982720	985760	And even in cases where attackers aren't British citizens
985760	987360	and weren't born in the UK,
987360	989840	I mean, illegal immigration still exists
989840	992480	and I don't imagine a guy who's fixing to blow himself up
992480	995440	and murder a bunch of people is gonna be that put off
995440	997600	by the thought of breaking immigration laws,
997600	998720	to be perfectly honest.
998720	1000400	But, whatever.
1000400	1003280	Another argument is to lay the blame on Islam.
1003280	1007360	Islam should be banned and mosques closed down, I see people say.
1007360	1010560	Now, ignoring that that course of action would involve
1010560	1012080	breaking a whole shitload of laws
1012080	1014560	and committing a bunch of human rights abuses,
1014560	1016240	it doesn't make any practical sense
1016240	1018800	in regards to our terrorists we're talking about here.
1019520	1022640	One of the London attackers was confronted by other Muslims
1022640	1024000	and thrown out of his mosque.
1024000	1026080	You know, he wasn't radicalized there.
1026080	1029520	In fact, the frightening truth of it is that anyone today
1029520	1032560	with an internet connection can radicalize themselves.
1032560	1034320	They don't need to be physically present
1034320	1036560	in order to listen to a bunch of hate speech.
1036560	1038880	They can be reading, watching and listening
1038880	1042000	to all sorts of terrible stuff without ever leaving the house
1042000	1044560	and if they don't tell anyone they're doing it,
1044560	1046080	there's no way to know.
1046080	1048640	This is why talk of changing immigration laws
1048640	1050720	doesn't really make any sense to me.
1050720	1053360	The problem isn't the people we have in the country,
1053360	1056320	it's the ideologies that lead them to commit attacks
1056320	1057840	and thanks to the internet,
1057840	1061200	those ideas permeate borders and can infect anyone.
1061200	1064320	You know, the Westminster attacker was a Muslim convert.
1064320	1066640	Before he changed his name to Khalid Masood,
1066640	1070560	he was called Adrian and he converted to Islam in his 40s.
1070560	1072640	You know, how do you account for something like that?
1073280	1075760	Adult British citizens who were born here
1075760	1078720	converting to Islam and carrying out attacks, you know,
1078720	1081040	changed the immigration laws to say whatever you want,
1081040	1083040	you're not going to stop attacks like that.
1083040	1086240	So how do we stop people who are using the internet
1086240	1087520	to self-radicalize?
1087520	1091680	Well, obviously the answer is to enact strict internet usage laws
1091680	1094560	and give the police, intelligence services and government
1094560	1097040	free reign to spy on whoever they want, right?
1097680	1100320	Do you see where chasing the impossible goal
1100320	1103200	of zero terror attacks immediately can lead?
1103200	1106160	We've already done away with the separation of church and state
1106160	1108000	and we're banning religions,
1108000	1111200	we're censoring the internet and spying on innocent people
1111200	1114800	all in the name of preventing something that we might not even prevent.
1114800	1119200	You know, the police aren't perfect, clearly, and they can't catch everyone.
1119200	1122480	And as a side note here, I'm personally not a huge fan of the police,
1122480	1125280	or at least the police as they exist currently,
1125280	1129120	but if the police are the ones who are expecting to deal with terrorism,
1129120	1132320	then why anyone concerned about terrorism would vote for the party
1132320	1135120	that's consistently cut police funding and numbers
1135120	1137200	is a bit beyond me, to be honest.
1137200	1139600	Anyway, so like Tantalus,
1139600	1143600	the harder we reach for the goal of zero terror attacks immediately,
1143600	1146000	the further into the distance it'll move,
1146000	1148720	if you'll forgive me a slightly pretentious reference there.
1149360	1154480	For instance, let's say we did go all the way down the path of authoritarian censorship.
1154480	1159440	Let's say we gave the intelligence services full access to everybody's personal data
1159440	1163200	and blocked all information from the internet that the government deemed dangerous
1163200	1169200	and, I don't know, made it so anyone could be detained and tortured for information for any reason.
1169200	1170720	Say, like, China.
1170720	1173040	You know, that's how they do it over there.
1173040	1176880	So that must be why there are no terror attacks in China, right?
1176880	1179920	Except, of course, that's not true.
1179920	1182080	There are terror attacks in China.
1182080	1184080	Lots of terror attacks in China.
1184080	1189280	And if they can't stop it with their draconian censorship laws and human rights abuses and so on,
1189280	1192480	then I don't see why we'd fare any differently, to be honest.
1192480	1195360	And then what happens when people start committing terror attacks
1195360	1197600	to protest the human rights abuses?
1197600	1199680	It's kind of a vicious cycle there.
1199680	1203920	There is no easy fix for terrorism and these sorts of knee-jerk responses
1203920	1208320	where we ban immigration, ban Islam, censor the internet and so on.
1208320	1212240	Far from fixing the problem, I'd argue they'd only make it worse.
1212240	1216560	And this is where I'd like to address the folks who wonder why leftists defend Islam.
1216560	1219600	And the answer is... we don't, really.
1219600	1220480	Let me explain.
1220480	1224800	You know, as an internet guy who doesn't go on about how much he hates Muslims all the time,
1225360	1228320	I get people sending me a lot of awful pictures.
1228320	1233040	You know, ISIS executing people, homosexuals being thrown off buildings,
1233680	1237040	female genital mutilations being performed on children and so on.
1237680	1238960	All terrible stuff.
1239600	1241520	And the people who send me these images say,
1241520	1244560	look, this is what Islam is, this is what you're defending,
1244560	1247680	these are the people you want immigrating into your country.
1248320	1251520	And now, what these people seem not to realize
1251520	1254720	is that there's always two people in the pictures they send me.
1254720	1257600	There's someone doing something horrible, sure,
1257600	1261520	but there's also someone having something horrible done to them.
1261520	1266000	And they're people too, you know, they're not just props to prove how evil Islam is.
1266000	1268480	Often, they're Muslims themselves.
1268480	1271680	And I'm concerned about stopping those sorts of behaviors, of course,
1271680	1276720	but tell me, how would restricting immigration put an end to those sorts of things?
1277520	1278080	It wouldn't.
1278640	1280080	They'd still happen.
1280080	1282000	You know, all restricting immigration would do
1282000	1284960	would give the people who might want to run away from those sorts of things
1284960	1288160	the potential victims of those sorts of things
1288160	1290880	one fewer safe place they could run away to.
1290880	1294400	So when I seem like I'm defending Islam, I'm not.
1294400	1297920	I'm certainly not defending the people who carry out terror attacks.
1297920	1302240	I want to defend the people who oppose terrorism and who oppose extremism
1302240	1306000	but might themselves be hurt by knee-jerk responses to terrorism
1306000	1309600	on behalf of idiotic, short-sighted politicians.
1309600	1311680	And while I was making this video,
1312240	1317040	on the 19th of June, a van was driven into a crowd of people outside a mosque
1317040	1323360	in Finsbury Park in London by a 47-year-old man from Cardiff called Darren Osborne
1323360	1325760	and he was then thankfully restrained by the crowd
1325760	1328800	before being able to escape or do any further damage.
1328800	1332320	Just one more horrible incident that happened in London recently.
1333040	1335120	But what can we learn from this attack?
1335120	1341040	Well, I'd hope that it proves that any part of society can be targeted by terrorism.
1341680	1345760	And any type of person can themselves become a terrorist.
1345760	1348720	It is not a specifically Islamic problem.
1348720	1352320	And the more focus we put onto extremist Islamic terrorists
1352320	1354960	the more we will miss people like this guy.
1354960	1357200	So I'll leave you with a question today.
1357200	1360400	Why don't we see any Welsh guys condemning this attack?
1360400	1362720	You know, could it be because all Welsh people
1362720	1365840	secretly support Darren Osborne and his horrible actions?
1366800	1367840	I don't know.
1367840	1370480	I'm just asking questions, of course.
1370480	1373680	But if they have been condemning it, I certainly haven't seen it.
1373680	1375680	And I'm not gonna bother to go and look.
1375680	1379920	But I think that just to be on the safe side in the meantime
1379920	1381840	we should probably ban Wales.
1382880	1384480	Thanks for watching, everyone.
1384480	1386880	It's a bit of a serious video today.
1386880	1388400	Not too many jokes in this one.
1389120	1391440	Let me know what you think about that in the comments.
1392640	1394640	Obligatory Patreon pitch.
1396080	1398560	Head over to Patreon and pledge me a dollar
1398560	1404240	and in my next video your name will get onto this increasingly unwieldy list of names.
1404240	1407280	And I'll probably fall in love with you just a little bit as well.
1408160	1412560	Also follow me on Twitter and send me a question over on Curious Cat if you like.
1412560	1413760	Alrighty ho.
1413760	1414960	See you later, folks.
