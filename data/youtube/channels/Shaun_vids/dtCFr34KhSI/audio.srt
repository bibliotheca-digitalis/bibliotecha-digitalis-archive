00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Hello, everyone. Today we're going to be asking a question, a question that you may have seen elsewhere online.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,800
Why don't moderate Muslims condemn terror attacks?

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,400
And we're going to be talking about that question in relation to free terror attacks that have taken place in the UK this year.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,280
The Westminster attack on the 22nd of March, the Manchester Arena bombing on the 22nd of May,

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,000
and the London Bridge attack on the 3rd of June.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:30,080
Three terrible and cowardly attacks that are carried out by five extremist Islamic terrorists.

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,120
Attacks which it should be easy for anyone to condemn.

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:40,480
This violence has no place in our society, and anyone who is a part of our society should accept and recognize that, obviously.

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,520
So, why don't we see so-called moderate Muslims condemning these attacks?

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,880
Could it be that they're all secret terrorist sympathizers?

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,760
Well, let's rewind a sec.

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,840
To answer this question, we first have to answer another question.

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,040
Do moderate Muslims condemn terror attacks?

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,200
You see, if we say, why don't moderate Muslims condemn terror attacks?

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,040
Well, that's a bit of a, have you stopped beating your wife, type thing.

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,200
What we call a loaded question.

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,920
It contains within it a presumption of guilt.

18
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:18,880
So what we're going to do today is go and check and see whether or not moderate Muslims are actually condemning terror attacks.

19
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,000
A brief note about the term moderate Muslim, though.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,080
I'm not too happy with it, personally.

21
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,440
If, with regards to terror attacks, anyway, all you have are extremists and moderates,

22
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,800
that's sort of an artificial cropping of possibilities there,

23
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,280
as if the most that Muslims can be is moderately against terrorism.

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,680
The full scale would have a counter to extremists on the other side of the moderates.

25
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,880
Extremely nice Muslims, or something who are extremely against terrorism.

26
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,240
And they're not being taken into consideration if we just talk about Muslims in terms of extremists and moderates.

27
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,520
I'm gonna keep saying moderates in this video, if only because that's the language in the question I'm trying to answer,

28
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,240
but just keep in mind that I'm not too pleased about it.

29
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,880
And one more thing before we get into anything here.

30
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,200
I am aware of the meme of the leftist, liberal, social justice type

31
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,240
who leaps to the defense of Muslims in the aftermath of a terror attack, saying things like,

32
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,840
Not all Muslims are bad.

33
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,800
And making certain YouTubers' brains explode, you know.

34
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,760
How could it be?

35
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,720
They say that you would defend Islam after Muslims did such a terrible thing.

36
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:30,000
You know, these people are deeply religious, conservative, misogynist, anti-democratic, homophobic, you know.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,200
All the things that you leftists say that you're against,

38
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,720
so why don't you apply those same criticisms to Islam?

39
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,880
And I have an answer for you there, don't worry,

40
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,640
but you're gonna have to stick around to the end of the video to hear it, I'm afraid.

41
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,880
So, that's something to look forward to, anyway.

42
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,880
So, let's get going.

43
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:53,120
On the 22nd of March 2017, 52-year-old Khalid Masood drove a car onto a pavement

44
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,760
and ran over pedestrians on Westminster Bridge in London, killing four people.

45
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,040
He then exited the car and fatally stabbed the police officer before being shot dead himself.

46
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,840
Masood stated in a text message sent before he died

47
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,160
that his actions were revenge for Western military intervention in the Middle East.

48
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,040
And it wasn't long before people online were wondering,

49
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,680
where are the moderate Muslims condemning this attack?

50
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,840
Twitter user Tony, with regards to the Islamic State praising the attack, asks,

51
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,640
where are the moderate Muslims condemning?

52
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,480
Ana Garz comments,

53
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,960
anybody notice the hordes of moderate Muslims coming out against the Westminster attack?

54
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,400
Me neither.

55
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,840
And at M. Teko Manx asks,

56
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,800
why all terrorists happen to be Muslim?

57
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,120
I haven't seen a single march of moderate Muslims against these scoundrels.

58
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,040
Well, M. Teko Manx, if you'd waited just a few days, that's exactly what you would have seen.

59
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,480
From The Independent,

60
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,360
Muslim women stand in solidarity with London terror attack victims on Westminster Bridge.

61
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,680
Muslim women have gathered on Westminster Bridge

62
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,960
in a show of solidarity with the victims of Wednesday's terror attack.

63
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,560
The group of women spoke of the overwhelming emotion they felt standing on the bridge

64
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,760
where dozens of people were mown down when terrorist Khalid Masood

65
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,080
plowed his car into pedestrians.

66
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,320
And the article quotes several people who were there.

67
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,320
Sarah Waseem, 57, from Surrey, said,

68
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,840
when an attack happens in London, it is an attack on me.

69
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,440
It's an attack on all of us.

70
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,400
Islam totally condemns violence of any sort.

71
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,000
This is abhorrent to us.

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,520
Being present for the demonstration shows people in the city are united

73
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,560
in support of democracy, says Ayasha Malik.

74
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,000
The 34-year-old mother of two, also from Surrey, said,

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,600
as a visible Muslim, I think it was important to show solidarity with the principles we all hold dear.

76
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,280
The principles of plurality, diversity, and so on.

77
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,560
So that's some Muslims there condemning the terror attack,

78
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,840
but that's just one bunch of people on a bridge, you might say.

79
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,840
What were some other Muslims up to?

80
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,360
Well, let's take a look.

81
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,280
The Muslim Council of Britain put out the following press release.

82
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,000
We are shocked and saddened by the incident at Westminster.

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,600
We condemn this attack.

84
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,400
And while it's still too early to speculate on the motives,

85
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,360
our thoughts and prayers are for the victims and those affected.

86
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,720
And they also released a video.

87
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,360
The attack in Westminster on Wednesday was a cowardly, depraved act, and it was wrong.

88
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,560
There is no justification whatsoever for this act of violence,

89
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,200
and we condemn it unequivocally.

90
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,120
So that's the attack condemned over at the Muslim Council of Britain.

91
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,120
But individual mosques around the country were also getting in on the condemning.

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,560
The East London Mosque, the oldest in the capital and the largest in the UK, said,

93
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,280
We're saddened by the appalling attack in Westminster

94
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,840
that resulted in tragic deaths and injuries.

95
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,440
Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims and their loved ones.

96
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,760
Such heinous acts of mindless violence

97
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,120
must not be allowed to cause division and hatred among our communities.

98
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,280
We must remain united and stand in solidarity with all.

99
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,480
In Birmingham, 55,000 copies of a booklet,

100
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,960
Terrorism is Not Islam, a 12-page guide produced by the city's central mosque

101
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,560
to answer questions such as,

102
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,720
are suicide attacks lawful in Islam,

103
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,760
and does the foreign policy of the West or other grievances justify killing non-Muslims,

104
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,880
were handed out at mosques, schools, and shops with the support of West Midlands Police.

105
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,560
And I took a peek at that booklet,

106
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,520
and it condemns violence and terrorism throughout,

107
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,960
and at the end it lists all the mosques that supported and endorsed it,

108
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,640
so good stuff there.

109
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,520
They're clearly getting it done down in Birmingham.

110
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,400
And here's another story from the Huffington Post.

111
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,280
London terror attack fundraiser led by Muslims

112
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,920
raises thousands to help victims' families.

113
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:45,520
I decided to launch this campaign to raise money for victims of yesterday's terrible attack.

114
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,960
I was unfortunately holed up in parliament for around four hours yesterday

115
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,360
and witnessed a lot of terrible carnage.

116
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,880
Saw a number of bodies on the streets, paramedics, police everywhere.

117
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,560
It moved me quite a bit, and when I got home last night

118
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,480
I realised that I'd gone through a terrible experience,

119
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,960
but it must be a lot worse for the victims of the attack.

120
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,880
And this is my city, these are my neighbours,

121
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,040
and I felt that I had to do something,

122
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,720
so I called up a bunch of my friends and we launched this campaign.

123
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,800
We've raised over £5,000 already,

124
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,560
and we'd love for everyone to help us to do something good

125
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,080
and to ensure that at least something positive comes out for the victims of these families.

126
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,120
And by the time the Muslims United for London project closed,

127
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,200
they'd raised over £29,000 for the victims of the attack.

128
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,400
So that's nice.

129
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,800
So we've got Muslims condemning the attack, marching with the victims,

130
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
raising thousands of pounds in support,

131
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,640
and, well, I don't want to come to any premature conclusions here,

132
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,040
maybe the Westminster attack was an anomaly,

133
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,040
you know, maybe it's not always like this,

134
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,280
so let's take a look at the other incidents.

135
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,080
On the 22nd of May this year,

136
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,000
a man called Salman Abadi detonated a nail bomb outside the Manchester Arena in Manchester,

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,360
killing 23 people, including himself.

138
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,080
So, did Muslims condemn this attack?

139
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,840
Well, here's a vigil for the victims with a bunch of religious leaders,

140
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,520
including Muslims, all holding hands and speaking out against the attack.

141
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,680
Here's a bunch of Muslims doing a march to condemn the attack,

142
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,200
and here's a donation campaign called Muslims for Manchester

143
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,040
that raised over £27,000 for the victims of the attack.

144
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,520
Pretty much exactly the same actions that were taken with the Westminster attack, to be honest.

145
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,360
So that's two out of three.

146
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,960
Let's take a look at the third one, the London Bridge attack.

147
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,080
And I don't really want to belabor the point here, but here we go.

148
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,880
100 Muslim leaders gather on London Bridge to condemn attacks.

149
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,360
ISIS will lose. Love will win.

150
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,800
Your views are not welcome in our mosques or in our communities.

151
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,480
Muslims hand out thousands of roses in solidarity with terror victims.

152
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,800
And there's an interesting one here.

153
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,600
More than 130 British imams refused to bury London attackers.

154
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,680
We will not perform the traditional Islamic funeral prayer for the perpetrators,

155
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,720
and we also urge fellow imams and religious authorities

156
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,440
to withdraw such a privilege, the Muslim leaders said.

157
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,640
These vile murderers seek to divide our society and instill fear.

158
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,320
We will ensure they fail.

159
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,080
We implore everyone to unite.

160
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,240
We are one community in the face of such dastardly cowardice.

161
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,560
Unlike the terrorists, we must uphold love and compassion.

162
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,880
Thousands of Muslims worldwide have likewise condemned terrorism in recent years,

163
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,440
as noted in a 712-page Google document maintained by an American Muslim student.

164
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,880
And I'll put a link to that Google document in the description

165
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,560
if you want easy access to a seemingly never-ending list of Muslims condemning terrorism.

166
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,280
So anyway, in relation to the initial question,

167
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,440
why don't Muslims condemn terror attacks?

168
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,240
Well, I have to conclude, they do.

169
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,280
And if someone asks why they don't, then at best they're just ignorant of the truth,

170
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,480
and at worst, they're actively being malicious.

171
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,040
However, at this point watching this video,

172
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,280
I am aware certain people will be thinking,

173
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:17,280
well, some Muslims condemning terrorism, or supporting victims, or donating money and time.

174
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,360
That's all very well and good, but the attacks are still happening, aren't they?

175
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,880
These are all reactive measures, let's think proactive.

176
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,480
Why aren't these so-called moderate Muslims putting a stop to terror attacks before they happen?

177
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,720
I'm reminded that this clip of Sargon of Akkad I touched on in another video.

178
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,200
In fact, I would expect moderate Muslims to be, I don't know,

179
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,840
presumably dobbing in these potential terrorists, saying to the authorities,

180
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,080
look, there's a mosque over there where they say some really radical shit,

181
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,640
and I don't like it, because I think a terror attack might come out of it.

182
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,640
That's what we need to be seeing.

183
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,040
If you're a Muslim in Britain, and you abhor terrorist attacks,

184
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,800
if you think this is the worst thing a person can do,

185
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,560
you need to remain vigilant within your own community.

186
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,520
I'm sorry that this is the case, I'm sorry that you have to be the one,

187
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,080
but if you don't, people will think that you are complicit,

188
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,920
that you do not mind that you are in some way permissive of this.

189
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,360
Because I tell you what, if this was English people in my community doing this,

190
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,640
you're fucking damn right I would be reporting them to the cops.

191
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,480
That'd be the first fucking thing I'd do.

192
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,920
So, well done to Karl, he would heroically and nobly stop the attacks

193
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,600
if he knew about them, that is, by contacting the police.

194
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,160
So why hasn't that been happening?

195
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,000
Is it because the moderate Muslims secretly like the terror attacks happening,

196
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,240
or is something else going on?

197
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,360
Well, let's see.

198
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,040
And let's first talk about a recent terror attack that didn't happen.

199
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,080
On the 27th of April of this year,

200
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,960
British national Khalid Ali was arrested on suspicion of planning a terror attack.

201
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,120
He had a backpack with several knives in it when he was arrested by armed police.

202
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,520
And when quoting the Times here,

203
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,960
security sources said the investigation had been running for some time

204
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,480
after a tip-off raising concerns about Mr Ali's behavior.

205
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,840
The tip-off, understood to be from a family member,

206
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,280
had prompted surveillance by police and MI5, it's understood.

207
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,600
And furthermore, in March of this year,

208
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,200
Mark Rowley, Britain's most senior counter-terrorism officer,

209
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,640
said that in 2013, a total of 13 planned terror attacks had been foiled.

210
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,560
Quoting Sky News here,

211
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,400
Information from the public has contributed to stopping some of those attacks,

212
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,600
while figures show it's also helped counter-terrorism police

213
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,720
in a third of the most high-risk investigations.

214
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,800
Mr Rowley told Sky News,

215
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,360
It's my belief that without the public's help,

216
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,200
some of the terror plots which we foiled would have been successful.

217
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,840
So it seems like, in some cases at least,

218
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,920
Muslims are actually contacting the police

219
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,400
and preventing terror attacks from being carried out,

220
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,040
and those people deserve all the praise in the world for that.

221
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,960
They're saving lives.

222
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,560
But you might say, well, what about the three attacks we're talking about?

223
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,080
They didn't stop those, did they?

224
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,040
Nobody contacted the police to inform on those people,

225
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,280
or those attacks would never have happened.

226
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,720
Well, you see, the thing is, that's not the case.

227
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,440
For instance, let's look at the Manchester attack.

228
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,680
He supports terrorism.

229
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,400
Salman Abidi's Muslim peers warned cops about

230
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,000
Manchester suicide bomber Salman Abidi five years ago.

231
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,040
Police were tipped off by members of the Muslim community

232
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,840
that Salman Abidi was a dangerous extremist.

233
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,040
Two members of the public called a special anti-terrorist hotline

234
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,280
to report the ISIS killer's horrific views.

235
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,200
One community worker said two people who knew Abidi at college

236
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,880
made separate calls to the police begging them to take action.

237
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,000
And furthermore, in the case of the London Bridge attack,

238
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,760
well, watch the following clip.

239
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:58,800
And so that day, I realized that I needed to contact the authorities.

240
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,520
I phoned the anti-terrorist hotline.

241
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,320
I spoke to the gentleman, told him why and how.

242
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,520
I told him about our conversation and how,

243
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,320
and why I think he's been radicalized.

244
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,480
And basically, you know, just doing my bit.

245
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,240
And what claim of that?

246
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,720
Nothing, absolutely nothing.

247
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,560
They didn't get back to me, nor was he arrested or, you know,

248
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,040
just picked up for any kind of questioning.

249
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,000
Were there any other people in the community that tried to object to his views

250
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,840
or to try and put him on another path?

251
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,000
Yes, he was thrown out of a mosque maybe over a year and a half ago.

252
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,640
His local mosque, because of his radical views.

253
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,520
So they were reported to the police.

254
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,040
Like in the cases of the 13 attacks that were prevented,

255
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,120
these attacks, the successful attacks,

256
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,760
are just the ones that slipped through the net.

257
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,200
You know, the police were warned,

258
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,640
but were still ultimately unable to stop them from happening.

259
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,200
And I'm gonna say something not very popular right now,

260
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,840
something you'll never hear a politician say, probably,

261
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,760
because nobody wants to hear it.

262
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,560
But it is true.

263
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,760
You can't stop terrorism,

264
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,400
which is sort of the point of terrorism, really.

265
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,440
It wouldn't be scary if it was easily preventable, would it?

266
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,000
Let me clarify a few things, though.

267
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,720
I'm not saying we shouldn't try to prevent terrorism.

268
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,680
You know, you can obviously prevent individual terror attacks,

269
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,520
and for the ones that were not prevented,

270
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,280
it's always good to examine how and why they were missed by the police.

271
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,760
You know, on that level, on an individual level,

272
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,920
terror attacks can be stopped.

273
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,400
But stopping terrorism entirely?

274
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,920
Well, it's a nice goal in theory, but it's just not possible.

275
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,320
Or, at least if it is possible,

276
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,440
it's not something that can be done quickly and easily.

277
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,280
And in the worst case scenario,

278
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:46,000
the blind pursuit of this goal will lead us down some very dark roads indeed.

279
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,480
And I want to talk about that for a bit right now.

280
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,360
I occasionally ask folks on Twitter what they would do

281
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,000
to stop terror attacks from happening in this country.

282
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,120
And I'd like to run through a bunch of the more common arguments I see

283
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,000
in relation to the three attacks I've been talking about.

284
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,240
The first argument is nearly always,

285
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,800
restrict or outright prohibit immigration into the UK.

286
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,200
But of course, the Westminster Bridge attacker Khalid Masood

287
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,880
he was born in Kent.

288
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,360
The Manchester bomber was born in Manchester.

289
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,200
You know, they're British citizens.

290
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,360
Unless you happen to have a time machine,

291
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,720
no immigration law you can enact would have prevented these attacks.

292
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,760
And even in cases where attackers aren't British citizens

293
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,360
and weren't born in the UK,

294
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,840
I mean, illegal immigration still exists

295
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,480
and I don't imagine a guy who's fixing to blow himself up

296
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,440
and murder a bunch of people is gonna be that put off

297
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,600
by the thought of breaking immigration laws,

298
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,720
to be perfectly honest.

299
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,400
But, whatever.

300
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,280
Another argument is to lay the blame on Islam.

301
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,360
Islam should be banned and mosques closed down, I see people say.

302
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,560
Now, ignoring that that course of action would involve

303
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,080
breaking a whole shitload of laws

304
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,560
and committing a bunch of human rights abuses,

305
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,240
it doesn't make any practical sense

306
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,800
in regards to our terrorists we're talking about here.

307
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,640
One of the London attackers was confronted by other Muslims

308
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,000
and thrown out of his mosque.

309
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,080
You know, he wasn't radicalized there.

310
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,520
In fact, the frightening truth of it is that anyone today

311
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,560
with an internet connection can radicalize themselves.

312
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,320
They don't need to be physically present

313
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,560
in order to listen to a bunch of hate speech.

314
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,880
They can be reading, watching and listening

315
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,000
to all sorts of terrible stuff without ever leaving the house

316
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,560
and if they don't tell anyone they're doing it,

317
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,080
there's no way to know.

318
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,640
This is why talk of changing immigration laws

319
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,720
doesn't really make any sense to me.

320
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,360
The problem isn't the people we have in the country,

321
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,320
it's the ideologies that lead them to commit attacks

322
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,840
and thanks to the internet,

323
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,200
those ideas permeate borders and can infect anyone.

324
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,320
You know, the Westminster attacker was a Muslim convert.

325
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,640
Before he changed his name to Khalid Masood,

326
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,560
he was called Adrian and he converted to Islam in his 40s.

327
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,640
You know, how do you account for something like that?

328
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,760
Adult British citizens who were born here

329
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,720
converting to Islam and carrying out attacks, you know,

330
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,040
changed the immigration laws to say whatever you want,

331
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,040
you're not going to stop attacks like that.

332
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,240
So how do we stop people who are using the internet

333
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,520
to self-radicalize?

334
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,680
Well, obviously the answer is to enact strict internet usage laws

335
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,560
and give the police, intelligence services and government

336
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,040
free reign to spy on whoever they want, right?

337
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,320
Do you see where chasing the impossible goal

338
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,200
of zero terror attacks immediately can lead?

339
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,160
We've already done away with the separation of church and state

340
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,000
and we're banning religions,

341
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,200
we're censoring the internet and spying on innocent people

342
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,800
all in the name of preventing something that we might not even prevent.

343
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,200
You know, the police aren't perfect, clearly, and they can't catch everyone.

344
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,480
And as a side note here, I'm personally not a huge fan of the police,

345
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,280
or at least the police as they exist currently,

346
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,120
but if the police are the ones who are expecting to deal with terrorism,

347
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,320
then why anyone concerned about terrorism would vote for the party

348
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,120
that's consistently cut police funding and numbers

349
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,200
is a bit beyond me, to be honest.

350
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,600
Anyway, so like Tantalus,

351
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,600
the harder we reach for the goal of zero terror attacks immediately,

352
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,000
the further into the distance it'll move,

353
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,720
if you'll forgive me a slightly pretentious reference there.

354
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,480
For instance, let's say we did go all the way down the path of authoritarian censorship.

355
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,440
Let's say we gave the intelligence services full access to everybody's personal data

356
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,200
and blocked all information from the internet that the government deemed dangerous

357
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,200
and, I don't know, made it so anyone could be detained and tortured for information for any reason.

358
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,720
Say, like, China.

359
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,040
You know, that's how they do it over there.

360
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,880
So that must be why there are no terror attacks in China, right?

361
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,920
Except, of course, that's not true.

362
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,080
There are terror attacks in China.

363
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,080
Lots of terror attacks in China.

364
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,280
And if they can't stop it with their draconian censorship laws and human rights abuses and so on,

365
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,480
then I don't see why we'd fare any differently, to be honest.

366
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,360
And then what happens when people start committing terror attacks

367
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,600
to protest the human rights abuses?

368
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,680
It's kind of a vicious cycle there.

369
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,920
There is no easy fix for terrorism and these sorts of knee-jerk responses

370
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,320
where we ban immigration, ban Islam, censor the internet and so on.

371
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,240
Far from fixing the problem, I'd argue they'd only make it worse.

372
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,560
And this is where I'd like to address the folks who wonder why leftists defend Islam.

373
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,600
And the answer is... we don't, really.

374
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,480
Let me explain.

375
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,800
You know, as an internet guy who doesn't go on about how much he hates Muslims all the time,

376
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,320
I get people sending me a lot of awful pictures.

377
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,040
You know, ISIS executing people, homosexuals being thrown off buildings,

378
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,040
female genital mutilations being performed on children and so on.

379
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,960
All terrible stuff.

380
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,520
And the people who send me these images say,

381
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,560
look, this is what Islam is, this is what you're defending,

382
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,680
these are the people you want immigrating into your country.

383
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,520
And now, what these people seem not to realize

384
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,720
is that there's always two people in the pictures they send me.

385
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,600
There's someone doing something horrible, sure,

386
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,520
but there's also someone having something horrible done to them.

387
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,000
And they're people too, you know, they're not just props to prove how evil Islam is.

388
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,480
Often, they're Muslims themselves.

389
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,680
And I'm concerned about stopping those sorts of behaviors, of course,

390
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:16,720
but tell me, how would restricting immigration put an end to those sorts of things?

391
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,080
It wouldn't.

392
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,080
They'd still happen.

393
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,000
You know, all restricting immigration would do

394
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,960
would give the people who might want to run away from those sorts of things

395
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,160
the potential victims of those sorts of things

396
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,880
one fewer safe place they could run away to.

397
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,400
So when I seem like I'm defending Islam, I'm not.

398
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,920
I'm certainly not defending the people who carry out terror attacks.

399
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,240
I want to defend the people who oppose terrorism and who oppose extremism

400
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,000
but might themselves be hurt by knee-jerk responses to terrorism

401
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,600
on behalf of idiotic, short-sighted politicians.

402
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,680
And while I was making this video,

403
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,040
on the 19th of June, a van was driven into a crowd of people outside a mosque

404
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:03,360
in Finsbury Park in London by a 47-year-old man from Cardiff called Darren Osborne

405
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,760
and he was then thankfully restrained by the crowd

406
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,800
before being able to escape or do any further damage.

407
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,320
Just one more horrible incident that happened in London recently.

408
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,120
But what can we learn from this attack?

409
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,040
Well, I'd hope that it proves that any part of society can be targeted by terrorism.

410
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,760
And any type of person can themselves become a terrorist.

411
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,720
It is not a specifically Islamic problem.

412
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,320
And the more focus we put onto extremist Islamic terrorists

413
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,960
the more we will miss people like this guy.

414
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,200
So I'll leave you with a question today.

415
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,400
Why don't we see any Welsh guys condemning this attack?

416
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,720
You know, could it be because all Welsh people

417
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,840
secretly support Darren Osborne and his horrible actions?

418
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,840
I don't know.

419
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,480
I'm just asking questions, of course.

420
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,680
But if they have been condemning it, I certainly haven't seen it.

421
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,680
And I'm not gonna bother to go and look.

422
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,920
But I think that just to be on the safe side in the meantime

423
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,840
we should probably ban Wales.

424
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,480
Thanks for watching, everyone.

425
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,880
It's a bit of a serious video today.

426
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,400
Not too many jokes in this one.

427
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,440
Let me know what you think about that in the comments.

428
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,640
Obligatory Patreon pitch.

429
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,560
Head over to Patreon and pledge me a dollar

430
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:24,240
and in my next video your name will get onto this increasingly unwieldy list of names.

431
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,280
And I'll probably fall in love with you just a little bit as well.

432
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,560
Also follow me on Twitter and send me a question over on Curious Cat if you like.

433
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,760
Alrighty ho.

434
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,960
See you later, folks.
