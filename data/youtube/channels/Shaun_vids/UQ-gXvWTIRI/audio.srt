00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,600
Hello, everyone. This is a video about T-L-semi-colon-D-R, or Teal-dear.

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,200
You see, because it's a teal-dear. Yeah.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,800
And in particular, this video is a response to his video,

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,800
Anita Sarkeesian Doesn't Understand How To Be A Feminist,

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:28,000
concerning Anita Sarkeesian's speech at the How To Be A Feminist panel at All About Women, 2015.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,600
But before we get to that, well, you know the drill by now.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So, the videos I'm asked to respond to broadly fall into two categories.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,600
There's the, for want of a better word, intellectual videos.

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,600
You know, they cite studies and news stories and sources,

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,400
and at least attempt some sort of academic defense of their positions.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And on the other hand, we've got the peanut gallery, the hecklers.

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,200
And what they do is watch someone, usually a feminist,

13
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,800
and usually Anita Sarkeesian, to be honest, say a sentence,

14
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:10,000
and then they cut away to a cartoon animal doing the DreamWorks face, and they say a naughty word.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And I've honestly struggled to come up with a response to this sort of video.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,600
You know, quite a few people have suggested that I look at bearing.

17
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,400
And well, let's briefly look at bearing.

18
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:26,000
And here's one of his responses from his video, the Young Turks have finally lost the plot.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,600
"...and listen to you, or be near you, or whatever. Okay, fine, try to make that case.

20
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,000
It's stupid, but you can make that case. They're claiming that day that they're a man or a woman or whatever."

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,600
You know, your face just pisses me right off, cunt. Fuck you.

22
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,800
You know, how do you respond there? What could I possibly say back to that? Or this?

23
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,800
"...you are- they're trying to pretend that it's only so that guys can go into women's bathroom- bathrooms.

24
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,200
No, that's not the way that being transgender works."

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,400
Suck a bucket of dicks, you fuckhead. I'm not even gonna argue with you.

26
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,600
You know, there's no argument here. It's just mindless preaching to the choir.

27
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,400
It's not substantive enough to get a grasp on.

28
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,400
And well, I'll be honest, I've not watched all of bearing's videos, so maybe I'm being unfair.

29
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,600
If he has ever made anything better than that, someone please let me know.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,400
Absent an argument, I guess one way to respond to these heckling videos

31
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,000
is to turn the particular shtick of whichever heckler it is back on themselves.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,600
But I don't want to do that with bearing, because it'd just be me calling him a dickhead for 20 minutes,

33
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,200
and I don't think anyone really wants to watch that.

34
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,200
And I don't want to make that either. It'd be entirely too negative.

35
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,600
But with Teal Deer, I think I've found my man.

36
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:45,600
You see, Teal Deer has a particular quirk that I have no problem at all with turning back on him.

37
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
You see, he's a pedant.

38
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,600
As a woman on YouTube, I would describe my experience as...

39
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,000
...careful, empowering, brave.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,600
Right, I'm gonna go full Grammar Nazi autist on this because I can.

41
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:05,000
Careful and brave are not experiences. Those are methods of acting.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
They are a way of being. It's not something that you experience.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,400
The actual sentence that you'd want to use would be

44
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,600
my experience on YouTube has involved me needing to be careful.

45
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,000
My experience on YouTube required me to be brave.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,600
It's realising that being a feminist is a lifelong learning endeavour,

47
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,800
and that we will make some mistakes on the way.

48
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,500
And we should be compassionate to ourselves when that happens.

49
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,300
And speaking of mistakes that you make, Anita,

50
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,300
I really think that you should look up the definition of the word

51
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,100
compassion, because it doesn't mean what you think it means.

52
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:45,300
That's right. A pedant. An honest-to-God, old-school, dictionary-quoting pedant.

53
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,100
And that's gonna be our angle right there.

54
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,100
We are gonna be smug and pedantic right back at Teal Deer.

55
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:58,100
And I admit, I'm cheating a bit here by responding to a video about Anita Sarkeesian, who,

56
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,300
for whatever reason, always brings out the worst in these guys.

57
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,300
She's the red rag to the dumb YouTube bull.

58
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,100
Or...

59
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,800
deer, in this case.

60
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,300
BANG!

61
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:10,800
BANG!

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,300
So, let's get to it.

63
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,300
So, throughout high school and college, I was involved with clubs,

64
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,900
organising against wars in the Middle East, raising awareness about climate change,

65
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,100
and demanding gay and lesbian rights.

66
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,700
Ah, yes, because women have truly always been the primary victims of war.

67
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,900
They are also, quite obviously, the group most affected by climate change.

68
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,400
And it's a well-documented fact that homosexual men need feminism.

69
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,300
The only thing that you've mentioned there that even comes close to being an issue for feminism is lesbian rights,

70
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,600
and that is purely because some lesbians may choose to identify themselves as being feminists.

71
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,800
But you do realise that you can be a lesbian and not a feminist, right?

72
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,900
So you really shouldn't presume to speak for all lesbian women everywhere.

73
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,400
You heterosexual, oppressive shitlord.

74
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:04,400
After all, nothing quite says I'm fighting for equality like speaking over all of those marginalised voices.

75
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,200
So we're off to a good start.

76
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,800
Anita says she was involved with a bunch of social justice causes,

77
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:16,100
and then Tealdea cuts in to explain how he thinks those causes aren't feminist causes.

78
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,600
And there's a problem here.

79
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,800
Tealdea cut Anita off in the middle of a sentence.

80
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,600
You see, the start of Anita's speech reads like this.

81
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,400
But that's not the end of the sentence, right there.

82
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,600
She goes on to say,

83
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,100
Now, nowhere here is the implication that Anita does actually think that, say,

84
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,600
climate change, for instance, is a feminist cause.

85
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,900
She's merely listing some social justice causes she was involved with.

86
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:53,200
The implication being that one might expect someone who is heavily involved with a bunch of social justice causes

87
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,600
to be a feminist.

88
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:02,000
However, Anita's point is that, despite being involved with these various causes, she wasn't a feminist.

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,200
Cutting in to explain how those issues don't make you a feminist is jumping the gun,

90
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,200
because that was her point. She wasn't a feminist.

91
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,200
You see, Tealdea is responding to only a sentence fragment here,

92
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,200
so he got the wrong end of the stick and thought that the examples Anita listed

93
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,200
were exclusively examples of what she thinks are feminist causes.

94
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,000
But they weren't. Or, at least, they weren't necessarily.

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I mean, Anita might think that war, for instance, is a feminist issue, and there's plenty of arguments for that.

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
One of the arguments for that is that it's mostly men who are expected to go and fight in wars.

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,400
Which Tealdea actually mentioned incorrectly, thinking that he was contradicting the idea that war is a feminist issue.

98
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,600
But, you know, there are other arguments.

99
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:54,000
The necessary relaxation of some traditional gender roles during wartime is certainly an interesting feminist issue, in my opinion.

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,400
And I say in my opinion because it's just my opinion.

101
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:03,000
Something to keep in mind going forward is that there is no one fixed meaning of feminism.

102
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Whether or not certain issues are feminist issues is arguable.

103
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,800
You know, feminism, at a fundamental level, is an idea.

104
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,600
There is no feminism element on the periodic table.

105
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:22,400
There are no feminism atoms we can look at under a microscope to see if something is actually really feminist or not.

106
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,200
Is this pedantic enough for you all, by the way?

107
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,400
It's basically this for the rest of the video, I'm afraid.

108
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,200
And I'm very sorry.

109
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,000
You know, everything seems trivial after the election.

110
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,000
I need to do a lazy one to get back into it.

111
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,600
I'll get back to responding to something worthwhile soon-ish.

112
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Leave me alone.

113
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
Let's move on.

114
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,000
So, like most people who grew up immersed in the neoliberal ideology of the West-

115
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What?

116
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Neoliberal ideology of the West.

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Let's just break that one down for a moment, shall we?

118
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Neo, meaning new.

119
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,400
Liberal, the idea that the world should be governed on a principle of liberty and equality for all people.

120
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,400
And this is supposed to somehow be a bad thing to think.

121
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,000
Oh wait, what am I saying? Of course it's bad, because it's the patriarchy, right?

122
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But wait, hang on, what is modern feminism?

123
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,800
Well, it's new, so we could certainly describe it as being a Neo ideology.

124
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,400
And it keeps saying that it wants to push for equality for all people.

125
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,000
So yeah, that word actually kind of encompasses modern feminism as well.

126
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I know you're trying to invent a load of bullshit nonsense buzzwords that people can then go home and throw out on their Twitter and Tumblr accounts

127
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,600
to try and make themselves look intellectual while they're talking about some mythical patriarchy.

128
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,600
But I really don't think you've even considered what these words actually mean.

129
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,800
Someone doesn't know what neoliberal means.

130
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,000
Ah ha ha ha.

131
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Heh heh heh heh.

132
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And man, this one takes me back.

133
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So, long time Sean and Jen Watchers will remember my take on Leafy's video about Milo Stewart.

134
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,600
And in the course of making that video, I had to read thousands of Leafy's comments.

135
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,800
And one thing I saw over and over again was people who were confused by Milo's language.

136
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,200
You know, Milo's just making up all of those big words to seem clever.

137
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,000
And this shows how sheltered and kinda arrogant, to be honest, that I was at the time,

138
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,600
because the first few of those comments that I read, I assumed were jokes.

139
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,200
I was like, what big words?

140
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,600
You know, not that Milo isn't well-spoken or anything, but nothing he said was all that complicated.

141
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,800
Or so I thought, anyway.

142
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,400
I now realize that it's all relative, of course.

143
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:50,400
A lot of concepts are just new to a lot of people. There's nothing wrong with that.

144
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,000
It's entirely possible to have just not encountered the word neoliberalism before.

145
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,400
There's no shame at all in being ignorant of that concept.

146
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,600
What there is shame in is assuming that because you haven't heard of it before,

147
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,000
it must therefore be a bullshit buzzword someone else is just making up to look smart.

148
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And then breaking it apart into its component pieces in an attempt to decipher its meaning,

149
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,400
rather than just admitting ignorance and looking it up.

150
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,400
Now, of course, YouTube commenters were quick to point out Tildir's mistake,

151
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,600
which led to him claiming it was just a joke.

152
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,200
Which led to the rather obvious follow-up question.

153
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
What was the joke?

154
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,600
And I guess after getting a bunch of comments explaining his mistake,

155
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,400
Tildir got sick of it and added the following disclaimer to the video description.

156
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:45,200
To all the people telling me I don't know what neoliberalism is, you missed the joke.

157
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,600
So here it is, spelled out for you.

158
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,400
She's ignoring the actual definition of neoliberalism and contorting it into some nebulous term

159
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:58,000
regarding oppression and privilege, and basically ignoring the economic aspect of it.

160
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,800
So I simply redefine it as well, so it can quite easily include herself.

161
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,000
Which, well, that's not actually true, is it, Tildir?

162
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,200
Because you explicitly accused Anita of inventing the term.

163
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,400
Sorry, the bullshit buzzword.

164
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,400
I know you're trying to invent a load of bullshit nonsense buzzwords

165
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,600
that people can then go home and throw out on their Twitter and Tumblr accounts

166
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,200
to try and make themselves look intellectual while they're talking about some mythical patriarchy.

167
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,800
You see, what actually happened here was

168
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,200
Anita Sarkeesian knew something that you didn't know.

169
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,000
In this one instance, Anita Sarkeesian was smarter than you.

170
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,400
But of course, Tildir can't possibly admit that because that would unravel his whole video,

171
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,200
the foundation of which is that Anita Sarkeesian has to be an idiot.

172
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,000
So he has to do the just a joke defense.

173
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,600
You know, I was just kidding, it was just satire.

174
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,400
I was doing the Socratic method.

175
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:05,400
I don't know what I was doing, but whatever it was, it wasn't not knowing something.

176
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,800
Heh heh.

177
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,600
Also, two more points.

178
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Firstly, Anita is not ignoring the economic aspect of neoliberalism

179
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,000
because she goes on in her speech to draw explicit comparisons

180
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,800
between the neoliberal economic ideas of individualism and privatization

181
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,200
and the individualist ideas of choice feminism.

182
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Secondly, Tildir mentions the actual definition of neoliberalism.

183
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,200
So, pray silence, everyone, for Professor Dictionary,

184
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,000
the inventor of all the words.

185
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,400
Come to tell us what they actually mean.

186
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,400
You see, if you do what Tildir should have done and Google neoliberalism,

187
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,200
you can read all about it for free,

188
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,200
and one of the first things that Wikipedia tells us about the term is this.

189
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,600
The definition and usage of the term has changed over time,

190
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:59,000
and it goes on to lay out all the differing and changing meanings of the word neoliberalism.

191
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,800
Speaking of definitions of words...

192
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,600
Back then, I thought sexism basically boiled down to a few bad apples

193
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,000
with misguided personal beliefs born out of ignorance or overt hatred.

194
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,400
Right, stop there. That is exactly what sexism is.

195
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,400
Just like racism. Just like homophobia.

196
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,400
They are not the wider pervasive views of society.

197
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,800
They are the views of a select few vast minority of society.

198
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:30,200
So, that's what sexism, racism, and homophobia mean for anyone who was wondering.

199
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,200
They're not societal or cultural problems, they're merely individual problems,

200
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
and that's all.

201
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,000
And that's quite nice, isn't it, to finally have that issue resolved?

202
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
However, Tildir later quotes the dictionary definition of the word compassion at Anita

203
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,800
in an attempt to catch her out on something, and he uses Google's dictionary feature for this.

204
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,600
So, let's see what Google's dictionary feature thinks of the word sexism.

205
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,400
And here's their example of the word sexism in a sentence.

206
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:08,400
Sexism in language is an offensive reminder of the way the culture sees women.

207
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,200
And while we're at it, let's just see what dictionary.com thinks of the word sexism.

208
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:19,000
Ingrained and institutionalized prejudice against or hatred of women.

209
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
So, the dictionaries at least seem to think sexism is more than just an individual problem.

210
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,400
Hey, you know, the dictionary.

211
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,600
Quote it when it agrees with you, and quietly ignore it when it doesn't.

212
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,400
With the help of some amazing mentors, and by reading a lot of feminist writing,

213
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,400
especially the words of women of color and queer women from around the world.

214
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:46,400
Because the opinions of white women and straight women are apparently lower on the hierarchy of importance than all of those people.

215
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:52,200
Also, you know what, I'm starting to lighten up to this idea of calling folks people of color and queers.

216
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,600
Because now, when I want to go on a good old-fashioned nigger lynch or fag drag,

217
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,000
I can use the correct terminology. Thanks, feminism, you fucking bigots.

218
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So, I don't really know what was going on with that last bit.

219
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,400
I think it was just a joke that didn't quite hit the mark there, to put it rightly.

220
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:20,000
But let's address the part before that, where Anita says she especially read the words of women of color and queer women from around the world.

221
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And Tealdea takes this to mean that Anita is discounting the words of straight white feminists.

222
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,600
However, this is another example of Tealdea cutting Anita off in the middle of a sentence.

223
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,000
You see, the rest of Anita's sentence reads like this.

224
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And it's the intersecting social systems bit that I really want you to pay attention to here.

225
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,600
It's not that Anita's saying the words of straight white feminists don't matter.

226
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,600
It's that they're not enough by themselves.

227
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,400
She's saying you need a bunch of different viewpoints from different people.

228
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:59,400
So the words of women of color and queer women would be especially important for someone trying to understand interacting social systems

229
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:04,400
because they will have particular insights about things like race and sexuality

230
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,400
that you wouldn't necessarily get if you exclusively read the works of straight white people.

231
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:15,400
Unfortunately, many contemporary discourses in and around feminism tend to emphasize a form of hyper-individualism

232
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,400
which is informed by that neoliberal worldview.

233
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:24,200
You are really offended by this idea that people can and do think for themselves, aren't you?

234
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,800
Or is this just some sort of subtle manipulative way of you trying to say

235
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,400
Yeah, it's okay for you to think for yourself as long as what you think agrees with me.

236
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:40,400
Because if you agree with me, that's the only way that you're not going to be a hyper-individual neoliberal shitlord.

237
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,400
And this part represents the main misunderstanding of Tealdea's here.

238
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
Tealdea's here.

239
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,400
Anita is going to go on to denounce so-called choice feminism

240
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,400
and argue that feminists have a responsibility beyond the individual.

241
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:00,400
Now, key to this idea is that individual actions do matter quite a lot.

242
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:07,400
That's the whole point, in fact, that individual actions have ramifications beyond the individual.

243
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Anita's argument here relies upon the existence and importance of individuals.

244
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:19,400
Tealdea completely misses this and thinks Anita is arguing that individuals don't or shouldn't exist

245
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,400
and that feminism should be some sort of borg collective.

246
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
And he does this a lot.

247
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,400
So to save coming back to this point over and over again, let's go non-linear

248
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,400
and quickly bang through some of the other times he gets hung up on this individual point.

249
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,400
Because the individual choices of individual women do not matter.

250
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,400
The only thing that matters is the public image and branding of feminism,

251
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,400
which is more important than the freedom of choice, autonomy and liberty of any woman.

252
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:54,400
Bend your knee and submit, puny mortal women, submit to your goddess queen feminism!

253
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
There you go, straight from the horse's mouth.

254
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,400
You as a woman cannot be entrusted to empower yourself.

255
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,400
Saint Sarkeesian will decide what will empower you for you.

256
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Because you are too weak, pathetic and stupid to be trusted.

257
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,400
And any action that you take that is not directly approved by Saint Sarkeesian

258
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,400
could risk damaging the holy image of feminism.

259
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,400
You actually have no concept of the individual, do you?

260
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,400
All you can see is the collective.

261
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,400
And anything that is not of the collective is against the collective.

262
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,400
You don't even seem to want women within that collective to identify as being individual women.

263
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,400
You just want them to be one large congealed-

264
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,400
Okay, you get the point. He says it a lot.

265
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:46,400
And I think the only other point to be made here is Tilda's completely ridiculous stretching of Anita's words

266
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,400
to their most absurd possible extent.

267
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,400
Anita's language is actually very measured and restrained.

268
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,400
Too restrained, in my opinion.

269
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,400
You know, she'll say something like,

270
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,400
some choices might possibly have negative ramifications,

271
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:07,400
Tilda responds hysterically, casting her as some sort of self-declared feminist dictator.

272
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,400
And I wonder if it's just feminism that sets him off,

273
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,400
or if Tilda takes this approach to every sentence he hears.

274
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,400
You know, for instance, if I say,

275
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
I'm quite tall.

276
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:27,400
Ah, right. So Sean thinks he's the tallest man who has ever lived on the entire planet in human history.

277
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,400
It was quite nice for Tilda to stop by there for that little cameo, wasn't it?

278
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,400
He's got a good sense of humour about himself.

279
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,400
At least.

280
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,400
Anyway, let's go back in time to where we left off.

281
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,400
Okay, so this is the part where I say things that may ruffle some feathers.

282
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,400
Ah, so after demonizing the white man, dehumanizing women,

283
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
people who aren't white and people who aren't straight,

284
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,400
down to the point that they have no autonomy of their own,

285
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
this is the point where things are going to get offensive.

286
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,400
This is the line in the sand past which the offensive stuff begins, apparently.

287
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,400
Now then, what on earth is he talking about here?

288
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
Just to pick one point out of that mess,

289
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,400
dehumanizing people who aren't straight,

290
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,400
down to the point where they have no autonomy of their own.

291
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,400
Where in her speech did Anita do that?

292
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,400
I think what he's talking about here is earlier,

293
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,400
when Anita said she was involved with clubs arguing for gay and lesbian rights,

294
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
and to which Tilda responded,

295
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,400
So you really shouldn't presume to speak for all lesbian women everywhere,

296
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,400
you heterosexual oppressive shitlord.

297
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,400
After all, nothing quite says I'm fighting for equality

298
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,400
like speaking over all of those marginalized voices.

299
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,400
You know, is that it?

300
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,400
The only other time Anita might have mentioned gay people

301
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,400
is when she said that she read the works of queer women.

302
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,400
So it's gotta be the first one, right?

303
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,400
Anita says, I support gay and lesbian rights.

304
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,400
And Tilda responds, ah, so you're dehumanizing gay people

305
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,400
to the point where they have no autonomy.

306
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,400
That's ridiculous.

307
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,400
I thought it was meant to be the social justice crowd

308
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,400
who were overly dramatic and easily outraged.

309
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,400
Anita is not dehumanizing gay people.

310
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,400
She isn't demonizing the white man.

311
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,400
In fact, if you read Anita's whole speech,

312
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,400
she hasn't even directly mentioned men at all up to now.

313
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,400
You know, no offense, Tilda, but, you know, chill out.

314
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
But I think it's a critical discussion to have.

315
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
No, it really isn't.

316
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
But you know what is a critical discussion to have?

317
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,400
The blatant hive mind that is on display in front of us right now.

318
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,400
Notice how every single woman is sitting in exactly the same way,

319
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,400
bar the one notable exception who is anatomically unable to do so,

320
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,400
because her legs are in fact beginning to fuse together in her chrysalis stage,

321
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,400
at which point she will emerge as a full-fledged hot.

322
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,400
Just an observation. Anyway, let's keep going.

323
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:05,400
So, completely unnecessary, unfair and tangential attack on an unrelated person aside,

324
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:11,400
I absolutely love the concept of a hive mind, but with exceptions.

325
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,400
You know, if we look at the source video and the next wide shot of the whole panel,

326
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,400
we see that the two people to Anita's left are sitting differently.

327
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,400
Jermaine Greer has both of her feet on the ground,

328
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,400
and the person on the end has their legs crossed in the other direction.

329
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,400
How did it come to this?

330
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:37,400
So, look at all these women sitting in the exact same way,

331
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,400
except for the ones who aren't.

332
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,400
Four out of seven. What a hive mind that is.

333
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,400
The fact of the matter is that some choices have ramifications beyond ourselves

334
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,400
and reinforce harmful patriarchal ideas about women as a group

335
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,400
and about women's bodies and our wider shared culture.

336
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,400
And because of how systems of oppression intersect and compound one another,

337
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,400
it's women of colour, indigenous women, women living in the global south,

338
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,400
women with disabilities, queer women and trans women who bear the brunt of these ramifications.

339
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,400
So how do you live with yourself?

340
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,400
Because you're a white woman, which means you're obviously oppressing every non-white woman.

341
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,400
You're of Armenian descent, which means that you are not indigenous to America,

342
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:25,400
and are therefore oppressing all of the people who lived in America before European colonisation.

343
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,400
You live in the global north, which means you're automatically oppressing everyone in the global south.

344
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,400
You're able-bodied, so you're instantly oppressing everyone who is disabled.

345
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,400
And as far as I'm aware, you're straight and not transsexual,

346
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,400
so you're oppressing every non-straight transsexual in the world.

347
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,400
Honestly, with the massive amount of oppression that you're exerting on this world,

348
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,400
I'm quite surprised you haven't killed yourself. You know, just from the guilt of it all.

349
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,400
Well, Tealdea, allow me to shed some light on this.

350
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,400
You see, Anita said that some choices have ramifications beyond ourselves

351
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,400
to reinforce harmful patriarchal ideas about women as a group,

352
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:08,400
and that it's the various minorities and disadvantaged groups she mentioned that bear the brunt of those ramifications.

353
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,400
Although, if you notice, Anita used the wrong bear in bear the brunt there. Anyway.

354
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:22,400
What she's saying is that some individual choices lead to the ramifications of which the disadvantaged groups bear the brunt.

355
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,400
And implicit here is the contrary.

356
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,400
Some individual choices do not lead to these harmful ramifications,

357
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,400
and it is these choices that Anita Sarkeesian is advocating for.

358
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:39,400
She's explicitly not saying that oppression of minorities is automatic and inescapable.

359
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:44,400
She's saying that one can choose to be aware of these oppressive systems and help put an end to them.

360
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:52,400
So, Anita Sarkeesian hasn't killed herself because she thinks that the oppressive systems can be stopped,

361
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:59,400
and that she can help to stop them by her choices. You get it? Yeah.

362
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:04,400
Women can choose from a pre-approved palette, but we cannot meaningfully choose liberation.

363
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,400
Okay, you know what? I am getting really sick of all of this feminism social justice bullshit.

364
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,400
So I am making a patriarchal decision and announcement.

365
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,400
As of immediate effect, feminism and social justice warrior are now removed

366
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,400
from the patriarchal palette of pre-approved roles that women can fill in society.

367
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:29,400
So I'll give that a couple of days for the message to get around, and then feminism and social justice will just go away, right?

368
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:36,400
Oh, wait. No, it won't. Because this mythological patriarchy palette doesn't fucking exist!

369
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:43,400
Ah, TLD is doing the misunderstanding the patriarchy thing. Seen that one before.

370
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:50,400
A bunch of these dudes hear patriarchy and see this, like a secret male illuminati who decide everything,

371
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,400
and then they project that misunderstanding back onto where they heard the word patriarchy,

372
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,400
and they don't bother to go and check if it's right.

373
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,400
I think this just comes down to having no faith at all in women's intelligence.

374
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:10,400
You know, any idea they come up with automatically has to be the most stupid possible interpretation of that idea.

375
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:17,400
It's understanding our own intersections of privilege and oppression and how that will fundamentally change our behaviours and attitudes and values.

376
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:23,400
It's realising that being a feminist is a lifelong learning endeavour, and that we will make some mistakes on the way,

377
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,400
and we should be compassionate to ourselves when that happens.

378
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Yeah, mistakes will be made. Like demonising half of the population,

379
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:38,400
and then telling the remaining half of the population that they're too incompetent to be trusted forming their own destiny in life.

380
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,400
But you should only be compassionate to yourself when you make those mistakes.

381
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:50,400
And speaking of mistakes that you make, Anita, I really think that you should look up the definition of the word compassion,

382
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,400
because it doesn't mean what you think it means.

383
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,400
And here we go. It's the reason I decided to respond to this video.

384
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,400
So as I mentioned before, this dictionary is Google's dictionary.

385
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,400
The same dictionary that previously disagreed with TLD is narrow interpretation of the word sexism.

386
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:18,400
So here, TLD is upset because Anita said that we, talking about feminists, will make mistakes and should be compassionate to ourselves when that happens.

387
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:25,400
Because he thinks the word compassion can only be used with regards to things other than the self.

388
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,400
And that is the common understanding of the word.

389
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:34,400
If you just say, you have compassion, the listener will generally assume that you mean for other people.

390
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:42,400
If you want them to understand the idea of having compassion for oneself, you'd need some other words in that sentence.

391
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:48,400
You know, some surrounding context that modifies the meaning of the word compassion.

392
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,400
And Anita does seem to have thought of this.

393
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:58,400
Let's see how she starts off trying to get the idea of having compassion for oneself across to her audience.

394
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,400
Compassion, right. But we all know what this means.

395
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:07,400
Sympathetic pity and concern for the sufferings or misfortunes of others.

396
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:12,400
Uh-oh, Anita. Bad start there. You're gonna have to do better than that.

397
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,400
How are you gonna dig yourself out of this hole?

398
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,400
Hang on, what does to mean?

399
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:26,400
A preposition? Used for expressing aim, purpose, or intention?

400
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,400
Very sneaky, Anita. You see, she's given herself an out.

401
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:39,400
If her next word, whatever it is, differs from the dictionary definition of what it is understood people usually have compassion for,

402
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,400
she will have successfully modified the word.

403
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,400
Anita Sarkeesian is a literary genius.

404
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,400
I can't wait to see what she comes up with next.

405
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,400
And holy shit, the rollercoaster ride is over.

406
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,400
And taking this all together, we understand the idea.

407
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,400
We should be compassionate to ourselves.

408
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,400
Now, when I make these videos, I usually end up saying something like,

409
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,400
if you watch the whole video, the point's clear.

410
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:18,400
But I'm gonna have to say to Tealdea, if you listen to the end of the sentence, the point is clear.

411
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:26,400
Not content with responding to sentence fragments anymore, Tealdea is now responding just to individual words.

412
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,400
Which looks quite fun, to be honest, so I'm gonna take a crack at it.

413
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:42,400
Aye, of course. That is how Saint Sarkeesian would start off a speech, isn't it?

414
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,400
Talking about her self.

415
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,400
Oh, don't mind all those other people there, Anita.

416
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:53,400
You just go ahead and make everyone listen to you talk about your favorite topic.

417
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,400
Your self.

418
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,400
And you know what? I'm sure they will.

419
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,400
Look at this hive mind.

420
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,400
Just over half of whom are sitting in a similar way,

421
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:11,400
listening with rapt attention as their god empress tells them what they're allowed to think today.

422
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:16,400
Oh, what's this, Anita? You had to do something?

423
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,400
You really despise the idea that women can have free agency, don't you?

424
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:26,400
Was it the patriarchy that made you do this unspecified action?

425
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:33,400
I must have missed that meeting. Maybe I was off oppressing everyone by being a straight white male.

426
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:39,400
So, go on, Anita. What was it that the evil patriarchy made you do?

427
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
Learn.

428
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:47,400
Oh, you had to learn. Well, how awful for you. I guess it must be difficult for a feminist.

429
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,400
Learning things must be some alien concept for you.

430
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:57,400
How evil of men to literally force you to learn something.

431
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:02,400
Oh, but don't let me interrupt you, Anita. Go on. What did you simply have to learn about?

432
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,400
How to be a feminist.

433
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,400
Ah, yes. There we go. Straight from the horse's mouth.

434
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,400
Feminism is unnatural.

435
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,400
You know what?

436
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:22,400
Somewhere out there in the multiverse, there's a version of my channel with a lot more subscribers.

437
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,400
I'll say that.

438
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:28,400
Anyway, let's get back to this, because I do have one more point to make about this,

439
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,400
and it concerns the word ourselves.

440
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,400
What does ourselves mean?

441
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,400
It's a plural pronoun.

442
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:44,400
We, or us personally, used to emphasise the speaker and one or more other people considered together.

443
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,400
But that's not what Tealdea said. He said, yourself.

444
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:53,400
But you should only be compassionate to yourself when you make those mistakes.

445
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:58,400
Tealdea really should have said yourselves. Plural.

446
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:04,400
Anita is talking about a group of feminists having compassion for themselves. Plural.

447
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:12,400
Which may include, but does not necessarily require, each individual to have compassion for themselves. Singular.

448
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:21,400
If every feminist feels compassion for all the other feminists, they all feel compassion for themselves. Plural, but not themselves. Singular.

449
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,400
Which perfectly fits the dictionary definition of the word compassion.

450
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,400
Now, that's not really what I think Anita exclusively meant there.

451
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,400
I do think she was also talking about having compassion for oneself.

452
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,400
Or I guess you could say, self-compassion.

453
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,400
Wait, self-compassion? That's a thing?

454
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,400
Well, fuck. You see, that's the problem with the dictionary.

455
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:53,400
You think you have it memorized perfectly, and then people keep going around making up new shit.

456
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,400
It's realizing that others will make mistakes, and we should extend that compassion to them as well.

457
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,400
Unless, of course, that person is a straight white male.

458
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:04,400
At which point you can presumably just condemn him to the pits of hell.

459
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,400
Yes.

460
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:15,400
Not really. Straight white guys are the touchiest, most fragile people on this planet, I swear to God.

461
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,400
Grow a spine.

462
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,400
Outro.

463
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,400
Don't know why I said outro.

464
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:26,400
I apologize about this one. I needed a little post-election catharsis, you know.

465
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,400
I'll do something more substantial next time.

466
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,400
If you'd like to get in touch, send me a-

467
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,400
Cough. Cough. Cough.

468
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,400
I'm still sick, by the way.

469
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,400
Send me a message on Twitter or Ask FM.

470
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,400
If you're feeling very charitable, there's a donation link on the YouTube banner.

471
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,400
But don't donate because of this video.

472
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,400
Go and watch one of my better videos, and then donate because of that.

473
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,400
Right. See ya.
