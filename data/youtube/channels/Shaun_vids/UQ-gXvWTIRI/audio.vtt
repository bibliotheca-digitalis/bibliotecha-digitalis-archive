00:00.000 --> 00:08.600
Hello, everyone. This is a video about T-L-semi-colon-D-R, or Teal-dear.

00:09.200 --> 00:12.200
You see, because it's a teal-dear. Yeah.

00:12.800 --> 00:16.800
And in particular, this video is a response to his video,

00:16.800 --> 00:20.800
Anita Sarkeesian Doesn't Understand How To Be A Feminist,

00:20.800 --> 00:28.000
concerning Anita Sarkeesian's speech at the How To Be A Feminist panel at All About Women, 2015.

00:28.200 --> 00:32.600
But before we get to that, well, you know the drill by now.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
So, the videos I'm asked to respond to broadly fall into two categories.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.600
There's the, for want of a better word, intellectual videos.

00:41.600 --> 00:45.600
You know, they cite studies and news stories and sources,

00:45.600 --> 00:49.400
and at least attempt some sort of academic defense of their positions.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
And on the other hand, we've got the peanut gallery, the hecklers.

00:54.200 --> 00:58.200
And what they do is watch someone, usually a feminist,

00:58.800 --> 01:03.800
and usually Anita Sarkeesian, to be honest, say a sentence,

01:03.800 --> 01:10.000
and then they cut away to a cartoon animal doing the DreamWorks face, and they say a naughty word.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
And I've honestly struggled to come up with a response to this sort of video.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.600
You know, quite a few people have suggested that I look at bearing.

01:17.600 --> 01:20.400
And well, let's briefly look at bearing.

01:20.600 --> 01:26.000
And here's one of his responses from his video, the Young Turks have finally lost the plot.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.600
"...and listen to you, or be near you, or whatever. Okay, fine, try to make that case.

01:30.600 --> 01:35.000
It's stupid, but you can make that case. They're claiming that day that they're a man or a woman or whatever."

01:35.000 --> 01:38.600
You know, your face just pisses me right off, cunt. Fuck you.

01:38.600 --> 01:44.800
You know, how do you respond there? What could I possibly say back to that? Or this?

01:44.800 --> 01:48.800
"...you are- they're trying to pretend that it's only so that guys can go into women's bathroom- bathrooms.

01:48.800 --> 01:51.200
No, that's not the way that being transgender works."

01:51.200 --> 01:55.400
Suck a bucket of dicks, you fuckhead. I'm not even gonna argue with you.

01:55.400 --> 01:59.600
You know, there's no argument here. It's just mindless preaching to the choir.

01:59.600 --> 02:02.400
It's not substantive enough to get a grasp on.

02:02.400 --> 02:07.400
And well, I'll be honest, I've not watched all of bearing's videos, so maybe I'm being unfair.

02:07.400 --> 02:12.600
If he has ever made anything better than that, someone please let me know.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.400
Absent an argument, I guess one way to respond to these heckling videos

02:17.400 --> 02:23.000
is to turn the particular shtick of whichever heckler it is back on themselves.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.600
But I don't want to do that with bearing, because it'd just be me calling him a dickhead for 20 minutes,

02:28.600 --> 02:31.200
and I don't think anyone really wants to watch that.

02:31.200 --> 02:35.200
And I don't want to make that either. It'd be entirely too negative.

02:35.200 --> 02:38.600
But with Teal Deer, I think I've found my man.

02:38.600 --> 02:45.600
You see, Teal Deer has a particular quirk that I have no problem at all with turning back on him.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.600
You see, he's a pedant.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.600
As a woman on YouTube, I would describe my experience as...

02:52.200 --> 02:55.000
...careful, empowering, brave.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.600
Right, I'm gonna go full Grammar Nazi autist on this because I can.

02:59.600 --> 03:05.000
Careful and brave are not experiences. Those are methods of acting.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
They are a way of being. It's not something that you experience.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.400
The actual sentence that you'd want to use would be

03:11.400 --> 03:15.600
my experience on YouTube has involved me needing to be careful.

03:15.600 --> 03:19.000
My experience on YouTube required me to be brave.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.600
It's realising that being a feminist is a lifelong learning endeavour,

03:22.600 --> 03:24.800
and that we will make some mistakes on the way.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.500
And we should be compassionate to ourselves when that happens.

03:27.500 --> 03:30.300
And speaking of mistakes that you make, Anita,

03:30.300 --> 03:33.300
I really think that you should look up the definition of the word

03:33.300 --> 03:38.100
compassion, because it doesn't mean what you think it means.

03:38.100 --> 03:45.300
That's right. A pedant. An honest-to-God, old-school, dictionary-quoting pedant.

03:45.300 --> 03:48.100
And that's gonna be our angle right there.

03:48.100 --> 03:52.100
We are gonna be smug and pedantic right back at Teal Deer.

03:52.100 --> 03:58.100
And I admit, I'm cheating a bit here by responding to a video about Anita Sarkeesian, who,

03:58.100 --> 04:02.300
for whatever reason, always brings out the worst in these guys.

04:02.300 --> 04:06.300
She's the red rag to the dumb YouTube bull.

04:07.100 --> 04:08.100
Or...

04:08.100 --> 04:09.800
deer, in this case.

04:09.800 --> 04:10.300
BANG!

04:10.300 --> 04:10.800
BANG!

04:12.000 --> 04:13.300
So, let's get to it.

04:13.300 --> 04:16.300
So, throughout high school and college, I was involved with clubs,

04:16.300 --> 04:19.900
organising against wars in the Middle East, raising awareness about climate change,

04:19.900 --> 04:22.100
and demanding gay and lesbian rights.

04:22.100 --> 04:26.700
Ah, yes, because women have truly always been the primary victims of war.

04:26.700 --> 04:30.900
They are also, quite obviously, the group most affected by climate change.

04:30.900 --> 04:35.400
And it's a well-documented fact that homosexual men need feminism.

04:35.400 --> 04:41.300
The only thing that you've mentioned there that even comes close to being an issue for feminism is lesbian rights,

04:41.300 --> 04:46.600
and that is purely because some lesbians may choose to identify themselves as being feminists.

04:46.600 --> 04:50.800
But you do realise that you can be a lesbian and not a feminist, right?

04:50.800 --> 04:54.900
So you really shouldn't presume to speak for all lesbian women everywhere.

04:54.900 --> 04:57.400
You heterosexual, oppressive shitlord.

04:57.400 --> 05:04.400
After all, nothing quite says I'm fighting for equality like speaking over all of those marginalised voices.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.200
So we're off to a good start.

05:06.200 --> 05:09.800
Anita says she was involved with a bunch of social justice causes,

05:09.800 --> 05:16.100
and then Tealdea cuts in to explain how he thinks those causes aren't feminist causes.

05:16.100 --> 05:17.600
And there's a problem here.

05:17.600 --> 05:20.800
Tealdea cut Anita off in the middle of a sentence.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.600
You see, the start of Anita's speech reads like this.

05:23.600 --> 05:26.400
But that's not the end of the sentence, right there.

05:26.400 --> 05:27.600
She goes on to say,

05:33.600 --> 05:39.100
Now, nowhere here is the implication that Anita does actually think that, say,

05:39.100 --> 05:42.600
climate change, for instance, is a feminist cause.

05:42.600 --> 05:46.900
She's merely listing some social justice causes she was involved with.

05:46.900 --> 05:53.200
The implication being that one might expect someone who is heavily involved with a bunch of social justice causes

05:53.200 --> 05:54.600
to be a feminist.

05:54.600 --> 06:02.000
However, Anita's point is that, despite being involved with these various causes, she wasn't a feminist.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.200
Cutting in to explain how those issues don't make you a feminist is jumping the gun,

06:06.200 --> 06:09.200
because that was her point. She wasn't a feminist.

06:09.200 --> 06:13.200
You see, Tealdea is responding to only a sentence fragment here,

06:13.200 --> 06:17.200
so he got the wrong end of the stick and thought that the examples Anita listed

06:17.200 --> 06:21.200
were exclusively examples of what she thinks are feminist causes.

06:21.200 --> 06:25.000
But they weren't. Or, at least, they weren't necessarily.

06:25.000 --> 06:31.000
I mean, Anita might think that war, for instance, is a feminist issue, and there's plenty of arguments for that.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
One of the arguments for that is that it's mostly men who are expected to go and fight in wars.

06:36.000 --> 06:43.400
Which Tealdea actually mentioned incorrectly, thinking that he was contradicting the idea that war is a feminist issue.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.600
But, you know, there are other arguments.

06:45.800 --> 06:54.000
The necessary relaxation of some traditional gender roles during wartime is certainly an interesting feminist issue, in my opinion.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.400
And I say in my opinion because it's just my opinion.

06:57.400 --> 07:03.000
Something to keep in mind going forward is that there is no one fixed meaning of feminism.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
Whether or not certain issues are feminist issues is arguable.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.800
You know, feminism, at a fundamental level, is an idea.

07:10.800 --> 07:14.600
There is no feminism element on the periodic table.

07:14.600 --> 07:22.400
There are no feminism atoms we can look at under a microscope to see if something is actually really feminist or not.

07:22.800 --> 07:25.200
Is this pedantic enough for you all, by the way?

07:25.200 --> 07:28.400
It's basically this for the rest of the video, I'm afraid.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.200
And I'm very sorry.

07:30.600 --> 07:34.000
You know, everything seems trivial after the election.

07:34.600 --> 07:37.000
I need to do a lazy one to get back into it.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.600
I'll get back to responding to something worthwhile soon-ish.

07:42.400 --> 07:43.400
Leave me alone.

07:44.200 --> 07:45.200
Let's move on.

07:46.600 --> 07:51.000
So, like most people who grew up immersed in the neoliberal ideology of the West-

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
What?

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
Neoliberal ideology of the West.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
Let's just break that one down for a moment, shall we?

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
Neo, meaning new.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.400
Liberal, the idea that the world should be governed on a principle of liberty and equality for all people.

08:08.400 --> 08:12.400
And this is supposed to somehow be a bad thing to think.

08:12.400 --> 08:16.000
Oh wait, what am I saying? Of course it's bad, because it's the patriarchy, right?

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
But wait, hang on, what is modern feminism?

08:19.000 --> 08:24.800
Well, it's new, so we could certainly describe it as being a Neo ideology.

08:24.800 --> 08:29.400
And it keeps saying that it wants to push for equality for all people.

08:29.400 --> 08:34.000
So yeah, that word actually kind of encompasses modern feminism as well.

08:34.000 --> 08:42.000
I know you're trying to invent a load of bullshit nonsense buzzwords that people can then go home and throw out on their Twitter and Tumblr accounts

08:42.000 --> 08:47.600
to try and make themselves look intellectual while they're talking about some mythical patriarchy.

08:47.600 --> 08:51.600
But I really don't think you've even considered what these words actually mean.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.800
Someone doesn't know what neoliberal means.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.000
Ah ha ha ha.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Heh heh heh heh.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
And man, this one takes me back.

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
So, long time Sean and Jen Watchers will remember my take on Leafy's video about Milo Stewart.

09:07.200 --> 09:12.600
And in the course of making that video, I had to read thousands of Leafy's comments.

09:12.600 --> 09:17.800
And one thing I saw over and over again was people who were confused by Milo's language.

09:17.800 --> 09:22.200
You know, Milo's just making up all of those big words to seem clever.

09:22.200 --> 09:28.000
And this shows how sheltered and kinda arrogant, to be honest, that I was at the time,

09:28.000 --> 09:32.600
because the first few of those comments that I read, I assumed were jokes.

09:32.600 --> 09:35.200
I was like, what big words?

09:35.200 --> 09:40.600
You know, not that Milo isn't well-spoken or anything, but nothing he said was all that complicated.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.800
Or so I thought, anyway.

09:42.800 --> 09:45.400
I now realize that it's all relative, of course.

09:45.400 --> 09:50.400
A lot of concepts are just new to a lot of people. There's nothing wrong with that.

09:50.400 --> 09:55.000
It's entirely possible to have just not encountered the word neoliberalism before.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.400
There's no shame at all in being ignorant of that concept.

09:59.400 --> 10:03.600
What there is shame in is assuming that because you haven't heard of it before,

10:03.600 --> 10:10.000
it must therefore be a bullshit buzzword someone else is just making up to look smart.

10:10.000 --> 10:16.000
And then breaking it apart into its component pieces in an attempt to decipher its meaning,

10:16.000 --> 10:19.400
rather than just admitting ignorance and looking it up.

10:19.400 --> 10:23.400
Now, of course, YouTube commenters were quick to point out Tildir's mistake,

10:23.400 --> 10:26.600
which led to him claiming it was just a joke.

10:26.600 --> 10:30.200
Which led to the rather obvious follow-up question.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.200
What was the joke?

10:32.200 --> 10:35.600
And I guess after getting a bunch of comments explaining his mistake,

10:35.600 --> 10:40.400
Tildir got sick of it and added the following disclaimer to the video description.

10:40.400 --> 10:45.200
To all the people telling me I don't know what neoliberalism is, you missed the joke.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.600
So here it is, spelled out for you.

10:47.600 --> 10:53.400
She's ignoring the actual definition of neoliberalism and contorting it into some nebulous term

10:53.400 --> 10:58.000
regarding oppression and privilege, and basically ignoring the economic aspect of it.

10:58.000 --> 11:03.800
So I simply redefine it as well, so it can quite easily include herself.

11:03.800 --> 11:08.000
Which, well, that's not actually true, is it, Tildir?

11:08.000 --> 11:12.200
Because you explicitly accused Anita of inventing the term.

11:12.200 --> 11:15.400
Sorry, the bullshit buzzword.

11:15.400 --> 11:19.400
I know you're trying to invent a load of bullshit nonsense buzzwords

11:19.400 --> 11:23.600
that people can then go home and throw out on their Twitter and Tumblr accounts

11:23.600 --> 11:29.200
to try and make themselves look intellectual while they're talking about some mythical patriarchy.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.800
You see, what actually happened here was

11:31.800 --> 11:36.200
Anita Sarkeesian knew something that you didn't know.

11:36.200 --> 11:41.000
In this one instance, Anita Sarkeesian was smarter than you.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.400
But of course, Tildir can't possibly admit that because that would unravel his whole video,

11:46.400 --> 11:51.200
the foundation of which is that Anita Sarkeesian has to be an idiot.

11:51.200 --> 11:54.000
So he has to do the just a joke defense.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.600
You know, I was just kidding, it was just satire.

11:56.600 --> 11:59.400
I was doing the Socratic method.

11:59.400 --> 12:05.400
I don't know what I was doing, but whatever it was, it wasn't not knowing something.

12:05.400 --> 12:06.800
Heh heh.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.600
Also, two more points.

12:08.600 --> 12:12.600
Firstly, Anita is not ignoring the economic aspect of neoliberalism

12:12.600 --> 12:16.000
because she goes on in her speech to draw explicit comparisons

12:16.000 --> 12:19.800
between the neoliberal economic ideas of individualism and privatization

12:19.800 --> 12:23.200
and the individualist ideas of choice feminism.

12:24.200 --> 12:29.200
Secondly, Tildir mentions the actual definition of neoliberalism.

12:29.200 --> 12:33.200
So, pray silence, everyone, for Professor Dictionary,

12:33.200 --> 12:36.000
the inventor of all the words.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.400
Come to tell us what they actually mean.

12:39.400 --> 12:43.400
You see, if you do what Tildir should have done and Google neoliberalism,

12:43.400 --> 12:45.200
you can read all about it for free,

12:45.200 --> 12:49.200
and one of the first things that Wikipedia tells us about the term is this.

12:49.200 --> 12:52.600
The definition and usage of the term has changed over time,

12:52.600 --> 12:59.000
and it goes on to lay out all the differing and changing meanings of the word neoliberalism.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.800
Speaking of definitions of words...

13:01.800 --> 13:05.600
Back then, I thought sexism basically boiled down to a few bad apples

13:05.600 --> 13:10.000
with misguided personal beliefs born out of ignorance or overt hatred.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.400
Right, stop there. That is exactly what sexism is.

13:13.400 --> 13:16.400
Just like racism. Just like homophobia.

13:16.400 --> 13:19.400
They are not the wider pervasive views of society.

13:19.400 --> 13:23.800
They are the views of a select few vast minority of society.

13:23.800 --> 13:30.200
So, that's what sexism, racism, and homophobia mean for anyone who was wondering.

13:30.200 --> 13:35.200
They're not societal or cultural problems, they're merely individual problems,

13:35.200 --> 13:36.200
and that's all.

13:36.200 --> 13:40.000
And that's quite nice, isn't it, to finally have that issue resolved?

13:40.000 --> 13:46.000
However, Tildir later quotes the dictionary definition of the word compassion at Anita

13:46.000 --> 13:51.800
in an attempt to catch her out on something, and he uses Google's dictionary feature for this.

13:51.800 --> 13:56.600
So, let's see what Google's dictionary feature thinks of the word sexism.

13:56.600 --> 14:01.400
And here's their example of the word sexism in a sentence.

14:01.400 --> 14:08.400
Sexism in language is an offensive reminder of the way the culture sees women.

14:08.400 --> 14:13.200
And while we're at it, let's just see what dictionary.com thinks of the word sexism.

14:13.200 --> 14:19.000
Ingrained and institutionalized prejudice against or hatred of women.

14:19.000 --> 14:25.000
So, the dictionaries at least seem to think sexism is more than just an individual problem.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.400
Hey, you know, the dictionary.

14:27.400 --> 14:32.600
Quote it when it agrees with you, and quietly ignore it when it doesn't.

14:32.600 --> 14:36.400
With the help of some amazing mentors, and by reading a lot of feminist writing,

14:36.400 --> 14:40.400
especially the words of women of color and queer women from around the world.

14:40.400 --> 14:46.400
Because the opinions of white women and straight women are apparently lower on the hierarchy of importance than all of those people.

14:46.400 --> 14:52.200
Also, you know what, I'm starting to lighten up to this idea of calling folks people of color and queers.

14:52.200 --> 14:56.600
Because now, when I want to go on a good old-fashioned nigger lynch or fag drag,

14:56.600 --> 15:02.000
I can use the correct terminology. Thanks, feminism, you fucking bigots.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
So, I don't really know what was going on with that last bit.

15:05.000 --> 15:11.400
I think it was just a joke that didn't quite hit the mark there, to put it rightly.

15:11.400 --> 15:20.000
But let's address the part before that, where Anita says she especially read the words of women of color and queer women from around the world.

15:20.000 --> 15:26.000
And Tealdea takes this to mean that Anita is discounting the words of straight white feminists.

15:26.000 --> 15:31.600
However, this is another example of Tealdea cutting Anita off in the middle of a sentence.

15:31.600 --> 15:35.000
You see, the rest of Anita's sentence reads like this.

15:35.000 --> 15:41.000
And it's the intersecting social systems bit that I really want you to pay attention to here.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.600
It's not that Anita's saying the words of straight white feminists don't matter.

15:45.600 --> 15:48.600
It's that they're not enough by themselves.

15:48.600 --> 15:52.400
She's saying you need a bunch of different viewpoints from different people.

15:52.400 --> 15:59.400
So the words of women of color and queer women would be especially important for someone trying to understand interacting social systems

15:59.400 --> 16:04.400
because they will have particular insights about things like race and sexuality

16:04.400 --> 16:09.400
that you wouldn't necessarily get if you exclusively read the works of straight white people.

16:09.400 --> 16:15.400
Unfortunately, many contemporary discourses in and around feminism tend to emphasize a form of hyper-individualism

16:15.400 --> 16:18.400
which is informed by that neoliberal worldview.

16:18.400 --> 16:24.200
You are really offended by this idea that people can and do think for themselves, aren't you?

16:24.200 --> 16:27.800
Or is this just some sort of subtle manipulative way of you trying to say

16:27.800 --> 16:32.400
Yeah, it's okay for you to think for yourself as long as what you think agrees with me.

16:32.400 --> 16:40.400
Because if you agree with me, that's the only way that you're not going to be a hyper-individual neoliberal shitlord.

16:40.400 --> 16:44.400
And this part represents the main misunderstanding of Tealdea's here.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.400
Tealdea's here.

16:46.400 --> 16:50.400
Anita is going to go on to denounce so-called choice feminism

16:50.400 --> 16:55.400
and argue that feminists have a responsibility beyond the individual.

16:55.400 --> 17:00.400
Now, key to this idea is that individual actions do matter quite a lot.

17:00.400 --> 17:07.400
That's the whole point, in fact, that individual actions have ramifications beyond the individual.

17:07.400 --> 17:12.400
Anita's argument here relies upon the existence and importance of individuals.

17:12.400 --> 17:19.400
Tealdea completely misses this and thinks Anita is arguing that individuals don't or shouldn't exist

17:19.400 --> 17:23.400
and that feminism should be some sort of borg collective.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.400
And he does this a lot.

17:25.400 --> 17:29.400
So to save coming back to this point over and over again, let's go non-linear

17:29.400 --> 17:35.400
and quickly bang through some of the other times he gets hung up on this individual point.

17:35.400 --> 17:39.400
Because the individual choices of individual women do not matter.

17:39.400 --> 17:43.400
The only thing that matters is the public image and branding of feminism,

17:43.400 --> 17:47.400
which is more important than the freedom of choice, autonomy and liberty of any woman.

17:47.400 --> 17:54.400
Bend your knee and submit, puny mortal women, submit to your goddess queen feminism!

17:54.400 --> 17:56.400
There you go, straight from the horse's mouth.

17:56.400 --> 18:00.400
You as a woman cannot be entrusted to empower yourself.

18:00.400 --> 18:04.400
Saint Sarkeesian will decide what will empower you for you.

18:04.400 --> 18:08.400
Because you are too weak, pathetic and stupid to be trusted.

18:08.400 --> 18:13.400
And any action that you take that is not directly approved by Saint Sarkeesian

18:13.400 --> 18:17.400
could risk damaging the holy image of feminism.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.400
You actually have no concept of the individual, do you?

18:20.400 --> 18:23.400
All you can see is the collective.

18:23.400 --> 18:28.400
And anything that is not of the collective is against the collective.

18:28.400 --> 18:33.400
You don't even seem to want women within that collective to identify as being individual women.

18:33.400 --> 18:36.400
You just want them to be one large congealed-

18:36.400 --> 18:39.400
Okay, you get the point. He says it a lot.

18:39.400 --> 18:46.400
And I think the only other point to be made here is Tilda's completely ridiculous stretching of Anita's words

18:46.400 --> 18:49.400
to their most absurd possible extent.

18:49.400 --> 18:53.400
Anita's language is actually very measured and restrained.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.400
Too restrained, in my opinion.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.400
You know, she'll say something like,

18:57.400 --> 19:01.400
some choices might possibly have negative ramifications,

19:01.400 --> 19:07.400
Tilda responds hysterically, casting her as some sort of self-declared feminist dictator.

19:07.400 --> 19:10.400
And I wonder if it's just feminism that sets him off,

19:10.400 --> 19:14.400
or if Tilda takes this approach to every sentence he hears.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.400
You know, for instance, if I say,

19:16.400 --> 19:18.400
I'm quite tall.

19:18.400 --> 19:27.400
Ah, right. So Sean thinks he's the tallest man who has ever lived on the entire planet in human history.

19:28.400 --> 19:34.400
It was quite nice for Tilda to stop by there for that little cameo, wasn't it?

19:34.400 --> 19:37.400
He's got a good sense of humour about himself.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.400
At least.

19:38.400 --> 19:42.400
Anyway, let's go back in time to where we left off.

19:42.400 --> 19:47.400
Okay, so this is the part where I say things that may ruffle some feathers.

19:47.400 --> 19:51.400
Ah, so after demonizing the white man, dehumanizing women,

19:51.400 --> 19:53.400
people who aren't white and people who aren't straight,

19:53.400 --> 19:56.400
down to the point that they have no autonomy of their own,

19:56.400 --> 19:58.400
this is the point where things are going to get offensive.

19:58.400 --> 20:04.400
This is the line in the sand past which the offensive stuff begins, apparently.

20:04.400 --> 20:08.400
Now then, what on earth is he talking about here?

20:08.400 --> 20:10.400
Just to pick one point out of that mess,

20:10.400 --> 20:13.400
dehumanizing people who aren't straight,

20:13.400 --> 20:16.400
down to the point where they have no autonomy of their own.

20:16.400 --> 20:19.400
Where in her speech did Anita do that?

20:19.400 --> 20:22.400
I think what he's talking about here is earlier,

20:22.400 --> 20:26.400
when Anita said she was involved with clubs arguing for gay and lesbian rights,

20:26.400 --> 20:28.400
and to which Tilda responded,

20:28.400 --> 20:32.400
So you really shouldn't presume to speak for all lesbian women everywhere,

20:32.400 --> 20:35.400
you heterosexual oppressive shitlord.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.400
After all, nothing quite says I'm fighting for equality

20:38.400 --> 20:41.400
like speaking over all of those marginalized voices.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.400
You know, is that it?

20:43.400 --> 20:46.400
The only other time Anita might have mentioned gay people

20:46.400 --> 20:49.400
is when she said that she read the works of queer women.

20:49.400 --> 20:52.400
So it's gotta be the first one, right?

20:52.400 --> 20:56.400
Anita says, I support gay and lesbian rights.

20:56.400 --> 21:00.400
And Tilda responds, ah, so you're dehumanizing gay people

21:00.400 --> 21:03.400
to the point where they have no autonomy.

21:03.400 --> 21:06.400
That's ridiculous.

21:06.400 --> 21:09.400
I thought it was meant to be the social justice crowd

21:09.400 --> 21:12.400
who were overly dramatic and easily outraged.

21:12.400 --> 21:15.400
Anita is not dehumanizing gay people.

21:15.400 --> 21:18.400
She isn't demonizing the white man.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.400
In fact, if you read Anita's whole speech,

21:20.400 --> 21:24.400
she hasn't even directly mentioned men at all up to now.

21:24.400 --> 21:30.400
You know, no offense, Tilda, but, you know, chill out.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.400
But I think it's a critical discussion to have.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.400
No, it really isn't.

21:34.400 --> 21:36.400
But you know what is a critical discussion to have?

21:36.400 --> 21:40.400
The blatant hive mind that is on display in front of us right now.

21:40.400 --> 21:44.400
Notice how every single woman is sitting in exactly the same way,

21:44.400 --> 21:49.400
bar the one notable exception who is anatomically unable to do so,

21:49.400 --> 21:53.400
because her legs are in fact beginning to fuse together in her chrysalis stage,

21:53.400 --> 21:56.400
at which point she will emerge as a full-fledged hot.

21:56.400 --> 21:59.400
Just an observation. Anyway, let's keep going.

21:59.400 --> 22:05.400
So, completely unnecessary, unfair and tangential attack on an unrelated person aside,

22:05.400 --> 22:11.400
I absolutely love the concept of a hive mind, but with exceptions.

22:11.400 --> 22:15.400
You know, if we look at the source video and the next wide shot of the whole panel,

22:15.400 --> 22:19.400
we see that the two people to Anita's left are sitting differently.

22:19.400 --> 22:23.400
Jermaine Greer has both of her feet on the ground,

22:23.400 --> 22:28.400
and the person on the end has their legs crossed in the other direction.

22:29.400 --> 22:31.400
How did it come to this?

22:31.400 --> 22:37.400
So, look at all these women sitting in the exact same way,

22:37.400 --> 22:39.400
except for the ones who aren't.

22:39.400 --> 22:43.400
Four out of seven. What a hive mind that is.

22:44.400 --> 22:48.400
The fact of the matter is that some choices have ramifications beyond ourselves

22:48.400 --> 22:52.400
and reinforce harmful patriarchal ideas about women as a group

22:52.400 --> 22:55.400
and about women's bodies and our wider shared culture.

22:55.400 --> 22:59.400
And because of how systems of oppression intersect and compound one another,

22:59.400 --> 23:03.400
it's women of colour, indigenous women, women living in the global south,

23:03.400 --> 23:08.400
women with disabilities, queer women and trans women who bear the brunt of these ramifications.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.400
So how do you live with yourself?

23:10.400 --> 23:14.400
Because you're a white woman, which means you're obviously oppressing every non-white woman.

23:14.400 --> 23:19.400
You're of Armenian descent, which means that you are not indigenous to America,

23:19.400 --> 23:25.400
and are therefore oppressing all of the people who lived in America before European colonisation.

23:25.400 --> 23:30.400
You live in the global north, which means you're automatically oppressing everyone in the global south.

23:30.400 --> 23:34.400
You're able-bodied, so you're instantly oppressing everyone who is disabled.

23:34.400 --> 23:37.400
And as far as I'm aware, you're straight and not transsexual,

23:37.400 --> 23:41.400
so you're oppressing every non-straight transsexual in the world.

23:41.400 --> 23:44.400
Honestly, with the massive amount of oppression that you're exerting on this world,

23:44.400 --> 23:48.400
I'm quite surprised you haven't killed yourself. You know, just from the guilt of it all.

23:48.400 --> 23:52.400
Well, Tealdea, allow me to shed some light on this.

23:52.400 --> 23:57.400
You see, Anita said that some choices have ramifications beyond ourselves

23:57.400 --> 24:00.400
to reinforce harmful patriarchal ideas about women as a group,

24:00.400 --> 24:08.400
and that it's the various minorities and disadvantaged groups she mentioned that bear the brunt of those ramifications.

24:08.400 --> 24:14.400
Although, if you notice, Anita used the wrong bear in bear the brunt there. Anyway.

24:14.400 --> 24:22.400
What she's saying is that some individual choices lead to the ramifications of which the disadvantaged groups bear the brunt.

24:22.400 --> 24:25.400
And implicit here is the contrary.

24:25.400 --> 24:29.400
Some individual choices do not lead to these harmful ramifications,

24:29.400 --> 24:33.400
and it is these choices that Anita Sarkeesian is advocating for.

24:33.400 --> 24:39.400
She's explicitly not saying that oppression of minorities is automatic and inescapable.

24:39.400 --> 24:44.400
She's saying that one can choose to be aware of these oppressive systems and help put an end to them.

24:44.400 --> 24:52.400
So, Anita Sarkeesian hasn't killed herself because she thinks that the oppressive systems can be stopped,

24:52.400 --> 24:59.400
and that she can help to stop them by her choices. You get it? Yeah.

24:59.400 --> 25:04.400
Women can choose from a pre-approved palette, but we cannot meaningfully choose liberation.

25:04.400 --> 25:09.400
Okay, you know what? I am getting really sick of all of this feminism social justice bullshit.

25:09.400 --> 25:12.400
So I am making a patriarchal decision and announcement.

25:12.400 --> 25:17.400
As of immediate effect, feminism and social justice warrior are now removed

25:17.400 --> 25:22.400
from the patriarchal palette of pre-approved roles that women can fill in society.

25:22.400 --> 25:29.400
So I'll give that a couple of days for the message to get around, and then feminism and social justice will just go away, right?

25:29.400 --> 25:36.400
Oh, wait. No, it won't. Because this mythological patriarchy palette doesn't fucking exist!

25:36.400 --> 25:43.400
Ah, TLD is doing the misunderstanding the patriarchy thing. Seen that one before.

25:43.400 --> 25:50.400
A bunch of these dudes hear patriarchy and see this, like a secret male illuminati who decide everything,

25:50.400 --> 25:55.400
and then they project that misunderstanding back onto where they heard the word patriarchy,

25:55.400 --> 25:58.400
and they don't bother to go and check if it's right.

25:58.400 --> 26:03.400
I think this just comes down to having no faith at all in women's intelligence.

26:03.400 --> 26:10.400
You know, any idea they come up with automatically has to be the most stupid possible interpretation of that idea.

26:10.400 --> 26:17.400
It's understanding our own intersections of privilege and oppression and how that will fundamentally change our behaviours and attitudes and values.

26:17.400 --> 26:23.400
It's realising that being a feminist is a lifelong learning endeavour, and that we will make some mistakes on the way,

26:23.400 --> 26:26.400
and we should be compassionate to ourselves when that happens.

26:26.400 --> 26:31.400
Yeah, mistakes will be made. Like demonising half of the population,

26:31.400 --> 26:38.400
and then telling the remaining half of the population that they're too incompetent to be trusted forming their own destiny in life.

26:38.400 --> 26:43.400
But you should only be compassionate to yourself when you make those mistakes.

26:43.400 --> 26:50.400
And speaking of mistakes that you make, Anita, I really think that you should look up the definition of the word compassion,

26:50.400 --> 26:53.400
because it doesn't mean what you think it means.

26:53.400 --> 26:58.400
And here we go. It's the reason I decided to respond to this video.

26:58.400 --> 27:02.400
So as I mentioned before, this dictionary is Google's dictionary.

27:02.400 --> 27:07.400
The same dictionary that previously disagreed with TLD is narrow interpretation of the word sexism.

27:07.400 --> 27:18.400
So here, TLD is upset because Anita said that we, talking about feminists, will make mistakes and should be compassionate to ourselves when that happens.

27:18.400 --> 27:25.400
Because he thinks the word compassion can only be used with regards to things other than the self.

27:25.400 --> 27:28.400
And that is the common understanding of the word.

27:28.400 --> 27:34.400
If you just say, you have compassion, the listener will generally assume that you mean for other people.

27:34.400 --> 27:42.400
If you want them to understand the idea of having compassion for oneself, you'd need some other words in that sentence.

27:42.400 --> 27:48.400
You know, some surrounding context that modifies the meaning of the word compassion.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.400
And Anita does seem to have thought of this.

27:51.400 --> 27:58.400
Let's see how she starts off trying to get the idea of having compassion for oneself across to her audience.

27:59.400 --> 28:02.400
Compassion, right. But we all know what this means.

28:02.400 --> 28:07.400
Sympathetic pity and concern for the sufferings or misfortunes of others.

28:07.400 --> 28:12.400
Uh-oh, Anita. Bad start there. You're gonna have to do better than that.

28:12.400 --> 28:15.400
How are you gonna dig yourself out of this hole?

28:17.400 --> 28:21.400
Hang on, what does to mean?

28:21.400 --> 28:26.400
A preposition? Used for expressing aim, purpose, or intention?

28:27.400 --> 28:31.400
Very sneaky, Anita. You see, she's given herself an out.

28:31.400 --> 28:39.400
If her next word, whatever it is, differs from the dictionary definition of what it is understood people usually have compassion for,

28:39.400 --> 28:43.400
she will have successfully modified the word.

28:43.400 --> 28:47.400
Anita Sarkeesian is a literary genius.

28:47.400 --> 28:51.400
I can't wait to see what she comes up with next.

28:51.400 --> 28:55.400
And holy shit, the rollercoaster ride is over.

28:55.400 --> 28:59.400
And taking this all together, we understand the idea.

28:59.400 --> 29:04.400
We should be compassionate to ourselves.

29:04.400 --> 29:08.400
Now, when I make these videos, I usually end up saying something like,

29:08.400 --> 29:11.400
if you watch the whole video, the point's clear.

29:11.400 --> 29:18.400
But I'm gonna have to say to Tealdea, if you listen to the end of the sentence, the point is clear.

29:18.400 --> 29:26.400
Not content with responding to sentence fragments anymore, Tealdea is now responding just to individual words.

29:26.400 --> 29:30.400
Which looks quite fun, to be honest, so I'm gonna take a crack at it.

29:35.400 --> 29:42.400
Aye, of course. That is how Saint Sarkeesian would start off a speech, isn't it?

29:42.400 --> 29:45.400
Talking about her self.

29:45.400 --> 29:48.400
Oh, don't mind all those other people there, Anita.

29:48.400 --> 29:53.400
You just go ahead and make everyone listen to you talk about your favorite topic.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.400
Your self.

29:55.400 --> 29:58.400
And you know what? I'm sure they will.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.400
Look at this hive mind.

30:00.400 --> 30:04.400
Just over half of whom are sitting in a similar way,

30:04.400 --> 30:11.400
listening with rapt attention as their god empress tells them what they're allowed to think today.

30:11.400 --> 30:16.400
Oh, what's this, Anita? You had to do something?

30:16.400 --> 30:20.400
You really despise the idea that women can have free agency, don't you?

30:20.400 --> 30:26.400
Was it the patriarchy that made you do this unspecified action?

30:26.400 --> 30:33.400
I must have missed that meeting. Maybe I was off oppressing everyone by being a straight white male.

30:33.400 --> 30:39.400
So, go on, Anita. What was it that the evil patriarchy made you do?

30:39.400 --> 30:40.400
Learn.

30:40.400 --> 30:47.400
Oh, you had to learn. Well, how awful for you. I guess it must be difficult for a feminist.

30:47.400 --> 30:51.400
Learning things must be some alien concept for you.

30:51.400 --> 30:57.400
How evil of men to literally force you to learn something.

30:57.400 --> 31:02.400
Oh, but don't let me interrupt you, Anita. Go on. What did you simply have to learn about?

31:02.400 --> 31:04.400
How to be a feminist.

31:04.400 --> 31:09.400
Ah, yes. There we go. Straight from the horse's mouth.

31:09.400 --> 31:13.400
Feminism is unnatural.

31:13.400 --> 31:15.400
You know what?

31:15.400 --> 31:22.400
Somewhere out there in the multiverse, there's a version of my channel with a lot more subscribers.

31:22.400 --> 31:23.400
I'll say that.

31:23.400 --> 31:28.400
Anyway, let's get back to this, because I do have one more point to make about this,

31:28.400 --> 31:31.400
and it concerns the word ourselves.

31:31.400 --> 31:34.400
What does ourselves mean?

31:34.400 --> 31:36.400
It's a plural pronoun.

31:36.400 --> 31:44.400
We, or us personally, used to emphasise the speaker and one or more other people considered together.

31:44.400 --> 31:48.400
But that's not what Tealdea said. He said, yourself.

31:48.400 --> 31:53.400
But you should only be compassionate to yourself when you make those mistakes.

31:53.400 --> 31:58.400
Tealdea really should have said yourselves. Plural.

31:58.400 --> 32:04.400
Anita is talking about a group of feminists having compassion for themselves. Plural.

32:04.400 --> 32:12.400
Which may include, but does not necessarily require, each individual to have compassion for themselves. Singular.

32:12.400 --> 32:21.400
If every feminist feels compassion for all the other feminists, they all feel compassion for themselves. Plural, but not themselves. Singular.

32:21.400 --> 32:25.400
Which perfectly fits the dictionary definition of the word compassion.

32:26.400 --> 32:30.400
Now, that's not really what I think Anita exclusively meant there.

32:30.400 --> 32:35.400
I do think she was also talking about having compassion for oneself.

32:35.400 --> 32:39.400
Or I guess you could say, self-compassion.

32:39.400 --> 32:43.400
Wait, self-compassion? That's a thing?

32:43.400 --> 32:47.400
Well, fuck. You see, that's the problem with the dictionary.

32:47.400 --> 32:53.400
You think you have it memorized perfectly, and then people keep going around making up new shit.

32:53.400 --> 32:57.400
It's realizing that others will make mistakes, and we should extend that compassion to them as well.

32:57.400 --> 33:00.400
Unless, of course, that person is a straight white male.

33:00.400 --> 33:04.400
At which point you can presumably just condemn him to the pits of hell.

33:04.400 --> 33:06.400
Yes.

33:08.400 --> 33:15.400
Not really. Straight white guys are the touchiest, most fragile people on this planet, I swear to God.

33:15.400 --> 33:17.400
Grow a spine.

33:17.400 --> 33:19.400
Outro.

33:19.400 --> 33:21.400
Don't know why I said outro.

33:21.400 --> 33:26.400
I apologize about this one. I needed a little post-election catharsis, you know.

33:26.400 --> 33:30.400
I'll do something more substantial next time.

33:30.400 --> 33:33.400
If you'd like to get in touch, send me a-

33:33.400 --> 33:35.400
Cough. Cough. Cough.

33:35.400 --> 33:37.400
I'm still sick, by the way.

33:37.400 --> 33:40.400
Send me a message on Twitter or Ask FM.

33:40.400 --> 33:44.400
If you're feeling very charitable, there's a donation link on the YouTube banner.

33:44.400 --> 33:46.400
But don't donate because of this video.

33:46.400 --> 33:50.400
Go and watch one of my better videos, and then donate because of that.

33:51.400 --> 33:53.400
Right. See ya.
