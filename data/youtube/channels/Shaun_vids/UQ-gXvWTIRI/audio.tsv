0	8600	Hello, everyone. This is a video about T-L-semi-colon-D-R, or Teal-dear.
9200	12200	You see, because it's a teal-dear. Yeah.
12800	16800	And in particular, this video is a response to his video,
16800	20800	Anita Sarkeesian Doesn't Understand How To Be A Feminist,
20800	28000	concerning Anita Sarkeesian's speech at the How To Be A Feminist panel at All About Women, 2015.
28200	32600	But before we get to that, well, you know the drill by now.
33000	37000	So, the videos I'm asked to respond to broadly fall into two categories.
37000	41600	There's the, for want of a better word, intellectual videos.
41600	45600	You know, they cite studies and news stories and sources,
45600	49400	and at least attempt some sort of academic defense of their positions.
50000	54000	And on the other hand, we've got the peanut gallery, the hecklers.
54200	58200	And what they do is watch someone, usually a feminist,
58800	63800	and usually Anita Sarkeesian, to be honest, say a sentence,
63800	70000	and then they cut away to a cartoon animal doing the DreamWorks face, and they say a naughty word.
70000	74000	And I've honestly struggled to come up with a response to this sort of video.
74000	77600	You know, quite a few people have suggested that I look at bearing.
77600	80400	And well, let's briefly look at bearing.
80600	86000	And here's one of his responses from his video, the Young Turks have finally lost the plot.
86000	90600	"...and listen to you, or be near you, or whatever. Okay, fine, try to make that case.
90600	95000	It's stupid, but you can make that case. They're claiming that day that they're a man or a woman or whatever."
95000	98600	You know, your face just pisses me right off, cunt. Fuck you.
98600	104800	You know, how do you respond there? What could I possibly say back to that? Or this?
104800	108800	"...you are- they're trying to pretend that it's only so that guys can go into women's bathroom- bathrooms.
108800	111200	No, that's not the way that being transgender works."
111200	115400	Suck a bucket of dicks, you fuckhead. I'm not even gonna argue with you.
115400	119600	You know, there's no argument here. It's just mindless preaching to the choir.
119600	122400	It's not substantive enough to get a grasp on.
122400	127400	And well, I'll be honest, I've not watched all of bearing's videos, so maybe I'm being unfair.
127400	132600	If he has ever made anything better than that, someone please let me know.
133000	137400	Absent an argument, I guess one way to respond to these heckling videos
137400	143000	is to turn the particular shtick of whichever heckler it is back on themselves.
143000	148600	But I don't want to do that with bearing, because it'd just be me calling him a dickhead for 20 minutes,
148600	151200	and I don't think anyone really wants to watch that.
151200	155200	And I don't want to make that either. It'd be entirely too negative.
155200	158600	But with Teal Deer, I think I've found my man.
158600	165600	You see, Teal Deer has a particular quirk that I have no problem at all with turning back on him.
165600	167600	You see, he's a pedant.
167600	170600	As a woman on YouTube, I would describe my experience as...
172200	175000	...careful, empowering, brave.
175000	179600	Right, I'm gonna go full Grammar Nazi autist on this because I can.
179600	185000	Careful and brave are not experiences. Those are methods of acting.
185000	189000	They are a way of being. It's not something that you experience.
189000	191400	The actual sentence that you'd want to use would be
191400	195600	my experience on YouTube has involved me needing to be careful.
195600	199000	My experience on YouTube required me to be brave.
199000	202600	It's realising that being a feminist is a lifelong learning endeavour,
202600	204800	and that we will make some mistakes on the way.
204800	207500	And we should be compassionate to ourselves when that happens.
207500	210300	And speaking of mistakes that you make, Anita,
210300	213300	I really think that you should look up the definition of the word
213300	218100	compassion, because it doesn't mean what you think it means.
218100	225300	That's right. A pedant. An honest-to-God, old-school, dictionary-quoting pedant.
225300	228100	And that's gonna be our angle right there.
228100	232100	We are gonna be smug and pedantic right back at Teal Deer.
232100	238100	And I admit, I'm cheating a bit here by responding to a video about Anita Sarkeesian, who,
238100	242300	for whatever reason, always brings out the worst in these guys.
242300	246300	She's the red rag to the dumb YouTube bull.
247100	248100	Or...
248100	249800	deer, in this case.
249800	250300	BANG!
250300	250800	BANG!
252000	253300	So, let's get to it.
253300	256300	So, throughout high school and college, I was involved with clubs,
256300	259900	organising against wars in the Middle East, raising awareness about climate change,
259900	262100	and demanding gay and lesbian rights.
262100	266700	Ah, yes, because women have truly always been the primary victims of war.
266700	270900	They are also, quite obviously, the group most affected by climate change.
270900	275400	And it's a well-documented fact that homosexual men need feminism.
275400	281300	The only thing that you've mentioned there that even comes close to being an issue for feminism is lesbian rights,
281300	286600	and that is purely because some lesbians may choose to identify themselves as being feminists.
286600	290800	But you do realise that you can be a lesbian and not a feminist, right?
290800	294900	So you really shouldn't presume to speak for all lesbian women everywhere.
294900	297400	You heterosexual, oppressive shitlord.
297400	304400	After all, nothing quite says I'm fighting for equality like speaking over all of those marginalised voices.
304400	306200	So we're off to a good start.
306200	309800	Anita says she was involved with a bunch of social justice causes,
309800	316100	and then Tealdea cuts in to explain how he thinks those causes aren't feminist causes.
316100	317600	And there's a problem here.
317600	320800	Tealdea cut Anita off in the middle of a sentence.
320800	323600	You see, the start of Anita's speech reads like this.
323600	326400	But that's not the end of the sentence, right there.
326400	327600	She goes on to say,
333600	339100	Now, nowhere here is the implication that Anita does actually think that, say,
339100	342600	climate change, for instance, is a feminist cause.
342600	346900	She's merely listing some social justice causes she was involved with.
346900	353200	The implication being that one might expect someone who is heavily involved with a bunch of social justice causes
353200	354600	to be a feminist.
354600	362000	However, Anita's point is that, despite being involved with these various causes, she wasn't a feminist.
362000	366200	Cutting in to explain how those issues don't make you a feminist is jumping the gun,
366200	369200	because that was her point. She wasn't a feminist.
369200	373200	You see, Tealdea is responding to only a sentence fragment here,
373200	377200	so he got the wrong end of the stick and thought that the examples Anita listed
377200	381200	were exclusively examples of what she thinks are feminist causes.
381200	385000	But they weren't. Or, at least, they weren't necessarily.
385000	391000	I mean, Anita might think that war, for instance, is a feminist issue, and there's plenty of arguments for that.
391000	396000	One of the arguments for that is that it's mostly men who are expected to go and fight in wars.
396000	403400	Which Tealdea actually mentioned incorrectly, thinking that he was contradicting the idea that war is a feminist issue.
403400	405600	But, you know, there are other arguments.
405800	414000	The necessary relaxation of some traditional gender roles during wartime is certainly an interesting feminist issue, in my opinion.
414000	417400	And I say in my opinion because it's just my opinion.
417400	423000	Something to keep in mind going forward is that there is no one fixed meaning of feminism.
423000	427000	Whether or not certain issues are feminist issues is arguable.
427000	430800	You know, feminism, at a fundamental level, is an idea.
430800	434600	There is no feminism element on the periodic table.
434600	442400	There are no feminism atoms we can look at under a microscope to see if something is actually really feminist or not.
442800	445200	Is this pedantic enough for you all, by the way?
445200	448400	It's basically this for the rest of the video, I'm afraid.
448400	450200	And I'm very sorry.
450600	454000	You know, everything seems trivial after the election.
454600	457000	I need to do a lazy one to get back into it.
457000	461600	I'll get back to responding to something worthwhile soon-ish.
462400	463400	Leave me alone.
464200	465200	Let's move on.
466600	471000	So, like most people who grew up immersed in the neoliberal ideology of the West-
471000	472000	What?
472000	476000	Neoliberal ideology of the West.
476000	479000	Let's just break that one down for a moment, shall we?
479000	482000	Neo, meaning new.
482000	488400	Liberal, the idea that the world should be governed on a principle of liberty and equality for all people.
488400	492400	And this is supposed to somehow be a bad thing to think.
492400	496000	Oh wait, what am I saying? Of course it's bad, because it's the patriarchy, right?
496000	499000	But wait, hang on, what is modern feminism?
499000	504800	Well, it's new, so we could certainly describe it as being a Neo ideology.
504800	509400	And it keeps saying that it wants to push for equality for all people.
509400	514000	So yeah, that word actually kind of encompasses modern feminism as well.
514000	522000	I know you're trying to invent a load of bullshit nonsense buzzwords that people can then go home and throw out on their Twitter and Tumblr accounts
522000	527600	to try and make themselves look intellectual while they're talking about some mythical patriarchy.
527600	531600	But I really don't think you've even considered what these words actually mean.
531600	534800	Someone doesn't know what neoliberal means.
534800	536000	Ah ha ha ha.
536000	538000	Heh heh heh heh.
538000	541000	And man, this one takes me back.
541000	547000	So, long time Sean and Jen Watchers will remember my take on Leafy's video about Milo Stewart.
547200	552600	And in the course of making that video, I had to read thousands of Leafy's comments.
552600	557800	And one thing I saw over and over again was people who were confused by Milo's language.
557800	562200	You know, Milo's just making up all of those big words to seem clever.
562200	568000	And this shows how sheltered and kinda arrogant, to be honest, that I was at the time,
568000	572600	because the first few of those comments that I read, I assumed were jokes.
572600	575200	I was like, what big words?
575200	580600	You know, not that Milo isn't well-spoken or anything, but nothing he said was all that complicated.
580600	582800	Or so I thought, anyway.
582800	585400	I now realize that it's all relative, of course.
585400	590400	A lot of concepts are just new to a lot of people. There's nothing wrong with that.
590400	595000	It's entirely possible to have just not encountered the word neoliberalism before.
595000	599400	There's no shame at all in being ignorant of that concept.
599400	603600	What there is shame in is assuming that because you haven't heard of it before,
603600	610000	it must therefore be a bullshit buzzword someone else is just making up to look smart.
610000	616000	And then breaking it apart into its component pieces in an attempt to decipher its meaning,
616000	619400	rather than just admitting ignorance and looking it up.
619400	623400	Now, of course, YouTube commenters were quick to point out Tildir's mistake,
623400	626600	which led to him claiming it was just a joke.
626600	630200	Which led to the rather obvious follow-up question.
630200	632200	What was the joke?
632200	635600	And I guess after getting a bunch of comments explaining his mistake,
635600	640400	Tildir got sick of it and added the following disclaimer to the video description.
640400	645200	To all the people telling me I don't know what neoliberalism is, you missed the joke.
645200	647600	So here it is, spelled out for you.
647600	653400	She's ignoring the actual definition of neoliberalism and contorting it into some nebulous term
653400	658000	regarding oppression and privilege, and basically ignoring the economic aspect of it.
658000	663800	So I simply redefine it as well, so it can quite easily include herself.
663800	668000	Which, well, that's not actually true, is it, Tildir?
668000	672200	Because you explicitly accused Anita of inventing the term.
672200	675400	Sorry, the bullshit buzzword.
675400	679400	I know you're trying to invent a load of bullshit nonsense buzzwords
679400	683600	that people can then go home and throw out on their Twitter and Tumblr accounts
683600	689200	to try and make themselves look intellectual while they're talking about some mythical patriarchy.
689200	691800	You see, what actually happened here was
691800	696200	Anita Sarkeesian knew something that you didn't know.
696200	701000	In this one instance, Anita Sarkeesian was smarter than you.
701000	706400	But of course, Tildir can't possibly admit that because that would unravel his whole video,
706400	711200	the foundation of which is that Anita Sarkeesian has to be an idiot.
711200	714000	So he has to do the just a joke defense.
714000	716600	You know, I was just kidding, it was just satire.
716600	719400	I was doing the Socratic method.
719400	725400	I don't know what I was doing, but whatever it was, it wasn't not knowing something.
725400	726800	Heh heh.
726800	728600	Also, two more points.
728600	732600	Firstly, Anita is not ignoring the economic aspect of neoliberalism
732600	736000	because she goes on in her speech to draw explicit comparisons
736000	739800	between the neoliberal economic ideas of individualism and privatization
739800	743200	and the individualist ideas of choice feminism.
744200	749200	Secondly, Tildir mentions the actual definition of neoliberalism.
749200	753200	So, pray silence, everyone, for Professor Dictionary,
753200	756000	the inventor of all the words.
756000	759400	Come to tell us what they actually mean.
759400	763400	You see, if you do what Tildir should have done and Google neoliberalism,
763400	765200	you can read all about it for free,
765200	769200	and one of the first things that Wikipedia tells us about the term is this.
769200	772600	The definition and usage of the term has changed over time,
772600	779000	and it goes on to lay out all the differing and changing meanings of the word neoliberalism.
779000	781800	Speaking of definitions of words...
781800	785600	Back then, I thought sexism basically boiled down to a few bad apples
785600	790000	with misguided personal beliefs born out of ignorance or overt hatred.
790000	793400	Right, stop there. That is exactly what sexism is.
793400	796400	Just like racism. Just like homophobia.
796400	799400	They are not the wider pervasive views of society.
799400	803800	They are the views of a select few vast minority of society.
803800	810200	So, that's what sexism, racism, and homophobia mean for anyone who was wondering.
810200	815200	They're not societal or cultural problems, they're merely individual problems,
815200	816200	and that's all.
816200	820000	And that's quite nice, isn't it, to finally have that issue resolved?
820000	826000	However, Tildir later quotes the dictionary definition of the word compassion at Anita
826000	831800	in an attempt to catch her out on something, and he uses Google's dictionary feature for this.
831800	836600	So, let's see what Google's dictionary feature thinks of the word sexism.
836600	841400	And here's their example of the word sexism in a sentence.
841400	848400	Sexism in language is an offensive reminder of the way the culture sees women.
848400	853200	And while we're at it, let's just see what dictionary.com thinks of the word sexism.
853200	859000	Ingrained and institutionalized prejudice against or hatred of women.
859000	865000	So, the dictionaries at least seem to think sexism is more than just an individual problem.
865000	867400	Hey, you know, the dictionary.
867400	872600	Quote it when it agrees with you, and quietly ignore it when it doesn't.
872600	876400	With the help of some amazing mentors, and by reading a lot of feminist writing,
876400	880400	especially the words of women of color and queer women from around the world.
880400	886400	Because the opinions of white women and straight women are apparently lower on the hierarchy of importance than all of those people.
886400	892200	Also, you know what, I'm starting to lighten up to this idea of calling folks people of color and queers.
892200	896600	Because now, when I want to go on a good old-fashioned nigger lynch or fag drag,
896600	902000	I can use the correct terminology. Thanks, feminism, you fucking bigots.
902000	905000	So, I don't really know what was going on with that last bit.
905000	911400	I think it was just a joke that didn't quite hit the mark there, to put it rightly.
911400	920000	But let's address the part before that, where Anita says she especially read the words of women of color and queer women from around the world.
920000	926000	And Tealdea takes this to mean that Anita is discounting the words of straight white feminists.
926000	931600	However, this is another example of Tealdea cutting Anita off in the middle of a sentence.
931600	935000	You see, the rest of Anita's sentence reads like this.
935000	941000	And it's the intersecting social systems bit that I really want you to pay attention to here.
941000	945600	It's not that Anita's saying the words of straight white feminists don't matter.
945600	948600	It's that they're not enough by themselves.
948600	952400	She's saying you need a bunch of different viewpoints from different people.
952400	959400	So the words of women of color and queer women would be especially important for someone trying to understand interacting social systems
959400	964400	because they will have particular insights about things like race and sexuality
964400	969400	that you wouldn't necessarily get if you exclusively read the works of straight white people.
969400	975400	Unfortunately, many contemporary discourses in and around feminism tend to emphasize a form of hyper-individualism
975400	978400	which is informed by that neoliberal worldview.
978400	984200	You are really offended by this idea that people can and do think for themselves, aren't you?
984200	987800	Or is this just some sort of subtle manipulative way of you trying to say
987800	992400	Yeah, it's okay for you to think for yourself as long as what you think agrees with me.
992400	1000400	Because if you agree with me, that's the only way that you're not going to be a hyper-individual neoliberal shitlord.
1000400	1004400	And this part represents the main misunderstanding of Tealdea's here.
1004400	1006400	Tealdea's here.
1006400	1010400	Anita is going to go on to denounce so-called choice feminism
1010400	1015400	and argue that feminists have a responsibility beyond the individual.
1015400	1020400	Now, key to this idea is that individual actions do matter quite a lot.
1020400	1027400	That's the whole point, in fact, that individual actions have ramifications beyond the individual.
1027400	1032400	Anita's argument here relies upon the existence and importance of individuals.
1032400	1039400	Tealdea completely misses this and thinks Anita is arguing that individuals don't or shouldn't exist
1039400	1043400	and that feminism should be some sort of borg collective.
1043400	1045400	And he does this a lot.
1045400	1049400	So to save coming back to this point over and over again, let's go non-linear
1049400	1055400	and quickly bang through some of the other times he gets hung up on this individual point.
1055400	1059400	Because the individual choices of individual women do not matter.
1059400	1063400	The only thing that matters is the public image and branding of feminism,
1063400	1067400	which is more important than the freedom of choice, autonomy and liberty of any woman.
1067400	1074400	Bend your knee and submit, puny mortal women, submit to your goddess queen feminism!
1074400	1076400	There you go, straight from the horse's mouth.
1076400	1080400	You as a woman cannot be entrusted to empower yourself.
1080400	1084400	Saint Sarkeesian will decide what will empower you for you.
1084400	1088400	Because you are too weak, pathetic and stupid to be trusted.
1088400	1093400	And any action that you take that is not directly approved by Saint Sarkeesian
1093400	1097400	could risk damaging the holy image of feminism.
1097400	1100400	You actually have no concept of the individual, do you?
1100400	1103400	All you can see is the collective.
1103400	1108400	And anything that is not of the collective is against the collective.
1108400	1113400	You don't even seem to want women within that collective to identify as being individual women.
1113400	1116400	You just want them to be one large congealed-
1116400	1119400	Okay, you get the point. He says it a lot.
1119400	1126400	And I think the only other point to be made here is Tilda's completely ridiculous stretching of Anita's words
1126400	1129400	to their most absurd possible extent.
1129400	1133400	Anita's language is actually very measured and restrained.
1133400	1135400	Too restrained, in my opinion.
1135400	1137400	You know, she'll say something like,
1137400	1141400	some choices might possibly have negative ramifications,
1141400	1147400	Tilda responds hysterically, casting her as some sort of self-declared feminist dictator.
1147400	1150400	And I wonder if it's just feminism that sets him off,
1150400	1154400	or if Tilda takes this approach to every sentence he hears.
1154400	1156400	You know, for instance, if I say,
1156400	1158400	I'm quite tall.
1158400	1167400	Ah, right. So Sean thinks he's the tallest man who has ever lived on the entire planet in human history.
1168400	1174400	It was quite nice for Tilda to stop by there for that little cameo, wasn't it?
1174400	1177400	He's got a good sense of humour about himself.
1177400	1178400	At least.
1178400	1182400	Anyway, let's go back in time to where we left off.
1182400	1187400	Okay, so this is the part where I say things that may ruffle some feathers.
1187400	1191400	Ah, so after demonizing the white man, dehumanizing women,
1191400	1193400	people who aren't white and people who aren't straight,
1193400	1196400	down to the point that they have no autonomy of their own,
1196400	1198400	this is the point where things are going to get offensive.
1198400	1204400	This is the line in the sand past which the offensive stuff begins, apparently.
1204400	1208400	Now then, what on earth is he talking about here?
1208400	1210400	Just to pick one point out of that mess,
1210400	1213400	dehumanizing people who aren't straight,
1213400	1216400	down to the point where they have no autonomy of their own.
1216400	1219400	Where in her speech did Anita do that?
1219400	1222400	I think what he's talking about here is earlier,
1222400	1226400	when Anita said she was involved with clubs arguing for gay and lesbian rights,
1226400	1228400	and to which Tilda responded,
1228400	1232400	So you really shouldn't presume to speak for all lesbian women everywhere,
1232400	1235400	you heterosexual oppressive shitlord.
1235400	1238400	After all, nothing quite says I'm fighting for equality
1238400	1241400	like speaking over all of those marginalized voices.
1241400	1243400	You know, is that it?
1243400	1246400	The only other time Anita might have mentioned gay people
1246400	1249400	is when she said that she read the works of queer women.
1249400	1252400	So it's gotta be the first one, right?
1252400	1256400	Anita says, I support gay and lesbian rights.
1256400	1260400	And Tilda responds, ah, so you're dehumanizing gay people
1260400	1263400	to the point where they have no autonomy.
1263400	1266400	That's ridiculous.
1266400	1269400	I thought it was meant to be the social justice crowd
1269400	1272400	who were overly dramatic and easily outraged.
1272400	1275400	Anita is not dehumanizing gay people.
1275400	1278400	She isn't demonizing the white man.
1278400	1280400	In fact, if you read Anita's whole speech,
1280400	1284400	she hasn't even directly mentioned men at all up to now.
1284400	1290400	You know, no offense, Tilda, but, you know, chill out.
1290400	1292400	But I think it's a critical discussion to have.
1292400	1294400	No, it really isn't.
1294400	1296400	But you know what is a critical discussion to have?
1296400	1300400	The blatant hive mind that is on display in front of us right now.
1300400	1304400	Notice how every single woman is sitting in exactly the same way,
1304400	1309400	bar the one notable exception who is anatomically unable to do so,
1309400	1313400	because her legs are in fact beginning to fuse together in her chrysalis stage,
1313400	1316400	at which point she will emerge as a full-fledged hot.
1316400	1319400	Just an observation. Anyway, let's keep going.
1319400	1325400	So, completely unnecessary, unfair and tangential attack on an unrelated person aside,
1325400	1331400	I absolutely love the concept of a hive mind, but with exceptions.
1331400	1335400	You know, if we look at the source video and the next wide shot of the whole panel,
1335400	1339400	we see that the two people to Anita's left are sitting differently.
1339400	1343400	Jermaine Greer has both of her feet on the ground,
1343400	1348400	and the person on the end has their legs crossed in the other direction.
1349400	1351400	How did it come to this?
1351400	1357400	So, look at all these women sitting in the exact same way,
1357400	1359400	except for the ones who aren't.
1359400	1363400	Four out of seven. What a hive mind that is.
1364400	1368400	The fact of the matter is that some choices have ramifications beyond ourselves
1368400	1372400	and reinforce harmful patriarchal ideas about women as a group
1372400	1375400	and about women's bodies and our wider shared culture.
1375400	1379400	And because of how systems of oppression intersect and compound one another,
1379400	1383400	it's women of colour, indigenous women, women living in the global south,
1383400	1388400	women with disabilities, queer women and trans women who bear the brunt of these ramifications.
1388400	1390400	So how do you live with yourself?
1390400	1394400	Because you're a white woman, which means you're obviously oppressing every non-white woman.
1394400	1399400	You're of Armenian descent, which means that you are not indigenous to America,
1399400	1405400	and are therefore oppressing all of the people who lived in America before European colonisation.
1405400	1410400	You live in the global north, which means you're automatically oppressing everyone in the global south.
1410400	1414400	You're able-bodied, so you're instantly oppressing everyone who is disabled.
1414400	1417400	And as far as I'm aware, you're straight and not transsexual,
1417400	1421400	so you're oppressing every non-straight transsexual in the world.
1421400	1424400	Honestly, with the massive amount of oppression that you're exerting on this world,
1424400	1428400	I'm quite surprised you haven't killed yourself. You know, just from the guilt of it all.
1428400	1432400	Well, Tealdea, allow me to shed some light on this.
1432400	1437400	You see, Anita said that some choices have ramifications beyond ourselves
1437400	1440400	to reinforce harmful patriarchal ideas about women as a group,
1440400	1448400	and that it's the various minorities and disadvantaged groups she mentioned that bear the brunt of those ramifications.
1448400	1454400	Although, if you notice, Anita used the wrong bear in bear the brunt there. Anyway.
1454400	1462400	What she's saying is that some individual choices lead to the ramifications of which the disadvantaged groups bear the brunt.
1462400	1465400	And implicit here is the contrary.
1465400	1469400	Some individual choices do not lead to these harmful ramifications,
1469400	1473400	and it is these choices that Anita Sarkeesian is advocating for.
1473400	1479400	She's explicitly not saying that oppression of minorities is automatic and inescapable.
1479400	1484400	She's saying that one can choose to be aware of these oppressive systems and help put an end to them.
1484400	1492400	So, Anita Sarkeesian hasn't killed herself because she thinks that the oppressive systems can be stopped,
1492400	1499400	and that she can help to stop them by her choices. You get it? Yeah.
1499400	1504400	Women can choose from a pre-approved palette, but we cannot meaningfully choose liberation.
1504400	1509400	Okay, you know what? I am getting really sick of all of this feminism social justice bullshit.
1509400	1512400	So I am making a patriarchal decision and announcement.
1512400	1517400	As of immediate effect, feminism and social justice warrior are now removed
1517400	1522400	from the patriarchal palette of pre-approved roles that women can fill in society.
1522400	1529400	So I'll give that a couple of days for the message to get around, and then feminism and social justice will just go away, right?
1529400	1536400	Oh, wait. No, it won't. Because this mythological patriarchy palette doesn't fucking exist!
1536400	1543400	Ah, TLD is doing the misunderstanding the patriarchy thing. Seen that one before.
1543400	1550400	A bunch of these dudes hear patriarchy and see this, like a secret male illuminati who decide everything,
1550400	1555400	and then they project that misunderstanding back onto where they heard the word patriarchy,
1555400	1558400	and they don't bother to go and check if it's right.
1558400	1563400	I think this just comes down to having no faith at all in women's intelligence.
1563400	1570400	You know, any idea they come up with automatically has to be the most stupid possible interpretation of that idea.
1570400	1577400	It's understanding our own intersections of privilege and oppression and how that will fundamentally change our behaviours and attitudes and values.
1577400	1583400	It's realising that being a feminist is a lifelong learning endeavour, and that we will make some mistakes on the way,
1583400	1586400	and we should be compassionate to ourselves when that happens.
1586400	1591400	Yeah, mistakes will be made. Like demonising half of the population,
1591400	1598400	and then telling the remaining half of the population that they're too incompetent to be trusted forming their own destiny in life.
1598400	1603400	But you should only be compassionate to yourself when you make those mistakes.
1603400	1610400	And speaking of mistakes that you make, Anita, I really think that you should look up the definition of the word compassion,
1610400	1613400	because it doesn't mean what you think it means.
1613400	1618400	And here we go. It's the reason I decided to respond to this video.
1618400	1622400	So as I mentioned before, this dictionary is Google's dictionary.
1622400	1627400	The same dictionary that previously disagreed with TLD is narrow interpretation of the word sexism.
1627400	1638400	So here, TLD is upset because Anita said that we, talking about feminists, will make mistakes and should be compassionate to ourselves when that happens.
1638400	1645400	Because he thinks the word compassion can only be used with regards to things other than the self.
1645400	1648400	And that is the common understanding of the word.
1648400	1654400	If you just say, you have compassion, the listener will generally assume that you mean for other people.
1654400	1662400	If you want them to understand the idea of having compassion for oneself, you'd need some other words in that sentence.
1662400	1668400	You know, some surrounding context that modifies the meaning of the word compassion.
1668400	1671400	And Anita does seem to have thought of this.
1671400	1678400	Let's see how she starts off trying to get the idea of having compassion for oneself across to her audience.
1679400	1682400	Compassion, right. But we all know what this means.
1682400	1687400	Sympathetic pity and concern for the sufferings or misfortunes of others.
1687400	1692400	Uh-oh, Anita. Bad start there. You're gonna have to do better than that.
1692400	1695400	How are you gonna dig yourself out of this hole?
1697400	1701400	Hang on, what does to mean?
1701400	1706400	A preposition? Used for expressing aim, purpose, or intention?
1707400	1711400	Very sneaky, Anita. You see, she's given herself an out.
1711400	1719400	If her next word, whatever it is, differs from the dictionary definition of what it is understood people usually have compassion for,
1719400	1723400	she will have successfully modified the word.
1723400	1727400	Anita Sarkeesian is a literary genius.
1727400	1731400	I can't wait to see what she comes up with next.
1731400	1735400	And holy shit, the rollercoaster ride is over.
1735400	1739400	And taking this all together, we understand the idea.
1739400	1744400	We should be compassionate to ourselves.
1744400	1748400	Now, when I make these videos, I usually end up saying something like,
1748400	1751400	if you watch the whole video, the point's clear.
1751400	1758400	But I'm gonna have to say to Tealdea, if you listen to the end of the sentence, the point is clear.
1758400	1766400	Not content with responding to sentence fragments anymore, Tealdea is now responding just to individual words.
1766400	1770400	Which looks quite fun, to be honest, so I'm gonna take a crack at it.
1775400	1782400	Aye, of course. That is how Saint Sarkeesian would start off a speech, isn't it?
1782400	1785400	Talking about her self.
1785400	1788400	Oh, don't mind all those other people there, Anita.
1788400	1793400	You just go ahead and make everyone listen to you talk about your favorite topic.
1793400	1795400	Your self.
1795400	1798400	And you know what? I'm sure they will.
1798400	1800400	Look at this hive mind.
1800400	1804400	Just over half of whom are sitting in a similar way,
1804400	1811400	listening with rapt attention as their god empress tells them what they're allowed to think today.
1811400	1816400	Oh, what's this, Anita? You had to do something?
1816400	1820400	You really despise the idea that women can have free agency, don't you?
1820400	1826400	Was it the patriarchy that made you do this unspecified action?
1826400	1833400	I must have missed that meeting. Maybe I was off oppressing everyone by being a straight white male.
1833400	1839400	So, go on, Anita. What was it that the evil patriarchy made you do?
1839400	1840400	Learn.
1840400	1847400	Oh, you had to learn. Well, how awful for you. I guess it must be difficult for a feminist.
1847400	1851400	Learning things must be some alien concept for you.
1851400	1857400	How evil of men to literally force you to learn something.
1857400	1862400	Oh, but don't let me interrupt you, Anita. Go on. What did you simply have to learn about?
1862400	1864400	How to be a feminist.
1864400	1869400	Ah, yes. There we go. Straight from the horse's mouth.
1869400	1873400	Feminism is unnatural.
1873400	1875400	You know what?
1875400	1882400	Somewhere out there in the multiverse, there's a version of my channel with a lot more subscribers.
1882400	1883400	I'll say that.
1883400	1888400	Anyway, let's get back to this, because I do have one more point to make about this,
1888400	1891400	and it concerns the word ourselves.
1891400	1894400	What does ourselves mean?
1894400	1896400	It's a plural pronoun.
1896400	1904400	We, or us personally, used to emphasise the speaker and one or more other people considered together.
1904400	1908400	But that's not what Tealdea said. He said, yourself.
1908400	1913400	But you should only be compassionate to yourself when you make those mistakes.
1913400	1918400	Tealdea really should have said yourselves. Plural.
1918400	1924400	Anita is talking about a group of feminists having compassion for themselves. Plural.
1924400	1932400	Which may include, but does not necessarily require, each individual to have compassion for themselves. Singular.
1932400	1941400	If every feminist feels compassion for all the other feminists, they all feel compassion for themselves. Plural, but not themselves. Singular.
1941400	1945400	Which perfectly fits the dictionary definition of the word compassion.
1946400	1950400	Now, that's not really what I think Anita exclusively meant there.
1950400	1955400	I do think she was also talking about having compassion for oneself.
1955400	1959400	Or I guess you could say, self-compassion.
1959400	1963400	Wait, self-compassion? That's a thing?
1963400	1967400	Well, fuck. You see, that's the problem with the dictionary.
1967400	1973400	You think you have it memorized perfectly, and then people keep going around making up new shit.
1973400	1977400	It's realizing that others will make mistakes, and we should extend that compassion to them as well.
1977400	1980400	Unless, of course, that person is a straight white male.
1980400	1984400	At which point you can presumably just condemn him to the pits of hell.
1984400	1986400	Yes.
1988400	1995400	Not really. Straight white guys are the touchiest, most fragile people on this planet, I swear to God.
1995400	1997400	Grow a spine.
1997400	1999400	Outro.
1999400	2001400	Don't know why I said outro.
2001400	2006400	I apologize about this one. I needed a little post-election catharsis, you know.
2006400	2010400	I'll do something more substantial next time.
2010400	2013400	If you'd like to get in touch, send me a-
2013400	2015400	Cough. Cough. Cough.
2015400	2017400	I'm still sick, by the way.
2017400	2020400	Send me a message on Twitter or Ask FM.
2020400	2024400	If you're feeling very charitable, there's a donation link on the YouTube banner.
2024400	2026400	But don't donate because of this video.
2026400	2030400	Go and watch one of my better videos, and then donate because of that.
2031400	2033400	Right. See ya.
