0	6500	Hello there, and, as you can tell from the title, today we're gonna be talking about some heavy stuff.
6500	11300	And, to be honest, I wasn't that sure if this was a good idea or not.
11300	17600	I've been told that every time you talk about politics or religion, you cut your audience in half.
17600	20900	But I've got a lot of opinions that I wanna talk about,
20900	25900	and I figured that it was better to cut my audience in half now, when it's tiny,
25900	30900	rather than six months down the line, when I've got five million subscribers.
30900	34200	You know, it just makes sense, mathematically.
34200	40700	So then, I got a comment recently on my video that I made about Leafy and Milo Stewart,
40700	45900	and it was left by a guy called Jason Todd, and he was taking issue with Milo's
45900	48400	All White People Are Racist comment.
48400	51200	Now, in the first part of his comment, he says,
51300	57100	You attempted to take a logical, middle-of-the-road stance here, but it's clear you have a bias.
57100	60700	He then gives the dictionary definition of the word racism.
60700	65500	Then he says that some people can grow up, uh, without subconscious biases.
65500	66500	Uh, quote,
67000	72400	Despite your belief that society at large is indoctrinating people to hold racist beliefs,
72400	78800	you seem to forget about the people who grow up in households where they are not raised with these subconscious beliefs.
78800	81600	Now, I disagree with that statement for a start,
81600	87600	because I don't think it's possible to have any sort of meaningful interaction with society in general,
87600	92700	and not come into contact with anything that might cause a subconscious bias.
92700	97400	You know, excluding people who were raised by wolves or in fallout shelters or something,
97400	101200	I'd say that we all have some level of racial bias.
101200	106100	However, I will concede it's hard to prove if a subconscious bias exists or not,
106100	111800	because it's subconscious, you know, by its nature, it's hard to detect.
111800	115400	And now, I personally wouldn't come out and say something like,
115400	119700	All white people are racist, even though I do understand the argument,
119700	127400	because, being white, I have the luxury of avoiding the more confrontational racial arguments, if I feel like it,
127400	131300	and I will gladly exercise my privilege in that regard.
131300	134500	But if I did have to say that all white people are racist,
134500	140100	I'd bury the lead and waffle a lot and lay a lot of groundwork beforehand,
140100	142900	and then that just makes the statement lose its shock value,
142900	147200	and that kinda negates the point of saying it in the first place.
147200	151500	You see, the argument to be had with the all white people are racist approach,
151500	157500	if we grant that the person saying it is arguing in good faith, anyway, is one of efficacy.
157500	161000	You know, on the one hand, racism is a powerful word,
161000	165100	and it does draw a lot of attention to an issue that needs a lot of attention.
165100	169600	But on the other hand, you are gonna get a lot of backlash saying something like that,
169600	173400	and is the increased attention worth the backlash?
173500	177400	It seems like, for everyone that sticks around to hear the explanation,
177400	179700	you're gonna have turned someone else off,
179700	183800	and, personally, I just can't judge if that's worth it or not.
183800	187700	You know, someone smarter than me can puzzle that one out.
187700	193000	So, let's move on to the second part of Jason Todd's comment, where he says, quote,
193000	199400	However, believing races are superior to one another, on average, in regards to certain things,
199400	205200	is perfectly reasonable, and it's fucking stupid to claim we're all perfectly equal in every way.
205200	210900	We aren't equal within our own race. How can we be equal across races?
210900	217400	So, first off, I don't think you'll find many people who'll say everyone is literally equal in every regard.
217400	223900	Usually, when people say all races are equal, they're talking about the possible range of potentialities,
223900	227800	you know, rather than meaning to be completely literal about it.
227800	229900	Jason then goes on to say,
240100	241600	So, let's debate this.
241600	244800	Uh, now, there's a few different lines of argument here,
244800	248500	and I'm gonna wander pretty far away from Jason's actual comments,
248500	253100	but I will come back to address them specifically at the end.
253100	260100	First up is context, and welcome to the wonderfully complicated world of statements
260100	264800	which are true in one regard, but not true in other regards.
264800	272200	And, as an example, let's first look at a simple statement which is hopefully free of any racial baggage.
272200	273200	Okay,
277000	282800	Well, free of context, that statement is neither true nor untrue.
282800	290200	If we're talking about domesticated dogs and cats, then yes, it's true that, on average, dogs are larger than cats.
290200	296900	And Jason quite rightly includes this, on average, qualifier in his statements about Black and Asian people.
296900	301600	Now, there are, of course, particularly small dogs and particularly large cats
301600	305100	which make the statement untrue in every instance.
305100	310900	And newborn dogs are often smaller than fully grown cats, but they're still dogs.
310900	317200	And even the words dog and cat need clarification, you know, a tiger is a cat, technically,
317200	322000	so cats are ultimately larger than dogs on an individual scale.
322000	328200	You know, what I'm getting at here is that, depending on the context, the statement can be read as true or untrue.
328200	330800	By itself, it's meaningless.
330800	335500	Let's apply this thinking to a comparative statement about different races,
335500	339800	and you've probably come across this one online before.
339800	348200	Now, I see this sort of thing all the time, and it's usually justifying a reported police bias against Black people or some such.
348200	350800	So, is it a true statement?
350800	355800	Well, again, by itself, it can't tell us anything. You know, we need the context.
355800	361100	So, let's talk about this statement, and we'll see if we can't make it mean something.
361100	364600	So, first off, we need a location.
364600	369300	Where are we talking about here? Are we talking about worldwide or in a specific country?
369300	373800	You know, to narrow it down a bit, we'll say America.
373800	379300	In America, Black people are more likely to be criminals than white people.
379300	385300	Now then, what does more likely mean, exactly? Are we speaking genetically?
385300	390900	Outside of capital R, racist, KKK types, most people will say no.
390900	395100	Not genetically, just statistically, for whatever reason.
395100	398900	You know, cultural, social, economic, or whatever.
398900	404300	And if we're talking statistically, we have to ask, where do these statistics come from?
404300	410900	Because, of course, we don't have a perfect record of all the criminals out there, for what I hope are obvious reasons.
410900	417100	It's usually data taken from the police and the court system, so we'll add this qualifier, too.
417100	421900	And now, this raises a lot of questions about how that data is gathered,
421900	425700	because there could be problems with the method of data collection.
425700	431300	Let's imagine you're a new police chief in a city, and you're looking at statistics that say
431300	436500	Black people are 20% more likely than white people to be criminals.
436500	443300	Now, you have limited resources, and obviously you want to combat crime as effectively as you can,
443300	447500	so you logically choose to disproportionately target Black people.
447500	452900	You know, you're not racist, you're just spending your resources tackling crime
452900	455900	where the statistics say it's more likely to be.
455900	457500	Now, here's the problem with that.
457500	464500	A year down the line, when you update the statistics, you'll see an increase in Black crime relative to white crime.
464500	470700	The extra time and effort you spent chasing Black criminals meant that you caught more Black criminals,
470700	474900	and the decreased focus on white criminals meant you caught fewer.
474900	480300	And now you're looking at statistics that say Black people are 30% more likely to be criminals,
480300	482700	and you end up in a spiral.
482900	485700	You know, this is how you end up in situations like
485700	492700	Black Americans being arrested for marijuana possession at a national rate which is around triple that of white people,
493300	497900	despite Black people and white people actually smoking weed at similar rates.
498300	500100	And that's just on the police end, you know.
500100	505300	If we consider the court system, we're gonna have to add another qualifier to our statement,
505300	508100	because the justice system isn't perfect, you know.
508100	512900	Sometimes guilty people go free, and sometimes innocent people get convicted,
512900	518300	and of course, Black people are more likely to be convicted of the same crimes than white people,
518300	523300	and they receive harsher punishments than white people, and that has an effect on the stats too.
523300	528100	So we'll say that Black people are more likely to be found to be criminals,
528100	532900	because that's something that is actually measurable with a degree of confidence.
532900	535100	And there's something else to be considered here.
535500	538900	What is considered a crime changes over time.
538900	543100	You know, certain things that were illegal become legal and vice versa,
543100	547900	and some of those things can disproportionately affect different races.
547900	552100	You know, for instance, what happens to that inflated number of Black people
552100	556700	considered criminals for marijuana possession if marijuana possession gets legalized?
556700	560500	Suddenly, you're looking at a completely different set of statistics.
560500	564100	So you really need a time scale in there as well.
564100	567300	And I'm sure there are other things we could talk about, like...
567300	571700	consider one guy who's a banker who defrauds the country of millions.
571700	574100	He only counts as one criminal.
574100	578500	The same as a guy who gets busted for shoplifting counts as one criminal.
578500	582300	And more realistically, the banker probably counts as no criminals,
582300	587900	because he donates huge amounts of money to the people who get to decide if he's a criminal or not,
587900	591100	but we're kinda getting off topic a bit there.
591300	594500	So for the sake of sanity, we will take a break here.
594500	599300	And if you haven't noticed by now, I really don't like statements like the first one,
599300	604900	and I'm very keen on people giving the full context when they're talking about things like this.
604900	606300	Why is that?
606300	612100	Well, coming back to Jason Todd for a minute, he answers this in a comment, where he says,
612100	616900	I apologize if the you-cannot-debate-this seemed harsh and assuming,
616900	622700	but in my mind, it's near impossible to debate the validity of statistics that have proper citation.
622700	628500	Maybe you mean arguing or making statements on the implications of such averages.
628500	630900	And yet, that's pretty much it.
630900	636300	You see, if you just say this, a lot of people are gonna start making assumptions,
636300	640300	often genetic, racist assumptions.
640500	643700	And of course, a lot of the times you do see a sentence like this,
643700	648500	it's because the person saying it wants people to make those assumptions.
648500	652500	You know, this statement isn't good enough by itself.
652500	658700	And my opinion is the same for what we'll call the positive statements that Jason wrote in.
658700	665300	On average, blacks make better basketball players, and on average, Asians score higher on the SAT.
665300	670100	Because both of those things are only true in certain regards.
670100	675300	You know, if we look at something like, on average, Asians score higher on the SAT,
675300	680300	now, the assumption a lot of people will make there is that this means Asians are, on average,
680300	683100	genetically smarter than black people.
683100	686500	And that is a lazy and unscientific deduction,
686500	692100	when there could be lots of other reasons behind why Asian people tend to score higher on the SAT.
692100	694500	And let's think about a few of those.
694500	701100	Now, first off, a huge predictor of your own academic success is your parents' academic success.
701100	704300	And another is your parents' financial status.
704300	710100	Now, it follows that richer, better educated parents have richer, better educated children.
710100	711900	And now, here's the thing.
711900	719500	A considerable amount of American black people alive today either remember having to go to segregated schools,
719500	723500	or they are the children of people who went to segregated schools.
723500	731100	You know, it really wasn't that long ago that black people legally had to go to worse, underfunded schools,
731100	733900	and get a worse education than white people.
733900	735500	It's not ancient history.
735500	739700	That little girl in the Norman Rockwell painting, you know, she's still alive.
739700	744100	She's a teacher, and she's not even that old, really. It's...
744100	751700	You know, these sorts of things take a lot of generations to shrink to the point where they're statistically insignificant.
751700	758300	Now, on the other hand, Asian people are comparatively much more likely to be college-educated,
758300	760700	and there's a few reasons behind that.
760700	764500	Now, it's going back a ways here, but there's a few things you could read up on,
764500	768100	like the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882,
768100	771700	the Immigration Act of 1924,
771700	773700	the National Origins Act,
773700	776300	the Asian Exclusion Act, and whatnot.
776300	780300	But you can probably guess right now from the names that, for a long time,
780300	784700	the US government didn't want Asian people coming to America.
784700	788700	And these acts were all repealed around the time of the Second World War.
788700	792900	Now, recent legal Asian immigration into the US is voluntary,
792900	799300	and, of course, requires a certain skill set, or a certain amount of wealth, or both.
799300	802100	And the population of China, for instance, is massive,
802100	807100	and there's always relatively rich, educated people looking to move to the US.
807300	812300	Now, the majority of recent Asian immigrants into the US have bachelor's degrees,
812300	819700	and their children and grandchildren will grow up with relatively rich, college-educated parents.
819700	824100	And they are the Asian people who are taking the SAT.
824100	827700	You know, a bunch of impoverished North Korean farmers,
827700	831100	they are not going to be taking the American SAT.
831100	833900	And if they did, they would do shit.
833900	837100	You see, this statement is just not enough by itself.
837100	840900	It's technically correct in one regard, but to really understand it,
840900	844700	you need to know the history and the context and all that good stuff.
844700	849700	Now, one good point of comparison here is that young black children who are adopted
849700	853700	tend to do better on tests than other non-adopted black kids.
853700	859300	And that's because, to adopt a kid, you need to prove a certain level of financial security,
859700	864500	safety, and stability that a lot of non-adopted kids don't have.
864500	868900	Adopted kids are generally growing up in richer, safer households,
868900	872700	and as a result, they do better in early academic tests.
872700	877300	You see, if you change the circumstances, you get different results.
877300	881900	However, we can only get so far looking at this scientifically,
881900	887900	because we're missing a key part of the scientific process, and that's a control test.
887900	892300	You know, we don't have another America that's free of racial bias,
892300	896300	where all races are economically equal to compare to.
896300	899500	We can't do the SATs over one year and say,
899500	904100	okay, guys, this time we're gonna try it without a history of racial oppression
904100	908300	and where everyone grew up in a financially secure, stable household.
908300	910100	You know, it's just not possible.
910100	915700	So, it's a bit irresponsible to be throwing out unscientific ideas like this one,
915900	920300	just because they happen to be technically right in one regard.
920300	925100	And I think there's a point to be made here about technically being right.
925100	927100	People love being right.
927100	929300	A little aside before I end the video.
929300	932700	I remember a series of Richard Dawkins tweets
932700	938900	where he was ranking how bad different types of rapes are and saying things like,
939100	941300	Mild pedophilia is bad.
941300	944300	Violent pedophilia is worse.
944300	945900	Date rape is bad.
945900	949500	Stranger rape at knife point is worse.
949500	952700	And, like, I'll disagree with Richard Dawkins on that point,
952700	956100	but even if he's right, and he might even be right,
956100	958300	you know, shut up.
958300	960300	Shut up, Richard Dawkins.
960300	963700	Being right isn't an excuse for being a prick.
963700	968500	I hope Richard Dawkins' wife never asked him if her ass looked fat in a dress.
968500	973100	Actually, he just got divorced recently, so who knows, maybe she did.
975100	977100	That's so unfair.
977100	980100	So anyway, guys, thanks for watching.
980100	985500	I know this is a bit of a weird, boring, talky video with not much going on,
985500	987700	but, uh, let me know what you think.
987700	989700	It's a little experiment.
989700	993700	And, uh, thanks to Jason Todd, who, even though we disagree,
993700	998500	you know, he was relatively nice about it, and he didn't call me any horrible names or anything,
998500	1001300	so that was a refreshing change.
1001300	1002900	Thank you, Jason.
1002900	1005900	Although, he did end his comment by saying,
1005900	1007900	You gotta be careful with stuff like that.
1007900	1011900	I'm sure you don't want alt-right storefronters flooding your videos.
1011900	1014900	And that's just not true. I do want that.
1014900	1016700	That sounds like it'd be funny.
1016700	1021300	So, please share this video to a bunch of racist people.
1021300	1023500	You have my blessing.
1023500	1024500	To do that.
