00:00.000 --> 00:06.500
Hello there, and, as you can tell from the title, today we're gonna be talking about some heavy stuff.

00:06.500 --> 00:11.300
And, to be honest, I wasn't that sure if this was a good idea or not.

00:11.300 --> 00:17.600
I've been told that every time you talk about politics or religion, you cut your audience in half.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.900
But I've got a lot of opinions that I wanna talk about,

00:20.900 --> 00:25.900
and I figured that it was better to cut my audience in half now, when it's tiny,

00:25.900 --> 00:30.900
rather than six months down the line, when I've got five million subscribers.

00:30.900 --> 00:34.200
You know, it just makes sense, mathematically.

00:34.200 --> 00:40.700
So then, I got a comment recently on my video that I made about Leafy and Milo Stewart,

00:40.700 --> 00:45.900
and it was left by a guy called Jason Todd, and he was taking issue with Milo's

00:45.900 --> 00:48.400
All White People Are Racist comment.

00:48.400 --> 00:51.200
Now, in the first part of his comment, he says,

00:51.300 --> 00:57.100
You attempted to take a logical, middle-of-the-road stance here, but it's clear you have a bias.

00:57.100 --> 01:00.700
He then gives the dictionary definition of the word racism.

01:00.700 --> 01:05.500
Then he says that some people can grow up, uh, without subconscious biases.

01:05.500 --> 01:06.500
Uh, quote,

01:07.000 --> 01:12.400
Despite your belief that society at large is indoctrinating people to hold racist beliefs,

01:12.400 --> 01:18.800
you seem to forget about the people who grow up in households where they are not raised with these subconscious beliefs.

01:18.800 --> 01:21.600
Now, I disagree with that statement for a start,

01:21.600 --> 01:27.600
because I don't think it's possible to have any sort of meaningful interaction with society in general,

01:27.600 --> 01:32.700
and not come into contact with anything that might cause a subconscious bias.

01:32.700 --> 01:37.400
You know, excluding people who were raised by wolves or in fallout shelters or something,

01:37.400 --> 01:41.200
I'd say that we all have some level of racial bias.

01:41.200 --> 01:46.100
However, I will concede it's hard to prove if a subconscious bias exists or not,

01:46.100 --> 01:51.800
because it's subconscious, you know, by its nature, it's hard to detect.

01:51.800 --> 01:55.400
And now, I personally wouldn't come out and say something like,

01:55.400 --> 01:59.700
All white people are racist, even though I do understand the argument,

01:59.700 --> 02:07.400
because, being white, I have the luxury of avoiding the more confrontational racial arguments, if I feel like it,

02:07.400 --> 02:11.300
and I will gladly exercise my privilege in that regard.

02:11.300 --> 02:14.500
But if I did have to say that all white people are racist,

02:14.500 --> 02:20.100
I'd bury the lead and waffle a lot and lay a lot of groundwork beforehand,

02:20.100 --> 02:22.900
and then that just makes the statement lose its shock value,

02:22.900 --> 02:27.200
and that kinda negates the point of saying it in the first place.

02:27.200 --> 02:31.500
You see, the argument to be had with the all white people are racist approach,

02:31.500 --> 02:37.500
if we grant that the person saying it is arguing in good faith, anyway, is one of efficacy.

02:37.500 --> 02:41.000
You know, on the one hand, racism is a powerful word,

02:41.000 --> 02:45.100
and it does draw a lot of attention to an issue that needs a lot of attention.

02:45.100 --> 02:49.600
But on the other hand, you are gonna get a lot of backlash saying something like that,

02:49.600 --> 02:53.400
and is the increased attention worth the backlash?

02:53.500 --> 02:57.400
It seems like, for everyone that sticks around to hear the explanation,

02:57.400 --> 02:59.700
you're gonna have turned someone else off,

02:59.700 --> 03:03.800
and, personally, I just can't judge if that's worth it or not.

03:03.800 --> 03:07.700
You know, someone smarter than me can puzzle that one out.

03:07.700 --> 03:13.000
So, let's move on to the second part of Jason Todd's comment, where he says, quote,

03:13.000 --> 03:19.400
However, believing races are superior to one another, on average, in regards to certain things,

03:19.400 --> 03:25.200
is perfectly reasonable, and it's fucking stupid to claim we're all perfectly equal in every way.

03:25.200 --> 03:30.900
We aren't equal within our own race. How can we be equal across races?

03:30.900 --> 03:37.400
So, first off, I don't think you'll find many people who'll say everyone is literally equal in every regard.

03:37.400 --> 03:43.900
Usually, when people say all races are equal, they're talking about the possible range of potentialities,

03:43.900 --> 03:47.800
you know, rather than meaning to be completely literal about it.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.900
Jason then goes on to say,

04:00.100 --> 04:01.600
So, let's debate this.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.800
Uh, now, there's a few different lines of argument here,

04:04.800 --> 04:08.500
and I'm gonna wander pretty far away from Jason's actual comments,

04:08.500 --> 04:13.100
but I will come back to address them specifically at the end.

04:13.100 --> 04:20.100
First up is context, and welcome to the wonderfully complicated world of statements

04:20.100 --> 04:24.800
which are true in one regard, but not true in other regards.

04:24.800 --> 04:32.200
And, as an example, let's first look at a simple statement which is hopefully free of any racial baggage.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.200
Okay,

04:37.000 --> 04:42.800
Well, free of context, that statement is neither true nor untrue.

04:42.800 --> 04:50.200
If we're talking about domesticated dogs and cats, then yes, it's true that, on average, dogs are larger than cats.

04:50.200 --> 04:56.900
And Jason quite rightly includes this, on average, qualifier in his statements about Black and Asian people.

04:56.900 --> 05:01.600
Now, there are, of course, particularly small dogs and particularly large cats

05:01.600 --> 05:05.100
which make the statement untrue in every instance.

05:05.100 --> 05:10.900
And newborn dogs are often smaller than fully grown cats, but they're still dogs.

05:10.900 --> 05:17.200
And even the words dog and cat need clarification, you know, a tiger is a cat, technically,

05:17.200 --> 05:22.000
so cats are ultimately larger than dogs on an individual scale.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.200
You know, what I'm getting at here is that, depending on the context, the statement can be read as true or untrue.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.800
By itself, it's meaningless.

05:30.800 --> 05:35.500
Let's apply this thinking to a comparative statement about different races,

05:35.500 --> 05:39.800
and you've probably come across this one online before.

05:39.800 --> 05:48.200
Now, I see this sort of thing all the time, and it's usually justifying a reported police bias against Black people or some such.

05:48.200 --> 05:50.800
So, is it a true statement?

05:50.800 --> 05:55.800
Well, again, by itself, it can't tell us anything. You know, we need the context.

05:55.800 --> 06:01.100
So, let's talk about this statement, and we'll see if we can't make it mean something.

06:01.100 --> 06:04.600
So, first off, we need a location.

06:04.600 --> 06:09.300
Where are we talking about here? Are we talking about worldwide or in a specific country?

06:09.300 --> 06:13.800
You know, to narrow it down a bit, we'll say America.

06:13.800 --> 06:19.300
In America, Black people are more likely to be criminals than white people.

06:19.300 --> 06:25.300
Now then, what does more likely mean, exactly? Are we speaking genetically?

06:25.300 --> 06:30.900
Outside of capital R, racist, KKK types, most people will say no.

06:30.900 --> 06:35.100
Not genetically, just statistically, for whatever reason.

06:35.100 --> 06:38.900
You know, cultural, social, economic, or whatever.

06:38.900 --> 06:44.300
And if we're talking statistically, we have to ask, where do these statistics come from?

06:44.300 --> 06:50.900
Because, of course, we don't have a perfect record of all the criminals out there, for what I hope are obvious reasons.

06:50.900 --> 06:57.100
It's usually data taken from the police and the court system, so we'll add this qualifier, too.

06:57.100 --> 07:01.900
And now, this raises a lot of questions about how that data is gathered,

07:01.900 --> 07:05.700
because there could be problems with the method of data collection.

07:05.700 --> 07:11.300
Let's imagine you're a new police chief in a city, and you're looking at statistics that say

07:11.300 --> 07:16.500
Black people are 20% more likely than white people to be criminals.

07:16.500 --> 07:23.300
Now, you have limited resources, and obviously you want to combat crime as effectively as you can,

07:23.300 --> 07:27.500
so you logically choose to disproportionately target Black people.

07:27.500 --> 07:32.900
You know, you're not racist, you're just spending your resources tackling crime

07:32.900 --> 07:35.900
where the statistics say it's more likely to be.

07:35.900 --> 07:37.500
Now, here's the problem with that.

07:37.500 --> 07:44.500
A year down the line, when you update the statistics, you'll see an increase in Black crime relative to white crime.

07:44.500 --> 07:50.700
The extra time and effort you spent chasing Black criminals meant that you caught more Black criminals,

07:50.700 --> 07:54.900
and the decreased focus on white criminals meant you caught fewer.

07:54.900 --> 08:00.300
And now you're looking at statistics that say Black people are 30% more likely to be criminals,

08:00.300 --> 08:02.700
and you end up in a spiral.

08:02.900 --> 08:05.700
You know, this is how you end up in situations like

08:05.700 --> 08:12.700
Black Americans being arrested for marijuana possession at a national rate which is around triple that of white people,

08:13.300 --> 08:17.900
despite Black people and white people actually smoking weed at similar rates.

08:18.300 --> 08:20.100
And that's just on the police end, you know.

08:20.100 --> 08:25.300
If we consider the court system, we're gonna have to add another qualifier to our statement,

08:25.300 --> 08:28.100
because the justice system isn't perfect, you know.

08:28.100 --> 08:32.900
Sometimes guilty people go free, and sometimes innocent people get convicted,

08:32.900 --> 08:38.300
and of course, Black people are more likely to be convicted of the same crimes than white people,

08:38.300 --> 08:43.300
and they receive harsher punishments than white people, and that has an effect on the stats too.

08:43.300 --> 08:48.100
So we'll say that Black people are more likely to be found to be criminals,

08:48.100 --> 08:52.900
because that's something that is actually measurable with a degree of confidence.

08:52.900 --> 08:55.100
And there's something else to be considered here.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.900
What is considered a crime changes over time.

08:58.900 --> 09:03.100
You know, certain things that were illegal become legal and vice versa,

09:03.100 --> 09:07.900
and some of those things can disproportionately affect different races.

09:07.900 --> 09:12.100
You know, for instance, what happens to that inflated number of Black people

09:12.100 --> 09:16.700
considered criminals for marijuana possession if marijuana possession gets legalized?

09:16.700 --> 09:20.500
Suddenly, you're looking at a completely different set of statistics.

09:20.500 --> 09:24.100
So you really need a time scale in there as well.

09:24.100 --> 09:27.300
And I'm sure there are other things we could talk about, like...

09:27.300 --> 09:31.700
consider one guy who's a banker who defrauds the country of millions.

09:31.700 --> 09:34.100
He only counts as one criminal.

09:34.100 --> 09:38.500
The same as a guy who gets busted for shoplifting counts as one criminal.

09:38.500 --> 09:42.300
And more realistically, the banker probably counts as no criminals,

09:42.300 --> 09:47.900
because he donates huge amounts of money to the people who get to decide if he's a criminal or not,

09:47.900 --> 09:51.100
but we're kinda getting off topic a bit there.

09:51.300 --> 09:54.500
So for the sake of sanity, we will take a break here.

09:54.500 --> 09:59.300
And if you haven't noticed by now, I really don't like statements like the first one,

09:59.300 --> 10:04.900
and I'm very keen on people giving the full context when they're talking about things like this.

10:04.900 --> 10:06.300
Why is that?

10:06.300 --> 10:12.100
Well, coming back to Jason Todd for a minute, he answers this in a comment, where he says,

10:12.100 --> 10:16.900
I apologize if the you-cannot-debate-this seemed harsh and assuming,

10:16.900 --> 10:22.700
but in my mind, it's near impossible to debate the validity of statistics that have proper citation.

10:22.700 --> 10:28.500
Maybe you mean arguing or making statements on the implications of such averages.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.900
And yet, that's pretty much it.

10:30.900 --> 10:36.300
You see, if you just say this, a lot of people are gonna start making assumptions,

10:36.300 --> 10:40.300
often genetic, racist assumptions.

10:40.500 --> 10:43.700
And of course, a lot of the times you do see a sentence like this,

10:43.700 --> 10:48.500
it's because the person saying it wants people to make those assumptions.

10:48.500 --> 10:52.500
You know, this statement isn't good enough by itself.

10:52.500 --> 10:58.700
And my opinion is the same for what we'll call the positive statements that Jason wrote in.

10:58.700 --> 11:05.300
On average, blacks make better basketball players, and on average, Asians score higher on the SAT.

11:05.300 --> 11:10.100
Because both of those things are only true in certain regards.

11:10.100 --> 11:15.300
You know, if we look at something like, on average, Asians score higher on the SAT,

11:15.300 --> 11:20.300
now, the assumption a lot of people will make there is that this means Asians are, on average,

11:20.300 --> 11:23.100
genetically smarter than black people.

11:23.100 --> 11:26.500
And that is a lazy and unscientific deduction,

11:26.500 --> 11:32.100
when there could be lots of other reasons behind why Asian people tend to score higher on the SAT.

11:32.100 --> 11:34.500
And let's think about a few of those.

11:34.500 --> 11:41.100
Now, first off, a huge predictor of your own academic success is your parents' academic success.

11:41.100 --> 11:44.300
And another is your parents' financial status.

11:44.300 --> 11:50.100
Now, it follows that richer, better educated parents have richer, better educated children.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.900
And now, here's the thing.

11:51.900 --> 11:59.500
A considerable amount of American black people alive today either remember having to go to segregated schools,

11:59.500 --> 12:03.500
or they are the children of people who went to segregated schools.

12:03.500 --> 12:11.100
You know, it really wasn't that long ago that black people legally had to go to worse, underfunded schools,

12:11.100 --> 12:13.900
and get a worse education than white people.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.500
It's not ancient history.

12:15.500 --> 12:19.700
That little girl in the Norman Rockwell painting, you know, she's still alive.

12:19.700 --> 12:24.100
She's a teacher, and she's not even that old, really. It's...

12:24.100 --> 12:31.700
You know, these sorts of things take a lot of generations to shrink to the point where they're statistically insignificant.

12:31.700 --> 12:38.300
Now, on the other hand, Asian people are comparatively much more likely to be college-educated,

12:38.300 --> 12:40.700
and there's a few reasons behind that.

12:40.700 --> 12:44.500
Now, it's going back a ways here, but there's a few things you could read up on,

12:44.500 --> 12:48.100
like the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882,

12:48.100 --> 12:51.700
the Immigration Act of 1924,

12:51.700 --> 12:53.700
the National Origins Act,

12:53.700 --> 12:56.300
the Asian Exclusion Act, and whatnot.

12:56.300 --> 13:00.300
But you can probably guess right now from the names that, for a long time,

13:00.300 --> 13:04.700
the US government didn't want Asian people coming to America.

13:04.700 --> 13:08.700
And these acts were all repealed around the time of the Second World War.

13:08.700 --> 13:12.900
Now, recent legal Asian immigration into the US is voluntary,

13:12.900 --> 13:19.300
and, of course, requires a certain skill set, or a certain amount of wealth, or both.

13:19.300 --> 13:22.100
And the population of China, for instance, is massive,

13:22.100 --> 13:27.100
and there's always relatively rich, educated people looking to move to the US.

13:27.300 --> 13:32.300
Now, the majority of recent Asian immigrants into the US have bachelor's degrees,

13:32.300 --> 13:39.700
and their children and grandchildren will grow up with relatively rich, college-educated parents.

13:39.700 --> 13:44.100
And they are the Asian people who are taking the SAT.

13:44.100 --> 13:47.700
You know, a bunch of impoverished North Korean farmers,

13:47.700 --> 13:51.100
they are not going to be taking the American SAT.

13:51.100 --> 13:53.900
And if they did, they would do shit.

13:53.900 --> 13:57.100
You see, this statement is just not enough by itself.

13:57.100 --> 14:00.900
It's technically correct in one regard, but to really understand it,

14:00.900 --> 14:04.700
you need to know the history and the context and all that good stuff.

14:04.700 --> 14:09.700
Now, one good point of comparison here is that young black children who are adopted

14:09.700 --> 14:13.700
tend to do better on tests than other non-adopted black kids.

14:13.700 --> 14:19.300
And that's because, to adopt a kid, you need to prove a certain level of financial security,

14:19.700 --> 14:24.500
safety, and stability that a lot of non-adopted kids don't have.

14:24.500 --> 14:28.900
Adopted kids are generally growing up in richer, safer households,

14:28.900 --> 14:32.700
and as a result, they do better in early academic tests.

14:32.700 --> 14:37.300
You see, if you change the circumstances, you get different results.

14:37.300 --> 14:41.900
However, we can only get so far looking at this scientifically,

14:41.900 --> 14:47.900
because we're missing a key part of the scientific process, and that's a control test.

14:47.900 --> 14:52.300
You know, we don't have another America that's free of racial bias,

14:52.300 --> 14:56.300
where all races are economically equal to compare to.

14:56.300 --> 14:59.500
We can't do the SATs over one year and say,

14:59.500 --> 15:04.100
okay, guys, this time we're gonna try it without a history of racial oppression

15:04.100 --> 15:08.300
and where everyone grew up in a financially secure, stable household.

15:08.300 --> 15:10.100
You know, it's just not possible.

15:10.100 --> 15:15.700
So, it's a bit irresponsible to be throwing out unscientific ideas like this one,

15:15.900 --> 15:20.300
just because they happen to be technically right in one regard.

15:20.300 --> 15:25.100
And I think there's a point to be made here about technically being right.

15:25.100 --> 15:27.100
People love being right.

15:27.100 --> 15:29.300
A little aside before I end the video.

15:29.300 --> 15:32.700
I remember a series of Richard Dawkins tweets

15:32.700 --> 15:38.900
where he was ranking how bad different types of rapes are and saying things like,

15:39.100 --> 15:41.300
Mild pedophilia is bad.

15:41.300 --> 15:44.300
Violent pedophilia is worse.

15:44.300 --> 15:45.900
Date rape is bad.

15:45.900 --> 15:49.500
Stranger rape at knife point is worse.

15:49.500 --> 15:52.700
And, like, I'll disagree with Richard Dawkins on that point,

15:52.700 --> 15:56.100
but even if he's right, and he might even be right,

15:56.100 --> 15:58.300
you know, shut up.

15:58.300 --> 16:00.300
Shut up, Richard Dawkins.

16:00.300 --> 16:03.700
Being right isn't an excuse for being a prick.

16:03.700 --> 16:08.500
I hope Richard Dawkins' wife never asked him if her ass looked fat in a dress.

16:08.500 --> 16:13.100
Actually, he just got divorced recently, so who knows, maybe she did.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.100
That's so unfair.

16:17.100 --> 16:20.100
So anyway, guys, thanks for watching.

16:20.100 --> 16:25.500
I know this is a bit of a weird, boring, talky video with not much going on,

16:25.500 --> 16:27.700
but, uh, let me know what you think.

16:27.700 --> 16:29.700
It's a little experiment.

16:29.700 --> 16:33.700
And, uh, thanks to Jason Todd, who, even though we disagree,

16:33.700 --> 16:38.500
you know, he was relatively nice about it, and he didn't call me any horrible names or anything,

16:38.500 --> 16:41.300
so that was a refreshing change.

16:41.300 --> 16:42.900
Thank you, Jason.

16:42.900 --> 16:45.900
Although, he did end his comment by saying,

16:45.900 --> 16:47.900
You gotta be careful with stuff like that.

16:47.900 --> 16:51.900
I'm sure you don't want alt-right storefronters flooding your videos.

16:51.900 --> 16:54.900
And that's just not true. I do want that.

16:54.900 --> 16:56.700
That sounds like it'd be funny.

16:56.700 --> 17:01.300
So, please share this video to a bunch of racist people.

17:01.300 --> 17:03.500
You have my blessing.

17:03.500 --> 17:04.500
To do that.
