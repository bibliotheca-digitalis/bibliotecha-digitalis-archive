1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
Hello there, and, as you can tell from the title, today we're gonna be talking about some heavy stuff.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,300
And, to be honest, I wasn't that sure if this was a good idea or not.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:17,600
I've been told that every time you talk about politics or religion, you cut your audience in half.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,900
But I've got a lot of opinions that I wanna talk about,

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,900
and I figured that it was better to cut my audience in half now, when it's tiny,

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,900
rather than six months down the line, when I've got five million subscribers.

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,200
You know, it just makes sense, mathematically.

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,700
So then, I got a comment recently on my video that I made about Leafy and Milo Stewart,

9
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,900
and it was left by a guy called Jason Todd, and he was taking issue with Milo's

10
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,400
All White People Are Racist comment.

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,200
Now, in the first part of his comment, he says,

12
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,100
You attempted to take a logical, middle-of-the-road stance here, but it's clear you have a bias.

13
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,700
He then gives the dictionary definition of the word racism.

14
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,500
Then he says that some people can grow up, uh, without subconscious biases.

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,500
Uh, quote,

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,400
Despite your belief that society at large is indoctrinating people to hold racist beliefs,

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,800
you seem to forget about the people who grow up in households where they are not raised with these subconscious beliefs.

18
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,600
Now, I disagree with that statement for a start,

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,600
because I don't think it's possible to have any sort of meaningful interaction with society in general,

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,700
and not come into contact with anything that might cause a subconscious bias.

21
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,400
You know, excluding people who were raised by wolves or in fallout shelters or something,

22
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,200
I'd say that we all have some level of racial bias.

23
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,100
However, I will concede it's hard to prove if a subconscious bias exists or not,

24
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:51,800
because it's subconscious, you know, by its nature, it's hard to detect.

25
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,400
And now, I personally wouldn't come out and say something like,

26
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,700
All white people are racist, even though I do understand the argument,

27
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:07,400
because, being white, I have the luxury of avoiding the more confrontational racial arguments, if I feel like it,

28
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,300
and I will gladly exercise my privilege in that regard.

29
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,500
But if I did have to say that all white people are racist,

30
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:20,100
I'd bury the lead and waffle a lot and lay a lot of groundwork beforehand,

31
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,900
and then that just makes the statement lose its shock value,

32
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,200
and that kinda negates the point of saying it in the first place.

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,500
You see, the argument to be had with the all white people are racist approach,

34
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,500
if we grant that the person saying it is arguing in good faith, anyway, is one of efficacy.

35
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,000
You know, on the one hand, racism is a powerful word,

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,100
and it does draw a lot of attention to an issue that needs a lot of attention.

37
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,600
But on the other hand, you are gonna get a lot of backlash saying something like that,

38
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,400
and is the increased attention worth the backlash?

39
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,400
It seems like, for everyone that sticks around to hear the explanation,

40
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,700
you're gonna have turned someone else off,

41
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,800
and, personally, I just can't judge if that's worth it or not.

42
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,700
You know, someone smarter than me can puzzle that one out.

43
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:13,000
So, let's move on to the second part of Jason Todd's comment, where he says, quote,

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,400
However, believing races are superior to one another, on average, in regards to certain things,

45
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:25,200
is perfectly reasonable, and it's fucking stupid to claim we're all perfectly equal in every way.

46
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,900
We aren't equal within our own race. How can we be equal across races?

47
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:37,400
So, first off, I don't think you'll find many people who'll say everyone is literally equal in every regard.

48
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,900
Usually, when people say all races are equal, they're talking about the possible range of potentialities,

49
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,800
you know, rather than meaning to be completely literal about it.

50
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,900
Jason then goes on to say,

51
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,600
So, let's debate this.

52
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,800
Uh, now, there's a few different lines of argument here,

53
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,500
and I'm gonna wander pretty far away from Jason's actual comments,

54
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,100
but I will come back to address them specifically at the end.

55
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:20,100
First up is context, and welcome to the wonderfully complicated world of statements

56
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,800
which are true in one regard, but not true in other regards.

57
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:32,200
And, as an example, let's first look at a simple statement which is hopefully free of any racial baggage.

58
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,200
Okay,

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,800
Well, free of context, that statement is neither true nor untrue.

60
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:50,200
If we're talking about domesticated dogs and cats, then yes, it's true that, on average, dogs are larger than cats.

61
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:56,900
And Jason quite rightly includes this, on average, qualifier in his statements about Black and Asian people.

62
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,600
Now, there are, of course, particularly small dogs and particularly large cats

63
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,100
which make the statement untrue in every instance.

64
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:10,900
And newborn dogs are often smaller than fully grown cats, but they're still dogs.

65
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:17,200
And even the words dog and cat need clarification, you know, a tiger is a cat, technically,

66
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,000
so cats are ultimately larger than dogs on an individual scale.

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,200
You know, what I'm getting at here is that, depending on the context, the statement can be read as true or untrue.

68
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,800
By itself, it's meaningless.

69
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,500
Let's apply this thinking to a comparative statement about different races,

70
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,800
and you've probably come across this one online before.

71
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:48,200
Now, I see this sort of thing all the time, and it's usually justifying a reported police bias against Black people or some such.

72
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,800
So, is it a true statement?

73
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Well, again, by itself, it can't tell us anything. You know, we need the context.

74
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,100
So, let's talk about this statement, and we'll see if we can't make it mean something.

75
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,600
So, first off, we need a location.

76
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,300
Where are we talking about here? Are we talking about worldwide or in a specific country?

77
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,800
You know, to narrow it down a bit, we'll say America.

78
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,300
In America, Black people are more likely to be criminals than white people.

79
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:25,300
Now then, what does more likely mean, exactly? Are we speaking genetically?

80
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,900
Outside of capital R, racist, KKK types, most people will say no.

81
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,100
Not genetically, just statistically, for whatever reason.

82
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,900
You know, cultural, social, economic, or whatever.

83
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:44,300
And if we're talking statistically, we have to ask, where do these statistics come from?

84
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:50,900
Because, of course, we don't have a perfect record of all the criminals out there, for what I hope are obvious reasons.

85
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:57,100
It's usually data taken from the police and the court system, so we'll add this qualifier, too.

86
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,900
And now, this raises a lot of questions about how that data is gathered,

87
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,700
because there could be problems with the method of data collection.

88
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:11,300
Let's imagine you're a new police chief in a city, and you're looking at statistics that say

89
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:16,500
Black people are 20% more likely than white people to be criminals.

90
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:23,300
Now, you have limited resources, and obviously you want to combat crime as effectively as you can,

91
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,500
so you logically choose to disproportionately target Black people.

92
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,900
You know, you're not racist, you're just spending your resources tackling crime

93
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,900
where the statistics say it's more likely to be.

94
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,500
Now, here's the problem with that.

95
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:44,500
A year down the line, when you update the statistics, you'll see an increase in Black crime relative to white crime.

96
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:50,700
The extra time and effort you spent chasing Black criminals meant that you caught more Black criminals,

97
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,900
and the decreased focus on white criminals meant you caught fewer.

98
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:00,300
And now you're looking at statistics that say Black people are 30% more likely to be criminals,

99
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,700
and you end up in a spiral.

100
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,700
You know, this is how you end up in situations like

101
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:12,700
Black Americans being arrested for marijuana possession at a national rate which is around triple that of white people,

102
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,900
despite Black people and white people actually smoking weed at similar rates.

103
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,100
And that's just on the police end, you know.

104
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:25,300
If we consider the court system, we're gonna have to add another qualifier to our statement,

105
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,100
because the justice system isn't perfect, you know.

106
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,900
Sometimes guilty people go free, and sometimes innocent people get convicted,

107
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:38,300
and of course, Black people are more likely to be convicted of the same crimes than white people,

108
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:43,300
and they receive harsher punishments than white people, and that has an effect on the stats too.

109
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:48,100
So we'll say that Black people are more likely to be found to be criminals,

110
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,900
because that's something that is actually measurable with a degree of confidence.

111
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,100
And there's something else to be considered here.

112
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,900
What is considered a crime changes over time.

113
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,100
You know, certain things that were illegal become legal and vice versa,

114
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,900
and some of those things can disproportionately affect different races.

115
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:12,100
You know, for instance, what happens to that inflated number of Black people

116
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,700
considered criminals for marijuana possession if marijuana possession gets legalized?

117
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,500
Suddenly, you're looking at a completely different set of statistics.

118
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,100
So you really need a time scale in there as well.

119
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,300
And I'm sure there are other things we could talk about, like...

120
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,700
consider one guy who's a banker who defrauds the country of millions.

121
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,100
He only counts as one criminal.

122
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,500
The same as a guy who gets busted for shoplifting counts as one criminal.

123
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,300
And more realistically, the banker probably counts as no criminals,

124
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,900
because he donates huge amounts of money to the people who get to decide if he's a criminal or not,

125
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,100
but we're kinda getting off topic a bit there.

126
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,500
So for the sake of sanity, we will take a break here.

127
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,300
And if you haven't noticed by now, I really don't like statements like the first one,

128
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,900
and I'm very keen on people giving the full context when they're talking about things like this.

129
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,300
Why is that?

130
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:12,100
Well, coming back to Jason Todd for a minute, he answers this in a comment, where he says,

131
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,900
I apologize if the you-cannot-debate-this seemed harsh and assuming,

132
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:22,700
but in my mind, it's near impossible to debate the validity of statistics that have proper citation.

133
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:28,500
Maybe you mean arguing or making statements on the implications of such averages.

134
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,900
And yet, that's pretty much it.

135
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:36,300
You see, if you just say this, a lot of people are gonna start making assumptions,

136
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,300
often genetic, racist assumptions.

137
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,700
And of course, a lot of the times you do see a sentence like this,

138
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:48,500
it's because the person saying it wants people to make those assumptions.

139
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,500
You know, this statement isn't good enough by itself.

140
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:58,700
And my opinion is the same for what we'll call the positive statements that Jason wrote in.

141
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:05,300
On average, blacks make better basketball players, and on average, Asians score higher on the SAT.

142
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:10,100
Because both of those things are only true in certain regards.

143
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,300
You know, if we look at something like, on average, Asians score higher on the SAT,

144
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,300
now, the assumption a lot of people will make there is that this means Asians are, on average,

145
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,100
genetically smarter than black people.

146
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,500
And that is a lazy and unscientific deduction,

147
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:32,100
when there could be lots of other reasons behind why Asian people tend to score higher on the SAT.

148
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,500
And let's think about a few of those.

149
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:41,100
Now, first off, a huge predictor of your own academic success is your parents' academic success.

150
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,300
And another is your parents' financial status.

151
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:50,100
Now, it follows that richer, better educated parents have richer, better educated children.

152
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,900
And now, here's the thing.

153
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:59,500
A considerable amount of American black people alive today either remember having to go to segregated schools,

154
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,500
or they are the children of people who went to segregated schools.

155
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:11,100
You know, it really wasn't that long ago that black people legally had to go to worse, underfunded schools,

156
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,900
and get a worse education than white people.

157
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,500
It's not ancient history.

158
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,700
That little girl in the Norman Rockwell painting, you know, she's still alive.

159
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:24,100
She's a teacher, and she's not even that old, really. It's...

160
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:31,700
You know, these sorts of things take a lot of generations to shrink to the point where they're statistically insignificant.

161
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:38,300
Now, on the other hand, Asian people are comparatively much more likely to be college-educated,

162
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,700
and there's a few reasons behind that.

163
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,500
Now, it's going back a ways here, but there's a few things you could read up on,

164
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,100
like the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882,

165
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,700
the Immigration Act of 1924,

166
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,700
the National Origins Act,

167
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,300
the Asian Exclusion Act, and whatnot.

168
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,300
But you can probably guess right now from the names that, for a long time,

169
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,700
the US government didn't want Asian people coming to America.

170
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,700
And these acts were all repealed around the time of the Second World War.

171
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,900
Now, recent legal Asian immigration into the US is voluntary,

172
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:19,300
and, of course, requires a certain skill set, or a certain amount of wealth, or both.

173
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,100
And the population of China, for instance, is massive,

174
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:27,100
and there's always relatively rich, educated people looking to move to the US.

175
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,300
Now, the majority of recent Asian immigrants into the US have bachelor's degrees,

176
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:39,700
and their children and grandchildren will grow up with relatively rich, college-educated parents.

177
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:44,100
And they are the Asian people who are taking the SAT.

178
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,700
You know, a bunch of impoverished North Korean farmers,

179
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,100
they are not going to be taking the American SAT.

180
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,900
And if they did, they would do shit.

181
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,100
You see, this statement is just not enough by itself.

182
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,900
It's technically correct in one regard, but to really understand it,

183
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,700
you need to know the history and the context and all that good stuff.

184
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:09,700
Now, one good point of comparison here is that young black children who are adopted

185
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,700
tend to do better on tests than other non-adopted black kids.

186
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:19,300
And that's because, to adopt a kid, you need to prove a certain level of financial security,

187
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,500
safety, and stability that a lot of non-adopted kids don't have.

188
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,900
Adopted kids are generally growing up in richer, safer households,

189
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,700
and as a result, they do better in early academic tests.

190
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,300
You see, if you change the circumstances, you get different results.

191
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,900
However, we can only get so far looking at this scientifically,

192
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:47,900
because we're missing a key part of the scientific process, and that's a control test.

193
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,300
You know, we don't have another America that's free of racial bias,

194
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,300
where all races are economically equal to compare to.

195
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,500
We can't do the SATs over one year and say,

196
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,100
okay, guys, this time we're gonna try it without a history of racial oppression

197
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,300
and where everyone grew up in a financially secure, stable household.

198
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,100
You know, it's just not possible.

199
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:15,700
So, it's a bit irresponsible to be throwing out unscientific ideas like this one,

200
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:20,300
just because they happen to be technically right in one regard.

201
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:25,100
And I think there's a point to be made here about technically being right.

202
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,100
People love being right.

203
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,300
A little aside before I end the video.

204
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,700
I remember a series of Richard Dawkins tweets

205
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:38,900
where he was ranking how bad different types of rapes are and saying things like,

206
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,300
Mild pedophilia is bad.

207
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,300
Violent pedophilia is worse.

208
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,900
Date rape is bad.

209
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,500
Stranger rape at knife point is worse.

210
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,700
And, like, I'll disagree with Richard Dawkins on that point,

211
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,100
but even if he's right, and he might even be right,

212
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,300
you know, shut up.

213
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,300
Shut up, Richard Dawkins.

214
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,700
Being right isn't an excuse for being a prick.

215
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,500
I hope Richard Dawkins' wife never asked him if her ass looked fat in a dress.

216
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,100
Actually, he just got divorced recently, so who knows, maybe she did.

217
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,100
That's so unfair.

218
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,100
So anyway, guys, thanks for watching.

219
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:25,500
I know this is a bit of a weird, boring, talky video with not much going on,

220
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,700
but, uh, let me know what you think.

221
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,700
It's a little experiment.

222
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,700
And, uh, thanks to Jason Todd, who, even though we disagree,

223
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:38,500
you know, he was relatively nice about it, and he didn't call me any horrible names or anything,

224
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,300
so that was a refreshing change.

225
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,900
Thank you, Jason.

226
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,900
Although, he did end his comment by saying,

227
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,900
You gotta be careful with stuff like that.

228
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,900
I'm sure you don't want alt-right storefronters flooding your videos.

229
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,900
And that's just not true. I do want that.

230
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,700
That sounds like it'd be funny.

231
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,300
So, please share this video to a bunch of racist people.

232
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,500
You have my blessing.

233
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
To do that.
