00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to take a look at a video from a YouTuber by the name of Roaming Millennial,

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,300
entitled, People of Color, You Are Not Oppressed.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,300
And wouldn't that be nice?

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:18,000
That's right, new subscribers from the Cuphead video. I usually talk about politics, and history, and all that boring stuff.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I feel the need to apologize here.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,500
Okay, so for everyone else who is still with us, who is Roaming Millennial?

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,500
Well, she's one of the YouTubers in the, I'm not a racist, but, vein.

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:39,500
You know, so she's not a racist, okay, acknowledged she's not a racist, but she's got a few questions, you know.

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,500
So I'm gonna do my good deed for the day here, and provide the answers to those questions.

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,500
Just one YouTuber helping another YouTuber out.

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,500
So what is Roaming Millennial's video about?

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,500
Well, I would encourage you to watch the whole thing, and I'll put a link in the description.

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,500
But I'll show a couple of short clips here, just to get us started off.

14
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:05,500
So in this video, in the hopes of healing this headache of imaginary oppression that is going around the social justice sphere,

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,500
we're gonna be talking all about oppression.

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,500
What it means to be oppressed, and how in the United States, and in the rest of the Western world,

17
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,500
no, people of color, you are not oppressed.

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,500
So to start, let's go over the definition of oppression.

19
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,500
And yes, I know this is super super basic, but after hearing those students protest,

20
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,500
I really do feel that cracking a dictionary open is necessary.

21
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,500
So the definition of oppression is really quite simply prolonged cruel or unjust treatment or control.

22
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,500
Now with this definition, I think it is perfectly clear to say that in the past, people of color,

23
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,500
and more specifically, African American people, were oppressed by societies in the United States, and the West in general.

24
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,500
I'm not gonna argue against that.

25
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,500
However, the issue here is that these Evergreen students and so many social justice warriors out there

26
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,500
are not just arguing for the idea of past oppression, but for current and ongoing oppression.

27
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,500
And really, that is just a completely inaccurate analysis of the world that we live in.

28
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,500
Obviously, in the United States, there are no legal rights that a white person possesses that a non-white person does not,

29
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,500
and there are no laws on the books that reference an individual's race in any way, right?

30
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,500
I mean, our legal system, our entire system of government is not one that is racially coded.

31
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,500
Okay, so here's the main thrust of Roaming Millennial's argument.

32
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:19,500
Oppression may have happened in the past, and that's good, she concedes that much at least,

33
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,500
but today, we have legal equality, so that means oppression is not happening at all.

34
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,500
Now the first mistake she's made here is a rather basic one, and it's one you see a lot online.

35
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,500
Roaming Millennial is only considering legality.

36
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:38,500
She showed the dictionary definition of oppression, prolonged cruel or unjust treatment or control,

37
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,500
but appears to have misread it. Legal rights are not mentioned here.

38
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,500
Oppression can still happen even with an illegal system that is, on paper, completely equal and just,

39
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,500
because the system isn't perfect, of course.

40
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,500
It's made up of individuals or with their own beliefs and biases,

41
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,500
and the sum of those beliefs and biases can add up to a system that appears fair on the surface,

42
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,500
but delivers unfair results.

43
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,500
But we'll look back around to this in a second.

44
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,500
For now, let's watch the next part of Roaming Millennial's argument,

45
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,500
where she attempts to address these unfair results.

46
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,500
And while, in my opinion, equal standing in the eyes of the law and equal standing before government

47
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,500
is a pretty clear indication that oppression is not happening,

48
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,500
some critics might say, no, what are you talking about? There's no equal standing.

49
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,500
There are huge racial disparities when it comes to the legal system, especially the criminal justice system.

50
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,500
Just look at how much more likely black people are to be incarcerated than Hispanic or white people.

51
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,500
I mean, obviously, that's the result of oppression.

52
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Okay, so to answer the question of oppression in relation to the criminal justice system,

53
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,500
which comes up a lot, we first need to return to our definition of oppression.

54
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,500
To repeat once more, oppression is prolonged, cruel, or unjust treatment or control.

55
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,500
So what this definition means for our discussion here is that black people being more likely to be incarcerated

56
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,500
is not evidence in and of itself to prove that they are oppressed.

57
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,500
Oppression refers specifically to unjust treatment or unjust punishment.

58
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:08,500
So for oppression to be happening, black people would need to be incarcerated unjustly at a higher rate than other races, right?

59
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:15,500
Because it wouldn't be oppression if these people were being justly arrested and prosecuted for crimes that they actually did commit.

60
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:21,500
So while many social justice activists try to paint the large black prison populations in the US as evidence of oppression,

61
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,500
the fact is that black people are more likely to commit crimes than other races.

62
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:32,500
So with this being the case, it is not unjust and therefore not oppressive for the racial makeup of prison populations

63
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,500
to be representative of the racial makeup of people who commit crimes.

64
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:42,500
The question here isn't, are there proportionately more black people in prison than white people, because obviously that's the case.

65
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:49,500
The question is, why? Is it because prejudice causes more black people than white people to be convicted of crimes that they did not commit?

66
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Or is it because, on average, a black person is more likely to commit a crime than a white person

67
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
and therefore more likely to go to jail for what they've done?

68
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
Statistics would indicate the latter.

69
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,500
Statistics would indicate the latter, apparently. Well, we'll see.

70
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,500
Now then, Roaming Millennial makes several errors in this section.

71
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Some are errors of mathematics, some errors of omission, and a couple of contradictions of logic there, too.

72
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,500
I don't know where to start, really, to be honest.

73
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,500
But how about we start with this statement of Roaming Millennials?

74
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,500
For oppression to be happening, black people would need to be incarcerated unjustly.

75
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,500
You see, her point here is that black people are more likely to commit crimes than other races,

76
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,500
so it makes sense for them to be a larger percentage of the prison population.

77
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:40,500
So first of all here, what she does not examine, possibly on purpose, is whether or not these percentages match up.

78
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,500
Because that's important. And I'll give you two scenarios here.

79
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,500
So, Scenario 1.

80
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,500
Let's say one group of people are 10% more likely to commit crimes than other groups of people,

81
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,500
and also make up 10% extra of the prison population.

82
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,500
Now that's what you'd expect in a fair system.

83
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,500
At least without factoring wider society into our little example here, anyway.

84
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,500
Now, Scenario 2.

85
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,500
One race of people are 10% more likely to commit crimes than other races,

86
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,500
but make up 30% extra of the prison population.

87
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,500
Now that's unfair and unjust treatment,

88
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,500
even accounting for that hypothetical group's higher relative criminality.

89
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Do you understand?

90
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,500
So, returning to reality,

91
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:30,500
which of our little scenarios there more accurately reflects the criminal justice system in the United States?

92
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,500
Well, one way to answer this question is to look not at how certain groups are treated within the system,

93
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,500
but how individuals belonging to those groups are treated.

94
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,500
So let's do that.

95
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,500
And here's a study from 2013 from the Yale Law Journal entitled

96
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:50,500
mandatory sentencing and racial disparity, assessing the role of prosecutors and the effects of Booker.

97
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,500
And I'd like to read you a few lines from their conclusion.

98
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,500
After controlling for the arrest offense, criminal history, and other prior characteristics,

99
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:22,500
sentences for black male arrestees diverge substantially from those of white male arrestees by about 10% on average.

100
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,500
While this disparity does not seem to be growing, it is persistent.

101
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
So, did you like that study?

102
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Because here's another.

103
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,500
This is a United States Sentencing Commission report entitled

104
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:39,500
Report on Continuing Impact of United States v. Booker on Federal Sentencing.

105
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,500
And what did that find?

106
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,500
The Commission's updated multivariate regression analysis showed, among other outcomes,

107
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:51,500
that black male offenders have continued to receive longer sentences than similarly situated white male offenders.

108
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
And how much longer were their sentences?

109
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
This is from later in the report.

110
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:03,500
For example, sentence length for black male offenders exceeded sentence length for white male offenders by 19.5%.

111
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:09,500
And I should note here that I found both of these reports in an article responding to Roaming Millennial on pafios.com,

112
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
which I will link in the description.

113
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,500
So that's fairly clear-cut there, I think.

114
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:21,500
On an individual level, controlling for all the factors except race, black men still get longer sentences than white men.

115
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,500
And because they get longer sentences than white men, they will, on average, be in prison for longer,

116
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:33,500
and therefore at least some part of their overrepresentation in the prison system is accounted for by this unfair sentencing.

117
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Any argument for this to be fair that mentions black people's increased relative likelihood of being criminals

118
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:47,500
would have to therefore argue that individual black people deserve longer individual sentences relative to other races.

119
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:53,500
And this is without considering that the very metric we're using to declare black people's increased relative criminality

120
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:59,500
is frequent of occurrence in the criminal justice system, which we've just proven is biased against them.

121
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,500
And it's not just on the prosecution end that black people get screwed over.

122
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:12,500
One fact I like to bring up here is that black people are several times more likely than white people to be arrested for marijuana possession,

123
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,500
even though black people and white people smoke weed at similar rates.

124
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:25,500
It's all well and good to have a fair and just system on paper, but that doesn't mean the system necessarily delivers fair and just results.

125
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:33,500
For oppression to be happening, black people would need to be incarcerated unjustly, said Roaming Millennial, and she's correct.

126
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:38,500
They are, so therefore it is, if you follow.

127
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:47,500
So, to move on here, Roaming Millennial there mentions the black crime rate as justification for a relatively high incarceration rate compared with other races.

128
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,500
And I'd like to ask a question here.

129
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,500
What would Roaming Millennial argue is the cause of that higher crime rate?

130
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
And there's only two answers, really.

131
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:04,500
There's the genetic-slash-racist argument, you know, black people are inherently by birth more likely to be criminals.

132
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:11,500
And there's the societal argument, you know, the disparity is explained by a combination of cultural and socioeconomic factors,

133
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,500
alongside the aforementioned bias in the justice system.

134
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:24,500
And as a little aside here, one annoying thing you tend to see online is someone who secretly favors the genetic argument, but fears saying it out loud.

135
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:32,500
So they just dismiss the societal factors one by one as being irrelevant, without ever actually committing to the genetic argument.

136
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,500
And that can be a little irksome.

137
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,500
Anyway, which argument does Roaming Millennial put forward?

138
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,500
And I'll read a couple of Twitter conversations here.

139
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,500
Roaming Millennial says,

140
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,500
Minority communities on average have more crime than mixed or majority white communities.

141
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,500
That leads to increased cop encounters.

142
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,500
And a Twitter user called Flying Volvo says,

143
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,500
Really makes you think about what causes it, doesn't it?

144
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:01,500
Almost like there's some underlying causes of crime in African-American communities.

145
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
To which Roaming Millennial responds,

146
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,500
Poverty and culture.

147
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,500
So it appears here that Roaming Millennial favors the socioeconomic argument.

148
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:19,500
You know, poverty is linked with crime, after all, and increased poverty in predominantly African-American areas would explain the disparity in the crime statistics.

149
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:26,500
However, with regards to our oppression argument here, we necessarily have to consider the causes of that poverty.

150
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:35,500
Because it's entirely possible that the poverty argument is simply the genetic argument again, but one step removed from what will get you banned off Twitter.

151
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:46,500
If the poverty's causes are unexamined, an audience might assume that black people are genetically more likely to be in poverty due to possessing some inherent poverty-related characteristics.

152
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,500
And therefore, by proxy, more likely to be criminals.

153
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,500
Now we know that Roaming Millennial has previously stated that oppression existed in the past.

154
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,500
So the question here is, could that past oppression have contributed to creating the current poverty?

155
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:08,500
So I guess we have to ask, how far in the past is Roaming Millennial talking when she says oppression existed?

156
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,500
And returning to Twitter again, a Twitter user called hiphoppersknowledge said,

157
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:19,500
My parents weren't even allowed to drink from water fountains in public, you dumb fuck.

158
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
To which Roaming Millennial responds,

159
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:40,500
Now this exchange indicates that Roaming Millennial considers the Jim Crow laws that enforced racial segregation in the United States to be examples of institutionalized racism and oppression.

160
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,500
Very good. I'm with her on that.

161
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,500
Now these laws were in place until the mid-1960s.

162
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:57,500
So, from the Declaration of Independence, up until roughly 50 years ago, according to Roaming Millennial, there was institutionalized racism and oppression in the United States.

163
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:09,500
So, accepting that, it would be very bizarre indeed to then go on to claim that such a long period of racism and oppression would have zero effects whatever on current society.

164
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:18,500
You know, if you enslave a given race of people and prevent education and break up families and confiscate all their belongings and deny them the vote,

165
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:27,500
and then subject them to a post-slavery period where for generations they're forbidden by law from attending the best schools and all the other rights afforded the majority,

166
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,500
all these things have lasting effects.

167
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:36,500
Black people in poverty in the United States are in a poverty that was in part created by this history of oppression.

168
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,500
And that's unfair and unjust, isn't it?

169
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:46,500
And as a brief side note about culture here, which Roaming Millennial cites as another reason for the crime rate disparity,

170
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,500
one particular culture is only one side of the coin.

171
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,500
We also have to consider how that culture is perceived on the outside.

172
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,500
Now an individual black person might be subject to discrimination based on that perception.

173
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,500
And any one average individual has a minimal effect on that culture as a whole.

174
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,500
People can't always choose how they're perceived.

175
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:14,500
You know, you can criticize a culture as a whole, but you can't hand-wave away longer prison sentences for individual black people because of it.

176
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,500
That's unfair and unjust.

177
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:22,500
Let's take a look at another argument of Roaming Millennials now, the Asian-American argument.

178
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,500
And something that I'd like to mention which really debunks the idea that non-white people in the US are oppressed

179
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:35,500
is the fact that there are non-white groups out there who on average do better than their white counterparts in terms of education and finances.

180
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
And yes, felony charges too.

181
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:46,500
So then, people of color can't be oppressed because Asian-Americans on average are better educated and have a higher average income than white Americans.

182
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:53,500
Now, does this therefore prove that oppression is now a thing of the past and has no bearing at all on modern society?

183
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,500
Well, I would argue quite the opposite.

184
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,500
In fact, a larger percentage of Asian-Americans being educated and having a higher average income

185
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,500
stems directly from discrimination against Asian people.

186
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:10,500
And stick with me now, it's kind of a counter-intuitive oneness, I understand.

187
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:17,500
You know, how can discrimination against a group lead to them being, on average, better off down the line?

188
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,500
And another question here before I answer that one.

189
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:28,500
In the graph of average household incomes that Roaming Millennial showed, why doesn't the Asian data go back as far as the others?

190
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,500
And these answers are linked, as you'll see.

191
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:37,500
So I'm gonna throw a few data points your way now, and we'll see if we can later draw some conclusions from them.

192
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:43,500
So first of all, in 1960, the Asian population of the United States was less than 1 million.

193
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,500
They comprised around half of 1% of the population.

194
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:54,500
And this is compared to there being over 18 million black people in 1960, to give you a sense of the scale there.

195
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:01,500
Today, there are around 20 million Asian-Americans, so why were there so few, relatively, in 1960?

196
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,500
And why are there, comparatively, so many more today?

197
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Point number two.

198
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:14,500
In 1882, the United States Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act prohibiting Chinese immigration into the United States

199
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:23,500
and making the Chinese migrants present in the United States at the time permanent aliens by excluding them from the possibility of US citizenship.

200
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
Point number three.

201
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:34,500
The Immigration Act of 1917, also known as the Asiatic Barred Zone Act, barred immigration from large parts of Asia completely.

202
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,500
Point number four.

203
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:43,500
The Immigration Act of 1924, including the Asian Exclusion Act, but not to be confused with the Chinese Exclusion Act,

204
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:50,500
imposed strict quotas on how many people of a particular nationality could be resident in the United States at the time,

205
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,500
and barred completely everyone who was ineligible to become a United States citizen.

206
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:02,500
Fifth, and finally here, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965,

207
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:08,500
which removed the racial and national barriers that were previously in place, which restricted immigration from Asia.

208
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:15,500
So then, why in 1960 were there a relatively small number of Asian people in the United States?

209
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:21,500
And that's because immigration from Asia was massively restricted by a series of discriminatory laws.

210
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:27,500
And then after those restrictions were lifted, immigration from Asia skyrocketed. Relatively, anyway.

211
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:33,500
Now, the vast majority of Asian-American population growth in recent decades has been due to immigration.

212
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,500
So then, we need to ask, who can move to a different country?

213
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:44,500
And primarily of importance to us here is people who can afford to move to a different country.

214
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:50,500
And this is particularly true of a country very far away with which you do not share a land border.

215
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,500
You know, the average Chinese laborer cannot say,

216
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:59,500
oh, I'm not feeling this really, I think I'll just move to America and buy a house and go to college.

217
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,500
You know, you see my point here.

218
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:10,500
The United States is not seeing an accurate representative economic cross-section of people from those Asian countries that immigrants are arriving from.

219
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:17,500
The immigrants are those that can afford to move and afford to pay for college, and this is reflected in the average income statistics.

220
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:25,500
The disparity in average incomes present in the United States today is rooted in the history of these discriminatory laws.

221
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:31,500
For a comparative example, imagine transplanting all the African-Americans in the United States outside it,

222
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,500
and then only allowing back in those that had the resources to make the move.

223
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:42,500
And if you did that, the average household income for African-Americans in the United States would increase dramatically.

224
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:49,500
Not because they're actually any richer, remember, but simply because you'd be excluding all the poor people.

225
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,500
I mean, poverty obviously still exists in Asia, doesn't it?

226
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500
Anyway, let's wrap up here.

227
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,500
I feel like I've pitched enough answers to Roaming Millennial there for her to think about for one day.

228
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,500
Now, this is a video I would actually like to see a response to.

229
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:09,500
I want to know what Roaming Millennial or her fans think about what I've said and how they would answer me.

230
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:15,500
You know, I anticipate getting a fair amount of insults here, obviously, but I want to see arguments.

231
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,500
You know, if you think I'm wrong, try and prove me wrong.

232
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,500
If you think the studies I referenced came to incorrect conclusions, prove it.

233
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
You know, the ball's in your court.

234
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,500
I'm eager for responses here since I feel like the right are just chasing their tails on this issue,

235
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,500
and I want to try and move the conversation on.

236
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

237
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,500
Do you have a particular video or topic you'd like me to take a look at?

238
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,500
You can send me it over on Curious Cat, and I'll take a peek.

239
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,500
I have enough projects to last for months here, but occasionally something will jump the queue

240
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,500
if I think it's a particularly good fit for a video.

241
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:56,500
Thanks, as always, to my supporters over on Patreon who are not scrolling by right now.

242
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:01,500
The credits finally got silly enough for me to drop them in the form they were in, anyway.

243
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:07,500
But don't worry, credits fans. Tune in next time for the return of the credits.
