00:00.000 --> 00:05.800
Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to take a look at a video from a YouTuber by the name of Roaming Millennial,

00:05.800 --> 00:09.300
entitled, People of Color, You Are Not Oppressed.

00:09.300 --> 00:11.300
And wouldn't that be nice?

00:11.300 --> 00:18.000
That's right, new subscribers from the Cuphead video. I usually talk about politics, and history, and all that boring stuff.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
I feel the need to apologize here.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.500
Okay, so for everyone else who is still with us, who is Roaming Millennial?

00:25.500 --> 00:30.500
Well, she's one of the YouTubers in the, I'm not a racist, but, vein.

00:30.500 --> 00:39.500
You know, so she's not a racist, okay, acknowledged she's not a racist, but she's got a few questions, you know.

00:39.500 --> 00:44.500
So I'm gonna do my good deed for the day here, and provide the answers to those questions.

00:44.500 --> 00:48.500
Just one YouTuber helping another YouTuber out.

00:48.500 --> 00:51.500
So what is Roaming Millennial's video about?

00:51.500 --> 00:55.500
Well, I would encourage you to watch the whole thing, and I'll put a link in the description.

00:55.500 --> 00:59.500
But I'll show a couple of short clips here, just to get us started off.

00:59.500 --> 01:05.500
So in this video, in the hopes of healing this headache of imaginary oppression that is going around the social justice sphere,

01:05.500 --> 01:07.500
we're gonna be talking all about oppression.

01:07.500 --> 01:11.500
What it means to be oppressed, and how in the United States, and in the rest of the Western world,

01:11.500 --> 01:13.500
no, people of color, you are not oppressed.

01:13.500 --> 01:16.500
So to start, let's go over the definition of oppression.

01:16.500 --> 01:21.500
And yes, I know this is super super basic, but after hearing those students protest,

01:21.500 --> 01:25.500
I really do feel that cracking a dictionary open is necessary.

01:25.500 --> 01:30.500
So the definition of oppression is really quite simply prolonged cruel or unjust treatment or control.

01:30.500 --> 01:34.500
Now with this definition, I think it is perfectly clear to say that in the past, people of color,

01:34.500 --> 01:40.500
and more specifically, African American people, were oppressed by societies in the United States, and the West in general.

01:40.500 --> 01:41.500
I'm not gonna argue against that.

01:41.500 --> 01:46.500
However, the issue here is that these Evergreen students and so many social justice warriors out there

01:46.500 --> 01:51.500
are not just arguing for the idea of past oppression, but for current and ongoing oppression.

01:51.500 --> 01:55.500
And really, that is just a completely inaccurate analysis of the world that we live in.

01:55.500 --> 02:00.500
Obviously, in the United States, there are no legal rights that a white person possesses that a non-white person does not,

02:00.500 --> 02:04.500
and there are no laws on the books that reference an individual's race in any way, right?

02:04.500 --> 02:09.500
I mean, our legal system, our entire system of government is not one that is racially coded.

02:09.500 --> 02:13.500
Okay, so here's the main thrust of Roaming Millennial's argument.

02:13.500 --> 02:19.500
Oppression may have happened in the past, and that's good, she concedes that much at least,

02:19.500 --> 02:25.500
but today, we have legal equality, so that means oppression is not happening at all.

02:25.500 --> 02:30.500
Now the first mistake she's made here is a rather basic one, and it's one you see a lot online.

02:30.500 --> 02:33.500
Roaming Millennial is only considering legality.

02:33.500 --> 02:38.500
She showed the dictionary definition of oppression, prolonged cruel or unjust treatment or control,

02:38.500 --> 02:43.500
but appears to have misread it. Legal rights are not mentioned here.

02:43.500 --> 02:49.500
Oppression can still happen even with an illegal system that is, on paper, completely equal and just,

02:49.500 --> 02:52.500
because the system isn't perfect, of course.

02:52.500 --> 02:55.500
It's made up of individuals or with their own beliefs and biases,

02:55.500 --> 03:00.500
and the sum of those beliefs and biases can add up to a system that appears fair on the surface,

03:00.500 --> 03:02.500
but delivers unfair results.

03:02.500 --> 03:05.500
But we'll look back around to this in a second.

03:05.500 --> 03:08.500
For now, let's watch the next part of Roaming Millennial's argument,

03:08.500 --> 03:11.500
where she attempts to address these unfair results.

03:11.500 --> 03:15.500
And while, in my opinion, equal standing in the eyes of the law and equal standing before government

03:15.500 --> 03:18.500
is a pretty clear indication that oppression is not happening,

03:18.500 --> 03:22.500
some critics might say, no, what are you talking about? There's no equal standing.

03:22.500 --> 03:27.500
There are huge racial disparities when it comes to the legal system, especially the criminal justice system.

03:27.500 --> 03:31.500
Just look at how much more likely black people are to be incarcerated than Hispanic or white people.

03:31.500 --> 03:34.500
I mean, obviously, that's the result of oppression.

03:34.500 --> 03:38.500
Okay, so to answer the question of oppression in relation to the criminal justice system,

03:38.500 --> 03:43.500
which comes up a lot, we first need to return to our definition of oppression.

03:43.500 --> 03:48.500
To repeat once more, oppression is prolonged, cruel, or unjust treatment or control.

03:48.500 --> 03:53.500
So what this definition means for our discussion here is that black people being more likely to be incarcerated

03:53.500 --> 03:57.500
is not evidence in and of itself to prove that they are oppressed.

03:57.500 --> 04:01.500
Oppression refers specifically to unjust treatment or unjust punishment.

04:01.500 --> 04:08.500
So for oppression to be happening, black people would need to be incarcerated unjustly at a higher rate than other races, right?

04:08.500 --> 04:15.500
Because it wouldn't be oppression if these people were being justly arrested and prosecuted for crimes that they actually did commit.

04:15.500 --> 04:21.500
So while many social justice activists try to paint the large black prison populations in the US as evidence of oppression,

04:21.500 --> 04:26.500
the fact is that black people are more likely to commit crimes than other races.

04:26.500 --> 04:32.500
So with this being the case, it is not unjust and therefore not oppressive for the racial makeup of prison populations

04:32.500 --> 04:36.500
to be representative of the racial makeup of people who commit crimes.

04:36.500 --> 04:42.500
The question here isn't, are there proportionately more black people in prison than white people, because obviously that's the case.

04:42.500 --> 04:49.500
The question is, why? Is it because prejudice causes more black people than white people to be convicted of crimes that they did not commit?

04:49.500 --> 04:53.500
Or is it because, on average, a black person is more likely to commit a crime than a white person

04:53.500 --> 04:55.500
and therefore more likely to go to jail for what they've done?

04:55.500 --> 04:57.500
Statistics would indicate the latter.

04:57.500 --> 05:02.500
Statistics would indicate the latter, apparently. Well, we'll see.

05:02.500 --> 05:06.500
Now then, Roaming Millennial makes several errors in this section.

05:06.500 --> 05:12.500
Some are errors of mathematics, some errors of omission, and a couple of contradictions of logic there, too.

05:12.500 --> 05:15.500
I don't know where to start, really, to be honest.

05:15.500 --> 05:18.500
But how about we start with this statement of Roaming Millennials?

05:18.500 --> 05:23.500
For oppression to be happening, black people would need to be incarcerated unjustly.

05:23.500 --> 05:28.500
You see, her point here is that black people are more likely to commit crimes than other races,

05:28.500 --> 05:32.500
so it makes sense for them to be a larger percentage of the prison population.

05:32.500 --> 05:40.500
So first of all here, what she does not examine, possibly on purpose, is whether or not these percentages match up.

05:40.500 --> 05:44.500
Because that's important. And I'll give you two scenarios here.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.500
So, Scenario 1.

05:47.500 --> 05:52.500
Let's say one group of people are 10% more likely to commit crimes than other groups of people,

05:52.500 --> 05:56.500
and also make up 10% extra of the prison population.

05:56.500 --> 05:59.500
Now that's what you'd expect in a fair system.

05:59.500 --> 06:03.500
At least without factoring wider society into our little example here, anyway.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.500
Now, Scenario 2.

06:05.500 --> 06:10.500
One race of people are 10% more likely to commit crimes than other races,

06:10.500 --> 06:13.500
but make up 30% extra of the prison population.

06:13.500 --> 06:16.500
Now that's unfair and unjust treatment,

06:16.500 --> 06:20.500
even accounting for that hypothetical group's higher relative criminality.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.500
Do you understand?

06:22.500 --> 06:24.500
So, returning to reality,

06:24.500 --> 06:30.500
which of our little scenarios there more accurately reflects the criminal justice system in the United States?

06:30.500 --> 06:35.500
Well, one way to answer this question is to look not at how certain groups are treated within the system,

06:35.500 --> 06:38.500
but how individuals belonging to those groups are treated.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.500
So let's do that.

06:40.500 --> 06:44.500
And here's a study from 2013 from the Yale Law Journal entitled

06:44.500 --> 06:50.500
mandatory sentencing and racial disparity, assessing the role of prosecutors and the effects of Booker.

06:50.500 --> 06:53.500
And I'd like to read you a few lines from their conclusion.

07:10.500 --> 07:14.500
After controlling for the arrest offense, criminal history, and other prior characteristics,

07:14.500 --> 07:22.500
sentences for black male arrestees diverge substantially from those of white male arrestees by about 10% on average.

07:22.500 --> 07:26.500
While this disparity does not seem to be growing, it is persistent.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.500
So, did you like that study?

07:28.500 --> 07:30.500
Because here's another.

07:30.500 --> 07:33.500
This is a United States Sentencing Commission report entitled

07:33.500 --> 07:39.500
Report on Continuing Impact of United States v. Booker on Federal Sentencing.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.500
And what did that find?

07:41.500 --> 07:45.500
The Commission's updated multivariate regression analysis showed, among other outcomes,

07:45.500 --> 07:51.500
that black male offenders have continued to receive longer sentences than similarly situated white male offenders.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.500
And how much longer were their sentences?

07:53.500 --> 07:55.500
This is from later in the report.

07:55.500 --> 08:03.500
For example, sentence length for black male offenders exceeded sentence length for white male offenders by 19.5%.

08:03.500 --> 08:09.500
And I should note here that I found both of these reports in an article responding to Roaming Millennial on pafios.com,

08:09.500 --> 08:11.500
which I will link in the description.

08:11.500 --> 08:14.500
So that's fairly clear-cut there, I think.

08:14.500 --> 08:21.500
On an individual level, controlling for all the factors except race, black men still get longer sentences than white men.

08:21.500 --> 08:26.500
And because they get longer sentences than white men, they will, on average, be in prison for longer,

08:26.500 --> 08:33.500
and therefore at least some part of their overrepresentation in the prison system is accounted for by this unfair sentencing.

08:33.500 --> 08:39.500
Any argument for this to be fair that mentions black people's increased relative likelihood of being criminals

08:39.500 --> 08:47.500
would have to therefore argue that individual black people deserve longer individual sentences relative to other races.

08:47.500 --> 08:53.500
And this is without considering that the very metric we're using to declare black people's increased relative criminality

08:53.500 --> 08:59.500
is frequent of occurrence in the criminal justice system, which we've just proven is biased against them.

08:59.500 --> 09:04.500
And it's not just on the prosecution end that black people get screwed over.

09:04.500 --> 09:12.500
One fact I like to bring up here is that black people are several times more likely than white people to be arrested for marijuana possession,

09:12.500 --> 09:17.500
even though black people and white people smoke weed at similar rates.

09:17.500 --> 09:25.500
It's all well and good to have a fair and just system on paper, but that doesn't mean the system necessarily delivers fair and just results.

09:25.500 --> 09:33.500
For oppression to be happening, black people would need to be incarcerated unjustly, said Roaming Millennial, and she's correct.

09:33.500 --> 09:38.500
They are, so therefore it is, if you follow.

09:38.500 --> 09:47.500
So, to move on here, Roaming Millennial there mentions the black crime rate as justification for a relatively high incarceration rate compared with other races.

09:47.500 --> 09:49.500
And I'd like to ask a question here.

09:49.500 --> 09:54.500
What would Roaming Millennial argue is the cause of that higher crime rate?

09:54.500 --> 09:56.500
And there's only two answers, really.

09:56.500 --> 10:04.500
There's the genetic-slash-racist argument, you know, black people are inherently by birth more likely to be criminals.

10:04.500 --> 10:11.500
And there's the societal argument, you know, the disparity is explained by a combination of cultural and socioeconomic factors,

10:11.500 --> 10:15.500
alongside the aforementioned bias in the justice system.

10:15.500 --> 10:24.500
And as a little aside here, one annoying thing you tend to see online is someone who secretly favors the genetic argument, but fears saying it out loud.

10:24.500 --> 10:32.500
So they just dismiss the societal factors one by one as being irrelevant, without ever actually committing to the genetic argument.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.500
And that can be a little irksome.

10:34.500 --> 10:38.500
Anyway, which argument does Roaming Millennial put forward?

10:38.500 --> 10:41.500
And I'll read a couple of Twitter conversations here.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.500
Roaming Millennial says,

10:43.500 --> 10:48.500
Minority communities on average have more crime than mixed or majority white communities.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.500
That leads to increased cop encounters.

10:50.500 --> 10:53.500
And a Twitter user called Flying Volvo says,

10:53.500 --> 10:56.500
Really makes you think about what causes it, doesn't it?

10:56.500 --> 11:01.500
Almost like there's some underlying causes of crime in African-American communities.

11:01.500 --> 11:03.500
To which Roaming Millennial responds,

11:03.500 --> 11:06.500
Poverty and culture.

11:06.500 --> 11:10.500
So it appears here that Roaming Millennial favors the socioeconomic argument.

11:10.500 --> 11:19.500
You know, poverty is linked with crime, after all, and increased poverty in predominantly African-American areas would explain the disparity in the crime statistics.

11:19.500 --> 11:26.500
However, with regards to our oppression argument here, we necessarily have to consider the causes of that poverty.

11:26.500 --> 11:35.500
Because it's entirely possible that the poverty argument is simply the genetic argument again, but one step removed from what will get you banned off Twitter.

11:35.500 --> 11:46.500
If the poverty's causes are unexamined, an audience might assume that black people are genetically more likely to be in poverty due to possessing some inherent poverty-related characteristics.

11:46.500 --> 11:50.500
And therefore, by proxy, more likely to be criminals.

11:50.500 --> 11:55.500
Now we know that Roaming Millennial has previously stated that oppression existed in the past.

11:55.500 --> 12:01.500
So the question here is, could that past oppression have contributed to creating the current poverty?

12:01.500 --> 12:08.500
So I guess we have to ask, how far in the past is Roaming Millennial talking when she says oppression existed?

12:08.500 --> 12:13.500
And returning to Twitter again, a Twitter user called hiphoppersknowledge said,

12:13.500 --> 12:19.500
My parents weren't even allowed to drink from water fountains in public, you dumb fuck.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.500
To which Roaming Millennial responds,

12:30.500 --> 12:40.500
Now this exchange indicates that Roaming Millennial considers the Jim Crow laws that enforced racial segregation in the United States to be examples of institutionalized racism and oppression.

12:40.500 --> 12:43.500
Very good. I'm with her on that.

12:43.500 --> 12:46.500
Now these laws were in place until the mid-1960s.

12:46.500 --> 12:57.500
So, from the Declaration of Independence, up until roughly 50 years ago, according to Roaming Millennial, there was institutionalized racism and oppression in the United States.

12:57.500 --> 13:09.500
So, accepting that, it would be very bizarre indeed to then go on to claim that such a long period of racism and oppression would have zero effects whatever on current society.

13:09.500 --> 13:18.500
You know, if you enslave a given race of people and prevent education and break up families and confiscate all their belongings and deny them the vote,

13:18.500 --> 13:27.500
and then subject them to a post-slavery period where for generations they're forbidden by law from attending the best schools and all the other rights afforded the majority,

13:27.500 --> 13:30.500
all these things have lasting effects.

13:30.500 --> 13:36.500
Black people in poverty in the United States are in a poverty that was in part created by this history of oppression.

13:36.500 --> 13:40.500
And that's unfair and unjust, isn't it?

13:40.500 --> 13:46.500
And as a brief side note about culture here, which Roaming Millennial cites as another reason for the crime rate disparity,

13:46.500 --> 13:50.500
one particular culture is only one side of the coin.

13:50.500 --> 13:54.500
We also have to consider how that culture is perceived on the outside.

13:54.500 --> 13:59.500
Now an individual black person might be subject to discrimination based on that perception.

13:59.500 --> 14:03.500
And any one average individual has a minimal effect on that culture as a whole.

14:03.500 --> 14:06.500
People can't always choose how they're perceived.

14:06.500 --> 14:14.500
You know, you can criticize a culture as a whole, but you can't hand-wave away longer prison sentences for individual black people because of it.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.500
That's unfair and unjust.

14:16.500 --> 14:22.500
Let's take a look at another argument of Roaming Millennials now, the Asian-American argument.

14:22.500 --> 14:27.500
And something that I'd like to mention which really debunks the idea that non-white people in the US are oppressed

14:28.500 --> 14:35.500
is the fact that there are non-white groups out there who on average do better than their white counterparts in terms of education and finances.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.500
And yes, felony charges too.

14:37.500 --> 14:46.500
So then, people of color can't be oppressed because Asian-Americans on average are better educated and have a higher average income than white Americans.

14:46.500 --> 14:53.500
Now, does this therefore prove that oppression is now a thing of the past and has no bearing at all on modern society?

14:54.500 --> 14:56.500
Well, I would argue quite the opposite.

14:56.500 --> 15:01.500
In fact, a larger percentage of Asian-Americans being educated and having a higher average income

15:01.500 --> 15:05.500
stems directly from discrimination against Asian people.

15:05.500 --> 15:10.500
And stick with me now, it's kind of a counter-intuitive oneness, I understand.

15:10.500 --> 15:17.500
You know, how can discrimination against a group lead to them being, on average, better off down the line?

15:17.500 --> 15:19.500
And another question here before I answer that one.

15:19.500 --> 15:28.500
In the graph of average household incomes that Roaming Millennial showed, why doesn't the Asian data go back as far as the others?

15:28.500 --> 15:31.500
And these answers are linked, as you'll see.

15:31.500 --> 15:37.500
So I'm gonna throw a few data points your way now, and we'll see if we can later draw some conclusions from them.

15:37.500 --> 15:43.500
So first of all, in 1960, the Asian population of the United States was less than 1 million.

15:43.500 --> 15:47.500
They comprised around half of 1% of the population.

15:47.500 --> 15:54.500
And this is compared to there being over 18 million black people in 1960, to give you a sense of the scale there.

15:54.500 --> 16:01.500
Today, there are around 20 million Asian-Americans, so why were there so few, relatively, in 1960?

16:01.500 --> 16:04.500
And why are there, comparatively, so many more today?

16:04.500 --> 16:06.500
Point number two.

16:06.500 --> 16:14.500
In 1882, the United States Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act prohibiting Chinese immigration into the United States

16:14.500 --> 16:23.500
and making the Chinese migrants present in the United States at the time permanent aliens by excluding them from the possibility of US citizenship.

16:23.500 --> 16:25.500
Point number three.

16:25.500 --> 16:34.500
The Immigration Act of 1917, also known as the Asiatic Barred Zone Act, barred immigration from large parts of Asia completely.

16:34.500 --> 16:35.500
Point number four.

16:35.500 --> 16:43.500
The Immigration Act of 1924, including the Asian Exclusion Act, but not to be confused with the Chinese Exclusion Act,

16:43.500 --> 16:50.500
imposed strict quotas on how many people of a particular nationality could be resident in the United States at the time,

16:50.500 --> 16:55.500
and barred completely everyone who was ineligible to become a United States citizen.

16:56.500 --> 17:02.500
Fifth, and finally here, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965,

17:02.500 --> 17:08.500
which removed the racial and national barriers that were previously in place, which restricted immigration from Asia.

17:08.500 --> 17:15.500
So then, why in 1960 were there a relatively small number of Asian people in the United States?

17:15.500 --> 17:21.500
And that's because immigration from Asia was massively restricted by a series of discriminatory laws.

17:21.500 --> 17:27.500
And then after those restrictions were lifted, immigration from Asia skyrocketed. Relatively, anyway.

17:27.500 --> 17:33.500
Now, the vast majority of Asian-American population growth in recent decades has been due to immigration.

17:33.500 --> 17:37.500
So then, we need to ask, who can move to a different country?

17:37.500 --> 17:44.500
And primarily of importance to us here is people who can afford to move to a different country.

17:44.500 --> 17:50.500
And this is particularly true of a country very far away with which you do not share a land border.

17:50.500 --> 17:53.500
You know, the average Chinese laborer cannot say,

17:53.500 --> 17:59.500
oh, I'm not feeling this really, I think I'll just move to America and buy a house and go to college.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.500
You know, you see my point here.

18:01.500 --> 18:10.500
The United States is not seeing an accurate representative economic cross-section of people from those Asian countries that immigrants are arriving from.

18:10.500 --> 18:17.500
The immigrants are those that can afford to move and afford to pay for college, and this is reflected in the average income statistics.

18:18.500 --> 18:25.500
The disparity in average incomes present in the United States today is rooted in the history of these discriminatory laws.

18:25.500 --> 18:31.500
For a comparative example, imagine transplanting all the African-Americans in the United States outside it,

18:31.500 --> 18:36.500
and then only allowing back in those that had the resources to make the move.

18:36.500 --> 18:42.500
And if you did that, the average household income for African-Americans in the United States would increase dramatically.

18:42.500 --> 18:49.500
Not because they're actually any richer, remember, but simply because you'd be excluding all the poor people.

18:49.500 --> 18:53.500
I mean, poverty obviously still exists in Asia, doesn't it?

18:53.500 --> 18:55.500
Anyway, let's wrap up here.

18:55.500 --> 19:00.500
I feel like I've pitched enough answers to Roaming Millennial there for her to think about for one day.

19:00.500 --> 19:03.500
Now, this is a video I would actually like to see a response to.

19:03.500 --> 19:09.500
I want to know what Roaming Millennial or her fans think about what I've said and how they would answer me.

19:09.500 --> 19:15.500
You know, I anticipate getting a fair amount of insults here, obviously, but I want to see arguments.

19:15.500 --> 19:18.500
You know, if you think I'm wrong, try and prove me wrong.

19:18.500 --> 19:23.500
If you think the studies I referenced came to incorrect conclusions, prove it.

19:23.500 --> 19:25.500
You know, the ball's in your court.

19:25.500 --> 19:30.500
I'm eager for responses here since I feel like the right are just chasing their tails on this issue,

19:30.500 --> 19:33.500
and I want to try and move the conversation on.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.500
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

19:35.500 --> 19:38.500
Do you have a particular video or topic you'd like me to take a look at?

19:38.500 --> 19:42.500
You can send me it over on Curious Cat, and I'll take a peek.

19:42.500 --> 19:47.500
I have enough projects to last for months here, but occasionally something will jump the queue

19:47.500 --> 19:50.500
if I think it's a particularly good fit for a video.

19:50.500 --> 19:56.500
Thanks, as always, to my supporters over on Patreon who are not scrolling by right now.

19:56.500 --> 20:01.500
The credits finally got silly enough for me to drop them in the form they were in, anyway.

20:01.500 --> 20:07.500
But don't worry, credits fans. Tune in next time for the return of the credits.
