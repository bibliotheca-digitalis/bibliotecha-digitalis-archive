0	5800	Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to take a look at a video from a YouTuber by the name of Roaming Millennial,
5800	9300	entitled, People of Color, You Are Not Oppressed.
9300	11300	And wouldn't that be nice?
11300	18000	That's right, new subscribers from the Cuphead video. I usually talk about politics, and history, and all that boring stuff.
18000	21000	I feel the need to apologize here.
21000	25500	Okay, so for everyone else who is still with us, who is Roaming Millennial?
25500	30500	Well, she's one of the YouTubers in the, I'm not a racist, but, vein.
30500	39500	You know, so she's not a racist, okay, acknowledged she's not a racist, but she's got a few questions, you know.
39500	44500	So I'm gonna do my good deed for the day here, and provide the answers to those questions.
44500	48500	Just one YouTuber helping another YouTuber out.
48500	51500	So what is Roaming Millennial's video about?
51500	55500	Well, I would encourage you to watch the whole thing, and I'll put a link in the description.
55500	59500	But I'll show a couple of short clips here, just to get us started off.
59500	65500	So in this video, in the hopes of healing this headache of imaginary oppression that is going around the social justice sphere,
65500	67500	we're gonna be talking all about oppression.
67500	71500	What it means to be oppressed, and how in the United States, and in the rest of the Western world,
71500	73500	no, people of color, you are not oppressed.
73500	76500	So to start, let's go over the definition of oppression.
76500	81500	And yes, I know this is super super basic, but after hearing those students protest,
81500	85500	I really do feel that cracking a dictionary open is necessary.
85500	90500	So the definition of oppression is really quite simply prolonged cruel or unjust treatment or control.
90500	94500	Now with this definition, I think it is perfectly clear to say that in the past, people of color,
94500	100500	and more specifically, African American people, were oppressed by societies in the United States, and the West in general.
100500	101500	I'm not gonna argue against that.
101500	106500	However, the issue here is that these Evergreen students and so many social justice warriors out there
106500	111500	are not just arguing for the idea of past oppression, but for current and ongoing oppression.
111500	115500	And really, that is just a completely inaccurate analysis of the world that we live in.
115500	120500	Obviously, in the United States, there are no legal rights that a white person possesses that a non-white person does not,
120500	124500	and there are no laws on the books that reference an individual's race in any way, right?
124500	129500	I mean, our legal system, our entire system of government is not one that is racially coded.
129500	133500	Okay, so here's the main thrust of Roaming Millennial's argument.
133500	139500	Oppression may have happened in the past, and that's good, she concedes that much at least,
139500	145500	but today, we have legal equality, so that means oppression is not happening at all.
145500	150500	Now the first mistake she's made here is a rather basic one, and it's one you see a lot online.
150500	153500	Roaming Millennial is only considering legality.
153500	158500	She showed the dictionary definition of oppression, prolonged cruel or unjust treatment or control,
158500	163500	but appears to have misread it. Legal rights are not mentioned here.
163500	169500	Oppression can still happen even with an illegal system that is, on paper, completely equal and just,
169500	172500	because the system isn't perfect, of course.
172500	175500	It's made up of individuals or with their own beliefs and biases,
175500	180500	and the sum of those beliefs and biases can add up to a system that appears fair on the surface,
180500	182500	but delivers unfair results.
182500	185500	But we'll look back around to this in a second.
185500	188500	For now, let's watch the next part of Roaming Millennial's argument,
188500	191500	where she attempts to address these unfair results.
191500	195500	And while, in my opinion, equal standing in the eyes of the law and equal standing before government
195500	198500	is a pretty clear indication that oppression is not happening,
198500	202500	some critics might say, no, what are you talking about? There's no equal standing.
202500	207500	There are huge racial disparities when it comes to the legal system, especially the criminal justice system.
207500	211500	Just look at how much more likely black people are to be incarcerated than Hispanic or white people.
211500	214500	I mean, obviously, that's the result of oppression.
214500	218500	Okay, so to answer the question of oppression in relation to the criminal justice system,
218500	223500	which comes up a lot, we first need to return to our definition of oppression.
223500	228500	To repeat once more, oppression is prolonged, cruel, or unjust treatment or control.
228500	233500	So what this definition means for our discussion here is that black people being more likely to be incarcerated
233500	237500	is not evidence in and of itself to prove that they are oppressed.
237500	241500	Oppression refers specifically to unjust treatment or unjust punishment.
241500	248500	So for oppression to be happening, black people would need to be incarcerated unjustly at a higher rate than other races, right?
248500	255500	Because it wouldn't be oppression if these people were being justly arrested and prosecuted for crimes that they actually did commit.
255500	261500	So while many social justice activists try to paint the large black prison populations in the US as evidence of oppression,
261500	266500	the fact is that black people are more likely to commit crimes than other races.
266500	272500	So with this being the case, it is not unjust and therefore not oppressive for the racial makeup of prison populations
272500	276500	to be representative of the racial makeup of people who commit crimes.
276500	282500	The question here isn't, are there proportionately more black people in prison than white people, because obviously that's the case.
282500	289500	The question is, why? Is it because prejudice causes more black people than white people to be convicted of crimes that they did not commit?
289500	293500	Or is it because, on average, a black person is more likely to commit a crime than a white person
293500	295500	and therefore more likely to go to jail for what they've done?
295500	297500	Statistics would indicate the latter.
297500	302500	Statistics would indicate the latter, apparently. Well, we'll see.
302500	306500	Now then, Roaming Millennial makes several errors in this section.
306500	312500	Some are errors of mathematics, some errors of omission, and a couple of contradictions of logic there, too.
312500	315500	I don't know where to start, really, to be honest.
315500	318500	But how about we start with this statement of Roaming Millennials?
318500	323500	For oppression to be happening, black people would need to be incarcerated unjustly.
323500	328500	You see, her point here is that black people are more likely to commit crimes than other races,
328500	332500	so it makes sense for them to be a larger percentage of the prison population.
332500	340500	So first of all here, what she does not examine, possibly on purpose, is whether or not these percentages match up.
340500	344500	Because that's important. And I'll give you two scenarios here.
345500	347500	So, Scenario 1.
347500	352500	Let's say one group of people are 10% more likely to commit crimes than other groups of people,
352500	356500	and also make up 10% extra of the prison population.
356500	359500	Now that's what you'd expect in a fair system.
359500	363500	At least without factoring wider society into our little example here, anyway.
363500	365500	Now, Scenario 2.
365500	370500	One race of people are 10% more likely to commit crimes than other races,
370500	373500	but make up 30% extra of the prison population.
373500	376500	Now that's unfair and unjust treatment,
376500	380500	even accounting for that hypothetical group's higher relative criminality.
380500	382500	Do you understand?
382500	384500	So, returning to reality,
384500	390500	which of our little scenarios there more accurately reflects the criminal justice system in the United States?
390500	395500	Well, one way to answer this question is to look not at how certain groups are treated within the system,
395500	398500	but how individuals belonging to those groups are treated.
398500	400500	So let's do that.
400500	404500	And here's a study from 2013 from the Yale Law Journal entitled
404500	410500	mandatory sentencing and racial disparity, assessing the role of prosecutors and the effects of Booker.
410500	413500	And I'd like to read you a few lines from their conclusion.
430500	434500	After controlling for the arrest offense, criminal history, and other prior characteristics,
434500	442500	sentences for black male arrestees diverge substantially from those of white male arrestees by about 10% on average.
442500	446500	While this disparity does not seem to be growing, it is persistent.
446500	448500	So, did you like that study?
448500	450500	Because here's another.
450500	453500	This is a United States Sentencing Commission report entitled
453500	459500	Report on Continuing Impact of United States v. Booker on Federal Sentencing.
459500	461500	And what did that find?
461500	465500	The Commission's updated multivariate regression analysis showed, among other outcomes,
465500	471500	that black male offenders have continued to receive longer sentences than similarly situated white male offenders.
471500	473500	And how much longer were their sentences?
473500	475500	This is from later in the report.
475500	483500	For example, sentence length for black male offenders exceeded sentence length for white male offenders by 19.5%.
483500	489500	And I should note here that I found both of these reports in an article responding to Roaming Millennial on pafios.com,
489500	491500	which I will link in the description.
491500	494500	So that's fairly clear-cut there, I think.
494500	501500	On an individual level, controlling for all the factors except race, black men still get longer sentences than white men.
501500	506500	And because they get longer sentences than white men, they will, on average, be in prison for longer,
506500	513500	and therefore at least some part of their overrepresentation in the prison system is accounted for by this unfair sentencing.
513500	519500	Any argument for this to be fair that mentions black people's increased relative likelihood of being criminals
519500	527500	would have to therefore argue that individual black people deserve longer individual sentences relative to other races.
527500	533500	And this is without considering that the very metric we're using to declare black people's increased relative criminality
533500	539500	is frequent of occurrence in the criminal justice system, which we've just proven is biased against them.
539500	544500	And it's not just on the prosecution end that black people get screwed over.
544500	552500	One fact I like to bring up here is that black people are several times more likely than white people to be arrested for marijuana possession,
552500	557500	even though black people and white people smoke weed at similar rates.
557500	565500	It's all well and good to have a fair and just system on paper, but that doesn't mean the system necessarily delivers fair and just results.
565500	573500	For oppression to be happening, black people would need to be incarcerated unjustly, said Roaming Millennial, and she's correct.
573500	578500	They are, so therefore it is, if you follow.
578500	587500	So, to move on here, Roaming Millennial there mentions the black crime rate as justification for a relatively high incarceration rate compared with other races.
587500	589500	And I'd like to ask a question here.
589500	594500	What would Roaming Millennial argue is the cause of that higher crime rate?
594500	596500	And there's only two answers, really.
596500	604500	There's the genetic-slash-racist argument, you know, black people are inherently by birth more likely to be criminals.
604500	611500	And there's the societal argument, you know, the disparity is explained by a combination of cultural and socioeconomic factors,
611500	615500	alongside the aforementioned bias in the justice system.
615500	624500	And as a little aside here, one annoying thing you tend to see online is someone who secretly favors the genetic argument, but fears saying it out loud.
624500	632500	So they just dismiss the societal factors one by one as being irrelevant, without ever actually committing to the genetic argument.
632500	634500	And that can be a little irksome.
634500	638500	Anyway, which argument does Roaming Millennial put forward?
638500	641500	And I'll read a couple of Twitter conversations here.
641500	643500	Roaming Millennial says,
643500	648500	Minority communities on average have more crime than mixed or majority white communities.
648500	650500	That leads to increased cop encounters.
650500	653500	And a Twitter user called Flying Volvo says,
653500	656500	Really makes you think about what causes it, doesn't it?
656500	661500	Almost like there's some underlying causes of crime in African-American communities.
661500	663500	To which Roaming Millennial responds,
663500	666500	Poverty and culture.
666500	670500	So it appears here that Roaming Millennial favors the socioeconomic argument.
670500	679500	You know, poverty is linked with crime, after all, and increased poverty in predominantly African-American areas would explain the disparity in the crime statistics.
679500	686500	However, with regards to our oppression argument here, we necessarily have to consider the causes of that poverty.
686500	695500	Because it's entirely possible that the poverty argument is simply the genetic argument again, but one step removed from what will get you banned off Twitter.
695500	706500	If the poverty's causes are unexamined, an audience might assume that black people are genetically more likely to be in poverty due to possessing some inherent poverty-related characteristics.
706500	710500	And therefore, by proxy, more likely to be criminals.
710500	715500	Now we know that Roaming Millennial has previously stated that oppression existed in the past.
715500	721500	So the question here is, could that past oppression have contributed to creating the current poverty?
721500	728500	So I guess we have to ask, how far in the past is Roaming Millennial talking when she says oppression existed?
728500	733500	And returning to Twitter again, a Twitter user called hiphoppersknowledge said,
733500	739500	My parents weren't even allowed to drink from water fountains in public, you dumb fuck.
739500	741500	To which Roaming Millennial responds,
750500	760500	Now this exchange indicates that Roaming Millennial considers the Jim Crow laws that enforced racial segregation in the United States to be examples of institutionalized racism and oppression.
760500	763500	Very good. I'm with her on that.
763500	766500	Now these laws were in place until the mid-1960s.
766500	777500	So, from the Declaration of Independence, up until roughly 50 years ago, according to Roaming Millennial, there was institutionalized racism and oppression in the United States.
777500	789500	So, accepting that, it would be very bizarre indeed to then go on to claim that such a long period of racism and oppression would have zero effects whatever on current society.
789500	798500	You know, if you enslave a given race of people and prevent education and break up families and confiscate all their belongings and deny them the vote,
798500	807500	and then subject them to a post-slavery period where for generations they're forbidden by law from attending the best schools and all the other rights afforded the majority,
807500	810500	all these things have lasting effects.
810500	816500	Black people in poverty in the United States are in a poverty that was in part created by this history of oppression.
816500	820500	And that's unfair and unjust, isn't it?
820500	826500	And as a brief side note about culture here, which Roaming Millennial cites as another reason for the crime rate disparity,
826500	830500	one particular culture is only one side of the coin.
830500	834500	We also have to consider how that culture is perceived on the outside.
834500	839500	Now an individual black person might be subject to discrimination based on that perception.
839500	843500	And any one average individual has a minimal effect on that culture as a whole.
843500	846500	People can't always choose how they're perceived.
846500	854500	You know, you can criticize a culture as a whole, but you can't hand-wave away longer prison sentences for individual black people because of it.
854500	856500	That's unfair and unjust.
856500	862500	Let's take a look at another argument of Roaming Millennials now, the Asian-American argument.
862500	867500	And something that I'd like to mention which really debunks the idea that non-white people in the US are oppressed
868500	875500	is the fact that there are non-white groups out there who on average do better than their white counterparts in terms of education and finances.
875500	877500	And yes, felony charges too.
877500	886500	So then, people of color can't be oppressed because Asian-Americans on average are better educated and have a higher average income than white Americans.
886500	893500	Now, does this therefore prove that oppression is now a thing of the past and has no bearing at all on modern society?
894500	896500	Well, I would argue quite the opposite.
896500	901500	In fact, a larger percentage of Asian-Americans being educated and having a higher average income
901500	905500	stems directly from discrimination against Asian people.
905500	910500	And stick with me now, it's kind of a counter-intuitive oneness, I understand.
910500	917500	You know, how can discrimination against a group lead to them being, on average, better off down the line?
917500	919500	And another question here before I answer that one.
919500	928500	In the graph of average household incomes that Roaming Millennial showed, why doesn't the Asian data go back as far as the others?
928500	931500	And these answers are linked, as you'll see.
931500	937500	So I'm gonna throw a few data points your way now, and we'll see if we can later draw some conclusions from them.
937500	943500	So first of all, in 1960, the Asian population of the United States was less than 1 million.
943500	947500	They comprised around half of 1% of the population.
947500	954500	And this is compared to there being over 18 million black people in 1960, to give you a sense of the scale there.
954500	961500	Today, there are around 20 million Asian-Americans, so why were there so few, relatively, in 1960?
961500	964500	And why are there, comparatively, so many more today?
964500	966500	Point number two.
966500	974500	In 1882, the United States Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act prohibiting Chinese immigration into the United States
974500	983500	and making the Chinese migrants present in the United States at the time permanent aliens by excluding them from the possibility of US citizenship.
983500	985500	Point number three.
985500	994500	The Immigration Act of 1917, also known as the Asiatic Barred Zone Act, barred immigration from large parts of Asia completely.
994500	995500	Point number four.
995500	1003500	The Immigration Act of 1924, including the Asian Exclusion Act, but not to be confused with the Chinese Exclusion Act,
1003500	1010500	imposed strict quotas on how many people of a particular nationality could be resident in the United States at the time,
1010500	1015500	and barred completely everyone who was ineligible to become a United States citizen.
1016500	1022500	Fifth, and finally here, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965,
1022500	1028500	which removed the racial and national barriers that were previously in place, which restricted immigration from Asia.
1028500	1035500	So then, why in 1960 were there a relatively small number of Asian people in the United States?
1035500	1041500	And that's because immigration from Asia was massively restricted by a series of discriminatory laws.
1041500	1047500	And then after those restrictions were lifted, immigration from Asia skyrocketed. Relatively, anyway.
1047500	1053500	Now, the vast majority of Asian-American population growth in recent decades has been due to immigration.
1053500	1057500	So then, we need to ask, who can move to a different country?
1057500	1064500	And primarily of importance to us here is people who can afford to move to a different country.
1064500	1070500	And this is particularly true of a country very far away with which you do not share a land border.
1070500	1073500	You know, the average Chinese laborer cannot say,
1073500	1079500	oh, I'm not feeling this really, I think I'll just move to America and buy a house and go to college.
1079500	1081500	You know, you see my point here.
1081500	1090500	The United States is not seeing an accurate representative economic cross-section of people from those Asian countries that immigrants are arriving from.
1090500	1097500	The immigrants are those that can afford to move and afford to pay for college, and this is reflected in the average income statistics.
1098500	1105500	The disparity in average incomes present in the United States today is rooted in the history of these discriminatory laws.
1105500	1111500	For a comparative example, imagine transplanting all the African-Americans in the United States outside it,
1111500	1116500	and then only allowing back in those that had the resources to make the move.
1116500	1122500	And if you did that, the average household income for African-Americans in the United States would increase dramatically.
1122500	1129500	Not because they're actually any richer, remember, but simply because you'd be excluding all the poor people.
1129500	1133500	I mean, poverty obviously still exists in Asia, doesn't it?
1133500	1135500	Anyway, let's wrap up here.
1135500	1140500	I feel like I've pitched enough answers to Roaming Millennial there for her to think about for one day.
1140500	1143500	Now, this is a video I would actually like to see a response to.
1143500	1149500	I want to know what Roaming Millennial or her fans think about what I've said and how they would answer me.
1149500	1155500	You know, I anticipate getting a fair amount of insults here, obviously, but I want to see arguments.
1155500	1158500	You know, if you think I'm wrong, try and prove me wrong.
1158500	1163500	If you think the studies I referenced came to incorrect conclusions, prove it.
1163500	1165500	You know, the ball's in your court.
1165500	1170500	I'm eager for responses here since I feel like the right are just chasing their tails on this issue,
1170500	1173500	and I want to try and move the conversation on.
1173500	1175500	Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.
1175500	1178500	Do you have a particular video or topic you'd like me to take a look at?
1178500	1182500	You can send me it over on Curious Cat, and I'll take a peek.
1182500	1187500	I have enough projects to last for months here, but occasionally something will jump the queue
1187500	1190500	if I think it's a particularly good fit for a video.
1190500	1196500	Thanks, as always, to my supporters over on Patreon who are not scrolling by right now.
1196500	1201500	The credits finally got silly enough for me to drop them in the form they were in, anyway.
1201500	1207500	But don't worry, credits fans. Tune in next time for the return of the credits.
