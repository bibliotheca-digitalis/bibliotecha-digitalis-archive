00:00.000 --> 00:01.500
Hello, everyone.

00:01.500 --> 00:04.500
This is a video about European history,

00:04.500 --> 00:09.500
and also about one or two tactics that fascists use in order to misrepresent it.

00:09.500 --> 00:14.500
For examples of such misrepresentation, we'll be looking at a video by Mark Collett,

00:14.500 --> 00:18.500
entitled, Writing Europeans Out of Their Own History,

00:18.500 --> 00:21.500
currently with over 400,000 views.

00:21.500 --> 00:26.000
Now unfortunately, I have to make a brief diversion here at the start of the video

00:26.000 --> 00:29.500
in order to prove to you that this video was actually made by a fascist.

00:29.500 --> 00:35.500
You know, I kinda need you on board with that idea if we're gonna be talking about fascist tactics, don't I?

00:35.500 --> 00:37.500
So, okay, who is Mark Collett?

00:37.500 --> 00:43.500
He's the former leader of the Youth Division of the far-right BNP, the British National Party.

00:43.500 --> 00:47.500
Now, the BNP has roots in far more open and undisguised fascism,

00:47.500 --> 00:51.500
but after Nick Griffin became leader of the party in 1999,

00:51.500 --> 00:54.500
they began using more moderate and ambiguous language,

00:54.500 --> 00:58.500
disguising their real aims and beliefs behind euphemisms.

00:58.500 --> 01:04.500
Helpfully for us, Griffin gave a speech to a group called the American Friends of the BNP in the year 2000,

01:04.500 --> 01:08.500
alongside former Grand Wizard of the KKK, David Duke, by the way,

01:08.500 --> 01:12.500
in which he lays out the thinking behind this change in tactics.

01:12.500 --> 01:13.500
Let's have a listen.

01:14.500 --> 01:20.500
There's a difference between selling out your ideas and selling your ideas.

01:20.500 --> 01:25.500
And the British National Party isn't about selling out its ideas, which are your ideas too,

01:25.500 --> 01:28.500
but we are determined now to sell them.

01:28.500 --> 01:36.500
And that means basically to use these saleable words, as I say, freedom, security, identity, democracy.

01:36.500 --> 01:41.500
Nobody can criticize them. Nobody can come at you or attack you on those ideas.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.500
They are saleable.

01:43.500 --> 01:46.500
Perhaps one day, once by being rather more subtle,

01:46.500 --> 01:50.500
we've got ourselves in a position where we control the British broadcasting media,

01:50.500 --> 01:53.500
then perhaps one day the British people might change their mind and say,

01:53.500 --> 01:55.500
yes, every last one must go.

01:55.500 --> 01:57.500
Perhaps they will one day.

01:57.500 --> 02:03.500
But if you hold it out as your sole aim to start with, you're going to get absolutely nowhere.

02:03.500 --> 02:07.500
So instead of talking about racial purity, you talk about identity.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.500
So that's fairly unambiguous there, isn't it?

02:09.500 --> 02:13.500
We want to talk about racial purity, but we know it isn't a goer,

02:13.500 --> 02:17.500
so we talk about identity and freedom and democracy and so on.

02:17.500 --> 02:20.500
It's a fairly common tactic of various far-right groups.

02:20.500 --> 02:25.500
Now, two years after this speech, Mark Collet was featured in a Channel 4 documentary called

02:25.500 --> 02:32.500
Young, Nazi, and Proud, during which he was secretly filmed expressing admiration for Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany.

02:32.500 --> 02:37.500
The documentary also includes footage of him being told he was secretly recorded,

02:37.500 --> 02:41.500
which is hilarious, and I would highly encourage you to give it a watch.

02:41.500 --> 02:47.500
Also at one point, Collet claims he isn't a Nazi because there's no Nazi symbols around his house.

02:47.500 --> 02:51.500
You know, as if it was owning a swastika flag that made one a Nazi

02:51.500 --> 02:54.500
instead of sharing political beliefs with the Nazis.

02:54.500 --> 02:58.500
Either way, here's a picture of Mark Collet with his girlfriend,

02:58.500 --> 03:01.500
who has a swastika tattooed on her chest.

03:01.500 --> 03:03.500
So then, Mark Collet is a fascist.

03:03.500 --> 03:09.500
And, my apologies, I realize it's rather inelegant of me to just dump all of that on you at the start there.

03:09.500 --> 03:12.500
I usually try to be a bit more subtle about it, you know,

03:12.500 --> 03:16.500
but I feel it is important that as we go through the arguments in the video,

03:16.500 --> 03:22.500
we realize that what we're seeing is fascism trying to be saleable, as Nick Griffin put it.

03:22.500 --> 03:28.500
I would still encourage you to watch his video first so you can be sure I'm not misrepresenting his arguments,

03:28.500 --> 03:31.500
although it is fairly quick to summarize, so I will do so here.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.500
So, Mark's argument goes like this.

03:33.500 --> 03:38.500
There exists a nefarious plot to write Europeans out of their own history.

03:38.500 --> 03:42.500
A nefarious plot that has found itself enacted in the following ways.

03:42.500 --> 03:46.500
Casting a mixed-race woman to play Joan of Arc at a festival.

03:46.500 --> 03:51.500
A BBC cartoon about life in Roman Britain that showed a black Roman soldier.

03:51.500 --> 03:55.500
The Hollow Crown, a series of TV adaptations of Shakespeare plays,

03:55.500 --> 03:58.500
cast a black actor to play Queen Margaret.

03:58.500 --> 04:02.500
Doctor Who cast a black actor to portray a Victorian soldier,

04:02.500 --> 04:05.500
and elsewhere shows black Victorians on the streets of London.

04:05.500 --> 04:10.500
ABC cast a black actor to play Sir Lancelot in their show Once Upon a Time,

04:10.500 --> 04:14.500
and various other places cast black actors to play things, you get the point.

04:14.500 --> 04:19.500
Now, Mark compares this to both whitewashing and cultural appropriation,

04:19.500 --> 04:23.500
pointing out the supposed contradiction that some people complain about white actors

04:23.500 --> 04:27.500
taking roles from minority actors, but they don't complain about the reverse.

04:27.500 --> 04:32.500
Mark then concludes that all this is a deliberate cultural Marxist plot

04:32.500 --> 04:39.500
to undermine Western civilization by eroding our common bonds, histories, homogeneity, and so on.

04:39.500 --> 04:44.500
Writing people out of their own history will atomize that people and weaken their in-group preference,

04:44.500 --> 04:51.500
so he says, and we need to come together and defend Europe by becoming fascists.

04:51.500 --> 04:55.500
Well, he doesn't actually say that last part, but, you know, he may as well.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.500
So what do we think about this video?

04:58.500 --> 05:02.500
Well, it is riddled with historical inaccuracies for a start.

05:02.500 --> 05:08.500
Before we get to the arguments here, I'm gonna have to get my red pen out and do a little correcting.

05:08.500 --> 05:12.500
Let's start with that BBC cartoon showing a black Roman soldier.

05:12.500 --> 05:18.500
So this was a video put out on the BBC Teach channel that currently has about 50,000 views,

05:18.500 --> 05:23.500
about 6,000 of which appear to have only turned up to give it a downvote, though.

05:24.500 --> 05:28.500
So then, black Roman soldiers in Britain, were they a thing?

05:28.500 --> 05:30.500
Well, we'll find out shortly.

05:30.500 --> 05:35.500
First of all, as Mark Collet shows this image in his video, he says this sentence.

05:35.500 --> 05:43.500
At every turn, the BBC attempted to shoehorn someone who was not indigenous to the British Isles into the production.

05:43.500 --> 05:51.500
Now, Mark, I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but this cartoon was about life after the Roman invasion of Britain.

05:51.500 --> 05:56.500
The Romans weren't indigenous, they invaded and took it over.

05:56.500 --> 06:02.500
You know, you should probably actually watch the cartoons and maybe learn something, you know.

06:02.500 --> 06:05.500
Why do you think Britain is called Britain, even?

06:05.500 --> 06:08.500
There's just some homework for you there.

06:08.500 --> 06:13.500
Anyway, yes, the Roman Empire spanned from the UK to Africa to the Middle East,

06:13.500 --> 06:17.500
and it recruited people into the legions from all over the place.

06:17.500 --> 06:23.500
And the Romans would use legions from one part of the Empire to guard other parts of the Empire.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.500
It's a lot easier to say things like,

06:25.500 --> 06:27.500
go and put down that rebellion,

06:27.500 --> 06:32.500
if you're not ordering men to go and fight their brothers and fathers and cousins and so on.

06:32.500 --> 06:38.500
I'm gonna read a little here from the Historia Augusta, speaking about the life of Emperor Septimius Severus.

06:38.500 --> 06:39.500
And I quote,

06:39.500 --> 06:45.500
On another occasion, when he was returning to his nearest quarters from an inspection of the wall at Lugu Vallum in Britain,

06:45.500 --> 06:50.500
at a time when he had not only proved victorious, but had concluded a perpetual peace,

06:50.500 --> 06:53.500
just as he was wondering what omen would present itself,

06:53.500 --> 06:58.500
an Ethiopian soldier who was famous among buffoons and always a notable jester,

06:58.500 --> 07:01.500
met him with a garland of cypress boughs.

07:01.500 --> 07:05.500
And when Severus, in a rage, ordered that the man be removed from his sight,

07:05.500 --> 07:09.500
Troubled as he was by the man's ominous color and the ominous nature of the garland,

07:09.500 --> 07:12.500
the Ethiopian, by way of jest, cried,

07:12.500 --> 07:18.500
It is said, You have been all things, you have conquered all things, now, O conqueror, be a god.

07:18.500 --> 07:22.500
Lugu Vallum there being the name of a fort along Hadrian's Wall.

07:22.500 --> 07:28.500
So there we go, Historia Augusta, black soldier, man in Hadrian's Wall. Yeah.

07:28.500 --> 07:33.500
And the emperor in that story, Septimius Severus, was himself from North Africa,

07:33.500 --> 07:37.500
born in what is modern day Libya. His wife was Syrian.

07:37.500 --> 07:41.500
And this is a surviving image of the imperial family from the time.

07:41.500 --> 07:47.500
The real historical revisionism here is pretending that the Roman Empire was exclusively white,

07:47.500 --> 07:52.500
and also somehow homogenous with other apparently exclusively white societies,

07:52.500 --> 07:56.500
that it was in the process of invading and conquering.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.500
I mean, that doesn't make any sense.

07:58.500 --> 08:02.500
So, were there black Romans? Yes, there were.

08:02.500 --> 08:08.500
Next up, let's talk about that Doctor Who episode that showed a black Victorian soldier.

08:08.500 --> 08:12.500
Now, it's quite interesting, this. As we can see from doing a little research about it,

08:12.500 --> 08:17.500
Mark Gatiss, one of the writers of Doctor Who, initially protested against the casting.

08:17.500 --> 08:19.500
And quoting from the telegraph here,

08:19.500 --> 08:25.500
it was only after he discovered records showing that there was in fact a single black soldier in Victoria's army

08:25.500 --> 08:27.500
that he accepted the decision.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.500
Gatiss told how he decided to research the issue,

08:30.500 --> 08:36.500
and came across the story of Jimmy Durham, a Sudanese boy who was rescued from the River Nile in 1886,

08:36.500 --> 08:40.500
and brought up by soldiers of the Durham Light Infantry Regiment.

08:40.500 --> 08:47.500
However, whether or not there is actual historical precedent for portraying a black Victorian soldier

08:47.500 --> 08:52.500
isn't really the most pressing issue here if we're aiming for historical accuracy.

08:52.500 --> 08:57.500
Because the episode of Doctor Who that features the character of the black Victorian soldier

08:57.500 --> 09:04.500
has him fighting a war against a race of reptilian men called the Ice Warriors on Mars.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.500
So much for historical accuracy, eh?

09:07.500 --> 09:14.500
We all remember, don't we, when Queen Victoria sent an attachment of troops to Mars to fight the Ice Warriors.

09:14.500 --> 09:19.500
What a betrayal of their memory to pretend it wasn't exclusively white men

09:19.500 --> 09:23.500
who lost their lives in the Martian Icemen Wars,

09:23.500 --> 09:27.500
you know, writing Europeans out of their own history, honestly.

09:27.500 --> 09:33.500
Now, a similar point can be made for that depiction of a black Lancelot in the show Once Upon a Time,

09:33.500 --> 09:39.500
which appears to be some sort of Shrek-esque, what-if-all-the-fairy-tales-but-at-once type story.

09:39.500 --> 09:43.500
For example, the show also includes Anna and Elsa from Frozen,

09:43.500 --> 09:46.500
Ariel from The Little Mermaid, Cruella de Vil.

09:46.500 --> 09:51.500
That's such a good name. Cruella de Vil. It's amazing.

09:51.500 --> 09:54.500
So this is hardly a historical documentary, is it?

09:54.500 --> 09:59.500
You know, and Lancelot wasn't real. Remember, he's a fictional character.

09:59.500 --> 10:03.500
Regardless, is there precedent for a black Arthurian knight?

10:03.500 --> 10:09.500
Yes, as it turns out, Morian is the Moorish son of Ser Aglowveil,

10:09.500 --> 10:11.500
one of the knights of the Round Table.

10:11.500 --> 10:15.500
And the 13th century story he appears in describes him as

10:15.500 --> 10:20.500
black of face and limb, and also says that his teeth were white as chalk,

10:20.500 --> 10:22.500
otherwise he was altogether black.

10:22.500 --> 10:25.500
He bared his head, which was black as pitch.

10:25.500 --> 10:30.500
That was the fashion of his land. Moors are black as burnt brands.

10:30.500 --> 10:33.500
He was all black, even as I tell ye.

10:33.500 --> 10:37.500
His head, his body, and his hands were all black, saving only his teeth, and so on.

10:37.500 --> 10:40.500
So you get it. This guy was black.

10:40.500 --> 10:44.500
So it turns out even the Round Table wasn't exclusively white.

10:44.500 --> 10:49.500
And there was also Palamedes, who was a Saracen who converted to Christianity.

10:49.500 --> 10:53.500
And if we're talking about historical accuracy, there was also the Green Knight,

10:53.500 --> 10:58.500
whose skin and hair and horse, even, for some reason, was green.

10:58.500 --> 11:02.500
And who, by the way, survives having his own head cut off.

11:02.500 --> 11:04.500
So, you know.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.500
Returning to Doctor Who for a moment,

11:06.500 --> 11:09.500
and that scene featuring the black Victorians on the street.

11:09.500 --> 11:15.500
So is this a malicious plot to undermine western civilization or whatever?

11:15.500 --> 11:18.500
Well, let me reveal one of my tricks of the trade to you right here.

11:18.500 --> 11:21.500
What I do when I want to find out about stuff,

11:21.500 --> 11:24.500
for example, if there's any pictures of black Victorians,

11:24.500 --> 11:28.500
is head over to Google and type in black Victorians and do an image search.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.500
And lo and behold, there are.

11:30.500 --> 11:35.500
Now, I'm saying Victorians here, but that's not really accurate to the Doctor Who clip,

11:35.500 --> 11:37.500
which is set in Regency England.

11:37.500 --> 11:40.500
You see, Mark Collet says the Doctor is walking through, quote,

11:40.500 --> 11:45.500
Regency England in Victorian times, which doesn't really make sense.

11:45.500 --> 11:50.500
The episode's set in 1814 and Victoria wasn't even born for another five years,

11:50.500 --> 11:52.500
but whatever, minor mistake.

11:52.500 --> 11:55.500
The important thing here is the year, 1814.

11:55.500 --> 11:58.500
So then, who are these three people?

11:58.500 --> 12:02.500
Well, they are some prominent black abolitionists in England

12:02.500 --> 12:06.500
who were active prior to the date that that Doctor Who episode is set.

12:06.500 --> 12:10.500
I'll put some links below in the description so you can have a read about them.

12:10.500 --> 12:15.500
I mention those black abolitionists here because England participated in,

12:15.500 --> 12:18.500
not sure if you've ever heard of it, the slave trade.

12:18.500 --> 12:21.500
One consequence of which was that many black people

12:21.500 --> 12:24.500
were moved around all over the place without a choice.

12:24.500 --> 12:28.500
And after the buying and selling of slaves was abolished across the British Empire,

12:28.500 --> 12:31.500
those black people didn't disappear.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.500
Anyway, next up, let's talk about Sophie Okonedo

12:34.500 --> 12:38.500
playing Queen Margaret in that television adaptation of Shakespeare.

12:38.500 --> 12:42.500
Now, the important point here is that she is not playing Margaret, the historical figure.

12:42.500 --> 12:46.500
She is playing Margaret, the Shakespeare character.

12:46.500 --> 12:49.500
This is a theatrical practice that's been translated to television,

12:49.500 --> 12:52.500
along with the rest of the material.

12:52.500 --> 12:55.500
Speaking to the Express, director Dominic Cook said,

12:55.500 --> 12:59.500
Well, in the theatre, we've been doing it this way for donkey's years.

12:59.500 --> 13:02.500
He said he wanted to go with the actor who was right for the part

13:02.500 --> 13:04.500
rather than any other factor.

13:04.500 --> 13:07.500
Now, something I could point out here is, for instance,

13:07.500 --> 13:10.500
Laurence Olivier playing a fellow in Blackface.

13:10.500 --> 13:14.500
And I could note that I don't see Mark Collet complaining about that.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.500
But that would be rather lazy of me.

13:16.500 --> 13:19.500
You see, what I'd be doing there would be making the same point

13:19.500 --> 13:22.500
that Mark Collet makes with his whitewashing contradiction,

13:22.500 --> 13:24.500
just in the other direction.

13:24.500 --> 13:28.500
You see, Mark makes mention of both whitewashing and cultural appropriation debates

13:28.500 --> 13:31.500
to highlight how the supposed cultural Marxists

13:31.500 --> 13:34.500
always complain when a white person appropriates something

13:34.500 --> 13:36.500
or takes an acting role from a minority actor,

13:36.500 --> 13:39.500
but they don't complain about the reverse.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.500
Now, what Mark doesn't mention here

13:41.500 --> 13:45.500
is that he also participates in this apparent hypocrisy,

13:45.500 --> 13:48.500
because he is complaining about black actors being cast in things

13:48.500 --> 13:52.500
while at the same time not condemning whitewashing or cultural appropriation,

13:52.500 --> 13:56.500
which he should, by all accounts, be equally outraged about

13:56.500 --> 14:00.500
if he were coming at this from a position of neutrality, anyway.

14:00.500 --> 14:03.500
But just pointing that out wouldn't be good enough,

14:03.500 --> 14:04.500
I don't think, for me.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.500
That would just be me saying,

14:06.500 --> 14:08.500
hey, Mark, that thing you're complaining about,

14:08.500 --> 14:10.500
well, you do it too.

14:10.500 --> 14:14.500
You know, what I really need to do is explain why minority actors

14:14.500 --> 14:18.500
being cast in, quote, white roles isn't as bad as the reverse,

14:18.500 --> 14:20.500
and it's for a couple of reasons.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.500
The first being a rather simple one,

14:22.500 --> 14:26.500
there are typically more roles to go around for white actors.

14:26.500 --> 14:29.500
You know, ScarJo playing a Japanese character

14:29.500 --> 14:33.500
in a live-action adaptation of a Japanese story is bad partially

14:33.500 --> 14:37.500
because there are so few lead roles in Hollywood for Asian actors.

14:37.500 --> 14:40.500
It's not like there's equal representation there at all.

14:40.500 --> 14:43.500
On the other hand, the reverse, an Asian actor being cast in a role

14:43.500 --> 14:46.500
you might typically assume would be played by a white actor,

14:46.500 --> 14:49.500
that brings us closer to equal representation.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.500
So that's why people on the left, anyway,

14:51.500 --> 14:54.500
tend to care more about one instance than the other there.

14:54.500 --> 14:57.500
Now, to be fair here, I can see instances where a director

14:57.500 --> 15:02.500
would cast someone in a role for a cynical rather than purely altruistic reason.

15:02.500 --> 15:05.500
So why would someone cast a black person, say,

15:05.500 --> 15:08.500
as a character who's more usually portrayed as white?

15:08.500 --> 15:10.500
Well, I can see three main reasons.

15:10.500 --> 15:12.500
The first is a sort of colorblind,

15:12.500 --> 15:15.500
I-hired-whoever-I-thought-was-best-for-the-job thing.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.500
You know, that's fairly boring.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.500
Next up is the socially conscious altruistic reason.

15:20.500 --> 15:23.500
You know, if someone thinks that increased minority representation

15:23.500 --> 15:25.500
is a good thing for society,

15:25.500 --> 15:27.500
then they cast minority actors in their things.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.500
How nice of them.

15:29.500 --> 15:32.500
The third is the cynical capitalist reason.

15:32.500 --> 15:36.500
You know, i.e., we want to market our film to black people, say,

15:36.500 --> 15:38.500
so we cast a famous black person in it

15:38.500 --> 15:40.500
to make it easier for us to do that.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.500
Or maybe if you're especially cynical,

15:42.500 --> 15:44.500
you could try to use the debate and attention

15:44.500 --> 15:47.500
around a controversial casting choice as free marketing,

15:47.500 --> 15:50.500
and then cast as to intentionally provoke one.

15:50.500 --> 15:54.500
I'm sure there's a fair amount of that going on behind the scenes in Hollywood.

15:54.500 --> 15:58.500
Now, we're getting into the fascist rhetoric section of my video here,

15:58.500 --> 16:01.500
but the problem for Mark Collet and other fascists like him

16:01.500 --> 16:07.500
is that they need to elevate everything to the level of a civilization-ending struggle.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.500
So much so that they completely miss the simpler

16:10.500 --> 16:13.500
and more pedestrian explanations for what they're seeing.

16:13.500 --> 16:18.500
You know, maybe a director hired a Chinese actor to be in their Hollywood movie,

16:18.500 --> 16:22.500
not because they want to undermine and destroy Western civilization,

16:22.500 --> 16:25.500
but because they want to market the movie in China.

16:25.500 --> 16:28.500
It's not as exciting, though, when you put it like that, is it?

16:28.500 --> 16:33.500
This escalation rhetoric is a central pillar of fascist argument.

16:33.500 --> 16:37.500
Everything is foreshadowing the imminent doom of civilization.

16:37.500 --> 16:40.500
So a cartoon for children with a black person in it?

16:40.500 --> 16:44.500
Well, that's a sign we're headed for destruction and death.

16:44.500 --> 16:47.500
It's why you never hear a fascist say,

16:47.500 --> 16:50.500
oh, well, this is only a minor issue, this, you know.

16:50.500 --> 16:53.500
This next point doesn't matter all that much or whatever,

16:53.500 --> 16:57.500
because for them, everything is turned up to eleven at all times.

16:57.500 --> 17:02.500
They do this because they're asking people to accept their extreme worldview and politics,

17:02.500 --> 17:05.500
and so they need an extreme threat to justify it,

17:05.500 --> 17:09.500
and lacking one, they just make one up out of bits of children's cartoons

17:09.500 --> 17:13.500
and old Doctor Who episodes and whatever else is lying around.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.500
The next trick I want to talk about is rather a big one.

17:16.500 --> 17:23.500
It's the trick of alluding to an apparent homogenous historical European identity.

17:23.500 --> 17:28.500
Let's look at Mark Collet's examples of things that he's complaining about.

17:28.500 --> 17:34.500
Joan of Arc was a figure in the Hundred Years' War between the English and the French.

17:34.500 --> 17:38.500
The BBC cartoons were about the Roman invasion of Britain.

17:38.500 --> 17:43.500
He shows the Bayeux Tapestry, depicting the start of the Norman conquest of England.

17:43.500 --> 17:46.500
He shows a painting of the Battle of, uh,

17:46.500 --> 17:50.500
wherever that was, between the French and the UK, and allies.

17:50.500 --> 17:55.500
And most confusingly of all, he shows some Vikings from the TV show Vikings,

17:55.500 --> 17:59.500
I believe, when he's talking about the lands that our ancestors built.

17:59.500 --> 18:02.500
Mark, what are you talking about?

18:02.500 --> 18:07.500
European history is a history of conquest and division and warfare.

18:07.500 --> 18:12.500
When were we ever united or homogenous or monocultural?

18:12.500 --> 18:16.500
I mean, Britain, for instance, was invaded by and invaded in turn.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.500
Everyone, basically.

18:18.500 --> 18:22.500
When you say your ancestors, who do you mean, even?

18:22.500 --> 18:27.500
Which one of the various groups of people who invaded Britain are you talking about?

18:27.500 --> 18:31.500
Of course, the reality here is that when Mark or other fascists like him

18:31.500 --> 18:36.500
say culture or identity or religion or ethnicity or nationality,

18:36.500 --> 18:38.500
they mean skin color.

18:38.500 --> 18:40.500
And it really is that simple.

18:40.500 --> 18:44.500
So Britain and France fighting a series of wars over a hundred years,

18:44.500 --> 18:47.500
that really is monocultural and homogenous to them,

18:47.500 --> 18:50.500
because both territories were primarily white.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.500
Which is incredible.

18:52.500 --> 18:57.500
White fascists would rather be engaged in a bloody fight to the death against other white people

18:57.500 --> 19:00.500
than have to sit next to a black person on the bus.

19:00.500 --> 19:03.500
I genuinely believe that to be true.

19:03.500 --> 19:06.500
Skin color really is everything here.

19:06.500 --> 19:08.500
Take, for instance, this painting.

19:08.500 --> 19:12.500
Now, Mark includes this in his video around 12 minutes in,

19:12.500 --> 19:15.500
as he's talking about how Europeans had homogenous communities,

19:15.500 --> 19:20.500
common traditions, common bonds, and a shared ancestry.

19:20.500 --> 19:24.500
Mark includes this painting in his video because everyone in it is white,

19:24.500 --> 19:29.500
which apparently proves their shared common bonds, ancestry, traditions, and so on.

19:29.500 --> 19:36.500
However, by showing this painting, Mark betrays that he doesn't have a clue what he's talking about.

19:36.500 --> 19:42.500
This painting is a private view at the Royal Academy 1881 by William Powell Frith.

19:42.500 --> 19:46.500
To briefly quote the artist talking about this painting in 1887,

19:46.500 --> 19:52.500
beyond the desire of recording for posterity the aesthetic craze as regards dress,

19:52.500 --> 19:57.500
I wished to hit the folly of listening to self-elected critics in matters of taste,

19:57.500 --> 19:59.500
whether in dress or art.

19:59.500 --> 20:04.500
I therefore planned a group consisting of a well-known apostle of the beautiful,

20:04.500 --> 20:07.500
with a herd of eager worshippers surrounding him.

20:07.500 --> 20:10.500
That apostle of the beautiful there being Oscar Wilde.

20:10.500 --> 20:16.500
So then, this painting, which Mark Collet included to show a supposedly homogenous culture,

20:16.500 --> 20:19.500
is actually showcasing cultural divisions.

20:19.500 --> 20:25.500
Fewers at the time would have been supposed to laugh at Wilde's groupies hanging on his every word.

20:25.500 --> 20:29.500
They would have been supposed to notice the contrast between the more traditional dress

20:29.500 --> 20:34.500
of the women in the center of the painting and the aesthetic inspired dress of the other women.

20:34.500 --> 20:38.500
They would have noticed the group of men looking disapprovingly at Wilde and so on.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.500
And Wilde was, of course, Irish.

20:40.500 --> 20:45.500
And the Irish, as we all know, have always been treated as equals by the English, right?

20:45.500 --> 20:50.500
I'd like to see Mark Collet explain to a group of Irish people about how they and the English

20:50.500 --> 20:52.500
have always shared a common culture.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.500
I'm sure that would go over well.

20:54.500 --> 20:58.500
My point here is that this painting, far from portraying a unified culture,

20:58.500 --> 21:04.500
actually shows a divided one, divided in terms of nationality, politics, art, fashion, and so on.

21:04.500 --> 21:10.500
And behind the scenes, sexuality, you know, Wilde had sex with men and was imprisoned for it.

21:10.500 --> 21:15.500
I'd also like to note that we can see in this painting a portrait of the then recently deceased

21:15.500 --> 21:19.500
Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, who was Jewish by birth.

21:19.500 --> 21:24.500
Given that fact, and that the other most prominent figure here is a flamboyant homosexual immigrant,

21:24.500 --> 21:28.500
I wouldn't have thought Mark Collet would have been a fan of this painting all around.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.500
Anyway, to wrap up here.

21:30.500 --> 21:34.500
By reducing the various peoples in Europe to nothing but their skin colours,

21:34.500 --> 21:39.500
and by coaching their followers to identify with being white and nothing else,

21:39.500 --> 21:45.500
Mark Collet and his fascist pals are the ones writing people out of their own histories.

21:45.500 --> 21:49.500
The actual historical truth is that, yes, what we today call Europe

21:49.500 --> 21:53.500
has always been comprised of different peoples and ethnicities and cultures.

21:53.500 --> 21:56.500
All, by the way, with different ideas of what race is.

21:57.500 --> 22:00.500
European history is not white history.

22:00.500 --> 22:03.500
Nothing is that clear-cut and simple.

22:03.500 --> 22:07.500
And I'll end with a question to Mark Collet or any of his fans that may be watching.

22:07.500 --> 22:10.500
Is Spain European?

22:10.500 --> 22:15.500
Do the country of Spain and its inhabitants count as European?

22:15.500 --> 22:18.500
And does its history count as European history?

22:18.500 --> 22:23.500
To you, I'm asking obviously. I mean, I know it's in Europe.

22:23.500 --> 22:27.500
I ask because for more than seven centuries, what we today call Spain

22:27.500 --> 22:31.500
was largely an Islamic territory conquered by the Arabs and Berbers

22:31.500 --> 22:35.500
in the Umayyad conquest of Hispania in the 700s.

22:35.500 --> 22:38.500
Now, seven centuries is a long time.

22:38.500 --> 22:43.500
That is centuries of Islamic history taking place in Europe right there.

22:43.500 --> 22:45.500
What do you think about that?

22:46.500 --> 22:50.500
Rhetorical question, of course. I already know what they think about that.

22:50.500 --> 22:53.500
But they think it doesn't count because they weren't white.

22:53.500 --> 22:56.500
Because when fascists lying about history say Europe,

22:56.500 --> 23:00.500
again, what they really mean is white people.

23:00.500 --> 23:03.500
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone. I hope you enjoyed this video.

23:03.500 --> 23:06.500
One thing I could have talked about here that I didn't

23:06.500 --> 23:10.500
were the various remains found in Europe of people who were born elsewhere

23:10.500 --> 23:12.500
that predate even the Romans, you know.

23:12.500 --> 23:16.500
It turns out that basically anywhere that's traded with anywhere else in history

23:16.500 --> 23:19.500
has seen at least some degree of people moving around.

23:19.500 --> 23:22.500
But I'll probably save all that for a different video if I cover it.

23:22.500 --> 23:24.500
I'm sure we'll get around to it eventually.

23:24.500 --> 23:29.500
Thanks, as always, to all my patrons here who enable me to keep making videos like this.

23:29.500 --> 23:32.500
Aren't they all lovely? Look at them there.

23:32.500 --> 23:35.500
So thanks for watching and subscribing and all that jazz.

23:35.500 --> 23:38.500
I've got a Twitter and a curious cat linked in the description

23:38.500 --> 23:41.500
if you'd like to follow me on Twitter or ask me a question.

23:41.500 --> 23:44.500
Okay, thanks folks. See you next time.
