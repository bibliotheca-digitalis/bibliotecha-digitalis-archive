0	1500	Hello, everyone.
1500	4500	This is a video about European history,
4500	9500	and also about one or two tactics that fascists use in order to misrepresent it.
9500	14500	For examples of such misrepresentation, we'll be looking at a video by Mark Collett,
14500	18500	entitled, Writing Europeans Out of Their Own History,
18500	21500	currently with over 400,000 views.
21500	26000	Now unfortunately, I have to make a brief diversion here at the start of the video
26000	29500	in order to prove to you that this video was actually made by a fascist.
29500	35500	You know, I kinda need you on board with that idea if we're gonna be talking about fascist tactics, don't I?
35500	37500	So, okay, who is Mark Collett?
37500	43500	He's the former leader of the Youth Division of the far-right BNP, the British National Party.
43500	47500	Now, the BNP has roots in far more open and undisguised fascism,
47500	51500	but after Nick Griffin became leader of the party in 1999,
51500	54500	they began using more moderate and ambiguous language,
54500	58500	disguising their real aims and beliefs behind euphemisms.
58500	64500	Helpfully for us, Griffin gave a speech to a group called the American Friends of the BNP in the year 2000,
64500	68500	alongside former Grand Wizard of the KKK, David Duke, by the way,
68500	72500	in which he lays out the thinking behind this change in tactics.
72500	73500	Let's have a listen.
74500	80500	There's a difference between selling out your ideas and selling your ideas.
80500	85500	And the British National Party isn't about selling out its ideas, which are your ideas too,
85500	88500	but we are determined now to sell them.
88500	96500	And that means basically to use these saleable words, as I say, freedom, security, identity, democracy.
96500	101500	Nobody can criticize them. Nobody can come at you or attack you on those ideas.
101500	103500	They are saleable.
103500	106500	Perhaps one day, once by being rather more subtle,
106500	110500	we've got ourselves in a position where we control the British broadcasting media,
110500	113500	then perhaps one day the British people might change their mind and say,
113500	115500	yes, every last one must go.
115500	117500	Perhaps they will one day.
117500	123500	But if you hold it out as your sole aim to start with, you're going to get absolutely nowhere.
123500	127500	So instead of talking about racial purity, you talk about identity.
127500	129500	So that's fairly unambiguous there, isn't it?
129500	133500	We want to talk about racial purity, but we know it isn't a goer,
133500	137500	so we talk about identity and freedom and democracy and so on.
137500	140500	It's a fairly common tactic of various far-right groups.
140500	145500	Now, two years after this speech, Mark Collet was featured in a Channel 4 documentary called
145500	152500	Young, Nazi, and Proud, during which he was secretly filmed expressing admiration for Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany.
152500	157500	The documentary also includes footage of him being told he was secretly recorded,
157500	161500	which is hilarious, and I would highly encourage you to give it a watch.
161500	167500	Also at one point, Collet claims he isn't a Nazi because there's no Nazi symbols around his house.
167500	171500	You know, as if it was owning a swastika flag that made one a Nazi
171500	174500	instead of sharing political beliefs with the Nazis.
174500	178500	Either way, here's a picture of Mark Collet with his girlfriend,
178500	181500	who has a swastika tattooed on her chest.
181500	183500	So then, Mark Collet is a fascist.
183500	189500	And, my apologies, I realize it's rather inelegant of me to just dump all of that on you at the start there.
189500	192500	I usually try to be a bit more subtle about it, you know,
192500	196500	but I feel it is important that as we go through the arguments in the video,
196500	202500	we realize that what we're seeing is fascism trying to be saleable, as Nick Griffin put it.
202500	208500	I would still encourage you to watch his video first so you can be sure I'm not misrepresenting his arguments,
208500	211500	although it is fairly quick to summarize, so I will do so here.
211500	213500	So, Mark's argument goes like this.
213500	218500	There exists a nefarious plot to write Europeans out of their own history.
218500	222500	A nefarious plot that has found itself enacted in the following ways.
222500	226500	Casting a mixed-race woman to play Joan of Arc at a festival.
226500	231500	A BBC cartoon about life in Roman Britain that showed a black Roman soldier.
231500	235500	The Hollow Crown, a series of TV adaptations of Shakespeare plays,
235500	238500	cast a black actor to play Queen Margaret.
238500	242500	Doctor Who cast a black actor to portray a Victorian soldier,
242500	245500	and elsewhere shows black Victorians on the streets of London.
245500	250500	ABC cast a black actor to play Sir Lancelot in their show Once Upon a Time,
250500	254500	and various other places cast black actors to play things, you get the point.
254500	259500	Now, Mark compares this to both whitewashing and cultural appropriation,
259500	263500	pointing out the supposed contradiction that some people complain about white actors
263500	267500	taking roles from minority actors, but they don't complain about the reverse.
267500	272500	Mark then concludes that all this is a deliberate cultural Marxist plot
272500	279500	to undermine Western civilization by eroding our common bonds, histories, homogeneity, and so on.
279500	284500	Writing people out of their own history will atomize that people and weaken their in-group preference,
284500	291500	so he says, and we need to come together and defend Europe by becoming fascists.
291500	295500	Well, he doesn't actually say that last part, but, you know, he may as well.
296500	298500	So what do we think about this video?
298500	302500	Well, it is riddled with historical inaccuracies for a start.
302500	308500	Before we get to the arguments here, I'm gonna have to get my red pen out and do a little correcting.
308500	312500	Let's start with that BBC cartoon showing a black Roman soldier.
312500	318500	So this was a video put out on the BBC Teach channel that currently has about 50,000 views,
318500	323500	about 6,000 of which appear to have only turned up to give it a downvote, though.
324500	328500	So then, black Roman soldiers in Britain, were they a thing?
328500	330500	Well, we'll find out shortly.
330500	335500	First of all, as Mark Collet shows this image in his video, he says this sentence.
335500	343500	At every turn, the BBC attempted to shoehorn someone who was not indigenous to the British Isles into the production.
343500	351500	Now, Mark, I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but this cartoon was about life after the Roman invasion of Britain.
351500	356500	The Romans weren't indigenous, they invaded and took it over.
356500	362500	You know, you should probably actually watch the cartoons and maybe learn something, you know.
362500	365500	Why do you think Britain is called Britain, even?
365500	368500	There's just some homework for you there.
368500	373500	Anyway, yes, the Roman Empire spanned from the UK to Africa to the Middle East,
373500	377500	and it recruited people into the legions from all over the place.
377500	383500	And the Romans would use legions from one part of the Empire to guard other parts of the Empire.
383500	385500	It's a lot easier to say things like,
385500	387500	go and put down that rebellion,
387500	392500	if you're not ordering men to go and fight their brothers and fathers and cousins and so on.
392500	398500	I'm gonna read a little here from the Historia Augusta, speaking about the life of Emperor Septimius Severus.
398500	399500	And I quote,
399500	405500	On another occasion, when he was returning to his nearest quarters from an inspection of the wall at Lugu Vallum in Britain,
405500	410500	at a time when he had not only proved victorious, but had concluded a perpetual peace,
410500	413500	just as he was wondering what omen would present itself,
413500	418500	an Ethiopian soldier who was famous among buffoons and always a notable jester,
418500	421500	met him with a garland of cypress boughs.
421500	425500	And when Severus, in a rage, ordered that the man be removed from his sight,
425500	429500	Troubled as he was by the man's ominous color and the ominous nature of the garland,
429500	432500	the Ethiopian, by way of jest, cried,
432500	438500	It is said, You have been all things, you have conquered all things, now, O conqueror, be a god.
438500	442500	Lugu Vallum there being the name of a fort along Hadrian's Wall.
442500	448500	So there we go, Historia Augusta, black soldier, man in Hadrian's Wall. Yeah.
448500	453500	And the emperor in that story, Septimius Severus, was himself from North Africa,
453500	457500	born in what is modern day Libya. His wife was Syrian.
457500	461500	And this is a surviving image of the imperial family from the time.
461500	467500	The real historical revisionism here is pretending that the Roman Empire was exclusively white,
467500	472500	and also somehow homogenous with other apparently exclusively white societies,
472500	476500	that it was in the process of invading and conquering.
476500	478500	I mean, that doesn't make any sense.
478500	482500	So, were there black Romans? Yes, there were.
482500	488500	Next up, let's talk about that Doctor Who episode that showed a black Victorian soldier.
488500	492500	Now, it's quite interesting, this. As we can see from doing a little research about it,
492500	497500	Mark Gatiss, one of the writers of Doctor Who, initially protested against the casting.
497500	499500	And quoting from the telegraph here,
499500	505500	it was only after he discovered records showing that there was in fact a single black soldier in Victoria's army
505500	507500	that he accepted the decision.
507500	510500	Gatiss told how he decided to research the issue,
510500	516500	and came across the story of Jimmy Durham, a Sudanese boy who was rescued from the River Nile in 1886,
516500	520500	and brought up by soldiers of the Durham Light Infantry Regiment.
520500	527500	However, whether or not there is actual historical precedent for portraying a black Victorian soldier
527500	532500	isn't really the most pressing issue here if we're aiming for historical accuracy.
532500	537500	Because the episode of Doctor Who that features the character of the black Victorian soldier
537500	544500	has him fighting a war against a race of reptilian men called the Ice Warriors on Mars.
544500	547500	So much for historical accuracy, eh?
547500	554500	We all remember, don't we, when Queen Victoria sent an attachment of troops to Mars to fight the Ice Warriors.
554500	559500	What a betrayal of their memory to pretend it wasn't exclusively white men
559500	563500	who lost their lives in the Martian Icemen Wars,
563500	567500	you know, writing Europeans out of their own history, honestly.
567500	573500	Now, a similar point can be made for that depiction of a black Lancelot in the show Once Upon a Time,
573500	579500	which appears to be some sort of Shrek-esque, what-if-all-the-fairy-tales-but-at-once type story.
579500	583500	For example, the show also includes Anna and Elsa from Frozen,
583500	586500	Ariel from The Little Mermaid, Cruella de Vil.
586500	591500	That's such a good name. Cruella de Vil. It's amazing.
591500	594500	So this is hardly a historical documentary, is it?
594500	599500	You know, and Lancelot wasn't real. Remember, he's a fictional character.
599500	603500	Regardless, is there precedent for a black Arthurian knight?
603500	609500	Yes, as it turns out, Morian is the Moorish son of Ser Aglowveil,
609500	611500	one of the knights of the Round Table.
611500	615500	And the 13th century story he appears in describes him as
615500	620500	black of face and limb, and also says that his teeth were white as chalk,
620500	622500	otherwise he was altogether black.
622500	625500	He bared his head, which was black as pitch.
625500	630500	That was the fashion of his land. Moors are black as burnt brands.
630500	633500	He was all black, even as I tell ye.
633500	637500	His head, his body, and his hands were all black, saving only his teeth, and so on.
637500	640500	So you get it. This guy was black.
640500	644500	So it turns out even the Round Table wasn't exclusively white.
644500	649500	And there was also Palamedes, who was a Saracen who converted to Christianity.
649500	653500	And if we're talking about historical accuracy, there was also the Green Knight,
653500	658500	whose skin and hair and horse, even, for some reason, was green.
658500	662500	And who, by the way, survives having his own head cut off.
662500	664500	So, you know.
664500	666500	Returning to Doctor Who for a moment,
666500	669500	and that scene featuring the black Victorians on the street.
669500	675500	So is this a malicious plot to undermine western civilization or whatever?
675500	678500	Well, let me reveal one of my tricks of the trade to you right here.
678500	681500	What I do when I want to find out about stuff,
681500	684500	for example, if there's any pictures of black Victorians,
684500	688500	is head over to Google and type in black Victorians and do an image search.
688500	690500	And lo and behold, there are.
690500	695500	Now, I'm saying Victorians here, but that's not really accurate to the Doctor Who clip,
695500	697500	which is set in Regency England.
697500	700500	You see, Mark Collet says the Doctor is walking through, quote,
700500	705500	Regency England in Victorian times, which doesn't really make sense.
705500	710500	The episode's set in 1814 and Victoria wasn't even born for another five years,
710500	712500	but whatever, minor mistake.
712500	715500	The important thing here is the year, 1814.
715500	718500	So then, who are these three people?
718500	722500	Well, they are some prominent black abolitionists in England
722500	726500	who were active prior to the date that that Doctor Who episode is set.
726500	730500	I'll put some links below in the description so you can have a read about them.
730500	735500	I mention those black abolitionists here because England participated in,
735500	738500	not sure if you've ever heard of it, the slave trade.
738500	741500	One consequence of which was that many black people
741500	744500	were moved around all over the place without a choice.
744500	748500	And after the buying and selling of slaves was abolished across the British Empire,
748500	751500	those black people didn't disappear.
751500	754500	Anyway, next up, let's talk about Sophie Okonedo
754500	758500	playing Queen Margaret in that television adaptation of Shakespeare.
758500	762500	Now, the important point here is that she is not playing Margaret, the historical figure.
762500	766500	She is playing Margaret, the Shakespeare character.
766500	769500	This is a theatrical practice that's been translated to television,
769500	772500	along with the rest of the material.
772500	775500	Speaking to the Express, director Dominic Cook said,
775500	779500	Well, in the theatre, we've been doing it this way for donkey's years.
779500	782500	He said he wanted to go with the actor who was right for the part
782500	784500	rather than any other factor.
784500	787500	Now, something I could point out here is, for instance,
787500	790500	Laurence Olivier playing a fellow in Blackface.
790500	794500	And I could note that I don't see Mark Collet complaining about that.
794500	796500	But that would be rather lazy of me.
796500	799500	You see, what I'd be doing there would be making the same point
799500	802500	that Mark Collet makes with his whitewashing contradiction,
802500	804500	just in the other direction.
804500	808500	You see, Mark makes mention of both whitewashing and cultural appropriation debates
808500	811500	to highlight how the supposed cultural Marxists
811500	814500	always complain when a white person appropriates something
814500	816500	or takes an acting role from a minority actor,
816500	819500	but they don't complain about the reverse.
819500	821500	Now, what Mark doesn't mention here
821500	825500	is that he also participates in this apparent hypocrisy,
825500	828500	because he is complaining about black actors being cast in things
828500	832500	while at the same time not condemning whitewashing or cultural appropriation,
832500	836500	which he should, by all accounts, be equally outraged about
836500	840500	if he were coming at this from a position of neutrality, anyway.
840500	843500	But just pointing that out wouldn't be good enough,
843500	844500	I don't think, for me.
844500	846500	That would just be me saying,
846500	848500	hey, Mark, that thing you're complaining about,
848500	850500	well, you do it too.
850500	854500	You know, what I really need to do is explain why minority actors
854500	858500	being cast in, quote, white roles isn't as bad as the reverse,
858500	860500	and it's for a couple of reasons.
860500	862500	The first being a rather simple one,
862500	866500	there are typically more roles to go around for white actors.
866500	869500	You know, ScarJo playing a Japanese character
869500	873500	in a live-action adaptation of a Japanese story is bad partially
873500	877500	because there are so few lead roles in Hollywood for Asian actors.
877500	880500	It's not like there's equal representation there at all.
880500	883500	On the other hand, the reverse, an Asian actor being cast in a role
883500	886500	you might typically assume would be played by a white actor,
886500	889500	that brings us closer to equal representation.
889500	891500	So that's why people on the left, anyway,
891500	894500	tend to care more about one instance than the other there.
894500	897500	Now, to be fair here, I can see instances where a director
897500	902500	would cast someone in a role for a cynical rather than purely altruistic reason.
902500	905500	So why would someone cast a black person, say,
905500	908500	as a character who's more usually portrayed as white?
908500	910500	Well, I can see three main reasons.
910500	912500	The first is a sort of colorblind,
912500	915500	I-hired-whoever-I-thought-was-best-for-the-job thing.
915500	917500	You know, that's fairly boring.
917500	920500	Next up is the socially conscious altruistic reason.
920500	923500	You know, if someone thinks that increased minority representation
923500	925500	is a good thing for society,
925500	927500	then they cast minority actors in their things.
927500	929500	How nice of them.
929500	932500	The third is the cynical capitalist reason.
932500	936500	You know, i.e., we want to market our film to black people, say,
936500	938500	so we cast a famous black person in it
938500	940500	to make it easier for us to do that.
940500	942500	Or maybe if you're especially cynical,
942500	944500	you could try to use the debate and attention
944500	947500	around a controversial casting choice as free marketing,
947500	950500	and then cast as to intentionally provoke one.
950500	954500	I'm sure there's a fair amount of that going on behind the scenes in Hollywood.
954500	958500	Now, we're getting into the fascist rhetoric section of my video here,
958500	961500	but the problem for Mark Collet and other fascists like him
961500	967500	is that they need to elevate everything to the level of a civilization-ending struggle.
967500	970500	So much so that they completely miss the simpler
970500	973500	and more pedestrian explanations for what they're seeing.
973500	978500	You know, maybe a director hired a Chinese actor to be in their Hollywood movie,
978500	982500	not because they want to undermine and destroy Western civilization,
982500	985500	but because they want to market the movie in China.
985500	988500	It's not as exciting, though, when you put it like that, is it?
988500	993500	This escalation rhetoric is a central pillar of fascist argument.
993500	997500	Everything is foreshadowing the imminent doom of civilization.
997500	1000500	So a cartoon for children with a black person in it?
1000500	1004500	Well, that's a sign we're headed for destruction and death.
1004500	1007500	It's why you never hear a fascist say,
1007500	1010500	oh, well, this is only a minor issue, this, you know.
1010500	1013500	This next point doesn't matter all that much or whatever,
1013500	1017500	because for them, everything is turned up to eleven at all times.
1017500	1022500	They do this because they're asking people to accept their extreme worldview and politics,
1022500	1025500	and so they need an extreme threat to justify it,
1025500	1029500	and lacking one, they just make one up out of bits of children's cartoons
1029500	1033500	and old Doctor Who episodes and whatever else is lying around.
1033500	1036500	The next trick I want to talk about is rather a big one.
1036500	1043500	It's the trick of alluding to an apparent homogenous historical European identity.
1043500	1048500	Let's look at Mark Collet's examples of things that he's complaining about.
1048500	1054500	Joan of Arc was a figure in the Hundred Years' War between the English and the French.
1054500	1058500	The BBC cartoons were about the Roman invasion of Britain.
1058500	1063500	He shows the Bayeux Tapestry, depicting the start of the Norman conquest of England.
1063500	1066500	He shows a painting of the Battle of, uh,
1066500	1070500	wherever that was, between the French and the UK, and allies.
1070500	1075500	And most confusingly of all, he shows some Vikings from the TV show Vikings,
1075500	1079500	I believe, when he's talking about the lands that our ancestors built.
1079500	1082500	Mark, what are you talking about?
1082500	1087500	European history is a history of conquest and division and warfare.
1087500	1092500	When were we ever united or homogenous or monocultural?
1092500	1096500	I mean, Britain, for instance, was invaded by and invaded in turn.
1096500	1098500	Everyone, basically.
1098500	1102500	When you say your ancestors, who do you mean, even?
1102500	1107500	Which one of the various groups of people who invaded Britain are you talking about?
1107500	1111500	Of course, the reality here is that when Mark or other fascists like him
1111500	1116500	say culture or identity or religion or ethnicity or nationality,
1116500	1118500	they mean skin color.
1118500	1120500	And it really is that simple.
1120500	1124500	So Britain and France fighting a series of wars over a hundred years,
1124500	1127500	that really is monocultural and homogenous to them,
1127500	1130500	because both territories were primarily white.
1130500	1132500	Which is incredible.
1132500	1137500	White fascists would rather be engaged in a bloody fight to the death against other white people
1137500	1140500	than have to sit next to a black person on the bus.
1140500	1143500	I genuinely believe that to be true.
1143500	1146500	Skin color really is everything here.
1146500	1148500	Take, for instance, this painting.
1148500	1152500	Now, Mark includes this in his video around 12 minutes in,
1152500	1155500	as he's talking about how Europeans had homogenous communities,
1155500	1160500	common traditions, common bonds, and a shared ancestry.
1160500	1164500	Mark includes this painting in his video because everyone in it is white,
1164500	1169500	which apparently proves their shared common bonds, ancestry, traditions, and so on.
1169500	1176500	However, by showing this painting, Mark betrays that he doesn't have a clue what he's talking about.
1176500	1182500	This painting is a private view at the Royal Academy 1881 by William Powell Frith.
1182500	1186500	To briefly quote the artist talking about this painting in 1887,
1186500	1192500	beyond the desire of recording for posterity the aesthetic craze as regards dress,
1192500	1197500	I wished to hit the folly of listening to self-elected critics in matters of taste,
1197500	1199500	whether in dress or art.
1199500	1204500	I therefore planned a group consisting of a well-known apostle of the beautiful,
1204500	1207500	with a herd of eager worshippers surrounding him.
1207500	1210500	That apostle of the beautiful there being Oscar Wilde.
1210500	1216500	So then, this painting, which Mark Collet included to show a supposedly homogenous culture,
1216500	1219500	is actually showcasing cultural divisions.
1219500	1225500	Fewers at the time would have been supposed to laugh at Wilde's groupies hanging on his every word.
1225500	1229500	They would have been supposed to notice the contrast between the more traditional dress
1229500	1234500	of the women in the center of the painting and the aesthetic inspired dress of the other women.
1234500	1238500	They would have noticed the group of men looking disapprovingly at Wilde and so on.
1238500	1240500	And Wilde was, of course, Irish.
1240500	1245500	And the Irish, as we all know, have always been treated as equals by the English, right?
1245500	1250500	I'd like to see Mark Collet explain to a group of Irish people about how they and the English
1250500	1252500	have always shared a common culture.
1252500	1254500	I'm sure that would go over well.
1254500	1258500	My point here is that this painting, far from portraying a unified culture,
1258500	1264500	actually shows a divided one, divided in terms of nationality, politics, art, fashion, and so on.
1264500	1270500	And behind the scenes, sexuality, you know, Wilde had sex with men and was imprisoned for it.
1270500	1275500	I'd also like to note that we can see in this painting a portrait of the then recently deceased
1275500	1279500	Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, who was Jewish by birth.
1279500	1284500	Given that fact, and that the other most prominent figure here is a flamboyant homosexual immigrant,
1284500	1288500	I wouldn't have thought Mark Collet would have been a fan of this painting all around.
1288500	1290500	Anyway, to wrap up here.
1290500	1294500	By reducing the various peoples in Europe to nothing but their skin colours,
1294500	1299500	and by coaching their followers to identify with being white and nothing else,
1299500	1305500	Mark Collet and his fascist pals are the ones writing people out of their own histories.
1305500	1309500	The actual historical truth is that, yes, what we today call Europe
1309500	1313500	has always been comprised of different peoples and ethnicities and cultures.
1313500	1316500	All, by the way, with different ideas of what race is.
1317500	1320500	European history is not white history.
1320500	1323500	Nothing is that clear-cut and simple.
1323500	1327500	And I'll end with a question to Mark Collet or any of his fans that may be watching.
1327500	1330500	Is Spain European?
1330500	1335500	Do the country of Spain and its inhabitants count as European?
1335500	1338500	And does its history count as European history?
1338500	1343500	To you, I'm asking obviously. I mean, I know it's in Europe.
1343500	1347500	I ask because for more than seven centuries, what we today call Spain
1347500	1351500	was largely an Islamic territory conquered by the Arabs and Berbers
1351500	1355500	in the Umayyad conquest of Hispania in the 700s.
1355500	1358500	Now, seven centuries is a long time.
1358500	1363500	That is centuries of Islamic history taking place in Europe right there.
1363500	1365500	What do you think about that?
1366500	1370500	Rhetorical question, of course. I already know what they think about that.
1370500	1373500	But they think it doesn't count because they weren't white.
1373500	1376500	Because when fascists lying about history say Europe,
1376500	1380500	again, what they really mean is white people.
1380500	1383500	Thanks a lot for watching, everyone. I hope you enjoyed this video.
1383500	1386500	One thing I could have talked about here that I didn't
1386500	1390500	were the various remains found in Europe of people who were born elsewhere
1390500	1392500	that predate even the Romans, you know.
1392500	1396500	It turns out that basically anywhere that's traded with anywhere else in history
1396500	1399500	has seen at least some degree of people moving around.
1399500	1402500	But I'll probably save all that for a different video if I cover it.
1402500	1404500	I'm sure we'll get around to it eventually.
1404500	1409500	Thanks, as always, to all my patrons here who enable me to keep making videos like this.
1409500	1412500	Aren't they all lovely? Look at them there.
1412500	1415500	So thanks for watching and subscribing and all that jazz.
1415500	1418500	I've got a Twitter and a curious cat linked in the description
1418500	1421500	if you'd like to follow me on Twitter or ask me a question.
1421500	1424500	Okay, thanks folks. See you next time.
