00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,500
This is a video about European history,

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,500
and also about one or two tactics that fascists use in order to misrepresent it.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,500
For examples of such misrepresentation, we'll be looking at a video by Mark Collett,

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,500
entitled, Writing Europeans Out of Their Own History,

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,500
currently with over 400,000 views.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,000
Now unfortunately, I have to make a brief diversion here at the start of the video

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,500
in order to prove to you that this video was actually made by a fascist.

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,500
You know, I kinda need you on board with that idea if we're gonna be talking about fascist tactics, don't I?

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,500
So, okay, who is Mark Collett?

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,500
He's the former leader of the Youth Division of the far-right BNP, the British National Party.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,500
Now, the BNP has roots in far more open and undisguised fascism,

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,500
but after Nick Griffin became leader of the party in 1999,

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,500
they began using more moderate and ambiguous language,

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,500
disguising their real aims and beliefs behind euphemisms.

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,500
Helpfully for us, Griffin gave a speech to a group called the American Friends of the BNP in the year 2000,

17
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,500
alongside former Grand Wizard of the KKK, David Duke, by the way,

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,500
in which he lays out the thinking behind this change in tactics.

19
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,500
Let's have a listen.

20
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:20,500
There's a difference between selling out your ideas and selling your ideas.

21
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:25,500
And the British National Party isn't about selling out its ideas, which are your ideas too,

22
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,500
but we are determined now to sell them.

23
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:36,500
And that means basically to use these saleable words, as I say, freedom, security, identity, democracy.

24
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:41,500
Nobody can criticize them. Nobody can come at you or attack you on those ideas.

25
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,500
They are saleable.

26
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,500
Perhaps one day, once by being rather more subtle,

27
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,500
we've got ourselves in a position where we control the British broadcasting media,

28
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,500
then perhaps one day the British people might change their mind and say,

29
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
yes, every last one must go.

30
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,500
Perhaps they will one day.

31
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,500
But if you hold it out as your sole aim to start with, you're going to get absolutely nowhere.

32
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
So instead of talking about racial purity, you talk about identity.

33
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,500
So that's fairly unambiguous there, isn't it?

34
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,500
We want to talk about racial purity, but we know it isn't a goer,

35
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,500
so we talk about identity and freedom and democracy and so on.

36
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,500
It's a fairly common tactic of various far-right groups.

37
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,500
Now, two years after this speech, Mark Collet was featured in a Channel 4 documentary called

38
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:32,500
Young, Nazi, and Proud, during which he was secretly filmed expressing admiration for Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany.

39
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,500
The documentary also includes footage of him being told he was secretly recorded,

40
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,500
which is hilarious, and I would highly encourage you to give it a watch.

41
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:47,500
Also at one point, Collet claims he isn't a Nazi because there's no Nazi symbols around his house.

42
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,500
You know, as if it was owning a swastika flag that made one a Nazi

43
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,500
instead of sharing political beliefs with the Nazis.

44
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,500
Either way, here's a picture of Mark Collet with his girlfriend,

45
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,500
who has a swastika tattooed on her chest.

46
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,500
So then, Mark Collet is a fascist.

47
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:09,500
And, my apologies, I realize it's rather inelegant of me to just dump all of that on you at the start there.

48
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,500
I usually try to be a bit more subtle about it, you know,

49
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,500
but I feel it is important that as we go through the arguments in the video,

50
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:22,500
we realize that what we're seeing is fascism trying to be saleable, as Nick Griffin put it.

51
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,500
I would still encourage you to watch his video first so you can be sure I'm not misrepresenting his arguments,

52
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,500
although it is fairly quick to summarize, so I will do so here.

53
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
So, Mark's argument goes like this.

54
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,500
There exists a nefarious plot to write Europeans out of their own history.

55
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,500
A nefarious plot that has found itself enacted in the following ways.

56
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Casting a mixed-race woman to play Joan of Arc at a festival.

57
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,500
A BBC cartoon about life in Roman Britain that showed a black Roman soldier.

58
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,500
The Hollow Crown, a series of TV adaptations of Shakespeare plays,

59
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,500
cast a black actor to play Queen Margaret.

60
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,500
Doctor Who cast a black actor to portray a Victorian soldier,

61
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,500
and elsewhere shows black Victorians on the streets of London.

62
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,500
ABC cast a black actor to play Sir Lancelot in their show Once Upon a Time,

63
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,500
and various other places cast black actors to play things, you get the point.

64
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,500
Now, Mark compares this to both whitewashing and cultural appropriation,

65
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,500
pointing out the supposed contradiction that some people complain about white actors

66
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,500
taking roles from minority actors, but they don't complain about the reverse.

67
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,500
Mark then concludes that all this is a deliberate cultural Marxist plot

68
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:39,500
to undermine Western civilization by eroding our common bonds, histories, homogeneity, and so on.

69
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,500
Writing people out of their own history will atomize that people and weaken their in-group preference,

70
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:51,500
so he says, and we need to come together and defend Europe by becoming fascists.

71
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,500
Well, he doesn't actually say that last part, but, you know, he may as well.

72
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
So what do we think about this video?

73
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,500
Well, it is riddled with historical inaccuracies for a start.

74
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:08,500
Before we get to the arguments here, I'm gonna have to get my red pen out and do a little correcting.

75
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Let's start with that BBC cartoon showing a black Roman soldier.

76
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:18,500
So this was a video put out on the BBC Teach channel that currently has about 50,000 views,

77
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,500
about 6,000 of which appear to have only turned up to give it a downvote, though.

78
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,500
So then, black Roman soldiers in Britain, were they a thing?

79
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,500
Well, we'll find out shortly.

80
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,500
First of all, as Mark Collet shows this image in his video, he says this sentence.

81
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:43,500
At every turn, the BBC attempted to shoehorn someone who was not indigenous to the British Isles into the production.

82
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:51,500
Now, Mark, I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but this cartoon was about life after the Roman invasion of Britain.

83
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,500
The Romans weren't indigenous, they invaded and took it over.

84
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:02,500
You know, you should probably actually watch the cartoons and maybe learn something, you know.

85
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,500
Why do you think Britain is called Britain, even?

86
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,500
There's just some homework for you there.

87
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,500
Anyway, yes, the Roman Empire spanned from the UK to Africa to the Middle East,

88
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,500
and it recruited people into the legions from all over the place.

89
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:23,500
And the Romans would use legions from one part of the Empire to guard other parts of the Empire.

90
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
It's a lot easier to say things like,

91
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,500
go and put down that rebellion,

92
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,500
if you're not ordering men to go and fight their brothers and fathers and cousins and so on.

93
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:38,500
I'm gonna read a little here from the Historia Augusta, speaking about the life of Emperor Septimius Severus.

94
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,500
And I quote,

95
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:45,500
On another occasion, when he was returning to his nearest quarters from an inspection of the wall at Lugu Vallum in Britain,

96
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,500
at a time when he had not only proved victorious, but had concluded a perpetual peace,

97
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,500
just as he was wondering what omen would present itself,

98
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,500
an Ethiopian soldier who was famous among buffoons and always a notable jester,

99
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,500
met him with a garland of cypress boughs.

100
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,500
And when Severus, in a rage, ordered that the man be removed from his sight,

101
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Troubled as he was by the man's ominous color and the ominous nature of the garland,

102
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,500
the Ethiopian, by way of jest, cried,

103
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:18,500
It is said, You have been all things, you have conquered all things, now, O conqueror, be a god.

104
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Lugu Vallum there being the name of a fort along Hadrian's Wall.

105
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:28,500
So there we go, Historia Augusta, black soldier, man in Hadrian's Wall. Yeah.

106
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,500
And the emperor in that story, Septimius Severus, was himself from North Africa,

107
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,500
born in what is modern day Libya. His wife was Syrian.

108
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,500
And this is a surviving image of the imperial family from the time.

109
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:47,500
The real historical revisionism here is pretending that the Roman Empire was exclusively white,

110
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,500
and also somehow homogenous with other apparently exclusively white societies,

111
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,500
that it was in the process of invading and conquering.

112
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
I mean, that doesn't make any sense.

113
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,500
So, were there black Romans? Yes, there were.

114
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:08,500
Next up, let's talk about that Doctor Who episode that showed a black Victorian soldier.

115
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Now, it's quite interesting, this. As we can see from doing a little research about it,

116
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Mark Gatiss, one of the writers of Doctor Who, initially protested against the casting.

117
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
And quoting from the telegraph here,

118
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:25,500
it was only after he discovered records showing that there was in fact a single black soldier in Victoria's army

119
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
that he accepted the decision.

120
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,500
Gatiss told how he decided to research the issue,

121
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:36,500
and came across the story of Jimmy Durham, a Sudanese boy who was rescued from the River Nile in 1886,

122
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,500
and brought up by soldiers of the Durham Light Infantry Regiment.

123
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:47,500
However, whether or not there is actual historical precedent for portraying a black Victorian soldier

124
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,500
isn't really the most pressing issue here if we're aiming for historical accuracy.

125
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,500
Because the episode of Doctor Who that features the character of the black Victorian soldier

126
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:04,500
has him fighting a war against a race of reptilian men called the Ice Warriors on Mars.

127
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,500
So much for historical accuracy, eh?

128
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:14,500
We all remember, don't we, when Queen Victoria sent an attachment of troops to Mars to fight the Ice Warriors.

129
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,500
What a betrayal of their memory to pretend it wasn't exclusively white men

130
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,500
who lost their lives in the Martian Icemen Wars,

131
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,500
you know, writing Europeans out of their own history, honestly.

132
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:33,500
Now, a similar point can be made for that depiction of a black Lancelot in the show Once Upon a Time,

133
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:39,500
which appears to be some sort of Shrek-esque, what-if-all-the-fairy-tales-but-at-once type story.

134
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,500
For example, the show also includes Anna and Elsa from Frozen,

135
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Ariel from The Little Mermaid, Cruella de Vil.

136
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,500
That's such a good name. Cruella de Vil. It's amazing.

137
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,500
So this is hardly a historical documentary, is it?

138
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,500
You know, and Lancelot wasn't real. Remember, he's a fictional character.

139
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,500
Regardless, is there precedent for a black Arthurian knight?

140
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:09,500
Yes, as it turns out, Morian is the Moorish son of Ser Aglowveil,

141
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,500
one of the knights of the Round Table.

142
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,500
And the 13th century story he appears in describes him as

143
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:20,500
black of face and limb, and also says that his teeth were white as chalk,

144
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,500
otherwise he was altogether black.

145
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,500
He bared his head, which was black as pitch.

146
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,500
That was the fashion of his land. Moors are black as burnt brands.

147
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,500
He was all black, even as I tell ye.

148
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,500
His head, his body, and his hands were all black, saving only his teeth, and so on.

149
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,500
So you get it. This guy was black.

150
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,500
So it turns out even the Round Table wasn't exclusively white.

151
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,500
And there was also Palamedes, who was a Saracen who converted to Christianity.

152
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,500
And if we're talking about historical accuracy, there was also the Green Knight,

153
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:58,500
whose skin and hair and horse, even, for some reason, was green.

154
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,500
And who, by the way, survives having his own head cut off.

155
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
So, you know.

156
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,500
Returning to Doctor Who for a moment,

157
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,500
and that scene featuring the black Victorians on the street.

158
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:15,500
So is this a malicious plot to undermine western civilization or whatever?

159
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,500
Well, let me reveal one of my tricks of the trade to you right here.

160
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,500
What I do when I want to find out about stuff,

161
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,500
for example, if there's any pictures of black Victorians,

162
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,500
is head over to Google and type in black Victorians and do an image search.

163
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,500
And lo and behold, there are.

164
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,500
Now, I'm saying Victorians here, but that's not really accurate to the Doctor Who clip,

165
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,500
which is set in Regency England.

166
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,500
You see, Mark Collet says the Doctor is walking through, quote,

167
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Regency England in Victorian times, which doesn't really make sense.

168
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,500
The episode's set in 1814 and Victoria wasn't even born for another five years,

169
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,500
but whatever, minor mistake.

170
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,500
The important thing here is the year, 1814.

171
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,500
So then, who are these three people?

172
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,500
Well, they are some prominent black abolitionists in England

173
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,500
who were active prior to the date that that Doctor Who episode is set.

174
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,500
I'll put some links below in the description so you can have a read about them.

175
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,500
I mention those black abolitionists here because England participated in,

176
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,500
not sure if you've ever heard of it, the slave trade.

177
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,500
One consequence of which was that many black people

178
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,500
were moved around all over the place without a choice.

179
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,500
And after the buying and selling of slaves was abolished across the British Empire,

180
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,500
those black people didn't disappear.

181
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,500
Anyway, next up, let's talk about Sophie Okonedo

182
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,500
playing Queen Margaret in that television adaptation of Shakespeare.

183
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,500
Now, the important point here is that she is not playing Margaret, the historical figure.

184
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,500
She is playing Margaret, the Shakespeare character.

185
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,500
This is a theatrical practice that's been translated to television,

186
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,500
along with the rest of the material.

187
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,500
Speaking to the Express, director Dominic Cook said,

188
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,500
Well, in the theatre, we've been doing it this way for donkey's years.

189
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,500
He said he wanted to go with the actor who was right for the part

190
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
rather than any other factor.

191
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,500
Now, something I could point out here is, for instance,

192
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,500
Laurence Olivier playing a fellow in Blackface.

193
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,500
And I could note that I don't see Mark Collet complaining about that.

194
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
But that would be rather lazy of me.

195
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,500
You see, what I'd be doing there would be making the same point

196
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,500
that Mark Collet makes with his whitewashing contradiction,

197
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,500
just in the other direction.

198
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,500
You see, Mark makes mention of both whitewashing and cultural appropriation debates

199
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,500
to highlight how the supposed cultural Marxists

200
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,500
always complain when a white person appropriates something

201
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,500
or takes an acting role from a minority actor,

202
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,500
but they don't complain about the reverse.

203
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,500
Now, what Mark doesn't mention here

204
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,500
is that he also participates in this apparent hypocrisy,

205
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,500
because he is complaining about black actors being cast in things

206
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,500
while at the same time not condemning whitewashing or cultural appropriation,

207
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,500
which he should, by all accounts, be equally outraged about

208
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,500
if he were coming at this from a position of neutrality, anyway.

209
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,500
But just pointing that out wouldn't be good enough,

210
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,500
I don't think, for me.

211
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
That would just be me saying,

212
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,500
hey, Mark, that thing you're complaining about,

213
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,500
well, you do it too.

214
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,500
You know, what I really need to do is explain why minority actors

215
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,500
being cast in, quote, white roles isn't as bad as the reverse,

216
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,500
and it's for a couple of reasons.

217
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,500
The first being a rather simple one,

218
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,500
there are typically more roles to go around for white actors.

219
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,500
You know, ScarJo playing a Japanese character

220
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,500
in a live-action adaptation of a Japanese story is bad partially

221
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,500
because there are so few lead roles in Hollywood for Asian actors.

222
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,500
It's not like there's equal representation there at all.

223
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,500
On the other hand, the reverse, an Asian actor being cast in a role

224
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,500
you might typically assume would be played by a white actor,

225
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,500
that brings us closer to equal representation.

226
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,500
So that's why people on the left, anyway,

227
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,500
tend to care more about one instance than the other there.

228
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,500
Now, to be fair here, I can see instances where a director

229
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:02,500
would cast someone in a role for a cynical rather than purely altruistic reason.

230
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,500
So why would someone cast a black person, say,

231
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,500
as a character who's more usually portrayed as white?

232
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,500
Well, I can see three main reasons.

233
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,500
The first is a sort of colorblind,

234
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,500
I-hired-whoever-I-thought-was-best-for-the-job thing.

235
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
You know, that's fairly boring.

236
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Next up is the socially conscious altruistic reason.

237
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,500
You know, if someone thinks that increased minority representation

238
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
is a good thing for society,

239
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,500
then they cast minority actors in their things.

240
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
How nice of them.

241
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,500
The third is the cynical capitalist reason.

242
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,500
You know, i.e., we want to market our film to black people, say,

243
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
so we cast a famous black person in it

244
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
to make it easier for us to do that.

245
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Or maybe if you're especially cynical,

246
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
you could try to use the debate and attention

247
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,500
around a controversial casting choice as free marketing,

248
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,500
and then cast as to intentionally provoke one.

249
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,500
I'm sure there's a fair amount of that going on behind the scenes in Hollywood.

250
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,500
Now, we're getting into the fascist rhetoric section of my video here,

251
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,500
but the problem for Mark Collet and other fascists like him

252
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,500
is that they need to elevate everything to the level of a civilization-ending struggle.

253
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,500
So much so that they completely miss the simpler

254
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,500
and more pedestrian explanations for what they're seeing.

255
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,500
You know, maybe a director hired a Chinese actor to be in their Hollywood movie,

256
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,500
not because they want to undermine and destroy Western civilization,

257
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,500
but because they want to market the movie in China.

258
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,500
It's not as exciting, though, when you put it like that, is it?

259
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,500
This escalation rhetoric is a central pillar of fascist argument.

260
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,500
Everything is foreshadowing the imminent doom of civilization.

261
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,500
So a cartoon for children with a black person in it?

262
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,500
Well, that's a sign we're headed for destruction and death.

263
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,500
It's why you never hear a fascist say,

264
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,500
oh, well, this is only a minor issue, this, you know.

265
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,500
This next point doesn't matter all that much or whatever,

266
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,500
because for them, everything is turned up to eleven at all times.

267
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:02,500
They do this because they're asking people to accept their extreme worldview and politics,

268
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,500
and so they need an extreme threat to justify it,

269
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,500
and lacking one, they just make one up out of bits of children's cartoons

270
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,500
and old Doctor Who episodes and whatever else is lying around.

271
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,500
The next trick I want to talk about is rather a big one.

272
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:23,500
It's the trick of alluding to an apparent homogenous historical European identity.

273
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,500
Let's look at Mark Collet's examples of things that he's complaining about.

274
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:34,500
Joan of Arc was a figure in the Hundred Years' War between the English and the French.

275
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,500
The BBC cartoons were about the Roman invasion of Britain.

276
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,500
He shows the Bayeux Tapestry, depicting the start of the Norman conquest of England.

277
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,500
He shows a painting of the Battle of, uh,

278
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,500
wherever that was, between the French and the UK, and allies.

279
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:55,500
And most confusingly of all, he shows some Vikings from the TV show Vikings,

280
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,500
I believe, when he's talking about the lands that our ancestors built.

281
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,500
Mark, what are you talking about?

282
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:07,500
European history is a history of conquest and division and warfare.

283
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,500
When were we ever united or homogenous or monocultural?

284
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,500
I mean, Britain, for instance, was invaded by and invaded in turn.

285
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Everyone, basically.

286
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,500
When you say your ancestors, who do you mean, even?

287
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,500
Which one of the various groups of people who invaded Britain are you talking about?

288
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,500
Of course, the reality here is that when Mark or other fascists like him

289
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,500
say culture or identity or religion or ethnicity or nationality,

290
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
they mean skin color.

291
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500
And it really is that simple.

292
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,500
So Britain and France fighting a series of wars over a hundred years,

293
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,500
that really is monocultural and homogenous to them,

294
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,500
because both territories were primarily white.

295
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,500
Which is incredible.

296
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,500
White fascists would rather be engaged in a bloody fight to the death against other white people

297
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,500
than have to sit next to a black person on the bus.

298
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,500
I genuinely believe that to be true.

299
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,500
Skin color really is everything here.

300
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,500
Take, for instance, this painting.

301
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,500
Now, Mark includes this in his video around 12 minutes in,

302
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,500
as he's talking about how Europeans had homogenous communities,

303
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:20,500
common traditions, common bonds, and a shared ancestry.

304
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,500
Mark includes this painting in his video because everyone in it is white,

305
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,500
which apparently proves their shared common bonds, ancestry, traditions, and so on.

306
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:36,500
However, by showing this painting, Mark betrays that he doesn't have a clue what he's talking about.

307
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:42,500
This painting is a private view at the Royal Academy 1881 by William Powell Frith.

308
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,500
To briefly quote the artist talking about this painting in 1887,

309
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:52,500
beyond the desire of recording for posterity the aesthetic craze as regards dress,

310
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,500
I wished to hit the folly of listening to self-elected critics in matters of taste,

311
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,500
whether in dress or art.

312
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:04,500
I therefore planned a group consisting of a well-known apostle of the beautiful,

313
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,500
with a herd of eager worshippers surrounding him.

314
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,500
That apostle of the beautiful there being Oscar Wilde.

315
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:16,500
So then, this painting, which Mark Collet included to show a supposedly homogenous culture,

316
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,500
is actually showcasing cultural divisions.

317
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:25,500
Fewers at the time would have been supposed to laugh at Wilde's groupies hanging on his every word.

318
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,500
They would have been supposed to notice the contrast between the more traditional dress

319
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:34,500
of the women in the center of the painting and the aesthetic inspired dress of the other women.

320
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,500
They would have noticed the group of men looking disapprovingly at Wilde and so on.

321
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
And Wilde was, of course, Irish.

322
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,500
And the Irish, as we all know, have always been treated as equals by the English, right?

323
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,500
I'd like to see Mark Collet explain to a group of Irish people about how they and the English

324
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,500
have always shared a common culture.

325
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
I'm sure that would go over well.

326
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,500
My point here is that this painting, far from portraying a unified culture,

327
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:04,500
actually shows a divided one, divided in terms of nationality, politics, art, fashion, and so on.

328
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,500
And behind the scenes, sexuality, you know, Wilde had sex with men and was imprisoned for it.

329
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,500
I'd also like to note that we can see in this painting a portrait of the then recently deceased

330
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,500
Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, who was Jewish by birth.

331
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Given that fact, and that the other most prominent figure here is a flamboyant homosexual immigrant,

332
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,500
I wouldn't have thought Mark Collet would have been a fan of this painting all around.

333
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
Anyway, to wrap up here.

334
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,500
By reducing the various peoples in Europe to nothing but their skin colours,

335
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,500
and by coaching their followers to identify with being white and nothing else,

336
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:45,500
Mark Collet and his fascist pals are the ones writing people out of their own histories.

337
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,500
The actual historical truth is that, yes, what we today call Europe

338
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,500
has always been comprised of different peoples and ethnicities and cultures.

339
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,500
All, by the way, with different ideas of what race is.

340
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,500
European history is not white history.

341
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,500
Nothing is that clear-cut and simple.

342
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,500
And I'll end with a question to Mark Collet or any of his fans that may be watching.

343
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,500
Is Spain European?

344
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,500
Do the country of Spain and its inhabitants count as European?

345
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,500
And does its history count as European history?

346
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:23,500
To you, I'm asking obviously. I mean, I know it's in Europe.

347
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,500
I ask because for more than seven centuries, what we today call Spain

348
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,500
was largely an Islamic territory conquered by the Arabs and Berbers

349
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,500
in the Umayyad conquest of Hispania in the 700s.

350
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,500
Now, seven centuries is a long time.

351
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:43,500
That is centuries of Islamic history taking place in Europe right there.

352
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,500
What do you think about that?

353
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,500
Rhetorical question, of course. I already know what they think about that.

354
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,500
But they think it doesn't count because they weren't white.

355
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,500
Because when fascists lying about history say Europe,

356
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,500
again, what they really mean is white people.

357
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,500
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone. I hope you enjoyed this video.

358
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,500
One thing I could have talked about here that I didn't

359
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,500
were the various remains found in Europe of people who were born elsewhere

360
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
that predate even the Romans, you know.

361
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,500
It turns out that basically anywhere that's traded with anywhere else in history

362
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,500
has seen at least some degree of people moving around.

363
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,500
But I'll probably save all that for a different video if I cover it.

364
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
I'm sure we'll get around to it eventually.

365
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,500
Thanks, as always, to all my patrons here who enable me to keep making videos like this.

366
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,500
Aren't they all lovely? Look at them there.

367
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,500
So thanks for watching and subscribing and all that jazz.

368
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,500
I've got a Twitter and a curious cat linked in the description

369
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,500
if you'd like to follow me on Twitter or ask me a question.

370
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,500
Okay, thanks folks. See you next time.
