00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
Hello everyone, and somewhat belatedly, happy 2018.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,600
Today's video is going to be something of a personal one.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:15,160
A little bit of me talking about myself, a little housekeeping, and a minor mission statement going forward in the next year.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,880
Somewhat of a talky one, this. Not much on the visual side going on here today,

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,380
but I figure you're all used to that by now.

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,420
So a while back, I made a video talking about a particular sort of person you run into online.

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,220
That is young, straight, white guys, usually teenagers or in their early 20s,

8
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:42,300
who are opposed to feminism and social justice, and who are the primary recruiting target for fascists and white nationalists.

9
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,100
I talked about how they feel left out of current social narratives,

10
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:53,540
and how the path to fascism and white nationalism for them is a relatively easy one, full of reassurance and simple to understand

11
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,500
racialized answers for all the world's problems.

12
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,820
And I ended that video by posing a question.

13
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,200
What are the best tactics for reaching these people before they become...

14
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,720
red-pilled, as they would say.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,680
Red-pilled is kind of an odd term there from The Matrix,

16
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:17,360
where protagonist Neo takes a red pill and wakes up to find his existence so far has been a lie,

17
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,860
and the world is actually run by robotic squids.

18
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:27,220
And the real-world parallel to this, I guess, is waking up to find the world is run by women and minorities

19
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,220
and a nefarious Jewish conspiracy or something.

20
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,100
It's all very silly, of course.

21
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,380
Now, why these people chose to pilfer their metaphors from a story written by two trans women

22
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,060
in which a white internet nerd learns the truth about society from a black man kind of escapes me, really.

23
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,420
But regardless, the question.

24
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,620
What can we do to reach these guys

25
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:54,980
before they fall down the suggested videos rabbit hole and end up watching and agreeing with blatant white nationalist propaganda?

26
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:59,300
You know, you're watching Sargon of Akkad one minute, and then a few auto-plays later,

27
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,300
you're listening to Richard Spencer.

28
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:09,020
And anyone who spends a significant amount of time listening to people like Sargon is going to be very ill-equipped to argue against white nationalism,

29
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,520
as indeed Sargon himself is.

30
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:17,760
There's a reason that Richard Spencer considers people like Sargon to be good entry points to fascism.

31
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,840
It's because they peddle the same alarmist nonsense that he does.

32
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:28,760
Even if they wouldn't go so far as to describe themselves as fascists or start throwing Hitler salutes or something,

33
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,040
they're still training their audiences to respond to white nationalist arguments.

34
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:40,920
And it's a relatively simple progression to go from someone like Sargon who complains constantly about women and immigrants and progressives,

35
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,800
social justice warriors and leftists in general,

36
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,280
to someone like Spencer who simply agrees with all of that and says,

37
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,080
well, maybe us white men should start doing something about it.

38
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,880
I'm also going to be talking about my own experience with politics online.

39
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,280
In the video I mentioned earlier,

40
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,720
I briefly noted that I used to be one of the people I was describing, and I hope obviously I'm not anymore.

41
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,200
So maybe there's an answer hidden somewhere in my own experiences.

42
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,220
You know, I was fortunate enough to break out of that alarmist feedback loop early on,

43
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,880
so maybe by thinking about that a little, we can come up with a few pointers for breaking other people out of it.

44
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,480
But first, I guess I should give my elevator pitch for reaching out to these people in the first place.

45
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:32,040
And I have a three-pronged argument here. First up is the standard Mr. Rogers,

46
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,480
let's all hold hands and get along thing, you know. If we all work together, we can do anything, all that good stuff.

47
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,120
But more interesting and immediate though, let's talk tactics.

48
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:49,600
Now, we lefty social justice types understand social concepts like power and privilege.

49
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,280
Now, there's a reason that straight white men, like me,

50
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:59,600
tend to do better on social media, YouTube, and so on, with viewing figures and reach.

51
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,080
And it's because I have a privilege there not afforded to other sorts of people,

52
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,920
even if they're saying the exact same things I am.

53
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,920
And all I can do about that is acknowledge it and try to put it to some good use, I suppose.

54
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,160
So this is my second point.

55
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,720
Straight white cis male voices are amplified right now.

56
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,200
And that's obviously something we should work on changing, of course, by boosting the voices of other people.

57
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,000
However, with regards to the sorts of people I'm talking about,

58
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,200
they're far more likely to initially respond to straight white male voices.

59
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:40,000
You know, they've mostly already been conditioned against listening to what LGBT people and people of color

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and other social minorities have to say about things.

61
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,680
So straight white guys are probably our biggest in with that crowd.

62
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,520
And my third point is also a tactical one.

63
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,160
In a voting habits, political wing sense,

64
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,680
straight white guys are far more likely to fall in the conservative right-wing camp than other sorts of people.

65
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,520
If you can reach people in this demographic and introduce a little nuance and perspective into their worldview,

66
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,000
you won't only have gained an ally, you'll have neutralized a potential opponent.

67
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,960
You know, just looking at the numbers there, it makes good sense.

68
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,680
However, a little clarification before I start doling out advice here.

69
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:26,360
I'm talking specifically to those people in the audience who have already decided that reaching out to these people is a good idea.

70
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,600
I'm not saying everyone has to spend their time and energy doing this,

71
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,280
because obviously a lot of these kids are not coming as open-minded neutral parties

72
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,520
who just need a kind word to nudge them in the right direction.

73
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:44,280
They're often coming as belligerent little shits who'll throw a tantrum and spam you with insults.

74
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,400
Now obviously, nobody should have to deal with that.

75
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,680
So if it's your own decision to shut these people out, that's understandable and fair enough.

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,560
And this is partially why white guys are best situated to reach out to these people, I guess.

77
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:03,400
They've got considerably fewer insults at hand when they're dealing with people who they feel are like themselves.

78
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:09,880
And speaking of belligerent little shits, I'll now paint a picture of myself about ten years ago,

79
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,320
when I was a teenager heading off to university.

80
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,880
There I am there. How cute.

81
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,680
Now I was, and am, I suppose, a straight white cis guy.

82
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,960
So top of the privilege heap in all of those regards, but relatively poor.

83
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,280
So there was an economic pressure there.

84
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,360
And like a lot of teenagers, I was insecure, unsure of myself,

85
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,240
prone to bouts of sadness and uncontrollable emotions and so on.

86
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,600
So to me at the time, anyone suggesting I was personally privileged in any regard

87
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,600
would have been dismissed out of hand.

88
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,320
You know, I didn't understand the wider context there,

89
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,040
or know enough about society or history to comprehend that concept.

90
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,600
All I knew were my own experiences.

91
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:01,400
I frequently felt sad, lonely, jealous, small, and I was broke all the time.

92
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,520
So being a straight white guy clearly isn't privileging me in any real way, I would have said.

93
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,440
Now my political views at the time were in the path of least resistance

94
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,200
towards not having to think about the problem anymore vein.

95
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,760
You know, I didn't identify as a bigot in any way.

96
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,280
And I would have staunchly denied that if accused.

97
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,800
But that didn't stop me from saying and thinking things like,

98
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,440
sexism ended when women got the vote,

99
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,760
and all races are equal under the law now so there's no discrimination anymore.

100
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,280
You know, things like that.

101
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,680
I was bigoted from passive ignorance rather than active hatred,

102
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,840
but bigoted all the same.

103
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,720
If I was asked if women were the equal of men, I would have said yes, of course they are.

104
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,920
And they have the same legal rights as men, and therefore feminism is outdated now.

105
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:54,840
You know, feminists are just fringe lunatics who want women to rule over men or whatever.

106
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:00,280
That was the idea of feminism that I'd picked up just from general cultural osmosis

107
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,680
without having put any real thought into it.

108
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:09,160
I was also an early fan of the atheists debunking creationism videos here online.

109
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:14,440
It made me feel smart to see someone dismantling someone else's beliefs like that.

110
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,440
Even though obviously looking back, debunking creationism is relatively easy

111
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,600
and doesn't really require all that much effort.

112
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,040
You see, my one point of pride at the time,

113
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,880
falsely held, I later came to realize, was my intelligence.

114
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,480
You know, I might be broke and lonely and bored, but I'm smart.

115
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,800
You know, I'm smarter than my parents,

116
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,560
I'm smarter than my teachers and peers and friends

117
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,240
and the girls who won't go out with me and the creationists and the feminists.

118
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,800
You know, I'm the best at that one thing.

119
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,160
That's what I get to have.

120
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,440
And I responded positively to anything that made me feel smarter than other people.

121
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,280
Now, staking everything on one aspect of your personality like that

122
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,320
is setting yourself up for a fall, obviously.

123
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,560
And I'm very lucky that YouTube didn't exist in its current form back then,

124
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,320
as I was exactly the sort of person who, desperate for validation,

125
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,000
would have followed the breadcrumb trail of laughing at creationists

126
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,840
to laughing at feminists

127
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,760
to laughing at just the left and social justice in general.

128
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,600
I'd be just another Sargon fan, probably.

129
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,200
And the constant laughing at feminists would become, over time,

130
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,880
believing in some feminist social justice warrior conspiracy to take over society.

131
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,160
And then we're doing something brave and transgressive in laughing at feminists online.

132
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,960
We're saving Western civilization from the zombie SJW hordes.

133
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,720
Now, it's silly, but it's an attractive narrative for a bored and lonely young man

134
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,440
who needs something to believe in and a community he feels he belongs to.

135
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,080
My initial first-hand experience of feminism and social justice

136
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,320
came on the Something Awful forums.

137
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,360
Something Awful, for the uninitiated, is a paid internet forum.

138
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,160
That is, you pay to sign up and be able to post,

139
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,400
and if you break the rules and get banned, you have to pay again to get back in.

140
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,320
Now, I was a very active SA poster back in the day

141
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,200
and would spend a lot of my free time reading the threads

142
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,960
in their debate and discussion forum.

143
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,960
SA's payment on sign-up meant that the level of discourse

144
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,360
was a little bit higher than elsewhere online.

145
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,400
Obviously, kids without access to a credit card

146
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,480
couldn't sign up and spam a bunch of nonsense.

147
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,360
And compared to the rest of the internet, anyway,

148
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,080
the moderation is fairly quick and active.

149
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,040
Not that there aren't racists, fascists, etc. on the SA forums,

150
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,000
because there are, but they generally have to be smart

151
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,440
in flying under the radar to not get their accounts banned.

152
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,680
It's a bit like a scaled-down version of what we have on Twitter and YouTube today,

153
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,800
with cryptos trying to pander to the fascist crowd

154
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,600
without going too far and getting themselves shut down.

155
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,640
On the whole, though, something awful was pretty progressive.

156
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:09,240
Now, one thread I frequented rather regularly was the feminism mega-thread.

157
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,400
I first clicked on this thread not as some open-minded youngster

158
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,040
looking to learn more about what feminism was.

159
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,480
You know, I clicked on it in order to laugh at the crazy feminists

160
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,920
and their silly beliefs.

161
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,160
And instead, what I found there was absolutely terrifying.

162
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:31,240
It was a group of women talking about things uninterrupted by men.

163
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,120
You know, sometimes they'd even talk about men

164
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,960
and the annoying things that men do.

165
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:41,560
And I can't imagine a scarier scenario for a fragile young man

166
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,200
than to be a fly on the wall as a group of women discuss male shortcomings.

167
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,760
Now, the most embarrassing moments for me

168
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:53,000
were when they would discuss a behavior that I knew I'd taken part in in the past.

169
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,920
Until then, if asked if women were the equal of men, as I mentioned before,

170
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,160
I would have said yes, but I wouldn't have necessarily believed it,

171
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,400
you know, deep down and subconsciously.

172
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,560
And confronted with the reality of women being able to understand things

173
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,440
just as well as me, or even worse, being able to understand things better than me,

174
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,720
to be thinking things unthought by me,

175
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,400
and to be judging me for my behavior based on a set of rules

176
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,640
I could not see or understand.

177
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,080
You know, it's a horror.

178
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,640
It was a direct challenge to my intelligence,

179
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,440
which was by far the main pillar of my identity,

180
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,360
and I reacted as you'd expect,

181
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:36,440
by calmly accepting their arguments and modifying my behavior going forward.

182
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,760
Just kidding, of course.

183
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,400
I rejected it all outright, obviously.

184
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,120
However, from then on,

185
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,960
I started paying more attention to my interactions with women.

186
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,720
I couldn't help it.

187
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,600
You know, the ideas were in my head at that point,

188
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,560
and I'd noticed myself doing things that the women in the thread would criticize,

189
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,560
and I started to think to myself, you know,

190
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,200
maybe I am faster to start explaining something to a woman than to a man.

191
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,360
Maybe I do unconsciously assume men are more competent.

192
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,040
You know, how many times have I just sat there going on at some woman

193
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,800
about something she knew more than me about while she just smiled politely?

194
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,840
And even thinking about it now, writing this years later,

195
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,680
it makes me cringe, honestly.

196
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,200
It took me a long time to come to terms with all this, obviously.

197
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,960
I changed my opinion slowly and piece by piece,

198
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,640
and it seems odd that such a small thing as clicking on a forum thread

199
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,640
could have been the catalyst for such a big change in my political outlook,

200
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,200
but it was.

201
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,960
I kept reading that thread and the arguments they had

202
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,960
and read the authors they suggested.

203
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,200
I didn't agree with everything I read,

204
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
certainly not at the beginning anyway,

205
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,200
but what I did agree with made good sense to me.

206
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,520
The illusion of the feminists as fringe lunatics had been shattered.

207
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,120
So my first note here,

208
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,360
personal change often happens privately over time,

209
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,400
behind the scenes.

210
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,120
If you can get the ideas out there,

211
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,720
and they're the right ideas, of course,

212
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,040
they'll grow and bear fruit over time.

213
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,520
So don't get disheartened if you can't reach someone right away.

214
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,960
It might take them months,

215
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,960
or in my case it was years,

216
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,120
to talk themselves around to it.

217
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,960
And that's often the case with people who think they're smarter than they are.

218
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,680
They have to wait a while so they can con themselves

219
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,720
into thinking they changed their own mind, you know?

220
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,840
And the second point I want to mention about that feminism thread

221
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,800
is that it was not by any means a hive mind.

222
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,560
It was actually full of very lively and sometimes very rowdy

223
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,200
arguments.

224
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,240
There were lots of different kinds of feminists arguing for different things,

225
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,000
and that by itself can be illuminating to come into contact with.

226
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,040
It's easy to caricature a political opponent

227
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,280
by being very selective in what of them you present to your audience.

228
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,400
A lot of the fans of various anti-feminist YouTubers

229
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,200
will not even be aware that in-group disagreements

230
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,280
happen between feminists or what they would call SJWs.

231
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,960
They'll be working with the anti-feminist group definitions,

232
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,640
which say all feminists and SJWs are in lockstep

233
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,400
and are fairly represented by the fringe annoying people

234
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,080
contained within each group.

235
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,880
Presenting a united front against that can be counterproductive, I feel.

236
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,240
So I'm here going to acknowledge the various annoying things

237
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,560
about feminism and social justice online.

238
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,800
In my opinion, I should say.

239
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:37,000
First off, there are the trans-exclusionary radical feminists.

240
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,600
That's transphobic people who call themselves feminists,

241
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,160
but are much more interested in using feminism as a shield to hide behind

242
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,240
while they attack trans people.

243
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,760
I'm not a fan of them at all.

244
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,240
There are certain, what I guess you could call liberal feminists,

245
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,520
who see feminism as mindless veneration of women.

246
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,840
You know, people who'll celebrate Margaret Thatcher or whoever else

247
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,000
just because they happened to be a woman.

248
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,640
There are some male feminists who are just claiming to be so to get laid.

249
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,600
There are racist feminists.

250
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,080
Feminists who attack sex workers.

251
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:18,280
The very rare, in earnest, all-sexes-rape-kill-all-men extremist.

252
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,880
And of course, there are people who are maybe just having a bad day,

253
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,000
who do something embarrassing or cringe-worthy in public

254
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,400
and get recorded and meme-ified.

255
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,080
All these people do exist.

256
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,720
And if I or anyone else wanted to,

257
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,920
they could cherry-pick examples out of those groups all day,

258
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,800
strip off all the labels except feminist,

259
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,320
and make a very lucrative YouTube channel making fun of them.

260
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,640
The truth though, for me anyway, just speaking for myself here,

261
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,560
is that none of those groups fairly represent what feminism is.

262
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,440
I mention them here to say to any fans of anti-feminist YouTubers who are watching,

263
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,520
Yes, I get that those people exist, but they're not nearly every feminist.

264
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,560
They're a minority.

265
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,280
Feminists are actually a diverse grouping of people all with different opinions,

266
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,440
not some monolithic hive mind.

267
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,200
And this leads me to my next point.

268
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:16,120
As far as possible, when attempting to reach the demographic I'm talking about anyway,

269
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,800
avoid using labels.

270
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,560
Now I never call myself a feminist for a couple of reasons,

271
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,640
the first being that I don't think I should self-apply that identity,

272
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:31,800
but also because it's very easy online to get mired in discussion of what particular labels mean,

273
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,800
like I did just a minute ago.

274
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,800
And then you never get around to discussing the ideas behind those labels.

275
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:42,520
These young white guys have been pre-programmed to laugh and open up the memes folder

276
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,560
when they see words like feminist or socialist,

277
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,480
even if they're working with a false picture of what it is they're attacking.

278
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,320
And worse is if they don't recognize the political labels you're using,

279
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,640
because that makes them feel unintelligent, which is the worst thing of all.

280
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,040
You know, better is to pitch them ideas phrased as simply as possible,

281
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,920
and also that seem devoid of any particular identity or allegiance.

282
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:11,640
Now do I think that's a sustainable long-term strategy for building political bridges?

283
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,080
No.

284
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,720
Ultimately you do need labels to define things.

285
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm strictly talking icebreakers here.

286
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,760
You know, just trying to land a couple of sticky arguments in their minds,

287
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,280
and then hopefully leaving them to do the rest.

288
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:32,360
As an example here, you can have the socialism versus capitalism debate online all day,

289
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,760
but you'll always run into the same problem.

290
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,240
In a room with ten people in it,

291
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,560
you'll be working with seven different definitions of what socialism means,

292
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:47,400
from modern European-style social democracies all the way to Stalinist Russia.

293
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,040
Perhaps more effective to our specific audience here anyway,

294
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,880
is to simply point out problems with our current economic system.

295
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,240
It's very hard to argue against the fact that capitalism should be criticized.

296
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,680
We don't need to compare it to anything else to do that either.

297
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,600
It has flaws all on its own.

298
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,200
And just getting certain people used to the idea that capitalism is not perfect,

299
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,840
and can be criticized, is enough.

300
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,040
For now anyway.

301
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,560
Either they'll do the rest themselves, in which case great,

302
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,920
or at the very least they'll be less heated opponents.

303
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:28,040
Now this is, of course, the same tactic the smarter members of the alt-right

304
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,120
are currently engaged in, arguing the concept of race realism,

305
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,680
which is their in vogue euphemism for racism but acceptable.

306
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,840
They're trying to get whoever will listen

307
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,000
used to the idea of classifying and organizing people by race.

308
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,040
And that's the Trojan horse for their real argument,

309
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,960
which is therefore it's okay to discriminate against people.

310
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:55,400
They're repackaging their arguments to be more attractive to the average person.

311
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,280
And we should not shy away from doing the same.

312
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,280
Now the difference here is that I will just freely admit to doing that.

313
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,960
You know, yes, that's what I'm doing.

314
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:10,280
I'm using words and arguments and rhetoric to try to change people's minds.

315
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,880
You know, there's no 4chan plotting or secret discord organizing necessary here.

316
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,520
I want to change people's minds.

317
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,480
I'm hoping people will be appreciative of that honesty

318
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,680
instead of seeing it as maliciously manipulative or something.

319
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,680
So about that 4chan plotting there,

320
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,760
this ties into my next piece of advice,

321
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,960
which seems rather obvious, I guess, but anyway, here it is.

322
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,520
Don't fall into traps.

323
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,920
And I want to talk about the It's Okay To Be White campaign here,

324
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,000
which credit where credit's due is a clever bit of manipulation.

325
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,880
It exploited both a liberal blind spot

326
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,400
and the media's love of anything racially charged.

327
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,480
Now I understand the arguments against the It's Okay To Be White slogan.

328
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,960
At firstly, it was obviously initiated by white nationalists,

329
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,960
which should be a bit of a tip-off.

330
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,760
You know, even if you don't have a problem with the slogan,

331
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,360
you should probably wonder where it's coming from and why.

332
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,760
Secondly, white nationalism is harmful to white identities.

333
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,760
There are lots of different groups of white people all with their own histories,

334
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,200
and white nationalists strip away all of the specifics

335
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,320
and just stamp the label white over everything.

336
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:30,040
It's Okay To Be White normalizes this idea of identifying as simply white.

337
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:36,920
Also, saying It's Okay To Be White as a statement implies an attack on whiteness

338
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,680
that necessitates the statement being said in the first place.

339
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:45,000
You know, it legitimizes the idea that white people are somehow under attack.

340
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,000
It's difficult to get all of this into a tweet, however.

341
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,240
The bad thing to do is to try to cleverly flip the slogan back on them.

342
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,840
It's Not Okay To Be White.

343
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,840
Even if you follow that up with a truckload of explanation,

344
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,920
it's gonna get clipped out of context.

345
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,760
And that's what they want, after all.

346
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,400
All we need is a couple of people to say that,

347
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,240
a few university professors to fumble their words in response,

348
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,120
and the people who came up with this thing will feel validated.

349
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,600
We're just handing them ammo at that point.

350
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,200
The only way to neutralize something like this is to explain it.

351
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,240
You know, here's where it came from, here's who shared it,

352
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,160
here's what they're aiming to achieve with it.

353
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,520
Don't engage with it directly in the way they want you to, please.

354
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,800
You know, don't let them define the boundaries of the argument.

355
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,760
When you see something like this in future,

356
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,840
and there will be something like this in future,

357
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,240
don't engage with it face-on.

358
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,440
Just pull back a bit and explain what's going on.

359
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,320
Now, as well as not falling into the alt-right traps,

360
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:51,160
there are a few behaviors you see on the left that aren't going to go over well

361
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,120
with the particular demographic I'm talking about.

362
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,000
Now, speaking as a straight white cis man,

363
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,800
it's the best start to any sentence there,

364
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,200
jokes about white people and straight people and cis people,

365
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,400
which you do see occasionally, don't really bother me.

366
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,440
Because to me, it's a triviality.

367
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,640
You know, my feelings can't really be hurt there for a few reasons.

368
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,200
Firstly, because I don't really peg my self-worth to any of those labels.

369
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,760
But secondly, because making fun of cis people or straight people or whatever

370
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,920
carries as much relative weight to mocking trans people or gay people

371
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,960
as mocking Capricorns say,

372
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,160
there's no power or threat looming behind the words.

373
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,120
But that's just how I see it now.

374
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,120
You know, it took me a long time to come around to that way of thinking.

375
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,400
This sort of thing leaves a lot of straight white cis guys

376
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,840
feeling an object of ridicule, you know, shut out in the cold.

377
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,760
It says, you're my enemy, and you can't understand me,

378
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,360
and don't even bother trying.

379
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,240
Now, I'm not even necessarily asking anyone to change this behavior.

380
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,040
Again, I'm addressing people who've already settled

381
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,880
on trying to appeal to this demographic.

382
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,920
But I am worried about the implications of shutting the door on these kids.

383
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,160
You know, you never hear anyone say,

384
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,560
it's not my job to educate you about white nationalism, do you?

385
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,960
They're clamoring to talk to anyone who'll listen.

386
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,400
And of course, unless you happen to be a teacher,

387
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,640
it's not your job to educate anyone about anything,

388
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,680
especially if they're being a particularly hostile student.

389
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:33,080
But we do need that educating to be done by someone, eventually.

390
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,080
And if they won't do it themselves, then it will have to be someone else.

391
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,920
On YouTube, it's easy for me and others to simply tear down their idols.

392
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:48,840
Anti-feminist and alt-right YouTubers require little additional effort to make look silly.

393
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,320
And I have had a lot of people reach out to me to say my videos pointing out the errors

394
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,720
in the arguments of Molyneux or Sargon or whoever else

395
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,200
led them to reconsider their politics.

396
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,320
So there is value in that, and I am going to keep doing it.

397
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,080
But there's also a chance right now for me and other creators

398
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,880
to establish our own narrative here on YouTube,

399
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,160
you know, rather than just reacting to someone else's.

400
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,080
Too many creators on YouTube, whatever their politics,

401
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:22,600
I'm not naming any names here, tend to get hung up responding to just one individual

402
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,480
out of some personal vendetta, however justified they have against them.

403
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,000
And that really isn't the best use of our time.

404
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,800
Even if you make the perfect video which completely disgraces some anti-feminist

405
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,440
or whoever else in the eyes of their followers,

406
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,000
they'll just be replaced by someone else tomorrow.

407
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,000
The desire for their type of content still exists,

408
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,240
regardless of what they do as individuals, and that's the real problem.

409
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:55,400
However, the desire is also clearly there for more leftist voices on the platform.

410
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,880
So I'll repeat my call from a while back.

411
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,560
If you want to get started, now is a great time.

412
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,520
Over the course of the next few years in particular,

413
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,880
leftist YouTube is going to grow massively.

414
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,200
So make a video and share it.

415
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,560
It's a lot of fun.

416
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,840
So this is going to be my plan going forward in 2018.

417
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,040
More political videos that approach various topics from the left

418
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,160
with the aim of building up a library of material there,

419
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,280
lure them in with the debunking videos,

420
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:31,160
and then the suggested video feature hits them with a lecture about privatization or something.

421
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,360
That's my sneaky plan, which I've just given away, I realize.

422
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,520
Thanks a lot for watching this meandering mess, folks.

423
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,520
It's a bit of an odd video today, but my patrons wanted to see it,

424
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,480
and I'm willingly a slave to their desires.

425
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,280
I hope there was something you were able to take from it, at least.

426
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,600
Now, don't worry if you're someone who cannot spare the mental energy

427
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,960
to attempt to appeal to the demographic I've been talking about.

428
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,760
If you're someone the alt-right hates by virtue of whatever you happen to be,

429
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:08,120
simply existing and being awesome is a good counterargument in and of itself.

430
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,800
And a final note here.

431
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,920
Intersectionality is really important.

432
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:17,240
Where the alt-right break people into small groups, we should bring them together.

433
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,360
And then we'll definitely have them beat on the numbers, at least.

434
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:25,000
So, uh, be intersectional, I guess is my last bit of advice.

435
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,240
Thanks, as always, to all my supporters over on Patreon.

436
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,640
Have you noticed the new credits, by the way?

437
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,200
We have new credits now by Jen.

438
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,240
This should solve the problem with the scrolling, hopefully.

439
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,000
And here's how they work.

440
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,400
If you pledge at the credits tier, then the month after your pledge began,

441
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,880
you'll start appearing in the credits of videos.

442
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,480
So everyone who pledged at the credits tier after I created it,

443
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,040
your name will start appearing in next month's videos.

444
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,000
This is to stop people pledging with a silly name

445
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,560
and then dropping out before the end of the month, you see.

446
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,520
I've had a few of those.

447
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,160
Okay, folks, thanks a lot for watching, and I'll see you next time.
