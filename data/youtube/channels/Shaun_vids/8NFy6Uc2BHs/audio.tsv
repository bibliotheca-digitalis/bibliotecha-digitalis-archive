0	3960	Hello everyone, and somewhat belatedly, happy 2018.
4760	7600	Today's video is going to be something of a personal one.
7600	15160	A little bit of me talking about myself, a little housekeeping, and a minor mission statement going forward in the next year.
15760	19880	Somewhat of a talky one, this. Not much on the visual side going on here today,
19880	22380	but I figure you're all used to that by now.
22920	28420	So a while back, I made a video talking about a particular sort of person you run into online.
28980	34220	That is young, straight, white guys, usually teenagers or in their early 20s,
34220	42300	who are opposed to feminism and social justice, and who are the primary recruiting target for fascists and white nationalists.
42300	46100	I talked about how they feel left out of current social narratives,
46100	53540	and how the path to fascism and white nationalism for them is a relatively easy one, full of reassurance and simple to understand
53940	56500	racialized answers for all the world's problems.
57100	59820	And I ended that video by posing a question.
60260	64200	What are the best tactics for reaching these people before they become...
64720	66720	red-pilled, as they would say.
67000	70680	Red-pilled is kind of an odd term there from The Matrix,
71020	77360	where protagonist Neo takes a red pill and wakes up to find his existence so far has been a lie,
77620	80860	and the world is actually run by robotic squids.
81380	87220	And the real-world parallel to this, I guess, is waking up to find the world is run by women and minorities
87220	90220	and a nefarious Jewish conspiracy or something.
90620	92100	It's all very silly, of course.
92420	97380	Now, why these people chose to pilfer their metaphors from a story written by two trans women
97380	103060	in which a white internet nerd learns the truth about society from a black man kind of escapes me, really.
103420	105420	But regardless, the question.
105620	107620	What can we do to reach these guys
107940	114980	before they fall down the suggested videos rabbit hole and end up watching and agreeing with blatant white nationalist propaganda?
114980	119300	You know, you're watching Sargon of Akkad one minute, and then a few auto-plays later,
119300	121300	you're listening to Richard Spencer.
121580	129020	And anyone who spends a significant amount of time listening to people like Sargon is going to be very ill-equipped to argue against white nationalism,
129020	131520	as indeed Sargon himself is.
131720	137760	There's a reason that Richard Spencer considers people like Sargon to be good entry points to fascism.
137760	141840	It's because they peddle the same alarmist nonsense that he does.
142300	148760	Even if they wouldn't go so far as to describe themselves as fascists or start throwing Hitler salutes or something,
148840	153040	they're still training their audiences to respond to white nationalist arguments.
153040	160920	And it's a relatively simple progression to go from someone like Sargon who complains constantly about women and immigrants and progressives,
161520	164800	social justice warriors and leftists in general,
165240	169280	to someone like Spencer who simply agrees with all of that and says,
169280	173080	well, maybe us white men should start doing something about it.
173080	176880	I'm also going to be talking about my own experience with politics online.
177520	179280	In the video I mentioned earlier,
179280	185720	I briefly noted that I used to be one of the people I was describing, and I hope obviously I'm not anymore.
186320	190200	So maybe there's an answer hidden somewhere in my own experiences.
190200	195220	You know, I was fortunate enough to break out of that alarmist feedback loop early on,
195400	200880	so maybe by thinking about that a little, we can come up with a few pointers for breaking other people out of it.
200920	206480	But first, I guess I should give my elevator pitch for reaching out to these people in the first place.
206680	212040	And I have a three-pronged argument here. First up is the standard Mr. Rogers,
212080	218480	let's all hold hands and get along thing, you know. If we all work together, we can do anything, all that good stuff.
218960	223120	But more interesting and immediate though, let's talk tactics.
223240	229600	Now, we lefty social justice types understand social concepts like power and privilege.
229960	233280	Now, there's a reason that straight white men, like me,
233800	239600	tend to do better on social media, YouTube, and so on, with viewing figures and reach.
239720	244080	And it's because I have a privilege there not afforded to other sorts of people,
244440	246920	even if they're saying the exact same things I am.
247200	251920	And all I can do about that is acknowledge it and try to put it to some good use, I suppose.
252160	254160	So this is my second point.
254600	258720	Straight white cis male voices are amplified right now.
258720	264200	And that's obviously something we should work on changing, of course, by boosting the voices of other people.
264720	268000	However, with regards to the sorts of people I'm talking about,
268400	273200	they're far more likely to initially respond to straight white male voices.
273440	280000	You know, they've mostly already been conditioned against listening to what LGBT people and people of color
280000	283000	and other social minorities have to say about things.
283520	287680	So straight white guys are probably our biggest in with that crowd.
287960	290520	And my third point is also a tactical one.
290840	294160	In a voting habits, political wing sense,
294440	300680	straight white guys are far more likely to fall in the conservative right-wing camp than other sorts of people.
300840	306520	If you can reach people in this demographic and introduce a little nuance and perspective into their worldview,
306520	311000	you won't only have gained an ally, you'll have neutralized a potential opponent.
311480	314960	You know, just looking at the numbers there, it makes good sense.
315360	319680	However, a little clarification before I start doling out advice here.
319960	326360	I'm talking specifically to those people in the audience who have already decided that reaching out to these people is a good idea.
327040	330600	I'm not saying everyone has to spend their time and energy doing this,
330600	335280	because obviously a lot of these kids are not coming as open-minded neutral parties
335280	338520	who just need a kind word to nudge them in the right direction.
339080	344280	They're often coming as belligerent little shits who'll throw a tantrum and spam you with insults.
344520	347400	Now obviously, nobody should have to deal with that.
347400	352680	So if it's your own decision to shut these people out, that's understandable and fair enough.
353000	357560	And this is partially why white guys are best situated to reach out to these people, I guess.
357560	363400	They've got considerably fewer insults at hand when they're dealing with people who they feel are like themselves.
363640	369880	And speaking of belligerent little shits, I'll now paint a picture of myself about ten years ago,
369880	373320	when I was a teenager heading off to university.
373720	375880	There I am there. How cute.
375880	380680	Now I was, and am, I suppose, a straight white cis guy.
380840	385960	So top of the privilege heap in all of those regards, but relatively poor.
385960	388280	So there was an economic pressure there.
388280	392360	And like a lot of teenagers, I was insecure, unsure of myself,
393160	397240	prone to bouts of sadness and uncontrollable emotions and so on.
397240	402600	So to me at the time, anyone suggesting I was personally privileged in any regard
402600	404600	would have been dismissed out of hand.
404600	407320	You know, I didn't understand the wider context there,
407320	412040	or know enough about society or history to comprehend that concept.
412040	414600	All I knew were my own experiences.
414600	421400	I frequently felt sad, lonely, jealous, small, and I was broke all the time.
421400	426520	So being a straight white guy clearly isn't privileging me in any real way, I would have said.
426520	430440	Now my political views at the time were in the path of least resistance
430440	434200	towards not having to think about the problem anymore vein.
434200	436760	You know, I didn't identify as a bigot in any way.
437320	440280	And I would have staunchly denied that if accused.
440280	443800	But that didn't stop me from saying and thinking things like,
443800	446440	sexism ended when women got the vote,
446440	450760	and all races are equal under the law now so there's no discrimination anymore.
450760	452280	You know, things like that.
452280	456680	I was bigoted from passive ignorance rather than active hatred,
456680	458840	but bigoted all the same.
458840	463720	If I was asked if women were the equal of men, I would have said yes, of course they are.
463720	468920	And they have the same legal rights as men, and therefore feminism is outdated now.
468920	474840	You know, feminists are just fringe lunatics who want women to rule over men or whatever.
474840	480280	That was the idea of feminism that I'd picked up just from general cultural osmosis
480280	482680	without having put any real thought into it.
482680	489160	I was also an early fan of the atheists debunking creationism videos here online.
489160	494440	It made me feel smart to see someone dismantling someone else's beliefs like that.
494440	498440	Even though obviously looking back, debunking creationism is relatively easy
498440	500600	and doesn't really require all that much effort.
501160	504040	You see, my one point of pride at the time,
504040	507880	falsely held, I later came to realize, was my intelligence.
508520	513480	You know, I might be broke and lonely and bored, but I'm smart.
513480	515800	You know, I'm smarter than my parents,
515800	519560	I'm smarter than my teachers and peers and friends
520120	525240	and the girls who won't go out with me and the creationists and the feminists.
525240	527800	You know, I'm the best at that one thing.
527800	529160	That's what I get to have.
529720	534440	And I responded positively to anything that made me feel smarter than other people.
534440	538280	Now, staking everything on one aspect of your personality like that
538280	541320	is setting yourself up for a fall, obviously.
541320	545560	And I'm very lucky that YouTube didn't exist in its current form back then,
545560	549320	as I was exactly the sort of person who, desperate for validation,
549320	553000	would have followed the breadcrumb trail of laughing at creationists
553000	554840	to laughing at feminists
554840	558760	to laughing at just the left and social justice in general.
559400	562600	I'd be just another Sargon fan, probably.
562600	566200	And the constant laughing at feminists would become, over time,
566200	571880	believing in some feminist social justice warrior conspiracy to take over society.
572520	577160	And then we're doing something brave and transgressive in laughing at feminists online.
577160	581960	We're saving Western civilization from the zombie SJW hordes.
582680	587720	Now, it's silly, but it's an attractive narrative for a bored and lonely young man
587720	592440	who needs something to believe in and a community he feels he belongs to.
592440	597080	My initial first-hand experience of feminism and social justice
597080	599320	came on the Something Awful forums.
600200	604360	Something Awful, for the uninitiated, is a paid internet forum.
604360	607160	That is, you pay to sign up and be able to post,
607160	611400	and if you break the rules and get banned, you have to pay again to get back in.
612200	615320	Now, I was a very active SA poster back in the day
615320	618200	and would spend a lot of my free time reading the threads
618200	619960	in their debate and discussion forum.
620680	623960	SA's payment on sign-up meant that the level of discourse
623960	626360	was a little bit higher than elsewhere online.
626920	629400	Obviously, kids without access to a credit card
629400	631480	couldn't sign up and spam a bunch of nonsense.
632280	634360	And compared to the rest of the internet, anyway,
634360	637080	the moderation is fairly quick and active.
637080	642040	Not that there aren't racists, fascists, etc. on the SA forums,
642040	645000	because there are, but they generally have to be smart
645000	648440	in flying under the radar to not get their accounts banned.
648440	652680	It's a bit like a scaled-down version of what we have on Twitter and YouTube today,
652680	655800	with cryptos trying to pander to the fascist crowd
655800	658600	without going too far and getting themselves shut down.
659480	663640	On the whole, though, something awful was pretty progressive.
663640	669240	Now, one thread I frequented rather regularly was the feminism mega-thread.
669240	673400	I first clicked on this thread not as some open-minded youngster
673400	676040	looking to learn more about what feminism was.
676040	679480	You know, I clicked on it in order to laugh at the crazy feminists
679480	680920	and their silly beliefs.
680920	685160	And instead, what I found there was absolutely terrifying.
685640	691240	It was a group of women talking about things uninterrupted by men.
691240	694120	You know, sometimes they'd even talk about men
694120	695960	and the annoying things that men do.
696520	701560	And I can't imagine a scarier scenario for a fragile young man
701560	706200	than to be a fly on the wall as a group of women discuss male shortcomings.
706200	708760	Now, the most embarrassing moments for me
708760	713000	were when they would discuss a behavior that I knew I'd taken part in in the past.
713560	716920	Until then, if asked if women were the equal of men, as I mentioned before,
716920	721160	I would have said yes, but I wouldn't have necessarily believed it,
721160	723400	you know, deep down and subconsciously.
723960	727560	And confronted with the reality of women being able to understand things
727560	732440	just as well as me, or even worse, being able to understand things better than me,
732440	735720	to be thinking things unthought by me,
735720	739400	and to be judging me for my behavior based on a set of rules
739400	741640	I could not see or understand.
741720	743080	You know, it's a horror.
743080	745640	It was a direct challenge to my intelligence,
745640	748440	which was by far the main pillar of my identity,
748440	750360	and I reacted as you'd expect,
751240	756440	by calmly accepting their arguments and modifying my behavior going forward.
757640	758760	Just kidding, of course.
758760	761400	I rejected it all outright, obviously.
762360	764120	However, from then on,
764120	767960	I started paying more attention to my interactions with women.
768600	769720	I couldn't help it.
769720	772600	You know, the ideas were in my head at that point,
772600	777560	and I'd noticed myself doing things that the women in the thread would criticize,
777560	779560	and I started to think to myself, you know,
779560	784200	maybe I am faster to start explaining something to a woman than to a man.
784840	788360	Maybe I do unconsciously assume men are more competent.
789000	792040	You know, how many times have I just sat there going on at some woman
792040	795800	about something she knew more than me about while she just smiled politely?
796600	800840	And even thinking about it now, writing this years later,
800840	802680	it makes me cringe, honestly.
802680	806200	It took me a long time to come to terms with all this, obviously.
806200	809960	I changed my opinion slowly and piece by piece,
809960	813640	and it seems odd that such a small thing as clicking on a forum thread
813640	817640	could have been the catalyst for such a big change in my political outlook,
817640	818200	but it was.
818760	821960	I kept reading that thread and the arguments they had
821960	823960	and read the authors they suggested.
824520	826200	I didn't agree with everything I read,
827000	829000	certainly not at the beginning anyway,
829000	832200	but what I did agree with made good sense to me.
832200	836520	The illusion of the feminists as fringe lunatics had been shattered.
836520	838120	So my first note here,
838120	842360	personal change often happens privately over time,
842360	843400	behind the scenes.
843960	846120	If you can get the ideas out there,
846120	847720	and they're the right ideas, of course,
847720	850040	they'll grow and bear fruit over time.
850680	854520	So don't get disheartened if you can't reach someone right away.
854520	855960	It might take them months,
855960	857960	or in my case it was years,
857960	860120	to talk themselves around to it.
860120	863960	And that's often the case with people who think they're smarter than they are.
863960	866680	They have to wait a while so they can con themselves
866680	869720	into thinking they changed their own mind, you know?
869720	872840	And the second point I want to mention about that feminism thread
872840	875800	is that it was not by any means a hive mind.
875800	879560	It was actually full of very lively and sometimes very rowdy
879560	880200	arguments.
881080	885240	There were lots of different kinds of feminists arguing for different things,
885240	889000	and that by itself can be illuminating to come into contact with.
889000	892040	It's easy to caricature a political opponent
892040	896280	by being very selective in what of them you present to your audience.
896280	899400	A lot of the fans of various anti-feminist YouTubers
899400	902200	will not even be aware that in-group disagreements
902200	906280	happen between feminists or what they would call SJWs.
906280	909960	They'll be working with the anti-feminist group definitions,
909960	913640	which say all feminists and SJWs are in lockstep
913640	917400	and are fairly represented by the fringe annoying people
917400	919080	contained within each group.
919080	923880	Presenting a united front against that can be counterproductive, I feel.
923880	927240	So I'm here going to acknowledge the various annoying things
927240	929560	about feminism and social justice online.
930200	931800	In my opinion, I should say.
932520	937000	First off, there are the trans-exclusionary radical feminists.
937000	940600	That's transphobic people who call themselves feminists,
940600	945160	but are much more interested in using feminism as a shield to hide behind
945160	947240	while they attack trans people.
947240	948760	I'm not a fan of them at all.
949320	953240	There are certain, what I guess you could call liberal feminists,
953240	956520	who see feminism as mindless veneration of women.
957160	960840	You know, people who'll celebrate Margaret Thatcher or whoever else
960840	963000	just because they happened to be a woman.
963640	967640	There are some male feminists who are just claiming to be so to get laid.
968200	970600	There are racist feminists.
970600	973080	Feminists who attack sex workers.
973080	978280	The very rare, in earnest, all-sexes-rape-kill-all-men extremist.
978280	981880	And of course, there are people who are maybe just having a bad day,
981880	985000	who do something embarrassing or cringe-worthy in public
985000	987400	and get recorded and meme-ified.
987400	989080	All these people do exist.
989880	991720	And if I or anyone else wanted to,
991720	994920	they could cherry-pick examples out of those groups all day,
994920	997800	strip off all the labels except feminist,
997800	1001320	and make a very lucrative YouTube channel making fun of them.
1001320	1005640	The truth though, for me anyway, just speaking for myself here,
1005640	1009560	is that none of those groups fairly represent what feminism is.
1010280	1014440	I mention them here to say to any fans of anti-feminist YouTubers who are watching,
1015160	1020520	Yes, I get that those people exist, but they're not nearly every feminist.
1020520	1021560	They're a minority.
1022120	1026280	Feminists are actually a diverse grouping of people all with different opinions,
1026280	1028440	not some monolithic hive mind.
1028440	1030200	And this leads me to my next point.
1030760	1036120	As far as possible, when attempting to reach the demographic I'm talking about anyway,
1036120	1037800	avoid using labels.
1038520	1041560	Now I never call myself a feminist for a couple of reasons,
1041560	1045640	the first being that I don't think I should self-apply that identity,
1045640	1051800	but also because it's very easy online to get mired in discussion of what particular labels mean,
1051800	1053800	like I did just a minute ago.
1053800	1057800	And then you never get around to discussing the ideas behind those labels.
1057800	1062520	These young white guys have been pre-programmed to laugh and open up the memes folder
1062520	1065560	when they see words like feminist or socialist,
1065560	1069480	even if they're working with a false picture of what it is they're attacking.
1069480	1073320	And worse is if they don't recognize the political labels you're using,
1073320	1077640	because that makes them feel unintelligent, which is the worst thing of all.
1077640	1082040	You know, better is to pitch them ideas phrased as simply as possible,
1082040	1086920	and also that seem devoid of any particular identity or allegiance.
1086920	1091640	Now do I think that's a sustainable long-term strategy for building political bridges?
1092520	1093080	No.
1093080	1095720	Ultimately you do need labels to define things.
1096360	1099000	I'm strictly talking icebreakers here.
1099000	1102760	You know, just trying to land a couple of sticky arguments in their minds,
1102760	1106280	and then hopefully leaving them to do the rest.
1106280	1112360	As an example here, you can have the socialism versus capitalism debate online all day,
1112360	1114760	but you'll always run into the same problem.
1115480	1117240	In a room with ten people in it,
1117240	1121560	you'll be working with seven different definitions of what socialism means,
1121560	1127400	from modern European-style social democracies all the way to Stalinist Russia.
1127640	1132040	Perhaps more effective to our specific audience here anyway,
1132040	1135880	is to simply point out problems with our current economic system.
1136520	1141240	It's very hard to argue against the fact that capitalism should be criticized.
1141240	1144680	We don't need to compare it to anything else to do that either.
1144680	1146600	It has flaws all on its own.
1147240	1152200	And just getting certain people used to the idea that capitalism is not perfect,
1152200	1154840	and can be criticized, is enough.
1154840	1156040	For now anyway.
1156040	1159560	Either they'll do the rest themselves, in which case great,
1159560	1162920	or at the very least they'll be less heated opponents.
1162920	1168040	Now this is, of course, the same tactic the smarter members of the alt-right
1168040	1172120	are currently engaged in, arguing the concept of race realism,
1172120	1176680	which is their in vogue euphemism for racism but acceptable.
1176680	1178840	They're trying to get whoever will listen
1178840	1183000	used to the idea of classifying and organizing people by race.
1183000	1186040	And that's the Trojan horse for their real argument,
1186040	1189960	which is therefore it's okay to discriminate against people.
1190680	1195400	They're repackaging their arguments to be more attractive to the average person.
1195400	1198280	And we should not shy away from doing the same.
1198280	1202280	Now the difference here is that I will just freely admit to doing that.
1202280	1203960	You know, yes, that's what I'm doing.
1204600	1210280	I'm using words and arguments and rhetoric to try to change people's minds.
1210840	1215880	You know, there's no 4chan plotting or secret discord organizing necessary here.
1216440	1218520	I want to change people's minds.
1218520	1221480	I'm hoping people will be appreciative of that honesty
1221480	1224680	instead of seeing it as maliciously manipulative or something.
1225480	1228680	So about that 4chan plotting there,
1228680	1230760	this ties into my next piece of advice,
1230760	1233960	which seems rather obvious, I guess, but anyway, here it is.
1234920	1236520	Don't fall into traps.
1237480	1240920	And I want to talk about the It's Okay To Be White campaign here,
1240920	1245000	which credit where credit's due is a clever bit of manipulation.
1245000	1247880	It exploited both a liberal blind spot
1247880	1251400	and the media's love of anything racially charged.
1251400	1255480	Now I understand the arguments against the It's Okay To Be White slogan.
1255480	1259960	At firstly, it was obviously initiated by white nationalists,
1259960	1261960	which should be a bit of a tip-off.
1261960	1264760	You know, even if you don't have a problem with the slogan,
1264760	1268360	you should probably wonder where it's coming from and why.
1268360	1272760	Secondly, white nationalism is harmful to white identities.
1272760	1276760	There are lots of different groups of white people all with their own histories,
1276760	1280200	and white nationalists strip away all of the specifics
1280200	1283320	and just stamp the label white over everything.
1283960	1290040	It's Okay To Be White normalizes this idea of identifying as simply white.
1290840	1296920	Also, saying It's Okay To Be White as a statement implies an attack on whiteness
1296920	1300680	that necessitates the statement being said in the first place.
1300680	1305000	You know, it legitimizes the idea that white people are somehow under attack.
1305560	1309000	It's difficult to get all of this into a tweet, however.
1309000	1313240	The bad thing to do is to try to cleverly flip the slogan back on them.
1313240	1314840	It's Not Okay To Be White.
1315640	1318840	Even if you follow that up with a truckload of explanation,
1318840	1320920	it's gonna get clipped out of context.
1320920	1322760	And that's what they want, after all.
1322760	1325400	All we need is a couple of people to say that,
1325400	1329240	a few university professors to fumble their words in response,
1329240	1332120	and the people who came up with this thing will feel validated.
1332120	1334600	We're just handing them ammo at that point.
1334600	1338200	The only way to neutralize something like this is to explain it.
1338200	1341240	You know, here's where it came from, here's who shared it,
1341240	1343160	here's what they're aiming to achieve with it.
1343800	1348520	Don't engage with it directly in the way they want you to, please.
1348520	1351800	You know, don't let them define the boundaries of the argument.
1352360	1354760	When you see something like this in future,
1354760	1356840	and there will be something like this in future,
1357400	1359240	don't engage with it face-on.
1359240	1362440	Just pull back a bit and explain what's going on.
1362440	1365320	Now, as well as not falling into the alt-right traps,
1365880	1371160	there are a few behaviors you see on the left that aren't going to go over well
1371160	1374120	with the particular demographic I'm talking about.
1374120	1377000	Now, speaking as a straight white cis man,
1377880	1379800	it's the best start to any sentence there,
1380600	1384200	jokes about white people and straight people and cis people,
1384200	1387400	which you do see occasionally, don't really bother me.
1388040	1390440	Because to me, it's a triviality.
1390440	1393640	You know, my feelings can't really be hurt there for a few reasons.
1394440	1398200	Firstly, because I don't really peg my self-worth to any of those labels.
1398200	1402760	But secondly, because making fun of cis people or straight people or whatever
1402760	1406920	carries as much relative weight to mocking trans people or gay people
1407000	1409960	as mocking Capricorns say,
1409960	1413160	there's no power or threat looming behind the words.
1413720	1416120	But that's just how I see it now.
1416120	1420120	You know, it took me a long time to come around to that way of thinking.
1420120	1423400	This sort of thing leaves a lot of straight white cis guys
1423400	1426840	feeling an object of ridicule, you know, shut out in the cold.
1426840	1430760	It says, you're my enemy, and you can't understand me,
1430760	1432360	and don't even bother trying.
1433080	1437240	Now, I'm not even necessarily asking anyone to change this behavior.
1437240	1440040	Again, I'm addressing people who've already settled
1440040	1441880	on trying to appeal to this demographic.
1442520	1446920	But I am worried about the implications of shutting the door on these kids.
1446920	1449160	You know, you never hear anyone say,
1449160	1453560	it's not my job to educate you about white nationalism, do you?
1453560	1455960	They're clamoring to talk to anyone who'll listen.
1456760	1459400	And of course, unless you happen to be a teacher,
1460040	1463640	it's not your job to educate anyone about anything,
1463640	1466680	especially if they're being a particularly hostile student.
1467640	1473080	But we do need that educating to be done by someone, eventually.
1473080	1477080	And if they won't do it themselves, then it will have to be someone else.
1477960	1482920	On YouTube, it's easy for me and others to simply tear down their idols.
1482920	1488840	Anti-feminist and alt-right YouTubers require little additional effort to make look silly.
1488840	1493320	And I have had a lot of people reach out to me to say my videos pointing out the errors
1493320	1497720	in the arguments of Molyneux or Sargon or whoever else
1497720	1500200	led them to reconsider their politics.
1500200	1503320	So there is value in that, and I am going to keep doing it.
1503960	1507080	But there's also a chance right now for me and other creators
1507080	1509880	to establish our own narrative here on YouTube,
1509880	1513160	you know, rather than just reacting to someone else's.
1513160	1517080	Too many creators on YouTube, whatever their politics,
1517080	1522600	I'm not naming any names here, tend to get hung up responding to just one individual
1522600	1527480	out of some personal vendetta, however justified they have against them.
1528040	1531000	And that really isn't the best use of our time.
1531000	1535800	Even if you make the perfect video which completely disgraces some anti-feminist
1535800	1538440	or whoever else in the eyes of their followers,
1538440	1541000	they'll just be replaced by someone else tomorrow.
1541560	1545000	The desire for their type of content still exists,
1545080	1549240	regardless of what they do as individuals, and that's the real problem.
1549800	1555400	However, the desire is also clearly there for more leftist voices on the platform.
1555400	1557880	So I'll repeat my call from a while back.
1557880	1561560	If you want to get started, now is a great time.
1561560	1564520	Over the course of the next few years in particular,
1564520	1567880	leftist YouTube is going to grow massively.
1567880	1570200	So make a video and share it.
1570200	1571560	It's a lot of fun.
1571560	1574840	So this is going to be my plan going forward in 2018.
1575640	1580040	More political videos that approach various topics from the left
1580040	1583160	with the aim of building up a library of material there,
1583960	1586280	lure them in with the debunking videos,
1586280	1591160	and then the suggested video feature hits them with a lecture about privatization or something.
1591960	1596360	That's my sneaky plan, which I've just given away, I realize.
1597000	1600520	Thanks a lot for watching this meandering mess, folks.
1600520	1604520	It's a bit of an odd video today, but my patrons wanted to see it,
1604520	1607480	and I'm willingly a slave to their desires.
1607480	1610280	I hope there was something you were able to take from it, at least.
1611080	1614600	Now, don't worry if you're someone who cannot spare the mental energy
1614600	1617960	to attempt to appeal to the demographic I've been talking about.
1617960	1622760	If you're someone the alt-right hates by virtue of whatever you happen to be,
1622760	1628120	simply existing and being awesome is a good counterargument in and of itself.
1628120	1629800	And a final note here.
1629800	1632920	Intersectionality is really important.
1632920	1637240	Where the alt-right break people into small groups, we should bring them together.
1637800	1640360	And then we'll definitely have them beat on the numbers, at least.
1640920	1645000	So, uh, be intersectional, I guess is my last bit of advice.
1645880	1649240	Thanks, as always, to all my supporters over on Patreon.
1649240	1651640	Have you noticed the new credits, by the way?
1651640	1654200	We have new credits now by Jen.
1654200	1657240	This should solve the problem with the scrolling, hopefully.
1657560	1659000	And here's how they work.
1659000	1663400	If you pledge at the credits tier, then the month after your pledge began,
1663400	1665880	you'll start appearing in the credits of videos.
1665880	1669480	So everyone who pledged at the credits tier after I created it,
1669480	1672040	your name will start appearing in next month's videos.
1672600	1675000	This is to stop people pledging with a silly name
1675000	1677560	and then dropping out before the end of the month, you see.
1677560	1678520	I've had a few of those.
1679480	1683160	Okay, folks, thanks a lot for watching, and I'll see you next time.
