00:00.000 --> 00:03.960
Hello everyone, and somewhat belatedly, happy 2018.

00:04.760 --> 00:07.600
Today's video is going to be something of a personal one.

00:07.600 --> 00:15.160
A little bit of me talking about myself, a little housekeeping, and a minor mission statement going forward in the next year.

00:15.760 --> 00:19.880
Somewhat of a talky one, this. Not much on the visual side going on here today,

00:19.880 --> 00:22.380
but I figure you're all used to that by now.

00:22.920 --> 00:28.420
So a while back, I made a video talking about a particular sort of person you run into online.

00:28.980 --> 00:34.220
That is young, straight, white guys, usually teenagers or in their early 20s,

00:34.220 --> 00:42.300
who are opposed to feminism and social justice, and who are the primary recruiting target for fascists and white nationalists.

00:42.300 --> 00:46.100
I talked about how they feel left out of current social narratives,

00:46.100 --> 00:53.540
and how the path to fascism and white nationalism for them is a relatively easy one, full of reassurance and simple to understand

00:53.940 --> 00:56.500
racialized answers for all the world's problems.

00:57.100 --> 00:59.820
And I ended that video by posing a question.

01:00.260 --> 01:04.200
What are the best tactics for reaching these people before they become...

01:04.720 --> 01:06.720
red-pilled, as they would say.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.680
Red-pilled is kind of an odd term there from The Matrix,

01:11.020 --> 01:17.360
where protagonist Neo takes a red pill and wakes up to find his existence so far has been a lie,

01:17.620 --> 01:20.860
and the world is actually run by robotic squids.

01:21.380 --> 01:27.220
And the real-world parallel to this, I guess, is waking up to find the world is run by women and minorities

01:27.220 --> 01:30.220
and a nefarious Jewish conspiracy or something.

01:30.620 --> 01:32.100
It's all very silly, of course.

01:32.420 --> 01:37.380
Now, why these people chose to pilfer their metaphors from a story written by two trans women

01:37.380 --> 01:43.060
in which a white internet nerd learns the truth about society from a black man kind of escapes me, really.

01:43.420 --> 01:45.420
But regardless, the question.

01:45.620 --> 01:47.620
What can we do to reach these guys

01:47.940 --> 01:54.980
before they fall down the suggested videos rabbit hole and end up watching and agreeing with blatant white nationalist propaganda?

01:54.980 --> 01:59.300
You know, you're watching Sargon of Akkad one minute, and then a few auto-plays later,

01:59.300 --> 02:01.300
you're listening to Richard Spencer.

02:01.580 --> 02:09.020
And anyone who spends a significant amount of time listening to people like Sargon is going to be very ill-equipped to argue against white nationalism,

02:09.020 --> 02:11.520
as indeed Sargon himself is.

02:11.720 --> 02:17.760
There's a reason that Richard Spencer considers people like Sargon to be good entry points to fascism.

02:17.760 --> 02:21.840
It's because they peddle the same alarmist nonsense that he does.

02:22.300 --> 02:28.760
Even if they wouldn't go so far as to describe themselves as fascists or start throwing Hitler salutes or something,

02:28.840 --> 02:33.040
they're still training their audiences to respond to white nationalist arguments.

02:33.040 --> 02:40.920
And it's a relatively simple progression to go from someone like Sargon who complains constantly about women and immigrants and progressives,

02:41.520 --> 02:44.800
social justice warriors and leftists in general,

02:45.240 --> 02:49.280
to someone like Spencer who simply agrees with all of that and says,

02:49.280 --> 02:53.080
well, maybe us white men should start doing something about it.

02:53.080 --> 02:56.880
I'm also going to be talking about my own experience with politics online.

02:57.520 --> 02:59.280
In the video I mentioned earlier,

02:59.280 --> 03:05.720
I briefly noted that I used to be one of the people I was describing, and I hope obviously I'm not anymore.

03:06.320 --> 03:10.200
So maybe there's an answer hidden somewhere in my own experiences.

03:10.200 --> 03:15.220
You know, I was fortunate enough to break out of that alarmist feedback loop early on,

03:15.400 --> 03:20.880
so maybe by thinking about that a little, we can come up with a few pointers for breaking other people out of it.

03:20.920 --> 03:26.480
But first, I guess I should give my elevator pitch for reaching out to these people in the first place.

03:26.680 --> 03:32.040
And I have a three-pronged argument here. First up is the standard Mr. Rogers,

03:32.080 --> 03:38.480
let's all hold hands and get along thing, you know. If we all work together, we can do anything, all that good stuff.

03:38.960 --> 03:43.120
But more interesting and immediate though, let's talk tactics.

03:43.240 --> 03:49.600
Now, we lefty social justice types understand social concepts like power and privilege.

03:49.960 --> 03:53.280
Now, there's a reason that straight white men, like me,

03:53.800 --> 03:59.600
tend to do better on social media, YouTube, and so on, with viewing figures and reach.

03:59.720 --> 04:04.080
And it's because I have a privilege there not afforded to other sorts of people,

04:04.440 --> 04:06.920
even if they're saying the exact same things I am.

04:07.200 --> 04:11.920
And all I can do about that is acknowledge it and try to put it to some good use, I suppose.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.160
So this is my second point.

04:14.600 --> 04:18.720
Straight white cis male voices are amplified right now.

04:18.720 --> 04:24.200
And that's obviously something we should work on changing, of course, by boosting the voices of other people.

04:24.720 --> 04:28.000
However, with regards to the sorts of people I'm talking about,

04:28.400 --> 04:33.200
they're far more likely to initially respond to straight white male voices.

04:33.440 --> 04:40.000
You know, they've mostly already been conditioned against listening to what LGBT people and people of color

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
and other social minorities have to say about things.

04:43.520 --> 04:47.680
So straight white guys are probably our biggest in with that crowd.

04:47.960 --> 04:50.520
And my third point is also a tactical one.

04:50.840 --> 04:54.160
In a voting habits, political wing sense,

04:54.440 --> 05:00.680
straight white guys are far more likely to fall in the conservative right-wing camp than other sorts of people.

05:00.840 --> 05:06.520
If you can reach people in this demographic and introduce a little nuance and perspective into their worldview,

05:06.520 --> 05:11.000
you won't only have gained an ally, you'll have neutralized a potential opponent.

05:11.480 --> 05:14.960
You know, just looking at the numbers there, it makes good sense.

05:15.360 --> 05:19.680
However, a little clarification before I start doling out advice here.

05:19.960 --> 05:26.360
I'm talking specifically to those people in the audience who have already decided that reaching out to these people is a good idea.

05:27.040 --> 05:30.600
I'm not saying everyone has to spend their time and energy doing this,

05:30.600 --> 05:35.280
because obviously a lot of these kids are not coming as open-minded neutral parties

05:35.280 --> 05:38.520
who just need a kind word to nudge them in the right direction.

05:39.080 --> 05:44.280
They're often coming as belligerent little shits who'll throw a tantrum and spam you with insults.

05:44.520 --> 05:47.400
Now obviously, nobody should have to deal with that.

05:47.400 --> 05:52.680
So if it's your own decision to shut these people out, that's understandable and fair enough.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.560
And this is partially why white guys are best situated to reach out to these people, I guess.

05:57.560 --> 06:03.400
They've got considerably fewer insults at hand when they're dealing with people who they feel are like themselves.

06:03.640 --> 06:09.880
And speaking of belligerent little shits, I'll now paint a picture of myself about ten years ago,

06:09.880 --> 06:13.320
when I was a teenager heading off to university.

06:13.720 --> 06:15.880
There I am there. How cute.

06:15.880 --> 06:20.680
Now I was, and am, I suppose, a straight white cis guy.

06:20.840 --> 06:25.960
So top of the privilege heap in all of those regards, but relatively poor.

06:25.960 --> 06:28.280
So there was an economic pressure there.

06:28.280 --> 06:32.360
And like a lot of teenagers, I was insecure, unsure of myself,

06:33.160 --> 06:37.240
prone to bouts of sadness and uncontrollable emotions and so on.

06:37.240 --> 06:42.600
So to me at the time, anyone suggesting I was personally privileged in any regard

06:42.600 --> 06:44.600
would have been dismissed out of hand.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.320
You know, I didn't understand the wider context there,

06:47.320 --> 06:52.040
or know enough about society or history to comprehend that concept.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.600
All I knew were my own experiences.

06:54.600 --> 07:01.400
I frequently felt sad, lonely, jealous, small, and I was broke all the time.

07:01.400 --> 07:06.520
So being a straight white guy clearly isn't privileging me in any real way, I would have said.

07:06.520 --> 07:10.440
Now my political views at the time were in the path of least resistance

07:10.440 --> 07:14.200
towards not having to think about the problem anymore vein.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.760
You know, I didn't identify as a bigot in any way.

07:17.320 --> 07:20.280
And I would have staunchly denied that if accused.

07:20.280 --> 07:23.800
But that didn't stop me from saying and thinking things like,

07:23.800 --> 07:26.440
sexism ended when women got the vote,

07:26.440 --> 07:30.760
and all races are equal under the law now so there's no discrimination anymore.

07:30.760 --> 07:32.280
You know, things like that.

07:32.280 --> 07:36.680
I was bigoted from passive ignorance rather than active hatred,

07:36.680 --> 07:38.840
but bigoted all the same.

07:38.840 --> 07:43.720
If I was asked if women were the equal of men, I would have said yes, of course they are.

07:43.720 --> 07:48.920
And they have the same legal rights as men, and therefore feminism is outdated now.

07:48.920 --> 07:54.840
You know, feminists are just fringe lunatics who want women to rule over men or whatever.

07:54.840 --> 08:00.280
That was the idea of feminism that I'd picked up just from general cultural osmosis

08:00.280 --> 08:02.680
without having put any real thought into it.

08:02.680 --> 08:09.160
I was also an early fan of the atheists debunking creationism videos here online.

08:09.160 --> 08:14.440
It made me feel smart to see someone dismantling someone else's beliefs like that.

08:14.440 --> 08:18.440
Even though obviously looking back, debunking creationism is relatively easy

08:18.440 --> 08:20.600
and doesn't really require all that much effort.

08:21.160 --> 08:24.040
You see, my one point of pride at the time,

08:24.040 --> 08:27.880
falsely held, I later came to realize, was my intelligence.

08:28.520 --> 08:33.480
You know, I might be broke and lonely and bored, but I'm smart.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.800
You know, I'm smarter than my parents,

08:35.800 --> 08:39.560
I'm smarter than my teachers and peers and friends

08:40.120 --> 08:45.240
and the girls who won't go out with me and the creationists and the feminists.

08:45.240 --> 08:47.800
You know, I'm the best at that one thing.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.160
That's what I get to have.

08:49.720 --> 08:54.440
And I responded positively to anything that made me feel smarter than other people.

08:54.440 --> 08:58.280
Now, staking everything on one aspect of your personality like that

08:58.280 --> 09:01.320
is setting yourself up for a fall, obviously.

09:01.320 --> 09:05.560
And I'm very lucky that YouTube didn't exist in its current form back then,

09:05.560 --> 09:09.320
as I was exactly the sort of person who, desperate for validation,

09:09.320 --> 09:13.000
would have followed the breadcrumb trail of laughing at creationists

09:13.000 --> 09:14.840
to laughing at feminists

09:14.840 --> 09:18.760
to laughing at just the left and social justice in general.

09:19.400 --> 09:22.600
I'd be just another Sargon fan, probably.

09:22.600 --> 09:26.200
And the constant laughing at feminists would become, over time,

09:26.200 --> 09:31.880
believing in some feminist social justice warrior conspiracy to take over society.

09:32.520 --> 09:37.160
And then we're doing something brave and transgressive in laughing at feminists online.

09:37.160 --> 09:41.960
We're saving Western civilization from the zombie SJW hordes.

09:42.680 --> 09:47.720
Now, it's silly, but it's an attractive narrative for a bored and lonely young man

09:47.720 --> 09:52.440
who needs something to believe in and a community he feels he belongs to.

09:52.440 --> 09:57.080
My initial first-hand experience of feminism and social justice

09:57.080 --> 09:59.320
came on the Something Awful forums.

10:00.200 --> 10:04.360
Something Awful, for the uninitiated, is a paid internet forum.

10:04.360 --> 10:07.160
That is, you pay to sign up and be able to post,

10:07.160 --> 10:11.400
and if you break the rules and get banned, you have to pay again to get back in.

10:12.200 --> 10:15.320
Now, I was a very active SA poster back in the day

10:15.320 --> 10:18.200
and would spend a lot of my free time reading the threads

10:18.200 --> 10:19.960
in their debate and discussion forum.

10:20.680 --> 10:23.960
SA's payment on sign-up meant that the level of discourse

10:23.960 --> 10:26.360
was a little bit higher than elsewhere online.

10:26.920 --> 10:29.400
Obviously, kids without access to a credit card

10:29.400 --> 10:31.480
couldn't sign up and spam a bunch of nonsense.

10:32.280 --> 10:34.360
And compared to the rest of the internet, anyway,

10:34.360 --> 10:37.080
the moderation is fairly quick and active.

10:37.080 --> 10:42.040
Not that there aren't racists, fascists, etc. on the SA forums,

10:42.040 --> 10:45.000
because there are, but they generally have to be smart

10:45.000 --> 10:48.440
in flying under the radar to not get their accounts banned.

10:48.440 --> 10:52.680
It's a bit like a scaled-down version of what we have on Twitter and YouTube today,

10:52.680 --> 10:55.800
with cryptos trying to pander to the fascist crowd

10:55.800 --> 10:58.600
without going too far and getting themselves shut down.

10:59.480 --> 11:03.640
On the whole, though, something awful was pretty progressive.

11:03.640 --> 11:09.240
Now, one thread I frequented rather regularly was the feminism mega-thread.

11:09.240 --> 11:13.400
I first clicked on this thread not as some open-minded youngster

11:13.400 --> 11:16.040
looking to learn more about what feminism was.

11:16.040 --> 11:19.480
You know, I clicked on it in order to laugh at the crazy feminists

11:19.480 --> 11:20.920
and their silly beliefs.

11:20.920 --> 11:25.160
And instead, what I found there was absolutely terrifying.

11:25.640 --> 11:31.240
It was a group of women talking about things uninterrupted by men.

11:31.240 --> 11:34.120
You know, sometimes they'd even talk about men

11:34.120 --> 11:35.960
and the annoying things that men do.

11:36.520 --> 11:41.560
And I can't imagine a scarier scenario for a fragile young man

11:41.560 --> 11:46.200
than to be a fly on the wall as a group of women discuss male shortcomings.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.760
Now, the most embarrassing moments for me

11:48.760 --> 11:53.000
were when they would discuss a behavior that I knew I'd taken part in in the past.

11:53.560 --> 11:56.920
Until then, if asked if women were the equal of men, as I mentioned before,

11:56.920 --> 12:01.160
I would have said yes, but I wouldn't have necessarily believed it,

12:01.160 --> 12:03.400
you know, deep down and subconsciously.

12:03.960 --> 12:07.560
And confronted with the reality of women being able to understand things

12:07.560 --> 12:12.440
just as well as me, or even worse, being able to understand things better than me,

12:12.440 --> 12:15.720
to be thinking things unthought by me,

12:15.720 --> 12:19.400
and to be judging me for my behavior based on a set of rules

12:19.400 --> 12:21.640
I could not see or understand.

12:21.720 --> 12:23.080
You know, it's a horror.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.640
It was a direct challenge to my intelligence,

12:25.640 --> 12:28.440
which was by far the main pillar of my identity,

12:28.440 --> 12:30.360
and I reacted as you'd expect,

12:31.240 --> 12:36.440
by calmly accepting their arguments and modifying my behavior going forward.

12:37.640 --> 12:38.760
Just kidding, of course.

12:38.760 --> 12:41.400
I rejected it all outright, obviously.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.120
However, from then on,

12:44.120 --> 12:47.960
I started paying more attention to my interactions with women.

12:48.600 --> 12:49.720
I couldn't help it.

12:49.720 --> 12:52.600
You know, the ideas were in my head at that point,

12:52.600 --> 12:57.560
and I'd noticed myself doing things that the women in the thread would criticize,

12:57.560 --> 12:59.560
and I started to think to myself, you know,

12:59.560 --> 13:04.200
maybe I am faster to start explaining something to a woman than to a man.

13:04.840 --> 13:08.360
Maybe I do unconsciously assume men are more competent.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.040
You know, how many times have I just sat there going on at some woman

13:12.040 --> 13:15.800
about something she knew more than me about while she just smiled politely?

13:16.600 --> 13:20.840
And even thinking about it now, writing this years later,

13:20.840 --> 13:22.680
it makes me cringe, honestly.

13:22.680 --> 13:26.200
It took me a long time to come to terms with all this, obviously.

13:26.200 --> 13:29.960
I changed my opinion slowly and piece by piece,

13:29.960 --> 13:33.640
and it seems odd that such a small thing as clicking on a forum thread

13:33.640 --> 13:37.640
could have been the catalyst for such a big change in my political outlook,

13:37.640 --> 13:38.200
but it was.

13:38.760 --> 13:41.960
I kept reading that thread and the arguments they had

13:41.960 --> 13:43.960
and read the authors they suggested.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.200
I didn't agree with everything I read,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
certainly not at the beginning anyway,

13:49.000 --> 13:52.200
but what I did agree with made good sense to me.

13:52.200 --> 13:56.520
The illusion of the feminists as fringe lunatics had been shattered.

13:56.520 --> 13:58.120
So my first note here,

13:58.120 --> 14:02.360
personal change often happens privately over time,

14:02.360 --> 14:03.400
behind the scenes.

14:03.960 --> 14:06.120
If you can get the ideas out there,

14:06.120 --> 14:07.720
and they're the right ideas, of course,

14:07.720 --> 14:10.040
they'll grow and bear fruit over time.

14:10.680 --> 14:14.520
So don't get disheartened if you can't reach someone right away.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.960
It might take them months,

14:15.960 --> 14:17.960
or in my case it was years,

14:17.960 --> 14:20.120
to talk themselves around to it.

14:20.120 --> 14:23.960
And that's often the case with people who think they're smarter than they are.

14:23.960 --> 14:26.680
They have to wait a while so they can con themselves

14:26.680 --> 14:29.720
into thinking they changed their own mind, you know?

14:29.720 --> 14:32.840
And the second point I want to mention about that feminism thread

14:32.840 --> 14:35.800
is that it was not by any means a hive mind.

14:35.800 --> 14:39.560
It was actually full of very lively and sometimes very rowdy

14:39.560 --> 14:40.200
arguments.

14:41.080 --> 14:45.240
There were lots of different kinds of feminists arguing for different things,

14:45.240 --> 14:49.000
and that by itself can be illuminating to come into contact with.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.040
It's easy to caricature a political opponent

14:52.040 --> 14:56.280
by being very selective in what of them you present to your audience.

14:56.280 --> 14:59.400
A lot of the fans of various anti-feminist YouTubers

14:59.400 --> 15:02.200
will not even be aware that in-group disagreements

15:02.200 --> 15:06.280
happen between feminists or what they would call SJWs.

15:06.280 --> 15:09.960
They'll be working with the anti-feminist group definitions,

15:09.960 --> 15:13.640
which say all feminists and SJWs are in lockstep

15:13.640 --> 15:17.400
and are fairly represented by the fringe annoying people

15:17.400 --> 15:19.080
contained within each group.

15:19.080 --> 15:23.880
Presenting a united front against that can be counterproductive, I feel.

15:23.880 --> 15:27.240
So I'm here going to acknowledge the various annoying things

15:27.240 --> 15:29.560
about feminism and social justice online.

15:30.200 --> 15:31.800
In my opinion, I should say.

15:32.520 --> 15:37.000
First off, there are the trans-exclusionary radical feminists.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.600
That's transphobic people who call themselves feminists,

15:40.600 --> 15:45.160
but are much more interested in using feminism as a shield to hide behind

15:45.160 --> 15:47.240
while they attack trans people.

15:47.240 --> 15:48.760
I'm not a fan of them at all.

15:49.320 --> 15:53.240
There are certain, what I guess you could call liberal feminists,

15:53.240 --> 15:56.520
who see feminism as mindless veneration of women.

15:57.160 --> 16:00.840
You know, people who'll celebrate Margaret Thatcher or whoever else

16:00.840 --> 16:03.000
just because they happened to be a woman.

16:03.640 --> 16:07.640
There are some male feminists who are just claiming to be so to get laid.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.600
There are racist feminists.

16:10.600 --> 16:13.080
Feminists who attack sex workers.

16:13.080 --> 16:18.280
The very rare, in earnest, all-sexes-rape-kill-all-men extremist.

16:18.280 --> 16:21.880
And of course, there are people who are maybe just having a bad day,

16:21.880 --> 16:25.000
who do something embarrassing or cringe-worthy in public

16:25.000 --> 16:27.400
and get recorded and meme-ified.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.080
All these people do exist.

16:29.880 --> 16:31.720
And if I or anyone else wanted to,

16:31.720 --> 16:34.920
they could cherry-pick examples out of those groups all day,

16:34.920 --> 16:37.800
strip off all the labels except feminist,

16:37.800 --> 16:41.320
and make a very lucrative YouTube channel making fun of them.

16:41.320 --> 16:45.640
The truth though, for me anyway, just speaking for myself here,

16:45.640 --> 16:49.560
is that none of those groups fairly represent what feminism is.

16:50.280 --> 16:54.440
I mention them here to say to any fans of anti-feminist YouTubers who are watching,

16:55.160 --> 17:00.520
Yes, I get that those people exist, but they're not nearly every feminist.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.560
They're a minority.

17:02.120 --> 17:06.280
Feminists are actually a diverse grouping of people all with different opinions,

17:06.280 --> 17:08.440
not some monolithic hive mind.

17:08.440 --> 17:10.200
And this leads me to my next point.

17:10.760 --> 17:16.120
As far as possible, when attempting to reach the demographic I'm talking about anyway,

17:16.120 --> 17:17.800
avoid using labels.

17:18.520 --> 17:21.560
Now I never call myself a feminist for a couple of reasons,

17:21.560 --> 17:25.640
the first being that I don't think I should self-apply that identity,

17:25.640 --> 17:31.800
but also because it's very easy online to get mired in discussion of what particular labels mean,

17:31.800 --> 17:33.800
like I did just a minute ago.

17:33.800 --> 17:37.800
And then you never get around to discussing the ideas behind those labels.

17:37.800 --> 17:42.520
These young white guys have been pre-programmed to laugh and open up the memes folder

17:42.520 --> 17:45.560
when they see words like feminist or socialist,

17:45.560 --> 17:49.480
even if they're working with a false picture of what it is they're attacking.

17:49.480 --> 17:53.320
And worse is if they don't recognize the political labels you're using,

17:53.320 --> 17:57.640
because that makes them feel unintelligent, which is the worst thing of all.

17:57.640 --> 18:02.040
You know, better is to pitch them ideas phrased as simply as possible,

18:02.040 --> 18:06.920
and also that seem devoid of any particular identity or allegiance.

18:06.920 --> 18:11.640
Now do I think that's a sustainable long-term strategy for building political bridges?

18:12.520 --> 18:13.080
No.

18:13.080 --> 18:15.720
Ultimately you do need labels to define things.

18:16.360 --> 18:19.000
I'm strictly talking icebreakers here.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.760
You know, just trying to land a couple of sticky arguments in their minds,

18:22.760 --> 18:26.280
and then hopefully leaving them to do the rest.

18:26.280 --> 18:32.360
As an example here, you can have the socialism versus capitalism debate online all day,

18:32.360 --> 18:34.760
but you'll always run into the same problem.

18:35.480 --> 18:37.240
In a room with ten people in it,

18:37.240 --> 18:41.560
you'll be working with seven different definitions of what socialism means,

18:41.560 --> 18:47.400
from modern European-style social democracies all the way to Stalinist Russia.

18:47.640 --> 18:52.040
Perhaps more effective to our specific audience here anyway,

18:52.040 --> 18:55.880
is to simply point out problems with our current economic system.

18:56.520 --> 19:01.240
It's very hard to argue against the fact that capitalism should be criticized.

19:01.240 --> 19:04.680
We don't need to compare it to anything else to do that either.

19:04.680 --> 19:06.600
It has flaws all on its own.

19:07.240 --> 19:12.200
And just getting certain people used to the idea that capitalism is not perfect,

19:12.200 --> 19:14.840
and can be criticized, is enough.

19:14.840 --> 19:16.040
For now anyway.

19:16.040 --> 19:19.560
Either they'll do the rest themselves, in which case great,

19:19.560 --> 19:22.920
or at the very least they'll be less heated opponents.

19:22.920 --> 19:28.040
Now this is, of course, the same tactic the smarter members of the alt-right

19:28.040 --> 19:32.120
are currently engaged in, arguing the concept of race realism,

19:32.120 --> 19:36.680
which is their in vogue euphemism for racism but acceptable.

19:36.680 --> 19:38.840
They're trying to get whoever will listen

19:38.840 --> 19:43.000
used to the idea of classifying and organizing people by race.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.040
And that's the Trojan horse for their real argument,

19:46.040 --> 19:49.960
which is therefore it's okay to discriminate against people.

19:50.680 --> 19:55.400
They're repackaging their arguments to be more attractive to the average person.

19:55.400 --> 19:58.280
And we should not shy away from doing the same.

19:58.280 --> 20:02.280
Now the difference here is that I will just freely admit to doing that.

20:02.280 --> 20:03.960
You know, yes, that's what I'm doing.

20:04.600 --> 20:10.280
I'm using words and arguments and rhetoric to try to change people's minds.

20:10.840 --> 20:15.880
You know, there's no 4chan plotting or secret discord organizing necessary here.

20:16.440 --> 20:18.520
I want to change people's minds.

20:18.520 --> 20:21.480
I'm hoping people will be appreciative of that honesty

20:21.480 --> 20:24.680
instead of seeing it as maliciously manipulative or something.

20:25.480 --> 20:28.680
So about that 4chan plotting there,

20:28.680 --> 20:30.760
this ties into my next piece of advice,

20:30.760 --> 20:33.960
which seems rather obvious, I guess, but anyway, here it is.

20:34.920 --> 20:36.520
Don't fall into traps.

20:37.480 --> 20:40.920
And I want to talk about the It's Okay To Be White campaign here,

20:40.920 --> 20:45.000
which credit where credit's due is a clever bit of manipulation.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.880
It exploited both a liberal blind spot

20:47.880 --> 20:51.400
and the media's love of anything racially charged.

20:51.400 --> 20:55.480
Now I understand the arguments against the It's Okay To Be White slogan.

20:55.480 --> 20:59.960
At firstly, it was obviously initiated by white nationalists,

20:59.960 --> 21:01.960
which should be a bit of a tip-off.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.760
You know, even if you don't have a problem with the slogan,

21:04.760 --> 21:08.360
you should probably wonder where it's coming from and why.

21:08.360 --> 21:12.760
Secondly, white nationalism is harmful to white identities.

21:12.760 --> 21:16.760
There are lots of different groups of white people all with their own histories,

21:16.760 --> 21:20.200
and white nationalists strip away all of the specifics

21:20.200 --> 21:23.320
and just stamp the label white over everything.

21:23.960 --> 21:30.040
It's Okay To Be White normalizes this idea of identifying as simply white.

21:30.840 --> 21:36.920
Also, saying It's Okay To Be White as a statement implies an attack on whiteness

21:36.920 --> 21:40.680
that necessitates the statement being said in the first place.

21:40.680 --> 21:45.000
You know, it legitimizes the idea that white people are somehow under attack.

21:45.560 --> 21:49.000
It's difficult to get all of this into a tweet, however.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.240
The bad thing to do is to try to cleverly flip the slogan back on them.

21:53.240 --> 21:54.840
It's Not Okay To Be White.

21:55.640 --> 21:58.840
Even if you follow that up with a truckload of explanation,

21:58.840 --> 22:00.920
it's gonna get clipped out of context.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.760
And that's what they want, after all.

22:02.760 --> 22:05.400
All we need is a couple of people to say that,

22:05.400 --> 22:09.240
a few university professors to fumble their words in response,

22:09.240 --> 22:12.120
and the people who came up with this thing will feel validated.

22:12.120 --> 22:14.600
We're just handing them ammo at that point.

22:14.600 --> 22:18.200
The only way to neutralize something like this is to explain it.

22:18.200 --> 22:21.240
You know, here's where it came from, here's who shared it,

22:21.240 --> 22:23.160
here's what they're aiming to achieve with it.

22:23.800 --> 22:28.520
Don't engage with it directly in the way they want you to, please.

22:28.520 --> 22:31.800
You know, don't let them define the boundaries of the argument.

22:32.360 --> 22:34.760
When you see something like this in future,

22:34.760 --> 22:36.840
and there will be something like this in future,

22:37.400 --> 22:39.240
don't engage with it face-on.

22:39.240 --> 22:42.440
Just pull back a bit and explain what's going on.

22:42.440 --> 22:45.320
Now, as well as not falling into the alt-right traps,

22:45.880 --> 22:51.160
there are a few behaviors you see on the left that aren't going to go over well

22:51.160 --> 22:54.120
with the particular demographic I'm talking about.

22:54.120 --> 22:57.000
Now, speaking as a straight white cis man,

22:57.880 --> 22:59.800
it's the best start to any sentence there,

23:00.600 --> 23:04.200
jokes about white people and straight people and cis people,

23:04.200 --> 23:07.400
which you do see occasionally, don't really bother me.

23:08.040 --> 23:10.440
Because to me, it's a triviality.

23:10.440 --> 23:13.640
You know, my feelings can't really be hurt there for a few reasons.

23:14.440 --> 23:18.200
Firstly, because I don't really peg my self-worth to any of those labels.

23:18.200 --> 23:22.760
But secondly, because making fun of cis people or straight people or whatever

23:22.760 --> 23:26.920
carries as much relative weight to mocking trans people or gay people

23:27.000 --> 23:29.960
as mocking Capricorns say,

23:29.960 --> 23:33.160
there's no power or threat looming behind the words.

23:33.720 --> 23:36.120
But that's just how I see it now.

23:36.120 --> 23:40.120
You know, it took me a long time to come around to that way of thinking.

23:40.120 --> 23:43.400
This sort of thing leaves a lot of straight white cis guys

23:43.400 --> 23:46.840
feeling an object of ridicule, you know, shut out in the cold.

23:46.840 --> 23:50.760
It says, you're my enemy, and you can't understand me,

23:50.760 --> 23:52.360
and don't even bother trying.

23:53.080 --> 23:57.240
Now, I'm not even necessarily asking anyone to change this behavior.

23:57.240 --> 24:00.040
Again, I'm addressing people who've already settled

24:00.040 --> 24:01.880
on trying to appeal to this demographic.

24:02.520 --> 24:06.920
But I am worried about the implications of shutting the door on these kids.

24:06.920 --> 24:09.160
You know, you never hear anyone say,

24:09.160 --> 24:13.560
it's not my job to educate you about white nationalism, do you?

24:13.560 --> 24:15.960
They're clamoring to talk to anyone who'll listen.

24:16.760 --> 24:19.400
And of course, unless you happen to be a teacher,

24:20.040 --> 24:23.640
it's not your job to educate anyone about anything,

24:23.640 --> 24:26.680
especially if they're being a particularly hostile student.

24:27.640 --> 24:33.080
But we do need that educating to be done by someone, eventually.

24:33.080 --> 24:37.080
And if they won't do it themselves, then it will have to be someone else.

24:37.960 --> 24:42.920
On YouTube, it's easy for me and others to simply tear down their idols.

24:42.920 --> 24:48.840
Anti-feminist and alt-right YouTubers require little additional effort to make look silly.

24:48.840 --> 24:53.320
And I have had a lot of people reach out to me to say my videos pointing out the errors

24:53.320 --> 24:57.720
in the arguments of Molyneux or Sargon or whoever else

24:57.720 --> 25:00.200
led them to reconsider their politics.

25:00.200 --> 25:03.320
So there is value in that, and I am going to keep doing it.

25:03.960 --> 25:07.080
But there's also a chance right now for me and other creators

25:07.080 --> 25:09.880
to establish our own narrative here on YouTube,

25:09.880 --> 25:13.160
you know, rather than just reacting to someone else's.

25:13.160 --> 25:17.080
Too many creators on YouTube, whatever their politics,

25:17.080 --> 25:22.600
I'm not naming any names here, tend to get hung up responding to just one individual

25:22.600 --> 25:27.480
out of some personal vendetta, however justified they have against them.

25:28.040 --> 25:31.000
And that really isn't the best use of our time.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.800
Even if you make the perfect video which completely disgraces some anti-feminist

25:35.800 --> 25:38.440
or whoever else in the eyes of their followers,

25:38.440 --> 25:41.000
they'll just be replaced by someone else tomorrow.

25:41.560 --> 25:45.000
The desire for their type of content still exists,

25:45.080 --> 25:49.240
regardless of what they do as individuals, and that's the real problem.

25:49.800 --> 25:55.400
However, the desire is also clearly there for more leftist voices on the platform.

25:55.400 --> 25:57.880
So I'll repeat my call from a while back.

25:57.880 --> 26:01.560
If you want to get started, now is a great time.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.520
Over the course of the next few years in particular,

26:04.520 --> 26:07.880
leftist YouTube is going to grow massively.

26:07.880 --> 26:10.200
So make a video and share it.

26:10.200 --> 26:11.560
It's a lot of fun.

26:11.560 --> 26:14.840
So this is going to be my plan going forward in 2018.

26:15.640 --> 26:20.040
More political videos that approach various topics from the left

26:20.040 --> 26:23.160
with the aim of building up a library of material there,

26:23.960 --> 26:26.280
lure them in with the debunking videos,

26:26.280 --> 26:31.160
and then the suggested video feature hits them with a lecture about privatization or something.

26:31.960 --> 26:36.360
That's my sneaky plan, which I've just given away, I realize.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.520
Thanks a lot for watching this meandering mess, folks.

26:40.520 --> 26:44.520
It's a bit of an odd video today, but my patrons wanted to see it,

26:44.520 --> 26:47.480
and I'm willingly a slave to their desires.

26:47.480 --> 26:50.280
I hope there was something you were able to take from it, at least.

26:51.080 --> 26:54.600
Now, don't worry if you're someone who cannot spare the mental energy

26:54.600 --> 26:57.960
to attempt to appeal to the demographic I've been talking about.

26:57.960 --> 27:02.760
If you're someone the alt-right hates by virtue of whatever you happen to be,

27:02.760 --> 27:08.120
simply existing and being awesome is a good counterargument in and of itself.

27:08.120 --> 27:09.800
And a final note here.

27:09.800 --> 27:12.920
Intersectionality is really important.

27:12.920 --> 27:17.240
Where the alt-right break people into small groups, we should bring them together.

27:17.800 --> 27:20.360
And then we'll definitely have them beat on the numbers, at least.

27:20.920 --> 27:25.000
So, uh, be intersectional, I guess is my last bit of advice.

27:25.880 --> 27:29.240
Thanks, as always, to all my supporters over on Patreon.

27:29.240 --> 27:31.640
Have you noticed the new credits, by the way?

27:31.640 --> 27:34.200
We have new credits now by Jen.

27:34.200 --> 27:37.240
This should solve the problem with the scrolling, hopefully.

27:37.560 --> 27:39.000
And here's how they work.

27:39.000 --> 27:43.400
If you pledge at the credits tier, then the month after your pledge began,

27:43.400 --> 27:45.880
you'll start appearing in the credits of videos.

27:45.880 --> 27:49.480
So everyone who pledged at the credits tier after I created it,

27:49.480 --> 27:52.040
your name will start appearing in next month's videos.

27:52.600 --> 27:55.000
This is to stop people pledging with a silly name

27:55.000 --> 27:57.560
and then dropping out before the end of the month, you see.

27:57.560 --> 27:58.520
I've had a few of those.

27:59.480 --> 28:03.160
Okay, folks, thanks a lot for watching, and I'll see you next time.
