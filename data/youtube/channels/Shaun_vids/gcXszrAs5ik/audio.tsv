0	5960	Hello, everyone. This is a review of the Ghostbusters reboot movie that came out this year.
5960	11240	Now, I just watched this movie recently, and it was a little bit rubbish, to be honest.
11240	14060	Was it the worst movie ever made?
14800	23260	No. It had a lot of problems, but there were a few things I liked about it, too, so I guess overall I'd call it mediocre.
23260	26600	And that's not a good place to be for a comedy movie.
26600	33200	I mean, something either makes you laugh, or it doesn't, and for the most part, this movie just didn't make me laugh.
33700	37600	Now, the original 1984 Ghostbusters movie was really good,
37600	44100	and the new movie is, in most respects, just a remake of that one, so I thought it'd be interesting to compare the two.
44400	48800	Now, in a lot of ways, discussing comedy can be quite difficult, you know.
48800	52800	People have different senses of humor, and they find different things funny.
52900	59200	Some people like understated, character-driven comedies, and some people are objectively wrong.
59800	63700	So, to save myself from saying, in my opinion, roughly a hundred times,
63700	69000	I'll just leave a disclaimer here that all my declarative sentences about what is and is not funny,
69600	72000	they're my own opinions. You're free to disagree.
72400	78200	And I annoyingly have to make a brief note here about the controversy surrounding the release of the movie.
78600	84800	The internet was pretty mad about this movie before it even came out, and a lot of dumb people said a lot of dumb things.
85200	90200	So, let's first off list some points which are not the reason that the movie isn't good.
90500	92500	One, because it's got women in it.
93200	95200	No, that doesn't matter at all.
95500	99500	Two, because of Leslie Jones or any other actor or actors.
100200	104100	No, everyone who's in the movie is at least a capable actor.
104600	110100	Missed cast, maybe, arguable, but this wasn't the fault of the actors.
110700	116100	Three, because of how poorly it was marketed, the awful trailer, or anything else.
116100	121100	And there's a lot to talk about there, but I'm only interested in what's actually in the movie right now.
121300	123300	So, what were the actual reasons?
123700	126500	Well, after quickly googling how to analyze movies,
126500	132400	I've identified a few key areas where I think the reboot underperforms compared to the original.
133200	134600	Firstly, the script.
135000	139200	Certain things are missing, and certain things are in there that don't need to be.
139800	141600	Secondly, the characters.
142200	147400	Characterization's very patchy, and the characters break character too easily.
148200	148800	Character.
149400	152800	And thirdly, the editing, and this is the big one for me personally.
153400	159600	The movie was edited by someone who, I'm sorry to say, is not good at identifying things which are funny.
160200	165000	Now, the main problem with the comedy in this comedy movie is that it appears to have been written,
165000	168400	directed, and edited with the following principle in mind.
170800	175200	Jokes are funny, right? So, the more jokes you do, the funnier it is.
176000	178000	Comedy doesn't work that way, I'm afraid.
178400	184000	The movie has a lot of funny moments, but they're stifled by the surrounding unfunny moments.
184400	189000	Comedy, to a large extent, relies on establishing and maintaining a mood.
189400	193400	And it's better to have no joke at all than a bad joke that kills the mood.
194000	197000	Bad jokes prey on good jokes and eat them.
197600	199600	But we'll talk more about that in a little while.
200000	202400	Let's first talk briefly about the story.
203000	207400	Now, both the new movie and the original broadly follow the same basic plot.
207800	212000	Some scientists who believe in ghosts get kicked out of their college or colleges,
212400	214400	develop technology to catch ghosts,
214800	216800	start a ghost-catching business,
216800	220200	and then they have to face off against some larger paranormal threat,
220600	222200	and they end up saving the city.
222400	226800	Now, the new Ghostbusters makes a few changes to the particulars of the storyline,
226800	230800	some of which are fine, but some of which I think actively harm the story.
231400	235400	Now, the worst of these for me was having the government already know about the ghosts
235400	237800	and engaging in a conspiracy to cover them up.
238200	240200	And we're not frauds, we are legitimate scientists.
240200	241800	Let me interrupt you. We know you're not frauds.
242200	245200	Because we have been monitoring the situation quite closely.
245200	248200	Agents Hawkins and Rourke are with Homeland Security,
248200	252200	so we've been investigating this extremely quietly.
252200	256200	You see, this kind of robs the Ghostbusters as their unique thing for me.
256200	258200	You know, the ghost thing.
259200	264200	In the old Ghostbusters, the government, represented by the mayor and Walter Peck,
264200	267200	they don't believe in ghosts, and they've got to be convinced of it.
268200	271200	In the new movie, when the Ghostbusters meet the mayor, he's like,
271600	273600	Yeah, ghosts. We know.
273600	277200	And it's like, oh, well, I guess people already know about ghosts,
277200	280200	then that kind of makes the Ghostbusters less special.
280200	284200	And I'm just gonna quickly run through some other structural or storyline changes
284200	286200	that I felt were detrimental.
286200	289200	Patty joins the Ghostbusters for no reason.
289200	293200	In the first movie, Winston just walked in looking for a job.
293200	297200	In the new movie, Patty is one of the Ghostbusters' first customers.
297200	300200	And that's fine by itself, there's nothing wrong with that.
300200	303200	I might even like that more than the original,
303200	307200	if they gave Patty a solid reason to actually want to join the Ghostbusters.
308200	312200	It feels like there was a scene cut where Patty got fired over the ghost thing,
312200	315200	you know, maybe she keeps telling customers about the ghost,
315200	320200	or her boss fires her for bringing the Ghostbusters there or something like that.
320200	325200	So then she joins the Ghostbusters because they're the only ones who believe her about the ghost.
325200	329200	Instead, she just turns up and demands a job for no clear reason.
329200	333200	She even complains about the job later on in the movie.
333200	338200	I had a good job at the MTA. Was it perfect? No, of course it wasn't perfect.
338200	341200	But I tell you what, everybody was alive.
341200	346200	And the audience is thinking, well, why did you leave the old job again?
346200	351200	It wouldn't surprise me if there's a deleted scene of Patty getting fired, to be honest.
351200	353200	No money issues.
353200	358200	In the original Ghostbusters, Venkman talks Stance into ta- Stance?
359200	363200	Stance? Stance? Is that how you say that?
363200	367200	I've written it here, I've never said it out loud. Stance.
367200	371200	In the original Ghostbusters, Bill Murray talks Dan Aykroyd
371200	375200	into taking out an extra mortgage on his house to finance the start of the business,
375200	378200	and they're basically broke when they get their first real job.
378200	382200	And I like this finance element, it's largely missing from the new movie.
382200	386200	They don't even bill the theater guy for catching the demon ghost thing there,
386200	391200	and there's no explanation for how they're able to finance developing all the ghost tech.
391200	394200	No getting famous montage.
394200	399200	In the original movie, there's a montage scene of the Ghostbusters in the media,
399200	403200	completing more jobs, and generally showing the passage of time.
403200	409200	In the new movie, they catch one ghost and they're immediately, like, immediately on the news and famous,
409200	412200	and I don't know, it just felt a bit rushed.
412200	415200	Too much action near the end of the movie.
415200	421200	And this is in turn a problem with the structure, the editing, and just the overall general direction,
421200	423200	but whatever, I'm putting it here.
423200	430200	In the original Ghostbusters, what action there was always served the needs of the story or the comedy.
430200	434200	The action seen near the end of the new movie goes on entirely too long
434200	438200	and serves no real purpose beyond showing off a bunch of special effects.
438200	444200	That and there's a few genuinely embarrassing moments featuring Holtzmann, but we'll get to her in a bit.
444200	449200	Now all of these are flaws, but none of them are really movie killers.
449200	452200	They'd all be excusable if the movie were funnier.
452200	455200	So let's talk about why it wasn't.
455200	460200	And here's what I think is the most glaring problem with the comedy in the new Ghostbusters movie.
460200	463200	Everyone tries to be funny.
463200	469200	Almost every single character, large or small, is played for laughs in a very overstated way.
469200	476200	Now in the original Ghostbusters movie, the only character to intentionally crack jokes at any point,
476200	479200	I think, is Venkman.
479200	482200	Every single other character is played pretty much straight.
482200	487200	Scenes with Venkman and one other character resemble a classic double act routine,
487200	492200	with Venkman as the comic and the other character, whoever it is, as the straight man.
492200	497200	Not that the other characters aren't funny. Jeanine is funny. Egon is funny.
497200	504200	This hotel attendant trying to hide the ghosts from the guests is funny, but they're not trying to be funny.
504200	508200	The humor comes from their characters and the situation that they're in.
508200	512200	The contrast of characters can be a funny joke in and of itself.
512200	518200	Stance walks out of the elevator, tense and serious, and Venkman follows calmly.
518200	523200	Now, neither is funny by itself, but together the contrast gets a laugh.
523200	531200	Or, consider Venkman's introductory scene, where Venkman is lying to the two students about the results of an ESP test.
531200	538200	Now, no one is trying to be funny in this scene. No one's saying funny things. It's just a funny situation.
538200	545200	We're learning about Venkman's character. He's manipulative, he's selfish, he doesn't take his work seriously.
545200	552200	And the humor comes from the simple, dramatic irony of the audience being able to see the cards while the students can't.
552200	560200	Now, in the new Ghostbusters movie, well, all the Ghostbusters are played funny nearly all the time, for a start.
560200	563200	But so is almost every other character.
563200	570200	This tour guide has to be funny. The FBI guy has to be funny. The college dean has to be funny.
570200	574200	The food delivery man, even, has to be funny.
574200	577200	Even the antagonist has to be funny.
577200	585200	And then the world shall bend tomorrow. Okay. I apologize, that looks nastier than I intended.
585200	592200	One of the only characters to be played straight is the old-fashioned dean of Columbia University, played by Charles Dance,
592200	597200	who, not so coincidentally, says probably my favorite line in the movie.
597200	607200	Dr. Bronston saw this on Reddit. It was reblogged from a site entitled Ghost News. Not a publication I'd heard of.
607200	613200	Now, the derision with which he says reblogged from a site entitled Ghost News is funny,
613200	619200	because we know his character from earlier and understand that he would hate to say that sentence.
619200	625200	At no point does Charles Dance break character and start riffing and telling awful jokes.
625200	629200	And speaking of, let's talk about the Ghostbusters themselves.
629200	634200	Now, the early scenes in the new Ghostbusters actually gave me hope that it was gonna be really good.
634200	638200	The opening conflict between Erin and Abby is completely fine, in my opinion.
638200	642200	I feel like we get a sense of who these characters are at the start of the movie.
642200	650200	You know, Erin is high-strung, she takes herself and her work seriously, she believes in ghosts but doesn't want anyone to know.
651200	657200	Abby is less serious, believes in ghosts and wants to prove it, and she's angry at Erin for a perceived betrayal.
657200	663200	You know, it's not Hamlet by any means, but the original Ghostbusters characters weren't Hamlet either.
663200	667200	You know, they're fine characters for a comedy movie about ghosts.
667200	671200	They're even given a pretty deep personal reason to want to prove ghosts exist.
671200	676200	When I was eight years old, the mean old lady that lived next door died.
676200	686200	And that night, I woke up and she was standing at the foot of my bed, just staring at me.
688200	692200	She did that every night for almost a year.
692200	697200	Which I thought was a bit serious and probably overkill, but, you know, I'm not really complaining.
697200	702200	And early on, there's some okay to actually pretty good moments with these characters.
702200	707200	I like when Erin's arguing with this guy and pretending that she didn't write the book.
707200	711200	I like her trying to hide her monitor from Charles Dance.
711200	714200	I like Abby and Erin arguing about the book.
714200	718200	You know, it's not hilarious or anything, but it's fine character building.
718200	724200	Now, the big letdown for me is how quickly the movie was willing to completely abandon these characters.
724200	730200	For example, at one point, a paranormal skeptic played by a very tired-looking Bill Murray
730200	732200	comes to see the ghosts they captured.
732200	740200	Then Erin, because she wants to prove ghosts exist so much, lets the ghost out and it murders Bill Murray.
740200	745200	So the Ghostbusters essentially kill a man, which is weird enough by itself, to be honest,
745200	747200	but then not ten seconds later.
748200	749200	Who tore him out the window?
749200	751200	A ghost threw him out the window.
751200	754200	Oh, you mean like Patrick Swayze? Like he's sitting behind you making some pottery?
754200	756200	Yeah, like Patrick Swayze. That's it.
756200	763200	And then we were all dancing at a summer camp in the Catskills, and then we sat down and he was behind me and we made a vase.
763200	764200	Oh, you're combining the two.
764200	766200	I combined a couple of Swayze.
766200	767200	Oh, you know what was a good one? Roadhouse.
767200	768200	I loved Roadhouse.
768200	769200	It was a point break?
769200	771200	It was a point break.
771200	772200	Come on, at the end with a big wave?
772200	778200	Now, why are they doing a little Patrick Swayze movie riff bit with this police officer?
778200	780200	They just saw someone die.
781200	786200	And I'm thinking, well, they just caused the death of a man. Why don't they care about that?
786200	793200	All the early scenes established Erin as a self-serious person who was sensitive to what other people think about her,
793200	797200	but at the first chance to do some jokey jokes, that all gets tossed out.
797200	801200	And I mean, if they're not gonna bother trying to have consistent characterization,
801200	807200	they may as well just have characters with seemingly no motivation whatsoever who act completely randomly all the time.
807200	810200	And speaking of, let's talk about Holtzman.
810200	816200	Now, Holtzman isn't developed enough to even be called a character, really. She's a character trait.
816200	818200	She's wacky.
818200	824200	When she's introduced, she's not really given a clear motivation, but she seems pretty excited about going to see a ghost,
824200	829200	so I'm thinking, okay, she wants to see a ghost. That's her thing.
829200	831200	But when she does see a ghost...
839200	843200	So I'm thinking, oh, she doesn't care about seeing a ghost then?
843200	848200	But now she seems excited she saw a ghost again? Like, what is she doing?
849200	851200	What is this character ever doing?
851200	858200	In fact, almost every time Holtzman was on screen when I watched this movie, I was solely wondering what she was doing and why.
858200	863200	She's like a character void. It's impossible to have an opinion about Holtzman.
863200	871200	And the sad thing here is that all it would have taken was a few lines of exposition at her introduction to give her some grounding in reality.
871200	875200	You know, you can do the wacky scientist thing, and well.
875200	878200	I mean, Egon in the original movie was that to an extent,
878200	884200	but underneath all the wackiness, you still need to have an actual identifiable human.
884200	890200	Of course, Holtzman is given a few lines of humanizing dialogue in the movie that ground her a little.
890200	893200	I didn't think that I would ever really have a friend until I met Abby,
893200	897200	and then I feel like I have a family, I have my own, and I love you. Thank you.
897200	899200	Thank you.
899200	902200	I mean, that was a real thing right there. That was, like, so real.
902200	905200	And Patty's right. That was so real right there.
905200	910200	If only something like that could have came near the start of the movie instead of five minutes from the end,
910200	914200	so I didn't waste two hours wondering if Holtzman was human or not.
914200	919200	And as for Patty, I don't have too much to say about her, to be honest.
919200	925200	She's fine overall, except, oddly enough, for everything that they put in the trailer.
925200	930200	She does break character, least often, out of any of the Ghostbusters, so she gets a point for that.
930200	937200	And speaking of Holtzman and characters who aren't really characters, Kevin, who is stupid.
937200	941200	So stupid as to not even be a human, actually.
941200	944200	I mentioned earlier that I think Hemsworth was miscast.
944200	949200	Not because he's not funny, though he isn't in this.
949200	953200	I mean, he might be a funny guy elsewhere, but in this, he's dreadful.
953200	956200	No, I think he's miscast because he's too famous,
956200	961200	and he thus gets way too much screen time for what should be a minor character.
961200	964200	You can have a minor character who's incredibly stupid, that's fine,
964200	970200	but having several scenes that focus solely on that character where the only joke is that they are stupid,
970200	974200	well, that gets tedious very quickly.
974200	977200	And maybe it's just me, but a lot of the jokes where the punchline is,
977200	981200	Kevin is stupid, are a little... stupid.
981200	986200	Would it be okay if I bring my cat to work sometimes? He has major anxiety problems.
986200	992200	You know what, I would love to let your cat live here with you, but I have a pretty severe cat allergy.
992200	996200	Oh, I don't have a cat. He's a dog. His name's my cat.
996200	999200	Your dog's name is my cat?
999200	1000200	Mike Hat.
1000200	1003200	Your dog's name is Mike, last name Hat.
1003200	1005200	Well, his full name is Michael Hat.
1005200	1008200	What the hell are they even talking about, honestly?
1008200	1012200	Just because he's dumb doesn't mean the writing has to be dumb.
1012200	1016200	You can have a cleverly constructed joke about a character being stupid.
1016200	1018200	Okay, one last time.
1019200	1025200	These are small, but the ones out there are far away.
1033200	1036200	Small, far away.
1038200	1042200	A character being stupid should really be the means by which a joke is told,
1042200	1045200	rather than the punchline in and of itself.
1046200	1050200	There's only one thing Kevin says in the movie that actually got a laugh out of me,
1050200	1053200	and that's just because it's a line lifted out of the original.
1054200	1056200	Ghostbusters, what do you want?
1057200	1059200	Ghostbusters, what do you want?
1059200	1062200	So just to be fair here, before I move on to talk about editing,
1062200	1066200	I'd like to point out some moments that I actually really enjoyed in the new movie.
1067200	1070200	I like when Erin's trying to warn the mayor about what's gonna happen.
1083200	1086200	I like when this thing starts spinning around really fast.
1090200	1095200	I like when the camera footage cuts to a YouTube video playing in Charles Dance's office.
1095200	1099200	I like when Abby goes to hit the bomb like a baseball and misses.
1099200	1103200	Although it's not edited very well, but whatever, I like the idea, so I'll give it a pass.
1104200	1108200	I like when Erin is having a tantrum and picks up the bomb to throw it,
1108200	1110200	and Abby and Holtzman freak out.
1110200	1112200	Maybe I just think bombs are funny, I don't know.
1112200	1115200	Now all of these at least got a smile out of me,
1115200	1119200	but if you notice something about all these moments, they're all physical comedy.
1120200	1124200	And the new movie is generally at its strongest when it keeps the humor non-verbal,
1125200	1131200	which is the nicer way around of saying that the movie's at its weakest when the characters talk.
1132200	1134200	And bugger me, do they talk.
1144200	1150200	And talk and talk until any actual comedy present's been run into the ground.
1150200	1156200	A few visuals actually get ruined to a certain degree because the characters just won't shut up for five seconds.
1157200	1162200	Let's look at one instance of the same joke that's in both the old Ghostbusters and the new.
1181200	1186200	The same visual joke, you know, recoiling from the Proton Pack being turned on,
1186200	1190200	has much less impact in the new movie because, for whatever reason,
1190200	1196200	someone involved in the production decided that Melissa McCarthy should be yelling over the top of it.
1196200	1199200	And the constant talking isn't just background noise,
1199200	1206200	the reluctance to edit it out or cut away from it artificially extends the runtime of a whole bunch of scenes
1206200	1208200	long past the point where the joke's dead.
1208200	1212200	And there's a lot of these scenes, but we're just gonna be looking at a select few.
1212200	1215200	First up is Patty delivering the hearse.
1216200	1220200	So, fundamentally, what, if anything, is the funny thing about this scene?
1221200	1224200	Well, on one level, it's a simple reversal of expectation.
1224200	1230200	The other Ghostbusters weren't expecting the car to be a hearse, and then the car is a hearse.
1230200	1236200	Now, as a British man, that's enough for me. I'm happy with that right there.
1236200	1243200	You've got your reversal of expectation, a little irony in the fact that the Ghostbusters drive a hearse.
1243200	1244200	Job done.
1244200	1250200	Now, the problem is, this premise isn't funny enough to sustain a full conversation about it.
1250200	1256200	Now, for all the non-British people in the audience, I'll allow the premise one more joke, maybe, like the following.
1256200	1259200	Hope you checked to see there wasn't a body in the back.
1259200	1262200	Uh, I don't think so. I don't really know.
1262200	1263200	You didn't check?
1263200	1267200	I mean, I was in a hurry. I checked to see if we had gas. That was more important.
1267200	1271200	Now, if I were editing this scene, I would have cut to the next scene right there.
1271200	1275200	Erin jokes that there might be a body in the back of the hearse,
1275200	1279200	and it turns out that Patty doesn't actually know if there's a body in the back of the hearse.
1279200	1286200	It's not exactly a knee-slapper, but it's good enough, that is, until the premise gets stretched way too thin.
1286200	1287200	So there is a body?
1287200	1289200	Let Hoseman check. She likes that type of stuff.
1290200	1293200	Yeah, I can think of seven good uses of a cadaver today.
1293200	1297200	No, Dr. Frankenstein. We gotta turn in the body if there's one in there.
1297200	1299200	Alright.
1299200	1300200	Don't do that.
1300200	1308200	Too many times when I was watching this movie, I was just waiting for the characters to stop talking so that the story would progress.
1308200	1314200	Let's look at another example like this, and while you're watching, have a think about where you would put the cut to the next scene.
1315200	1318200	This is an institution of higher learning.
1318200	1323200	And if you guys want to study ghosts, do it somewhere else, because I have two words for you.
1323200	1325200	Let me guess. Get out?
1325200	1328200	No, he's gonna say suck it. He's not gonna say suck it.
1328200	1330200	Suck it.
1330200	1331200	You were right.
1331200	1333200	Oh, my gosh.
1333200	1335200	I think it might be a ghost.
1335200	1337200	Oh, no, it's not. It's just a bird.
1337200	1339200	Bye. There's the door. Later days.
1339200	1341200	Can you hear this? Let me turn it up.
1342200	1344200	Oh, my God.
1345200	1347200	This is incredibly immature behavior.
1350200	1351200	Got it.
1351200	1353200	Just a minor setback.
1353200	1355200	No, guys, I think we can really do this.
1355200	1357200	Goes on a bit, doesn't it?
1357200	1360200	So, what's the comedic element to this scene?
1360200	1365200	It's that you'd expect the dean of a university to be very professional and mature.
1365200	1367200	A bit like Charles Dance, say.
1367200	1371200	But this dean is very unprofessional and immature.
1371200	1378200	So what you want to do, once the scene's fulfilled its narrative purpose, is cut on the most emphatic instance of that.
1378200	1380200	And if we do that...
1380200	1383200	This is an institution of higher learning.
1383200	1388200	And if you guys want to study ghosts, do it somewhere else, because I have two words for you.
1388200	1390200	Let me guess. Get out?
1390200	1393200	No, he's gonna say suck it. He's not gonna say suck it.
1393200	1395200	Suck it.
1395200	1396200	Just a minor setback.
1396200	1398200	No, guys, I think we can really do this.
1398200	1401200	And would you look at that? That's much better.
1401200	1404200	And let's look at another scene that's in desperate want of editing.
1404200	1408200	Erin gets fired by Charles Dance after he sees the YouTube video.
1408200	1416200	And then there's an awful, drawn-out scene of Erin walking down a hallway, pretending to not have been fired to everyone.
1416200	1421200	And it's unnecessary, and it's crap, and it goes on forever.
1421200	1425200	Now, in the original Ghostbusters, Stance and Venkman get fired by the Dean,
1425200	1428200	and we immediately cut to them drinking outside.
1428200	1431200	And we get it, they've been fired. We don't need it spelled out.
1431200	1434200	It's funnier if it happens off-screen.
1434200	1439200	You could cut the whole walking down the corridor riffing on being fired bit entirely,
1439200	1442200	and just go straight from Charles Dance to the next scene.
1443200	1446200	Well, I hope you're happy.
1446200	1449200	That video you posted got me fired.
1449200	1455200	Or you could go even further with it, and leave the entire firing just implied, with something like this.
1455200	1457200	Ghosts are real! Ghosts are real!
1457200	1460200	I believe in ghosts, because they deserve to be real!
1462200	1464200	Who is that?
1465200	1468200	Well, I hope you're happy.
1468200	1471200	That video you posted got me fired.
1471200	1476200	Sony, send me all the raw footage. I'll cut a good movie out of it, I promise.
1476200	1480200	It'll only be 40 minutes long, but it'll be really good.
1480200	1484200	Now, the first Ghostbusters movie was much more sparing with the dialogue,
1484200	1487200	and they knew how to cut away after a good line.
1487200	1489200	Do you have any hobbies?
1491200	1493200	I collect spores, moulds, and fungus.
1494200	1501200	If that line was in the new movie, they'd probably follow it with 45 seconds of awful improv riffing about fungus.
1501200	1504200	Now, I don't know where the problems with this movie originated,
1504200	1508200	in the writing, the direction, the acting, or wherever,
1508200	1514200	but if there's bad jokes in there, then it needed an editor with the ability to cut them out.
1514200	1516200	And that just didn't happen, I'm afraid.
1516200	1521200	Overall, I'd call Ghostbusters 2016 a spooktacular summer hit
1521200	1523200	that the whole family can enjoy.
1523200	1525200	Nine stars.
