00:00.000 --> 00:05.960
Hello, everyone. This is a review of the Ghostbusters reboot movie that came out this year.

00:05.960 --> 00:11.240
Now, I just watched this movie recently, and it was a little bit rubbish, to be honest.

00:11.240 --> 00:14.060
Was it the worst movie ever made?

00:14.800 --> 00:23.260
No. It had a lot of problems, but there were a few things I liked about it, too, so I guess overall I'd call it mediocre.

00:23.260 --> 00:26.600
And that's not a good place to be for a comedy movie.

00:26.600 --> 00:33.200
I mean, something either makes you laugh, or it doesn't, and for the most part, this movie just didn't make me laugh.

00:33.700 --> 00:37.600
Now, the original 1984 Ghostbusters movie was really good,

00:37.600 --> 00:44.100
and the new movie is, in most respects, just a remake of that one, so I thought it'd be interesting to compare the two.

00:44.400 --> 00:48.800
Now, in a lot of ways, discussing comedy can be quite difficult, you know.

00:48.800 --> 00:52.800
People have different senses of humor, and they find different things funny.

00:52.900 --> 00:59.200
Some people like understated, character-driven comedies, and some people are objectively wrong.

00:59.800 --> 01:03.700
So, to save myself from saying, in my opinion, roughly a hundred times,

01:03.700 --> 01:09.000
I'll just leave a disclaimer here that all my declarative sentences about what is and is not funny,

01:09.600 --> 01:12.000
they're my own opinions. You're free to disagree.

01:12.400 --> 01:18.200
And I annoyingly have to make a brief note here about the controversy surrounding the release of the movie.

01:18.600 --> 01:24.800
The internet was pretty mad about this movie before it even came out, and a lot of dumb people said a lot of dumb things.

01:25.200 --> 01:30.200
So, let's first off list some points which are not the reason that the movie isn't good.

01:30.500 --> 01:32.500
One, because it's got women in it.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.200
No, that doesn't matter at all.

01:35.500 --> 01:39.500
Two, because of Leslie Jones or any other actor or actors.

01:40.200 --> 01:44.100
No, everyone who's in the movie is at least a capable actor.

01:44.600 --> 01:50.100
Missed cast, maybe, arguable, but this wasn't the fault of the actors.

01:50.700 --> 01:56.100
Three, because of how poorly it was marketed, the awful trailer, or anything else.

01:56.100 --> 02:01.100
And there's a lot to talk about there, but I'm only interested in what's actually in the movie right now.

02:01.300 --> 02:03.300
So, what were the actual reasons?

02:03.700 --> 02:06.500
Well, after quickly googling how to analyze movies,

02:06.500 --> 02:12.400
I've identified a few key areas where I think the reboot underperforms compared to the original.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.600
Firstly, the script.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.200
Certain things are missing, and certain things are in there that don't need to be.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.600
Secondly, the characters.

02:22.200 --> 02:27.400
Characterization's very patchy, and the characters break character too easily.

02:28.200 --> 02:28.800
Character.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.800
And thirdly, the editing, and this is the big one for me personally.

02:33.400 --> 02:39.600
The movie was edited by someone who, I'm sorry to say, is not good at identifying things which are funny.

02:40.200 --> 02:45.000
Now, the main problem with the comedy in this comedy movie is that it appears to have been written,

02:45.000 --> 02:48.400
directed, and edited with the following principle in mind.

02:50.800 --> 02:55.200
Jokes are funny, right? So, the more jokes you do, the funnier it is.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Comedy doesn't work that way, I'm afraid.

02:58.400 --> 03:04.000
The movie has a lot of funny moments, but they're stifled by the surrounding unfunny moments.

03:04.400 --> 03:09.000
Comedy, to a large extent, relies on establishing and maintaining a mood.

03:09.400 --> 03:13.400
And it's better to have no joke at all than a bad joke that kills the mood.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Bad jokes prey on good jokes and eat them.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.600
But we'll talk more about that in a little while.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.400
Let's first talk briefly about the story.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.400
Now, both the new movie and the original broadly follow the same basic plot.

03:27.800 --> 03:32.000
Some scientists who believe in ghosts get kicked out of their college or colleges,

03:32.400 --> 03:34.400
develop technology to catch ghosts,

03:34.800 --> 03:36.800
start a ghost-catching business,

03:36.800 --> 03:40.200
and then they have to face off against some larger paranormal threat,

03:40.600 --> 03:42.200
and they end up saving the city.

03:42.400 --> 03:46.800
Now, the new Ghostbusters makes a few changes to the particulars of the storyline,

03:46.800 --> 03:50.800
some of which are fine, but some of which I think actively harm the story.

03:51.400 --> 03:55.400
Now, the worst of these for me was having the government already know about the ghosts

03:55.400 --> 03:57.800
and engaging in a conspiracy to cover them up.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.200
And we're not frauds, we are legitimate scientists.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.800
Let me interrupt you. We know you're not frauds.

04:02.200 --> 04:05.200
Because we have been monitoring the situation quite closely.

04:05.200 --> 04:08.200
Agents Hawkins and Rourke are with Homeland Security,

04:08.200 --> 04:12.200
so we've been investigating this extremely quietly.

04:12.200 --> 04:16.200
You see, this kind of robs the Ghostbusters as their unique thing for me.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.200
You know, the ghost thing.

04:19.200 --> 04:24.200
In the old Ghostbusters, the government, represented by the mayor and Walter Peck,

04:24.200 --> 04:27.200
they don't believe in ghosts, and they've got to be convinced of it.

04:28.200 --> 04:31.200
In the new movie, when the Ghostbusters meet the mayor, he's like,

04:31.600 --> 04:33.600
Yeah, ghosts. We know.

04:33.600 --> 04:37.200
And it's like, oh, well, I guess people already know about ghosts,

04:37.200 --> 04:40.200
then that kind of makes the Ghostbusters less special.

04:40.200 --> 04:44.200
And I'm just gonna quickly run through some other structural or storyline changes

04:44.200 --> 04:46.200
that I felt were detrimental.

04:46.200 --> 04:49.200
Patty joins the Ghostbusters for no reason.

04:49.200 --> 04:53.200
In the first movie, Winston just walked in looking for a job.

04:53.200 --> 04:57.200
In the new movie, Patty is one of the Ghostbusters' first customers.

04:57.200 --> 05:00.200
And that's fine by itself, there's nothing wrong with that.

05:00.200 --> 05:03.200
I might even like that more than the original,

05:03.200 --> 05:07.200
if they gave Patty a solid reason to actually want to join the Ghostbusters.

05:08.200 --> 05:12.200
It feels like there was a scene cut where Patty got fired over the ghost thing,

05:12.200 --> 05:15.200
you know, maybe she keeps telling customers about the ghost,

05:15.200 --> 05:20.200
or her boss fires her for bringing the Ghostbusters there or something like that.

05:20.200 --> 05:25.200
So then she joins the Ghostbusters because they're the only ones who believe her about the ghost.

05:25.200 --> 05:29.200
Instead, she just turns up and demands a job for no clear reason.

05:29.200 --> 05:33.200
She even complains about the job later on in the movie.

05:33.200 --> 05:38.200
I had a good job at the MTA. Was it perfect? No, of course it wasn't perfect.

05:38.200 --> 05:41.200
But I tell you what, everybody was alive.

05:41.200 --> 05:46.200
And the audience is thinking, well, why did you leave the old job again?

05:46.200 --> 05:51.200
It wouldn't surprise me if there's a deleted scene of Patty getting fired, to be honest.

05:51.200 --> 05:53.200
No money issues.

05:53.200 --> 05:58.200
In the original Ghostbusters, Venkman talks Stance into ta- Stance?

05:59.200 --> 06:03.200
Stance? Stance? Is that how you say that?

06:03.200 --> 06:07.200
I've written it here, I've never said it out loud. Stance.

06:07.200 --> 06:11.200
In the original Ghostbusters, Bill Murray talks Dan Aykroyd

06:11.200 --> 06:15.200
into taking out an extra mortgage on his house to finance the start of the business,

06:15.200 --> 06:18.200
and they're basically broke when they get their first real job.

06:18.200 --> 06:22.200
And I like this finance element, it's largely missing from the new movie.

06:22.200 --> 06:26.200
They don't even bill the theater guy for catching the demon ghost thing there,

06:26.200 --> 06:31.200
and there's no explanation for how they're able to finance developing all the ghost tech.

06:31.200 --> 06:34.200
No getting famous montage.

06:34.200 --> 06:39.200
In the original movie, there's a montage scene of the Ghostbusters in the media,

06:39.200 --> 06:43.200
completing more jobs, and generally showing the passage of time.

06:43.200 --> 06:49.200
In the new movie, they catch one ghost and they're immediately, like, immediately on the news and famous,

06:49.200 --> 06:52.200
and I don't know, it just felt a bit rushed.

06:52.200 --> 06:55.200
Too much action near the end of the movie.

06:55.200 --> 07:01.200
And this is in turn a problem with the structure, the editing, and just the overall general direction,

07:01.200 --> 07:03.200
but whatever, I'm putting it here.

07:03.200 --> 07:10.200
In the original Ghostbusters, what action there was always served the needs of the story or the comedy.

07:10.200 --> 07:14.200
The action seen near the end of the new movie goes on entirely too long

07:14.200 --> 07:18.200
and serves no real purpose beyond showing off a bunch of special effects.

07:18.200 --> 07:24.200
That and there's a few genuinely embarrassing moments featuring Holtzmann, but we'll get to her in a bit.

07:24.200 --> 07:29.200
Now all of these are flaws, but none of them are really movie killers.

07:29.200 --> 07:32.200
They'd all be excusable if the movie were funnier.

07:32.200 --> 07:35.200
So let's talk about why it wasn't.

07:35.200 --> 07:40.200
And here's what I think is the most glaring problem with the comedy in the new Ghostbusters movie.

07:40.200 --> 07:43.200
Everyone tries to be funny.

07:43.200 --> 07:49.200
Almost every single character, large or small, is played for laughs in a very overstated way.

07:49.200 --> 07:56.200
Now in the original Ghostbusters movie, the only character to intentionally crack jokes at any point,

07:56.200 --> 07:59.200
I think, is Venkman.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.200
Every single other character is played pretty much straight.

08:02.200 --> 08:07.200
Scenes with Venkman and one other character resemble a classic double act routine,

08:07.200 --> 08:12.200
with Venkman as the comic and the other character, whoever it is, as the straight man.

08:12.200 --> 08:17.200
Not that the other characters aren't funny. Jeanine is funny. Egon is funny.

08:17.200 --> 08:24.200
This hotel attendant trying to hide the ghosts from the guests is funny, but they're not trying to be funny.

08:24.200 --> 08:28.200
The humor comes from their characters and the situation that they're in.

08:28.200 --> 08:32.200
The contrast of characters can be a funny joke in and of itself.

08:32.200 --> 08:38.200
Stance walks out of the elevator, tense and serious, and Venkman follows calmly.

08:38.200 --> 08:43.200
Now, neither is funny by itself, but together the contrast gets a laugh.

08:43.200 --> 08:51.200
Or, consider Venkman's introductory scene, where Venkman is lying to the two students about the results of an ESP test.

08:51.200 --> 08:58.200
Now, no one is trying to be funny in this scene. No one's saying funny things. It's just a funny situation.

08:58.200 --> 09:05.200
We're learning about Venkman's character. He's manipulative, he's selfish, he doesn't take his work seriously.

09:05.200 --> 09:12.200
And the humor comes from the simple, dramatic irony of the audience being able to see the cards while the students can't.

09:12.200 --> 09:20.200
Now, in the new Ghostbusters movie, well, all the Ghostbusters are played funny nearly all the time, for a start.

09:20.200 --> 09:23.200
But so is almost every other character.

09:23.200 --> 09:30.200
This tour guide has to be funny. The FBI guy has to be funny. The college dean has to be funny.

09:30.200 --> 09:34.200
The food delivery man, even, has to be funny.

09:34.200 --> 09:37.200
Even the antagonist has to be funny.

09:37.200 --> 09:45.200
And then the world shall bend tomorrow. Okay. I apologize, that looks nastier than I intended.

09:45.200 --> 09:52.200
One of the only characters to be played straight is the old-fashioned dean of Columbia University, played by Charles Dance,

09:52.200 --> 09:57.200
who, not so coincidentally, says probably my favorite line in the movie.

09:57.200 --> 10:07.200
Dr. Bronston saw this on Reddit. It was reblogged from a site entitled Ghost News. Not a publication I'd heard of.

10:07.200 --> 10:13.200
Now, the derision with which he says reblogged from a site entitled Ghost News is funny,

10:13.200 --> 10:19.200
because we know his character from earlier and understand that he would hate to say that sentence.

10:19.200 --> 10:25.200
At no point does Charles Dance break character and start riffing and telling awful jokes.

10:25.200 --> 10:29.200
And speaking of, let's talk about the Ghostbusters themselves.

10:29.200 --> 10:34.200
Now, the early scenes in the new Ghostbusters actually gave me hope that it was gonna be really good.

10:34.200 --> 10:38.200
The opening conflict between Erin and Abby is completely fine, in my opinion.

10:38.200 --> 10:42.200
I feel like we get a sense of who these characters are at the start of the movie.

10:42.200 --> 10:50.200
You know, Erin is high-strung, she takes herself and her work seriously, she believes in ghosts but doesn't want anyone to know.

10:51.200 --> 10:57.200
Abby is less serious, believes in ghosts and wants to prove it, and she's angry at Erin for a perceived betrayal.

10:57.200 --> 11:03.200
You know, it's not Hamlet by any means, but the original Ghostbusters characters weren't Hamlet either.

11:03.200 --> 11:07.200
You know, they're fine characters for a comedy movie about ghosts.

11:07.200 --> 11:11.200
They're even given a pretty deep personal reason to want to prove ghosts exist.

11:11.200 --> 11:16.200
When I was eight years old, the mean old lady that lived next door died.

11:16.200 --> 11:26.200
And that night, I woke up and she was standing at the foot of my bed, just staring at me.

11:28.200 --> 11:32.200
She did that every night for almost a year.

11:32.200 --> 11:37.200
Which I thought was a bit serious and probably overkill, but, you know, I'm not really complaining.

11:37.200 --> 11:42.200
And early on, there's some okay to actually pretty good moments with these characters.

11:42.200 --> 11:47.200
I like when Erin's arguing with this guy and pretending that she didn't write the book.

11:47.200 --> 11:51.200
I like her trying to hide her monitor from Charles Dance.

11:51.200 --> 11:54.200
I like Abby and Erin arguing about the book.

11:54.200 --> 11:58.200
You know, it's not hilarious or anything, but it's fine character building.

11:58.200 --> 12:04.200
Now, the big letdown for me is how quickly the movie was willing to completely abandon these characters.

12:04.200 --> 12:10.200
For example, at one point, a paranormal skeptic played by a very tired-looking Bill Murray

12:10.200 --> 12:12.200
comes to see the ghosts they captured.

12:12.200 --> 12:20.200
Then Erin, because she wants to prove ghosts exist so much, lets the ghost out and it murders Bill Murray.

12:20.200 --> 12:25.200
So the Ghostbusters essentially kill a man, which is weird enough by itself, to be honest,

12:25.200 --> 12:27.200
but then not ten seconds later.

12:28.200 --> 12:29.200
Who tore him out the window?

12:29.200 --> 12:31.200
A ghost threw him out the window.

12:31.200 --> 12:34.200
Oh, you mean like Patrick Swayze? Like he's sitting behind you making some pottery?

12:34.200 --> 12:36.200
Yeah, like Patrick Swayze. That's it.

12:36.200 --> 12:43.200
And then we were all dancing at a summer camp in the Catskills, and then we sat down and he was behind me and we made a vase.

12:43.200 --> 12:44.200
Oh, you're combining the two.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.200
I combined a couple of Swayze.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.200
Oh, you know what was a good one? Roadhouse.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.200
I loved Roadhouse.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.200
It was a point break?

12:49.200 --> 12:51.200
It was a point break.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.200
Come on, at the end with a big wave?

12:52.200 --> 12:58.200
Now, why are they doing a little Patrick Swayze movie riff bit with this police officer?

12:58.200 --> 13:00.200
They just saw someone die.

13:01.200 --> 13:06.200
And I'm thinking, well, they just caused the death of a man. Why don't they care about that?

13:06.200 --> 13:13.200
All the early scenes established Erin as a self-serious person who was sensitive to what other people think about her,

13:13.200 --> 13:17.200
but at the first chance to do some jokey jokes, that all gets tossed out.

13:17.200 --> 13:21.200
And I mean, if they're not gonna bother trying to have consistent characterization,

13:21.200 --> 13:27.200
they may as well just have characters with seemingly no motivation whatsoever who act completely randomly all the time.

13:27.200 --> 13:30.200
And speaking of, let's talk about Holtzman.

13:30.200 --> 13:36.200
Now, Holtzman isn't developed enough to even be called a character, really. She's a character trait.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.200
She's wacky.

13:38.200 --> 13:44.200
When she's introduced, she's not really given a clear motivation, but she seems pretty excited about going to see a ghost,

13:44.200 --> 13:49.200
so I'm thinking, okay, she wants to see a ghost. That's her thing.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.200
But when she does see a ghost...

13:59.200 --> 14:03.200
So I'm thinking, oh, she doesn't care about seeing a ghost then?

14:03.200 --> 14:08.200
But now she seems excited she saw a ghost again? Like, what is she doing?

14:09.200 --> 14:11.200
What is this character ever doing?

14:11.200 --> 14:18.200
In fact, almost every time Holtzman was on screen when I watched this movie, I was solely wondering what she was doing and why.

14:18.200 --> 14:23.200
She's like a character void. It's impossible to have an opinion about Holtzman.

14:23.200 --> 14:31.200
And the sad thing here is that all it would have taken was a few lines of exposition at her introduction to give her some grounding in reality.

14:31.200 --> 14:35.200
You know, you can do the wacky scientist thing, and well.

14:35.200 --> 14:38.200
I mean, Egon in the original movie was that to an extent,

14:38.200 --> 14:44.200
but underneath all the wackiness, you still need to have an actual identifiable human.

14:44.200 --> 14:50.200
Of course, Holtzman is given a few lines of humanizing dialogue in the movie that ground her a little.

14:50.200 --> 14:53.200
I didn't think that I would ever really have a friend until I met Abby,

14:53.200 --> 14:57.200
and then I feel like I have a family, I have my own, and I love you. Thank you.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.200
Thank you.

14:59.200 --> 15:02.200
I mean, that was a real thing right there. That was, like, so real.

15:02.200 --> 15:05.200
And Patty's right. That was so real right there.

15:05.200 --> 15:10.200
If only something like that could have came near the start of the movie instead of five minutes from the end,

15:10.200 --> 15:14.200
so I didn't waste two hours wondering if Holtzman was human or not.

15:14.200 --> 15:19.200
And as for Patty, I don't have too much to say about her, to be honest.

15:19.200 --> 15:25.200
She's fine overall, except, oddly enough, for everything that they put in the trailer.

15:25.200 --> 15:30.200
She does break character, least often, out of any of the Ghostbusters, so she gets a point for that.

15:30.200 --> 15:37.200
And speaking of Holtzman and characters who aren't really characters, Kevin, who is stupid.

15:37.200 --> 15:41.200
So stupid as to not even be a human, actually.

15:41.200 --> 15:44.200
I mentioned earlier that I think Hemsworth was miscast.

15:44.200 --> 15:49.200
Not because he's not funny, though he isn't in this.

15:49.200 --> 15:53.200
I mean, he might be a funny guy elsewhere, but in this, he's dreadful.

15:53.200 --> 15:56.200
No, I think he's miscast because he's too famous,

15:56.200 --> 16:01.200
and he thus gets way too much screen time for what should be a minor character.

16:01.200 --> 16:04.200
You can have a minor character who's incredibly stupid, that's fine,

16:04.200 --> 16:10.200
but having several scenes that focus solely on that character where the only joke is that they are stupid,

16:10.200 --> 16:14.200
well, that gets tedious very quickly.

16:14.200 --> 16:17.200
And maybe it's just me, but a lot of the jokes where the punchline is,

16:17.200 --> 16:21.200
Kevin is stupid, are a little... stupid.

16:21.200 --> 16:26.200
Would it be okay if I bring my cat to work sometimes? He has major anxiety problems.

16:26.200 --> 16:32.200
You know what, I would love to let your cat live here with you, but I have a pretty severe cat allergy.

16:32.200 --> 16:36.200
Oh, I don't have a cat. He's a dog. His name's my cat.

16:36.200 --> 16:39.200
Your dog's name is my cat?

16:39.200 --> 16:40.200
Mike Hat.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.200
Your dog's name is Mike, last name Hat.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.200
Well, his full name is Michael Hat.

16:45.200 --> 16:48.200
What the hell are they even talking about, honestly?

16:48.200 --> 16:52.200
Just because he's dumb doesn't mean the writing has to be dumb.

16:52.200 --> 16:56.200
You can have a cleverly constructed joke about a character being stupid.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.200
Okay, one last time.

16:59.200 --> 17:05.200
These are small, but the ones out there are far away.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.200
Small, far away.

17:18.200 --> 17:22.200
A character being stupid should really be the means by which a joke is told,

17:22.200 --> 17:25.200
rather than the punchline in and of itself.

17:26.200 --> 17:30.200
There's only one thing Kevin says in the movie that actually got a laugh out of me,

17:30.200 --> 17:33.200
and that's just because it's a line lifted out of the original.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.200
Ghostbusters, what do you want?

17:37.200 --> 17:39.200
Ghostbusters, what do you want?

17:39.200 --> 17:42.200
So just to be fair here, before I move on to talk about editing,

17:42.200 --> 17:46.200
I'd like to point out some moments that I actually really enjoyed in the new movie.

17:47.200 --> 17:50.200
I like when Erin's trying to warn the mayor about what's gonna happen.

18:03.200 --> 18:06.200
I like when this thing starts spinning around really fast.

18:10.200 --> 18:15.200
I like when the camera footage cuts to a YouTube video playing in Charles Dance's office.

18:15.200 --> 18:19.200
I like when Abby goes to hit the bomb like a baseball and misses.

18:19.200 --> 18:23.200
Although it's not edited very well, but whatever, I like the idea, so I'll give it a pass.

18:24.200 --> 18:28.200
I like when Erin is having a tantrum and picks up the bomb to throw it,

18:28.200 --> 18:30.200
and Abby and Holtzman freak out.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.200
Maybe I just think bombs are funny, I don't know.

18:32.200 --> 18:35.200
Now all of these at least got a smile out of me,

18:35.200 --> 18:39.200
but if you notice something about all these moments, they're all physical comedy.

18:40.200 --> 18:44.200
And the new movie is generally at its strongest when it keeps the humor non-verbal,

18:45.200 --> 18:51.200
which is the nicer way around of saying that the movie's at its weakest when the characters talk.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.200
And bugger me, do they talk.

19:04.200 --> 19:10.200
And talk and talk until any actual comedy present's been run into the ground.

19:10.200 --> 19:16.200
A few visuals actually get ruined to a certain degree because the characters just won't shut up for five seconds.

19:17.200 --> 19:22.200
Let's look at one instance of the same joke that's in both the old Ghostbusters and the new.

19:41.200 --> 19:46.200
The same visual joke, you know, recoiling from the Proton Pack being turned on,

19:46.200 --> 19:50.200
has much less impact in the new movie because, for whatever reason,

19:50.200 --> 19:56.200
someone involved in the production decided that Melissa McCarthy should be yelling over the top of it.

19:56.200 --> 19:59.200
And the constant talking isn't just background noise,

19:59.200 --> 20:06.200
the reluctance to edit it out or cut away from it artificially extends the runtime of a whole bunch of scenes

20:06.200 --> 20:08.200
long past the point where the joke's dead.

20:08.200 --> 20:12.200
And there's a lot of these scenes, but we're just gonna be looking at a select few.

20:12.200 --> 20:15.200
First up is Patty delivering the hearse.

20:16.200 --> 20:20.200
So, fundamentally, what, if anything, is the funny thing about this scene?

20:21.200 --> 20:24.200
Well, on one level, it's a simple reversal of expectation.

20:24.200 --> 20:30.200
The other Ghostbusters weren't expecting the car to be a hearse, and then the car is a hearse.

20:30.200 --> 20:36.200
Now, as a British man, that's enough for me. I'm happy with that right there.

20:36.200 --> 20:43.200
You've got your reversal of expectation, a little irony in the fact that the Ghostbusters drive a hearse.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.200
Job done.

20:44.200 --> 20:50.200
Now, the problem is, this premise isn't funny enough to sustain a full conversation about it.

20:50.200 --> 20:56.200
Now, for all the non-British people in the audience, I'll allow the premise one more joke, maybe, like the following.

20:56.200 --> 20:59.200
Hope you checked to see there wasn't a body in the back.

20:59.200 --> 21:02.200
Uh, I don't think so. I don't really know.

21:02.200 --> 21:03.200
You didn't check?

21:03.200 --> 21:07.200
I mean, I was in a hurry. I checked to see if we had gas. That was more important.

21:07.200 --> 21:11.200
Now, if I were editing this scene, I would have cut to the next scene right there.

21:11.200 --> 21:15.200
Erin jokes that there might be a body in the back of the hearse,

21:15.200 --> 21:19.200
and it turns out that Patty doesn't actually know if there's a body in the back of the hearse.

21:19.200 --> 21:26.200
It's not exactly a knee-slapper, but it's good enough, that is, until the premise gets stretched way too thin.

21:26.200 --> 21:27.200
So there is a body?

21:27.200 --> 21:29.200
Let Hoseman check. She likes that type of stuff.

21:30.200 --> 21:33.200
Yeah, I can think of seven good uses of a cadaver today.

21:33.200 --> 21:37.200
No, Dr. Frankenstein. We gotta turn in the body if there's one in there.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.200
Alright.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.200
Don't do that.

21:40.200 --> 21:48.200
Too many times when I was watching this movie, I was just waiting for the characters to stop talking so that the story would progress.

21:48.200 --> 21:54.200
Let's look at another example like this, and while you're watching, have a think about where you would put the cut to the next scene.

21:55.200 --> 21:58.200
This is an institution of higher learning.

21:58.200 --> 22:03.200
And if you guys want to study ghosts, do it somewhere else, because I have two words for you.

22:03.200 --> 22:05.200
Let me guess. Get out?

22:05.200 --> 22:08.200
No, he's gonna say suck it. He's not gonna say suck it.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.200
Suck it.

22:10.200 --> 22:11.200
You were right.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.200
Oh, my gosh.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.200
I think it might be a ghost.

22:15.200 --> 22:17.200
Oh, no, it's not. It's just a bird.

22:17.200 --> 22:19.200
Bye. There's the door. Later days.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.200
Can you hear this? Let me turn it up.

22:22.200 --> 22:24.200
Oh, my God.

22:25.200 --> 22:27.200
This is incredibly immature behavior.

22:30.200 --> 22:31.200
Got it.

22:31.200 --> 22:33.200
Just a minor setback.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.200
No, guys, I think we can really do this.

22:35.200 --> 22:37.200
Goes on a bit, doesn't it?

22:37.200 --> 22:40.200
So, what's the comedic element to this scene?

22:40.200 --> 22:45.200
It's that you'd expect the dean of a university to be very professional and mature.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.200
A bit like Charles Dance, say.

22:47.200 --> 22:51.200
But this dean is very unprofessional and immature.

22:51.200 --> 22:58.200
So what you want to do, once the scene's fulfilled its narrative purpose, is cut on the most emphatic instance of that.

22:58.200 --> 23:00.200
And if we do that...

23:00.200 --> 23:03.200
This is an institution of higher learning.

23:03.200 --> 23:08.200
And if you guys want to study ghosts, do it somewhere else, because I have two words for you.

23:08.200 --> 23:10.200
Let me guess. Get out?

23:10.200 --> 23:13.200
No, he's gonna say suck it. He's not gonna say suck it.

23:13.200 --> 23:15.200
Suck it.

23:15.200 --> 23:16.200
Just a minor setback.

23:16.200 --> 23:18.200
No, guys, I think we can really do this.

23:18.200 --> 23:21.200
And would you look at that? That's much better.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.200
And let's look at another scene that's in desperate want of editing.

23:24.200 --> 23:28.200
Erin gets fired by Charles Dance after he sees the YouTube video.

23:28.200 --> 23:36.200
And then there's an awful, drawn-out scene of Erin walking down a hallway, pretending to not have been fired to everyone.

23:36.200 --> 23:41.200
And it's unnecessary, and it's crap, and it goes on forever.

23:41.200 --> 23:45.200
Now, in the original Ghostbusters, Stance and Venkman get fired by the Dean,

23:45.200 --> 23:48.200
and we immediately cut to them drinking outside.

23:48.200 --> 23:51.200
And we get it, they've been fired. We don't need it spelled out.

23:51.200 --> 23:54.200
It's funnier if it happens off-screen.

23:54.200 --> 23:59.200
You could cut the whole walking down the corridor riffing on being fired bit entirely,

23:59.200 --> 24:02.200
and just go straight from Charles Dance to the next scene.

24:03.200 --> 24:06.200
Well, I hope you're happy.

24:06.200 --> 24:09.200
That video you posted got me fired.

24:09.200 --> 24:15.200
Or you could go even further with it, and leave the entire firing just implied, with something like this.

24:15.200 --> 24:17.200
Ghosts are real! Ghosts are real!

24:17.200 --> 24:20.200
I believe in ghosts, because they deserve to be real!

24:22.200 --> 24:24.200
Who is that?

24:25.200 --> 24:28.200
Well, I hope you're happy.

24:28.200 --> 24:31.200
That video you posted got me fired.

24:31.200 --> 24:36.200
Sony, send me all the raw footage. I'll cut a good movie out of it, I promise.

24:36.200 --> 24:40.200
It'll only be 40 minutes long, but it'll be really good.

24:40.200 --> 24:44.200
Now, the first Ghostbusters movie was much more sparing with the dialogue,

24:44.200 --> 24:47.200
and they knew how to cut away after a good line.

24:47.200 --> 24:49.200
Do you have any hobbies?

24:51.200 --> 24:53.200
I collect spores, moulds, and fungus.

24:54.200 --> 25:01.200
If that line was in the new movie, they'd probably follow it with 45 seconds of awful improv riffing about fungus.

25:01.200 --> 25:04.200
Now, I don't know where the problems with this movie originated,

25:04.200 --> 25:08.200
in the writing, the direction, the acting, or wherever,

25:08.200 --> 25:14.200
but if there's bad jokes in there, then it needed an editor with the ability to cut them out.

25:14.200 --> 25:16.200
And that just didn't happen, I'm afraid.

25:16.200 --> 25:21.200
Overall, I'd call Ghostbusters 2016 a spooktacular summer hit

25:21.200 --> 25:23.200
that the whole family can enjoy.

25:23.200 --> 25:25.200
Nine stars.
