00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
Hello, everyone. This is a review of the Ghostbusters reboot movie that came out this year.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,240
Now, I just watched this movie recently, and it was a little bit rubbish, to be honest.

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,060
Was it the worst movie ever made?

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:23,260
No. It had a lot of problems, but there were a few things I liked about it, too, so I guess overall I'd call it mediocre.

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,600
And that's not a good place to be for a comedy movie.

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:33,200
I mean, something either makes you laugh, or it doesn't, and for the most part, this movie just didn't make me laugh.

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,600
Now, the original 1984 Ghostbusters movie was really good,

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,100
and the new movie is, in most respects, just a remake of that one, so I thought it'd be interesting to compare the two.

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,800
Now, in a lot of ways, discussing comedy can be quite difficult, you know.

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,800
People have different senses of humor, and they find different things funny.

11
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:59,200
Some people like understated, character-driven comedies, and some people are objectively wrong.

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,700
So, to save myself from saying, in my opinion, roughly a hundred times,

13
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:09,000
I'll just leave a disclaimer here that all my declarative sentences about what is and is not funny,

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,000
they're my own opinions. You're free to disagree.

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,200
And I annoyingly have to make a brief note here about the controversy surrounding the release of the movie.

16
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,800
The internet was pretty mad about this movie before it even came out, and a lot of dumb people said a lot of dumb things.

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,200
So, let's first off list some points which are not the reason that the movie isn't good.

18
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,500
One, because it's got women in it.

19
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,200
No, that doesn't matter at all.

20
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Two, because of Leslie Jones or any other actor or actors.

21
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,100
No, everyone who's in the movie is at least a capable actor.

22
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:50,100
Missed cast, maybe, arguable, but this wasn't the fault of the actors.

23
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,100
Three, because of how poorly it was marketed, the awful trailer, or anything else.

24
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,100
And there's a lot to talk about there, but I'm only interested in what's actually in the movie right now.

25
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,300
So, what were the actual reasons?

26
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,500
Well, after quickly googling how to analyze movies,

27
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:12,400
I've identified a few key areas where I think the reboot underperforms compared to the original.

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,600
Firstly, the script.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,200
Certain things are missing, and certain things are in there that don't need to be.

30
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,600
Secondly, the characters.

31
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,400
Characterization's very patchy, and the characters break character too easily.

32
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,800
Character.

33
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,800
And thirdly, the editing, and this is the big one for me personally.

34
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,600
The movie was edited by someone who, I'm sorry to say, is not good at identifying things which are funny.

35
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,000
Now, the main problem with the comedy in this comedy movie is that it appears to have been written,

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,400
directed, and edited with the following principle in mind.

37
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,200
Jokes are funny, right? So, the more jokes you do, the funnier it is.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Comedy doesn't work that way, I'm afraid.

39
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,000
The movie has a lot of funny moments, but they're stifled by the surrounding unfunny moments.

40
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,000
Comedy, to a large extent, relies on establishing and maintaining a mood.

41
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,400
And it's better to have no joke at all than a bad joke that kills the mood.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Bad jokes prey on good jokes and eat them.

43
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,600
But we'll talk more about that in a little while.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,400
Let's first talk briefly about the story.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,400
Now, both the new movie and the original broadly follow the same basic plot.

46
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,000
Some scientists who believe in ghosts get kicked out of their college or colleges,

47
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
develop technology to catch ghosts,

48
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,800
start a ghost-catching business,

49
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,200
and then they have to face off against some larger paranormal threat,

50
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,200
and they end up saving the city.

51
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,800
Now, the new Ghostbusters makes a few changes to the particulars of the storyline,

52
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,800
some of which are fine, but some of which I think actively harm the story.

53
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,400
Now, the worst of these for me was having the government already know about the ghosts

54
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,800
and engaging in a conspiracy to cover them up.

55
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
And we're not frauds, we are legitimate scientists.

56
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,800
Let me interrupt you. We know you're not frauds.

57
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Because we have been monitoring the situation quite closely.

58
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,200
Agents Hawkins and Rourke are with Homeland Security,

59
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,200
so we've been investigating this extremely quietly.

60
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,200
You see, this kind of robs the Ghostbusters as their unique thing for me.

61
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,200
You know, the ghost thing.

62
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,200
In the old Ghostbusters, the government, represented by the mayor and Walter Peck,

63
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,200
they don't believe in ghosts, and they've got to be convinced of it.

64
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,200
In the new movie, when the Ghostbusters meet the mayor, he's like,

65
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Yeah, ghosts. We know.

66
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,200
And it's like, oh, well, I guess people already know about ghosts,

67
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,200
then that kind of makes the Ghostbusters less special.

68
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,200
And I'm just gonna quickly run through some other structural or storyline changes

69
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
that I felt were detrimental.

70
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,200
Patty joins the Ghostbusters for no reason.

71
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,200
In the first movie, Winston just walked in looking for a job.

72
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,200
In the new movie, Patty is one of the Ghostbusters' first customers.

73
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,200
And that's fine by itself, there's nothing wrong with that.

74
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,200
I might even like that more than the original,

75
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,200
if they gave Patty a solid reason to actually want to join the Ghostbusters.

76
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,200
It feels like there was a scene cut where Patty got fired over the ghost thing,

77
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,200
you know, maybe she keeps telling customers about the ghost,

78
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,200
or her boss fires her for bringing the Ghostbusters there or something like that.

79
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,200
So then she joins the Ghostbusters because they're the only ones who believe her about the ghost.

80
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Instead, she just turns up and demands a job for no clear reason.

81
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,200
She even complains about the job later on in the movie.

82
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,200
I had a good job at the MTA. Was it perfect? No, of course it wasn't perfect.

83
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,200
But I tell you what, everybody was alive.

84
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,200
And the audience is thinking, well, why did you leave the old job again?

85
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:51,200
It wouldn't surprise me if there's a deleted scene of Patty getting fired, to be honest.

86
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,200
No money issues.

87
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,200
In the original Ghostbusters, Venkman talks Stance into ta- Stance?

88
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Stance? Stance? Is that how you say that?

89
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,200
I've written it here, I've never said it out loud. Stance.

90
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,200
In the original Ghostbusters, Bill Murray talks Dan Aykroyd

91
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,200
into taking out an extra mortgage on his house to finance the start of the business,

92
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,200
and they're basically broke when they get their first real job.

93
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,200
And I like this finance element, it's largely missing from the new movie.

94
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,200
They don't even bill the theater guy for catching the demon ghost thing there,

95
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,200
and there's no explanation for how they're able to finance developing all the ghost tech.

96
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,200
No getting famous montage.

97
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:39,200
In the original movie, there's a montage scene of the Ghostbusters in the media,

98
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,200
completing more jobs, and generally showing the passage of time.

99
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:49,200
In the new movie, they catch one ghost and they're immediately, like, immediately on the news and famous,

100
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,200
and I don't know, it just felt a bit rushed.

101
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,200
Too much action near the end of the movie.

102
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:01,200
And this is in turn a problem with the structure, the editing, and just the overall general direction,

103
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,200
but whatever, I'm putting it here.

104
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:10,200
In the original Ghostbusters, what action there was always served the needs of the story or the comedy.

105
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,200
The action seen near the end of the new movie goes on entirely too long

106
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,200
and serves no real purpose beyond showing off a bunch of special effects.

107
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:24,200
That and there's a few genuinely embarrassing moments featuring Holtzmann, but we'll get to her in a bit.

108
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,200
Now all of these are flaws, but none of them are really movie killers.

109
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,200
They'd all be excusable if the movie were funnier.

110
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,200
So let's talk about why it wasn't.

111
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,200
And here's what I think is the most glaring problem with the comedy in the new Ghostbusters movie.

112
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Everyone tries to be funny.

113
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:49,200
Almost every single character, large or small, is played for laughs in a very overstated way.

114
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:56,200
Now in the original Ghostbusters movie, the only character to intentionally crack jokes at any point,

115
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,200
I think, is Venkman.

116
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Every single other character is played pretty much straight.

117
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Scenes with Venkman and one other character resemble a classic double act routine,

118
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,200
with Venkman as the comic and the other character, whoever it is, as the straight man.

119
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Not that the other characters aren't funny. Jeanine is funny. Egon is funny.

120
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:24,200
This hotel attendant trying to hide the ghosts from the guests is funny, but they're not trying to be funny.

121
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,200
The humor comes from their characters and the situation that they're in.

122
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,200
The contrast of characters can be a funny joke in and of itself.

123
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Stance walks out of the elevator, tense and serious, and Venkman follows calmly.

124
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Now, neither is funny by itself, but together the contrast gets a laugh.

125
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:51,200
Or, consider Venkman's introductory scene, where Venkman is lying to the two students about the results of an ESP test.

126
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Now, no one is trying to be funny in this scene. No one's saying funny things. It's just a funny situation.

127
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:05,200
We're learning about Venkman's character. He's manipulative, he's selfish, he doesn't take his work seriously.

128
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:12,200
And the humor comes from the simple, dramatic irony of the audience being able to see the cards while the students can't.

129
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:20,200
Now, in the new Ghostbusters movie, well, all the Ghostbusters are played funny nearly all the time, for a start.

130
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,200
But so is almost every other character.

131
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:30,200
This tour guide has to be funny. The FBI guy has to be funny. The college dean has to be funny.

132
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,200
The food delivery man, even, has to be funny.

133
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,200
Even the antagonist has to be funny.

134
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:45,200
And then the world shall bend tomorrow. Okay. I apologize, that looks nastier than I intended.

135
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:52,200
One of the only characters to be played straight is the old-fashioned dean of Columbia University, played by Charles Dance,

136
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,200
who, not so coincidentally, says probably my favorite line in the movie.

137
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Dr. Bronston saw this on Reddit. It was reblogged from a site entitled Ghost News. Not a publication I'd heard of.

138
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Now, the derision with which he says reblogged from a site entitled Ghost News is funny,

139
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,200
because we know his character from earlier and understand that he would hate to say that sentence.

140
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,200
At no point does Charles Dance break character and start riffing and telling awful jokes.

141
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,200
And speaking of, let's talk about the Ghostbusters themselves.

142
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,200
Now, the early scenes in the new Ghostbusters actually gave me hope that it was gonna be really good.

143
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,200
The opening conflict between Erin and Abby is completely fine, in my opinion.

144
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,200
I feel like we get a sense of who these characters are at the start of the movie.

145
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:50,200
You know, Erin is high-strung, she takes herself and her work seriously, she believes in ghosts but doesn't want anyone to know.

146
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,200
Abby is less serious, believes in ghosts and wants to prove it, and she's angry at Erin for a perceived betrayal.

147
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,200
You know, it's not Hamlet by any means, but the original Ghostbusters characters weren't Hamlet either.

148
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,200
You know, they're fine characters for a comedy movie about ghosts.

149
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,200
They're even given a pretty deep personal reason to want to prove ghosts exist.

150
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,200
When I was eight years old, the mean old lady that lived next door died.

151
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:26,200
And that night, I woke up and she was standing at the foot of my bed, just staring at me.

152
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,200
She did that every night for almost a year.

153
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,200
Which I thought was a bit serious and probably overkill, but, you know, I'm not really complaining.

154
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,200
And early on, there's some okay to actually pretty good moments with these characters.

155
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,200
I like when Erin's arguing with this guy and pretending that she didn't write the book.

156
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,200
I like her trying to hide her monitor from Charles Dance.

157
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,200
I like Abby and Erin arguing about the book.

158
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,200
You know, it's not hilarious or anything, but it's fine character building.

159
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:04,200
Now, the big letdown for me is how quickly the movie was willing to completely abandon these characters.

160
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:10,200
For example, at one point, a paranormal skeptic played by a very tired-looking Bill Murray

161
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
comes to see the ghosts they captured.

162
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:20,200
Then Erin, because she wants to prove ghosts exist so much, lets the ghost out and it murders Bill Murray.

163
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,200
So the Ghostbusters essentially kill a man, which is weird enough by itself, to be honest,

164
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
but then not ten seconds later.

165
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Who tore him out the window?

166
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
A ghost threw him out the window.

167
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,200
Oh, you mean like Patrick Swayze? Like he's sitting behind you making some pottery?

168
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,200
Yeah, like Patrick Swayze. That's it.

169
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:43,200
And then we were all dancing at a summer camp in the Catskills, and then we sat down and he was behind me and we made a vase.

170
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Oh, you're combining the two.

171
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
I combined a couple of Swayze.

172
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,200
Oh, you know what was a good one? Roadhouse.

173
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
I loved Roadhouse.

174
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
It was a point break?

175
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
It was a point break.

176
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,200
Come on, at the end with a big wave?

177
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:58,200
Now, why are they doing a little Patrick Swayze movie riff bit with this police officer?

178
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,200
They just saw someone die.

179
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,200
And I'm thinking, well, they just caused the death of a man. Why don't they care about that?

180
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:13,200
All the early scenes established Erin as a self-serious person who was sensitive to what other people think about her,

181
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,200
but at the first chance to do some jokey jokes, that all gets tossed out.

182
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,200
And I mean, if they're not gonna bother trying to have consistent characterization,

183
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,200
they may as well just have characters with seemingly no motivation whatsoever who act completely randomly all the time.

184
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,200
And speaking of, let's talk about Holtzman.

185
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:36,200
Now, Holtzman isn't developed enough to even be called a character, really. She's a character trait.

186
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
She's wacky.

187
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:44,200
When she's introduced, she's not really given a clear motivation, but she seems pretty excited about going to see a ghost,

188
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,200
so I'm thinking, okay, she wants to see a ghost. That's her thing.

189
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
But when she does see a ghost...

190
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,200
So I'm thinking, oh, she doesn't care about seeing a ghost then?

191
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,200
But now she seems excited she saw a ghost again? Like, what is she doing?

192
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
What is this character ever doing?

193
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:18,200
In fact, almost every time Holtzman was on screen when I watched this movie, I was solely wondering what she was doing and why.

194
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:23,200
She's like a character void. It's impossible to have an opinion about Holtzman.

195
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:31,200
And the sad thing here is that all it would have taken was a few lines of exposition at her introduction to give her some grounding in reality.

196
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,200
You know, you can do the wacky scientist thing, and well.

197
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,200
I mean, Egon in the original movie was that to an extent,

198
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:44,200
but underneath all the wackiness, you still need to have an actual identifiable human.

199
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:50,200
Of course, Holtzman is given a few lines of humanizing dialogue in the movie that ground her a little.

200
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,200
I didn't think that I would ever really have a friend until I met Abby,

201
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,200
and then I feel like I have a family, I have my own, and I love you. Thank you.

202
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,200
Thank you.

203
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,200
I mean, that was a real thing right there. That was, like, so real.

204
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,200
And Patty's right. That was so real right there.

205
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:10,200
If only something like that could have came near the start of the movie instead of five minutes from the end,

206
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,200
so I didn't waste two hours wondering if Holtzman was human or not.

207
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:19,200
And as for Patty, I don't have too much to say about her, to be honest.

208
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:25,200
She's fine overall, except, oddly enough, for everything that they put in the trailer.

209
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,200
She does break character, least often, out of any of the Ghostbusters, so she gets a point for that.

210
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:37,200
And speaking of Holtzman and characters who aren't really characters, Kevin, who is stupid.

211
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,200
So stupid as to not even be a human, actually.

212
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,200
I mentioned earlier that I think Hemsworth was miscast.

213
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:49,200
Not because he's not funny, though he isn't in this.

214
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,200
I mean, he might be a funny guy elsewhere, but in this, he's dreadful.

215
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,200
No, I think he's miscast because he's too famous,

216
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:01,200
and he thus gets way too much screen time for what should be a minor character.

217
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,200
You can have a minor character who's incredibly stupid, that's fine,

218
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:10,200
but having several scenes that focus solely on that character where the only joke is that they are stupid,

219
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,200
well, that gets tedious very quickly.

220
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,200
And maybe it's just me, but a lot of the jokes where the punchline is,

221
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,200
Kevin is stupid, are a little... stupid.

222
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,200
Would it be okay if I bring my cat to work sometimes? He has major anxiety problems.

223
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:32,200
You know what, I would love to let your cat live here with you, but I have a pretty severe cat allergy.

224
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,200
Oh, I don't have a cat. He's a dog. His name's my cat.

225
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Your dog's name is my cat?

226
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Mike Hat.

227
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,200
Your dog's name is Mike, last name Hat.

228
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,200
Well, his full name is Michael Hat.

229
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,200
What the hell are they even talking about, honestly?

230
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,200
Just because he's dumb doesn't mean the writing has to be dumb.

231
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,200
You can have a cleverly constructed joke about a character being stupid.

232
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,200
Okay, one last time.

233
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:05,200
These are small, but the ones out there are far away.

234
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,200
Small, far away.

235
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,200
A character being stupid should really be the means by which a joke is told,

236
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,200
rather than the punchline in and of itself.

237
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,200
There's only one thing Kevin says in the movie that actually got a laugh out of me,

238
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,200
and that's just because it's a line lifted out of the original.

239
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,200
Ghostbusters, what do you want?

240
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
Ghostbusters, what do you want?

241
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,200
So just to be fair here, before I move on to talk about editing,

242
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,200
I'd like to point out some moments that I actually really enjoyed in the new movie.

243
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,200
I like when Erin's trying to warn the mayor about what's gonna happen.

244
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,200
I like when this thing starts spinning around really fast.

245
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,200
I like when the camera footage cuts to a YouTube video playing in Charles Dance's office.

246
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,200
I like when Abby goes to hit the bomb like a baseball and misses.

247
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Although it's not edited very well, but whatever, I like the idea, so I'll give it a pass.

248
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,200
I like when Erin is having a tantrum and picks up the bomb to throw it,

249
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,200
and Abby and Holtzman freak out.

250
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,200
Maybe I just think bombs are funny, I don't know.

251
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,200
Now all of these at least got a smile out of me,

252
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,200
but if you notice something about all these moments, they're all physical comedy.

253
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,200
And the new movie is generally at its strongest when it keeps the humor non-verbal,

254
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:51,200
which is the nicer way around of saying that the movie's at its weakest when the characters talk.

255
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
And bugger me, do they talk.

256
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:10,200
And talk and talk until any actual comedy present's been run into the ground.

257
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:16,200
A few visuals actually get ruined to a certain degree because the characters just won't shut up for five seconds.

258
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Let's look at one instance of the same joke that's in both the old Ghostbusters and the new.

259
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,200
The same visual joke, you know, recoiling from the Proton Pack being turned on,

260
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,200
has much less impact in the new movie because, for whatever reason,

261
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:56,200
someone involved in the production decided that Melissa McCarthy should be yelling over the top of it.

262
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,200
And the constant talking isn't just background noise,

263
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:06,200
the reluctance to edit it out or cut away from it artificially extends the runtime of a whole bunch of scenes

264
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,200
long past the point where the joke's dead.

265
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,200
And there's a lot of these scenes, but we're just gonna be looking at a select few.

266
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,200
First up is Patty delivering the hearse.

267
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,200
So, fundamentally, what, if anything, is the funny thing about this scene?

268
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,200
Well, on one level, it's a simple reversal of expectation.

269
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:30,200
The other Ghostbusters weren't expecting the car to be a hearse, and then the car is a hearse.

270
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:36,200
Now, as a British man, that's enough for me. I'm happy with that right there.

271
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:43,200
You've got your reversal of expectation, a little irony in the fact that the Ghostbusters drive a hearse.

272
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,200
Job done.

273
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:50,200
Now, the problem is, this premise isn't funny enough to sustain a full conversation about it.

274
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:56,200
Now, for all the non-British people in the audience, I'll allow the premise one more joke, maybe, like the following.

275
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Hope you checked to see there wasn't a body in the back.

276
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,200
Uh, I don't think so. I don't really know.

277
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
You didn't check?

278
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,200
I mean, I was in a hurry. I checked to see if we had gas. That was more important.

279
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,200
Now, if I were editing this scene, I would have cut to the next scene right there.

280
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,200
Erin jokes that there might be a body in the back of the hearse,

281
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,200
and it turns out that Patty doesn't actually know if there's a body in the back of the hearse.

282
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:26,200
It's not exactly a knee-slapper, but it's good enough, that is, until the premise gets stretched way too thin.

283
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
So there is a body?

284
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,200
Let Hoseman check. She likes that type of stuff.

285
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,200
Yeah, I can think of seven good uses of a cadaver today.

286
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,200
No, Dr. Frankenstein. We gotta turn in the body if there's one in there.

287
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
Alright.

288
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Don't do that.

289
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:48,200
Too many times when I was watching this movie, I was just waiting for the characters to stop talking so that the story would progress.

290
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:54,200
Let's look at another example like this, and while you're watching, have a think about where you would put the cut to the next scene.

291
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,200
This is an institution of higher learning.

292
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,200
And if you guys want to study ghosts, do it somewhere else, because I have two words for you.

293
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,200
Let me guess. Get out?

294
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,200
No, he's gonna say suck it. He's not gonna say suck it.

295
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,200
Suck it.

296
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
You were right.

297
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
Oh, my gosh.

298
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,200
I think it might be a ghost.

299
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
Oh, no, it's not. It's just a bird.

300
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,200
Bye. There's the door. Later days.

301
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Can you hear this? Let me turn it up.

302
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,200
Oh, my God.

303
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
This is incredibly immature behavior.

304
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,200
Got it.

305
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
Just a minor setback.

306
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
No, guys, I think we can really do this.

307
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
Goes on a bit, doesn't it?

308
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,200
So, what's the comedic element to this scene?

309
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,200
It's that you'd expect the dean of a university to be very professional and mature.

310
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
A bit like Charles Dance, say.

311
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,200
But this dean is very unprofessional and immature.

312
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:58,200
So what you want to do, once the scene's fulfilled its narrative purpose, is cut on the most emphatic instance of that.

313
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,200
And if we do that...

314
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,200
This is an institution of higher learning.

315
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,200
And if you guys want to study ghosts, do it somewhere else, because I have two words for you.

316
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,200
Let me guess. Get out?

317
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,200
No, he's gonna say suck it. He's not gonna say suck it.

318
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
Suck it.

319
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,200
Just a minor setback.

320
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,200
No, guys, I think we can really do this.

321
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,200
And would you look at that? That's much better.

322
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,200
And let's look at another scene that's in desperate want of editing.

323
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Erin gets fired by Charles Dance after he sees the YouTube video.

324
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:36,200
And then there's an awful, drawn-out scene of Erin walking down a hallway, pretending to not have been fired to everyone.

325
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,200
And it's unnecessary, and it's crap, and it goes on forever.

326
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,200
Now, in the original Ghostbusters, Stance and Venkman get fired by the Dean,

327
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,200
and we immediately cut to them drinking outside.

328
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,200
And we get it, they've been fired. We don't need it spelled out.

329
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,200
It's funnier if it happens off-screen.

330
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,200
You could cut the whole walking down the corridor riffing on being fired bit entirely,

331
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,200
and just go straight from Charles Dance to the next scene.

332
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,200
Well, I hope you're happy.

333
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,200
That video you posted got me fired.

334
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:15,200
Or you could go even further with it, and leave the entire firing just implied, with something like this.

335
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
Ghosts are real! Ghosts are real!

336
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,200
I believe in ghosts, because they deserve to be real!

337
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,200
Who is that?

338
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,200
Well, I hope you're happy.

339
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,200
That video you posted got me fired.

340
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,200
Sony, send me all the raw footage. I'll cut a good movie out of it, I promise.

341
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,200
It'll only be 40 minutes long, but it'll be really good.

342
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,200
Now, the first Ghostbusters movie was much more sparing with the dialogue,

343
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,200
and they knew how to cut away after a good line.

344
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,200
Do you have any hobbies?

345
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,200
I collect spores, moulds, and fungus.

346
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:01,200
If that line was in the new movie, they'd probably follow it with 45 seconds of awful improv riffing about fungus.

347
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,200
Now, I don't know where the problems with this movie originated,

348
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,200
in the writing, the direction, the acting, or wherever,

349
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:14,200
but if there's bad jokes in there, then it needed an editor with the ability to cut them out.

350
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,200
And that just didn't happen, I'm afraid.

351
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,200
Overall, I'd call Ghostbusters 2016 a spooktacular summer hit

352
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
that the whole family can enjoy.

353
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,200
Nine stars.
