00:00.000 --> 00:05.840
Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about controversial online influencer Andrew Tate,

00:05.840 --> 00:12.000
who was recently arrested in Romania under suspicion of human trafficking and being part of an organized crime group.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.920
Tate and his brother are currently being detained by Romanian authorities while they are investigated.

00:17.920 --> 00:22.960
Andrew Tate is a former kickboxer who rose to internet fame by promoting a quote,

00:22.960 --> 00:30.960
an ultra-masculine, ultra-luxurious lifestyle in various clips and interviews that have been shared widely on social media.

00:30.960 --> 00:37.120
He gives a lot of self-help advice, and he's also made a lot of money with his website Hustlers University,

00:37.120 --> 00:41.760
a subscription-based service that claims to help subscribers get rich quick.

00:41.760 --> 00:48.800
Now, I call Andrew Tate controversial because while there are a lot of people who are outraged about a lot of the things he says,

00:48.800 --> 00:54.720
there are also a lot of people, particularly younger men, who think there is a lot of value in his message.

00:54.720 --> 00:57.040
And this might be surprising to hear.

00:57.040 --> 01:01.760
For instance, Andrew Tate openly calls himself a misogynist and a sexist,

01:01.760 --> 01:05.600
and argues men should have authority over the women in their lives,

01:05.600 --> 01:09.920
statements which have caused him to be banned from several social media websites.

01:09.920 --> 01:13.520
These statements, coupled with his recent human trafficking arrest,

01:13.520 --> 01:19.360
might cause someone unfamiliar with Andrew Tate to wonder what exactly it is that his fans see in him.

01:19.360 --> 01:24.640
I asked on Twitter for anyone who is either a fan of Andrew Tate or knows a fan of Andrew Tate

01:24.640 --> 01:29.520
to message me with an explanation of what it is they like about him or his content.

01:29.520 --> 01:35.120
And I got hundreds of responses in tweets and DMs and emails from people answering me.

01:35.120 --> 01:40.000
So let me share my findings with you after reading all of those replies.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.960
Firstly, a lot of the time on social media, Andrew Tate is being deliberately exaggerated and playing a bit of a character.

01:46.960 --> 01:51.120
And the majority of the people watching his content seem to understand that.

01:51.120 --> 01:54.080
They get that he's being deliberately over the top.

01:54.080 --> 01:58.720
He says controversial things on purpose to chase social media engagement,

01:58.720 --> 02:05.920
and most of the people who watch his content seem open to excusing some of the worst things he says using that justification.

02:05.920 --> 02:14.160
And the idea that Andrew Tate is just playing a character is something his lawyer has already been putting out there to defend him in his recent legal troubles.

02:14.160 --> 02:20.960
Because unfortunately for Andrew Tate's lawyer, Andrew Tate keeps admitting to crimes. On camera.

02:20.960 --> 02:27.920
So his defense is the same one that other over-the-top controversial media figures use when they get into legal trouble.

02:27.920 --> 02:28.560
They say,

02:30.560 --> 02:34.960
Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson have both used this line of argument.

02:34.960 --> 02:43.440
We're so ridiculous, we're so outlandish, we're so unreasonable that nobody watching could possibly believe anything we say.

02:43.440 --> 02:50.400
And indeed, most of the people who watch Andrew Tate's content seem to understand this and don't believe everything he says.

02:50.400 --> 02:59.680
But I know from reading all those responses on Twitter that there is also that minority of fans who do take everything he says seriously.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.400
They totally believe in the character.

03:02.480 --> 03:07.600
These are the people who are signing up to Hustlers University and sending Andrew Tate their money.

03:07.600 --> 03:16.000
You know, this is the less savvy minority who you can trick into thinking the best way for them to make money is to send you all of their money.

03:16.000 --> 03:23.840
But regardless of how much someone believes in Andrew Tate's messaging, what is it he's saying that young men are connecting with in the first place?

03:23.840 --> 03:33.680
Well, if you watch a few popular clips of Andrew Tate, you'll see him tell an anecdote that I think is a good representation of why his message appeals to certain young men today.

03:33.680 --> 03:42.720
He talks about being a younger man himself and for the first time realizing just how vast the gulf is between regular people and the ultra-rich.

03:42.720 --> 03:52.880
So, as a young, poor man, Andrew Tate was thinking about buying a car and was absolutely amazed to see a Ferrari being sold for hundreds of thousands of pounds.

03:52.880 --> 04:02.000
This stunned the young Andrew Tate. He was broke, but there were people out there who could afford to spend all that money just on a car.

04:02.000 --> 04:08.320
He was struggling to get by at the bottom of the ladder, but there were people at the top of the ladder who got to do whatever they want,

04:08.320 --> 04:13.280
spending huge sums of money on unnecessary indulgences like fancy cars.

04:13.280 --> 04:19.760
He was blown away by the disparity in wealth and he resolved to not spend the rest of his life as a peasant.

04:19.760 --> 04:27.600
He was going to make himself into a more successful man, climb that ladder by himself, and one day, he'd be rich.

04:27.600 --> 04:35.520
And to a lot of broke men in the same position as the young Andrew Tate at the start of his story, you can see why this would be appealing, right?

04:35.520 --> 04:45.920
He was in your position too, but now he's rich. So maybe if you listen to him and do the things he tells you he did, you'll also be able to afford a Ferrari one day.

04:45.920 --> 04:50.560
Now, regardless of the conclusions drawn here, there is truth in the foundation.

04:50.560 --> 04:56.800
You know, a real problem with the world has been identified. And this is what draws young men in initially.

04:56.800 --> 05:03.360
If you agree with Andrew Tate's assessment of society being unfair, if you connect with some of his self-help advice,

05:03.360 --> 05:07.200
then you might be willing to listen to some of his more controversial ideas.

05:07.200 --> 05:11.360
And the most common controversy for Andrew Tate is misogyny.

05:11.360 --> 05:20.160
As I mentioned, Andrew Tate openly describes himself as a misogynist and a sexist, and is repeatedly argued in favour of a patriarchal worldview.

05:20.160 --> 05:23.120
So let's talk about the idea of patriarchy.

05:23.120 --> 05:30.000
Now, I'm going to talk very broadly here, but typically patriarchy has been the norm throughout a lot of human history.

05:30.000 --> 05:36.960
We've had kingdoms and empires and religions overwhelmingly headed by men, emphasizing the importance of the male line,

05:36.960 --> 05:44.160
men being considered the head of the household, with women often not having the same rights as men under law, or even just being considered property.

05:44.160 --> 05:48.960
Men have historically ranked above women in most power structures, is the point.

05:48.960 --> 05:56.000
Now, I'm going to say something relatively cruel, kind of an uncomfortable truth that I need to be careful about expressing.

05:56.000 --> 06:03.360
For dudes who just suck, like they're not particularly interesting or funny or kind or successful,

06:03.360 --> 06:10.080
for men who just don't have much to offer a woman, well, they used to be able to offer an income.

06:10.080 --> 06:15.920
They could at least be providers at a time when it was more difficult for a woman to provide for herself.

06:15.920 --> 06:20.400
However, with the advancement of women's rights in a lot of places over the last century,

06:20.400 --> 06:25.120
with women being able to go into higher education and work a wider range of jobs,

06:25.120 --> 06:28.800
gaining the ability to divorce husbands they don't like and so on,

06:28.800 --> 06:33.280
as well as it becoming increasingly acceptable to be unmarried later in life,

06:33.280 --> 06:39.520
there's simply less financial and social pressure on women to settle for men who just aren't very good.

06:39.520 --> 06:42.720
And there's something related to consider here, too.

06:42.720 --> 06:47.840
What men are able to provide financially on one income isn't what it once was.

06:47.840 --> 06:52.480
We still live in the aftermath of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression,

06:52.480 --> 06:57.360
and the economy has not been doing too great for the average person, to put it lightly.

06:57.360 --> 07:01.600
Average wages have been relatively stagnant for decades in a lot of places,

07:01.600 --> 07:06.400
the ultra-rich control a larger and larger proportion of the world's resources.

07:06.400 --> 07:11.840
Most of the people watching this video will live in societies which are increasingly unequal.

07:11.840 --> 07:17.040
So for those men who only have resources to bring to the table when seeking a partner,

07:17.040 --> 07:23.600
what they're providing is on average both less necessary and smaller in value than it once might have been.

07:23.600 --> 07:28.560
This is all a recipe for creating a group of lonely, aggrieved, and desperate men

07:28.560 --> 07:32.880
who feel unable to meet the expectations that society has for them.

07:32.880 --> 07:37.840
And the reason I said I need to be careful in talking about this is because this set of circumstances

07:37.840 --> 07:43.920
can prime this group of lonely, aggrieved, and desperate men to fall for two ideologies in particular

07:43.920 --> 07:46.080
that I consider to be very harmful.

07:46.080 --> 07:48.080
One is the incel path.

07:48.080 --> 07:52.960
Men who believe they are supposedly of irredeemably low value in today's quote,

07:53.920 --> 07:56.800
and so they blame things beyond their control.

07:56.800 --> 08:00.560
They claim nothing can be done and they sink into despair.

08:00.560 --> 08:04.080
The other ideology is the reactionary conservative route.

08:04.080 --> 08:07.120
People who argue we should hit reverse on social progress

08:07.120 --> 08:11.360
and take society back to a time where women were in their rightful place.

08:11.360 --> 08:16.800
These are related sets of ideas because they both see women as something deserved by men.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.280
Women aren't really people in these world views,

08:19.280 --> 08:23.680
they're just another object a man can own to signal his status to other men,

08:23.680 --> 08:26.400
like a big house or a fancy car.

08:26.400 --> 08:30.240
This group of men are also very easy prey for grifters.

08:30.240 --> 08:34.400
Andrew Tate's projection of wealth and superficial signifiers of success

08:34.400 --> 08:38.160
can appeal to lonely and economically anxious men.

08:38.160 --> 08:41.920
If you listen to me and sign up for Pyramid Scheme University,

08:41.920 --> 08:47.520
you too can have a massive house and 10 sports cars and 20 girlfriends or whatever else.

08:47.520 --> 08:50.480
Now this might seem silly, and it is,

08:50.480 --> 08:53.600
but we're living in a world where even the sort of success enjoyed

08:53.600 --> 08:58.480
by the previous couple of generations is a ridiculous pipe dream for a lot of young people.

08:58.480 --> 09:01.360
You know, one regular house and one regular car

09:01.360 --> 09:05.280
and one singular girlfriend seem out of reach for a lot of young men.

09:05.280 --> 09:09.600
And if you're going to believe in a pipe dream, why not shoot for the moon, you know?

09:09.600 --> 09:13.760
This is something a lot of adults don't get about Andrew Tate and people like him,

09:13.760 --> 09:18.320
because, let's be honest, to most even moderately well-adjusted adults today,

09:18.320 --> 09:20.960
Andrew Tate looks very silly indeed.

09:20.960 --> 09:27.120
He's like a cartoon character of a pompous rich guy bragging about his money and expensive cars.

09:27.120 --> 09:33.920
You know, it's ridiculous behavior that signals to his fellow adults insecurity and immaturity.

09:33.920 --> 09:38.800
And as I mentioned earlier, even a lot of his fans aren't really taking him seriously all the time.

09:38.800 --> 09:42.960
They understand he is being deliberately provocative and exaggerated.

09:42.960 --> 09:48.400
But his target audience isn't those moderately well-adjusted adults who think he's silly.

09:48.400 --> 09:52.800
It's not the people who can tell when he's joking or being deliberately provocative.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.120
It's the few people who can't.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.360
It's the people who take him seriously.

09:57.360 --> 10:03.040
This is a point made very well by Hbomberguy when describing Alex Jones in a video I'll link below,

10:03.040 --> 10:06.640
but it applies equally well here, so I will shamelessly steal it.

10:07.200 --> 10:12.720
Andrew Tate being over-the-top and ridiculous doesn't hurt him in reaching his target audience.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.640
It actually acts as a filter.

10:14.640 --> 10:19.440
If you can tell he's unserious, well, you're not going to be sending him money anyway.

10:19.440 --> 10:23.360
But if you take him seriously, if you believe what he's saying,

10:23.360 --> 10:26.240
even when he's being as ridiculous as possible,

10:26.240 --> 10:30.800
then you just might be gullible enough to sign up for Hustlers University.

10:30.800 --> 10:33.760
Those people are the real target audience.

10:33.760 --> 10:38.160
Any relatively mature adult knows not to fall for get-rich-quick schemes

10:38.160 --> 10:40.880
that promise huge returns for no investment.

10:40.880 --> 10:43.680
And the Hustlers University website literally promises

10:43.680 --> 10:46.560
to teach you how to get returns for zero investment.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.000
But so what?

10:48.000 --> 10:49.120
We're not after them.

10:49.120 --> 10:55.040
We're after the immature, the inexperienced, the people who don't know that this is rubbish.

10:55.040 --> 10:59.360
This is part of the reason for Tate's popularity with young men in particular,

10:59.360 --> 11:04.640
because one group of immature and inexperienced people is, obviously, teenagers.

11:04.640 --> 11:08.480
Teenagers are insecure and immature and inexperienced,

11:08.480 --> 11:10.800
and often don't have much that they can call their own.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.240
And of course, they wouldn't.

11:12.240 --> 11:13.200
That's not an insult.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.360
That's just what it's like being a teenager.

11:15.360 --> 11:20.960
And to be fair to teenage boys, understanding how they should act as men can be confusing.

11:20.960 --> 11:25.760
You'll often hear from the right wing that masculinity is in crisis today.

11:25.760 --> 11:27.120
But it isn't, really.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.000
What is in crisis is patriarchy.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.960
Patriarchy is being eroded over time.

11:32.960 --> 11:36.880
Conservatives simply equate patriarchy with masculinity.

11:36.880 --> 11:38.880
Those words mean the same thing to them.

11:38.880 --> 11:44.080
But the social changes we've talked about today are moving society away from patriarchy.

11:44.080 --> 11:47.840
But this transition is leading to some confusion in younger men,

11:47.840 --> 11:52.880
because during the transition, they're hearing contradictory messages all the time.

11:52.880 --> 11:56.480
Younger generations are raised by older generations, after all,

11:56.480 --> 12:00.160
and their older attitudes to social issues can be passed down.

12:00.160 --> 12:05.760
Media from previous generations still exists and reflects the attitudes of the time it was made,

12:05.760 --> 12:08.480
and a lot of it still influences modern media.

12:08.480 --> 12:13.520
So, very broadly, we have two messages that young men are hearing as they're growing up.

12:13.520 --> 12:16.560
One is that everybody is fundamentally equal.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.640
Women should be treated with respect.

12:18.640 --> 12:23.200
They should show kindness and understanding and empathy to everyone, right?

12:23.200 --> 12:26.400
The other message young men are hearing is that they need to be, quote,

12:26.400 --> 12:29.600
real men, patriarchs, alpha males,

12:29.600 --> 12:33.920
and women are their lessers who should be put in their place and made subservient.

12:33.920 --> 12:38.480
There was some discourse on Twitter lately about what the left can do to appeal to young men,

12:38.480 --> 12:42.960
with one tweet in particular claiming that men flock to the right because the left gives, quote,

12:42.960 --> 12:44.800
brain dead advice to young men.

12:45.360 --> 12:50.240
Now, I disagree with this opinion, firstly because I think it's overly simplistic.

12:50.240 --> 12:54.160
Young men today are not neutrally considering different ideologies

12:54.160 --> 12:59.120
and picking the one that gives the best advice or has the most attractive branding or whatever.

12:59.120 --> 13:02.800
The truth is that these ideologies are offering completely different,

13:02.800 --> 13:04.560
incomparable things.

13:04.560 --> 13:08.800
What the right wing is offering is patriarchy and all its promises,

13:08.800 --> 13:14.480
backed up by an entire human history's worth of traditions and stories and myths.

13:14.480 --> 13:18.960
Follow us, act as we tell you to act, and you'll be a real man,

13:18.960 --> 13:22.160
the top of the pyramid above everyone else,

13:22.160 --> 13:25.920
and women, in particular, will have to do what you say.

13:25.920 --> 13:31.920
Now, the left, in turn, offers equality, nobody being inherently better than anyone else,

13:31.920 --> 13:37.200
but what that means in practice for a lot of young men is that women do not have to do what they say.

13:37.200 --> 13:41.360
They can say no to you. They don't need your resources to survive.

13:41.360 --> 13:45.600
To attract a mate, you can't rely on being simply necessary anymore.

13:45.600 --> 13:49.920
Now you have to be desirable, and that can feel like a much more vulnerable,

13:49.920 --> 13:51.680
emotional position to be in.

13:51.680 --> 13:55.120
This is more than an issue of advice or branding or so on.

13:55.120 --> 13:58.240
It is, in fact, one of the major political divides.

13:58.320 --> 14:03.360
Actually, the single most important political question you could be asked, in my opinion,

14:03.360 --> 14:08.400
do you think some groups of people are inherently superior to other groups of people?

14:08.400 --> 14:12.000
Now, the right can offer easy affirmations to young white men here.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.880
They can say, yes, you are better than other people.

14:14.880 --> 14:16.800
You do deserve to be on top.

14:16.800 --> 14:19.840
Follow us, and we'll make sure that's where you are.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.840
Now, the left has a much harder job.

14:21.840 --> 14:24.240
They don't have those easy affirmations.

14:24.240 --> 14:29.120
What they're saying to young men is that you are not inherently superior to anyone else.

14:29.120 --> 14:32.080
Everyone, including you, should be equal.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.280
Now, on the surface, that is a much harder sell.

14:35.280 --> 14:38.320
But admittedly, the left can make a mistake here,

14:38.320 --> 14:43.120
and that mistake is accepting the right's claim that life will be better for young,

14:43.120 --> 14:46.320
in particular, white men under patriarchy.

14:46.320 --> 14:49.440
I've seen some on the left claim that these men are unreachable,

14:49.440 --> 14:53.840
because of course they aren't going to want to give up their privilege and live worse lives

14:53.840 --> 14:54.800
because of it.

14:54.800 --> 14:58.000
Patriarchy is beneficial to these men, is the claim,

14:58.000 --> 15:00.160
so they're never going to want to give it up.

15:00.160 --> 15:03.920
But the truth here is that patriarchy is not good for men.

15:03.920 --> 15:07.680
At the very least, it is not good for the vast majority of men.

15:07.680 --> 15:11.280
Now, I'm far from the first person to make this observation, of course.

15:11.280 --> 15:14.160
I'd advise reading The Will to Change by Bell Hooks

15:14.160 --> 15:17.120
if you want to see someone making this point much better than I can.

15:17.120 --> 15:19.120
But yes, the truth here,

15:19.120 --> 15:22.240
one that should be utilized as much as possible by the left,

15:22.240 --> 15:27.040
is that patriarchy punishes men far more often than it rewards them.

15:27.040 --> 15:30.320
The things that patriarchy promises to men are lies,

15:30.320 --> 15:35.120
and men have far more to gain in rejecting patriarchy than accepting it.

15:35.120 --> 15:36.480
So let's explore that,

15:36.480 --> 15:42.400
and we'll start off by talking about the concept of masculinity and traditional masculine values.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.560
Now, different people will have different ideas

15:44.560 --> 15:48.080
about what exactly counts as a traditional masculine value, of course,

15:48.160 --> 15:51.520
but typically you'll hear words like strength, leadership,

15:51.520 --> 15:54.480
confidence, independence, and things like that.

15:54.480 --> 15:56.880
And the first point I'd like to make about all these traits

15:56.880 --> 16:01.040
is that they are, by themselves, morally and ethically neutral.

16:01.040 --> 16:03.600
Take a man who is strong, for instance.

16:03.600 --> 16:07.520
He can use that strength to work hard and provide for his family,

16:07.520 --> 16:12.640
or he can use that strength to abuse and dominate his family and make them fearful of him.

16:12.640 --> 16:16.080
Leadership, obviously, isn't automatically a virtue.

16:16.080 --> 16:19.600
We can all imagine an incompetent political leader, for instance.

16:20.240 --> 16:24.880
Confidence can be misplaced and easily turn into arrogance, and so on.

16:24.880 --> 16:29.680
These words don't really tell us anything about the worth of a person by themselves.

16:29.680 --> 16:33.440
What matters is how those qualities are used and expressed.

16:33.440 --> 16:36.800
The next point I'd like to make here is that these particular values

16:36.800 --> 16:42.000
and the way they are both expressed and considered by others are relative over time.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.360
As an example, the modern West derives many of its founding ideas about philosophy,

16:47.360 --> 16:52.480
science, art, law, politics, and so on from classical Greek culture,

16:52.480 --> 16:56.080
but many places in ancient Greece had very different ideas to us

16:56.080 --> 16:59.440
about what counts as traditionally manly behaviour.

16:59.440 --> 17:03.600
My favourite example here is the accounts of the sacred band of Thebes,

17:03.600 --> 17:06.400
the elite fighting force of the Theban army,

17:06.400 --> 17:10.400
which was made up of 150 pairs of male lovers.

17:10.480 --> 17:13.120
And honestly, I can see an argument here.

17:13.120 --> 17:17.520
What's more masculine than a bunch of tough warrior dudes loving each other

17:17.520 --> 17:19.680
with no women in sight, right?

17:19.680 --> 17:23.760
Even something as simple as pink being associated with baby girls

17:23.760 --> 17:27.120
and blue with baby boys changes over time.

17:27.120 --> 17:31.680
100 years ago in the United States, these colours were reversed, for instance.

17:31.680 --> 17:35.040
But people can still place a disproportionate amount of importance

17:35.040 --> 17:38.560
on these completely arbitrary gendered signifiers.

17:38.560 --> 17:41.840
For instance, I remember my sister once causing a bit of a stare

17:41.840 --> 17:48.000
among the older members of my family for daring to put her infant son in a pink car seat,

17:48.000 --> 17:53.040
as if by merely touching something pink coloured, her son would be forever tainted by it.

17:53.040 --> 17:56.320
You know, he'll clearly grow up to be feminine or gay or whatever

17:56.320 --> 17:59.680
just because one time he sat in a pink chair.

17:59.680 --> 18:04.640
And I'd like to talk for a bit about that sort of masculine insecurity,

18:04.800 --> 18:08.800
particularly fears about men appearing feminine or homosexual.

18:08.800 --> 18:14.160
And as a fictional example here, let me tell you about my favourite scene from The Sopranos.

18:14.160 --> 18:20.240
So, The Sopranos is a crime drama TV show focused on mafia boss Tony Soprano.

18:20.240 --> 18:24.320
It's an interesting show to consider in relation to the topic of masculinity,

18:24.320 --> 18:28.960
as Tony often struggles with the expectations of the highly traditionalist

18:28.960 --> 18:31.840
and patriarchal criminal world he inhabits.

18:31.840 --> 18:35.600
So, minor spoilers for The Sopranos for this next part.

18:35.600 --> 18:40.080
In the scene I want to talk about, Tony is talking to his therapist Dr. Melfi

18:40.080 --> 18:46.160
about the fact that one of his mafia subordinates, Vito, has been outed as homosexual.

18:46.160 --> 18:48.080
Tony is pretty stressed out.

18:48.080 --> 18:50.800
Vito is one of his best guys, he says,

18:50.800 --> 18:55.280
but his other criminal associates aren't going to want to work with a gay man.

18:55.280 --> 18:59.440
Melfi asks Tony how he personally feels about homosexuality,

18:59.440 --> 19:02.160
and he immediately says he thinks it's disgusting,

19:02.160 --> 19:07.360
an opinion which would be expected and unquestioned in a room full of his male peers.

19:07.360 --> 19:13.440
But as Tony continues to talk and tries to defend this position, he starts to contradict himself.

19:13.440 --> 19:18.560
He complains that every TV show these days is rubbing his nose in homosexuality

19:18.560 --> 19:20.560
by including gay characters,

19:20.560 --> 19:24.800
but then he admits that he likes to show the L-word with Jennifer Beals.

19:24.800 --> 19:27.440
He points out that he's a strict Catholic,

19:27.440 --> 19:29.920
even though he's a murderer, an adulterer,

19:29.920 --> 19:32.960
and various other things that make that defense very silly.

19:32.960 --> 19:37.760
When Melfi points out that many of Tony's associates will have had sex with men in prison,

19:37.760 --> 19:38.800
he says they, quote,

19:38.800 --> 19:42.400
get a pass for that on account of there being no women in prison,

19:42.400 --> 19:44.880
to which Melfi replies sarcastically,

19:44.880 --> 19:46.240
well, that's nice.

19:46.240 --> 19:50.960
Tony is quick to point out to Melfi that he didn't engage in homosexual behavior

19:50.960 --> 19:52.800
when he was incarcerated.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.840
He's worried that she will question his masculinity,

19:55.840 --> 20:00.480
and when she obviously doesn't care either way, he accuses her of thinking he's lying.

20:00.480 --> 20:03.600
Tony is worried about accusations of homosexuality,

20:03.600 --> 20:07.280
and Melfi's refusal to judge him or consider him less of a man

20:07.280 --> 20:10.160
is a challenge to his patriarchal worldview.

20:10.160 --> 20:15.920
That she wouldn't think any less of him if he were gay actually annoys him, funnily enough.

20:15.920 --> 20:21.760
My favorite part of this scene is when Tony runs out of steam trying to justify his homophobia.

20:21.760 --> 20:23.120
He gives up trying.

20:23.680 --> 20:26.080
Away from the judgment of his male peers,

20:26.080 --> 20:30.400
talking to a woman who will not consider him less of a man for saying so,

20:30.400 --> 20:35.120
Tony finally admits that he doesn't really care if Vito is gay.

20:35.120 --> 20:37.360
It doesn't really bother him.

20:37.360 --> 20:41.440
He can't actually defend his initial display of disgust.

20:41.440 --> 20:45.840
However, when Dr. Melfi salutes Tony's new outlook, he responds,

20:45.840 --> 20:48.560
it's a tall fucking order, I'll tell you that.

20:48.560 --> 20:49.680
And he's right.

20:49.680 --> 20:55.360
You know, it's all well and good for Tony to be accepting of gay people here in his therapist's office,

20:55.360 --> 21:01.200
but back out there in his day-to-day life, Tony is expected to be and act homophobic.

21:01.200 --> 21:04.640
If he doesn't act like he finds homosexuality disgusting,

21:04.640 --> 21:09.840
other men will judge him and question his masculinity and his heterosexuality,

21:09.840 --> 21:12.080
and maybe even get violent with him.

21:12.080 --> 21:16.880
Even though Tony is not actually homophobic when he sits and thinks about it,

21:16.880 --> 21:22.080
he's still expected to, in a sense, perform homophobia for his male peers

21:22.080 --> 21:25.120
in order to signal his own masculinity to them.

21:25.120 --> 21:30.000
Now, obviously, the response Tony might face as the head of an organized crime family

21:30.000 --> 21:33.600
is probably a bit more dramatic than for the average person,

21:33.600 --> 21:36.640
but even if it doesn't always start a mob war or whatever,

21:36.640 --> 21:40.800
men can still face social repercussions for refusing to act in a way

21:40.800 --> 21:44.880
that reinforces traditional notions of patriarchal masculinity.

21:44.880 --> 21:50.640
Now, regardless of what he thinks, Tony Soprano is still homophobic in his actions,

21:50.640 --> 21:52.240
I think it's important to say,

21:52.240 --> 21:55.520
and he actually ends up ordering Vito be killed,

21:55.520 --> 21:57.840
something he doesn't actually want to do,

21:57.840 --> 22:01.840
but ends up feeling that he has to do because it's expected of him.

22:01.840 --> 22:06.560
My point here is that Tony is the boss, the patriarch, the alpha male,

22:06.560 --> 22:08.800
but instead of that bringing him freedom,

22:08.800 --> 22:12.400
he finds instead that his behavior is tightly restrained,

22:12.400 --> 22:16.960
controlled by a patriarchal social system and its expectations of him.

22:16.960 --> 22:20.880
Patriarchy makes him miserable, it makes him insecure,

22:20.880 --> 22:24.560
and it makes him do things that he doesn't actually want to do.

22:24.560 --> 22:27.520
So I have two points to make about patriarchy here.

22:27.520 --> 22:30.640
The first is that patriarchy, more often than not,

22:30.640 --> 22:34.080
steals the qualities it expects men to exhibit.

22:34.080 --> 22:36.880
It demands confidence and self-assurance,

22:36.880 --> 22:40.160
but really it will make you insecure and afraid,

22:40.160 --> 22:42.800
afraid of appearing weak or feminine,

22:42.800 --> 22:46.480
and worried about not being considered enough of a real man.

22:46.480 --> 22:52.640
Any confidence patriarchy can give you will be a false front propped up by insecurities.

22:52.640 --> 22:55.360
The second point I want to make is that, funnily enough,

22:55.360 --> 22:58.160
a challenging or breaking with patriarchy

22:58.160 --> 23:03.600
often requires you to exhibit those very same qualities that patriarchy would expect of you.

23:03.600 --> 23:09.360
It can take courage and confidence and strength to challenge norms or break with tradition,

23:09.360 --> 23:12.880
and someone can go along with tradition not because they actually want to,

23:12.880 --> 23:16.160
but out of cowardice and fear and weakness.

23:16.160 --> 23:18.400
So what's actually more important here?

23:18.400 --> 23:22.160
Adhering to a particular set of traditional masculine norms,

23:22.160 --> 23:25.760
you know, a particular look or set of social behaviors,

23:25.760 --> 23:30.800
or is it actually embodying qualities like courage and confidence and leadership,

23:30.800 --> 23:34.880
even if doing so means breaking with those traditional norms?

23:34.880 --> 23:38.480
As another example in fiction, let's look at Billy Elliot.

23:38.480 --> 23:43.600
So Billy Elliot is a movie about a young boy who discovers he really likes ballet dancing,

23:43.600 --> 23:45.840
a traditionally feminine activity,

23:45.840 --> 23:49.840
and he insists upon practicing ballet even though it causes the men in his family

23:49.840 --> 23:52.880
to get angry with him and question his masculinity.

23:52.880 --> 23:57.920
But Billy keeps on doing it because it's what he wants to do, and he's good at it.

23:57.920 --> 24:02.480
So we can ask, who is actually being more manly in this story?

24:02.480 --> 24:05.440
And it really depends on what we mean by manly.

24:05.440 --> 24:08.400
If we're only talking about the way people present themselves

24:08.400 --> 24:11.920
and the sorts of traditionally gendered activities they engage in,

24:11.920 --> 24:14.800
Billy isn't being very manly at all by ballet dancing.

24:14.800 --> 24:18.400
On the other hand, Billy is the one with the courage and confidence

24:18.400 --> 24:22.640
to stand up to his older male relatives, to do what he wants to do,

24:22.640 --> 24:24.960
whereas they're being controlled by fear.

24:24.960 --> 24:28.240
Fear of how people will react to Billy dancing,

24:28.240 --> 24:32.240
how it will make him look, and how it will make them look in turn.

24:32.240 --> 24:35.600
I guess I'm taking a long time to say, what's more important,

24:35.600 --> 24:39.600
the way you present yourself, the way other men perceive you,

24:39.600 --> 24:41.680
or the way you actually are?

24:41.680 --> 24:44.000
There's a scene in Game of Thrones I like,

24:44.000 --> 24:48.320
where King Joffrey is being a cruel little wanker, as usual,

24:48.320 --> 24:52.080
causing his uncle Tyrion to insult him, again as usual,

24:52.080 --> 24:54.720
to which Joffrey gets incredibly angry and shouts,

24:54.720 --> 24:56.160
I am the king.

24:56.160 --> 25:00.080
Joffrey then gets put in his place by Tywin, the real power in the room,

25:00.080 --> 25:02.160
who rebukes Joffrey by saying,

25:02.160 --> 25:05.760
any man who must say I am the king is no true king.

25:06.320 --> 25:09.040
I get reminded of this scene whenever I see a quote

25:09.040 --> 25:12.480
alpha male influencer yelling about their own manliness

25:12.480 --> 25:14.720
and insisting other people recognise it.

25:14.720 --> 25:17.680
Not that I believe in the whole alpha male thing, of course,

25:17.680 --> 25:22.480
but they do, and if they really were alpha males as they understand it,

25:22.480 --> 25:25.040
they wouldn't need to shout about it, would they?

25:25.040 --> 25:26.400
They just would be.

25:26.960 --> 25:31.680
If that's really how people worked, how they naturally related to each other,

25:31.680 --> 25:33.840
then they wouldn't need to shout about it.

25:33.840 --> 25:39.040
We've spent a lot of time talking about negative expressions of masculine stereotypes today,

25:39.040 --> 25:43.600
so let's move on to have a think about the concept of positive masculinity.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.960
So I asked on Twitter what people think of when they hear the phrase

25:46.960 --> 25:51.440
positive masculinity, and I got a lot of responses.

25:51.440 --> 25:56.160
Most people who responded did so with either a picture or a name of a good man.

25:56.160 --> 25:59.360
Usually a historical figure or celebrity they admire

25:59.360 --> 26:03.600
or a character from fiction who is a man with many positive traits.

26:03.600 --> 26:07.760
I got a lot of characters from video games and comic books and animated shows

26:07.760 --> 26:10.960
and a lot of Aragorn from Lord of the Rings.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.800
Just so much Aragorn.

26:12.800 --> 26:16.320
The people really love Aragorn, it turns out.

26:16.320 --> 26:20.640
And when I first read through the replies to this tweet, I was confused.

26:20.640 --> 26:23.360
I asked about positive masculinity,

26:23.360 --> 26:26.240
and a lot of people just sent me pictures of good men.

26:26.240 --> 26:29.680
You know, aren't they misunderstanding the homework assignment here?

26:29.680 --> 26:32.800
There has to be more to the idea of positive masculinity

26:32.800 --> 26:35.440
than just being a man who is good, right?

26:36.240 --> 26:37.280
Or does there?

26:37.280 --> 26:39.040
Let's have a think about it.

26:39.040 --> 26:44.000
So when I think of positive masculinity, I think first of my dad.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.560
My dad is a typical man's man.

26:46.560 --> 26:49.360
He's traditionally masculine in a lot of ways.

26:49.360 --> 26:50.640
He's big and strong.

26:50.640 --> 26:52.880
He works a traditionally masculine job.

26:52.880 --> 26:54.560
He's a truck driver.

26:54.560 --> 26:58.240
He likes having a pint with the lads down the pub and watching the football,

26:58.240 --> 26:59.360
all that sort of thing.

26:59.360 --> 27:02.960
And I have no memories of my childhood where I saw my dad engaging

27:02.960 --> 27:05.840
in any traditionally feminine hobbies or pastimes.

27:05.840 --> 27:09.040
It was all sports and poker and action movies.

27:09.040 --> 27:12.400
And my dad likes and values those aspects of himself,

27:12.400 --> 27:14.320
and since I know he watches my videos,

27:14.320 --> 27:18.560
I'm certain he'll be agreeing very happily with this description of himself.

27:18.560 --> 27:22.800
Anyway, all we're doing so far is describing a traditionally masculine man.

27:23.440 --> 27:27.920
The thing that actually makes my father an example of positive masculinity to me

27:27.920 --> 27:31.680
is that he's never insisted other people have to agree with

27:31.680 --> 27:34.880
or accept his notions of gendered behaviors.

27:34.880 --> 27:39.360
I have no memories of him trying to force me to be a particular type of man,

27:39.360 --> 27:42.240
nor my sister a particular type of woman.

27:42.240 --> 27:46.080
If I ever wanted to play with traditionally feminine toys, for example,

27:46.080 --> 27:50.160
or if my sister wanted to dress in more traditionally masculine clothes,

27:50.160 --> 27:52.000
he was happy to support that.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.280
He never insisted that certain toys were only for girls,

27:55.280 --> 27:58.880
or only boys wear those particular clothes, or so on.

27:58.880 --> 28:02.960
Now, this permissive outlook is maybe unusual for a man of his generation.

28:03.520 --> 28:06.640
Although, even though he's my dad, I don't want to be too flattering here,

28:06.640 --> 28:11.200
so I'll say he can still be a stubborn old git in a lot of typically masculine ways.

28:11.200 --> 28:14.080
You know, he's reluctant to accept help when he needs it.

28:14.080 --> 28:16.960
He doesn't like to express his emotions and all that.

28:16.960 --> 28:21.280
But still, whatever the concepts of masculinity or femininity mean to him,

28:21.280 --> 28:24.000
it's always seemed like it was a personal opinion,

28:24.000 --> 28:27.840
one that he never tried to force other people to adhere to.

28:27.840 --> 28:33.760
And this was a common theme in most of the examples of positive masculinity people sent me on Twitter.

28:33.760 --> 28:37.040
Whether fictional or real, people sent me examples of men

28:37.040 --> 28:41.360
who do not force a particular type of masculinity on others.

28:41.360 --> 28:45.520
They themselves might be very traditionally masculine, or not at all,

28:45.520 --> 28:50.000
but whatever they are themselves, they're confident and content enough in themselves

28:50.000 --> 28:52.800
to exist alongside other ways of being.

28:52.800 --> 28:56.560
This would be the core of a positive masculinity to me.

28:56.560 --> 29:00.160
You can possess all those typically masculine descriptors,

29:00.160 --> 29:02.560
but not use them to control others.

29:02.560 --> 29:05.840
You know, you can have strength without using it to dominate.

29:05.840 --> 29:09.440
You can offer protection without needing to claim ownership.

29:09.440 --> 29:12.800
You can lead without demanding others follow you.

29:12.800 --> 29:18.960
Positive masculinity is, to me, a masculinity that doesn't lay sole claim to its descriptors,

29:18.960 --> 29:22.800
that recognises abstract concepts like strength and leadership

29:22.800 --> 29:25.840
do not belong exclusively to masculinity,

29:25.840 --> 29:29.840
especially not to just one particular type of masculinity.

29:29.840 --> 29:32.080
So, this all sounds nice, doesn't it?

29:32.080 --> 29:35.920
What if we had all of the good parts, but without any of the bad parts?

29:35.920 --> 29:38.480
It is easier said than done, isn't it?

29:38.480 --> 29:42.720
But you might be wondering here, what does masculinity mean, really,

29:42.720 --> 29:47.760
if we don't insist that any of the adjectives we use to describe it are exclusive to it?

29:47.760 --> 29:51.120
Or indeed, what does femininity mean for the same reason?

29:51.120 --> 29:56.560
If a woman is strong, say, is that woman exhibiting a traditionally masculine trait,

29:56.560 --> 29:59.360
or is it an example of feminine strength?

29:59.360 --> 30:04.000
Or if a man is compassionate, say, is he exhibiting a traditionally feminine trait,

30:04.000 --> 30:06.480
or is it an example of masculine compassion?

30:07.120 --> 30:10.880
Maybe it can be both, or maybe it doesn't have to be either.

30:10.880 --> 30:16.560
You might ask why we bother to gender these behaviours at all if anyone can exhibit the traits.

30:16.560 --> 30:20.480
I personally like to think of the gender aspect as more of a flavouring

30:20.480 --> 30:23.120
than a strictly necessary ingredient.

30:23.120 --> 30:26.160
You know, if you're a man, and you're trying to be a good man,

30:26.160 --> 30:31.600
you should first try to be a good person, and being a good man will follow on from that.

30:31.600 --> 30:36.320
You know, if all you worry about is the man part, you're just gonna come across as insecure.

30:36.400 --> 30:41.120
I feel like I should wrap up today by giving some actual advice to young men.

30:41.120 --> 30:42.800
Why not, right? It can't hurt.

30:42.800 --> 30:49.280
So, not to brag, but I am a generally happy and relatively successful 34-year-old man,

30:49.280 --> 30:55.040
and here's all the best advice I can think of that I wish someone had told me when I was younger.

30:55.040 --> 30:59.280
Firstly, if you value yourself by the acquisition of things,

30:59.280 --> 31:03.360
you're never going to be satisfied, because there's always more things.

31:03.360 --> 31:07.840
If you give someone who values themselves like this ten fancy sports cars,

31:07.840 --> 31:12.080
you know what they're gonna want, right? Eleven fancy sports cars.

31:12.080 --> 31:18.160
A lack of money can make you miserable, but an excess of money is not going to make you happy.

31:18.160 --> 31:23.040
Next, you don't actually want a fancy sports car, trust me.

31:23.040 --> 31:28.320
If someone hands you a mega-expensive supercar, you should sell it immediately

31:28.320 --> 31:32.080
and buy something that can go over a speed bump without cracking in half.

31:32.640 --> 31:34.560
Or, like, a bicycle.

31:34.560 --> 31:40.240
They're not real cars, these things. They're expensive ornaments that you have to pay to maintain.

31:40.240 --> 31:45.040
If you actually get one, most people are just gonna assume that you're compensating for something.

31:45.040 --> 31:51.760
On self-improvement, if you're going to improve yourself, you are going to improve yourself.

31:51.760 --> 31:55.040
Anyone on the internet who is selling some indispensable method

31:55.040 --> 31:59.200
to make you successful and happy and rich is lying to you.

31:59.280 --> 32:03.200
Also, if it were that easy to get rich quick, nobody would be poor.

32:03.200 --> 32:07.040
Only one person is guaranteed to get rich in those sorts of schemes,

32:07.040 --> 32:09.360
and it's the person running the scheme.

32:09.360 --> 32:14.240
The person most likely to get rich in a gold rush is the guy selling the shovels.

32:14.240 --> 32:17.600
There's usually two parts to these sorts of scams, right?

32:17.600 --> 32:21.760
The part where you can get rich doing it, which never lasts very long

32:21.760 --> 32:24.960
because then people find out about it and it stops working

32:24.960 --> 32:27.440
because a ton of people try to do it at once.

32:27.440 --> 32:32.640
After that, the only way to get rich with it is to sell the scam on to other people and say,

32:32.640 --> 32:37.520
look, I got rich doing this, so can you, even though it doesn't work anymore.

32:37.520 --> 32:40.640
If it still worked, they wouldn't be telling you about it.

32:40.640 --> 32:45.360
And if you're hearing about it, especially from a source that looks like an advertisement,

32:45.360 --> 32:48.560
it's too late. You're the one being scammed now.

32:48.560 --> 32:52.560
Next, if you're going to improve yourself, you should do it for you.

32:52.560 --> 32:57.680
Because you are a person too. You matter. You should respect and value yourself.

32:57.680 --> 33:01.520
Don't try to make yourself into something you think other people will want.

33:01.520 --> 33:04.320
Make yourself into something you want to be.

33:04.320 --> 33:09.600
If you focus on that, you'll be happier, you'll be more confident, and everything else will follow.

33:09.600 --> 33:11.520
So let's talk about women.

33:11.520 --> 33:14.320
Now, if you're a young man attracted to women,

33:14.320 --> 33:18.720
you're probably more than a little curious about what women want, right?

33:18.720 --> 33:22.240
And if you want to know what women want, you know who you should listen to?

33:22.800 --> 33:26.400
That's right, it's other single men on the internet.

33:26.400 --> 33:29.200
No, it's not. It's women.

33:29.200 --> 33:32.000
Because women are people, they are individuals,

33:32.000 --> 33:35.920
they have inner lives and thoughts and feelings just the same as you.

33:35.920 --> 33:40.720
They can tell you what they want, but it's on you to listen to what they say.

33:40.720 --> 33:45.120
There are plenty of women out there who are desperately lonely for a man to treat them

33:46.080 --> 33:50.480
but they're surrounded by dudes who only treat them like characters in a dating sim,

33:50.480 --> 33:56.480
trying to speedrun their clothes off by using the right ratio of pickup lines to negs or whatever else.

33:56.480 --> 33:59.040
In my experience, what women are most attracted to

33:59.040 --> 34:03.600
is when someone shows an actual interest in getting to know them as people.

34:03.600 --> 34:07.120
Next, not to be mean, but for young men in particular,

34:07.120 --> 34:11.600
most women you meet around your age and older will be onto your shit.

34:11.600 --> 34:13.920
If you're not genuine, they'll know.

34:13.920 --> 34:19.360
If you're just pretending to be nice to get sex from them, you'll be spotted immediately, trust me.

34:19.360 --> 34:22.400
And I know this is going to be a knock to the ego of a lot of young men,

34:22.400 --> 34:24.720
it certainly was for me when I was younger,

34:24.720 --> 34:28.320
but there are women out there who are just savvier than you are.

34:28.320 --> 34:33.280
They are beyond your ability to manipulate and they've been reading you like a book.

34:33.280 --> 34:36.480
And I know it's hard if you're hearing this for the first time.

34:36.480 --> 34:42.560
I'm not joking, it was a real blow for me when I first realized I wasn't as smooth as I thought I was.

34:42.560 --> 34:47.040
But don't worry, you can change your behavior and find something genuine.

34:47.040 --> 34:50.240
Not only should you not try to manipulate women,

34:50.800 --> 34:54.560
because it's wrong, of course, but you don't have to manipulate women.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.960
They're just other people, not aliens,

34:56.960 --> 35:00.800
and by and large, they want the same things that you want already.

35:00.800 --> 35:05.680
Also, if you're lonely, focus on meeting people in general,

35:05.680 --> 35:08.160
not just people you want to have sex with.

35:08.160 --> 35:11.520
Sex won't make you any less lonely just by itself.

35:11.520 --> 35:15.360
In fact, just by itself, it will probably make you more lonely.

35:15.360 --> 35:19.120
Making connections with other people is the important thing there.

35:19.120 --> 35:20.880
I know it's easy for me to say,

35:20.880 --> 35:24.320
don't focus so much on the sex part, but it is true.

35:24.320 --> 35:27.840
It's very easy to try too hard in that department.

35:27.840 --> 35:32.480
Not many women are going to like it if they sense that you feel entitled to sex.

35:32.480 --> 35:36.400
Next, women aren't a hive mind, but they do talk to each other,

35:36.400 --> 35:40.400
and one of the things they're going to talk to each other about is you.

35:40.400 --> 35:43.760
People are going to discuss you when you're not in the room.

35:43.760 --> 35:45.920
If you're a creepy weirdo to one woman,

35:45.920 --> 35:49.760
she's going to tell the other women she knows that you're a creepy weirdo.

35:49.760 --> 35:52.320
On the other hand, if you're nice, if you're friendly,

35:52.320 --> 35:56.320
or do some act of kindness without expecting anything in return,

35:56.320 --> 35:59.040
that's what people will be saying about you instead.

35:59.040 --> 36:03.040
So do kind things, not just because it's the right thing to do,

36:03.040 --> 36:05.520
but for the sake of your own reputation.

36:05.520 --> 36:09.520
And this idea, you'll hear people say that women don't like nice guys

36:09.520 --> 36:12.080
and only respond to men who treat them mean.

36:12.080 --> 36:14.560
That's a load of rubbish, trust me.

36:14.560 --> 36:19.040
What you'll find is that one thing many people are attracted to is confidence.

36:19.040 --> 36:21.600
And you can be a confident jerk, yes,

36:21.600 --> 36:24.800
but you can be a kind person and confident too.

36:24.800 --> 36:28.560
If you go from being a shy shut-in who never interacts with women

36:28.560 --> 36:31.920
to a confident jerk who does interact with women,

36:31.920 --> 36:33.920
yes, you'll meet more women.

36:33.920 --> 36:38.240
Wow, but the jerk part is not necessary there, is it?

36:38.240 --> 36:41.120
And I'll give one final bit of advice today.

36:41.120 --> 36:44.640
Don't take life advice from people like Andrew Tate,

36:44.640 --> 36:47.840
not just because he used to get kicked in the head for a living,

36:47.840 --> 36:52.000
and not just because he's currently covered in lice and cockroaches in a jail cell,

36:52.000 --> 36:54.240
and not just because he's an admitted rapist.

36:55.200 --> 36:58.320
Well, actually, yes, don't listen to him for all those reasons,

36:58.320 --> 37:01.600
but also don't listen to him because he's wrong.

37:01.600 --> 37:05.680
At the start of the video, I talked about the anecdote of the young Andrew Tate

37:05.680 --> 37:07.920
realizing that society is unfair,

37:07.920 --> 37:10.160
that there are a tiny minority of rich people

37:10.160 --> 37:13.040
hoarding a vast majority of the world's wealth.

37:13.040 --> 37:17.120
Now, he looked at this unfair exploitative system and he said,

37:17.120 --> 37:22.160
I'm going to climb up it by myself so I can buy a car.

37:23.040 --> 37:27.760
This is a small, selfish, and cowardly way to look at the world.

37:27.760 --> 37:30.480
When he realized society was unfair,

37:30.480 --> 37:33.920
he didn't set out to change it to make it more fair.

37:33.920 --> 37:36.640
He set out to take advantage of the unfairness,

37:36.640 --> 37:39.440
to be a rich man exploiting poor men,

37:39.440 --> 37:42.640
instead of a poor man being exploited by the rich.

37:42.640 --> 37:46.080
And he got rich, partly, by swindling money out of men

37:46.080 --> 37:49.120
who are in the same low position he was when he was broke.

37:49.680 --> 37:52.400
Is this what real men are supposed to do?

37:52.400 --> 37:56.480
Say, I'm gonna get mine, regardless of what I have to do to get there.

37:56.480 --> 37:59.280
I don't care how silly I make myself look.

37:59.280 --> 38:01.600
I don't care who I have to exploit.

38:01.600 --> 38:04.640
I will have a Ferrari one day.

38:04.640 --> 38:08.080
I can't imagine a more miserable outlook, I don't think.

38:08.080 --> 38:11.840
And for any of his fans who've stuck around to the end of the video today,

38:11.840 --> 38:14.960
can you honestly still tell me, with a straight face,

38:14.960 --> 38:19.440
that choosing to live like he does has made Andrew Tate happy?

38:19.440 --> 38:22.400
Anyway, thanks a lot for watching today, folks.

38:22.400 --> 38:26.640
And as always, thank you especially to all my supporters over on Patreon,

38:26.640 --> 38:28.960

38:31.520 --> 38:34.640
as well as access to a few of my old unlisted videos

38:34.640 --> 38:37.280
