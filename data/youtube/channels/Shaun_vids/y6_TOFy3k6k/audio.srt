00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about controversial online influencer Andrew Tate,

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:12,000
who was recently arrested in Romania under suspicion of human trafficking and being part of an organized crime group.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,920
Tate and his brother are currently being detained by Romanian authorities while they are investigated.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,960
Andrew Tate is a former kickboxer who rose to internet fame by promoting a quote,

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:30,960
an ultra-masculine, ultra-luxurious lifestyle in various clips and interviews that have been shared widely on social media.

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,120
He gives a lot of self-help advice, and he's also made a lot of money with his website Hustlers University,

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,760
a subscription-based service that claims to help subscribers get rich quick.

8
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,800
Now, I call Andrew Tate controversial because while there are a lot of people who are outraged about a lot of the things he says,

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,720
there are also a lot of people, particularly younger men, who think there is a lot of value in his message.

10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,040
And this might be surprising to hear.

11
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,760
For instance, Andrew Tate openly calls himself a misogynist and a sexist,

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,600
and argues men should have authority over the women in their lives,

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,920
statements which have caused him to be banned from several social media websites.

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,520
These statements, coupled with his recent human trafficking arrest,

15
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,360
might cause someone unfamiliar with Andrew Tate to wonder what exactly it is that his fans see in him.

16
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,640
I asked on Twitter for anyone who is either a fan of Andrew Tate or knows a fan of Andrew Tate

17
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,520
to message me with an explanation of what it is they like about him or his content.

18
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,120
And I got hundreds of responses in tweets and DMs and emails from people answering me.

19
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,000
So let me share my findings with you after reading all of those replies.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,960
Firstly, a lot of the time on social media, Andrew Tate is being deliberately exaggerated and playing a bit of a character.

21
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,120
And the majority of the people watching his content seem to understand that.

22
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,080
They get that he's being deliberately over the top.

23
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,720
He says controversial things on purpose to chase social media engagement,

24
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:05,920
and most of the people who watch his content seem open to excusing some of the worst things he says using that justification.

25
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:14,160
And the idea that Andrew Tate is just playing a character is something his lawyer has already been putting out there to defend him in his recent legal troubles.

26
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,960
Because unfortunately for Andrew Tate's lawyer, Andrew Tate keeps admitting to crimes. On camera.

27
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:27,920
So his defense is the same one that other over-the-top controversial media figures use when they get into legal trouble.

28
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,560
They say,

29
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,960
Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson have both used this line of argument.

30
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:43,440
We're so ridiculous, we're so outlandish, we're so unreasonable that nobody watching could possibly believe anything we say.

31
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,400
And indeed, most of the people who watch Andrew Tate's content seem to understand this and don't believe everything he says.

32
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:59,680
But I know from reading all those responses on Twitter that there is also that minority of fans who do take everything he says seriously.

33
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,400
They totally believe in the character.

34
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,600
These are the people who are signing up to Hustlers University and sending Andrew Tate their money.

35
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:16,000
You know, this is the less savvy minority who you can trick into thinking the best way for them to make money is to send you all of their money.

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,840
But regardless of how much someone believes in Andrew Tate's messaging, what is it he's saying that young men are connecting with in the first place?

37
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:33,680
Well, if you watch a few popular clips of Andrew Tate, you'll see him tell an anecdote that I think is a good representation of why his message appeals to certain young men today.

38
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:42,720
He talks about being a younger man himself and for the first time realizing just how vast the gulf is between regular people and the ultra-rich.

39
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:52,880
So, as a young, poor man, Andrew Tate was thinking about buying a car and was absolutely amazed to see a Ferrari being sold for hundreds of thousands of pounds.

40
00:03:52,880 --> 00:04:02,000
This stunned the young Andrew Tate. He was broke, but there were people out there who could afford to spend all that money just on a car.

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,320
He was struggling to get by at the bottom of the ladder, but there were people at the top of the ladder who got to do whatever they want,

42
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,280
spending huge sums of money on unnecessary indulgences like fancy cars.

43
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,760
He was blown away by the disparity in wealth and he resolved to not spend the rest of his life as a peasant.

44
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:27,600
He was going to make himself into a more successful man, climb that ladder by himself, and one day, he'd be rich.

45
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:35,520
And to a lot of broke men in the same position as the young Andrew Tate at the start of his story, you can see why this would be appealing, right?

46
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:45,920
He was in your position too, but now he's rich. So maybe if you listen to him and do the things he tells you he did, you'll also be able to afford a Ferrari one day.

47
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,560
Now, regardless of the conclusions drawn here, there is truth in the foundation.

48
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,800
You know, a real problem with the world has been identified. And this is what draws young men in initially.

49
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,360
If you agree with Andrew Tate's assessment of society being unfair, if you connect with some of his self-help advice,

50
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,200
then you might be willing to listen to some of his more controversial ideas.

51
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,360
And the most common controversy for Andrew Tate is misogyny.

52
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:20,160
As I mentioned, Andrew Tate openly describes himself as a misogynist and a sexist, and is repeatedly argued in favour of a patriarchal worldview.

53
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,120
So let's talk about the idea of patriarchy.

54
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:30,000
Now, I'm going to talk very broadly here, but typically patriarchy has been the norm throughout a lot of human history.

55
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,960
We've had kingdoms and empires and religions overwhelmingly headed by men, emphasizing the importance of the male line,

56
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:44,160
men being considered the head of the household, with women often not having the same rights as men under law, or even just being considered property.

57
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,960
Men have historically ranked above women in most power structures, is the point.

58
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:56,000
Now, I'm going to say something relatively cruel, kind of an uncomfortable truth that I need to be careful about expressing.

59
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,360
For dudes who just suck, like they're not particularly interesting or funny or kind or successful,

60
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:10,080
for men who just don't have much to offer a woman, well, they used to be able to offer an income.

61
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,920
They could at least be providers at a time when it was more difficult for a woman to provide for herself.

62
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,400
However, with the advancement of women's rights in a lot of places over the last century,

63
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,120
with women being able to go into higher education and work a wider range of jobs,

64
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,800
gaining the ability to divorce husbands they don't like and so on,

65
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,280
as well as it becoming increasingly acceptable to be unmarried later in life,

66
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,520
there's simply less financial and social pressure on women to settle for men who just aren't very good.

67
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,720
And there's something related to consider here, too.

68
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,840
What men are able to provide financially on one income isn't what it once was.

69
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,480
We still live in the aftermath of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression,

70
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,360
and the economy has not been doing too great for the average person, to put it lightly.

71
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,600
Average wages have been relatively stagnant for decades in a lot of places,

72
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,400
the ultra-rich control a larger and larger proportion of the world's resources.

73
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,840
Most of the people watching this video will live in societies which are increasingly unequal.

74
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,040
So for those men who only have resources to bring to the table when seeking a partner,

75
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:23,600
what they're providing is on average both less necessary and smaller in value than it once might have been.

76
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,560
This is all a recipe for creating a group of lonely, aggrieved, and desperate men

77
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,880
who feel unable to meet the expectations that society has for them.

78
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,840
And the reason I said I need to be careful in talking about this is because this set of circumstances

79
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,920
can prime this group of lonely, aggrieved, and desperate men to fall for two ideologies in particular

80
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,080
that I consider to be very harmful.

81
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
One is the incel path.

82
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,960
Men who believe they are supposedly of irredeemably low value in today's quote,

83
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,800
and so they blame things beyond their control.

84
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,560
They claim nothing can be done and they sink into despair.

85
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,080
The other ideology is the reactionary conservative route.

86
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,120
People who argue we should hit reverse on social progress

87
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,360
and take society back to a time where women were in their rightful place.

88
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,800
These are related sets of ideas because they both see women as something deserved by men.

89
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,280
Women aren't really people in these world views,

90
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,680
they're just another object a man can own to signal his status to other men,

91
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,400
like a big house or a fancy car.

92
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,240
This group of men are also very easy prey for grifters.

93
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,400
Andrew Tate's projection of wealth and superficial signifiers of success

94
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,160
can appeal to lonely and economically anxious men.

95
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,920
If you listen to me and sign up for Pyramid Scheme University,

96
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:47,520
you too can have a massive house and 10 sports cars and 20 girlfriends or whatever else.

97
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,480
Now this might seem silly, and it is,

98
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,600
but we're living in a world where even the sort of success enjoyed

99
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,480
by the previous couple of generations is a ridiculous pipe dream for a lot of young people.

100
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,360
You know, one regular house and one regular car

101
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,280
and one singular girlfriend seem out of reach for a lot of young men.

102
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,600
And if you're going to believe in a pipe dream, why not shoot for the moon, you know?

103
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,760
This is something a lot of adults don't get about Andrew Tate and people like him,

104
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,320
because, let's be honest, to most even moderately well-adjusted adults today,

105
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,960
Andrew Tate looks very silly indeed.

106
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:27,120
He's like a cartoon character of a pompous rich guy bragging about his money and expensive cars.

107
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,920
You know, it's ridiculous behavior that signals to his fellow adults insecurity and immaturity.

108
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,800
And as I mentioned earlier, even a lot of his fans aren't really taking him seriously all the time.

109
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,960
They understand he is being deliberately provocative and exaggerated.

110
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,400
But his target audience isn't those moderately well-adjusted adults who think he's silly.

111
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,800
It's not the people who can tell when he's joking or being deliberately provocative.

112
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,120
It's the few people who can't.

113
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,360
It's the people who take him seriously.

114
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,040
This is a point made very well by Hbomberguy when describing Alex Jones in a video I'll link below,

115
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,640
but it applies equally well here, so I will shamelessly steal it.

116
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,720
Andrew Tate being over-the-top and ridiculous doesn't hurt him in reaching his target audience.

117
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,640
It actually acts as a filter.

118
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,440
If you can tell he's unserious, well, you're not going to be sending him money anyway.

119
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,360
But if you take him seriously, if you believe what he's saying,

120
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,240
even when he's being as ridiculous as possible,

121
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,800
then you just might be gullible enough to sign up for Hustlers University.

122
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,760
Those people are the real target audience.

123
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,160
Any relatively mature adult knows not to fall for get-rich-quick schemes

124
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,880
that promise huge returns for no investment.

125
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,680
And the Hustlers University website literally promises

126
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,560
to teach you how to get returns for zero investment.

127
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,000
But so what?

128
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,120
We're not after them.

129
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,040
We're after the immature, the inexperienced, the people who don't know that this is rubbish.

130
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,360
This is part of the reason for Tate's popularity with young men in particular,

131
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,640
because one group of immature and inexperienced people is, obviously, teenagers.

132
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,480
Teenagers are insecure and immature and inexperienced,

133
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,800
and often don't have much that they can call their own.

134
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,240
And of course, they wouldn't.

135
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,200
That's not an insult.

136
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,360
That's just what it's like being a teenager.

137
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,960
And to be fair to teenage boys, understanding how they should act as men can be confusing.

138
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,760
You'll often hear from the right wing that masculinity is in crisis today.

139
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,120
But it isn't, really.

140
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,000
What is in crisis is patriarchy.

141
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,960
Patriarchy is being eroded over time.

142
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,880
Conservatives simply equate patriarchy with masculinity.

143
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
Those words mean the same thing to them.

144
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,080
But the social changes we've talked about today are moving society away from patriarchy.

145
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,840
But this transition is leading to some confusion in younger men,

146
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,880
because during the transition, they're hearing contradictory messages all the time.

147
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,480
Younger generations are raised by older generations, after all,

148
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,160
and their older attitudes to social issues can be passed down.

149
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,760
Media from previous generations still exists and reflects the attitudes of the time it was made,

150
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,480
and a lot of it still influences modern media.

151
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,520
So, very broadly, we have two messages that young men are hearing as they're growing up.

152
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,560
One is that everybody is fundamentally equal.

153
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,640
Women should be treated with respect.

154
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,200
They should show kindness and understanding and empathy to everyone, right?

155
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,400
The other message young men are hearing is that they need to be, quote,

156
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,600
real men, patriarchs, alpha males,

157
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,920
and women are their lessers who should be put in their place and made subservient.

158
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,480
There was some discourse on Twitter lately about what the left can do to appeal to young men,

159
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,960
with one tweet in particular claiming that men flock to the right because the left gives, quote,

160
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,800
brain dead advice to young men.

161
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,240
Now, I disagree with this opinion, firstly because I think it's overly simplistic.

162
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,160
Young men today are not neutrally considering different ideologies

163
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,120
and picking the one that gives the best advice or has the most attractive branding or whatever.

164
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,800
The truth is that these ideologies are offering completely different,

165
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,560
incomparable things.

166
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,800
What the right wing is offering is patriarchy and all its promises,

167
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,480
backed up by an entire human history's worth of traditions and stories and myths.

168
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,960
Follow us, act as we tell you to act, and you'll be a real man,

169
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,160
the top of the pyramid above everyone else,

170
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,920
and women, in particular, will have to do what you say.

171
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,920
Now, the left, in turn, offers equality, nobody being inherently better than anyone else,

172
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,200
but what that means in practice for a lot of young men is that women do not have to do what they say.

173
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,360
They can say no to you. They don't need your resources to survive.

174
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,600
To attract a mate, you can't rely on being simply necessary anymore.

175
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,920
Now you have to be desirable, and that can feel like a much more vulnerable,

176
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,680
emotional position to be in.

177
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,120
This is more than an issue of advice or branding or so on.

178
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,240
It is, in fact, one of the major political divides.

179
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,360
Actually, the single most important political question you could be asked, in my opinion,

180
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,400
do you think some groups of people are inherently superior to other groups of people?

181
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,000
Now, the right can offer easy affirmations to young white men here.

182
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,880
They can say, yes, you are better than other people.

183
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,800
You do deserve to be on top.

184
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,840
Follow us, and we'll make sure that's where you are.

185
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,840
Now, the left has a much harder job.

186
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,240
They don't have those easy affirmations.

187
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,120
What they're saying to young men is that you are not inherently superior to anyone else.

188
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,080
Everyone, including you, should be equal.

189
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,280
Now, on the surface, that is a much harder sell.

190
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,320
But admittedly, the left can make a mistake here,

191
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,120
and that mistake is accepting the right's claim that life will be better for young,

192
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,320
in particular, white men under patriarchy.

193
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,440
I've seen some on the left claim that these men are unreachable,

194
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,840
because of course they aren't going to want to give up their privilege and live worse lives

195
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,800
because of it.

196
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,000
Patriarchy is beneficial to these men, is the claim,

197
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,160
so they're never going to want to give it up.

198
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,920
But the truth here is that patriarchy is not good for men.

199
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,680
At the very least, it is not good for the vast majority of men.

200
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,280
Now, I'm far from the first person to make this observation, of course.

201
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,160
I'd advise reading The Will to Change by Bell Hooks

202
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,120
if you want to see someone making this point much better than I can.

203
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,120
But yes, the truth here,

204
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,240
one that should be utilized as much as possible by the left,

205
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,040
is that patriarchy punishes men far more often than it rewards them.

206
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,320
The things that patriarchy promises to men are lies,

207
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,120
and men have far more to gain in rejecting patriarchy than accepting it.

208
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,480
So let's explore that,

209
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,400
and we'll start off by talking about the concept of masculinity and traditional masculine values.

210
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,560
Now, different people will have different ideas

211
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,080
about what exactly counts as a traditional masculine value, of course,

212
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,520
but typically you'll hear words like strength, leadership,

213
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,480
confidence, independence, and things like that.

214
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,880
And the first point I'd like to make about all these traits

215
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,040
is that they are, by themselves, morally and ethically neutral.

216
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,600
Take a man who is strong, for instance.

217
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,520
He can use that strength to work hard and provide for his family,

218
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,640
or he can use that strength to abuse and dominate his family and make them fearful of him.

219
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,080
Leadership, obviously, isn't automatically a virtue.

220
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,600
We can all imagine an incompetent political leader, for instance.

221
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,880
Confidence can be misplaced and easily turn into arrogance, and so on.

222
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,680
These words don't really tell us anything about the worth of a person by themselves.

223
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,440
What matters is how those qualities are used and expressed.

224
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,800
The next point I'd like to make here is that these particular values

225
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,000
and the way they are both expressed and considered by others are relative over time.

226
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,360
As an example, the modern West derives many of its founding ideas about philosophy,

227
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,480
science, art, law, politics, and so on from classical Greek culture,

228
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,080
but many places in ancient Greece had very different ideas to us

229
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,440
about what counts as traditionally manly behaviour.

230
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,600
My favourite example here is the accounts of the sacred band of Thebes,

231
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,400
the elite fighting force of the Theban army,

232
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,400
which was made up of 150 pairs of male lovers.

233
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,120
And honestly, I can see an argument here.

234
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,520
What's more masculine than a bunch of tough warrior dudes loving each other

235
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,680
with no women in sight, right?

236
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,760
Even something as simple as pink being associated with baby girls

237
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,120
and blue with baby boys changes over time.

238
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,680
100 years ago in the United States, these colours were reversed, for instance.

239
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,040
But people can still place a disproportionate amount of importance

240
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,560
on these completely arbitrary gendered signifiers.

241
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,840
For instance, I remember my sister once causing a bit of a stare

242
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:48,000
among the older members of my family for daring to put her infant son in a pink car seat,

243
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,040
as if by merely touching something pink coloured, her son would be forever tainted by it.

244
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,320
You know, he'll clearly grow up to be feminine or gay or whatever

245
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,680
just because one time he sat in a pink chair.

246
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,640
And I'd like to talk for a bit about that sort of masculine insecurity,

247
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,800
particularly fears about men appearing feminine or homosexual.

248
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:14,160
And as a fictional example here, let me tell you about my favourite scene from The Sopranos.

249
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:20,240
So, The Sopranos is a crime drama TV show focused on mafia boss Tony Soprano.

250
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,320
It's an interesting show to consider in relation to the topic of masculinity,

251
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,960
as Tony often struggles with the expectations of the highly traditionalist

252
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,840
and patriarchal criminal world he inhabits.

253
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,600
So, minor spoilers for The Sopranos for this next part.

254
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,080
In the scene I want to talk about, Tony is talking to his therapist Dr. Melfi

255
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:46,160
about the fact that one of his mafia subordinates, Vito, has been outed as homosexual.

256
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,080
Tony is pretty stressed out.

257
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,800
Vito is one of his best guys, he says,

258
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:55,280
but his other criminal associates aren't going to want to work with a gay man.

259
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,440
Melfi asks Tony how he personally feels about homosexuality,

260
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,160
and he immediately says he thinks it's disgusting,

261
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,360
an opinion which would be expected and unquestioned in a room full of his male peers.

262
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:13,440
But as Tony continues to talk and tries to defend this position, he starts to contradict himself.

263
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,560
He complains that every TV show these days is rubbing his nose in homosexuality

264
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,560
by including gay characters,

265
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,800
but then he admits that he likes to show the L-word with Jennifer Beals.

266
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,440
He points out that he's a strict Catholic,

267
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,920
even though he's a murderer, an adulterer,

268
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,960
and various other things that make that defense very silly.

269
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,760
When Melfi points out that many of Tony's associates will have had sex with men in prison,

270
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,800
he says they, quote,

271
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,400
get a pass for that on account of there being no women in prison,

272
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,880
to which Melfi replies sarcastically,

273
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,240
well, that's nice.

274
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,960
Tony is quick to point out to Melfi that he didn't engage in homosexual behavior

275
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,800
when he was incarcerated.

276
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,840
He's worried that she will question his masculinity,

277
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,480
and when she obviously doesn't care either way, he accuses her of thinking he's lying.

278
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,600
Tony is worried about accusations of homosexuality,

279
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,280
and Melfi's refusal to judge him or consider him less of a man

280
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,160
is a challenge to his patriarchal worldview.

281
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:15,920
That she wouldn't think any less of him if he were gay actually annoys him, funnily enough.

282
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:21,760
My favorite part of this scene is when Tony runs out of steam trying to justify his homophobia.

283
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,120
He gives up trying.

284
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,080
Away from the judgment of his male peers,

285
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,400
talking to a woman who will not consider him less of a man for saying so,

286
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,120
Tony finally admits that he doesn't really care if Vito is gay.

287
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,360
It doesn't really bother him.

288
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,440
He can't actually defend his initial display of disgust.

289
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,840
However, when Dr. Melfi salutes Tony's new outlook, he responds,

290
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,560
it's a tall fucking order, I'll tell you that.

291
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,680
And he's right.

292
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:55,360
You know, it's all well and good for Tony to be accepting of gay people here in his therapist's office,

293
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:01,200
but back out there in his day-to-day life, Tony is expected to be and act homophobic.

294
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,640
If he doesn't act like he finds homosexuality disgusting,

295
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,840
other men will judge him and question his masculinity and his heterosexuality,

296
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,080
and maybe even get violent with him.

297
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,880
Even though Tony is not actually homophobic when he sits and thinks about it,

298
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,080
he's still expected to, in a sense, perform homophobia for his male peers

299
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,120
in order to signal his own masculinity to them.

300
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,000
Now, obviously, the response Tony might face as the head of an organized crime family

301
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,600
is probably a bit more dramatic than for the average person,

302
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,640
but even if it doesn't always start a mob war or whatever,

303
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,800
men can still face social repercussions for refusing to act in a way

304
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,880
that reinforces traditional notions of patriarchal masculinity.

305
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,640
Now, regardless of what he thinks, Tony Soprano is still homophobic in his actions,

306
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,240
I think it's important to say,

307
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,520
and he actually ends up ordering Vito be killed,

308
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,840
something he doesn't actually want to do,

309
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,840
but ends up feeling that he has to do because it's expected of him.

310
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,560
My point here is that Tony is the boss, the patriarch, the alpha male,

311
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,800
but instead of that bringing him freedom,

312
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,400
he finds instead that his behavior is tightly restrained,

313
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,960
controlled by a patriarchal social system and its expectations of him.

314
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,880
Patriarchy makes him miserable, it makes him insecure,

315
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,560
and it makes him do things that he doesn't actually want to do.

316
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,520
So I have two points to make about patriarchy here.

317
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,640
The first is that patriarchy, more often than not,

318
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,080
steals the qualities it expects men to exhibit.

319
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,880
It demands confidence and self-assurance,

320
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,160
but really it will make you insecure and afraid,

321
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,800
afraid of appearing weak or feminine,

322
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,480
and worried about not being considered enough of a real man.

323
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,640
Any confidence patriarchy can give you will be a false front propped up by insecurities.

324
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,360
The second point I want to make is that, funnily enough,

325
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,160
a challenging or breaking with patriarchy

326
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:03,600
often requires you to exhibit those very same qualities that patriarchy would expect of you.

327
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,360
It can take courage and confidence and strength to challenge norms or break with tradition,

328
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,880
and someone can go along with tradition not because they actually want to,

329
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,160
but out of cowardice and fear and weakness.

330
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,400
So what's actually more important here?

331
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,160
Adhering to a particular set of traditional masculine norms,

332
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,760
you know, a particular look or set of social behaviors,

333
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,800
or is it actually embodying qualities like courage and confidence and leadership,

334
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,880
even if doing so means breaking with those traditional norms?

335
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,480
As another example in fiction, let's look at Billy Elliot.

336
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,600
So Billy Elliot is a movie about a young boy who discovers he really likes ballet dancing,

337
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,840
a traditionally feminine activity,

338
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,840
and he insists upon practicing ballet even though it causes the men in his family

339
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,880
to get angry with him and question his masculinity.

340
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,920
But Billy keeps on doing it because it's what he wants to do, and he's good at it.

341
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,480
So we can ask, who is actually being more manly in this story?

342
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,440
And it really depends on what we mean by manly.

343
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,400
If we're only talking about the way people present themselves

344
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,920
and the sorts of traditionally gendered activities they engage in,

345
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,800
Billy isn't being very manly at all by ballet dancing.

346
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,400
On the other hand, Billy is the one with the courage and confidence

347
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,640
to stand up to his older male relatives, to do what he wants to do,

348
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,960
whereas they're being controlled by fear.

349
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,240
Fear of how people will react to Billy dancing,

350
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,240
how it will make him look, and how it will make them look in turn.

351
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,600
I guess I'm taking a long time to say, what's more important,

352
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,600
the way you present yourself, the way other men perceive you,

353
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,680
or the way you actually are?

354
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,000
There's a scene in Game of Thrones I like,

355
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,320
where King Joffrey is being a cruel little wanker, as usual,

356
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,080
causing his uncle Tyrion to insult him, again as usual,

357
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,720
to which Joffrey gets incredibly angry and shouts,

358
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,160
I am the king.

359
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,080
Joffrey then gets put in his place by Tywin, the real power in the room,

360
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,160
who rebukes Joffrey by saying,

361
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,760
any man who must say I am the king is no true king.

362
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,040
I get reminded of this scene whenever I see a quote

363
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,480
alpha male influencer yelling about their own manliness

364
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,720
and insisting other people recognise it.

365
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,680
Not that I believe in the whole alpha male thing, of course,

366
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:22,480
but they do, and if they really were alpha males as they understand it,

367
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,040
they wouldn't need to shout about it, would they?

368
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,400
They just would be.

369
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,680
If that's really how people worked, how they naturally related to each other,

370
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,840
then they wouldn't need to shout about it.

371
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:39,040
We've spent a lot of time talking about negative expressions of masculine stereotypes today,

372
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:43,600
so let's move on to have a think about the concept of positive masculinity.

373
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,960
So I asked on Twitter what people think of when they hear the phrase

374
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,440
positive masculinity, and I got a lot of responses.

375
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,160
Most people who responded did so with either a picture or a name of a good man.

376
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,360
Usually a historical figure or celebrity they admire

377
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,600
or a character from fiction who is a man with many positive traits.

378
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,760
I got a lot of characters from video games and comic books and animated shows

379
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,960
and a lot of Aragorn from Lord of the Rings.

380
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,800
Just so much Aragorn.

381
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,320
The people really love Aragorn, it turns out.

382
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,640
And when I first read through the replies to this tweet, I was confused.

383
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,360
I asked about positive masculinity,

384
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,240
and a lot of people just sent me pictures of good men.

385
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,680
You know, aren't they misunderstanding the homework assignment here?

386
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,800
There has to be more to the idea of positive masculinity

387
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,440
than just being a man who is good, right?

388
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,280
Or does there?

389
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,040
Let's have a think about it.

390
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:44,000
So when I think of positive masculinity, I think first of my dad.

391
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,560
My dad is a typical man's man.

392
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,360
He's traditionally masculine in a lot of ways.

393
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,640
He's big and strong.

394
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,880
He works a traditionally masculine job.

395
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,560
He's a truck driver.

396
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:58,240
He likes having a pint with the lads down the pub and watching the football,

397
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,360
all that sort of thing.

398
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,960
And I have no memories of my childhood where I saw my dad engaging

399
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,840
in any traditionally feminine hobbies or pastimes.

400
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,040
It was all sports and poker and action movies.

401
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,400
And my dad likes and values those aspects of himself,

402
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,320
and since I know he watches my videos,

403
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,560
I'm certain he'll be agreeing very happily with this description of himself.

404
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,800
Anyway, all we're doing so far is describing a traditionally masculine man.

405
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,920
The thing that actually makes my father an example of positive masculinity to me

406
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,680
is that he's never insisted other people have to agree with

407
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,880
or accept his notions of gendered behaviors.

408
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,360
I have no memories of him trying to force me to be a particular type of man,

409
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,240
nor my sister a particular type of woman.

410
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,080
If I ever wanted to play with traditionally feminine toys, for example,

411
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,160
or if my sister wanted to dress in more traditionally masculine clothes,

412
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,000
he was happy to support that.

413
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,280
He never insisted that certain toys were only for girls,

414
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,880
or only boys wear those particular clothes, or so on.

415
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,960
Now, this permissive outlook is maybe unusual for a man of his generation.

416
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,640
Although, even though he's my dad, I don't want to be too flattering here,

417
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,200
so I'll say he can still be a stubborn old git in a lot of typically masculine ways.

418
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,080
You know, he's reluctant to accept help when he needs it.

419
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,960
He doesn't like to express his emotions and all that.

420
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,280
But still, whatever the concepts of masculinity or femininity mean to him,

421
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,000
it's always seemed like it was a personal opinion,

422
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,840
one that he never tried to force other people to adhere to.

423
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,760
And this was a common theme in most of the examples of positive masculinity people sent me on Twitter.

424
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,040
Whether fictional or real, people sent me examples of men

425
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,360
who do not force a particular type of masculinity on others.

426
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,520
They themselves might be very traditionally masculine, or not at all,

427
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,000
but whatever they are themselves, they're confident and content enough in themselves

428
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,800
to exist alongside other ways of being.

429
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,560
This would be the core of a positive masculinity to me.

430
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,160
You can possess all those typically masculine descriptors,

431
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,560
but not use them to control others.

432
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,840
You know, you can have strength without using it to dominate.

433
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,440
You can offer protection without needing to claim ownership.

434
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,800
You can lead without demanding others follow you.

435
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:18,960
Positive masculinity is, to me, a masculinity that doesn't lay sole claim to its descriptors,

436
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,800
that recognises abstract concepts like strength and leadership

437
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,840
do not belong exclusively to masculinity,

438
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,840
especially not to just one particular type of masculinity.

439
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,080
So, this all sounds nice, doesn't it?

440
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,920
What if we had all of the good parts, but without any of the bad parts?

441
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,480
It is easier said than done, isn't it?

442
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,720
But you might be wondering here, what does masculinity mean, really,

443
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,760
if we don't insist that any of the adjectives we use to describe it are exclusive to it?

444
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,120
Or indeed, what does femininity mean for the same reason?

445
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:56,560
If a woman is strong, say, is that woman exhibiting a traditionally masculine trait,

446
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,360
or is it an example of feminine strength?

447
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,000
Or if a man is compassionate, say, is he exhibiting a traditionally feminine trait,

448
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,480
or is it an example of masculine compassion?

449
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,880
Maybe it can be both, or maybe it doesn't have to be either.

450
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,560
You might ask why we bother to gender these behaviours at all if anyone can exhibit the traits.

451
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,480
I personally like to think of the gender aspect as more of a flavouring

452
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,120
than a strictly necessary ingredient.

453
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,160
You know, if you're a man, and you're trying to be a good man,

454
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:31,600
you should first try to be a good person, and being a good man will follow on from that.

455
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,320
You know, if all you worry about is the man part, you're just gonna come across as insecure.

456
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:41,120
I feel like I should wrap up today by giving some actual advice to young men.

457
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,800
Why not, right? It can't hurt.

458
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:49,280
So, not to brag, but I am a generally happy and relatively successful 34-year-old man,

459
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:55,040
and here's all the best advice I can think of that I wish someone had told me when I was younger.

460
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:59,280
Firstly, if you value yourself by the acquisition of things,

461
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,360
you're never going to be satisfied, because there's always more things.

462
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,840
If you give someone who values themselves like this ten fancy sports cars,

463
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,080
you know what they're gonna want, right? Eleven fancy sports cars.

464
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:18,160
A lack of money can make you miserable, but an excess of money is not going to make you happy.

465
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:23,040
Next, you don't actually want a fancy sports car, trust me.

466
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:28,320
If someone hands you a mega-expensive supercar, you should sell it immediately

467
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,080
and buy something that can go over a speed bump without cracking in half.

468
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,560
Or, like, a bicycle.

469
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:40,240
They're not real cars, these things. They're expensive ornaments that you have to pay to maintain.

470
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,040
If you actually get one, most people are just gonna assume that you're compensating for something.

471
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:51,760
On self-improvement, if you're going to improve yourself, you are going to improve yourself.

472
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,040
Anyone on the internet who is selling some indispensable method

473
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:59,200
to make you successful and happy and rich is lying to you.

474
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:03,200
Also, if it were that easy to get rich quick, nobody would be poor.

475
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,040
Only one person is guaranteed to get rich in those sorts of schemes,

476
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,360
and it's the person running the scheme.

477
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,240
The person most likely to get rich in a gold rush is the guy selling the shovels.

478
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,600
There's usually two parts to these sorts of scams, right?

479
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,760
The part where you can get rich doing it, which never lasts very long

480
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,960
because then people find out about it and it stops working

481
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,440
because a ton of people try to do it at once.

482
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,640
After that, the only way to get rich with it is to sell the scam on to other people and say,

483
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,520
look, I got rich doing this, so can you, even though it doesn't work anymore.

484
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,640
If it still worked, they wouldn't be telling you about it.

485
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,360
And if you're hearing about it, especially from a source that looks like an advertisement,

486
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,560
it's too late. You're the one being scammed now.

487
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:52,560
Next, if you're going to improve yourself, you should do it for you.

488
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:57,680
Because you are a person too. You matter. You should respect and value yourself.

489
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,520
Don't try to make yourself into something you think other people will want.

490
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,320
Make yourself into something you want to be.

491
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:09,600
If you focus on that, you'll be happier, you'll be more confident, and everything else will follow.

492
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,520
So let's talk about women.

493
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,320
Now, if you're a young man attracted to women,

494
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,720
you're probably more than a little curious about what women want, right?

495
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,240
And if you want to know what women want, you know who you should listen to?

496
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,400
That's right, it's other single men on the internet.

497
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,200
No, it's not. It's women.

498
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,000
Because women are people, they are individuals,

499
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,920
they have inner lives and thoughts and feelings just the same as you.

500
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:40,720
They can tell you what they want, but it's on you to listen to what they say.

501
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,120
There are plenty of women out there who are desperately lonely for a man to treat them

502
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,480
but they're surrounded by dudes who only treat them like characters in a dating sim,

503
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:56,480
trying to speedrun their clothes off by using the right ratio of pickup lines to negs or whatever else.

504
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,040
In my experience, what women are most attracted to

505
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,600
is when someone shows an actual interest in getting to know them as people.

506
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,120
Next, not to be mean, but for young men in particular,

507
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,600
most women you meet around your age and older will be onto your shit.

508
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,920
If you're not genuine, they'll know.

509
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:19,360
If you're just pretending to be nice to get sex from them, you'll be spotted immediately, trust me.

510
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,400
And I know this is going to be a knock to the ego of a lot of young men,

511
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,720
it certainly was for me when I was younger,

512
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,320
but there are women out there who are just savvier than you are.

513
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,280
They are beyond your ability to manipulate and they've been reading you like a book.

514
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,480
And I know it's hard if you're hearing this for the first time.

515
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,560
I'm not joking, it was a real blow for me when I first realized I wasn't as smooth as I thought I was.

516
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,040
But don't worry, you can change your behavior and find something genuine.

517
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,240
Not only should you not try to manipulate women,

518
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,560
because it's wrong, of course, but you don't have to manipulate women.

519
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,960
They're just other people, not aliens,

520
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,800
and by and large, they want the same things that you want already.

521
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,680
Also, if you're lonely, focus on meeting people in general,

522
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,160
not just people you want to have sex with.

523
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,520
Sex won't make you any less lonely just by itself.

524
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,360
In fact, just by itself, it will probably make you more lonely.

525
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:19,120
Making connections with other people is the important thing there.

526
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,880
I know it's easy for me to say,

527
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,320
don't focus so much on the sex part, but it is true.

528
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,840
It's very easy to try too hard in that department.

529
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:32,480
Not many women are going to like it if they sense that you feel entitled to sex.

530
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,400
Next, women aren't a hive mind, but they do talk to each other,

531
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,400
and one of the things they're going to talk to each other about is you.

532
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,760
People are going to discuss you when you're not in the room.

533
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,920
If you're a creepy weirdo to one woman,

534
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,760
she's going to tell the other women she knows that you're a creepy weirdo.

535
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,320
On the other hand, if you're nice, if you're friendly,

536
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,320
or do some act of kindness without expecting anything in return,

537
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,040
that's what people will be saying about you instead.

538
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,040
So do kind things, not just because it's the right thing to do,

539
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,520
but for the sake of your own reputation.

540
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,520
And this idea, you'll hear people say that women don't like nice guys

541
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,080
and only respond to men who treat them mean.

542
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,560
That's a load of rubbish, trust me.

543
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,040
What you'll find is that one thing many people are attracted to is confidence.

544
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,600
And you can be a confident jerk, yes,

545
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,800
but you can be a kind person and confident too.

546
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,560
If you go from being a shy shut-in who never interacts with women

547
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,920
to a confident jerk who does interact with women,

548
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,920
yes, you'll meet more women.

549
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,240
Wow, but the jerk part is not necessary there, is it?

550
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,120
And I'll give one final bit of advice today.

551
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,640
Don't take life advice from people like Andrew Tate,

552
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,840
not just because he used to get kicked in the head for a living,

553
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,000
and not just because he's currently covered in lice and cockroaches in a jail cell,

554
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,240
and not just because he's an admitted rapist.

555
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,320
Well, actually, yes, don't listen to him for all those reasons,

556
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,600
but also don't listen to him because he's wrong.

557
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:05,680
At the start of the video, I talked about the anecdote of the young Andrew Tate

558
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,920
realizing that society is unfair,

559
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,160
that there are a tiny minority of rich people

560
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,040
hoarding a vast majority of the world's wealth.

561
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,120
Now, he looked at this unfair exploitative system and he said,

562
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:22,160
I'm going to climb up it by myself so I can buy a car.

563
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,760
This is a small, selfish, and cowardly way to look at the world.

564
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,480
When he realized society was unfair,

565
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,920
he didn't set out to change it to make it more fair.

566
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,640
He set out to take advantage of the unfairness,

567
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,440
to be a rich man exploiting poor men,

568
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,640
instead of a poor man being exploited by the rich.

569
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,080
And he got rich, partly, by swindling money out of men

570
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,120
who are in the same low position he was when he was broke.

571
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,400
Is this what real men are supposed to do?

572
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,480
Say, I'm gonna get mine, regardless of what I have to do to get there.

573
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,280
I don't care how silly I make myself look.

574
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,600
I don't care who I have to exploit.

575
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,640
I will have a Ferrari one day.

576
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,080
I can't imagine a more miserable outlook, I don't think.

577
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,840
And for any of his fans who've stuck around to the end of the video today,

578
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,960
can you honestly still tell me, with a straight face,

579
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,440
that choosing to live like he does has made Andrew Tate happy?

580
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,400
Anyway, thanks a lot for watching today, folks.

581
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,640
And as always, thank you especially to all my supporters over on Patreon,

00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,280
that I took down because I don't like them anymore.

586
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,840
How's that for a sales pitch?
