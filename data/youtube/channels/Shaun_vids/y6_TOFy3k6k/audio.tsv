0	5840	Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about controversial online influencer Andrew Tate,
5840	12000	who was recently arrested in Romania under suspicion of human trafficking and being part of an organized crime group.
12000	17920	Tate and his brother are currently being detained by Romanian authorities while they are investigated.
17920	22960	Andrew Tate is a former kickboxer who rose to internet fame by promoting a quote,
22960	30960	an ultra-masculine, ultra-luxurious lifestyle in various clips and interviews that have been shared widely on social media.
30960	37120	He gives a lot of self-help advice, and he's also made a lot of money with his website Hustlers University,
37120	41760	a subscription-based service that claims to help subscribers get rich quick.
41760	48800	Now, I call Andrew Tate controversial because while there are a lot of people who are outraged about a lot of the things he says,
48800	54720	there are also a lot of people, particularly younger men, who think there is a lot of value in his message.
54720	57040	And this might be surprising to hear.
57040	61760	For instance, Andrew Tate openly calls himself a misogynist and a sexist,
61760	65600	and argues men should have authority over the women in their lives,
65600	69920	statements which have caused him to be banned from several social media websites.
69920	73520	These statements, coupled with his recent human trafficking arrest,
73520	79360	might cause someone unfamiliar with Andrew Tate to wonder what exactly it is that his fans see in him.
79360	84640	I asked on Twitter for anyone who is either a fan of Andrew Tate or knows a fan of Andrew Tate
84640	89520	to message me with an explanation of what it is they like about him or his content.
89520	95120	And I got hundreds of responses in tweets and DMs and emails from people answering me.
95120	100000	So let me share my findings with you after reading all of those replies.
100000	106960	Firstly, a lot of the time on social media, Andrew Tate is being deliberately exaggerated and playing a bit of a character.
106960	111120	And the majority of the people watching his content seem to understand that.
111120	114080	They get that he's being deliberately over the top.
114080	118720	He says controversial things on purpose to chase social media engagement,
118720	125920	and most of the people who watch his content seem open to excusing some of the worst things he says using that justification.
125920	134160	And the idea that Andrew Tate is just playing a character is something his lawyer has already been putting out there to defend him in his recent legal troubles.
134160	140960	Because unfortunately for Andrew Tate's lawyer, Andrew Tate keeps admitting to crimes. On camera.
140960	147920	So his defense is the same one that other over-the-top controversial media figures use when they get into legal trouble.
147920	148560	They say,
150560	154960	Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson have both used this line of argument.
154960	163440	We're so ridiculous, we're so outlandish, we're so unreasonable that nobody watching could possibly believe anything we say.
163440	170400	And indeed, most of the people who watch Andrew Tate's content seem to understand this and don't believe everything he says.
170400	179680	But I know from reading all those responses on Twitter that there is also that minority of fans who do take everything he says seriously.
179680	182400	They totally believe in the character.
182480	187600	These are the people who are signing up to Hustlers University and sending Andrew Tate their money.
187600	196000	You know, this is the less savvy minority who you can trick into thinking the best way for them to make money is to send you all of their money.
196000	203840	But regardless of how much someone believes in Andrew Tate's messaging, what is it he's saying that young men are connecting with in the first place?
203840	213680	Well, if you watch a few popular clips of Andrew Tate, you'll see him tell an anecdote that I think is a good representation of why his message appeals to certain young men today.
213680	222720	He talks about being a younger man himself and for the first time realizing just how vast the gulf is between regular people and the ultra-rich.
222720	232880	So, as a young, poor man, Andrew Tate was thinking about buying a car and was absolutely amazed to see a Ferrari being sold for hundreds of thousands of pounds.
232880	242000	This stunned the young Andrew Tate. He was broke, but there were people out there who could afford to spend all that money just on a car.
242000	248320	He was struggling to get by at the bottom of the ladder, but there were people at the top of the ladder who got to do whatever they want,
248320	253280	spending huge sums of money on unnecessary indulgences like fancy cars.
253280	259760	He was blown away by the disparity in wealth and he resolved to not spend the rest of his life as a peasant.
259760	267600	He was going to make himself into a more successful man, climb that ladder by himself, and one day, he'd be rich.
267600	275520	And to a lot of broke men in the same position as the young Andrew Tate at the start of his story, you can see why this would be appealing, right?
275520	285920	He was in your position too, but now he's rich. So maybe if you listen to him and do the things he tells you he did, you'll also be able to afford a Ferrari one day.
285920	290560	Now, regardless of the conclusions drawn here, there is truth in the foundation.
290560	296800	You know, a real problem with the world has been identified. And this is what draws young men in initially.
296800	303360	If you agree with Andrew Tate's assessment of society being unfair, if you connect with some of his self-help advice,
303360	307200	then you might be willing to listen to some of his more controversial ideas.
307200	311360	And the most common controversy for Andrew Tate is misogyny.
311360	320160	As I mentioned, Andrew Tate openly describes himself as a misogynist and a sexist, and is repeatedly argued in favour of a patriarchal worldview.
320160	323120	So let's talk about the idea of patriarchy.
323120	330000	Now, I'm going to talk very broadly here, but typically patriarchy has been the norm throughout a lot of human history.
330000	336960	We've had kingdoms and empires and religions overwhelmingly headed by men, emphasizing the importance of the male line,
336960	344160	men being considered the head of the household, with women often not having the same rights as men under law, or even just being considered property.
344160	348960	Men have historically ranked above women in most power structures, is the point.
348960	356000	Now, I'm going to say something relatively cruel, kind of an uncomfortable truth that I need to be careful about expressing.
356000	363360	For dudes who just suck, like they're not particularly interesting or funny or kind or successful,
363360	370080	for men who just don't have much to offer a woman, well, they used to be able to offer an income.
370080	375920	They could at least be providers at a time when it was more difficult for a woman to provide for herself.
375920	380400	However, with the advancement of women's rights in a lot of places over the last century,
380400	385120	with women being able to go into higher education and work a wider range of jobs,
385120	388800	gaining the ability to divorce husbands they don't like and so on,
388800	393280	as well as it becoming increasingly acceptable to be unmarried later in life,
393280	399520	there's simply less financial and social pressure on women to settle for men who just aren't very good.
399520	402720	And there's something related to consider here, too.
402720	407840	What men are able to provide financially on one income isn't what it once was.
407840	412480	We still live in the aftermath of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression,
412480	417360	and the economy has not been doing too great for the average person, to put it lightly.
417360	421600	Average wages have been relatively stagnant for decades in a lot of places,
421600	426400	the ultra-rich control a larger and larger proportion of the world's resources.
426400	431840	Most of the people watching this video will live in societies which are increasingly unequal.
431840	437040	So for those men who only have resources to bring to the table when seeking a partner,
437040	443600	what they're providing is on average both less necessary and smaller in value than it once might have been.
443600	448560	This is all a recipe for creating a group of lonely, aggrieved, and desperate men
448560	452880	who feel unable to meet the expectations that society has for them.
452880	457840	And the reason I said I need to be careful in talking about this is because this set of circumstances
457840	463920	can prime this group of lonely, aggrieved, and desperate men to fall for two ideologies in particular
463920	466080	that I consider to be very harmful.
466080	468080	One is the incel path.
468080	472960	Men who believe they are supposedly of irredeemably low value in today's quote,
473920	476800	and so they blame things beyond their control.
476800	480560	They claim nothing can be done and they sink into despair.
480560	484080	The other ideology is the reactionary conservative route.
484080	487120	People who argue we should hit reverse on social progress
487120	491360	and take society back to a time where women were in their rightful place.
491360	496800	These are related sets of ideas because they both see women as something deserved by men.
496800	499280	Women aren't really people in these world views,
499280	503680	they're just another object a man can own to signal his status to other men,
503680	506400	like a big house or a fancy car.
506400	510240	This group of men are also very easy prey for grifters.
510240	514400	Andrew Tate's projection of wealth and superficial signifiers of success
514400	518160	can appeal to lonely and economically anxious men.
518160	521920	If you listen to me and sign up for Pyramid Scheme University,
521920	527520	you too can have a massive house and 10 sports cars and 20 girlfriends or whatever else.
527520	530480	Now this might seem silly, and it is,
530480	533600	but we're living in a world where even the sort of success enjoyed
533600	538480	by the previous couple of generations is a ridiculous pipe dream for a lot of young people.
538480	541360	You know, one regular house and one regular car
541360	545280	and one singular girlfriend seem out of reach for a lot of young men.
545280	549600	And if you're going to believe in a pipe dream, why not shoot for the moon, you know?
549600	553760	This is something a lot of adults don't get about Andrew Tate and people like him,
553760	558320	because, let's be honest, to most even moderately well-adjusted adults today,
558320	560960	Andrew Tate looks very silly indeed.
560960	567120	He's like a cartoon character of a pompous rich guy bragging about his money and expensive cars.
567120	573920	You know, it's ridiculous behavior that signals to his fellow adults insecurity and immaturity.
573920	578800	And as I mentioned earlier, even a lot of his fans aren't really taking him seriously all the time.
578800	582960	They understand he is being deliberately provocative and exaggerated.
582960	588400	But his target audience isn't those moderately well-adjusted adults who think he's silly.
588400	592800	It's not the people who can tell when he's joking or being deliberately provocative.
592800	595120	It's the few people who can't.
595120	597360	It's the people who take him seriously.
597360	603040	This is a point made very well by Hbomberguy when describing Alex Jones in a video I'll link below,
603040	606640	but it applies equally well here, so I will shamelessly steal it.
607200	612720	Andrew Tate being over-the-top and ridiculous doesn't hurt him in reaching his target audience.
612720	614640	It actually acts as a filter.
614640	619440	If you can tell he's unserious, well, you're not going to be sending him money anyway.
619440	623360	But if you take him seriously, if you believe what he's saying,
623360	626240	even when he's being as ridiculous as possible,
626240	630800	then you just might be gullible enough to sign up for Hustlers University.
630800	633760	Those people are the real target audience.
633760	638160	Any relatively mature adult knows not to fall for get-rich-quick schemes
638160	640880	that promise huge returns for no investment.
640880	643680	And the Hustlers University website literally promises
643680	646560	to teach you how to get returns for zero investment.
646560	648000	But so what?
648000	649120	We're not after them.
649120	655040	We're after the immature, the inexperienced, the people who don't know that this is rubbish.
655040	659360	This is part of the reason for Tate's popularity with young men in particular,
659360	664640	because one group of immature and inexperienced people is, obviously, teenagers.
664640	668480	Teenagers are insecure and immature and inexperienced,
668480	670800	and often don't have much that they can call their own.
670800	672240	And of course, they wouldn't.
672240	673200	That's not an insult.
673200	675360	That's just what it's like being a teenager.
675360	680960	And to be fair to teenage boys, understanding how they should act as men can be confusing.
680960	685760	You'll often hear from the right wing that masculinity is in crisis today.
685760	687120	But it isn't, really.
687120	690000	What is in crisis is patriarchy.
690000	692960	Patriarchy is being eroded over time.
692960	696880	Conservatives simply equate patriarchy with masculinity.
696880	698880	Those words mean the same thing to them.
698880	704080	But the social changes we've talked about today are moving society away from patriarchy.
704080	707840	But this transition is leading to some confusion in younger men,
707840	712880	because during the transition, they're hearing contradictory messages all the time.
712880	716480	Younger generations are raised by older generations, after all,
716480	720160	and their older attitudes to social issues can be passed down.
720160	725760	Media from previous generations still exists and reflects the attitudes of the time it was made,
725760	728480	and a lot of it still influences modern media.
728480	733520	So, very broadly, we have two messages that young men are hearing as they're growing up.
733520	736560	One is that everybody is fundamentally equal.
736560	738640	Women should be treated with respect.
738640	743200	They should show kindness and understanding and empathy to everyone, right?
743200	746400	The other message young men are hearing is that they need to be, quote,
746400	749600	real men, patriarchs, alpha males,
749600	753920	and women are their lessers who should be put in their place and made subservient.
753920	758480	There was some discourse on Twitter lately about what the left can do to appeal to young men,
758480	762960	with one tweet in particular claiming that men flock to the right because the left gives, quote,
762960	764800	brain dead advice to young men.
765360	770240	Now, I disagree with this opinion, firstly because I think it's overly simplistic.
770240	774160	Young men today are not neutrally considering different ideologies
774160	779120	and picking the one that gives the best advice or has the most attractive branding or whatever.
779120	782800	The truth is that these ideologies are offering completely different,
782800	784560	incomparable things.
784560	788800	What the right wing is offering is patriarchy and all its promises,
788800	794480	backed up by an entire human history's worth of traditions and stories and myths.
794480	798960	Follow us, act as we tell you to act, and you'll be a real man,
798960	802160	the top of the pyramid above everyone else,
802160	805920	and women, in particular, will have to do what you say.
805920	811920	Now, the left, in turn, offers equality, nobody being inherently better than anyone else,
811920	817200	but what that means in practice for a lot of young men is that women do not have to do what they say.
817200	821360	They can say no to you. They don't need your resources to survive.
821360	825600	To attract a mate, you can't rely on being simply necessary anymore.
825600	829920	Now you have to be desirable, and that can feel like a much more vulnerable,
829920	831680	emotional position to be in.
831680	835120	This is more than an issue of advice or branding or so on.
835120	838240	It is, in fact, one of the major political divides.
838320	843360	Actually, the single most important political question you could be asked, in my opinion,
843360	848400	do you think some groups of people are inherently superior to other groups of people?
848400	852000	Now, the right can offer easy affirmations to young white men here.
852000	854880	They can say, yes, you are better than other people.
854880	856800	You do deserve to be on top.
856800	859840	Follow us, and we'll make sure that's where you are.
859840	861840	Now, the left has a much harder job.
861840	864240	They don't have those easy affirmations.
864240	869120	What they're saying to young men is that you are not inherently superior to anyone else.
869120	872080	Everyone, including you, should be equal.
872080	875280	Now, on the surface, that is a much harder sell.
875280	878320	But admittedly, the left can make a mistake here,
878320	883120	and that mistake is accepting the right's claim that life will be better for young,
883120	886320	in particular, white men under patriarchy.
886320	889440	I've seen some on the left claim that these men are unreachable,
889440	893840	because of course they aren't going to want to give up their privilege and live worse lives
893840	894800	because of it.
894800	898000	Patriarchy is beneficial to these men, is the claim,
898000	900160	so they're never going to want to give it up.
900160	903920	But the truth here is that patriarchy is not good for men.
903920	907680	At the very least, it is not good for the vast majority of men.
907680	911280	Now, I'm far from the first person to make this observation, of course.
911280	914160	I'd advise reading The Will to Change by Bell Hooks
914160	917120	if you want to see someone making this point much better than I can.
917120	919120	But yes, the truth here,
919120	922240	one that should be utilized as much as possible by the left,
922240	927040	is that patriarchy punishes men far more often than it rewards them.
927040	930320	The things that patriarchy promises to men are lies,
930320	935120	and men have far more to gain in rejecting patriarchy than accepting it.
935120	936480	So let's explore that,
936480	942400	and we'll start off by talking about the concept of masculinity and traditional masculine values.
942400	944560	Now, different people will have different ideas
944560	948080	about what exactly counts as a traditional masculine value, of course,
948160	951520	but typically you'll hear words like strength, leadership,
951520	954480	confidence, independence, and things like that.
954480	956880	And the first point I'd like to make about all these traits
956880	961040	is that they are, by themselves, morally and ethically neutral.
961040	963600	Take a man who is strong, for instance.
963600	967520	He can use that strength to work hard and provide for his family,
967520	972640	or he can use that strength to abuse and dominate his family and make them fearful of him.
972640	976080	Leadership, obviously, isn't automatically a virtue.
976080	979600	We can all imagine an incompetent political leader, for instance.
980240	984880	Confidence can be misplaced and easily turn into arrogance, and so on.
984880	989680	These words don't really tell us anything about the worth of a person by themselves.
989680	993440	What matters is how those qualities are used and expressed.
993440	996800	The next point I'd like to make here is that these particular values
996800	1002000	and the way they are both expressed and considered by others are relative over time.
1002000	1007360	As an example, the modern West derives many of its founding ideas about philosophy,
1007360	1012480	science, art, law, politics, and so on from classical Greek culture,
1012480	1016080	but many places in ancient Greece had very different ideas to us
1016080	1019440	about what counts as traditionally manly behaviour.
1019440	1023600	My favourite example here is the accounts of the sacred band of Thebes,
1023600	1026400	the elite fighting force of the Theban army,
1026400	1030400	which was made up of 150 pairs of male lovers.
1030480	1033120	And honestly, I can see an argument here.
1033120	1037520	What's more masculine than a bunch of tough warrior dudes loving each other
1037520	1039680	with no women in sight, right?
1039680	1043760	Even something as simple as pink being associated with baby girls
1043760	1047120	and blue with baby boys changes over time.
1047120	1051680	100 years ago in the United States, these colours were reversed, for instance.
1051680	1055040	But people can still place a disproportionate amount of importance
1055040	1058560	on these completely arbitrary gendered signifiers.
1058560	1061840	For instance, I remember my sister once causing a bit of a stare
1061840	1068000	among the older members of my family for daring to put her infant son in a pink car seat,
1068000	1073040	as if by merely touching something pink coloured, her son would be forever tainted by it.
1073040	1076320	You know, he'll clearly grow up to be feminine or gay or whatever
1076320	1079680	just because one time he sat in a pink chair.
1079680	1084640	And I'd like to talk for a bit about that sort of masculine insecurity,
1084800	1088800	particularly fears about men appearing feminine or homosexual.
1088800	1094160	And as a fictional example here, let me tell you about my favourite scene from The Sopranos.
1094160	1100240	So, The Sopranos is a crime drama TV show focused on mafia boss Tony Soprano.
1100240	1104320	It's an interesting show to consider in relation to the topic of masculinity,
1104320	1108960	as Tony often struggles with the expectations of the highly traditionalist
1108960	1111840	and patriarchal criminal world he inhabits.
1111840	1115600	So, minor spoilers for The Sopranos for this next part.
1115600	1120080	In the scene I want to talk about, Tony is talking to his therapist Dr. Melfi
1120080	1126160	about the fact that one of his mafia subordinates, Vito, has been outed as homosexual.
1126160	1128080	Tony is pretty stressed out.
1128080	1130800	Vito is one of his best guys, he says,
1130800	1135280	but his other criminal associates aren't going to want to work with a gay man.
1135280	1139440	Melfi asks Tony how he personally feels about homosexuality,
1139440	1142160	and he immediately says he thinks it's disgusting,
1142160	1147360	an opinion which would be expected and unquestioned in a room full of his male peers.
1147360	1153440	But as Tony continues to talk and tries to defend this position, he starts to contradict himself.
1153440	1158560	He complains that every TV show these days is rubbing his nose in homosexuality
1158560	1160560	by including gay characters,
1160560	1164800	but then he admits that he likes to show the L-word with Jennifer Beals.
1164800	1167440	He points out that he's a strict Catholic,
1167440	1169920	even though he's a murderer, an adulterer,
1169920	1172960	and various other things that make that defense very silly.
1172960	1177760	When Melfi points out that many of Tony's associates will have had sex with men in prison,
1177760	1178800	he says they, quote,
1178800	1182400	get a pass for that on account of there being no women in prison,
1182400	1184880	to which Melfi replies sarcastically,
1184880	1186240	well, that's nice.
1186240	1190960	Tony is quick to point out to Melfi that he didn't engage in homosexual behavior
1190960	1192800	when he was incarcerated.
1192800	1195840	He's worried that she will question his masculinity,
1195840	1200480	and when she obviously doesn't care either way, he accuses her of thinking he's lying.
1200480	1203600	Tony is worried about accusations of homosexuality,
1203600	1207280	and Melfi's refusal to judge him or consider him less of a man
1207280	1210160	is a challenge to his patriarchal worldview.
1210160	1215920	That she wouldn't think any less of him if he were gay actually annoys him, funnily enough.
1215920	1221760	My favorite part of this scene is when Tony runs out of steam trying to justify his homophobia.
1221760	1223120	He gives up trying.
1223680	1226080	Away from the judgment of his male peers,
1226080	1230400	talking to a woman who will not consider him less of a man for saying so,
1230400	1235120	Tony finally admits that he doesn't really care if Vito is gay.
1235120	1237360	It doesn't really bother him.
1237360	1241440	He can't actually defend his initial display of disgust.
1241440	1245840	However, when Dr. Melfi salutes Tony's new outlook, he responds,
1245840	1248560	it's a tall fucking order, I'll tell you that.
1248560	1249680	And he's right.
1249680	1255360	You know, it's all well and good for Tony to be accepting of gay people here in his therapist's office,
1255360	1261200	but back out there in his day-to-day life, Tony is expected to be and act homophobic.
1261200	1264640	If he doesn't act like he finds homosexuality disgusting,
1264640	1269840	other men will judge him and question his masculinity and his heterosexuality,
1269840	1272080	and maybe even get violent with him.
1272080	1276880	Even though Tony is not actually homophobic when he sits and thinks about it,
1276880	1282080	he's still expected to, in a sense, perform homophobia for his male peers
1282080	1285120	in order to signal his own masculinity to them.
1285120	1290000	Now, obviously, the response Tony might face as the head of an organized crime family
1290000	1293600	is probably a bit more dramatic than for the average person,
1293600	1296640	but even if it doesn't always start a mob war or whatever,
1296640	1300800	men can still face social repercussions for refusing to act in a way
1300800	1304880	that reinforces traditional notions of patriarchal masculinity.
1304880	1310640	Now, regardless of what he thinks, Tony Soprano is still homophobic in his actions,
1310640	1312240	I think it's important to say,
1312240	1315520	and he actually ends up ordering Vito be killed,
1315520	1317840	something he doesn't actually want to do,
1317840	1321840	but ends up feeling that he has to do because it's expected of him.
1321840	1326560	My point here is that Tony is the boss, the patriarch, the alpha male,
1326560	1328800	but instead of that bringing him freedom,
1328800	1332400	he finds instead that his behavior is tightly restrained,
1332400	1336960	controlled by a patriarchal social system and its expectations of him.
1336960	1340880	Patriarchy makes him miserable, it makes him insecure,
1340880	1344560	and it makes him do things that he doesn't actually want to do.
1344560	1347520	So I have two points to make about patriarchy here.
1347520	1350640	The first is that patriarchy, more often than not,
1350640	1354080	steals the qualities it expects men to exhibit.
1354080	1356880	It demands confidence and self-assurance,
1356880	1360160	but really it will make you insecure and afraid,
1360160	1362800	afraid of appearing weak or feminine,
1362800	1366480	and worried about not being considered enough of a real man.
1366480	1372640	Any confidence patriarchy can give you will be a false front propped up by insecurities.
1372640	1375360	The second point I want to make is that, funnily enough,
1375360	1378160	a challenging or breaking with patriarchy
1378160	1383600	often requires you to exhibit those very same qualities that patriarchy would expect of you.
1383600	1389360	It can take courage and confidence and strength to challenge norms or break with tradition,
1389360	1392880	and someone can go along with tradition not because they actually want to,
1392880	1396160	but out of cowardice and fear and weakness.
1396160	1398400	So what's actually more important here?
1398400	1402160	Adhering to a particular set of traditional masculine norms,
1402160	1405760	you know, a particular look or set of social behaviors,
1405760	1410800	or is it actually embodying qualities like courage and confidence and leadership,
1410800	1414880	even if doing so means breaking with those traditional norms?
1414880	1418480	As another example in fiction, let's look at Billy Elliot.
1418480	1423600	So Billy Elliot is a movie about a young boy who discovers he really likes ballet dancing,
1423600	1425840	a traditionally feminine activity,
1425840	1429840	and he insists upon practicing ballet even though it causes the men in his family
1429840	1432880	to get angry with him and question his masculinity.
1432880	1437920	But Billy keeps on doing it because it's what he wants to do, and he's good at it.
1437920	1442480	So we can ask, who is actually being more manly in this story?
1442480	1445440	And it really depends on what we mean by manly.
1445440	1448400	If we're only talking about the way people present themselves
1448400	1451920	and the sorts of traditionally gendered activities they engage in,
1451920	1454800	Billy isn't being very manly at all by ballet dancing.
1454800	1458400	On the other hand, Billy is the one with the courage and confidence
1458400	1462640	to stand up to his older male relatives, to do what he wants to do,
1462640	1464960	whereas they're being controlled by fear.
1464960	1468240	Fear of how people will react to Billy dancing,
1468240	1472240	how it will make him look, and how it will make them look in turn.
1472240	1475600	I guess I'm taking a long time to say, what's more important,
1475600	1479600	the way you present yourself, the way other men perceive you,
1479600	1481680	or the way you actually are?
1481680	1484000	There's a scene in Game of Thrones I like,
1484000	1488320	where King Joffrey is being a cruel little wanker, as usual,
1488320	1492080	causing his uncle Tyrion to insult him, again as usual,
1492080	1494720	to which Joffrey gets incredibly angry and shouts,
1494720	1496160	I am the king.
1496160	1500080	Joffrey then gets put in his place by Tywin, the real power in the room,
1500080	1502160	who rebukes Joffrey by saying,
1502160	1505760	any man who must say I am the king is no true king.
1506320	1509040	I get reminded of this scene whenever I see a quote
1509040	1512480	alpha male influencer yelling about their own manliness
1512480	1514720	and insisting other people recognise it.
1514720	1517680	Not that I believe in the whole alpha male thing, of course,
1517680	1522480	but they do, and if they really were alpha males as they understand it,
1522480	1525040	they wouldn't need to shout about it, would they?
1525040	1526400	They just would be.
1526960	1531680	If that's really how people worked, how they naturally related to each other,
1531680	1533840	then they wouldn't need to shout about it.
1533840	1539040	We've spent a lot of time talking about negative expressions of masculine stereotypes today,
1539040	1543600	so let's move on to have a think about the concept of positive masculinity.
1543600	1546960	So I asked on Twitter what people think of when they hear the phrase
1546960	1551440	positive masculinity, and I got a lot of responses.
1551440	1556160	Most people who responded did so with either a picture or a name of a good man.
1556160	1559360	Usually a historical figure or celebrity they admire
1559360	1563600	or a character from fiction who is a man with many positive traits.
1563600	1567760	I got a lot of characters from video games and comic books and animated shows
1567760	1570960	and a lot of Aragorn from Lord of the Rings.
1570960	1572800	Just so much Aragorn.
1572800	1576320	The people really love Aragorn, it turns out.
1576320	1580640	And when I first read through the replies to this tweet, I was confused.
1580640	1583360	I asked about positive masculinity,
1583360	1586240	and a lot of people just sent me pictures of good men.
1586240	1589680	You know, aren't they misunderstanding the homework assignment here?
1589680	1592800	There has to be more to the idea of positive masculinity
1592800	1595440	than just being a man who is good, right?
1596240	1597280	Or does there?
1597280	1599040	Let's have a think about it.
1599040	1604000	So when I think of positive masculinity, I think first of my dad.
1604000	1606560	My dad is a typical man's man.
1606560	1609360	He's traditionally masculine in a lot of ways.
1609360	1610640	He's big and strong.
1610640	1612880	He works a traditionally masculine job.
1612880	1614560	He's a truck driver.
1614560	1618240	He likes having a pint with the lads down the pub and watching the football,
1618240	1619360	all that sort of thing.
1619360	1622960	And I have no memories of my childhood where I saw my dad engaging
1622960	1625840	in any traditionally feminine hobbies or pastimes.
1625840	1629040	It was all sports and poker and action movies.
1629040	1632400	And my dad likes and values those aspects of himself,
1632400	1634320	and since I know he watches my videos,
1634320	1638560	I'm certain he'll be agreeing very happily with this description of himself.
1638560	1642800	Anyway, all we're doing so far is describing a traditionally masculine man.
1643440	1647920	The thing that actually makes my father an example of positive masculinity to me
1647920	1651680	is that he's never insisted other people have to agree with
1651680	1654880	or accept his notions of gendered behaviors.
1654880	1659360	I have no memories of him trying to force me to be a particular type of man,
1659360	1662240	nor my sister a particular type of woman.
1662240	1666080	If I ever wanted to play with traditionally feminine toys, for example,
1666080	1670160	or if my sister wanted to dress in more traditionally masculine clothes,
1670160	1672000	he was happy to support that.
1672000	1675280	He never insisted that certain toys were only for girls,
1675280	1678880	or only boys wear those particular clothes, or so on.
1678880	1682960	Now, this permissive outlook is maybe unusual for a man of his generation.
1683520	1686640	Although, even though he's my dad, I don't want to be too flattering here,
1686640	1691200	so I'll say he can still be a stubborn old git in a lot of typically masculine ways.
1691200	1694080	You know, he's reluctant to accept help when he needs it.
1694080	1696960	He doesn't like to express his emotions and all that.
1696960	1701280	But still, whatever the concepts of masculinity or femininity mean to him,
1701280	1704000	it's always seemed like it was a personal opinion,
1704000	1707840	one that he never tried to force other people to adhere to.
1707840	1713760	And this was a common theme in most of the examples of positive masculinity people sent me on Twitter.
1713760	1717040	Whether fictional or real, people sent me examples of men
1717040	1721360	who do not force a particular type of masculinity on others.
1721360	1725520	They themselves might be very traditionally masculine, or not at all,
1725520	1730000	but whatever they are themselves, they're confident and content enough in themselves
1730000	1732800	to exist alongside other ways of being.
1732800	1736560	This would be the core of a positive masculinity to me.
1736560	1740160	You can possess all those typically masculine descriptors,
1740160	1742560	but not use them to control others.
1742560	1745840	You know, you can have strength without using it to dominate.
1745840	1749440	You can offer protection without needing to claim ownership.
1749440	1752800	You can lead without demanding others follow you.
1752800	1758960	Positive masculinity is, to me, a masculinity that doesn't lay sole claim to its descriptors,
1758960	1762800	that recognises abstract concepts like strength and leadership
1762800	1765840	do not belong exclusively to masculinity,
1765840	1769840	especially not to just one particular type of masculinity.
1769840	1772080	So, this all sounds nice, doesn't it?
1772080	1775920	What if we had all of the good parts, but without any of the bad parts?
1775920	1778480	It is easier said than done, isn't it?
1778480	1782720	But you might be wondering here, what does masculinity mean, really,
1782720	1787760	if we don't insist that any of the adjectives we use to describe it are exclusive to it?
1787760	1791120	Or indeed, what does femininity mean for the same reason?
1791120	1796560	If a woman is strong, say, is that woman exhibiting a traditionally masculine trait,
1796560	1799360	or is it an example of feminine strength?
1799360	1804000	Or if a man is compassionate, say, is he exhibiting a traditionally feminine trait,
1804000	1806480	or is it an example of masculine compassion?
1807120	1810880	Maybe it can be both, or maybe it doesn't have to be either.
1810880	1816560	You might ask why we bother to gender these behaviours at all if anyone can exhibit the traits.
1816560	1820480	I personally like to think of the gender aspect as more of a flavouring
1820480	1823120	than a strictly necessary ingredient.
1823120	1826160	You know, if you're a man, and you're trying to be a good man,
1826160	1831600	you should first try to be a good person, and being a good man will follow on from that.
1831600	1836320	You know, if all you worry about is the man part, you're just gonna come across as insecure.
1836400	1841120	I feel like I should wrap up today by giving some actual advice to young men.
1841120	1842800	Why not, right? It can't hurt.
1842800	1849280	So, not to brag, but I am a generally happy and relatively successful 34-year-old man,
1849280	1855040	and here's all the best advice I can think of that I wish someone had told me when I was younger.
1855040	1859280	Firstly, if you value yourself by the acquisition of things,
1859280	1863360	you're never going to be satisfied, because there's always more things.
1863360	1867840	If you give someone who values themselves like this ten fancy sports cars,
1867840	1872080	you know what they're gonna want, right? Eleven fancy sports cars.
1872080	1878160	A lack of money can make you miserable, but an excess of money is not going to make you happy.
1878160	1883040	Next, you don't actually want a fancy sports car, trust me.
1883040	1888320	If someone hands you a mega-expensive supercar, you should sell it immediately
1888320	1892080	and buy something that can go over a speed bump without cracking in half.
1892640	1894560	Or, like, a bicycle.
1894560	1900240	They're not real cars, these things. They're expensive ornaments that you have to pay to maintain.
1900240	1905040	If you actually get one, most people are just gonna assume that you're compensating for something.
1905040	1911760	On self-improvement, if you're going to improve yourself, you are going to improve yourself.
1911760	1915040	Anyone on the internet who is selling some indispensable method
1915040	1919200	to make you successful and happy and rich is lying to you.
1919280	1923200	Also, if it were that easy to get rich quick, nobody would be poor.
1923200	1927040	Only one person is guaranteed to get rich in those sorts of schemes,
1927040	1929360	and it's the person running the scheme.
1929360	1934240	The person most likely to get rich in a gold rush is the guy selling the shovels.
1934240	1937600	There's usually two parts to these sorts of scams, right?
1937600	1941760	The part where you can get rich doing it, which never lasts very long
1941760	1944960	because then people find out about it and it stops working
1944960	1947440	because a ton of people try to do it at once.
1947440	1952640	After that, the only way to get rich with it is to sell the scam on to other people and say,
1952640	1957520	look, I got rich doing this, so can you, even though it doesn't work anymore.
1957520	1960640	If it still worked, they wouldn't be telling you about it.
1960640	1965360	And if you're hearing about it, especially from a source that looks like an advertisement,
1965360	1968560	it's too late. You're the one being scammed now.
1968560	1972560	Next, if you're going to improve yourself, you should do it for you.
1972560	1977680	Because you are a person too. You matter. You should respect and value yourself.
1977680	1981520	Don't try to make yourself into something you think other people will want.
1981520	1984320	Make yourself into something you want to be.
1984320	1989600	If you focus on that, you'll be happier, you'll be more confident, and everything else will follow.
1989600	1991520	So let's talk about women.
1991520	1994320	Now, if you're a young man attracted to women,
1994320	1998720	you're probably more than a little curious about what women want, right?
1998720	2002240	And if you want to know what women want, you know who you should listen to?
2002800	2006400	That's right, it's other single men on the internet.
2006400	2009200	No, it's not. It's women.
2009200	2012000	Because women are people, they are individuals,
2012000	2015920	they have inner lives and thoughts and feelings just the same as you.
2015920	2020720	They can tell you what they want, but it's on you to listen to what they say.
2020720	2025120	There are plenty of women out there who are desperately lonely for a man to treat them
2026080	2030480	but they're surrounded by dudes who only treat them like characters in a dating sim,
2030480	2036480	trying to speedrun their clothes off by using the right ratio of pickup lines to negs or whatever else.
2036480	2039040	In my experience, what women are most attracted to
2039040	2043600	is when someone shows an actual interest in getting to know them as people.
2043600	2047120	Next, not to be mean, but for young men in particular,
2047120	2051600	most women you meet around your age and older will be onto your shit.
2051600	2053920	If you're not genuine, they'll know.
2053920	2059360	If you're just pretending to be nice to get sex from them, you'll be spotted immediately, trust me.
2059360	2062400	And I know this is going to be a knock to the ego of a lot of young men,
2062400	2064720	it certainly was for me when I was younger,
2064720	2068320	but there are women out there who are just savvier than you are.
2068320	2073280	They are beyond your ability to manipulate and they've been reading you like a book.
2073280	2076480	And I know it's hard if you're hearing this for the first time.
2076480	2082560	I'm not joking, it was a real blow for me when I first realized I wasn't as smooth as I thought I was.
2082560	2087040	But don't worry, you can change your behavior and find something genuine.
2087040	2090240	Not only should you not try to manipulate women,
2090800	2094560	because it's wrong, of course, but you don't have to manipulate women.
2094560	2096960	They're just other people, not aliens,
2096960	2100800	and by and large, they want the same things that you want already.
2100800	2105680	Also, if you're lonely, focus on meeting people in general,
2105680	2108160	not just people you want to have sex with.
2108160	2111520	Sex won't make you any less lonely just by itself.
2111520	2115360	In fact, just by itself, it will probably make you more lonely.
2115360	2119120	Making connections with other people is the important thing there.
2119120	2120880	I know it's easy for me to say,
2120880	2124320	don't focus so much on the sex part, but it is true.
2124320	2127840	It's very easy to try too hard in that department.
2127840	2132480	Not many women are going to like it if they sense that you feel entitled to sex.
2132480	2136400	Next, women aren't a hive mind, but they do talk to each other,
2136400	2140400	and one of the things they're going to talk to each other about is you.
2140400	2143760	People are going to discuss you when you're not in the room.
2143760	2145920	If you're a creepy weirdo to one woman,
2145920	2149760	she's going to tell the other women she knows that you're a creepy weirdo.
2149760	2152320	On the other hand, if you're nice, if you're friendly,
2152320	2156320	or do some act of kindness without expecting anything in return,
2156320	2159040	that's what people will be saying about you instead.
2159040	2163040	So do kind things, not just because it's the right thing to do,
2163040	2165520	but for the sake of your own reputation.
2165520	2169520	And this idea, you'll hear people say that women don't like nice guys
2169520	2172080	and only respond to men who treat them mean.
2172080	2174560	That's a load of rubbish, trust me.
2174560	2179040	What you'll find is that one thing many people are attracted to is confidence.
2179040	2181600	And you can be a confident jerk, yes,
2181600	2184800	but you can be a kind person and confident too.
2184800	2188560	If you go from being a shy shut-in who never interacts with women
2188560	2191920	to a confident jerk who does interact with women,
2191920	2193920	yes, you'll meet more women.
2193920	2198240	Wow, but the jerk part is not necessary there, is it?
2198240	2201120	And I'll give one final bit of advice today.
2201120	2204640	Don't take life advice from people like Andrew Tate,
2204640	2207840	not just because he used to get kicked in the head for a living,
2207840	2212000	and not just because he's currently covered in lice and cockroaches in a jail cell,
2212000	2214240	and not just because he's an admitted rapist.
2215200	2218320	Well, actually, yes, don't listen to him for all those reasons,
2218320	2221600	but also don't listen to him because he's wrong.
2221600	2225680	At the start of the video, I talked about the anecdote of the young Andrew Tate
2225680	2227920	realizing that society is unfair,
2227920	2230160	that there are a tiny minority of rich people
2230160	2233040	hoarding a vast majority of the world's wealth.
2233040	2237120	Now, he looked at this unfair exploitative system and he said,
2237120	2242160	I'm going to climb up it by myself so I can buy a car.
2243040	2247760	This is a small, selfish, and cowardly way to look at the world.
2247760	2250480	When he realized society was unfair,
2250480	2253920	he didn't set out to change it to make it more fair.
2253920	2256640	He set out to take advantage of the unfairness,
2256640	2259440	to be a rich man exploiting poor men,
2259440	2262640	instead of a poor man being exploited by the rich.
2262640	2266080	And he got rich, partly, by swindling money out of men
2266080	2269120	who are in the same low position he was when he was broke.
2269680	2272400	Is this what real men are supposed to do?
2272400	2276480	Say, I'm gonna get mine, regardless of what I have to do to get there.
2276480	2279280	I don't care how silly I make myself look.
2279280	2281600	I don't care who I have to exploit.
2281600	2284640	I will have a Ferrari one day.
2284640	2288080	I can't imagine a more miserable outlook, I don't think.
2288080	2291840	And for any of his fans who've stuck around to the end of the video today,
2291840	2294960	can you honestly still tell me, with a straight face,
2294960	2299440	that choosing to live like he does has made Andrew Tate happy?
2299440	2302400	Anyway, thanks a lot for watching today, folks.
