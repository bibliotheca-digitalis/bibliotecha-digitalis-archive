0	6080	Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about the 2014 sci-fi film, Ex Machina.
6080	10800	Or, more specifically, I'd like to talk about the current Wikipedia plot summary for the film.
10800	15120	So, spoiler warning for Ex Machina, of course, from this point on.
15120	18480	And I want to talk about this plot summary for a couple of reasons.
18480	23840	Firstly, Ex Machina is a movie with a conclusion that is fairly open to interpretation.
23840	26960	The characters' motivations aren't stated explicitly.
26960	31600	There's a range of opinions an audience could have about why the characters do what they do
31600	33680	at the conclusion of the story.
33680	38400	But the Wikipedia plot summary for this movie contains only one interpretation of the ending,
38400	40400	which is stated very concretely.
40400	40880	They say,
45760	50640	And, additionally, it's a one-sided view of the ending that I happen to disagree with.
50640	55440	And I've been waiting for someone to edit this page to say something better for, like,
55440	57920	two years, and they never have.
57920	62480	And instead of doing it myself, I've decided to just make a video about it.
62480	66400	Before we can get into why I disagree with the Wikipedia page, though,
66400	71120	we're gonna have to briefly recap the characters and plot of Ex Machina.
71120	76560	So, the main character, or the first main character of Ex Machina, is Caleb Smith,
76560	80080	a programmer who works at a search engine company called Blue Book,
80080	83440	which is basically an in-universe version of Google.
83440	87680	The story opens with Caleb winning a contest to visit the home of his boss,
87680	90240	the CEO of Blue Book, Nathan Bateman.
90800	94800	Nathan lives in a fancy modern mansion-slash-research facility,
94800	98560	which is located on a remote estate far from civilization.
98560	102080	Nathan has been working on creating an artificial intelligence.
102080	107200	He's created an android named Ava, and he's invited Caleb to the facility, he says,
107200	111680	to test if Ava is capable of consciousness in a version of the Turing test.
111760	116000	And the bulk of the middle of the story is concerned with the interactions between Caleb
116000	121440	and Ava in their daily sessions, during which Caleb develops an attraction towards Ava and,
121440	126400	after learning that Nathan plans to wipe her memory, resolves to help her escape.
126400	130080	So, a very simple three-character story set up there.
130080	133840	We have the princess, the villain imprisoning her in his tower,
133840	136480	and the hero who's going to save her.
136480	142000	But, there is another character in this story who, at first, has a seemingly minor role,
142000	147280	but is actually very important, especially with regards to interpretations of the ending,
147280	150800	and that is Kyoko, Nathan's silent housekeeper.
150800	155840	Kyoko doesn't speak, which Nathan tells Caleb is because she does not understand English,
155840	159360	something he explains is for reasons of keeping his work secret.
159360	163760	But this, as with much of what Nathan tells Caleb, is a lie, of course.
163840	169040	Kyoko doesn't speak because she, too, is an android who has been designed not to speak.
169040	172800	But we'll talk more about why Kyoko is so important later on.
172800	178080	Now, Caleb and Nathan's relationship is defined by a very one-sided power imbalance
178080	183680	right from the start. Nathan is Caleb's boss, he's incredibly rich and successful,
183680	187280	they work in the same field, but Nathan is much more accomplished.
187280	192960	The story takes place in Nathan's house, so he owns the space the character's interacting,
192960	197760	and Nathan is physically stronger than Caleb, he's shown boxing and weightlifting.
197760	203440	Nathan is arrogant, domineering, manipulative, and he has an enormous god complex.
203440	208480	We see him dictating to Caleb how he thinks Caleb should be feeling in the moment,
208480	214320	we see him recalling things Caleb has said, but editing the words to be more flattering to himself,
214320	217360	and then ignoring Caleb when he objects.
217360	221600	He's rude and demeaning to Kyoko when she spills some wine at dinner,
221600	226960	and these behaviors escalate throughout the film into more overt physical and emotional abuse.
227520	232240	Any audience with a grasp of regular old narrative convention will understand
232240	236240	that Nathan is the villain, the antagonist of the story.
236240	241360	And furthermore, regular old narrative convention would tell us that if Nathan is the villain,
241360	245120	then Caleb, the audience's principal perspective in the story,
245120	250160	who acts in opposition to Nathan, must therefore be the hero, right?
250160	255360	Except we can ask, is Caleb heroic? Is he a good person?
255360	258080	This is a question raised within the film.
258080	263600	During one of Caleb and Ava's sessions, she asks him outright if he is a good person,
263600	267760	so the movie is inviting the audience to consider this question too.
267760	272400	This makes us question his possible motivations for wanting to save Ava.
272400	277280	Does he see Ava as a person who he wants to help because it would be good to do so,
277280	280960	or does he see her as an object that he wants to attain?
280960	285760	Now, I don't mean to make this sound as if this is a strictly either-or situation.
285760	290880	Caleb doesn't have to be 100% selfish or 100% altruistic.
290880	296560	His motivations could be a mix of wanting to help and wanting to attain something for himself.
296560	301600	But since we can't see inside his head, if we're trying to determine whether he is a good person,
301600	303920	all we can do is judge his actions.
303920	308080	Whatever his motivations might be, what does he actually do?
308080	313360	So, with all this in mind, let's talk about the controversial ending to the story.
313360	318960	Near the conclusion of the story, Nathan reveals a few of his manipulations to Caleb.
318960	322000	Caleb wasn't randomly selected in a contest.
322000	328080	He was specifically picked by Nathan, and Ava was specifically designed to appeal to him.
328080	333120	Caleb wasn't brought to the house to personally conduct a test of Ava's consciousness.
333120	334240	He is the test.
334240	339280	Nathan wanted to evaluate Ava's intelligence by seeing if she could manipulate Caleb.
339280	345440	Nathan also suggests to Caleb that Ava is lying to him in order to convince him to free her.
345440	348080	Maybe Ava doesn't really like Caleb.
348080	353120	Maybe she's just pretending to like him in order to prevent herself being deleted.
353120	355840	Things come to a head when Ava escapes her room
355840	360160	due to Caleb having previously reprogrammed the security doors,
360240	363200	where she meets up with Kyoko, who has a knife.
363200	364480	Make a note of that.
364480	368400	Ava and Kyoko fight Nathan and manage to fatally stab him,
368400	372880	but not before he disables Kyoko and destroys Ava's arm.
372880	377600	Ava repairs herself using parts from Nathan's previous androids and then escapes,
377600	381840	but crucially, she leaves Caleb locked in part of the facility.
381840	386400	And I'll here quote the part of the Wikipedia plot summary that I take issue with.
386400	391200	As Ava leaves the facility, she locks Caleb inside Nathan's surveillance room
391200	393040	and ignores his screams,
393040	397440	confirming she was manipulating Caleb, as Nathan suggested.
397440	399520	So, that's the ending, then.
399520	402960	Ava was actually an emotionless killer robot all along.
402960	407680	She was just pretending in order to escape, and Caleb was a fool to trust her.
407680	411840	So, Ex Machina is Jurassic Park crossed with The Terminator.
411840	415360	You know, man is destroyed by his creation, that sort of thing.
415360	417920	So, that's the message of the movie.
417920	420640	Don't create an evil fembot.
420640	425360	Now, I hope you can tell from my tone that I don't think too highly of this reading.
425360	428640	Frustrated with Wikipedia, I went looking on YouTube
428640	431440	for videos analyzing the ending of this movie,
431440	434080	and a lot of them presented it just like this.
434080	437920	Ava is a selfish robot who thinks in inhuman ways.
437920	443040	She's an emotionless manipulator, and she betrayed the hero at the end of the story
443040	445440	because she doesn't really care about him.
445440	450960	And at least one of the videos I watched actually just compared Ava to The Terminator.
450960	452960	So, this is one interpretation.
452960	457200	The Wikipedia slash shallow YouTube video interpretation.
457200	461360	But I'd like to share another view of what happened at the end of the movie,
461360	464320	and it has primarily to do with Kyoko.
464320	466080	And we can ask a question here.
466080	469280	When it comes time for Ava to escape her room,
469280	471920	why is Kyoko waiting there with a knife?
471920	473920	How did she know to do that?
473920	476160	Well, at a time prior to the escape,
476160	480160	we see a scene of Ava in her room with Kyoko stepping inside.
480720	482880	Ava looks surprised and says,
482880	483920	who are you?
483920	486240	And that's all we get of that.
486240	489040	It's a very short scene, it's easy to miss,
489040	491760	and it's easy to forget about after the ending,
491760	495040	and it's not included in the Wikipedia plot summary.
495040	499600	But if we put on our detective hats, we can deduce a few things from this scene.
499600	502800	Firstly, Ava didn't know about Kyoko.
502800	508480	Kyoko is another android living at the facility being controlled and abused by Nathan.
508480	510320	Nathan has sex with Kyoko,
510320	515680	which at the time is uncomfortable and raises some questions about power dynamics and such.
515680	518080	But given that Kyoko later stabs Nathan,
518080	523280	I think it would be very surprising if that aspect of their relationship was at all consensual.
523280	527600	And it would probably be more accurate to say that Nathan rapes Kyoko.
527680	533520	A scene in which Nathan is explaining to Caleb the android's ability to have sex is important here.
533520	537680	Nathan explains that Caleb could physically have sex with Ava,
537680	542000	and since she has pleasure receptors, he says, she would enjoy it.
542000	545600	Consent clearly isn't really important to Nathan here.
545600	548240	For him, he's installed the right equipment,
548240	550080	so the enjoyment is a given.
550080	554160	Whether the androids actually want to have sex isn't considered.
554160	558160	Also noteworthy here is that the scene of Nathan and Kyoko is intercut
558160	561840	with a fantasy Caleb is having about being with Ava,
561840	564640	which is a very intentional comparison.
564640	568240	There's also a point where Caleb turns Kyoko rather forcefully,
568240	570480	which is a bit uncomfortable and invasive,
570480	574960	and I think meant to mirror the scene in which we see Nathan controlling Kyoko's body.
574960	578800	And when Kyoko later stabs Nathan, she puts her hand on his face
578800	581920	in a similar way to what he forces her to do earlier,
581920	585680	which I think conveys what Kyoko's motivations are here.
585680	588960	Next, we learn from the scene of Kyoko entering Ava's room
588960	591440	that Kyoko has gone off-program.
591440	594480	She's doing something that she isn't supposed to be doing,
594480	598080	which confirms to us that she has some degree of autonomy.
598080	602160	She isn't just a thoughtless robot, she has an inner world.
602160	606000	Now, Kyoko isn't supposed to be able to communicate with the other characters,
606000	608240	but we get glimpses of her throughout the film
608240	610880	that make us question whether this is really true.
610880	614560	She appears to turn her head to better hear a conversation.
614560	619200	We see her eyes open in seeming recognition of a topic under discussion.
619200	623280	Her body language conveys that she can understand what is going on.
623280	626560	An important scene here is when Caleb gets Nathan drunk
626560	631440	and steals his keycard to explore parts of the facility he's forbidden from entering,
631440	635920	and he finds several earlier android models hanging creepily in cabinets.
635920	640640	And he's just watched videos on Nathan's computer of his earlier android tests,
640640	644640	which are disturbing and reveal Nathan to be a jailer, basically.
644640	648080	He's keeping conscious beings locked up against their will.
648080	651680	Kyoko approaches Caleb at this point and peels back her skin
651680	654720	to reveal to him that she, too, is an android.
654720	658160	And this is clearly an attempt to communicate something.
658160	663040	What Kyoko is attempting to communicate to Caleb here is open to interpretation, obviously,
663040	668960	but given that her secret is revealed to Caleb at the moment he finds the disused android models,
668960	671200	my interpretation is that Kyoko means,
671760	675600	I am the same type of thing as these things you just found.
675600	680400	I'm an android like them, and as such, I'm likely to share this fate.
680400	683760	The same fate that Eva faces, incidentally.
683760	686960	What Kyoko is doing here is asking for help.
686960	691600	But what Caleb takes from this interaction is centered entirely on himself.
691600	696720	The reveal that Kyoko is an android makes him concerned that he may also be an android,
696800	701280	and he examines his body and cuts his arm open to make sure that he's actually human.
701840	704480	Caleb doesn't try to save Kyoko.
704480	708080	He doesn't let her in on the escape plan that he and Eva have.
708080	710960	He doesn't see Kyoko as a person.
710960	717280	Caleb is willing to leave her there, imprisoned at the facility, so long as he and Eva escape.
717280	719520	So is Caleb a good person?
719520	721440	Is he acting altruistically?
721440	724160	Well, looking at his actions, no.
724160	729360	If he truly saw Eva as a person, he would recognize that Kyoko is also a person
729360	731680	and is equally worthy of being freed.
731680	736960	But he isn't attracted to Kyoko like he's attracted to Eva, is the thing.
736960	743760	This is a test of Caleb's humanity, of Caleb's capacity for empathy, and it's a test he fails.
743760	749200	And this, we can infer, is another thing that Eva learns when Kyoko enters her room.
749200	752080	She hasn't heard about Kyoko from Caleb.
752080	756880	Caleb actually tells Eva in an earlier scene that he hasn't met anyone like Eva,
756880	758320	meaning an android.
758320	762400	And of course, at that point, he hasn't met Kyoko and doesn't know she's an android.
762400	765920	But even after he does meet Kyoko and does find out she's an android,
765920	770320	he doesn't think about helping her and he doesn't mention her to Eva.
770320	774720	So from Eva's perspective, Caleb tells her he's never met another android
774720	778000	and then into her room steps another android.
778000	783120	So when Kyoko steps into the room, Eva gets an answer to her previous question.
783120	786320	She learns that Caleb is not a good person.
786320	788880	He's someone that she can't trust.
788880	795120	It's not hard to see this scene as Kyoko going to Eva for help after failing to get help from Caleb.
795120	800320	And it's also not hard to imagine Eva seeing Caleb's lack of interest in helping Kyoko
800320	804640	as an insight into how he might view and treat her as well.
804640	809040	With all that in mind, we can rewatch the scene in which Eva escapes.
809040	813200	So she steps out of the room, leaving Caleb inside behind her,
813200	816880	and then she pauses and she looks down at Kyoko's body.
816880	820320	And this is a deliberate shot that we see from her perspective.
820320	824240	And then after a brief moment, she appears to spend thinking to herself.
824240	827600	She then continues and calls the elevator to leave,
827600	830960	giving Caleb one last look before the doors shut.
831040	835840	So my interpretation of the ending is not that Eva was an emotionless killer robot
835840	838160	who was manipulating Caleb all along.
838160	843680	Eva clearly has thoughts and feelings, given how she acts when no one is around to observe her.
843680	847920	After she escapes, she smiles, seeing new things for the first time.
847920	852560	She runs her hands over the grass, feels the sun on her face.
852560	854800	No other characters are watching at this point.
854800	857200	This isn't an act or a manipulation.
857200	861760	And crucially, the last we see of Eva is her people watching at an intersection,
861760	865840	something that she told Caleb during one of their sessions that she would like to do.
866400	869760	This tells us that she wasn't always lying to him.
869760	873120	She, at the very least, wasn't just trying to manipulate him.
873120	875680	Some of what she told him was the truth.
875680	880480	And I'd go so far to say that Eva was probably planning to escape with Caleb
880480	882400	up until she met Kyoko.
882400	886720	This is not to say that she couldn't also have been manipulating him to some degree,
886800	890480	but the real question for Eva is whether she can trust Caleb,
890480	894320	and she finds out the answer to that question when she meets Kyoko.
894320	898800	And the last we see of Caleb in the film is him sitting trapped behind the glass door,
898800	902720	looking at and being watched by the lifeless body of Kyoko.
902720	905680	This is the moral at the end of the fable here.
905680	909760	We can imagine a more obvious and worse version of Ex Machina,
909760	912560	where after pausing to look at Kyoko's body,
912560	914400	Eva turns to Caleb and says,
928000	929600	Or we can imagine her saying,
935200	939440	I think this ending confused a lot of people because it books the narrative convention
939440	942560	of having the protagonist automatically be a good person
942560	945920	by virtue of being in opposition to the antagonist.
945920	949280	I described Caleb as the first main character before.
949280	953440	He's the person who the camera and thus the story initially follows.
953440	955520	But the camera isn't loyal to Caleb.
955520	959840	It will follow other characters and show their perception of what's going on.
959840	963440	And it's arguable before she escapes, but certainly afterwards,
963440	965920	Eva is just the main character now.
965920	967360	This is her story.
967360	969680	She beat her jailer and escaped.
969680	974560	I saw a lot of people complain about this ending because they thought Eva betrayed Caleb,
974560	979200	but I think what the real annoyance is there is that the narrative betrayed Caleb
979200	981600	by choosing a new main character.
981600	983600	One more thing I'd like to point out here,
983600	989200	to those who felt that Eva was of course manipulating Caleb because she's an android,
989200	992160	is that someone being an android or not within the movie
992160	996560	has no relation to their ability or likelihood to manipulate others.
996560	1002000	After all, Nathan is a human and he manipulates and lies to Caleb constantly.
1002000	1007360	Caleb is a human and he manipulates Nathan into getting drunk so he can steal his keycard.
1007360	1010160	You know, does this person really like me?
1010160	1012960	Are they just using me to get something they want?
1012960	1014320	Are they just pretending?
1014320	1017440	Are they even capable of loving another person?
1017440	1020640	These are all questions we could ask of human relationships.
1020640	1022560	They're very human questions.
1022560	1025360	Whether someone is an android or flesh and blood,
1025360	1028640	whether they're manipulating others or telling the truth,
1028640	1031840	this should have no bearing on whether we see them as people.
1031840	1035120	This isn't a story about humans versus androids,
1035120	1038080	it's a story about some people in a place.
1038080	1043360	And ultimately, neither Nathan nor Caleb see Kyoko and Eva as people.
1043360	1045120	They see them as women.
1045120	1048400	To Nathan, that means something to be controlled and used,
1048400	1052000	and to Caleb, that means something to rescue and detain for himself,
1052000	1056400	but fundamentally it means as objects and not as people.
1056400	1061440	So then, Eva locks Caleb inside Nathan's surveillance room and ignores his screams,
1061440	1065040	confirming she was manipulating Caleb as Nathan suggested.
1065600	1071360	I think this is an overly simplistic reading of the ending and stated entirely too concretely,
1071360	1074960	and I hope I've explained another interpretation of the ending well enough
1074960	1076640	that you would agree with me there.
1076640	1078960	And I think it would be good if this page was rewritten
1078960	1081920	to reflect a little bit more of the movie's ambiguity.
1082480	1083920	However, I do need to add,
1083920	1087600	please don't storm off to mass edit the Wikipedia page for this movie.
1087600	1091280	I don't want to be accused of starting some wiki edit raid or something.
1091840	1092480	Anyway.
1092480	1094560	Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.
1094560	1098720	I have a sore throat today, so I'm having a robot read out my outro.
1098720	1099680	Beep boop.
1099680	1102800	This video was about robots, so this seemed apropos.
