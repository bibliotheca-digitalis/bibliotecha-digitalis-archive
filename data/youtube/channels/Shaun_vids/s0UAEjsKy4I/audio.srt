00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about the 2014 sci-fi film, Ex Machina.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,800
Or, more specifically, I'd like to talk about the current Wikipedia plot summary for the film.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,120
So, spoiler warning for Ex Machina, of course, from this point on.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,480
And I want to talk about this plot summary for a couple of reasons.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,840
Firstly, Ex Machina is a movie with a conclusion that is fairly open to interpretation.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,960
The characters' motivations aren't stated explicitly.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,600
There's a range of opinions an audience could have about why the characters do what they do

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,680
at the conclusion of the story.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,400
But the Wikipedia plot summary for this movie contains only one interpretation of the ending,

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,400
which is stated very concretely.

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:40,880
They say,

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,640
And, additionally, it's a one-sided view of the ending that I happen to disagree with.

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,440
And I've been waiting for someone to edit this page to say something better for, like,

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,920
two years, and they never have.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,480
And instead of doing it myself, I've decided to just make a video about it.

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,400
Before we can get into why I disagree with the Wikipedia page, though,

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,120
we're gonna have to briefly recap the characters and plot of Ex Machina.

18
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,560
So, the main character, or the first main character of Ex Machina, is Caleb Smith,

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,080
a programmer who works at a search engine company called Blue Book,

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,440
which is basically an in-universe version of Google.

21
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,680
The story opens with Caleb winning a contest to visit the home of his boss,

22
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,240
the CEO of Blue Book, Nathan Bateman.

23
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Nathan lives in a fancy modern mansion-slash-research facility,

24
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,560
which is located on a remote estate far from civilization.

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,080
Nathan has been working on creating an artificial intelligence.

26
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,200
He's created an android named Ava, and he's invited Caleb to the facility, he says,

27
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,680
to test if Ava is capable of consciousness in a version of the Turing test.

28
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,000
And the bulk of the middle of the story is concerned with the interactions between Caleb

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,440
and Ava in their daily sessions, during which Caleb develops an attraction towards Ava and,

30
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,400
after learning that Nathan plans to wipe her memory, resolves to help her escape.

31
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,080
So, a very simple three-character story set up there.

32
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,840
We have the princess, the villain imprisoning her in his tower,

33
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,480
and the hero who's going to save her.

34
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,000
But, there is another character in this story who, at first, has a seemingly minor role,

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,280
but is actually very important, especially with regards to interpretations of the ending,

36
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,800
and that is Kyoko, Nathan's silent housekeeper.

37
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,840
Kyoko doesn't speak, which Nathan tells Caleb is because she does not understand English,

38
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,360
something he explains is for reasons of keeping his work secret.

39
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,760
But this, as with much of what Nathan tells Caleb, is a lie, of course.

40
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,040
Kyoko doesn't speak because she, too, is an android who has been designed not to speak.

41
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,800
But we'll talk more about why Kyoko is so important later on.

42
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,080
Now, Caleb and Nathan's relationship is defined by a very one-sided power imbalance

43
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,680
right from the start. Nathan is Caleb's boss, he's incredibly rich and successful,

44
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,280
they work in the same field, but Nathan is much more accomplished.

45
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,960
The story takes place in Nathan's house, so he owns the space the character's interacting,

46
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,760
and Nathan is physically stronger than Caleb, he's shown boxing and weightlifting.

47
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,440
Nathan is arrogant, domineering, manipulative, and he has an enormous god complex.

48
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,480
We see him dictating to Caleb how he thinks Caleb should be feeling in the moment,

49
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,320
we see him recalling things Caleb has said, but editing the words to be more flattering to himself,

50
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,360
and then ignoring Caleb when he objects.

51
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,600
He's rude and demeaning to Kyoko when she spills some wine at dinner,

52
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,960
and these behaviors escalate throughout the film into more overt physical and emotional abuse.

53
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,240
Any audience with a grasp of regular old narrative convention will understand

54
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,240
that Nathan is the villain, the antagonist of the story.

55
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,360
And furthermore, regular old narrative convention would tell us that if Nathan is the villain,

56
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,120
then Caleb, the audience's principal perspective in the story,

57
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,160
who acts in opposition to Nathan, must therefore be the hero, right?

58
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,360
Except we can ask, is Caleb heroic? Is he a good person?

59
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,080
This is a question raised within the film.

60
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:23,600
During one of Caleb and Ava's sessions, she asks him outright if he is a good person,

61
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,760
so the movie is inviting the audience to consider this question too.

62
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,400
This makes us question his possible motivations for wanting to save Ava.

63
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,280
Does he see Ava as a person who he wants to help because it would be good to do so,

64
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,960
or does he see her as an object that he wants to attain?

65
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,760
Now, I don't mean to make this sound as if this is a strictly either-or situation.

66
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,880
Caleb doesn't have to be 100% selfish or 100% altruistic.

67
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,560
His motivations could be a mix of wanting to help and wanting to attain something for himself.

68
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,600
But since we can't see inside his head, if we're trying to determine whether he is a good person,

69
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,920
all we can do is judge his actions.

70
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,080
Whatever his motivations might be, what does he actually do?

71
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,360
So, with all this in mind, let's talk about the controversial ending to the story.

72
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,960
Near the conclusion of the story, Nathan reveals a few of his manipulations to Caleb.

73
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,000
Caleb wasn't randomly selected in a contest.

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,080
He was specifically picked by Nathan, and Ava was specifically designed to appeal to him.

75
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,120
Caleb wasn't brought to the house to personally conduct a test of Ava's consciousness.

76
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,240
He is the test.

77
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,280
Nathan wanted to evaluate Ava's intelligence by seeing if she could manipulate Caleb.

78
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,440
Nathan also suggests to Caleb that Ava is lying to him in order to convince him to free her.

79
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,080
Maybe Ava doesn't really like Caleb.

80
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,120
Maybe she's just pretending to like him in order to prevent herself being deleted.

81
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,840
Things come to a head when Ava escapes her room

82
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,160
due to Caleb having previously reprogrammed the security doors,

83
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,200
where she meets up with Kyoko, who has a knife.

84
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,480
Make a note of that.

85
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,400
Ava and Kyoko fight Nathan and manage to fatally stab him,

86
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,880
but not before he disables Kyoko and destroys Ava's arm.

87
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,600
Ava repairs herself using parts from Nathan's previous androids and then escapes,

88
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,840
but crucially, she leaves Caleb locked in part of the facility.

89
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,400
And I'll here quote the part of the Wikipedia plot summary that I take issue with.

90
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,200
As Ava leaves the facility, she locks Caleb inside Nathan's surveillance room

91
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,040
and ignores his screams,

92
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,440
confirming she was manipulating Caleb, as Nathan suggested.

93
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,520
So, that's the ending, then.

94
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,960
Ava was actually an emotionless killer robot all along.

95
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,680
She was just pretending in order to escape, and Caleb was a fool to trust her.

96
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,840
So, Ex Machina is Jurassic Park crossed with The Terminator.

97
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,360
You know, man is destroyed by his creation, that sort of thing.

98
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,920
So, that's the message of the movie.

99
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,640
Don't create an evil fembot.

100
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,360
Now, I hope you can tell from my tone that I don't think too highly of this reading.

101
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,640
Frustrated with Wikipedia, I went looking on YouTube

102
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,440
for videos analyzing the ending of this movie,

103
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,080
and a lot of them presented it just like this.

104
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,920
Ava is a selfish robot who thinks in inhuman ways.

105
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:23,040
She's an emotionless manipulator, and she betrayed the hero at the end of the story

106
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,440
because she doesn't really care about him.

107
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,960
And at least one of the videos I watched actually just compared Ava to The Terminator.

108
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,960
So, this is one interpretation.

109
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,200
The Wikipedia slash shallow YouTube video interpretation.

110
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,360
But I'd like to share another view of what happened at the end of the movie,

111
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,320
and it has primarily to do with Kyoko.

112
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,080
And we can ask a question here.

113
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,280
When it comes time for Ava to escape her room,

114
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,920
why is Kyoko waiting there with a knife?

115
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,920
How did she know to do that?

116
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,160
Well, at a time prior to the escape,

117
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,160
we see a scene of Ava in her room with Kyoko stepping inside.

118
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,880
Ava looks surprised and says,

119
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,920
who are you?

120
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,240
And that's all we get of that.

121
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,040
It's a very short scene, it's easy to miss,

122
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,760
and it's easy to forget about after the ending,

123
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,040
and it's not included in the Wikipedia plot summary.

124
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,600
But if we put on our detective hats, we can deduce a few things from this scene.

125
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,800
Firstly, Ava didn't know about Kyoko.

126
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,480
Kyoko is another android living at the facility being controlled and abused by Nathan.

127
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,320
Nathan has sex with Kyoko,

128
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:35,680
which at the time is uncomfortable and raises some questions about power dynamics and such.

129
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,080
But given that Kyoko later stabs Nathan,

130
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,280
I think it would be very surprising if that aspect of their relationship was at all consensual.

131
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,600
And it would probably be more accurate to say that Nathan rapes Kyoko.

132
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,520
A scene in which Nathan is explaining to Caleb the android's ability to have sex is important here.

133
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,680
Nathan explains that Caleb could physically have sex with Ava,

134
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,000
and since she has pleasure receptors, he says, she would enjoy it.

135
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,600
Consent clearly isn't really important to Nathan here.

136
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,240
For him, he's installed the right equipment,

137
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,080
so the enjoyment is a given.

138
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,160
Whether the androids actually want to have sex isn't considered.

139
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,160
Also noteworthy here is that the scene of Nathan and Kyoko is intercut

140
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,840
with a fantasy Caleb is having about being with Ava,

141
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,640
which is a very intentional comparison.

142
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,240
There's also a point where Caleb turns Kyoko rather forcefully,

143
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,480
which is a bit uncomfortable and invasive,

144
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,960
and I think meant to mirror the scene in which we see Nathan controlling Kyoko's body.

145
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,800
And when Kyoko later stabs Nathan, she puts her hand on his face

146
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,920
in a similar way to what he forces her to do earlier,

147
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,680
which I think conveys what Kyoko's motivations are here.

148
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,960
Next, we learn from the scene of Kyoko entering Ava's room

149
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,440
that Kyoko has gone off-program.

150
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,480
She's doing something that she isn't supposed to be doing,

151
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,080
which confirms to us that she has some degree of autonomy.

152
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,160
She isn't just a thoughtless robot, she has an inner world.

153
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,000
Now, Kyoko isn't supposed to be able to communicate with the other characters,

154
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,240
but we get glimpses of her throughout the film

155
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,880
that make us question whether this is really true.

156
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,560
She appears to turn her head to better hear a conversation.

157
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,200
We see her eyes open in seeming recognition of a topic under discussion.

158
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,280
Her body language conveys that she can understand what is going on.

159
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,560
An important scene here is when Caleb gets Nathan drunk

160
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,440
and steals his keycard to explore parts of the facility he's forbidden from entering,

161
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,920
and he finds several earlier android models hanging creepily in cabinets.

162
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,640
And he's just watched videos on Nathan's computer of his earlier android tests,

163
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,640
which are disturbing and reveal Nathan to be a jailer, basically.

164
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,080
He's keeping conscious beings locked up against their will.

165
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,680
Kyoko approaches Caleb at this point and peels back her skin

166
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,720
to reveal to him that she, too, is an android.

167
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,160
And this is clearly an attempt to communicate something.

168
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,040
What Kyoko is attempting to communicate to Caleb here is open to interpretation, obviously,

169
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,960
but given that her secret is revealed to Caleb at the moment he finds the disused android models,

170
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,200
my interpretation is that Kyoko means,

171
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,600
I am the same type of thing as these things you just found.

172
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,400
I'm an android like them, and as such, I'm likely to share this fate.

173
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,760
The same fate that Eva faces, incidentally.

174
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,960
What Kyoko is doing here is asking for help.

175
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,600
But what Caleb takes from this interaction is centered entirely on himself.

176
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,720
The reveal that Kyoko is an android makes him concerned that he may also be an android,

177
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,280
and he examines his body and cuts his arm open to make sure that he's actually human.

178
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,480
Caleb doesn't try to save Kyoko.

179
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,080
He doesn't let her in on the escape plan that he and Eva have.

180
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,960
He doesn't see Kyoko as a person.

181
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:57,280
Caleb is willing to leave her there, imprisoned at the facility, so long as he and Eva escape.

182
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,520
So is Caleb a good person?

183
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,440
Is he acting altruistically?

184
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,160
Well, looking at his actions, no.

185
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,360
If he truly saw Eva as a person, he would recognize that Kyoko is also a person

186
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,680
and is equally worthy of being freed.

187
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,960
But he isn't attracted to Kyoko like he's attracted to Eva, is the thing.

188
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:23,760
This is a test of Caleb's humanity, of Caleb's capacity for empathy, and it's a test he fails.

189
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,200
And this, we can infer, is another thing that Eva learns when Kyoko enters her room.

190
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,080
She hasn't heard about Kyoko from Caleb.

191
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,880
Caleb actually tells Eva in an earlier scene that he hasn't met anyone like Eva,

192
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,320
meaning an android.

193
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,400
And of course, at that point, he hasn't met Kyoko and doesn't know she's an android.

194
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,920
But even after he does meet Kyoko and does find out she's an android,

195
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,320
he doesn't think about helping her and he doesn't mention her to Eva.

196
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,720
So from Eva's perspective, Caleb tells her he's never met another android

197
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,000
and then into her room steps another android.

198
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,120
So when Kyoko steps into the room, Eva gets an answer to her previous question.

199
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,320
She learns that Caleb is not a good person.

200
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,880
He's someone that she can't trust.

201
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:15,120
It's not hard to see this scene as Kyoko going to Eva for help after failing to get help from Caleb.

202
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,320
And it's also not hard to imagine Eva seeing Caleb's lack of interest in helping Kyoko

203
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,640
as an insight into how he might view and treat her as well.

204
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:29,040
With all that in mind, we can rewatch the scene in which Eva escapes.

205
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,200
So she steps out of the room, leaving Caleb inside behind her,

206
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,880
and then she pauses and she looks down at Kyoko's body.

207
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,320
And this is a deliberate shot that we see from her perspective.

208
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,240
And then after a brief moment, she appears to spend thinking to herself.

209
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,600
She then continues and calls the elevator to leave,

210
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,960
giving Caleb one last look before the doors shut.

211
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,840
So my interpretation of the ending is not that Eva was an emotionless killer robot

212
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,160
who was manipulating Caleb all along.

213
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,680
Eva clearly has thoughts and feelings, given how she acts when no one is around to observe her.

214
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,920
After she escapes, she smiles, seeing new things for the first time.

215
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,560
She runs her hands over the grass, feels the sun on her face.

216
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,800
No other characters are watching at this point.

217
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,200
This isn't an act or a manipulation.

218
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,760
And crucially, the last we see of Eva is her people watching at an intersection,

219
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,840
something that she told Caleb during one of their sessions that she would like to do.

220
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,760
This tells us that she wasn't always lying to him.

221
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,120
She, at the very least, wasn't just trying to manipulate him.

222
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,680
Some of what she told him was the truth.

223
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,480
And I'd go so far to say that Eva was probably planning to escape with Caleb

224
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,400
up until she met Kyoko.

225
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,720
This is not to say that she couldn't also have been manipulating him to some degree,

226
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,480
but the real question for Eva is whether she can trust Caleb,

227
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,320
and she finds out the answer to that question when she meets Kyoko.

228
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,800
And the last we see of Caleb in the film is him sitting trapped behind the glass door,

229
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,720
looking at and being watched by the lifeless body of Kyoko.

230
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,680
This is the moral at the end of the fable here.

231
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,760
We can imagine a more obvious and worse version of Ex Machina,

232
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,560
where after pausing to look at Kyoko's body,

233
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,400
Eva turns to Caleb and says,

234
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,600
Or we can imagine her saying,

235
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,440
I think this ending confused a lot of people because it books the narrative convention

236
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,560
of having the protagonist automatically be a good person

237
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,920
by virtue of being in opposition to the antagonist.

238
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,280
I described Caleb as the first main character before.

239
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,440
He's the person who the camera and thus the story initially follows.

240
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,520
But the camera isn't loyal to Caleb.

241
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,840
It will follow other characters and show their perception of what's going on.

242
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,440
And it's arguable before she escapes, but certainly afterwards,

243
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,920
Eva is just the main character now.

244
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,360
This is her story.

245
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,680
She beat her jailer and escaped.

246
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,560
I saw a lot of people complain about this ending because they thought Eva betrayed Caleb,

247
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,200
but I think what the real annoyance is there is that the narrative betrayed Caleb

248
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,600
by choosing a new main character.

249
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,600
One more thing I'd like to point out here,

250
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,200
to those who felt that Eva was of course manipulating Caleb because she's an android,

251
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,160
is that someone being an android or not within the movie

252
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,560
has no relation to their ability or likelihood to manipulate others.

253
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,000
After all, Nathan is a human and he manipulates and lies to Caleb constantly.

254
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,360
Caleb is a human and he manipulates Nathan into getting drunk so he can steal his keycard.

255
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,160
You know, does this person really like me?

256
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,960
Are they just using me to get something they want?

257
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,320
Are they just pretending?

258
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,440
Are they even capable of loving another person?

259
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,640
These are all questions we could ask of human relationships.

260
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,560
They're very human questions.

261
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,360
Whether someone is an android or flesh and blood,

262
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,640
whether they're manipulating others or telling the truth,

263
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,840
this should have no bearing on whether we see them as people.

264
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,120
This isn't a story about humans versus androids,

265
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,080
it's a story about some people in a place.

266
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:23,360
And ultimately, neither Nathan nor Caleb see Kyoko and Eva as people.

267
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,120
They see them as women.

268
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,400
To Nathan, that means something to be controlled and used,

269
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,000
and to Caleb, that means something to rescue and detain for himself,

270
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,400
but fundamentally it means as objects and not as people.

271
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,440
So then, Eva locks Caleb inside Nathan's surveillance room and ignores his screams,

272
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,040
confirming she was manipulating Caleb as Nathan suggested.

273
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,360
I think this is an overly simplistic reading of the ending and stated entirely too concretely,

274
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,960
and I hope I've explained another interpretation of the ending well enough

275
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,640
that you would agree with me there.

276
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,960
And I think it would be good if this page was rewritten

277
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,920
to reflect a little bit more of the movie's ambiguity.

278
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,920
However, I do need to add,

279
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,600
please don't storm off to mass edit the Wikipedia page for this movie.

280
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,280
I don't want to be accused of starting some wiki edit raid or something.

281
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,480
Anyway.

282
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,560
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

283
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,720
I have a sore throat today, so I'm having a robot read out my outro.

284
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,680
Beep boop.

285
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,800
This video was about robots, so this seemed apropos.

286
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,040
Thank you especially to all my supporters over on Patreon.
