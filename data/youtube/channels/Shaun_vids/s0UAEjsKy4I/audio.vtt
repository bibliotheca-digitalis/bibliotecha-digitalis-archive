00:00.000 --> 00:06.080
Hello, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about the 2014 sci-fi film, Ex Machina.

00:06.080 --> 00:10.800
Or, more specifically, I'd like to talk about the current Wikipedia plot summary for the film.

00:10.800 --> 00:15.120
So, spoiler warning for Ex Machina, of course, from this point on.

00:15.120 --> 00:18.480
And I want to talk about this plot summary for a couple of reasons.

00:18.480 --> 00:23.840
Firstly, Ex Machina is a movie with a conclusion that is fairly open to interpretation.

00:23.840 --> 00:26.960
The characters' motivations aren't stated explicitly.

00:26.960 --> 00:31.600
There's a range of opinions an audience could have about why the characters do what they do

00:31.600 --> 00:33.680
at the conclusion of the story.

00:33.680 --> 00:38.400
But the Wikipedia plot summary for this movie contains only one interpretation of the ending,

00:38.400 --> 00:40.400
which is stated very concretely.

00:40.400 --> 00:40.880
They say,

00:45.760 --> 00:50.640
And, additionally, it's a one-sided view of the ending that I happen to disagree with.

00:50.640 --> 00:55.440
And I've been waiting for someone to edit this page to say something better for, like,

00:55.440 --> 00:57.920
two years, and they never have.

00:57.920 --> 01:02.480
And instead of doing it myself, I've decided to just make a video about it.

01:02.480 --> 01:06.400
Before we can get into why I disagree with the Wikipedia page, though,

01:06.400 --> 01:11.120
we're gonna have to briefly recap the characters and plot of Ex Machina.

01:11.120 --> 01:16.560
So, the main character, or the first main character of Ex Machina, is Caleb Smith,

01:16.560 --> 01:20.080
a programmer who works at a search engine company called Blue Book,

01:20.080 --> 01:23.440
which is basically an in-universe version of Google.

01:23.440 --> 01:27.680
The story opens with Caleb winning a contest to visit the home of his boss,

01:27.680 --> 01:30.240
the CEO of Blue Book, Nathan Bateman.

01:30.800 --> 01:34.800
Nathan lives in a fancy modern mansion-slash-research facility,

01:34.800 --> 01:38.560
which is located on a remote estate far from civilization.

01:38.560 --> 01:42.080
Nathan has been working on creating an artificial intelligence.

01:42.080 --> 01:47.200
He's created an android named Ava, and he's invited Caleb to the facility, he says,

01:47.200 --> 01:51.680
to test if Ava is capable of consciousness in a version of the Turing test.

01:51.760 --> 01:56.000
And the bulk of the middle of the story is concerned with the interactions between Caleb

01:56.000 --> 02:01.440
and Ava in their daily sessions, during which Caleb develops an attraction towards Ava and,

02:01.440 --> 02:06.400
after learning that Nathan plans to wipe her memory, resolves to help her escape.

02:06.400 --> 02:10.080
So, a very simple three-character story set up there.

02:10.080 --> 02:13.840
We have the princess, the villain imprisoning her in his tower,

02:13.840 --> 02:16.480
and the hero who's going to save her.

02:16.480 --> 02:22.000
But, there is another character in this story who, at first, has a seemingly minor role,

02:22.000 --> 02:27.280
but is actually very important, especially with regards to interpretations of the ending,

02:27.280 --> 02:30.800
and that is Kyoko, Nathan's silent housekeeper.

02:30.800 --> 02:35.840
Kyoko doesn't speak, which Nathan tells Caleb is because she does not understand English,

02:35.840 --> 02:39.360
something he explains is for reasons of keeping his work secret.

02:39.360 --> 02:43.760
But this, as with much of what Nathan tells Caleb, is a lie, of course.

02:43.840 --> 02:49.040
Kyoko doesn't speak because she, too, is an android who has been designed not to speak.

02:49.040 --> 02:52.800
But we'll talk more about why Kyoko is so important later on.

02:52.800 --> 02:58.080
Now, Caleb and Nathan's relationship is defined by a very one-sided power imbalance

02:58.080 --> 03:03.680
right from the start. Nathan is Caleb's boss, he's incredibly rich and successful,

03:03.680 --> 03:07.280
they work in the same field, but Nathan is much more accomplished.

03:07.280 --> 03:12.960
The story takes place in Nathan's house, so he owns the space the character's interacting,

03:12.960 --> 03:17.760
and Nathan is physically stronger than Caleb, he's shown boxing and weightlifting.

03:17.760 --> 03:23.440
Nathan is arrogant, domineering, manipulative, and he has an enormous god complex.

03:23.440 --> 03:28.480
We see him dictating to Caleb how he thinks Caleb should be feeling in the moment,

03:28.480 --> 03:34.320
we see him recalling things Caleb has said, but editing the words to be more flattering to himself,

03:34.320 --> 03:37.360
and then ignoring Caleb when he objects.

03:37.360 --> 03:41.600
He's rude and demeaning to Kyoko when she spills some wine at dinner,

03:41.600 --> 03:46.960
and these behaviors escalate throughout the film into more overt physical and emotional abuse.

03:47.520 --> 03:52.240
Any audience with a grasp of regular old narrative convention will understand

03:52.240 --> 03:56.240
that Nathan is the villain, the antagonist of the story.

03:56.240 --> 04:01.360
And furthermore, regular old narrative convention would tell us that if Nathan is the villain,

04:01.360 --> 04:05.120
then Caleb, the audience's principal perspective in the story,

04:05.120 --> 04:10.160
who acts in opposition to Nathan, must therefore be the hero, right?

04:10.160 --> 04:15.360
Except we can ask, is Caleb heroic? Is he a good person?

04:15.360 --> 04:18.080
This is a question raised within the film.

04:18.080 --> 04:23.600
During one of Caleb and Ava's sessions, she asks him outright if he is a good person,

04:23.600 --> 04:27.760
so the movie is inviting the audience to consider this question too.

04:27.760 --> 04:32.400
This makes us question his possible motivations for wanting to save Ava.

04:32.400 --> 04:37.280
Does he see Ava as a person who he wants to help because it would be good to do so,

04:37.280 --> 04:40.960
or does he see her as an object that he wants to attain?

04:40.960 --> 04:45.760
Now, I don't mean to make this sound as if this is a strictly either-or situation.

04:45.760 --> 04:50.880
Caleb doesn't have to be 100% selfish or 100% altruistic.

04:50.880 --> 04:56.560
His motivations could be a mix of wanting to help and wanting to attain something for himself.

04:56.560 --> 05:01.600
But since we can't see inside his head, if we're trying to determine whether he is a good person,

05:01.600 --> 05:03.920
all we can do is judge his actions.

05:03.920 --> 05:08.080
Whatever his motivations might be, what does he actually do?

05:08.080 --> 05:13.360
So, with all this in mind, let's talk about the controversial ending to the story.

05:13.360 --> 05:18.960
Near the conclusion of the story, Nathan reveals a few of his manipulations to Caleb.

05:18.960 --> 05:22.000
Caleb wasn't randomly selected in a contest.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.080
He was specifically picked by Nathan, and Ava was specifically designed to appeal to him.

05:28.080 --> 05:33.120
Caleb wasn't brought to the house to personally conduct a test of Ava's consciousness.

05:33.120 --> 05:34.240
He is the test.

05:34.240 --> 05:39.280
Nathan wanted to evaluate Ava's intelligence by seeing if she could manipulate Caleb.

05:39.280 --> 05:45.440
Nathan also suggests to Caleb that Ava is lying to him in order to convince him to free her.

05:45.440 --> 05:48.080
Maybe Ava doesn't really like Caleb.

05:48.080 --> 05:53.120
Maybe she's just pretending to like him in order to prevent herself being deleted.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.840
Things come to a head when Ava escapes her room

05:55.840 --> 06:00.160
due to Caleb having previously reprogrammed the security doors,

06:00.240 --> 06:03.200
where she meets up with Kyoko, who has a knife.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.480
Make a note of that.

06:04.480 --> 06:08.400
Ava and Kyoko fight Nathan and manage to fatally stab him,

06:08.400 --> 06:12.880
but not before he disables Kyoko and destroys Ava's arm.

06:12.880 --> 06:17.600
Ava repairs herself using parts from Nathan's previous androids and then escapes,

06:17.600 --> 06:21.840
but crucially, she leaves Caleb locked in part of the facility.

06:21.840 --> 06:26.400
And I'll here quote the part of the Wikipedia plot summary that I take issue with.

06:26.400 --> 06:31.200
As Ava leaves the facility, she locks Caleb inside Nathan's surveillance room

06:31.200 --> 06:33.040
and ignores his screams,

06:33.040 --> 06:37.440
confirming she was manipulating Caleb, as Nathan suggested.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.520
So, that's the ending, then.

06:39.520 --> 06:42.960
Ava was actually an emotionless killer robot all along.

06:42.960 --> 06:47.680
She was just pretending in order to escape, and Caleb was a fool to trust her.

06:47.680 --> 06:51.840
So, Ex Machina is Jurassic Park crossed with The Terminator.

06:51.840 --> 06:55.360
You know, man is destroyed by his creation, that sort of thing.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.920
So, that's the message of the movie.

06:57.920 --> 07:00.640
Don't create an evil fembot.

07:00.640 --> 07:05.360
Now, I hope you can tell from my tone that I don't think too highly of this reading.

07:05.360 --> 07:08.640
Frustrated with Wikipedia, I went looking on YouTube

07:08.640 --> 07:11.440
for videos analyzing the ending of this movie,

07:11.440 --> 07:14.080
and a lot of them presented it just like this.

07:14.080 --> 07:17.920
Ava is a selfish robot who thinks in inhuman ways.

07:17.920 --> 07:23.040
She's an emotionless manipulator, and she betrayed the hero at the end of the story

07:23.040 --> 07:25.440
because she doesn't really care about him.

07:25.440 --> 07:30.960
And at least one of the videos I watched actually just compared Ava to The Terminator.

07:30.960 --> 07:32.960
So, this is one interpretation.

07:32.960 --> 07:37.200
The Wikipedia slash shallow YouTube video interpretation.

07:37.200 --> 07:41.360
But I'd like to share another view of what happened at the end of the movie,

07:41.360 --> 07:44.320
and it has primarily to do with Kyoko.

07:44.320 --> 07:46.080
And we can ask a question here.

07:46.080 --> 07:49.280
When it comes time for Ava to escape her room,

07:49.280 --> 07:51.920
why is Kyoko waiting there with a knife?

07:51.920 --> 07:53.920
How did she know to do that?

07:53.920 --> 07:56.160
Well, at a time prior to the escape,

07:56.160 --> 08:00.160
we see a scene of Ava in her room with Kyoko stepping inside.

08:00.720 --> 08:02.880
Ava looks surprised and says,

08:02.880 --> 08:03.920
who are you?

08:03.920 --> 08:06.240
And that's all we get of that.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.040
It's a very short scene, it's easy to miss,

08:09.040 --> 08:11.760
and it's easy to forget about after the ending,

08:11.760 --> 08:15.040
and it's not included in the Wikipedia plot summary.

08:15.040 --> 08:19.600
But if we put on our detective hats, we can deduce a few things from this scene.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.800
Firstly, Ava didn't know about Kyoko.

08:22.800 --> 08:28.480
Kyoko is another android living at the facility being controlled and abused by Nathan.

08:28.480 --> 08:30.320
Nathan has sex with Kyoko,

08:30.320 --> 08:35.680
which at the time is uncomfortable and raises some questions about power dynamics and such.

08:35.680 --> 08:38.080
But given that Kyoko later stabs Nathan,

08:38.080 --> 08:43.280
I think it would be very surprising if that aspect of their relationship was at all consensual.

08:43.280 --> 08:47.600
And it would probably be more accurate to say that Nathan rapes Kyoko.

08:47.680 --> 08:53.520
A scene in which Nathan is explaining to Caleb the android's ability to have sex is important here.

08:53.520 --> 08:57.680
Nathan explains that Caleb could physically have sex with Ava,

08:57.680 --> 09:02.000
and since she has pleasure receptors, he says, she would enjoy it.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.600
Consent clearly isn't really important to Nathan here.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.240
For him, he's installed the right equipment,

09:08.240 --> 09:10.080
so the enjoyment is a given.

09:10.080 --> 09:14.160
Whether the androids actually want to have sex isn't considered.

09:14.160 --> 09:18.160
Also noteworthy here is that the scene of Nathan and Kyoko is intercut

09:18.160 --> 09:21.840
with a fantasy Caleb is having about being with Ava,

09:21.840 --> 09:24.640
which is a very intentional comparison.

09:24.640 --> 09:28.240
There's also a point where Caleb turns Kyoko rather forcefully,

09:28.240 --> 09:30.480
which is a bit uncomfortable and invasive,

09:30.480 --> 09:34.960
and I think meant to mirror the scene in which we see Nathan controlling Kyoko's body.

09:34.960 --> 09:38.800
And when Kyoko later stabs Nathan, she puts her hand on his face

09:38.800 --> 09:41.920
in a similar way to what he forces her to do earlier,

09:41.920 --> 09:45.680
which I think conveys what Kyoko's motivations are here.

09:45.680 --> 09:48.960
Next, we learn from the scene of Kyoko entering Ava's room

09:48.960 --> 09:51.440
that Kyoko has gone off-program.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.480
She's doing something that she isn't supposed to be doing,

09:54.480 --> 09:58.080
which confirms to us that she has some degree of autonomy.

09:58.080 --> 10:02.160
She isn't just a thoughtless robot, she has an inner world.

10:02.160 --> 10:06.000
Now, Kyoko isn't supposed to be able to communicate with the other characters,

10:06.000 --> 10:08.240
but we get glimpses of her throughout the film

10:08.240 --> 10:10.880
that make us question whether this is really true.

10:10.880 --> 10:14.560
She appears to turn her head to better hear a conversation.

10:14.560 --> 10:19.200
We see her eyes open in seeming recognition of a topic under discussion.

10:19.200 --> 10:23.280
Her body language conveys that she can understand what is going on.

10:23.280 --> 10:26.560
An important scene here is when Caleb gets Nathan drunk

10:26.560 --> 10:31.440
and steals his keycard to explore parts of the facility he's forbidden from entering,

10:31.440 --> 10:35.920
and he finds several earlier android models hanging creepily in cabinets.

10:35.920 --> 10:40.640
And he's just watched videos on Nathan's computer of his earlier android tests,

10:40.640 --> 10:44.640
which are disturbing and reveal Nathan to be a jailer, basically.

10:44.640 --> 10:48.080
He's keeping conscious beings locked up against their will.

10:48.080 --> 10:51.680
Kyoko approaches Caleb at this point and peels back her skin

10:51.680 --> 10:54.720
to reveal to him that she, too, is an android.

10:54.720 --> 10:58.160
And this is clearly an attempt to communicate something.

10:58.160 --> 11:03.040
What Kyoko is attempting to communicate to Caleb here is open to interpretation, obviously,

11:03.040 --> 11:08.960
but given that her secret is revealed to Caleb at the moment he finds the disused android models,

11:08.960 --> 11:11.200
my interpretation is that Kyoko means,

11:11.760 --> 11:15.600
I am the same type of thing as these things you just found.

11:15.600 --> 11:20.400
I'm an android like them, and as such, I'm likely to share this fate.

11:20.400 --> 11:23.760
The same fate that Eva faces, incidentally.

11:23.760 --> 11:26.960
What Kyoko is doing here is asking for help.

11:26.960 --> 11:31.600
But what Caleb takes from this interaction is centered entirely on himself.

11:31.600 --> 11:36.720
The reveal that Kyoko is an android makes him concerned that he may also be an android,

11:36.800 --> 11:41.280
and he examines his body and cuts his arm open to make sure that he's actually human.

11:41.840 --> 11:44.480
Caleb doesn't try to save Kyoko.

11:44.480 --> 11:48.080
He doesn't let her in on the escape plan that he and Eva have.

11:48.080 --> 11:50.960
He doesn't see Kyoko as a person.

11:50.960 --> 11:57.280
Caleb is willing to leave her there, imprisoned at the facility, so long as he and Eva escape.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.520
So is Caleb a good person?

11:59.520 --> 12:01.440
Is he acting altruistically?

12:01.440 --> 12:04.160
Well, looking at his actions, no.

12:04.160 --> 12:09.360
If he truly saw Eva as a person, he would recognize that Kyoko is also a person

12:09.360 --> 12:11.680
and is equally worthy of being freed.

12:11.680 --> 12:16.960
But he isn't attracted to Kyoko like he's attracted to Eva, is the thing.

12:16.960 --> 12:23.760
This is a test of Caleb's humanity, of Caleb's capacity for empathy, and it's a test he fails.

12:23.760 --> 12:29.200
And this, we can infer, is another thing that Eva learns when Kyoko enters her room.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.080
She hasn't heard about Kyoko from Caleb.

12:32.080 --> 12:36.880
Caleb actually tells Eva in an earlier scene that he hasn't met anyone like Eva,

12:36.880 --> 12:38.320
meaning an android.

12:38.320 --> 12:42.400
And of course, at that point, he hasn't met Kyoko and doesn't know she's an android.

12:42.400 --> 12:45.920
But even after he does meet Kyoko and does find out she's an android,

12:45.920 --> 12:50.320
he doesn't think about helping her and he doesn't mention her to Eva.

12:50.320 --> 12:54.720
So from Eva's perspective, Caleb tells her he's never met another android

12:54.720 --> 12:58.000
and then into her room steps another android.

12:58.000 --> 13:03.120
So when Kyoko steps into the room, Eva gets an answer to her previous question.

13:03.120 --> 13:06.320
She learns that Caleb is not a good person.

13:06.320 --> 13:08.880
He's someone that she can't trust.

13:08.880 --> 13:15.120
It's not hard to see this scene as Kyoko going to Eva for help after failing to get help from Caleb.

13:15.120 --> 13:20.320
And it's also not hard to imagine Eva seeing Caleb's lack of interest in helping Kyoko

13:20.320 --> 13:24.640
as an insight into how he might view and treat her as well.

13:24.640 --> 13:29.040
With all that in mind, we can rewatch the scene in which Eva escapes.

13:29.040 --> 13:33.200
So she steps out of the room, leaving Caleb inside behind her,

13:33.200 --> 13:36.880
and then she pauses and she looks down at Kyoko's body.

13:36.880 --> 13:40.320
And this is a deliberate shot that we see from her perspective.

13:40.320 --> 13:44.240
And then after a brief moment, she appears to spend thinking to herself.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.600
She then continues and calls the elevator to leave,

13:47.600 --> 13:50.960
giving Caleb one last look before the doors shut.

13:51.040 --> 13:55.840
So my interpretation of the ending is not that Eva was an emotionless killer robot

13:55.840 --> 13:58.160
who was manipulating Caleb all along.

13:58.160 --> 14:03.680
Eva clearly has thoughts and feelings, given how she acts when no one is around to observe her.

14:03.680 --> 14:07.920
After she escapes, she smiles, seeing new things for the first time.

14:07.920 --> 14:12.560
She runs her hands over the grass, feels the sun on her face.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.800
No other characters are watching at this point.

14:14.800 --> 14:17.200
This isn't an act or a manipulation.

14:17.200 --> 14:21.760
And crucially, the last we see of Eva is her people watching at an intersection,

14:21.760 --> 14:25.840
something that she told Caleb during one of their sessions that she would like to do.

14:26.400 --> 14:29.760
This tells us that she wasn't always lying to him.

14:29.760 --> 14:33.120
She, at the very least, wasn't just trying to manipulate him.

14:33.120 --> 14:35.680
Some of what she told him was the truth.

14:35.680 --> 14:40.480
And I'd go so far to say that Eva was probably planning to escape with Caleb

14:40.480 --> 14:42.400
up until she met Kyoko.

14:42.400 --> 14:46.720
This is not to say that she couldn't also have been manipulating him to some degree,

14:46.800 --> 14:50.480
but the real question for Eva is whether she can trust Caleb,

14:50.480 --> 14:54.320
and she finds out the answer to that question when she meets Kyoko.

14:54.320 --> 14:58.800
And the last we see of Caleb in the film is him sitting trapped behind the glass door,

14:58.800 --> 15:02.720
looking at and being watched by the lifeless body of Kyoko.

15:02.720 --> 15:05.680
This is the moral at the end of the fable here.

15:05.680 --> 15:09.760
We can imagine a more obvious and worse version of Ex Machina,

15:09.760 --> 15:12.560
where after pausing to look at Kyoko's body,

15:12.560 --> 15:14.400
Eva turns to Caleb and says,

15:28.000 --> 15:29.600
Or we can imagine her saying,

15:35.200 --> 15:39.440
I think this ending confused a lot of people because it books the narrative convention

15:39.440 --> 15:42.560
of having the protagonist automatically be a good person

15:42.560 --> 15:45.920
by virtue of being in opposition to the antagonist.

15:45.920 --> 15:49.280
I described Caleb as the first main character before.

15:49.280 --> 15:53.440
He's the person who the camera and thus the story initially follows.

15:53.440 --> 15:55.520
But the camera isn't loyal to Caleb.

15:55.520 --> 15:59.840
It will follow other characters and show their perception of what's going on.

15:59.840 --> 16:03.440
And it's arguable before she escapes, but certainly afterwards,

16:03.440 --> 16:05.920
Eva is just the main character now.

16:05.920 --> 16:07.360
This is her story.

16:07.360 --> 16:09.680
She beat her jailer and escaped.

16:09.680 --> 16:14.560
I saw a lot of people complain about this ending because they thought Eva betrayed Caleb,

16:14.560 --> 16:19.200
but I think what the real annoyance is there is that the narrative betrayed Caleb

16:19.200 --> 16:21.600
by choosing a new main character.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.600
One more thing I'd like to point out here,

16:23.600 --> 16:29.200
to those who felt that Eva was of course manipulating Caleb because she's an android,

16:29.200 --> 16:32.160
is that someone being an android or not within the movie

16:32.160 --> 16:36.560
has no relation to their ability or likelihood to manipulate others.

16:36.560 --> 16:42.000
After all, Nathan is a human and he manipulates and lies to Caleb constantly.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.360
Caleb is a human and he manipulates Nathan into getting drunk so he can steal his keycard.

16:47.360 --> 16:50.160
You know, does this person really like me?

16:50.160 --> 16:52.960
Are they just using me to get something they want?

16:52.960 --> 16:54.320
Are they just pretending?

16:54.320 --> 16:57.440
Are they even capable of loving another person?

16:57.440 --> 17:00.640
These are all questions we could ask of human relationships.

17:00.640 --> 17:02.560
They're very human questions.

17:02.560 --> 17:05.360
Whether someone is an android or flesh and blood,

17:05.360 --> 17:08.640
whether they're manipulating others or telling the truth,

17:08.640 --> 17:11.840
this should have no bearing on whether we see them as people.

17:11.840 --> 17:15.120
This isn't a story about humans versus androids,

17:15.120 --> 17:18.080
it's a story about some people in a place.

17:18.080 --> 17:23.360
And ultimately, neither Nathan nor Caleb see Kyoko and Eva as people.

17:23.360 --> 17:25.120
They see them as women.

17:25.120 --> 17:28.400
To Nathan, that means something to be controlled and used,

17:28.400 --> 17:32.000
and to Caleb, that means something to rescue and detain for himself,

17:32.000 --> 17:36.400
but fundamentally it means as objects and not as people.

17:36.400 --> 17:41.440
So then, Eva locks Caleb inside Nathan's surveillance room and ignores his screams,

17:41.440 --> 17:45.040
confirming she was manipulating Caleb as Nathan suggested.

17:45.600 --> 17:51.360
I think this is an overly simplistic reading of the ending and stated entirely too concretely,

17:51.360 --> 17:54.960
and I hope I've explained another interpretation of the ending well enough

17:54.960 --> 17:56.640
that you would agree with me there.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.960
And I think it would be good if this page was rewritten

17:58.960 --> 18:01.920
to reflect a little bit more of the movie's ambiguity.

18:02.480 --> 18:03.920
However, I do need to add,

18:03.920 --> 18:07.600
please don't storm off to mass edit the Wikipedia page for this movie.

18:07.600 --> 18:11.280
I don't want to be accused of starting some wiki edit raid or something.

18:11.840 --> 18:12.480
Anyway.

18:12.480 --> 18:14.560
Thanks a lot for watching, everyone.

18:14.560 --> 18:18.720
I have a sore throat today, so I'm having a robot read out my outro.

18:18.720 --> 18:19.680
Beep boop.

18:19.680 --> 18:22.800
This video was about robots, so this seemed apropos.

18:23.520 --> 18:27.040
Thank you especially to all my supporters over on Patreon.

18:27.040 --> 18:30.160
